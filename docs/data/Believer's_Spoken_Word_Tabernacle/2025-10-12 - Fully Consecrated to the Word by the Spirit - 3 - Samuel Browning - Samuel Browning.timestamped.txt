[37:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want to say we're just so so
[37:16] thankful for God's mercy and so glad to
[37:18] be able to be gathered together.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Once again, and it's always such a
[37:23] real privilege,
[37:24] &gt;&gt; amen, that God has given to us. And you

[37:30] the opening parts of Feast of the
[37:31] Trumpets. And he said, "One day these
[37:34] things will become fond memories."
[37:36] And um we don't know of all the path but
[37:39] one thing we do is know that every
[37:41] single moment Lord I want to receive
[37:45] &gt;&gt; what you have for me.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to I want to further anoint
[37:49] my eyes that I can see and I want to I
[37:51] want to step in to become what the
[37:54] vision of the word is saying
[37:56] I am.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. We so thank the Lord. Just
[38:01] wonderful service here on Thursday
[38:02] evening. And uh so much was was spoken
[38:06] and was said within that and uh we just
[38:09] so thank God for his grace. And
[38:13] Amen. God operates in such continuity.
[38:16] Amen. And he's always he's always right
[38:18] on time in our lives. And let's just go
[38:21] to him in a word of prayer here this
[38:22] morning.
[38:24] Amen. Heavenly Father,
[38:28] Lord Jesus, what a privilege it is Lord
[38:30] that you have given to us that Lord that
[38:34] we could we could know you Lord
[38:38] oh God in the power of your resurrection
[38:42] and then Lord through that of the
[38:44] fellowship of your sufferings
[38:48] Lord Jesus through every test through
[38:51] every trial
[38:53] through every circumstance of life.
[38:55] Lord,
[38:56] &gt;&gt; oh God, you you make yourself known that
[39:01] you're the everpresent God.
[39:03] Lord, when things become difficult or
[39:06] hard,
[39:08] that's where you show your faithfulness,
[39:10] Lord.
[39:12] You show your faithfulness to your word.
[39:16] Just like it was with the Hebrew
[39:17] children when they walked into that
[39:20] fiery furnace or were thrown in there.
[39:22] You met them in there. Oh God, Daniel
[39:26] and the lion's den. Very familiar
[39:29] familiar events, but oh God is all to
[39:34] build our faith, Lord, to realize that
[39:38] you're right there with us, Lord. A
[39:40] friend that stickketh closer than a
[39:42] brother. and how we love you Lord Jesus.
[39:46] We pray this morning that Lord once
[39:48] again that you would just come Lord in a
[39:52] special way
[39:54] God just allowing the man part to step
[39:56] aside.
[39:58] Allow this congregation Lord just to
[40:00] step aside for Lord just a few words
[40:04] from you would mean more than volumes
[40:08] that could be said.
[40:10] So we ask that God that you would guide
[40:12] us, Lord, in the time that we have
[40:14] before us. May the word of God just so
[40:17] penetrate into the depths of our heart,
[40:20] minister to our needs, Lord. We're here,
[40:23] Father, to be led by you, Lord. And our
[40:26] desire is to be led deeper, Lord. and
[40:29] that father if there is anything in the
[40:32] way that Lord that it would just be
[40:34] cleared out because the greatest
[40:36] privilege we have as sons and daughters
[40:39] of God is to be led by the spirit of
[40:41] God. So Lord we want to be sensitive to
[40:44] you. We want to be Lord just ever so led
[40:48] and just even the daily moments of life
[40:52] oh God. Father in the bringing of every
[40:55] thought in captivity oh God even to all
[40:58] that we do and we say Lord we want it
[41:01] all to be under the name of Jesus
[41:03] Christ. So Lord we would ask God for
[41:06] your complete and divine leadership even
[41:08] in this moment. Lord we love you and we
[41:11] thank you father in Jesus name. Amen.
[41:14] Amen. Amen. If you'll turn with me to
[41:19] Luke chap uh Leviticus chapter 8 and I
[41:22] want to just certainly greet each and
[41:24] every one of you. Greet
[41:27] I think visitors and was here and I
[41:30] don't know who all the visitors. I don't
[41:32] see if it's Brian and Gracie. Oh, God
[41:35] bless you, sister Eth. My goodness. Good
[41:37] to see you. My so good. Amen. And u so
[41:43] we just want to say so good to be
[41:45] together. I want to remind you this
[41:48] coming Friday, Lord willing, we'll uh
[41:50] have that uh probably be our last
[41:52] fireside fellowship. Um and uh begin
[41:55] about seven and have some things for the
[41:58] fall and probably some different things,
[42:00] you know, that would be there and just
[42:02] was a wonderful time and I'm sure we'll
[42:04] appreciate the fire like we did the last
[42:06] time. it it got cool and um so let's
[42:11] look here in the word and I want to just
[42:14] open up with verse one. We'll read and
[42:16] then let you have your seats. And the
[42:18] Lord spake unto Moses saying, "Take
[42:20] Aaron and his sons with him and the
[42:23] garments and the anointing oil and a
[42:26] bulock for the sin offering and two rams
[42:30] and a basket of unleavened bread. and
[42:33] gather thou all the congregation
[42:34] together unto the door of the tabernacle
[42:37] of the congregation. And Moses did as
[42:41] the Lord commanded him. And the assembly
[42:43] was gathered together unto the door of
[42:46] the tabernacle of the congregation. And
[42:48] Moses said unto the congregation, "This
[42:52] is the thing which the Lord commanded to
[42:55] be done." Now, if you'll skip with me to
[42:58] verse 22, I want to just read three more
[43:00] verses of scripture here.
[43:03] And he brought the other ram, the ram of
[43:07] consecration.
[43:08] And Aaron and his sons laid their hands
[43:11] upon the head of the ram, and he slew
[43:14] it. And Moses took of the blood of it,
[43:17] and put it upon the tip of Aaron's right
[43:20] ear, and upon the thumb of his right
[43:23] hand, and upon the great toe of his
[43:26] right foot. And he brought Aaron's sons.
[43:30] And Moses put of the blood upon the tip
[43:33] of their right ear, and upon the thumbs
[43:36] of their right hands, and upon the great
[43:39] toes of their right feet. And Moses
[43:42] sprinkled the blood upon the altar
[43:45] roundabout.
[43:47] Amen. May God bless you and bless the
[43:49] reading of the word as you're being
[43:50] seated.
[43:52] I'd like to just um continuing this
[43:56] thought here this morning on being fully
[43:58] consecrated to the word
[44:01] by the spirit. And with that sub thought
[44:05] of the anointing
[44:07] follows the blood. And I want to just in
[44:12] looking at this is to realize that when
[44:16] um when we when we're looking at this
[44:20] everything every when we read through
[44:23] the scriptures and this is familiar.
[44:25] It's you hear this said quite often but
[44:27] it's true is that every when we're
[44:30] reading in the scriptures we should see
[44:33] Jesus Christ through it all. And the
[44:36] prophet would be so um uh direct with us
[44:39] to say if you don't then go back and
[44:42] read it again for you have missed it.
[44:45] And so that's where the things that
[44:47] sometimes we even come to places when
[44:49] we're reading in the scripture and to
[44:51] say Lord let me see you in this
[44:55] scripture because when we can see him
[44:58] then we can see ourselves
[45:00] &gt;&gt; because remember that's we are a part of
[45:03] that word and so that's God's desire is
[45:06] to bring that to our lives that we can
[45:09] see because when we can see and God
[45:12] opens by revelation that's what the
[45:14] spirit of God does that's while the Lord
[45:17] Jesus he said the son can do nothing but
[45:19] what he seeth the father doing that
[45:21] doeth the son likewise. So the vision
[45:24] that was breaking what God's will was
[45:26] being made known there uh in that of the
[45:29] lord Jesus Christ. was acted out then in
[45:32] flesh. And that's the same thing that
[45:34] God was restoring back to us through and
[45:39] by the blood that was shed for us and
[45:41] the spirit of God coming to where that
[45:43] God would come back into a full
[45:47] fellowship with man once again. And so
[45:50] when we're looking at this, I I don't I
[45:52] want you to uh to look that it's all
[45:55] speaking of of God's desire when he
[45:58] would take Aaron and his sons and God
[46:01] would give the direction and the word
[46:03] and God would actually bring them unto
[46:06] himself that that they might serve him
[46:10] and a very special delegation. And I
[46:12] want to say that it's God who provided
[46:15] when we opened up our scriptures there.
[46:18] It is God that provided all things that
[46:21] was needed in order for for Aaron and
[46:24] his sons to come in to that place to be
[46:28] fully consecrated united with the word.
[46:30] And this is only a type that all speaks
[46:33] of the Lord Jesus Christ because it is
[46:36] the Holy Spirit which is God which is
[46:38] Christ the anointing oil. It was him. He
[46:42] gave his life for us as the sin
[46:44] offering. And then he also as the burnt
[46:48] offering he was completely accepted. He
[46:51] was accepted and as he was was accepted
[46:54] he was totally consecrated to the will
[46:57] of the father. Remember when when the
[47:00] bible says in the book of psalms that uh
[47:02] Paul would pick it up in writing in
[47:04] Hebrews of how that sacrifice and
[47:06] offering thou hastest not pleasure. And
[47:09] it wasn't that God did not have a
[47:11] delight to be able to at least
[47:13] fellowship with man under a covering,
[47:15] but it was only given for a time and
[47:18] speaking of the of that perfect
[47:20] sacrifice that would come to where that
[47:23] man could actually stand in God's
[47:25] presence completely completely innocent.
[47:30] And there's only one thing that could do
[47:31] that. You know, brother Brandham tells
[47:33] us he when he was dedicating a baby
[47:35] there and standing in the gap and he
[47:36] says, "I want you to think," he said,
[47:38] "that how innocent this baby is, you
[47:41] know, it doesn't know right or wrong."
[47:42] He said, "But do you know when you've
[47:44] been born again of the spirit of God,
[47:46] you're actually more innocent than what
[47:48] this child is." Because that's the power
[47:52] of the blood of Jesus Christ. You see
[47:54] that's that's what that's what this
[47:57] message come to do is to point us and
[47:59] take us away from our looking at
[48:02] ourselves from looking at man and to
[48:05] looking to the Lord Jesus that he is
[48:08] your all sufficiency
[48:11] &gt;&gt; he's all that you have need of every
[48:14] everything in life every victory of the
[48:17] rapture it's all laid within him
[48:21] &gt;&gt; and and and there and there's nothing
[48:23] that he would shrink back from. There's
[48:25] no situation, there's no condition that
[48:27] is overwhelming or too much for him. And
[48:29] to see that he provided all of this for
[48:33] us in in our lives. And you think of how
[48:36] that you know when you notice this the
[48:38] as we read in the in in in the scripture
[48:41] here of how with that ram of
[48:43] consecration that in each one of these
[48:46] sacrifices they had to lay their hands
[48:49] upon the sin offering and there there
[48:52] would be that of identifying that this
[48:55] one this innocent one is taking my
[48:58] place. I'm guilty, but he's taking my
[49:01] place. And the confessing their sins and
[49:03] that of the burnt offering that he is my
[49:07] acceptance. They would lay their hands
[49:09] upon that. And then coming to the ram of
[49:12] consecration and then even out of the
[49:15] ram of consecration. I won't get to it
[49:17] this morning, but into the wave offering
[49:19] where they would take these the parts of
[49:21] the consecration and in their hands
[49:24] would wave it before God. Every one of
[49:27] these things was a handson event and
[49:29] that simply spoke of them identifying
[49:33] with what God in his grace had provided
[49:37] and shown for them as the way that
[49:39] that's the only thing that we have to do
[49:42] is have faith in the grace of God that
[49:44] is coming to us. And really, there's
[49:46] only one thing that can really bring
[49:48] faith, and that's the grace of God that
[49:50] comes through the word of God because I
[49:53] it's working to take your eyes and your
[49:55] focus off of yourself unto him who is
[49:59] our way. And so within this, this is why
[50:03] that when the applying of the blood, all
[50:05] of this was a working through of a
[50:08] direction that God would give down
[50:10] through there so that they would come
[50:12] into an actual place of service and of
[50:15] worship. And you know, once again, I I
[50:18] don't want to to elaborate too much on
[50:20] this, but they would come through this
[50:22] whole process 7 days until they come to
[50:25] a place of a full consecration. And God
[50:28] has brought a people in this hour down
[50:31] through seven ages that have been
[50:33] dedicated to the unleavened bread of the
[50:35] word of God where the spirit of God has
[50:38] been working down through the ages to
[50:40] where now there is a people that has has
[50:43] come to the place to not only see the
[50:45] open door that that we can ascend into
[50:48] God's presence but God has himself
[50:51] provided a way in opening and taking off
[50:55] the seals off the book that you and I
[50:58] might come to a complete cleansing away
[51:02] from the filth of anything of this
[51:04] world, away from the filth of church
[51:07] anity and away from the filth of isms.
[51:09] And I'm not throwing off on churches,
[51:11] but what I'm trying to say is is that we
[51:14] recognize that God allowed men to probe
[51:16] into truth. But God in this hour took
[51:20] all of the truths that was scattered.
[51:22] And what God did, he didn't plagiarize
[51:25] truths, but God simply stepped down and
[51:27] said, "This was me in Luther. This was
[51:30] me in Wesley. This was me right here in
[51:33] in maybe pink. This was here. This was
[51:35] me." And what did he do? He assembled
[51:37] the truth. So what you see, it was
[51:40] Christ that was all of this truth.
[51:42] Because how did they receive that truth?
[51:45] These men were looking for the coming of
[51:47] the Lord. They knew. Luther knew the
[51:49] pillar of fire would return to the
[51:51] church.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; He that's why when God dealt with Luther
[51:55] the way he did, he could operate in a
[51:57] manner to know that God is going to
[51:59] return to the church in this hour. You
[52:01] say, "How do you know that?" Because not
[52:03] only the message that was given him of
[52:05] the just shall live by faith, but he
[52:07] took that word revelation in his heart
[52:09] and he preached that word and lived that
[52:11] word and there was a people that was
[52:14] made ready for the coming of the Lord.
[52:17] That's right. Right? And then Wesley, he
[52:19] knew the pillar of fire would come
[52:21] within this hour. He was waiting on it.
[52:23] And the prophet said, they didn't live
[52:26] long enough to see this. But you see,
[52:28] like Luther, like Wesley, and like the
[52:30] rest of them, they all were looking for
[52:32] the coming of the Lord. They were all
[52:34] looking and knowing that in this
[52:36] generation, this time that God was going
[52:40] to come back. That's how it was all the
[52:42] way from the Garden of Eden all the way
[52:44] down. They were looking for the coming
[52:46] of the Messiah. When they offered the
[52:48] lamb, they were looking for the coming
[52:51] of the Messiah. It wasn't just a ritual.
[52:54] It wasn't just something they did.
[52:55] That's why you can hear David say, "I
[52:57] was glad when they said unto me, let us
[53:00] go to the house of the Lord."
[53:03] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[53:05] &gt;&gt; They would go there during their three
[53:06] times of the year that the sons had to
[53:09] come and present themselves before God.
[53:12] And God has operated down through three
[53:15] dispensations. Son of God, son of man,
[53:18] son of David. And it is God that is
[53:20] calling his sons to present themselves.
[53:23] Not what we can bring, not what we can
[53:26] achieve, but just present yourself in
[53:29] God's presence. And God has what's
[53:32] needed in order to release that part of
[53:35] himself in you that's really him.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; It's God working. It's not what what I
[53:43] can bring. I I I have nothing. You have
[53:46] nothing that we could bring. Aaron and
[53:48] his sons had nothing that they could
[53:50] bring. That's why Paul could say,
[53:52] "Present your bodies."
[53:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; Just present it. Just just surrender it.
[53:56] Just say, "Here I am, Lord. Here I am."
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; That's the greatest thing Isaiah could
[54:02] do.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Isaiah when he saw the vision break, he
[54:05] said, "Here am I."
[54:08] &gt;&gt; See, he was surrendering. He just
[54:10] presented himself. There's nothing he
[54:12] could do. But God provided the
[54:14] cleansing.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; The word of God came to take came the
[54:18] presence of God moving. Who's going to
[54:20] go for me? And Isaiah saw the task. He
[54:22] saw the finishing up of the great
[54:24] commission. He saw that and he said and
[54:26] and notice he then looks to himself
[54:28] because he said, "Whoa, it's me. I'm a
[54:31] man of unclean lips. What's he
[54:32] recognizing? The word being revealed
[54:35] really reveals there needs to be a
[54:37] cleansing." And as that comes, what
[54:39] happens? God stepping down. That's all
[54:42] God wanted Isaiah to say is woe is woe
[54:45] is me. I need cleansing. And God said,
[54:47] I've got what you need. I've got what
[54:49] what is needed to take care of that. And
[54:52] then after that of the of that
[54:54] confession that came, there came forth
[54:57] cleansing. So it came forth repentance.
[54:59] I'm all I'm a man of unclean lips. Then
[55:02] came forth cleansing by a live coal from
[55:06] the altar where the sacrifice had been
[55:10] received and offered up.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; And after the cleansing, then came the
[55:15] commissioning.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; See, God in this age, he that's why God
[55:20] allowed even Uzziah to pass off the
[55:22] scene. Uzziah was a type of of that of
[55:26] even organizations where starts out real
[55:29] good. The Bible tells us that God was
[55:31] with you, Uzziah. He conquered and he he
[55:34] defeated many within that. And the Bible
[55:37] said God was with him until he began to
[55:40] get elevated in his heart.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; I pray God, every one of us, every from
[55:46] this wall clear all the way and anywhere
[55:48] on here, God keep us little in our own
[55:50] lives.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Let us remember that it's not us that
[55:54] even called us. It's not us that even
[55:58] that that that then that that even
[55:59] brought forth the confession. It was
[56:01] God's grace that revealed I am your
[56:04] safety. I am your cleansing.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; And the cleansing comes and then what
[56:13] comes a pouring in of himself. It's a
[56:15] commissioning. So it's not it's not you
[56:18] walking with the message. It's the
[56:20] message and God's living burning reality
[56:23] of his fire in your life and it's the
[56:27] spirit packing the message
[56:29] &gt;&gt; through your life.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; It's all God's work.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; One thing you'll find among different
[56:39] for when the bride than among that of
[56:41] where the Bible says in that day where
[56:44] there will be separated as sheep from
[56:47] goats. It didn't say they were sheep,
[56:49] but as sheep from goats. That's those
[56:51] who who missed the baptism of the Holy
[56:53] Ghost. They they they missed it. They
[56:55] they they but but listen, let me just
[56:57] say it. It wasn't that they were elect
[57:00] and they missed it. They missed it. And
[57:02] they they were they were standing there
[57:04] and notice there were even those who
[57:06] would come and say, "Lord, haven't I
[57:08] done this and haven't I done this and
[57:10] haven't I done that?" And they were
[57:12] relying and resting upon expressions of
[57:16] the Holy Spirit that came through their
[57:19] life instead of relying on the Holy
[57:22] Spirit himself who is the word. See how
[57:25] the fine line deception is where you can
[57:28] rely upon expressions. That's why we
[57:30] don't rely upon gifts. We don't rely
[57:33] upon those things. But it is truly like
[57:35] the prophet said, it is a manifestation
[57:38] that the Holy Spirit is there working
[57:39] through the individual. But it's not the
[57:41] sign and evidence of a spiritfilled
[57:44] individual. What is that sign? Is those
[57:46] who can receive the word for their day.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; Another place brother said genuine faith
[57:54] in the word of God. And you know what?
[57:56] And supernatural that is supernatural.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; And then all the rest of it goes with
[58:01] it. And for the bride of Jesus Christ,
[58:04] you may not be gifted like a somebody
[58:06] else. I'm not gifted like other
[58:07] ministers are, but I'm not resting on my
[58:10] gift. I am resting on the word himself,
[58:13] the Holy Spirit, and what God has done
[58:16] in my life. And that's what I'm resting
[58:18] on.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; And that's what God wants you to rest on
[58:22] because there's promises to be taken in
[58:24] this hour. And when you're resting on
[58:26] that word, you realize I'm a part of
[58:28] that word. And that word is a part of
[58:30] me. The rapture is not coming without
[58:32] me.
[58:37] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; That is so good.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; So God's provided a way here. That's why
[58:46] the prophet would say and just let me
[58:48] let me just drop this in just here a
[58:50] little bit. He would say in humble
[58:52] thyself. He takes the podium once again
[58:54] because that message is broken two
[58:56] parts. Said God will never put his
[58:58] spirit in an unholy, unrighteous,
[59:00] disobedient temple. Can can the Holy
[59:03] Spirit fall? The rain falls on the just
[59:04] and unjust. Sure. But no, it's got to
[59:07] come in the way of the cleansing of our
[59:11] hearts from all guile and all iniquity
[59:14] that we might be pure before God that he
[59:17] might work his pure Holy Spirit through
[59:20] us to bring these things to pass. And he
[59:23] quotes Jude, I earnestly contend for the
[59:25] faith that was once delivered to the
[59:27] saints. He said they got away from that.
[59:30] How men of corrupt mind and so forth had
[59:34] come in and begaled them away from the
[59:37] real things of God.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; And God can only operate as we let him
[59:42] operate. Now, I don't want you to take
[59:44] this even what I'm I'm quoting here and
[59:47] ministering this morning and place this
[59:49] message off to be just something of
[59:52] well, I've already come through that.
[59:53] Let me just tell you, the Bible says,
[59:55] "Let every man know how to possess his
[59:59] vessel unto sanctification and honor."
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; And that is an ongoing work in our life.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Let me just say it to you like this.
[1:00:09] There's things that maybe you've been
[1:00:10] praying, God, and Lord, change this
[1:00:12] about me. Change this about me. And let
[1:00:15] me just give you a news flash here.
[1:00:17] There's things that God is not going to
[1:00:18] change about you, but he's going to
[1:00:20] manifest his glory by giving you
[1:00:23] discernment by the word to recognize
[1:00:26] when things want to come in and try to
[1:00:28] flare up your personality, try to flare
[1:00:30] up your temperament. And you know what?
[1:00:32] God wants you to stand there as a son of
[1:00:34] God over this right here and say, "Not
[1:00:38] today, Satan. You're not rising up here
[1:00:41] in this vessel."
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's overcoming to recognize
[1:00:45] that the God in you has already overcome
[1:00:48] this. So, we need cleansing. That's
[1:00:51] right. For the Holy Spirit to come and
[1:00:53] we need to continually be cleansed that
[1:00:56] he might work in our midst.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; So, now I want to just say it like this.
[1:01:04] The way the way in here is the person of
[1:01:07] Jesus Christ. The way is not a list of
[1:01:11] ordinances and commandments.
[1:01:14] It's the person of Jesus Christ. That's
[1:01:17] where I understand Israel was blinded.
[1:01:19] But Paul tells us in re in in in Romans
[1:01:22] that they did not receive the
[1:01:25] righteousness of God.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; That's good. That's good.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Now, God gave them a substitute until
[1:01:31] the word would come. And the whole
[1:01:34] reason the word came was for redemption.
[1:01:37] The word never came to anoint their
[1:01:39] systems.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? The word never came
[1:01:43] to a to anoint Phariseism, Sadduceism.
[1:01:47] The word came to vindicate. The The word
[1:01:51] himself. It came to make himself known
[1:01:54] to those the Bible said that were
[1:01:56] sitting in darkness
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; that were wanting. There was a longing.
[1:02:00] There was a a hunger. I know there's a
[1:02:02] deep. I know there's a place that I can
[1:02:04] live in victory. I know there's a place
[1:02:06] that I can rise above that. What was
[1:02:08] that? It was the call of the hour while
[1:02:11] the word was coming forth that was
[1:02:13] calling what was laying on the inside of
[1:02:16] there. And here came the Messiah.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The word made flesh.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; And even while the word was made flesh,
[1:02:27] before it was ever offered up at
[1:02:29] Calvary,
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; the Jubilee was being sounded.
[1:02:34] The Bible said their sicknesses he
[1:02:36] lifted them. They He bore them that it
[1:02:39] might be fulfilled in Isaiah 53. He had
[1:02:41] borne our sorrows.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; He came to those that were tormented.
[1:02:46] Legion that had demons and spirits all
[1:02:48] that had accumulated in his life. And
[1:02:51] Legion wanted free from that. He was
[1:02:53] under darkness. There was a little woman
[1:02:55] at the well. She was longing for the
[1:02:57] Messiah. You know why she was longing
[1:02:58] for that? You know why Legion was
[1:03:00] longing for that? Cuz the Messiah, the
[1:03:03] answer, the need was on earth.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? They didn't need
[1:03:09] more Bible training. They needed the
[1:03:11] living God.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet said in the
[1:03:14] rising of the sun, this little eagle
[1:03:16] didn't need pictures of eagles.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Or teachings on eagles. What this little
[1:03:23] eagle needed was to see a being like
[1:03:26] itself.
[1:03:27] [Music]
[1:03:28] [Applause]
[1:03:30] So, I'm telling you, the way is not a is
[1:03:33] not a list of ordinances and
[1:03:34] commandments. That's where Israel, they
[1:03:37] didn't want to forsake and accept God's
[1:03:39] righteousness. But you see, the person
[1:03:41] of Jesus Christ, the living word, being
[1:03:44] revealed among us and moving in your
[1:03:46] life will lead you to deeper thoughts.
[1:03:48] It'll lead you to higher objectives in
[1:03:51] your walk with God.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to think I want you to think
[1:03:55] about this. God himself is the one that
[1:03:57] made that requirement. And when God
[1:03:59] makes that requirement that there's no
[1:04:01] way that that of the of the of the of
[1:04:04] man could come back into fellowship with
[1:04:06] God unless God come down himself, it
[1:04:09] required a kinsman. And this is why the
[1:04:12] prophet would I want you to understand
[1:04:14] this. The prophet would stand there in
[1:04:16] the message, the breach, and take and
[1:04:18] point out the necessity for the kinsmen
[1:04:22] to come in order to free man from sin.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; So when he's preaching that in the
[1:04:30] breach, he's not altogether taking you
[1:04:33] back to a historical happening. What he
[1:04:36] is doing when he says, "Let me sound a
[1:04:39] trumpet unto you that the virgin birth
[1:04:42] produced this." That's right.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; What is happening there? The sacrifice,
[1:04:48] the atonement has already been offered
[1:04:50] up. But God in this hour sent a prophet.
[1:04:53] The prophet that God sent was not to
[1:04:55] elevate the man. But a prophet is a sear
[1:04:58] and he's caught up above everything to
[1:05:01] be able to look back and to see the
[1:05:04] reality. And that's what God sent a word
[1:05:07] in this hour to call us back to the true
[1:05:10] atonement. Not another atonement. Not
[1:05:12] another killing, not another sacrifice,
[1:05:15] but to take us and point us to the all
[1:05:18] sufficiency of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Where man was being pointed to other
[1:05:23] things. And God in this hour opened up
[1:05:26] his word outside of the camp.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; And he called to his children, "Come out
[1:05:33] of the camp. Come out of her, my
[1:05:36] people." Amen.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet said, "God opened
[1:05:41] these seven seals outside of
[1:05:43] denomination
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; cuz they've always been against it."
[1:05:47] What is those seven seals? It not only
[1:05:49] takes the cover off of Satan and his
[1:05:51] attempted destruction and discrediting
[1:05:54] of God's word. But who is it that's
[1:05:56] uncovering the devil?
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; I tell you who it is. It's that seven
[1:06:01] seal.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; It's Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; What is that seven seal? It's Christ
[1:06:07] being reproduced in a bride body.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; It's the living word, the Messiah veiled
[1:06:14] in Messiah.
[1:06:16] [Applause]
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; It's the coming of the Lord.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet called it the
[1:06:24] bride coming.
[1:06:25] [Applause]
[1:06:27] It's Christ coming down in veils.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; And his coming in your life so silences
[1:06:35] every other voice.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; That's why his coming is a half hour of
[1:06:39] silence.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; It's not known as any other man. And the
[1:06:42] prophet tells us when the veil drops
[1:06:44] behind you, you can't even hear the
[1:06:45] outside noise. God works by such a way
[1:06:48] in this hour to silence every other
[1:06:50] voice. Amen.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; So where your life is being completely
[1:06:54] and you bring every thought in
[1:06:56] subjection to the voice that not only
[1:06:58] spoke out here but the voice on the
[1:07:00] inside that has rose up and said Lord I
[1:07:03] believe you Lord I receive you Lord
[1:07:06] that's who I am and it rises from the
[1:07:08] voice that is within your life
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; so now what what had come on display is
[1:07:16] the very righteousness of almighty God.
[1:07:20] It's God's righteousness that has become
[1:07:23] on display in our life. Now watch how
[1:07:25] Paul would put this. But now the
[1:07:27] righteousness of God without the law is
[1:07:30] manifested being witnessed by the law
[1:07:32] and the prophets. Even the righteousness
[1:07:34] of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ
[1:07:37] unto all and upon all them that believe.
[1:07:40] For there is no difference. For all have
[1:07:42] sinned and come short of the glory of
[1:07:44] God, being justified freely by his grace
[1:07:48] through the redemption that is in Christ
[1:07:50] Jesus, whom God hath set forth to be a
[1:07:53] propitiation through faith in his blood,
[1:07:57] to declare his righteousness for the
[1:08:00] remission of sins that are passed
[1:08:02] through the forbearance of God. to
[1:08:04] declare, I say at this time, his
[1:08:06] righteousness, that he might be just,
[1:08:09] and the justifier of him that believeth
[1:08:12] in Jesus. Where is boasting then? It is
[1:08:15] excluded.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; By what law? Of works. Nay, but by the
[1:08:20] law of faith. Therefore, we conclude
[1:08:23] that a man is justified by faith without
[1:08:27] the deeds of the law.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Samuel, what are you saying? I'm
[1:08:31] saying quit trying to clean yourself up
[1:08:34] and believe the word.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; You don't hold the ability to clean your
[1:08:40] own life.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; But you must have faith in the blood
[1:08:44] that was shed for you. The just shall
[1:08:47] live by faith.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Oh, that's a very
[1:08:54] elementary scripture. No, it's not.
[1:08:56] You're living right here. You're
[1:08:58] justified by your faith in your
[1:09:00] sacrifice and you are resting in him.
[1:09:03] You're not resting in your own works
[1:09:05] because no doubt through this building
[1:09:07] every one of us have failed him. Not
[1:09:09] just even this week but even maybe this
[1:09:11] morning.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Maybe you got upset at a Sunday driver
[1:09:15] in front of you.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? You're
[1:09:21] not justified by your works.
[1:09:24] Stop allowing the enemy to try to take
[1:09:27] away from the blood of Jesus Christ. You
[1:09:30] stand there. I am justified by his
[1:09:33] blood.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Brethren, this blood's got power in it.
[1:09:41] [Applause]
[1:09:42] I like how it said this righteousness
[1:09:45] that Paul would write of is neither an
[1:09:48] attribute of God, not the changed nature
[1:09:50] of the believer, but Christ himself
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; who fully met in ourstead in behalf
[1:09:56] every demand of the law and who it is
[1:09:58] but but the act of God called righteous.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; It's God.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; That's why everything you're approaching
[1:10:07] the word, you don't approach it by your
[1:10:09] own righteousness. That's right.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; You understand why we need the continual
[1:10:13] cleansing of the word.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; You know what it's doing? Because you
[1:10:17] can feel and lower than a skunk. And you
[1:10:20] come to the house of God and you feel
[1:10:21] and the devil's telling you ain't no use
[1:10:23] for you to go. There ain't no reason for
[1:10:24] you to go. And then he'll tell you,
[1:10:25] well, look how many times this and all
[1:10:27] that right there. But you see within
[1:10:29] that, if you look at that and focus on
[1:10:32] that, pretty soon that voice, you give
[1:10:34] it time in your life. The P Paul said,
[1:10:37] "Do not let your members
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; be instruments to unrighteousness." It
[1:10:44] said, "Do not let unbelief, sin reign."
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Don't let it linger in your life. Bring
[1:10:52] it right to the word.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; It's not about whether or not good you
[1:10:58] are. It's about him who is the
[1:11:00] righteousness of God. Amen.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; This is why Paul would talk about how he
[1:11:08] preached Christ and Christ crucified in
[1:11:11] 1 Corinthians chapter 1. And he would
[1:11:13] bring it on down. You know, you see, you
[1:11:15] see, you know how that there are those
[1:11:17] that that you know at your calling that
[1:11:20] there's many not many wise men and not
[1:11:23] many mighty and not many noble. He
[1:11:25] didn't say there wasn't any. God's got
[1:11:26] to have some wise men, some noble men,
[1:11:29] and some mighty men that are able to
[1:11:31] humble themselves for God to prove and
[1:11:33] say, "You know what? These men were
[1:11:35] great men or or great women or great
[1:11:37] ones, but you know what? They were
[1:11:38] willing to humble themselves. They might
[1:11:40] have been a rocket scientist, but they
[1:11:42] were able to humble themselves and
[1:11:44] believe the word through a man who maybe
[1:11:46] couldn't even pronounce his ABCs. They
[1:11:48] were able to recognize God." Amen.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; In other words, lay aside their earthly
[1:11:54] wisdom when they came to church.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Lay aside their earthly wisdom and say,
[1:12:00] "I'm here under the table of the Lord,
[1:12:02] and I'm here to receive from that
[1:12:05] heavenly wisdom."
[1:12:06] [Applause]
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; But Paul let us know that within that,
[1:12:10] you know, you God's chosen foolish
[1:12:12] things of the world.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; God's chosen base things, weak things.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. We not we need to be
[1:12:19] able to fellowship around the word. God
[1:12:21] allowed this to be and it was purposeful
[1:12:24] so that God would be able to display
[1:12:27] himself through our lives. This is why
[1:12:30] Paul said that no flesh should glory in
[1:12:32] his presence. But of him are you in
[1:12:36] Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us
[1:12:40] wisdom,
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; righteousness, sanctification,
[1:12:44] redemption, that according as it is
[1:12:46] written, he that glorieth, let him glory
[1:12:50] in the Lord.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Now Paul, you know, Paul rightfully so
[1:12:56] divides this. And Paul, remember, he
[1:12:58] lays this down not only through in the
[1:13:00] Corinthian church, but even all the way
[1:13:03] through the book of Hebrews. And Paul
[1:13:05] was letting it know that the letter,
[1:13:09] but the spirit giveth life. Now
[1:13:11] remember, Paul never took away and said,
[1:13:13] "Well, the law ain't no good." But
[1:13:15] remember, when the Holy Spirit is come,
[1:13:18] it is the righteousness of the law.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; It is the life of the law. And Paul says
[1:13:26] that there was a ministration that was
[1:13:29] given there even on Mount Si. What what
[1:13:33] what was righteous about it? Because it
[1:13:35] was according even to God's own nature.
[1:13:37] But now since and through the offering
[1:13:40] of the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus and
[1:13:43] the coming of the Holy Spirit,
[1:13:45] witnessing back to you that we we have
[1:13:49] now been made righteousness because he
[1:13:53] who knew no sin became our sin.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; And Paul is echoing now that this is a
[1:14:00] this is a righteousness that is
[1:14:03] exceedingly
[1:14:05] great.
[1:14:06] In other words, you can't box it up just
[1:14:09] in your little circle.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; You can't just box it up here. It's an
[1:14:13] exceeding righteousness. And neither can
[1:14:16] you limit it just to one time, one
[1:14:18] event, one part in your life. The
[1:14:21] righteousness of God. It began a
[1:14:23] catching away in your life. And it will
[1:14:26] culminate with the very change of the
[1:14:28] body. Glory to God.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Catching us all the way there to the to
[1:14:32] the meeting in the air to the to the
[1:14:34] wedding supper. Catching us all the way
[1:14:36] here coming back down in the battle of
[1:14:38] Armageddon. Then catching us back away.
[1:14:41] Then he all the way through. It's
[1:14:42] catching us until the righteousness of
[1:14:45] God has come to a complete fulfillment
[1:14:48] and culmination where the heavenly
[1:14:50] Jerusalem it sets upon a redeemed earth.
[1:14:53] It is the culminating of the
[1:14:55] righteousness of God. And there's only
[1:14:57] one thing that you can say is God did it
[1:15:00] and I'm glad I was there while he was
[1:15:02] doing it. I've been a part of it the
[1:15:04] whole time.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Hey, every type in the Bible not only
[1:15:12] spoke of him, but Esther speaks of you.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Rebecca speaks of you.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on now.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; So the because you see with this the
[1:15:23] prophet would take it like this. He
[1:15:24] said, "Now the blood, the blood of bulls
[1:15:26] and goats," Paul, you know, picking up
[1:15:28] there from from in Hebrews of Paul
[1:15:30] laying this down over and over and over
[1:15:32] through every chapter working to build
[1:15:35] the faith of the believer in the
[1:15:37] finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:15:40] the present fulfillment of the word.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Now remembering because you know it's
[1:15:46] like the blood of bulls and goats. It it
[1:15:48] covered but it couldn't atone.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; That's right. it it could not bring the
[1:15:52] worshipper fully back in fellowship with
[1:15:55] God whereby we would actually be under
[1:15:58] the blood. And I'm talking about were
[1:16:00] they under the blood as far as the
[1:16:02] innocent sacrifice? Yes. Where they
[1:16:04] could have fellowship with God. But now
[1:16:06] when the perfect blood was come and was
[1:16:09] shed. That's why God became flesh that
[1:16:12] he might bring you and I make a way to
[1:16:14] bring you and I unto himself. And let me
[1:16:16] just say it like this. I want you to
[1:16:18] understand this in your mind. It's not
[1:16:20] just about you like coming from the back
[1:16:22] pew or here up here. It there's a part
[1:16:25] of it where we talk about progressing in
[1:16:27] the tabernacle of the Lord. But I want
[1:16:29] you to remember you are the temple of
[1:16:31] God.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; So actually what it is, it's not it's
[1:16:35] not so much you coming from here and
[1:16:37] traversing all the way back there or
[1:16:39] whatever, but it's actually the Holy
[1:16:41] Spirit, the blood of God that's moving
[1:16:44] deeper in your life.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. and moves to the place of the
[1:16:48] soulise,
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; right? And he meets you first in your
[1:16:51] mind. The prophet said, "The altar's in
[1:16:53] your mind.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Altar's in your heart." You meet him
[1:16:56] there. You know exactly where you're
[1:16:57] wrong. They they were convicted. They
[1:16:58] were pricricked in their hearts. Right
[1:16:59] there at the altar here. You confess
[1:17:01] your sins. But what made what made you
[1:17:04] do what you did, the thing is still
[1:17:06] there. What happens? The blood. It must
[1:17:08] come deeper in our life to do what?
[1:17:10] Sanctify. Set our mind in order for
[1:17:13] holiness.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:16] cleansing or cleansing out of our life.
[1:17:18] And then what must happen? The blood
[1:17:20] must come deeper into that of the new
[1:17:22] birth of the soul where it changes the
[1:17:24] very nature and now raises up that son
[1:17:27] and daughter of God where you're no
[1:17:28] longer a potential but now it's a
[1:17:31] reality living through your life.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; The blood has to go deeper.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Now this is why that when the blood of
[1:17:42] bulls and goats they could never get the
[1:17:43] stain out completely. You know, I don't
[1:17:45] know about you, but I' i've had some
[1:17:46] shirts and don't look up here to see if
[1:17:49] this is one.
[1:17:51] I've had some mainly been sometimes, you
[1:17:54] know, it's shirts and and you don't
[1:17:56] realize when a stain has come and or you
[1:17:59] do, but you forgot about it,
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Am I the only human here like that?
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Instead of carrying ink pens, we carry
[1:18:07] Tide pens now.
[1:18:10] But you w you wash it and then you know
[1:18:12] as soon as you dry it,
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; it's what they call it sets in there,
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; And that stain becomes a memory of
[1:18:21] something you did,
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; You got that in that dress shirt. Oh, I
[1:18:28] don't know where I was at. Right here.
[1:18:29] Let me see what date was that.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; That's how the blood of bulls and goats
[1:18:37] was. Yeah.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; The prophet said it never could fully
[1:18:40] get the stain out. There was still a
[1:18:41] trace of it.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; But when the blood of Jesus was shed,
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; brother, it had within it the power to
[1:18:50] get between the worshipper and the sin
[1:18:53] and the desire. Cuz that's what it
[1:18:55] really was to release the worshipper
[1:18:58] from the desire. That's the power of the
[1:19:00] bleach of Jesus Christ.
[1:19:04] That's why the prophet when he would
[1:19:05] take that message God hiding in
[1:19:07] simplicity. Let me just tell you
[1:19:08] something. This message was not man
[1:19:11] trying to figure out things to preach.
[1:19:12] These are divine announcements
[1:19:15] orchestrated and placed by a sovereign
[1:19:18] God. It holds a message. Peace after
[1:19:21] peace after peace after peace all
[1:19:23] together. And there he points to you and
[1:19:25] I that this blood, this bleach that has
[1:19:28] come that when sin is confessed,
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; it's placed in the blood of Jesus
[1:19:36] Christ,
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Satan will try to bring it up in your
[1:19:42] memory, but you've got to stand there
[1:19:44] that I have met God's requirements. I
[1:19:46] confess my sin. How do I know that it
[1:19:48] was a real confession? My heart agrees
[1:19:51] with it. I abore that sin. I detest that
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; and I've turned away from it.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; I know. I know. I know. You think,
[1:20:06] "Well, yeah, Brother Samuel, this is
[1:20:07] back down, you know, and and
[1:20:09] kindergarten 101." It ain't kindergarten
[1:20:11] 101.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Let me just tell you something. In order
[1:20:14] for God to continue to work in your
[1:20:16] life, because in our lives, there's
[1:20:18] things that can accumulate.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; That's right. The prophet, God allowed
[1:20:22] the prophet to be transparent to show
[1:20:25] you and I how things can accumulate in a
[1:20:28] person's life.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; And it isn't that the prophet went out
[1:20:31] in the world for them to accumulate.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; That complex that he dealt with, it
[1:20:37] didn't come after the seals. It was
[1:20:39] already in progress.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; One of the greatest events that was
[1:20:44] taking place. Come on. It didn't just
[1:20:45] happen three months later. It was
[1:20:47] already in progress. Yeah,
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; but he had to come to a place and God
[1:20:51] brought him to a place to a showdown to
[1:20:54] where he could see the direction he was
[1:20:56] going and bring him to a confession.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful for God's grace?
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; This is why friends is continually in
[1:21:07] our lives. That's why the devil would
[1:21:08] love to keep get channels all plugged
[1:21:10] up. He'd like to throw rocks down into
[1:21:12] the wells of Abraham.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; You know why? He cannot do away with
[1:21:17] those wells our father dug.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; He can't do away with the channels that
[1:21:22] God has through your life, but he would
[1:21:23] like to clog them up.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Come on. What was one of them called?
[1:21:28] Bitterness.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Dysfellowship.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; You know what it was finally? Then when
[1:21:32] Isaac went, Isaac said, "We don't need a
[1:21:34] new message,
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; We need to go back to the wells that our
[1:21:38] father dug and clean out the wells."
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; They had to get down in there and clear
[1:21:44] out rocks.
[1:21:46] You know what rocks are? Confessions.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; Things that they were saying that wasn't
[1:21:51] even according to God's word.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; And it had to be cleaned out of their
[1:21:55] life. Let me ask you something. What
[1:21:57] could bring you and I into a place to
[1:21:59] examine our lives to where it needs to
[1:22:01] be outside of the living word of God.
[1:22:04] And God ain't going to go out here and
[1:22:05] say, "Well, I'll take somebody else.
[1:22:07] I'll take an Eleazar for my heir." God
[1:22:09] said, "You are my heir. You are my son
[1:22:12] and daughter. But Lord, how can it be?
[1:22:14] Lord, I make so many mistakes in my
[1:22:16] life. How can I possibly be the bride of
[1:22:18] Jesus Christ? But God, let you and I see
[1:22:21] that the whales that I laid in your
[1:22:23] life, the the channels that I've laid
[1:22:25] there, I laid those channels, even your
[1:22:28] weaknesses, that you might surrender
[1:22:30] them, that I might pour myself into
[1:22:33] those channels and use myself
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; through your life.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; So I say, Lord, give us grace to get
[1:22:42] down the well.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:49] All of a sudden, you see this rock
[1:22:51] coming. What's going cleaning up?
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Getting cleaned up.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Throwing rocks out. Why? There's water
[1:22:58] beneath here.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost didn't stop. The Holy
[1:23:02] Ghost didn't cease. The Holy Ghost is
[1:23:04] just as strong and as powerful as it
[1:23:07] ever was.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; But we've got to clean out the wells.
[1:23:10] Amen.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; So good.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; Notice the prophet says it like this in
[1:23:18] the token message. He said the blood
[1:23:20] cleanses. The spirit is a token that the
[1:23:22] blood has been applied. And the spirit
[1:23:26] is the token that the blood has been
[1:23:27] applied. And until the blood is applied,
[1:23:31] the spirit cannot come. But when the
[1:23:34] blood is applied, then the spirit is a
[1:23:37] token sending it back to you that your
[1:23:41] faith in the blood has been accepted.
[1:23:44] Your fair is paid.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Your fair is paid. It's all over. The
[1:23:48] case is closed. You're a Christian.
[1:23:50] You're a believer. Christ in you and
[1:23:52] you're in Christ.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Now, notice, you see, when God God's
[1:23:57] sending a word in this hour, he is that
[1:24:00] word.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? He is the way. And
[1:24:03] let me tell you why God sent this
[1:24:05] message. Now you know do do you know to
[1:24:07] to others and and people can say oh my
[1:24:10] this is this is so hard and this is so
[1:24:12] difficult. I in one way I understand
[1:24:14] because I was there one time.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; I was there one time even born and
[1:24:19] raised in a message church and I thought
[1:24:21] I thought that it was about what I could
[1:24:23] do.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; And let me just tell you buddy I've been
[1:24:27] mustered up strength a lot of times. But
[1:24:29] you know what? After a while, miss meal
[1:24:31] cramps hit.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; The mana became rotten.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Now, the Holy Ghost never rots.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; But what that speaks of is if it's not
[1:24:41] in the predestinated place
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; of the golden armor of the soul.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; It can wither.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; Our lives can just, you understand,
[1:24:53] friends. That's why not only, listen to
[1:24:55] me now. This is why we must have the
[1:24:58] true baptism of the Holy Ghost within
[1:25:00] our soul.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Because even when in our spirits we get
[1:25:03] weary, there is an anchor that holds us.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Even when you don't feel, but there's an
[1:25:09] anchor that moves you on.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; There is a hold that's in your life that
[1:25:15] is greater because let's just be honest.
[1:25:16] There's times as things even in our
[1:25:19] spirit. You look what a wonderful
[1:25:20] service this is so far. everything that
[1:25:22] God is doing, even the service on
[1:25:24] Thursday night. But you know what I'm
[1:25:26] talking about? How Satan would like to
[1:25:28] come and try to steal the what God has
[1:25:30] done in your life. And you know what
[1:25:32] he's trying to do? He's trying even to
[1:25:34] get things just put a little damper over
[1:25:36] it. Just try to get you covered over.
[1:25:37] You understand? Do you realize when the
[1:25:39] devil sees you getting into the service,
[1:25:41] let me just tell you, you want to
[1:25:43] welcome the anointing of the Holy
[1:25:44] Spirit, start agreeing with the word.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Start amening. You're not amening,
[1:25:49] Brother Samuel.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; No, no, no. Don't don't even think that
[1:25:52] you're amening the word. You got to be
[1:25:54] deeper to see. It's beyond brother
[1:25:56] Samuel. It's amening the word.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; When you begin to agree with the word of
[1:26:01] God, what happens? It invites the
[1:26:03] anointing of the Holy Spirit to come
[1:26:06] into this meeting to come to your life
[1:26:08] and bring change.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; He's here
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; and we invite him in.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Lord, they constrained him. Don't move
[1:26:19] on.
[1:26:20] Hallelujah.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; But you watch how the enemy
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; will also try to work in a meeting.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Cuz remember
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; when God called for the sons of God to
[1:26:30] come, Job,
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet said in question
[1:26:34] answer Holy Ghost, he said Satan's in
[1:26:35] every meeting,
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; right? I know we, you know, we make the
[1:26:40] expressions, open the door and let him
[1:26:41] out. Well, that's true.
[1:26:43] But you know what? He'll still the the
[1:26:45] the devil's this kind of guy. You kick
[1:26:47] him out this door, he'll be back at the
[1:26:48] front door.
[1:26:50] kick him out that door. He'll come in
[1:26:51] the back door. You know what he's trying
[1:26:52] to do? This is why he sees you start
[1:26:54] enjoying the word of God and then he'll
[1:26:56] try to put something over your life to
[1:26:58] try to condemn you and try to point out
[1:27:00] why you're not worthy. That's the very
[1:27:02] moment that you need to rise in the
[1:27:04] righteousness of God and say, "Lord,
[1:27:07] your word is true. My thoughts are a
[1:27:09] lie." Those thoughts that are coming,
[1:27:11] it's a lie. What's he trying to do? Put
[1:27:13] a damper on you. And what is that damper
[1:27:15] about? It's trying to break faith.
[1:27:25] Hallelujah. The blood cleanses.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to think of this in this
[1:27:31] manner. What is the blood and how do I
[1:27:33] apply it? I know it's very simple. What
[1:27:35] is the blood and how do I apply it?
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Now, we know that there's no literal
[1:27:40] blood. That all went back down into the
[1:27:43] ground. So Paul, when Paul would write
[1:27:45] all the way down through the the the
[1:27:48] Hebrews and and bringing this about and
[1:27:50] so putting it in in in in in order is to
[1:27:55] let us see that the blood itself was
[1:27:58] shed. And now that the blood has been
[1:28:01] shed, it was with the purpose to bring
[1:28:03] cleansing that the spirit of God might
[1:28:07] call to the worshipper and say, "Hey,
[1:28:10] come on under the blood." G
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; that the spirit might call and say
[1:28:14] there's room for us all.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; That the spirit might call and say,
[1:28:18] "Come get under the blood."
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Now, when we look at this, notice Paul
[1:28:26] in Hebrews 12, I'm not going to read all
[1:28:28] of this, but some of these places I'm
[1:28:30] just going to have to like a stone
[1:28:31] hitting water here this morning on this.
[1:28:34] And I don't want to necessarily just
[1:28:35] bounce around, but you know, you pray
[1:28:37] and I'll pray and let's let God just
[1:28:39] kind of lead us. I'm I'm just going to
[1:28:40] be a little bit longer, but I want you I
[1:28:42] want to just hit what God sees as
[1:28:43] necessary for this meeting. So within
[1:28:46] this, when we look at this, Paul was
[1:28:48] very clear. Remember through the book of
[1:28:50] Hebrews, when you even if you listen to
[1:28:52] brother Brandham preach the Hebrew
[1:28:53] series, brother Brandham so he so deals
[1:28:56] with that spirit of Armenianism
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; that comes in there. I don't want to say
[1:29:00] spirit of Armenianism because there is a
[1:29:01] spirit that goes with it, but he deals
[1:29:03] with that whole thing that's based on
[1:29:04] your works and what you think you can do
[1:29:06] and this. And he also brings the true
[1:29:08] reality of God's grace. Remember Calvin
[1:29:11] had truth but it went on a limb.
[1:29:12] Armenian had truth but it went on a
[1:29:13] limb. But you bring it back together is
[1:29:15] where God's grace comes. His elective
[1:29:17] grace. You see it. You accept it. And
[1:29:19] then what does it do? It produces the
[1:29:21] works of the word in your life.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; So it's not about what I'm doing to be
[1:29:26] accepted. It's me receiving by grace and
[1:29:29] recognizing I've already been accepted
[1:29:31] in the beloved.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me now? That's what the
[1:29:35] Holy Spirit is calling us to. It's an
[1:29:37] accepting. It's the acceptance of what
[1:29:39] he has done. Now, notice this. Paul lets
[1:29:41] them know in Hebrews 12, you've not come
[1:29:43] to Mount Zion where it's, you know, it's
[1:29:45] darkness and burning and and the
[1:29:47] thunderings and the lightnings and
[1:29:48] everything that's come to there. You've
[1:29:50] not come to that place that brings that
[1:29:52] of a of of a fear to where you would
[1:29:54] say, "Let God let let Moses speak and
[1:29:57] not God to where that they turn down the
[1:30:00] sovereign grace of God of God's desire
[1:30:02] for relationship in their life." But
[1:30:05] notice they even in they they could not
[1:30:07] be able to come even to the place that
[1:30:10] God was calling them to. And and it also
[1:30:12] goes to show how many times brother Ram
[1:30:14] says he says it just goes to show that
[1:30:16] man always wants something to do in it.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Right? Adam and Eve, they made their own
[1:30:21] selves uh you know coverings and and
[1:30:23] walked out in the presence of God. on
[1:30:25] and on and on and finally here comes a
[1:30:27] man by the name and all the way yes down
[1:30:30] through the ages where you have an able
[1:30:32] who can accept he he brings what God's
[1:30:34] provided away and it goes clear all the
[1:30:36] way coming to a time in Genesis 22 where
[1:30:40] Abraham is walking on the mountain with
[1:30:43] with with a Isaac his son and he knows
[1:30:46] that his son is what God has asked him
[1:30:49] to offer up to give it all and when he
[1:30:52] gets there he does not know how it's
[1:30:54] going to happen. But he knows that I and
[1:30:57] the lad are going to come again and
[1:30:59] worship. You know what Abraham is
[1:31:01] expressing then? He's expressing that
[1:31:03] the the the authority of the
[1:31:06] resurrection in the heart of a believer.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Because when he came there on Mount
[1:31:12] Mariah, remember it was a moment of
[1:31:15] complete surrender of everything that
[1:31:18] Abraham loved. God tests lives and
[1:31:22] brings us to a place to where are you
[1:31:24] willing to satis settle and surrender
[1:31:27] everything in your life?
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Now listen to me. Please don't limit
[1:31:32] Genesis 22 to just the new birth.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Because if you limit Genesis 22 to the
[1:31:38] new birth, where do you have the
[1:31:39] adoption?
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Abraham's faith grew
[1:31:43] the whole time. But yet God seen that
[1:31:46] same faith in Abraham before we could
[1:31:48] ever see it. I wonder if we'd have been
[1:31:50] sitting in the church and we saw
[1:31:51] Abraham. We only saw him come so far as
[1:31:53] Shin are.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Wonder if we wouldn't have been quote
[1:31:57] balling him.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; You got to be separated. What's true? I
[1:31:59] mean, but there's a way to express that.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Sometimes the way to express that is not
[1:32:03] to go quote, but you be the living
[1:32:05] quote.
[1:32:06] [Applause]
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? We don't need a lot
[1:32:09] of shellacking of quotes and shellacking
[1:32:11] of scripture. You need to be the living
[1:32:13] word. You need to be God with skin on
[1:32:15] it.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Hallelujah.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; So here Abraham's life faith was growing
[1:32:20] the whole time. But then it comes into
[1:32:22] that place on Mount Mariah where he's
[1:32:25] offered up. He absolutely has not only
[1:32:28] tied up Isaac, but his hand is up. And
[1:32:31] remember Isaac said, "I see the wood. I
[1:32:34] see the altar, but where's the
[1:32:35] sacrifice?"
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; And Abraham said out of the depth of his
[1:32:41] heart, "The Lord
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; will provide."
[1:32:44] [Applause]
[1:32:46] Let me say this to you. Who has provided
[1:32:49] that you could surrender your all to
[1:32:51] him?
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Who's done that? He's done that.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; The prophet says at the end of the token
[1:32:59] message, he said, "You're the 11th hour
[1:33:01] worker. You're the 11th hour people."
[1:33:03] And he said, "You wouldn't have come
[1:33:04] here to receive the Holy Ghost." He
[1:33:06] said, "You wouldn't have done that
[1:33:07] humanly speaking, but God told you to
[1:33:09] get up and come get it."
[1:33:11] [Applause]
[1:33:11] [Music]
[1:33:13] What happened? God overrode the cloud,
[1:33:16] the darkness, the stoniness,
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; the living presence of the living God.
[1:33:21] Not a God of not the Mount Horeb
[1:33:24] experience, but the Mount Zion
[1:33:27] experience where the living God who gave
[1:33:30] the commandments is able to come in and
[1:33:32] rewrite your story.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; He's able to come in and rewrite the
[1:33:36] nature in your life. He's able to so
[1:33:38] divinely place his word into our hearts.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; Don't you love him?
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; So you've not come to Mount Zion. Let me
[1:33:47] get to this then. Just go right to the
[1:33:49] end. You've not come to You've not come
[1:33:51] unto Mount Zion. And to Jesus. Notice
[1:33:54] here. This is what you've come to. To
[1:33:56] Jesus, the mediator of the new covenant
[1:33:59] and to the blood of sprinkling. You know
[1:34:01] what a How many know what a mediator is?
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Mediator does. They They sat down
[1:34:05] between two parties. When I first got
[1:34:06] into teaching, very first year in
[1:34:08] teaching, we had a strike.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; I'll be honest with you, I felt like I
[1:34:14] thought I was going to cross the picket.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Why? Hey, listen. Even on my teacher
[1:34:18] salon, we were we were just getting by.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm looking at it. I know what they
[1:34:22] say can happen if you cross picket lines
[1:34:24] and everything else, but let me just get
[1:34:25] to this point. They brought in
[1:34:27] mediators. You know what people was?
[1:34:28] Neutral parties.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; Parties that could take all of the the
[1:34:32] teachers that was demanding this. And
[1:34:34] then you had the superintendent this and
[1:34:37] somebody that can be the go-between.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, there was no man
[1:34:41] worthy.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; But God came down, Paul would say,
[1:34:47] through the man Christ Jesus.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; He is the mediator of a new covenant. He
[1:34:53] You understand what this means? He's not
[1:34:55] here to to proclaim you're guilty.
[1:34:58] You're guilty. You're guilty. You can
[1:35:00] never do it. You can never do it. But
[1:35:02] he's here to proclaim his righteousness
[1:35:06] that I am your sin offering. I am your
[1:35:09] burnt offering. I am your way of
[1:35:11] consecration. I am the unleaven bread. I
[1:35:14] am the Holy Ghost. I am all that you
[1:35:17] have need of. I am the all of it.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; Many titles, lily of the valley, prince
[1:35:22] of peace, but he is the all of it.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Who are we talking about? Jesus Christ.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:30] That is so good.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; To the spud sprinkling that speaketh
[1:35:35] better things than that of Abel.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; I want to say, look at this. The Bible
[1:35:42] said even in Hebrews 12:25, "See that
[1:35:45] you refuse not him that speaketh." Now
[1:35:47] watch how Paul would write this. Paul
[1:35:49] declares this blood has got a voice.
[1:35:52] This blood is still speaking. Are you
[1:35:54] with me now? Stay with me. He's he's
[1:35:56] declaring that. You see when we come
[1:35:58] over here then we come back in looking
[1:36:01] at the place of this. Well, who is it
[1:36:03] that's doing the speaking? The Bible
[1:36:05] said right over Paul takes us in Hebrews
[1:36:07] chapter 1 and verse one as he comes
[1:36:09] through there. God, just stay with me.
[1:36:11] God who at sunra time trans and in diver
[1:36:13] manner spake in times past unto the
[1:36:15] fathers by the prophets in the prophets
[1:36:17] hath in these last days spoken unto us
[1:36:20] by his son whom he hath appointed heir
[1:36:23] of all things by whom also he made the
[1:36:26] worlds.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Now listen, you've got to think deeper
[1:36:29] than just by his son and that being a
[1:36:31] flesh body.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. The fle remember the flesh was
[1:36:38] not God but it was the but it was the
[1:36:40] flesh of God.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? It was it was that a
[1:36:45] flesh that God had created apart from
[1:36:48] human instrumentality. A blood cell that
[1:36:52] did not God didn't borrow one iota from
[1:36:54] Mary.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; He didn't look at system and say well
[1:36:58] this is a pretty good thing and this is
[1:37:00] a pretty good thing. God said I don't
[1:37:01] want a hybrid bride.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't want her mix with this and
[1:37:05] mix with that and mix with this. We
[1:37:07] ain't trying to bring a brew. We're
[1:37:09] trying to to present the cleansing power
[1:37:12] of the blood of Jesus Christ that it
[1:37:15] still remains the same. It still can
[1:37:17] take a heart and cleanse that heart so
[1:37:20] completely till God himself can come
[1:37:22] down and live through that vessel.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; By whom also he made the world. Who did
[1:37:29] he make the worlds? Ephesians 2. He made
[1:37:32] all things by Jesus Christ.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; Now, we're talking about the logos, the
[1:37:37] pillar of fire,
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; the word. Right.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Right. He will lead completely to the
[1:37:41] achievement of God's purpose, who being
[1:37:43] the brightness of his glory. This is
[1:37:45] right at the express image of his person
[1:37:47] and upholding all things by the word of
[1:37:50] his power. Can we read that green part
[1:37:52] together? Upholding all things by the
[1:37:55] word of his power. When he had by
[1:37:58] himself,
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; somebody say by himself. by himself.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; He didn't need nobody's help.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; He didn't need the eye in si.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? This message did not
[1:38:12] come from that of humanity.
[1:38:16] This message came from the portals of
[1:38:19] glory.
[1:38:21] [Applause]
[1:38:23] That's why Revelations 5 John said, "I
[1:38:26] looked and no man was worthy
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; to take the book,
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; but John weep not
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; there is one. The lamb is worthy."
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; John said, "I looked and beheld a lamb
[1:38:42] as it had been slain."
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; What did John see? He saw he's all that
[1:38:47] I need. Amen.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; He's the end to all of my of all of
[1:38:52] everything in my life. He He is the
[1:38:54] consuming fire. Come on, preach with me
[1:38:56] now.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; What else did John see? When John was
[1:38:59] looking, he kept looking and finally
[1:39:02] John looked long enough till he saw
[1:39:04] himself.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; And that's when he started worshiping.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; The prophet said John looked and said,
[1:39:12] "There's John.
[1:39:15] [Applause]
[1:39:19] Now you wonder why we worship the way we
[1:39:21] do.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Now you may not worship like me, but you
[1:39:24] worship in your own way. You worship,
[1:39:26] you know how you know, you know, a
[1:39:27] powerful way to worship is even through
[1:39:29] the day. You might be going through your
[1:39:30] house, going through the office, going
[1:39:32] through the factory, and the devil wants
[1:39:34] to try to come your way. But here you
[1:39:35] are in worship, in meditation, and the
[1:39:38] presence of God is abiding right there
[1:39:41] around your life. He always is, whether
[1:39:42] you feel it or not. But there you are
[1:39:44] meditating, welcoming him, welcoming the
[1:39:47] presence of God. Do you realize when you
[1:39:49] walk into the workplace, you are
[1:39:51] ambassadors of the new city, that
[1:39:54] heavenly Jerusalem? Do you realize you
[1:39:56] invite the presence of God? When you
[1:39:59] walk into that nursing home, when you
[1:40:01] walk into that job, you are an
[1:40:03] ambassador. Let me give you the
[1:40:04] prophet's words, delegates,
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; of this new city.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; That's so good. Glory.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; Upholding all things by the word of his
[1:40:15] power. This word upholding means to
[1:40:18] catch away.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; It's God catching you away. Not leaving
[1:40:23] you where you are,
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; but he's catching you away.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; He's loosening the hold of unbelief on
[1:40:30] your life.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; He's loosening holds that have been down
[1:40:35] through our life. Strains
[1:40:37] things about our life.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; That's so true.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Oh my the word. Lord, I'm I'm trying to
[1:40:41] get this. I'm trying to get that. And
[1:40:43] remember, like we said here in the
[1:40:44] beginning part of the service, there's
[1:40:45] many of the things that God finally
[1:40:46] brings us to the realization like he did
[1:40:48] Paul. Paul, my grace is sufficient
[1:40:50] because God will allow certain measures
[1:40:52] of weakness to keep you and I in a place
[1:40:54] of humility where we need to be.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Samuel, I keep myself
[1:40:59] humble. Well, let me just tell you, Paul
[1:41:00] himself, he did that, too. But Paul also
[1:41:03] known by God, God knew I need to give
[1:41:06] him divine help as the messenger of the
[1:41:08] age in order to keep himself humble.
[1:41:10] Paul said, "Lest I should get exalted
[1:41:12] above the revelation that's given to
[1:41:14] me." You see, God is not all about
[1:41:16] what's up here. God wants to see it
[1:41:18] displayed down here. And sometimes in
[1:41:20] order to get it displayed down here, we
[1:41:22] have to be led in the dying like the
[1:41:24] Bible says like that we bear about in
[1:41:26] our body. The dying of the Lord Jesus
[1:41:28] that the life of the Lord Jesus might be
[1:41:30] made manifest also.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; Is that right? By his son. So who is his
[1:41:35] son now? The body already taken away but
[1:41:37] the son he did not create the worlds by
[1:41:39] that flesh body but he created the
[1:41:41] worlds by his son which is the word
[1:41:44] which is himself which is that pillar of
[1:41:47] fire. Yes.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; Now, you with me now? And this is why
[1:41:50] Paul's saying the blood speaks.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me now? Now watch. Paul
[1:41:55] would say it like this. The prophet
[1:41:56] picks it up. He tells us about the
[1:41:58] speaking of the blood. Paul tells us the
[1:42:00] blood speaks. You believe the blood
[1:42:01] speaks. God told Cain, he said, "Where's
[1:42:04] your brother?" His blood, his voice, the
[1:42:06] blood of his voice, the the voice of his
[1:42:08] blood calls out against you. Brother Ram
[1:42:10] goes on to pick up Hebrews 12 where we
[1:42:12] just read, "The blood speaks better
[1:42:14] things. the blood is speaking then the
[1:42:16] blood has got a voice and the voice of
[1:42:19] the blood is the word and that's what
[1:42:22] makes it whether it's right or wrong the
[1:42:24] word is identified by the voice of the
[1:42:28] blood the voice of the blood is the Holy
[1:42:31] Ghost that brings life is life brings
[1:42:34] life to the word and it quickens it amen
[1:42:38] and amen oh look at this blood speaks it
[1:42:41] speaks a better thing
[1:42:45] Brother Samuel, I I don't think I'm
[1:42:47] going to make it. Listen to the voice of
[1:42:49] the blood.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; And the voice of the blood don't say,
[1:42:53] "Oh, you're going to make it." It says,
[1:42:55] "I've already made it for you."
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; You know what you need to do? Get some
[1:43:01] real good spiritual cleaning and clean
[1:43:02] Q-tips and get it cleaned out. Maybe
[1:43:05] you've got things built up so much
[1:43:06] you've been listening to so many other
[1:43:08] things and voices and circumstances of
[1:43:11] life can come our way and can so weigh
[1:43:13] us down. But God has a cleansing way to
[1:43:17] open up our hearing that will absolutely
[1:43:19] release the clogged up channels to where
[1:43:22] we're not hearing the word under a
[1:43:24] condemning voice cuz you're not hearing
[1:43:26] it right if you are. But to hear the
[1:43:28] voice of the blood, the voice of God's
[1:43:30] grace. Sure, it'll bring conviction. Let
[1:43:32] us know you're living beneath your
[1:43:34] privileges. This is where you ought to
[1:43:36] be. And he will call you from your
[1:43:38] unbelief in back into his presence.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; My
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; The blood speaks it speaks a better
[1:43:47] thing. The Old Testament, the blood
[1:43:49] spoke of guilt. In the New Testament, it
[1:43:52] speaks of redemption.
[1:44:00] In the Old Testament, it spoke of death
[1:44:02] and sorrow. In the New Testament, it
[1:44:05] speaks of resurrection and life. It
[1:44:07] speaks of healing. It speaks of joy. It
[1:44:09] speaks of power. It speaks of life. It
[1:44:12] speaks of heaven.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Samuel, I I'm I'm hearing
[1:44:17] this. You know, the devil's telling me
[1:44:19] I'm not a very good Christian. Question
[1:44:20] answer 64. Brother Brham said, if you're
[1:44:22] worried, if your life matches the word,
[1:44:24] dismiss that thought.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Bring that thought
[1:44:31] in subjection. He said, as a matter of
[1:44:33] fact, how he was feeling ill at the
[1:44:34] time, he said, I'm having to bring every
[1:44:36] thought in subjection right now to keep
[1:44:38] from passing out over this podium.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; It's bringing the word bringing
[1:44:44] thoughts, our life in subjection. That's
[1:44:46] where the spirit of God come to bring
[1:44:48] you and I and give us an authority to be
[1:44:51] able to even do that. You know, even
[1:44:53] this quote, watch this. this quote even
[1:44:55] in parenting cuz we recognize even in
[1:44:57] parenting it's just like that in the
[1:44:58] grace of the Lord Jesus Christ does the
[1:45:00] grace and the blood speaking does the
[1:45:02] blood not speak and bring not bring
[1:45:04] correction sure it brings correction but
[1:45:06] it does not leave us or bring us to a
[1:45:08] place to leave us in a dead end to strip
[1:45:11] us as far as to make us feel like a
[1:45:13] piece of trash and that we're nothing.
[1:45:15] That's not what the blood of the new
[1:45:17] covenant does. As a matter of fact, even
[1:45:19] in the old covenant, it pointed out
[1:45:21] guilt, but there was a propitiation that
[1:45:24] was made. But the new the new covenant,
[1:45:27] it not only points out that I am your
[1:45:29] way, but it ministers an encouraging
[1:45:32] overcoming strength to you to press on.
[1:45:36] That you are worthy. You are more than
[1:45:38] able. That I have predestinated you. I
[1:45:41] have justified you. I have glorified
[1:45:43] you. You are already a finished product
[1:45:46] in the mind of almighty God. That
[1:45:49] picture has already been placed on the
[1:45:51] family album. You were chosen before him
[1:45:54] in love and God is calling you back
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; to that right there.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; This is why he ministers the nutrients
[1:46:05] that need to be ministered to our life.
[1:46:07] Like a woman who is expectant and she
[1:46:10] has certain cravings in her life. God
[1:46:12] knows the cravings in your life and what
[1:46:14] it would take not only to bring the new
[1:46:16] birth but to bring you beyond
[1:46:18] circumstances in life. God knows the
[1:46:21] cravings that are in your life. Lord, I
[1:46:23] want to live, Lord God, a more
[1:46:24] victorious life, Lord. I want to be more
[1:46:26] like you. And God knows those cravings.
[1:46:28] Why? You're a part of him. And so God
[1:46:31] supplies what's needed. The nutrients,
[1:46:33] the vitamins, all of those things. And
[1:46:35] you get these cravings. And what you're
[1:46:37] craving for? Your craving is for more of
[1:46:39] him. Lord, I want more of you. And what
[1:46:41] does he do? He ministers those things so
[1:46:43] that you and I might become more like
[1:46:45] him.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; You love him. Amen.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, to think of this because you know as
[1:46:52] do do we have to correct our children?
[1:46:53] We do. But when you correct your
[1:46:55] children, you just don't leave them
[1:46:56] right where they're at. You just don't
[1:46:57] try. That's why Paul said, "Fathers, do
[1:46:59] not provoke them to anger." In other
[1:47:00] words, exasperate them. Take any ounce
[1:47:02] of hope or any encouragement away, but
[1:47:05] correct them. But let them know because
[1:47:06] real correction, the word means
[1:47:08] restoration. It means to point that
[1:47:10] there is a vision concerning your life
[1:47:13] and you're veering off right here that
[1:47:15] God's got a certain vision in the word
[1:47:17] and God is calling you to ascend into
[1:47:19] that part of the word.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; Thank God for those corrections.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; But remember, he encourages us as well.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, he does.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; So, so it's such a fine balance. I
[1:47:30] remember, you know, even in my life, you
[1:47:31] know, as a as a parent. I'm still a
[1:47:33] parent, you know, to me is a wonderful
[1:47:35] privilege that God allowed me to be able
[1:47:36] to have. And I remind myself of that
[1:47:38] once in a while, but it's a wonderful
[1:47:40] privilege that God allowed me to have
[1:47:42] and to be able to, you know, because we
[1:47:44] go through hard things, right? We go
[1:47:46] through things and and sometimes
[1:47:48] difficult situations and sometimes you
[1:47:50] may be repeating the same things and
[1:47:52] trying to encourage in the same way and
[1:47:54] other things. Because everyone every one
[1:47:56] of your children are different. You
[1:47:57] can't take one of your children and say,
[1:47:58] "Well, I tell you what, what I did with
[1:48:00] him, I'm going to go to the other." No,
[1:48:01] that ain't how it works. Cuz that ain't
[1:48:02] how God works with you and I. The Bible
[1:48:04] said he knows his sheep by name. Knows
[1:48:06] every one of our characteristics. He
[1:48:08] never compromises his life or his
[1:48:10] nature, but he knows how to apply
[1:48:12] himself to every one of our lives that
[1:48:13] we would get it.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; Friends, that's the love of God being
[1:48:17] expressed right there to our lives. So
[1:48:19] how can we expect to be able to relate
[1:48:21] to one another in just a certain way in
[1:48:23] a certain way and a certain thing? God
[1:48:25] knows exactly what you and I have need
[1:48:27] of and he has provided that way.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Now let me tell you what I did. It was
[1:48:32] just just as simply what I did is simply
[1:48:33] what what God has invited every one of
[1:48:35] us. I know sometimes there's things we
[1:48:37] might need to sit down and talk and
[1:48:38] counsel and things like that. But you
[1:48:40] realize everything comes back to
[1:48:41] pointing that you are the one who's
[1:48:43] actually in control. And don't allow the
[1:48:45] devil to diminish anything in your life.
[1:48:47] As a parent, you've got authority. As a
[1:48:49] parent, you may not see the way. I've
[1:48:50] been standing right there when I did not
[1:48:52] see the answers. How do I approach this?
[1:48:54] How do I approach that? How do I apply
[1:48:55] it like this? How do I do that? But, you
[1:48:57] know, waiting on God. And if you're
[1:48:59] really praying and waiting on God, then
[1:49:00] you become sensitive and God can speak
[1:49:03] through you through any channel and you
[1:49:05] will recognize him speaking.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, you will.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; That is so true.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; And you know what? Through all of that,
[1:49:12] working through all of that with your
[1:49:14] children, it's not actually a hindrance.
[1:49:16] It's actually God molding and shaping
[1:49:17] you.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Same thing a husband and wife and things
[1:49:22] like that. Oh, I tell you if I had this.
[1:49:23] No, no, no. Remember, God allows those
[1:49:25] things even in the coming together. You
[1:49:27] know what temper you and I put us into a
[1:49:29] place to realize that you know what?
[1:49:30] We're not all that in a bag of chips.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; Nope.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; Nope.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; And you're not you're not the absolute.
[1:49:37] You're not all right.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; God's got two flawed human beings
[1:49:41] together.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. And God
[1:49:44] didn't call one flawed human being to
[1:49:46] fix another.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; If he did, he would have did that in
[1:49:49] instead of sending the Lord Jesus.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; But you know what God wants? He wants to
[1:49:53] be Jesus through you.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Come on. Even in our even in our
[1:49:57] marriage, will you surrender your hands?
[1:49:58] Will you surrender your feet, tongue,
[1:50:00] mouth, mind? Will you just surrender?
[1:50:02] Say, "Lord, I surrender myself to you."
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; You know what that is? That's that wave
[1:50:06] offering.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; Lord, I surrender my all to you.
[1:50:10] So the voice of this blood, let me just
[1:50:12] try to I'm skipping here, but let me
[1:50:14] just bring it down to this moment. The
[1:50:17] simplicity of applying
[1:50:19] this blood
[1:50:22] is through faith.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; The Bible tells us in the book of Exodus
[1:50:28] when God showing this in Egypt,
[1:50:32] take the lamb, take unto you a lamb for
[1:50:36] the household.
[1:50:38] They were to take that lamb.
[1:50:41] They were identified with that lamb.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; They slayed that lamb.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Took the blood. They took all of the
[1:50:50] parts of the lamb, all the pertinence
[1:50:53] thereof and things like that. Listen,
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; they had to eat it all.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; Let me just make this very simple in
[1:51:00] case you don't understand.
[1:51:02] There's parts, no doubt, from setting in
[1:51:04] here that some of us like about the pig
[1:51:07] and others of us don't like.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; There's some things I've told brothers,
[1:51:12] I'll never eat that.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; I don't care how you disguise it.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; There's certain things when it comes to
[1:51:22] cows, there's certain, you know, certain
[1:51:24] cuts of meat, right?
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; Certain cuts of steak.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; Right. You like that? But God, with this
[1:51:30] lamb, it wasn't about what cut we like.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; Lord, I'll take the chops.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; Lord, I prefer my brother. I'll just
[1:51:37] take them. Lord, I'll take the chops.
[1:51:39] But God said, you got to eat it all.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; Not just the parts that you like, but I
[1:51:44] wonder some of those parts they were
[1:51:45] probably eating. They probably were
[1:51:46] like,
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; you know, that that brings it when we do
[1:51:51] it like that, it brings it from us
[1:51:52] thinking in a Disney way.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. I hope we're not even
[1:51:56] thinking in a Disney way nowadays.
[1:51:58] Right.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; But it brings it from just thinking that
[1:52:00] everything was just,
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; oh, this was such a wonderful
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; There's parts about the word that I'll
[1:52:07] tell you what that I don't even enjoy
[1:52:08] preaching.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; Cuz you know what? It's cutting.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; It's cutting. And it ain't just cutting
[1:52:15] here, but all through the week it's
[1:52:18] cutting. And it's not just cutting, but
[1:52:19] you continue. Lord, did I did I say it
[1:52:21] right? Lord, was it right? Lord, maybe I
[1:52:23] was too this. And you're going through.
[1:52:24] Then there's other parts of the word.
[1:52:25] Man, you love preaching. You love
[1:52:26] preaching the chops.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Woo! Glory to God.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; But you know what? When we can just have
[1:52:32] it seasoned just right, there's there's
[1:52:34] really When we can have it seasoned just
[1:52:36] right, we might be able to say, "Oh my,
[1:52:38] here come the pertinance. Ouch. Oh me."
[1:52:41] But Lord, thank you for your word, Lord.
[1:52:43] Thank you, Lord, for speaking, Lord, to
[1:52:45] the depths of my life. Thank you, Lord.
[1:52:47] Oh, that Oh, that cut. Oh, man. That
[1:52:49] that hurts. That's like pouring in
[1:52:51] peroxide to the wound and it's isn't up.
[1:52:53] You know, you're want the drawback, but
[1:52:55] it's something. It's ministering and you
[1:52:57] realize it has what it needs within that
[1:52:59] word to do what? Get between you
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; and that sin and that unbelief.
[1:53:05] [Music]
[1:53:05] [Applause]
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; And that blood, they couldn't just set
[1:53:10] that blood over there.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; They couldn't even set the blood out
[1:53:14] there and say, "Let's talk about it."
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; Man, ain't this blood? Ain't this
[1:53:19] something? They had to apply it. Yes.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Now, listen things, friends.
[1:53:27] Brother Brandon put it down in such a
[1:53:28] place like this. I got to read this
[1:53:30] quote to you. I know I don't have to. I
[1:53:31] could refer to it, but you know, I I
[1:53:33] just like to say it just in the ways
[1:53:35] that the prophet would say it. I trust
[1:53:37] it's okay.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham said, "The blood tonight
[1:53:41] is applied by simple faith.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; Not something supernatural. It's right
[1:53:47] around you everywhere. Just simply like
[1:53:49] a child, reach out and get a hold of it
[1:53:51] and apply the blood. The hissup is just
[1:53:54] a simple childlike faith for the
[1:53:57] believer. It isn't something out of your
[1:54:00] reach. You don't have to reach very far
[1:54:03] to get it.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; God brought the blood to you.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; That chemical blood went back down into
[1:54:14] the cell. It went back into the
[1:54:16] nutrients. But the spirit, the voice of
[1:54:19] the blood, the Holy Ghost has come to
[1:54:22] announce that Jubilee is on. You are
[1:54:25] free. The righteousness of God has made
[1:54:29] you free.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; And God brought this message.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; Not to bring us in fellowship around the
[1:54:39] chemical. He brought the message to
[1:54:43] bring us under the blood itself like it
[1:54:47] was given on the day of Pentecost.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; That God would bring a people back like
[1:54:52] it was on the day of Pentecost to where
[1:54:55] now a people that he has built and
[1:54:58] brought forth a tabernacle of holiness
[1:55:01] for his name's sake. A people that could
[1:55:03] come fully under the bride that have
[1:55:05] been built word on top of word on top of
[1:55:07] word on top of word on top of word from
[1:55:09] faith and virtue and knowledge and
[1:55:11] temperance been built all the way up to
[1:55:13] where it has become now Christ being
[1:55:16] manifested in a bride body to take her
[1:55:19] away and rapture.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; Simple faith. Yes.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; You know how simple it was?
[1:55:33] Rahab heard what God was doing.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; And when those spies,
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask you something. How did
[1:55:42] she know who they were?
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; Let's preach this a little bit.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; How did she know who they were? They
[1:55:50] weren't They didn't have on Israelite
[1:55:52] garb. They would have stood out like a
[1:55:55] sore thumb.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; Come on. garb itself. We use it as a
[1:55:58] slang, but it's not a slang term.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; The prophet talked about what he saw in
[1:56:02] the vision. Each one was in their own
[1:56:04] nationality garb.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? So now when they
[1:56:08] walked in, what was it?
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; She was she received there was a witness
[1:56:12] that came and she received. A matter of
[1:56:14] fact, she she recognizing and something
[1:56:18] within her. You say, "What was that?" I
[1:56:19] I'm going ask you the same question.
[1:56:21] What was it that told Abraham there's
[1:56:23] something different about these men
[1:56:24] walking down right now? Yeah, there you
[1:56:26] go.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said he knew there was
[1:56:28] something. He said cuz he was spiritual.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Sam, I wasn't even in
[1:56:32] church. You don't have to be in church
[1:56:34] to be spiritual.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; To be spiritual is to recognize God
[1:56:38] dealing with your life.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; And then coming into a place to where
[1:56:42] you become spiritfilled. Then you become
[1:56:44] spiritual to recognize God's word above
[1:56:47] everything else.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; You put God's word above prophecy or
[1:56:52] anything. You put God's word, God's word
[1:56:54] is above everything. Why? Cuz Jesus
[1:56:56] Christ has been exalted to the highest
[1:56:57] position in the church.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm talking about?
[1:57:03] Now, I don't want to go in get into
[1:57:05] examples, but notice here comes here
[1:57:06] comes Rahab. She brings in these spies.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; And here's what she tells him.
[1:57:13] You're not getting out of here till you
[1:57:14] give me a true token.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; I don't want a feeling.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; I don't want a sensation.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; I want a true token.
[1:57:23] I want something that will bring a peace
[1:57:25] and a settleness and a confidence that I
[1:57:28] know that I know that I know.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; She said, "That's what I want." How
[1:57:34] could she ask for that? It's because it
[1:57:36] was available.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; You couldn't have a craving for the Holy
[1:57:41] Ghost if it wasn't available.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; You couldn't even have a desire to be
[1:57:47] free if there wasn't freedom. Amen.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; There is a place. There is a way. And
[1:57:56] that is in Jesus Christ.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; She says, "You're not going back out the
[1:58:10] door you came.
[1:58:12] They're looking for you,
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; but you're going to escape through this
[1:58:16] window." Yeah.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; And she tied
[1:58:20] that scarlet cord and let them down.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; When they got down, they told her,
[1:58:28] "This same cord that has brought a way
[1:58:31] of escape for us
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; is the same way of escape for you."
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; What is he letting them know? Oh, I love
[1:58:44] Let me just use the example of the
[1:58:45] prophet said. He said, the prophet said,
[1:58:46] he said, "God's such a faithful father,
[1:58:48] if he gives one of his children ice
[1:58:49] cream, he gives them all ice cream."
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; I like to use that quote when it comes
[1:58:53] to Mitchells.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; But you get what I'm trying to say. We
[1:58:58] have been made joint hes with Christ
[1:59:01] Jesus. God did not represent on on the
[1:59:05] platform night after night in the life
[1:59:08] of the prophet and then hand to you and
[1:59:10] I something that was less than God who
[1:59:13] manifest. He was greater than every
[1:59:16] disease, every circumstance, every
[1:59:19] spirit, every affliction. But God poured
[1:59:22] himself
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; into his church.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; That's what this message come to do. The
[1:59:30] message first had to be identified.
[1:59:32] That's why the prophet said, "The same
[1:59:34] token that's worked among us all these
[1:59:38] years."
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; Now, it's come to the capping of my
[1:59:43] message since all of those seven seals.
[1:59:46] And it's tied up in this one thing that
[1:59:49] we're all right.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; That's what the token came. The token is
[1:59:54] who? The person of Jesus Christ. It's
[1:59:56] the Holy Ghost. The same one that that
[1:59:58] was that moved on the platform night
[2:00:00] after night was the same God that was
[2:00:02] present to bring faith in our lives to
[2:00:05] look beyond circumstances and to accept
[2:00:07] the voice of the blood.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; Stand with me, would you?
[2:00:13] And let me tell you this.
[2:00:20] If you don't want to stand right now,
[2:00:21] you don't have to.
[2:00:24] Don't worry. I'm not going I'm not going
[2:00:25] to be long. Let me give you this last
[2:00:28] example.
[2:00:32] They came out of Egypt.
[2:00:35] The task masters that had always made
[2:00:37] them do what they did was still alive.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; They went for a few days
[2:00:48] and them task masters was still
[2:00:51] they came after him. finally had enough
[2:00:52] said
[2:00:54] they ain't getting out of my grip
[2:00:57] and they came after him.
[2:01:00] Now what happened when they start when
[2:01:02] when that happened? Israel saw
[2:01:06] and heard them the rumble.
[2:01:09] And that rumble, it scared them.
[2:01:13] They look back and said, "Oh, dear God,
[2:01:14] we're going to die.
[2:01:16] We're going to we got to go back into
[2:01:18] that."
[2:01:21] But Moses stood there with the word. Now
[2:01:22] I want you to listen to me. Here was a
[2:01:25] man
[2:01:27] that was standing under the blood of
[2:01:29] bulls and goats.
[2:01:32] And the blood of bulls and goats could
[2:01:34] so bring a man to a place to where he
[2:01:38] could speak
[2:01:40] and say, "Stand still.
[2:01:43] Fear not."
[2:01:46] The blood of God could move down into
[2:01:48] such the blood of bulls and goats could
[2:01:50] so clean a man to that place to where it
[2:01:53] could become a voice. You say, "How do I
[2:01:55] know that was God's voice?" Look at what
[2:01:57] happened.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; Not only did they come out of Egypt, but
[2:02:00] here they are standing be before an
[2:02:02] opposition that says, "You ain't going
[2:02:04] no further. I've got you trapped. I've
[2:02:08] got you hemmed in." Remember how it says
[2:02:10] in Ten Commandments thing, you old
[2:02:12] Brener says, "Their god is a poor
[2:02:14] general." Brother Brandham refers back
[2:02:16] to that, you know, in the message
[2:02:17] speaking
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; and has them all hemmed in.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; But watch this. The humanity part's
[2:02:24] still there to where when Moses goes to
[2:02:26] God, you don't ever read about Moses
[2:02:28] crying, but God says, "Why are you
[2:02:30] crying unto me?"
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says, "Isn't that just like
[2:02:34] us
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; humans?"
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; There's times where, oh my, here you
[2:02:39] are. You're standing and yes, yes, yes,
[2:02:41] and here you are. But yet there's still
[2:02:42] that part that would try to rise up to
[2:02:45] doubt.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; Sure. But let me just tell you that
[2:02:51] doubt is not you.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; It's not. But here comes the voice of
[2:03:00] God
[2:03:01] and he says, "Fear not.
[2:03:04] Stand still and you shall see the
[2:03:07] salvation of the Lord."
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:10] Notice he didn't tell them that they
[2:03:12] themselves that it was something that
[2:03:14] they were going to have to do, but he
[2:03:16] said fear not. Fear is the worst thing.
[2:03:19] How many knows what I'm talking about?
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; Brother says if he said if you had
[2:03:22] cancer but didn't fear, he said you'd be
[2:03:24] better off than if you just had fear.
[2:03:27] Because what does fear do? It works to
[2:03:28] hinder paralyze.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; Right? Fear. But notice, stand still
[2:03:37] and see the salvation of the Lord. God
[2:03:40] wants them to see
[2:03:43] what he's going to do. The salvation of
[2:03:45] the Lord
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; for the Egyptians
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; whom you have seen today. Now, God
[2:03:51] didn't say they ain't there.
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; They're right there. But those that
[2:03:56] you've seen today, you ain't going to
[2:03:57] see them no more.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; Well, what's going to happen? the
[2:04:02] salvation of the Lord.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; Well, what am I gonna have to do? Stand
[2:04:06] still and see it.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; Stand still. Look away to Jesus.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; The Lord shall fight for you and you
[2:04:18] shall hold your peace.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; Can I read you a couple quotes?
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; Let me get down here.
[2:04:35] Brother Brandham, if I could just quit
[2:04:38] smoking, if I could just lay down
[2:04:41] drinking, if I could just quit my
[2:04:43] stealing, if I could just quit my doing
[2:04:46] this, that, and the other, don't weary.
[2:04:49] Just walk on, God will take care of the
[2:04:52] rest of it.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; If I know I could do it, Brother
[2:04:56] Brandham, I'd accept Christ right now.
[2:04:58] Don't you worry. Move on. Just go on,
[2:05:02] you'll see the salvation
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; of the Lord.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says every believer when
[2:05:10] you come in and are saved except the
[2:05:12] blood of Jesus. You still how to you
[2:05:14] still try to hang on to this and hang on
[2:05:16] to that. You can't give this up and you
[2:05:17] can't give that up. After a while, God
[2:05:19] may do things for you, but you can't
[2:05:21] give up your cigarettes. You can't give
[2:05:23] up your sociable drink with the fellas
[2:05:24] now and then. But what you need is to
[2:05:28] pass through
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; the Red Sea.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; Well, how do I know what the Red Sea is?
[2:05:36] Because God's not asking you and I to go
[2:05:37] back to Palestine,
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; He's not asking us to go back over into
[2:05:41] that area. That that that was a type,
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; We can't even find the actual literal
[2:05:49] blood of the Lord Jesus. That's not what
[2:05:52] he's talking about.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; So, what is he talking about?
[2:05:56] is coming under the spirit of God
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; which is the voice of the blood and
[2:06:03] allow
[2:06:04] the word where Jesus says sanctify them
[2:06:08] through thy word
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; thy word is truth
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; it's God cleansing
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; yes it is
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; God cleansing away
[2:06:19] from us all of these things and friends
[2:06:22] it's a lot deeper than just cigarettes
[2:06:24] and smoking Listen, we can go through a
[2:06:26] whole a whole list, but I'm not worried
[2:06:27] about a whole list. The whole point of
[2:06:30] passing through the blood of Jesus
[2:06:32] Christ,
[2:06:34] God even in this hour would reflect
[2:06:36] through his prophet what that pathway
[2:06:40] is.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram tells us, he said that that
[2:06:43] star actually reflects Jesus Christ back
[2:06:46] out into the labor so the people can
[2:06:49] pass through that of the labor, the sea
[2:06:52] of glass, the Red Sea.
[2:06:54] and come out on the other side. That's
[2:06:56] what God that's why he sent this message
[2:06:58] is to reveal the way that had been
[2:07:01] closed up.
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; The way that had been hidden, God didn't
[2:07:06] open a new way.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; The opening of this word is not to not
[2:07:09] to bring a a new way. Oh, this is a new
[2:07:11] way. It ain't a new way.
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, when many say, "Oh,
[2:07:15] you know what, brother Brand, I'm on
[2:07:16] this." Brother Brandham's not the one
[2:07:17] who came up with holiness.
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; This is a restoration message.
[2:07:22] That's right.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Many of the things you
[2:07:26] can read in some of the the the look way
[2:07:28] on back in the rabbitical studies and
[2:07:30] things like that. And even with Paul,
[2:07:32] Paul believed in serpent seed,
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; These weren't new truths. They had
[2:07:37] become hidden. You know, it's kind of
[2:07:39] like something you put on your coffee
[2:07:40] table. I don't know if you all have a
[2:07:41] coffee table like that or not, but we've
[2:07:42] got a we've got a we've got a pretty
[2:07:44] good size coffee table. Josh made it for
[2:07:46] us. It and and it's got, you know, I've
[2:07:48] got books there of Brother Generations
[2:07:49] book, The Messenger. We got Bibles there
[2:07:51] and we've got, you know, different
[2:07:52] books, Prince of the House of David and
[2:07:53] all those things and church age book and
[2:07:55] all that's there. And you know what?
[2:07:56] Sometimes as it gets to a place, finally
[2:07:58] my wife says, she starts taking things
[2:08:00] out and guess where they end up? My
[2:08:03] office.
[2:08:06] [Laughter]
[2:08:08] You know what happens? It's kind of like
[2:08:10] on in even in our life sometimes things
[2:08:13] can kind of start getting put
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; on top of one another.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; And things start getting out of place.
[2:08:19] So,
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; right.
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; And you know what has to happen? We have
[2:08:23] to clear out
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; and get back down to what's really
[2:08:25] important.
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; And it isn't that you mean to cover
[2:08:28] things up. It didn't mean, did you mean
[2:08:29] to do that at all? But it happens.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; But aren't you glad there's a cleansing?
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; And it's not just to cleanse you. It's
[2:08:36] not just to cleanse you from all of our
[2:08:38] our our our, you know, the the failures
[2:08:40] and faults. And let me just say this to
[2:08:42] you. If you ever think you're going to
[2:08:43] live a life that's beyond mistakes,
[2:08:44] that's that's not. You'll never do that.
[2:08:46] But maturity is beginning to recognize
[2:08:48] more and more your humanity
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; and beginning to recognize that to rest
[2:08:52] on the God who lives on the inside of
[2:08:54] you.
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; So the spirit of God just passing
[2:08:59] through that of the Red Sea, let me tell
[2:09:00] you what passing through the Red Sea
[2:09:02] will do. It won't just do away with, you
[2:09:03] know, all those things we listed,
[2:09:05] cigarettes and all this stuff. It'll do
[2:09:06] away with religious spirits.
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, it will.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; It'll consume religious spirits.
[2:09:11] Remember friends, the prophet told us
[2:09:13] over and over, religious spirit is the
[2:09:14] worst spirit. of all.
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; You know what a religious spirit is?
[2:09:19] It's a spirit that comes into a
[2:09:20] sanctified vessel.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; When the unclean spirit
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; goes out, Brother Bam said he wasn't
[2:09:27] even cast out.
[2:09:29] He just left
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; on his own accord. And when he left on
[2:09:33] his own accord, that place never got
[2:09:35] filled. And because it never got filled,
[2:09:38] finally it said, "I'm going to go back
[2:09:40] and return back to my house
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; with seven others. Right.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; I'm going to completely
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; take it.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; That's a rel and prophet tell ties that
[2:09:49] in to the church ages.
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; He ties it in all. He said that
[2:09:52] religious spirit it's worse than
[2:09:54] anything else.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; Because you know what a religious spirit
[2:09:58] you can't tell a religious spirit
[2:10:00] nothing.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; Nothing. It can't be led.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; Can't be taught.
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; Doesn't it's it's religious.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; You know what religious is? It's a
[2:10:12] covering.
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; How to think how that Satan would would
[2:10:17] try to hand out a substitute to cover
[2:10:19] this, cover that. But friends, isn't it
[2:10:21] wonderful that God not only would speak
[2:10:24] to our hearts, but invite you and I into
[2:10:26] a place to say, "I'm your covering.
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; I'm your all sufficiency.
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; You don't have to walk around with your
[2:10:32] chest out because you've had 10 days
[2:10:34] straight and they have been good days
[2:10:38] and then have one bad day and you walk
[2:10:39] around like this." I know. I know. I
[2:10:41] know. Some some are melancholy. You
[2:10:43] battle against that, but God didn't
[2:10:44] strip that melancholy away. He just
[2:10:46] gives you grace to rule over it.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; That is so true.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; And you recognize it and bring it in
[2:10:50] subjection. You want to see great
[2:10:52] miracles. That's a great miracle right
[2:10:53] there.
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; Because you could walk on the water, but
[2:10:56] the water ain't going in a rapture. But
[2:10:58] God's taken that character in a rapture.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; And God through the voice of the blood,
[2:11:02] it has given you the strength to
[2:11:03] overcome even in your own life and walk
[2:11:06] as a true believer. Don't you love him?
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; To free us even from the guilt
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; so that we can continue to approach him.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; I'm glad for this washing of water by
[2:11:18] the word.
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; Aren't you?
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; And who this word is? It's our husband.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; I say, Lord God, wash me.
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; Wash me.
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; Like Peter said, Lord, wash, wash all of
[2:11:29] me. Jesus said, you don't need to be
[2:11:31] washed all over again. It's not born
[2:11:32] again again and again and again. But
[2:11:34] once you have been made clean, You need
[2:11:37] not wash, save your hands and feet only.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. So once we've been
[2:11:45] washed, but then what happens through
[2:11:46] that of the blood, the word, we're
[2:11:48] sitting under the word. And what does
[2:11:49] the word do? It's cleansing. It's
[2:11:51] washing us.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; What's it doing? It's making us ready
[2:11:54] for worship.
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Samuel, we're already at
[2:11:58] the end of the service. Oh, please don't
[2:11:59] think worship is confined to these
[2:12:01] walls.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; When you walk holy, holy, holy to the
[2:12:05] Lord. That's worship.
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; You living above sin. That's worship.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; I know. I know we raise our hands. We're
[2:12:12] here. You know, we shout and all that,
[2:12:14] but you know what real worship is?
[2:12:15] Living above sin.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; You can worship. Just begin to think
[2:12:19] about the goodness of God and what God
[2:12:21] has brought you from, what he's done in
[2:12:23] your life, and the joy of the Lord
[2:12:24] that's right there in your soul rises up
[2:12:26] to say, "I don't even know how I'm going
[2:12:28] to make it through the day, but I know
[2:12:30] in whom I have believed. Hallelujah.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; I don't know what tomorrow holds, but I
[2:12:35] know who holds tomorrow and my life is
[2:12:38] in his hands.
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; So with that in mind,
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; the simplicity
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; of applying the blood,
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; accepting, don't wrestle with it.
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; Listen, all of this that God has given
[2:12:52] us, don't wrestle with it. Pass through
[2:12:54] it
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; by faith. Take that. No matter where
[2:12:58] you're at in your life, no matter where
[2:13:00] you're at in your journey, I think
[2:13:01] sometimes that's one of the greatest
[2:13:02] things that can actually be a hindrance
[2:13:04] to us is we can sit around and classify
[2:13:05] a message. Well, that's justification.
[2:13:07] That's sanctification. Listen, every
[2:13:08] word of God that's preached, I need it.
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; What if God would have sent the message
[2:13:14] of the hour and said, "I don't need to
[2:13:15] preach justification. Luther already did
[2:13:17] that." God brought justification to a
[2:13:19] greater depth than Luther ever did.
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; Justified as though you never did it in
[2:13:25] the first place. That's right.
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; You know what that justification did? It
[2:13:29] didn't just take us to Calvary. It took
[2:13:30] us clear back to the mind of God.
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; That's where you never did it in the
[2:13:34] first place.
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; See, the word just keeps working deeper
[2:13:37] and deeper and deeper and deeper. Don't
[2:13:38] you love him?
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; Say, Lord, all of me.
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; All of me, Lord.
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; All of me.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; Want to take that of that of that that
[2:13:49] ram, the breast of the ram, the unleaven
[2:13:50] bread, the cake of oil, and Lord God,
[2:13:52] wave it before you. It's actually waving
[2:13:54] our lives. Lord, with the word, Lord,
[2:13:57] consume me. Take all of me, Lord. Take
[2:14:00] all of my life. Notice why it was
[2:14:02] applied. It wasn't applied to the toe
[2:14:04] first,
[2:14:06] then to the thumb, then to the ear. It's
[2:14:08] first applied to the ear. Faith cometh
[2:14:10] by hearing. Then what happens? As you
[2:14:14] hear it and accept it, you begin to act
[2:14:16] on it.
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; And you're acting on it with right hand.
[2:14:19] You're acting on it by the authority and
[2:14:21] the power of the one who has spoke to
[2:14:24] you and allowed you to hear.
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; And as you begin to yield to that right
[2:14:29] there, then what happens? It begins to
[2:14:32] show itself in your walk. That's why the
[2:14:35] brother Bram says when you have been
[2:14:37] saved, you confess that you are saved.
[2:14:41] When you and you believe that God has
[2:14:42] healed you, you've been prayed for,
[2:14:44] confess it. And he said, "You watch."
[2:14:46] He's the high priest
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; of our confession. And he says, "As you
[2:14:52] confess it, he will make your body
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; obey your confession."
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[2:15:05] Glory be to God.
[2:15:10] Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father,
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; Lord, you're mindful of every need.
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father, for your mercies here
[2:15:18] this morning. Once again, Lord God, may
[2:15:21] you just, Lord, bring it together, Lord.
[2:15:24] Even Lord, with that which has been
[2:15:26] spoken, Lord, for every heart and every
[2:15:29] life, Lord, for every one of us, Lord
[2:15:32] Jesus, we want to be more like you,
[2:15:36] Lord God, in every in every one of our
[2:15:37] lives. I'm sure we can test, Lord. I
[2:15:39] know I can. I want to go deeper, Lord. I
[2:15:43] want to go deeper in you,
[2:15:45] Lord. Hearts and lives through this
[2:15:48] building, in this gathering. I pray this
[2:15:50] morning that Lord God, that may Lord,
[2:15:53] their faith or may it be faith that has
[2:15:55] been granted from you to look beyond
[2:16:00] what they can do.
[2:16:02] Lord, how that the enemy is such an
[2:16:04] accuser. He wants to so belittle the
[2:16:08] children of God. Wants to Lord put us
[2:16:13] seem to put people back in a corner.
[2:16:17] You can't do this. You can't do that.
[2:16:18] But Lord, may they look and see you. I
[2:16:21] trust that Lord God even right here this
[2:16:23] morning that Lord God that they've been
[2:16:27] able to see you. See what you've done
[2:16:30] for them. Lord God to be able to lift
[2:16:33] them beyond even the circumstances
[2:16:36] beyond the boundaries Lord and Father
[2:16:40] grace that is sufficient to carry them
[2:16:43] beyond any barrier in their life. Your
[2:16:47] prophet would talk about that sound
[2:16:48] barrier that when that plane would get
[2:16:50] so close to it, it would start shaking
[2:16:53] it. It was like that plane was going to
[2:16:55] blow apart because it was close to that
[2:16:58] threshold of the sound barrier.
[2:17:01] [Music]
[2:17:03] But once it got beyond that sound
[2:17:04] barrier, it was smooth sailing after
[2:17:08] that.
[2:17:09] Lord Jesus,
[2:17:11] we know that we have, Lord, tests and
[2:17:13] there's trials.
[2:17:15] But Father, there's a strength that has
[2:17:18] come within our lives, Lord, from going
[2:17:20] beyond the camp. It's more than just the
[2:17:23] camp of ideas. It's actually Lord God
[2:17:26] when you would lead us outside of the
[2:17:28] camp of denominations
[2:17:31] and we realize Lord that it isn't always
[2:17:33] had to be that we've had to go outside
[2:17:35] of the camp of some name here or there.
[2:17:37] Sometimes it's just been things that's
[2:17:38] been right among us. But the real real
[2:17:41] camp that we've got to go beyond is the
[2:17:44] camp of our own self.
[2:17:47] That's our biggest enemy.
[2:17:51] Lord God, may we, Lord, as the scripture
[2:17:53] said, go forth unto him
[2:17:57] who's without the camp. Oh, I'm so glad,
[2:18:00] Lord God, you made a way. It's this this
[2:18:04] word is not a limited word. It's not
[2:18:06] limited in power. It's the blood is not
[2:18:09] limited in what it can do. That's why
[2:18:11] Lord, when you brought this word, it's a
[2:18:14] restoring and opening of that that
[2:18:17] pathway that has already been available.
[2:18:20] That's what this message did. It
[2:18:22] revealed Jesus Christ to be the same
[2:18:25] yesterday, today, and forever. That
[2:18:28] there's no limits on the blood. Doesn't
[2:18:30] matter what your father, mother did, or
[2:18:32] what strain lays down through your
[2:18:34] family. It don't matter.
[2:18:36] The blood
[2:18:38] speaks better things.
[2:18:41] Oh God, here this morning,
[2:18:45] Lord Jesus, as we just want to lift,
[2:18:48] Lord, our lives aresh to you.
[2:18:52] Oh God, grant it. Lord, I pray this
[2:18:54] morning,
[2:18:55] may you minister, Lord God, to every one
[2:18:58] of our hearts.
[2:19:01] Minister, Lord God, I pray. Continue,
[2:19:04] Lord.
[2:19:06] God, Lord, hear this morning. strength
[2:19:08] just moving right on through that of the
[2:19:10] Red Sea to see it that you're our way,
[2:19:12] Lord. Lord, I commit this congregation,
[2:19:15] I commit each one, Lord, into your
[2:19:17] hands. And I pray, Father,
[2:19:21] may they walk on
[2:19:24] right through the way that's been
[2:19:26] provided for you are the way, the truth,
[2:19:29] and the life.
[2:19:32] Grant it, we pray in the name of the
[2:19:34] Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:19:37] Amen. Could we just worship him in just
[2:19:38] a few moments? Go ahead.
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; Take me deeper
[2:19:46] and deeper in love
[2:19:49] with you.
[2:19:51] And Jesus, hold me close in your
[2:19:55] embrace.
[2:19:59] Take me deeper.
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; Deeper than I've ever been. Yes, Lord
[2:20:06] God.
[2:20:07] &gt;&gt; I just want to love you more and more.
[2:20:12] How I long
[2:20:14] to be deeper
[2:20:16] in love.
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; Lord, take me deeper
[2:20:24] and deeper in love
[2:20:26] with you.
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; Jesus, hold me close to your embrace.
[2:20:36] Oh, take me deeper,
[2:20:40] deeper than I've ever been before. Lord,
[2:20:45] I just want to love you more and more.
[2:20:49] How I long
[2:20:51] to be deeper in love.
[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; Take me deeper. Take me deeper,
[2:21:01] &gt;&gt; Lord. Deeper in love. Yes, Lord God.
[2:21:06] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, hold me close to your
[2:21:10] embrace.
[2:21:11] [Music]
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; Lord, take me deeper
[2:21:17] and deeper than I've ever been.
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord God. Yes,
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; I just want to love you more and more.
[2:21:26] How I long to be deeper in love.
[2:21:33] Oh, take me deeper.
[2:21:37] Oh, deeper in love.
[2:21:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord God. Yes, Father. Lord Jesus,

[2:39:45] washed by the water.
[2:39:48] Oh, I'm washed by the water of the word.
[2:39:54] Oh, it's like being born again with a
[2:39:58] whole new life to live and never having
[2:40:01] to go back to what you've been.
[2:40:05] Oh, for according to the Lord, you just
[2:40:09] started your existence. And as far as
[2:40:12] he's concerned, there never was no sin.
[2:40:16] For when God looks your way, he no
[2:40:20] longer sees a sinner, but a saint cru
[2:40:23] and washes white as snow.
[2:40:27] It's not by anything that you done, but

[2:41:01] It's like how it is not to have one
[2:41:05] guilty feeling, not to wonder where
[2:41:08] you're going when you die.
[2:41:12] We're not afraid of the past and nor
[2:41:15] afraid of what tomorrow holds in store
[2:41:19] and know the reason why.
[2:41:22] Oh, for that's just how it is when you
[2:41:26] go down in the water. For by faith you
[2:41:30] believe in what you were.
[2:41:33] It's no impossible dream you can start
[2:41:37] over clean.
[2:41:39] Oh, when you're washed by the water of

[2:42:07] I began born again with a whole new life
[2:42:11] to live in, never having to look back to
[2:42:14] what you've been. Well, it's for
[2:42:17] according to the Lord. You just started
[2:42:21] your existence. And as far as he's
[2:42:23] concerned, there never was no sin.
[2:42:28] When God looks away, he no longer sees a
[2:42:32] sinner but a saint who's washes white as
[2:42:36] snow.
[2:42:38] It's so impossible.
[2:42:40] You can't
[2:42:43] God's own son and I'm washed by the
[2:42:47] water of the word.
[2:42:50] Oh, I'm wash. Oh yes, I'm washed.
[2:42:54] Oh, by the water. Oh, I'm washed by the
[2:42:57] water of the word. Oh, I'm wash.

[2:43:08] water. Oh, I'm wash. Are you washed?

[2:43:18] water of the word.

[2:43:30] the word.

[2:43:37] word.
