[43:12] your Bibles with me to Isaiah
[43:14] 53 amen it's so good to be gathered
[43:19] together and
[43:22] uh just want to just just take a little
[43:26] thought here tonight just a little
[43:28] something the Lord just dealing with my
[43:30] heart here this
[43:32] afternoon and actually was going to go
[43:35] continue with our series but I just just
[43:38] felt in my heart just to take this
[43:41] little thought here
[43:43] tonight and I want to read through
[43:45] Isaiah
[43:46] 53 and verse
[43:48] one we know that we're coming up here
[43:51] we're in a time of the Easter season and
[43:54] we realize that to us it's a great uh a
[43:58] memorial and we are truly benefactors of
[44:01] his
[44:02] resurrection but if there had not been a
[44:05] Calvary there would not be any
[44:08] resurrection and so Calvary itself is is
[44:11] sufficient amen that's where every debt
[44:13] where the sin question was settled and
[44:16] so we just want to take a reading here
[44:19] tonight and thinking of that in Isaiah
[44:22] 53:1 who hath believed our report and to
[44:26] whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for
[44:29] he shall grow up before him as a tender
[44:32] plant and as a root out of dry ground he
[44:36] hath no form nor comeliness and when we
[44:38] shall see him there is no beauty that we
[44:41] should desire him he is despised and
[44:44] rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and
[44:48] acquainted with grief and we hid as it
[44:50] were our faces from him he was despised
[44:54] and we esteemed him not surely he hath
[44:58] borne our griefs and carried our sorrows
[45:02] yet we did esteem him stricken smitten
[45:05] of God and Afflicted but he was wounded
[45:08] for our
[45:09] transgressions he was bruised for our
[45:12] iniquities and the chastisement of our
[45:15] peace was upon him and with his stripes
[45:19] we are healed and all we like sheep have
[45:22] gone astray we have turned everyone to
[45:25] his own way and the Lord Lord hath laid
[45:27] on him the iniquity of us all he was
[45:31] oppressed and he was afflicted yet he
[45:34] opened not his mouth he is brought as a
[45:37] lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep
[45:39] before her shears is dumb so he opened
[45:42] not his mouth he was taken from prison
[45:45] and from judgment and who shall declare
[45:47] his generation for he was cut off out of
[45:50] the land of the living for the
[45:52] transgression of my people was he
[45:54] stricken and he made his grave
[45:57] with the wicked and with the rich in his
[46:00] death because he had done no violence
[46:02] neither was any deceit in his mouth yet
[46:06] it pleased the Lord to bruise him he
[46:09] hath put him to grief and when thou
[46:11] shalt make his soul an offering for sin
[46:14] he shall see his seed he shall prolong
[46:17] his days and the pleasure of the Lord
[46:19] shall prosper in his hand he shall see
[46:22] of the travail of his soul and shall be
[46:25] satisfied and by his knowledge shall my
[46:28] righteous servant justify many for he
[46:31] shall bear their iniquities therefore
[46:35] will I divide him a portion with the
[46:37] great and he shall divide the spoil with
[46:39] the strong because he hath poured out
[46:42] his soul unto death and he was numbered
[46:44] with the transgressors and he bare the
[46:47] sin of many and made intercession for
[46:50] the
[46:52] transgressors amen amen may God bless
[46:55] you bless the reading of the word as
[46:57] you're being
[46:59] seated I want to um just take a a few
[47:04] moments here I think the prayer request
[47:06] was given uh regarding of my Aunt Linda
[47:09] she you know we had special prayer for
[47:11] her on um sister Linda cavil as you know
[47:14] her uh she we had a special prayer for
[47:17] her here on Sunday and uh she was taken
[47:20] to the hospital there on early Saturday
[47:22] morning and um she uh
[47:27] um there was some things that even the
[47:29] other the other day when they went they
[47:31] had to put uh an emerg they had to put a
[47:34] a temporary port in for uh emergency
[47:37] kidney dialysis and uh so because the
[47:41] the blood pressure and all of that was
[47:42] real real low when they took her in and
[47:44] the toxins none of that was even uh
[47:46] being alleviated from her system so they
[47:48] were going to have to do that and uh
[47:50] when they went in to put that temporary
[47:52] port in um uh just there uh the other
[47:56] day day um when they went in to do that
[47:59] on on Wednesday they realized there was
[48:02] internal bleeding they didn't know where
[48:03] that was at and so they by the grace of
[48:07] God they found that real early this
[48:09] morning where that was at and they were
[48:11] able to uh get that cauterized get it
[48:13] stopped and uh so I right now I haven't
[48:17] heard any word whether they've been able
[48:19] to actually go in and do the uh dialysis
[48:22] that needed to to be done but we thank
[48:24] God for his mercy and where he has
[48:26] brought her to thus far and uh just as I
[48:30] mentioned there to her daughter my my my
[48:33] cousin and I told him I said you know
[48:35] God is in full control uh you know we're
[48:38] we're certainly looking to the Lord and
[48:40] uh you know uh as we were just praying
[48:43] and just holding her up before the
[48:45] Throne of God among many other needs
[48:47] that we know that are present in the
[48:49] assembly but I just ask that you just
[48:51] continue to keep her in prayer and then
[48:53] as we find out more we'll allow you to
[48:55] know I was actually going to go there
[48:57] today again but uh you know how it is
[49:00] when if they are in a process of maybe
[49:02] doing dialysis or not if they get to
[49:04] going on that then you kind of locked
[49:06] out for four to six hours there so uh we
[49:09] just I know that one thing that whether
[49:11] I'm there or not that the prayers will
[49:12] make it and so uh we I did take her
[49:16] greetings from everyone and told her
[49:18] said we're praying for you and we we
[49:20] miss you and uh we're just standing with
[49:22] you and and all of it and so um I got
[49:26] her to smile a little bit and talk to
[49:28] her and uh so it just just want to hold
[49:32] her up in prayer and I know there's many
[49:34] other needs as well uh sometimes in our
[49:36] minds and our lives there's so many
[49:38] needs and sometimes you know if you're
[49:40] like me you can become overwhelmed with
[49:42] the needs uh that that are all around
[49:45] and um but you know as I told you before
[49:48] one thing I've learned to do is to as it
[49:50] comes to me I pray uh whether I'm in
[49:53] here in a time of prayer or whether I've
[49:56] already that's already uh taking place
[49:58] if I'm driving in the car and somebody's
[50:00] name comes to me or the situation comes
[50:02] to my mind amen otherwise I'd have to
[50:04] walk around with a notebook and I I
[50:07] don't I could do that uh I tried to do
[50:10] that actually before when I have prayed
[50:11] and that isn't to me doesn't fit me too
[50:14] well so I'm just found just to be just
[50:16] to yield to him and and he he knows what
[50:19] we have need of so I believe that is
[50:21] what God would direct for each of us
[50:23] just to we're in mind we're a body and
[50:26] we pray one for another God knows the
[50:28] needs that we have I want to just take a
[50:31] thought out of this text here tonight I
[50:34] uh just just really pressing on my heart
[50:36] here early this afternoon on just to
[50:39] speak on the cost uh we're coming into a
[50:42] moment we know that uh and as it is laid
[50:45] out that tomorrow what is called Good
[50:47] Friday that there is the crucifixion and
[50:51] to look at that and I want to just take
[50:53] from that on and looking at the the part
[50:57] of of the cost and what it cost for us
[51:00] the cost of what it was for God to love
[51:03] me the cost of what it is you know and
[51:06] so when brother bham starts out with
[51:08] this I this message really stands out to
[51:10] me here the cruelty of sin and the
[51:12] penalty that it cost to rid Sin from our
[51:15] lives he said we're always happy when it
[51:17] comes to having the joy of the Lord in
[51:19] our midst and that's true isn't it we
[51:21] like the joy of the Lord and how I
[51:24] Rejoice with you greatly but did you
[51:25] ever stop to think think what it cost to
[51:28] have it did you ever realize just the
[51:30] price that's behind it and what judgment
[51:33] was and what the penalty of sin and how
[51:35] cruel sin must be when it caused the Son
[51:38] of God to go to Calvary and God would
[51:41] strike him and turn his face from him
[51:44] and smite him and he be afflicted look
[51:47] who he was how many know the scripture
[51:49] says he who knew no sin became sin not
[51:54] became sinful he became sin
[51:57] for what reason that we might be made
[52:01] the very righteousness of God in Christ
[52:05] he was willing to become that brother
[52:07] Bram goes on in the latter part of that
[52:09] message it says God in he says in prayer
[52:11] may every individual here go home
[52:13] tonight with this on their mind thinking
[52:16] of what a sacrifice what did it cost to
[52:20] redeem what did it cost God it never
[52:24] cost us nothing but it cost God his son
[52:27] it cost God the greatest Price it cost
[52:30] Christ his life he was the rose of
[52:33] Sharon but to get the Beautiful perfume
[52:36] out of a rose you have to crush it up
[52:38] and his beautiful life was crushed at a
[52:41] young man of 33 and a half years that we
[52:45] might
[52:46] live so that the purpose the cost that
[52:50] went to bring the joy that you and I
[52:54] would have tonight the cost in in order
[52:56] for us to be able to go free and to have
[53:01] the Liberty that we have tonight the
[53:03] cost that even that we even as
[53:06] individuals can come to a place of a
[53:08] real true
[53:10] relationship with almighty God there had
[53:13] to be a cost a price that was paid and
[53:17] you know we we glory in the resurrection
[53:20] and I I am so thankful we you know uh
[53:23] brother Steven will be here to stand in
[53:25] for us on Sunday morning morning and uh
[53:27] whether whether he takes the text out of
[53:29] the Resurrection or not every service
[53:31] and every day is a resurrection to the
[53:34] believer because we recognize that
[53:37] Resurrection is not just confined just
[53:39] to one day or just to one moment but the
[53:42] resurrection itself we we are true
[53:45] benefactors of that Resurrection we Are
[53:48] Witnesses of his resurrection that he is
[53:51] still the same yesterday today and
[53:54] forever but if there had not been a
[53:57] Calvary there would never have been a
[54:00] resurrection amen and in order for there
[54:02] to be a Calvary there had to be one who
[54:05] was willing to pay the price for you and
[54:07] I one who was willing to settle the debt
[54:10] that was against you and I because not
[54:13] there was not a mortal upon the earth
[54:16] that could actually satisfy this
[54:18] requirement for another mortal a lot of
[54:21] good people a lot of good men that no
[54:23] doubt had lived down through time but
[54:26] yet when even when you get to looking at
[54:28] the best man that you could maybe
[54:30] possibly pick every one of them were
[54:33] born in sin and shaped in iniquity and
[54:36] every one of them even to where that
[54:39] Joseph being such a perfect type of
[54:41] Christ he's still had a mark against him
[54:44] because he told a lie in telling them be
[54:47] deceptive and tell them that you are
[54:49] herdsmen and not Shepherds because the
[54:51] Egyptians despised Shepherds he also the
[54:56] prophet would let us know as we've spoke
[54:58] on here in the message a prisoner that
[55:01] Joseph after what God had showed him yet
[55:04] there was still a part that God saw that
[55:07] was too much Joseph in there and God
[55:09] knew he had to get him in position and
[55:11] while God was getting him in position
[55:14] God was also working out in his life
[55:17] every aspect and that even included that
[55:20] little bit of Pride that was still there
[55:23] so even the things as we've looked at
[55:25] the test and the trials and the things
[55:27] that we go through even the things
[55:30] sometimes that we are looking and asking
[55:32] of the Lord that Lord I I would love to
[55:35] see this pass but remember that as its
[55:39] coming and the trials and the things
[55:41] that we're in it's also to mold us to
[55:44] shape us and to lead us to a further
[55:47] death to ourselves that in the midst of
[55:49] it that it would be better and best for
[55:52] us to say is Lord mold Me In This Moment
[55:55] Lord help me gather Lord in this moment
[55:58] while while everything I'm waiting I
[56:01] want to commit all these things into
[56:03] your hands and Lord work on my life what
[56:06] needs to be worked out to where that
[56:08] when that next Junction of time comes
[56:11] I'm not only in position but I'm in
[56:14] position spiritually where I need to be
[56:16] in my life there's a cost that was that
[56:19] was made or that was given and no man
[56:23] could satisfy that cost but notice when
[56:26] we look at this in Isaiah
[56:28] 53:6 the very scripture here in the
[56:31] midst of our reading it says all we like
[56:34] sheep have gone astray here you know
[56:38] when man when the fall uh came Man
[56:41] became a Wonder we recognize that here
[56:45] that you know uh when they were the fall
[56:48] had come and God had had place man
[56:51] outside of the garden even man coming
[56:53] before the presence of God man man came
[56:57] and he brought fig leaves and he had
[56:59] sewed something together and you know
[57:02] how many moments did he walk around with
[57:04] those fig leaves I don't know but I know
[57:07] this that when God's presence came down
[57:09] in the garden that he did not have the
[57:12] confidence with what he had made to
[57:15] stand in the presence of God and so this
[57:18] is where we recognize it's more than
[57:21] religion amen religion is merely a
[57:24] covering but God never came to bring us
[57:27] religion because we've we have to have a
[57:30] confidence the Bible says that there
[57:32] should be a confidence in our life from
[57:34] The Book of John the confidence that
[57:36] would stand here a boldness that we're
[57:39] able to stand right now this moment and
[57:42] have that realization that I am here now
[57:46] as he is there he is the sinless
[57:49] Spotless lamb who was accepted and I am
[57:52] accepted in him and to have that
[57:54] boldness and aom confidence that doesn't
[57:57] mean arrogancy it means a rest that
[58:01] there is a sadl within that if my
[58:05] purpose should be fulfilled within the
[58:07] next few moments I'm not worried I'm not
[58:10] fearful I'm not wondering about where
[58:13] I'm going but there is a subtleness in
[58:15] my heart that I know in whom I have
[58:18] believed and I am persuad that he's able
[58:21] to keep that which I've committed unto
[58:24] him against that day there there was a
[58:27] need for one to come and step forward to
[58:31] pay the price there would have to be one
[58:33] he could not be from this world because
[58:36] this world I'm not talking about the
[58:38] Earth I'm talking about the system on it
[58:41] he could not be here from this world
[58:43] because he could not redeem us
[58:46] everything in this world was polluted
[58:49] but there had to be one who was not
[58:52] sinful one who was not sin that would be
[58:56] able to step forward and redeem you and
[59:00] I now we understand redeem means to be
[59:04] brought back it means a a purchase that
[59:07] is made and that there's a rightful
[59:09] ownership and so there had to be one not
[59:12] only that could do it but was willing to
[59:15] do it one that was able as we sung that
[59:18] song to look beyond all of our faults
[59:21] and see what we really needed in other
[59:24] words not to render or withhold a
[59:27] payment based on who we were or being
[59:30] represented being representative of
[59:33] presently but one who knew us that down
[59:36] beneath the darkness of our life the
[59:39] actions and all of the conglomeration of
[59:42] sin that we were caught in there had to
[59:44] be one who was able to look Beyond it
[59:47] all and recognize his seed beneath it
[59:51] and come to redeem that seed because he
[59:55] never come to raise up the Fallen
[59:58] character that had went down you know to
[1:00:01] gather you and I and make us better and
[1:00:03] uh you know give us a a group of
[1:00:06] guidelines that we can go by and and
[1:00:08] repeat till we're blew in the face and
[1:00:10] you know become good and do this and do
[1:00:12] that that would never work because the
[1:00:14] nature is still wrong what was needed
[1:00:18] was is there was a need need for one to
[1:00:21] come to pay the debt every sin all that
[1:00:25] was against you and I that we could walk
[1:00:28] and go free and come back into
[1:00:30] Fellowship fully with God they had
[1:00:33] Fellowship under the blood of bulls and
[1:00:35] goats but it can never ever take away
[1:00:38] sin why it wasn't the sufficient cost
[1:00:42] Hallelujah man came in he could confess
[1:00:46] his sin he could lay his hands which he
[1:00:48] is all symbolizing to be identified with
[1:00:51] his sacrifice of where you and I are to
[1:00:54] come through Calvary but the man could
[1:00:56] walk right out of there after offering
[1:00:59] up the required offering and he would
[1:01:01] still in his heart have the same desire
[1:01:04] to do the same thing why because the
[1:01:08] blood of bulls and goats was not the
[1:01:11] sufficient cost to pay the price to
[1:01:14] loosen man from the hold of sin but
[1:01:18] there would be a blood that would be
[1:01:21] provided for you and I not a blood
[1:01:24] that's of already of this polluted
[1:01:26] substance of this Earth that's why that
[1:01:29] when God became one of us God stepped
[1:01:32] down and God created a body for himself
[1:01:37] to come and dwell in he did not need the
[1:01:40] agency or the help of man can you
[1:01:42] imagine that the Creator would need to
[1:01:45] borrow something from somebody else he's
[1:01:49] the
[1:01:50] Creator he doesn't need to B to borrow
[1:01:53] the atomic structure or the molecular
[1:01:56] structure from somebody else in order to
[1:01:59] make off of it he is the creator the
[1:02:02] almighty God and he stepped forward with
[1:02:07] this bloodline that was already polluted
[1:02:09] he created a blood
[1:02:14] cell and he wrapped himself in that
[1:02:16] blood cell and he created a tabernacle
[1:02:21] that he himself could come down and
[1:02:24] express himself he could feel the Feel
[1:02:28] The Temptations feel everything that we
[1:02:31] would go through and with the purpose
[1:02:34] for death that he might offer himself up
[1:02:38] once and for all for sin to pay the all
[1:02:42] sufficient price remember in the Old
[1:02:45] Testament they would have a day of
[1:02:47] atonement and remember they would offer
[1:02:50] that that up and that was a once a year
[1:02:52] they would come through the cleansing of
[1:02:54] the sanctuary and that spoke that there
[1:02:58] would come a sacrifice once and for all
[1:03:01] it was not something that needed to be
[1:03:03] repeated but once that sacrifice had
[1:03:06] been made once Calvary has come there
[1:03:10] does not need to be another offering for
[1:03:12] sin there has already been the
[1:03:15] sufficient offering for
[1:03:18] sin he is our Passover Lamb he is our
[1:03:22] unleavened bread he is our Pentecost he
[1:03:26] is our all and
[1:03:28] all amen he is the fruits of our in
[1:03:31] gathering he is everything to you and I
[1:03:34] as a
[1:03:35] Believer he has become all things to you
[1:03:39] and
[1:03:39] I God s forward because all of us all
[1:03:44] all had were like sheep that had gone
[1:03:47] astray a sheep a lost sheep is the most
[1:03:50] hopeless helpless thing it'll cry out
[1:03:52] bad bad it can get so tangled up and and
[1:03:56] everything we all like sheep why yet we
[1:03:59] were sheep this is what's important we
[1:04:01] were always sheep that means that there
[1:04:04] was one who was ordained to be our
[1:04:07] Shepherd that we would hear his voice
[1:04:10] and in sometime some moment of our life
[1:04:13] this might be your moment tonight that
[1:04:15] you recognize that you are a sheep that
[1:04:18] you are a real Lamb of God and that he
[1:04:21] is your
[1:04:23] Shepherd hallelujah hallelujah
[1:04:26] he came to redeem you and I he came to
[1:04:30] pay that cost but all like sheep have
[1:04:32] gone
[1:04:33] astray all just wondering about this is
[1:04:37] why even when you you think about it
[1:04:40] even man has wondered uh looking for
[1:04:44] eternal life or Eternal youth even as
[1:04:47] those who came from Spain and other
[1:04:49] Portugal and everywhere else to try to
[1:04:51] find a fountain of youth they were why
[1:04:53] why was it that they were long or search
[1:04:55] for something like that it showed there
[1:04:57] was something within man that was
[1:05:00] craving that of
[1:05:04] perfection who put that thirst in there
[1:05:08] God put that thirst in there but Satan
[1:05:12] loves to try to come and try to satisfy
[1:05:16] that thirst or try to fill it or quench
[1:05:19] it with other things but you know you
[1:05:21] can never satisfy that thirst look at it
[1:05:25] around in world and even with things
[1:05:27] that could come about in our life and
[1:05:28] you know you might have this vehicle but
[1:05:31] then a few years or just a few months or
[1:05:33] next year here the next year's model has
[1:05:35] this and that and or this person paints
[1:05:37] their house this way and all of a sudden
[1:05:39] now in the neighborhood what you were
[1:05:40] walking by and saying wow odd that color
[1:05:43] of a door now and now many people in the
[1:05:45] neighborhood have that color of door and
[1:05:47] then you have this all you see was
[1:05:49] Styles you see with other things why
[1:05:51] there's things that man is trying to
[1:05:53] satisfy it's he's looking for for
[1:05:55] something that would would satisfy him
[1:05:58] you were made with that thirst on the
[1:06:00] inside of you and there's nothing that
[1:06:03] will satisfy that and I'm just going to
[1:06:06] say this thank God there's nothing that
[1:06:08] you or I could ever find that would
[1:06:11] satisfy that thirst or we wouldn't be
[1:06:14] here
[1:06:16] tonight we tried to satisfy it we went
[1:06:19] after other things all like sheep have
[1:06:22] gone
[1:06:23] astray Hallelujah we walked according to
[1:06:26] the prince and power of the world we
[1:06:28] were being led by The Prince and power
[1:06:30] of the
[1:06:31] air sin didn't work in our
[1:06:34] members here we were within it all in
[1:06:38] need of a
[1:06:40] redeemer and here the Bible says we have
[1:06:44] turned everyone to his own way man just
[1:06:48] going according to his own way to his
[1:06:51] own devices man trying to find his way
[1:06:55] back there's something that longs think
[1:06:57] about with job as we've been preaching
[1:06:59] on job for a few years now think about
[1:07:01] throughout the the the the chapters not
[1:07:04] just one verse but throughout the
[1:07:06] chapters you find a chord that weaves
[1:07:08] all the way through the Book of Job
[1:07:10] where job is continually Desiring to
[1:07:13] come and actually sit down and talk with
[1:07:17] God he wanted to be able to talk with
[1:07:20] him man has had that desire why because
[1:07:24] we were a part of God and man had
[1:07:27] fellowship with God in that way in the
[1:07:30] Garden of
[1:07:32] Eden what caused that Fellowship to be
[1:07:35] broken
[1:07:38] sin and sin is not just this attribute
[1:07:42] of sin of drinking smoking and lusting
[1:07:45] and those are
[1:07:46] attributes sin is
[1:07:50] unbelief the reason those things are
[1:07:52] done is because of
[1:07:54] unbelief this is why there had to be one
[1:07:58] that could come to satisfy and deal with
[1:08:01] that unbelief in our life because a good
[1:08:05] man with good Constitution maybe would
[1:08:08] have you know the Resolute to stop this
[1:08:10] and not do this and I won't look at this
[1:08:12] and I'll stop this and all of those
[1:08:14] things are fine but you've got to
[1:08:16] remember it's got to go deeper than just
[1:08:19] your thinking about it or to have a
[1:08:21] thinking of Holiness it's got to come to
[1:08:24] a moment to where the love of God is so
[1:08:27] deep and so strong in your heart to
[1:08:30] where it's like that man that they had
[1:08:32] to tie when they would go by that island
[1:08:34] and the music was playing they had to
[1:08:36] tie him up so that he didn't turn the
[1:08:38] ship in there and they tear it all up
[1:08:41] but one day he got off that ship he went
[1:08:44] down there and he followed this music
[1:08:46] different music that was playing and he
[1:08:48] came into a little church and he was led
[1:08:51] to Calvary and the next time they came
[1:08:54] through there the Sailors looked at the
[1:08:56] captain and said should we tie you to
[1:08:58] the mass pole he said no you don't need
[1:09:01] to tie my hands no more for I've heard a
[1:09:04] sound that's so much sweeter than all of
[1:09:08] that music out there and that's the way
[1:09:10] the Lord Jesus that's the way the love
[1:09:12] of God becomes in the heart of a
[1:09:15] Believer it becomes
[1:09:17] sweeter than all
[1:09:21] sin ites turn his own way this is is one
[1:09:25] of the this was one of the things
[1:09:29] that we needed help with turning his own
[1:09:33] way because one of the one of the key
[1:09:37] components of that first birth is
[1:09:40] selfishness that's it's something that
[1:09:42] even after we have been filled with
[1:09:45] God's spirit that we have to continually
[1:09:48] put in
[1:09:49] subjection but it only comes by the
[1:09:51] spirit of God dwelling in us to give us
[1:09:53] discernment and recognize wait a minute
[1:09:57] that does not belong in this Temple
[1:09:59] that's because we've got a right to
[1:10:02] feelings right listen God didn't make us
[1:10:04] to be
[1:10:06] numb so feelings aren't bad but but but
[1:10:10] we we have a right remember like sheep
[1:10:12] we got a right we can we can have a
[1:10:15] right to hold on to things in our life
[1:10:17] or we can forsake it and yield it to the
[1:10:21] Lord because remember a sheep is meant
[1:10:25] also oo to produce
[1:10:27] wool and that wool is to be taken
[1:10:31] off is that right so Man became just a
[1:10:35] Wonder but longing for a place to where
[1:10:38] he can get back into the presence of God
[1:10:41] it would require a blood
[1:10:43] sacrifice remember it starts out with
[1:10:46] just Abel and Cain you know many times
[1:10:49] when we as we look at this you we we
[1:10:52] recognize that even with that of with
[1:10:55] Cain brought just the the best fruits
[1:10:57] that that could be brought he he wasn't
[1:10:59] a smart elic he built an altar he came
[1:11:02] to church he paid his tithes he did all
[1:11:05] those things but Cain himself when it
[1:11:08] came to recognizing God's provided way
[1:11:11] how would he know God's provided way you
[1:11:13] say it was Cain but remember God
[1:11:16] revealed his way to Abel and Abel
[1:11:19] offered up of that of the Lamb because
[1:11:23] it was revealed to Abel think about this
[1:11:25] both of them boys had been taught by
[1:11:28] their father and mother they had covered
[1:11:31] up their sin that's those boys did not
[1:11:34] know of what had taken place of an act
[1:11:37] in the
[1:11:38] garden but when God was going to get his
[1:11:42] message through the dev was going to get
[1:11:44] through into the camp and God seemed to
[1:11:47] it that God was going to get his message
[1:11:50] to Abel because Abel desired to worship
[1:11:54] God yeah you say didn't Cain desire to
[1:11:57] worship God let me tell you something
[1:11:59] God is not here tonight wondering or
[1:12:03] trying to find out about you or me or
[1:12:05] the next person he knows the depths of
[1:12:09] Our Lives already the Bible said in
[1:12:11] Romans n he said Jacob have I loved Esau
[1:12:15] have I hated hated means L less he
[1:12:18] already knew them before they were ever
[1:12:21] formed in their mother's womb before any
[1:12:24] the Bible said having done good or evil
[1:12:27] and to tell you the truth following the
[1:12:28] scripture Esau was a much better man
[1:12:31] than
[1:12:33] Jacob Jacob was a Shyer and a
[1:12:38] deceiver he true but the difference was
[1:12:42] is Esau he despised or did not care for
[1:12:46] the
[1:12:48] birthright and the birthright being that
[1:12:51] blessing that belongs to the firstborn
[1:12:54] hallah being a type of the spirit of God
[1:12:57] the Holy Spirit coming to the firstborn
[1:13:01] coming to you say well I'm not the
[1:13:03] firstborn in my home but no I'm not
[1:13:05] talking about in your Earthly natural
[1:13:08] family tree lineage I'm talking about
[1:13:11] that you are always a part of God and
[1:13:14] Christ himself is the firstborn the
[1:13:18] firstborn of every creature you were
[1:13:21] chosen in Christ before the foundation
[1:13:24] of the world and remember the lamb the
[1:13:28] Passover Lamb the blood of the Lamb was
[1:13:31] meant in order to hang on to the
[1:13:33] firstborn the firstborn was redeemable
[1:13:37] but there had to be a blood of an
[1:13:39] innocent one that would stand on behalf
[1:13:42] of the
[1:13:43] firstborn and that's what God provided
[1:13:47] for you and I he made a way that we
[1:13:50] could have our life back that we should
[1:13:52] have had he made a way that we can come
[1:13:55] back into fellowship with God that you
[1:13:58] and I can have a real solid Victory and
[1:14:02] rest and stability in our life he made a
[1:14:08] way
[1:14:10] Hallelujah it would require blood and
[1:14:13] Abel stepping forward and notice Cain as
[1:14:16] we said moments ago Cain you say well
[1:14:19] how what how what could Cain do Cain
[1:14:21] could see the witness of the Holy Spirit
[1:14:24] accepting
[1:14:25] right Abel's
[1:14:28] sacrifice Abel was only offering up what
[1:14:31] he's what was revealed to him you know
[1:14:33] you can only live according to what's
[1:14:35] revealed to you you can't live according
[1:14:38] to what you see somebody else doing
[1:14:41] that's why you've got to have a personal
[1:14:44] revelation like brother Paul was
[1:14:46] preaching here catching a vision you
[1:14:48] personally meeting God it's got to be a
[1:14:51] personal revelation it can't be well
[1:14:53] Daddy said this mama said this or the
[1:14:55] prophet said this all of those things
[1:14:58] are to declare to you that he is a
[1:15:00] living God and he wants to be your God
[1:15:04] he wants to be personal to
[1:15:08] you is that all right yes this is why
[1:15:11] that Revelation so here God lets him
[1:15:14] know to Cain hey if you do well do like
[1:15:18] your brother you'll be
[1:15:19] accepted but Cain refused it and walked
[1:15:23] away God God had accepted Abel and God
[1:15:27] was showing the pattern all the way down
[1:15:30] that he would reveal the provided
[1:15:33] acceptable way for every one of his
[1:15:37] children God finds you and I right where
[1:15:40] we're at God leads us in the time we're
[1:15:43] at listen this is why I'm saying this
[1:15:45] don't look at somebody else you look to
[1:15:48] God for your own life and where you're
[1:15:51] at right now listen don't make excuses
[1:15:53] for it don't look for reason just say
[1:15:56] God I want to know you Lord in such a
[1:15:59] personal way Lord I I don't want to look
[1:16:02] at you through veils of veils of my
[1:16:05] ideas veils of my thoughts veils of this
[1:16:08] person veils of hurt veils of this I'm
[1:16:11] Lord God you have torn every Veil that
[1:16:14] is that is there I don't want to look
[1:16:16] through veils I want to see
[1:16:20] you I tell you where there is a
[1:16:23] hunger for for that there are veils to
[1:16:28] be
[1:16:30] broken and let me just tell you
[1:16:32] something when a heart begins to get
[1:16:34] hungry for God let me tell you why that
[1:16:37] is that's because the Bible has said
[1:16:39] draw nigh unto God and He will draw nigh
[1:16:42] unto
[1:16:44] you I'm telling you what's happening is
[1:16:46] it's just like Rahab Rahab was hearing
[1:16:49] what was going on and she began to think
[1:16:51] about what was happening here the
[1:16:52] presence of the Lord was drawing n to
[1:16:55] her house she didn't think about it that
[1:16:57] day wondering like what was going to
[1:16:59] happen she' had no idea there was a
[1:17:01] visitation coming there but you know
[1:17:03] what there was the promise draw nine to
[1:17:05] God and he'll draw nine to you here came
[1:17:09] the message that God was stirring in her
[1:17:12] heart for deliverance and God sent a
[1:17:14] message it was not because of Rahab it
[1:17:17] was God who put that hunger in her heart
[1:17:21] and when God puts the hunger in your
[1:17:23] heart that's God letting you know
[1:17:25] he's on the road to meet your need
[1:17:28] Hall
[1:17:30] hallu oh my the cost was so great think
[1:17:34] about this in Romans 5:6 think about
[1:17:37] this it's just this scripture here just
[1:17:39] meditating on it today for when we were
[1:17:42] yet without Strength In Due Time Christ
[1:17:45] died for the ungodly for scarcely for a
[1:17:49] righteous man will one die yet per
[1:17:51] adventure for a good man some would even
[1:17:54] dare to die but God commended his love
[1:17:58] toward us in that while we were yet
[1:18:00] sinners Christ died for us prise the
[1:18:06] Lord while we were no good even think
[1:18:09] about it knowing that we would come into
[1:18:12] this life decisions we would make but
[1:18:15] let me just tell you something when he
[1:18:17] was there in gemany those scriptures we
[1:18:20] read out of Isaiah 53 you find it it is
[1:18:23] written in past tense
[1:18:25] he was
[1:18:27] wounded he was
[1:18:30] bruised because in the mind of God the
[1:18:33] lamb was already slain Isaiah was caught
[1:18:36] up remember a a prophet is not speaking
[1:18:40] a new word but a prophet is being caught
[1:18:43] up and he is catching the word that's
[1:18:46] already been
[1:18:48] spoken is that right he's moving out of
[1:18:51] these Realms and what's happening it's
[1:18:53] introducing the heavenly down here in
[1:18:56] this Earthly realm because there are
[1:18:58] subjects that are of God ordained to
[1:19:02] hear that and are a part of that word
[1:19:05] and to think of how that within this God
[1:19:09] knowing everything before anything had
[1:19:12] ever transpired where you and I would be
[1:19:14] but God already he made a way he paid
[1:19:18] the price he settled the debt the cost
[1:19:21] that was needed he paid that cost amen
[1:19:25] while we were yet
[1:19:28] sinners we were enemies the Bible says
[1:19:32] alienated by Wicked Works in our minds
[1:19:35] that's right so he didn't listen God did
[1:19:37] not come
[1:19:39] down for necessarily because we were
[1:19:43] friendly God came and paid the price but
[1:19:47] it wasn't because of the condition of
[1:19:49] that he was looking at he was looking
[1:19:51] down beneath all of that and he saw the
[1:19:54] real need I say God if he has done that
[1:19:58] for me and that same life has come to me
[1:20:01] then that's how my eyes should look to
[1:20:03] to look Beyond situations to look Beyond
[1:20:06] grievances to look Beyond hurts to look
[1:20:08] Beyond everything even when I'm
[1:20:10] witnessing to somebody to be able to
[1:20:12] look beyond the condition they might
[1:20:15] have tattoos up one side and down the
[1:20:17] other they might have rings as big as
[1:20:19] hula hoops but oh God let me look beyond
[1:20:22] what I'm seeing Lord on the outside and
[1:20:25] recognize that down on the inside is a
[1:20:28] son and daughter of God
[1:20:31] potentially yes sir that's what he
[1:20:35] did that's what he
[1:20:37] did Hallelujah 1 Timothy 2:5 for there
[1:20:41] is one God and one mediator between God
[1:20:44] and man and Men the man Christ Jesus who
[1:20:47] gave himself a ransome for all to be
[1:20:50] testified in due time aren't you glad
[1:20:53] for that he gave himself a ransom for
[1:20:57] all thinking about the cost that it made
[1:21:00] I I think of how brother R would talk
[1:21:03] about that time you remember where that
[1:21:05] that young lady got off that train and
[1:21:07] she was her mother was standing there
[1:21:09] and you know waving to her and and her
[1:21:12] mother was so glad to see her come
[1:21:14] home that young lady got off that train
[1:21:17] she wouldn't even look at her that was
[1:21:20] her
[1:21:21] mama she wouldn't look at
[1:21:23] her
[1:21:25] she walked on by she wanted to ignore
[1:21:27] her you know why because her mother you
[1:21:30] know the story but just bear with me a
[1:21:32] moment cuz it's very fitting there was a
[1:21:35] house fire and here she was as a little
[1:21:38] girl her mother who is standing there
[1:21:42] scarred as brother Brown would describe
[1:21:44] just so things you know are flesh and
[1:21:46] things so burned up and you know the
[1:21:48] things how that could possibly be but
[1:21:51] she grabbed a blanket and she swaddled
[1:21:56] that little girl and carried her through
[1:21:58] the Flames out through
[1:22:00] safety she took the heat she became ugly
[1:22:06] so that her daughter might be
[1:22:09] beautiful I'm telling you God
[1:22:14] himself not the second person but God
[1:22:17] came
[1:22:20] down job said I know my redeemer liveth
[1:22:25] hallah he's
[1:22:27] alive and God stepped down and he
[1:22:30] himself became despised rejected no
[1:22:34] Beauty we should desire him he took the
[1:22:37] full brunt of sin the Bible said the
[1:22:41] Lord it pleased the Lord to bruise him
[1:22:45] where when the meat was hanging off of
[1:22:47] his back to see the
[1:22:49] ribs the crown of thorns for our mind
[1:22:53] battles
[1:22:55] the stripes that he bore for our healing
[1:22:59] hallelujah hallelujah he had the weight
[1:23:01] of the sin think about how you feel or I
[1:23:05] feel when we have done
[1:23:07] wrong and how that maybe it was just
[1:23:10] something that we didn't even say maybe
[1:23:12] it's the way that in our heart we know
[1:23:15] the perception behind it and it was
[1:23:18] Smite our heart think about how that
[1:23:20] feels to you and I that's right he had
[1:23:23] the whole weight of the sin of the
[1:23:29] world he himself became our sin Bearer
[1:23:35] amen all of the sin was placed upon him
[1:23:40] remember in the Old Testament when two
[1:23:43] Rams two of the goats would be would be
[1:23:46] offered up one would be offered up and
[1:23:48] the other the blood of that goat then
[1:23:50] how would come about and it would be
[1:23:52] placed on the other goat and that goat
[1:23:54] itself self would be called the
[1:23:56] scapegoat they would take that goat and
[1:23:58] a man who was an able man was
[1:24:01] commissioned to take that goat and Lead
[1:24:04] it out into the Wilderness and leave
[1:24:06] that goat there and walk back without
[1:24:09] that goat you say what happened to that
[1:24:11] goat no doubt the wild animals tore it
[1:24:14] all to pieces no doubt they got all of
[1:24:16] that but you know what that scape goat
[1:24:18] represented it represented the sins of
[1:24:21] the children of Israel and they were not
[1:24:24] going to see that goat walk back in
[1:24:26] again let me tell you something that God
[1:24:29] himself when he comes to you and I he's
[1:24:32] not making known to you or rubbing your
[1:24:34] face in your condition he's letting you
[1:24:37] know I've already paid the price the
[1:24:41] cost has been
[1:24:43] settled hallu a man or a woman that
[1:24:47] chooses they choose to live under that
[1:24:50] they choose it because now there's no
[1:24:53] longer such a thing as just walking
[1:24:55] under the blood of bulls and goats
[1:24:57] there's no such thing as just temporary
[1:25:00] there's no such thing as just partial
[1:25:02] right now is fully available amen
[1:25:05] through a New and Living Way through his
[1:25:06] flesh through the opening of the Riven
[1:25:08] Veil a place that you and I can come
[1:25:10] right back into fellowship with almighty
[1:25:12] God the
[1:25:14] cost as I said the resurrection how
[1:25:17] wonderful how tremendous because he
[1:25:20] raised for our justification that
[1:25:22] raising getting up on that e Easter
[1:25:24] morning it proved he was who he said he
[1:25:30] was even deware that those who didn't
[1:25:34] understand that had hap what had taken
[1:25:36] place what were they sheep Smite the
[1:25:39] shepherd it'll scatter the Sheep but
[1:25:42] they're still sheep they might be
[1:25:44] scattered but they're still sheep all it
[1:25:46] takes is the shepherd's voice to gather
[1:25:48] the sheep and the shepherd goes and
[1:25:52] gathers the sheep and lets them know
[1:25:54] everything is right in line and right in
[1:25:56] order that indeed Redemption has come
[1:25:59] you know what that meant for them now is
[1:26:03] made the promise available of the Holy
[1:26:06] Ghost why because the
[1:26:10] cost the
[1:26:11] cost has been
[1:26:15] satisfied I want you to think of
[1:26:18] that he who knew no sin became sin Paul
[1:26:23] would write it like this in Galatians
[1:26:26] 6:14 God forbid that I should Glory save
[1:26:29] in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ by
[1:26:33] whom the world is crucified unto me and
[1:26:38] I unto the world that's so yes sir he
[1:26:41] made a way I want to just I want to take
[1:26:45] you here to one place in 2 Samuel 24
[1:26:47] this this portion of of the scripture
[1:26:50] really just striking my heart here this
[1:26:53] afternoon remember that David God had
[1:26:55] moved David had moved him to number
[1:27:00] Israel and then here how God you know
[1:27:03] there was a judgment That Came Upon
[1:27:05] Israel because God was God was moved
[1:27:08] against Israel and David David was moved
[1:27:11] then to have them numbered and a
[1:27:13] pestilence came in a plague came in
[1:27:16] among them and this is where David
[1:27:19] remember David did not ask of this it
[1:27:20] was a choice of three things and David
[1:27:22] remember said let us just fall into to
[1:27:24] the mercies of God so a plague had come
[1:27:27] upon the people let me just tell you
[1:27:29] like this there was a plague When sin
[1:27:33] entered there was a plague that came as
[1:27:36] a matter of fact When sin came paralysis
[1:27:39] struck the human race Amnesia struck the
[1:27:42] human race that's so good because what
[1:27:45] God had ordained and created man to be
[1:27:48] as a son and daughter of God he was
[1:27:50] paralyzed to that unable to walk there
[1:27:55] would be glimpses of it we would see
[1:27:57] glimpses in Elijah we would see glimpses
[1:27:59] in Moses we would see glimpses but no
[1:28:02] one had expressed what the first Adam
[1:28:06] was like until the second Adam came are
[1:28:09] you hearing me there were glimpses but
[1:28:11] there came forth one who was worthy and
[1:28:14] when he hear the worthy one standing
[1:28:16] there all the wonderful men that the
[1:28:18] spirit of God would move upon and pull
[1:28:21] back and we could see glimpes where they
[1:28:23] would operate under the word or that
[1:28:26] blood that type that was given like
[1:28:29] Moses they would speak things there in
[1:28:31] Egypt they would operate under that un
[1:28:34] with an authority but only one would
[1:28:37] show us what that first Adam was
[1:28:41] like and let me just tell you this right
[1:28:44] here in this end time God started out a
[1:28:48] church on the day of
[1:28:49] Pentecost but by the time it got to the
[1:28:51] Ephesian age it was a fallen woman
[1:28:54] but God in the end time promised there
[1:28:57] would come in the days of the revealing
[1:28:59] of the son of man that once again the
[1:29:02] same Lord Jesus the second Adam would
[1:29:06] come and in his fullness and make
[1:29:09] himself known not just a portion as it
[1:29:11] had been down through the Seven Ages
[1:29:13] each one of those colors of the rainbow
[1:29:15] but it would all be joined together
[1:29:17] because God is light and every one of
[1:29:20] those parts are in light and God would
[1:29:22] be gathered together and God would show
[1:29:25] to you and I in this end
[1:29:28] time not that it would be highlighted
[1:29:30] just upon a man but God would take a
[1:29:33] vessel and show you and I of what he's
[1:29:35] calling us to as Sons and Daughters of
[1:29:38] God it's not for me or you that we have
[1:29:40] to stand on the platform and discern no
[1:29:43] that that office has been fulfilled but
[1:29:45] God has brought it to you and I to where
[1:29:48] there's a people back on Earth that will
[1:29:50] believe every word of
[1:29:53] God
[1:29:56] Hallelujah it was a cost for this
[1:29:58] message to come to you and I
[1:30:01] Hallelujah there was a cost within it
[1:30:06] amen now let me just get into this here
[1:30:09] just a few moments let me just have just
[1:30:10] a few moments here here Gad In Verse 18
[1:30:14] now watch how this leadership is coming
[1:30:16] on how to stay the plague Gad is the
[1:30:18] prophet Gad came to David and he said
[1:30:21] unto him go up and rear up an altar unto
[1:30:23] the Lord in the threshing floor of Arana
[1:30:26] the jebusite and David according to the
[1:30:28] saying of G
[1:30:30] notice we could preach on that a little
[1:30:32] bit but David according to the saying of
[1:30:34] GAD went up as the Lord commanded you
[1:30:37] see David knew Gad is the Lord
[1:30:40] spokesman so what God has said it's not
[1:30:43] actually God it's the
[1:30:46] Lord so I'm doing as God said as the
[1:30:49] Lord
[1:30:50] commanded Paul said follow me as I
[1:30:53] follow
[1:30:55] Christ and Arana looked and saw the king
[1:30:58] and his servants coming on toward him
[1:31:00] and Arana went out and bound himself
[1:31:02] before the King on his face upon the
[1:31:04] ground and AR said wherefore is my Lord
[1:31:08] the king come to his servant and David
[1:31:10] said to buy the threshing floor of thee
[1:31:13] to build an altar unto the Lord that the
[1:31:16] plague may be stayed from the people so
[1:31:19] the way that the plague is going to be
[1:31:21] stopped there's got to be an altar and a
[1:31:24] sacrifice made that's the only thing
[1:31:27] that can ever stop the
[1:31:29] plague that's the only thing that can
[1:31:32] deal with the sin question we must have
[1:31:35] a
[1:31:36] sacrifice a place provided an ordained
[1:31:40] place for the altar to be raised
[1:31:44] upall
[1:31:46] Hallelujah and AR said unto David let my
[1:31:49] Lord the king Take now watch this and
[1:31:51] offer up what Seth good unto him behold
[1:31:54] here be oxen for burnt sacrifice and
[1:31:57] threshing instruments and other
[1:31:58] instruments of The Oxen for wood and
[1:32:01] these things did Arana as King as a king
[1:32:05] gave give unto the king and Arana said
[1:32:08] unto the king the Lord thy God accept
[1:32:10] thee but the king and the King said unto
[1:32:13] Arana nay but I will surely buy it of
[1:32:17] thee at a price neither will I offer
[1:32:20] burnt offerings unto the Lord my God of
[1:32:23] that which cost me nothing
[1:32:25] hallah in other words I'm not a
[1:32:29] freeloader I know it's going to cost me
[1:32:32] something in order for the plague to be
[1:32:35] stayed I can't take your your oxen I
[1:32:39] can't take from you I must provide for
[1:32:43] myself the
[1:32:45] sacrifice and David purchased not only
[1:32:49] the ground right for the
[1:32:52] altar but he purchased the sacrifice
[1:32:56] that was
[1:32:58] needed God showing a type of himself
[1:33:03] that God was not going to take out of
[1:33:06] that of human Humanity that was already
[1:33:09] polluted but God himself would come and
[1:33:12] pay the sufficient cost it would not be
[1:33:15] a cheap price it would cost him the life
[1:33:19] of his dearly beloved Son for God so
[1:33:22] loved the world that he gave his only
[1:33:26] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[1:33:28] him should not perish but have
[1:33:31] everlasting life God provided for
[1:33:34] himself like he did for Abraham on Mount
[1:33:37] Mariah God provided a sacrifice for
[1:33:41] himself all the way through the
[1:33:43] scripture it's God providing for
[1:33:49] himself that's good I'm not going to
[1:33:51] give you something that don't cost me
[1:33:53] anything
[1:33:55] thing see that's where that's even where
[1:33:58] things have come to and have been all
[1:34:01] the way down through time is man wants
[1:34:04] to do what little they can they can do
[1:34:06] or want to do they'll put lies on the
[1:34:09] altar they'll put all they'll do all
[1:34:11] sorts of things Paul even said they
[1:34:13] would speak in tongues nothing wrong
[1:34:16] with speaking in tongues but Paul said
[1:34:18] they can speak in tongues prophesy have
[1:34:20] visions they can even understand all
[1:34:22] Mysteries and have all of that and still
[1:34:25] not be a surrendered
[1:34:27] life men will study and study and all
[1:34:31] sorts of things and they'll do
[1:34:33] everything to dodge a full surrender you
[1:34:36] and I can never make ourself good
[1:34:40] enough the cost has been made Calvary
[1:34:44] made a way that every son and daughter
[1:34:46] of God can have a real
[1:34:49] [Applause]
[1:34:51] Calvary I'm not going to offer God
[1:34:53] something that don't cost me
[1:34:55] anything that'd be like you offering me
[1:34:57] a shirt out of your closet that you
[1:34:59] don't ever
[1:35:00] wear oh here no problem Lord I'll give
[1:35:03] you this one I'll give you
[1:35:07] this let me remind you the Rich Young
[1:35:09] Ruler his decision was not about Sin in
[1:35:12] his life you couldn't have laid one
[1:35:14] finger on that was not wrong to have
[1:35:16] riches that's right if he was looking
[1:35:19] under the dos and don'ts of the message
[1:35:21] is it wrong to have Rich riches it was
[1:35:23] nothing wrong with it no that's right
[1:35:25] but what was wrong is he valued one
[1:35:28] little thing above a full surrender am
[1:35:32] and God was dealing with the cost in his
[1:35:35] life I tell you it'll cost you things it
[1:35:39] will cost you but the main thing that it
[1:35:41] cost you is it'll cost you your life
[1:35:44] Hallelujah listen friends you can live
[1:35:46] your life trying to say do we do this do
[1:35:49] we don't do that do we do this do we
[1:35:51] don't do this you are a weary miserable
[1:35:56] person because you're always going to be
[1:35:58] guessing do I do this do I do this can
[1:36:01] we do this can I do that and it always
[1:36:04] becomes like Ruth laboring in the field
[1:36:07] weary
[1:36:10] legalist but the goal is
[1:36:14] rest it's
[1:36:17] rest it's about a love affair there's
[1:36:20] things that my wife can ask of me right
[1:36:22] now I'm not looking at a Lisk of what is
[1:36:25] required I do this and do that but there
[1:36:27] are things that you know what it don't
[1:36:29] bother me to go
[1:36:31] beyond when there's little things that
[1:36:33] arise and things that comes up maybe she
[1:36:35] asked me to alter my schedule here or
[1:36:38] alter it
[1:36:39] there but it's my love for her that's
[1:36:42] good if that's fial love towards your
[1:36:47] spouse how much greater is the agape
[1:36:51] love I'm telling you friend this is why
[1:36:54] when a person when a life this is what
[1:36:56] you ought to press for with everything
[1:36:58] within you listen you know I'm talking
[1:37:00] right down your alley tonight you can't
[1:37:02] live just by your own love it's got to
[1:37:05] take the love of God in your
[1:37:07] life and this is why the prophet said
[1:37:10] when you get to a place that you love
[1:37:12] God so much he said then will come the
[1:37:15] baptism of the love of God down into
[1:37:18] your
[1:37:20] heart but you know what happens
[1:37:22] sometimes is that old first thing that
[1:37:25] old first nature of Pride we want God to
[1:37:28] do it
[1:37:29] all God you've got to come and take it
[1:37:31] all Lord you're going to have to do this
[1:37:34] no no be like David I ain't going to
[1:37:36] offer him something that don't cost me
[1:37:38] nothing I don't want somebody else's
[1:37:40] sacrifice Hallelujah I don't want
[1:37:42] somebody I I I must have my own
[1:37:44] sacrifice and God made a way through
[1:37:48] Calvary that you and I can sacrifice our
[1:37:52] own life unto
[1:37:54] him before Calvary that was impossible
[1:37:59] there were types but it was impossible
[1:38:01] to come into that full sacrificial life
[1:38:05] but Calvary made a way for it the Bible
[1:38:08] said the land was
[1:38:10] intreated for that and the plague was
[1:38:13] stayed from
[1:38:15] Israel oh God help us tonight amen God
[1:38:19] help us and give us Grace friends listen
[1:38:21] there's nothing wrong with works but I'm
[1:38:22] I'm telling you tonight the cost has
[1:38:24] been already satisfied you don't have to
[1:38:28] live under that any
[1:38:29] longer you say what are you talking
[1:38:31] about I I I'll give you an example of
[1:38:33] where God brought me from it was so easy
[1:38:36] to fall off the wagon but it's got to be
[1:38:38] something that's deeper than just doing
[1:38:41] this and doing that it's a place that we
[1:38:43] can come to and God he made a
[1:38:47] way listen those Pharisees you couldn't
[1:38:49] lay a finger the prophet tells us upon
[1:38:52] their lives their dos and don'ts was
[1:38:55] spotless right but the word discerned
[1:38:58] their need inside they were full of dead
[1:39:02] men's bones inside stepen even caught
[1:39:05] the same thing that the Lord Jesus
[1:39:08] Steven could say you have resisted the
[1:39:10] Holy Ghost even as your fathers it was
[1:39:13] the Holy Ghost that anointed Jeremiah
[1:39:16] anointed Isaiah anointed them all the
[1:39:18] way down and they rejected the voice of
[1:39:20] Christ all the way down through there
[1:39:23] and the atonement standing right in
[1:39:25] front of them they rejected the
[1:39:27] atonement where Abraham's
[1:39:32] seed huh who are you to tell
[1:39:36] us do you know who we are we can give
[1:39:39] you our
[1:39:40] pedigree let me tell you something it
[1:39:41] didn't matter their pedigree when it
[1:39:44] came down to it What mattered is is did
[1:39:47] they have a soul on the inside that
[1:39:51] could hear God and could would respond
[1:39:54] to the voice of almighty God that's what
[1:39:58] matters and when you are just in tune
[1:40:00] with that and hearing the spirit of God
[1:40:02] friends move in that channel be like a
[1:40:04] salmon that's going Upstream you might
[1:40:06] have to fight against all everything
[1:40:09] that's come in your way but that's the
[1:40:11] call of the birth lands it's a call to
[1:40:15] get back there and let the salmon go up
[1:40:18] the
[1:40:20] stream back to the place
[1:40:23] Where We Belong the cost if there had
[1:40:27] been no cost right no Calvary the cost
[1:40:32] would never have been
[1:40:34] paid but there was a there was a Calvary
[1:40:38] and a Calvary was made so that we could
[1:40:41] have our own
[1:40:45] Calvary we could come to a place of
[1:40:47] death to ourselves death to our ideas
[1:40:52] that's why the church itself it's not
[1:40:54] just it's not just something we come
[1:40:56] together serving God is not something we
[1:40:59] do a couple days out of the out of the
[1:41:01] week and a few times out of the month
[1:41:03] and we serving God is our
[1:41:05] life it's not something that I want you
[1:41:07] to understand me we're it's not
[1:41:09] something as like a menite or an Amish
[1:41:12] order that's not what it is it's serving
[1:41:15] God under the birthright it's serving
[1:41:18] God under the Holy Spirit where it
[1:41:20] brings his life on the inside of you
[1:41:23] where it's no longer you living you
[1:41:25] don't even have to try it's not you
[1:41:27] trying to live a right life it's not you
[1:41:29] trying to do what's right it's Christ in
[1:41:31] you living out his own life how many
[1:41:35] times the prophet says it it sounds
[1:41:36] silly but how many times he say it if I
[1:41:39] had the spirit of bethoven in me what
[1:41:41] would you
[1:41:42] expect you expect me to be a football
[1:41:44] player no if the spirit of Beethoven is
[1:41:48] in me you would expect me to write
[1:41:52] symphonies and if the spirit of Jesus
[1:41:55] Christ Hallelujah that's the purpose of
[1:41:57] Calvary Calvary did not come to make
[1:41:59] churches Calvary did not come to bring a
[1:42:02] gathering of people Calvary came in
[1:42:06] order to satisfy the
[1:42:09] debt in order that that life might be
[1:42:13] imparted to you and I amen he made a way
[1:42:18] yes he did that we could follow
[1:42:20] him back into the presence of
[1:42:25] God the cost think about
[1:42:28] it let's bow our
[1:42:41] heads Wonder as we bow our heads in
[1:42:44] prayer would be one that would want to
[1:42:46] be remembered in prayer
[1:42:50] tonight some maybe in some way that the
[1:42:52] Lord is spoke to your heart across some
[1:42:55] point some thought you want to be
[1:42:58] remembered in prayer tonight say Lord
[1:43:01] remember me God bless you bless your
[1:43:04] hands God knows what we we have need of
[1:43:07] he knows
[1:43:09] exactly Heavenly
[1:43:13] Father Lord Jesus as we stand here Lord
[1:43:17] and In This Moment Lord on a Thursday
[1:43:22] evening to consider
[1:43:24] Lord as we're standing Lord at this
[1:43:28] Easter week
[1:43:30] and
[1:43:32] Lord as we look Lord tomorrow being that
[1:43:35] of Good Friday
[1:43:37] and Lord to thank
[1:43:40] about even all of
[1:43:44] the ways that Lord when you became one
[1:43:47] of us and
[1:43:48] that the cost that was needed to satisfy
[1:43:52] that to satisfi to pay the
[1:43:57] debt oh Lord and what it means to
[1:44:02] us I realize Lord that
[1:44:05] many many things Lord were many much of
[1:44:09] Christianity will just rally and gather
[1:44:12] around oh I'm so thankful he came to go
[1:44:15] to Calvary I'm so thankful that he he
[1:44:18] made a way for me and I realize Lord
[1:44:20] each one has their
[1:44:21] part but
[1:44:24] that's not really what Calvary was all
[1:44:28] about Lord to look at Calvary and to
[1:44:30] recognize that Not only was that sin
[1:44:32] debt
[1:44:34] paid but like your Prophet says Lord the
[1:44:37] very backbone of Satan was broke on
[1:44:42] Calvary where the sin question was
[1:44:47] settled Lord God we're like Moses
[1:44:50] himself familiar passages of scripture
[1:44:53] in John 3 as
[1:44:56] Moses raised up that Brazen
[1:45:00] serpent in the wilderness Soul likewise
[1:45:03] the son of man must be lifted
[1:45:07] up that whosoever believeth in
[1:45:10] him should not perish but have
[1:45:13] everlasting
[1:45:15] life Lord showing we see it even on the
[1:45:18] medical we can go to a hospital go on an
[1:45:21] ambulance what do we see see we see a
[1:45:24] pole with a serpent on it it represents
[1:45:31] [Music]
[1:45:32] medicine but yet we
[1:45:35] realize that's a symbol where did that
[1:45:37] come from well it might have been
[1:45:39] somebody here or there down Through the
[1:45:41] Ages but I find it quite
[1:45:45] striking because Lord we realize that
[1:45:48] that serpent itself represents
[1:45:51] sin it was in possible for Adam
[1:45:56] himself but sin was
[1:45:59] introduced into the human
[1:46:03] race Lord we
[1:46:06] realize we read back in the scriptures
[1:46:09] the serpent the Bible says was a subtle
[1:46:11] Beast not a reptile a subtle Beast more
[1:46:14] subtle than all the beasts of the field
[1:46:17] then why do we have it represented as a
[1:46:19] serpent that way on the
[1:46:21] pole because the Lord
[1:46:24] Lord when it came time for
[1:46:27] Reckoning you handed out all everything
[1:46:30] that would be done Adam and Eve they
[1:46:33] would have to Adam would would toore by
[1:46:35] the sweat of his brow he would earn his
[1:46:38] keep how that you would speak to her the
[1:46:41] woman and you would say at that
[1:46:43] [Music]
[1:46:45] time that desire shall be to thy
[1:46:48] husband because that order had been
[1:46:50] broken she had got out of that order
[1:46:53] then as you would speak to that
[1:46:56] serpent upon thy belly Thou shalt
[1:47:00] go right there was changed from an
[1:47:04] upright
[1:47:05] being no longer can that
[1:47:08] mingle with that of the human
[1:47:12] race dust shall be thy
[1:47:16] [Music]
[1:47:17] meat Lord Jesus here we walk around in
[1:47:20] these dust flesh bodies
[1:47:25] we had Lord we came to this world like
[1:47:28] job could write David could write man
[1:47:30] who's born of sin is a few days old in a
[1:47:32] full of trouble nobody had to teach us
[1:47:35] how to do wrong it was already inbred in
[1:47:38] US it came with us care package of the
[1:47:41] first
[1:47:43] birth of that Union
[1:47:45] between Satan through the serpent and
[1:47:48] Eve we came with a snake bite condition
[1:47:52] in our
[1:47:58] [Music]
[1:48:13] [Music]
[1:48:29] [Music]
[1:48:35] [Music]
[1:48:44] [Music]
[1:48:53] nature so much so to where the scripture
[1:48:55] could say and we have an witness in our
[1:48:58] hearts we are not the old man made over
[1:49:02] we are a new creation in Christ
[1:49:08] Jesus oh God how we thank you Lord you
[1:49:11] made a way through Calvary that we could
[1:49:14] be born again without Calvary there
[1:49:16] would have been no way possible but you
[1:49:19] made a way that we could follow you
[1:49:24] Lord I pray here
[1:49:26] tonight I'm asking that Lord right here
[1:49:29] in this
[1:49:31] [Music]
[1:49:34] service Lord I believe truly that the
[1:49:36] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[1:49:38] of the
[1:49:39] Lord you know Lord even the things that
[1:49:41] was on my heart I was ready to minister
[1:49:43] Lord today but as you would direct this
[1:49:46] Lord God here this
[1:49:49] afternoon Lord I know there's
[1:49:51] needs there's needs among us because as
[1:49:54] We
[1:49:55] Gather we're needy people now Lord you
[1:49:59] know the depth of the need you know what
[1:50:01] need it is in our
[1:50:03] life and Lord I
[1:50:05] pray May every Veil Lord May every
[1:50:09] spiritual Veil whatever might be that
[1:50:12] Lord may be holding someone back lord I
[1:50:16] pray that may Lord God you move down
[1:50:19] lord may they
[1:50:20] respond to your voice
[1:50:23] Lord realizing that they don't have to
[1:50:27] live live beneath their privileges any
[1:50:30] longer they don't have to live Lord God
[1:50:33] a life of
[1:50:35] wondering but Lord God can
[1:50:37] live not by something that we can
[1:50:40] present to you and do this and do that
[1:50:43] no Calvary lifted us
[1:50:46] above not our works as the scripture
[1:50:50] said not of Works lest we should boast
[1:50:54] but it's the grace of God that has come
[1:50:56] teaching us showing us enlightening us
[1:50:59] dealing with our hearts drawing
[1:51:02] us Lord God we want to yield to your
[1:51:05] voice tonight as your sheep as the
[1:51:07] shepherd himself moving through the
[1:51:09] building making known I've paid the
[1:51:11] price you're free my son my daughter you
[1:51:14] don't have to keep hoing along and and
[1:51:16] moving along with that that utensil of
[1:51:18] the world you don't have to hold on to
[1:51:20] that you don't have to be on a slave any
[1:51:23] longer I have made a way for you to walk
[1:51:27] free Hallelujah through my blood that
[1:51:30] has been shed for you I've made a
[1:51:34] way it's not what you can do you can
[1:51:37] never get good enough it's to
[1:51:39] accept what he has done for you accept
[1:51:43] his provided way and walk in it Lord I
[1:51:47] pray God for every other request every

[1:51:53] children Lord Jesus may you minister to
[1:51:57] every
[1:51:58] need Lord I believe that dear God that
[1:52:01] we could all say Lord I want more of you
[1:52:04] I need more of
[1:52:05] you help us
[1:52:07] Lord everything that we would
[1:52:10] receive there's a cost behind
[1:52:15] it sometimes Lord in order to see things
[1:52:18] your Prophet would say if we really want
[1:52:20] to see he said how many is he asked the
[1:52:21] Tabernacle how many want to really see a
[1:52:23] Bible Church he said it's going to cost
[1:52:26] you something he said it'll be a
[1:52:28] sacrifice he said it won't be so much of
[1:52:30] money but it's going to cost you to
[1:52:32] sacrifice some time in prayer sacrifice
[1:52:35] your own ideas sacrifice your own
[1:52:37] thoughts sacrifice your own
[1:52:40] feelings Lord help
[1:52:42] us help us Lord this is what Calvary
[1:52:46] Lord God leads us to it leads us to live
[1:52:50] for one another not just for the people
[1:52:52] people who would we would esteem in our
[1:52:54] own eyes as worthy of us living
[1:52:59] for but Lord your Prophet tells us in
[1:53:01] that message that day on Calvary he said
[1:53:04] live for the man who would kill you if
[1:53:05] he could that's what Jesus
[1:53:10] did he
[1:53:11] lived even when they were crucifying him
[1:53:15] he cried out father forgive them for
[1:53:18] they don't know what they're doing
[1:53:24] oh God help us Lord I pray help us Lord
[1:53:29] May that love of
[1:53:30] God Lord God just Among Us Lord as a
[1:53:34] people Lord God just as it would be Lord
[1:53:37] there in our hearts Lord a relationship
[1:53:39] with you but then Lord it would move
[1:53:41] Lord God throughout the body Lord one to
[1:53:44] another Lord God in our homes Lord oh
[1:53:48] Father I'm sure Lord behind hands
[1:53:50] there's that request is Lord let me be
[1:53:55] more of a servant like he was let me

[1:54:20] but when it comes time Lord God and how
[1:54:22] we have to face that Lord your Prophet
[1:54:25] told us when we cannot Overlook our
[1:54:27] brother's mistakes we've fallen or

[2:03:20] live by what are we living by
[2:03:22] is by that
[2:03:24] Revelation that God loves
[2:03:28] me he did it for me I was always
[2:03:32] included and I was always a part of
[2:03:35] him and when that's that that strikes
[2:03:37] our heart that's why brother Bram he
[2:03:41] makes that
[2:03:42] statement and you know he's he's talked
[2:03:44] about how that we can stand as a
[2:03:46] Believer he says you know he said
[2:03:49] actually he said taking a baby a baby is
[2:03:51] very innocent because a baby's not even
[2:03:54] come to that age of accountability but
[2:03:56] he said every son and daughter of God
[2:03:58] that's been born again is more innocent
[2:04:01] than a
[2:04:03] baby that's what the New Birth has done
[2:04:06] for you and
[2:04:08] [Music]
[2:04:12] I I got a letter in one of my files the
[2:04:15] brothers had given me we sister brother
[2:04:19] Jim
[2:04:20] EDS brother at Dalton out there at
[2:04:23] Pastor Flagstaff Tabernacle his his wife
[2:04:26] had written to brother brandham
[2:04:28] about because she know she was her birth
[2:04:32] was outside of wedlock and she wrote to
[2:04:36] brother bradam she you know was reading
[2:04:37] from the Old Testament all those things
[2:04:40] you know brother bam addresses it later
[2:04:42] on in the message there in ' 64 but he
[2:04:44] wrot wrote back it just he takes he took
[2:04:46] the letter and he just he took the
[2:04:47] letter and then just wrote it up on the
[2:04:49] side he said he said sister Dalton
[2:04:52] he said don't worry about that he said
[2:04:55] the new birth corrected that and all
[2:04:58] every other
[2:05:03] thing that's what the new birth does the
[2:05:06] new birth gives you the
[2:05:09] authority to say that claims that would
[2:05:12] want to come down through that natural
[2:05:14] family tree the new birth gives you the
[2:05:16] authority to say not here not here not
[2:05:21] here
[2:05:22] not here that's what the new birth gives
[2:05:25] you the authority to do what the blood
[2:05:27] of bulls and animals could never take
[2:05:30] away it wasn't strong enough but the
[2:05:33] blood of the Lord Jesus the blood of
[2:05:36] Christ as Peter called it it was strong
[2:05:39] enough to
[2:05:41] deal with every question of
[2:05:44] sin and I tell you
[2:05:46] tonight sure we as Believers we press we
[2:05:50] do press we battle every
[2:05:52] day and how many know there's a
[2:05:55] difference between when it's just
[2:05:57] something you're trying to live to gain
[2:05:58] favor to God and when you know you found
[2:06:01] favor with him there's a rest that's
[2:06:04] come in your heart in your
[2:06:06] life I say let's let's press on no
[2:06:09] matter where you're at in your journey
[2:06:10] press on press on to life you know look
[2:06:13] it's like it's like that salmon we
[2:06:14] talked about brother BR said there's
[2:06:16] only one stream he said there's a stream
[2:06:18] and it only goes one way he said it
[2:06:20] don't go two ways it's only one way but
[2:06:23] you get in that stream and that's a
[2:06:25] spirit of God it's bringing you into
[2:06:26] that stream of life it's taking you
[2:06:28] right into Calvary and it just keeps
[2:06:30] raising you up higher and higher and
[2:06:32] higher and higher and you find the
[2:06:34] things of this world it's not what
[2:06:36] you're trying to stop but you're just
[2:06:38] becoming more in love with him the whole
[2:06:40] time as you're surrendering and it's not
[2:06:42] you stopping it it's sin Stopping
[2:06:46] You Hallelujah because you are always a
[2:06:49] son and daughter of God Amen
[2:06:52] and it's God getting your will lined up
[2:06:55] with his
[2:06:56] will and then it becomes a channel where
[2:06:59] the paralysis is broken where Amnesia is
[2:07:03] done away with and where God moves
[2:07:06] through branches of Sons and Daughters
[2:07:09] of God and manifest his glory don't you
[2:07:13] love him tonight amen aren't you
[2:07:15] thankful for for the price that he
[2:07:18] paid may God help us even as we think
[2:07:22] about it tomorrow I know we'll be in
[2:07:24] different places but even to consider
[2:07:27] that to think about it just to slip away
[2:07:31] Lord thank you for what you've made away
[2:07:33] from me thank you Lord for what you've
[2:07:37] done that I might have life and have it
[2:07:40] more
[2:07:40] abundantly that I might have healing in
[2:07:43] my
[2:07:44] body that I might have strength
[2:07:47] Lord you who are willing as the
[2:07:50] scripture recounts to us he came to such
[2:07:53] he came as it records in The Book of
[2:07:55] Mark when you look up one of the words
[2:07:57] he came to what is would would be
[2:07:59] described the Apex of
[2:08:02] depression he came to that spot those
[2:08:07] words portray that why did he do that
[2:08:11] because he knew some of his children we
[2:08:14] would go through times of depression
[2:08:17] anxiety we would go through situations
[2:08:20] that would come our way
[2:08:22] fear would want to come but he made a
[2:08:25] way that you and I he was
[2:08:29] willing thank you Lord to become
[2:08:33] sin that we might become his
[2:08:37] righteousness he was willing to forsake
[2:08:39] his sunship in order to make Sinners
[2:08:43] Sons he was willing to forsake his peace
[2:08:47] go to the lowest parts of Hell deposit
[2:08:50] the sin and Rise Up on that Easter
[2:08:52] morning he was willing why so you and I
[2:08:54] could have
[2:08:55] peace oh Hallelujah he went somewhere
[2:08:59] where I'll never have to
[2:09:02] go Hallelujah let me tell you tonight
[2:09:05] hell is not made for you the Bible said
[2:09:07] hell was created for the devil and his
[2:09:11] angels I'm glad I'll never have to see
[2:09:14] that
[2:09:16] place I'm thankful that he gave me a
[2:09:19] life he gave me the strength was needed
[2:09:22] I was without
[2:09:23] strength but he provided a way that I
[2:09:25] might receive his strength to live for
[2:09:30] him oh hallelujah what love what love is
[2:09:34] this not that we were worthy not that we
[2:09:37] were righteous but he's the worthy one
[2:09:41] he's the righteous one and when he's
[2:09:43] dealing with your heart don't look at
[2:09:45] yourself look to him who's speaking to
[2:09:49] you because he who speaking to you he's
[2:09:52] the answer the sufficiency the atonement
[2:09:55] all that's needed to take care of
[2:09:57] whatever your need is he's more than
[2:10:01] enough you believe that

[2:11:28] [Music]
[2:11:32] love good evening everyone um the
[2:11:36] company I work at I'm responsible for
[2:11:38] these lamps that go on our machines that
[2:11:39] go for testing and uh while I was
[2:11:44] assembling the boxes and the lamps to go
[2:11:45] in the boxes I only had a certain number
[2:11:48] I said well I got like three or four
[2:11:49] left over and so then I was getting
[2:11:51] towards the end all I found like three
[2:11:53] or four had without we missing what they
[2:11:54] call locking tabs that where the Box
[2:11:56] assembled and it secures it and I looked
[2:11:59] at had one I had there a half a tab I
[2:12:01] said oh okay we're going to cut it close
[2:12:03] so when I got to the last one I put it
[2:12:05] together and I had exact number and then
[2:12:08] I uh I walked off and raised my I said
[2:12:11] my heart I said Thank you Lord for
[2:12:12] helping me with this and a voice said I
[2:12:15] said remember brother Bram said don't
[2:12:17] make yourself weird so I walked back to
[2:12:19] where I was to where I was working I ra
[2:12:21] my hands closed my eyes I said God thank
[2:12:24] you for helping me no matter what it was
[2:12:26] said so then I started thinking about
[2:12:27] the machines that the little tape
[2:12:29] dispensers I used to assemble the boxes
[2:12:31] I had requested them before and I would
[2:12:34] sit there and have to pull the tape out
[2:12:35] and put it on the table in order to put
[2:12:37] the box together and so I asked why
[2:12:38] can't we just buy an electric dispenser
[2:12:41] and they they um they gave me I had some
[2:12:43] books I started looking it up it's like
[2:12:44] $700 just for one the cost and so I said
[2:12:47] okay well I just kept going so I asked
[2:12:49] the boss he don't worry about that said
[2:12:50] okay so I kept going and finally when
[2:12:53] they I guess the word got around to the
[2:12:54] purchasers and they they came down so
[2:12:55] we're going to get one for that's fine I
[2:12:57] that's great so when they finally came
[2:12:58] in I was so glass man now they
[2:13:00] accelerate the work a little quicker and
[2:13:02] so um they said the vice president came
[2:13:04] I said we're going to get you guys
[2:13:05] another one said two that's even better
[2:13:07] yet so both me and the fellow I work
[2:13:09] with we can accelerate the work and so
[2:13:11] then um I started going over where the
[2:13:13] lamps had to be rolled in the cardboard
[2:13:15] and a fell named Barry came by the
[2:13:16] purchaser how's it going that's going
[2:13:18] really good I'm grateful then I felt
[2:13:20] checked a second time
[2:13:21] I said Lord if you give me a second
[2:13:23] chance I'll go talk to him and witness
[2:13:24] to him so then I went on break I was
[2:13:27] going through our assembly of our
[2:13:28] company I ran into him I said Barry Oh I
[2:13:31] said I asked him I said do you believe
[2:13:32] in God I said yes I do I said so do I I
[2:13:35] said you tell those folks who purchase
[2:13:36] those things they are God send that's I
[2:13:38] want to tell you thank you and so then I
[2:13:40] went back and finished it and so then um
[2:13:43] the third thing that happened I saw my
[2:13:45] boss and he through God through he has
[2:13:47] been really generous to me really kind
[2:13:49] to me I saw him walking with o limp I
[2:13:50] said he's suffering something's wrong so
[2:13:53] I started praying for him in my heart
[2:13:54] said Lord if you give me a chance I'll
[2:13:55] go witness to him so that I didn't get a
[2:13:57] chance to do it um today but maybe
[2:14:00] Monday and I said I want to go Express
[2:14:02] to him I said where I go to church we
[2:14:03] pray for the sick I said if you believe
[2:14:05] in God God can heal you whatever it is
[2:14:08] so I just praying for my heart all day
[2:14:09] long for them said Lord be with Tom
[2:14:11] gross my boss who's been really kind and
[2:14:13] generous to me so I just ask and pray
[2:14:16] that God touch him this weekend that
[2:14:17] he'll come back well so no matter what
[2:14:20] it is no matter how small it is if it's
[2:14:22] for yourself or anyone else that God has
[2:14:24] an interest and his desire to make us
[2:14:26] happy no matter how small it is and so I
[2:14:28] look at those two little those black
[2:14:29] boxes which are tape dispensers that I I
[2:14:32] thought I didn't know when I was going
[2:14:33] to get them or I was ever going to get
[2:14:34] them but got they they made my job a
[2:14:36] little easier and makes my heart light
[2:14:38] say God whenever I turn those things I
[2:14:39] I'm grateful to God that I have a little
[2:14:41] tool that helps me at my job that he's
[2:14:43] provided for me thank you Lord Jesus
[2:14:47] amen

[2:15:23] who valued his his riches and his
[2:15:25] father's riches over over over uh over
[2:15:28] his relationship with God but may we go
[2:15:31] through our lives Lord help us to check
[2:15:32] if there's anything in our life that
[2:15:33] we're valuing more than it should be and

[2:15:39] God Lord forgive us Lord Jesus show it
[2:15:41] to us Lord we'll make it right Lord and
[2:15:43] help us to give those things up Lord so
