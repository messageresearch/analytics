source of strength lord that anchor o god that is within the veil that lord just like that of a boat or a ship that anchored lord is cast finds its place in a solid hole upon a rock that though the winds may blow and the waves may come that vessel o god is tied to that which is solid lord oh god though the winds and though the waves might come lord and blow upon our flesh and upon our spirit oh god when we've been anchored within the veil there is a place of surety in your word that we are standing on we are resting on oh god that lord no matter how the winds might blow there is a steadfastness in our life lord knowing that in whom we have believed that god you are able to keep everything that we've committed to you against that day lord we thank you o god in this hour lord jesus what a precious reality it is that revelation inside of our hearts oh god that's you lord that's you it's not a thought it's not an imagination it's you it's that part lord of yourself o god that you've divided and come to take occupancy in your word that you provided that seed that life o god lord just help us to get out of the way help us lord i pray may you bless your children tonight lord god just direct us lord in your word you see what every need is here before us lord those that lord would god be streaming it lord archiving it later you know the needs of your children lord we ask that god that you'll minister in a very personal way father let me just step aside lord that you can come because that's what we need we need to hear from you father i ask that you just lord bless the meetings those youth meetings that are going on right now lord oh god is he just asking lord that you'll just take every part every servant of god lord just to be under that inspiration god i'm asking that may there be every life that's gathered there be filled with the spirit of god may you move lord i pray in a mighty way oh god for the lord you're the one who's more than a match for every devil you're more than a match for this age that we live in granted lord may every heart come to know you in that way may each life lord move into a deeper experience we not only ask that for that gathering there but we ask it for our lives here tonight as well we want a deeper experience with you lord may you just come and just pass by our way father jesus precious name amen amen god bless you this evening listen if we could let's turn into the word of the lord before we're seated and then i'll maybe make just a few announcements but joshua chapter 5 and verse 13 if we could go there i just want to come back into this portion of scripture here tonight and just taking the thought under his guidance under his guidance remembering when we i've read the quote and i'm not gonna just refer to it tonight where brother branham is mentioning of our when we're praying and how that we are approaching the promises of god he says once you've come into the promised land he said then you'll find how prayer changes and he says how that we we make that approach for everything that's there before us knowing that god has given us the land and we can stand right there in the face of the enemy and say get off of my property and brother brown makes a key statement he says with that abstract in our hand he says and under the guidance of the holy spirit we adjure satan to take his hands off and i think that's that's where we come to is under his guidance every promise in the book it belongs to us but god has a specific way in his will that continues to unfold that that promise might come to pass and here let's look in joshua 5 and verse 13. here we stand and it says it came to pass that when joshua was by jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand and joshua went unto him and said unto him art thou for us or for our adversaries and he said nay but as captain of the host of the lord am i now come and joshua fell on his face to the earth and did worship and said unto him what saith my lord unto his servant it's a very very key very key point in this battle and the captain of the lord's host said unto joshua loose thy shoe from off thy foot for the place where on thou standest is holy and joshua did so amen may god bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated i wanted to just mention to you you've seen uh major probably seen the posts and the emails and things like that with the calendar events and um also here lord willing and this is always weather permitting here with um to have just a i guess we'd titled it just a fire pit fellowship it's not a full-blown mill um it's just uh we just want to get together just for some fellowship it will be on certain times on sunday evenings maybe at times you know when we're scheduled it will let you know but this coming sunday the lord willing at five o'clock we'll um right back there you'll see behind um the building right back here um where the shane was able to put the fire pit together there for us and we so appreciate that and also getting the dirt and we needed the dirt in here and then getting the dirt and i don't know was that wheel barreled or was that tractor over there he was wheel uh we appreciate that too and appreciate you know brother shane was looking out for that he said we don't want no ankles being twisted along there and and so we still have to watch it out here and that's going to be filled in with dirt as well so we just appreciate all that they were communicating about that so lord willing this coming sunday evening if weather permitting at five o'clock we'll just gather back here and just to have just some time just to fellowship and just remind you just to bring comfortable chairs because i'm sure you don't want to sit on folding chairs so you have lawn chairs and so forth you know just bring comfortable chairs you know to to sit in and we'll just have just a little time of fellowship and if you're able to make it well that'd be wonderful is that all right amen so uh with that in mind i just just looking here into the scripture and you know when we look at this portion of the word and i think of this very much because of the time that we're living in we know that we are standing in another ephesians and we know that ephesians itself is where that there is a coming out and a going into we know that it's necessary of how that god would call our lives out of the world and it takes the call that comes from him to come out of the world to bring a separation to bring conviction in our life to realize that there is there is there is something deeper there is something wrong you know a person can actually sit in a church for a long time but then once they hear the word of god to realize that god is calling to them to come out beyond all their unbelief and unbelief itself is not just you know is is that of attributes attributes of unbelief drinking smoking lusting and all that that's all attributes of unbelief but unbelief itself is what god as he came to deal with to where that we're not just acceptive of some promises and make excuses as to why that some promises can't be but to recognize that the god who made the promise he's the god to fulfill the promise he's never he's not been diminished he's not lost any power it doesn't matter how wicked that the age has become god has not diminished in power whatsoever man's mind when man has gone away from god's way of approaching the word and the approach of the word is by the holy spirit it's under god's leadership it's the supernatural in reality when we look at it that in order to be a real believer you've got to be born of the supernatural and there are experiences that in your life that you can have of the supernatural and if not then all this book is is a collection of stories but once the holy spirit who is the author of the book the bible tells us that the prophets men of old who were set aside as vessels that the inspiration of god could drop down and be able to give utterance and inspiration and then through that the holy spirit he inspires the word to where it's no longer just a book of history but it's a book of prophecy when we read in the scriptures and have been identified with the living god we're not just looking at the red sea as an event that happened to a group of people back there but we have experienced a god who makes a way we've experienced that same god and no matter what comes our way that experience is what takes us through through every situation every opposition everything that we can ever face we come right back to say i know that he's the living god what he did for them he will do for me as well so you know it's like in this one in this way where you know brother branham would say it in the message great warrior joshua he would say when they look at the word and say well the word is not able to work he said oh yes the word is able to work it only takes the author who gave the word to make it to work and so when we are looking at this this ephesians i feel like this i don't just feel i i know that this is a parallel of where you and i are living because joshua it types the walk and the life of a holy ghost filled believer that there there are promises and and you know even to desire the holy spirit you're blessed because many don't have any desire for that and that's the bible blessed are they who do hunger thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled it's a it's a blessing to have a call in your life that it says there's got to be more a blessing that when you can hear the word of god dealing with your life and you realize that there's more than just where i'm at and and that goes on in our walk with god it doesn't stop when you receive the holy ghost it keeps on there there is something that is raised up in you a love for the things of god that you desire to have more of god and and in knowing that he's all that you need in every part of your life and so this is very fitting for even the time that you and i are living in when we look at this with joshua because we know that there are promises that are here that are right before us and i want you just to look at this in in this manner that joshua he knew that jericho was the first objective uh we don't have anything uh maybe in the scripture that would where we can read that the lord told joshua to go and take jericho first but he knew by inspiration even before crossing the river that this was the first place to take and so we know he sent the spies out but i want to bring us into this line of thought right here tonight so the question itself that joshua had was not was was not about whether or not it was the will of god to take jericho but rather the question was how and you'll find that this is something that you and i are brought face-to-face face-to-face with one of the ways time and time again there are things that we can look at and we know to be the will of god how do we know it's the will of god well it's not by feeling it's not by an impression because of feeling or impression if it deviates from the word then we forsake it but we know that it's the will of god when it is with the word of god if there's anything in the word that would speak against that then we know it's not the will of god now we might have difficulty maybe as a new christian or it doesn't matter where you're at in your journey you might be looking and saying even of knowing scripture knowing the message and yet looking at things and saying lord is this according to your will because the will of god goes much deeper than just the print on the page the will of god comes down into our motive and our objective on wanting to see god's will fulfilled that's another part of it and that's all that lays within there that god would would call and would speak to our lives so many things we come to in the will of god that we look at you know even when you look at the any promise that is there before us any promise that god has made such as the holy ghost and deliverance well there's not a question of is this god's will that i received the holy ghost is it god's will that i be made whole there's not a question about that that is the will of god but the how is the question what's the pathway what's the channel and that's always that's the part that where it brings us into that place of relying upon the holy spirit even though being filled with the spirit of god that brings us to that place of being led by the holy spirit there are times that let me go to another part of it there are times that we're praying and seeking whether something is the will of god joshua knows jericho is the will of god he doesn't know the how but there are times that you and i are praying and we're seeking for god's will maybe it's choices that we have before us it's choices that we're looking at maybe it's jobs where to live church home on and on these are choices that we have before us and god's not going to make the choices for us even if you know even of those of us that are married know that there had to be there was choices set before us and and there had to be a decision made and and even young people and others that come into that place you see paul haven had choices before him and paul just like you and i paul was was looking at do i go this way and take the man take the word of god do i go to asia or do i go to macedonia he did not know which way to go but paul said the bible said he assayed or tested if it would be god's will to go this way but notice in testing it he hadn't fully committed to going to asia at that moment but yet in a dream because he had tested and saying lord this is how i'm feeling but still what is your will concerning this i i believe that that's that's victory right there in our lives is knowing the the the promises and the power and the authority the blessing the peace the rest that comes from being in the will of god and paul could test just like you and i contest certain things it doesn't mean that we have committed to doing it but you can test it and say lord this is what i'm feeling but even though my feeling and i'm leaning this way what is your will and when we're left open to that that means we're always left open to what is your say on this you see we're living in the time when the amen has spoken and the amen is the final word the amen is the soviet and the bible speaks to you and i from the book of isaiah tying us into that future home that we in ourselves receive the blessing of god by blessing ourselves in the god of the amen and that's what we seek for in our lives we want to know not what we say but what does the amen say within this i know sometimes we can pray and we're trying to pull something out of god but that's not really praying when we pray it's not trying to pull something out you realize brother branham when he had to bring cornet correction even when brother neville you know it we believe in tongues we believe in prophecy we believe in interpretations but brother branham showing us that even where there were those who coming to be prayed for there were certain things they were trying to pull to be said in their way and it caught brother neville yielded to it and he spoke things and the holy spirit had to bring correction because he was being pulled according to what the desires were we don't want our desires that god has to come down to our desires we want our desires to match god's desires and first of all say lord if my desires aren't matching yours remedy that in my life and then asking god fulfill your desire in me we don't want to try to pull him any certain way and you know well you know lord i'm feeling we don't want to do that because we know within that is never peace is never rest if we have to pull something we'll have to keep pulling and keep propping and everything else because it will be our work and paul paul remember god sent a man dressed in a dream in macedonian garb and let paul know do not go to toward asia at this time but come then go this way you realize that only a chapter two chapters later in the book of acts that paul was sent into asia right you and i might look at it and say well why couldn't he go at that time because it wasn't god's timing it wasn't god's way and god part of god's will is always his timing is always his way is the how behind it ezra and just giving you another example in ezra and when you read this in the scripture i always loved this in ezra chapter 8 where ezra he's returning back into jerusalem after they've been in babylon and ezra is returning back with treasuries and everything that's going to go in the house of god and everything that's to be put in there the furniture and all those things that were there in babylon when they had been exiled and carried away now ezra is coming forth and he comes to the river of uh and ezra stands there and he realizes between us and jerusalem there's a lot of bandits there's a lot of people that with all of the treasuries that we're carrying this is a lot of value and ezra realizes at that moment he says i've already given testimony to the king that the hand of the lord is upon us so i'm not going to go back to him and say hey could you give us some accompaniment down here to jerusalem ezra said i couldn't do that i've already testified god's hand is upon this but he recognized that that moment he had access to the throne of god to the one that had led him to that place he knew like joshua coming back to jerusalem bringing these treasuries was the will of god but how to do it is what we need to know and through prayer and fasting they all begin through prayer and fasting god came down and he answered to take what was there and divide it out and portion it out among the levites and they would all travel in their way and then come there to jerusalem and you find that though every one of those portions that were given out and came back to jerusalem when they met there everything was just as it was when they divided it boy we could preach on the holy ghost right now but you recognize that when they found the will of god as far as the how to it then there was a rest is everybody with me so there's different times and different things that we're looking at with the will of god in our journey in our life and notice the scripture that you and i would be an identification for of the bride of jesus christ in this hour and would be that of john 5 19. for the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father doing that doeth the son likewise that is a scriptural identification because whatever it was with the bridegroom it will be with the bride that's why you can look at anything that isn't going according to the word of god is not open to the channel of the voice of god you know it's not the bride because the bride walks in step with the groom because she is one with him just like a uh you know a wife would be to her husband she is to reflect the ambitions and the desires and all the plans of even of that man is that right so notice that within this there is a harmony that that is present or is to exist within the bride of jesus christ now first john 5 14 this is the confidence that we have in him and if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us and if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him now notice of this certainty if we have a confidence in him what confidence john do we have well the confidence that we have that if we ask anything according to his will that he hears us and that these petitions that that we have what we have desired of him that that he will hear us and whatsoever that we ask well what's the sign that he's hearing us is god is working in our lives and moving to perform his word does it always happen right then and there no because if god did it just like that we would become even more impatient than what we are we would become more you know with that of impatience and you know reliant upon that instead of relying upon god now notice prayer itself there is the key that opens every door if you're standing before a door like joshua was he knew jericho was the will of god but there's a key to open that door and that key to open that door brother bram says it like this he says the key to every mystery the key to open every door of everything that is of god is through prayer he says it like this when he's ministering in the revelation series uh chapter 4 and brother branham lays this in here and this just really grabbed the hold of my attention here uh you know the other day brother baby said it like this he says you know the song that there's only one way he said that to ever get the blessings of god and he said like this he rehearses the song let's pray pray pray the only way to reach higher ground pray pray the prayer faith will bring god's blessings down so if the prayer of faith brings god's blessings down let's continue to pray brother graham goes on to talking about you know continuing to pray to be further in to the kingdom of god and on up the road now remember here is joshua's standing here and he's walking around jericho and he's looking at the walls the bible tells us here when we read he came around the walls and joshua he's out there on the plane and he's looking at it and joshua is wondering when he's looking at the way of what is god's way of how god has planned to do this now i'll tell you what that takes patience he already knew it was god's objective that jericho was the will of god now here comes patience to come and say now that we're here we've crossed over and he has patience now to approach the will before god's way to be made known because when god's made known his will you see when god lets him know jericho you're to take jericho joshua just to go without knowing the way is to go presuming joshua would have been frustrated does he know it's the will of god without a shadow of doubt he knows it's god's will but he's looking for the how to it and that's where we come to you can take anything in your life whether it's any promise any promise that pertains there is a way for that promise to be fulfilled now let me just let me just dial in here just a moment that way is not five steps to a better this or two steps to this remember there is only one way and god is that way there's two ways to anything right you heard brother wayne preach this we've preached this over the time see it only applied to the new birth it comes down to every aspect of our life there's always two ways our way and god's way and guess whose way is always wrong our way and whose way is always right god's way always two ways to every promise of god now faith itself joshua has a faith when he's going and he's asking in confidence he's letting the petitions be known lord what is the way into this city how are we going to take this city down now faith it is a revelation of the will of god and i i want to just just just just go upon this just a moment when you look at the word and notice the promise that god has given them about treading down the promises or treading upon what belongs to them let me read a few scriptures here in deuteronomy 11 25 god speaks through moses there shall no man be able to stand before you for the lord your god shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that you shall tread upon as he said to you in deuteronomy 33 29 happy art towel israel who is like unto thee o people saved by the lord the shield of thy help who is the sword of thy excellency and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee and thou shalt tread upon their high places now in joshua chapter one verse three now joshua has heard this he's been a partaker of this as for the rest of israel has but now it's come down personally joshua's heard the message but see the messenger has come and gone moses delivered the message remember moses god gave that message to moses and god was not gonna let that that message fail it didn't matter how many unbelievers were there then they looked and said we can't take the land that the giants are too big and this and this that didn't mean anything to god god's message will never fail and about the time it looks like it's going to fail that's when god steps in god always steps in at that time like in eden when it looked like it was nothing but failure all around god stepped in and god let it be known my message is not a failure [Music] god meant everything he said he said everything he meant and god will bring it to pass in his own time i find it remarkable in the first message the prophet preaches in the message shalom out of the two and he takes that time it's almost like where he is he's actually sitting in a living room setting and he's ministering any and he's dealing with the fulfillment of the word that is that we are actually under in this hour to see the fulfilling of all things the the end of the time is here just seeing those things that you know it speaks of how the pope you know going to visit jerusalem and then the moon has the phases of the moon right there in the sky of that week it went to a complete darkness and a blackness and he ties it in with you know melchizedek you know coming to meet abraham melchizedek was kicked out of the churches and just as christ was put out of the church and he meets him there just before he gets back home and brother bram is laying all this out of the time that you and i and where we are at and then he comes to the end of the message and he says what we must have brethren is patience he said because some can get under a an impression or an enthusiasm and they're trying to make something come to pass and you cannot make things come to pass this is why the bible think of this the bible doesn't contradict itself the bible says let a man study to show himself worthy is that right the bible encourages us to get into the word of god right but then the bible over here in the old testament i believe it's the book of proverbs that much study weareth oneself what is much steady is where one is trying to prove and trying to press there is no revelation nothing that comes from god by our own efforts into something we can we should give ourselves we should read how many times has this happened to us we're listening to the message we're reading in the scriptures we're we're just you know in fellowshipping with the lord and just things that maybe we don't we can't see or maybe don't even see the real of the application and it coming down personally and you get into service and maybe it's after that service you're you're out on your job or you're somewhere out and the spirit of god just takes that and opens that to you and you say oh there it is and it's an application to your life it's not something that you've pried your way into you've been led into it oh i wish i could stay there a moment you've been led into it now just stay with me here on this thought because i believe that's the inspiration at this moment notice joshua has heard this now comes the sounding to him personally every place in joshua 1 3 every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon now the message has announced to all of these promises all this land belongs to you but now you've got to put your foot down you've got to move into the promises joshua everywhere you place your foot should tread upon i've given you as i spoke to moses and he goes through all the dimensions in verse 4. that word tread means to march it means to move forward upon now treading itself is moving under the leadership into the promises of god it's marching forward with the authority of the word of god under the guidance of the holy spirit so it's not us uh forcing our way into something you see when we were even to think about let me just step back just a moment even as we're looking and uh i believe we were looking at this a little bit last week that when we speak about footsteps our possession and that how that all the promises are for us we recognize that it's not up to us to determine the how something's going to be it's not us footsteps being possession simply means that that word is ringing to my heart and i'm going to stand upon that word i'm going to call that word and that promise mine but if you call it yours with already a way that it's going to happen or this is the way it's going to be you'll find yourself defeated the word has never been defeated never the word has never ever suffered a loss but it's in those moments god's bringing a real practical application to our lives realizing that it must be me fulfill my word through you that's the whole victory right there is god fulfilling his word through our life so this this treading is marching in the promises of god i want you to think of it in this term when you look at john in revelations 1 the bible said he was in the spirit on the lord's day and he heard the voice behind him it spake like a trumpet now the trumpet was a signification this was god speaking it had meaning to him are you with me this goes back to the thing some things that we said at the beginning part of the service this morning uh this evening that it's a blessing to desire the spirit of god because the message goes out but it's only sent to the elect god's got an intended audience let him that hath and ear let him hear what the spirit is saying everybody can hear it and others can say well that's just another just another man just like moody or anybody else or this is just like this well god always has used vessels that's true but god has messengers and messengers are those who are reflecting the trueness and the purity and power of the atonement into the church of the living god a messenger is one who's got a message now a man can have a message but where does he get that message from if that message is contrary to the word he never got that message from god is that right but god has vessels every one of those seven messengers are stars that were ordained for a distinct time and an age to be used by god that the promise that god desired to come to pass in that age you know that promise they would become so entwined and taken with that promise they would become one with that promise it would it would kind of say like this it would eat up their entire life if it did that way to the messengers what does it do upon the people of god it eats up our life it it it's just moving and he become it's the full pulsation and desire of our life sometimes i know we can think well you know i i really desire and i really you know i i really you know people can say well i really desire you know of the lord and i i really love the lord but are you treading on ground are you marching are you marching or or are you still in the place that you were before it's time to move it's time to move if you listen if you don't walk in the light while light is present darkness will overtake you satan can send all kinds of distractions to try to hinder that voice there's a lot of voices in the world in today is that right but there's one voice that has true leadership and that's the voice of the holy spirit not the voice of man's reasoning but the voice of the holy spirit so here is john he turns and looks to see the voice because he knows a voice is a person he he don't turn to feel something he turns to see i want to see who's talking to me that voice has caused him to turn oh my and now notice he turns to see it the bible tells us now in revelations 4 the after the end of those things after the ages have passed the coming to the end of the church ages and here he says that same voice that i heard before that spake with me it spake to me again and it told me come up hither because i'm going to show you things that are to come what is it it would be a rapturing message a message that is catching us away from this worldly sphere and gravity and drawing us away from all unbelief you know what that voice was that voice is the voice of god in this last day that has called us into and ephesians into the promises of god because every word of god is a trumpet when god steps down and begins to sound that trumpet it is an alarm to the people of god start treading on promises what authority do i have the highest authority there could ever be god has spoken let tell me what devil can prophesy what one could raise his head up and say well that ain't so bad him for you god has spoken shut your mouth god has spoken to me come on friends it's time to tread upon the promises hallelujah now with the treading remember the scripture we read this is the confidence that we have in him if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us and the lord jesus over and over in the scriptures he was not forgetting what he was saying he was not just repeating remember through the gospels they're capturing what has taken place in matthew notice where it wrote in matthew if that faith would say faith would speak to this mountain and there be no doubt within your heart nothing to hinder what's matthew the lion there's a courage there's a boldness that this is my promise that belongs to me say to this mountain be thou removed plucked up and cast into yonder sea and the very next scripture says and whatsoever you ask ye shall ask in prayer and receive it amen now think of this in john 14 uh uh 12 he that believeth on me the works that i do shall you do also greater works than these because i go to the father and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the son if you shall ask anything in my name i will do it what's his name it's his will his character oh my you see this asking and praying is not just you know just saying little words but it's asking god and looking at things and listen this is part of a journey it's part of experience a pastor can't hand you this like a manual like oh this is how you do it it's part of our journey with almighty god that we need god to remedy if our heart is not matching god's desire we might be praying about something but we don't have our desires right in it and so we can't say well i'm asking this according to your name this is in your word lord but god said but your desires are not lined up right the desires is all about it's all about you notice this word ask the word ask means right here in the scriptures from what we're praying to ask to beg to call for to crave desire or to require it kind of it puts you to the reality of why the spirit of this age says i'm rich increased with goods and i don't need to ask you for no more because i've got it all lord you've given us a full message well he has but the way in taking the promises of god is by treading is by asking is as the word of god is sounding to our lives so god wants us to ask him for things i hope this doesn't stumble you but it brings us to a place to understand joshua would have never known what the plan was for the walls of jericho had he not asked i want you to think about that's real deep if he didn't even have a desire to want to know i look at that in the book of revelation where it said i heard that voice and then the next scripture said immediately i was in the spirit of the lord see that word it come to a place where john where the spirit of god was speaking and he was right in tune with the word to say yes lord be it unto me caught away go with me tonight it's just that simple that you see it's not that's why for the bride we're not being pulled into things or pushed into things we're being cut away the word is speaking and see it starts right here and listen you can sit right here tonight and say well man i know i'm not there yet but what does your heart say within it if your heart says yea lord be it unto me according to thy will you know what you're doing you're loosening every tie so you can be caught away in his presence hallelujah that's the simplicity of treading treading is not looking at yourself treading is looking to the voice that is speaking to you and you know the things that we pray for it becomes more personal in our journey because things start coming to light more and more in our journey we start recognizing complex as we have or have developed we start right we recognize our insufficiencies and you know the blood of jesus christ does not take away our insufficiencies the blood of jesus christ cleanses us that the spirit of god the life of that blood may come and set in the midst of us and here we are surrounded by infirmity surrounded by weakness surrounded in a place to where god has called and desires these things to be done and we look at ourself as paul could stand there in romans 7 and say the things that i want to do and desiring yet i find not how to perform them you know why of looking how to perform it listen romans 7 that speaks of a converted man but what paul is recognizing within it there's a battle there's a war but looking within it that the power that is needed what's being called for it's not by my not by power but by my spirit saith the lord so the performing of god's will is us comes to pass by us yielding our will that's really the kernel of tonight let me just abolish it just a few moments here because everything becomes very personal to us every promise that god has given us is yea and amen is that right now notice within that brother braham said he can't change he said but god will do things in unexpected ways but hold on until it comes now god will do things in unexpected ways just keep that just a moment don't tell god how you want him to do it you see that's what the churches have done they've told god this is how people are going to be members all they got to do is put their name on the book and shake the hand or believe these tendents or believe these creeds or all they got to do is believe this man has told tried to tell god but this is god's program not man's program god don't need some net wit brain telling him how to do things this is why brother brown said we must pray until we come back into god's program that's what the message of the hour has come to do is bring us back into god's program not a church program a man's program but god's program where god leads his people god leads the church in your everyday life god's leading you and you've got confidence just like joshua you might be going before jobs you might be going a situation of a spouse you might be going right there before children you whatever it is and you're going there and saying i know that this is god's will but how you're not questioning how if god's able to do it because you know him i said you know him and you know he specializes in things that are impossible he changed your life that was impossible for one man to change another man a man cannot change a woman and a woman can't change a man it takes god to bring a change on the inside a church can't change you but it takes the holy ghost to bring a change in your life that's god's way of doing it so he said you don't tell god what you want him to do he will do it the way he wants to do it don't tell him he said how to do it now when it says unexpected ways unexpected in terms of how we're thinking about it right remember that little example on sunday that i gave you the little sister was told by the lord don't fly home today stay in the stadium for this meeting there's going to be prayer and you're going to receive you're going to be the third one called what was her way of thinking about it same way you and i would have thought about it well that means i'm going to get prayer card number three but when it was said we're gonna start from the end which was at a hundred and we're going to come backwards right and here she had card number 97 the third one from it you you know what brother brandon is bringing out but her way of thinking about it our way of thinking about it she was a little discouraged but you know what she had to rest on god you told me to stay here now what i'm saying don't make sense but i'm surrendering my will to you what if that little lady would have just got all upset and said god you made me miss my plane lord jesus you made this happen lord and this see that's the difference between imagination and god speaking the bible said they that know their god shall do great exploits i tell you you're looking for great exploits one of the greatest exploits there is is to be equipped with the holy ghost and to overcome yourself daily hallelujah what greatness what mightiness what power to subdue your own reasoning subdue your own self and silence every voice [Music] god's got a way of doing it david would write about it in psalm 77 19 i'm trying to get there thy way is in the sea and thy path in the great waters and thy footsteps are not known in ecclesiastes 3 11 he hath made everything beautiful in his own time also he has set the world in their hearts so that no man can find out the work that god maketh from the beginning to the end can i read that one to you in the amplified he has made everything beautiful in his time he has also planted eternity in men's hearts and minds a divinely implanted sense of a purpose working through the ages which nothing under the sun but god alone can satisfy yet so that man cannot find out what god has done from the beginning to the end hallelujah doesn't it even amaze you in your own life of what god has done in your life and where he's brought you to right now you can't find it out his footsteps are unknown to the natural mind romans 11 33 all the death of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of god how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out every promise god has made in his word he will perform it and god will answer it in his own way let me come back to the scriptures we've read for our text joshua comes there through prayer and you read in the scriptures joshua he goes towards that of the walls of jericho he's getting out to himself you know there's times in our life that we have to get along with god right and when i when we talk about that brother banham let's leave it in the scripture how the lord jesus would he went alone to pray and brother branham picks it up i believe in one of the blind bartimaeus messages and i quoted it here where he said there's every one three times he said where man just has to get off to himself and you know there's times where we're getting off to silence every other thought and every other voice and every other thing around and just to get alone and just to wait upon god because we don't always have the alone times like that are you hearing me we don't always have that but yet as believers we are always praying you're praying when you're on your job you're praying when you're driving in the car don't let prayer be something where you got to be on your knees because you can't limit it to a position of your body paul said stand praying david was laying prostrate right here we have this where paul said pray without ceasing praying always with all prayer and supplication so there's things that it's going to come see being in fellowship with the lord there's things that comes to your heart you know with my wife and i there there are the times where we sit down and sometimes we get to do that you know of a of an evening and just have our have our coffee together after we've ate dinner and things and just just to be able to talk but then there's other times that throughout the day and here and there that we kind of you know pass and say hey don't forget to make that announcement hey don't forget about this hey you have you taken care of this for for so and so schooling have you see those little things that have to be done that comes to her mind we come and talk about it right but those are things that that just need to be attended to but then there's times where we can just sit down and we just talk that's the same way it is with the lord there's things that comes to you throughout the day and it's quick sentences it's quick things that comes and maybe there's a prayer request maybe somebody comes on your heart lord be with brother joshua lord touch my brother strength of my brother and you go on there's things that god can bring to your heart you know being in tune with god god can bring things to your heart that things in your life that we need to die to and you can just simply say at that moment you might be putting on a not on on a screw at that time and say lord help me lord jesus you know what you're doing you're surrendering your will to his will if you can recognize who's there when you're doing that it's the same one that met joshua and your walk has invited him to reveal himself and say as leader as captain of the lord's house am i now come it's just that simple oh god help us to be that simple help us lord to live even from this moment on in that simplicity and recognizing and you know not beating yourself up in your mind about well i didn't have you know 45 minutes in the closet today or half we believe in times and getting away in prayer don't we all that needs to be but you understand i think god brought a very good example to us right here that we all can relate to and we do not have to walk around to feed it but to realize we have a relationship with an almighty god and he's ever present and right there at any time we are ready to talk to him as a matter of fact sometimes it just is a good time brother brian to say lord i love you lord i thank you lord things you begin to think about what the lord has done you say thank you lord lord it's just good to be here why it's a relationship right there's times that for my wife when i see her in the house and i'm just saying honey i love you i might just be passing on out of the office going by to get another cup of coffee and you know just make a compliment and go ahead and go oh how much more is it with the lord jesus glory be to god now let me let me finish this part here in verse 14 and joshua fell on his face to the earth and did worship and said unto him what saith my lord unto his servant if we can recognize it this is where the battle was won the battle was not won when the wall started coming down the battle was won when joshua recognized his position you're the leader you're the word and i'm your servant i might be the general of this army i might be the husband of this home i might be the pastor of the church i'm on and on but you're the leader of my life and that's where the victory was won you say well god hadn't even made known anything to joshua about the walls at that time that's true he hadn't made known to him this is how it's going to happen but the victory was won at that moment because he surrendered his will to the will of god and many say lord that's me i want it to be me lord i want to surrender my will in your presence heavenly father lord jesus as we just stop here tonight boy help us father we each and everyone find ourselves when it comes to the how the how of it is being able lord to recognize your presence but lord i think of how that joshua he went he went out there and they went out to seek you father i pray that god that may you so help each one of us as you've spoke to us so clearly lord that prayer is an ongoing lord communion with you talking with you speaking with you not just at reserves specified times praying always and realizing that god as joshua went out to seek for the way that you had planned to take it that at that moment you appeared to him and revealed yourself that i'm the leader lord i'd say no doubt here tonight and lord even in coming times in our lives that we have stood maybe our standing and we'll stand in these moments where we lord god if we just go to you in prayer we don't know how things are going to happen i don't know how this situation is going to be resolved i don't know how this is going to take place i don't know how it's going to move from here but i know that god this is according to your will i've examined lord my heart examined lord my motives my objectives the best of my ability lord that you have given me lord and i continue to submit it before you lord if there's anything that's out of line that's not right remedy my heart lord so that it matches your thought upon the word of promise that you have given lord may we lord i pray may we approach you lord may lord each one lord gather right here those are under the sound of my voice those that lord would stream this later on lord and go back and archive it may it be lord even in this moment to recognize if we can just lord get away and begin to seek after you lord jesus lord that's where even as we go on even in our our day of work and times the lord as we're going on we're desiring to know the will of god lord that's the lord where you will draw nigh unto us because according to your word you said draw nigh unto me draw nine to god and he will draw nigh unto you lord i can't think of any greater any greater one to come among us than you lord because it's your will it's your plan that you have set forth lord for lord our lives and for what we have before us we need and we desire to hear from you help us no matter what it is lord in front of us may we lord god surrender our will to you may we pray lord god until we're just in your presence lord because it's in your presence but lord god where we release ourselves granted lord i pray for each one tonight in the name of jesus christ amen let go and let god have his one good for way [Music] let go and let god [Music] [Music] and you're nightstand today just let go and let god [Music] [Laughter] [Music] is god [Music] it'll vanish [Music] [Music] oh [Music] just let go yes lord help us is [Applause] [Music] let god [Music] when our backs were against the wall and it looked [Music] and we're standing

put that richer [Applause] way down in my soul he's got it all in control [Music] i [Music] though it's in [Music] [Music] he's got it all in control [Music] he's got it all in control put that reassurance way down in my soul [Music] he's got it all in control my father knows [Music] my father knows what i need my father knows the sword i need so every trial i go he knows what's best for me my father knows what i need amen thank you jesus aren't you thankful for his leadership thank you jesus thankful for his guidance amen that he's not a myth he's not a father amen him god would so divide himself into the lives of his children and you know that that place that he had reserved for himself even though that belonged to him that seed on the inside it belonged to him but he cannot override and he did not override our own will that's right but he had to work on us through his loving kindness to where our self will would match his will and when our self will matches his will that's when death to self comes that's the mystery of death to self when our will becomes his will then his will his life comes into us and you begin to realize truly all things have become new lord i i'm just looking to you for your leadership you've got a confidence a comfort in him to know he's my guide he'll never leave me anywhere that he's not big enough to take care of me he'll guide me and direct me in every part of my life all that his purpose is to be fulfilled in my life amen he'll guide me you know there's a trust that's called faith that comes about in our life and you know what it is it's god operating through that part in us that's really him that part in us that's really him because what does it display him what does a son or daughter do with the same you display the attributes of sean derek your grandfather and on and on right daughters you you know you displayed the attributes of you know your father sister lily brother matt howdy it comes on down right right certain things what is it it's because it's there within your dna yes amen how much more for a son and daughter of god it's not in our natural dna it's in that spiritual dna on the inside amen and so
