lord help me help the congregation lord just to be able to step out of the way lord god you've come lord take a gift lord that you've placed in my life born and just be able to use it lord just like a microphone god to speak to our hearts lord god tonight lord you know lord everything lord those that are gathered here those that are kept for by the way lord we just invite you for it because without you we can do nothing so we just pray your god may you come forward get right into the word oh god where the word lord it moves to become a living word your god to discern the very thoughts and intents of the heart lord and impart life to us father we just ask these things lord tonight you're gone asking lord just a special request for there's many is brother brian read those requests tonight more there's many different needs it's among us these lords it's upon the hearts of your children here tonight and lord we just invite your presence lord we pray that god could be with sister michelle lord god of the family they are a very tragic lord that dear god we ask you for leadership and guidance lord in the midst of this time lord and comfort lord to the family lord we ask all these things now in the name of jesus christ amen amen which one praise the lord i know some of my buddies they like handhelds but i don't like them i told them i said you give me a handheld i stutter i can't move my hands but we just we thank the lord for his mercy and so grateful that the lord just just helped us to get that straightened out and just continue the different requests and things that you heard mentioned here some of the different needs just continue you know as as always just to keep them before the lord in prayer and sometimes when you maybe don't see someone here you know and i know it's kind of hard in the time that we're in because you don't always know who's here and who is in here but you know when someone comes on your heart just take them to the lord in prayer you don't have to be in your prayer closet if you're just even maybe you're driving down the road just pray for him right then god is mindful amen for each and every need and so let's just look here in the word of the lord in first corinthians chapter 13 verse 4. charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity wanteth not itself and is not puffed up may god bless the reading of the word bless you as you're being seated brother brian maybe just just a little bit here in the morn just turn it down just a little bit i don't know what got out of cater but it's okay nobody's going to blame you for it we want to look here a little bit more as the lord's been taking us on this with the love of god you know when we're we're looking at it and i i think our brother branham was just coming across it here the other day brother branham was looking at you know and mentioning of how that when the spirit of god he says we come into his presence and the lord just begins to just to deal with our lives there's things that sometimes we can begin to see even unbeknown to ourselves and certain things that become to light that we were not even aware of and meaning that it's things that could have taken place uh in our life and things that brother brown talks about mistakes and different things he said we know there's a blood that is present that is able to take care of each one of those you know sometimes the way when when the spirit of god comes in the light in which that we're able to examine it by the spirit of god there's things that god will begin to show up in our lives and it's it's the molding it's the shaping of our character and it's a great it's a great quality of the bride of jesus christ to be able to take the word and to be able to examine our lives and not just be a hearer of it but be a real doer of it and to recognize that you know when we look at it that it's not our own righteousness it's god's righteousness that it is not our perfection it's his perfection of his life in us so our confidence is in that righteousness that perfection of his life inside of us and the desire that we would have as a believer is lord i desire that my life would be pleasing to you if there's anything that's out of line in any way lord help me lord god that it might just be brought in tune or in line you know many times we we can ask god and say well lord we we we just need you to move in this situation or we need you to move right here and it's true we need god to move but you know many of the times even in sometimes in that it's really getting down to we know what the answer is but what's the problem you see because when we're looking at it we're looking and we know that he's the answer but sometimes it's to try to get down to really what's the problem because he'll answer that problem he'll minister to it and sometimes the problem is is just us are you with me so god gives us grace even to be able to overcome even in those things and so when we're looking at this thought of it in in dealing with uh vaunteth not and i want to just just move a little bit more here tonight we probably won't be able to transition to the next part but i want to just move through this tonight on some things because vaunting of oneself is not altogether what sometimes a person would even say but sometimes it comes down to even the very actions and what things are done and the spirit of god remember his soul is so precise that it looks beyond even things that are done outwardly that sometimes those things can seem so innocent and so righteous and even right that yet the spirit of god it's a discerner of the very thoughts and intents of the heart and you know when the word comes there's nothing that can be hid from the word when it comes the bible says all things are are naked and open before him with whom we have to do so the word comes to search our hearts and that's what we want we want the word to search our lives so here we find when the lord jesus here he is as he as he comes here and he's beginning to deal with how the condition of how that a believer and a life should walk before god and he brings out and he draws out the contrast of what that the disciples and the rest of them have seen before them and here's where he takes it in matthew six 6 1 it says take heed that you do not your arms before men to be seen of them otherwise you have no reward of your father which is in heaven therefore when thou doest thine alms do not sound the trumpet before thee as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may have glory of men barely i say unto you they have the reward so the lord jesus has dealt with it that that the real real reality in an alm itself is is a righteous deed it's helping somebody out it's ministering it's ministering even of that of mercy to one maybe there's a need or or maybe god it isn't all together a financial need that sometimes how god will work and he'll move through the body and as we said before it's a glorious thing to be used of god but we must always remember that it's just like this microphone i'm wearing the microphone can't do nothing it's not the microphone that's given forth the message the microphone is only an instrument and that's all we are we're just an instrument in the hand of god and it's our responsibility to ensure that our life remain as an instrument that he can use at any time and so these are things that god as he would speak there and he would deal with that the one of the things that is he would speak to even those in that time the religious the pharisees they were doing things but they were doing it with the motive to be seen they were doing it then as he says in the next verse to be heard they wanted to let everybody know what they had done you know they had to let everybody know you know when you know the testimony or whatever hey i was the one praying for that and it didn't need to be at all you see that's that's a motive that takes away from the attention of what god is the one who's doing it's god who does it we recognize it's not it's not our prayer it's god moving on our hearts it's god's grace and us to be able to respond to that and to pray for the different needs it's as an entire body and so here we see that jesus as he said let not that left him know what the right hand is doing remember brother branham was asked in a situation regarding in the tax case and they couldn't figure out they say you know they were really coming at him and they said here you come before your group of men and you got nothing but a bunch of yes men and everything else and you didn't even ask the trustee board or whatever if you could take take the money and out of a you know a check and offering that was given and you paid for a widow's mortgage you paid for this and you didn't even ask them brother branham take the scripture and he says to the man he says here's what god's word says let not the left hand know what the right hand is doing you see it's a principle that that the desire is is not to draw attention to ourselves charity does not want to draw attention to the vessel but charity wants to put all attention and glory on him you see god won't share his glory with nobody if a vessel or anybody even a church begins to glory in things god will pull back because it's not the vessel nor the church it's god to receive all the glory so we look at this how that the lord jesus here he would go in and i think that's so fitting of a scripture that the angel of the lord would would speak to the prophet in regards to the third pull that word working in simplicity and humility in the body christ working in his body and he says when thou prayers thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men barely i say unto you they have their reward i read this and i think of it right now i've got a good buddy a pastor of mine and he's he's he can be kind of funny and he said you know he said there's certain ones you just don't ask to pray over the dinner he said because after they're done he says it's cold he said you want to tell him hey you're going to pray like that you pray at home you just you pray ask god's blessing so we can eat thank god for what's been provided so there's a there's an element of things and i i don't even weigh in and even that that brother was not saying it in the sense that this individual is trying to draw attention to himself but i think we have to understand the things that are even at hand and here when we're praying as as the lord jesus said it's not to be seen but that they that not to be seen amen because they have the reward he says but when you pray enter into thy closet and when thou has shut the door pray to the father which is in secret and thy father which is in secret or seeth in secret shall reward thee openly you see we're not the pharisees they sought honor of one another they sought praise of men they wanted to make sure what they did that everybody knew about it and somehow people would esteem them more righteous and more spiritual and everything but see this is contrary to the very working and nature of almighty god because look how when god when god comes in every age even when they came to the prophet and said why don't you come out here you know the los angeles why don't you come out to these places and wanting him even writing many times large sums of money come stand with us and you'll never have a one in your life you just got to compromise on a few things but remember the response that the spirit of the lord gave through the prophet he said it never has the gospel went to the big nerve centers it goes to the simple it goes to those who are desiring this gospel it's went around the world but it's never went and never intended to go to the nerve centers it has went to the hearts that are hungry and desiring to know god in a real relationship in a real personal way and there's a life to be lived the life of a in a life of a believer is not to be recognized by others but i the praise oh my there's no greater praise that we could have than to get along with god and his presence come into the room i think there's nothing greater you know when they're there and many times whether it's in prayer or just meditation here his presence comes and he begins to reveal things and begins to minister things that's the greatest presence that's the greatest reward it's just to be able to step away from ourselves because listen the time that is spent along with god oh brother and sister there is a reward that is wreath from a life that is spent before god brother graham said many times when it came to those of martin and they would see the miracles and martin's ministry he said many were looking just at what was taking place in martin's ministry but they failed to recognize the sacrificial life that was behind the scenes it takes a sacrificial life with god but it's not something that we put out there of well you know i've listened to three tapes today and you know i've done this and i've done that nobody's interested in all that you've done and you've prayed five hours that's not glorying anybody but you hallelujah there's sometimes where there's certain details that need to be left out are you with me because it isn't bringing any glory to god it's bringing glory to self and believe me you don't have to prove anything to anybody you don't have to prove about your time or anything like that so you just as we stand there we don't want the enemy to draw us out into those places see here's here's here's the pharisees in this time the bible says in matthew 23 verse 5 but all their works this is what jesus said all their works they do for to be seen of men they make broad their philanthropies and enlarge the borders of their garments and love the uppermost rooms at feast and the chief seats in the synagogues and greetings in the markings and to be called of men rabbi rabbi this is what they love their whole delight is in position before people it's it's to appear within a certain way and to think of when we look at this their whole works is to be seen amen you know when it speaks here of this of the philanthropies the widening of the garment these were things writings that were of specific scriptures that were written out you remember how david would say you know uh let it be upon my eyes or the frontlets upon my eyes and david would speak of those things in the psalms and here they would take of you know leather straps and little boxes and they would write certain writings and they would have it upon a band it would dangle down also have it around their garment and it would be these things that would dangle down and all of this it was it was to be something that would be and when engaged in prayer was to be held over the left arm and fastened there even to the forehead but notice how jesus said they're enlarging their philanthropies they're enlarging the border of their garments and here here as it makes known they these things were done just to make themselves more conspicuous they wanted themselves to stand out a little bit more you see something that would have been fine would have been writing with scripture who would have been fight but their desire in doing what they did was to kind of set themselves apart from the rest of the people as though that they were more righteous let me tell you something if there's anything that that causes a separation other than the word i'm talking about even a self-righteous attitude it's not of god there's nothing that should work in that way as though i'm gonna set myself up above the people or i'm going to do this or i'm going to show that i'm a little bit more holy or i'm a little bit more righteous but you see if it's knowledge just that knowledge that's that's here of the earth just from that that cometh from the word then brother it'll never bring come with it with real humility but when it is that which god is sovereignly revealed it's something that comes to your heart you recognize it comes with humility it comes with a real mercy and a real grace and you stand there recognizing that it's not me that is that has opened this or showed myself this this is the grace of god you see when paul think of paul when he would come amongst the people look how brother branham would emphasize this the spirit of god would take us to this this place in the scripture over and over here was paul a great man and he's coming to the corinthians and paul would say in this manner i was determined to know nothing among you save jesus christ and him crucified he said it was with you in weakness and fear and great trembling because his desire was that their faith would not stand in him as far as the man but it would be the operation of the holy spirit coming through that word that their faith would stand in the power of almighty god he was a great man he was a man that could speak many different languages here was a man whom god had opened his word to and had given to him and commissioned him to take the word to the gentiles listen paul had paul had an opening that superseded all the rest of the disciples the rest of them knew him by flesh and of course at pentecost they had to have that reality in that experience but paul did not know him in the flesh paul knew him by revelation it was it was the very same god that came and revealed to paul that of the law now here is the fulfillment in jesus christ you see what that revelation did for paul it brought such a rest to paul that paul himself he was not troubled about keeping holy days or keeping this paul could say it's all been met in jesus christ that's the reality of what divine revelation does it brings rest it brings peace it brings strength it brings life and it brings the glory of god that reflects it all back on him that he's the one that has done this all see paul here he was standing in this in this time and paul would come and i just want to refer to a few places here in the scripture and paul as he would come into galatians galatians 6 i believe i included that in galatians 6 verse 12. you remember here's a group of believers galat the the the galatian people and here here you have men that come among them and are wanting to take the these individuals and take them back under the law as though that faith in christ is not enough as though the working of the holy spirit coming that promise as though that that's not enough that you have to do other things on top of it and here the spirit of god it comes to discern that because these men had come and troubled the the the church there in galatia and notice what the spirit of god as it discerns these things it says in galatians 6 12 as many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh they constrain you to be circumcised only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross notice their desire is to make a show of you in the flesh for they neither themselves uh who are circumcised keep the law but desire to have you circumcised that they make glory in your flesh so after they pass through galatia their whole coming i hope you see this their whole going to galatia had nothing to do with the welfare of the people their whole coming to galatia was to try to draw people according to their thoughts or their of where they were standing still there under the law and hear where they're standing they're wanting to draw the people there and when it's all said and done their glory was that people that the people would receive circumcision in the flesh i'm talking about the males that they would receive that it was for no other purpose it was not for the glory of god it was about their own agenda oh my this is a very serious thing you see god forbid notice how paul said god forbid that i should glory saving the cross of our lord jesus christ by whom the world is crucified unto me and i unto the world for in christ jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but a new creature now jesus says it like this he says my doctrine is not mine but his that set me if any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it is of god or whether i speak of myself he that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory but he that seeketh his glory that sent him the same is true and no unrighteousness is in him now when you think how paul would have would come would have to come within that in galatia paul would also uh have to set things forth even when it would come into the church in in corinth and things that were taking place even among the body paul would address certain things in timothy you see when god is is trying to work there's always that of the satan who wants to come in in in in as an adversary to come and try to disturb the work of almighty god but you see the thing how paul would come and he would speak now to uh write this in the romans and it applies to so many other places here in the scripture when paul he could say in in the corinthians there and i want you to think of this when paul could write to the corinthians and say you are the seal of mine apostleship he could say your the testimony of christ is confirmed in you he could go on and paul could say in this and emphatically if an angel from heaven or anyone else comes and preaches any other gospel unto you let him be a curse you see paul was paul was putting the absolute authority in the revelation of jesus christ and paul could stand there he wasn't bragging on himself he wasn't vaunting he was letting the people know what you have received is the word of god and that's what jesus was saying if man will do the will of god he'll know whether the doctrine is of me or it's of my father why because a man-made doctrine produces man-made children but that which comes from god it produces god because it's not the ingenuity and the doctrine of man it's god's seed it's god's life it's the gospel of jesus christ producing itself in the lives of the people and paul could have this you see there's a need for this there was a need for these things even for paul to come into a place and say in romans 11 verse 13 for i speak to you gentiles inasmuch as i am the apostle of the gentiles i magnify my office if by any means i may provoke to emulation them which are uh them which are my flesh and might save some of them paul when he would write of this this was an authority that he would remind this is an authority that god has given me but he wasn't walking around as a braggart it was letting him know this is what god has done paul wasn't ashamed to acknowledge what god has done the position that god had placed him in and paul said the reason he says even within this that i may provoke some of my own kindred to emulation that in other words they would be stirred up to even look into the glorious revelation that god has given in this time you see the desire is that others would be provoked would be stirred to look into the things of almighty god because it's a great wonderful thing of what god has done now you find where paul as he would come there were men that were coming along through there false you know they're false apostles paul called them false apostles false workers deceivers dogs paul went on and on and laid it all out because they had a they had an objective and an agenda that was from hell the agenda was is to get people to follow them brother brown simply put it like this he said that spirit of trying to outdo one another he said it's a spirit of organization a spirit that wants to outdo this one or out do that one or out do this one you know we've seen that in the natural you take somebody in the family has a wedding that somebody else wants to i'll do that with him i mean if this one had limos they're going to have chariots and it's just out trying to outdo one another and besides putting themselves to debt you know there's a lot of things and people can see through all of that you know the thing of it is is just that that to rest in the reality of what god has done in our life what he's called us to that's that's that's think worthy right there thank you lord for what you've called me to if god just to be what god has called you to be that's why paul said let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called so when we see this paul as he's as he deals with this here in second corinthians 11. he speaks to the to the corinthian church and he says let no man think me as a fool if otherwise yet as a fool receive me though i may boast myself a little that which i speak i speak it not after the lord but as it were foolishly in this confidence of boasting seeing that many glory after the flesh i will glory also paul goes on within this passage of scripture and it begins to deal with things concerning there am i not a hebrew and begins to deal with things that has transpired and taken place even in his life in that of the ministry now you would look at it and paul he recognizes this even in what he set forth to the people that you know the the foolishness of boasting but you see there were those who had come around and were trying to present themselves as though they they were somebody and you see the reality is is that anytime somebody has to put themselves as somebody or try to prove themselves they're missing the proof that comes from god because a man and himself listen friends this is not something that a man has to prove to somebody else that when when a man is called of god and positioned of god let me tell you something if that man's called there's people that'll hear what god has to say through that individual that man doesn't have to prove anything to nobody god is our proof that's why god told joshua this day i will magnify thee before the people god let him know i'll do the work why he wasn't to exalt joshua the man but it was that the people would be comforted by seeing the leadership of the holy spirit of the word coming through joshua and that's what brings comfort to the hearts of the people you know you and i there's times that you can get discouraged sometimes let's just look at it there's things sometimes that even we can become common to one another but when we look and say i'm not looking to brother samuel or looking to anybody else i'm looking to you lord and father that you will come and speak to me that you'll come minister to my knee and when you're able to move into that channel and you recognize it's not the man it's not brother samuel leading us it's the word who is leading us it's to have confidence in him who is the word who's in our midst hallelujah this is why when paul you know as he would write concerning it and he said if there's one thing i'm going to glory in in that same passage of scripture if i must needs glory i will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities so you know in weaknesses now i don't think there's anybody here that would want to boast of our weaknesses paul's not boasting of the weaknesses so much but what paul is glorying in is that through the infirmities the weaknesses one of that of where paul his eyesight would come and go you would find where paul would say i'm writing with large letters to you he would he would speak of those things there was infirmities things that that was encompassed about within himself his bodies we're not talking about sin now we're talking about that weakness and things that would show up you see what weaknesses do when things come our way and tester trials or or situations you know and it might been a long time maybe since maybe you've never felt certain pain maybe you you know you've looked at things and said well i don't know why you know so and so such and in such pain or whatever more well maybe you've never been to that degree of pain but you let you let yourself get to that degree of pain you have more sympathy with somebody else when a prayer request comes in you'll pray a little bit different than what you did before you won't be praying with the thought of why don't they just take tylenol you'll be praying and recognizing lord i remember that pain that i was in lord jesus father will you go and minister to them paul said our glory and mind infirmities why because the infirmities those things that it showed up or that had brought forth the weaknesses that were there that had brought him to a weakened place why would he glory because in that time of weakness god could be strong this is what paul was glorying in paul was not saying praise god i got bronchitis praise god i got this that's not what it's saying paul was recognizing here in a time of weakness it was a time that god was able to step forward and paul can recognize you know what it does every time in our life it makes us aware of our need and our dependency upon almighty god god knows how to keep us trapped down not beat down but tap down you see this is why when the scripture says in proverbs 25 verse 14 whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain see the false part is making something that it really isn't and somebody has to embellish it they have to make it something that it's not let me just say this a true gift does not need embellishment a true gift doesn't need the recognition of man is that right it doesn't need that it don't need no other glory than just the glory of the lord that has come to use it there's things you realize when you look at even the nine spiritual gifts all of those things must be checked by the word right are you hearing me it must be checked by the word so even within these things that we look at it here as we look there's things that brother brown will give us the examples i've seen it right here within the assembly of things that you're not even aware of you don't even know but god has laid something on this person's heart and this person here here they just may be called to encourage somebody else perhaps god has used you and you know what when it's all said and done you're just thankful god thank you that the lord that i could be used and nobody knows anything about it maybe your husband does maybe your wife does but other than that nobody knows anything about it when the woman prayed when she was pressed by the spirit of god in that service to pray for that little baby remember she didn't want to do it she said well she's that sister she's here to you know to to go on the platform and brother braham is going to pray for it but the spirit of god said go and let ask her ask to ask the mother today if you could pray for her and when that woman she went and she prayed for that little baby when when the woman then came into the prayer line the spirit of god spoke through the prophet and said sister your your baby was already healed there was a sister out here that prayed for they're your child and brother man will pick it up and he says see what it is he said it was a mother that prayed for that child and she would have way more sympathy for that child than what i can ever enter into [Applause] but nobody would have ever known it right i'm sure that woman didn't put a trumpet outside champion she didn't set up a table next to where the books were at and the pictures come on now she didn't there was not there was not anything about nobody would have known anything but it just goes to show us how sovereignly god can work and you know what it shows me it shows me that the more there are times for testimonies but there's times that how god tests us to see how are we going to handle what he's given to us if we handle in a way that we've got to tell everybody and do this i'm telling you god will pull back because he will not share his glory with no one god doesn't want you or me looking to anybody but him amen that's true you see even in this here the bible says it like this concerning even that of the office of the high priest in hebrews 5 verse 4 no man taketh this honor unto himself speaking of becoming high priest but he that is called of god as was aaron so also christ glorified not himself to be made and high priest he did not glorify himself to be made a high priest but he that said unto him thou art my son today have i begun thee who gave him his position the word the word gave him his position he did not glorify himself he did not take this upon himself this was allotted it was given to him the scriptures are familiar with this one a man's gift maketh room for him and bringeth him before great men what does a gift but it maketh room for him you know simply put if the man is to preach more often the gift will make room for that the gift makes room for what god has called it to be and the gift itself it'll bring them before great men it'll bring them it won't be the gift that's yielded to god and god brings it into position as god chooses to use it i mean think look at look at brother adams look at brother branham's life and you think of how within his life seventh grade education not even that and how that even within brother battle he didn't want to be a preacher just tell you the truth when you look in the brotherhood didn't want to be a christian are you with me you see this even when you have something going the opposite way you know as we've been looking at it took god to deal and god to turn that heart and that nature it took god to really bring about a real softening of his heart to bring and bring that life to a place of surrender but it was all a work of almighty god brother branham never sought for those things he never went for that place right there it was god who was moving in his life to bring him into these places did you see just as god worked there with the prophet's life that's the same way in our life as the bride of jesus christ this is why even in the revealing of the word when the prophet speaks to us and he says pray for revelation what's the motive in praying for revelation the real motive is to pray and say oh god i just want to be closer to you lord lord revealing your will lord revealing your word what a precious reality that is when god would speak to our hearts it's gone moving in such a simple way it's not a desire to vaunt ourselves it's a desire that he would be glorified because when that word is revealed there's a supernatural power there's a supernatural strength that's released through that word that our lives take on the very image of that word itself here you find ram you know in the dreams here was you know leo and just just how said leo in this dream of the of the pyramid how this this brother he had a dream and it was it was about a pyramid and brother brown would say it like this in in the message greatest battle i don't have it there i'm just going to refer to it he said you thought you'd come up up in there talking about uh brother leo mercer thought he would come up into that pyramid pyramid into that place and he said leo no man gets up here god has to put a man up here you climbed every physical realm that could be climbed said you can't come here leo go back down and just tell the people that it comes from god i think there's no greater privilege than to come to the place that god god would bring us to and it brings us to a place of assurance to declare that indeed this word is of god and you see it isn't the man's word having an effect it's god's word that has an effect if it's staying with that word it brings the effect of almighty god upon the people and in the lives of the people what a blessed thing it is just to say this is of god i tell you that that ought to be such a such an encouragement it's it's not about that you and i can explain things it's it's it's what what's greater is is that you know from your soul it's thus saith the lord it's thus saith the lord you know this is the word of almighty god paul would go on and say it in this manner and i may just just refer to a few of these these places here how paul would write speak of this in 2nd corinthians 12 verse 1 it's it is not expedient for me doubtless to glory i will come to visions and revelations of the lord now paul's going in and you some of this is a familiar passage where paul would write of this and and he would say i knew a man in christ above 14 years ago whether in the body i cannot tell or whether out of the body i cannot tell god knoweth such a one caught up to the third heaven and i knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body i cannot tell god knoweth how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words which is not lawful for a man to utter of such a one will i glory yet of myself i will not glory but in mine infirmities for though i would desire to glory i shall not be a fool i want you to look at that we can really preach on that paul said though i would desire to glory there's a part that still remains there in the flesh and paul was able to catch that and say i'm not going to go in that direction with this because listen remember the scripture they that are christ have crucified they that are christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust thereof it's crucified the enemy can try to come but it's crucified it's dead it's to him that we live and paul could say though he says i would desire to glory i shall not be a fool for i will say the truth but now i forbear lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be or that he heareth of me remember brother brown in the visions the first pull second pull and even in the third the third pull when it comes into that part of even on the second pole and this is what comes to me right now remember here he is he's fishing for that rainbow trout are you with me god is showing through that vision there how he brings a son to maturity and here he stands in the midst of that time and brethren get around him and say oh brother branham's a great fisherman brother branham's a great fisherman oh my he can really catch the fish and about that time old brother brandon pull the hook he pulls it and when he does there's a fish that just is like the skin over the hook and the angel of the lord told him and said what did i tell you don't listen to those men you see the word it was bringing a test it was trying and let it be known that don't go by the other parts of a person don't go by what others are saying we're not looking at what others are saying we look to what god says you see it's training and god brings us into that we don't all of a sudden come to that my you know here we are born again and my we've got everything down patent never no mistakes that's why we need the blood of jesus christ because we do make mistakes there's times that we can all say and if you don't see it allow the spirit of god to show it out when we have wanted but we have wanted but you see the spirit of god when he makes it known to us it's there to show you and i hey this is not a part of that character and god's doing it in a measure that we could yield ourselves to him be molded that our character be molded because listen in every molding in every situation god is preparing us for another junction oh glory be to god hallelujah i like that how paul says it's doubtless to me to glory i will come to visions and revelations of the lord you see this would be just like as a father of the house the father could say it's doubtless that god will come and visit and he will reveal to me the things his will for my home for my for the leading of the household it's god who gives that bleeding that's not bragging but it's recognizing lord i need you just trying to get here to a place just let me just continue to move down through here there's a place i want to get to in many other scriptures but i just want to move ahead paul could announce to the people who were there with us in galatia timothy and corinthians and he could say even as we referred to some of those statements before it says i'm not behind of the chiefest apostles paul could make the statement of how that even when he came there among some they hadn't they had not they didn't even know paul but when paul came among them and he began to speak and begin to minister the word and share that gospel that god had committed to his trust paul said they glorified god in me the people were able to see it was god that was at work even remember when they there were different ones that because of idolatry and they could see the working of the supernatural but they wanted to make it as though paul was a god but paul being a man of god he would not allow them he says stand up you don't don't worship me it's god that's doing the work so in everything when when paul would come in this manner here it was showing that declaration this is the work of almighty god i think of brother branham many different places i was just looking at this over the time and brother branham some of these statements that you're you're very familiar with when brother branham could declare and he would talk about the pool of water of bethesda when the spirit of god would come and move upon that water the water couldn't glory in itself it was the spirit of god the angel of the lord who came and troubled that water brother brown would make would declare here the spirit of god would come down and say i'm just your brother but by the grace of god when the angel of the lord moves down it then becomes the voice of god to you if i offended you by saying that forgive me but i felt that i might have been resented but i'm god's voice to you he said i say it again that time was under inspiration i felt bad about it the first time but it repeated it now he said see i can say nothing in myself but what he shows me i say it now brother i will go on to make the statement let me just refer to a few of these places i think this is very in is this this time is this the sign of the answers brandon makes this statement i've always this is a principle you know there's things that you can find in the word of god and there's things that brother branham would say it just becomes a principle of discernment brother brown would say like this he says when you see a person that's got the answer to everything that's contrary to the word well they've got the answer that's contrary to the word right there's many examples brother brahm goes through it he says he doesn't tell his servants everything you've seen that with isaac jacob and esau there's many times even with that were elisha coming there in the chamber and the boy had passed on even with that of elijah they didn't know what to do they were just waiting on god they didn't know what was going they didn't know what to do but god's the one who opened it and revealed it to his servants so there's gone there's times that even in that when we where there's not an answer as far as well i know this is what it is or i know that is what it is that's contrary to the scripture i tell you it'd be greater just for somebody to say you know what i'll pray about that get back to you is that right instead of willy-nilly taking all the roads and everything else around just to be able to let us know you don't know just say you know what let's pray about that is that all right you see god will not share his glory with no one the brahman even talks about you know impressions and things that comes up he says no matter how impulsating those are he says we've got to take them we can't always take it as thus saith the lord we've got to discern that and check it whether it is of god or not the brahman says he's always protected me because i've waited on him i haven't tried to sink look at this he's protected me because i've waited on him i haven't tried to seek popularity or vain glory of men i've tried my best to live humble live the kind of life that i think a christian should live and i haven't been able to do that within myself but he has done it until this day as i say that he is the one that's led me i think that soul it's so tremendous to see that even how the spirit of god would bring this you say brother samuel why are these things well these are things how the god just just has been dealing with my heart over the weeks and then you begin to look at things and this is listen friends this is the approach many of you right here and on the internet those of you that look to me as your pastor you know where i stand with the word there's things that that sometimes that one thing that sometimes can kind of get to me if there's things that's being used out of line in the word and i i like things to be kept in line with the word i i don't like things to be misrepresented i like it to be kept in line with the word i don't like quotes that get off and try to validate things in people's life let's keep it right with the word of god and the other when and it goes with it i don't look for things when it comes to here when we're looking at the message i don't try to take the message and try to say let me just try to see where this is at within the scripture i know this is a scriptural message this is a scriptural prophet are you with me there might be some things that maybe you don't understand and maybe you don't see or a person says i don't know where this is at in the scripture if you just be patient it's right there in the world [Applause] but sam you're trying to make brother ben no i'm not trying to make him something god made him the prophet to this age are you with me and this is why when we look at things that's where i take my leaning when there's things you know when it comes down we're speaking of things or whatever more there's things are the spirit of god it'll bring things right back to my mind of things i've heard the prophet say and listen friends without this message the bible would just be a written letter but god sent this word to make it more than just a written letter a written word it god lifted himself up out of history it's not mindset it's not the mind of william branham these are the thoughts of almighty god let me tell you something it's a dangerous crowd for a person to stand upon and say that's brother branham's opinion that's what brother branham thought oh brother brandon probably meant this here that's dangerous crown you have no business tampering with that that's what paul was saying here paul was not vaunting himself but he was reminding them this revelation did not come by the will of man and neither did god entrust it for a man to vaunt himself to be able to say well this is a god this is not of god this is a god that's foolishness amen and i'm telling you that's not of god that is a spirit that's seeking to vaunt itself above the revealed word of the hour but let me remind you the authority of god's word is to be under the word the spirit that hasn't come through the prophet we stand under that word and brother through that revelation we are a mighty army it's not us or speaking it's god who's speaking it's not us it's changing life god is changing lives hallelujah [Music] i mean no qualm about it this message is thus saith the lord i don't apologize to nobody about that i told you some some time ago just a couple years ago or whatever i realized as an individual called me and they're wanting to bring questions and this and that and i realized this is somebody who's seen who's set in meetings who's seen it as a boy and there's things that you're asking and and troubling with and i could i want i told the individual i said you know what brother adam said right here you know what brother brown said right there and you begin to realize wait a minute the things that just to mention it should have settled it right there it shouldn't went any further no question whatsoever but because the authority of the word was lifted it was not heeded to i'm telling you friends this is why brother branham when he makes this statement he that is in you he says what i'm trying to say he says don't never lose your confidence don't let don't let satan tell you evil about me because there's much but you keep that confidence cause if you don't it won't happen don't look to me as a man i'm a man i'm full of mistakes but look to what i'm saying about him it's him he's the one that's a whole emphasis of this this word this revelation this that god has sent to you and i i'll tell you brother sister there's men i hope this i'm just going to say it there's men there's commentaries there's commentaries you can look at commentaries i have things within different study programs and things like that commentaries these are commentaries of men you can look at certain things and you know there are certain things that you can read in your scofield bible some of those you have a scofield bible you'll read certain statements sometimes that are read down there and just oh this is the exact same statement that brother branham he speaks of in this is the mess there's a manic eternal life you can find many of it you say well brother samuel what's the difference with that because listen those men writing things even in commentaries they're writing under an inspiration there was truth that was there but you see in this hour this is not trying to put things together it's god that's assembling the truth it's god that's putting his stamp upon it that's why i say with all my heart it's good to get into the message you need to get into the message brother samuel i've got a book over here get into the message the things that i'm ministering from i'm not ministering from a book out there i'm preaching from the revelation of the word that god has sent in this hour god has declared this word god has put his stamp of approval this is his gospel this is his word this is his message this is the power of transformation [Applause] amen i hope that's all right but if it's not you'll have to take that up with the lord you see these are things as paul would write of that let's just close i think it's very much so as i've told you over and over i've had things sometimes and i want you to understand i'm nothing i had things sometimes were sometimes you know you come into such precarious situations situations that didn't ever ask to be in and it feels a little funny when you're in it and sometimes situations that would be brought and go to looking at things you know within the messaging and it's simply to me it is simply to put it like this as i spoke many expressed many times something to to to different ones that maybe have come in there and how to listen many of these i'm speaking have a real real good heart they really desire to to follow the lord and would come and you know ask certain questions or ask certain things they say brother brown or brother simon what did you do i could speak to them this is where you can look at this in the word right here brother branham has taken us into the word right here he's given us the leadership of the holy spirit what god was saying in the word right here that should end it right there are you with me that should end it right there it shouldn't be well i need to see it here i need to see it there i need to see it see if a heart in humility god can teach a heart that's humble sometimes you know humility is it's just simply saying lord i don't understand this but will you show me lord will you will you open your word to me lord amen god didn't ask you all right to even try to figure it out that's not even how that i minister i'll say the other brother in a minute we don't minister things because we understand it here it's ministered by revelation it's god that comes and places together that's why even with things that when we look at things you see things that are even happening in the world right now things that even going on and you find at times where people are getting carried away with that they're getting carried away within certain things and they're wanting to take on certain causes and doing certain things like that the simple part is if they get in the message the message will direct and it discerns the spirit that's motivating these things are you with me it puts it brings it to a place where not to get caught up with the things of the world it's not brother branham's opinions on things that's god's word and his leadership to you and i in this hour god knew friends let me tell you something god knew this time that you and i would be living it he knew there'd be traps he knew there'd be things that would pull upon your emotions things that that that the enemy would try to pull on your emotions and pull you out into various situations but god has given a word to stabilize us and say i will not believe that narrative i will stand with the word of almighty god because this word god has given is there to see us all the way through hallelujah so if there's any anything we're going to glory in we glory in god it's god who has brought his word to us in this hour and this word that god has given to our hearts is a word that comes to lead us and direct directors i'm telling you brother sister the word has the answers there's things when we look at things families and husbands and wives and children the word has the answer it has the answer we can look to god in prayer oh i'm so thankful that that's one that's one of the many things let's stand how the word it brings us into that place of a real the leadership of the holy spirit back into the church of the living god and i just with anything at all i just say if you're giving yourself to the to the message oh god bless your heart and give yourself to the message give yourself to the word listen these things that god would lay up on my heart bring within this bring within this manner it it don't worry about when you you read a message or you're listening to a message don't don't don't don't listen to it with i've got to understand all these points oh just just put it on just put it on just just read let me just show you one little thing just just to share with you maybe it would be a help to you as i go through and probably most of you go through and you have a daily devotional so much of you know the scriptures where as you read through and do some of that because i just i want to read there's times of study where the times of study just goes and you're cross-referencing i'm taking this just following the lord and going here and going there but then even a part of it this year when i started out in the first part of january even at the latter part of december i just said you know one of my one of my favorite one of my favorite books is the church age book it has everything right there contained in it so i just i set out and i looked at it and the one that brother george when brother george took it and he kind of did it a little bit and he he broke it so that the scriptures aren't right there in the paragraph they're broke down some of you that have the copies of it and things like that well i think it has what it's 400 and 428 pages i believe if i'm not mistaken so i took that and i just divided it by 365. i know in the youth meeting brother george mentioned something about it and when i told him two pages he said no no no we'll see i had already divided it but but the thing that what i did was i said you know i'm just going to take this and the book brother brian had bought me the copy of it some years some some years ago the leather-bound copy and you can't write in the pages it's not like my paper copy my paper copy you know how it is you highlight here and write notes here just like in your bible you're writing notes and i can't write in it you say well brother samuel what's the good thing about that because i just read i just take a page or two page because naturally i'm inclined to just study there's a part of it i can just start to start going and just start studying not me but you understand the gift it's there and there's i don't want i just said lord i just want to read just a little bit and i've just taken it and just a couple pages a day there's two pages actually that'll get you done with a book well before the end of the year if you just do a page and a half but samuel why would that be important well it was important enough for him to bring it to my mind but i would say this right here there's a lot of things that you can get brothers and sisters a lot of things that you can get that's even out there and i'm not altogether saying well this devotional or this or that that's not what i am saying to you is this right here make sure you're availing yourself in the message of the hour because what what god is bringing here it's a message that that's what positions us in jesus christ don't worry about trying to figure everything out let god reveal it you take a little bit it's not about it's not quantity it's quality it's quality it's not quantity it's quality you can just read that brother brown would talk about even as you're reading the word of god he said you start out he said you just read a chapter and you say he said and make sure as soon as you read that chapter you say amen then you read another chapter maybe he said before you go to bed you read it amen just the simplicity within that you see god god works with us in this time this hour you see what the word does it calls us into a place of real humidity humility with god to where instead of us we're not walking around as it records the spirit of this age i'm rich have need of nothing see they present themselves within great elaborate things and programs and everything and building one trying to outdo the next one trying to outdo and see all of that in itself it it's it's it's seeking the wrong thing it's focused on the wrong thing it's like what we read here in the pharisees but you see the word of god comes it comes to draw you and i out of that it draws us out of the glory of men the glory of ourselves it draws us into a place of his glory to where it's no longer either liveth but it's christ that liveth you see it's where you and i can make the statement and say i can't do this on my own listen god doesn't step back that invites god but when you begin to think as though you can do it on your own that pushes him away what should i do invite him even when you're on the way to work of a morning invite him lord be with me today lord lord guide me today but listen you know how many times i've done this job i know how to do this but lord will you guide me today lord you give me favor lord it's looking to him i believe that's the desire in our heart real charity real love as it goes forth it wants to it works to draw us beyond ourselves to where he's
