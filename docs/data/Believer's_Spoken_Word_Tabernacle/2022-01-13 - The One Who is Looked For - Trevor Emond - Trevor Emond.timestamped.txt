[41:20] word thank you musicians appreciate it
[41:24] well if you would um
[41:26] well you're seated just stay seated and
[41:28] maybe i'll give you a little further
[41:30] introduction of who i am
[41:32] and then we'll stand and and uh read a
[41:34] scripture and and get into preaching but
[41:37] uh brother trevor eamon is
[41:39] who i am um my son zion i travel with my
[41:42] piano player um
[41:45] and i'm just thankful
[41:46] for that um left uh
[41:49] two other children at home azariah and
[41:51] gloriana
[41:52] and they're all older teenage now and
[41:56] and my wife anime
[41:57] and the puppy
[41:59] which
[42:01] amen
[42:03] is still a puppy
[42:05] which is why a lot of people are still
[42:06] at home
[42:08] but um
[42:10] well praise the lord yes amen thank you
[42:12] i received that
[42:14] so
[42:15] um but we just uh we lived there in
[42:17] sellersburg indiana um
[42:20] for the last three or four years we've
[42:21] been going to brother nathan bryant's
[42:23] church uh there in new albany and um
[42:26] just trying to put our shoulder to the
[42:27] wheel and be a help before that we were
[42:29] at the branham tabernacle for many years
[42:31] um
[42:33] and uh i was a sunday school teacher
[42:35] there for the last few years while we
[42:36] were there and and um like i said
[42:39] anywhere we are we're just trying to be
[42:41] a blessing
[42:42] amen so um
[42:45] how did i learn the word well
[42:48] yeah that's how i learned the word
[42:50] so i didn't know anything else until i
[42:53] we came into the message when i was
[42:54] about eight
[42:55] so uh i had a little bit of experience
[42:58] with some denomination and then we got
[42:59] out of that and uh before it was
[43:02] uh you know able to get any
[43:06] stick in me
[43:07] really and so we've just and my my
[43:10] father came to
[43:12] understand the message of the hour and
[43:14] brought it home to us and we've just
[43:16] been
[43:17] happy
[43:18] to be in the revelation of this day the
[43:20] word of the hour you know
[43:22] and so that's what i know about the word
[43:24] so that's the only thing i can i can
[43:26] preach from is is from from that angle
[43:29] so you don't have to worry about
[43:31] any any other kind of color you know
[43:34] so but we're going to talk about that
[43:36] maybe just a little bit let's see here i
[43:38] guess that's probably good enough
[43:40] introduction
[43:41] and i like to uh i guess by
[43:45] by calling i'm more of a teacher
[43:48] and i ran from that for a long time
[43:51] not ministering but from identifying
[43:53] myself as a teacher because i didn't
[43:55] want people to think i was boring and we
[43:57] kind of have a problem so with with
[43:59] thinking teachers are boring and i i'm
[44:01] just by the grace of god and hoping to
[44:03] change that reputation
[44:06] so praise the lord why don't you stand
[44:09] with me
[44:10] and we'll turn to this is a this is
[44:12] slightly just slightly a christmas
[44:15] message although when i would say that
[44:17] uh even if it were in late december it
[44:20] would you'd still be like that was a
[44:21] christmas mess but it kind of is um and
[44:24] and genesis chapter 3 and verse 15
[44:28] you might think well
[44:30] that's not a normal text for a christmas
[44:32] message
[44:34] i don't do things normal
[44:39] you know aren't you glad that god
[44:41] gives unique gifts
[44:43] to
[44:44] all of us
[44:46] god didn't create you the way you are so
[44:50] that
[44:51] you know he could just change you
[44:53] he wanted to put his life on the inside
[44:55] of you but he created you to be the way
[44:58] you are so
[45:00] amen he wants
[45:01] the uniqueness that he placed he created
[45:04] you the way you are for a reason and god
[45:05] wants to use that and magnify that
[45:07] that's things that god put in your life
[45:09] so i'm just thankful you know that we're
[45:12] all not
[45:13] everyone the same right and we're not a
[45:15] bunch of robots
[45:17] but we're free in christ
[45:19] amen so genesis chapter 3 verse 15
[45:23] i will put enmity between thee and the
[45:25] woman between thy seed and her seed it
[45:28] shall bruise thy head
[45:30] and thou shalt bruise
[45:31] his heel if we just bow for the uh for a
[45:34] word of prayer lord we are thankful to
[45:36] be gathered together in the name of the
[45:37] lord jesus christ
[45:39] in a midweek service lord we're
[45:42] lord we're just happy to i know i am
[45:44] just so happy to just come out from the
[45:46] things the cares of the world
[45:48] that have enveloped our lives
[45:51] uh so much this week and to come and be
[45:54] in this little oasis lord jesus where we
[45:56] can sit by the cool stream and
[45:58] the waters of life lord and and take a
[46:01] cool drink and be refreshed lord in the
[46:03] presence of of almighty god and lord we
[46:06] know that you're here with us though we
[46:08] are unworthy of it
[46:11] oh father but you desired fellowship
[46:14] with us and
[46:15] lord we're so thankful
[46:18] so wash us of our every sin lord jesus
[46:20] and dwell with us lord
[46:23] speak to our hearts lord jesus and may
[46:25] you be pleased with every part of this
[46:27] service take control we ask in jesus
[46:30] name amen amen you may be seated
[46:37] so
[46:38] this is the first scripture in the bible
[46:41] the the first
[46:43] messianic prophecy
[46:45] the first prophecy that there would be a
[46:48] coming
[46:49] messiah
[46:51] and
[46:52] and so and so that's why i say well it's
[46:54] it's in a sense a christmas message as
[46:56] we think of
[46:57] of the coming of the messiah well that
[47:00] was jesus's birth jesus was the messiah
[47:04] he was the anointed christ and he was
[47:06] born there in bethlehem now this is the
[47:09] one the jews had been looking for ever
[47:12] since genesis 3 15
[47:15] was was told to adam and to eve
[47:20] that the jews the the the seed of adam
[47:24] of adam and eve
[47:26] have been looking for that messiah to
[47:28] come ever since
[47:30] so so this is this is this is going to
[47:33] be the culmination event
[47:36] of of scripture here because what has
[47:39] happened here is there's been a fall
[47:41] and and now okay there's been a fall so
[47:44] so there adam and eve are and and we'll
[47:47] talk about it just a little bit more but
[47:49] but but there they are and now there's
[47:51] this fall and so now there's a curse and
[47:53] now there's a punishment
[47:56] but but now here given even in the
[47:58] punishment yet redemption is laced in
[48:02] the prophecy though he's sitting there
[48:04] telling them you're gonna you're gonna
[48:06] be scratching the ground and you're
[48:08] gonna bear children in pain but even so
[48:10] that seed that's coming that you'll bear
[48:13] in pain one day yet that is the place
[48:16] that that is going to bruise this
[48:18] serpent's head
[48:21] and that there will be victory over this
[48:24] serpent one day though maybe he has
[48:26] carried the day so far there's coming a
[48:29] day i won't let this thing stand
[48:33] but but my purpose is being done and i'm
[48:36] even now expressing who i am as a great
[48:40] and mighty savior as one who is love and
[48:44] now love can be defined you you
[48:46] recognize if we look at it for a moment
[48:49] that that we actually you know adam and
[48:52] eve if we think about it for a moment
[48:54] they're walking with god in the garden
[48:56] of eden
[48:58] every day every evening there they go
[49:00] lord so nice yes we were just walking
[49:03] down here to see the lions and and uh
[49:06] and get a drink of water for come with
[49:08] yes it's so wonderful that you came and
[49:10] there they are and it's like
[49:13] the fellowship that they have
[49:15] but yet we have more revelation and
[49:18] understanding more about who he is than
[49:21] they did
[49:22] because prior to the fall
[49:24] they could they could talk about the
[49:27] love of god
[49:29] but yet they couldn't have experienced
[49:31] it in the way that you and i do because
[49:35] now we can understand that the god of
[49:37] love doesn't just love those that are
[49:40] perfect doesn't just expect those to be
[49:43] perfect but he said it doesn't matter i
[49:46] am coming to reach down and pull you out
[49:49] of the depths of sin
[49:55] that's why i'm coming back
[49:58] because i'm gonna smite this serpent in
[50:00] the head
[50:01] and the problem that you're facing today
[50:05] well it's you're not gonna have that
[50:06] problem at one at some point now
[50:09] i'm going to have victory over it
[50:12] for you
[50:15] because i'm god you know i'm powerful
[50:18] enough to raise up stones to be children
[50:20] of abraham
[50:22] i could just wipe you off and get a new
[50:24] you know a new set of of adam and eve
[50:27] that aren't going to fall on me
[50:30] but that wasn't the purpose
[50:33] [Music]
[50:35] so how do you feel about your sin
[50:36] tonight
[50:39] well we should feel bad about it of
[50:41] course
[50:42] of course
[50:43] but god allowed it to be there to
[50:45] express his love to you
[50:48] so that you could understand the depths
[50:50] are you worthy of it no that makes it
[50:52] all the more great
[50:54] and makes him all the more loving
[50:57] [Applause]
[51:00] amen
[51:03] it's him tonight
[51:05] amen
[51:06] that's the one who we're looking for
[51:10] and that's the title tonight the one who
[51:12] is looked for we're looking for this
[51:14] messiah from genesis 3 15.
[51:18] he's the one we're looking for
[51:21] where can we find him and when will he
[51:24] come
[51:26] and that's what we're looking for
[51:27] tonight
[51:28] so what is that what is that talking
[51:30] about if we're saying we're waiting for
[51:31] this one to come now now the jews there
[51:34] at the time that jesus was born they're
[51:36] looking for a messiah
[51:39] and and they they don't have you know we
[51:42] can look back now and we can see
[51:45] the two comings of a messiah
[51:47] you see we're still looking for a
[51:49] messiah to come are we not
[51:52] because we understand the two comings of
[51:54] messiah but they at that time you know
[51:57] it would have been hard to understand
[52:00] that messiah was going to come two times
[52:02] yet they had scripture you know he's
[52:05] going to be bruised he's going to be
[52:07] broken
[52:10] and they're like well wow i don't
[52:11] understand how that's going to work
[52:12] because he's also going to come and he's
[52:14] going to be the king of kings and he's
[52:16] going to have a scepter
[52:18] the scepter of jacob out of genesis 49.
[52:20] so he's going to have a scepter he's
[52:22] going to rule so
[52:23] um don't know how that but you know what
[52:25] we we all do this right you know we all
[52:27] have a tendency to take the things that
[52:29] we hear really interest us and the
[52:32] things that don't so much well it's like
[52:34] god's gonna do that somehow but i mean
[52:36] you know
[52:38] king of kings here like
[52:40] like the whole bruising thing that's
[52:42] yeah probably just gonna be a little
[52:43] blip on the map that we're not even
[52:45] gonna notice
[52:47] because how can you be king of kings and
[52:49] be bruised like that how can you have
[52:51] the scepter and you know
[52:54] so we we looked at this one time
[52:56] i saw you know you you look at uh i
[52:59] think it's micah chapter 5 or it's micah
[53:02] 2 but i'm pretty sure it's micah 5
[53:04] verse 2 that's thou bethlehem of frata
[53:07] where we understand that the messiah
[53:08] would come to be born that's when the
[53:11] magi went to herod and said hey and
[53:13] herod's like hey people that actually
[53:14] know these things where's the messiah to
[53:16] be born well bethlehem a fraud is what
[53:18] the scriptures say that's where messiah
[53:20] is coming from we'll read that chapter
[53:22] sometime you know
[53:25] okay other than bethlehem frata you're
[53:27] looking for someone who's a warrior to
[53:30] come and smack the assyrians around
[53:33] i mean that's if you're looking at micah
[53:34] chapter five that's what you're
[53:35] expecting so so here comes this baby boy
[53:39] wrapped in swaddling clothes from
[53:40] bethlehem
[53:42] [Music]
[53:43] but but how's he gonna like king of
[53:46] kings wait what
[53:48] that's not what we're looking for
[53:50] so they're looking for a messiah they
[53:52] they came to a place where they had a
[53:54] conception of what it was the word was
[53:57] saying and then he came and it didn't
[54:00] match their conception
[54:02] amen now aren't you so glad that we've
[54:04] moved beyond those kinds of things
[54:11] none of us do that
[54:12] have our own conceptions that
[54:15] are wrong sometimes
[54:18] we haven't changed that much
[54:20] unfortunately but by the by the blessing
[54:23] of god we can look at that history and
[54:25] take a warning from that you see it's
[54:28] you see what what ended up happening is
[54:30] over time they began to create this
[54:33] picture of who the messiah was
[54:38] and they were looking for their picture
[54:40] of what messiah was and then after you
[54:43] know after the um
[54:46] after the babylonians came and took
[54:48] everybody to captivity and assyrians
[54:49] took the northern kingdom to captivity
[54:51] you know and and so then okay now we're
[54:53] coming back from babylon we're renewing
[54:55] the temple in ezra and nehemiah and and
[54:58] okay this is great we're setting things
[55:00] up there's a change in in in what the
[55:03] they were looking for
[55:05] and they no longer were truly looking
[55:08] for you know a messiah they were looking
[55:11] for a messianic condition
[55:15] they were looking for what the messiah
[55:17] would do
[55:18] instead of who he was
[55:21] and often we get into the same place
[55:24] that we're looking for what messiah will
[55:26] do when he comes instead of looking for
[55:29] him
[55:30] and they stopped looking for him and
[55:33] they started looking for what he would
[55:34] do well he's going to drive out the
[55:36] romans that's what we want he's going to
[55:38] take care of our enemies he's going to
[55:40] make his kingdom here on earth even
[55:42] after jesus dies and rises again
[55:46] the disciples having spent so much time
[55:49] with him now he he dies he cleanses them
[55:53] of their their sins and he rises again
[55:55] and now they're like
[55:57] man
[55:58] now it's time you've been doing all this
[56:00] preaching and it's been great jesus
[56:02] really but will thou now at this time
[56:05] restore the kingdom
[56:08] they're still looking for him to drive
[56:10] out the romans he's like dad you missed
[56:13] the point you're looking for a condition
[56:15] of what you want instead of i'm right
[56:18] here
[56:20] and and and more than that i'm right
[56:24] here but i've rose again from the dead
[56:26] i've purchased your salvation i
[56:29] fulfilled genesis 3 15 the curse is not
[56:33] on you anymore to to where you're no
[56:36] longer you're not looking for just a
[56:38] lamb anymore but now i have went
[56:42] and now i'm gonna go and i'm gonna sit
[56:44] on that mercy seat
[56:48] and you are free from that and more than
[56:51] that i'm gonna rise again but i will
[56:54] come to you i will send you a comforter
[56:57] he will live in you he will show you
[56:59] things to come he will teach you what
[57:01] you have need of and there you are and
[57:04] so he's saying look not only am i going
[57:06] to be beside you but i'm going to be in
[57:09] you
[57:17] will thou at this time restore the
[57:19] kingdom of israel
[57:22] your sights were a little small
[57:23] disciples
[57:24] now you and i would have been in the
[57:26] same boat
[57:27] we wouldn't have known any better we
[57:28] know better because now we have the
[57:29] revelation
[57:31] we can look at that history and we can
[57:33] learn from it and we would do well
[57:35] tonight to do that
[57:38] to make sure that we're looking for him
[57:40] we're looking for the one who is to come
[57:44] and we're not looking for the condition
[57:46] that he would bring all right
[57:48] and that's really hard because we we
[57:50] want to get to a place where there's no
[57:52] sin we want to get to a place you know
[57:56] where our bodies don't hurt
[57:58] we want to get to a place where there's
[58:00] no tears
[58:02] how many want the messiah to come and do
[58:04] that
[58:08] but but
[58:10] why
[58:11] what makes that condition
[58:13] that condition
[58:17] everything that you're looking for in
[58:18] the millennium
[58:19] everything that you're looking for in
[58:21] the peace and rest that is to come to be
[58:24] the reward for the overcomer in the last
[58:26] days everything that you're looking for
[58:29] is fulfilled not because of him but in
[58:32] him
[58:33] amen
[58:34] not because he wills it or pushes all
[58:37] the problems out of the way but because
[58:40] he comes back the world must be that way
[58:46] scripture says no evil shall dwell with
[58:48] him so so when he when he comes you know
[58:51] he's coming into a heart that's cleansed
[58:53] by him when he comes back again and he
[58:56] sets his feet on the earth it will be
[58:58] after he has cleansed it again
[59:03] so
[59:06] so that's what we're looking for
[59:09] we're looking for him
[59:11] for him to come back
[59:14] so
[59:15] so we're in a sense though genesis 3 15
[59:18] and in in a sense we can say that's been
[59:20] fulfilled yet we understand the coming
[59:23] of the messiah happens in two times so
[59:26] so we're looking for that that second
[59:28] time
[59:30] so there they are in the garden of eden
[59:33] and adam and eve you know how wonderful
[59:36] it is the fruit trees and
[59:39] you know there's the animals and they're
[59:40] all wonderful
[59:42] and
[59:43] you know
[59:44] anything they have need of
[59:46] it's great it's peaceful
[59:48] god comes down every evening
[59:51] fellowships with them i mean we'd love
[59:53] to be in this in this condition every
[59:56] single one of us
[59:57] you know so so there they are and then
[1:00:00] along comes the serpent and and beguiles
[1:00:03] eve and and deception comes
[1:00:06] and she's deceived she doesn't really
[1:00:08] understand what she's doing but she's
[1:00:10] she's deceived and and she gives to adam
[1:00:12] and
[1:00:13] you know okay here we are and now we
[1:00:15] have a fall
[1:00:17] right so so now we have a prophecy then
[1:00:20] that the messiah will come and smite the
[1:00:22] serpent
[1:00:24] and so
[1:00:25] so we can fixate on can't wait
[1:00:28] until that serpent is smitten
[1:00:31] the serpent did this to us
[1:00:34] we could we could have had all of this
[1:00:37] but we lost it because of this serpent
[1:00:39] and god said he'd send someone he'd come
[1:00:43] and he would smite the serpent and that
[1:00:46] there's not going to be sin anymore
[1:00:49] how many are looking forward to a time
[1:00:51] when there's no sin anymore like so that
[1:00:54] man i can't wait for the messiah to come
[1:00:57] to smite the serpent
[1:00:59] amen
[1:01:01] amen
[1:01:03] you know there's more to that of course
[1:01:06] you know but you you just stay with me
[1:01:08] as we play this out here you know so
[1:01:11] so so they lose these things they lose
[1:01:14] the plush garden they lose the cool
[1:01:16] streams and laying down beside the the
[1:01:19] lions they lose the fact that they had
[1:01:21] no sin
[1:01:22] they had no fears
[1:01:24] they didn't know time
[1:01:26] now they know time so they know fear
[1:01:29] they know anxiety and doubt and worry
[1:01:33] so they lost the peace that they had
[1:01:36] but but is that all that they lost
[1:01:39] did they only lose like oh the peace
[1:01:42] that i had and all the wonderful times
[1:01:44] or is there is there something else that
[1:01:46] they lost well we look in brother
[1:01:49] branham in many places i chose
[1:01:51] fellowship with god through
[1:01:52] reconciliation out of 1956 in the
[1:01:55] beginning when man used to walk in the
[1:01:57] early age with god
[1:01:59] in the garden of eden when the first man
[1:02:01] was created in the great cathedrals
[1:02:03] under the palms he and his wife with the
[1:02:06] cool of the evening come along they come
[1:02:08] out and worship god
[1:02:10] had a perfect
[1:02:12] fellowship
[1:02:14] god longs for fellowship
[1:02:17] he listened to this language he yearns
[1:02:22] he wants people
[1:02:24] to speak with him to talk with him
[1:02:28] you you might sing too much you might
[1:02:30] preach too much sometime but there's
[1:02:32] only one thing you'll never be able to
[1:02:34] overdo and that's pray
[1:02:37] now this isn't the kind of praying
[1:02:39] that's like lord help miss jones and you
[1:02:41] know put the quarter in the in the
[1:02:43] vending machine and lord i'm gonna stick
[1:02:45] like five quarters in because there's
[1:02:46] five things i need tonight
[1:02:48] so lord you take care of those things
[1:02:50] and keep me safe and wake me in the
[1:02:51] morning
[1:02:52] amen
[1:02:58] that's not fellowship
[1:03:00] that's requesting that's right
[1:03:03] now there's nothing wrong with that
[1:03:05] but there's more to prayer
[1:03:08] so the bible said i would that men pray
[1:03:10] everywhere lifting up holy hands you'll
[1:03:12] never be able to have too much
[1:03:14] fellowship with god
[1:03:16] god longs for his creature who he
[1:03:19] created in his image to fellowship with
[1:03:22] him
[1:03:23] wouldn't you have loved
[1:03:26] to have lived in the time when the great
[1:03:28] fellowship with god had with adam and
[1:03:30] eve in the garden of eden to come down
[1:03:32] in the cool of the evening and talk with
[1:03:33] them
[1:03:34] fellowship with them
[1:03:36] wouldn't that be marvelous
[1:03:38] we would all like to have that time now
[1:03:41] i believe by god's word and i can prove
[1:03:43] to you that we can come right back on
[1:03:45] them terms again with god tonight
[1:03:47] right straight back
[1:03:50] to that kind of fellowship
[1:03:54] so he also says in 1965 me not to thy
[1:03:57] own understanding eve
[1:03:58] which was no doubt an intelligent person
[1:04:01] well let me let me come back to that so
[1:04:03] so what we just read we god is yearning
[1:04:06] for fellowship
[1:04:07] right
[1:04:08] he yearns for look what did they lose in
[1:04:12] the garden of eden peace yes
[1:04:15] wonderful time yes they lost fellowship
[1:04:18] with god can you imagine the next
[1:04:21] evening adam outside the garden walking
[1:04:24] along thinking this is about the time
[1:04:28] that he used to cut him
[1:04:31] he's not here
[1:04:35] hallelujah
[1:04:37] how cheaply we give up
[1:04:39] that privilege
[1:04:41] in our daily lives
[1:04:44] how adam must have wept those
[1:04:47] first few evenings
[1:04:48] god you're not here it's not that i
[1:04:51] can't pray to you anymore but god i
[1:04:53] don't have the fellowship that i used to
[1:04:55] have
[1:04:59] adam lost that
[1:05:01] and eve lost that
[1:05:04] the greatest thing they could ever have
[1:05:06] because the source of peace the source
[1:05:09] of love the the reason the garden of
[1:05:12] eden was so amazing is because an
[1:05:15] amazing one took all of the qualities
[1:05:18] and attributes that were in him and
[1:05:21] created something and god saw it and it
[1:05:24] was good why was it good because he was
[1:05:29] so the expression of his character is
[1:05:31] put into his own creation till even he
[1:05:34] as he comes in the form of christ was
[1:05:37] the very expression and character of the
[1:05:39] heart of god
[1:05:42] and so we find in him that one that the
[1:05:45] characters that was him in the beginning
[1:05:49] and so here the garden of eden is so
[1:05:52] amazing because he made it that way and
[1:05:54] wouldn't you want to be with the one who
[1:05:57] has such quality in them to have created
[1:06:00] such a thing amen
[1:06:02] amen so so so they lose this fellowship
[1:06:05] with god
[1:06:08] and it must have been terrible
[1:06:11] but but for a moment
[1:06:14] we think so
[1:06:16] small sometimes and we think in terms of
[1:06:18] adam and eve how what they lost but for
[1:06:22] a moment
[1:06:23] did god lose anything on that day
[1:06:28] i want to read this quote to you again
[1:06:32] praise the lord
[1:06:34] wouldn't you have loved to live in that
[1:06:35] time the great fellowship with god had
[1:06:37] with adam and eve down in the garden of
[1:06:39] eden
[1:06:40] down in the cool of the evening talk
[1:06:42] with them fellowship with them
[1:06:44] when they had perfect fellowship
[1:06:48] god longs for fellowship
[1:06:51] he yearns
[1:06:55] there was a god who yearned to have
[1:06:57] fellowship with adam and eve
[1:07:00] and then adam and eve
[1:07:02] fell god lost the fellowship that he had
[1:07:06] with them
[1:07:07] you understand that god created you for
[1:07:11] fellowship
[1:07:12] to worship him to fellowship with him
[1:07:16] think about this for a moment god before
[1:07:18] he created everything was no less
[1:07:21] awesome than he is tonight
[1:07:24] he he he was he was awesomeness itself
[1:07:28] he was love embodied all that was holy
[1:07:31] all that was wonderful all that was cool
[1:07:34] all that was amazing whatever your
[1:07:37] adjective that i could never exhaust you
[1:07:40] come up with it he already was that but
[1:07:44] yet for some reason you would think man
[1:07:46] if i was that amazing do i need anyone
[1:07:50] else apparently i do
[1:07:54] because god was that amazing and it
[1:07:57] wasn't enough for him he said i want to
[1:08:00] express these things and have fellowship
[1:08:03] with someone to enjoy it with me
[1:08:08] so there they are in the garden of eden
[1:08:11] adam and eve walking in the cool of the
[1:08:13] day with god because god couldn't stay
[1:08:15] there wherever it was he was all day
[1:08:18] long but he yearned to have fellowship
[1:08:21] with those he created oh my
[1:08:26] he yearns church he yearns to have
[1:08:29] fellowship with you
[1:08:31] he created you for that
[1:08:34] you have purpose in your life because
[1:08:37] there's an amazing
[1:08:38] god who put you here to speak back to
[1:08:42] him there was a deep place within you
[1:08:45] that's now reaching out back to the deep
[1:08:48] that's there
[1:08:50] praise god for that
[1:08:54] so don't let the world get in the way of
[1:08:56] that because god is yearning for it
[1:08:59] [Applause]
[1:09:02] let's praise the lord to say i can't
[1:09:05] wait for you to come back jesus
[1:09:07] i can't wait till we can walk around in
[1:09:10] the millennium and have such fellowship
[1:09:12] jesus i am so looking forward to that
[1:09:15] but you never have that kind of prayer
[1:09:18] life
[1:09:19] now
[1:09:22] but yet
[1:09:24] we can come right back on them terms
[1:09:26] again with god tonight
[1:09:29] straight back to that kind of fellowship
[1:09:32] god is yearning for that the thing that
[1:09:35] adam and eve that the thing that had to
[1:09:37] hurt the most to lose was that
[1:09:40] fellowship the thing that hurt god the
[1:09:42] most was to lose that fellowship
[1:09:50] what a tragedy
[1:09:52] the loss of him
[1:09:55] not the loss of the condition the
[1:09:57] tragedy was the loss of him that he
[1:10:00] wasn't there with them any longer was
[1:10:03] the worst thing that happened to adam
[1:10:06] and eve that day
[1:10:09] what a tragedy it was
[1:10:12] now why did this happen
[1:10:15] eve which was no doubt an intelligent
[1:10:16] person
[1:10:18] the first right off of adam who was the
[1:10:21] son of god and eve
[1:10:22] certainly being in that spot
[1:10:24] when there had been no sin
[1:10:26] no place for sin she certainly must have
[1:10:28] had a wonderful
[1:10:31] conception of what god was
[1:10:35] this makes sense right we'll just slow
[1:10:36] down make take a moment i could use a
[1:10:39] few breaths okay she had a wonderful
[1:10:41] conception of what god was why she
[1:10:44] walked with him every day amen
[1:10:47] right
[1:10:48] you know after you've been married for
[1:10:49] 20 years you you
[1:10:51] you begin to understand the person
[1:10:53] you're married to
[1:10:56] you know
[1:10:58] you get smacked and you haven't said
[1:11:00] anything yet you know i mean i knew what
[1:11:02] you were thinking
[1:11:06] this doesn't happen to me i don't think
[1:11:09] have to anyway
[1:11:10] but you get to know one another you you
[1:11:12] understand when they're down when
[1:11:14] they're up how things are going you know
[1:11:18] it's true
[1:11:20] because you understand one another you
[1:11:21] have a conception of who they are and
[1:11:23] how they feel how they act you know
[1:11:27] eve has this with god himself because
[1:11:30] she walks with him she knows him
[1:11:34] because every afternoon
[1:11:35] she and her husband walked in the cool
[1:11:37] of the garden in the evening and talked
[1:11:39] face to face with god
[1:11:42] what an unreasonable thing
[1:11:45] that a person who would walk face to
[1:11:47] face with god
[1:11:48] and then would turn the reasoning of
[1:11:50] something that reasoned her turned to
[1:11:53] the reasoning of something that reasoned
[1:11:55] her away from the word of god
[1:11:59] so so so this is unreasonable because
[1:12:01] well
[1:12:02] if you reason away from the word of god
[1:12:04] it's just not really reasoning
[1:12:06] i mean it's certainly not sound
[1:12:07] reasoning anyway
[1:12:08] you know
[1:12:12] but here is it
[1:12:14] see see what that's doing is that's
[1:12:16] placing the idea of the intellectual
[1:12:18] like the intellectual faith in someone
[1:12:22] it replaces that
[1:12:25] for actually being with the person
[1:12:30] she knew he who he was
[1:12:32] she knew his character she had a great
[1:12:34] conception of that but the the serpent
[1:12:37] comes along and says well
[1:12:40] there's a few things you don't know you
[1:12:42] don't understand quite it's really this
[1:12:45] way
[1:12:48] and she went oh really is that why he's
[1:12:50] like he's that way
[1:12:52] well
[1:12:54] you know what she should have done and
[1:12:55] just been like huh well i'll see him
[1:13:00] [Applause]
[1:13:02] tonight sir
[1:13:05] oh let's take this home
[1:13:07] so when the devil comes to you
[1:13:10] and tries to tell you you've sinned your
[1:13:12] day of grace away you've done this
[1:13:15] you've done that you're not good enough
[1:13:17] you can't this god wouldn't that
[1:13:20] i'll see him tonight
[1:13:23] and i'll ask him
[1:13:26] because i'm on communication terms with
[1:13:30] him
[1:13:38] speaking with some young people the
[1:13:40] other day you know and well we we had
[1:13:42] some prayer line and and and brother
[1:13:44] nathan was advising some young people
[1:13:46] and things and you know when the devil's
[1:13:48] trying to get you to go this way brother
[1:13:49] branham says you just do the opposite
[1:13:52] you know when we begin and as the prayer
[1:13:54] line went on and different ones come by
[1:13:57] and and i begin to realize you know the
[1:13:59] importance you know look if you if we
[1:14:02] you know we we we understand look we
[1:14:04] read your bible and pray every day like
[1:14:06] this is
[1:14:07] it's just christianity right
[1:14:09] just knowing him
[1:14:12] someone looking for him to come
[1:14:14] well take what he's here
[1:14:18] and what you've got
[1:14:20] and so if you shun that like well are
[1:14:22] you looking for him to come it doesn't
[1:14:23] make sense
[1:14:25] so you know this is real church doesn't
[1:14:28] do his do's and don'ts is what i'm
[1:14:29] saying tonight but it's him
[1:14:32] that he's a person that you can know and
[1:14:34] we begin i begin to just think you know
[1:14:36] i understand read your bible pray look i
[1:14:39] want you to do it any time of the day
[1:14:41] and if the only time you can do it is in
[1:14:43] the in the evening that's fine but we
[1:14:45] begin to unders i just begin to think my
[1:14:48] you know if if we had a more concerted
[1:14:50] effort in the morning to lay before god
[1:14:53] and say god i know there's trials coming
[1:14:57] today i know i'm weak i know where i
[1:15:00] fail i know where the devil's gonna try
[1:15:03] to hit me except for those times when i
[1:15:05] don't know where he's gonna try to hit
[1:15:06] me and sometimes you know
[1:15:09] and then i have fallen before i realized
[1:15:11] i was hit lord and god i need you today
[1:15:15] and get into his atmosphere and get into
[1:15:18] his presence then maybe that would be
[1:15:20] much more of a deterrent to get the
[1:15:22] spirit of god around you to help you to
[1:15:25] get through your day
[1:15:26] [Music]
[1:15:32] and maybe that's just a sound principle
[1:15:33] and i'm not making a law or a doctrine
[1:15:35] or a you know you're not good enough if
[1:15:37] you don't do that but my how just a
[1:15:40] parent that came to me that if we had
[1:15:42] that maybe god you know we'd have a bit
[1:15:45] more strength in our daily walk yet
[1:15:47] through it all he loves you and wants
[1:15:50] fellowship with you
[1:15:52] so
[1:15:54] my you know so we we
[1:15:56] we want to be with him and not just have
[1:15:59] an intellectual conception of him so we
[1:16:02] want to get with him and say hey lord
[1:16:04] i'm struggling with this you know maybe
[1:16:06] there's something in the message i don't
[1:16:07] understand something in the word i don't
[1:16:09] understand well don't let that dissuade
[1:16:11] you get to know him
[1:16:15] and he'll reveal it to you
[1:16:17] you know
[1:16:19] i'll put you on the spot brother
[1:16:22] have you ever
[1:16:24] ever been wrong in your doctrine
[1:16:26] [Laughter]
[1:16:28] i mean i'm not saying major points now
[1:16:31] just like
[1:16:35] i have
[1:16:36] there's notes on the side of this bible
[1:16:38] that are crossed out now
[1:16:40] because i was like
[1:16:42] what was i thinking
[1:16:46] [Applause]
[1:16:51] i'm so glad
[1:16:53] that i've put the emphasis on knowing
[1:16:55] him rather than you know having my
[1:16:59] all my ducks in a row
[1:17:04] so their eve is his her great mistake
[1:17:08] is you know instead i'll ask him tonight
[1:17:11] she's like that's interesting tell me
[1:17:13] more and and now and now she's deceived
[1:17:17] and she falls and what is she deceived
[1:17:20] in she's deceived naughty and say hey
[1:17:23] you know um
[1:17:25] i think you should be bad
[1:17:27] i think you should uh disobey god
[1:17:31] it's not what the serpent said
[1:17:35] you know
[1:17:35] uh
[1:17:36] he came out preaching you know
[1:17:38] that's not god said
[1:17:42] well okay
[1:17:44] well we're having a spiritual discussion
[1:17:46] oh how wonderful
[1:17:47] well
[1:17:51] we could say a few things there but i'll
[1:17:52] just leave all of those things away
[1:17:54] anyway
[1:17:56] uh yeah be careful who you have those
[1:17:58] conversations with sometimes you know
[1:18:01] so she begins to have this conversation
[1:18:03] and as soon as she begins to have this
[1:18:05] conversation in her mind what's going on
[1:18:08] is she's looking at an intellectual
[1:18:10] conception an intellectual faith as
[1:18:14] substitute for the one who's coming that
[1:18:16] evening
[1:18:20] now
[1:18:21] that's crazy
[1:18:23] but yet we do it
[1:18:25] and it's easy to do
[1:18:27] and we begin to look at the word of god
[1:18:31] and we begin to take intellectual
[1:18:33] conceptions of the word of god and what
[1:18:36] god's going oh he said this and he's
[1:18:38] going to do this and he said this and
[1:18:40] he's going to do this and we create
[1:18:42] these great pictures and these great
[1:18:44] intellectual architectures and you know
[1:18:46] then we even try to help everyone else
[1:18:49] with our our architecture and you you
[1:18:52] know hey there's ways i teach things the
[1:18:54] same way every time because i feel like
[1:18:56] i this is what it does it for me i get
[1:18:58] it when i explain it this way and i
[1:19:00] think everybody ought to explain it my
[1:19:01] way why because it makes sense
[1:19:06] you know we have the the uh
[1:19:09] what was my
[1:19:10] acronym uh the mwti
[1:19:14] that's the message witnessing um
[1:19:17] technical institute you know training
[1:19:19] institute i think is what it was you
[1:19:20] know if you all come to the mwti and you
[1:19:22] know learn how to present the message
[1:19:24] together we'll have more message
[1:19:25] believers
[1:19:26] because it just works
[1:19:31] it's crazy right like
[1:19:33] that's how the world thinks
[1:19:35] that's how the devil would like to get
[1:19:36] us to think
[1:19:38] you know it didn't seem like when i was
[1:19:40] like well i do it this way and it makes
[1:19:42] sense to me and why wouldn't that
[1:19:43] benefit others well all of those things
[1:19:45] make sense like but yet if you take that
[1:19:48] too far like suddenly you've messed up
[1:19:50] the whole picture because now it's
[1:19:51] become about how you do it instead of
[1:19:53] who
[1:19:55] yes sir
[1:19:57] so so eve chooses an intellectual
[1:20:00] conception a knowledge of god that's
[1:20:03] given to her by someone else instead of
[1:20:06] knowing him and i'm so glad i am so glad
[1:20:09] that god sent us a prophet today because
[1:20:12] god knew that the church the condition
[1:20:15] of when the serpent came to the gentile
[1:20:18] church and and began to deceive the
[1:20:20] gentile church god knew that there would
[1:20:23] have to come some restoration and that
[1:20:26] restoration was not to take us into a
[1:20:30] better understanding than what the
[1:20:32] serpent had or the correct understanding
[1:20:34] but it was to say that he is here and if
[1:20:38] he's here
[1:20:42] if he's here
[1:20:44] then know him
[1:20:49] look for him
[1:20:51] not what he will do not how he will do
[1:20:55] not why he will do i don't care about
[1:20:57] the dew may i just be with you
[1:21:01] [Music]
[1:21:04] so sin enters in the tragedy of
[1:21:06] separation from god but yet through that
[1:21:09] through that tragedy god's plan is
[1:21:12] unfolding to make himself known in his
[1:21:14] fullness
[1:21:17] not understood but known in his fullness
[1:21:20] he wanted to be known so he said here
[1:21:23] i'm coming back to do this thing i am
[1:21:26] known as the one who smites the serpent
[1:21:29] and who's gonna make and take away the
[1:21:31] sin so praise god that he smites the
[1:21:34] serpent and he takes away sin but i'm
[1:21:36] not happy to just have that done for me
[1:21:39] i want to know the one that's that
[1:21:41] awesome
[1:21:43] and i want to be with him
[1:21:47] so so the character of this prophecy
[1:21:50] look it's not enough that eve had sinned
[1:21:53] and needed forgiveness
[1:21:57] she needed restoration but restoration
[1:22:02] to sinlessness
[1:22:04] is the idea that we get
[1:22:07] well we were sinners
[1:22:09] now we'll be sinless
[1:22:11] problem solved
[1:22:13] no you missed that they were missing the
[1:22:16] fellowship
[1:22:20] to be sinless
[1:22:22] that's great but to be sinless without
[1:22:24] him
[1:22:25] you could live the rest of your day
[1:22:27] sinless
[1:22:30] but never have him
[1:22:32] you can have it
[1:22:35] i want him
[1:22:41] does she just need forgiveness so she'll
[1:22:42] feel better about you know messing up
[1:22:47] she just need forgiveness so that she
[1:22:49] can one day return to a joyous luscious
[1:22:51] garden
[1:22:54] yes she needs forgiveness for all of
[1:22:55] these things but that's not the main
[1:22:57] point
[1:22:59] that's not the character of the prophecy
[1:23:01] of why the serpent would be smitten the
[1:23:04] serpent is smitten to restore the
[1:23:06] fellowship
[1:23:09] not the garden condition the fellowship
[1:23:13] so god lost the fellowship that he
[1:23:15] desired we lost the fellowship we
[1:23:18] desired and somehow along the way all of
[1:23:21] the prophecies of coming messiah are
[1:23:23] about us just being better
[1:23:29] somehow christianity has just become
[1:23:32] about us needing to be forgiven
[1:23:37] somehow the message coming has just
[1:23:39] become about needing to you know
[1:23:42] understand the doctrines right
[1:23:45] about how the word is given to you about
[1:23:48] who gave it to you about all of these
[1:23:51] things and we missed the point though
[1:23:53] all of those things are wonderful and
[1:23:55] they're there but they should look if
[1:23:57] you understand every seal that was you
[1:24:00] know that was revealed and you
[1:24:02] understand thunders but it hasn't drawn
[1:24:04] you closer to christ you haven't
[1:24:07] understood anything
[1:24:10] brother branham said in the third seal
[1:24:12] the word would come to her speaking of
[1:24:14] eve for redemption
[1:24:16] what did eve need to be redeemed back to
[1:24:20] not just sinlessness
[1:24:22] redeemed back to fellowship being
[1:24:25] restored
[1:24:28] so if your doctrines aren't bringing you
[1:24:31] back to fellowship with him something is
[1:24:34] wrong and you've missed the picture and
[1:24:36] he's going to come back and you're going
[1:24:38] to be looking for something he's like
[1:24:40] well wait no it's got to all be this way
[1:24:42] or it can't be him
[1:24:44] i want to be so close to him that even
[1:24:47] if it comes in a different way than my
[1:24:48] mind thinks i'll be like well i thought
[1:24:50] it was this way but that's him
[1:24:53] [Applause]
[1:24:58] a return to the person
[1:25:01] contending for the faith
[1:25:03] i have nothing against seminaries
[1:25:04] students monasteries and um mwti's and
[1:25:07] so forth oh i added that little part but
[1:25:09] all of that they'll never know god
[1:25:13] it's only knowing catechism and so forth
[1:25:15] like that
[1:25:16] to know god
[1:25:19] forgive him i made that too light but to
[1:25:21] know god
[1:25:23] is to know the person amen christ
[1:25:26] himself and to know him is life
[1:25:30] not to know your textbook to know your
[1:25:32] creed to know your catechism isn't life
[1:25:35] to know christ the person is life
[1:25:37] eternal and that's what we wish to know
[1:25:40] amen amen so this prophecy comes and it
[1:25:44] explodes onto the scene that he would
[1:25:46] come again though you've just sinned he
[1:25:49] the one he's coming you can look for me
[1:25:52] i will be coming
[1:25:54] why what is the what is what is the
[1:25:56] obviousness if we put ourselves into
[1:25:59] their shoes on that day they don't even
[1:26:02] recognize yet
[1:26:04] the effects even of their sin when this
[1:26:07] prophecy goes forth they're standing
[1:26:10] my understanding of it at least you know
[1:26:11] they're standing in the garden of eden
[1:26:13] what have you done who told you you were
[1:26:15] naked because you've done this thing
[1:26:17] you're gonna scratch the ground and you
[1:26:19] know you're gonna do all of these things
[1:26:21] and and pain you know and but it but but
[1:26:24] the seed is coming to smite the seed of
[1:26:27] the serpent
[1:26:29] they're like oh my goodness like
[1:26:31] this is so much
[1:26:33] but he's saying i'm gonna i'm gonna
[1:26:34] smite him
[1:26:38] to restore you
[1:26:40] what would be their first thought
[1:26:44] because i'm sending you out
[1:26:47] but don't worry i will come to restore
[1:26:52] their obvious thought would be because
[1:26:55] they just don't even get their own sin
[1:26:57] yet their obvious thought would be wait
[1:26:59] you mean we're never gonna be with you
[1:27:02] again but yo thank you you're gonna send
[1:27:06] you're gonna come and restore
[1:27:08] our fellowship not our sinlessness
[1:27:15] when jesus came and died on a cross he
[1:27:17] smote the serpent he smote the effects
[1:27:19] of sin he took care of the penalty of
[1:27:21] sin if you claim that you stand
[1:27:23] justified before his presence as if
[1:27:26] you've never done it and yet we spend so
[1:27:29] much time obsessing over it poking the
[1:27:32] rattlesnake poke poke like i don't want
[1:27:35] to sin again i don't want to sin again i
[1:27:37] don't want to say well stop paying
[1:27:38] attention to the rattlesnake and put
[1:27:40] your mind on him
[1:27:50] so the prophecy comes forth that that
[1:27:52] would be there would be restoration and
[1:27:54] it would be restoration to fellowship so
[1:27:56] then god comes and he tells us in
[1:27:58] genesis 49 that the scepter wouldn't
[1:28:01] depart from judah there were a law giver
[1:28:03] from between his feet until shiloh come
[1:28:05] the messiah shiloh peace is going to
[1:28:09] come
[1:28:10] because at that time by genesis 49 there
[1:28:14] was a lot of no peace going around
[1:28:16] and shiloh was going to come
[1:28:20] now
[1:28:21] so he begins to build a picture of who
[1:28:23] he's going to be
[1:28:24] and then as we go through the old
[1:28:26] testament we find prophecy after
[1:28:28] prophecy after prophecy unfolding
[1:28:32] further and further the same revelation
[1:28:35] that's here in genesis 3 15 but there's
[1:28:38] more color if you will added to it
[1:28:40] there's more understanding there's more
[1:28:43] character what's the character of of the
[1:28:46] prophecy that says i'm restoring
[1:28:48] fellowship and so you begin to
[1:28:50] understand he's going to come and be
[1:28:51] peace we need that we had that with you
[1:28:55] i'm going to come and be king of kings
[1:28:56] well hey you were back then
[1:29:00] you were king of us
[1:29:04] and adam was the ruler over the earth
[1:29:05] and he was king over him
[1:29:10] till isaiah 9 and 6
[1:29:12] think of this verse
[1:29:14] as an expression of the character
[1:29:17] of the further character of this
[1:29:20] original prophecy in genesis 3 15 that
[1:29:22] the seed of the woman would come
[1:29:24] right think think of it just for a
[1:29:27] moment think of it through that lens
[1:29:29] that this is adding character to that
[1:29:31] original prophecy isaiah 9 and 6 for
[1:29:34] unto us
[1:29:36] a child is born
[1:29:39] now i can stop right there i'll finish
[1:29:40] the verse but i want to focus on that
[1:29:42] point because that's instructive to us
[1:29:44] unto us a son is given the government
[1:29:46] shall be upon his shoulder
[1:29:48] okay so now all of a sudden we're like
[1:29:49] ooh government on his shoulder you have
[1:29:50] big broad shoulders okay he's gonna rule
[1:29:53] things uh he should be called wonderful
[1:29:55] oh yeah he's great he's gonna be
[1:29:57] counselor he'll teach us the mighty god
[1:30:00] that's the one
[1:30:02] the everlasting father
[1:30:04] and the prince of peace
[1:30:06] the one we can hold on to and he's there
[1:30:08] always for us he'll be the prince of
[1:30:11] peace and it's going to be amazing and
[1:30:12] and so we begin to think about all those
[1:30:14] last things and all those last things
[1:30:16] like yeah that's the that's the one
[1:30:18] who's coming and then it's like wait
[1:30:20] and so then it's like but unto us a son
[1:30:22] is given
[1:30:23] and a child is born a son is given and
[1:30:25] we think well that's just how he's
[1:30:27] coming
[1:30:28] right that's just how he's kind of sick
[1:30:30] he's just gonna come as a baby like this
[1:30:31] some like so that's how and this is who
[1:30:37] no
[1:30:38] the whole thing is who
[1:30:40] that that he would come like why
[1:30:44] did you have you thought about before
[1:30:45] why
[1:30:47] does god choose to come to fulfill this
[1:30:50] original prophecy and hundreds of
[1:30:52] prophecies throughout the old testament
[1:30:54] he chooses to fulfill to come as coming
[1:30:57] as a baby
[1:30:59] why
[1:31:00] why didn't he just come like he could
[1:31:03] have come at 12 he could have come at
[1:31:05] 30 he could have come at 20 like he
[1:31:07] could have come at any point in time
[1:31:08] like he didn't
[1:31:10] you know i mean except for the fact that
[1:31:12] it was the seed of the woman so well
[1:31:13] okay there's that but you know
[1:31:16] so he had to come and be virgin born but
[1:31:19] he but there's a but there's there's
[1:31:21] character in that even as he comes as a
[1:31:23] baby well how did you come
[1:31:26] oh you came as a baby and you grew
[1:31:29] and you strengthened and you learned
[1:31:33] and you you were brought under
[1:31:34] discipline to train you
[1:31:37] [Music]
[1:31:39] guess what
[1:31:40] you have a god
[1:31:42] an almighty god
[1:31:45] that came
[1:31:47] and expressed his character and that he
[1:31:49] said a baby would come a son would be
[1:31:52] born
[1:31:54] and given
[1:31:56] just like you were because now i'm gonna
[1:32:00] experience what you go through
[1:32:03] so it's not look look i i'm you know
[1:32:06] what i i'm doing i am coming as a baby
[1:32:10] to deepen my fellowship with you
[1:32:15] because now i know what it's like to be
[1:32:18] you
[1:32:20] [Applause]
[1:32:22] you see the character of these
[1:32:24] prophecies expressing who he is and
[1:32:26] stopping and dwelling on those for a
[1:32:28] moment to understand that god
[1:32:31] you yearned for fellowship like that's
[1:32:33] one thing but no you yearned for
[1:32:36] fellowship so much to express yourself
[1:32:39] so fully and you did all of that but yet
[1:32:42] at the same time you came in and in a
[1:32:45] sense came as something that you weren't
[1:32:47] you weren't a baby ever so you chose to
[1:32:50] come as a baby because that's how we
[1:32:53] come so that you could know us more
[1:32:56] [Applause]
[1:32:58] and in the same time we got to know him
[1:33:00] more
[1:33:01] because we got to see his expression
[1:33:03] lived the expression of his character
[1:33:06] that jesus was the very heart of god
[1:33:10] and how god would walk on this earth was
[1:33:12] so instructive to us and we could see
[1:33:15] his heart lived out as a human but more
[1:33:18] than just that he was living as a human
[1:33:21] to be like you
[1:33:23] to strengthen his fellowship with you
[1:33:25] [Music]
[1:33:28] he was tempted in all points like as we
[1:33:32] are yet without sin he knows what you're
[1:33:36] going through he knows what it's like to
[1:33:38] be you you say no brothers
[1:33:41] too far
[1:33:42] get him get rid of him send us another
[1:33:44] preacher like i no he doesn't know what
[1:33:46] it's like to be me because he didn't sit
[1:33:48] he was tempted just like you were
[1:33:52] sir
[1:33:53] he knows what you face
[1:33:56] he's been tempted to have self-pity
[1:34:01] anybody ever have self-pity my
[1:34:05] you know i never knew i mean i never
[1:34:06] knew what temptation was until until i
[1:34:09] found out about self-pity
[1:34:11] like you have a bulging disc in your
[1:34:12] back sometime and and be in pain
[1:34:14] from that probably some people here
[1:34:17] have done that you know and you just
[1:34:19] lying there going
[1:34:21] this hurts
[1:34:22] all right
[1:34:24] god why is this hurt like i don't man it
[1:34:27] just hurts and i it's not fear god and
[1:34:30] like man
[1:34:31] you know and then you try claiming your
[1:34:32] healings like no he said i'm healed i'm
[1:34:34] healed that's what the word says that's
[1:34:36] what we're believing but i hurt man i
[1:34:38] just want to lie here and um
[1:34:41] because i feel better just being man
[1:34:43] it's not fear nobody it's so much harder
[1:34:46] to say no i don't care that that the
[1:34:49] promise is more real than my pain that's
[1:34:51] that's hard
[1:34:54] because you're tempted to sit there and
[1:34:56] go
[1:34:56] [Music]
[1:34:59] and that's
[1:35:00] just a little recent experience that i
[1:35:03] had
[1:35:05] god knows
[1:35:08] he knows what it's like everything that
[1:35:10] you go through he already knows don't
[1:35:11] don't think you're so disconnected from
[1:35:13] you're not disconnected from him he's a
[1:35:15] god of love and he's not just way out
[1:35:17] there but he's a god that said i'm going
[1:35:19] to come and i'm going to express myself
[1:35:20] just like you i'm going to know what
[1:35:22] it's like to be you
[1:35:26] why because i want to know you i want
[1:35:29] you to know me i want to have a
[1:35:31] wonderful beautiful fellowship together
[1:35:35] but he doesn't want fellowship with me
[1:35:37] i'm such a sinner that's not what he
[1:35:39] said that's not what he did
[1:35:43] amen
[1:35:45] don't let the devil tell you about that
[1:35:47] don't let the devil tell you he doesn't
[1:35:49] want you you're not good enough he died
[1:35:51] he came as a baby to be like you then
[1:35:54] die so that he could redeem you from
[1:35:56] that to bring you back to fellowship
[1:35:58] he's done everything that needs doing
[1:36:01] you just need to accept it believe it
[1:36:04] and come to him
[1:36:14] so let's do that church
[1:36:16] oh but instead you know well the god
[1:36:18] sent us a prophet and i don't mean to
[1:36:20] mock this too bad but you know like i
[1:36:22] believe that god sent us a prophet we
[1:36:23] needed that again we needed that
[1:36:25] restoration because we were just going
[1:36:27] to be in church members
[1:36:29] without a prophet coming we're just
[1:36:30] going to be church members well now
[1:36:31] prophet came and we're just church
[1:36:33] members in a different thing
[1:36:35] come out of her my people into not into
[1:36:38] the same thing that's not coming out
[1:36:40] church
[1:36:41] no come out of those that church come
[1:36:44] out of the doctrinal understanding come
[1:36:45] out of the eve's you know thinking
[1:36:47] system and come back to the fellowship i
[1:36:50] restored with you i will send you the
[1:36:53] holy spirit that will come and dwell in
[1:36:56] you and teach you and reveal you to the
[1:36:59] word and so god sent us a prophet for
[1:37:02] redemption with the word because the
[1:37:04] word comes for redemption
[1:37:06] so he sent us a prophet now now don't
[1:37:08] misunderstand me i'm not saying that
[1:37:10] this he's jesus christ and because jesus
[1:37:12] christ died for your sins but there was
[1:37:15] a redemption when eve was deceived there
[1:37:18] had to be a redemption for the deception
[1:37:21] and in our day we've had a deception
[1:37:23] come throughout all of these church ages
[1:37:25] but god has restored it brought us the
[1:37:28] word again to to bring us back in
[1:37:31] redemption because there was a deception
[1:37:33] there
[1:37:35] but what's the point of redemption
[1:37:38] what are we being redeemed to
[1:37:40] brought back into
[1:37:43] fellowship
[1:37:44] amen
[1:37:46] but yet we pride ourselves so often
[1:37:49] on you know
[1:37:50] well
[1:37:52] brother you understand this of course
[1:37:53] this thing in this thing you don't get
[1:37:55] that
[1:37:56] wait you don't
[1:37:57] you don't church the way i church
[1:38:03] brother you come with me he will leave
[1:38:05] him
[1:38:08] i eve better than he does
[1:38:12] i mean did you hear that because like
[1:38:14] that's that's literally the translation
[1:38:17] when we say my my understanding is
[1:38:19] better than your understanding so do it
[1:38:21] my way you're really truly saying i eve
[1:38:24] better than you do
[1:38:29] now again not downplaying understanding
[1:38:31] the word study to show yourself approved
[1:38:33] amen but those things bring you to him
[1:38:37] to the person
[1:38:39] to the one
[1:38:41] that's the point of our redemption of
[1:38:43] our restoration is to bring us back to
[1:38:46] him
[1:38:48] so why does he come as a child if he's
[1:38:50] just to deliver us from sin he comes as
[1:38:52] a deliverer but he comes as a baby
[1:38:54] because there's more there
[1:38:57] than just deliverance from sin
[1:39:00] there's a
[1:39:01] fellowship
[1:39:02] he wants with you an identification that
[1:39:06] he wants with you
[1:39:09] so we'll try to bring this down to a
[1:39:11] close now
[1:39:13] the message is it is i
[1:39:17] now notice when jesus came he performed
[1:39:19] that sign that musicians can come
[1:39:21] man i sure hope that clock isn't right
[1:39:23] oh good it's not
[1:39:25] woo
[1:39:26] glory
[1:39:29] whoo now notice when jesus came he
[1:39:31] performed that sign as the messianic
[1:39:33] sign before the jews now the gentiles we
[1:39:36] we the anglo-saxon we were not looking
[1:39:39] for any messiah
[1:39:40] he only comes to those who's looking for
[1:39:43] him
[1:39:44] he will only heal those tonight that
[1:39:46] believe they're going to be healed you
[1:39:47] will only save those who's got faith to
[1:39:48] be saved in he will only fill with the
[1:39:51] spirit those who are looking for the
[1:39:52] holy spirit when he comes to the earth
[1:39:55] again
[1:39:56] he will come to those who are waiting
[1:39:59] for him to come
[1:40:02] looking for him to come
[1:40:05] prepared for him to come
[1:40:09] now there were a lot of religious people
[1:40:12] in the day that jesus came but and and
[1:40:15] they all said they were looking for a
[1:40:17] messiah to come but they weren't looking
[1:40:20] for a messiah to come they were looking
[1:40:22] for a messiah to come to do
[1:40:25] this that or the other
[1:40:28] messiah himself wasn't enough in
[1:40:31] whatever way he chose to come in
[1:40:33] whatever spirit he chose to come in he
[1:40:36] had to do certain things for them
[1:40:40] because there was a condition that they
[1:40:42] were looking for
[1:40:43] not him
[1:40:46] now
[1:40:47] again please don't misunderstand me i
[1:40:50] don't throw away the word of god and say
[1:40:53] just find the person
[1:40:55] and just love him
[1:40:58] not i'm not doing that
[1:41:00] all of the word
[1:41:02] comes to reveal him
[1:41:05] all of the word is precious because it's
[1:41:07] his word that's right and and we glory
[1:41:10] that god had sent us to it and opened
[1:41:12] our eyes and given us revelation because
[1:41:14] it reveals him
[1:41:17] but he is the point that's right so i
[1:41:21] want to make sure i look back at history
[1:41:24] and what the jews were doing and how
[1:41:26] they missed it and i want to say god i
[1:41:28] want to be like simeon
[1:41:30] i want to be like anna
[1:41:32] i want to be looking for him though he
[1:41:35] could come even as a babe that i'm not
[1:41:38] expecting
[1:41:40] to the temple of god
[1:41:46] but yet i know that it's him because i
[1:41:49] have a connection with him
[1:41:52] though that doesn't
[1:41:54] un make my my my understanding of all
[1:41:56] scriptures
[1:41:58] fit all the message fit
[1:42:00] i'm human
[1:42:02] so in the intellectual so much
[1:42:05] god i don't want to just be there and be
[1:42:08] right and be righter than everybody else
[1:42:10] and be the most lord make me the most
[1:42:13] right person so that you'll come for me
[1:42:20] and it's like you know i'll update this
[1:42:22] to some of the young people language
[1:42:24] like there's no meme where anyone ever
[1:42:27] said lord make me the most rightest
[1:42:29] person so so you can come back for me
[1:42:32] and then the little tagline said no one
[1:42:33] ever
[1:42:35] no no it's like said almost everyone
[1:42:38] ever
[1:42:41] we do this we get our eyes on all the
[1:42:44] stuff and off of him and we've done it
[1:42:48] for far too long church
[1:42:51] let the word of god as you read the word
[1:42:54] of god find lord reveal to me you in all
[1:42:58] of these things
[1:43:00] draw me closer to you
[1:43:04] in all of these things
[1:43:06] he comes to the earth again he will come
[1:43:08] to those who are waiting for him to come
[1:43:10] looking for him to come prepared for him
[1:43:11] to come
[1:43:13] another place he cared came in the power
[1:43:15] of the scripture
[1:43:17] exactly the interpretation of the
[1:43:18] scripture but the people of that day
[1:43:20] that was looking for him to come missed
[1:43:22] him because they had an interpretation
[1:43:24] that they could not go from that
[1:43:26] interpretation
[1:43:27] they must have it their way
[1:43:32] and i'll just be honest enough
[1:43:34] to say god i
[1:43:36] don't want it my way
[1:43:38] i have
[1:43:40] as much as anyone
[1:43:42] a way i think it's all gonna happen
[1:43:45] and i think that it's righter than your
[1:43:48] way
[1:43:49] i honestly and truly do
[1:43:52] we'll just be honest you you forgive me
[1:43:55] that's how i feel
[1:43:56] but i know that that's not right i
[1:44:00] should have no confidence in that
[1:44:03] because i'm just
[1:44:05] human
[1:44:06] and i just want to be restored
[1:44:09] to him
[1:44:11] i don't want to serve him so much that
[1:44:13] i'm not with him i don't want to study
[1:44:15] so much that i don't see him i don't
[1:44:18] want to i don't wanna message so much
[1:44:20] that i miss him
[1:44:24] it's him church
[1:44:26] so let's get to know him
[1:44:28] not consider how he's coming if he's
[1:44:31] coming when he's coming what he will do
[1:44:34] but just to consider and to look for
[1:44:37] him
[1:44:39] the one since genesis 3 15
[1:44:43] the one who has been looked for
[1:44:46] for all time let us not stop
[1:44:50] looking for him
[1:44:52] can we bow our hats
[1:44:58] heavenly father
[1:45:06] lord i know that i i have preached about
[1:45:08] this
[1:45:11] i've preached about this for some time
[1:45:12] lord but
[1:45:15] still recognize how bad i am at it lord

[1:45:28] want to be correct i want to enjoy the
[1:45:30] doctrine that you've given to us but

[1:58:26] we're under the same thread
[1:58:28] the same leading of the lord
[1:58:31] you see it all comes back to that as god
[1:58:34] brought that that theme over and over
[1:58:37] it's fellowship
[1:58:39] with him
[1:58:41] there's things that my wife if you ask
[1:58:43] her right now what are certain places
[1:58:45] would brother sammy would he like this
[1:58:46] she could tell you right now you could
[1:58:48] go to her again she could tell you he
[1:58:49] wouldn't like that now she'd probably be
[1:58:51] nice to you and kind too but she could
[1:58:52] tell you he won't get excited about that
[1:58:54] kind of pie because he doesn't like it
[1:58:57] or he don't like this kind of food or
[1:58:59] this or that you know why
[1:59:00] she knows me
[1:59:03] now that just didn't happen by us living
[1:59:04] in the same house
[1:59:06] we have fellowship
[1:59:09] she knows the things that i like
[1:59:12] the things that i don't like
[1:59:14] that's the same thing with
[1:59:16] the fellowship between the lord jesus
[1:59:19] and us
[1:59:20] as a husband and a wife we
[1:59:23] know the things that he likes and he
[1:59:25] doesn't like and our desire is to please
[1:59:27] him but it all comes back to
[1:59:29] is fellowship
[1:59:31] i think
[1:59:33] to me it was just
[1:59:35] it was so tremendous
[1:59:37] and i don't just say that we don't the
[1:59:39] thing of this service tonight and any
[1:59:40] other service we just don't want to say
[1:59:42] it's tremendous and come and and leave
[1:59:44] out of here
[1:59:45] but to recognize what god has let you
[1:59:47] and i know it's like i talked about on
[1:59:49] sunday what's on the key fob
[1:59:51] you've got auto start and you've been
[1:59:53] carrying it around all the time
[1:59:55] but it's to use it
[1:59:57] use it
[1:59:59] it's fellowship to enter into fellowship
[2:00:02] with almighty god
[2:00:04] things are changed
[2:00:06] in fellowship with him
[2:00:10] i think it's just tremendous
[2:00:13] that we look at to see how we're the
[2:00:15] jews and how all these things and even
[2:00:17] as
[2:00:18] the lord brought it through brother
[2:00:19] trevor even if sometimes we're getting
[2:00:21] in to look at conditions
[2:00:23] you've heard me just you've heard me say
[2:00:24] from the pulpit before sometimes you can
[2:00:26] meet a person and they're bound with
[2:00:28] this or bound with that and ask
[2:00:30] why do you want to be free
[2:00:33] well i want to be a better husband you
[2:00:34] know that all happened but if that's the
[2:00:36] only reason you're missing the main
[2:00:38] thing
[2:00:42] it's him
[2:00:43] that's why we repent that's why we've
[2:00:45] been baptized in the name of the lord
[2:00:46] jesus christ and it's about him daily
[2:00:50] walking daily
[2:00:52] with him i think it's just so
[2:00:56] it's tremendous
[2:00:58] because it's not the focus isn't on the
[2:01:00] conditions and all the
[2:01:01] you can have all the doctrines you can
[2:01:03] know all the words know how to pronounce
[2:01:05] them know all those things and all those
[2:01:06] hat it all has its place
[2:01:08] but if it doesn't draw us closer to him
[2:01:13] so we're saying how could that be known
[2:01:15] if a person if you can't recognize him
[2:01:17] speaking
[2:01:19] then
[2:01:20] it's not drawing you closer to him
[2:01:22] but everything when it draws you closer
[2:01:24] to him you become more like him
[2:01:27] you become more of the
[2:01:29] the opium of the lily of the valley
[2:01:32] wow you've got that aroma just
[2:01:35] it's of his presence
[2:01:37] that's what we desire in our life
[2:01:39] [Music]
[2:01:41] that's that's the very thing and that
[2:01:42] think about it how
[2:01:44] brother trevor just took that quote
[2:01:46] tonight and placed that not only do we
[2:01:48] desire we can say i desire that he
[2:01:50] desires it
[2:01:52] he desires it
[2:01:54] he loves to hear our voice
[2:01:56] song of solomon 2 14 o my dove thou that
[2:02:00] are at the cleft of the rock
[2:02:02] in the secret places of the stairs oh
[2:02:04] let me hear thy voice let me see
[2:02:07] thy countenance
[2:02:09] oh my
[2:02:11] think of it
[2:02:12] he stops the angels when you begin to
[2:02:15] speak
[2:02:17] and it's not just it's not just church
[2:02:19] it's not just in church
[2:02:22] it's every
[2:02:23] day
[2:02:24] every moment what a privilege
[2:02:27] that we've been brought back into to
[2:02:29] have fellowship with him
[2:02:31] to have fellowship with him
[2:02:34] i tell you i could say it like this
[2:02:37] i want more
[2:02:39] i want more i want it deepened
[2:02:41] i want it deepened
[2:02:42] i want it deepened amen
[2:02:45] let's just go before the lord just with
