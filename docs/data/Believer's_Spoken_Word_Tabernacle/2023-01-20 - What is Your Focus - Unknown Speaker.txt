we're marching up her to Zion that beautiful of God Hallelujah I'm glad we're on the right path and God for the evening light that's come amen it takes the guesswork out the obscurity and I'm just grateful to be on the right path amen we we have a sure Foundation sure destiny man we don't know what everything holds between this point and that point but one thing we know we're going back home God told Moses when he made himself known to Moses the place of the revealing would also be the place of ending God let him know I'm going to bring you back to this mountain and you're going to worship me here and so everything between when they went down to when Egypt when he went down to Egypt and then they're coming back here to that place think about it Moses had to be reminded of his commission reminded that God said I'll bring you right back here and so when it came to the Red Sea speak that they go forward so between here and there there is nothing that's going to stop God's word from being fulfilled what he promised we're going back home there'll be some mountains we've got to speak to there'll be some situations we've got to speak to some direction we have to take but in it all we've got a clear path aren't you aren't you thankful tonight amen that's that's a real rest amen for our hearts so good to be with you amen and as we look into the word of the Lord tonight if we want to turn to job 21 I just so enjoyed this weekend just really enjoyed that and Lord willing on Sunday I just finished some details today for the meetings there in March where brother Barry and so Saturday would be quite a quite a a big day and then I also was able to get brother Berry secured for a youth meeting on Sunday evening so so we're it's I'm grateful he was willing to go ahead and stay around for that so we'll have that um Lord willing as well and I've got some things that I want to go through in detail with you on Saturday or for the Saturday meeting so Lord willing this Sunday I'll try to do that and then try to get out an email so you'll even be able to read it and if you have questions and so forth so tonight as we prepare to look into the word of the Lord let's we'll read and then we'll just ask the Lord's blessing upon the word verse 27 and job 21. job speaking to his his friends he says behold I know your thoughts and the devices which he wrongfully imagine against me and it really wasn't too hard to figure out what they thought they'd been saying the same thing all along that you're guilty you're something that you're between secret between you and God see it wasn't anything that they could come out and point and put and say well you did this over here and you did this they couldn't do that what they were trying to do is accuse him of something inwardly Secret boy we could just preach on that for we can't go there tonight but what job knew and what was most important and what's important for us is we know inwardly but you know what there's nothing between God and I there's nothing that I've kept back I've not kept back one thing from God anything that God has led me to do I've done it I've not held back one thing and we can stand there like Joel amen job 27 once again behold I know your thoughts on the devices which he wrongfully imagined against me let's pray heavenly father as we lord look to you this evening and oh God we we need you Lord Jesus you are our source of strength you are life Lord we want to say thank you I know that we each have done that individually for the services this past weekend thank you for the grace through this week thus far Lord oh God it's just always so precious Lord the enrichment spiritually of Our Lives Lord from coming into your presence just nothing like it Lord of what you're able to do in just a few moments of Time Lord so we ask that you'll help us here tonight Lord speaker and here together to step aside for just a few moments Lord and that you would speak Lord what it is Lord that you desire to say Lord we reserve ourselves Lord speaker and here together to the leading of the Holy Spirit may you have your way in and all things be glorified in Jesus name amen God bless you as you're being seated I'd like to continue to read there would allow me to upon that for you say where is the house of The Prince and where are The Dwelling Places of the wicked have you not asked them that go by the way and do you not know their tokens in other words what job's saying is have you not asked those who travel this way and do you not accept their testimony and evidences that the wicked is reserved to the day of Destruction they shall be brought forth to the day of Wrath so what's job is remember he's answering the accusations that have continued to go through out and in chapter 20 it was just an all-out onslaught and this is part of the trial this is part of the test God permits in a test and a trial just was listening to the prophet once again a message some of the messages have been just been going through over these past months just the message titled job and brother Brown you'd be familiar with this out of the scriptures how that God will permit even as we are beginning in serving the lord God will permit a trial to strike in he'll permit something to come our way and that's all part of a trying I I can go back I could give you know personal examples of things and and it isn't always things that you know that would be as simple as just stepping across the line like a crack in the sidewalk or a hole but so it's things that has a I would have a meaning or have pull or have draw or have something there and God permits that to come or something and the whole objective is that when that comes if we're just hold to him who has begun the work in our life you'll bring us through that and we'll find Our Lives we're stronger to keep on moving on with him the pressing it's not about human strength it's not our human strength it's saying Lord I need your strength and just keeping our eyes upon him and I want I'll get to my title here in a moment but I want you to look here in verse 30 once again the wicked is reserved to the day of Destruction and they shall be brought forth to the day of Wrath so as they were saying in previous chapters that this right here the a swift removal of everything all around you that that implies that you're a secret sinner you're a wicked and they're trying to place job there but job knows where he's standing with God and it was a wrong application of the word and let me just say this right here even wrong interpretations of the word can never dismantle the Seal of the Living God the Seal of the Living God standeth a sure the Lord knoweth them that are his you had the workers like hymenus and felitis and they were you know cutting and pasting quotes and doing everything else and they had Paul saying something and you know in such a manner that when they got done some of the people's Faith were overthrown but there were those that though they could say I don't know exactly all that is being said but I know where I'm standing and I'm not going to follow you I'll just stay right here and I'll wait until God makes it known and when God makes it known that's when I have need of it and until that time I'm not going to try to figure it out neither am I going to pick up your interpretation of it glory be to Cotton eyes we could preach on that for a minute but notice the reserve they are reserved the wicked is being prepared for the burning you're being molded through the fiery trials you and me are being molded through the fiery trials right now for the glory that's to be revealed in US amen and who now this in verse 31 who shall declare his way to his face in other words to The Wicked who's going to declare his way to his face and who's and who shall repay him what he have done yet he shall be brought to the grave and shall remain in the Tomb the clouds of the valley shall be sweet unto him and every man shall draw after him as there are innumerably before him how then Comfort ye me in vain seeing in your answers that remaineth falsehood and remember here they are trying to comfort him they're trying to bring Direction but job by the discernment of the word in his life he knows where he's standing and he's able to say this is falsehood it's not where I'm standing with God my fellowship with God is uninterrupted because the only thing that'll interrupt Fellowship is sin right but once sin is confessed Fellowship is restored just like that we go through examples on the prayer line so there are multiple preparations that are going on even in this moment and have been the bride is preparing for rapture is that right the foolish virgin is preparing for the tribulation you can think well how is the foolish virgin preparing for the tribulation she's preparing for it by failing to prepare what's needed for rapture dilatory letting her light go out so that's how she's making preparation and then we have as well as the church and things like that and those that'll make their decisions in the tribulation and the wicked is also preparing for Destruction so everybody's in a season of preparation is that right and so I want to just speak tonight on on that that that that question what is your focus what is your focus because it's not something that I can answer it's only what you can answer I can only answer that question for myself and if I can just say it in this manner is that when we look so much at what I don't want you to all all just to focus on what as being like an inanimate object or just something that's just like like the speaker or something you know just like a plan but remember when God speaks to the mountain that is before the opposition when they came back in the land to build the temple there was a lot of things that were working to distract their focus but it all came down to one thing who art thou old great Mountain because behind every what is a who so if we can let the word uncover it will it will reveal the who and let me tell you whatever the what is if the wrong who is behind it we want to get away from it right if either it's influenced by God and God's directing it or it's the enemy we want to let the word uncover it and really put that and say what is my focus so what are we focused on here so within that because we've seen where job's friends Joe's friends are only focused on the temporal things and there's other in in in in preceding chapters where they're you know letting him know if you get right with God and and if you confess your sins oh the silver and the gold will start flowing back into your house Joe didn't care about that he didn't care about that what Joe mattered to Joe was is that I'm used to talking to him and hearing from him and I don't care if I don't have two nickels to rub together I want to hear from him because I can't make sense of all this right here and what has happened is not my focus job your children is not your focus not my focus your cattle's not your focus nope not my focus your money's not your focus no not my focus because God hath given the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord I I don't want to focus on it because I don't understand but I want fellowship with him he had fellowship with God Joe could look at his life and know there was no hidden or secret sin and it was he was remember he's in a place of he's confused why am I not hearing from him well why is there not you know uh Direction being made or sense being given to this so when we look at Proverbs 11 23. the Bible says the desire and I want you to watch these words the desire of the righteous is only good that's a that's inward but the expectation of the wicked is wrathful the only hope of the wicked is Wrath and I want to just just take that just for a moment because when we take that word Focus you know how many times you've had people take focus focus focus you know sometimes you could be talking to your kids you're like Focus I'm in there like I'm look at man I'm looking I'm looking right at you you know my eyes all eyes and you're like go on Focus I mean you can tell when you know things are you know like Charlie Brown's teacher you feel that way as a parent right so we understand Focus what we're trying to say is give me your undivided attention and your mind don't be looking at me saying uh-huh mama and thinking about your clothes in the washer right we understand that right so notice I mean because you know nobody you would like to be able to ask the surgeon before you go in for surgery what are you thinking about today oh I tell you my car my Mercedes broke down and this and that of course those little things won't matter too much to a surgeon you know they got the money to put it up in no time but you know you just want to ask him hey was your coffee good this morning even when I go fix you a good cup right you want to make sure they're they're lined up just right right I don't want you to start I want you to be delicate so Focus to focus something is to have a central point that we're looking at and where all of our attention is pointed into or the activity it's where things are focused into and so just to say that God has always set his word to be the object of focus God has always done that he did it in Eden he's all the way to God has set his word to be the focus and through a life focusing in upon his word now remember I'm not talking about a letter yet the Living Word will always be the expression of the letter and the Living Word will never take away from the letter is that right just like a tomato plant comes up you've got all the writings on the back of the packet that describes the things that you're seeing that's the way the word of God describes when Christ is being made manifest and we recognize by the grace of God so God has always said his word to be the focus and when a life can be caught away from all of the cares and the distractions and the and the busyness and sometimes it's not just the external things sometimes it's the warring even within our own members but when that life can focus on him and focus on the word then there comes forth a relationship then there becomes a fellowship then there's a strengthening that a man will receive man or woman in his life that will will equip him to navigate through the Troublesome to melt tumultuous times of life as well as the pleasant times of life as well and so that Focus has always been upon him and and he's the word and God his presence God's presence will arise like like it has here in in this in this time you know this time is is very much described even as it was in the first coming of the Lord Jesus where it speaks of a great light shall arise and those who said in darkness are great light is sprung up God the light of his word of his presence has sprung up but what is it it's God fulfilling his word making his word to live just like take the example of the woman at the well the word begins to shine floor she doesn't understand everything but in the presence of the word what's what's happening there there's a connection taking place our fathers say this and she begins to go through things what's that her life is is it's now being opened by the presence of the word in right there and there's a relate there's a relationship there's that which is beginning to unfold and what God is doing is drawing out of that life that's been so clouded over with hurts and you know Daddy didn't care about me and Mama didn't care about me and all those things that was there that have been packed in our life and the word is drawing her by the supernatural presence of God is coming to a place to where now through the surrender of her life the invisible God will make himself known through her life I want you to think about this the prophets themselves were reflectors I don't know about you but I thought about like when I came in down here tonight man it's in the dark it's hard to see to turn in on that far driveway you know brother Sammy you're getting it I'm not that old yet but man it was hard for me to see to turn in but then you know as you come down thank goodness you know where the brothers they put up those reflective things to kind of Bend us around but a reflection a reflector is meant with properties to reflect the light so we can see the prophets were reflectors they were built by God that way ordained by God like God told Jeremiah I've ordained you to be a prophet before you were in your mother's womb and just as the prophets were ordained to be reflectors we as believers are ordained to be reflectors we are to be reflectors of his glory because everybody in our house and everyone in our family and our co-workers and everyone around us not everyone has received that glory in their life and don't know what makes you tick and what makes you act the way you do it what makes you make decisions the way you do but you don't have to explain all that you have to just let the glory be revealed because that's what's getting the tension is the glory being revealed it's a pathway hey there's a surety there's something different about this man or woman they don't just talk it and it's just not a religious practice there's something different about them Christ is their life he says not a part of one day out of the week or two days out of the week out of a social Affair no he's their life it's a reflection so what is our Focus Psalms 37 34. we read something out of this chapter the last week but I want to just move back in wait on the Lord and keep his way how do you keep the way of the Lord is it where we just sat down with a word and we're reciting the word or well the word said do this and so I'm going to do that in one way yes but the real way that we keep his way is that his life is in US that's how we keep his way that's how we keep it is where it's no longer where us and the book are separate but now we are one these shall no longer be Twain but they're one right so that's how we keep his way by allowing the word wait on the Lord Lord how do I waiting on you allowing the word to saturate down into our life allowing it to break out all the greenness in our life we're we're not here in a holding pattern and saying I wish so-and-so would hurry up and come in because I want to go in a rapture we are waiting not on the last one to come into this church they might already be here we're waiting on them to get baptized into the body of Jesus Christ by the Holy Ghost but my waiting is on the Lord because God is still working in my life as well I've often pondered that thought this isn't this is my thoughts and I'm not preaching my thoughts but I've often wondered about even with that statement where does that also lie with maturity as well within that life you know it's just that the the ways of the Lord are beyond our mind of finding out to me I'll just say it like this if it's another 10 years I'm going to enjoy in Jesus the world will get worse that's true but I'm not going to get disheartened I'm not going to throw away my experience because 1977 wasn't something I made something say the prophet never said that men made that say that way come on Friends you know my expectation is of the Lord let me just put it simple the coming of the Lord is what I expect I expect him to come in this service I expect him if he tarries tonight expecting to come in the morning and guide me through the day I'm expecting the coming of the Lord that's why the Rapture the prophet said it will not be a hard thing for the Church of the Living God why because for Enoch just another day as a believer keep his way and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land when the wicked are cut off Thou shalt see it so that's why you know we're not under an anointing to get picket signs and we don't agree with abortion but we're not under the anointing and to go out there and protest this and protest that we are not under that anointing we are under the anointing of rapture the wicked is going to go on and continue to do wickedly the main thing is is that where you stand you stand and I stand in where can we say as for me and my house we will serve the Lord I don't have no effect on anybody else I can't even affect the house across the street but as for me and my house let me tell you where we're going to stand we are going to serve the Lord verse 35. I have seen the wicked in great power and spreading himself like a Green Bay Tree like not that he is because a Green Bay Tree is one of those it's one of the five types of trees that would be mentioned in the scripture that are very can be a very precious tree but it's just like remember when lot looked upon Sodom he saw the planes and it was even as The Garden of God he didn't say it was I don't want look-alikes I told you before I had a guy coming through the neighborhood when we first built our house the other house we lived in and he pulled up in this hatchback trunk and things like that and he was going to sell me Thomas Kincaid paintings but your car don't match what you're selling I mean come on we've been to Christian bookstores you know Thomas Kincaid you know you know what it is getting a mortgage document out and let's buy it what was he selling knockoffs I'm asking how much you want for him 50 bucks these are knockoffs buddy I I wasn't born yesterday and your car don't match what you're selling nothing wrong with your car but you understand what I'm saying it was light but it wasn't the real thing and God ain't coming back after a church that's like what he said he's coming back after a bride that is what he said because that like a green beige oh my what a what a what a beautiful thing within that but I want to just go on for a sake of time in verse 36 yet talking of the wicked he passed away and lo he was not yea I sought him but he could not be found so he but somebody or something or whatever in this life but the wicked I couldn't find him I looked around after after all that was done here this I couldn't find them remember brother Brown talks about how that you'd go over to Egypt and you'd have to dig down to get to those pyramids remember that's how the pyramids are even exposed they've had to dig down right but all Moses how that that life that surrendered to God that name goes on look at this this is where I really want to draw from in 37 37 37. mark the perfect man and behold the upright for the end of that and then he knows God always has Witnesses still God's got to witness and no matter what it is that a person could be fit God's got a witness to say there's overcoming Grace for that I'm an overcomer well brother Sammy I deal with this there's overcoming Grace for that it's not it's not me it's not me better than you it's nobody bad there is over I'm as a witness to tell you I once was pound but I'm free this overcoming Grace God has got a witness he's got testimonies of his glory trophies of his unmerited grace where his life reflects to be the same yesterday today and forever verse 38 but the transgressors shall be destroyed together the end of the wicked shall be cut off oh I like this in verse 39 will you read this with me but the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord he is their strength in the time of trouble let me just say thank you Lord salvation and he didn't say you'll have a picnic the rest of the way you serve me everything will just be smooth and peachy and creamy and sprinkles on top and powdered sugar everywhere no there's gonna be trouble but I will be your strength [Applause] I will be your sufficient grace through it all read verse 40 with me will you and the Lord shall help them and deliver them he shall deliver them from the wicked and save them because they trust in him and there's no doubt there's testimonies all through this right here of situations and not that we are classifying because God can always turn a life around remember Bert brother Branham went hunting with Burton Bert seemed to be like wow this guy man this guy is cold crew remember the brand described him how he was but you see God began to move upon Bert's heart right brother Branham did not take Bert through five changes to be a better bird By Ernie God didn't do it that way God knew what it was an example brother random hands standing on the word and if you ask brother Branham let's just take into the conversation if you'll take about the conversation for a moment in as far as humanly naturally carnally it didn't seem like there was anything going for birth but God knew what was down inside a bird he just needed the prophet to be a witness and pray for his soul hmm now let's get back into our scripture 37 there mark the perfect man and that don't mean go around with a spray paint can and spray them and behold the upper for the end of that you are and what you are you do have people who are influential in your life and you have people that you look up to I don't care I we I don't worry I've got scripture I'm coming to every one of us we have certain things of influences and things can be even in our life certain things sometimes that we can look at but this is such a direction for the word of God they don't like how God God does it all together God does not spend his time there's things that God has to say don't do this and don't do that but God knows there is something greater if you can just get a vision before you of what's real then everything that is the Do Not will flee God is that that could be the reality think about it when the Holy Spirit great Mama Eagle came over the Barnyard as she began to hover and begin to scream he began to lose sight of the chickens that was around him and he was still on the ground he began to lose sight of her you're never this and this is what you are and this is what you are you'll always be this and this is what you are you look strange you're funny you got big feet and you know the wings and the beat oh you're an odd guy you're an object he had heard that the whole time but finally there was a voice that he couldn't understand but it it fit him like a glove it was something that began to call to something and awaken something on the inside it was something that was a true positive not something that was trying to conform him to make him a chicken but it's something that just said this is who you really are [Applause] and we get a glimpse of who we really are and stay locked in on it sin flees every message will strike the intended age through a yielded vessel God's always had to have a vessel that's willing to step aside like the Seven Stars in the right hand remember those stars reflect the Brilliance the glory the power the authority of him of who he is and you know Not only would it call the reflection of that life Not only would it call to the elect in that hour but that leadership and I want you to listen to this now but that leadership through a Vindicated life that was consecrated to the word of the Lord would be an example to the Believers in that hour I mean how could you have confidence if the what if the vessel that's preaching don't live what's being preached come on now that's why I do not accept nonsense of well you got to follow what brother Brandon said you know in the quotes about Christmas but don't that's nonsense come on now I mean he's not going to be a true prophet in the pulpit in the Pagan at home come on now I mean it just don't make sense whatsoever but you see within it because a message and his messenger one and I'm not just talking about I'm doing my all the way through there has to be an example of that word on display because you and I both know it word alone will never do it when you watch I watch deep caught the Deep we're not seeing where we're seeing the word these son of man revealed through a son of man it's Christ being revealed I can follow that as far as Theology and words and memorizing this scripture and that that's been had down through time but this is different this is the promise coming of the son of man himself it's different Mark the man Mark that reality Mark that expression Mark that husband Mark that Pastor Mark that Father Mark that mother Mark that wife Mark that brother Mark that sister why are we marking him because it's Christ being reflected in them it's a real example are you with me so this is why Paul would say in First Corinthians 4. 14. I'm not writing these things to shame you but as my beloved Sons I warn you for though you have ten thousand instructors in Christ yet you have not many fathers for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel wherefore I beseech you be your followers of me now this is this principle of following is not new everybody's following somebody you know you've heard the cliche even if it's following their own dumb self everybody's following somebody but what you got to make sure is who you're following who are they following that's what's important who are they following when are they getting their influence from that's why your children your children are going to look at you your life is going to interpret what this message is make sure it's a right interpretation that it's Jesus Christ on display I'm talking about you and me being perfect nobody in here nobody could be perfect in their own flesh but it's his life his nature the token on display that is the stop for every decision right in other words you can't just pass Globe go without collecting 200 you got to come through and let's check it out Paul said another place boy I wonder if Paul was just full of himself be your followers of me even as I also am of Christ you know what Paul what is being said because remember there could be many instructors but we've got one father we've been fathered in the Faith by this revealed word it has not produced a bunch of branhams remember beyond the curtain of time are these all branhams no these are your converts right these are the children of God that have been begotten by the spirit and the word is that right so when it's all said and done it's just like when it comes down to it what brother random had said and you're going to take me in the scriptures and take me around and come up with the different conclusions sorry it's like the answer to a math test if you get a different answer you're going the wrong way are you with me God's already given us the answers and we don't have to try to figure it out well I've got to figure this out and I've got he is the one to lead us oh what a rash that that presents you see when we can live within the word and the message of the hour to recognize it is the rest of the holy spirit that has come to you and I it's not for me to figure it out it's to surrender and let it live itself out amen so we are affected and influenced by the invisible God remember everybody is being affected and influenced from an invisible Realm I mean you can go down to the jails tonight it's not just from jails you can go down to people walking right down the street seem to be good and you know people and everything else but where is their influence I'm gonna say well how do I know what's their steps their steps will tell you what they're focusing on and when you find out what they're focusing on you know who's behind the what right remember when brother Brown saw the vision of the Brian I want you just to keep this in mind for a statement I'll make your Lord willing in a bit when he saw the vision of the Bride remember the church the bride came in preview once that Alpha bride then you have the church comes in preview and the church is just going off going off and what was she following see she wasn't just going off by herself you with me the preview of the what was she following she was following a witch right Paul identified in the book of Galatians seducing Spirits also in the book of Timothy what are they to do what's a seducing Spirit to do get you off of the right path right and notice she's following that it's religious in realm and remember she went right off into judgment screaming now before I get to that last part of the Bride you and I coming into view so we're affected and influenced by the invisible realm I I believe with all my heart that God has I'm being affected by the Lord how many drunk women say Lord I believe I'm being affected by you my life and and you know what I I want my life to continue to be affected and influenced Lord by you I I don't want to get caught up in this world matter of fact I'm very intentional about that I don't want nothing to do with this world I don't want nothing to do with there let me hand you a curriculum on how to be a boy let me hand you and I don't want nothing to do with that verse 17 of second Corinthians 4 for our light of fiction is but for a moment it working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory while we look not this is us while we look not at the things what you're seeing so he's talking about going through tests going through trials and we are not going to become wrapped up in the afflictions because we are walking by the things which are not which we're not wrapped up in that which is seen But at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are are not seen are Eternal so I just say it like this it's a very it's a reality of maintaining the right Focus parents you know this uh all of us going down the road nowadays you know I mean how many you see videos of people at home and a text from so and so and how many times you see laws are passed signs are put up no texting driving how many times you see people drive by you the same way you do slow down and let them go let them go you know what I don't want my car here I got insurance but I'm not interested I got places to go I don't want to get tied up in that and who knows right but the same mouth thought God does have his hand in our life but God also gave us a brain between our ears too and Common Sense is that right so it's it maintained the right Focus you can have oh my goodness look at this over here like my wife will tell me over and over you know I'm going by fields and I'll be looking at Edge lines and things I'd be way out there hundreds of yards and things and I just kind of look for them keep your eyes on our own honey don't be looking for them dear come outside oh my goodness look at that buck and that's it going to get your eyes why she didn't that she don't like deer she enjoys eating them when they're brought home but she wants to get home right so I got somebody there to say get your eyes back on the road now do I not know to keep my eyes on the road come on that's one-on-one ABCs of driving right we all know that like Dad I got that down maintaining the right Focus because the bride at the back remember she's the bride I want you to think about that we're the bride but the bride got to looking at the way the church was going the bride got caught up she was starting to look at they're doing this oh they're doing this or they're doing this you see the more that you watch the church which is Nations politics and everything else your walk will start deviating towards that but how did the prophet straighten it out he never said I reached over there and grabbed their hand and said get back in line he said no I had to stay focused on the word and then by staying focused on the word it'll bring her back in line thank God for the holy spirit thank God for ordained men thank God for Real Husbands wives and fathers and mothers let us stay focused on the work that if the enemy would try to start going this way there's a focus we're not going that way this is the way we're going and the word will correct the error and because she's the bride right back instead that's the quality let's look at Psalm 73 here just for a moment now this is ASAP you know just just to I want to just interject here just a moment upon this this particular thing if we could go Psalm 73 verse 2 and uh I'll read fast and you follow fast and listen here's ASAP remember I want you to know who ASAP is Asap is one of the the lead musicians in other words this guy was the one who's arranging all the music in the song services he's the one that's over I'm not making that up that's that's ASAP but I want you to notice what asaph gets to looking at and this is his testimony verse two but as for me my feet we're almost gone my steps had well and I slipped why for I was envious at the foolish when I saw the prosperity of the wicked Here I Am The Righteous and they're getting a promotion at work and they're doing this and bless God give me the sign I'm gonna go protest against them well we're getting down to home cooking now aren't we see that's a trap what's it doing you're becoming vexed it's a trial it's a trial instead of saying Lord give me strength Lord to bring out of me I don't want because they're springing through other things out of me it's bringing the Old Samuel out it's bringing the old bill out and I don't want the old Bill coming out I don't want the old Brian coming out I don't want the old Shane coming out I don't want that for I was envious at the foolish when I saw the prosperity of the wicked in other words just coming down and all of a sudden we'd revert back in almost like that child it ain't Fair I mean there's a lot of things that's not fair for there are no bands in their death but their strength is firm they just pass they are not in trouble as other men neither are they plagued like other men therefore Pride Compass them about as a chain violence covered them as a garment aren't you thankful that the Holy Ghost is your garment aren't you thankful you've got a garment that there is a a life on the inside that desires to please God aren't you grateful you've got strength on the inside when this Pride part would want to rise up but there's that righteousness on the inside that says I desire to please him Above All Things what is it that's the real wedding garment that's the Garment of the Holy Ghost but their pride is so isolated them verse 7 their eyes stand out with fatness they have more than heart could wish they are corrupt and speak wickedly concerning oppression they speak loftily they set their mouth against the heavens and their tongue walketh through the Earth therefore his people return hither and Waters a full cup are rung out to them and they say how does God know and there is knowledge in the most high behold these are the ungodly who prosper in the world they increase in riches now remember God doesn't have a problem with rich people so we don't want to look at that in the scripture God don't have a problem with that but remember what God said it's pretty hard for one who's rich to enter in the Kingdom of the heaven he said it's easier for a camel to enter the eye of the needle which is a gate going into Jerusalem he also said in book of Corinthians that you see there's not many Rich among you neither is there many lies in this world oh my God so God don't have a problem with riches now let's just look at this verily now watch watch this watch these statements right here verse 13 and verse 14. verily this is asaph I have cleansed my heart in vain and washed my hands in innocency for all the day long have I been plagued and chastened every morning what he's been looking at I ask you has it affected his thinking it has he's beginning to look at his life as though some reward and look look it looks like I'm getting the short end of the deal here now I know asaph does not have the privilege of having the Holy Ghost like you and I do but he had it according to the measure and what God could allot within that time they never had it as an indwelling it would move and come but we we recognize within it my point is this right here what we look at and what we focus on does it affect us or have we got so big and so revelated that don't matter don't matter I know brother Ram's a prophet I know this message is the truth I know I'm the bride well the thing of it is is this I don't want to get in the Chariot with somebody who wants to ride close to the edge I want to get in I don't believe in tree hugging but I believe in Mountain hugging I want to ride in the chair the one that says I don't know I can't get that close to the edge like that but I'll tell you one thing I'll stay close to the mountain I want to stay close to Christ Jesus I know I'm safe there it might be things over the Samuel you're fine in doing that it might be true but until he gives me the direction or the approval I ain't losing out on nothing because the one thing I don't want to lose out on is his fellowship and I don't want to miss the rapture so anything else that I have to lose fine he'll give me Grace for it because evidently it wasn't something I needed nor would be able to handle in this life verse 15 if I say I will speak thus behold I should offend against the children of thy children now watch this a generation of thy children when I thought to know this it was too painful for me read verse 17 with me would you until I went into the sanctuary of God then understood I their end aren't you glad that there's a place where things can be made sense the sanctuary of a god it's a sense maker helps us to make sense and the sanctuary it isn't just this place right here but it's dwelling in his presence you can invade the presence of God your home is a sanctuary your life is a sanctuary your bedroom is a sanctuary we are to dwell in the sanctuary of the Lord but ASAP what happened I got to looking at the wrong thing I started becoming envious I started saying why is this for them and not for me and why I was trying to but you're looking at the wrong thing you can't get understanding by looking at the world you'll only get grief and bitterness and sorrow but if you will make a point oh man I can't make sense of all this just get in the sanctuary of the Lord say Lord I just need to get in your presence and when I got in his presence this is what asaph said when I got on his presence then I understood they're in you know when ASAP realized everything I was seeing it was temporal it meant nothing it puts everything back in perspective I'm glad that we've got a place that we can go there were things could be brought back in perspective because you and I both get out of perspective with things you and I have certain perspective we have certain things I'm talking about even as born-again Believers we need the spirit of God that's why we need the word Discerning the thoughts and intents of our heart so thank God where there can be a real placing of true perspectives and things can be examined through the lens of the word oh sure we we can be told no on things that maybe that we really want or want to do but ultimately what we want more than we want our wants is we want his will right ma what a fitting service on Saturday or Sunday night so we cannot afford to become entangled into things of the world look at this in verse 18. surely thou didst set them in slip replaces and thou cast them down in destruction and how are they brought to Desolation as in a moment they are utterly consumed with terrors Mark the perfect man and behold the upright for the end of that man is peace remember Jesus Jesus would actually give indicators and say remember Lot's wife three words she started out as an overcomer but she never fully surrendered her heart you started out an overcomer but what happened the calls from Sodom now what did Brother Brown say brother bran said it was this cries and calls of her grandchildren explain that I can't he said it was those calls that she began to be drawn back in upon that in other words let's just put it this way it's things that was Affinity or that pulled upon the heartstrings of her life Satan knows what strings because you know why he's pulled him in our lives before right before God before God does a full workout Satan knows it I mean he knows he knows the packages he's delivered at our house before God has sealed us with the Holy Spirit he knows that's why even after the seal has come the enemy will still try to come and test you but you're able to say nope that old boy don't live here no more sorry return to Satan the spies they went over Israel they refused to enter the land of the Holy Ghost and see what happened those that refused to follow the lord and side on this side of the transjordan the tribe of GAD let's just deal with the tribe of God you're aware so am I the maniac of gadera look what became around that Community they didn't want to move up the Holy Ghost as a matter of fact they said get out of here we don't need that stuff Jesus went across the sea because there was one we don't know his name we will on the other side a maniac of gadera look what their choice did oh they might have had whorehouse said oh or this and all that but what about your children what about everything else your choice is just not about you my choice is not just about me I'll give an account for this assembly I'll give an account for my family oh I don't want nobody else looking at me you don't have that choice you don't have that choice I don't have that choice either but I do have a choice that I can follow him what about the Rich Young Ruler in Lazarus can I have just a few more moments what about Lazarus and the Rich Young Ruler look at their Pathways the Rich Young Ruler where it took him in in life a man that was so staunch on the wrong law I've done this I've done that on doing this I've done that I've done that and a prophetic eye in this age picks him up at where he wouldn't even give the crumbs to a beggar broke the law what happened he got away from everything he had been walking in and when he turned down life eventually compromise compromise compromise it's important when we come face to face with eternal life what we do with it who would have thought that young man who Jesus could look at and know this young man had kept the Ten Commandments he was impeccable character a respectable young man that yet he made a fatal decision because he valued his possessions more than eternal life there's a pathway to follow we see that there's a pathway I want to just say it in this manner if we'll follow him the greatest words that he said come follow me and I want to follow him I believe I am and I want to continue because if you'll follow the voice of God that's speaking to your heart if you hear this if you're here tonight or one that would hear this message and you've looked at your life as impossibilities if you'll just give way to the voice instead of what you can do but accept what he's already done and begin to set your heart upon him I'm quoting a prophet he said he that will take you into the cycle of the new birth because you're following him so many times people get they get down well I didn't feel this or this or that it ain't about a feeling we can have feelings I thank God for feelings it's about this on the inside right here this is what the real change is you'll hear Brother Brown I I just don't have time you can hear brother I'm talking and giving direction in for those who's coming in prayer and adoption part one but there's a change on the inside that takes place now think about this it's important as we said earlier to know who you're following and who that person is following I mean my wife she wants to make sure that but she doesn't she doesn't hold me to it she knows that I'm following the Lord and if there's something that gets a little bit out of track she's there to help me not to side with me oh we're going to preach now you know you're right honey that family or that this or that no that ain't going to help me that's going to continue to set me and my family and the rest of the church off thank God for real help me so to be able to look at and say oh that's not how we're going to approach that not how we're going to do this no she hasn't had to do that too much but you understand whether it's job whatever it is we want to side with the word so if we're starting to go off thank God let it be somebody that's able to say this is the word why we can direct our feet back on the ways of the word because the word itself is his nature is his character it's his life right think of this Rebecca followed Eliezer who followed Abraham who followed God right here's the Paradox within it all though through all that yielding it was still a personal relationship that Rebecca had God as a reality to me Eliezer had a personal revelation God is a reality to me Abraham had a personal reality God is a reality to me so the Paradox in it all that Rebecca following Eliezer following Abraham following god well listen it was Christ's leading through the channel that's why in our lives we don't want to be a kink in the holes we want to be a channel right just as from the husband down to the wife from father down to mother we will not be a kink in it and let me just contort that no but I want to let it flow as the anointing oil would flow from Aaron's head down his beard down his garments down to his brother Samuel my husband or my my wife don't worry about them let it flow through you because the way it'll flow through you what will be in effect upon them if there's anything to be effect upon anybody it will take Christ in us to be effect upon one another is that right we can't we can't and we do not convert people by giving them the laws or the governments of the word you know I'm quoting to you now you don't do that that will not convert all that does is bring Rebellion you talk about raising up a cane and we ain't talking about the chicken place either you're talking about racing something up like that why because if it's a law it will raise Rebellion so what does it have to be it's got to be Grace live through you it's got to be grace to live through you and you know what it's going to take a whole lot of Grace for you a whole lot of Grace for me to let Grace be lived through my life for somebody else but there was one who did it for me matter of fact there was more than just one the one that made all the difference was the Lord Jesus then it just continues to come right down through the master of the age through the pastor through father and mother through oh my it just keeps going glory be to God that's why we're not a broken sister and we're not a stagnant pool his life is flowing in this fountain and you know the end itself is not something you have to wait for Mark that man behold the upright for the end is peace notice that you don't have to wait till the end I wonder what's going to become out of that I wonder what's going to happen now that no you don't have to wait you look at the direction they're going and it'll tell you what the outcome is going to be right I mean this is I know this is really simple this is Elementary but that's probably why I was in elementary school teacher I like simple things if I want to go to Cleveland I know better than to get on Route 2 going west Cleveland ain't West and I can't get on there and say I can't wait to get to Cleveland who well how are you going to get there when you're going towards Toledo what is your focus because whatever you're focused on is going to affect your thinking it's going to affect your meditation it's going to affect your talking don't you we can't fool and say oh I can ingest this and I can digest this and I can feed on this for so many hours of the day and it ain't gonna bother me no no no let me get around you for a little bit and I can tell what your focus is because whatever your focus is your conversation is going to be dominated by it is that right now they ain't putting nobody down but it's to see look how easy those things can happen instead I believe everybody in there you wouldn't be to you want beard or not I mean it took sacrifice to come on a Thursday night right you didn't depressed Beyond tiredness and weariness and probably had to bring you know toothpicks to prop your eyes open and everything else you know but the reality of it is is you realize if I can just get around this word I don't know all that's going to happen but if I can just be affected I can receive strength right here tonight that will affect my walk tomorrow it'll affect me the next day and you know what what is it how does it affect you it causes you to come right back into the prince of God tomorrow when you wake up you realize he ain't left you he ain't pulled back from me he's been right there all the time glory be to God in the highest mm-hmm Hallelujah let's go to this let me end up with this quote right here in second Corinthians second grade it's actually a scripture in this quote second Corinthians 9 24 and I'm more close here I know you think I will wait and see but I really am another Ryan I really am but once you notice notice what notice how Paul puts the Christian walk or walk no you're not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize this is out of the quote right there so Ron how do I run that you may obtain now I know I've got there's runners in this place tonight okay bless your heart I'm a walker are they gonna happen my knees will last longer than yours that was free that's not doctoral that's just free but how do you run What if I what if I came down through here and I'm like this you see what happens I start staggering almost fell over there oh it's because you don't got a good balance you know you're 47 years old and you're particular over to the matriculum no no no I won that what was it very simple my focus my very simple thing see the things that's made to be so complex it's my focus I mean no more than you could go to Cleveland going West on route 2. let's say you're going to Cleveland yes man I'm on the right way right I guess there's people that do that going to Cleveland yes someone the right way and they're heading the right way but what if they're driving going towards Cleveland I hope I'm pointing the right direction am I right nobody wants to answer that so if I'm going this way what if I'm looking at everything that's behind me in the rear view mirror what's going to happen listen I'm not brother Trevor he he gives the trick questions I'm not I can't my mind my brain ain't there that's a different gift altogether man you're going to rash you're going to cry you're gonna crash you're gonna wreck up right if you're looking at a rear view mirror so you can't eat you have to look at what's in front of you Mark the perfect man behold the upright and there's only one perfect one among us and that's Christ and I want you to remember he's in his body if you want to see the Lord Jesus look in his body because it's himself his word being revealed in the lives of his people let me finish this quote a crown given to the winner of the Olympic race was a Garland of olive branches but the crown given here in Revelation is given to a martyr that is the crown of royalty Jesus calls it the Crown of Life The One Crown is for those who striven and the other is for those who have given so striven or given both crowns are incorruptible they will not perish and the winners of the worldly race of life will soon lose the joy of the plaudits of the world wow so there's going to be some winners of the worldly race right they're going to have the big goal stand on the box winner yes we're the and they're gonna be the winner of the worldly can I say it rat race of life keeping up with keeping up on who's keeping up with who's keeping up and keeping up with the the joy and the planets of the world their Glory will fail but those who give their lives for God now watch how he says it's so simple either by daily striving or shedding their blood as the crowning sacrifice of their lives will be given the crown of life now the martyrs had to give seal the testimony their testimony with their life is that right but here we are daily striving you know what that tells me with striving there's opposition there's things wanting to pull there's pressure how many of you drove on that one drove in the Wind on the way to church tonight fun not at all you're trying to keep you know and you're like boy I'm glad I don't got a big SUV you know I don't have to worry you know you and here it is I mean the wind is just man it's blowing and it's rocking right but there's a striving that has to be done and that's striving itself sometimes with that striving as it's pressing against all the world and the things that the world wants to hold us parents can appreciate this right here there's a lot of things that likes to try to come in try to influence some things that are tried to be handed the enemy wants to come in even and through innocent channels to project its substance you wonder why you wonder why homosexuality is the way it is that's a no-brainer you know why because it started back with funny things back there in the 60s and 70s on sitcoms what is it funny lives down the guard it just lowers it look where it's at now I mean they rejected the word we understand but look at everything it's no surprise to where it is it is commonplace right sin this is a day where sin is glorified sin is regarded as a standard of virtue brother Ram talked about that when he spoke to young people he spoke about of a play they put out about Sodom and Gomorrah where somebody in that play on Simon gomar said concerning that of Sodom gomar the things that you call evil is what I call virtue see that's how what's happened where has the world been given that through oh brother Samuel they shouldn't have been messing with the Ouija boards no they were given that from church religion that's where that came in religion oh my where am we at here all too little time let's stand as I read this last one this last little part all too little time is spent on laboring for the Eternal rewards of God thank you the recompense of God is too lightly esteemed if we believe in the reality of the resurrection of the body and an eternal Kingdom of substance then we ought to lay up into heaven those good Treasures that are available to the faithful Saints in other words did it really what's your focus what are you laboring for what are you laboring for I mean I say this because I've got young parents and those of God Terry's to be parents and on and on but you know it's always something that even when it came to our children you can get your life wrapped up in your children and it'll take you right out well I got to do this for them and I got to do this and what happens is is it'll take you right away take it right away from where God has for you very innocent thing very innocent very innocent but brother Samuel there are children but you want the presence of God to move right back and you want them to be under the influence of the Holy Spirit as much as you possibly can keep it in their life I'm preaching to all that even includes his grandparents and how we give you know certain things sometimes we understand we're living in a Time where things that's just one example of something that can be so innocent and it can just taking our Focus away and we become like driving through a rear view where the only thing we know is oh how I was with God at one time why are you that that's back there where are you now if right now just stop and say Lord get me right back on track get me right back on track let me get on the right road now you know there's been times you get you exited off on the wrong road so did I but when you recognize you got off on the wrong road what do you do turn around and get back on the right Road brother Brown talked about that in his own life with that complex and things like that he said I was on a certain road but I'm on a different road now see it's it's honing in it's focusing where's our focus at who's it who's it upon who who because whatever the who is behind it and it'll tell us wherever it's leading us wherever it's directing us I I want to I want my life to be completely under his influence we're living in the hour thus saith the amen no other age could say that but the amen is the what the so be it the final word not only is this the final age and the final outpouring not only is the finishing of the mystery of God but it should be the way our life is lived Lord we've got this decision before us it might seem so innocent for myself or whoever I want to know what the amen says about it I want to know if the amen amends it right that's what we want to do I well Lord I amen no I'm not I don't want my amen I want his amen because when he commands it then I can amen it and I can amen it with confidence because I know the amen and what is the amen he's The Vindicator he's the confirmer he's the one I can rest on and say this is this is God's Direction in leadership and like as brother Trevor was dealing with that on Sunday finding the will of God just because I ain't heard nothing from him don't mean that he's like go ahead buddy buddy you ain't heard nothing from me it's all good no we wait the bride no one can persuade her to do otherwise not even her own feelings oh God help us to get there and live there that's where I want to live at that quote to me is not a quote of condemnation it's a quote that calls me to what God has equipped within my life Lord help me to realize my feelings sometimes will be against that but let me not be persuaded by my feelings or my thoughts let's pray Heavenly Father Lord I'm sure throughout this this building those on the internet and on and on Lord Jesus would ask and desire to be remembered in prayer and we do we ask the Lord I ask not only for Lord each and every one I ask for myself Lord those that would be streaming or will stream it help us Lord not to we don't want to take things for granted Lord but help us sometimes it's a striving out and that striving Lord is within our own self it's striving Lord oh not against Lord wrongful desires the grace of God by the New Birth has delivered us from that but it Lord God there can be Lord is striving against our own human nature Lord striving against our own feelings striving against things Lord but I believeth on My Heart Lord I'm a witness and I know there's others that can say your grace is sufficient Lord sometimes Lord like Noah we've had to wait on you Lord we've had to wait wait on the Lord and keep his way Lord Jesus help us Lord not just as the Lord father and a mother husband wife Pastor Deacon on and on and on and on young person Lord we want to be an example a display a witness not to draw attention to ourselves but we we want our lives to be a reflection that Lord It's like a road sign that would be as a marker yes same way keep going this way Lord I Thank You For example as the Lord throughout the congregation Paul wrote of that he admonished the order men older women older brothers older sisters he admonished the families he admonished them Lord of how that the example of the things that would be given an example that could be followed Paul even also wrote to Timothy and told Timothy don't despise your youthfulness but be an example Lord God so it doesn't matter age age itself is not the indicator it's how yielded that we can be to you Lord that's the kind of life Lord a reflection and not just for others that'll come that that will come we're living Lord because a desire is to please you how many tonight just with our heads about to say Lord that's my desire I just want to please you Lord I believe I am but I help me Lord help me in this striving help me Lord with every decision that leaves before us we're living in an hour that we cannot afford to have our lives Tangled Up as you told the prophet don't get your lines tangled up in these kind of times Lord God help us the Lord we're not to live in fear but if we can only take the admonition of the word of God not to look at things around us not to even look at the world or its worldly commentators to try to interpret to us of where we are but Lord to keep our eyes on Jesus help us Lord help us to look away to Jesus if Lord God any of us Lord anything in our life has become the focus something Lord God that maybe we went all together regard as sinful but yet when it comes down to it Lord it might be an attitude something we've given place to maybe it's bitterness maybe it's resentment maybe it's an unforgiveness what whatever it is Lord I booked out confidence in you that you've already dealt with our hearts and even now that Lord Jesus we don't want anything to detour us out of the way we don't want to drive looking in the rear view mirror neither do we want to be headed the wrong direction but I'm thankful I'm thankful oh I'm so thankful tonight that like asaph that as we come into the sanctuary of almighty God We Gather under the presence of almighty God in the Shekinah Glory that life that fills our life and Lord God in your presence things that's where sense is made not that we understand it all but Lord God we understand that Beyond everything of this life beyond my feelings Beyond everything else what's most important is him I want to follow him I don't know how to get through this trial but he'll lead me through and when I come out I will not be weaker I will be stronger in him it'll be less of Samuel but it'll be more Jesus because what needs to be gotten out in the valley of baka will be gotten out but there'll be a refreshing poured out I'm on my way I'm on my way I'm on my way home anybody join me tonight I'm on my way home I'm on my way home I'm coming from eternity I'm going back to Eternity I come from God I'm going back to God my focus my feet Granite Lord

and seeth she tapped on the shoulder of Eliza said who is this man now she's seen a lot of men along the journey but this right here was different who is this you know what it was the character of the
