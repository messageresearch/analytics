[23:13] to turn right into the word of the Lord
[23:14] and about you to stand I want to go
[23:18] right here into scriptures tonight we
[23:27] want to just go I want to go straight to
[23:30] Hebrews 10 go back into this and just a
[23:33] little direction we want to take tonight
[23:35] with this here in Hebrews chapter 10
[23:39] verse 23 and we want to just look into
[23:46] that here verse 23 of Hebrews chapter 10
[23:53] it says let us hold fast the profession
[23:56] of our faith without wavering for he is
[24:01] faithful that promise and let us
[24:04] consider one another to provoke unto
[24:08] love and to good works not forsaking the
[24:12] assembling of ourselves together as the
[24:16] manner of some is but exhorting one
[24:20] another and so much the more as you see
[24:24] the Day approaching Amen let's just bow
[24:28] our heads in a word of Prayer tonight
[24:30] Lord Jesus we we love you more
[24:35] we just appreciate you Lord father we
[24:39] just Lord as we Lord have come out here
[24:42] Lord tonight we have sacrificed to be
[24:45] Lord in your house and we have not Lord
[24:49] placed that as though before you but
[24:51] we're aware in our hearts that Lord we
[24:55] have not come here to be seen we have
[24:58] not come here just to occupy a time or
[25:01] to save it we have fulfilled a duty we
[25:05] have come here tonight Lord because as
[25:07] you promised in your word wherever two
[25:10] or three are gathered together in my
[25:12] name there will I be in their midst Lord
[25:15] we know that this is not a protracted
[25:17] gathering the Lord it's a time where you
[25:20] come Lord and you minister to our lives
[25:24] in a personal way and you know every
[25:27] need Lord that's gathered here tonight
[25:29] Lord and you're the only one that can
[25:31] meet those needs so Lord in whatever
[25:34] channel in whatever way Oh God Lord that
[25:38] you would choose Lord to minister to the
[25:40] needs of your people Lord we just come
[25:43] to present ourselves Lord as lives that
[25:46] are available Oh God
[25:48] that you could come and Lord use us Lord
[25:51] for your glory and we ask that God that
[25:54] you'll just move among us Lord and may
[25:56] our hearts be warmed in your presence
[25:59] tonight Lord and when Lord the service
[26:02] Lord it's all said and done
[26:04] may it be Lord echoed from our hearts
[26:06] that it was good to be in the house of
[26:08] God and didn't on our heart burn within
[26:11] us as he talked to us along the way Lord
[26:15] you know our needs Lord every need
[26:17] that's a cross Lord the spectrum tonight
[26:20] God and we're just Lord looking to you
[26:23] that you will now minister Lord to every
[26:26] heart father according to our needs we
[26:29] pray Lord we love you thank you once
[26:32] again in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[26:34] amen god bless your being seated I'd
[26:38] like if you turn with me
[26:40] in the scriptures here and let's go to
[26:44] the book first Corinthians chapter 14
[26:47] and I want to look at a few scriptures
[26:50] because we know that as as we as as the
[26:55] people of God when we come together that
[26:58] we're not just we're not just coming
[27:02] here to fulfill time or to say that well
[27:06] we've come to church we recognize that
[27:08] coming to church it's it is where God
[27:13] comes and he meets with us in a special
[27:16] way that there are needs that are
[27:19] present in each of our lives and across
[27:22] the spectrum in any in any given service
[27:26] there are there is going to be needs for
[27:29] deliverance there's going to be needs
[27:31] for salvation there will be needs for
[27:34] the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's a
[27:37] needs for healing in every service all
[27:39] of those needs are present and and God
[27:43] comes to minister to every need in a
[27:46] very personal way
[27:48] and it's one thing that I have just
[27:50] witnessed over the years you know I they
[27:53] were early on actually within pastoring
[27:55] and watch found that God will minister
[27:58] to the church and he will take things in
[28:02] a certain way and who will so bring us
[28:05] in the manner you know has sons and
[28:07] daughters of God then I've watched the
[28:08] Holy Ghost come right back around and
[28:10] he'll take us and he'll swing our feet
[28:12] over hell to make us realize that there
[28:15] is a real hell and there's a place that
[28:17] we don't want to go to and so God he
[28:21] doesn't do those things to bring fear
[28:23] that we would serve him out of a fear or
[28:27] a I think as the scripture says in the
[28:30] right term of that word fear where it's
[28:32] something that is slavish but God
[28:34] desires that we would serve him in a
[28:37] real reverence in a real love that
[28:40] everything that we do is because that we
[28:43] love him and so when Paul he Paul now is
[28:47] speaking to the Corinthian church and at
[28:50] first Corinthians 14:1 he speaks to
[28:54] to the believers and he says follow
[28:57] after charity now I just got done
[28:59] speaking in that chapter right before
[29:01] this on what charity is and he's dealing
[29:05] with how that charity should be the
[29:07] governing of everything that it's done
[29:11] so he says follow after charity and
[29:14] desire spiritual gifts but rather that
[29:18] you may prophesy for he that speaketh in
[29:21] an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men
[29:24] but unto God for no man understandeth
[29:27] him howbeit in the spirit he speaketh
[29:31] mysteries but he that prophesieth
[29:34] speaketh unto men to edification and
[29:38] exhortation and comfort and he that
[29:42] speaketh in an unknown tongue edifies
[29:45] himself but he that prophesies edifies
[29:49] the church now we understand that what
[29:52] Paul is speaking here on the prophecy is
[29:55] that which is the interpretation of the
[29:58] tongues that are given we understand
[30:00] that there are tongues of men and
[30:02] tongues of angels and Paul is is putting
[30:05] this separation here and he's
[30:07] ministering to that of the Corinthian
[30:09] church and he is telling them in many
[30:11] different chapters you go back to 1st
[30:13] Corinthians 10 and he lets them know
[30:16] that all of them saw the pillar fire
[30:18] they all drink of the rock they all ate
[30:20] of the manna Paul is letting them know
[30:22] do not your salvation is not based and
[30:25] brother Branham would say it this way on
[30:27] healing campaigns on seeing visions or
[30:30] any gear but our salvation is based
[30:33] exclusively on the redemptive work of
[30:37] the Lord Jesus Christ and that becoming
[30:39] personal in our life because it must be
[30:44] something that is completely with him
[30:46] because we know that Satan can
[30:48] impersonate any gift and our real rest
[30:52] is to be appalled that real comfort and
[30:55] peace of the Holy Ghost within our life
[30:58] that we were indeed included in
[31:01] Redemption and so then when that when
[31:04] when that is the basis of every
[31:07] thing then as we'll see as we look at
[31:10] this tonight when that is the real risk
[31:12] of the individual then God can use that
[31:16] person for his glory to be able to be a
[31:20] blessing to others to the body of Jesus
[31:24] Christ because they're not resting upon
[31:26] their gift in other words they do not
[31:29] have that it is not that where that they
[31:31] are feeling as though Victor or
[31:35] victorious if their gift is used
[31:37] they are VIP victory whether they are
[31:40] used once whether they are used twice
[31:42] whether they are used three times or
[31:45] whether they're not used at all they are
[31:47] living in victory so this is where Paul
[31:51] is trying to get the believer to have
[31:54] their faith based upon the right things
[31:56] now I want you to notice what he says
[31:58] here he's dealt in the scripture in
[32:00] verse four but he that prophesies
[32:02] edifies the church I would that you all
[32:06] spake with tongues but rather that you
[32:09] prophesied for greater is he that
[32:12] prophesies then he that speaketh with
[32:15] tongues except he interpret that the
[32:19] church may receive edifying now once you
[32:23] notice one word that you'll find here
[32:25] over and over and this is what I want to
[32:27] deal with here tonight you'll find the
[32:30] word edifying and the word edifying I
[32:33] want to look at that thought on godly
[32:35] edification when we read the scriptures
[32:39] here in Hebrews 10 we have come together
[32:42] and the church comes together with the
[32:45] promise when two or three are gathered
[32:48] together in my name there will I be in
[32:50] their midst and to recognize that when
[32:53] we come together there is to be and is
[32:57] an edifying a godly edification in our
[33:01] life now Paul would write about this and
[33:04] I'm just going to refer to it in first
[33:07] Corinthians 12 he spoke to the
[33:09] Corinthians and would say in verse 1 now
[33:12] concerning spiritual gifts brethren I
[33:14] would not have you ignorant you know
[33:17] it's we recognized Paul is speaking
[33:20] the church because when any person that
[33:24] when they have been baptized into the
[33:26] body of Jesus Christ by the Holy Ghost
[33:28] they are subject to any of the nine
[33:32] spiritual gifts brother Branham would
[33:35] say it over and over he says it just
[33:37] Mills throughout the body
[33:39] it can be on this one tonight on this
[33:41] one the next night and on this one here
[33:43] and so you know when we recognize Paul
[33:47] is saying what God has placed into your
[33:50] hands I do not want you to be ignorant
[33:53] with it but I want you to operate with
[33:56] understanding because when we have
[33:59] understanding and faith and that
[34:01] operating then we recognize what God has
[34:04] put within our hands there's a great
[34:06] reverence that is with him and Paul
[34:09] would go on in verse 31 of the st.
[34:11] chapter and he would say but covet
[34:14] earnestly the best gifts now Paul went
[34:16] through that chapter you can read it
[34:18] when you get home in 1st Corinthians 12
[34:20] and Paul is dealing with the differences
[34:23] of administration and how that it is the
[34:25] same spirit that worketh in all and so
[34:29] Paul is saying covet earnestly the best
[34:32] gift now Paul was not was not telling
[34:35] this you know we have to look at how
[34:36] that the the writers would interpret
[34:39] this Paul is not putting it in a manner
[34:42] as though that we are to rank well this
[34:45] gift is better than this gift but the
[34:47] word best here is Paul saying covet
[34:50] earnestly the those that are the most
[34:52] useful because there are gifts that are
[34:58] very useful to the body and Paul is
[35:02] dealing with here in one part of that of
[35:04] the tongues and how that tongues unless
[35:07] there be interpretation it is not useful
[35:11] to the body now we understand that you
[35:14] know and that within it all Paul would
[35:17] hear would express he would desire that
[35:20] everybody in verse 5 that all would
[35:22] speak in tongues but rather that we
[35:24] would prophesy why because prophesy it
[35:28] brings the edification to
[35:31] the Church of the Living God so remember
[35:34] this edification Paul goes on in verse 6
[35:37] and he says now brethren if I come unto
[35:39] you speaking with tongues what shall i
[35:42] profit you except I shall speak to you
[35:45] either by revelation or by knowledge or
[35:49] by prophesying or by doctrine I want you
[35:52] to notice what Paul is dealing with what
[35:54] shall it profit you the whole focus that
[35:58] is going on is that the body would be
[36:01] edified is that the body would be
[36:05] profited by what is done so this applies
[36:09] to everything done in the body in verse
[36:12] 7 even things without life giving sound
[36:15] whether pipe or heart except they give a
[36:18] distinction in the sounds how shall it
[36:20] be known what is piped or what is is
[36:24] harmed for if the trumpet give an
[36:26] uncertain sound who shall prepare
[36:29] himself to the battle and we understand
[36:34] as believers here you know the Spirit of
[36:37] God would direct the Prophet in this
[36:39] hour and he would minister over and over
[36:42] this theme of an uncertain sound and he
[36:47] would take it now let's you think of it
[36:49] he would take this and minister this on
[36:51] the uncertain sound and what it was
[36:53] there was known as he was dealing with
[36:56] there are scriptures that were being
[36:58] preached but the lack of bringing the
[37:01] people into the readiness of the coming
[37:04] of the Lord is an uncertain sound all
[37:08] the way down through the ages even from
[37:12] the outpouring of the Holy Ghost they
[37:14] were to take the gospel and the gospel
[37:16] was to call the people out from the
[37:21] world and into a relationship with Jesus
[37:24] Christ it was to be the word that would
[37:28] be preached that would convict the
[37:30] center of the condition he was in but
[37:33] would cause him to look to the
[37:35] all-sufficient sacrifice of Calvary and
[37:38] that his faith would raise to a
[37:41] to believe that indeed he was crucified
[37:44] for me and he rose again for me and then
[37:49] that faith would release to them a
[37:51] justification where the Lord of sin is
[37:54] lifted off of them and then they walked
[37:57] into the sanctification another further
[38:01] full of God's redemptive work and to the
[38:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost it is always
[38:07] been the gospel that is preached is to
[38:10] call men into the full relationship with
[38:14] Jesus Christ because the preaching of
[38:16] the gospel is always about the second
[38:20] coming of the Lord that he is coming and
[38:23] not only is he is coming in a corporal
[38:27] body but it is to declare that he is
[38:30] come he has returned he is not here in
[38:35] his corporal body but the Holy Ghost has
[38:38] come bad that same life that was the end
[38:42] the body of Jesus Christ that's now
[38:44] seated on the throne of God has come
[38:46] back upon the worshiper as a witness
[38:49] that that has been received and you have
[38:53] been accepted in the beloved the gospel
[38:57] of Jesus Christ it is to sound with a
[39:00] certainty that makes us ready for the
[39:03] coming of the Lord now Paul goes on in
[39:05] verse 9 and he says so likewise except
[39:09] ye utter by the tongue words easy to be
[39:13] understood how shall it be known what is
[39:17] spoken for ye shall speak it into the
[39:20] air there may there are in may be so
[39:26] many kinds of voices in the world and
[39:28] none of them is without signification
[39:34] therefore if I know not the meaning of
[39:38] the voice now watch this I shall be unto
[39:40] him that speaketh a barbarian and he
[39:46] that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto
[39:48] me now you know what benefit would it
[39:53] do me tonight if I could speak in
[39:57] Tagalog which is the Philippine tongue
[39:59] and I came here and I preached the
[40:03] message that my within it would have
[40:05] such liberating power what good would it
[40:09] do because none of you can understand
[40:12] Tagawa
[40:14] what good would it do if I could speak
[40:17] Dutch there's only one of you that can
[40:19] understand that what good would it do if
[40:23] I could come here and speak Spanish not
[40:26] Porto Rican Spanish I had to say that
[40:29] get some but you understand what good
[40:31] were to do right here there's a lot more
[40:33] that would understand Spanish right but
[40:37] not all of us I mean there's bits and
[40:39] pieces I would be I would be playing
[40:41] catch-up all night I mean once we get
[40:46] past you know you know hermano and
[40:49] hermana and then we do you pass all this
[40:51] you know it's pity the Sun towards we
[40:53] give that's all of that right there
[40:54] you're you're a playing catch-up believe
[40:59] it or not some of those same words are
[41:00] in Tagalog exact same words but I want
[41:04] you to listen what this is the point see
[41:07] God's desire is that understanding would
[41:11] be among us that what is being spoken it
[41:15] would be understood so in other words it
[41:19] doesn't no good for us or any if for an
[41:23] especially Amit just say like this for a
[41:25] ministry if there are things that even
[41:28] though that I can you know be studying
[41:30] many times there's things that you know
[41:33] that I'm a just you get on a run and
[41:34] you're just studying it and I don't even
[41:36] preach it there's things that I've you
[41:38] know God on a run studying the Holy
[41:40] Ghost just open it up but yet I haven't
[41:43] brought it and ministered and many times
[41:45] God will open a thought and I I look at
[41:48] it Lord how does the thought how do we
[41:51] bring it down to everyday life because a
[41:55] burden with in my heart is you I can
[41:58] preach it up here but if I just pray
[42:00] should up here and it never comes down
[42:02] to where you can put it in your lunchbox
[42:05] what good does it do you don't do any
[42:12] good you all kind of service Wow one
[42:15] that awesome what there's no doubt I
[42:26] failed in that sometimes I pray God
[42:30] helped me to be more sensitive that's
[42:32] that's my objective within that is that
[42:34] either things be understood and be
[42:37] applicable to our lives
[42:38] this word edify wants you to watch what
[42:41] this word means the word edify here it
[42:43] is the act of building up it is the act
[42:46] of one who promotes another's growth in
[42:50] Christian wisdom piety which is
[42:53] reverence happiness and holiness how
[42:56] many times when you hear brother Adam
[42:58] say we are here for one purpose and that
[43:01] is to glorify Jesus Christ we would he
[43:06] said our desire is to leave here that
[43:09] when we leave that you would leave out a
[43:12] better Christian than when you came in
[43:14] that you have a greater desire to serve
[43:18] God and agree and you have a greater are
[43:21] repulsiveness to sin that's the
[43:24] objective
[43:25] that's godly edification because when we
[43:28] when we look at it to think of it that
[43:31] even in the operation of the gifts that
[43:33] would God would have within the body and
[43:36] that includes you know even when we look
[43:38] at ministry or gifts and singing gifts
[43:41] and all those things that God has placed
[43:43] within the body
[43:44] think about this friends if we do not
[43:47] come and assemble ourselves together how
[43:51] can God fulfill this part of the world
[43:55] God has not called us to be cyber
[43:58] Christians
[44:02] if that's something if y'all just say
[44:05] like this cuz I know I'm talking to
[44:06] people streaming if you're satisfied
[44:08] streaming the service and it don't
[44:10] bother you that you're not in the house
[44:12] of God then something's wrong with your
[44:15] Christianity we'll pastors back in town
[44:22] there's something wrong if there's not a
[44:26] desire to be in the house of God gonna
[44:30] tell you something it ain't just here
[44:31] it's the same thing they're battling
[44:34] with in the Philippines as well same
[44:38] thing that they battle with is you know
[44:40] people just want to stay home and strain
[44:44] it ain't you something you know there's
[44:46] testimonies we can go throughout this
[44:48] whole you know time right here within
[44:51] this assembly but there are people
[44:54] sitting here that make a sacrifice to be
[44:57] here and they don't live next door they
[45:00] drive and they come here there's people
[45:02] that's made sacrifices and the reason
[45:05] they want an a day shift job is so they
[45:07] could be in the house of God what about
[45:11] their sister Caroline we paid for over a
[45:14] year and her whole objective was I want
[45:17] to be in the house of God I want to be
[45:20] there when things are going on I want to
[45:23] be in mid-weight service I don't mean to
[45:28] call you out sister Caroline but I think
[45:30] it bass think it behooves mentioning
[45:32] those things that God will always honor
[45:35] that design I'll say it's a good desire
[45:40] to be in the house of God amen you don't
[45:44] know what's gonna happen when we come
[45:46] together so let's let's examine godly
[45:52] edification just a moment because you
[45:54] see this world and it has been all the
[45:59] way through the world wants to purport
[46:01] what is true edification
[46:04] but the mega grace churches are not
[46:07] godly edification
[46:11] it is heaping up damnation because godly
[46:15] edification it promotes growth Christian
[46:19] grow in wisdom in reference in happiness
[46:23] in holiness it does not promote loose
[46:26] living godly edification sometimes it's
[46:32] got to get right down on your cross
[46:33] right down to your address and let you
[46:37] and I know this is where you're living
[46:39] this is where you need to be living what
[46:42] is it all about
[46:43] it's godly edification now Paul would
[46:49] say in 2nd Corinthians 10 7 now remember
[46:52] Paul you know he is dealing with how
[46:54] that the Word of God and I don't have
[46:56] time to go in the background but Paul's
[46:58] dealing with how that some you know I've
[47:00] looking at Paul's appearance when he
[47:01] comes among them and you know Paul don't
[47:03] look very you know very powerful and
[47:06] Paul stature and he looks real weak Paul
[47:08] lets him know it ain't the stature of a
[47:11] man that's powerful it's the way God
[47:14] that is powerful is that the size of the
[47:20] dog in the fight if the size of the fat
[47:23] in the dog do you look on things after
[47:28] the outward appearance if any man trust
[47:29] to himself that he is Christ's let him
[47:32] of himself think this again that as he
[47:34] is Christ even so are we
[47:36] Christ for though I should both somewhat
[47:39] more of our Authority which the LORD
[47:43] hath given us for edification Authority
[47:48] is given for edification whether it's
[47:51] husband whether it's father whether it's
[47:53] pastor it was digging no matter wave
[47:54] covers everything authority is given for
[47:58] edification and sometimes that
[48:02] edification you got to face facts
[48:05] is that right authority is not things
[48:09] that are just handed loosely but we
[48:11] recognize that this edification had
[48:14] pulse it it's not for your destruction
[48:17] now once again let me just get once
[48:20] again Paul in second Corinthians 12
[48:22] remember Paul is word
[48:23] referring here in second Corinthians
[48:25] twelve nineteen remember there are many
[48:27] who have now went forth and asserting
[48:30] themselves as apostles Paul would call
[48:33] them deceitful workers but and these
[48:36] were individuals who evidently were
[48:39] trying to purport themselves and you
[48:41] know they had a way that its undoubted
[48:44] they were laying everything out of how
[48:46] they were this and how they were that
[48:47] and how they were this and so Paul
[48:49] remember in this verse of scriptures
[48:51] here this chapter he asked them forgive
[48:54] me he says for glory but he lets them
[48:57] know that the tests and the trials that
[49:00] have come me that these tests and trials
[49:03] he said ain't none of them had to go
[49:06] through these things
[49:08] Paul is asserting his apostolic
[49:11] Authority and he lets him know there's
[49:14] not one of these men out here
[49:16] that's met God in this way I don't have
[49:20] time to read the whole chapter but you
[49:21] understand he said bear with me in my
[49:24] glory he lets him know I've been
[49:26] shipwrecked I've been left for dead call
[49:30] answer no that was never anything that I
[49:33] even put before you I have suffered but
[49:37] he said clearly in the book of
[49:39] Colossians I have suffered for the body
[49:41] safe because the rem-pod realized that
[49:44] the revelation that was committed to him
[49:47] there would be suffering that would come
[49:50] his way that would mold his character
[49:52] that the word being delivered would come
[49:54] with power and authority
[49:57] it was circumcised he would cut away
[49:59] unbelief and doubt and everything from
[50:02] the body so Paul would come on and say
[50:05] again safety that we excuse ourselves
[50:07] unto you we speak before God in Christ
[50:11] we do all things
[50:13] dearly beloved for your edifying this
[50:21] was a real God called man
[50:25] for your edifying not for self for
[50:30] edifying because Paul had to say some
[50:33] mighty hard things to the Corinthians he
[50:37] here this whole time
[50:38] his phone is laying it down how they're
[50:41] using gifts and how things are going on
[50:43] you're letting sin in the church you're
[50:45] letting this - you're bringing
[50:46] correction but remember godly
[50:49] edification correction leaves in it it's
[50:54] not just godly edification is not
[50:57] patting somebody on the back all the
[50:58] time and saying you're a son of God
[51:00] you're a daughter of God you're a son of
[51:02] God you're a daughter of God but godly
[51:04] edification says hey as the son of God
[51:07] we don't act that way as a daughter of
[51:10] God we don't act that way we don't dress
[51:12] that way we don't treat one another that
[51:15] way that's what godly edification does
[51:20] that's what Paul could say in 2nd
[51:23] Corinthians 13:10 therefore I write
[51:25] these things being absent less being
[51:27] present I should use sharpness according
[51:30] to the power which the Lord have given
[51:33] me to edification and not to destruction
[51:38] my momma but how the world would have us
[51:42] believe
[51:43] well when the word comes - correct
[51:45] that's destruction knowing it you can't
[51:49] run away the believer no sir the Word of
[51:55] God will not run away a believer if the
[52:02] Word of God runs somebody away they need
[52:05] to be run away but sending you out a
[52:08] preacher so everybody feels at home I
[52:10] only want the sons and daughters to feel
[52:13] at home people who want to come here
[52:17] fill up a Pew and live like the world
[52:19] live like the devil I don't want them to
[52:22] kill at home you see edification it
[52:34] brings if edification what is called
[52:37] edification if it don't bring correction
[52:40] in love then it ain't edification it's
[52:43] actually tearing down because you must
[52:47] hold the blessings and the cursings
[52:49] you come back to Deuteronomy on the two
[52:51] mountains right there brother Brandon
[52:53] tells us like this you know brother Bama
[52:55] in one of the messages brother Graham
[52:57] said a man that's always all he is just
[52:59] preaching blessings he said I don't have
[53:01] confidence in that he said because the
[53:03] weapon also contains cursings there's
[53:07] blessings and cursings but you see in
[53:10] today's modern educated society they
[53:14] only want the blessings of God but
[53:18] there's only one way you get the
[53:19] blessings of God brethren ain't a word
[53:22] that kept us your ears it's when your
[53:24] soul it's fully baptized with the Holy
[53:27] Ghost and your bra under the blood of
[53:29] Jesus Christ and that old same nature
[53:32] has been destroyed that's godly
[53:38] edification we're not trying to edify
[53:40] the stretch we're trying to edify sons
[53:44] and daughters of God
[53:46] and sometimes the word has got a comment
[53:49] it's cutting it's cutting away what's it
[53:51] do
[53:52] it's cutting away everything that's not
[53:54] you that's why Paul would go on he would
[54:01] say we are laborers together ye are
[54:05] God's husbandry you are God's building
[54:07] he would go on to say that the grace of
[54:09] God that's given to me as a wise
[54:12] masterbuilder I have laid the foundation
[54:14] and another buildeth thereon let every
[54:17] man take heed how he buildeth thereon in
[54:20] second Corinthians 5:1 for we know that
[54:25] if our earthly House of this Tabernacle
[54:27] were dissolved we have a building of God
[54:31] and house not made with hands eternal in
[54:36] the heavens
[54:37] now remember what Paul is speaking of
[54:40] here is that same body that Peter wrote
[54:43] of in 2nd Peter we have a body reserved
[54:46] in the heavens he is riding a bat see
[54:49] often he by that word body what is that
[54:52] that is the representation of the son
[54:55] and daughter of God before the throne of
[54:57] God just as we have voted right here I
[55:01] think maybe it was this past week that
[55:03] there was a voting going on there were
[55:06] different ones that were voted for there
[55:08] are people that they might have an
[55:10] office here locally but they actually
[55:12] are positioned down there whether it's
[55:15] in Washington DC or the state and and
[55:17] here they are they are our
[55:19] representatives from this area and the
[55:22] theophany that which is before the
[55:25] throne of God it is our representation
[55:28] and the Holy Ghost the baptism of the
[55:31] Holy Ghost it ties us back into that
[55:34] word body to wear a representation is
[55:38] before the throne of God and it reflects
[55:42] on earth when we live
[55:49] there's no right so you know what's this
[55:53] this building it is that calling us to
[55:58] perfection remember when this when this
[56:03] message this revelation when it has
[56:06] become eagle food to us not just
[56:13] something good it's become eagle food
[56:17] then you have heard from your see often
[56:21] well now what did that do the same call
[56:23] of God that moons up on your life moved
[56:26] up on my life that godly edification did
[56:30] not tell us you're all right all you got
[56:32] to do is love Jesus know the call of
[56:35] that word listen to me now the hearing
[56:37] from that representation it comes
[56:40] through the word of which we are dinner
[56:43] fide with it calls us through the
[56:45] cleansing out the blood it brings us
[56:48] into the sanctified himself and we are
[56:52] positioned in Jesus Christ
[56:54] Zacks godly edification this is what
[57:01] Paul would say in Ephesians 2 you are no
[57:04] more strangers foreigners but your
[57:07] fellow citizens with the Saints and of
[57:09] the household of God you are built upon
[57:11] the foundation of apostles prophets
[57:13] Jesus Christ Himself being the chief
[57:16] Cornerstone in whom all the building
[57:18] fitly framed together groweth unto a
[57:22] holy temple in the Lord in whom ye are
[57:26] also building together for in habitation
[57:29] of God through the spirit and remember
[57:34] what the scriptures that I've just read
[57:36] here this is looking at drawed ly
[57:40] edification the whole purpose of all the
[57:43] scriptures we just went through is to
[57:46] see godly edification of how that God
[57:50] comes down to edify our
[57:53] edification is not Pat's on the back
[57:58] edification is where God comes to break
[58:02] amnesia from our life it's where the
[58:05] Holy Spirit comes to bring correction in
[58:08] our life he comes to bring understanding
[58:11] he comes to bring help and strength and
[58:14] ministry to encouragement that's all
[58:17] part of edification so it ain't all
[58:20] correction in ain't all correction
[58:25] there's got to be some building up after
[58:27] correction that God just don't leave you
[58:30] we're here you are you walk around are
[58:33] you a believer yeah and I've got a bunch
[58:34] of stones laying around my life no sir
[58:36] God comes and if there's anything that
[58:39] he has to tell you this isn't setting
[58:42] right he doesn't destroy the whole
[58:45] building he works in the area that it
[58:50] might come into harmony with the
[58:52] blueprint in that growth in him let's
[58:56] look at it here in the scripture in
[58:57] Ephesians 4 the Bible says that he gave
[59:00] some apostles some prophets some
[59:03] evangelists some pastors and teachers no
[59:06] tape recorders verse 12 for the
[59:09] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[59:12] the ministry for the edifying of the
[59:16] body of Christ
[59:18] you see these gifts notice these are his
[59:21] gifts and and he's the one that uses
[59:25] them and when he uses them his purpose
[59:30] is for his goal it's for the glory of
[59:33] his people it's for the glory of his
[59:35] church it's for the edifying of the body
[59:37] of Christ for the glory of the kingdom
[59:40] of God brother Bramblett said in one
[59:43] place he said perhaps he said there's
[59:45] somebody sitting here tonight and you
[59:47] just need a little lift God has provided
[59:53] those gifts in the body to bring a lift
[59:57] to you and I we might need a little
[59:59] encouragement
[1:00:01] you know joke of faith but God has
[1:00:04] placed it there and that he would give a
[1:00:07] little lift to us and that lift is godly
[1:00:11] edification Paul goes on to say in verse
[1:00:14] 13 till we all come in the unity of the
[1:00:17] faith and of the knowledge of the Son of
[1:00:19] God unto a perfect man now Paul's not
[1:00:22] talking to when he says perfect man here
[1:00:24] he's not talking about the soul he's
[1:00:26] talking about a completely mature
[1:00:29] thoroughly furnished person what kind of
[1:00:35] house would it be if you don't have no
[1:00:36] furniture in it God puts furniture he
[1:00:40] decorates your walls and to the measure
[1:00:47] of the stature of the fullness of Christ
[1:00:49] that we be that we henceforth be no more
[1:00:51] children tossed to and fro carried about
[1:00:54] with every wind of doctrine by the
[1:00:56] sleight of men and cunning craftiness
[1:00:57] whereby they lie in wait to deceive this
[1:01:01] is not plotting them it just said very
[1:01:02] clearly this this right here is not
[1:01:05] possible for an individual to do this
[1:01:08] themselves well I take the message and
[1:01:11] do this as you break all scriptural
[1:01:13] patterns it's God who does it let me
[1:01:23] just but speaking the truth in love may
[1:01:28] grow up into him in all things which is
[1:01:31] the head even Christ Oh glory be to God
[1:01:38] we may grow up into him in all things Oh
[1:01:42] blessed be his name verse 16 from whom
[1:01:45] the whole body fitly joined together I
[1:01:48] want you to listen at this verse and are
[1:01:50] compacted by that which every joint
[1:01:54] supplies we're not on an island by
[1:01:59] ourselves God has so fit to wear the
[1:02:06] body it's necessary that the body work
[1:02:09] in harmony
[1:02:13] the loans cannot say a mouth I don't
[1:02:17] need you see this theme works throughout
[1:02:22] we need every member of the body of
[1:02:26] Jesus Christ we don't need a mouth to be
[1:02:30] a heart we don't need the mouth to tell
[1:02:33] the heart what to do nor the heart to
[1:02:35] tell the mouth what to do or the love we
[1:02:37] just need everything in its position to
[1:02:42] operate according to the program of God
[1:02:47] according to the effectual working in
[1:02:50] the measure of every part maketh watch
[1:02:52] this ver what's this part here now make
[1:02:54] it increase of the body unto the
[1:02:58] edifying of itself in love now
[1:03:01] everything it is to be done well Paul we
[1:03:05] were reading here in the first part that
[1:03:06] what is done in the church is to be unto
[1:03:09] the edifying of the church that's why
[1:03:13] Paul said if one speaks in tongues let
[1:03:16] them also probably interpret why so that
[1:03:20] the church is edified so now when we
[1:03:24] look at this verse of scripture that the
[1:03:27] whole work of the ministry and Paul is
[1:03:29] especially looking here at the five
[1:03:32] ministerial offices that God has put
[1:03:35] into the church and it is now notice
[1:03:39] that in there maketh increase of the
[1:03:41] body unto the edifying of itself in love
[1:03:44] so the receiving of godly edification is
[1:03:49] not the flesh but it is the son or
[1:03:53] daughter of God on the inside sometimes
[1:03:57] our flesh can get in the way
[1:03:59] our flesh is men and I don't know that
[1:04:02] seemed awful hard I don't think those
[1:04:06] senators looking at this sinner that way
[1:04:07] if he could only see it through my lens
[1:04:18] you see godly edification I flesh as who
[1:04:26] but if will give the inner man the right
[1:04:29] away the inner man will take that word
[1:04:33] that separates the living word brings a
[1:04:37] separation and that inner man will take
[1:04:40] the word and he will actually grow and
[1:04:44] his growth is also a subduing of that
[1:04:49] fleshly man he's growing in Christian
[1:04:54] wisdom I'm not going to ask you because
[1:04:58] nobody would raise your hands nobody
[1:05:01] wants to make the same mistake again
[1:05:03] nobody likes when we failed you don't
[1:05:07] say oh my I wish I could fail again no
[1:05:09] you don't matter of fact that there's a
[1:05:13] whole process and a little and here you
[1:05:15] are coming to a time you know to accept
[1:05:17] you know forgiveness and all that but
[1:05:19] you see all of this here is where the
[1:05:22] son and daughter of God on the inside is
[1:05:24] the one who's being edified by the
[1:05:27] Living God and receiving the notice to
[1:05:29] receive it maketh increase as the Bible
[1:05:32] says unto the edifying of itself in love
[1:05:35] it in this verse of scripture if you can
[1:05:38] see it it's like what was ministered to
[1:05:40] Esther she took and become one with it
[1:05:45] this is where we take what the Spirit of
[1:05:49] God is ministering to our life
[1:05:51] correction encouragement lift all of
[1:05:55] that and we apply it to our life we
[1:05:58] receive it and then it is an edifying of
[1:06:01] ourselves in death and it's made
[1:06:07] manifest in a lot you see here the body
[1:06:10] of Jesus Christ where we just read it in
[1:06:12] Ephesians 2 here is manifest in the
[1:06:15] bride body the Messiah The Anointed One
[1:06:19] when we have been quickened by the
[1:06:22] Spirit of God we are
[1:06:24] science we are not the Messiah in
[1:06:27] ourselves but we are part of that
[1:06:30] mystical body of Jesus Christ for by one
[1:06:34] spirit we are baptized into one body we
[1:06:38] have all been made to drink by one
[1:06:39] spirit so then it is the Anointed One
[1:06:43] the Messiah and he anoints brother Ram
[1:06:46] would say like this he anoints all of us
[1:06:48] and if he would anoint one with a sign
[1:06:51] and the other doesn't believe it what
[1:06:55] good would it do
[1:06:56] it's got to be all of us together though
[1:07:01] many have looked at and still yet go on
[1:07:04] and look at the ministry that God has
[1:07:08] sent in this hour
[1:07:09] and God has vindicated it with this
[1:07:12] presence with the very sign of a messiah
[1:07:15] but yet many will look at it and they
[1:07:18] don't be Ethan but - you and I it's
[1:07:20] different we're not looking at a man we
[1:07:25] recognize that God has fulfilled the
[1:07:29] scriptural promise of this hour as he
[1:07:32] said he would make a bride ready for
[1:07:35] action so you see if there was nobody to
[1:07:40] believe it what good would it do
[1:07:42] descendants it's the same way service
[1:07:48] after service God might be speaking
[1:07:51] there might be fat people that did it
[1:07:53] brother that's what it's all about I
[1:07:57] want everybody to get it but God knows
[1:08:00] who's going to get it
[1:08:02] that's why brother Ram says we preach it
[1:08:04] as though everybody can get it this is
[1:08:08] why brother animal takers in spiritual
[1:08:10] food a new season and he would tell us
[1:08:12] he said if now he said someone came here
[1:08:15] with scarves in their hands and they
[1:08:17] were he said they maybe looked exactly
[1:08:20] like the Hoffmans head of Christ he said
[1:08:22] and blood were running out of their
[1:08:24] hands scars all over I wouldn't accept
[1:08:27] it
[1:08:30] see it must be identified by the word
[1:08:32] but notice he says but he embodies
[1:08:36] himself he embodies himself taking your
[1:08:42] body and my body and gives you this
[1:08:45] gives meekness and through these gifts
[1:08:48] he makes himself known that's the secret
[1:08:54] food all throughout this building right
[1:08:58] here if I call your number brother
[1:09:01] Richard
[1:09:01] that's a call directly to you from me
[1:09:04] that signal is going throughout this
[1:09:07] building but nobody else is gonna get an
[1:09:10] alert why because it's a personal call
[1:09:15] that sent out a signal that comes from a
[1:09:19] tower and where that that well that
[1:09:24] phone or that chip that you've got in
[1:09:26] your phone it is baptized into that
[1:09:29] Network it can actually receive messages
[1:09:33] well it is invisible but it's Pat see
[1:09:36] right through this building and that's
[1:09:40] the same way that God does he embodies
[1:09:44] himself using gifts that is placed in
[1:09:47] men lives and using the gift of faith in
[1:09:51] your life and there's a feeding that
[1:09:53] goes on and ever and there's others
[1:09:56] again set by and say well you know
[1:09:57] brother man I'm out of the word to this
[1:09:59] here you know he didn't say this exactly
[1:10:01] right over here you know that they're
[1:10:03] not feeding they're not feeding no
[1:10:08] they're not but you and I we are feeding
[1:10:13] so I believe and said no matter how much
[1:10:15] he would make himself known by me you've
[1:10:20] got to believe it you've got to have a
[1:10:24] gift of faith to believe it
[1:10:25] see those non spiritual gifts are in our
[1:10:29] to be operating in every local body they
[1:10:34] key they are there remember to keep the
[1:10:37] church clean the ministering of the
[1:10:41] gifts of the five minister gifts is to
[1:10:44] bring the church together separating it
[1:10:47] out a gospel the word the light brings
[1:10:53] separation and all of this it comes
[1:10:56] together to bring the church together to
[1:10:59] make us one if we're really really being
[1:11:03] edified and receiving edification it
[1:11:07] does not bring schisms it does not bring
[1:11:12] division that's why just listening to
[1:11:16] the word is not enough listen friends
[1:11:21] you and I both know Mom watch she worked
[1:11:22] in a nursing home and when she was
[1:11:24] expecting Paul right here she got sent
[1:11:27] home on bed rest there was a woman that
[1:11:31] was there in that nursing home she read
[1:11:34] her Bible faithfully every day and could
[1:11:38] quote that Bible but she was meaner in a
[1:11:42] rattlesnake that's my words him you know
[1:11:47] my wife sweet enough she wouldn't say
[1:11:49] that but that's madness the very one
[1:11:53] that pushed her down on the floor when
[1:11:55] she was pregnant now then that's not the
[1:11:59] only one there's people that don't just
[1:12:02] know the Bible there's people that know
[1:12:04] this message that's meaner than a
[1:12:05] rattlesnake there's no submissive and
[1:12:09] subjection in their heart at all they've
[1:12:12] got it all put together
[1:12:13] they're know-it-alls
[1:12:16] that ain't a sheet brother that's a goat
[1:12:21] whoo sheets here his vas but the guts
[1:12:32] ain't you missed this here she went
[1:12:35] stuff to friends we were at you see the
[1:12:39] real feeling of the where it makes us
[1:12:41] one it makes us one in him a brotherhood
[1:12:46] of one soul one heart one body one
[1:12:50] spirit then when we have received that
[1:12:55] godly edification there is an operating
[1:12:57] in position as believers in Christ in
[1:13:01] heavenly places when a man and a woman
[1:13:05] know who they are and what God has
[1:13:09] called them to do they can relax and God
[1:13:17] uses them for his glory for the glory of
[1:13:23] the body if it's a preacher the preacher
[1:13:27] may only preach once a year
[1:13:29] depends on what God has set forth he may
[1:13:34] only preach twice a year then again he
[1:13:37] might preach twenty five times out of it
[1:13:38] it's according to how God uses the gift
[1:13:44] same way within singing it's the same
[1:13:48] way it's not more than ever know if God
[1:13:52] has differences the Bible tells us this
[1:13:55] so everything is to be
[1:13:57] industry-recognized always be available
[1:14:10] it'd be like you know if we tapped one
[1:14:13] of the song leaders and they're coming
[1:14:15] into church that hey by the way you're
[1:14:17] gonna have to lead songs in it oh no I
[1:14:19] can't why not well I'm really not prayed
[1:14:21] up
[1:14:23] we see I really haven't done this and I
[1:14:25] really haven't done that now you'll
[1:14:27] always be available
[1:14:31] that's where every one of us
[1:14:33] I said that's for every one of us you
[1:14:38] see this is where that Paul oh my I'm
[1:14:41] just gonna skip some things here Paul
[1:14:47] would go on that and skip down to first
[1:14:49] Corinthians 14 12 I want to just close
[1:14:55] some of this on I'll just skip over some
[1:14:57] of the rest of it Paul said even so for
[1:15:01] as much as you are zealous of spiritual
[1:15:03] gifts seek that you may Excel to the
[1:15:07] edifying of the church let him that
[1:15:11] speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that
[1:15:13] he may interpret if I pray in an unknown
[1:15:17] tongue my spirit prayer but my
[1:15:19] understanding is unfruitful
[1:15:22] I know throughout this building there's
[1:15:25] no doubt you know different ones of us
[1:15:28] pray and you know you'll go right in and
[1:15:30] you begin you move right into an unknown
[1:15:32] tongue our understanding when that
[1:15:34] happens our understanding is unfruitful
[1:15:37] but there is a consolation that goes
[1:15:41] into the heart of a person they know
[1:15:42] they're in contact with God and you with
[1:15:45] me this is what Paul is some are
[1:15:47] understanding within it is unfruitful
[1:15:49] but there is a consolation see it is an
[1:15:52] edifying yourself and that is perfectly
[1:15:54] permissible in your prayer closet are
[1:16:00] you with me in your prayer closet or
[1:16:02] when you're driving down the roadway
[1:16:04] that's absolutely permissible so
[1:16:07] understanding let me just try to close
[1:16:09] this out verse 15 so it's under so it's
[1:16:12] edification that all should glorify the
[1:16:15] work of Jesus Christ
[1:16:16] Paul said I will pray with the spirit
[1:16:18] verse 15 I will pray with the
[1:16:20] understanding also
[1:16:22] I will sing with the spirit I will sing
[1:16:24] with the understanding also else well
[1:16:28] let me just say like this you all know
[1:16:30] and many of you know what I'm talking
[1:16:31] about there are certain songs right now
[1:16:33] that some songs that perhaps that we
[1:16:34] would sing and some that sing online you
[1:16:37] sing that song in a denominational
[1:16:38] Church nobody is going to understand
[1:16:40] what you're saying we're on a journey
[1:16:43] that started in the mind of God and will
[1:16:47] end in a glorified body denominations
[1:16:50] won't stand down so what do you need to
[1:16:52] focus on
[1:16:53] I shall mine eyes to Calvary are you
[1:17:02] with me because we're interested in that
[1:17:05] heart being edified is that right poorni
[1:17:12] and maybe you know you're you're just
[1:17:13] witnessing to people you all understand
[1:17:15] what I'm saying
[1:17:16] verse 16 else when thou shalt bless with
[1:17:20] the spirit how shall he that occupies
[1:17:24] the room of the unlearned say amen at
[1:17:26] the giving of things Paul Paul you seem
[1:17:30] like you're so worried about the
[1:17:33] unlearned Paul said I'm worried about
[1:17:35] everybody that comes through those doors
[1:17:39] Paul said I want so everybody will be
[1:17:43] able to understand seeing he
[1:17:48] understandeth not what they say for thou
[1:17:50] very give us thinks well but the other
[1:17:53] is not edified I think my god I speak
[1:17:56] with tongues more than you all how many
[1:17:58] know Paul knew many different languages
[1:18:02] you know how it is somebody speaks in
[1:18:04] her language they're talking about you
[1:18:08] got some you lighten up just go and talk
[1:18:15] about me in English the same it sound
[1:18:25] like a conflict say lord help me yet in
[1:18:30] the church I had rather speak five words
[1:18:34] with my understanding that by my voice I
[1:18:38] might teach others also than ten
[1:18:40] thousand words in an unknown tongue
[1:18:41] brethren be not children in
[1:18:44] understanding but in malice be children
[1:18:47] but an understanding be men if therefore
[1:18:50] here become verse 23 if therefore the
[1:18:52] whole church be come together into one
[1:18:55] place and all speak with tongues and
[1:18:57] there come in those that are unlearned
[1:18:59] or unbelievers will they not say that
[1:19:04] you're mad am believers I ain't worried
[1:19:09] about that's not the attitude
[1:19:11] Paul had you gotta say well I was always
[1:19:18] a believer down beneath all the darkness
[1:19:21] I agree
[1:19:24] hello now but there's gotta come
[1:19:27] something that'll break those clouds
[1:19:29] back but if all prophesy and there come
[1:19:33] in one that believeth not or one
[1:19:36] unlearned he is convinced of all he is
[1:19:40] judged of all and thus are the secrets
[1:19:42] of his heart made manifest so falling
[1:19:45] down on his face he will worship God and
[1:19:48] report that God is in you of the truth
[1:19:52] so I think we're very clear godly
[1:19:59] edification isn't just having gifts and
[1:20:02] our midst but that they're operating
[1:20:04] according to the Word of God
[1:20:06] it promotes growth in the body remember
[1:20:10] this this godly edification this think
[1:20:13] about this tongues being given
[1:20:15] interpretation coming can actually
[1:20:18] reveal to a person your healing is
[1:20:22] prolonged because you need to take care
[1:20:25] of this in your life put the sandal
[1:20:29] that's tearing down no it's not
[1:20:31] it's edifying it's edifying it's helping
[1:20:36] the person free themselves of what it is
[1:20:40] that's holding a bat from the blessing
[1:20:43] of God that belongs to her godly
[1:20:46] edification comes to a define it comes
[1:20:51] to correct it comes to bring people to
[1:20:54] know God this is why Paul would say I'll
[1:20:58] close with this verse 26 how is it then
[1:21:01] brethren when you come together every
[1:21:04] one of you half a song half a doctrine
[1:21:07] half the time half a regulation half an
[1:21:11] interpretation let all things be done
[1:21:14] unto edifying Paul even goes into the
[1:21:18] next verse let everything be done in two
[1:21:21] or three
[1:21:26] what if somebody else will this is the
[1:21:28] fourth set of speaking in tongues
[1:21:30] hold it that's the Word of God so if
[1:21:38] that would apply then - speaking in
[1:21:42] tongues and interpreting how about a
[1:21:45] service with specials I'm not trying to
[1:21:49] put no doctrine I'm trying to say what
[1:21:51] is the purpose of when we come together
[1:21:54] it's to edify the body of believers
[1:21:59] you've probably been into it I've been
[1:22:01] in services where specials were
[1:22:04] wonderful but the people were wore out I
[1:22:08] was in a meeting one time the song
[1:22:10] service went well I've been in multiple
[1:22:12] means where they went a long time and
[1:22:17] one brother came out one time you know I
[1:22:19] never forget we were there in the
[1:22:20] meetings and he just he said
[1:22:22] congregation I don't want you to see
[1:22:24] he said called this brother the plays
[1:22:26] the trumpet by the Bruce he said I want
[1:22:29] you to play only believe and I want
[1:22:30] nobody to sing I want you just to let
[1:22:34] your mind focus on those words people
[1:22:37] were depleted but when he began to pray
[1:22:43] they begin to play that in their people
[1:22:45] nobody saying he focused on only belief
[1:22:48] the Holy Spirit came right back down in
[1:22:50] the building you see that's why even
[1:22:54] with it's important to know when is
[1:22:56] enough enough in other words God don't
[1:23:01] want you to clean your plate God likes
[1:23:03] to take the plate when you've got fourth
[1:23:04] of the steak left to eat why'd you stop
[1:23:08] it like that
[1:23:09] so you relish his presence
[1:23:13] it's edification that being said how
[1:23:18] better a closing happen don't you love
[1:23:22] the Lord I want to be I want to be where
[1:23:28] he is at I want to be gathered with his
[1:23:30] body and in everything we want it to be
[1:23:33] to the edification of the body of
[1:23:37] believers sometimes there's things
[1:23:39] that's behaving to be said other times
[1:23:41] it's believing zip it and don't say
[1:23:44] anything
[1:23:45] is that right amen say lord help us we
[1:23:50] want to we want to edify and we want to
