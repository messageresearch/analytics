[32:52] how thankful we are for that
[32:55] amen
[32:56] God is so good isn't he
[32:59] man I tell you we just um we just had a
[33:02] wonderful time here this weekend didn't
[33:04] we
[33:05] just a wonderful time in the presence of
[33:07] the Lord and Maya I'm just so thankful
[33:10] amen for all that the Lord has done and
[33:12] amen just the testimonies coming in and
[33:16] from those that were here and I know
[33:18] that there are no doubt other
[33:20] testimonies that from right here every
[33:23] time when we come together amen there is
[33:26] always something special God is going to
[33:28] do amen amen and you know even in the
[33:30] times that sometimes that we don't feel
[33:32] like things are going on but yet you
[33:35] know what God is a God who works little
[33:39] by little
[33:40] just as much as he comes to cap off of
[33:43] work he cannot cap anything off that's
[33:46] not built up
[33:47] right right so God works little by
[33:50] little every stone everything you know I
[33:52] I really
[33:55] heard something when we were at um
[33:58] the men's meeting that it just
[34:01] it just so spoke to my heart when
[34:03] brother Tim Dodd and he was ministering
[34:06] you've heard it about the infinite God
[34:09] he took a he took a statement uh in
[34:12] dealing with how sometimes he said you
[34:13] know he says
[34:14] we think every service has got to be a
[34:17] boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom
[34:20] he said but
[34:21] consider he said The Rock
[34:24] that smoked Goliath
[34:26] I wonder what size that rock started out
[34:28] as
[34:30] but he said
[34:31] every little rainstorm that came along
[34:34] and every little bit of water
[34:36] it had to get that rock down to the
[34:39] right size
[34:41] so even when things weren't heard or
[34:42] when seen God was getting everything
[34:45] ready
[34:47] to Smite the lion
[34:50] so I think you know when he was
[34:52] ministering that I I thought of the
[34:54] scripture immediately you know
[34:55] says who hath despised the day
[34:58] of small things
[35:01] amen we we are just so thankful amen for
[35:05] the mercy of God and I I'm so thankful
[35:07] for God's grace and what he's done and
[35:09] what he's doing for us and my what a
[35:11] wonderful time that we've had in the
[35:14] presence of the Lord
[35:15] we just want to turn our attention to
[35:17] the word of the Lord here tonight so
[35:19] appreciate them
[35:21] song service we just know we need we
[35:24] need to hear from him
[35:26] amen so
[35:28] if we could if you'd like to stand with
[35:30] me and I'd like to go into the scripture
[35:34] here and start into Job chapter 13
[35:36] tonight
[35:38] and maybe as you turn there once you get
[35:41] that and I don't know if they'll if they
[35:43] have it or they do have it to be able to
[35:45] put up and
[35:46] just so appreciate thank you for being
[35:50] patient with us the brothers between
[35:52] services on Sunday
[35:54] the brothers are the brothers worked in
[35:56] order to because that other projector
[35:59] went out the bulb and it's really an
[36:02] issue with the projector we know now
[36:05] and they work to take that one down put
[36:07] that up there and then brother Brian
[36:08] holdren formatted it so it would at
[36:11] least be readable right here so I
[36:13] appreciate that brother so much I mean
[36:16] amen the different Brothers all that
[36:17] were getting up there and changing the
[36:19] not only that but the plate that it
[36:21] attaches to and all that you know we
[36:23] just come in and we enjoy it we just
[36:26] we're thankful the words are there in
[36:27] front of us but my goodness I tell you
[36:29] what I'm so glad for all of those just
[36:32] you know I didn't ask them to do that
[36:34] but they right away they met me at there
[36:36] and said hey we're going to do this
[36:37] between services so we just we say God
[36:40] bless you thank you brother amen all
[36:42] that were
[36:43] on the ladders and doing all that so
[36:46] let's just look to the Lord in a word of
[36:48] prayer and then we'll read here in the
[36:49] scriptures
[36:50] Heavenly Father Lord we are just so
[36:54] thankful Lord for this privilege and
[36:56] opportunity that we have to come once
[36:58] again into your presence Lord we're
[37:00] mindful of Our littleness Lord mindful
[37:03] that God that we need you Lord and
[37:06] father just one word from you Lord is
[37:09] more than Lord a multitude of words Lord
[37:12] for it comes from you so we ask that you
[37:15] would help us to be able to step out of
[37:18] the way that Lord those things that you
[37:20] pressed upon our hearts that you Lord
[37:23] that has given the inspiration may come
[37:25] and deliver it Lord in the manner that
[37:28] it's to be delivered and help us Lord to
[37:30] receive it that it would go Lord and
[37:33] minister to the needs that you know that
[37:36] are present in our lives we love you and
[37:38] we thank you Father we give ourselves to
[37:40] you now in this congregation in Jesus
[37:43] name Amen in Job chapter 13
[37:46] I want to just take care and read a few
[37:50] verses of scripture verse 1 beginning
[37:52] there
[37:53] it says lo mine I hath seen all this and
[37:57] mine ear hath heard and understood it so
[38:00] what job's talking about is everything
[38:02] his friends have been saying that's what
[38:05] he's responding to mine I hath seen all
[38:08] of this my ear hath heard it and
[38:10] understood it what ye know the same do I
[38:15] also I know also I am not inferior unto
[38:19] you
[38:19] surely I would speak to the almighty and
[38:23] I desire to reason with God but ye are
[38:26] forgers of Lies you're all Physicians of
[38:30] no value those are some pretty strong
[38:32] words
[38:34] right
[38:36] old that ye would all together hold your
[38:38] peace and it should be your wisdom
[38:41] hear now my reasoning and hearken to the
[38:45] pleadings of my lips now he's speaking
[38:47] to them still will ye speak wickedly for
[38:50] God and talk deceitfully for him
[38:54] will you accept his person in other
[38:56] words will you stand in his place will
[38:59] you contend for God is it good that he
[39:03] should search you out or is one man
[39:06] mocketh another do you so mock him
[39:09] he will surely reprove you if you do
[39:13] secretly accept persons
[39:15] shall not his Excellency make you afraid
[39:18] and his dread fall upon you your
[39:22] remembrances are like unto ashes and
[39:25] your bodies to bodies of clay
[39:28] amen may God bless you bless the reading
[39:30] of the word as you're being seated
[39:35] remember as we're
[39:38] drawing from the thought of
[39:40] passing through the valley of baka we're
[39:44] dealing with that a couple of weeks ago
[39:46] and we know that the Valley's not our
[39:49] destination the valley being the type of
[39:52] tests and trials that we go through
[39:54] within life and every test in every
[39:56] trial is predestinated from the hand of
[39:59] God you've heard it said over and over
[40:02] probably not only by me but others as
[40:05] ministers will be exhorted and reminded
[40:07] that it's one thing for sure we're
[40:09] either in a trial
[40:11] coming out of a trial or heading into
[40:13] one and it comes in many different forms
[40:16] that you know brother Brown would talk
[40:17] about the ash heaps and sometimes the
[40:21] trials that come sometimes there's
[40:22] things that comes to us that maybe we
[40:24] wouldn't regard as a trial or think of
[40:27] it in that way but yet God permits it do
[40:30] you know there's nothing that can come
[40:31] our way unless God first permits it even
[40:34] when David remember when David was
[40:36] mocked and he's going out of the city
[40:38] and remember one rose up from David
[40:41] after the one had spit on David and
[40:44] David said let him alone God told him to
[40:46] do that and how that you'll find that
[40:49] brother Panama picked that up even when
[40:51] he's speaking to brotherly Vale and
[40:53] different ones at the table and how that
[40:55] you know brother Brown writes how
[40:57] brother Vale just quickly said how can
[40:59] you stand to let people do that to you
[41:01] and brother Brown says well brother Lee
[41:04] so you're a little quick on the trigger
[41:05] there and he went back and he took it
[41:08] right back into scripture and you know
[41:10] what I'm grateful for that we we have
[41:12] access more to more than just scripture
[41:16] we have access to the author
[41:19] because if all we had was just access to
[41:23] the scripture the Bible from my
[41:25] understanding is still the number one
[41:26] sold book if that's out there
[41:29] but oh how that we need the author of
[41:32] the book that was the plead that was
[41:35] made even in this hour where brother
[41:37] Brandon remember he was approached and
[41:38] said brother Brandon we're not going to
[41:40] ever understand until we understand the
[41:41] language that it was in and this
[41:42] inaudible says well he says that
[41:45] argument has been going on for years
[41:46] about what language it was in he said
[41:49] but what we really need is the teaching
[41:52] of the Holy Spirit to make it clear and
[41:54] that's what we need in every in every
[41:57] moment of our life and how God continues
[41:59] to bring himself and make himself more
[42:02] real to you and I and I thinking of the
[42:05] of out of the
[42:06] uh Church ages where brother Brandon
[42:09] would speak of how the Sumerian age and
[42:11] if I can just lay this for a background
[42:12] before I give you my title brother Brian
[42:15] was talking about the Sumerian age I
[42:16] remember samurna means bitter
[42:19] and so it was it was a age of bitter
[42:21] trials no trial
[42:24] no trial itself is without bitterness
[42:27] but the difference is we're not talking
[42:29] about bitterness of the person we're
[42:31] talking about bitterness of the
[42:33] situation
[42:34] and so when we see it he says this this
[42:38] condition to Smyrna has to be applied to
[42:41] every age there's no age free from it
[42:44] there's no True Believer free from it
[42:47] this is of god it's the will of God it
[42:51] is needful we need the Lord to teach us
[42:55] the truth that we are to suffer and be
[42:58] christ-like in doing it and I say we not
[43:02] only need God to teach us as far as even
[43:05] in a service like this but we need God
[43:08] to teach us in the midst of the trial
[43:10] because that's where God even wants to
[43:13] instruct you and I in the midst of the
[43:15] valley is where he'll teach us and where
[43:18] there is things that is taking place in
[43:20] our life God wants to do for us in the
[43:23] Valley now our flesh wants to get out of
[43:26] the valley
[43:27] but there's things that God
[43:29] wants to achieve
[43:31] in the valley that the valley is
[43:34] necessary
[43:36] and if I can't go into all of those
[43:38] details tonight but those things that
[43:40] just and I know this is a subject that's
[43:42] very familiar to us what message and
[43:44] what time uh can you not listen to will
[43:47] you'll come in contact where uh the Holy
[43:50] Spirit would exhort us on tests and
[43:52] trials and things that are coming our
[43:54] way I've sat and I've heard it
[43:56] ministered on in conventions in meetings
[43:59] and other places sometimes how many
[44:01] times we've heard it here but you know
[44:03] God has a way of encouraging you and I
[44:05] and reminding us I'm glad that God just
[44:08] doesn't rest it upon our memory to
[44:11] remember things but God comes along
[44:13] because if that's all it was then God
[44:15] would just say read the Bible after
[44:17] you've already been saved filled with
[44:18] the spirit of God just read the Bible
[44:20] everything's taken care of but God
[44:22] through the foolishness of preaching not
[44:24] only chose to say but God chooses to
[44:28] teach us to remind us to strengthen you
[44:31] and I that and make us aware he cares
[44:34] and he's Mindful and I'm grateful for
[44:36] that I'm grateful for that so when we
[44:40] see this we need him to teach us that
[44:42] truth that we are to suffer and be
[44:44] christ-like in doing it love suffereth
[44:46] long and is kind brother Brown reads
[44:49] Matthew 5 11 12 and I'm just referring
[44:52] to a quote the brothers don't have this
[44:53] blessed are ye Jesus said when men shall
[44:57] revile you and persecute you and shall
[45:00] say all manner of evil against you
[45:02] falsely for my sake rejoice and be
[45:07] exceeding glad for great is your reward
[45:10] in heaven for so persecuted they the
[45:13] prophets which were before you I don't
[45:15] know about you but I that second part of
[45:17] verse 12 rejoice and be exceeding glad I
[45:20] need help recognizing that
[45:22] I just be honest I need help with that I
[45:25] I don't think when false accusations
[45:27] come that immediately I go into a praise
[45:29] break I don't almost we go instead of
[45:32] Praise Break we're going to meltdown
[45:33] right defense mode but that why is that
[45:36] that's because that's our outward man
[45:38] but remember the test and trial as Paul
[45:41] wrote is for our outward man to perish
[45:45] God knows how to reduce
[45:48] us that the real us can come forth
[45:53] and that's not up to me to determine
[45:56] that with you or you to me that it's on
[45:58] God's hands and I'm glad that God knows
[46:00] just as much as one can look in maybe in
[46:03] a certain area of the Earth in a in a
[46:05] topographic map and say there's a lot of
[46:07] gold here where there's a lot of coal
[46:09] here or there's a lot of minerals here
[46:11] I'm glad God knows what he already put
[46:14] within us and I'm glad that he's the one
[46:17] not man no one else that's bringing out
[46:20] what he already put within us
[46:23] and I'm grateful for that so I I'm
[46:26] thankful that even how the prophet would
[46:28] go on to say the cloudy skies and storms
[46:32] of life are no signs of God's
[46:35] disapproval neither are bright skies and
[46:40] Still Waters signs of his love and
[46:43] approval his approval of any of us is
[46:48] only in the Beloved
[46:51] and that never changes
[46:56] that never changes
[46:59] once we have been accepted in the
[47:02] Beloved and in reality that took place
[47:05] before the foundation of the world
[47:07] it's God working here right now and
[47:10] opening our heart moving Upon Us by his
[47:13] inspiration by his life that we will
[47:17] accept what he has already done
[47:20] and so no matter what even in all of
[47:23] failures mistakes thoughts
[47:26] misunderstandings the acceptance in the
[47:30] Beloved never changes
[47:34] even when we've done wrong that doesn't
[47:37] change
[47:38] God's not if I can say this and I hope
[47:40] that maybe it's not politically correct
[47:42] but you get the point God's not an
[47:44] Indian giver
[47:46] are you with me God's not somebody that
[47:48] you got to worry about I don't know if I
[47:50] should borrow this from them or ask
[47:52] about it because I don't know if they
[47:54] tell me they're giving this to me I
[47:56] don't know because they'll show up weeks
[47:58] later and say hey have you got this
[47:59] God's not like that God doesn't give the
[48:03] Holy Ghost and take it back as a matter
[48:05] of fact he lets us know when you're
[48:07] sealed you're sealed to the day of
[48:09] redemption
[48:12] you can grieve it but as far as your
[48:15] acceptance you've already been accepted
[48:17] and that acceptance of the holy spirit
[48:19] is what works in our life to continue to
[48:23] bring us into manifesting our acceptance
[48:25] even when he convicts us and we say I
[48:28] was wrong I need to go make that right
[48:30] Lord forgive me I thought what is that
[48:31] it's that acceptance working in our life
[48:35] by the Holy Spirit to do what declare we
[48:38] have been accepted in the Beloved
[48:41] so our status
[48:43] Before the Throne and in God never
[48:47] changes
[48:49] well I wish we could really preach on
[48:51] that tonight
[48:53] his love is elective brother Brown tells
[48:56] us that he had for us before the
[48:58] foundation of the world does he love us
[48:59] oh yes but how shall we know we shall
[49:04] know because he said so I believe right
[49:08] now I'm speaking to people and the bride
[49:11] upon the Earth worldwide is coming to
[49:14] this place right now
[49:17] that there's never been a group of
[49:19] people that could stand upon the Earth
[49:21] and take every word of God and say he
[49:24] said so I believe it
[49:26] but we're in the age of the
[49:28] manifestation of the bride in her
[49:31] fullness we're in the time where where
[49:34] where where the building of God is being
[49:37] is finished
[49:38] is that right and just as the bridegroom
[49:41] could stand there on every word of God
[49:43] so is the bride because it's his life
[49:46] pulsating through us that even though I
[49:49] can't understand it or explain it or
[49:52] feel it I believe it why because he said
[49:55] so
[49:57] that's Abraham's seed it's not because I
[50:01] feel it but because he said so that
[50:05] settles it
[50:08] and he manifested that he did love us
[50:10] for how did he manifest he'd love us
[50:13] because he brought us to himself and
[50:15] gave us of his Spirit placing us as sons
[50:18] and how shall I prove my love to him
[50:22] by believing what he said
[50:25] and by conducting myself with joy
[50:29] admits the trials that he and his wisdom
[50:33] allows to come to pass
[50:36] and I would just be very honest and say
[50:38] God help me
[50:41] help me
[50:42] let it just so drop help me to recognize
[50:45] these things that in the midst of it
[50:46] remember Joy
[50:48] This Joy is not like the joy of the
[50:51] world
[50:52] the joy of the world is depending on who
[50:54] won and who lost and this and that and
[50:56] everything it's all up and that's the
[50:59] joy of the world
[51:01] but the joy of the Lord is my strength
[51:04] what Joy are we talking about we're
[51:06] talking about this Joy that's in these
[51:09] temporary Dwelling Places
[51:11] in the Feast of Tabernacles these
[51:14] Earthly Tabernacles there is a joy Jesus
[51:19] said my joy I give to you
[51:22] and no man taketh that from you meaning
[51:24] no circumstance can take that in other
[51:27] words your acceptance your seal your
[51:30] token there's no circumstance no trial
[51:33] no test no matter no false accusation
[51:36] nothing can take that away from you
[51:41] so when everything else is breaking away
[51:44] around you there's a joy from within to
[51:48] say this Valley is not my home
[51:52] I'm just passing through
[52:00] I want to speak here just for a few
[52:01] moments and I know I gave a lot of that
[52:03] to just lay this in
[52:05] and I've just been really
[52:09] as we've been looking at you know
[52:10] appropriate responses and looking at all
[52:12] these things and I just I just been
[52:14] going through here going back through
[52:16] the Book of Job just little by little
[52:18] just chapter by chapter just moving
[52:20] through certain things and the Holy
[52:22] Spirit just began to impress this
[52:25] thought upon my heart the right
[52:26] application
[52:29] the right application
[52:31] how many knows it's important to have
[52:33] the right application
[52:37] now in Exodus 12 let me just give this
[52:39] example first in Exodus 12 21 Moses
[52:43] called for all the Elders of Israel and
[52:45] said unto them draw out and take you a
[52:48] lamb according to your families and kill
[52:51] the Passover
[52:52] and ye shall take a bunch of hyssa
[52:55] that's
[52:56] common Faith it's just it's taking faith
[52:59] brother Brian says not some super duper
[53:01] Supernatural faith is just common faith
[53:04] I believe it God sent it I'm just going
[53:06] to do it and you shall take a bunch of
[53:08] hyssop and
[53:16] and that is in the basin and none of you
[53:19] shall go out the door of his house unto
[53:21] the morning so when they were to take
[53:23] this this blood and they were to Sprite
[53:27] the disciples
[53:29] and that here of the lentil all those
[53:32] that goes around the door and you'll
[53:35] notice never were they to put the blood
[53:37] on the threshold because you're never to
[53:40] walk over the blood
[53:42] it's always to walk under the blood in
[53:46] everything we do we do it
[53:49] in the name of Jesus Christ
[53:52] we're to move under the blood of Jesus
[53:55] Christ and so he gives the the direction
[53:58] and no matter what what they thought
[54:01] they really didn't have any thought
[54:02] coming the only thing they had to do for
[54:05] deliverance was do what God had spoken
[54:10] in his message through his messenger and
[54:14] that was apply it to the side posts and
[54:16] the lentil and that's what you have to
[54:18] do because when I see the blood then I
[54:21] will pass over you in other words I'm
[54:24] not going to be looking at you I'm going
[54:26] to be looking at the blood
[54:28] and if it's applied correctly I'll never
[54:31] see you all I see is the blood
[54:34] and the blood represents death has
[54:37] already come to this household
[54:40] one on the inside deserves to die but
[54:44] there is one who has taken his place and
[54:48] the blood is applied
[54:51] and God said when I see the blood I will
[54:54] pass over you
[54:56] so the right application provided an
[55:00] escape provided a safety and God said
[55:03] none of you shall go out unto the
[55:04] morning you know why they were speaking
[55:06] of the effect that would come through
[55:10] the real Lamb of God where every desire
[55:14] to even want to go out again is gone the
[55:19] Devils could come and howl at the
[55:21] windows and peck on the door and try to
[55:24] bring all sorts of fear but a real Godly
[55:28] father would direct when the fear arose
[55:31] it would Point them back to the blood oh
[55:34] man I tell you when fear arises or a
[55:38] question arises we are pointing back to
[55:42] the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ
[55:44] because in that blood was the life that
[55:47] met every requirement it is the true
[55:50] atonement that blood speaks for you and
[55:53] I
[55:54] Hallelujah
[55:57] it's a right application that is placed
[56:00] there and there's no desire to go out
[56:03] anymore this is why Jesus could say even
[56:06] to the woman at the well that the father
[56:09] is seeking true worshipers
[56:12] and the true worshipers they will have
[56:15] the right application not only Spirit
[56:17] but they'll have truth also not just
[56:20] truth and no Spirit but they've got the
[56:23] right application of mechanics and
[56:26] Dynamics
[56:27] right and Jesus could go on to say I'm
[56:30] the door and by me if any man enter in
[56:34] so when entering into the Sheepfold you
[56:37] must enter in through and by him and if
[56:41] a man enters in by him he shall be saved
[56:46] Jesus said in John 14 16 I am the way
[56:49] the truth and the life and no man cometh
[56:51] unto the father but by me
[56:55] so it's showing that the right
[56:59] application is our Escape is our safety
[57:03] and we receive the benefits of that
[57:08] rightful application is that right now
[57:11] think of this caiaphasis down there when
[57:14] the Lord Jesus he was being crucified
[57:17] down there in the temple they were
[57:20] singing the Psalms
[57:22] you know they had the right scriptures
[57:25] yeah
[57:26] but they had the wrong application
[57:31] then who is it that makes the difference
[57:34] because it's more than just having word
[57:37] we've got to have the a player of the
[57:40] word
[57:41] that we might have the right application
[57:45] because catholicisms remember I instead
[57:48] of me reading it but as the Bible says
[57:52] that when they pass by the Lord Jesus on
[57:54] the cross in verse 40 it said that they
[57:57] spoke to him thou destroy us the temple
[57:59] and build us it in three days save
[58:02] thyself if thou be the Son of God come
[58:05] down from the cross likewise the chief
[58:07] priest mocked him with the scribes and
[58:10] Elders they would have come to his
[58:12] rescue but if he would have saved
[58:15] himself he could never have saved others
[58:18] you realize that moment right there was
[58:21] a test for him
[58:23] are you hearing me tonight it wasn't
[58:26] just those bad people shouldn't have
[58:28] been saying those things sometimes we
[58:30] can look at things and think why are
[58:32] they saying this why is so and so saying
[58:34] this God permits it to do what test you
[58:38] and I
[58:45] am
[58:49] you saved others himself he cannot save
[58:52] I referred to that let me go on because
[58:54] I don't want to get caught
[58:56] think of this
[58:59] they missed what was happening and what
[59:01] was taking place
[59:03] the disciples
[59:06] the disciples we looked at this some
[59:08] months ago
[59:09] they didn't know what had taken place
[59:12] yet the word was right there before him
[59:14] Zechariah on and on and on Isaiah on and
[59:18] on and on all these scriptures
[59:20] but what it is they didn't have the
[59:23] application to it they didn't have the
[59:25] understanding but when the time was
[59:27] needed for understanding
[59:29] then God himself gave understanding
[59:34] and the Lord Jesus could come out of
[59:37] the uh of the hedges and so forth and he
[59:40] steps out and he begins to speak to them
[59:43] or not Christ to have suffered these
[59:45] things and to enter into his glory
[59:48] what's he doing he's showing them
[59:50] there's the right application to the
[59:53] word because the wrong application
[59:56] caused them to be sad and despondent and
[1:00:00] discouraged by the ram uses the term
[1:00:01] bewildered well I guess we'll just go
[1:00:03] fishing I guess we'll just do this and
[1:00:05] he wasn't the one and I I guess this and
[1:00:07] I guess that and I get that's a problem
[1:00:09] guessing
[1:00:12] but see Jesus
[1:00:14] not us
[1:00:15] Jesus would not leave his church in a
[1:00:19] guessing stage
[1:00:22] and you realize when he came on the road
[1:00:24] to them well let's just go with him a
[1:00:25] minute when they came on the road they
[1:00:27] turned and asked him are you a stranger
[1:00:31] don't you know what's been going on you
[1:00:33] must not be from around here he was the
[1:00:36] very one that was with him the whole
[1:00:38] time
[1:00:43] but he made as though he was a stranger
[1:00:46] Their Eyes Were withheld from him
[1:00:50] yeah because their thought of redemption
[1:00:53] Redeemer of Israel did not match God's
[1:00:57] thought
[1:01:00] but I'm so glad
[1:01:02] that they're thinking
[1:01:05] didn't keep him at Bay
[1:01:08] I'm glad
[1:01:09] desire
[1:01:13] our desire as though it's something that
[1:01:16] we've married and God said wow they
[1:01:18] really have a desire if there's any
[1:01:20] desire in you and I at all God put that
[1:01:23] desire in there
[1:01:28] Hallelujah
[1:01:30] so the right application because look
[1:01:33] Matthew 28
[1:01:35] go you therefore into teaching the
[1:01:38] Nations baptizing them in the name of
[1:01:40] the father son and of the Holy Spirit
[1:01:43] right
[1:01:45] but the right application of it comes
[1:01:48] over to Acts 2 38.
[1:01:51] if you want the true results you got to
[1:01:54] go according to the right application
[1:01:56] right now we don't need to elaborate on
[1:01:59] that but it shows that if the right
[1:02:01] application brings forth the right
[1:02:03] spiritual results the true spiritual
[1:02:05] birth and relationship with the Lord
[1:02:07] Jesus then we need the right application
[1:02:10] of the word in every situation
[1:02:13] right
[1:02:14] we we want to be certain of God
[1:02:17] let me pick this up when we read for a
[1:02:19] text
[1:02:20] job
[1:02:22] mentions here
[1:02:25] to his to those that are around him he
[1:02:28] calls them forgers of Lies
[1:02:31] you're all physicians in verse 4 of no
[1:02:34] value
[1:02:35] job 13 5 owed that you would all
[1:02:38] together hold your peace
[1:02:40] now they did that at first for seven
[1:02:41] days right
[1:02:44] and it should be your wisdom
[1:02:48] I can't remember who it was now
[1:02:51] um I think it was the white moody or
[1:02:54] something like that or I can't remember
[1:02:56] who was that said it that you know it'd
[1:02:58] be better than some than for somebody to
[1:03:00] thank you to be a fool than you to open
[1:03:01] your mouth and leave no doubt
[1:03:04] right right it'd be better than that way
[1:03:07] but so to notice this
[1:03:09] job's three thin friends his buddies
[1:03:16] how many of you heard of times where
[1:03:18] somebody went in for a surgery and you
[1:03:19] know they'll Mark you my wife has went
[1:03:21] in for different procedures and they've
[1:03:24] um you know marked her where they were
[1:03:26] going to maybe if it's something for you
[1:03:28] know with the kidney and those things
[1:03:29] like that they Mark you right
[1:03:32] you want to make sure they're not
[1:03:33] marking the leg
[1:03:34] right right you want to make sure
[1:03:36] they're not marking the eye yeah I'm in
[1:03:39] here for this right
[1:03:40] but these guys if we can like in it like
[1:03:43] this
[1:03:44] these guys were like eye surgeons trying
[1:03:47] to perform open heart surgery
[1:03:50] it wasn't the right application
[1:03:55] stay with me here tonight we're just
[1:03:56] it's very simple we're just going to
[1:03:57] work with this
[1:03:58] the many of their ideas about God are
[1:04:01] true they're founded in scripture I mean
[1:04:03] I could we could elaborate all night
[1:04:05] many of the things they are saying as
[1:04:07] far as truth about God is true but their
[1:04:11] application
[1:04:12] in applying it to this is off
[1:04:17] are you with me
[1:04:19] so you know they took many true
[1:04:21] principles but they applied it wrongly
[1:04:24] now notice in job 4 1 I'm just going to
[1:04:26] try to go through some scriptures here
[1:04:28] here is a life as the Bible says then
[1:04:31] your life asked the temanite in job 4 1
[1:04:33] answered and said if we are saved to
[1:04:35] commune with thee he will thou be
[1:04:37] grieved but who can withhold himself
[1:04:39] from speaking in other words we have
[1:04:40] been silent long enough we have got some
[1:04:43] answers
[1:04:44] behold now here's what they're saying
[1:04:46] saying to job I think this is quite a
[1:04:48] testimony they're going to say behold
[1:04:50] thou Hast instructed many and has
[1:04:54] strengthened the weak hands thy words
[1:04:56] have upholden him that was fallen and
[1:04:59] thou has strengthened the feeble needs
[1:05:01] but now it has come upon thee and thou
[1:05:04] famous it toucheth thee and thy trouble
[1:05:06] I mean they were testifying job when
[1:05:09] people have been down around you you
[1:05:12] have went and ministered to them to
[1:05:15] strengthen them in the time of their
[1:05:17] adversity
[1:05:19] yeah but the way that they're applying
[1:05:21] this is though
[1:05:23] he should not be
[1:05:25] in the way that he is
[1:05:28] right you should not be in the
[1:05:29] bitterness of your soul
[1:05:31] meaning filling the bitterness of the
[1:05:33] situation it should not be you know
[1:05:35] filling to
[1:05:37] he's nothing but flesh
[1:05:40] are you hearing me in nothing but flesh
[1:05:44] right
[1:05:46] so here here what a what a testimony the
[1:05:49] job has been one that's comforted others
[1:05:51] by the comfort of the Lord number six
[1:05:53] look at this I want an accusation is not
[1:05:56] this thy Fear Thy confidence thy hope
[1:05:59] and the uprightness of thy ways in other
[1:06:02] words how you are behaving speaks
[1:06:06] there's a lack in your life
[1:06:08] because you should be strong during this
[1:06:11] time
[1:06:16] [Music]
[1:06:19] oh my mama
[1:06:21] we could just spill the whole can of
[1:06:22] beans but with this let's go on
[1:06:23] scripture verse 7 remember I pray thee
[1:06:27] watch this instruction that Eli has
[1:06:30] remember I pray thee who
[1:06:33] is being innocent
[1:06:35] whoever parent whoever this things
[1:06:38] whoever perish being innocent what's he
[1:06:42] charging him you're guilty
[1:06:45] now remember these are his buddies
[1:06:48] sometimes it's easier to take things
[1:06:50] from people who are complete strangers
[1:06:53] but when it becomes our bodies
[1:06:57] come on now
[1:06:59] or where were the righteous cut off even
[1:07:02] as I have seen they that plow iniquity
[1:07:05] and show wickedness reap the same
[1:07:09] when you love to go to these guys Church
[1:07:12] how could you ever hold your head up
[1:07:14] right you'd be getting blasted with
[1:07:16] Buckshot every service yeah yeah I know
[1:07:18] I know but you labor on this just a
[1:07:20] little bit but notice by the blast of
[1:07:22] God they perish and by the breath of his
[1:07:24] nostrils are they consumed
[1:07:28] now there is a great need
[1:07:31] to apply the word by divine revelation
[1:07:34] to the given situation we are living in
[1:07:37] an hour the token think how brother
[1:07:39] Brandon would take that with the token
[1:07:41] it's a time of applying he speaks of how
[1:07:45] that when sickness comes our way apply
[1:07:47] the token he said if Satan tries to come
[1:07:50] your way and tempt you apply the token
[1:07:52] so the token is not just something that
[1:07:55] we have that's not used it is our weapon
[1:08:00] are you hearing me it is our weapon
[1:08:02] against the enemy
[1:08:05] so to take what God has given us and
[1:08:08] stand there against every opposition now
[1:08:12] notice what job is doing he remember
[1:08:14] they've said a lot of truth there's a
[1:08:18] lot of true principles now let's read a
[1:08:20] few scriptures here where you can find
[1:08:22] job is going right along with it and
[1:08:24] saying that's truth Joe 9 2. I know it
[1:08:29] is so of a truth but how shall man be
[1:08:32] just with God if he will contend with
[1:08:35] him he cannot answer him one of a
[1:08:37] thousand job 12 verse 1 job answered him
[1:08:40] no doubt but ye are the people and
[1:08:42] wisdom shall die with you but I have
[1:08:45] understanding as well as you I'm not
[1:08:47] inferior to you yea who knoweth not such
[1:08:51] things as these
[1:08:54] hmm
[1:08:55] job 13 1 we read for our text Lo might
[1:08:58] not have seen all this my near hath
[1:09:01] heard and understood it what you know
[1:09:03] the same do I all know also I'm not
[1:09:06] inferior unto you in other words in all
[1:09:09] this job is not saying job is not
[1:09:11] telling them what you're saying is not
[1:09:14] truth but your application is not right
[1:09:21] I want you to think about this God is
[1:09:24] not coming to his defense on this
[1:09:27] sometimes where's this at where's the
[1:09:29] Blessed God what if what if job was here
[1:09:32] in the what's in 21st century what if
[1:09:35] Joe was here Joe get on Facebook I know
[1:09:38] that's for old people but Instagram
[1:09:39] Snapchat this and that and Joe get on
[1:09:42] bless God I'm gonna blast them in the
[1:09:44] name of Jesus I'm gonna take quotes from
[1:09:47] the message in scripture I'm going to
[1:09:49] justify myself
[1:09:52] all that all that shows is you're the
[1:09:56] one fighting the battle
[1:09:57] and as long as you fake the battle God
[1:10:00] cannot and will not fight it for you
[1:10:09] is that right
[1:10:10] as long as we fighting it God said I
[1:10:12] ain't fighting
[1:10:13] you're fighting
[1:10:16] come on we're gonna go through your
[1:10:17] quotes on this and go through a Litany
[1:10:19] of scriptures God is not going to come
[1:10:20] behind you know why because we'll keep
[1:10:22] trying to do the same things and God
[1:10:25] will not share his glory with no flesh
[1:10:30] because if we got it this way one time
[1:10:33] bless God it'll work again there there
[1:10:35] might be some things coming along like
[1:10:36] that and God finally finally gets us get
[1:10:38] in the situation you realize you know
[1:10:39] what you ain't gonna work
[1:10:41] your way ain't gonna work and I ain't
[1:10:44] gonna bless it
[1:10:45] hello that's part of our maturing and
[1:10:49] we're looking for this and land is
[1:10:51] happening why ain't that happening God
[1:10:52] said come on we got to come up higher
[1:10:55] oh I'm glad he don't do that all at once
[1:10:57] aren't you
[1:10:58] oh I'm glad man we would we would melt
[1:11:01] sure as the world
[1:11:03] think about this
[1:11:05] because everything that they are are
[1:11:07] saying and I know we know these things
[1:11:09] but I just just feel impressed of the
[1:11:12] Lord and I can't get a couldn't get away
[1:11:13] from it that
[1:11:14] as we come back into this part here with
[1:11:17] job
[1:11:18] there is they are
[1:11:21] his friends continue to come at him as
[1:11:25] though that this is correction
[1:11:28] in other words
[1:11:32] these guys can say nothing about all
[1:11:37] that job has done strengthening people
[1:11:38] encouraging people this man is being a
[1:11:41] help to all that's been around him but
[1:11:43] what they're doing is is they're coming
[1:11:45] against his character
[1:11:47] oh that's tough
[1:11:49] when your character gets get it come on
[1:11:51] now when a character gets hit remember
[1:11:54] the Lord Jesus walked with it all the
[1:11:57] time
[1:12:00] you know nothing but the product of a
[1:12:02] drunken Soldier
[1:12:04] come on now those things did not go away
[1:12:07] oh brother Samuel he was the son of God
[1:12:09] and he just
[1:12:12] he wouldn't know he had to stand right
[1:12:14] there and minister to needs when there
[1:12:18] were Pharisees that reasoned in their
[1:12:20] heart
[1:12:21] and calling the algebra and everything
[1:12:23] else but you know what
[1:12:25] he did not let that take him from his
[1:12:28] mission
[1:12:30] he I'm glad he didn't aren't you I'm he
[1:12:33] didn't spend his time trying to fight
[1:12:35] and proven I'm glad when he got up on
[1:12:37] that Easter morning he didn't rise up
[1:12:39] and say bless God where are the mockers
[1:12:41] at now I'll go show Herod no
[1:12:44] he went to those who were believers
[1:12:49] the resurrection was not for unbelievers
[1:12:54] the resurrection was for believers
[1:12:58] [Music]
[1:13:00] God has sent this message to you of
[1:13:04] Resurrection it's not a chance it's not
[1:13:07] by chance God has come to you because
[1:13:11] you're a believer
[1:13:16] and he uses Believers to prove his word
[1:13:21] [Music]
[1:13:24] was a difference between
[1:13:27] correction and approving I want you to
[1:13:28] take those two words correction
[1:13:31] and approving
[1:13:33] because like job
[1:13:35] every one of us
[1:13:37] often
[1:13:39] often
[1:13:40] when things happen we think of the
[1:13:42] negative
[1:13:44] let's be honest we do you know why
[1:13:45] because we're still in the negative
[1:13:48] so the negative that we think of right
[1:13:49] away is what am I doing wrong
[1:13:52] what's going on here and sometimes there
[1:13:54] are things we are doing wrong right but
[1:13:56] let me let me just let me say this now
[1:13:59] correction here's one thing with
[1:14:01] correction that is very very true
[1:14:04] correction always comes to us with light
[1:14:11] it's not Darkness it doesn't close off
[1:14:13] the way like there's no way out of this
[1:14:15] that's not God
[1:14:18] remember even how the spirit of the Lord
[1:14:20] was bringing it here on um on Sunday
[1:14:23] evening how the spirit of the Lord is
[1:14:25] there to Lift Us
[1:14:26] the Bible says that a just man
[1:14:31] a just man I mean this this man is
[1:14:33] standing accepted in the beloved father
[1:14:36] seven times but he gets back up why
[1:14:39] because there's a strength on the inside
[1:14:42] to get back up there's something that
[1:14:44] goes beyond his own thoughts of his own
[1:14:47] failings that says get back up again
[1:14:51] what is it it's the same one that rose
[1:14:54] up on that Easter morning
[1:14:57] same one little captivity captive that
[1:15:00] same power is in The Believer
[1:15:03] so the difference with correction
[1:15:05] correction comes with a light it's a
[1:15:08] light to instruct us that we might turn
[1:15:12] our feet in the right pathway
[1:15:16] that's what correction is correction is
[1:15:18] not God coming and beating up on us and
[1:15:20] saying you're wrong wrong wrong what
[1:15:23] what value is that
[1:15:26] right
[1:15:27] how could you even repent but you see
[1:15:30] the reason you can repent is because
[1:15:32] real correction comes with the light to
[1:15:34] show us where we are and where we ought
[1:15:36] to be
[1:15:37] and that's why Peter that's why Paul
[1:15:39] could say make straight paths for thy
[1:15:41] feet
[1:15:43] Grace that's given to direct us in the
[1:15:46] right pathway that's correction
[1:15:49] but what we're talking about here with
[1:15:51] tests and trials
[1:15:53] is approving
[1:15:55] everybody say they're with me approving
[1:15:57] oh come on let's say stronger approving
[1:16:02] brother Brandon lets us know clearly
[1:16:04] right here
[1:16:05] in this job was not being chastened of
[1:16:10] the Lord
[1:16:12] come on now you mean God's going to brag
[1:16:14] on somebody to turn around and whip them
[1:16:17] that don't make sense
[1:16:19] he said God was approving his servant
[1:16:23] so the test and trout you ought to put
[1:16:26] this back in the devil's face the test
[1:16:28] and trial is God
[1:16:31] showing his approval
[1:16:35] probably you're like me and saying
[1:16:37] I'm glad to be accepted into beloved but
[1:16:41] I don't know about all that approval
[1:16:43] right we want to we want that approval
[1:16:45] but I don't want what comes with it
[1:16:49] but remember when somebody's gotten real
[1:16:51] cold
[1:16:52] they're not afraid to test it
[1:16:55] you and I would be afraid listen
[1:16:57] if if we were asked about standing up on
[1:17:00] a trial we would say I don't know about
[1:17:01] that
[1:17:03] but God has confidence in the gold
[1:17:06] that has been placed in our life
[1:17:09] and so God doesn't matter for you oh and
[1:17:12] I don't know I don't know Lord I Lord
[1:17:14] let this cup pass for me I don't know
[1:17:15] how I don't but God has confidence
[1:17:18] that's why God is Not biting his nails
[1:17:26] I hope they make it oh I hope the Lions
[1:17:29] don't get them oh my I hope that ain't
[1:17:31] God
[1:17:34] we're standing there saying Lord give me
[1:17:37] Grace to get through it Lord give me
[1:17:39] strength to get to it Lord I need Grace
[1:17:41] for another day I need Grace for another
[1:17:43] moment and that's what we should be
[1:17:44] saying that's what we say that ain't
[1:17:46] weakness that's drawing strength from El
[1:17:49] shadia I need your grace lord I can't
[1:17:52] make it without you and God is Not
[1:17:54] biting his nails but he's just releasing
[1:17:57] to us more grace for that moment what's
[1:18:00] he doing he's making a way of Escape
[1:18:04] that we might be able to Bear the trial
[1:18:14] Hallelujah
[1:18:18] job 6 14.
[1:18:22] job lets them know in job 6 14.
[1:18:25] this is what he says to him
[1:18:29] to him
[1:18:30] that is afflicted
[1:18:33] pity should be shown from his friend
[1:18:37] but he forsaketh the fear of the
[1:18:39] Almighty
[1:18:41] in other words
[1:18:43] standing in the place of God
[1:18:46] is not standing in judgment
[1:18:49] on one another
[1:18:51] but standing in the place of God is
[1:18:54] going to minister
[1:18:56] to one in need
[1:18:58] who is my neighbor
[1:19:00] oh yeah what's what's my street address
[1:19:01] no no your neighbor is one that comes to
[1:19:05] your heart in your pathway that is in
[1:19:08] need amen that's your neighbor love thy
[1:19:11] neighbor as thyself
[1:19:16] are you hearing me now that's why I
[1:19:18] remember when they tried the scribes
[1:19:19] tried to be smart with him but telling
[1:19:20] us who is Thy Neighbor Jesus let him
[1:19:22] know the one that is pressed upon your
[1:19:24] heart that you see is in need
[1:19:27] well I'm glad because you know what
[1:19:30] brother saying he saw I was in need
[1:19:33] I was his neighbor
[1:19:34] he saw I was in need and he ministered
[1:19:38] to me
[1:19:39] he brought me into the end
[1:19:42] glory be to God he's ministering to my
[1:19:45] wounds and the needs of my life I'm glad
[1:19:48] that he picked me up because I was left
[1:19:51] for dead
[1:19:52] Lord be to God
[1:19:54] to him that is Afflicted pity should be
[1:19:56] shown from his friend but he forsaketh
[1:19:59] the fear of the almighty much more that
[1:20:01] could be said within that of verse 6.
[1:20:04] notice what job goes on to say it's very
[1:20:07] much like the same thing in job 16.
[1:20:09] job said I've heard many such things
[1:20:11] verse two miserable comforters are ye
[1:20:14] all
[1:20:16] vain words
[1:20:18] have an end
[1:20:19] or what emboldeneth thee
[1:20:22] that thou answerest
[1:20:25] I also look in verse four I also could
[1:20:28] speak as you do
[1:20:29] if your soul were in my soul Stead I
[1:20:33] could Heap up words against you
[1:20:35] what you're doing to me
[1:20:37] I can do it to you
[1:20:40] in other words that don't take anything
[1:20:42] anybody can do that look this was wrong
[1:20:45] and you must be wrong and this is wrong
[1:20:46] but he noticed he says and I could shake
[1:20:49] my head at you but this is what I would
[1:20:51] do
[1:20:52] Glory I would strengthen you with my
[1:20:55] mouth and the moving of my lips should
[1:20:58] assuage your grief
[1:21:01] you know what this is this is a man
[1:21:04] who's connected to the sacrifice
[1:21:07] by revelation
[1:21:10] he's operating
[1:21:12] by the strength of the sacrifice
[1:21:15] knowing
[1:21:16] that we are but mortal
[1:21:19] and if there's anybody how who we need
[1:21:21] encouragement
[1:21:23] are you hearing me now friends
[1:21:26] sometimes the things we say well you
[1:21:27] need to be in church you need to be in
[1:21:28] church you need to be in church bless
[1:21:29] God you need to be in church you need to
[1:21:30] be I believe in that but so that's
[1:21:33] people already know that they
[1:21:35] encouragement
[1:21:38] are you hearing me now I know it's
[1:21:39] strong but I'm just saying it as he
[1:21:41] gives it to me people already
[1:21:47] that's why when I pray and ask God Lord
[1:21:49] help me to be an encouragement to
[1:21:51] somebody because the devil's already
[1:21:53] beating them out
[1:21:55] already putting them down listen I
[1:21:58] believe in correction I believe in point
[1:22:00] pains well they need to be born again
[1:22:01] they need to be born again they need to
[1:22:02] be born again they know they need to be
[1:22:04] born again
[1:22:06] brother Samuel maybe they don't what is
[1:22:09] repeating it over and over doing
[1:22:14] Sham in the Lord
[1:22:16] encourage
[1:22:19] let them see the joy of serving God
[1:22:22] that's in you
[1:22:25] let it be when you come around they're
[1:22:27] running to you instead of ducking away
[1:22:29] from you
[1:22:31] oh
[1:22:33] amen that was free that wasn't in the
[1:22:35] notes
[1:22:37] we need to be an encouragement to one
[1:22:39] another
[1:22:42] God help us to be more observant than
[1:22:45] what anybody can see
[1:22:47] everybody can see things on the outside
[1:22:49] but God help us to be in tune with the
[1:22:52] spirit of God to minister encouragement
[1:22:55] to somebody whether you think they
[1:22:58] deserve it or not
[1:23:00] you and I didn't deserve encouragement
[1:23:04] there's times God has come my own way
[1:23:07] and he's done things we don't deserve it
[1:23:12] God forgive us if we've acted like Bill
[1:23:15] dad zofar or a Lifehouse justifying
[1:23:20] ourselves and standing in a position
[1:23:25] I don't believe these men meant to do
[1:23:26] that
[1:23:27] I don't believe we mean to do that
[1:23:31] when I say God help us
[1:23:34] help us because if there's anything
[1:23:37] that the message of the hour points to
[1:23:38] we can point to many end times signs oh
[1:23:41] this scripture is prophecy that but
[1:23:43] don't forget about the scripture where
[1:23:45] Abraham
[1:23:46] he knew lot was down there
[1:23:48] Laura
[1:23:50] would you spare it and he went on down
[1:23:52] the list
[1:23:53] for adventure Lord forgive me what if
[1:23:55] it's only 10.
[1:23:57] God said for 10 I'll spare you know what
[1:23:59] Abraham was doing
[1:24:00] he was one that was connected to the
[1:24:02] mercy seat so he was there to intercede
[1:24:06] oh yeah Esther did not recognize her
[1:24:09] position in that part and the authority
[1:24:11] and the power that was given to
[1:24:13] intercede for others
[1:24:15] but the message of the hour reminded her
[1:24:17] and Mordecai told her you are here for
[1:24:19] such a timelessness to do what intercede
[1:24:22] for one another
[1:24:25] are you hearing me
[1:24:27] listen love cannot be defeated
[1:24:30] and lovely ain't talking about powdered
[1:24:31] sugar either right
[1:24:33] there's something to say you know what
[1:24:35] we miss you we love you
[1:24:38] oh boy maybe I just need to keep plowing
[1:24:41] in this field
[1:24:44] but notice
[1:24:46] so far
[1:24:49] I'm trying to get somewhere
[1:24:52] in verse 11 look what his he comes up
[1:24:54] and these guys don't stop they're
[1:24:55] unrelenting and let me just say this to
[1:24:57] you
[1:24:59] you know it really wasn't these guys
[1:25:05] what it was
[1:25:07] Satan had come around and begin to
[1:25:09] anoint him
[1:25:10] but REM tells us I have heard but now I
[1:25:12] see he said Satan got upon job's wife
[1:25:15] Satan got up on his friends he said now
[1:25:17] he's really going to turn it on him and
[1:25:18] see if he can get him to denounce the
[1:25:20] message
[1:25:22] that's what he says
[1:25:23] he's really putting the pressure on
[1:25:25] because if it's all out I clocked out
[1:25:27] man
[1:25:28] they stay over there at that plant glory
[1:25:30] to God I'm going home but what about
[1:25:32] when accusation comes all around you
[1:25:39] what if God allows something to rise in
[1:25:41] the church surely God wouldn't do that
[1:25:42] oh yeah brother Bram says God will allow
[1:25:45] a depressing Spirit to even come in the
[1:25:48] church and start to take away some of
[1:25:49] the joy to see what you'll do and with
[1:25:52] that he says he does that with a purpose
[1:25:55] to just stretch out his wings and show
[1:25:57] himself more real
[1:25:59] repeat account
[1:26:01] that's a right application right the
[1:26:03] right application is Oh Glory oh my
[1:26:05] what's going on well I don't know what's
[1:26:06] going on maybe I need to
[1:26:13] well
[1:26:14] if anybody at any place has ever done
[1:26:16] anything like that which I'm sure there
[1:26:18] are because there's humans that have
[1:26:19] felt where there's been a depressing
[1:26:20] Spirit my goodness I need to find a new
[1:26:22] pastor I need to find a new home and I
[1:26:24] one thing about it I'll tell you this
[1:26:26] right now every son and daughter of God
[1:26:29] every one of us is going to come to
[1:26:31] maturity
[1:26:33] is that right that's why with people's
[1:26:36] actions or what are more they don't
[1:26:37] judge their actions because you know
[1:26:39] what everyone it appears before God
[1:26:42] and I'm grateful just as much as God
[1:26:44] works things out on my life I'm glad
[1:26:46] that God is patient and mindful and
[1:26:47] working things out on every one of our
[1:26:49] Lives aren't you
[1:26:50] notice what zofar says should not the
[1:26:53] multitude of words be answered and
[1:26:55] should a man full of talk be justified
[1:26:59] should thine lies oh
[1:27:02] Joe's been called a liar straight to his
[1:27:04] face now they're not just saying it
[1:27:06] should thy lies make men hold their
[1:27:10] peace when thou mock us shall know shall
[1:27:13] no man make thee ashamed
[1:27:16] verse six let me just skip some
[1:27:18] oh that he would show Thee the secrets
[1:27:21] of wisdom this is still so far that they
[1:27:24] are double to that which is know
[1:27:26] therefore that God exacteth Of Thee less
[1:27:29] than an iniquity deserves in other words
[1:27:31] what all you've got is just a speck to
[1:27:33] what you deserve job
[1:27:35] wow I feel a befriending coming on right
[1:27:38] here don't you
[1:27:40] take this person off my Facebook feed
[1:27:42] I'm gonna
[1:27:45] but remember this right here
[1:27:46] was part of the test
[1:27:50] not just removing of the things that's
[1:27:52] around him
[1:27:53] not just removing of his family
[1:27:56] but now to have accusations coming right
[1:27:58] at him
[1:27:59] from those that was friends
[1:28:03] you know God never called him anything
[1:28:05] different but his friends
[1:28:07] and even at the end of it God said you
[1:28:09] want the last you want this trial you
[1:28:11] want it finally the victory to come
[1:28:13] I want you to pray for him
[1:28:16] I want you to enter in on their behalf
[1:28:18] we won't get to that tonight I want you
[1:28:19] to do that
[1:28:20] think about when the disciples came
[1:28:24] I'm coming down here
[1:28:26] remember when the man who they looked at
[1:28:28] in John 9 and they said
[1:28:30] who sinned
[1:28:31] this man or his parents that he was born
[1:28:33] blind
[1:28:34] right I mean that's how their their
[1:28:36] application something somebody did
[1:28:38] something wrong
[1:28:39] if this is in their life oh they were
[1:28:41] wrong wrong wrong wrong
[1:28:43] and Jesus said
[1:28:45] neither
[1:28:47] but this is so that the glory of God
[1:28:49] might be made manifest
[1:28:53] so this situation that you're trying to
[1:28:56] apply as Sin in them or sin in their
[1:29:00] parents It Isn't So
[1:29:02] it's an opportunity for the glory of God
[1:29:05] to be made manifest
[1:29:07] and brother Brandon picks it up like
[1:29:08] this
[1:29:10] brother Neville's been in an accident
[1:29:12] brother Chris
[1:29:14] for the Christ hit a post
[1:29:16] brother Branham same time same time
[1:29:18] frame boom and the gun went off three
[1:29:21] things happened
[1:29:22] and here's the things going on brother
[1:29:24] Brown calls it right out in the
[1:29:25] Tabernacle
[1:29:27] where it's being said oh brother Neville
[1:29:29] is out of the will of God but in the
[1:29:31] Christ is out of the will of God oh
[1:29:32] brother branham's out of the will of God
[1:29:33] brother Graham said see how things it
[1:29:35] looks like when all thumbs are down on
[1:29:37] you
[1:29:39] and then how their accusations come and
[1:29:41] he takes us right to this scripture of
[1:29:43] John 9.
[1:29:44] he said but all of this God has
[1:29:47] permitted that the works of God might be
[1:29:51] made known
[1:29:52] I don't know about you but the Holy
[1:29:53] Spirit inspired that thought some months
[1:29:56] ago
[1:29:57] I'm he's not finished with me yet
[1:30:00] we could take that from the prophet
[1:30:02] right there not just looking back at
[1:30:04] scripture but seeing it right now his
[1:30:06] head shouldn't have been on his
[1:30:07] shoulders
[1:30:09] is that right
[1:30:10] but you know what God wasn't finished
[1:30:12] with him and think what messages came
[1:30:15] out of that right there letting off the
[1:30:20] pressure
[1:30:21] that though something says it's
[1:30:23] correctly bored it's got to be produced
[1:30:25] from the factory itself it's got to be
[1:30:29] God is the one who makes Christians
[1:30:32] is that right it ain't a church boring
[1:30:34] us out and Fitness on a gun stock no
[1:30:36] we've got to be pressurized by the Holy
[1:30:39] Spirit
[1:30:40] oh glory be to God so what was it right
[1:30:42] application
[1:30:46] right here in job 21 actually in job 20.
[1:30:49] I don't have this down but to think of
[1:30:51] it in job 20 they you know they are
[1:30:54] speaking of in that moment of how that
[1:30:57] in life as I believe is the one speaking
[1:30:59] in that chapter and you know talking
[1:31:01] about the you know that those who do
[1:31:03] wrong and the things that take place in
[1:31:06] their life and you know these things
[1:31:07] happen and they lose this and this and
[1:31:10] this
[1:31:11] but Joe picks it up in chapter 21 and
[1:31:14] let me just paraphrase it but job makes
[1:31:17] clear yeah there's truth there
[1:31:20] but the wrong reward isn't always
[1:31:23] present in this life in other words
[1:31:25] Cloudy Skies
[1:31:27] are not always a sign of disapproval
[1:31:31] neither are everything going right signs
[1:31:35] of approval
[1:31:37] see what's Joe doing he's directing it
[1:31:40] back the approval
[1:31:42] is under the blood
[1:31:45] because you don't think of Lazarus and
[1:31:47] the beggar Lazarus the beggar and the
[1:31:50] Rich Young Ruler
[1:31:52] in this lifetime the Rich Young Ruler
[1:31:54] hey after meeting Jesus
[1:31:57] he continued to build more barns
[1:32:00] man it got bigger and bigger and better
[1:32:02] and better and better glory to God I've
[1:32:04] got a fleet of Cadillacs man I've got
[1:32:06] this
[1:32:08] but in actuality
[1:32:10] his day of Grace was gone
[1:32:13] and who who was the one that had a
[1:32:14] better reward the beggar Lazarus because
[1:32:17] he was in Abraham's bosom
[1:32:19] the rich the young man lifted up his
[1:32:21] eyes in hell right but in this lifetime
[1:32:24] if we go according to their application
[1:32:27] we could say ah everything's good to go
[1:32:29] this guy's good man he believes in the
[1:32:31] Commandments he believed
[1:32:34] but it wasn't so
[1:32:41] job 22
[1:32:43] let me leave it like this in job 22.
[1:32:48] job is
[1:32:49] accused
[1:32:51] that what's happening to you
[1:32:54] is because
[1:32:56] you have sent the widows away empty
[1:33:00] you've not given water to the weary
[1:33:03] thou has taken a pledge from thy brother
[1:33:05] for none and stripped the naked of their
[1:33:07] clothing now these are scriptures right
[1:33:09] out of Exodus
[1:33:10] there are quoting
[1:33:14] truth
[1:33:17] but the application of it is wrong
[1:33:21] and the wrong application
[1:33:24] will never bring the right results
[1:33:27] you've got to have the right application
[1:33:31] God I need the right application
[1:33:33] in my situation
[1:33:35] I need the right applicant we can say
[1:33:38] that I need the right application
[1:33:42] because it's only the right application
[1:33:43] we receive
[1:33:45] the blessings of the Lord remember in
[1:33:48] the valley what we read there in Psalms
[1:33:50] 84 where we're drawing from in that
[1:33:51] Valley he make us the pools to be filled
[1:33:55] with rain
[1:33:56] it's not coming out of the valley oh I'm
[1:33:58] out of the Valley now the blessings come
[1:34:00] no if we can get into that place in the
[1:34:02] right right position in the valley then
[1:34:04] the wells start filling up
[1:34:06] the pool will start filling up
[1:34:09] why because it's a place what God wants
[1:34:11] to do for us
[1:34:13] in the valley
[1:34:14] that when we come out of it
[1:34:16] we're stronger
[1:34:18] but the right application
[1:34:21] means everything
[1:34:24] oh how we need him don't we
[1:34:27] I say God help me
[1:34:29] help us Lord
[1:34:31] amen to really really before before
[1:34:35] things that we just start we start
[1:34:37] saying things and talking about things
[1:34:38] God helped me to really put a guard
[1:34:40] about my mouth
[1:34:42] help me Lord to know when there's times
[1:34:44] that are things to be said and when
[1:34:46] there's times when there's things to be
[1:34:48] lived
[1:34:49] help me Lord not to be moving around and
[1:34:52] this has happened because of this and
[1:34:54] because of that
[1:34:57] God help us
[1:35:00] God help us
[1:35:03] one of the hardest times and things that
[1:35:06] is I would think a lot of times as a
[1:35:08] pastor is where things have to be
[1:35:10] brought out or maybe something pointed
[1:35:12] out but it's very rare that things are
[1:35:15] done in a manner to where it's
[1:35:17] correction because testing trials I want
[1:35:19] you to understand this
[1:35:21] tests and trials are not correction
[1:35:26] there are proven
[1:35:28] it's God pruning and approving Our Lives
[1:35:32] if you can just think back to what took
[1:35:34] place in heaven God was bragging on job
[1:35:38] right it wasn't Job saying hey Lord I'm
[1:35:40] pretty good hey God no
[1:35:42] if Joe knew what was coming he'd have
[1:35:44] been telling Lord don't
[1:35:46] pick somebody else to brag on
[1:35:49] Lord I defer my brother brag on sister
[1:35:52] Lord brag on my brother go just brag on
[1:35:54] them lord they're such a wonderful
[1:35:55] example lord they're a perfect and
[1:35:57] upright person but God
[1:36:01] was going to approve job
[1:36:05] what was he bringing out of job what was
[1:36:07] already in job
[1:36:10] what job didn't even realize laid in him
[1:36:13] God knew how late anyway
[1:36:15] God knows what lays in you and you're in
[1:36:17] our lives and like job
[1:36:19] I wonder how many times
[1:36:22] that even in this with the wrong
[1:36:23] application has come
[1:36:26] I wonder how many times because there's
[1:36:27] some of these things that job says he's
[1:36:30] going to have to go around
[1:36:32] and he's answered a little sharply
[1:36:34] are you hearing it's been truth that
[1:36:36] he's answered four years of life he's
[1:36:38] going to have to go around and
[1:36:41] make that right
[1:36:44] are you hearing me
[1:36:45] so look not only do they have the wrong
[1:36:48] application
[1:36:49] but it's testing job too
[1:36:53] you know sometimes I used to look and
[1:36:56] in my mind I've had different students
[1:36:59] I've had in the past that actually have
[1:37:01] listened in I found out later when I've
[1:37:02] ministered in other places they made
[1:37:03] comments
[1:37:05] being in my class but they if they were
[1:37:08] streaming this they never
[1:37:09] this hadn't been them but I wondered
[1:37:11] sometimes I thought you know I get the
[1:37:13] class list
[1:37:15] man
[1:37:17] Glory so-and-so moved out of the
[1:37:19] district or they moved to another
[1:37:20] elementary school thank you Jesus
[1:37:23] thank you Lord for your blessings on me
[1:37:27] and then they show up at the door and
[1:37:28] I'm ready to argue with him you're
[1:37:29] supposed to be in here you were supposed
[1:37:30] to be you're this is your ad what's your
[1:37:32] address tell me what your address is
[1:37:34] you know what I know because I already
[1:37:36] had to deal with them the year before in
[1:37:37] my classroom
[1:37:38] seven timeouts in there
[1:37:42] are you with me
[1:37:44] but don't just leave the classroom that
[1:37:46] applies to a lot of things in our life
[1:37:48] right
[1:37:49] but you know what even those things like
[1:37:51] that and the things that comes our way
[1:37:53] well we can look at oh boy this student
[1:37:55] oh this person oh this one on the job oh
[1:37:58] bless God I gotta get out of this
[1:38:00] department I gotta get yeah
[1:38:03] God said if
[1:38:05] we're not going to get it molded out
[1:38:07] here we're going to get it molded out
[1:38:08] over there
[1:38:10] because sure in the goodness and mercy
[1:38:11] going to follow you all the days of your
[1:38:13] life
[1:38:14] there's going to be things brought out
[1:38:15] of your life that only
[1:38:19] and bring out of your life
[1:38:22] and I'll tell you what
[1:38:23] from my flesh all of it to your flesh
[1:38:27] not one of us
[1:38:29] enjoys our character
[1:38:32] to be questioned
[1:38:35] we're ready to defend
[1:38:39] I'm speaking truth you know that we're
[1:38:40] ready to defend I gotta go out there I
[1:38:43] gotta call it
[1:38:49] I'm not saying that there aren't times
[1:38:51] where things have to be maybe laid out
[1:38:54] but check your heart
[1:38:56] if you're acting in an anxiousness it's
[1:38:59] not God leaving you
[1:39:02] but God allows accusations to come
[1:39:05] that's part of the ash Heap that's part
[1:39:08] of the trial
[1:39:09] it's things coming our way
[1:39:11] to see what we're going to do about it
[1:39:13] well they should have said that if they
[1:39:15] have the love of God in their heart
[1:39:17] bless God I've got I've got 52 quotes on
[1:39:19] what brother Brown said about this if
[1:39:21] they have the love of God
[1:39:25] so John are you wanting to call down
[1:39:26] fire from heaven on

[1:40:03] my fish is weak Lord my spirit is weary
[1:40:07] Lord I want him to vindicate myself I
[1:40:10] want to prove my I want to do Lord I
[1:40:12] don't even have the answer right now but
[1:40:13] I know I need Grace

[1:40:17] how many degrees right now Lord I need
[1:40:19] Grace for this moment Lord I need Grace
[1:40:21] Lord to make it through this trial I

[1:40:28] but I need Grace Lord at this moment
[1:40:32] I need Grace so that I can give others
[1:40:35] Grace In This Moment

[1:41:03] that's the way it's got to be
[1:41:08] oh I need more
[1:41:12] [Music]
[1:41:17] up till there's no room left in me
[1:41:24] [Music]

[1:41:33] all the complaining I've done Lord
[1:41:37] they're yours now
[1:41:40] oh I need more grace
[1:41:43] I need more
[1:41:50] I need more
[1:41:52] [Music]
[1:42:03] foreign
[1:42:06] [Music]
[1:42:12] you fill me with nothing less
[1:42:15] [Music]
[1:42:22] oh God help me to look in the mirror of
[1:42:24] the word Lord
[1:42:25] [Music]
[1:42:38] I need more of you
[1:42:41] thank you
[1:42:43] Give Me Your Love
[1:42:46] and the world can have the rest more
[1:42:52] over I could never
[1:42:56] get enough oh yeah
[1:43:02] [Music]
[1:43:12] for you
[1:43:15] Lord
[1:43:17] Lord
[1:43:19] [Music]
[1:43:37] we look into the mirror of God's word
[1:43:40] I want to examine my life
[1:43:43] I want to be true about it I'm saying
[1:43:45] this for me I want to be real about it
[1:43:48] it's not that I come to service
[1:43:50] expecting oh this thing if I don't get
[1:43:52] beat on the head it's not been I've not
[1:43:54] been a good service no
[1:43:56] trust we've grown beyond that
[1:43:59] because correction is not to beat us
[1:44:00] down
[1:44:02] correction is a light that points us
[1:44:04] where we're wrong and the right way to
[1:44:06] go
[1:44:07] right I know sometimes that maybe our
[1:44:10] personality or makeup we could respond
[1:44:11] to that we really feel like man I've
[1:44:13] been in a good service if I've been
[1:44:14] hammered on that that that doesn't apply
[1:44:18] but sometimes our makeups are like that
[1:44:19] sometimes maybe we've been conditioned
[1:44:21] that way but you know the word of God I
[1:44:24] don't care if a man moves he might stand
[1:44:26] here he might sit on a stool
[1:44:28] Jesus did most of his preaching sitting
[1:44:31] in a chair
[1:44:33] are you hearing me so the anointing had
[1:44:35] nothing to do with moving the anointing
[1:44:38] is the person
[1:44:40] you know I I am the way I am I I don't
[1:44:44] act no different than what I but it
[1:44:46] doesn't have to be it's the anointing
[1:44:50] and you know what it comes down to
[1:44:52] reflection
[1:44:54] I don't want to sit here in a service
[1:44:57] and say
[1:44:59] oh I see oh I see sister Caroline back
[1:45:02] there I hope she's well she's getting it
[1:45:05] what's wrong with that
[1:45:07] right
[1:45:09] sitting up here
[1:45:11] bless God yeah I see Shane not an old
[1:45:13] praise the Lord he's getting glory to
[1:45:15] God this service I tell you this has
[1:45:17] been a productive service
[1:45:20] you hearing me Church
[1:45:22] when we're to look into the word of God
[1:45:25] ourselves
[1:45:28] because God ain't going to give take me
[1:45:30] into Rapture because I'm checking on
[1:45:31] everybody else and measuring them up
[1:45:33] because who gave me the measuring stick
[1:45:35] anyhow
[1:45:36] right the Bible said work out your own
[1:45:41] salvation with fear and trimming
[1:45:43] what does that mean in my own self
[1:45:45] looking in the word taking account
[1:45:47] because how do you know that me taking
[1:45:50] account of this in the word and really
[1:45:52] saying Lord I've never seen it like that
[1:45:54] and God uses that as a channel now to
[1:45:57] minister to somebody else's life
[1:46:00] and that was needed
[1:46:04] in order to minister to their life
[1:46:07] he has no hands
[1:46:09] but ours
[1:46:10] no feet
[1:46:12] but ours
[1:46:16] oh God help us
[1:46:18] help us to look in the mirror of the
[1:46:19] word
[1:46:20] help us the Lord help me to have the
[1:46:22] right application help me not Lord like
[1:46:25] the Bible said by the Gomez quotes this
[1:46:27] scripture I'll tell you I've heard him
[1:46:28] quoted so many times and it's absolutely
[1:46:30] the truth
[1:46:31] the Bible said be swift to hear and slow
[1:46:32] to speak
[1:46:34] right we've heard it said God gave us
[1:46:37] two mouths in one ear nope that ain't
[1:46:39] what he said
[1:46:40] God gave us two ears in one mouth
[1:46:43] God help us
[1:46:45] help us the Lord to have the right
[1:46:46] application help us to have the right
[1:46:49] application help us like Paul said that
[1:46:52] we would comfort you with the God of all
[1:46:55] comfort that same comfort that we are
[1:46:57] comforted by in our trials and
[1:46:59] tribulations that you might be comforted
[1:47:02] that you might be strengthened
[1:47:04] you realize sometimes that there's
[1:47:05] things
[1:47:07] I think God has made this so clear
[1:47:08] sometimes there's things that you can
[1:47:10] you can point out I can look at things
[1:47:11] sometimes as a pastor of certain things
[1:47:13] but you know it's got to come to an
[1:47:15] encouragement first
[1:47:16] it's encouraging things
[1:47:18] because you know what it's got to be God
[1:47:22] to deal with lives
[1:47:25] are you hearing
[1:47:26] you might disagree with me but that's
[1:47:28] okay I know where I'm standing
[1:47:30] I know where I'm standing
[1:47:34] [Music]
[1:47:35] if there's anything we need right now in
[1:47:37] this hour we need encouragement
[1:47:40] we need encouragement
[1:47:42] an encouragement to one another
[1:47:45] one thing that I'll call and I'll send
[1:47:47] out and text and I call different ones
[1:47:49] and we miss you
[1:47:52] we miss you
[1:47:55] we love you
[1:47:59] let's say you don't mean you don't go
[1:48:00] through a Litany of Quotes no
[1:48:03] no
[1:48:04] I don't do that you know me by now I
[1:48:07] don't do that
[1:48:09] but it points you to Jesus Christ I
[1:48:11] don't say that's uplifting me you
[1:48:13] understand I'm not perfect I'm not
[1:48:15] perfect as much as you hear this out of
[1:48:17] this Bell right here God's had to teach
[1:48:19] me
[1:48:20] God's had to teach me brother Drake he's
[1:48:22] had to teach me but Shane he said to
[1:48:24] teach me and he's still teaching me
[1:48:30] oh I'm glad about that huh
[1:48:34] say Lord help us help help us help me
[1:48:39] helped me to have the right application
[1:48:42] just as much as I could expect that out
[1:48:44] of others Lord help me to have the right
[1:48:45] application in my spirit love suffereth
[1:48:48] long
[1:48:50] and it's kind
[1:48:54] help me
[1:48:56] help me Lord help
[1:49:00] me well I need more
[1:49:05] of you
[1:49:07] living in me
[1:49:13] [Music]
[1:49:16] girl
[1:49:18] oh let's land Hallelujah
[1:49:22] [Music]
[1:49:35] oh God
[1:49:37] [Music]

[1:50:40] [Music]
[1:50:50] [Music]
[1:51:00] to love
[1:51:01] [Music]
[1:51:10] to love for I could never

[1:51:29] he wants foreign
[1:51:31] [Music]
[1:51:44] [Music]
[1:52:01] foreign
[1:52:03] [Music]
[1:52:34] experience
[1:52:36] for
[1:52:37] ever more
[1:52:39] [Music]
[1:52:54] you know I look and I meditate I
[1:52:56] meditate on these scriptures a lot
[1:53:00] I've just looked at that and I thought
[1:53:01] you know
[1:53:03] there's times that I think all of us can
[1:53:05] relate to
[1:53:07] maybe when we're talking to someone or
[1:53:09] and we in our own lives we think I don't
[1:53:12] want to compromise sometimes we view
[1:53:14] compromise that if if I don't say a
[1:53:16] scripture
[1:53:17] if I don't give a quote if I don't go
[1:53:19] through and really preach it to him I'm
[1:53:22] talking about sitting down with somebody
[1:53:23] then I'm compromising see sometimes
[1:53:26] things that we say or would have said is
[1:53:30] because we've come under our own
[1:53:32] pressure
[1:53:34] and you see what's happened
[1:53:36] you say well that was the leading of the
[1:53:37] Holy Spirit no God don't pressure he
[1:53:40] leads
[1:53:41] he leads us
[1:53:43] sometimes we're pressured and we start
[1:53:46] getting under
[1:53:47] I wonder how Bill daddy life has and so
[1:53:49] far I wonder you know what they probably
[1:53:51] if I don't say this if I don't I'm going
[1:53:53] to be no
[1:53:56] but you know they didn't say nothing for
[1:53:58] seven days when they first looked at job
[1:54:00] they didn't recognize him
[1:54:03] but one thing job did say if you would
[1:54:04] have just held your peace
[1:54:07] that would have been your wisdom how
[1:54:09] many knows sometimes just just holding
[1:54:11] their peace says a whole lot more than
[1:54:13] anything will come out here
[1:54:15] sometimes it's just holding their piece
[1:54:17] sometimes it's just being a listener I
[1:54:20] don't know how many times as a pastor
[1:54:21] sometimes it's just listening
[1:54:24] it's just listening
[1:54:26] when there has been times of Correction
[1:54:29] it sure isn't anything that I value I
[1:54:31] don't do it lightly
[1:54:33] but under his leading
[1:54:35] and I'll wait on him
[1:54:37] I don't care if people feel like I'm
[1:54:38] dragging my feet don't matter I don't go
[1:54:40] I don't walk according to nobody else is
[1:54:42] beat I want to know by his leading
[1:54:44] because I want him to accompany whether
[1:54:47] it's in the room on the phone or
[1:54:49] whatever more I want him to accompany
[1:54:51] you say brother Simon what do you look
[1:54:53] for I look for his leading and I want
[1:54:55] him to come to where it's like brother
[1:54:56] Brandon standing in the pasture where
[1:54:58] the bull is at to where I know when that
[1:55:00] Supreme anointing has taken over to
[1:55:02] where it's there
[1:55:03] [Music]
[1:55:04] sometimes different Brothers have had to
[1:55:06] be back there with me for different
[1:55:07] things and they can tell you they know
[1:55:09] when the anointing comes different ones
[1:55:11] that have set right back there and when
[1:55:12] things have opened up not even about
[1:55:13] correction just about opening
[1:55:16] of questions and you know it's more than
[1:55:18] a man it's God
[1:55:21] you know when his presence sets down
[1:55:25] eight and we can expect in our everyday
[1:55:28] walk
[1:55:29] like Joe job was waiting on it Lord I
[1:55:31] don't know what's going on here
[1:55:33] but what are you going to do Joe I'm
[1:55:35] going to stand on what I do know
[1:55:37] I'm just going to stand on that
[1:55:39] because he's never failed to tell me
[1:55:42] what I need to know when I need to know
[1:55:44] it
[1:55:45] and if I don't know it right now I'm
[1:55:47] going to keep looking to him and I'm
[1:55:48] standing here
[1:55:50] this trial ain't going to move me off of
[1:55:51] him
[1:55:53] I'm just going to keep on standing
[1:55:55] so Lord when you're going to answer you
[1:55:57] have to come right to the word because
[1:55:58] that's where I'm going to stand
[1:56:00] don't you love me
[1:56:04] father
[1:56:09] Lord I know
[1:56:11] it could be very simple thought that I I
[1:56:14] just love how you come this way Lord
[1:56:17] I love how you come to speak to our
[1:56:19] hearts and remind us Lord
[1:56:22] you're gonna
[1:56:24] even these things tonight Lord that we
[1:56:26] speak we speak from experience
[1:56:30] I think Lord God of every one of us
[1:56:32] there's times Lord that
[1:56:34] we all can say I can say
[1:56:36] that I've never sometimes I've never
[1:56:38] looked at accusations or being
[1:56:40] misunderstood or certain things being
[1:56:42] said sometimes I've never I've hadn't
[1:56:44] looked at that in the past I've quoted
[1:56:46] certain scriptures but Lord how you've
[1:56:48] opened it to me here in the past weeks
[1:56:50] my
[1:56:52] it's been really something Lord
[1:56:55] and I'm thankful for it because
[1:56:58] I've needed it Lord
[1:57:01] I think of what you told me Lord God a
[1:57:03] couple weeks ago in prayer there I'm
[1:57:05] leading you
[1:57:07] I'm leading you Lord you're leading us
[1:57:10] Lord
[1:57:11] in the valley you don't leave us
[1:57:13] you're leading us Lord when situations
[1:57:16] arise that are not favorable to our
[1:57:18] flesh yet you're leading us Lord you
[1:57:21] haven't left us for you said Lo I'm with
[1:57:23] you always
[1:57:25] you're leading us Lord
