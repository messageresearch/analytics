outside with the weather the father I just pray Lord as we commit these things into your hands Lord and father just leaving it there Lord and that we might Lord be able to enjoy ourselves in you and receive what it is Lord you desire Lord to express to our hearts tonight father we want to say we love you Lord we appreciate you father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ may you minister to every need more amen god bless you let's let's look in Romans chapter 5 and verse 1 certainly wasn't planning on the the weather and the conditions the way that it was and its how everything kind of just has taken us by surprise even though I'm watching that looking at that looking on the radar but so we need to know where I came from in Quebec brother Steve Brisson was flying on those roads and those roads were iced iced over each service and so I was just sitting in the car I said to the Lord Jesus cuz it wasn't straight roads it was up up and down and curves oh lord help us you know so we got to looking at this tonight and you know it was just kind of testing the roads on her way in and so you know we just we do the best we can do you know with it and um at the time I had got a text cuz I was just so looking over things and by the time I got a text there's no way we could make a call to everybody and do all of that either so you're not disappointed are you okay well I figure if we have to go Turtles pace on the way home I guess we'll do it but it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen and I I didn't expect those who live a distance away I'm glad they didn't try to make it so let's just look in the word and let's have a little bit of a study here tonight in Romans 5 verse 1 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of God and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience and they say lord help me help me to mature in this and patience experience and experience oh and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us amen may God bless you and bless as what as you're being seated I think that that's something that within our lives as we've been looking at this with tests and trials that we all desire to be pleasing to the Lord and and that the Lord would would help us that when even in looking at tests and trials that we're we're able to look at him not in a measure because we'll never come to a place of being an autopilot and what I mean by autopilot is we're that we something just switches on and we say oh this is a test or trial and know it affects there's a part of us that really feels the effects of it there's two realms of us that really feels the effects of a test or trial and you're never gonna get beyond that our flesh our spirit that part of spirits connected to the mind all of that it feels the effect of it but I believe that the greatness of God moving within our lives is also bringing out of our lives for even what he knows awaits us whether tomorrow whether the next week whether the next month the year God is working all things out after the counsel of his own will and so when we're looking at this the the scriptures as it said that it's knowing this how do we glory in tribulations because we know that tribulation worketh patience and we see how patience it from patience there's an experience and from experience there's there's hope and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us you know the experience is every one of us that things that we have come through the tests and trials down through the pathways of life wherever and however long that we have been serving the Lord those tests and trials in our lives have worked patience and from that patience it's worked experiences in our life sometimes you might look at the experience in your life and it may not even though I'm not going to say that we don't say it's not great but sometimes you just don't understand sometimes the great impact that an experience can have on someone the experience that God would bring you through and me through or someone else in here and that experience is not just for our molding or making but where that we're able to pull it next to somebody else and say hang in there sister God is faithful hang in there my brother of God is faithful I've been there I've been there maybe not the exact exact specs of the tester trial but to know that God is faithful I've been maybe it's a situation about a job maybe it's a situation about a loved one and may not be the same degree but we do know that God is still God and that experience that testimony your life and I believe that God not just as God use his word the Bible tells us that we receive patient and comfort from the Scriptures and that gives us hope you see the Spirit of God is able to direct us and I believe this with all my heart into the word into the message and looking at these things that sometimes what we're going through or what we will come through you'll find that how the Spirit of God will direct you right into something that where you'll just encourage you with a word and I I've told you that many times before it's not just things that I've read sometimes but even through some of the greatest tests and trials I'll hear you know brother branham's voice come right through my mind right through my heart now hear him saying this particular phrase in the message and it'll come back to me I said thank you Lord because I I know that that's the Lord bringing it back to me and and I'm thankful for that because the Bible said it is the Spirit of Truth and he'll lead and guide us into all truth and bring those things back to our remembrance what we have need of and sometimes you know when we're we're looking for things and we may not have the the answer for it sometimes we're may be searching for a scripture or searching for something maybe a Lord when we're looking in the message and we don't seem like that we're finding maybe something that's pinned right down but God in the midst of it all we know that he's got it in control and what I want to just kind of just look at it just seems tonight what's pressing on my heart and just for a few moments is that when we look at this there's a hope and a hope itself there's an expectation that moves in our life and then we can have an expectation because of what of what God has done in our life and there's a patient's and the patient's has moved and experienced and spirits experience itself it brings forth hope none of these things right here are given or handed to us but this is all part of the molding and the shaping of our character and our hope maketh not ashamed now I'm not going to ask you tonight but how many of us have expected things to turn out a certain way and it did we expected it that's hope that's what this word is it's an expectation brother brems said it like this and the message even to wear that when himself he says he's broken my heart he's talking to the Lord he said you've broken my heart many times over and over again but I love you for it so the breaking of the heart was that maybe the expectation of what certain things that this would happen this way or this would come out this way or this would happen and it didn't happen that way perhaps even when a person themselves has been prayed for and God drops in their heart of that there is a healing within their body now we understand that it's faith to bring that about but the expectation itself of how that it's going to be that is sovereignly reserved to God even the timing of it to a believer once it drops that's it it doesn't matter it might come tomorrow it might come the next moment might not it doesn't matter it's that's a seed and the faith of Abraham it simply is that God has already said it and God will fulfill it and he gives us the strength to be able to hold on and to maintain in that promise and you know as God continues to give us his strength there's a dissolving of our strength and we're so thankful for that that's what we want in our lives and and I look at that how many times that we've had disappointments in our life we've had things to where that we wanted something to go in a certain way and it didn't and we've had certain expectations but yet thank God for the love of God when it's shed abroad in our hearts it holds us in the midst of it because no doubt within families and marriages and and all across even within a church sometimes disappointments there's there's a there's things that we are our expectations are not maybe where we want them to be but yet what holds us and what keeps us in the midst of it is it because our expectations are met or our disappointments or or what we're wanting no it's it's the love of God that that's what holds us and that's what keeps us in the midst of everything that's a real love because truly we're gonna experience disappointments and the reality is it's not that God himself wants to disappoint you and I but the truth of the matter is it's not God ever making a promise and then he pulls it back around from you and I and says no I'm not gonna do it that way no God makes his promise and how that that promise is fulfilled is left up to him now I want to read to hear a little statement out of the out of the message the Messiah and brother brems referring to the stats cliff family and I just want to read this to you how brother Branham would would speak concerning this a moment in their life what a trying time when the little baby was passing away and I and I look at this brother em says here's the little mother that's standing here her baby had died over in Germany and her husband's a chaplain they called up long distance about five times through a day and night to ask me to come said they know that God would raise that little baby up I said let me go pray and and I went and a prayed that afternoon that night and I'll show you brother band goes on to talk about how the doctors they believed it and they read the book prophet visits visits Africa and then the little mother in the next paragraph she said God will raise the baby up and see what faith her faith was God will raise the baby up the doctors read the book prophet visit South Africa he said the baby had been dead before they noted about four or five hours so they got the father word down to the base where he was and the baby had been dead died in the night and so the doctor said all right I'll tell you what I'll do I'll slip over and turn the oxygen back on and he let the baby lay there for two days with the oxygen turned on waiting and I was over here praying they was going to fly me across with a jet I could leave here an army jet and be back the same day to Germany now I want you to catch this they have faith that God will raise the baby up the doctor has read the book prophet visits Africa and the doctor is convinced but what he's read and he goes in and turns on the oxygen it says we're gonna leave this oxygen and on until he gets here the doctors convinced so what I'm trying to say there is nothing where you'd like the Lord Jesus remember when he came to gyruss is Houston the others he had to put them out where there wasn't any belief there's no such thing here all are in agreeance with this and belief so what we would look at it say that's the conditions that are met they're all believing I mean here is a tragedy that's happened here where this baby has already died we would look at and say the the parents have faith the doctor has faith to where he would go in and turn the oxygen supply those conditions are met is that right the scripture you know the scriptures are clear God respects faith anytime where faith is many times out you know brother Rambo tell us he said that how people were you know would go rub a poster they would go do this or how they even touch the Beatles and he said many times he said what it is he said God honors faith and then people believe they're touching God but look what's this situation that's here one morning he says about daylight I got up and the wife went out of the room and she went out of the room I just waked up and I'm laying there a bit directly I heard something coming into the room and had looked and there was something moving in the room and I jumped up and I said Lord what would you have your servant know he said do not rebuke that that's the hand of the Lord so I got her on the phone imagine making this phone call yeah I've thought about that many times imagine making this phone call I said no God has called your baby and so when she come over to see us he left at the house when I left yesterday she said what was it brother branham my weakness of faith I said you have great faith you pray for your baby you and your husband held on to it God raised that baby and he refused to do it because he knows what's best and still you love him that's real faith many times just take that phrase and search it through the message that's real faith you'll hear you'll see that same phrase used about three other times where brother Ram is talking about with people whose faith has rose to a place to receive their healing but you see there's another aspect of faith faith isn't always that I get what I'm Reese what I'm praying about that's not faith you see there's many times we want certain things and we're praying about it maybe we pray today we pray a week pray a month pray a year pray and pray and pray and we're keeping on and we're praying and we're not we seem like we're not getting any answer does that mean that we stop praying no don't keep praying until you have an answer from God either way keep trusting him keep committing it into his hands but if God himself in any of this case would would choose to say no and he doesn't say no because he doesn't have a heart think about it this is a mother's child I mean you know when I think of just as imposter how many times that I've prayed here how many times in other places I've been and prayed with mothers and dads that where their children have went wayward or or certain things that's come up that's a father's heart a mother's heart is for their child even when they're going through things but to look in the midst of this not only do I look at how that brother branham had to make the phone call and handle this and I don't want to make this you know talk about it a lot but I want you to understand something right here that brother Branham himself he has this gift within his life God has given this it's not just a gift but here he stands as a prophet of God he has the authority I may say to you like this he had the authority if he would have prayed for that baby God would have honored the prayer God would have honored it God would have raised it up that the difference friends there is a faith that is there that house if he himself that's why brother brems says you want to watch he said that with that gift what a person would do and see God God could trust where the Prophet himself God could trust it now listen that's an example even to you and I that you and I would be in a place to say Lord let me be reso reserved that I'm not anxious to do something but if there's any anxiousness let me be anxious to be yielded to where to where I'm just as much at peace if he says yes or if he says no see it isn't the magnitude that God would use us it's just simply enough to know that we are reserved to him that's that's the blessing that we're here so notice he says I got her on the phone let me I'm sorry I already read that he said you've got a great faith you pray for your baby you and your husband held on to it God raised that baby and he refused to do it because he knows what's best and still you love him that's real faith I believe with all my heart that these experiences within it that when we get to the other side and we and we meet up with the stats cliff family we're going to be able to shake their hands and say thank you that God did you allow the experience in your life to bring strength to me you allowed an experience for a part of the word to be taught by experience that real faith is not me getting or everything is answered just like I pray for it but real faith is trusting him even when the answer does not come how I wanted to come disappointed you think she wasn't disappointed sure they were sure they were it wasn't that they no doubt the stance flips were walking around I'm gonna read you a moment I'm gonna read you another part in here of where there is the condolences that brother Branham actually personally gives to the stats cuz I ran across this the actual personal condolences of where he himself is trying to help them to understand even what he himself doesn't understand that's real faith then their hearts there's no doubt they're disappointed but do they love the Lord absolutely so you mean that because their baby wasn't raised up that that that that they they they didn't have faith no they had real faith real faith is standing look what brother Bremen goes on to say look at this teaching moment anybody anybody when mountains are moving and things can have faith but let it go backwards one time and see how it works anybody can have faith when mountains are moving anybody can have faith when God is so moving through a church but what happens the Prophet says when God allows joy to be pulled back from the church every once in a while what happens to it what happens when it would be like a stream somehow that stream would would seem to kind of trickle and we have to dig a little bit what happens when the swim ever after were digging for a while that we have to depend on do because God did not just to provide one way to water the land he provided dude that was the promised to Jacob that year to do if Heaven belongs to you do the streams the fountains all of the wells all of us but sometimes there's times in our life where there's a testing that comes on what are we gonna do it's easy anybody can have faith when mountains are moving and things can have faith but let it go backwards one time and see how it works that's when you prove whether you've got faith or not now I'm not talking about your feelings I'm talking about an anchor because then your feelings in your spirit your spirit might be so so moving back and forth but within you there's something holding not you holding on he is holding you every Sun that cometh to God must be chastened and tried of God so remember our trials works patience and patience works hope and so forth so we just hold on to God whether he blesses us or not we are right there to believe him anyhow cuz he promised it we just hold on to God whether he blesses us or not are serving and our our faithfulness that I said once again that even in how that we respond even and how the in our our daily walk and even how that you know it's easy it's easy to come to church when you feel like you're on cloud nine it's easy when everything is going good it's difficult when you don't feel but seven you always feel that's what you think I don't always feel like preaching I don't always feel like taking different meetings that I'm asked and I pray about it and I actually try to move it away but then God will drop it right in I don't always feel like it and even within that but you know what within the midst of it what I can say the same as you God gives grace God gives strength to you and I hallelujah glory whether he blesses or not that's that's not what it's about it's holding on to him see this is a hope that makers not ashamed if it doesn't happen the way that maybe I thought it's going to happen I'm under the love of God it's still abroad in my heart it's an anchor that's the love of God he'll make known all those things in his time because there is one expectation that we have that I will not be ashamed of we've already received a down pile a down payment and a deposit of that we are expecting the rapture we're expecting whether we go by the way of the grave or whether we remain we are expecting complete deliverance that is a true true expectation in this condolences to the stats close family I put this I put this the link the hyperlink as below on this right here because a pastor had posted this on a collection of things I'm with and and I asked the brother I said my just you know I'm studying on some of these things where did you find this from but it's actually an in a pre mood to a message but I wasn't able to find it but I was able to pull it from this from this resource where brother ramus is ministering here he says he's speaking to the stats cliff family I hope I included this yes he said it wasn't something that Satan slipped up on you it was the planning program of God no he's talking talking specifically to brother and sister statically this is the condolences brother and sister stance cliff how can I make you see that now no more than I could when I went in the room there to play pray for a little Sharon and God refused to hear me see brother branham he's not even in the place to where that he's gonna make to be able to make them see you can't there's not things that where brother Ram himself understands he's not going to be able to make them see and understand if you can see and understand there's no need to trust but you have to trust with things you don't understand when things don't make sense you trust see that's in the midst of it all look you know how it is sometimes you can have so many many things coming around about building bridges and your this or that you find yourself if you're not careful somebody took your blood pressure if they took your pulse at that time and all of a sudden you find your some of them I said wait a minute wait wait wait wait wait well that's not up to me that's not up to me it's in his hands and you're fine right there if you could have your pulse taken at that time you find it going down why because it's a trust saying you know Lord you've got my life in your hands Oh watch this he says I couldn't understand then how that would be his program he taken a little sharing in those I couldn't understand how that would be his program right did brother branham standing loyal in the midst at that time yes he did yes he did what's his sports was his spirit affected yes it was he took the glove off and said when he was on the pair on power line I'm coming to join you is that right see the outer part was affected with that in sorrow but in Lotus he says I couldn't understand that that then how that would be his program but look now what is know what's happening but look what that little story has done it brought thousands to Christ so an experience that was there in his own life that's brought thousands to Christ what was it that brought him to Christ wasn't little sharing was it was it was it hope his wife it was the experience of a living Christ that there is an anchor there is a living God who holds you in the midst of your tests and trials let me tell you something when he was preaching to the Pentecostals the Pentecostals had already seen miracles come on somebody they had already seen that but it was an anchor it was of a living Christ remember even where that man that he hunted with Bert is that right Bert no doubt look at things what Bert had seen with in religions and and seen a lot of things had seen a lot of no doubt signs and miracles and a lot of those things we're not casting those things aside but friends let me tell you if that's where our anchor is that we are missing the mark of the high calling of Jesus Christ it is on a life that is anchored in him the Bible says signs and wonders follow them that believe I'm going to tell you one of the greatest signs and one of the greatest wonders is that transformation by the new birth and to see a life that remains solid and steadfast and looking to the coming of the Lord then no matter what comes or go sure we have our times terms are down as far as within our spirit but yet in the midst of it all there's no question you're a believer no question where you're standing and who you're in love with hallelujah we're not in love with an attribute we're in love with a person they're right you can get along with attributes of people right on your job there's people you like working with but lord have mercy don't bring him home no no but see we're not in love with an attribute of God we're in love with him and all that he is he's just not all grace he's justice he's a deliverer his judgment all those things all are wonderful attributes of God a few weeks ago brother bream says I was coming down off of a hillside where I went up one afternoon in the woods to hunt and I was setting up on the hillside thinking of the time when I was a little boy and used to squirrel hunt and I thought well things has changed a lot since then but look at the sorrow if you'd go through that would you do it again if you had to go back over your life I said yes I would first I said I don't believe I would because I'd have to go through the sorrow of seeing hope my first wife go and little Sharon and them and then something said but look at the thousands of souls that's been saved I said God yes I'd go through it again anything for your kingdom it's worth it all to be his child to serve Him through the last long mile would you go through it again if first he said no I wouldn't why the sorrow the sorrow that he had to experience but something said consider the thousands of souls that's been saved you see friends our testimonies our trials how that God is molding and shaping us but it's not just us these testimonies look it down through the Scriptures all of those down through the scriptures where they themselves you take Shadrach you take the Hebrew children just to save time you take them these are testimonies not just something that's written but if parts of the scripture for you and I to receive comfort from they didn't know they didn't have a word from God when they stood there they didn't have a word from God even as they're walking up the stairs they didn't have a word from God even when they were being thrust into the furnace but he met him there they stood faithful loyal in the midst of every time so our loyalty is not about I'm getting answers I'm getting connection I'm hearing him my prayers do not feel like they're going off of they're off the ceiling and ricocheting back that's that's not what it is our loyalty is is that he is faithful there's not one of us in here that haven't prayed and you felt like your prayers was coming right back off the ceiling there ain't one of us in here that's prayed about certain things that you felt like he ain't hearing me and there's been that test that's come to you because you don't feel maybe it's a time where here you are praying and you don't feel him you hadn't heard from him what we do in the midst of that time we trust we can go back and take comfort from the scripture when it came to Daniel and said from the first day from the first time you prayed I heard your prayer it made it to heaven it made it through everything else it made it there see let me let me just let me just drop these few things in here the scripture speaks to us here concerning of how that this trying of our faith and how that it's working patience and notice how it says here in James the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work I was so struck I'm so struck by this there's the scripture let patience so it's not just a given its let it you can be pulled many way but let patience have not his but her perfect work God chose moving by inspiration that it would display that of patience one that's timid one that would be like a a weaker vessel one that would come forth its submission in the midst of these times that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing you know brother branham he tells us when we're looking at that in the statue of a perfect man we understand that we must be born of the incorruptible Word of God we are born we are born of the gospel of our salvation birthed into that part that God has ordained for our life but in that growing of our life it all starts from a new birth but then we grow into a full stature of a son and daughter of God we're not born in full stature we grow unto all that is within us every part and remember thinking how that all of this together every leaf every apple every stem everything that will be on that apple tree every bushel of apples all of it is representative represented in that germ of life in the seed the only thing that has to happen is is the quickening power comes up on it to give it the authority to become what God has spoken and so we see that how that if faith work if the scripture said faith worketh patience but M says if you've got faith then you'll of patience you see it works out in our left do is it is it something to where that we come to a place and all of a sudden well I'm done with patience here today and you know after patients know its continuum it's not it's not that way of thinking that well because what you're gonna find yourself doing when just looking at that you'll find yourself up and down up and down up it's not that it's a maturing and God brings forth all of the fullness of the virtue according to the light that's given in the hour and season of his word yet God is faithful to perform his word so here when we look at this and and I'm watching the time I've got just a few more moments here let me read this to you out of the flat tire of church age it's very it was very very beautiful here here here we find in this age it seems how that God is the onlooker he knows what's going on you sees everything when Robert libram says to the untutored mind they they can't understand how that when his people are in trouble how that we're in there in this condition how can he not just give in and lavish everything upon them see that would be the thought but if that can but but that's not God's Way of bringing forth out of our life you believe he's working notice brother M says in a fat tire age he said now faithfulness and patience go together in fact patience is the outcome of faithfulness for it says in James 1 3 the trying of your faith worketh patience there is absolutely no other way in which to gain patience it has to come by the trial of our faith Lord I need patience so interpreting that is lord I need trials right but we probably don't say you know lord I need patience but I will be I believe every one of us I believe that we can say lord help me to wait because we see even within ourselves on certain things where we've hasty it helped me to wait Lord you know friends even even when God is working and sometimes here we are we can build all kinds of bridges I know I'm not just preaching to me tonight we can have all this but then as it comes that place we realized wait a minute what am i doing and you know what you've built a bridge and yeah you come to a place and it was not even necessary all it was was us getting under the plate you know what that is that steal us and God is still letting us know the stream of life got to dry up he had to let he had to let Abraham get completely dead all right and God knows what he's doing in working in our lives there is absolutely no other way in which to gain patience it has to come by the trial of our faith so you mean I can't gain patience just by coming and listening to the word no you mean I can't gain patience just by praying no you mean I can't get patience just by reading and study no patience can only come by the trial patients experience experience well where the RAM refers that scripture Romans 5 tribulation worketh patience how highly God regards this out working of our patience that's a powerful statement how highly God regards this out working of our patience and it refers to James 1:4 and that patients have our perfect work that you may be perfect and entire lacking nothing God's will for us is perfection and that perfection is patience waiting on God and waiting for God that's the perfection that the molding of our character this is the process of character development when you think of this waiting this is God's desire for perfection is this patience waiting on God waiting for God remember the message is brother read and preached trial court trial a trial d trial to me where I as I'm listening to those message I think what how God so profoundly took us in this hour to come out and to address these things of mr. skeptic mr. impatient all these are the things and you know what God allowed even in Abraham's life God allowed the promise it was the promise was as sure as when God had it in his mind that promise was was sure but God allowed all of those things allowed the time to go on but in the midst of it all it was a trying it was a testing into the midst of it Abraham his patience grew it grew it grew to such a place - here he takes Isaac one who was given to him from the dead and he walks him up to that mountain I tell you friends that right there what God God already knew what he was going to bring him to to show him that but God didn't require that at the first this is a maturity of his face and God and God brings our faith there's a maturity of our faith even how the Prophet himself how that he continues to put that example of Isaac and Abraham going up to the mountain over and over in the message of Shalom he ties it into that of the rapture he ties it in the patriarch Abraham he says for what God has done within your soul you have confidence that he'll also transform your body and he goes on to tell us even in the wings of a snow white dove he says here he is standing on the mountain that day and he speaks of God revealing his word and he says this revelation has led me to a faith I never had before so here it was a growing in his life so huh well as faith is growing what else is growing patients as patients is growing what else a grunt experience and hope all of that it grows stronger and stronger and stronger you loved him tonight say lord help me keep working Lord in me let me help me Lord I want to be found patient even when I have been and when I am disappointed when things don't go the way that I would want them to go every one of us every one of us in here we always want the pastor path of least resistance that's true we want that but God knows God knows what path to lead us in because he knows what he's bringing out of our lives it's all working what the world might look at different ones on the job and say oh my goodness how I know but you don't know what people are watching in your life they may never read a Bible they may not they even may even proclaim they don't believe in the Lord at all but they watched the inker in your life and they say that's a Christian that's a Christian here they are in the midst of all that that is going through but there is something that within them it holds there's an anchor what a greater witness and a greater testimony he's faithful the anchor points aren't you glad the anchor holds in the midst of the storm let's pray Heavenly Father Lord as we come here Lord to the end of this or the little time that we've had together I pray that Lord that you'll just take your word just the Lord's speak Lord continually to our heart father ministering to each life in each heart what's what's needed what's necessary more dear God how we think you Father for each each prayer Lord every answer Lord even that when it's been known when it's been Lord not according to how that we were even praying for something Lord to take place the Lord were thankful the Lord God to know that there is a greater within a slore that holds us the father that even in the midst of the time if our own thinking attitude or any part would get out of line we're thankful for the love of God that shed abroad in a heart supply to directing us Lord right back in bringing us right in line father we see it dear God Lord we mentioned of it last week Lord and looking at it you did it with Joe Lord as your prophet told us Lord he got to a place Lord it was a little bit of a of an attitude Lord and things that Joel was having but you directed Lord you moved upon the scene and you brought forth truly truly out of that trial as job spoke in the beginning he said I shall come forth purest gold everything Lord it did not happen the way that he thought it would happen but father in it all that hope was not ashamed Lord the stats quest this example that we read tonight here this living experience of your God someday I believe by your grace will stand there Lord with that brother and sister what they themselves the Lord were not able to understand Lord at that very moment brother Branham was able to relate to them that at when he was at that particular moment in his time he didn't understand that it didn't make sense and there's no way that that he could try to make sense to them of their situation but he relayed to them the experience of what had taken place where lives had come Souls had come to Jesus Christ Lord Jesus what oh what a tremendous thing you're molding us you're shaping us you're preparing Lord our character because the character is what we will take with us play a character that is made in the fiery furnace suffering and trials help us help us Lord God to be sensitive and to be healed help us Lord to be submissive to you Lord that in the midst of these times when we don't understand you
