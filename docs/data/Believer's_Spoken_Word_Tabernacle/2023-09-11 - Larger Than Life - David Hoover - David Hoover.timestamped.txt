[37:00] our lives are a testimony of just how
[37:03] great he is
[37:05] you know when we think back to what
[37:08] Adam and what they had in the Garden of
[37:11] Eden or Adam could speak to the storm
[37:13] could move the tree
[37:15] and all of those things had to do with
[37:18] what was the best position if you we
[37:21] think about it it had nothing to do with
[37:23] when Adam spoke that this tree be
[37:25] plucked up and moved over here it had
[37:27] nothing to do with being agitated being
[37:30] bothered being frustrated because sin
[37:32] hadn't entered yet
[37:34] so it brings us back into that place
[37:36] threw him by the blood of Jesus Christ
[37:39] where the Holy Spirit comes to bring
[37:41] that rest in our life that the things
[37:43] that we speak to and situations in our
[37:46] life are not out of frustration because
[37:49] God won't hear that it's not out of
[37:51] anxiousness it's recognizing this is a
[37:56] need
[37:56] and it's a hindrance to him
[38:00] and that's what our lives are here for
[38:02] it's for him that's our whole purpose is
[38:05] for him
[38:06] so just as the same God that provided
[38:08] the RAM on the mountain there was a need
[38:11] the same God that brought forth
[38:13] squirrels in this hour it was for a need
[38:15] and it's the same way in our lives even
[38:18] here this morning even as the words
[38:21] going forth the word is being spoken
[38:23] over our life and then our hearts in
[38:25] agreement with that word it just takes
[38:27] that voice that's coming forth and then
[38:30] as we amen and it echoes it so be it
[38:33] Lord and we're speaking not out of
[38:35] frustration we're speaking out of in
[38:38] Harmony and unity with the mind of
[38:40] Christ and the same God that brought
[38:42] squirrels where there was actually
[38:45] impossible for squirrels to come out of
[38:47] these things
[38:48] I think Alberta Ram said that he said
[38:50] I'll call for this he said I'll make
[38:52] this so radical in the sense that
[38:54] squirrels don't come out of this
[38:56] particular bush
[38:57] you know to me as I've said this is more
[39:00] than squirrels what I look at that is
[39:02] how many would right off and did write
[39:05] off my life right off your life and say
[39:08] a Son of God coming out of hair a
[39:11] daughter of God coming out of there but
[39:13] God made a testimony in this hour that
[39:15] the word when it goes forth the word
[39:17] will bring forth after its own kind
[39:21] amen and I'm I'm glad to be a witness of
[39:23] that aren't you and then just so
[39:25] appreciated amen the songs this morning
[39:27] the special I believe God has something
[39:30] special for us amen and so we just want
[39:34] to turn our attention here in just a
[39:35] moment to the word I want to remind you
[39:38] this coming week the Lord willing this
[39:40] coming Thursday evening brother Daryl
[39:41] Ward will be here ministering for us at
[39:44] that time and so we just want to come
[39:46] expecting
[39:48] a man and just looking through What the
[39:50] Lord Has for us there and also want to
[39:53] continue to remember it wasn't wrote as
[39:56] a prayer request but brother Joshua you
[39:58] haven't seen him here a few Services
[39:59] brother Joshua he had to have surgery
[40:01] last week to remove uh the um the way
[40:06] they calls them the nails that were put
[40:08] in there to cause that leg to grow where
[40:10] the bone would form around it then they
[40:12] had to go back in and remove that
[40:13] because everything is right where it
[40:15] needs to be so he's doing really well a
[40:18] little bit of pain there in the hip from
[40:20] where they had to go in right there but
[40:22] he's doing well with that so we want to
[40:24] continue to remember our brother in
[40:26] prayer also for sister Sharon his wife
[40:30] that God God will just make a way I told
[40:33] her I told him this I said look I look
[40:36] forward to the text every text that you
[40:38] send me I look forward to either the
[40:41] text or the phone call that it's she's
[40:44] passed
[40:45] and I I said you know to me I know what
[40:48] they've said in regarding immigration
[40:49] over there I said but when brother Benny
[40:52] Perry was here in that January before in
[40:54] the middle of his service I said a
[40:56] testimony was given for a similar
[40:58] situation and how God moved those papers
[41:00] forward
[41:02] God is still God
[41:04] you know sometimes in our Humanity we
[41:06] can become very frustrated with the
[41:09] things that we see around us but only
[41:12] remember that's a test and we have to go
[41:14] through that you were never going to get
[41:16] to a spot to where all the a feeling of
[41:18] frustration doesn't come but remember
[41:20] overcoming is recognizing the devil at
[41:24] every one of his tricks
[41:25] and then recognizing that God in you is
[41:28] greater and has already overcome that
[41:30] thing
[41:31] I think we all could fellowship and say
[41:33] God help me to recognize that part more
[41:35] in the simple everyday moments of our
[41:38] lives so we want to continue to remember
[41:40] that in prayer uh also this evening Lord
[41:43] willing the fire pit Fellowship here at
[41:45] about 6 PM we'll start that and uh
[41:49] if you could just make sure you bring
[41:51] your chairs to set in and also any
[41:54] non-perishable food or items and if you
[41:58] need help on what to bring I can tell
[42:00] you Sunday is a special day for me not
[42:03] only do I get to go to the house of the
[42:04] Lord but special day where I eat special
[42:06] things sometimes so if you need any help
[42:09] with that I'd be happy if you don't feel
[42:11] led in a certain way let me lead you and
[42:14] what to bring
[42:15] but we we just so enjoy being able to
[42:18] get together and fellowship and I think
[42:20] it's a privilege to be able to have
[42:21] Brother David and sister Jeannie Hoover
[42:23] here with us it's first time for them
[42:25] being with us
[42:28] but um
[42:30] his brother David makes his way forward
[42:32] Brother David is just he and sister
[42:35] Genie had just become good friends
[42:37] to us here over the few years that we
[42:40] have actually been to know one another
[42:42] and I just so I just so loved them
[42:44] dearly and I'm glad that brother Hoover
[42:46] has taken time out of the vacation and
[42:49] the time when he heard he was coming I
[42:51] said you're not going to sit yeah I want
[42:53] you to minister and so we just want to
[42:56] pull on the gift of God some of this
[42:58] maybe brother Hoover will share but
[43:00] brother Hoover's grandmother was the
[43:03] nanny that brother Brandon brought into
[43:05] the home to care for the home
[43:07] and I thought I don't want to steal his
[43:10] Thunder because he has a ton of
[43:12] testimonies and stories so maybe tonight
[43:14] if they're able to be at the fire pit I
[43:16] mean there's so much that that many
[43:18] different testimonies are just wonderful
[43:20] to go into but I thought it was
[43:21] tremendous how when brother when brother
[43:24] Branham took his grandmother around and
[43:27] showed her as brother Hoover related it
[43:29] he pointed out to her the different
[43:31] duties within the home and then what
[43:33] would be done and then he took her and
[43:35] he showed her he said you see that post
[43:37] out there in the yard out there in the
[43:39] back and she said yes he said
[43:41] don't ever let the children go near that
[43:43] he said because I made a promise to
[43:46] those Hornets I'd never disturb him
[43:48] again
[43:50] it's pretty powerful isn't it
[43:52] I made a promise to those Hornets I'd
[43:55] never disturb them again
[43:57] I tell you God is God isn't he
[44:00] he's a living God that's that's what
[44:02] this message brought to you and I it
[44:04] lifted God out of History
[44:07] and brought God to a present tense God
[44:11] in our lives a god a word that we can
[44:15] handle a word that we can touch a word
[44:17] that lives inside of us I'm glad about
[44:20] that aren't you so I told Brother David
[44:22] all along I said look we're we're family
[44:24] you're at home and
[44:27] just I said we just we're simple people
[44:29] we just love the Lord we love the word
[44:30] just just preach however God leads you
[44:33] testimonies he wants to share but I tell
[44:35] you I love Brother David and so
[44:37] appreciate him and I know we're going to
[44:39] be blessed this morning amen do you love
[44:41] the Lord

[46:39] just so happy to be here this morning
[46:40] thank you musicians
[46:45] well
[46:48] I was telling brother Samuel back in the
[46:50] office
[46:53] I
[46:55] don't know where when I've ever walked
[46:57] into a place and just felt like I was at
[47:00] home
[47:02] and I've never been here but we have
[47:04] been together before
[47:06] [Applause]
[47:07] so you're not strangers to me
[47:11] and uh
[47:15] I
[47:19] am not supposed to joke in the Pulpit
[47:20] but I just want to share this with you
[47:23] um
[47:24] you know what folks from I live in
[47:26] Indiana now I'm originally from
[47:28] Elizabethtown Kentucky but I live in
[47:29] Indiana now and you know what folks from
[47:32] Indiana and Ohio call people from
[47:34] Kentucky and West Virginia right
[47:36] Mom and Dad Grandma and Grandpa
[47:40] because we all have Roots there's a
[47:42] little bit of hillbilly in us
[47:43] that's probably why I feel at home I'm
[47:46] you know not insulting you I don't mean
[47:48] it that way but I just feel at home
[47:50] there's there's places that you go
[47:53] you know yeah I've walked into houses
[47:54] and they've told me to take my shoes off
[47:56] before
[47:57] okay I've walked into places and they
[48:00] suggested that I take my shoes off
[48:03] but I just feel like I'm in one of those
[48:06] places this morning where I can just
[48:07] kick my shoes off and I can be at home
[48:10] and uh
[48:11] y'all will understand
[48:17] and I want to uh
[48:19] I want to say thanks to brother Paul
[48:22] this morning for this atmosphere that
[48:24] has been created
[48:26] uh it's amazing to
[48:29] to watch this young man and he was down
[48:31] at our place last weekend and I'm
[48:34] standing at the back of the of the
[48:36] sanctuary with one of the other deacons
[48:38] and he's up there singing a song
[48:41] and uh
[48:43] power of the Holy Spirit fell and I just
[48:46] looked over it at uh
[48:49] the other Deacon that was standing there
[48:51] next to me and I said have you ever seen
[48:53] anybody
[48:54] that was doing exactly what they were
[48:57] supposed to do
[48:59] and that's just how I feel about your
[49:01] brother Paul
[49:02] he's been in my dorm at camp
[49:05] and he survived that
[49:09] and uh
[49:12] I've had him and his brother in my
[49:14] dormant camp and I survived that
[49:16] so uh
[49:19] we're uh we're just happy to be here I'm
[49:22] just getting I'm just getting settled
[49:24] just give me give me a little bit of
[49:26] time here I bring ingredients from
[49:28] brother Nathan and the Saints back home
[49:31] sister Rebecca and all of their family
[49:33] and
[49:36] if we could
[49:39] well we we just like to make the
[49:41] brownings part of our congregation in
[49:43] New Albany
[49:44] that's uh probably not going to happen
[49:47] but
[49:49] when they when they come come to see us
[49:52] it's just we just
[49:55] like we've been acquainted all of our
[49:57] life I do have to share this with you
[49:59] before we go to the word
[50:03] a few years ago at camp I I used to go
[50:07] to the camp in Ohio
[50:08] uh year after year after year
[50:11] and I took a break
[50:13] and during that break they moved from
[50:15] Ohio to Indiana
[50:17] and I had not been to the Indiana camp
[50:19] for probably the first five years that
[50:22] they had it in Indiana so I showed up
[50:24] one year Lord laid it on my heart said
[50:27] you need to be back at Camp I said Lord
[50:28] I'm too old
[50:29] these kids can't relate to me I'm an old
[50:31] guy and they're not going to understand
[50:33] me they're going to laugh at me and all
[50:35] that he said you need to go so I went
[50:38] and so I'm sitting there in the
[50:40] sanctuary that morning and they said
[50:42] we're going to have brother Samuel
[50:43] Browning preach and uh
[50:46] you know I didn't know brother Samuel
[50:48] Browning from anybody you know and I'm
[50:50] looking around trying to figure out
[50:51] which one he was and
[50:53] finally he came in the back door and and
[50:56] uh
[50:57] I think I helped him with some water or
[50:59] a man or a cough drop or something and
[51:01] uh
[51:03] he got up there to preach and I did what
[51:04] you all are doing to me right now you're
[51:06] like who is this guy and where is he
[51:08] from and what's he all about and
[51:10] everything
[51:12] and so uh
[51:14] he took his text and he began to preach
[51:17] and uh
[51:20] after after church I text brother Nathan
[51:23] and I said
[51:25] you need to have Samuel Browning come
[51:27] preach for us
[51:28] and he said who is Samuel Browning I
[51:31] said you don't have to worry about who
[51:33] he is you just need to have him come
[51:34] preach for us
[51:36] and so the next year at Camp he and
[51:38] brother Nathan got to meet each other
[51:39] and uh
[51:41] it's history I also walked out of that
[51:44] same service I was telling him this last
[51:46] night I walked out of that same service
[51:48] and I
[51:49] always call Sister Genie every night
[51:51] after I get the young men settled down
[51:53] and everybody is
[51:55] prove that they're going to be quiet for
[51:56] the rest of the night
[51:58] and I always go outside and text her and
[52:01] or call her rather
[52:03] and uh
[52:05] we talk
[52:06] and so I went outside that night and I
[52:09] said
[52:10] man you should have been here brother
[52:12] Samuel Browning preached and she said
[52:15] who is Samuel Browning I said
[52:18] I can tell you this he's laid before the
[52:21] Lord
[52:22] he's been with Jesus
[52:25] and I don't know if it was the first
[52:27] time that he ever preached but it was
[52:29] one of the first few times
[52:31] I'm sitting there and you know at Camp
[52:33] whenever you're up to a one two o'clock
[52:36] in the morning handling the preacher's
[52:38] kids that you have in your dorm
[52:41] I'm a preacher's kid so I can speak
[52:44] uh
[52:46] sometimes
[52:48] when it gets real nice and quiet in the
[52:50] sanctuary you know you your your mind
[52:53] goes somewhere and so my mind had
[52:56] drifted just a little bit
[52:58] and all of a sudden I heard a man say
[53:04] Elijah was the canvas
[53:07] that God used to paint Elisha a picture
[53:11] of what he looked like
[53:16] folks I can't tell you how that
[53:18] thundered in my soul
[53:20] I come up out of my seat and I'm like
[53:22] wow
[53:26] and ever since then brother Samuel's
[53:29] been one of my favorite preachers
[53:31] he's he's he's probably the favorite but
[53:35] he's definitely in the top three and so
[53:38] to me
[53:40] I stand back there listening to him and
[53:42] I think he got a hold of my notes
[53:44] but
[53:46] I I would like this morning just to tag
[53:49] him and say you're it and let me sit
[53:51] down here and listen but he wouldn't
[53:53] hear to that
[53:55] uh I had determined I was going to sneak
[53:58] in after service started this morning
[54:00] we're supposed to be on vacation and I
[54:02] promised my wife one of the few times in
[54:04] our life that we're going to take a
[54:06] vacation and it doesn't involve
[54:08] preaching
[54:10] because she has seen quite a bit of the
[54:12] United States but it's always been we're
[54:15] on our way to go somewhere and preach
[54:16] and and then we have to get back home
[54:19] for work so we Have No Agenda we have
[54:22] nothing planned after
[54:24] right now
[54:25] and so I was just going to sneak in this
[54:28] morning and brother Samuel was going to
[54:30] be up here taking his text and I was
[54:32] just going to sit back there and enjoy
[54:34] but I started to go to a Brother's
[54:37] church one time and found out that I
[54:39] didn't know the time of the service and
[54:41] I would have showed up and no one would
[54:42] have been there so I thought I'm not
[54:43] going to do that so I asked him the
[54:45] other weekend whenever he was down I
[54:47] said Windows your services and uh
[54:51] being a pastor he picked up on it and he
[54:53] goes when are you coming by
[54:56] I said well I don't know for sure yet he
[54:58] goes well be ready to preach when you
[55:00] come by so
[55:02] anyway aren't you happy in the Lord this
[55:05] morning
[55:07] [Applause]
[55:11] if you'd like to stand with us and turn
[55:13] in your Bibles to Psalms the 34th
[55:14] chapter
[55:16] we'll read a portion of scripture there
[55:26] just good to be in the presence of the
[55:27] Lord
[55:30] to realize that
[55:32] he has already kept his word because he
[55:34] said if we would gather together in his
[55:36] name he would be here
[55:38] and he's definitely here
[55:41] Psalms the 34th chapter very familiar
[55:44] portion of scripture
[55:46] I
[55:50] the adversary was bugging me this
[55:52] morning and telling me that
[55:54] I should went down another path with
[55:57] what the Lord laid on my heart and
[55:59] things and
[56:01] so we're on our way to church and sister
[56:03] Genie starts singing
[56:05] the song that's out of this scripture
[56:07] right here she had she asked me I I
[56:10] don't ever tell her
[56:12] what I'm going to preach on I did give
[56:14] her the title this morning but I didn't
[56:16] tell her any of the background
[56:17] and she started singing out of this
[56:19] Psalm right here
[56:21] and I just said okay devil what about
[56:23] that
[56:25] what about that and then
[56:27] then the sister got up here and sang the
[56:29] special and
[56:30] I'm like okay Lord that's two
[56:33] and then brother Samuel gets a prayer
[56:35] okay Lord there's three Witnesses so
[56:37] I believe that we're in the right
[56:39] channel this morning
[56:42] Psalms 34 says I will bless the Lord at
[56:45] all times his praise shall continually
[56:48] be in my mouth
[56:49] my soul shall make her boast in the Lord
[56:52] The Humble shall hear thereof and be
[56:54] glad
[56:55] o magnify the Lord with me and let us
[56:58] exalt his name together
[57:00] I sought the Lord and he heard me and
[57:03] delivered me from all my fears
[57:07] they looked unto him and were lightened
[57:09] and their faces were not ashamed this
[57:12] poor man cried and the Lord heard him
[57:15] and saved him out of all his troubles
[57:21] let's bow our heads and our hearts to
[57:23] him
[57:24] Lord Jesus
[57:26] we have come into your house this
[57:29] morning Lord and there's one thought on
[57:31] our mind
[57:33] and that's to lift you up and to exalt
[57:35] you
[57:36] Heavenly Father
[57:38] there's no way that we can over exalt
[57:40] you there's no way that we can over
[57:42] emphasize
[57:44] what you've done in our lives
[57:47] but Lord
[57:48] your Prophet told us if we had nothing
[57:50] else to say just tell them how your
[57:52] candle got lit
[57:55] Lord I've watched that around the world
[57:58] every single time
[58:01] that you tell somebody how your candle
[58:03] got that
[58:04] you have an effect in their lives
[58:07] so we're coming this morning Lord
[58:10] not to talk about David Hoover not to
[58:12] talk about brother Branham
[58:14] but to talk about the God that's in
[58:16] David Hoover and the god that's in
[58:18] William Branham
[58:20] and Lord we believe that if we exalt you
[58:22] and if we lift you up if we magnify you
[58:25] that you'll be pleased I just asked now
[58:28] Lord you would take these words that's
[58:29] going to come from my lips
[58:31] Lord that you would just settle them in
[58:33] the hearts of the people
[58:35] you took a stone one day Lord from
[58:37] David's sling and you magnified it
[58:43] you took control of that stone Lord and
[58:46] you killed a giant with it
[58:47] Lord these words that I'm going to say
[58:50] I ask that you would take them even if I
[58:53] stumble around with them and I don't get
[58:55] them all right Lord that you'll take
[58:57] them and settle them in the hearts of
[58:58] the Believers and you'll feed them Lord
[59:01] and whenever we walk from this place
[59:02] Lord we'll be richer we'll be more
[59:05] blessed we'll be closer to you than we
[59:07] were when we walked in
[59:09] because we didn't come to see what
[59:11] anybody was going to wear we didn't come
[59:12] to see how good somebody could preach or
[59:14] how good somebody could sing we came for
[59:17] one purpose Lord we came to lift you up
[59:20] and Lord that's what we want to do when
[59:22] we leave now you have your way in the
[59:24] hearts and the lives of people this
[59:26] morning and we'll give you praise and
[59:28] glory in Jesus name
[59:29] amen
[59:31] God bless you you may be seated
[59:35] just like to concentrate on the third
[59:37] verse
[59:39] for a few moments this morning and if
[59:41] you'll excuse me
[59:50] in the third verse the Bible says David
[59:54] says through the inspiration o magnify
[59:57] the Lord with me
[59:58] and let us exalt his name together
[1:00:04] if you look up the definition of magnify
[1:00:07] this morning
[1:00:08] you'll find according to Merriam-Webster
[1:00:11] dictionary that it says to extol
[1:00:13] to laud
[1:00:15] to cause to be helped in Greater esteem
[1:00:18] or respect
[1:00:20] to increase in significance
[1:00:24] to enlarge in fact
[1:00:26] or appearance
[1:00:31] to cause to be held in Greater esteem or
[1:00:34] respect
[1:00:36] to increase in significance
[1:00:38] to enlarge in fact or appearance
[1:00:42] brother Branham says an attempt meeting
[1:00:43] in Cleveland Ohio in 1950 a message
[1:00:46] called it shall be even as it was told
[1:00:48] me
[1:00:50] he's praying before he speaks and he
[1:00:53] says may signs and wonders be done
[1:00:55] tonight to Magnify Him
[1:00:58] who we love
[1:01:00] for we ask it in his name amen
[1:01:04] in Jonesboro Arkansas in 1953
[1:01:08] on a message called we have found him
[1:01:10] come and see
[1:01:11] now we've gathered here tonight for no
[1:01:14] other purpose but to magnify thee and to
[1:01:18] get Sinners to seek thee and call upon
[1:01:21] thee while they can that perhaps you may
[1:01:25] have mercy upon them to save them from
[1:01:27] sin
[1:01:28] that's our first motive
[1:01:30] now for those of you that are like me in
[1:01:33] the congregation that's the end of the
[1:01:34] quote but I'm going to tell you his
[1:01:36] second motive was the healing service
[1:01:38] that was getting ready to happen because
[1:01:40] I would be sitting there wondering well
[1:01:41] that was his first motive what's the
[1:01:43] second you know so I just answered that
[1:01:45] for you but to think that the prophet of
[1:01:48] God stood in Jonesboro Arkansas and if
[1:01:51] I'm not mistaken Jonesboro is the place
[1:01:54] I believe it was prior to 53 but
[1:01:56] Jonesborough is the place where he said
[1:01:59] now we're going to pray for every sick
[1:02:02] person here
[1:02:04] we're not going to leave the platform
[1:02:06] until everybody is prayed for and he
[1:02:09] took his meals on the platform and he
[1:02:11] took a nap on the platform and he got
[1:02:14] back up and continued the prayer line
[1:02:17] but to think that a human being stood
[1:02:19] and said we're not going to stop until
[1:02:22] every person is prayed for now he did
[1:02:25] learn a lesson through that but just to
[1:02:27] think eight days on the platform they
[1:02:29] say
[1:02:32] eight days
[1:02:39] and he prayed
[1:02:40] until they were all prayed for
[1:02:44] because there was a burden on his heart
[1:02:47] but yet in prayer line after prayer line
[1:02:51] someone would come up and he'd say
[1:02:55] now I see
[1:02:57] I see that you're not a Christian
[1:03:00] if the Lord would touch you
[1:03:02] 'd want to serve him wouldn't you
[1:03:04] because his first motive was that Soul
[1:03:07] amen
[1:03:09] because even the little boy in Finland I
[1:03:11] was listening to the testimony about the
[1:03:12] little boy in Finland that was raised
[1:03:14] from the dead
[1:03:15] that little boy in Finland I don't know
[1:03:18] but he he's probably passed away by now
[1:03:21] or he will someday
[1:03:23] okay but the soul that's eternal
[1:03:27] and that's our concern this morning
[1:03:28] that's why we're here this morning is to
[1:03:30] talk to you about your soul I'd like to
[1:03:32] just title this for the next few moments
[1:03:34] Larger than Life
[1:03:38] Larger than Life and my purpose this
[1:03:41] morning is not to impress you I did not
[1:03:43] come to impress you I did not come to
[1:03:45] entertain you you may laugh at some of
[1:03:48] the things I share with you you may you
[1:03:50] may think well you know we heard a lot
[1:03:52] about brother Hoover this morning I I
[1:03:54] hope that's not the case you'll hear
[1:03:56] something about my my grandmother you'll
[1:03:58] hear things about brother Branham
[1:04:00] but we're not here to lift up myself my
[1:04:03] grandmother brother Branham we're here
[1:04:06] to lift up the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04:10] and the reason that it's important that
[1:04:12] you understand that
[1:04:14] is because we have a tendency we put
[1:04:17] brother Branham on a pedestal up here
[1:04:20] okay and he does he he did have a very
[1:04:23] high office
[1:04:24] okay but he's not our savior
[1:04:27] okay he didn't die for you
[1:04:30] the the blood of brother Branham will
[1:04:33] not cleanse you and free you from sin
[1:04:37] okay but he came to magnify God used him
[1:04:41] as a magnifying glass
[1:04:43] so that you could look through his life
[1:04:45] and you could look through testimonies
[1:04:47] about his life and you could see Jesus
[1:04:49] in a clear and a bigger way
[1:04:53] because we cannot make Jesus big enough
[1:04:57] we don't have the words to describe it
[1:04:59] we don't have the vocabulary to say how
[1:05:03] big my God is
[1:05:04] okay but if I can share a little a
[1:05:07] little something about what he did in my
[1:05:09] life then you can be sitting there going
[1:05:12] through a trial going through a test
[1:05:13] going through I don't have any idea what
[1:05:15] you're going through okay you all look
[1:05:18] like Saints to me you look like
[1:05:19] everybody here is ready for the Rapture
[1:05:21] and we could just go right now
[1:05:24] but also know from experience
[1:05:27] that there's some there's some people
[1:05:30] facing some things
[1:05:31] you have some mountains in your life
[1:05:34] and I'm here to tell you I serve a God
[1:05:36] that moves mountains
[1:05:38] [Applause]
[1:05:39] I serve a God who heals diseases I serve
[1:05:43] a God who is still the very same Jesus
[1:05:46] that he was when he walked to shores of
[1:05:48] Galilee
[1:05:50] but as I was testifying to brother
[1:05:52] Samuel last night the the the service
[1:05:54] where the Lord filled me with the Holy
[1:05:56] Ghost the title of the message was a
[1:05:58] present tense Jesus and brother brother
[1:06:01] Ed Hunter a senior who was preaching
[1:06:03] brought it out that I didn't need a
[1:06:06] Jesus in a manger at that particular
[1:06:08] moment
[1:06:09] I didn't need a Jesus walk in the shores
[1:06:11] of Galilee at that particular time I
[1:06:14] didn't need even a Jesus that was
[1:06:15] hanging on the cross at that particular
[1:06:17] time what I was in need of that morning
[1:06:19] and what you might be in need of this
[1:06:21] morning is you need a Jesus that's
[1:06:23] present tense in your life in your soul
[1:06:27] right now
[1:06:29] and Jesus does not have a body on this
[1:06:33] Earth at the present moment
[1:06:35] as far as a physical Corporal body
[1:06:38] he doesn't have any hands he doesn't
[1:06:40] have any feet on this earth right now in
[1:06:43] a body like he had on the shores of
[1:06:44] Galilee but he does have a set of hands
[1:06:47] right here in this young man
[1:06:49] he's got feet right here in this brother
[1:06:51] right here and whenever you get up and
[1:06:53] you go visit someone in a hospital or
[1:06:55] someone in a in a assisted living
[1:06:58] facility or whenever you get up and you
[1:07:00] go to Walmart or you go to Meyer or
[1:07:02] wherever you go whenever you go to
[1:07:04] school
[1:07:04] Jesus is walking in your shoes Jesus is
[1:07:08] speaking through your lips
[1:07:11] you just have to yield to him
[1:07:14] we have our ideas we have our our our
[1:07:17] our goals and our ambitions
[1:07:21] but that Hall has to be laid aside now
[1:07:24] I'm not telling you not to have goals
[1:07:26] I'm not telling you not to have hopes
[1:07:27] and dreams I'm just telling you to make
[1:07:29] sure that your hopes and your dreams and
[1:07:31] your goals and your agenda and whatever
[1:07:33] it is that you're wanting to achieve in
[1:07:35] life I want I want you to make sure it
[1:07:38] lines up with God's word because if it's
[1:07:40] opposite of God's word it's not gonna
[1:07:42] it's not gonna progress
[1:07:45] but if it's lined up with the word of
[1:07:47] God Supernatural things will happen
[1:07:50] through you
[1:07:52] you say I'm not a preacher you don't
[1:07:54] have to be a preacher brother Branham
[1:07:57] said the housewife
[1:07:59] the housewife can be used of God to
[1:08:02] minister
[1:08:03] and I've seen that happen
[1:08:05] the factory worker can be used of God to
[1:08:08] minister
[1:08:09] you may never walk onto the factory
[1:08:11] floor with a Bible in your hand and to
[1:08:14] stand there and take a text and begin to
[1:08:16] minister but that life
[1:08:19] one of the I'm off my notes but this is
[1:08:22] where he's going so I'm going with him
[1:08:24] all right
[1:08:26] one of these days
[1:08:28] when we're standing there
[1:08:30] at the final judgment
[1:08:32] and people in Ohio say Lord I never
[1:08:36] heard nobody ever told me I never went
[1:08:39] to church
[1:08:40] you have to exempt me he's going to pick
[1:08:43] out one of you all maybe one of these
[1:08:45] young people that's in school maybe one
[1:08:47] of you folks that that go to work every
[1:08:50] day
[1:08:51] and he's going to say would you come
[1:08:52] here
[1:08:54] did you ever see this lady right here
[1:08:56] walking to Walmart
[1:08:58] did you ever bump into her when you were
[1:09:01] getting your groceries
[1:09:03] did you ever wonder why she had that
[1:09:04] dress on did you ever wonder why she
[1:09:06] didn't have her hair cut
[1:09:09] did you ever wonder why that man never
[1:09:11] told a dirty joke
[1:09:12] anytime you were around him
[1:09:15] did you ever wonder why your neighbor
[1:09:17] disappeared every Sunday morning
[1:09:22] and was gone for two or three hours
[1:09:25] well yeah I knew there was something
[1:09:26] different about him that was my witness
[1:09:30] that was my testimony to you to Leo to
[1:09:33] see you that was my testimony
[1:09:36] that there was a real God
[1:09:40] amen
[1:09:41] all right let me see if I can get back
[1:09:43] here
[1:09:44] so brother Branham tells us he said you
[1:09:48] need to find yourself a character in the
[1:09:49] Bible
[1:09:51] and you need to you need to model
[1:09:54] yourself or or pattern your life like
[1:09:57] that that person did so I have two
[1:10:00] characters that I love to preach about
[1:10:03] one is David
[1:10:05] for obvious reasons
[1:10:10] my mom got to name all the girls there
[1:10:12] was three girls before I was born she
[1:10:14] got to name all the girls dad got to
[1:10:15] name me and so he named me David Paul
[1:10:19] and David has always been somebody
[1:10:21] special to me but I just want to look at
[1:10:23] it this morning maybe you haven't ever
[1:10:25] looked at it in this way
[1:10:26] but David
[1:10:29] the Bible says he was a ready fellow
[1:10:31] brother Branham said you know he he
[1:10:33] wasn't really much to look at
[1:10:36] I know they have sculptors of him and
[1:10:38] things like that but he
[1:10:40] he wasn't uh
[1:10:45] he wasn't a a model of a man okay
[1:10:49] he's a little runt
[1:10:53] his daddy didn't even think he was worth
[1:10:55] bringing to the to the uh
[1:10:58] to the anointing ceremony for King
[1:11:05] nobody looked at him and said now
[1:11:07] there's the Future King they looked at
[1:11:09] Saul and they said now that that's a
[1:11:11] king but they didn't look that way at
[1:11:13] David
[1:11:14] but God did
[1:11:16] so David had heard about Jehovah all of
[1:11:19] his life he was raised in the right
[1:11:21] atmosphere he was raised in a home where
[1:11:23] Jehovah was talked about he'd been
[1:11:25] taught about Jehovah
[1:11:27] okay
[1:11:28] and one day he was out there tending the
[1:11:31] Sheep
[1:11:32] minded his own business
[1:11:34] okay probably staying away from his
[1:11:37] brother so they wouldn't bully on him
[1:11:38] and beat him up and things
[1:11:40] and a lion comes up
[1:11:44] and supernaturally God Came Upon him and
[1:11:48] took care of that lion
[1:11:50] and a little bit later there was a bear
[1:11:53] now we've all heard that story I'm not
[1:11:55] going to preach all that story again but
[1:11:57] I want you to look at it and realize
[1:11:59] that in David's life
[1:12:01] he had heard about Jehovah he'd been
[1:12:04] taught about Jehovah he had even seen
[1:12:07] Jehovah move in his life
[1:12:13] but the reason that David had to go
[1:12:15] through those experiences
[1:12:17] is because God knew from the beginning
[1:12:20] when David was just an infant in his
[1:12:22] mommy's arms God said that's a giant
[1:12:26] slayer
[1:12:30] now you might have looked in the mirror
[1:12:32] this morning I tell people all the time
[1:12:34] you cannot trust your feelings and your
[1:12:36] emotions
[1:12:38] I look in the mirror and I think oh my
[1:12:41] Lord
[1:12:43] who in the world but my mom would love
[1:12:45] me
[1:12:49] but you see my feelings and emotions lie
[1:12:52] to me because as soon as I turn away
[1:12:53] from that mirror and I walk in the room
[1:12:55] where sister Genie is she goes you are
[1:12:57] so handsome
[1:12:59] and I know she wouldn't lie to me
[1:13:02] [Applause]
[1:13:04] so don't trust your emotions or your
[1:13:06] feelings this morning don't trust what
[1:13:09] man says about you
[1:13:11] look at what God says and God gave us 66
[1:13:15] books plus 1200 tapes of his opinion
[1:13:19] about us and I want to take what he says
[1:13:22] and if he says I'm a giant slayer then
[1:13:26] I'm going to fulfill that promise that's
[1:13:29] been said about me
[1:13:31] amen
[1:13:33] so you may not have a really good family
[1:13:36] history you may not have the testimony
[1:13:39] that somebody else has
[1:13:41] but God has brought you through things
[1:13:43] up to this point
[1:13:46] and as I'm I tell sister Jeannie all the
[1:13:48] time she'll she'll say why are we going
[1:13:51] through this what have we done
[1:13:54] which let me just say that's one of the
[1:13:56] biggest lies that denominations ever put
[1:13:59] across and unfortunately there's people
[1:14:01] in the message that still believe this
[1:14:03] they think when something goes wrong
[1:14:05] that it's God punishing them
[1:14:08] God will chastise his children if they
[1:14:11] get out of line but everything that
[1:14:13] happens to you is not saying you've been
[1:14:15] bad
[1:14:16] I'm turning my love off
[1:14:18] no
[1:14:20] God loves me just as much this moment as
[1:14:23] he's ever loved me and he loves me just
[1:14:25] as much right now as he will ever love
[1:14:28] me
[1:14:29] I can't do anything for God not to love
[1:14:31] me
[1:14:32] okay I've got three boys they're all
[1:14:35] living in the world right now none of
[1:14:37] them are following Jesus Christ
[1:14:40] that does not mean I don't love them I'm
[1:14:42] grieved
[1:14:44] I'm disappointed
[1:14:46] but if one of them calls and says Dad I
[1:14:48] need I'm there
[1:14:50] I can't turn that love off they're part
[1:14:52] of me and I'm part of God almighty
[1:14:57] and therefore when I get in trouble
[1:14:59] sometimes I get chastised but when I get
[1:15:02] in trouble when Satan comes to me and
[1:15:04] starts feeding me his lies I just have
[1:15:06] to remember that Jesus Christ loves me
[1:15:09] period
[1:15:11] and his one Minister came and said and
[1:15:13] there's nothing you can do about it
[1:15:18] you can't get him to unlove you I don't
[1:15:20] know who this is for but somebody's
[1:15:22] pulling down this pathway okay
[1:15:25] so David went through experiences to get
[1:15:29] him prepared to do what God's purpose
[1:15:31] was in his life
[1:15:33] and David was setting one day and he
[1:15:36] remembered some of these things that he
[1:15:38] had been through is this supposed to be
[1:15:40] closer or further away
[1:15:42] closer
[1:15:44] okay because that's I'm I'm I'm getting
[1:15:46] feedback on that right there okay I
[1:15:48] apologize so David is setting one day
[1:15:51] and he has a pen in hand and inspiration
[1:15:54] begins to hit and he says these words o
[1:15:57] magnify the Lord with me let us exalt
[1:16:00] his name together
[1:16:03] David was remembering the experiences
[1:16:06] that he had come through
[1:16:09] now just to prove the point I was making
[1:16:11] just a moment ago David committed a
[1:16:14] horrible sin we all know that
[1:16:17] and God put it in the Bible
[1:16:21] not for us to belittle David or look
[1:16:23] down on David
[1:16:25] but
[1:16:28] y'all are pulling I I can't say with my
[1:16:31] notes
[1:16:32] did you ever notice
[1:16:36] that's looking to see if he had a cross
[1:16:37] and oh you've got a cross right here you
[1:16:40] know what this is
[1:16:41] this is a plus sign
[1:16:46] think about it this is a plus sign
[1:16:49] Abraham sinned
[1:16:52] okay in the Old Testament
[1:16:55] just stay with me this is going
[1:16:56] somewhere Abraham sinned
[1:16:59] but in the New Testament
[1:17:01] after Calvary
[1:17:04] Paul testified and said he staggered not
[1:17:08] at the promises of God through him
[1:17:09] believed
[1:17:11] so
[1:17:12] can I come down here
[1:17:14] all right so here's your life we'll
[1:17:17] start your life over here here's your
[1:17:19] life before Calvary minus minus negative
[1:17:23] negative negative but you're coming to
[1:17:27] Calvary someday some of you have already
[1:17:28] been there some of you are coming to
[1:17:30] Calvary once you're at Calvary
[1:17:32] God takes every negative that's ever
[1:17:34] been in your life and turns it positive
[1:17:37] for me
[1:17:37] [Applause]
[1:17:45] David sinned in the Old Testament no
[1:17:48] record of it in the in the New Testament
[1:17:50] Abraham sinned in the Old Testament no
[1:17:52] record of it in the New Testament
[1:17:54] in your former life you sinned no record
[1:17:57] of it in heaven today today
[1:18:00] no record on it
[1:18:03] Satan goes before the father to accuse
[1:18:05] you and God looks at him and says what
[1:18:07] are you talking about
[1:18:10] hey I've got video
[1:18:12] I've got text messages I've got a record
[1:18:15] of what he said what she said what they
[1:18:17] did what they said about somebody else
[1:18:18] and God looks and says
[1:18:24] that's what my record shows
[1:18:34] Glory but one day David did come into a
[1:18:38] place where he had an encounter with
[1:18:40] Christ
[1:18:42] and he found out
[1:18:44] now just think about this bear with me
[1:18:46] for a minute
[1:18:47] David found out Jehovah God that he had
[1:18:50] heard about that he had been taught
[1:18:52] about he found out Jehovah was larger
[1:18:55] than life
[1:19:00] he found out Jehovah was big enough to
[1:19:04] handle any issue that came up
[1:19:07] and he testified to Saul and he said the
[1:19:11] God to help me with the lion the god
[1:19:12] that helped me with the bear what is
[1:19:14] this uncircumcised Philistine to him
[1:19:19] all right my other favorite character is
[1:19:22] Paul the Apostle I'll take somebody from
[1:19:24] Old Testament I'll take somebody from
[1:19:26] the New Testament
[1:19:27] Saul of Tarsus
[1:19:29] heard about Jehovah now think about this
[1:19:33] prior to the Divine the word made flesh
[1:19:37] okay
[1:19:38] so
[1:19:41] there went my legalism that I brought
[1:19:43] with me from Pentecost
[1:19:45] okay
[1:19:50] God I've been a good boy
[1:19:52] sure you have
[1:19:54] attaboy that's good has nothing to do
[1:19:57] with your salvation Oh you mean I can go
[1:19:59] do anything I want no I didn't say that
[1:20:01] I didn't excuse sin I didn't say make
[1:20:03] Grace a disgrace I'm just saying all of
[1:20:07] your works all of your good deeds
[1:20:10] doesn't add up to anything
[1:20:13] if there's not a love behind it
[1:20:16] if there's not something where you
[1:20:18] realize Jesus I remember when I was in
[1:20:20] that state
[1:20:22] I remember when I was in that condition
[1:20:26] and light struck my path
[1:20:30] I've never been the same
[1:20:33] something changed down on the inside
[1:20:37] you see I spent 27 years I'm getting
[1:20:39] ahead of myself but I spent 27 years of
[1:20:41] my life
[1:20:42] being the best Pentecostal preacher's
[1:20:45] kid I could be
[1:20:47] and I failed
[1:20:50] I failed
[1:20:53] because he wasn't interested in another
[1:20:55] good Pentecostal preacher's kid
[1:20:58] he wanted me
[1:21:01] he didn't want my list of achievements
[1:21:03] he didn't want my list of good works he
[1:21:05] didn't want all the things that I would
[1:21:07] want to tell somebody to impress them
[1:21:10] didn't mean anything to him
[1:21:14] but when I surrendered and said Lord
[1:21:15] Jesus
[1:21:16] I'm in a horrible mess I've made a I've
[1:21:18] made a mess out of things and I can't
[1:21:21] get myself out
[1:21:23] he came on the scene
[1:21:25] all right let's get back to Paul Saul of
[1:21:28] Tarsus at the time
[1:21:30] he was taught he knew the scriptures
[1:21:34] he knew Moses quotes better than you and
[1:21:37] I would ever know them he knew him as
[1:21:39] good as any Pharisee ever knew him
[1:21:43] just like I told you I've got three boys
[1:21:45] that are out there
[1:21:46] you know running from the Lord
[1:21:49] brother Billy Paul asked me one day he
[1:21:51] said How's your sons I said they're all
[1:21:53] on their way to Calvary brother Billy
[1:21:55] Paul he said don't ever change that
[1:21:56] testimony brother Hoover don't you ever
[1:21:59] confess anything other than that so
[1:22:02] you know these eyes see him going that
[1:22:05] direction
[1:22:06] but down inside of here because of the
[1:22:08] word I see them headed towards Calvary
[1:22:11] [Applause]
[1:22:12] they're Hoovers they come by it honest
[1:22:15] all right it's in their DNA to take the
[1:22:18] Hard Road
[1:22:19] okay to go the roundabout way
[1:22:22] they got to figure it out for themselves
[1:22:24] they think
[1:22:26] why would I listen to Dad look at the
[1:22:27] mistakes he's made
[1:22:29] why would I listen you know
[1:22:31] dad all I did was I asked you a question
[1:22:33] and it turns into a sermon an hour later
[1:22:35] you know
[1:22:39] none of y'all can relate to that I
[1:22:41] understand
[1:22:44] so Saul Saul had all the knowledge that
[1:22:47] a man could muster
[1:22:51] but one day
[1:22:54] as I was listening to a message and
[1:22:56] brother random says I can see a man
[1:23:01] with a cross on his back
[1:23:03] I hear the Thump Thump Thump Thump as it
[1:23:06] hits the cobblestones as he goes out the
[1:23:08] Damascus gate
[1:23:11] okay
[1:23:14] so
[1:23:15] in my way of
[1:23:17] putting two and two together and coming
[1:23:19] up with four
[1:23:21] when Paul won Saul of Tarsus left
[1:23:24] Jerusalem with letters in his pocket to
[1:23:27] persecute the church and headed to
[1:23:30] Damascus
[1:23:33] he went right past Calvary
[1:23:38] now I don't know what his opinion of of
[1:23:40] Calvary was at that time he probably
[1:23:42] looked over and said yeah
[1:23:45] that's where they hung that guy that
[1:23:47] they think is the messiah
[1:23:50] but I know better I've been taught by
[1:23:53] Gamel
[1:23:55] I've I've heard about Jehovah all my
[1:23:57] life I've got this down I've got this
[1:24:00] figured out
[1:24:02] but you see Calvary
[1:24:06] after Jesus Christ died there Calvary
[1:24:08] was not a geographical location
[1:24:13] Calvary is a place where Jesus Christ
[1:24:16] and you meet
[1:24:19] and it becomes real to you what happened
[1:24:22] at Calvary
[1:24:24] and that it's personal
[1:24:26] it's not history anymore it's personal
[1:24:31] it's a live event
[1:24:33] and Paul little de Paul know that that
[1:24:36] Pillar of Fire that he had studied
[1:24:39] he'd examined it from every angle of how
[1:24:41] Moses encountered that Pillar of Fire
[1:24:43] And how that Pillar of Fire followed him
[1:24:44] through the Wilderness and led them and
[1:24:46] everything he knew all about the the
[1:24:48] pillar of Fire
[1:24:51] but he had never met the pillar of fire
[1:24:53] but one day he encountered
[1:24:55] Jehovah
[1:24:58] and with all of his book learning
[1:25:00] everything that he had Paul looks up
[1:25:02] from the dust of the Damascus Road and
[1:25:04] he goes who are you Lord
[1:25:08] you know the last thing Paul was
[1:25:10] expecting
[1:25:11] that Pillar of Fire to say
[1:25:14] I am Jesus
[1:25:18] wait a minute Lord
[1:25:20] wait a minute
[1:25:21] gamalia said
[1:25:23] the Pharisees say
[1:25:25] the scribes and and the and the learning
[1:25:28] men we all say this
[1:25:31] no Paul
[1:25:33] I am Jesus and you have been persecuting
[1:25:37] me
[1:25:39] and immediately he said Lord what would
[1:25:41] you have me to do
[1:25:43] and of course God had a prescription for
[1:25:45] him and so he sent Saul of Tarsus down
[1:25:48] to a street called straight
[1:25:51] and then this is the amazing thing
[1:25:54] and this is this is where David Hoover
[1:25:56] probably struggles the most
[1:25:58] okay
[1:26:03] I received Grace one day
[1:26:05] I'll tell you a little bit about how am
[1:26:07] I doing on time
[1:26:09] I received Grace one day
[1:26:12] and then
[1:26:14] the adversary comes along and if he
[1:26:16] can't get me to deny Grace if he can't
[1:26:18] get me to deny Jesus Christ he'll push
[1:26:21] me the other way
[1:26:22] and he'll make me want to be so special
[1:26:26] that you have to deserve the grace that
[1:26:29] I got freely
[1:26:30] because you don't fit my bill of goods
[1:26:33] you haven't met all the qualifications
[1:26:35] that I feel like that you should meet
[1:26:39] and so the Lord speaks to ananias and
[1:26:42] says I need you to go down here there's
[1:26:44] a there's a fellow that I've called
[1:26:46] his name is Saul of Tarsus and I need
[1:26:49] you to go down and pray for him and
[1:26:51] ananias initially he says um
[1:26:55] excuse me Lord
[1:26:58] I know I received the Holy Ghost I know
[1:27:01] that you're alive
[1:27:04] but possibly there's some things that
[1:27:07] slip by you
[1:27:09] that you don't know about this guy by
[1:27:11] the name of solar Tarsus
[1:27:15] now I know none of you that I'm talking
[1:27:17] to have ever felt that way about another
[1:27:19] person
[1:27:22] but one of the marks of the new of the
[1:27:25] New Testament the early church Having
[1:27:27] the Holy Ghost
[1:27:29] is the fact
[1:27:31] that when Saul of Tarsus changed his
[1:27:34] name to Paul when God changed his name
[1:27:35] to Paul and he comes back and he says
[1:27:39] God did something in my life brother
[1:27:40] Samuel could I get up in your pulpit and
[1:27:42] testify about it
[1:27:46] brother Samuel let him
[1:27:48] in the early church they let this guy
[1:27:51] killed some of their Kinfolk
[1:27:54] and they brought him to the pulpit and
[1:27:56] said testify to us brother
[1:27:58] that takes the Holy Ghost you can't fake
[1:28:01] that
[1:28:06] believe me I know because I've been
[1:28:07] tested on it
[1:28:09] I'm still being tested on it sometimes
[1:28:11] that guy
[1:28:13] that guy
[1:28:15] I remember him from Pentecost that guy's
[1:28:18] got the he got a revelation of the
[1:28:20] message
[1:28:21] he didn't get it from me because I
[1:28:23] didn't think he was worth the time
[1:28:29] yes God can call whoever he wants to
[1:28:32] and he called Saul of Tarsus and he said
[1:28:34] he's a chosen vessel because God looked
[1:28:38] at Saul of Tarsus from the beginning and
[1:28:41] said that's my first age messenger
[1:28:45] and no one in Jerusalem had that one
[1:28:48] figured out
[1:28:50] no one
[1:28:52] so counsel all you want to together
[1:28:54] study it out
[1:28:59] but it's all in there in that Damascus
[1:29:01] dust
[1:29:03] he realized
[1:29:06] maybe Jehovah is bigger than what I even
[1:29:08] thought he was
[1:29:10] maybe he's more glorious than what I
[1:29:12] thought he was
[1:29:14] there's a there's a fella in southern
[1:29:16] Indiana
[1:29:17] he came he he started dating this girl
[1:29:20] she was living in sin at the time she
[1:29:22] wasn't serving the lord
[1:29:24] but her grandfather was pastor at the
[1:29:27] Branham Tabernacle years ago
[1:29:30] so she knew about the truth but she
[1:29:32] couldn't live it
[1:29:34] and uh
[1:29:36] they fell in love
[1:29:38] and uh she would tell him all these
[1:29:41] stories
[1:29:43] testimonies but to him it was stories
[1:29:46] and uh he would sit there and he'd say
[1:29:49] Vicky
[1:29:51] I I don't think that you would lie to me
[1:29:53] but
[1:29:55] I just don't think God
[1:29:58] works like that
[1:30:00] I I don't think that he's really
[1:30:02] concerned about my everyday life
[1:30:06] and the
[1:30:07] the decisions I make on a daily basis
[1:30:12] and she tried to convince him but he
[1:30:14] couldn't understand it
[1:30:16] so they bought a little piece of
[1:30:17] property
[1:30:19] and uh
[1:30:21] they had a they had a
[1:30:23] intense discussion one night
[1:30:27] and they went to bed and she was
[1:30:30] frustrated because he just wouldn't give
[1:30:32] his heart to the Lord he didn't he
[1:30:34] didn't see what she was seeing and he
[1:30:37] went to bed mad because he felt like she
[1:30:39] was trying to just push him into it and
[1:30:41] cram it down his throat
[1:30:44] and the last thing that he said was it's
[1:30:46] okay if you want to believe that you go
[1:30:48] to church you do whatever you want to
[1:30:50] but I just don't think God act operates
[1:30:53] that way he doesn't act like that
[1:30:56] so the next day he goes to work he
[1:30:58] worked in the Quarry he goes to work
[1:31:01] well first of all he plowed he had
[1:31:03] plowed the garden that evening
[1:31:04] getting ready to plant he had plowed the
[1:31:07] garden
[1:31:08] and so the next day he comes home from
[1:31:11] his job at the Quarry and she had taken
[1:31:13] the kids somewhere shopping or over
[1:31:16] somebody's house visiting and it was
[1:31:17] just him at home
[1:31:19] and so he walks down to his garden
[1:31:25] and as he walks down to the Garden he
[1:31:28] notices in the garden
[1:31:31] there's a cross
[1:31:34] of fresh dirt
[1:31:36] that looked like somebody had just
[1:31:37] tilled it over that day
[1:31:39] the rest of the garden
[1:31:41] in the whole garden plot it was a
[1:31:43] rectangle and there's
[1:31:45] fresh dirt
[1:31:47] real Brown
[1:31:49] and the rest of it was light tan where
[1:31:51] the sun had dried it out
[1:31:54] and he stood there and he looked at it
[1:31:57] and he said
[1:32:00] how did that happen
[1:32:02] because he realized he hadn't put a
[1:32:04] pattern in the dirt when he plowed the
[1:32:07] garden the day before
[1:32:08] he just tilled the whole thing over
[1:32:11] but there it was right before him and he
[1:32:13] said as I stood there and looked at it
[1:32:15] he said a little small voice inside
[1:32:17] brother Hoover said yes Todd I do work
[1:32:21] like that
[1:32:24] and I'm that important
[1:32:27] I want to be that important in your life
[1:32:30] I want to be God of the little things as
[1:32:33] well as the big things
[1:32:35] he surrendered his heart to Jesus Christ
[1:32:39] you may not have a garden tilling story
[1:32:41] you may not have some of these other
[1:32:42] testimonies but God wants to be real I I
[1:32:45] don't know which person I'm speaking to
[1:32:47] this morning
[1:32:49] but God wants to be that real in your
[1:32:52] life I don't care if you're the youngest
[1:32:54] person here or the oldest person here I
[1:32:57] don't care if you just soak it up and
[1:32:59] believe everything that you hear about
[1:33:00] the message or if you're one of those
[1:33:02] people like from Missouri that say I got
[1:33:04] to see it to believe it you got to prove
[1:33:06] it to me God Is that real and he's that
[1:33:10] interested in every detail of your life
[1:33:19] so Saul of Tarsus found out that Jehovah
[1:33:22] was magnified in Jesus Christ think
[1:33:25] about this
[1:33:30] before he met Jesus Christ on the
[1:33:32] Damascus Road he is a Pharisee of the
[1:33:35] Pharisees
[1:33:36] as touching the law he was lacking
[1:33:39] nothing
[1:33:40] now turn in your Bibles with me if you
[1:33:42] would to First Corinthians
[1:33:46] second chapter
[1:33:49] and let's see what the most learned man
[1:33:51] of that day
[1:33:52] had to say
[1:33:54] after he met Jesus on the Damascus Road
[1:33:57] in the pillar of Fire
[1:33:59] he says and I Brethren when I came to
[1:34:01] you came not with Excellency of speech
[1:34:03] or of wisdom declaring unto you the
[1:34:05] testimony of God
[1:34:07] for I determined not to know anything
[1:34:09] among you save Jesus Christ and him
[1:34:11] crucified
[1:34:12] and I was with you in weakness
[1:34:16] Pharisee of the Pharisees doesn't sound
[1:34:18] weak does it
[1:34:19] I was with you in weakness and in fear
[1:34:22] and in much trembling and my speech and
[1:34:25] my preaching was not with enticing words
[1:34:27] of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of
[1:34:29] the spirit and of power that your faith
[1:34:32] should not stand in the wisdom of men
[1:34:34] but in the power of God
[1:34:37] what a contrast
[1:34:40] what a contrast
[1:34:42] my dad always say always would say God
[1:34:46] knocked Paul off of his high horse that
[1:34:48] day
[1:34:49] and brought him down to Damascus dust to
[1:34:51] let him know
[1:34:52] Paul without me you're nothing
[1:34:57] so
[1:34:58] that brings us to another character
[1:35:02] and I'm going to ask you for the next
[1:35:04] few moments if you'll just forgive
[1:35:07] any personal pronouns
[1:35:12] but I just want to relate to you what
[1:35:15] Jesus Christ did for me
[1:35:17] because
[1:35:18] the same Jesus Christ that lives and
[1:35:20] beats inside of this breast right here
[1:35:23] wants to do that in your life
[1:35:25] this is not anything new I didn't come
[1:35:27] to bring you some new revelation okay I
[1:35:29] didn't come to tell you something that
[1:35:31] brother Samuel's not preached to you
[1:35:32] before I just come to magnify Jesus
[1:35:36] Christ
[1:35:36] [Applause]
[1:35:38] to let you know he wants to be large
[1:35:41] Larger than Life
[1:35:45] David David thought that he was doing
[1:35:48] everything that he was supposed to do
[1:35:49] out there taking care of the sheep but
[1:35:51] God had a larger agenda he had a larger
[1:35:54] purpose in David's life
[1:35:56] and he got that through to David Paul
[1:36:00] had an agenda but God had a bigger
[1:36:03] purpose
[1:36:05] I think it was you did you but he or
[1:36:08] brother Jack
[1:36:09] this week said something that had never
[1:36:12] realized
[1:36:13] talking about Esther
[1:36:16] that Queen
[1:36:19] was not the highest office that God had
[1:36:22] for Esther
[1:36:25] in the natural life in the Kingdom
[1:36:27] Esther was as high as a woman could go
[1:36:32] but she wasn't done yet God had a higher
[1:36:35] calling for her he wanted her to be a
[1:36:37] savior of her people
[1:36:40] so
[1:36:41] David was content to be a Shepherd boy
[1:36:45] but God said no there's something else I
[1:36:48] need for you there's something else I've
[1:36:50] got planned for you David I don't know
[1:36:52] what he's got planned for you I just
[1:36:54] came to Sheffield this morning to tell
[1:36:56] you
[1:36:57] whatever you're trying to do through
[1:36:58] your efforts whatever you're trying to
[1:37:00] achieve
[1:37:01] outside of Jesus Christ that's all well
[1:37:04] and good but God's Got A Higher Calling
[1:37:07] he's got a higher purpose in your life
[1:37:08] he's got he's got a reality that maybe
[1:37:12] you haven't even experienced yet but
[1:37:14] he's here to tell you this morning
[1:37:17] open your eyes listen I've got something
[1:37:20] bigger I've got something larger than
[1:37:23] what your life will ever amount to that
[1:37:25] I want to do in you
[1:37:27] so
[1:37:29] with that let me just share as much of
[1:37:31] this as I can in the time that I have
[1:37:46] one of the earliest memories I have
[1:37:53] is
[1:37:54] waking up on the back pew
[1:37:57] in a Pentecostal Church in Elizabethtown
[1:38:00] Kentucky
[1:38:01] and we were in a fellowship meeting
[1:38:04] with a black congregation
[1:38:08] because we were in the South they had
[1:38:10] their church we had our church
[1:38:12] and there's a reason I'm saying that
[1:38:15] just don't judge me on that yet
[1:38:18] and I remember they were having a
[1:38:20] victory march
[1:38:21] and the tambourine was going but what
[1:38:24] woke me up was
[1:38:26] the black brother that had the saxophone
[1:38:28] that come in the victory march he played
[1:38:31] the saxophone in the middle of the
[1:38:32] victory march he didn't stay up on the
[1:38:33] platform and right about the time that
[1:38:35] he got to the Pew that I was asleep on
[1:38:40] he was anointed to play it in a very
[1:38:43] loud Manner and I come awake and
[1:38:45] people's dancing and being slain in the
[1:38:47] spirit around me so what I'm telling you
[1:38:50] that for is because from the time I can
[1:38:52] remember anything it was church
[1:38:56] now I was born December the 23rd 1957.
[1:39:00] and uh
[1:39:02] you give me the signal if I go too long
[1:39:04] to you on this
[1:39:05] I was born December the 23rd 1957.
[1:39:09] I was I was the fourth of four children
[1:39:12] three girls
[1:39:14] and I was the only boy
[1:39:17] and I was mistreated by my sisters all
[1:39:19] my life
[1:39:24] no all my life
[1:39:27] if if my father
[1:39:29] was still living and he was here this
[1:39:31] morning and he was in the Pulpit at some
[1:39:33] time during his ministering this morning
[1:39:36] he would say David Paul stand up
[1:39:40] and I would stand up and everybody would
[1:39:43] look at me
[1:39:44] and I wanted to shrink I was I was an
[1:39:46] introvert
[1:39:48] okay
[1:39:49] I was very shy
[1:39:52] I had buck teeth all my life and then
[1:39:55] when I was in like the fourth grade I
[1:39:57] got glasses so then I became the buck
[1:40:00] tooth
[1:40:01] you know four-eyed
[1:40:03] kid in the class my mom put me in school
[1:40:07] before I turned five because the law
[1:40:10] said if I was going to turn five by the
[1:40:12] end of the year I could I could be
[1:40:14] enrolled in school so I wasn't even five
[1:40:17] years old when I first started school in
[1:40:19] August that year
[1:40:20] so I was always the youngest and the
[1:40:23] smallest boy in the class
[1:40:27] but back to my birth
[1:40:30] a few months actually a few weeks after
[1:40:32] I was born
[1:40:34] actually my mom had to lay in the bed on
[1:40:38] her back for the last
[1:40:40] six months of her pregnancy with me to
[1:40:43] keep from excuse me to keep from losing
[1:40:46] me so my ten-year-old sister at the time
[1:40:49] did all the laundry did all the cooking
[1:40:51] did all the dishes did everything so
[1:40:54] that my mom wouldn't lose me
[1:40:56] so whenever I came into the world
[1:41:01] as my sisters like to say
[1:41:03] David was special
[1:41:06] okay
[1:41:08] but Mom noticed a few weeks after I was
[1:41:10] born that when she went to change my
[1:41:12] diaper she would take you know grab me
[1:41:14] around the ankles
[1:41:16] and she would lift me to change my
[1:41:18] diaper but I did not Bend at the knees
[1:41:20] and that nor did I bend at the waist
[1:41:23] okay my body was mostly stiff
[1:41:27] she also noticed that whenever she moved
[1:41:30] her hand back and forth in front of my
[1:41:31] face or whenever there was any loud
[1:41:33] noise or anything I didn't react to it
[1:41:36] and so she took me to the doctor
[1:41:38] and the old country doctor that for
[1:41:40] years
[1:41:41] took payment and eggs and chickens and
[1:41:44] hams and things like that he said Lenora
[1:41:47] you've worried about this kid for the
[1:41:49] last six months take him home and enjoy
[1:41:51] him there's nothing wrong with him
[1:41:53] and she said Doctor I believe that there
[1:41:55] is something wrong and she explained to
[1:41:57] him what was going on he said Lenora
[1:41:59] your paranoid take him home and enjoy
[1:42:02] him
[1:42:03] well I didn't get any better
[1:42:05] so she kept going back to him
[1:42:08] and so when I was about
[1:42:10] four months four or five months old
[1:42:13] he said look I'm going to send you to a
[1:42:15] specialist in Louisville and I'm just
[1:42:18] I'm doing this just to give you peace of
[1:42:20] mind
[1:42:21] and shut you up
[1:42:24] and you know she'd known him all of his
[1:42:27] life and and all her life and so you
[1:42:30] know he could speak to her in that way
[1:42:32] and he wasn't being rude or anything he
[1:42:34] was trying to get her to quit being
[1:42:36] afraid of things and so she took me to
[1:42:38] the specialist in Louisville and two
[1:42:40] weeks later she had an appointment with
[1:42:42] the old country doctor again Dr brought
[1:42:45] her in the office and sat down
[1:42:47] and he said Lenore
[1:42:50] you're not going to like what I'm going
[1:42:51] to tell you
[1:42:53] but I've always told you the truth and
[1:42:55] I'm going to tell you the truth today
[1:42:58] your son has muscular dystrophy
[1:43:02] he will never walk
[1:43:03] he will never talk probably
[1:43:06] he will never run or play
[1:43:08] he also has a goiter in his throat that
[1:43:10] right now is the size of a full-grown
[1:43:13] man's Adam apple
[1:43:14] and if he's not operated on by the time
[1:43:16] that he's nine months old he will choke
[1:43:18] to death
[1:43:19] which is probably going to be the best
[1:43:21] thing that can happen to him I can
[1:43:23] imagine you can imagine a mom hearing
[1:43:25] this
[1:43:27] he said also
[1:43:29] when we did the break when they did the
[1:43:30] brain scan on him he has spots on his
[1:43:33] brain that have not that had did not
[1:43:35] develop in your womb and so he's never
[1:43:38] going to know you as mom he's never
[1:43:40] going to be able to
[1:43:42] give you love and things like that
[1:43:45] and he'll probably live at the very most
[1:43:47] until he's 12 years old or so and then
[1:43:51] he'll pass away which will be the the
[1:43:53] grace of God in your life
[1:43:57] well obviously my mom was shaken by that
[1:44:00] she comes home and she tells my dad
[1:44:03] and my dad said what any Pentecostal
[1:44:06] pastor full of the Holy Ghost should
[1:44:08] have said he said that's a lie and we're
[1:44:11] not going to believe that
[1:44:14] we're going to believe that he's healed
[1:44:17] and so from that point forward again I'm
[1:44:19] four or five months old at the time from
[1:44:21] that point forward every single service
[1:44:25] visiting Minister my dad preaching no
[1:44:28] matter what at the end of the service
[1:44:30] David Paul was taken forward and
[1:44:32] anointed and prayed for
[1:44:36] and nothing changed
[1:44:38] and a visiting Minister come into town
[1:44:40] one night
[1:44:41] and he got up to preach and he preached
[1:44:44] on I'm looking for someone to believe
[1:44:49] and he just kept repeating that time and
[1:44:51] time again until at the end of the
[1:44:54] service he was like he had invaded into
[1:44:56] a little song and he was singing I'm
[1:44:57] looking for someone to believe
[1:45:02] and so Mom says that the Holy Spirit
[1:45:04] told her take David Paul forward and she
[1:45:07] said Lord I've taken him so many times
[1:45:10] the people are worn out with it they're
[1:45:12] sick and tired of this kid being prayed
[1:45:14] for
[1:45:16] and he said I said taking forward
[1:45:20] and that continued and the preacher kept
[1:45:23] on singing and after a few minutes mom
[1:45:26] said Lord
[1:45:27] I'm getting ready to step out we was in
[1:45:28] a little storefront building
[1:45:30] just would probably see maybe 50 people
[1:45:33] in there
[1:45:34] she said Lord I'm going up there I'm
[1:45:36] going to have this this brother pray for
[1:45:38] him
[1:45:40] but you're gonna have to help me
[1:45:42] I need something to Anchor my faith to
[1:45:47] I know it's not an all in signs and
[1:45:49] wonders but I need to see something to
[1:45:53] prove to me
[1:45:55] that I can tie my face to
[1:45:57] and so she comes forward and as she
[1:45:59] comes forward the preacher comes down
[1:46:01] out of the pulpit holds his hands out
[1:46:03] like this and she lays me over into the
[1:46:05] preacher's hands and the minute that I'm
[1:46:07] leading to the preacher's hands she saw
[1:46:09] me swallow and the goiter disappeared
[1:46:15] now that was in May of 1958
[1:46:20] the next morning
[1:46:22] my family had a two-week vacation
[1:46:25] and they went from Kentucky to Florida
[1:46:28] and back
[1:46:30] to that point I had never been able to
[1:46:32] hold anything on my stomach except for
[1:46:34] apple soup applesauce
[1:46:36] and
[1:46:38] fruit juice
[1:46:40] my mother's milk any other milk I threw
[1:46:43] it up immediately
[1:46:45] so they took off no interstates in those
[1:46:47] days so they took off to Florida
[1:46:50] and every little town that they would
[1:46:52] come to whenever they got hungry and
[1:46:54] they would stop my mom would buy
[1:46:56] whatever brand of milk was sold in that
[1:46:58] town
[1:47:00] and all the way to Florida and all the
[1:47:02] way back home I drink
[1:47:04] every brand of milk that she could buy
[1:47:06] and never threw up a bit of it
[1:47:11] now whenever whenever the doctor in
[1:47:13] Louisville examined me
[1:47:16] I weighed an ounce less than I did when
[1:47:19] I was born in December
[1:47:22] and Mom said that
[1:47:24] my ankles and my wrist were just a
[1:47:28] barely a little bit bigger than what her
[1:47:31] thumb was around
[1:47:33] they got back from Florida on that
[1:47:35] two-week vacation and the neighbor lady
[1:47:37] across the street that helped my mom
[1:47:39] with me because my mom was
[1:47:42] really stressed because of this child
[1:47:45] that she had she comes over to welcome
[1:47:48] the family back home and I'm laying on
[1:47:49] the couch while they're unpacking and
[1:47:51] getting everything out of the car and
[1:47:54] Mrs Hall looks at that looks at me
[1:47:56] laying on a couch and says who's this
[1:47:59] baby here
[1:48:00] and Mom says that's David Paul she goes
[1:48:02] that's not David Paul
[1:48:04] David Paul's sick
[1:48:06] mom said not anymore Jesus healed him
[1:48:12] foreign
[1:48:15] six weeks later my grandfather on my
[1:48:18] mom's side passed away
[1:48:20] and my mom went to buy an outfit for me
[1:48:22] to wear to the to the funeral service
[1:48:25] and she had to get a size 18 month old
[1:48:28] outfit for a six-month-old so that it
[1:48:32] would fit around my wrist and my and my
[1:48:34] ankles
[1:48:35] because I had gained that much weight
[1:48:43] that's a story
[1:48:46] it's not a made-up story it's the truth
[1:48:48] it's a testimony but to me
[1:48:51] from a time that I was old enough to
[1:48:53] hear my dad say David Paul stand up
[1:48:57] for years
[1:48:59] I hated my dad
[1:49:02] doing that
[1:49:04] because invariably after church when I
[1:49:06] walked outside
[1:49:09] one of the grandmas would drive me and
[1:49:11] say you're so cute you're a little
[1:49:13] miracle baby
[1:49:16] I didn't like that brother Samuel
[1:49:18] I didn't like the fact that the kids
[1:49:20] would you know we'd I go out to run and
[1:49:22] play with the kids after service and
[1:49:23] they go are you a miracle baby
[1:49:26] you know kids can be cruel but anyway
[1:49:29] so I grew to resent that and it was just
[1:49:33] a story
[1:49:37] so my grandmother
[1:49:39] as brother Samuel told you
[1:49:42] she was hired in
[1:49:45] I guess it would have been
[1:49:48] late 54 early 55
[1:49:51] she was introduced to brother Branham by
[1:49:53] brother and sister Beeler
[1:49:56] and brother Branham was looking for a
[1:49:59] nanny
[1:50:01] he had the two girls at home
[1:50:04] and he wanted his sister Branham to
[1:50:06] travel with him
[1:50:08] and so they were looking for a nanny so
[1:50:11] he he interviewed my grandmother and
[1:50:14] hired her right on the spot in his
[1:50:16] brother Samuel told you brother Brown
[1:50:19] says on the tapes this is this is
[1:50:21] something that really means something to
[1:50:24] me when I when I listened to the message
[1:50:26] brother Branham says if I was to hire
[1:50:28] myself out to a man
[1:50:30] the first thing I would do is I would go
[1:50:33] to him and I would say what's expected
[1:50:35] of me
[1:50:37] and so when he hired my grandmother he
[1:50:39] walked her through every room of the
[1:50:41] house and he said in this room this is
[1:50:44] where we do this this is what I expect
[1:50:47] you to do one of the things was if the
[1:50:50] phone rings I expect you to get to the
[1:50:53] phone before I can get to it
[1:50:55] because you have to be a buffer it
[1:50:58] wasn't that he didn't want to be in
[1:50:59] contact with the people but he had to
[1:51:01] limit him himself because of the strain
[1:51:04] of the people if someone knocks on the
[1:51:06] door you need to get to the door before
[1:51:08] I have to go get it and then you come
[1:51:11] and tell
[1:51:12] myself or sister Branham who's at the
[1:51:15] door and things like that and so she did
[1:51:18] that incidentally
[1:51:20] I think I've told Brother Samuel this
[1:51:23] one day well
[1:51:26] let me finish that first so he walks her
[1:51:28] through the house and then as brother
[1:51:30] Samuel told you very accurately
[1:51:34] brother Branham
[1:51:35] obligated my grandmother to keep his
[1:51:38] word to a group of hornets
[1:51:42] that's how much his word meant
[1:51:44] he wasn't playing
[1:51:47] he wasn't trying to build some Ministry
[1:51:49] or or build a kingdom or anything he was
[1:51:52] simply serving God every single day of
[1:51:55] his life
[1:51:57] and he helped my grandmother
[1:52:00] in obligation to his words to a group of
[1:52:02] hornets now that might not mean anything
[1:52:04] to you but to me
[1:52:06] I can pick up a book
[1:52:09] a spoken word book or I can play a tape
[1:52:12] and those words carry value because I
[1:52:16] realize how much value they meant to
[1:52:18] brother Branham
[1:52:19] all right
[1:52:21] so back to the back to the front door of
[1:52:25] the Branham home
[1:52:26] so brother Branham goes to Chicago
[1:52:29] to a meeting
[1:52:31] and he gets to Chicago
[1:52:34] and the brother comes to him the man
[1:52:36] that organized the meeting he comes to
[1:52:37] him and he says brother Branham
[1:52:39] I got I I got something I got to tell
[1:52:42] you he said there's some ministers here
[1:52:45] and they have a check I've seen the
[1:52:48] check
[1:52:49] they have a check and it's going to
[1:52:50] sponsor our next meeting
[1:52:54] president said well that's wonderful
[1:52:55] brother he said there's just one thing
[1:52:58] these brothers are trinitarian and they
[1:53:01] don't want to hear anything about Jesus
[1:53:03] name baptism
[1:53:06] he said you got to promise me you will
[1:53:08] not mention Jesus name baptism in the
[1:53:10] Pulpit tonight
[1:53:11] brother Brown said I can't do that
[1:53:13] brother
[1:53:14] he said brother Branham you don't
[1:53:15] understand the check is in their pocket
[1:53:20] and if you mention Jesus name it's off
[1:53:24] just don't go down that road about Jesus
[1:53:27] name tonight brother Birmingham said
[1:53:29] brother I cannot do that it's not in my
[1:53:32] notes but if the Holy Spirit takes me
[1:53:34] that direction I'm doing what he says
[1:53:37] and the brother looks at brother Branham
[1:53:39] and says I'm sorry brother Branham I
[1:53:42] cannot let you in the Pulpit tonight
[1:53:45] and he turns and he goes out to the
[1:53:46] platform
[1:53:48] brother Branham is standing behind the
[1:53:49] curtain
[1:53:51] and the brother walks up to the
[1:53:53] microphone and says we regret to inform
[1:53:55] you that brother Branham will not be
[1:53:57] here to minister tonight his brother doc
[1:54:00] Branham is Gravely ill in Jeffersonville
[1:54:02] and he's had to return to Jeffersonville
[1:54:05] there's a bald light bald-faced lie
[1:54:09] and they put another man in the pulpit
[1:54:11] and he preaches
[1:54:13] and brother Branham and brother Billy
[1:54:15] Paul come back to Jeffersonville after
[1:54:17] the service
[1:54:20] well brother Branham relates to Sister
[1:54:22] meaty and my grandmother what took place
[1:54:26] and by the way I told that testimony for
[1:54:29] years
[1:54:31] and the first time I told it to brother
[1:54:33] Nathan Bryant he goes brother Hoover I
[1:54:36] said what
[1:54:37] you know I thought he was going to prove
[1:54:39] me wrong or something he said you
[1:54:41] realize what brother Branham did there
[1:54:44] I said what
[1:54:45] he said all he had to do was pull that
[1:54:48] curtain back
[1:54:50] and expose that man
[1:54:52] but the character of Christ couldn't do
[1:54:55] that
[1:54:57] that's pretty impressive right there
[1:54:59] but the rest of the story is
[1:55:01] about four weeks three or four weeks
[1:55:03] later that man from Chicago knocks on
[1:55:06] the front door of the Branham home
[1:55:09] and my grandmother doing her Duty goes
[1:55:12] to the front door and opens it and there
[1:55:14] stands brother so and so on the front
[1:55:16] porch of the home
[1:55:18] and my grandmother was raised in the
[1:55:20] south
[1:55:21] okay and I know that some of you all
[1:55:24] were not originally from Ohio so you'll
[1:55:27] probably understand this you didn't
[1:55:29] leave somebody standing at your front
[1:55:30] door in the South you invite them in
[1:55:33] okay you make them feel at home
[1:55:36] like brother Samuel did for sister
[1:55:38] Jeannie and I yesterday
[1:55:40] all right
[1:55:41] granny leaves him standing on the front
[1:55:44] porch and goes and and she finds sister
[1:55:46] random and she says
[1:55:48] brother so and so standing at the front
[1:55:50] door
[1:55:51] and sister Branham said I'll tell Bill
[1:55:54] and she goes to brother Branham and she
[1:55:56] says bill
[1:55:57] brother so and so is at the front door
[1:56:00] and brother Branham says
[1:56:03] bring amen
[1:56:05] and so they go get him and they bring
[1:56:07] him in and they set him down and he and
[1:56:10] brother Branham are talking and in the
[1:56:13] middle of them talking sister Mita walks
[1:56:15] by and he says meet him
[1:56:17] aren't you going to offer the brother
[1:56:19] anything to eat or drink while he's here
[1:56:21] he's a guest in our home
[1:56:23] and so she goes and gets him something
[1:56:25] to eat and she goes and gets him a drink
[1:56:27] and she brings it back and she serves it
[1:56:29] to him
[1:56:30] and he and brother Branham finished
[1:56:31] their conversation and they plan another
[1:56:35] meeting
[1:56:40] now
[1:56:41] I tell you this because I want you to
[1:56:44] understand
[1:56:45] what the Holy Ghost can do
[1:56:51] I know I have the Holy Ghost and I love
[1:56:53] brother Samuel but if brother Samuel had
[1:56:55] come to me back there and said look I
[1:56:57] need to see your notes I want to make
[1:56:59] sure you're not going to cover anything
[1:57:00] controversial today and by all means
[1:57:03] stay off this subject because there's
[1:57:05] somebody in the congregation that's
[1:57:06] battling that right now
[1:57:08] I probably wouldn't feel comfortable
[1:57:10] ever preaching for brother Samuel again
[1:57:13] okay
[1:57:14] just I'm being transparent for the
[1:57:17] random plans of meeting with him stands
[1:57:19] up hugs the brother's neck and says I
[1:57:21] believe this is going to be one of the
[1:57:23] greatest meetings we've ever had brother
[1:57:25] I'm looking forward to it with all my
[1:57:26] heart walks the brother out to his
[1:57:28] vehicle in the driveway waves goodbye to
[1:57:31] him comes back in the house and these
[1:57:33] are my grandmother's words and sister
[1:57:35] Branham is standing there when he comes
[1:57:38] through the door
[1:57:40] and she's got both hands on her hips
[1:57:43] like this
[1:57:45] and she says Bill Branham
[1:57:48] after what that man did to you and your
[1:57:51] ministry in Chicago and you bring him in
[1:57:54] our house serving our food and our
[1:57:57] drinks and plan another meeting with him
[1:58:01] and my grandmother heard brother Branham
[1:58:03] look at his wife and say meaty
[1:58:05] if God don't hold it against him neither
[1:58:08] can I
[1:58:11] [Applause]
[1:58:15] I'll just put this in I told him that
[1:58:18] this when we did the tour
[1:58:20] I want my Holy Ghost to do that
[1:58:25] and I'm going to be honest enough with
[1:58:27] you to let you know sometimes it doesn't
[1:58:30] go that far
[1:58:33] but he's still working on it
[1:58:41] so sister Brandon came to my grandmother
[1:58:43] one day and she said sister Hoover
[1:58:45] I I hate to ask this but I need you to
[1:58:48] do me a favor
[1:58:49] and my grandmother said whatever sister
[1:58:51] Branham you know what am I doing that's
[1:58:53] not pleased she said it's not that she
[1:58:56] said
[1:58:57] I need you to eat in the kitchen
[1:59:01] and my grandmother said well I'll I'll
[1:59:04] be happy if that's if that's what you
[1:59:06] need but is there something I've done
[1:59:07] wrong that makes you she said no it's
[1:59:09] not anything you've done wrong sister
[1:59:10] Hoover she said but when we're sitting
[1:59:12] at the kitchen table
[1:59:14] and the kids are getting ready to go to
[1:59:15] school that's their only time for Bill
[1:59:18] to be dead to him
[1:59:20] and she said I know that you don't mean
[1:59:23] anything by it but you asked Bill a
[1:59:25] question and the next thing we know
[1:59:27] we're in church
[1:59:30] and she said if you just let the kids
[1:59:33] have time with him as Dad that would
[1:59:35] really be nice
[1:59:37] and
[1:59:40] my grandmother said that they would all
[1:59:42] gather at the table before she moved to
[1:59:44] the kitchen they would all gather at the
[1:59:46] table
[1:59:47] and
[1:59:50] breakfast would be there
[1:59:53] and they'd bow their heads for prayer
[1:59:56] now my grandmother was old time
[1:59:58] Pentecost okay
[2:00:00] she had she had the real stuff
[2:00:04] okay she had a real experience with
[2:00:06] Jesus Christ
[2:00:08] and there was no put on to my
[2:00:10] grandmother
[2:00:10] okay
[2:00:13] she said they would bow their heads and
[2:00:15] brother Branham would say
[2:00:18] Lord Jesus and she said it would be like
[2:00:21] there'd just be a dump of the Holy
[2:00:23] Spirit
[2:00:25] come into that dining room around that
[2:00:27] table
[2:00:28] and her way again her words but she said
[2:00:31] it was like when he said Lord Jesus
[2:00:36] the Lord said what is it
[2:00:39] he would come down present what do you
[2:00:42] need what can I do for you
[2:00:45] and my grandmother would get the holy
[2:00:48] spirit all over her and she'd began to
[2:00:50] shout
[2:00:51] and then she would want to ask some
[2:00:53] question about the scripture or
[2:00:55] something like that
[2:00:58] and so she had to move into the kitchen
[2:00:59] so that the family could have family
[2:01:02] time
[2:01:04] so brother Branham would come home
[2:01:08] brother random would come home
[2:01:10] from meetings and he would testify to
[2:01:13] him
[2:01:14] that
[2:01:16] he would say there was a there was a man
[2:01:18] that came in the prayer line
[2:01:20] and he had a cancer on his jaw
[2:01:23] he said it was probably big as a
[2:01:25] softball
[2:01:26] and he said
[2:01:29] and this is important for you to
[2:01:31] understand
[2:01:32] granny said he always talked about the
[2:01:34] prayer line in the third person
[2:01:37] it was never I said
[2:01:40] I did it was always and the Lord Jesus
[2:01:44] spoke to him and the Lord Jesus healed
[2:01:47] him and he would talk about that cancer
[2:01:49] falling off the man's face and laying on
[2:01:52] the floor at his feet
[2:01:54] and he would testify
[2:01:57] and then he would lock himself in the
[2:01:59] bathroom
[2:02:02] and he would fight those demons
[2:02:05] Billy Paul tells a testimony about how
[2:02:07] he used to have to drive his dad around
[2:02:09] the hills of Southern Indiana
[2:02:12] and he said he would be driving him
[2:02:14] around and he would still be saying Lord
[2:02:16] touch my brother Lord Lord Heal my
[2:02:18] sister
[2:02:19] and brother Billy would have to drive
[2:02:20] him around until he come down out of
[2:02:22] that that fog of the Holy Spirit
[2:02:26] so he would be fighting those demons
[2:02:28] and granny said he would be in the
[2:02:30] bathroom sometimes a day or two
[2:02:34] now eight-year-old David Hoover
[2:02:37] thinks
[2:02:39] if my dad locks himself in a bathroom
[2:02:41] for two days
[2:02:44] there's going to be some issues you know
[2:02:46] I don't know if they went to the to
[2:02:48] brother Banks religious house I don't
[2:02:50] know what they did for a bathroom for
[2:02:51] you know I don't know if there was
[2:02:53] another bathroom in the house or not I
[2:02:54] don't know
[2:02:55] but
[2:02:56] this man locked himself in a bathroom
[2:02:58] for a day or two fighting those demons
[2:03:03] and granny said finally the door to the
[2:03:05] bathroom would open and he would stick
[2:03:06] his head out and he would say meaty get
[2:03:09] the kids in the car I think we need to
[2:03:11] take a little Drive
[2:03:13] and so they would all load up in the car
[2:03:15] brother Branham Joseph at the time just
[2:03:19] a just a kid Sister Branham my
[2:03:22] grandmother and the two girls in the
[2:03:23] back seat and they would take off
[2:03:25] driving around southern Indiana
[2:03:27] well we have what we call knobs in
[2:03:29] Southern Indiana you've heard brother
[2:03:30] Branham explain it on the tape
[2:03:34] and so I know
[2:03:36] where the beelers lived and for the
[2:03:39] Branham used to love to take my
[2:03:41] grandmother out to The Beatles and he
[2:03:43] and brother Beeler would fellowship and
[2:03:46] Granny would fellowship and it it got
[2:03:49] his mind off of things and he was able
[2:03:51] to to uh come come back to
[2:03:56] being a being a human being
[2:04:01] and uh
[2:04:02] so again
[2:04:04] my grandmother in the back seat
[2:04:07] will begin to talk to brother Branham
[2:04:09] and ask questions
[2:04:13] and
[2:04:14] she said he would begin to talk to him
[2:04:16] and he would answer her questions but
[2:04:19] she said she's not the only person
[2:04:21] that's ever testified that it felt like
[2:04:22] this but her words were it felt like
[2:04:25] that Moses and and David and Elijah and
[2:04:31] Paul the Apostle and Peter and John was
[2:04:34] in the car with you as he's explaining
[2:04:36] the scriptures to him
[2:04:39] incidentally there was a there was a
[2:04:43] black brother from Baltimore that
[2:04:45] somebody played him the tape where
[2:04:47] brother Branham has explained what it
[2:04:48] was like at the tent door when he came
[2:04:51] in when Elohim came and visited Abraham
[2:04:53] and this this black brother looked at
[2:04:55] the brother that was playing the tape
[2:04:57] for him and he said you know for the
[2:04:59] randoms just preaching away and this
[2:05:01] brother says
[2:05:02] Google God Almighty was that man sitting
[2:05:04] there
[2:05:06] and uh the brother that was playing the
[2:05:09] tape for him says no he wasn't but the
[2:05:12] one Speaking was
[2:05:14] [Applause]
[2:05:17] so
[2:05:19] granny said that you know the Holy
[2:05:21] Spirit would fill the car and again
[2:05:23] she'd begin to shout and praise the Lord
[2:05:25] and have what she called a holy ghost
[2:05:28] fit and she said I would come out from
[2:05:30] under that Holy Ghost fit and brother
[2:05:32] branham's in the driver's seat of the
[2:05:34] car
[2:05:34] and these young men have experienced
[2:05:37] some of those roads down there in
[2:05:38] Southern Indiana brother Samuel has they
[2:05:41] twist and they go back and forth and up
[2:05:43] and down over those knobs and everything
[2:05:45] and granny said brother branham's in the
[2:05:47] front seat both hands in the air
[2:05:51] knees not touching the steering wheel
[2:05:53] and the car is going around the road
[2:05:56] and he's singing It's dripping with
[2:05:58] blood it's dripping with blood this Holy
[2:06:00] Ghost Gospel is driven with blood
[2:06:03] [Applause]
[2:06:06] one one last one about granny I think
[2:06:09] it's the last one
[2:06:12] a man came to the door one day
[2:06:14] granny didn't get to the door
[2:06:16] brother Branham answered the door
[2:06:19] the minute brother Branham answered the
[2:06:20] door the man fell on his knees
[2:06:24] and begin to worship brother Branham
[2:06:27] and he said words that were true
[2:06:30] he said
[2:06:31] brother random God has shown me that you
[2:06:33] are Elijah the prophet in this day and
[2:06:37] I've come to acknowledge that and he
[2:06:38] truly began to worship brother Branham
[2:06:40] Grant he said brother Branham reached
[2:06:43] out and grabbed the man by the lapels
[2:06:45] and pulled him to his feet and shook him
[2:06:48] and he said brother
[2:06:51] don't do that
[2:06:53] Worship the Lord Jesus only
[2:06:58] rebuke the man and send him on his way
[2:07:02] granny watch brother Branham walk from
[2:07:04] his front door into the den fall down at
[2:07:07] his chair
[2:07:08] and she heard him say Lord Jesus
[2:07:11] don't hold that against my brother
[2:07:14] I don't know what he's seen or heard
[2:07:16] that would make him do that
[2:07:17] but Lord I did what I was supposed to do
[2:07:20] I told him to worship you and you alone
[2:07:22] don't lay that to his charge
[2:07:30] so one day Genie and I were newly
[2:07:33] married
[2:07:34] and we didn't have a washer and dryer
[2:07:38] and so she would go up to my mom and
[2:07:40] dad's house and she would do her laundry
[2:07:42] up there
[2:07:44] and Granny lived with my mom and dad at
[2:07:46] the time
[2:07:48] and so
[2:07:51] granny had the ability to get on your
[2:07:53] nerves
[2:07:58] and so Jeannie walks in the room one day
[2:08:00] after doing laundry and Granny has my
[2:08:03] socks and my underwear
[2:08:06] and she's selling a red thread
[2:08:09] on every piece of clothing that Jeannie
[2:08:12] had just done the laundry on
[2:08:14] and Genie said
[2:08:17] in her sweet voice
[2:08:21] Janie says
[2:08:23] what are you doing
[2:08:25] that's David's clothes she goes I know
[2:08:27] they are because they just came out of
[2:08:29] the dryer
[2:08:31] but LG my dad LG has been missing some
[2:08:34] things and I'm just making sure you only
[2:08:36] take David's stuff back home with you
[2:08:38] and none of LG's stuff
[2:08:41] well my wife came home I came home that
[2:08:44] night from work and my wife was
[2:08:48] perturbed
[2:08:53] and so
[2:08:54] she explained to me in a nice way that I
[2:08:57] needed to talk to my dad about my
[2:09:00] grandmother's Behavior
[2:09:02] and so I did
[2:09:04] myself my sister because there was been
[2:09:07] an incident with her and her husband
[2:09:10] we all sat down with Dad and we
[2:09:12] explained to him how things needed to be
[2:09:14] done
[2:09:15] well
[2:09:16] dad
[2:09:19] the next time I was at the house
[2:09:22] I guess Dad figured he needed a witness
[2:09:24] so he set my grandmother down on the
[2:09:26] couch in front of me and he said now Mom
[2:09:28] there's some things that's come to my
[2:09:31] attention and I need to make sure
[2:09:33] what you and that you understand
[2:09:36] how things need to be
[2:09:38] and he rebuked her
[2:09:41] and she got up from her chair
[2:09:44] and she walked into her bedroom and
[2:09:45] closed the door
[2:09:47] and she was in there for
[2:09:49] pretty much the remainder of the day
[2:09:52] so after I come to the Lord I'm sitting
[2:09:54] listening to brother Hunter preach one
[2:09:56] day and he said you understand it had to
[2:09:59] be the Holy Ghost and Stephen because he
[2:10:02] repeated Jesus's words from the cross
[2:10:05] and he knew that his record was clear
[2:10:07] with Jesus Christ and that there was
[2:10:10] nothing that would stick because of the
[2:10:12] blood
[2:10:13] and so he said to those people about
[2:10:16] those people that were stolen him Lord
[2:10:18] don't put it on their account lay it
[2:10:20] over on my account because I know
[2:10:22] everything's okay between me and you
[2:10:24] and his brother Hunter is preaching the
[2:10:27] Holy Spirit spoke and said
[2:10:28] that's exactly what your grandmother did
[2:10:31] in her bedroom that day she went in
[2:10:33] there knelt down to me and she said
[2:10:35] don't charge this to the grandkids Lord
[2:10:37] I've seen a reality of what you are in a
[2:10:41] person's life and I know my record's
[2:10:43] clear so just take what the kids are
[2:10:45] saying and lay it over on me
[2:10:51] okay I'm gonna try to hurry with this
[2:10:53] last part so I heard about Jesus Christ
[2:10:57] I was taught about Jesus Christ
[2:11:01] my dad was a preacher my mom was a
[2:11:03] Sunday school teacher my oldest sister
[2:11:04] was a Sunday school teacher I knew all
[2:11:06] about Jesus Christ I could beat you at a
[2:11:08] Bible sword drill
[2:11:11] okay I could finish the scripture
[2:11:13] whenever Dad started saying it
[2:11:16] I knew all this stuff
[2:11:20] but when I got to be a teenager
[2:11:23] for
[2:11:25] obvious reasons to some of you
[2:11:30] I got smarter than Dad
[2:11:33] and I decided I didn't need to live
[2:11:36] under his rules and his regulations and
[2:11:39] all that
[2:11:40] and so I moved out of the house and I
[2:11:42] began to live my life
[2:11:44] because everything I've told you up to
[2:11:45] this point about my healing about granny
[2:11:50] to the 27 year old David Hoover they
[2:11:53] were stories
[2:11:55] you understand what I'm saying they were
[2:11:57] just stories
[2:12:03] so January this well
[2:12:05] I'm sitting in a Pentecostal church and
[2:12:07] the pastor gets up one morning and he's
[2:12:09] preaching away and all of a sudden I
[2:12:12] still to this day I don't remember
[2:12:13] exactly what it was preaching on but I
[2:12:15] know what he got ready what he said next
[2:12:17] had nothing to do with what his message
[2:12:19] was
[2:12:21] okay
[2:12:22] now I'm sitting in this Pentecostal
[2:12:25] church I'm a youth leader
[2:12:28] and
[2:12:30] this next part's not going to be
[2:12:34] real easy for me to say
[2:12:37] but just wait until you hear the end of
[2:12:39] the story before you judge me
[2:12:42] I'm a Pentecostal youth leader
[2:12:45] and I knew
[2:12:48] by my reading of the scripture the
[2:12:51] tongues was not the evidence
[2:12:53] I'd been taught that by my dad because
[2:12:55] my dad never believed that tongues was
[2:12:57] the evidence but I wasn't going to take
[2:12:58] my dad's word for it I was gonna I was
[2:13:02] gonna be my own guy and I was going to
[2:13:03] believe what I believed but I knew
[2:13:06] tongues was not the evidence
[2:13:08] and so I was uncomfortable when young
[2:13:10] people came to the Altar and everybody
[2:13:12] gathered around them and tried to pray
[2:13:13] them through the tongues I couldn't pray
[2:13:16] that prayer
[2:13:17] and so I started every service I was on
[2:13:20] the altar
[2:13:21] sister Genie said what's going on I said
[2:13:26] I I don't want to talk about it but I
[2:13:28] get down at this altar brother Samuel
[2:13:30] and I would pray and I'd say Lord I need
[2:13:33] more of you
[2:13:35] and that still Small Voice that has
[2:13:37] never led me wrong in my entire life
[2:13:38] would speak back to me and say you're
[2:13:42] not living everything you know when you
[2:13:45] live what you do know
[2:13:46] I'll show you more
[2:13:50] and somehow in my Pentecostal mind I
[2:13:55] knew he was referring to brother
[2:13:57] branham's Ministry and those stories
[2:14:00] that I'd heard on my life
[2:14:01] because my father even though he never
[2:14:04] realized that brother Branham was
[2:14:05] Malachi 4 5 fulfilled
[2:14:08] he did say I saw more of God in that man
[2:14:11] than any other man I've ever met in my
[2:14:13] life
[2:14:14] that's a pretty good testimony
[2:14:16] so I knew that there was something to
[2:14:18] this
[2:14:20] so I'm down at the altar and the answer
[2:14:22] comes back live what I've shown you I'll
[2:14:26] open up more to you
[2:14:29] and so
[2:14:31] I struggled with that I went to my
[2:14:33] Pentecostal pastor and I told him I said
[2:14:35] there there's something more there's
[2:14:36] something missing in my life and he said
[2:14:39] you've spoken tongues yes
[2:14:42] you shouted and run the owls in my
[2:14:43] church yes
[2:14:45] you're a youth leader you've been
[2:14:47] ministering for me yes
[2:14:49] what is it that you need
[2:14:51] only way I knew to put it was Paul had a
[2:14:54] Damascus Road experience
[2:14:56] yes he did I haven't had one
[2:14:59] oh well Brother David everybody's
[2:15:02] experience is not the same
[2:15:05] so then I I said well the only thing I
[2:15:08] know to say to you brother Slattery is I
[2:15:12] need a guarantee between me and Jesus
[2:15:13] Christ that everything's okay
[2:15:17] he said what do you mean a guarantee I
[2:15:19] don't understand that you've done
[2:15:21] everything that you're supposed to do
[2:15:22] you've repented you've been baptized
[2:15:24] you've been filled with the Holy Ghost
[2:15:26] da da
[2:15:28] what I didn't tell my Pentecostal pastor
[2:15:32] was as a youth leader in his church
[2:15:35] fill in his Pulpit at least every other
[2:15:37] week
[2:15:39] that I was bound by a spirit of lust I
[2:15:42] was addicted to pornography
[2:15:44] I did not tell him
[2:15:46] that I was bound by a racist spirit and
[2:15:49] I hated a man just because of the color
[2:15:51] of his skin and if I could tell a nasty
[2:15:54] joke about a man
[2:15:55] that was Black Or Hispanic
[2:15:58] I enjoyed it even more
[2:16:02] and third thing was I had a spirit
[2:16:04] agreed upon me that if you had a dollar
[2:16:07] in your pocket I was in sales I was
[2:16:09] going to figure out a way to get that
[2:16:11] dollar out of your pocket
[2:16:13] lie cheat still whatever
[2:16:15] and I'm a youth leader
[2:16:19] and so my Pentecostal Pastor said I
[2:16:22] don't know what to do for you
[2:16:24] you're frustrating me you're frustrating
[2:16:25] yourself
[2:16:27] so I went to my dad
[2:16:29] I told my dad
[2:16:32] I need a guarantee
[2:16:35] he said what do you mean I said Paul had
[2:16:37] a Damascus Road experience I haven't had
[2:16:39] that type of experience I want that
[2:16:41] experience with Jesus Christ I want him
[2:16:43] to guarantee me everything's clear the
[2:16:46] record's clean
[2:16:48] my dad said don't ever stop son until
[2:16:52] you get what you're looking for it's for
[2:16:54] you
[2:16:58] so I was seeking the Lord
[2:17:01] and the Pentecostal pastor
[2:17:04] his daughter was living in a homosexual
[2:17:06] relationship and outside the church
[2:17:09] and we had a Revival and she comes in
[2:17:12] one night of the Revival with her
[2:17:14] partner
[2:17:16] and she listens for the whole service
[2:17:18] and at the end of the service they gave
[2:17:20] an altar call and she hits the altar
[2:17:22] over on this side and within about three
[2:17:25] minutes she is speaking in tongues
[2:17:27] and everybody in the church is shouting
[2:17:30] and praising the Lord and having a
[2:17:32] Hallelujah time
[2:17:35] and something inside of me said
[2:17:39] you need to watch the life that she's
[2:17:41] going to live from this point forward
[2:17:43] she went home with her homosexual
[2:17:45] partner
[2:17:46] they continued to live together
[2:17:49] and the next service that she come to
[2:17:51] church she was the youth choir director
[2:17:55] and was teaching our young people
[2:17:57] a new song that they were going to sing
[2:18:01] and the song that they got up and sang
[2:18:05] there's a there was a worldly song at
[2:18:07] that time that said these words
[2:18:09] celebrate Good Time come on there's a
[2:18:12] party going on tonight
[2:18:14] and she changed those words just a
[2:18:16] little bit
[2:18:17] celebrate
[2:18:19] Good Times come on there's a service
[2:18:21] going on tonight
[2:18:24] now two of our brothers in the church
[2:18:26] had just done an expose on rock and roll
[2:18:28] music and the devil got so mad at him
[2:18:31] that he nearly split their marriages and
[2:18:33] they're sitting there watching young
[2:18:35] people that they've taught about the
[2:18:36] evil of rock and roll and country music
[2:18:40] and those kids are up there swaying to a
[2:18:42] rock and roll song and singing
[2:18:44] and so
[2:18:47] my righteous indignation I went to my
[2:18:49] Pentecostal Pastor after service and I
[2:18:51] said
[2:18:53] um
[2:18:55] isn't your daughter still living with
[2:18:56] her partner
[2:18:58] he said yes
[2:19:00] I said and wasn't that a rock and roll
[2:19:02] song that she just led the children in
[2:19:04] tonight and he said
[2:19:06] she changed the words it's a worship
[2:19:09] song
[2:19:11] I said brother
[2:19:13] something's not right here
[2:19:15] the Holy Ghost doesn't live in a
[2:19:17] homosexual relationship
[2:19:19] and the Holy Ghost doesn't sing rock and
[2:19:21] roll music
[2:19:23] and he goes she's my daughter you her
[2:19:26] yourself speaking tongues at the altar
[2:19:28] she has the Holy Ghost and she's gonna
[2:19:31] she's gonna lead our youth
[2:19:34] and
[2:19:36] we said we're not going to go to that
[2:19:37] church anymore
[2:19:39] and about that time was when I got
[2:19:41] introduced to a man by the name of Ed
[2:19:43] Hunter Jr and I'm going to shorten this
[2:19:45] down real quick
[2:19:47] we went to service brother hunter gets
[2:19:50] up and preaches
[2:19:51] and he preaches on a present tense Jesus
[2:19:53] I told Brother Hunter
[2:19:55] about the guarantee what I was looking
[2:19:57] for
[2:19:58] and brother Hunter got a crooked little
[2:20:00] finger because it was broken way back
[2:20:02] when and he put that crooked finger in
[2:20:04] my face just like that and he said young
[2:20:06] man what you need is the Holy Ghost
[2:20:10] well my initial reaction was I got the
[2:20:13] Holy Ghost I spoke in tongues I've run
[2:20:14] the house I've shouted I got the Holy
[2:20:17] Ghost
[2:20:18] but then he handed me a tape one day
[2:20:19] called thinking man's filter
[2:20:22] and I put that tape in because I wanted
[2:20:24] to hear about this man that he was
[2:20:25] calling a prophet even though I didn't
[2:20:27] know that he I didn't actually think
[2:20:29] that he was Malachi 4 5 at the time
[2:20:32] you know I was going to study and show
[2:20:34] him how that they were wrong on that so
[2:20:36] I put the tape in and I'm going down the
[2:20:39] highway one day and brother Branham says
[2:20:42] and any man
[2:20:44] that will look upon a woman with painted
[2:20:46] lips
[2:20:47] short shorts and doesn't condemn her and
[2:20:51] say that's a Jezebel spirit he needs a
[2:20:53] trip to the altar himself
[2:20:54] and I turned the tape off
[2:20:58] and I said to myself I didn't say it out
[2:21:01] loud there wasn't anybody in the car to
[2:21:02] say it to but I said in my heart
[2:21:04] you're an old man brother Branham I'm 27
[2:21:07] years old
[2:21:08] and they look good to me
[2:21:12] I went on with my business that day I
[2:21:14] got ready to go home I put the tape back
[2:21:17] in
[2:21:19] and it had backed up a little bit and
[2:21:20] brother Branham says any man
[2:21:23] I knew what was coming next
[2:21:25] and I'm like I'm I'm at least going to
[2:21:28] hear him out
[2:21:30] needs a trip to the altar
[2:21:32] and some little Ricky come up to me
[2:21:34] outside the Tabernacle the other night
[2:21:36] and said brother Branham I'm a young man
[2:21:38] you're old of course you'd think that
[2:21:40] way but I'm young I still think they
[2:21:42] look pretty
[2:21:44] he said
[2:21:45] I looked at him and said young man when
[2:21:47] I was your age I thought they had a
[2:21:49] Jezebel spirit
[2:21:53] I pulled that tape out of that tape
[2:21:55] player I looked at it
[2:21:58] now I was I was struggling with was he a
[2:22:00] prophet or was he not a prophet
[2:22:03] I looked at that tape and that still
[2:22:06] small voice inside said
[2:22:09] How could a man
[2:22:12] in 1963
[2:22:16] know what you were going to think
[2:22:20] in 1984 and put it on a tape for you
[2:22:26] I said a man couldn't do that
[2:22:31] this is probably a prophet
[2:22:36] so I go to church and brother Hunter
[2:22:37] comes out and he's preaching
[2:22:40] the Lord moved in a supernatural way in
[2:22:42] the morning service he comes back into
[2:22:43] evening service which was not his usual
[2:22:45] mannerism
[2:22:47] and he says I didn't get done this
[2:22:50] morning and then he stops and he said
[2:22:52] excuse me he didn't get done
[2:22:55] there's someone here tonight
[2:22:57] that needs
[2:22:59] a present tense Jesus in their life
[2:23:03] and he reiterated what he had preached
[2:23:04] that morning you don't need Jesus in a
[2:23:06] manger you don't need Jesus on the
[2:23:08] shores of Galilee you don't need Jesus
[2:23:11] even hanging on a cross you need the
[2:23:13] resurrected Jesus living inside of you
[2:23:19] brother Hunter stayed up on the pulpit
[2:23:21] and preached
[2:23:22] I'm sitting about where my wife is
[2:23:23] sitting right here
[2:23:25] but a being
[2:23:27] a real live being
[2:23:31] unseen
[2:23:33] came down that aisle stopped at my Pew
[2:23:36] and stood between me I was standing by
[2:23:39] that time
[2:23:40] stood between me and that Pew in front
[2:23:42] of me there wasn't room for a being
[2:23:44] there but there was a being there
[2:23:46] and in the presence of Jesus Christ who
[2:23:49] I recognized it was him
[2:23:51] in the presence of Jesus Christ I
[2:23:53] repented
[2:23:54] I'd been baptized
[2:23:58] I began to confess everything I'd ever
[2:24:00] done wrong
[2:24:03] I felt like it took me an hour and a
[2:24:05] half
[2:24:07] I talked to him I told him everything
[2:24:10] I told him every lie I told him when I
[2:24:12] was a kid I told him everything I'd ever
[2:24:14] stolen I told him every evil thought I'd
[2:24:16] ever had I told him everything
[2:24:19] and at the end of me
[2:24:21] I was spent by the time I got done by
[2:24:24] the time I got done talking to him
[2:24:27] come here Paul
[2:24:30] please
[2:24:33] we're standing this close me and the
[2:24:36] Lord stand in this close
[2:24:38] I didn't see him but I knew that he was
[2:24:40] there
[2:24:42] and when I got finished
[2:24:44] I felt two arms
[2:24:46] wrap around me and hug me up like this
[2:24:49] and he said thank you you can be seated
[2:24:51] he said
[2:24:53] I already knew all that
[2:24:57] you're mine
[2:24:59] I come to claim you
[2:25:02] I am going to live inside of you
[2:25:06] thank you
[2:25:07] and the devil immediately said your wife
[2:25:09] is going to divorce you over this she
[2:25:12] will not follow you into this cult
[2:25:16] and I heard myself say brother Samuel
[2:25:19] my wife can divorce me
[2:25:22] and leave me tomorrow
[2:25:24] but I have to have you Lord
[2:25:30] he said your mom and dad's going to
[2:25:32] disown you they're not going to agree
[2:25:34] with this
[2:25:35] I said my mom and dad can disown me I
[2:25:38] don't care if I have any inheritance
[2:25:40] ever but I'm not leaving this building
[2:25:43] until I have you in here
[2:25:47] he said your boss is going to call you a
[2:25:50] kook and he's going to fire you because
[2:25:53] he doesn't want a weirdo working for him
[2:25:56] I said if I'm on the street begging for
[2:25:59] food
[2:26:00] I've got to have you Lord I'm not
[2:26:03] leaving this place without you
[2:26:06] and that being that was standing in
[2:26:07] front of me moved inside
[2:26:11] now my recollection at that point is
[2:26:15] I slammed back into my seat where I was
[2:26:17] sitting and I kicked and I screamed and
[2:26:21] I squawed and I praised the Lord because
[2:26:24] I had never felt that glorious in my
[2:26:27] life and for a good 45 minutes I just
[2:26:32] shouted and praised the Lord
[2:26:34] so we leave the service that night we go
[2:26:36] home we're getting ready for bed I'm
[2:26:37] laying down on the bed she comes out of
[2:26:40] the restroom or the bathroom and she
[2:26:42] says that was certainly a good service
[2:26:44] tonight I said yes it was
[2:26:46] and I looked at her and I said I got my
[2:26:48] guarantee
[2:26:49] and she looks at me and she goes you
[2:26:52] what because I told her I was looking
[2:26:54] for a guarantee she said you what I said
[2:26:56] didn't you see me I got my guarantee
[2:26:58] tonight
[2:26:59] she said really I said yeah I kicked I
[2:27:03] screamed I I the whole church had to
[2:27:06] have heard me she said no David you just
[2:27:08] sat there in the Pew and cried
[2:27:11] I said oh no
[2:27:12] oh no don't don't still don't steal my
[2:27:17] my experience
[2:27:18] I kicked I screamed I shouted I cried I
[2:27:22] glorified God
[2:27:23] she goes no baby you just sit there and
[2:27:26] cry
[2:27:27] so the next Tuesday that was on a Sunday
[2:27:30] night the next Tuesday I had to go to
[2:27:32] Indianapolis
[2:27:33] my business
[2:27:35] and I'm driving down the road and I put
[2:27:38] thinking man's filter back in now again
[2:27:41] I can't explain to you how it backed up
[2:27:44] but when I put it in
[2:27:46] the first words I heard was any man
[2:27:51] looks upon a woman
[2:27:53] lust after in his heart
[2:27:56] and something down inside said Amen
[2:27:58] brother Brown amen that's the truth
[2:28:02] [Applause]
[2:28:09] that after or that morning I'm in
[2:28:12] Indianapolis a place called Castleton
[2:28:14] Mall
[2:28:15] you know how malls have wings you know
[2:28:17] with the storage down different Wings
[2:28:18] I'm walking down I had to buy some
[2:28:21] office supplies I'm walking down this
[2:28:23] Wing getting ready to turn into this
[2:28:24] Wing where the office supply place was
[2:28:27] and two young ladies now this is January
[2:28:30] the 8th 1985. it was not above freezing
[2:28:35] that day I can I don't know the exact
[2:28:37] temperature but I know it was not above
[2:28:39] freezing that day and two young women
[2:28:41] come walking around the corner
[2:28:44] of that store on from One Wing to the
[2:28:46] next wing and they had halter tops on
[2:28:48] and short shorts
[2:28:52] and as soon as they come around the
[2:28:53] corner and I looked at them where
[2:28:56] the week before I would have undressed
[2:28:58] them with my eyes
[2:29:00] when they come around that corner I
[2:29:02] thought oh my goodness don't they know
[2:29:05] they've got a Jezebel spirit on them
[2:29:07] Lord help them
[2:29:09] and I stopped in the middle of Castleton
[2:29:11] Mall I threw both hands up in the air
[2:29:13] and I said God David Hoover doesn't
[2:29:16] think like that you've done something
[2:29:19] real down inside of me
[2:29:27] the next Sunday brother George Martin
[2:29:29] from South Africa was our special
[2:29:31] speaker
[2:29:33] now again you bear with me
[2:29:36] I'm just being transparent
[2:29:44] brother George Martin preached himself
[2:29:45] into a as my grandmother used to say he
[2:29:49] preached himself into a dither
[2:29:51] his shirt was soaked his tie was soaked
[2:29:54] his suit coat was soaked from sweating
[2:29:57] he preached so hard
[2:30:00] now
[2:30:03] I grew up with a bunch of Southern
[2:30:05] self-righteousness I was prejudiced
[2:30:09] I'm telling you only for the glory of
[2:30:11] God I hated people that were black I
[2:30:13] hated Hispanic people
[2:30:16] in my store that I ran if there was a
[2:30:19] white person shopping in my store and a
[2:30:22] black person came in I would leave that
[2:30:24] white person even though it was probably
[2:30:26] a guaranteed sale and I would go watch
[2:30:28] that black person
[2:30:30] and I trained my my sales people to do
[2:30:32] that I'm ashamed of that but I'm trying
[2:30:34] to show you what Jesus Christ can do
[2:30:37] what happens when you meet him
[2:30:41] and so I used to play basketball I
[2:30:45] wasn't ever any good at it but I loved
[2:30:46] to play basketball
[2:30:49] and
[2:30:52] I didn't like to play when there was
[2:30:54] black Brothers on the black men on the
[2:30:56] court
[2:30:59] because they get to sweating and I
[2:31:01] didn't want to be around them
[2:31:03] so that evening after service
[2:31:06] brother George is still in his sweaty
[2:31:07] suit clothes suit coat and his shirt and
[2:31:10] everything and brother Hunter comes to
[2:31:11] me and the vest will be on and says
[2:31:13] would you like to meet Brother Martin
[2:31:14] I said sure
[2:31:16] he said follow me and you had to go out
[2:31:18] of the vestibule and down the side and
[2:31:20] into the back room of the of the church
[2:31:22] and so he's leading me down through
[2:31:25] there
[2:31:26] and I walk in the door and brother
[2:31:29] George Martin steps out of the pastor's
[2:31:31] office and he's standing there soaked
[2:31:33] with sweat and he holds his hand out to
[2:31:36] me and he says God bless you brother and
[2:31:38] I grabbed that man like this and I
[2:31:40] hugged him up to me and I said God bless
[2:31:42] you brother that was a wonderful message
[2:31:44] that helped me so much
[2:31:47] and as soon as I hug that black man up
[2:31:49] to me something said
[2:31:51] you have never hugged a black person in
[2:31:55] your life what are you doing
[2:31:57] and I realized that Jesus Christ had set
[2:32:01] me free
[2:32:09] and to this day
[2:32:11] if somebody speaks about a person
[2:32:13] because of their race
[2:32:15] there's something that rises up in me
[2:32:17] and I go excuse me
[2:32:19] but we don't talk about my brothers and
[2:32:21] sisters like that
[2:32:29] and since that day I don't have a single
[2:32:32] experience to tell you about the greed
[2:32:33] but since that day I've had all kinds
[2:32:36] I've been in sales all my life
[2:32:39] I've not had a man I've worked for
[2:32:41] myself now the Lord made it where sister
[2:32:43] Genie and I own our own insurance agency
[2:32:45] but up until the time that I own my own
[2:32:48] agency I always had a sales manager
[2:32:51] always somebody that owned the company
[2:32:54] and every single job I've ever been on
[2:32:56] since January the 6th 1985 I've been
[2:33:00] called into the office and sat down at
[2:33:02] the manager's desk
[2:33:04] and I've heard these words
[2:33:06] David
[2:33:08] you
[2:33:10] you just frustrate me
[2:33:13] what do you mean what am I doing wrong
[2:33:16] you have opportunity after opportunity
[2:33:19] after opportunity if if I could just get
[2:33:22] the fire in your belly
[2:33:24] the way the the abilities that you have
[2:33:28] and the skills that you have you should
[2:33:30] be a millionaire and you let sail after
[2:33:33] sell after sale go by I don't understand
[2:33:36] you
[2:33:40] and I heard that so many times finally I
[2:33:42] looked at the one manager and I said you
[2:33:45] don't remember what happened on January
[2:33:47] the 6th 1985 he goes what in the world
[2:33:50] happened let me let me help you fix it I
[2:33:53] said I don't want it fixed
[2:33:54] I said up until that day I was as greedy
[2:33:58] as anybody out there and I would go for
[2:34:00] the jugular every time but since that
[2:34:02] day I can't do that to somebody there's
[2:34:05] something down inside of me that says
[2:34:06] make sure the other guy gets as good a
[2:34:08] deal as you're getting
[2:34:16] so
[2:34:18] let me wrap this up
[2:34:20] who am I talking to this morning
[2:34:23] who's he talking to this morning
[2:34:27] perhaps you've heard about Jesus perhaps
[2:34:30] you've set in Sunday school all your
[2:34:31] life and you've been taught about Jesus
[2:34:37] but I want to ask you a question this
[2:34:38] morning
[2:34:41] not because of what David Hoover
[2:34:43] has been through or anything but have
[2:34:45] you really encountered Jesus Christ
[2:34:49] have you met the one I met and has he
[2:34:52] become as real to you to where it's no
[2:34:55] longer stories
[2:34:57] you see now I understand why he touched
[2:35:00] me when I was just an infant I had no
[2:35:03] faith brother Samuel
[2:35:05] I had no good deed to bring to him I had
[2:35:08] nothing I could lay at his feet and say
[2:35:10] God I'm going to be a good boy and so I
[2:35:13] deserve this healing nothing
[2:35:15] but he healed me
[2:35:17] he healed me for a purpose he healed me
[2:35:20] for a reason
[2:35:21] perhaps it's for that person that's
[2:35:23] sitting here listening this morning
[2:35:25] let me just ask you something
[2:35:29] what's life thrown at you
[2:35:32] all right
[2:35:34] what is it that you're facing what
[2:35:35] mountain are you facing this morning
[2:35:37] what is it that you can't overcome you
[2:35:40] see I tried to get free of the lust I
[2:35:42] tried to get rid of the racism I tried
[2:35:44] to get rid of the greed I turned leaves
[2:35:47] I turn leaves I turn leaves every year
[2:35:50] I'd make a resolution on New Year's I'm
[2:35:53] not going to do that anymore
[2:35:55] and the next week I'd be right back in
[2:35:57] the in the muck in the mire
[2:36:01] but when I met him
[2:36:04] he changed me from the inside out and
[2:36:07] that's what he wants to do for you this
[2:36:08] morning
[2:36:11] where's your life taking you
[2:36:14] stop for a moment young person
[2:36:16] middle-aged person older person just
[2:36:19] stop for a moment and answer this
[2:36:21] question to him not to me
[2:36:24] that road that you're on right now
[2:36:26] those secrets that Mom and Dad don't
[2:36:29] know anything about
[2:36:30] those websites that you go to that you
[2:36:33] know you shouldn't go to but yet
[2:36:34] something compels you and forces you to
[2:36:37] go to them
[2:36:38] where's that road going to lead to where
[2:36:41] are you going to wind up at
[2:36:45] Jesus Christ cares enough about you
[2:36:49] that he sent me
[2:36:51] a little Old Kentucky preacher's kid
[2:36:54] that never deserved anything but yet he
[2:36:57] did something in my life he sent me on
[2:36:59] my vacation wouldn't let your pastor
[2:37:01] take no for an answer so that I could
[2:37:03] testify to you this morning because he
[2:37:06] is knocking at your heart's door and
[2:37:08] trying to wake you up and make you
[2:37:10] realize if I would do it for David
[2:37:12] Hoover
[2:37:13] I'd surely do it for you
[2:37:21] I'm here to testify this morning that
[2:37:23] Jesus is larger than life
[2:37:26] I had a life I had a plan
[2:37:30] I had ambitions
[2:37:32] but I found out Jesus is larger than
[2:37:35] that
[2:37:38] his plan brother Paul for my life was so
[2:37:41] much beyond what I could ever dream or
[2:37:43] what I could ever think
[2:37:46] what's he wanting to do in your life if
[2:37:48] you'll just yield to him
[2:37:51] musicians come I'm finishing up
[2:37:54] you see
[2:37:56] Jesus Christ is larger than your opinion
[2:38:01] he's larger than your idea of how things
[2:38:04] should be
[2:38:06] he's larger than your situation oh
[2:38:08] brother Hoover I hear it so many times
[2:38:10] brother Hoover you don't know my
[2:38:12] situation
[2:38:13] I don't need to know your situation I
[2:38:16] just need you to meet Jesus Christ the
[2:38:18] same one that I met because he is larger
[2:38:20] than that situation that you're going
[2:38:22] through
[2:38:27] he's larger than your failures
[2:38:30] he's larger than your hopes and dreams
[2:38:33] he's larger than your attempt at
[2:38:35] self-righteousness
[2:38:39] the Bible says in Matthew the fifth
[2:38:41] chapter and the 20th verse Jesus
[2:38:43] speaking said
[2:38:45] accept your righteousness exceeds
[2:38:48] the righteousness of the Pharisees
[2:38:51] you will in no wise enter the kingdom of
[2:38:54] God
[2:38:56] brother Hoover
[2:38:59] I was raised in this church
[2:39:01] this is the only church I've ever known
[2:39:04] president Samuel Browning is my pastor
[2:39:07] I believe God sent a prophet I believe
[2:39:10] that there's a message
[2:39:15] but can you live it
[2:39:20] and the answer to that question is no
[2:39:22] you can't
[2:39:23] but he can through you
[2:39:28] so all of your attempts all of your
[2:39:30] trying and pushing
[2:39:33] [Music]
[2:39:37] my God's larger than your hurts
[2:39:39] I don't know what scars you're bearing
[2:39:41] in your spirit
[2:39:44] I just know he's bigger
[2:39:46] I know he's greater
[2:39:50] [Music]
[2:39:53] he's larger than your doctrines
[2:39:58] he's larger than you're proven that you
[2:40:00] could do it on your own
[2:40:03] Jesus Christ wants to be larger than
[2:40:06] your life
[2:40:12] but the prophet of God says
[2:40:16] in a prayer one day he said God
[2:40:19] I thank you
[2:40:21] that you have always worked through
[2:40:23] human instrumentality
[2:40:26] you always do
[2:40:29] I don't know what that means to you but
[2:40:31] in trying to be very brief and getting
[2:40:33] close
[2:40:35] this brother over here
[2:40:38] he is going to encounter people that I
[2:40:40] never encounter
[2:40:43] [Music]
[2:40:45] and God wants to use that human
[2:40:46] instrument right there
[2:40:49] [Music]
[2:40:50] these instruments up here this
[2:40:52] instrument this sister is playing
[2:40:55] without her sitting here
[2:40:58] there's no sound
[2:41:01] but God
[2:41:03] puts a gift in a sister's life
[2:41:05] and she sits down at that keyboard and
[2:41:08] she begins to play
[2:41:11] and you know what we do
[2:41:14] we don't say
[2:41:16] oh our sister she did this she did that
[2:41:19] we begin to praise God
[2:41:22] that's the same with this brother I
[2:41:24] don't know why I'm choosing you brother
[2:41:25] I'm just the Lord just pointing you out
[2:41:28] to me
[2:41:29] God looks at this man sitting over here
[2:41:32] and he goes there's somebody in his life
[2:41:38] that he's going to encounter brother
[2:41:40] Samuel may never I may never
[2:41:45] I just need an instrument
[2:41:48] [Music]
[2:41:50] God you always work through human
[2:41:52] instrumentality
[2:41:55] what's he want to do in your life I
[2:41:58] don't know
[2:41:59] but you know that he's the one talking
[2:42:00] to you right now you know this preacher
[2:42:02] from Southern Indiana doesn't know your
[2:42:05] situation but somehow through this
[2:42:07] message through my stumbling words and
[2:42:09] everything he has gotten to your
[2:42:11] attention and he's knocked on your heart
[2:42:16] you don't have to come tell me you don't
[2:42:18] even have to tell brother Samuel Just
[2:42:20] Surrender to him right now where you set
[2:42:24] you say oh I'm supposed to come to the
[2:42:26] altar you don't have to
[2:42:28] just yield Just Surrender
[2:42:34] let me finish with this
[2:42:39] perfect strength and perfect weakness
[2:42:41] 1961 brother Branham says but when we
[2:42:44] are thinking that we are able to do it
[2:42:46] then God can't use us because we're
[2:42:48] wanting to do it ourselves
[2:42:51] and then the other side we get these
[2:42:53] feelings and we think that we're
[2:42:55] insufficient and we don't want to do it
[2:42:57] but then if we just listen to the call
[2:42:59] of God that's the very thing that God
[2:43:02] wants us to get into that kind of shape
[2:43:04] so he can
[2:43:06] when we are insufficient ourselves then
[2:43:09] we are subjects to yield to God's spirit
[2:43:11] as long as we think that we can do it
[2:43:14] then we can't do it but when we get to a
[2:43:17] place where we know we can't do it then
[2:43:19] we yield ourselves to God and he does it
[2:43:22] so then if it's us trying to do it we'll
[2:43:25] fail but if we'll just yield ourselves
[2:43:27] to God then God can't fail there's only
[2:43:30] one thing that God cannot do and that's
[2:43:32] fail he can do anything else but fail
[2:43:34] but he cannot fail so as long as we are
[2:43:38] trying in ourselves and depending on our
[2:43:40] own abilities and so forth well we'll do
[2:43:43] nothing but when we get to a place where
[2:43:45] we know we're nothing then God can use
[2:43:48] us the important thing one of the
[2:43:51] important things that we must Master now
[2:43:55] remember this and especially you young
[2:43:57] preachers and lay members alike there's
[2:43:59] one thing that we've got to master if we
[2:44:02] expect to fulfill God's desire in our
[2:44:04] life that is
[2:44:06] we have to master the thought
[2:44:09] of human ability
[2:44:15] some of you are sitting here and you're
[2:44:18] pretty proud of yourselves and you
[2:44:20] realize
[2:44:22] I've got some Talent I've got some skill
[2:44:28] as long as you have the talent and you
[2:44:30] have the skill
[2:44:32] God can't use you
[2:44:35] and some of you are sitting on the other
[2:44:37] end of the spectrum and you're thinking
[2:44:39] I'm nothing I don't have any talent I
[2:44:43] don't have any skill
[2:44:46] and brother Branham is telling us
[2:44:49] you've got to bring that human mind
[2:44:51] under the control of the Holy Spirit and
[2:44:54] you've got to quit thinking about
[2:44:55] whether you have ability or you don't
[2:44:58] have ability what you have to do this
[2:45:00] morning is you have to turn it over to
[2:45:02] Jesus Christ
[2:45:04] and say God
[2:45:05] I'm nothing
[2:45:08] my abilities my skills my talents
[2:45:11] they're nothing without you lord
[2:45:14] and those of you that are sitting here
[2:45:15] thinking
[2:45:17] I'm a nobody
[2:45:18] God can't use me
[2:45:21] you have to give that up and say God
[2:45:24] all I got is Five Loaves and two fishes
[2:45:28] all I got is
[2:45:31] this love for you and this desire to
[2:45:33] please you but I'm going to turn it over
[2:45:35] to you this morning Lord I'm going to
[2:45:37] give it to you
[2:45:40] whatever you want to do
[2:45:43] Lord
[2:45:45] I'm Yours
[2:45:49] it's about our heads
[2:45:51] [Music]
[2:45:53] Heavenly Father
[2:45:55] I've been obedient to what you asked me
[2:45:57] to do
[2:45:59] I've realized Lord dear Jesus that
[2:46:00] there's nothing that I have said Lord
[2:46:03] that was so astounding or or so great
[2:46:07] that I could Pat myself on the back or I
[2:46:09] could say look what I did Lord I realize
[2:46:11] that this is something that you laid on
[2:46:13] My Heart Lord before I ever
[2:46:15] before I ever left the house and
[2:46:18] Fredericksburg Lord you came down and
[2:46:21] told me in the room this is what I want
[2:46:22] you to put on paper this is what I want
[2:46:24] you to wind up with
[2:46:26] Lord I've been obedient I don't know I
[2:46:29] have no ability to go back there and
[2:46:31] touch people's hearts and lives like
[2:46:33] you're doing right now I have no ability
[2:46:35] to get a person to yield I can only tell
[2:46:37] them Lord what would happen if they
[2:46:39] yield to you if they yield their
[2:46:41] instrument
[2:46:42] I don't know what the instrument's
[2:46:44] supposed to do I don't know what they
[2:46:46] are supposed to make what kind of music
[2:46:47] they're supposed to make what kind of of
[2:46:50] writing that they're supposed to do I
[2:46:52] don't know Lord
[2:46:55] but God you've got a purpose and a plan
[2:46:57] for each person that's under the sound
[2:46:58] of my voice right now and you've spoken
[2:47:00] to us this morning Lord
[2:47:03] I've done my best to yield to you now I
[2:47:06] ask Lord that this people would yield to
[2:47:07] you
[2:47:09] and let your Holy Spirit take control
[2:47:12] Lord believing with all of my heart
[2:47:14] there's testimonies
[2:47:16] Lord it might just be a card that
[2:47:18] somebody sets down at their table and
[2:47:19] writes to another person that's going
[2:47:21] through a trial
[2:47:22] it might just be a song or a poem it
[2:47:25] might just be
[2:47:27] a God bless you
[2:47:29] to just somebody walking down the
[2:47:31] sidewalk I don't know God
[2:47:33] you do
[2:47:35] Lord you know my plan you know my idea
[2:47:38] about this was to just come and sneak in
[2:47:40] this morning but God you had something
[2:47:42] different
[2:47:43] [Music]
[2:47:45] so I'm
[2:47:47] I'm just simple enough to believe God
[2:47:49] that you're going to take it to
[2:47:51] the fruition of what you saw before the
[2:47:55] foundations of the earth and you're
[2:47:57] going to work in people's lives in ways
[2:48:00] that they don't even think is possible
[2:48:03] have your way Lord Jesus
[2:48:06] have your way

[2:53:46] I kept the kids coming to my heart as I

[2:53:51] brother Brown talks about there's a
[2:53:52] couple times where
[2:53:55] he said it was a situation in a in a
[2:53:57] meeting
[2:53:59] you don't hear him say this one too much
[2:54:00] but
[2:54:02] he said it was a
[2:54:03] it was a black sister in her her
[2:54:06] daughter were in the meeting
[2:54:09] and they begin to
[2:54:11] the Holy Spirit was actually drawing and
[2:54:13] working personally upon their lives
[2:54:16] among others
[2:54:17] but they didn't heed to it
[2:54:22] and when they didn't heed to it
[2:54:25] here they were you know God knows what
[2:54:27] lays ahead
[2:54:29] and I'm not saying an accident lays
[2:54:31] ahead in your future I'm just saying
[2:54:33] that you don't want your future without
[2:54:35] him
[2:54:36] if you've gone a moment without him
[2:54:40] you've gone a moment too long
[2:54:43] they left that meeting
[2:54:45] and they were in a car accident
[2:54:48] and her brother Ram describes that he
[2:54:50] said his
[2:54:51] they were there and laying on that
[2:54:54] asphalt
[2:54:56] and the little the daughter not little
[2:54:58] but the daughter looked over to Mom and
[2:55:00] said Mom
[2:55:01] we should have heeded the call tonight
[2:55:04] we should have yielded to that and we
[2:55:07] didn't
[2:55:10] I think that's something that how the
[2:55:13] Holy Spirit has applied and taken this
[2:55:15] word to every one of our hearts
[2:55:19] one thing about it
[2:55:21] God has always moved
[2:55:23] when we're honest
[2:55:25] because he's honest enough to come and
[2:55:27] speak to our hearts
[2:55:31] and what he Delights in
[2:55:34] is honesty back to him
[2:55:38] I wouldn't want to go out of here
[2:55:42] and leave this presence without having
[2:55:45] yielded
[2:55:47] Sammy you don't know what I have ahead
[2:55:49] of me today but let me tell you if you
[2:55:52] don't know him in that way
[2:55:54] what you have going on later today
[2:55:58] nowhere near
[2:56:00] and close to this moment
[2:56:04] to have a personal meeting with the Lord
[2:56:06] Jesus Christ
[2:56:08] [Music]
[2:56:09] and the whole key just like as the Lord
[2:56:11] took brother Hoover to say it and bring
[2:56:13] it all the way down
[2:56:15] in our lives it's to yield
[2:56:18] it's to yields
[2:56:20] sometimes we can wrestle around and kick
[2:56:23] around and everything I'm talking about
[2:56:25] sometimes in our spirit but it's
[2:56:27] yielding to him
[2:56:28] brother Brian said it like this in
[2:56:30] restoration of the Bride tree he said
[2:56:32] yield to him and he will take you to the
[2:56:37] Holy Ghost
[2:56:39] he will take you to your healing I can't
[2:56:42] get there you can't get there but God
[2:56:46] takes us there
[2:56:48] and I believe that I believe right here
[2:56:51] this morning it's not something I'm
[2:56:53] looking for I don't want I want you to
[2:56:55] understand it's not something we're
[2:56:56] looking for out here it's not even
[2:56:59] something that you're looking for some
[2:57:02] emotion
[2:57:04] it's him
[2:57:06] sure
[2:57:07] emotions will come
[2:57:10] but we're all different
[2:57:13] they're all different whether you have
[2:57:15] emotion or not doesn't mean anything
[2:57:18] because a person could have all sorts of
[2:57:20] emotion and there'd be no change
[2:57:25] it's got to be where he comes down
[2:57:28] to the innermost place
[2:57:30] where he takes his rest
[2:57:33] and where when he takes his rest like
[2:57:36] God
[2:57:37] on the seventh day cease from his own
[2:57:39] works
[2:57:41] you cease from your own works
[2:57:45] Christ in you
[2:57:47] brings rest
[2:57:49] and I to me
[2:57:53] I know brother Hoover I'm glad he took
[2:57:55] his time
[2:57:57] and I believe this I've said it back in
[2:57:59] the office and I believe it as I stand
[2:58:00] right here
[2:58:01] the Lord was taking him down these
[2:58:03] pathways
[2:58:04] I believe this is a predestinated moment
[2:58:08] I believe every service is but I believe
[2:58:11] this is a predestinated moment there
[2:58:13] were no plans of him being here
[2:58:15] until he sat next to me last Saturday
[2:58:18] and I started to figure out he was going
[2:58:21] to be around
[2:58:23] to me
[2:58:24] God ordained this
[2:58:27] and I just would say like this you know
[2:58:29] if you need prayer we're here to pray
[2:58:31] with you
[2:58:33] don't let the moment pass you up
[2:58:36] don't let Satan keep your back under
[2:58:38] Pride
[2:58:39] don't
[2:58:40] just let go
[2:58:41] let God have his way
[2:58:43] but Samuel it's a little bit later in
[2:58:45] the day but
[2:58:48] this is a moment with him
[2:58:50] I don't know you may not have this
[2:58:52] moment again I don't know I can't
[2:58:54] promise that but I know this one thing
[2:58:56] no matter what it is in your life
[2:58:59] if you need to know the Lord Jesus in a
[2:59:02] personal way he's here
[2:59:04] I say I've tried a lot of other times
[2:59:06] but have you yielded see have you
[2:59:08] yielded
[2:59:09] and what about
[2:59:11] even those as brother Hoover brought
[2:59:14] that quote around that you know the Lord
[2:59:17] but you realize God I'm still using a
[2:59:20] lot of my own abilities
[2:59:23] and you want to say Lord
[2:59:25] I want to surrender all my abilities and
[2:59:28] thoughts of that
[2:59:30] I believe he's here
[2:59:32] I believe it's here a matter of fact I
[2:59:34] know he's here
[2:59:36] and he's here
[2:59:38] to minister to our needs the Bible said
[2:59:41] the Lord was present to heal them and
[2:59:45] that God is here to presently to heal
[2:59:47] not only physically but spiritually
[2:59:51] thank you
[2:59:51] he's the same God I wouldn't let one
[2:59:54] situation I wouldn't let a complex I
[2:59:57] wouldn't nothing hold me back
[2:59:59] from touching Jesus
