to your riches and glory may you just bless your children now we pray we just give ourselves to you Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen man you just give us unto the Lord first we want to look in the scriptures here this morning in thank you musicians we want to look here in the scriptures in in first chronicles chapter 12 is what I'd like to go it's good to see each and every one here and amen some of them some of us back and been able to be together and some back from sickness and other things it's so good to be back together in the house of the Lord amen I'm just gonna read through just a few scriptures here and I'm just going to skip through here and not reading all of them but I'm just going to skip to certain verses and first chronicles chapter 1 now these are they that came to David to zig lag while he kept himself close because of saw the son of Kish and they were among the mighty men helpers of the war they were armed with bows and could use both the right hand and the left they were balanced people they could use both the right hand and the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a bow even of Saul's brethren of Benjamin verse 8 and of the gadites who they're separated themselves unto David into the hole to the wilderness men of might men of war fit for the battle that could handle shield and buckler whose faces were like the faces of lions this was the anointing that was a poner it was fixing to transition from lamb to lion whose faces were like the faces of Lions Lions King right and were swift as the Rose upon the mountains they could move they weren't tied down they could move they could be led a man verse 23 and these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to the war and came to David to Hebron to turn the kingdom of Saul to him according to the word of the Lord verse 28 I love how God just puts these things in here verse 28 and Zadok a young man mighty of Valor so as young people you don't have to wait til you're all of a sudden of a certain age to be a mighty man of Valor remember a mighty man of Valor is not somebody who is older aged chronologically it's just to have the mighty God in you amen you're a mighty man of Valor with him in you and of his father's house 20 and two captains verse 32 and of the children of Issachar watch what look where this is at which were men that had understanding of the times to know what Israel ought to do the heads of them were two hundred and all their brethren were at their commandment of Zebulun such as went forth to battle expert in war with all instruments of war fifty thousand which could keep rank they were not of double heart verse 37 and on the other side of Jordan of the Reuben nights and the gadites and of the half tribe of manasseh and all manner of instruments with all manner of instruments of war for the battle one hundred and twenty thousand and these men of war that could keep rank came with a perfect heart to Hebron to make David king over all Israel and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David King amen god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I think it is so astounding many times and perhaps as certain as a Bible reader this morning you have looked over this passage of Scripture in Chronicles and also in the book of Samuel and to see the characteristics of those men that would join themselves unto David remember that each one when we could read through portions here in the in the chapter even when they would come and desire to join themselves to David you realize this was something it was not something like and bear with me for saying it this way this was not a club this was not something of just a group of people getting together they were moved to come to Hebron because they recognized God is with David and David has been anointed king now there with all of them who come remember Saul had been and was the people's choice he had been anointed and he was the people's choice yet God because of Saul's self-will and his disobedience God removed the kingdom from Saul and as we were looking at that last week that the kingdom itself is the person of Almighty God when he read that kingdom he said I've rented and I given it to to thy neighbor to one that is close to thee notice it never was announced out publicly who it was that had been anointed king as a matter of fact the prophet Samuel when you read in the scripture he was concerned when God told him to go and who to anoint and yet remember he had just had said of the house of Jesse I have chosen unto me 1 and here you know Samuel asked he said how how am I gonna get to be able to go there and to do this I'm paraphrasing and he says how am I gonna be able to do this remember what God how he hid the coming of the anointing he hid the coming of the anointing in a sacrifice he said go there to that of the house of Jesse and when it is asked why are you going you tell them you are going to offer sacrifice and we recognize that there's no other way that the true anointing had come then by the true sacrifice it took the true sacrifice of Almighty God becoming one of us that then and through that time barnicle that he himself had had had purposed and had created then that he might be able to shed his blood and pay the price for you and I that that same life could come back upon you and I has as worshipers and bring us into his victory and yet remember it was all something that even as brother Brennan would dramatize it Satan himself could not even understand what was going on when he was watching him walk up the hill of Calvary and taking the the the cross he couldn't figure out what was going on remember every one of them that had even been of a witness or having that of a witness before Abel and on down remember they were awaiting in paradise they had been stung with the sting of death and they had raised naught but this one was different this this one itself this was here God coming down and coming to redeem you and I this was one who was able to take that sting of death and to be able to overcome to take the sin debt to pay that to raise again and to bring you and I into that place in his victory where we can live a triumphant life Oh mine too now to think of this these examples of characteristics as I was saying moments ago when you look at the characteristics that laid here in the scriptures many times I've just looked over these things within the years and perhaps you are to to see how God would identify the characteristics of these individuals they were they were ready to war they were expert in war they could shoot and hurl stones with left and with right and there are certain characteristics that God would would would point out that was within their hearts and let me just say this to you I believe with in all my heart that it was not of their natural abilities but I believe that it was what they had yielded themselves to recognize what God was doing presently in that hour when they came together they came together as the scripture said right here for one heart there was one purpose they were coming together and that was to land that was to burn the kingdom of Saul to David it was for that there was one purpose throughout at all and that was indeed to make David King and to think of how that within it their scriptures that would point out how that they were able to keep rank that that that is mentioned a couple of times in here and it speaks of how that within being able to keep rank or within a battle line you realize that maybe perhaps you don't but yet having having and being a Bey able to keep rank as a very important thing there are things that even as I stood on the battlefield there in Gettysburg a few years ago I stood and stood in certain places heard it told over and over in our days that were there of how that because there were some who begin to in their mind begin to think they could go ahead and advance without having everything in line on the Union front they almost the war was almost lost right there but when we we recognized it was all because the battle line or that which was not a rank was not holding its rank that's one of the greatest things that we can do is to hold our ranks and Army has ranks now I know some of you been in military and things like that before but could you imagine if was as such a thing has an army without any ranks you know there's such a statement that you know but you know we sometimes can say too many cooks in the kitchen you get too many cooks in the kitchen one says a little bit more salt then one said no no no no no you need a little bit more Cayenne this one no no no no no you need a little bit more this and you know the common phrase we mean there's too many cooks in the kitchen it means there's got to be somebody who is the cook in the kitchen and you see God is a God of water and it's something that is a longing within our hearts has his children that is to be in order we even see the earth today the Bible says in the book of Romans chapter a that the earth is groaning and travailing it is longing for the manifestation of the sons of God even how God has put everything when we we find even when we look at juvenile delinquency juvenile delinquency is actually the call of that of what has been forsaken by the parents it's parental delinquency that comes down there is always a desire within a life and a heart for rank and the desire in the hearts and lives of a child of God is I want to be under the Word of God I want to be under his leadership in every part of my life I don't want to I don't want to try to just take my way about things or what I think I want to know for sure Lord is this your direction is this your will because sometimes his will is not exactly what our flesh our spirit wants but our soul desires to be in his will so it's always a tremendous thing to be able to to keep rank and there are ranks within that army and we you know to think of it there are rankings even when we look even among the Angels to think of it when those angels themselves even the angels that are there and the angels that fell even those that fell and believe Lucifer's lie they never fell from the rain they still have their rank remember even when Daniel was praying in the Book of Daniel he prayed for 21 days and there was that of the Prince of Persia and then here you had that that prints there were other demons brother BAM we'll call him imps that were under them remember even as he stood in Oregon and that here brother Benson when that man came across it wasn't a man that was challenging that the presence of God it was the chief of that tribe of demons that was there and brother Bramson when they solved that their chief what had been defeated then he said people begin to get out of wheelchairs and off of cots he said because they saw that that chief demon of that area had been defeated oh I'll tell you what if we look how the Prophet within even the middle of that battle the Prophet himself he was drawn to come out in the flesh but remember now he said he recognized the Spirit of God that this is not a flesh and blood affair he even held back the policeman you see what was happening in the midst of the time he was tested to come out in the flesh but instead he submitted himself to the word of the Lord and God took over because it was God that was going to fight this battle Oh may God help us to recognize and discern over and over again we're not finding a flesh-and-blood affair no this is spiritual wickedness in high places these are these are demons that are around recognize sometimes is it so important to say God help me to have that discernment and and go and remember it's a spirit it's not that person and to recognize greater is He that is in you than he that's in the world I've said like this when we look at David's and then the Ministry here this is a body ministry where they came together and assembled there with the desire to make David King there is a burning within our heart we're in that Christ Himself has revealed himself to you and I and in us and through us that indeed he is our king we have been made as the Bible says in Revelations 1 he hath made us kings and priests unto our God and we shall reign on the earth we're not just gonna reign there in the Millennium but the reigning begins now by the reigning of his life inside of us he indeed is the king of saints there has been a crowning of our life like it would speak in the book of Isaiah we have been crowned with that diadem of beauty of God's own life this is a body ministry look at how this would even be expressed in the Song of Solomon Song of Solomon chapter 6 verse 4 thou art beautiful all my love as tearsa comely as Jerusalem terrible as an army with banners in verse 10 who is she that looketh forth as the morning fair as the moon clear as the Sun and terrible as an army with banners this what it what it would seem it was such a contrast it's speaking of the beauty that is about the bride but yet she is she is beautiful she is death in his splendor in his glory but when it comes time to fight brother she is ready to fight and stand upon that word she has within her her in an alien rights god-given rights that were given to her and it's the Spirit of God that raises up in her when the enemy would want to try to take something through to see it is the Spirit of God that raises up within her she is an army with banners with standard she is moved by the unction and the characteristic of the Holy Ghost of the word within this hour this is why brother Branham would make the statement in putting on the home of God he would see would speak to us in this manner and I love this he said God he fortified his army and he said how did he fortify himself he did it in the form of prophets apostles teachers and pastors they said now these are all officers of the church it's God's dress his inside dress notice blue grama would say God's dress he in sad dress because others can look and say all profit Oh pastor Oh apostle all the teacher all evangelists but you see sometimes that's all that a person will see but the inside dress is where the individual recognize that's not the man God is using that office but it is the word of the Lord that is coming through that office that's what's very important is not that we are identifying so much the office or the flesh but to identify that it's a living God that is speaking to us that's his inside dress it's God brother Ram would say like this he said it's God dressed up in his church it's God's dress where God's presence God's Spirit working through men aren't you glad that God still dressed up remember that every one of these officers it's not outside of the body it's in the body the ministry in this hour that we have received that we have come under in this hour he was not outside of the body it is in the body it was for the body and any office any office that denies the word very simple it's a wolf in sheep's clothing that's very simple so I tell you right now if I was linked up with any any anybody I don't care what their office I don't care what their title I don't care what their previous title was it comes down in this in this measure if you're not going to walk with this word we have nothing to fellowship about there's nothing to fellowship about I don't hate you I love you but if we have nothing to fellowship about this is my life this is what I'm looking forward to this is who I am so when we see it you know brother Brandon would say I love how he makes this statement here he said you know he said when this battle would be we would come on God said it like this he said now wait a minute I'm going to come and be in it my church myself I'm going to meet my enemy in my church I'm going to beat him on his own grounds God declares his victory through you and I he declares out that he had tried him over every every every spirit he has triumphed over everything he comes to vindicate that and brother Ram goes on to say he has said I will be with my army not only that but I'm going in my army our great warrior great triumphs were general in us the word who was made flesh and triumphed over every devil every sickness even death hell and the grave that same general is in us with us not outside of the body he is in his body his body is under the word general the word warrior himself how long till the end of the battle Oh think of it but one that's leading the battle hallelujah think about when Joshua came there that day remember here comes Joshua it's certain then the victory is certain there is no question are we going to be able to take Jericho victory was certain I hope you with me now Joshua one praying Lord if it's your will if we take Jericho lord if it be thy will if we take Jericho he was not praying that but he was saying Lord what is your will on how were to tear down Jericho what is the direction it was not about if it's his will we it is not we don't pray if it's God's will to tear Satan's Kingdom down that's always the will of God but it's asking Lord how should this be now remember when Joshua came into that place here is Joshua you know standing there in the scripture he goes out to play he goes out to pray and remember the same angel of the Lord that God promised there in Exodus the same one he spoke in Exodus 29 at 23 and he said he shall go before thee he shall keep thee in the way and bring thee into the place that I have prepared for thee that same ange of the Lord made himself known in that time notice he changed his form and when Joshua saw him he saw him and he saw a man and when Joshua saw the man he pulled his sword out he said are you forests or you against us and here's what he did he identified himself by the word as captain of the Lord's hose am I now come and Joshua recognized the ranking officer it was right there he knew his rank and he said what would you have died servant do glory be to god the word lets us know our rank aren't you glad thank the Lord every power of the enemies defeated when he was here on earth he took the word triumphed over everything Satan had he triumphed over death over hail over the grave and he rose up the third day he's come back and now living in his church this great word warrior the warrior that was the word and that same warrior that is the word in us living himself punctuating every sign of his resurrection and his coming the great warrior Christ already trialed listen to this statement and we'll pick this up ain't a thing good English in it I like ain't I ain't never stop using me and I ain't going to ain't a fate you know I was told two kids at school said now listen I said this was B you can have buddy language but when we go to write papers we got to have that kind of a language you know that is professional you don't want somebody coming in for sore so right now we want to have the real language right now it ain't a thing for me to do in a Fame for me to do just follow just follow every Power has already been defeated now remember with David here these these men that we read about when David comes into power recognize that David those who had served david faithfully while david was regarded as an outcast and David wasn't hold Saul was seeking for his life trying to kill him and and there were battles that was going on all around but every one of them that stood faithful to David every one of those men they received their part their position when David came into power now there wasn't I don't believe with all my heart I don't believe this that they were serving David like that because of maybe he'll make me this maybe he'll make me this URI let me just say this to you there's a lot of things we could preach on crowns maybe God will let me do that someday but to realize of all the rewards and we're not living what we're doing here because well I'm going to have this or I'm gonna have this our desire is to be where he is and not just there but right now we want to please him that's how heart's desire you know it's like those like that for the Rebbe said the black brother when he said you know in a dramatizing the angel came to him and said get ready for your robe and Crown he said the old black brother said don't you talk to me about no robe and Crown I just want to see the face of my Jesus I want to see the face of the one who saved me and redeemed me and tell me with the spirit and has given me strength all along if there's any crowns to be given any rewards it's because he has given me the strength that I needed in order to stand in this moment so within that remember as we were looking last week in revelations chapter 3 verse 11 the admonition is given to the Philadelphian age behold I come quickly when the brand would pick it up and say there's not he said really anything we need to discuss on that he said we know that he's coming quickly it's very very quick hold that fast which thou has if you have to hold it it means something's trying to take it from you that no man take my crown now we're not talking about the crown here where the Spirit of God would come and Crown our lives you know it would almost seem like it in a statement like this you would say well if we've been crowned by the Spirit of God in our soul surely we will be crowned with the new body and that is true but you'll notice how the admonition of the Holy Spirit is to every believer down through the ages the Spirit of God and the word moving in the heart of the believer it does not produce laxness slothfulness that's where sometimes were the ones that get away and thus lawfulness the slackness and things comes up but the word of god is always that because in the heart of the believer the desire is to please the Lord the desire is I want to be there where he is we're not we're not living today for tomorrow we are living for eternity so we're at the end of the last days and we certainly don't think that we need anybody when we need you know to be able to look around and say we're not in the last days we've arrived this is a time of trouble that was spoken of we see the identification scripturally and we see the promises that were made as it was in the days of Noah as it was in the days of Sodom we see the conditions of the world those are conditions you know I think it was like a you know it nursed one time when my wife was in the hospital he came into the room and never had people asked you questions and they really don't want to know no answer they came in the room you know and it was after of some shooting at her at a nightclub and things had taken place down south and you know he him he was waiting on my wife and he came in to talk to me and you know he got into this place and he said well you know he said as a pastor he said what do you think about this and I said well and so I started going through the signs of how that scripture it points to the conditions of the world and what would be in this time trouble sometimes perilous times it speaks of how the condition would be if Sodom and Gomorrah I went into all those parts of it and you know as I was going into it it stops me right in the middle the point I wanted to finish my point it ain't about me finishing my part I was I'm telling you the Word of God was so rich but I was trying to he had I thought he has a question I want to let him see there is a scriptural identification of this hour and if there's a scripture identification then there is a message that is to be heralded and declared in this hour there is a message to come into the safety under the blood of Jesus Christ amen so when there's going to be crowns that are given out back crowns that spoke up in this scripture is that crown of a new body this is the admonition I want to I want to read this here very quickly the Prophet here at the latter part in the Philadelphia church age would write in that scripture he said it is hold fast persevere don't give up put on the whole armor of God use every weapon he has given us use every gift at our disposal and look ahead with joy because we are going to be crowned by him who is the king of kings and Lord of lords I'll tell you what right now we're now looking for the greatest battle ever fought to come we're living in it right now we're living in it right now but things be to God there's been a preparation God prepared for himself what would be needed in this hour he is to hold Ajara he put the unction listen it wasn't God God who's the one who made the promise for the hour it's God who raised us and those are part of that promise it's caught who brings that into the promise it was God who dealt with the prophets heart it is God who brought all that forth even think of it friends the confidence prophet himself will be able to stand there and be able to declare that word in this generation do you realize that took a courage that was greater than the courage of man that took the courage of Almighty God and let me say this to you that same courage is in the hearts of the believer that have received this same revelation for this revelation holds prevail a power you can't close it up you can't shake it up we're gonna be taken up he keeps catching us away catching us away the great battle were in right now this is one on the admonition put on the harm of God in Ephesians 6 verse 10 finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armour of God that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand put on the whole armour of God God's whole armor is his word it's his life it's himself amen it's not it's not being able to quote it there's times to quote but it's to have that same life giver the word himself living behind your flesh living in the depth of our heart that's the armor if it's just in our mind Satan can overthrow it if it's just in our spirit Satan can overthrow it in a small message called the contest preached at the end of 1962 lebron tells us how that satan will come and he'll test to see where that word is at in our life he comes to test that and in the fake of it it in itself reasoning won't do you know reasoning is a gate of judgment but I want you to think when the Prophet himself was standing there look look what Eve many many miraculous things that were already taking place within his ministry but he stood right here right next to where when his his is his child was being taken his wife was being taken and Satan came right up next to him and begin to whisper to him and let it be known and begin to lay things out well you did this you went and when you didn't feel like going and you know and every time you know you you prayed for the sick you healed him I like how the things were spoken with in there brother Branham calls it right on he said wait a minute I didn't hear one of them God healed him but all this was coming as a barrage right at the Prophet now remember he says he swept right around there and my reasonings and he said I was about ready to say if that's the way he's going to be I was about ready to say it but there the armor of God this isn't highlighting brother Branham it's showing you and out what's available to you and I there is an armor and to let you know there is the strength of the armor of God in the midst of battle in the midst of tests with you and feel I giving up you can't give up there is a greater hold on the inside of you mutants started you ain't finishing it the seal of God standeth sure let me just encourage you a moment you might feel weak sometimes but that ain't your soul you might get down sometimes but that's not your soul sometimes you might even in the midst coming out of your mouth you might complain a little bit you might say why let me tell you something that's not your soul that's that two parts of humanity that is steel around that seems her and to show you the deity of God and the armor of God is greater than any reason or any hold of a devil there is no weapon formed against you shall prosper the armor of God steadfast you maybe not even will have an answer sometimes to give somebody you maybe don't even have the answer and the devil would want to try to shame you because well if you really this or really that you'd have the answer but you realize that the answer himself if I don't have it right then I do have the answer inside of me that's why when the prophet has he stood in god of this evil age he's remember here he has already breached the Serpent's seed and here a man comes to him on the street and he said brother Branham if that's what you're saying about the Serpent's seed he said well where is this serpent at where is this at brother Brent said hi he said you know I don't even know what to say at the time he said but then it came out it's here this is what I'm saying but God in you is the answer to every question whether I'm sitting in and while we're on this room Oz will put this devil in a headdress brother Branham was sent in and a doctor's office getting a physical and one of the doctors raised the question about the virgin birth and raised some other question brother Graham said I just did he said I wasn't able to you know to go through it at that moment he said I thought Lord well what am I going to do how am I going to answer this man brother man talks about how he prayed months later the Spirit of God moved down and all of a sudden they answer opened for him he said God make a way that I can go back to that doctor and there was a door that opened he was able to go back and see the doctor said doctor he said you remember that question the other time when I was in here he said God gave me the answer to it and took him through you ought to just put that devil in the headlock right now and don't give him no noogie you wear him out the answer is in you the Bible is this word that's already in our hearts when we have need of it the answer will come jesus said take no thought what you'll say when you're brought before tribunal boards and everything else what's he letting you and I know don't live your life in fear that's what he told you Joshua don't be afraid be strong and of a good courage this wasn't one man speaking to another this is Almighty God speaking to us as his children Paul would go on in one place and call it the armor of light how that even when we look at as I told you on Thursday night when we look at this virtuous woman it's in Proverbs 31 but the whole you can preach the whole gospel right there out of that that woman this is a type of the bride of Jesus Christ and it speaks even in verse 25 of that chapter and says strength and honor are her clothing and she shall rejoice in time to come your clothing is strength and honor amen it is the full armor of God now remember you can be looking right at me this morning and look at somebody else and say brother Samuel you look as wimpy as I don't know what but you don't know what's on the inside of me same gods on the inside of me that spoke this world into existence same gods inside of me that met Daniel in the lion's den same God inside of me here's the same one that spoke through David and said to the Philistine this day your heads coming off the same God that lives in me in you that's the same gun that brought the walls of Jericho down throw me in one way I wish I was twice my size right now David this is very important as we come into this here I want to look just a little bit more there's some things that the Holy Spirit just begin to quicken in my heart here even at the beginning of the week and this armor remember we are to put on the harm of God we are to use every weapon he has given us use every gift that is at our disposal and look up we've already like Abraham received the promised message we're looking up we see Moriah we see Mount Moriah we see the place where Jehovah Jireh will come sweep us away come on now glory be to God we see we see it on that mountain peak on that seven peak we see that sweeping away come on somebody think about this now David I want you to catch this now in this whole armor of God it is God coming inside of you and I and arming us as his children and David think of how David would express it in First Samuel 17 when David went out there after saw or not saw but Goliath and ran his mouth and tried to belittle him and tried to rattle his cage when David walked out there one of the things that David said he recognized this battle is not mine this battle is the Lord's that's key right there it is also remember the Prophet over and over in the message he would tell you and I he said if you're gonna fight your battle God can't fight it now I'm not going to ask you to raise your hands even though I got both of mine out there's times where we were fighting their own battles but as long as we find them God can't find them is that right many times we've approached the thought of the armor of God the home of God when we look at all these parts sometimes our thing King is in a manner as though that it's something of our strength doing it it's not our strength it's our surrender to his word to him who is already within you and I it's giving ourselves over to him every one of these parts right here that we begin to go through in the armament every weapon is about us surrendering to the word that is only inside of us this is why Zechariah would say when he would look at that mountain not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord this mountain shall be removed in the Ephesians 6:14 standing against the wiles of the devil stand therefore now I know we covered a little bit of this but you know what I got obeying my boss he just picked me up and turned me around on Sunday morning I got to thinking about a few things and it just the inspiration just started flowing in verse 14 stand there for this is our to stand having your loins Girt about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness to have our loins Girt this is where that it would be the fastening where the robes that would remember as we said the robes that hang down you could not walk the movement was not easy with those robes so in order to move you actually had to gird yourself and obviously this would be a movement that would be in haste or where you are ready to move quickly now to think of it you know brother Brandon would bring us out and even Ty know once you notice how that my inspiration the Holy Spirit Paul when he would write this letter you know this letter would be one of the letters I believe that would be sent back with onesimus he would carry Ephesus Colossians that the letter to Philemon these different letters and Paul there's many different leans to the gospel and Paul would write of this in a manner after being able to look at all the armaments that would be upon that of the Roman soldier and power Paul would notice under the direction of the Spirit of God of how that that armament had was all assembled together and the parts that were together notice he here stand therefore having your loins Girt about with truth having on the breastplate of righteousness that word is truth the breastplate of righteousness brother Graham said that's having the word inside of you and doing what is right now when we look at this this breastplate of righteousness you see how that this is just so intricately woven here with this of the belt but notice on the breastplate of righteousness when it deals with it I like how it says that let me read it when it speaks of the Messiah and Isaiah 59 16 and he saw that there was no man and wondered that there was no intercessor therefore his arm brought salvation unto him and His righteousness it sustained him for he put on righteousness as a breastplate and a helmet of salvation upon his head and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing and was clad with zeal as a cloak notice even how this will pertain even to the second coming of the Lord but notice he put this or I want to draw your attention he put on righteousness as a breastplate now when the Lord Jesus was here he did not walk around and have the armor meant that we would see upon the Roman soldiers but yet he was fully armored he had with on him remember he had within his heart it was not like David David said I've heard I have hidden that word in my heart that I may not sin against you but here the Lord Jesus in the Book of Psalms I believe it Psalms 40 we talked about I have not hidden by righteousness in my heart but I have declared it I have made known that righteousness time mercy the salvation by loving-kindness you see the righteousness of God's own life inside of that body that we know as the Lord Jesus it was a life where works themselves according to the word was not something that Jesus was struggling to do it was the word that was lived out through his life so righteousness and let me just shorten this here the righteousness the breastplate of righteousness remember it's not we are not righteous because we do righteously we do righteously because we're righteous they I understand that hey we're not made righteous by our works but our works declare our righteousness and that our righteousness is not our own our righteousness is through the Lord Jesus Christ so what is the true righteousness I'm not looking at myself I am looking at the lamb my focus is not on me my focus is on him so the breastplate of righteousness that armament that protection is about you and me dwelling in the righteousness of Almighty God it is dwelling in his presence under his word it is him inside of you and me performing his word doing what's right now I'm not gonna ask how many's made mistakes that's not the focus I'm talking about here but for doing what's right is because the desire within our heart I do only those things that please him that's the desire that's righteousness brother Samuel means seeking the will of God about something that's the breastplate of righteousness yeah it's not about us standing up there unless god I've got the breastplate no the breastplate of righteousness remember this is not of man this is God's breastplate remember that same breastplate brother Branham picks it up the very first time that word is mentioned breastplate it's not mentioned in a sense of battle but yet we know it's used in battle remember when it came time for Joshua to know which way shall I go shall I take this way shall I take that way remember what God had spoke through Moses and told Joshua us as spiritual Joshua's he said when you get ready to go in the battle you shall come before Eleazar the high priest and he shall come before the Urim Thummim that your employment was the breastplate program said that's the breastplate of the word that the believer is fortified by what is it when something there that comes up we want to know does every light shine upon it Lord is this your will helm in Lord Jesus help us Lord every thought that every thought every objective could be in line with him now let's look at this bill to be gird about our loins Girt about with truth really brave had a lot to say about this the scripture don't say a whole lot about it but the but but brother Ram says quite a bit about it you find different parts in the scripture we'll pull up here but brother Ram would draw us in because how that the Roman soldier was made up they would wear that that tunic like the white and linen that would be underneath the garment when they put the breastplate on the breastplate itself would be that which would cover that of that of that of the upper body it would be a part in the front and a part in the back and right at the bottom of that breastplate would be that of a belt that would have with on it those brass buttons that were seated on leather and what would take place is to wear that belt was that they would actually tighten that belt on and that belt being tightened would actually hold the sword tight it would hold the breastplate in place it made it easy then for the soldier to be ready for combat and be ready to travel it's kind of hard when your belt gets loose and your sword goes to dragon you can't actually be as effective as you need to be this is why that our loins need to be gird about with truth so here brother bran would pick that up and he would say then he says that belt you know it holds the rest of it together you know he says women people will come in question and say what about this and what about that he said you're able to reach back and you're able to know where that you are standing that when the enemy comes against you all Devils in Hell cannot upset you so that being established in present truth you've got the buck you've got the buckle tightened up you are established in the Word of God when someone could come to you seems like out of the blue but that's just a lot of times out Satan will launch his attacks and he will want to make his attack he'll say some news story or whatever more and say can you believe these people they actually could believe this can you believe that parents would be praying for their children and you can look at it and say you know what I don't know the whole part of that situation but let me tell you what I do know I do know that he steel is a healer I do know that he still heals the sick I do know that he does for for miracles well how in the world are you able to live a victorious life all good you asked the question your your buckle is all packed up and you're able to stand there and say you know the promise is that he said if I go away I'll prepare a place for you you know he said that the promise of the Spirit of Truth that that same life he would come back inside of us well I've had the experience and that same life the baptism of the Holy Ghost is true what are you doing you're standing there with your belt tightened up David would say in Psalms 1832 it is God that Gerdes me with strength and maketh my way perfect verse 39 for thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle Psalm 27:1 the Lord is my light and my salvation whom shall I fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid of brother Brennan would admonish just pull up the since she said tighten up that buckle tighten yourself up a little bit and get ready for it cause it's coming don't you worry you're gonna have plenty of trouble but remember greater is He that's in you than he that's in the world see you gotta you gotta tighten that up greater is He that is in me than he that's in the world you gotta tighten that up that's why we come even to the house of God we come to the house of God for inspection sometimes so make sure the shoes are shined right let me look inside then let me look inside there that that weapon right there huh aren't you glad you got somebody who is an inspector what you glad you got somebody who doesn't look at a respected person he comes right down in our lives and said hey your feet ain't shot like they ought to be hey your bill yourself hey your belt it's all slagging down there come on now lighten up your walk a little bit tighten up your life a little bit I'm grateful for that he says now think of this in Luke chapter 12 verse 35 let your loins be girded about and your nights be burning and you yourselves like unto men that wait for their Lord when he will return from the wedding that when he cometh and knocketh they may open unto him immediately so within that inspection of the Holy Ghost it comes sometimes because remember this this belt right here when you read about it that belt in brother bramble pointed out that belt is the foundation on which other things sit if the belt is slack that the sword is dragging the ground and and it weight as things are waiting you down so you've got a tightening up every once in a while you got to make sure it's tight no brother man look how even bring this I'll tell you what it would take the inspiration of God at this hour he said now usually in these old soldiers when they would put these ornaments of war they had a big belt they had buckled it together holding over their lone loins these shields to keep the enemy Spears off what a lesson that is to us and when the line began to get weak and hang them the shield they would tighten up on their belt and bring them up tight again when belonging would get weak eurowings and my loins it gets weak this is why Paul would admonish us stand but stand having the belt tightened up because on the belts tighten up the breastplate ain't flopping around but Brenda sorts not just dragging on the ground but everything is in position in you and ready to be used how often again and again and again watch over the RAM will take this he said what a picture what a perfect picture today when you begin to feel like you're slacking or the devil says it's no use reach down and tighten up the belt a little bit pull the sword a little tighter in the hand and go forward when you feel like you're slacking I'm going to ask you to raise your hands but we've all been there when you feel like you're slacking well what do I do don't get down on yourself that's just what the enemy wants you to do what should I do paint reach down and say Lord I'm gonna tighten up the buckle maybe I got a little loose in my prayer life a little loose and giving myself to the Lord I've got a little loose on coming to church but Lord forgive me I'm ready to tighten up the buckle Lord maybe got a little loose and words little loose and things being said Lord I'm ready to tighten up the buckle the other part of that is when the devil tells you it's no use what should I do tighten up the truth that's the redeemed of the Lord say so I am redeemed I am the apple of his eye come on somebody I haven't the apple of his eye I am redeemed I am bought with a price I am going in a rapture I am born again I have God's strength within me hallelujah go hurry when the devil says it's no you see it's tighten up the truth around you so I'll tell you what right now you just send that send that devil away he's trying to wear on you about where your belt got a little slack you know right here as a soldier brother Carlos you were in it and some other brothers whose the rest of them that we're in the military here ok brother Chris and brother gomez you know how was they inspected you all I don't care what you passed the last inspection I don't care what you wear on Thursday night this is Sunday morning I don't care what you were a year ago it's having a fresh experience today Oh mah Psalms 31 17 she guardeth her loins with strength and strengtheneth her arms I love this verse 18 she perceive a--the she's inspecting examining that her merchandise is good her candle goeth not out by night the bride is accounting of her life how is she examining her life she's looking into the perfect law of Liberty I need to tighten this up in my life right now disarmament ain't fitten just right on me come on we all like mirrors that make us look skinnier unless you are skinnier we like mirrors that maybe you know seem to like show good things about us but you know as a believer we're looking the Lord forgive me help me I need to work in that air in my life that working in the area of the life is not me per se taking my hands its surrendering to him you see the tightening of a tightener is about surrendering to you we need a continual refilling of the Holy Ghost we do we need a continuing feeling here we need our wicks trimmed because sometimes our wicks get they get that carbon on them no problem with the oil on the inside come on now there no problem with the oil the wick is down there in that oil it's drawing that it's drawing that from that reservoir but what happens is the wick itself it gets carbon buildup on it it needs to be trimmed this is the a love that screaming time we want our loins to be girded and our lights burning that our witness lights that are burning it's a witness I am living for the coming of the Lord inspection to make sure we're holding that armor correctly he has to inspect to make sure that that's tightened up then we're not got loose about some things but the brem says that the message token how loosely are we getting we need to tighten up the armor let certain things in in the home and other things never would have let in before or we let little things slide and little things and making excuses for it now sometimes friends it's not not even on that level but remember it's still with things in our life am i living a life that is tightened to the word this armor it'll never keep the devil off of you with excuses when the devil comes to you you're not going to say that devil you have to take it easy now because Jesus understands why I mean why am really haven't been praying I've been down and you're going to take it easy on me now he ain't gonna take it easy on you he's gonna mop you from one end to the other that guy is merciless you wanna know how merciless he is he'd attack a baby that's how merciless and how ruthless he is I'm telling you that right now is because you need to make sure say the Lord helped me to be girded out you had the resources we have everything that we have needed to be tightened up Oh huh that's why brother Brad let's say Lord help may there be something happen in this meeting that would cause us to tighten up the armor I'm glad for that I'm glad I need that I need that I need for him to come to help us to tighten up the armor because sometimes you brothers know who we're in them services you think your boots are pretty good you think you're aren't your your your rifle you've got that thing just right you think every crease is pressed just right but that's what you think but we got a pass according to his mind but remember all that that he's doing all those all those coming out there and check and come on now get on out here line up and he's going around and checking and you know and and so forth all of that is preparing for the battle because if they're slack and they don't care that we're all wrinkly bt bt u--'s you're not talking about they have you know you know rifles are all dirty and crusted over and you know here they all come out there and the hats wearing sideways and they show up and their boots are undone and ones done up and ones done I made it I'm here you're here but you can ready to get wore out you know I'm saying why because it's not ready for battle this is why our strength comes from the lord and po would say I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me now watch this look at this girding up to go fight for the bill to go fight in this battle to be able to have the foundation and all of that girded properly watch how brother branham would take this up in another message he would talk about how he said to think of the ship that we are in right now this ship of the Lord Jesus in the body of Jesus Christ to think of it there's many storms that will come there's many things that will come against it but he says we will safely make it to the other Shore and he says when I think of that when I think of what making it to the other Shore when I think of that it takes all the scare away it takes all the fuss away takes all the malice away makes that fellow who mistreated you look like your brother again so let's get him by the hand now don't get quiet on me now oh my here she's done me wrong why what difference what difference does it make notice here she's done me wrong what difference does it make I did to you see if listen friends if things the way to valuate it is it going matter on the other side when we stand there that day or we stood up let me see where where's brother Joliet huh well Joe you remember that they wanted to be nothing like that nothing like that so it's not going to be that way over there I'll keep it here this thing brother Sam you're putting things together let me read on now here she's done me wrong why what difference does it make I did too let me put my arm around them and say come on brother let's move up a little further now tighten up the old he said you know Paul talks about this buckler do you realize the buckler's the main part not very much said about it in the Bible but that's a real part the buckler's what holds the breeches of the harness together so I got the helmet of all these different pieces on the breastplate but don't forget but buckler that buckles it up it tightens it up get a good tight hold and move on again marriage another place here in the scripture or in the message where brother brand will take that same point and I in in in here Christ in the mystery of God revealed he admonishes the church you just wax that much closer together take the buckle as the brother testified here the other night about having a buckle and seeing it in a vision just that buckle it buckles on the whole armour of God just pull her on tighten up move right up close to one another love one another anyhow talk nice about one another say nice things about one another and then God will bless you when I have more and more than I've looked at this over how the Lord has had me to look at this you realize that our armament and we're talking about more I'm gonna tighten that belt tighten that belt he's askin in Lord Lord God help me over slackness and the other part of tightening the belt is loving one another preferring one another edifying one another interesting in the scripture when you look at all of the one and others in the New Testament comfort one another all of the one another's what is it so part of my victory part of the girding up of my loins with truth is love being able to tighten it up you know the only way like brother Graham said right here to tighten it up is to be able to let things go what about in her homes well the Bible said that the man is to cleave unto his wife is that right how can you be victorious without your home being victorious you see you've got a head you've got to have the right kind of a relationship even as husband and wife there's times where you have to reach down and tighten up the buckle tighten up the buckle is a straightening everybody else out it's loving one another loving one another isn't just so much of pretending things or I'll pretend this is and there but it's recognizing like brother Graham said with some of these things right here it's recognized yes they maybe have mistreated you yes maybe something was said wrong but there's the part in the word forgive one another even for as Christ for God's sake for God has for Christ's sake has forgiven us let it go Omaha oh ma look at this here in the scripture let's go on to this next one here in Ephesians 6:15 and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace this preparation being prepared brother branham would take the example and he would take a statement that Abraham Lincoln made that in the time of peace prepare for war brother Brown would tell the people he said now in the time while everything is running smooth you better get ready how many likes smooth times I know you do I do too but in the smooth times you better get ready it's not to scare you look all this part right here of the armament it's about our surrender it's our relationship with the Lord and with one another it's running smooth you better get ready because Satan ain't gonna let it run smooth very long really bream said here you are said in this convention you know and mom and here we are in the service MA you know just rejoicing the devil may not even wake till you get out the door but them said he'll come and attack me here - pulpit he said he'll attack you while you're sitting there in the pew come on now you know I'm talking about he said he'll tack you tomorrow he said you know nowhere he's gonna come he said it might come when you're in the store he say you know win win he's gonna come he said but here's the point be ready be ready for win that he does come now notice God already knows real trevor we don't have to fret and think I wonder how the enemy is gonna come toward the enemy he might be attacking me he might be coming oh he's coming after you but don't be looking at him your confidence is in the armor that you have remember the breastplate of righteousness you're looking to the Lord God already knows what's coming he already knows think of it God already knows even the message that he has sent in this hour it's come right out of the Bible the promises that he made God already knew what would be here in this hour he made a promise when the enemy comes in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord will raise a standard against it he makes it real more real and more sure he's preparing you with his word for what you will face whether it's in the near or the distant future we don't know how or when Satan will attack but we want to stay prepared we want to feed on the Word of God not just come to church we come to feed on the Word of God we come to be focused and said Lord speak to me take that gift Lord that you would fortify the army that I may speak to me Lord you know what I have need of Lord I need to hear from you this morning Lord you know what I'm going through or you know what's going to face but it all I'm not gonna fear I'm trusting in you there's a lot of accusations could come but like David said and even he took the admonition from the book of Deuteronomy when you look at the enemy and you are afraid remember I am with you David said what time I am afraid I will trust in you so where are we at right now the preparation the gospel peace you've got to train for knockout punches the gospel this is not altogether the gospel the gospel is the word in power and demonstration is that right Paul would mention of that it's the word of power and demonstration now once you look at this armament isn't this tremendous this part of the armament and how that it would be descripted that our feet would be shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace to recognize of how that we are positioned in Christ when we have been brought under the blood of Jesus Christ when we have been brought under the blood by that of the baptism of the Holy Ghost here we are positioned in Christ our feet are then shot with the preparation of the gospel let me tell you about this shouting you know they don't hardly make shoes anymore that you've got a you can go put new new soles on them there's a few a few shoes you can get that they'll put new there's a cobbler I think an Avon or whatever there's not many cobblers around let me tell you something when God shot Israel when they left Egypt they didn't need a cobbler their shoes didn't wear out come on somebody that's shouting lasted I don't care what opposition came I don't care who questioned the messenger who questioned the message the shouting never wore out they were shot walking through the Red Sea they were shot when they stood right there as a testimony and said if God be with us we are more than able to take the land they were shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace Caleb was Joshua so shot that when the Giants they came out they weren't even looking at the size of the Giants they said my lord it's time to come into our inheritance they were shod with the preparation the gospel of peace but the rest of them came up and seen those Johnson said Lord we're like grasshoppers the confession of your mouth you either lift you or sink you come on now over a beat of God it's a preparation of the gospel of peace think about this and Isaiah 52 Paul would pick this up in in the book of Romans but I love this and Isaiah 52 7 how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings that publishes peace that bringeth good tidings of good and publishes salvation that saith unto Zion thy God reigneth that's what the gospel is all about he doesn't come to present to you and I a puny weak Christ it reveals him to be the mighty Conqueror that's what's happened in the end time here that which was lost now who do we see come forth we see the lab that has come forth to take the book he sent it down to his seventh angel messenger and the message that has been heralded and proclaimed it does not proclaim a defeated life well you're gonna have to go to this rehab you'll have to do this but you'll never be able to get over this here's a self-help book no sir it proclaims him as the mighty Conqueror he is the triumphant one and you in him every devil is under your seat you've been shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace this gospel says to Zion thy God reigneth you say brother Samuel that's the ministry how beautiful are the feet of them that carry the gospel of feet and a feet peace that is in the body every gift is in the body and you are in the body so your feet in my feet are shod with the preparation you may not be called to preach here with that gift in your life but your life preaches you preach in many places that our Minister the gospel will never be able to get to but your life preaches because the life of this blood speaker better things gonna have a few more minutes oh that's about 71% of you Song of Solomon chapter 1 7 verse warning how beautiful are thy feet with shoes I will tell you my feet look better with shoes one thing I like to know you know that but I want they all like about this time of year I don't like wearing socks but I thank God that spiritually we're not barefoot when the product will come home that was one of the requirements of the father put shoes on his feet our feet have shoes Oh princess daughter I want you to think of what this is of the Lord laid at my heart it's the peace of God the Living Word of God in you in action through you between you and the world here's your life here's the gospel here's the light of God's Word it's a separation between you and the world the testimony of the true witness in your life think of it heat read the fierceness of the wrath of God he bore our judgment he made a way that we might walk by the power of his word in us so much so that it would be brought to our attention go anywhere any place any time having your feet shot with the gospel how old can only be a card let me just tell you little bride you're running with the testimony the message from the throne of God it's the witness of the resurrection and you and you have access to the throne like Esther let me just say this to you not all who remember what Jesus told him they would go into a village they would preach he said if they don't receive it he said then you take off your shoes your sandals shake off the dust put them back on and go on shake off the dust shake off the dust has been some disappointment some things didn't go the way that maybe you thought it was going to go maybe here in your life there's been witness and things that's gone forth you said it don't seem like it's going that way what should I do shake off the dust and keep running with the message don't just get stuck keep running with the message amen because it's not your words that word that you delivered my brother and sister it isn't your voice it's God's voice and that word itself when it's went forth you may not even see it when it comes to pass but it is God's word and if there is a seed there to bring forth life it will be God to do it the same as he did it in you this is the encouragement every place in Deuteronomy 1124 same thing he said to Joshua every place we're on the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours every promise you can put your foot on that's yours every partial the ground is going to be contested but be prepared be prepared and he's preparing you and I aren't you glad for that verse 25 there shall no man be able to stand before you for the Lord your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon as he hath said unto you Deuteronomy 33 29 happy art Thou O Israel who is like unto thee O people saved by the Lord the shield of the help who is the sword of the excellency then enemies shall be found Liars unto thee and thou shalt tread upon their high places and in Romans 16:20 and the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet sure we are shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace this is a body ministry it is God working through his body he already knows what's coming God already had eyes in this age already seen what's coming that word right here is left for you and I to discern it's spiritual discernment it's a body ministry this is the ministry of the bride of Jesus Christ it is a word that is going forth in action a word that's being reflected in our lives oh my it's an inside dress and inside dress others can look at and say Oh what's he saying an inside dress oh but the difference is brother Brent said this is the secret food he embodies himself he said in the gift in my life and he said he gives you gifts and he embodies himself and he said you're receiving from this word that's the secret food it's God unfolding to you and I we don't know what tomorrow holds but we know who holds the future and you know what there's times like this having our feet shod with the preparation of the gospel it comes upon us just like it did when Israel returned from Babylon and let me close with this remember and every one of these parts you can pull use every gift at our disposal there was accusations when they came from Babylon and they begin to come back in Atlanta they came under the authority of the word to build the temple but immediately the enemy came after him he kept coming he tried the Bible says he wanted to frustrate the work of their hands that word frustrate means to break the purpose the enemy came with accusation after accusation the work was shut down for 15 years they didn't do anything they had been commissioned commissioned by God it was prophecy that had already been laid out all the way in Jeremiah all the way in Isaiah but accusation day after day and the attacks of the enemy and the accusations eventually the work ceased but when you read and Hagee out chapter 1 maybe this week when you're at home you realize at this time and it speaks of an in Ezra - here come Hagee I the Bible says the Lord's messenger spake in the Lord's message saying I am with you they begin to call to their attention how that they'd kind of just let things go but in let them know this is the time you let him know this is the time think of it the accusations and even we eat it that had been come down and said don't you build no more this edict that came down by one who did not know the commission of the word but there was Haggai he spoke by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit a ministering spirit brother Aaron to speak to their hearts in that moment I am with you saith the Lord the Bible says that the elders of the Jews rose up and they begin to build they started to work and the same men that were bringing accusation kept an eye on all the rest of them they came to him and they said who told you you could build who told you you could do this who said you could be doing this who said you could do that but here's what they did they answered them not you don't have to answer the devil you've been given authority by the Word of God your answer is stay focused stay in the purpose Alleluia glory be to God the Bible said the high of their God was upon them so they could not cause them to cease they kept building all these things they wanted to keep saying who gave you this authority who told you could do this who took excuse me can you hand me that brick right there thank you oh excuse me all the time running their mouths their oneness steal come at him what they're trying to do they're trying to bring fear but there was a word that had come and they received that word it cast out fear it should child their feet with the preparation of the gospel where the girdle where it had been slack it was tightened up and what did they do they kept building kept building kept building and eventually the word came back from the throne don't you touch these men you leave him alone matter of fact if I see it anybody hinders them that their house be torn down and let them be hanged you might be waiting on an answer but keep on movin keep on moving you've stood on the word and the word is said fast because God is faithful who made the promise it's a ministering spirit that comes to encourage you for deliverance a ministering spirit that comes to encourage you and say salvation is for you a ministering spirit that comes to encourage you you said it look like a brother branham I heard him the other day said brother Branham I've been seeking the Holy Ghost for 10 years he said why you ain't knowledge it's a promise it's given to you take it a ministering spirit to encourage you this is what belongs to you one man can say it to another man it'll never have the same effect as God saying it to your heart and as the son of God you recognize the authority that belongs to you a ministering spirit that comes forth that says get ready get ready your healing the evidence the manifestation it's coming we're in a battle but we're not in dread why because this armor of the Lord it's not like the armor of the world this is the armor a love affair the breastplate of his righteousness being gird up with truth but the same if how is that going to calls the sword to come up on my life you talking about by me just letting things go and say the Lord God just as much as I've been wrong they've been wronged by the Lord don't let me hold that mistreating don't let me hold this Lord let me love one another let the love of God so fall in my heart I want more of the love of God I want more of it to overtake in my life you with me there's every one of us when we look at that the girl every one of us have been hurt in some way or another is that right every one of us there's certain things in ways and come we don't sit there I don't said to you and you don't say to me well you ain't ever been hurt like this you narrator we realize that the enemy comes in a way that may be coming away and something do you know for me was sad or done or whatever it may be wouldn't even bother you'd say well let me just let that go but to see for me it's a part of it that I have to overcome the same is you have to hope come but God gives us the grace to be able to overcome and when we're able to say lord help me just to release that you know what happens in your reaching down and getting the bot you're getting that belt and tightening it up all of a sudden you notice the sword comes back to its rightful position let's pray father orders as much Lord you spoke to our hearts today Lord my prayer my heart's desire and what you've spoken the Lord God and I know Lord it has to be you it can't be me but I pray that father that right now in this part of the service whatever the need is what I know you've already met it you've already made a way for that need to be fully met or brought to a realization in that heart Lord God I pray father with this armor Lord that we have lord of the word dwelling in our hearts in our lives Lord God you've helped us to see sometimes Lord in these in these areas Lord how we need to look not on not more looking at our own righteousness your righteousness from our hearts the desire to do what is right to please you or to realize your grace and sufficient Lord to tighten up that that belt what does you spoke to this Lord I'm convinced the Holy Spirit Lord you come Lord to deal with each of our hearts you know where we you know where we need dealt with I'm so glad for it Lord I'm glad it's not left up to me or any other man to try to put it in place on our lives I'm glad that Lord you're the one you're fortified in your army you bring your word and Lord that reciprocating part in our life Lord God to be able to recognize it more to me that's the greatest thing in the world I think you I think your father Lord God for that Lord that in our lives to be able to recognize your presence and say yes Lord yes Lord I need to tighten up the buckle Lord I need to tighten it up maybe there's things Lord that you know life or prayer life Lord and there walk with God they need to tighten up maybe there's tighten up with things Lord they need to evaluate their life but Lord within it all it's made to be a love affair a love affair with you for you are our victory Lord when we look at this this is your battle so lord may we just take God like your prophet said and we feel we're getting a little slack or he said the devil comes and says it's no use may we reach down and tighten up the buckle again Lord right here I realize I'm standing before many veterans not just veterans from the natural military of this nation that we are in but I'm standing before many veterans that have been through many many halls and snares many battles battle scarred and how many times war God that they would testify to us and say I've had to tighten that buckle in and again and again I have to keep checking on that buckle have to keep checking on it cuz if I don't he lets everything else slack around me my sword I just can't get my sword out everything else just seemed like on so hold me down lord help us and help us to reach down right now Lord and tighten up that button help us Lord as a children of God at our feet being shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace or when the test the trial when Satan would launch his attack this is not our focus our focus is not upon the attack that's coming where we're waiting and saying where's it going to come from I wonder which way no Lord that's not what you're trying to tell us you're trying to tell us rest rest in me I am your fortification I am your protection let my word let it shot your life in preparation what for things that Lord that we might be facing in the near or distant future but this is not our worry your prophet told us Lord worry is of Satan's Kingdom were of your kingdom Lord and worry doesn't belong in this kingdom help us Lord I pray that Lord if there's one here in Lord this morning always Lord God my heart's desire that they wouldn't have on that armor of God or they'll never be able to stand against the wiles of the devil having a knowledge of the message knowing that God sent a prophet knowing Scriptures knowing all of that they'll never be able to stand Peter was pretty good with the sword he could stand there and he could duel with the high priest soldiers but when it came to really standing with courage and he was out there he was away from your presence it is out there at school out there on the job out there among family out in different places all of a sudden there's things that started to come about he didn't have that real spiritual courage to stand there in that moment the father you sent a personal invitation to him hallelujah Peter didn't even have the courage to raise his own head but you said don't tell my disciples and tell Peter I go before him Lord when Peter went up there with the rest of them in that Upper Room he had been able to receive the word from you to where he could stand as a spokesman and say men and brethren this promise that was spoken must needs be fulfilled he could have never even spoken he had a courage to even wait Oh God if there's one Lord John right here this morning the Lord without that filling of the Holy Ghost may they take them Lord God in the call of the Holy Spirit Lord to impersonally Lord God and take courage you are God say Lord Jesus I receive that personal invitation and unction for the armor of God in my life may they cast aside Lord God every doubt every thought may Lord the presence of God Lord that's here right now this morning Lord speaking to our hearts dealing with our lives Lord God may it so far override Lord and cast out Lord every Lord unclean far Lord every thought of doubt and unbelief Lord God may its override Satan in the name of Jesus Christ I rebuke you you have no part here where a child of God a daughter of God desires to walk in Liberty you are defeated you can't hold on no long Norden may they walk in that courage up to the promise of God and say Lord I want that same courage that Peter when he came out of the upper room that same word that was in flesh that he walked with he ate with fellows shift with prayed with now that same word was trailing on the inside of him Pentecost brought a difference in his life now the word was made flesh in Peters life Peter now had a strength to hold that word when opposition would come he had the armor of God boeing's were gird about with truth feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace having on that breastplate of righteousness and the shield of faith helmet of salvation sword of a spirit praying with all perseverance Lord granted this morning but I don't know what the needs are but I know we're needy people but I'm glad Lord that's your the answer it's not that you're able it's your will it's your will granted this morning Lord for every life that's here may fear Lord be dismissed from the
