[Music] [Applause] [Music] how the Luigi it's so good to be in the house of the Lord and then to be able to be gathered together and amen we certainly thank God for these times that he has given to us and allows us we certainly don't know how much longer but one thing that we do want to have our heart so set on is that every moment that God gives us we want to be found ready and making ourselves ready amen that's the greatest thing that we can do and you know making ourselves ready is not something that is just of our own strength but it's our will being yielded to God's will amen being clothed in the final inning of his righteousness and his will our will being surrendered that's the great you know that's the greatest victory and that victory it takes it's one victory that takes place on the inside and then you have power and strength then to be able to bring and surrender your will constantly how many know what I'm talking about before so many things so many situations you're facing dealing with things that you're even thinking about but once it just something just kind of drops in your heart and you recognize wait a minute it's me that needs to get out of the way as soon as I get out of and that's the victory right there the victory is already what takes place after that is a manifestation of a victory that's already happened within I'll tell it's the greatest thing the greatest victory is over ourselves it's the greatest victory amen we're just so happy to be here tonight him so glad for that brother Darrell would would see would be able to come by and appreciate him and sister Cheryl here with us and sister Jessica and then the Darryl's wife and one of his daughters and so we're just glad that they have taken the opportunity or that they would took the time and they're going to in Pennsylvania this weekend we've got meetings brother Darrell and I know he's been preaching there at home and so I told him I said I didn't mean no I didn't put pressure on you I said but man I just heard you were close by in the area so that's why I wanted to try to get him but I we really just appreciate brother Darrell appreciate his labor and sacrifice and I know it's not just him sister Sharell together and as a family we certainly appreciate all that thank you all so much amen amen amen ended exciting right now we do I tell you what brother REM said I like this he says in the mighty God unveiled before us he said you know he said some people he said when they think of us he said and we come together and these conventions he said well you know he said they they kind of look at us like a bunch of nuts he said but you know the only thing we know to do is just come and surrender ourselves he said because it's hard to tell what God will do I believe that so I believe that's the greatest thing you know brother Brent told us there's three things and who is this Melchizedek he said when you come to a meeting he said the only thing that God has told us believe watch and pray because what God will do within a service I'll tell you it's unlimited amen and that wonderful amen hallelujah listen we want to just invite brother Daryl to go ahead and make his way way on out and I wonder if we just couldn't sing that song I don't know the title but I know that I know the lyrics a little bit to it Amen hallelujah won't you stand with me if

[Music] that the finish line godfrey I raised our that'll make you on the run hallelujah you know it's one thing to run you don't know what you're running about I don't know if you've ever seen some of those videos were people be walking down the street and these people just take off running and everybody takes off running but nobody knows what they're running about and then they get to have about two blocks they realize these guys are crazy but I'm so glad that we're running but we know what we're running about we ain't running empty we got a message we got a voice we got a more sure word of prophecy hallelujah amen Amanda's power in those spoken word a man out of your own mouth you'll be justified and out of your own mouth you'll be condemned that's the Word of God amen so if we're going to say anything let's say what the word says about amen praise the Lord we kind of such an honor to be with you in my you're certainly in the spirit of worship out here I felt real good all the way back in the study it felt good so the count is such an honor to be able to come and be with you and you should appreciate brother Samuel we've Minister with him a couple of different times and always enjoyed his ministry and his his burden for God's people and just love you appreciate you buddy I just got a call before he come to church tonight from brother Jackie Benton and I know y'all know brother Jackie and bless his heart he's getting feeble now and it just just breaks your heart to see him but he wanted to sing greetings to the church and and tell y'all hello and we praying for the services I'm going to tell you that he loves you a man sure love brother Jack yeah I tell you me me two year ago I my back went out on me anybody's ever had back trouble you know I I crawled on my hands and knees for six days I believe it was you know it's it's so funny how your house looks from that position you know my those legs need to be wiped off on that chair but anyway I had kind of got over it a little bit and still wasn't completely over there nah I had a meeting down in Alabama and brother Jackie course he's evangelist himself you know and but he he didn't go out that weekend but he put me in his car and drove me to Alabama and helped me get down there to help me get back and I just always appreciate it brother Jackie for that because you know he could have been out preaching himself that weekend but he gave up that weekend to help me get out and get back in and so that's just the kind of man that brother Jackie is and spent some time with him down in the Philippines he's a real prayer warrior I say he certainly knows how to get a hold of God when he prays and so we just really love appreciate brother Jackie and a man and just counted one of the great heroes of faith if you have your Bibles tonight turn with us to the Book of Amos we want to read from Amos chapter 3 verse 7 and verse 8 I just finished up a little series down home on the Satan's devices and some of the things that Satan the uses in last night we preached on that how that Satan will mimic a roar in line he's certainly not a roar in line but he'll try to act like a roaring lion so that's not we was looking at how Satan will try to impersonate a roar in line and how to stop his attack but tonight with the help of the Lord I want to look at the real roaring life hey man amen I want to look at this Loren line tonight and so we want to read now from Amos 3:7 and while you're turning there listen to these quotes and it's kind of where we got the thought for this message this is the way of the true prophet in sixty-two brother Branham says this he says old-line of the tribe of Judah rise up and roar for thou art roaring in this last day Oh God let your prophet roar Lord roar out your message God and let every creature of your kingdom take heed amen he also says this says I like to take for a text of here he him after all he's the voice of authority God himself witness so at this time hear ye him there are many voices in the world today there are many things going on many doctrines and many isms but here ye him he's the voice of final authority he's the one that'll speak he's the one that said the heavens and earth shall pass away but my words shall never fail so hear ye him he's the one to listen to and now Amos 3:7 and he the Bible says this surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets verse 8 the lion hath Lord who will not fear the Lord God has spoken who can but prophesy amen let's bow our heads I want to speak to you tonight for a few minutes on the lion hath roared Heavenly Father Lord our hearts are encouraged tonight by the singing of the songs of Zion the Lord truly thou art our shield and our buckler you're the lifter of our heads Lord and father in such an hour of time of discouragement and it seemed like the oppression and the depressions is upon the people but Lord we've heard a voice that has told us to lift up our heads or we see these things happening in our nation Lord there are the things that you said would happen it's happening exactly the way you declared it through your prophets but Lord you said when the world got into that condition and we should lift up our heads for her Egyptian drones now in Lord we believe tonight that we are that chosen people by your grace in ordinay we lay aside every voice that's contrary to your voice and may we only hear what you speak to the church the Lord we realize the first church age made a mistake but they did not listen to the spirit but they listened to man but you said Lord in the last days that will be another group rise up and they will listen to the spirit that speaks to the church and with the pure word they will return to the power of Pentecost to welcome back the Lord father we believe that we are a people tonight who are under the umbrella of the Pentecostal blessing Lord the things you said would be in your church we believe we are those people tonight father made a lion roar forth and may we hear what's being spoken Lord and the author may we be as James said not just hearers of the word but may we be doers of that which we hear Lord blessed brother Samuel father bless the officers of the church bless this church in a mighty way let it be a light Lord in the midst of darkness here in this area Lord make great signs and wonders be wrong at the hands other believers have made this community know that thou art the same yesterday today and forever because they see you manifested through your people Lord heal our sick tonight encourage the discouraged father that when we leave the building may we say dinner on our hearts burn within us because the lion has roared in the midst of the congregation tonight granted Lord God for we ask these things in Jesus name and the bride says you may be seated tonight it never fails my coat back there there's a hanger always on the pulpit so I thought I'd look first Amen may the Lord bless you tonight who's gonna help me preach good good amen now the lion roared now - roar - roar the word roar there are interchangeable words that you can use for the word roar and yet project the same thought that you can take the words and exchange these words with one another and not change the meaning of the context of the subject that you're bringing forth so you can sync the word roar or you can take the word blast the word roar and the word blast has the same meaning and blast is the same word as voice and voice is the same as roar and roar is the same as report or roaring is the same as roar or even noise is the same interchangeable word as roar so when Isaiah said who hath believed our report you can actually say who has believed the roar and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed you can actually say who have believed the roar and not change the meaning of the word only brother granted was on sunset mountain he said he heard a blast but you can actually say that he heard a roar and not changed the meaning of the context of the subject that he's bringing forth let me show you what I mean in size' it's a is this the sign of the end time served said as soon as they left the constellation of larger birds came and they looked like doves sharp pointed wings kind of great color little lighter color than what these first little messengers were and they were coming eastward swiftly and no sooner than they got out of my side he had turned again to look westward and there it happened there was a blast that actually shook the whole earth now don't miss the then you won't take me sure you get this right first the blast and I thought it sounded like a sound barrier whatever you would call it when prey when planes cross the sound the sound comes back to the earth it just shook like roared everything it just shook like like roared everything I never heard such a terrific blast just shook the rocks row down I thought I must have jumped 5 foot off the ground it just scared me and all at once something said look up with the roar came the voice to look up and there it was and then he told me it's the opening of the seven seals turned home saints of God tonight the seven seals have been opened you see we're not building the wall brother Samuel we're building a building and there comes times when you build a building you come to a corner and when you come to the corner you make that turn if you start here you go there go there go there but when you make that turn you're heading back to where you come from as the opening of the seals where is it turning it's turning our hearts towards home the lion has roared who will not fear the Lord God has spoken who can but prophesy no prophecies the foretelling or prediction of what is to come a divinely inspired utterance or revelation amen now in the animal kingdom there are four main big cats The Lion the Tyger the leopard and the Jaguar now each of these four big cats they have especially adapted larix which enables them to roar your kitty cat is a cat but it don't roar it purrs amen but these cats are built in such a way that their learnings is especially built that gives them the ability to roar but the thing about the lion even over the leopard and the Jaguar is the lion his Lenox is longer he's got the longest Irish in other words she's a special built cat which means he can produce by far the loudest roar the roar of a sudden the reason Oh feeling good he'll is the line able to roar like that me because his larynx is made in a special way he's built by his creator to have the ability to roar other big cats can roar but not like the lion it reminds me what the Prophet said there's been churches churches Brides Brides churches Brides but there's got to come a real bride have this cries hallelujah her blue blaze our spirit given it's a special build through the people and this people has the voice they have the ability to speak a little a man he's built by the Creator to have this ability to roar other cats can roar but none like the lion amen amen hallelujah now once the Prophet said this there's a special built church how did he bring Christ here by the word of the prophets is that right and how will he bring his bride here by the words of the prophets amen how did he have indicate Christ is coming how did he have indicate that Christ was on the earth by a man with the spirit of Elijah about him how will he have indicate his bride on the earth there'll be a forerunner with the spirit of Elijah upon him but same word speaks for the group speaks also for the bride she's bone of his bone flesh of his flesh spirit of experience blood of his blood life of his life she is him expressed on the earth and as he was the fulfillment of the prophetic words of a prophet the bride is a prophetic fulfillment hallelujah of the words of the prophets so she is a spoken word bride the bride's actions her character everything about this bride will be the result of prophetic utterance a spoken word bride why because Christ is a spoken word groom Amen hallelujah do you love him Amen he promised in the last days he would send Elijah before he destroyed the earth like it was in the days of Sodom he promised it that he would turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers now like the lioness of the lion has built the roar the bride is built by the word to not only receive the word but she's built to speak that word hallelujah a spoken word bride now how loud is a lion's roar a normal human shout is around 70 decimals anything about 120 decimals it becomes physically painful to the human ear so if you're 80 somewhere around somewhere 70 is about a somebody yelling at all gave 70 decimals anything higher than that when he gets around 120 it becomes physically painful to your ears but a lion his roar is from around a hundred and ten to a hundred and fourteen decimals oh gosh that's twice as loud as a human voice the roar of the lion can travel five miles my god that's almost back to the hotel room five miles now why does the landlord to establish their territory to scare away rivals they're also thought to roar to communicate so the roar of the line is the communication to the private you know while I know crew like a crew cuz he ain't trying to talk to a crew he's trying to talk to another lion and Jesus said my sheep hear my voice it's a form of communication the cheetah don't understand it the bear don't understand it the squirrel don't understand it but the pride understands the roar of the lion [Music] booyah the roar is a form of communication a pride of lions could have a huge territory up to a hundred and sixty square miles so the roaring of the line helps maintain the territory without having to cover the whole distance in other words you don't have to be everywhere and at all times he can just run he could just sit down a roar and let's still know he's around it reminds me what the Bible says in Psalms 107 he said his word he sent His Word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions how can two walk together except they agree the Bible says this will align roar in the forest when he's taken no prey will a young line cry out of his death if he's taking nothing what's the Bible saying there's simply this a line don't roar just to be roaring and God don't speak just to be speaking a lion only roars when he's trying to accomplish something or something's getting ready to happen Oh God the brother said when he roars in these last days let's take heed and know something's fixin to happen know that God never does anything that was that first he roars it forth [Music] [Applause] hallelujah when he roars for something did something follows that roar when God gives on the roar something's coming for tanky pay attention amen when the word has been spoken for a certain generation there's going to be somebody on the scene that will fulfill that word because God spoke it it's a vindication of the spoken word amen that's the harmony between Jesus and the father he never did anything till he's seen the father do it first or the father that was the harmony between God and Christ so will the bride he shows her his word of life he shows her and she receives it and never doubts it had nothing can harm her not even death forth the seed be planted the water will raise it up here's the secret the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name she does it in his name while there is power in the name of Jesus she has thus sayeth the Lord then it's journalize so the Holy Spirit waters it until it's grown and serves its purpose Hey amen they do only his will no one can persuade them differently they have dust saith the Lord or they keep still how does she have dust saith the Lord for the Lord has already spoken and she says what did he say she's saying under that prophet messenger saying what the Spirit says spoken word it's not just that well what am I going to speak into existence today it's not that but it's when he speaks and you say what he says like when the Prophet was something and God said what are you hunting he said squirrel God said how many you need he said the Linnet God said speak it I was telling at home the other day down in down in Mexico then a few ago a man was telling me this story he come over to Colorado to plant some trees on a green card to come over here to work in the country and so he Dave gonna fair they had sprayed this this weed killer stuff to kill all the undergrowth and they were planting these seedlings to to build back this area that they had lumbered and so they hired these Mexicans to come in and they had to plant a hundred tree saplings a day that was their job any of you forgot to fill up his canteen that day and while he was working he got thirsty run out of water and there was a creek running through there and he drank the water out of the creek but it wasn't long after he done that that he realized he poisoned himself because the spray that had sprayed the kill had gotten into the water and he had drank that weed killer into his body and he told me said brother I know I was dying I knew that I was dying said I had a buddy with me and he said I'll stay here so I can tell your family what happened to you he said I was sitting there on a I believe he said a stump where they kind of treat us he said I was sitting there and I could feel my life leaving my body he said all at once something spoke inside me and said I need a lemon and when that spoke he said I said what that said I said I'd need a lemon and he said brother Daryl God is my witness I looked beside the stump was a lemon he said I hate it I hate everything I believe I would - he said I hate the Rhine I hate to see I hate the whole inning he said after a while I felt my strength coming back and just a little bit I was able to go back to work and when I got up to leave he said my buddy been sitting down the whole time he said where did that lemon come from he said brother Daryl where did that lemon come from I said he Charlotte Jarrah God will provide himself a lamb they have dust settle hoarder they'll keep still they will do the works of God for it is himself in them continuing his word to fulfill it as he did not complete in his days all face when he was here he did not complete all when he was here for it was not yet time but now it is time for the fulfillment of the Ministry of Jesus Christ where will he complete that ministry and use the pride does the pride of the ministry yes sir it'll be a great ministry amen Isaiah said I said 55 my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are my ways your ways saith the Lord God said I don't think like you think my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are my way through ways so God's thoughts and my thoughts are not the same thoughts unless I was the casting on my thoughts and think his thoughts then if I thought only his thoughts then his thoughts in my thoughts would be the same thoughts well you did some of you didn't eat man there but if I can show you in the Bible we a minute now don't lie you're in church do that not nice if I can show you by the Bible that a son of God can get the mind of God and speak God's mind okay here goes who created the animals it's not a trick question remember Sunday School God created the animals but who named them out of this how did Adam know what to name the animals Adam said you're a monkey you're a bear you're a cheetah you're alive and God said that's exactly what I was thinking hallelujah Adam had the mind of God and when we get the mind of God concerning this our lives will be restored the third pole will manifest among us and our bodies will be changed because that's Gloria that's God's taken for this hour is that our bodies will be changed this ain't lose the stain this ain't Westley's day this is broad day this is rapture our whoo when you speak God's words you are speaking God's thoughts concerning healing concerning salvation concerning prophecy concerning you amen hallelujah let's God thoughts and he expresses it it becomes his word and when a son of God by faith takes the Word of God into his heart and speaks it back upon his lips it's just the same as deity speaking because the Sun is not speaking his thoughts he's speaking the father's tongues hey man you see it's got to the place you can't listening to nobody anymore CNN says Fox is fake Fox says CNN say everything you turn on it's fake news and a fact checking everything even while the man's talking they've got somebody back there looking it's got to the place people don't know what to believe when they hear the news they don't know if Trump colluded or not it depends on who you're listening to when I was a boy it wasn't that way when you heard the evening news you heard the evening news but we're living in an hour that people spend things and twist things and work things around that you don't even know what to believe the brothers said it's got to the place you can listen to nobody so there's only one voice that I know that sure there's only one thoughts I know that's food and that's what God said for conscience and every man's worth me a lot and let my word be true so I'd rather take what God said over what anybody else said a man he said let every man's word be a lie let mine be true even the father himself owned mountains figurations said this is my beloved son hear ye him who hear nothing else but him you've got no right to listen to anything else contrary to him hear ye him why because the lion have roared God has gave us his word God has gave us his thoughts concerning us you see the seals the mysteries of God where it was those mysteries kelp within God remember he asked the prophet Ezekiel can these bones live now Ezekiel is a prophet but what Sally answered God God said Ezekiel can these bones live you know what he said Lord God thou knowest God don't tell his prophets everything God thou who have the answer God did who's got the answer today God does at the opening of the seals the opening of the mysteries of God wants to tell us God stops concerning us oh I like Native American flute music I I have just a wee bit of Indian in me just enough to like it I guess I got a feather hanging out there on my mirror I know I'm crazy but I'm happy leave me alone and then one of those well I like listen - flute music it's relaxing and there's that there's a Native American flute player by the name of burl he's an award-winning flute player he was he was raised in New Jersey in a Jewish home went through all the Jewish rituals war the little capital did all that now how can a Jew in New Jersey be an award a winning flute Indian Native American flute player I'm sorry that just don't match but what happened was this he was raised in a Jewish family but one day somebody come to the door with an open book and in that book was his name and it showed him he was not a Jew he was actually a Sioux Indian from ulta Rosebud Indian Reservation who had been adopted by a Jewish family and when this man found out his truth his true roots when he found out what his real DNA was he went back to what he was he plays Indian music because he's an Indian well we thought we was a drunk we thought we was a Baptist but one day the book come open and showed us that our true DNA I am NOT a Baptist I am NOT a medicine I am a son of God and what are we coming back to we are coming back to our roots I've just done my DNA test still not long ago we need y'all done your DNA kind of popular right now everybody doing it I've done mine I'll tell you right now I can go to any continent or on be at home I'll just leave it at that right there you talk about a Heinz 57 I'm one of them but I found a quote the other day they said God was my father then I found a quote the other day that said we was born by the breath of God and the Prophet said God is my mother so God is my father Donna's mother they lead by standard DNA tests knows you get 50 percent from your daddy and fifty percent from your mama so if I got 50 percent from my mama spiritually and 50 percent from my daddy spirit what does that make me an attribute of God 100 percent [Applause] God has gave us his thoughts all I gotta hurry God has gave us his thoughts concerning us then don't hear nothing else but him listen to no other voice not even your own if it's negative hear ye you he's the voice of authority amen hallelujah there's many voices in the world they many things going on many doctrines many isms but hear ye him he's the voice of final authority he's the one that'll speak he's the one that said heavens and earth shall pass away but my words shall never fail so hear ye the lion has roared when a lion roars the prophet said he said I've hunted in the jungles when a lion roars everything shuts up the monkeys the Cheetahs the hyenas even the beetles shut up said even the beetles will keep still it's a deadly hush why the King has spoken with the lion roars everything is scared pups never heard one in the jungle it'll scare you to death you'll never die from the Lions back his roar was scared you to death before he gets to you the belt comes out of his lungs he throws that head back it's like a cannon going off the big roar in his lungs who couldn't be scared the Bible says if a lion roars who will not fear all the suit says all the false prophets they run for cover when the lion roars every other voice is silenced when God speaks who can keep from prophesied what's God has spoken it then we can say what God said in prophecy for example God has spoken this day and said thus saith the Lord California will be beneath the sea and tonight I can stand here and tell you thus saith the Lord California will be beneath the sea how can you say that because God's already said it I'm only telling you what he said the lion has roared who can be professor saying what's already been said when the angel come to Mary what did he tell us our highly favored of God you're not I shall conceive and bring forth the child shows name something called Jesus and Mary said how shall this be seeing I know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her Holy Ghost shall open shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born in thee shall be called the Son of God and behold that cousin Elizabeth has also conceived a son in her old age and this is a six month with her who was called barren for with God nothing shall be impossible and then Mary says this behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to the word and the age of the parted from her why did the angel leave because Mary received his message a man be done to me according to thy word the word that word means that which has been others by a living voice not a written word not a recorded word but a living word according to thy word Mary saying by the breath that's come from your body that has formed these words I will receive the living words God says so that settles that no question it God said so that makes it right that's the final voice of authority he is all authority God has supreme authority and Mary goes and sees Elizabeth as soon as she begins to speak what the angel has said Mary which Elizabeth had said I'm with child also and she told her what the angel said and as soon as she spoke those prophetic words the baby leaped in Elizabeth Elizabeth said to Luke 144 for lo as soon as the voice of the salutation sounded in my ears the baby leaped in my womb for joy why Mary was rehearsing what the angel had said listen to this Jim that's laying in the scriptures here verse 45 Elizabeth says this and blessed is she that believeth for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord there shall be a performance of those things which were spoken the light has roared who will not fear the Lord God has spoken who came but prophesy she began to proclaim the angel what the angel had said about her and when she begins to proclaim what the angel said about her she began to manifest what the angel says she was manifesting it more and more and more what was he doing the very words that she had received had become manifested in her she was actually manifesting the angels message what was she doing not proclaiming her own words she was saying what the angel said why Mary are you with child I didn't know you Joseph I didn't know you women when was the wedding oh I'm not married to Joseph yet were just as Houseman goodness oh no it's not what you think the Holy Ghost overshadows me Oh what was she doing saying what the angel said about her and let me tell you my brother my sister it's time we get rid of this defeated talk well I'm no good I'm a failure that's just the devil's cuss words you're just saying what the devil wants you to say it's time we start confessing what we've heard said by the Prophet messenger it's time we start confessing ourselves what God said we was in the word hallelujah let's be like Mary let the Angels message become flashing her let the Angels message but Malachi for let that word become flesh in me spoken word of the Living voice in a living virgin the power of the spoken words the line hath Lord the Lord God hath made his thoughts known hallelujah do you love him tonight hallelujah oh my let me find a place I got so much a man let's just find a place that we can jump off hey man do you love him tonight a man look at this right here God told Moses when you come out bring the children to this mountain as far as God was concerned the children was already on the mountain because he'd spoken so anything that stood in Moses way he had the commission by God to speak it out of the way and when they got out there to the Red Sea you know the story he'd begin to cry and God spoke to Moses said Moses why cry to me just speak the word I have commissioned you speak that word and go forth let me tell you my brother my sister it's time we start speaking the word the message of this hour it's time we start speaking what he said about predestination what he said about election what he said about overcoming what he said about the third pole it's time we take that word into us and begin to speak it back up on a limb that it may bring forth the manifestation who a vindicate Malachi 4 grew up indicate 17:30 ruler indicate revelations 10 7 it'll be you my brother it'll be you my sister we will prove to the world that brother Branham was that Malachi 4 messenger because we will become the words he spoke and will manifest that word upon the earth the devil walks around we preach last night like a roaring lion acting like a lion but he's not a you know what his Rory is it's nothing but a bunch of noise I was in the army 18th airborne up at Fort Bragg North Carolina I fired a 155 out sir in those days I was young and I was silly I thought was invisible were they that's the way they taught us they taught us we is invincible so I never wore ear protection and I fired those big houses round after round after round we testified the one-niner eggs when they come out with those new guns we fired round after round after round and now today I have a condition called tinnitus perhaps some of you have it it's a ringing in your ear getting your ears ring my ears ring all the time I've answered phones I don't know how many times that really wasn't ring is because it was the ringing in my ear at night in the hotel room in about drives me crazy driving down the road and about driving me crazy and that's the way the devil is you know what it is it's just the noise in my ear and that's the way the devil is he's just the noise in your ear when it comes to trying to tell you take the Word of God and cut into pieces [Applause] brother the real line that's roared in this hour and when the real eye roars everything else shuts up it's time to sell the devil he's defeated you're nothing but a bluff you have no power over me I am a son of God I am a daughter of God the lion has roared and has told me my inheritance he's told us his thoughts concerning us taking the Word of God and defeat Mary to me you know brother deaf Smith sent me a little story here not long ago really blessed my heart I like to preach him share and he found this I think it was Luther that had preached on it and he sent it to me and the story goes that this I believe in his Lucifer that was preaching he's talking my sham guard and he said one of sham guards never coming over here said Sam Garth there are 600 Philistines headed towards your farm so we don't worry we're leaving right now we're gonna rally all the farmers we'll come back we'll help you whooping and Luther I believe it was Luther I'm not a bit Moody who everyone said Shamgar told his neighbor just pass on don't worry about it they're 400 short because the Bible says one will put a thousand of the flies and there's only 600 of them so there's 400 of them sort I'll take care of it myself that's the kind of attitude we need to have that's the kind of faith we need to have that's the way we need to stand up on the Word of God we need to take that promise and make it mine it needs to be a personal revelation to you God has gave me this revelation that I could put a thousand to flight speak to them health to speak for the store speak to the fear just speak through the word the lion roar just say what the line has said in this hour hey man we're better do you believe you're healed you believe God answers prayer raise your hand to him thank you for it it's over you're healed jesus said if you shall say what is it when you're out from under Babylon when you're out from under and believe when you're out from under superstition when you're out from under all these things and you're filled with God's old life your voice is his voice you are I spoke it

from the beginning to the end she's the work of her Lord and all his works are perfect in fact in her in her is summed up and manifested the eternal wisdom and purpose of God how can one famous how can one understand it though we cannot do that we can't accept it by faith for God hath spoken it the lion has roared let everything else shut up simply say what the father has said my daughter Jessica said Mike I will disclose I I got a bunch more but it's getting late I know the kids go school all that my daughter Jessica's sitting back there she's one who was in the accident struck by the train left her in a wheelchair had to feed her through her stomach told us she'd never talk again never see again never walk again never eat again if she even live they said she'd be nothing but a vegetable but I was sitting in the waiting area and I heard all the things I worked with the doctors my wife's a registered nurse worked in surgeon for years I was a surgical technician worked in surgeon for years did assistant doctors did all kinds of operations I didn't do the operation but I helped do the operation so I worked with these doctors and so they they told me with friends so they told me what they was looking at that of course you know working in surgery and seeing x-rays and MRIs you you learn to read them the doctor sometimes they'll say this is what this means and that what that and just looking at them and working day in and day out you begin to pick up those things you know and so I could look at the MRIs myself I could look at the at the scans the x-rays you could see it yourself the things that they were telling us and so I gave Jessica to the to the Lord I said Lord I can't do anything to help her so I simply give her to you if you take her life I love you as much so ever loved you but if you let her leave I'll I'll do my best to try to tell the world what you've done for her so we went to the day to the funeral some of you maybe saw her video that they put out down in Louisiana a few years ago if you took the time to watch it thank you for that I appreciate it and so I went to the funeral that day and his Shirl stayed with the folks that had come to the funeral there at the house and I slipped on back to the hospital I was sitting in the waiting area and all the doctors had spoke and they took me all their prognosis and they told me all that was going to happen but sitting in that waiting room that afternoon around 2:30 something like at 2 o'clock somewhere right in there all at once a warm feeling come over me and the line begin to roar Lord spoke to my heart and said your daughter shall live Hey so I don't look the Lord spoke to you're not well all I know she set back her [Applause] house and so she started getting better and everything came back better eyesight and they kept telling us she's gonna be blind there's no way she can see there's no surgery there's no medicine there's no therapy there's nothing we can do your daughter will be blind and I remember us holding her and the doctor standing around the bed and telling us and Jessica couldn't see she was blind but she could hear the voice and she was trying to find it and she would do her head like this trying to find that voice because she was blind and the doctor said mr. Ward were sorry but your daughter will never see again that was what they said but the lion roared the lion roared I said he hath anointed me to open the eyes of the blind that's what the word says and when they left I told Jessica Jessica you've got a lamb God provided a lamb for your eyes and I tell her every day I tell her every day I'd read Isaiah 53 I put her name in that scripture and I'd say Jessica by His stripes you are healed do you see me no daddy I don't see you you will you will see me Jessica Jessica do you see me no Danny next day Jessica do you sit no Danny but you will you
