further part of the service receiving all the glory and honor Lord to yourself Lord we love you and we thank you tonight Lord we bless your name in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you love the Lord tonight amen would you turn with me to Exodus chapter 4 Exodus chapter 4 and we'll just start reading right there in Exodus chapter 4 verse 1 I just want to read a few verses of scriptures here and Moses answered and said but behold they will not believe me nor hearken unto my voice for they will say the LORD hath not appeared unto thee and the Lord said unto Him what is that in thine hand and he said a rod and he said cast it on the ground in it and he cast it on the ground and it became a serpent and Moses fled from before it and the Lord said unto Moses put forth thine hand and take it by the tail and he put forth his hand and caught it and it became a rod in his hand that they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers the God of Abraham the god of Isaac and the God of Jacob hath appeared unto thee and the Lord said furthermore unto Him put now thine hand into thy bosom and he put his hand into his bosom and when he took it out behold his hand was a leprous of snow and he said put down hand into thy bosom again and he put his hand into his bosom again and plucked it out of his bosom and behold it was turned again as other flesh as his other flesh and it shall come to pass if they will not believe thee neither hearken to the voice of the first sign that they will believe the voice of the latter sign and it shall come to pass if they will not believe also these two signs neither harken unto thy voice that thou shalt take of the water of the river and pour it upon the dry land and the water which they'll take us out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land may God bless the reading of his word as you're being seated would you go back up to Exodus 3 verse 16 with me I'd like to pick right up right there and here is the Lord telling Moses what to do go and gather the elders of Israel together and say unto them the Lord God of your father's the God of Abraham of Isaac and of Jacob appeared unto me saying I have surely visited you and seeing that which is done to you in Egypt and I have said I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the canaanites and the Hittites and the amorite and the perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites unto a land flowing with milk and honey and they shall hearken to thy voice and thou shalt come thou and the elders of Israel unto the king of Egypt and you shall say unto Him the Lord God of the Hebrews hath met with us and now let us go we beseech thee three days journey in the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God I'd like to draw your attention here tonight as we looked at last week that signs and wonders the scriptures are very clear that has it gives God gives the distinction for his true church in mark chapter 16 that signs and wonders shall follow them that believe and we we recognize that signs and wonders as we see as we read here in the opening part of exodus form where that Moses is responding to the commission that God has has given to him where he is meeting God face to face and Moses speaks in a manner and says they're not going they won't believe me they'll ask who is it that has sent you they will ask what is your name and they that they might know that that that God indeed hath sent me because they will say the Lord hath not appeared unto thee and you see God in this right here God asked Moses to take something that is very very simple that he's been carrying around and when it is submitted under the obedience of the voice of God notice the rod and staff that he's had in his hand it becomes a serpent when he casts it on the ground his hand when he is obedient to the voice of God and he puts his hand into his bosom it becomes leprous you see sometimes when we're looking at that of for miracles and for signs and wonders it's not something that's far out here but it's something that's very close to you that God desires to be submitted and when it's submitted in obedience to his voice God can take something and is able to transform it as a sign and a wonder that's the same way that God does you know God will never reach down and take a heart but a heart must be surrendered to him it's not something that is way out there but it's simply that God would ask of our life and through by the surrender of our life that our life would actually be a sign and a wonder a paradox that you cannot explain what has happened within your life but you know that there has been a change that has taken place what was it it was simply God getting your attention and when he got your attention he spoke to you and once he speaks to you then there's something that rises out of your heart to obey what is it that is given to you and I to be able to obey it is simply that that God has foreordained that where when his voice his presence would come across our path he asked us for something that's so simple and yet out of our life it's submitted to him now I want you to think of a very familiar place that brother Ram would take us over and over again of how that Moses himself knew about the promise of God but yet when he got into the presence of the Living God it was there that he received and was equipped with what was needed in order to take the job because remember the job itself would have been a job that for the natural man he would've easily got discouraged a job that he would have easily been frustrated a job that he would have been overwhelmed that's the same way it is within our life because sometimes we can get discouraged we can get overwhelmed if we start looking through these eyes instead of looking through the eyes on the inside that looks into the promise of the Living God and says Lord the promise that you've made you're able to perform it you see you've met someone you've been somewhere and you know that there is a living power that you have met that's able to bring about what it is that he has spoken in your life you see that's why that each and every one of us must first be a sign and Wonder we must be a miracle a paradox of God in order to actually believe in miracles because the greatest miracle that has ever been much greater than even that of the virgin birth is that of the new birth and to think of it there is a miracle from that new birth that places you and I in Jesus Christ and here we are as a part of the body of Jesus Christ those who are promised to come forth in the first resurrection some of us will be alive and remain others of us may go by the way of the grave have some have gone ahead before us but regardless of not we are part of the greatest miracle that is getting ready to strike the face of the earth where there is going to come a literal change within the body of Jesus Christ what all the prophets have looked for what all of them by inspiration have been caught up though they were not able to be a partaker of it but they were a partaker of that same Holy Spirit that now resides in our heart and that same quickening power that has raised you and I that raised up the Lord Jesus Christ that same quickening power that packed away Enoch is that same quickening power that raised up Isaiah that same quickening power that raised up Jeremiah that same quickening power that raised up Elijah and Elisha and that same quickening power one of these days will sweep right over us and there will be a change in our life we believe that all believers believe there is a literal Lord Jesus Christ there is a literal corporal coming is that right so now within this the signs and wonders that are given that that Moses would ask they're going to ask this because they're not just going to take my word for it so you see God has a way of delivering his word God accompanies his word with signs and wonders we looked at that last week the Bible says at the end of march 16 that the Lord was with them working confirming the word with signs and wonders and miracles the Bible picks it up in acts 2:22 that Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God among you doing both signs and wonders so how was his approval it wasn't that he could quote the prophets it wasn't that he knew the Psalms what was it that was vindicated God approved him in their myths by signs and wonders but it was not the signs and wonders that God was wanting them to focus on but rather the signs and one that would make them aware of the presence of the Living God there is a word a message that's getting ready to come forth Omaha I'm glad that God knows exactly what he's doing his signs and wonders that God gives do not come with a voice that would just hold people in the same pattern that they've always been in but any true sign and wonder of God will always call you to the promise of God which we've read right here in Exodus 3 programs said it like this if Moses he said when he got before that bush if the voice would have spoke out of that bush any other thing outside of the scriptural promise Moses would have never received it would it have been a phenomenal thing it would have booth above the bush being on fire would have been a wonderful thing but it never would have touched Moses life or put him into action let me say this to you there are many signs and wonders there are miracles that happen outside of the ranks of the bride of Jesus Christ miracles are not confined just to the bride of Jesus Christ's miracles are to them who believe signs and wonders are given to them who believe but I believe with all of my heart that they we are given by God's grace the signs and wonders to recognize his presence and to recognize that his word that our faith would rise within that word because let me tell you something a sign in a wonder is not our inheritance but a signs and wonders accompany us pointing us to our full inheritance are you with me now now notice this the Prophet himself when you think of it all of this wood that was given they wont hearken to my voice all of the signs that were given was so that the people would actually come to a place of submitting themselves to the voice of God now the voice of God was not going to be to where that you know they were just looking at Moses word but they would recognize that this is God's Word now and when we look at God's Word God's Word will always speak according to its promise now think of this of how that God he appears here in the midst of the bush and when he gets Moses attention now first of all God ain't going to speak without getting your attention you know it's like you and me if you go to start talking to me you'll probably wait if you say I'm not paying attention but once you see that you've got my attention hey brother Samuel hey brother so-and-so hey hey once you've got my attention then you'll say what you want to say you see god when he performs signs and wonders it is not just to show that he's gone but he performs signs and wonders to get our attention and it's something about it that for our life it gets our attention and then God Himself can come right behind that sign in wonder and begin to make known a promise that he has ordained for this hour and this time now think of this in this hour when you look at Moses of here he is he's called by God to go down there and there's two signs God gives him two signs now look these signs he was ordained a prophet wasn't he he was already born a prophet he did not become the prophet of God standing there in the pillar of fire but what happened is it was already ordained as a prophet of God but in the presence of the Living God God brought forth the gift that already was laying in Moses life even when Moses was sucking on the pacifier when Moses himself was playing with the toys in the floor he was already a prophet of God but what happened is he had to have an activation in his life because Moses himself had a lot of credentials Moses had credentials as a great general in the army of God he knew exactly how to fight how to conquest how to position armies in battle but you see that was not God's Way of using any bit of his intellect and his knowledge of positioning but rather God Himself would call Moses off to the side to where Moses would actually forget about the calling of God on his life but God didn't God never forgot about the calling on his life because it was in Moses that called himself in the first place it was God that called him and God that placed the credentials on the inside but you see without the credentials being activated there's a way to question it it's like tonight you know I think about enough said this many times when I went to school Bowling Green and I had obtained a bachelor's within teaching that batch degree did not make me a teacher when I obtained the master's degree in administration he did not make me that it only gives me the necessary credentials of what was already laying in my life I now have the proof of what has always laid there I believe that with all my heart I've got it ordained that I would be a teacher on somebody in the natural I believe that I believe that God ordained that in my life and I believe that God has just a specific part within our life that God knows exactly what he wants out of our life God is not the author of confusion as I told the young people some months ago when you begin to look in your life God it's not the author confusion he does not put you in this life without a skill in your life to be refined in order to support yourself because Bible says when God appeared regarding the Tabernacle in the wilderness he said that I have placed within Bezalel the skill of wisdom to know how to work with all manners of artifice and brass and so forth it is us coming to the place and submitting our lives to say Lord you know the skills that you put in my life Lord you know what you put in my life and I would be able to support myself in the natural but yet what we lean on is the Living God Oh glory be to God so God knows exactly what he's doing as Moses comes into this place and God would begin to speak to him where Moses comes forth from the presence of God he comes with the necessary credentials they're gonna ask has he appeared to you see he what he's asking for I've got to have credentials it's got to be credentials and you know what he's asking for he's asking for God to activate what God's already placed in his life he was already ordained as a prophet he's simply coming to a place to ask God to activate what's in his life you know that's exactly the way it is with your life you know what you are always safe you are always a believer you're always a she you had the credentials on the inside to live a real godly overcoming life but what it is you had to get in the presence of him who laid the credentials in your life and when coming in his presence he's able to raise up what he already has ordained right there in your life in his presence so that there is no other school there's no other Church there's no man can take glory in your life all the glory goes to God it's God who seeks you out it's God who brings you to himself it's God who cleans you up and it's God who activates the credentials in your life now think about this you know when God gives a sign God does not give a sign that just would keep us going within one great circle but when God speaks there's a voice behind what's spoken there are necessary credentials now to think of this that in many of the times you know when you look at when God would begin to speak you see when we look at that of a prophet think of it how many times that even brother Branham here he is standing here he's standing in there before many men that have been schooled and great Babel colleges they know a lot of different things but remember how many of them said oh my when the anointing is on brother Branham you I'll tell you what boy he's a prophet of God but you better watch as his teaching and brother Brian would come back and say you don't even know what a prophet is it's not the signs but it's the message that follows the signs are given to that of confirm remember if they won't believe the heed to the voice from the first sign then there will be given another sign and that they would heed to that voice if they still won't hearken to the voice I'll give them another sign you see what God is so focused that God will not leave one speck or one iota that a person can say well you know God you you never made it known to me you you never made known that this message was the truth you never made it known right here that Moses was that man no quite the contrary when God makes himself known by signs and wonders as God was doing right here with the sign of the Messiah it was a prophet himself is a sign that there is a messy that's going forth together the people into the inheritance listen to me brother man tells us that that belly gram had the message of repentance down path but Billy Graham did not have the Ministry of reconciliation in order to bring the people from repentance into the true baptism of the holy ghost it was confusion for Billy Graham he thought that them preachers were just lazy and that's why people weren't going on with God but brother Randall puts it back to the place he said when Paul came along Paul not only preached and brought that person from repentance but he brought him all the way into that of the true baptism of the Holy Ghost where that man soul was set on fire you see that is necessary credentials for the bride of Jesus Christ thank God you know they have their part Billy Graham that is part Oral Roberts has their part the RAM says they are messages of the hour but we also have a message of the hour and we have that message of the hour that God has delivered to us by and through His Prophet it was a promise of God that God has made known within this hour now to think of this these these credentials that are given let me just try to move through this here just a little bit when you think of it in Acts chapter 2 here the Lord Jesus he's raised from the great here he is he's walking with the disciples they do not know that it's him but notice what he does he begins to take them and point them in the word so that they themselves their confidence will be built in the word why because the next stage of the journey they are going to have to have faith in the word it will not be enough that they recognize the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ that was no doubt what a wonderful time those 40 days 40 days they were there with him my rejoicing you never knew when he was going to show up didn't know whether it was gonna be on a fishing trip or whatever more you didn't know but he was right there with them what was he doing he was instructing them not just signs and wonders but he was instructing them with things pertaining to the kingdom of God what was he doing building their faith in the word because the word hell promised for their life so they've got to have faith in the word Oh glory now think of this here when they recognized here when Peter here as they're waiting and notice has the Holy Spirit that is promised it begins to descend and here when they come out in Acts chapter 2 the the the the disciples step forth and notice as they begin to come out of there they come out of the upper room they were fearful upon going in there they were hiding but when something took place in their life when that which was spoken of by the Prophet had moved into their life they no longer were fearful but they came out of there with the same one who made the promise was now living on the inside of them they were no longer they were not motivated by their self but it was that promise that God had made known to Peter when you're converted then strengthen your brethren you see it was a promise that he had made known to him by commandment he says I want you to go and wait upon the promise which you shall receive of my father you see there's got to be a moving into full inheritance here they were they were ordained witnesses chosen before the foundation of the world that these the very resurrection would be made manifest to them but notice what indeed the manifestation of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus was to do was to bring them in obedience to the word that would be commanded to go and wait until you are endued with power from on high you see there is a full inheritance the word when God gives a message a word in every generation as he has down through the seven churches it has not been a word that has left people in their condition and told them they're alright and you know God loves you no sir but it's a word that came to address the condition and call the people out of that condition and into that of the land that God was ordaining for those people you see Satan himself is so subtle he won't try to take away the word per se from people but he wants to remove the land and the land itself is the real true baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth because without the new birth the land itself does not yield its strength it does not yield its power you can rest there within the word but yet you don't have the real full spiritual blessings that is promised to those who are really in the word and the word being the body of Jesus Christ you see God's desire is not just to bring you to a church the Prophet himself speaking in God's chosen place of worship 1965 in November he says Here I am with a message and I'm calling you to come out of this mess and if I'm calling you to come out of this mess aren't I gonna take you cease asking a question because of this message thank you jump you are you with me the the reality of the message is it does not produce wandering it is a positional placing in Jesus Christ alone somebody that's an effect of this word so within it then he asks the question where am I going to take you he said am I gonna take you to Branham Tabernacle it's as much at fault as the rest of them but he said there's only one place that I can take you there's only one place of safety and that is in Jesus Christ for he is God's chosen place of worship a rest of church is not our resting place even if we were to go to Branum Tabernacle that is not our resting place but our resting place is in the person of Jesus Christ and there by one spirit we are baptized into one body and that body is the Word of God it takes the power of God to move down and get a hold of the believers and to lift you and I out of the chaos of Egypt and point you and I to the promise of God the full inheritance that belongs to you and I and the just say like this in this hour it's not just the baptism of the Holy Ghost but the baptism of the Holy Ghost it leads itself all the way to the change of the body because there's not another age there's not another message to come after this we are at the end time we are at that time where it's time for the change and the rapture the Church of the Living God we're standing in that hour no repeater God you see Jesus he already said my sheep know my voice but you see his sheep recognize him as he comes by signs and wonders is that right but remember there's got to be a voice accompany that sign I'd wonder if that voice I don't care how it sign and wonder if that voice points back to a previous Junction it's not of God come on the signs and wonders it's not of God that's why we look for what is being said no matter what signs and wonders are done if the voice that comes and wants to look at signs and wonders as a vindication of we don't need this anymore all we need is this and all we need of that that ain't of God those signs and wonders it's not of God it's not for the people of God but the people of God notice what signs and wonders will do it accompanies the voice of God to confirm the word to our life for you and I to March with authority knowing that the very Living God is in our midst and I'm so glad and we need him to encourage us oh glory now watch this how that Paul would bring this around on condena on credentials in Romans 11 verse 13 for I speak to you Gentiles in as much as I am the apostle of the Gentiles I magnify mine office and watch what Paul's doing here many other places we could look within the scripture but Paul is letting it be known this is my office Paul is not bragging Paul is simply stating his position are you with me you see within this right here for the people of God in that hour it did not make them think of Paul has some dictator some who think no as a matter of fact for the beloved of the Lord this is a great comfort because listen you want somebody who knew who knows who they are knows where they're standing is that right you've got to have that it's got to be somebody who knows I tell you what I want somebody when somebody stands here and I invite them in I don't want somebody that says well I don't know I belong I you know I I don't know where what church I go to I you don't need to stand here in this pulpit then because you know why you don't even know where you belong you don't know where your position you don't know where it's out over the center but we're positioned and tries but we ought to know where we belong in the body of Jesus Christ we ought to know our election and our calling and make it sure we ought to know where we belong romans 15 verse 13 what's how paul goes on to this now the god of Hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing joy and peace in believing that ye may abound in Hope through the power of the Holy Ghost and I myself also am persuaded of you my brethren that ye also are full of goodness filled with all knowledge able also to admonish one another nevertheless brethren I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort as putting you in mind because the grace that is given to me of God that I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles ministering the gospel of God that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable being sanctified by the Holy Ghost so Paul you know he's not Paul's not taken back and said well you know I just you know I know Paul is is stating here I know what God has called me to do I am the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles when the Prophet went beyond the curtain of time what did he ask he asked will Paul have to stand and give an account and he said yes they said yes he will and he will be accepted What did he say he said I have preached just exactly what Paul preached and what did we say we're resting on that so the same voice of this message this hour it cannot dove it cannot be VA from that of the gospel of Jesus Christ that was committed to Paul but you know what it is it's called glory be to God it's called accomplishing what he started with you and ask sometimes get on projects and we bought off more than we can chew we get on a project and we're ready to start looking in the phone book who in the world can I come fix can I come to get this mess let me tell you something to God of he'll glory that started this work that started it out when he separated from the body of Jesus Christ what was needed to bring forth that body and they tell you something there has been things down through the ages where Satan is sought to come here but God's promise will not be defeated God's Word cannot be defeated God has promised that he will present to himself a glorious church without spot wrinkle or blemish you know the very power of God that cleansing our so changing our very nature that same God will produce in our life where there will not be one wrinkle what God starts he finishes how many times look what Paul look look Paul's the one he that began the good work in you shall perform it to the day of Jesus Christ is there right looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith you seek us Paul himself was not just a believer he was a believer Paul was one who had been touched by the Living God and to know that what God has said in his word he will perform and he will fulfill Paul was one who knew that there are names that were written before the foundation of the world that we were chosen in Christ Jesus and Paul knew there's no way that you and I could ever get away from it but God Himself will is the way that he would bring us back to what he has ordained verse 17 I have therefore where of I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God for I will not dare to speak of any of those things which God hath not wrought by me to make the Gentiles obedient by word and deed through mighty signs and wonders by the power of the Spirit of God notice this obedience and word indeed there was signs and wonders that accompanied Paul's ministry and you know as we read this last week you read in the book of Acts signs and wonders accompanied the believers for what reason just for God to show that he's God no but God was letting it be known listen to what they're saying come on somebody you say well they weren't Paul I know they weren't Paul but it was Jesus and a mini member body you with me how God started that church now Paul himself Peter recognized the commission that Paul has been entrusted with as a matter of fact Peter admonished some of them and said look there's some of y'all you don't understand what Paul's saying but just believe and recognize that God is with him because there's some who are unlearned they cannot they wrestle with what Paul was saying they try to make sense of it God does not interested in you and I'm making sense of his word he is his own interpreter you see what happens is is a time where people say oh I was told to put that on the shelf I was told if I didn't believe that just set it up there you see if I see what their belief was their faith was based on their ability to explain that's science but faith which is of God is not based on the ability of this right here to be able to explain it but faith accepts what God said because God said it and when God has said it it's gonna be how is it gonna be I don't know the Prophet said when he made known to me two signs were to come my ministry he said I didn't know how was gonna happen I didn't understand it he did not know the transitions even when brother Brennan was standing there I believe it was in Illinois and he's standing there had been ministering there the first sign the first pool and right there on the platform here comes the discernment your name is so-and-so sister I see this in this and that right been in there a transition into that of the second sign or the second pole right there he had no control over the transition can't you see in your life in my life it's not you and I that has control over the transitions all we have to do is walk in obedience to the Living God and God Himself that knows what's in our lives he will perform the transition and alert us to what's needed at that time Omaha will know when it comes time at that moment in a twinkling of an eye because we will see our loved ones that will appear to us it will be a transition in that moment where the very atoms of our body are changed God holds the transitions you see it's just like in your life when a person is soon when they're struggling they're trying to make their walk with God you can't make your walk with God you've got to submit you've got to fall in love with him you've got to let it be him and nothing else you see if you can let it be him and nothing else let's take for example let's say you got a person tonight then maybe they're bound with drugs and they've come here and they say you know what I want to be free of these drugs I just you know what I'm tired I'm tired of being a servant and a slave to these drugs now God can move for them and help them to see that he indeed is a living God and he cares about their need but if in their heart maybe they would rise up in their heart and say you know what there is something greater you know I want to get in him I know that he is my deliverance I know that he is all that I need and if I get in him and he's my all and all then I have access to deliverance I have access to healing I have access to everything because he is my all in all you see we just don't want to be riders that come along and we make God as an errand boy of what God can do for us can God do this for us and God do that for so most the time what happens with that it ends up being in grateful people and the only reason that they serve God and the only reason that they'll try to live for God is because of what can God can do for them but when you recognize what he's already done for you that he came down from glory and he came down and shed his blood and gave His life and sent the Holy Ghost after you the ministry of divine grace it reaches around your heart in a love affair and you recognize he has already done for you the greatest thing that can ever be done for you he made a way that you could come back home when that grep surrounds your heart everything else is secondary now watch how Paul would place this here let me go on Ephesians 1 Paul could say Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ he already have are you with me Paul where is Paul reading Paul is not down here on this level Paul is reading to what has already been allotted to you and I it's already there every promise but we've got to get into the land where the promise can be made manifest that we should be according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good will good pleasure of his will now when you look at this let me just refer to this here this quote you can read it will send it out but a blended random makes us very clear he is speaking in God's chosen place of worship and it soon when I you look at about the RAM speaking it it's the heart of the gospel God does not bring us out to just leave us but there is unexpected in that God is ministering from you see when God when we look at this book of Ephesians that were reading from this book of Ephesians it parallels that of Joshua Joshua itself the Prophet would call it the book of redemption in the Old Testament it is a place where each and every one had their place already allotted and given to him when they were being birthed remember their mother would call out the name how did she know what they because it was spiritually given to her and within that name it held within it the actual identity and location and the place when they came there that the spiritual blessings could be made manifest about their life but you see what it took God already has ordained it it's taken just submission to his will and his leading you see the whole part of signs and wonders is to build our faith in the voice of God it's to recognize his voice now listen God's voice itself this is not just confined to a certain state or a certain accent but God's voice is the very Spirit of God are you with me the same Holy Spirit is speaking the word the same God that gave Moses the credentials the same God gave Joshua credentials the same God gave credentials all the way down through even the New Testament where God would have the fifl Ministry dog would give them necessary credentials that were there would be activated just as he has within our life as spiritual believers now watch this redemption itself is two parts it's coming out of and going into so just to come out it's not enough but we must go into so when we look at that but the RAM talks about there's two different aspects of God's command and to think of that he says that as you know we're in our journey that journey that they were in it represents for our day as they were in the journey coming from Egypt into a promised land so we have come out of the world of Egypt chaos and our on our road to a promised land in my father's house are many mansions if it wasn't so I would have told you so you see where that we are headed to in the promises of God is that of where for the very change of the body in my father's house are many mansions now who has all of this Christ himself remember in Christ is the Millennium he is our headstone it is in him that all of the promises lay for the RAM goes on he says remember it's the law that brings us to recognize we're wrong but it's grace that forgives us you see there's a necessary part of law law itself will bring conviction you're wrong and you recognize my I am wrong I'm dead wrong I need help and when you recognize you need help Lord Jesus forgive me Lord God Lord I accept you us as my Savior grace steps in and it does what you cannot do grace steps in after law has done what it needs to do great steps in now let's watch this in Romans 1 verse 16 for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith see what it is God giving faith and then from that faith you walk in the light that God has opened to your heart maybe God has touched your heart and you recognize I need to give my life the Lord it takes faith to rise within your heart to recognize but that's for me but I he died for my sins I'm a sinner and I need him what is it it's faith that rises within your heart to be able to even make that step and accept what he's already done and as you walk faithful within that you watch righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith but you see if you're looking at well I got this and I've got that you're looking at the wrong thing you need to look to him because he that has called you faithful is he to perform Romans 5:10 for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son notice we were reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life see Paul is picking up that you and I were already the purchase was already made for us you just didn't recognize it the payment was already made for you but then the good news comes along it touches your heart you recognize I'm a sinner but it points that out to and says hey I already paved the way for you and then you recognize and say yes Lord Jesus I'm coming home what is it he's reconciling you to himself it is a voice accompanying a sign and a wonder to bring you to himself not just to leave you in a state of limbo and not only so but we also join God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we have now received the atonement how many know that Paul when he writes there I believe it's in 2nd Corinthians 3 where Paul writes about he hath made us able ministers of the New Testament you know what I'm talking about Abel no he not us not our abilities he hath made us able ministers capable equipped oh my we have been commended by the Living God has ministers of the New Testament what is that New Testament it is the word and the spirit it is the life of Jesus Christ the supreme sacrifice the groom himself he is writing his own life in the life of the believer able ministers of the New Testament now watch this second Corinthians 5:17 therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new and all things are of God who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and have given to us the Ministry of reconciliation hello Paul your boasting no Paul's just Satan Satan what he has he what's he doing is the people's faith are rising remember what he told the Corinthian church you had a lot of guys that were going around they had signs and wonders and they were saying I'm a Hebrew and I'm this and that and Paul said hold on just a moment would you bear with me in my folly they're Hebrew I'm Hebrew they're Israel I am Israelite and Paul let it be known that I have been approved among you God has approved the ministry Paul would go so far to tell the Corinthian church that I don't need letters of commendation to come unto you but you are our commendation you are our epistles that are written from within our heart notice the revelation was here and now that same revelation that was resting in the able ministers of God that same pillar fire did you shoot out by way of the word and in row upon the tables of the heart what did it do it activated the credentials as believers in the word for that our Torah be to God he has come given to us the Ministry of reconciliation are you catching this reconcile means to bring two things in harmony this Ministry of reconciliation he certainly be known that there has been a loosening of a ministry that brings harmony harmony between God and man that which is able to do away with a sinful nature that which is able to join God and man together once again as he was in Christ Jesus Jesus Christ notice here to wit that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation you see Paul could let him know that the ministry that you're under is not a wilderness ministry it's not a ministry that even is a ministry that points you back to the signs of Egypt come on somebody pro is letting it be known this ministry is the fulfillment and the ministry of the atonement the same life that was there in Jesus Christ that same life has come forth to be present in the believer what's this now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech you by us we pray you in Christ's stead be ye reconciled to God glory for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in Christ 2nd Thessalonians 2:13 we are bound to give thanks always to God for you brethren beloved of the Lord because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth Wow I chose no you didn't choose he chose your choice is only reflecting a choice he already made you couldn't make that choice if he didn't make that choice so the choice that we make now reflects the choice that he already made before the foundation of the world are you with me so it's not a struggling and persevering in us it's us yielding it's not a sitting it's us yielding we're on - look at this he called you by our gospel he's letting to know there is no other gospel he has called you by our gospel evidently this gospel it was a gospel that there were other Saints who were a part of the inheritance of light as well to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ now think of this how that Paul would place it in the book of Romans chapter 10 remember he's riding here at the first part I don't have time for all the verses but Paul was riding there those who are reading the Jews here they are they're reading they're reading all of these prophecies and Paul was letting them know you're reading I'm saying them in your mouth but what is needed the word it's not here not there the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth but what's needed faith in the word so Paul goes on to say in verse 9 in verse 8 sorry but what saith the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart what is it the Word of Faith which we preach you see what was being ministered if they could just say be it unto me that's all they had to say be it unto me well how don't worry about how will be it unto me that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness still in born again still is in the full inheritance but you got to have a start man's got to believe unto righteousness but how can he believe if the righteousness of God is not made known before you how can you know that you can live our real overcoming life if that's not preached before you you're only going to as high as it's preached that's right you want to say Lord shut the hide off of me is that right I don't want to know I want the word this standard to be preached because you know what that standard being preached when it cuts us remember God knows what he's doing he's not cutting as far as your eye he's actually liberating you and I from holes within our eye and that word if we'll let the word have preeminence in our life the word will actually free because remember the Spirit of God is not a spirit of bondage it does not bring fear but the Spirit of God brings a loosening and Liberty to the children of God it lets you know who you are well for the world with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation you know so many times we allow this to be placed so far back there but remember when God has done something for you and it has touched your heart maybe you stood right here and were prayed for maybe the Spirit of God has touched your heart with something that God has made known to you I'm free I'm delivered this is mine do you realize that was not your mind up here but your heart that actually was moved in a place to believe and when it's made in a place to believe you make a confession and say the Lord has healed me brother Samuel you are going to believe what happened when I confess that God had healed me the very next day I had the worst attacks come upon my life hole glory be to God that's the sure sign that you're healed that is divine healing you see that's the time to stand when the win it's made known the promise you take faith and you stand there and confess it when anything comes contrary to that you come right back to it and said but God has spoke to my heart but God has ministered to my life and you stand there right on it you know what that is that's taking faith and standing there in the midst of the promise how many times brother Graham gave the example you see a deer that's hit on the side of the road or an animal you look at it another day or two days it's swelled up and blowed up so big why it's set is that right you look at how that after a person is prayed for you watch how the enemy that'll try you'll try to set in I'll tell you right now right here there's prayer there was there was testimonies that came right out of last Thursday testimonies from right here that came of God's healing touch hey there right sister Miranda could not even bend her hand and move it together and the Spirit of God came right down and moved for our sister in a special way that wasn't me that was God that was gone that was that was what he was doing when my Aunt Linda stood right here she sent me a text on Saturday night she said Samuel she said when you prayed for me she said there was a warmth power that went right down over my shoulder she said I believe it is finished it's over with let me tell you something God knows what he's doing God knows what he's doing why would God do that he's confirming his faithfulness to you and I I don't believe that's the only testimonies to come either but you see there must be a voice that come is it it's not just to rally around it's pointing us to the Living God to let God have his way in our life we can have signs and wonders but if it don't build your faith you don't allow it to accumulate in your life where your faith rises within the Word of God to recognize that whether we're in the after service the pre service and when the word is coming forth your faith can rise within that word you see that's what signs and wonders come in that our faith would rise in the word because it is the word whereby the Spirit comes in and leads us to victory whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed for there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek for the same lord over all is rich unto all that call on him for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed how can they believe if they haven't heard right how can they believe if they haven't heard how shall they hear without a preacher and how shall they preach how very important except they be sent oh my I want you to just to think about this just for a moment you remember when they came out of Egypt let's just close on this God's desire remember is to bring him to a full inheritance they come out of Egypt there were different tests along the way the Bible records it in various places God having saved the people out of Egypt destroyed son in the wilderness so we see that there is a journey that is made the Lord Jesus himself remember when there were many disciples that were following him in John eight What did he say if ye continue on then you're my disciples indeed in Colossians 1 Paul goes on to talk about the reconciliation things in heaven and in earth see Paul's bringing that this reconciliation it leads to the very writing the writing correcting of all wrongs and he brings the deity of Jesus Christ down in Colossians chapter 1 and Paul brings it to a place so that the people will know that this dispensation that God of the gospel that's been given to me it's given to me for you to fulfill the Word of God how can we fulfill it by believing him who has spoken it he it must be him in us to fulfill that word I want you to think of this when Moses when there were interruptions along the way that happened that God knew about God let Moses Noah I've sent mine angel before thee mine angel is here to keep you in the way he's here to bring you unto the place that I have prepared for you only obey his voice I want you to think of this here was Cornelius and them in Cornelius house they had believed and God told him he said I want you to send for one named Peter and I want you to hear what he has to say well why couldn't God just tell him why couldn't God tell her God works through his body you see that this is the this is God's desire is that we would recognize him and believe him now we have to receive the credentials that God gives to us Peter did not have the credentials that Paul had but he would have the same God that activated the credentials in his life to be able to manifest that the people could recognize it's God think of it when a policy it was a policy oh my a polishing man Paulus was preaching the first two pools I mean he was laying it out he was preaching by the scriptures Jesus is the Christ but a key point says knowing only the baptism of John you see he couldn't preach anything more than what was made known to him now you look at this we know what happens to a policy there is some real spirit field sweet Christians by the name of Aquila and Priscilla that when they're in a meeting and they hear a Paul is preaching they didn't help both themselves they this guy even deep man good lord this guy look at him first and second pull preacher no God would have never used him and it would have showed they didn't have what they thought they had are you with me but you see within it they come not goodness it's something begin to arise within their heart to wear that maybe let's say that a Paulus was standing around and maybe he was shaking the different brothers hands and everyone said my policy my goodness that was wonderful and the chromers all said hey a pulse won't go for a coffee oh yeah wonderful and we really appreciate that tonight indeed he is the Christ really really good they got him maybe they ordered their loft tapes and cappuccinos and whatever more and they had a policy round then the Bible says they begin to expound to him more perfectly the way of the Lord I asked you was appalled us not ordained of God he was was he not ordained to preach this gospel and be born of the Spirit of God he was then live didn't God just do it ah but everything you see in the book of Acts God is not making people dependent upon themselves this is a body move it is not people who are an island - of themselves that's to miss the program of God all I need is just myself that's all I need let's call all I need is the Holy Ghost that's all I need you do need the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost in you will make you aware that you are part of the local body and part of the greater body of Jesus Christ it does not make you a body unto yourself and it doesn't make you self-sufficient it makes you reliant on him and it makes you aware that I'm a part of a body I need my brother and I need my sister I hope you realize this I do not look like you I look at things and how that God friends these very simple principles but I've watched how God has come right along and there might have been certain things that I had questions on certain things and I can't see you know all the light on and God will bring it around maybe I'm sitting in a meeting maybe it's a minister that stands right here and all of a sudden it just illuminates in the way that it needs to be illuminated you say why would God do that cuz I don't have everything in myself that I need it's in the body you see that's holding the head from the body when you make it that everything you've got everything you're not holding the head from the body you're not looking to the head but it leads to self will I'm gonna do this I'm not know if he's provided it if I have need of it you'll make it known he'll reveal it to me when I have need of it that's the confidence and the trust that I have notice what God did listen he took Tallis from where he was at to where he needed to be then Paul watch this Paul goes up to the upper coast of Ephesus Paul comes up there and he starts preaching you realize he said hey uh yeah y'all received the Holy Ghost since you believe they said Holy Ghost there's a Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is loose now you say they were believers listen to me they were believers in John's ministry they were believers in the Ministry of the Lord Jesus but they didn't recognize unnecessary transition has come it wasn't that they didn't want to but they weren't aware that the Holy Ghost had been poured out you see this comes back to a fundamental part believing itself it's not the Holy Ghost but it is a gift it is a grace of the Holy Spirit to be able to believe to where you can believe and that same God and move right in your heart cleanses your heart takes all the world out of your life all the habits and desires and he places himself on the inside and this word becomes a Living Word to you you understand that Jesus Christ becomes your everything it's not about policing a church it's about policing him peace you're all and all as a matter of fact you make decisions based on him whether you accept this whether you go here whether you do this it comes around here because you know why he is your life and what follows your life signs and wonders follow them that believe here they are now and they receive it when they heard this they were baptized you didn't have to go any further they heard it it where's the water it's time to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ they responded to that all glory be to God has they responded to that think of this now as they heard that once they were baptized Paul laid his hands upon them and they received the Holy Ghost well was it the Spirit of God traveling through the body dolled in parting life taking people who were looking then we're looking for the Messiah babe I mean if you'd have been in the Ephesus church and you said Jesus is the Christ they were stood up and shouted but oh boy when they receive the life of that sacrifice inside of em they knew there's another step there's more they responded how about you and I to that maybe where you're at tonight you haven't went maybe you've only accepted the Lord Jesus Christ your savior maybe you have it but that'd be a start and repent ever be good start that would be necessary that's what the gospel is about not to entertain us it's to call us unto himself if you've given your life to the Lord let god clean your life up let him clean you and say lord i want to be filled up and if you've been filled up as you're looking in this word and it's showing and you're seeing yourself in the reflection of this word remember you want to continue on continue on being a faithful doer of the word not just a hearer not just to hear it but be a doer Lord be it unto me Lord let this word Lord God let it let it be immediate let it so Lord God that world I want to become more real in my life Lord I want to see more of you Lord God you see it takes the Spirit of God to show up things within our life sometimes you look at things in your life and all of a sudden God begins to take the cover off of it and you see something that didn't maybe seen you know bad but it maybe didn't seem as bad maybe it's thinking maybe it's action maybe it's certain parts about your character and the Spirit of God pulls that back and you look at it and you see it the way that really sees it and you recognize Homa Lord this is a hindrance to you it's a hindrance to my life you're Jesus Prince Prince me what is it that brings you and I to that awareness he'll what's he doing it is that place of perfection that's calling you and I to perfection it's a Ministry of reconciliation God comes far away signs wonders in your life things that God does don't discount friends don't discount when the Spirit of God has moved on your heart don't discount that don't just leave it as something that's well it's just out here no no take it and recognize all of those things pull it into your bosom and recognize that he did that just for you to build your faith in him of what he's promised I say tonight faithfulness he who promised he will perform what he has said aspyn's [Music] or Jesus what I commit each of our lives put into your hands Lord over and over Lord you searches and we want to be searched we come to the house of God not to see our strong points we come that our weaknesses might be made mine or it's not comfortable to our flesh the father on the inside it rises up within us say o my lord say on my be it unto me Jesus father the greatest power that is released is that power of faith to be able to believe oh God as you draw near Lord God be upon our hearts Lord Jesus faith what arises in you it's not impressions it's not even feelings it's a reality that takes ahold of us Lord that then from our heart that is moved in surrender to confess with our mouth or Jesus you

see our failures Lord God well God were people then Lord we make mistakes or not willful sin Lord but mistakes I pray Lord Jesus God may we be accounted as faithful doers of the world continuing on in that perfect law of Liberty surrendering to the Holy Spirit believing to the saving of the soul believing Lord God as Paul could say continuing in the faith grounded and settled and not being moved away from the hope of the gospel wherever Paul and made a minister will God may each and every once see the striving and laboring as Paul would relate it was not Paul's energy it was not Paul's might but he was striving according to your striving to your desire to see the hearts and lives thoroughly furnished in Christ Jesus ran in Lord fathers sitting in here tonight and standing lives and hearts that have been completely converted Lord God born of the Spirit of God or Jesus may you continue to furnish our lives or God for what good would a house be without furniture in an order but this is
