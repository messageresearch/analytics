[39:21] happy to be here this evening and the

[39:25] fellowship around the word and Holy
[39:27] Spirit I want to remind you brother bill
[39:29] will mention this announcement twice but
[39:31] this Lord willing this coming Sunday at
[39:34] brother Richard and sister Maria's after
[39:37] service and after you've had a chance to
[39:39] get something to eat then you're more
[39:41] welcome to go on over there for some
[39:44] fellowship and activities that they
[39:46] would have for a little bit on Sunday
[39:48] afternoon also I want to say it's good
[39:51] to see sister
[39:53] so god bless your sister so good and we
[40:01] want to continue to remember the saints
[40:03] of God and all in prayer there with the
[40:07] hurricane Florence and you know they
[40:11] said just yesterday I had was reading it
[40:13] last night before I went to bed and they
[40:15] said that it had weakened during the day
[40:19] but then it picked back up in the
[40:21] evening and so where it stands right now
[40:25] you know they've said that a lot of the
[40:27] things with the coast and where they're
[40:29] looking at everything that it's gonna
[40:31] hit in land and they've said that
[40:33] supposedly I don't even remember
[40:35] Hurricane Hazel maybe I just you know it
[40:37] was only nine years old at the time when
[40:39] that would have hit but this is supposed
[40:41] to be as hard as what Hurricane Hazel
[40:44] was but you know remember God has moved
[40:48] time and time again remember last when
[40:52] we said here on Tuesday night at prayer
[40:53] meeting last year and I don't remember
[40:55] the first it was the first hurricane
[40:57] that passed through last year where that
[41:00] they did not even realize or they did
[41:03] not know the meteorologist said we don't
[41:07] know how it happened but this has
[41:08] weakened this hurricane and that was
[41:11] last year God still the same God and I I
[41:15] think that maybe we just continue to
[41:17] pray in our hearts God that he would be
[41:19] gracious and merciful
[41:21] amen to - to all of the of the people
[41:25] that are there and we certainly need His
[41:27] mercy don't we we sure do I want to say
[41:31] just such a is a real real privilege to
[41:34] have brother Stephen in Bali here with
[41:35] us from Uganda and
[41:38] really brother Stephen is just just a
[41:41] real friend and brother and I just so
[41:43] appreciate every time that we've we've
[41:46] had together
[41:47] I appreciate the ministering of the word
[41:49] and we I believe we're in for a good
[41:52] treat tonight I really believe that amen
[41:56] and so we just want to pull on the gift
[41:58] of God and how many believes that God
[42:01] already knew what you would have need of
[42:03] and what you had on your heart and he's
[42:06] already orchestrated this service to
[42:09] where you and I are looking and saying
[42:10] Lord I have this need and instead of
[42:12] saying Lord I'm recognizing you've
[42:16] already met my need he has provided for
[42:18] us and he will manifest himself once
[42:21] again tonight as Jehovah Jireh our needs
[42:25] give him an opportunity to manifest
[42:27] himself amen you're loving tonight
[42:30] Amen we want to welcome brother Stephen
[42:32] to Bali and just ask him just to obey
[42:35] the Lord and just to amen just to speak
[42:38] what the Lord has put on his heart and
[42:39] and to share some testimonies and know
[42:42] that he has so if we could let's just
[42:45] sing the song Amazing Grace
[42:47] amen
[42:52] Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that's
[43:03] it
[43:05] a wretch like me
[43:11] [Music]
[43:13] boy was
[43:19] [Music]
[43:21] now
[43:23] [Music]
[43:29] but now I see could we sing verse three
[43:35] through many dangers toils and snares
[43:37] through
[43:39] [Music]
[43:53] [Applause]
[43:56] [Music]
[44:04] [Applause]
[44:08] [Music]
[44:23] when we
[44:26] [Music]
[44:39] Hey
[44:40] [Music]
[45:08] let's give the Lord to handle price
[45:10] tonight
[45:15] praise the Lord amen god is good and I
[45:27] trust the Lord is gracious I want to
[45:31] appreciate brother Samuel for letting me
[45:37] back over 10 years yeah but the Lord is
[45:44] gracious oh the same Amen you know when
[45:48] you come to a moment like this you
[45:51] really do not know where to begin from
[45:54] because you know you're stepping into
[45:57] eternity
[45:58] you know the word in itself is a ring
[46:02] and you see with the Eternity you don't
[46:05] have where to start from and where to
[46:07] end so stepping game is just you know
[46:12] very challenging but I trust that your
[46:16] prayers we helped me through tonight so
[46:21] I want to bring greetings from the
[46:24] church back at home and my family they
[46:27] pass their greetings to you and I trust
[46:32] they've been praying for this service I
[46:35] know that there are some still that
[46:38] awake and committing us to the Lord in
[46:41] prayer
[46:42] you know of what areas of my privilege I
[46:48] came to this message to know what it is
[46:51] in the NIT 78 and so I've traveled
[46:57] almost as long as my brother Samuels
[47:01] ages it's been a long journey full of
[47:07] ups and downs but the Lord has been
[47:10] gracious that he has helped us to this
[47:13] point
[47:14] you know I remember when I was just a
[47:18] young Pentecostal boy and going from
[47:21] door to door trying to witness about the
[47:24] love of Christ and one day I just got to
[47:28] this house had some people sing and oh I
[47:33] wanted to go and be part of the blessing
[47:35] and they were about 14 15 if I can
[47:39] remember you know and so I entering I
[47:42] had my big Bible you know they said oh
[47:45] you woke up I said thank you sis can you
[47:48] share with us God's Word I said fine so
[47:51] I turned to Samuel and I started
[47:55] speaking about a lie a prophet with a
[47:57] dimming sight so I fired away and at the
[48:01] end of it all another young man told me
[48:04] that was wonderful I say thank you he
[48:06] says but under what were you baptized
[48:09] [Laughter]
[48:11] so we began from there and you and I was
[48:15] challenged to what my faith was and what
[48:18] I believed to be you know the message
[48:23] that I was carrying around and you know
[48:26] so finally we kind of came and I tried
[48:30] to defend my Trinity and I just finally
[48:34] couldn't defend my train team you know
[48:37] and I saw I said unto you the people
[48:40] that were waiting to go in 1977 they
[48:44] said no we never wanted to go in 1877
[48:49] I asked then what was it all about
[48:53] they told me to take this book and read
[48:56] it I was given the seventh Church edge
[48:59] book I read it I tell you every Junction
[49:05] was answered by Scripture amen and you
[49:09] know I had read my Bible from cover to
[49:12] cover so you know I had a foundation
[49:15] upon which to judge what I was reading
[49:20] and I tell you that it was a blessing
[49:24] amen I took the seals read the book and
[49:26] I can't stand in the transformation that
[49:29] it is shed into my life
[49:32] so I was baptized in the name of the
[49:35] Lord Jesus Christ you know and so I
[49:41] thought hopefully maybe I wouldn't and
[49:44] before the Lord comes
[49:46] but 1978 went and the Lord added come
[49:51] 1979 he went the Lord added come so I
[49:55] said well if I'm going to be a very good
[49:58] minister I need to get into family life
[50:02] you know so 1980 I married and the Lord
[50:06] has given me for beautiful girls amen
[50:10] and I have four grandchildren and just
[50:14] the end of this year I'm expecting
[50:16] another and I have five grandchildren so
[50:20] the Lord has been so gracious to me but
[50:23] you know along the journey this is what
[50:26] I want best my subject tonight you know
[50:29] I kept thinking well we do not have more
[50:33] time to go and so you know I thought
[50:37] well I've married for the sake of it but
[50:39] maybe I never have kids and the kids
[50:42] skip maybe they were never good school
[50:45] they went maybe they would never go to
[50:47] college they went so you know and
[50:51] finally here we are but you know I was
[50:55] challenged after about eight years and I
[51:00] just decided to say well you know the
[51:05] Lord be gracious to me I caught into
[51:07] some kind of a Junction and I was really
[51:11] praying and the brother who led me to
[51:15] the message told me what God had spoken
[51:18] to him about me so you know but I really
[51:23] did not believe that how to make a good
[51:26] pasta because you see I always was out
[51:31] there witnessing
[51:33] you know even when I came to the message
[51:35] I was out there trying to establish
[51:37] little groups you know and so finally
[51:42] you know God as a way of doing things
[51:47] we've got some of those turbulent
[51:50] moments that comes sometimes in Africa
[51:52] and in July 1985 was one of those
[51:57] turbulent times there was the change of
[52:00] government violently
[52:02] and then we were caught in the crossfire
[52:06] so we were threatened one night and I
[52:09] did not want my wife to keep staying
[52:12] where I was because it's looked like it
[52:15] was dangerous I sent her to stay with my
[52:18] parents and about a week after that I
[52:22] wanted to go and check on how they were
[52:24] doing so I asked a brother to come and
[52:27] keep my house the brother will accepted
[52:32] and it was a young man still staying
[52:33] with his parents he would spend the day
[52:36] there and then the night you to come
[52:38] back to keep the house and you know when
[52:41] those turbulent times come they put some
[52:44] kind of what we call a curfew so this
[52:47] date rained so much that this young man
[52:49] was bitten by the curfew how as he could
[52:53] not come to the house and the following
[52:55] day when he came back there was nothing
[52:58] in the house so I believed that now God
[53:02] has actually come to a point if I can't
[53:05] move he's moving so 1986 I started
[53:12] pastoring I mean I founded a little
[53:15] church where I am and I started settling
[53:19] down as a pastor so for 40 years the
[53:23] Lord you know has given me grace to work
[53:27] with growing churches and I love so much
[53:31] to go out and help organize you know
[53:36] meetings you know teaching meetings with
[53:41] the some of the pastors so that we can
[53:44] look at some of the things
[53:46] that we hold so dear in this message and
[53:49] been doing that for quite a number of
[53:52] years and I've seen the blessing of God
[53:54] come with it you need to have had my
[53:57] highs and milos you know as a minister
[54:01] brother Samuel knows that you wake up
[54:03] one morning when you're high and you
[54:05] just want to preach and pump out
[54:07] everything and another time you wake up
[54:10] and you you have nothing to say those
[54:13] moments have come to me I don't about
[54:15] your brother Sam and I just get on the
[54:18] phone in that morning I said brother can
[54:20] you take the service tonight you know so
[54:23] you know those kind of moments come but
[54:26] we thank God you know as a minister you
[54:30] go through your years of criticism and
[54:33] different things but yet still at the
[54:36] same time deep down on the side
[54:38] you feel something that keeps saying God
[54:41] you know and so you know I'm so billion
[54:45] to the voice on the inside they men you
[54:48] know that's where the source of my joy
[54:49] is and it's what keeps me going along
[54:53] this journey you know something happened
[54:56] in our country just last year a brother
[55:02] you know I do radio programs we have
[55:04] three programs a week on radio and one
[55:08] of those programs we run brother
[55:10] branham's voice for an hour and then we
[55:14] come party means behind that but this
[55:17] young man you know who is the voice of
[55:21] brother Branham in the country because
[55:23] he he translates him you know and he's
[55:27] the one who is translating the books he
[55:30] has got a very serious condition of
[55:33] sugar diabetes and high blood pressure
[55:36] so one time he got into this crisis and
[55:39] he was rent hospital it was in such a
[55:43] bad situation and when he got in
[55:46] hospital was in a coma then that went on
[55:49] for a few days but I went and prayed
[55:52] with him and the rest of the brothers
[55:55] will believe
[55:55] that the Lord will move in a special way
[55:58] and you know for him he said Lord
[56:00] bringing me out of here so that I may
[56:03] continue to serve you so you know this
[56:07] young man had a Pentecostal friend a
[56:09] pastor so when he came down out of
[56:12] hospital he ended up you know going out
[56:15] there to testify I mean - he was invited
[56:19] to this place and so he goes out there
[56:22] and he shares the truths that we hold so
[56:26] dear in this message and this man here
[56:29] believed and it was very astounding you
[56:34] know and he had such a big group of
[56:37] people but then he says hey I will also
[56:40] testify he goes to the next posture and
[56:43] the next posture takes him to the next
[56:46] posture so it became a very big thing
[56:49] and brother Fred from a deathbed has
[56:52] been able to baptize hundreds of
[56:55] Pentecost was in one day you know and
[57:03] the way things were happening I was
[57:07] scared of getting involved because it
[57:10] was very mind blowing you know I stayed
[57:14] on the sides and I was watching I said
[57:17] Lord what is this that is happening but
[57:20] I realized that it was just a change of
[57:23] attitude yeah you see you know the world
[57:28] is open for us and they look to us as
[57:31] witnesses they look towards us to sow
[57:35] the seed but sometimes we hold on the
[57:39] seed and we don't saw it you see with
[57:42] good grounds that are over soul and
[57:45] that's the church so we keep saturating
[57:48] among ourselves all the time which is
[57:50] not bad but you're not sometimes the
[57:53] food is of a song and you know there are
[57:56] people out there that are crying for
[57:59] what we have
[58:00] you see so this young man felt so
[58:04] overwhelmed and so you know the world
[58:10] could not believe what is happening so
[58:13] we've got our friend brother Tim God
[58:16] from Cloverdale he was coming through
[58:20] going to FeO peer and so this brother
[58:25] says brother Tim when you come here you
[58:27] are going to speak to the new believers
[58:29] and that was the first time I got into
[58:33] the saint of it he couldn't believe
[58:36] because we could fit in the church you
[58:38] know the world yet was filled and the
[58:42] cars were bringing in people we had
[58:45] about 2500 gathered that day so you know
[58:53] and you know it pushed me at the center
[58:57] of it because this brother was you know
[59:01] we kind of come together and we decided
[59:04] on a strategy because this was an
[59:06] unending thing I said brother now what
[59:09] we need to do is to feed the leaders
[59:12] that the leaders can feed the ship so
[59:15] when he had the group that was closest
[59:19] to him he organized the classes whenever
[59:22] Friday and they would be in church the
[59:24] word afraid and the leaders and so there
[59:27] were another group that was in my area
[59:30] so we also did the same every first day
[59:33] and so while I was there then I get this
[59:36] call from a man he was a Baptist
[59:41] Theological and he says I've heard you
[59:45] speak on radio for quite a number of
[59:48] years now I said yes and he said that by
[59:51] the way I'm in teaching in a certain
[59:55] place and when I knew you were coming I
[59:58] came to that place and he says I heard
[1:00:01] you teach about a year ago but you see
[1:00:04] we've gone through things here and we
[1:00:08] won't talk to you so what this man here
[1:00:11] did was
[1:00:12] he had come out of the umbrella of the
[1:00:15] Baptist Church and so under him who
[1:00:18] about 100 different groups and so he
[1:00:23] invites me and when I got out there what
[1:00:28] do we see you know he had a signpost you
[1:00:33] know independent baptist
[1:00:35] something-something so when we got in
[1:00:38] here was about over 100 ministers and so
[1:00:44] i went in there and i speak on the name
[1:00:46] Jesus and I did the best I knew how to
[1:00:50] present Jesus and I tell you it was very
[1:00:54] astounding the man says that this door
[1:00:58] is open for you so I started getting
[1:01:00] again those ministers would bring them
[1:01:03] to my church and then we were to keep
[1:01:07] transporting them and we continued
[1:01:10] teaching them and so when they you know
[1:01:13] I talked about Acts chapter 2 verse at 8
[1:01:17] the best way I knew how
[1:01:18] and so I said the poor is ready if you
[1:01:23] want to be baptized they did not answer
[1:01:26] back to me I said I wonder what this is
[1:01:30] now because this is the dog this is the
[1:01:32] beginning point and so they said excuse
[1:01:35] me I said yes John the Baptist baptized
[1:01:38] in living water I said fine if living
[1:01:43] water we shall do that hair to travel
[1:01:47] into their area and you know what they
[1:01:51] took to they took me to as living water
[1:01:54] IIT was such a route was just sealed too
[1:02:00] much clay and so much so I said thank
[1:02:04] God I did bring my wife with me because
[1:02:07] she won't let me go in there but by
[1:02:10] grass I went in there and I baptized
[1:02:13] those ministers and then when I walked
[1:02:17] out I said well I don't want those
[1:02:19] clothes to go back into my house
[1:02:23] you see but you know that's the kind of
[1:02:26] hunger that the people have if we could
[1:02:29] be open you know and got them on their
[1:02:33] level and so this message here is the
[1:02:38] character of Christ on display so the
[1:02:42] people keep watching the fruit you see
[1:02:45] if they see there is something they can
[1:02:47] feed off of that tree they always make a
[1:02:50] move so we need to really keep ourselves
[1:02:53] as a a fruitful bright tree you know
[1:02:57] producing the very correct of Christ
[1:02:59] when these guys are hungry they can come
[1:03:02] and pluck some and eat amen and out of
[1:03:06] us would flow rivers of living water if
[1:03:09] they are fast of reality they will come
[1:03:11] down and tap in and drink so we found
[1:03:14] God who out of our hearts would flow
[1:03:18] rivers of living water that the faster
[1:03:21] can be able to come and drink some amen
[1:03:25] so we could speak much but let us get
[1:03:31] down if we can stand up and get into the
[1:03:34] service tonight so we pray that you just
[1:03:40] remember us in your prayers different
[1:03:43] things that are happening out there
[1:03:45] some of them are being run out of their
[1:03:48] buildings and you know we are doing
[1:03:51] everything that we can to see that they
[1:03:54] are accommodated some of the churches
[1:03:56] now the buildings have been reclaimed
[1:03:59] back from them so this pastor here he
[1:04:03] just now has to do house to house selves
[1:04:07] through the week to keep the church
[1:04:09] going but they've taken the sacrifice
[1:04:12] amen less prayer dear father the great I
[1:04:18] am the one who came to display his life
[1:04:23] through his son Jesus Christ
[1:04:27] we thank Heavenly Father for Woolworths
[1:04:32] they'll add to us father God you've been
[1:04:35] so gracious that you extended your hand
[1:04:38] of love father while we were yet sinners
[1:04:42] you just dressed yourself you accepted
[1:04:47] to take our scene that you can give us
[1:04:49] your righteousness so each time we come
[1:04:52] into the presence of Jehovah in moments
[1:04:56] like this Heavenly Father our hearts uh
[1:04:58] challenged about your goodness love and
[1:05:02] mercy and definitely five each time we
[1:05:05] open the heart our hearts get so anxious
[1:05:08] because we know that we are going to
[1:05:11] dine from the word of life may you every
[1:05:14] father be the teacher tonight break this
[1:05:17] food Lord go to your hungry children
[1:05:20] further that would ever be say tonight
[1:05:23] may not be the words of the minister but
[1:05:27] the words of the Holy Spirit Himself
[1:05:29] father dear Lord God challenges
[1:05:32] encourages correctors father dear Lord
[1:05:35] God for we've got a journey to travel
[1:05:37] Lord God to the change of our bodies be
[1:05:41] gracious Heavenly Father and feed us
[1:05:43] what we have need of tonight in Jesus
[1:05:46] name Amen
[1:05:49] so we thank God let's start the book of
[1:05:55] Saint Luke chapter 2 and verse 40
[1:06:05] the scripture says and the child grew
[1:06:09] and worked strong in spirit filled with
[1:06:15] the wisdom and the grace of God was upon
[1:06:20] him made the Lord that blessing the
[1:06:23] reading of his word
[1:06:24] you may be seated so I am our title
[1:06:31] tonight that the word grows into harvest
[1:06:38] so Christ the word grew to you he met
[1:06:43] his purpose here on earth and while
[1:06:47] Peter looks at him he uses the words
[1:06:51] that being born again not of corruptible
[1:06:56] seed but of incorruptible by the Word of
[1:07:01] God which liveth and abideth forever
[1:07:05] meaning that the Word of God which is
[1:07:09] the seed that brings life is eternal it
[1:07:13] abideth forever meaning that the word in
[1:07:16] the predestinated ground with us all
[1:07:19] trials and weathers or conditions and it
[1:07:23] comes to the harvest because once it's
[1:07:26] left in its channel it liveth and
[1:07:28] abideth for ever so what we need to do
[1:07:32] is just suck in that word just give it a
[1:07:37] good learning spot in your life and once
[1:07:39] you do that it'll leave it forever you
[1:07:43] may go through your situations your ups
[1:07:46] and downs you may have hard times but if
[1:07:49] the seed is on the inside there it with
[1:07:53] us all both circumstances and it comes
[1:07:56] to a maturity Amen so we know that in
[1:08:00] the beginning was the word the word is
[1:08:03] the source of existence and anything
[1:08:06] with the life reproduces itself and it
[1:08:10] grows amen
[1:08:12] so I want you to know that God's folks
[1:08:15] is what we know
[1:08:18] the world because ever what org units
[1:08:21] from the thought so God's thoughts we
[1:08:24] given life by the spoken word amen so
[1:08:30] the word is not the word unless it has
[1:08:34] got the ability to bring forth an
[1:08:37] existence yes because in the beginning
[1:08:42] was the world and that word was God's
[1:08:46] fault they were God's creative concepts
[1:08:52] they were what God wanted to be and so
[1:08:57] now he brought his faults and passed
[1:09:00] them through the word and he said let
[1:09:05] there be so God's Word never fails
[1:09:09] you know once it comes through his mouth
[1:09:13] it puts her life because it's
[1:09:16] incorruptible it never dies it doesn't
[1:09:20] matter what circumstances it goes
[1:09:23] through but if it's that way it's
[1:09:26] eternal amen
[1:09:28] so being a believer means to tap into
[1:09:31] God see folks just tap it the fault
[1:09:36] just stay there in the channel and allow
[1:09:39] the first flow through you and where the
[1:09:43] thoughts flows through your channel
[1:09:46] express them as God's Word you know and
[1:09:50] once you speak them is God Himself
[1:09:53] that's whispers were to give his one
[1:09:56] life hey man is not me that's
[1:09:59] responsible for God's why not sir God is
[1:10:03] responsible for his own well is not my
[1:10:06] world
[1:10:07] so once I take God's thoughts and I help
[1:10:11] them in my mind then God Himself waters
[1:10:14] them to life amen
[1:10:17] so you know we know that he gave Moses
[1:10:21] defaults and when Moses spoke the
[1:10:24] thoughts of God they became life
[1:10:27] you see is one thing believing what God
[1:10:31] says but is another harboring those
[1:10:34] souls and speaking them out if Moses
[1:10:40] believed what God said that was fine but
[1:10:43] God required him to say what God says
[1:10:47] before it can become life brother
[1:10:51] Branham says a word is the fruit
[1:10:54] expressed and so then when God thought
[1:10:58] it and put it in Moses mind and his
[1:11:01] pocket it became a word from God
[1:11:05] thoughts to Moses thoughts and through
[1:11:09] Moses it becomes the word and Moses
[1:11:13] turned around and went back maybe not a
[1:11:16] fly in the country in an hour from them
[1:11:19] maybe one old green fly began to buzz
[1:11:23] around in half hour there was ten
[1:11:26] thousand pounds per square yard what was
[1:11:30] it the creative word of god that was
[1:11:33] spoke by the lips of the Matra man
[1:11:37] so the word is a phottix press so the
[1:11:42] prophets always waited on god's thoughts
[1:11:46] many times we don't really get into that
[1:11:50] channel because we are not so you know
[1:11:56] we are not so given to really trapping
[1:11:59] into the channel you see we need to tap
[1:12:03] into the channel but the words that we
[1:12:06] read may become living folks that's the
[1:12:10] only way they can work if they are in
[1:12:13] the book so if they are in the tapes
[1:12:15] they are goes through folks but you see
[1:12:19] they have to draw down our hearts as
[1:12:22] revelation and once they get into our
[1:12:25] hearts by revelation that's when it
[1:12:28] becomes the Word of God if we speak it
[1:12:31] out amen
[1:12:33] so and when God revealed these faults to
[1:12:36] those prophets they express the fault
[1:12:40] by saying thus says the Lord God fold
[1:12:46] sir to come as revelation and so strong
[1:12:50] that they cannot really get of of the
[1:12:53] souls both thoughts were so strong that
[1:12:57] they influenced the lives of these men
[1:13:00] they were so strong that they could not
[1:13:04] just do without those thoughts they
[1:13:08] govern their lives those thoughts govern
[1:13:10] their judgments good thoughts govern
[1:13:13] their future amen
[1:13:15] and so you know they just come and speak
[1:13:18] them out sometimes even not
[1:13:21] understanding what they were saying and
[1:13:23] you know until you the word the message
[1:13:27] of the hour becomes God's strong folks
[1:13:32] they remain written letter so what do we
[1:13:38] read or what we hear off of the tails we
[1:13:41] need to pray about those things we sell
[1:13:44] oh god I wish you could give them to me
[1:13:47] as inspired thoughts
[1:13:50] amen you see like Isaiah 7:14 was a
[1:13:55] fault and when the prophets spoke it is
[1:13:58] to put on flesh 500 years later because
[1:14:02] it was God's creative cos'è did as I
[1:14:05] understand that not at all had you ever
[1:14:09] heard of it before no but it was so
[1:14:12] strong but it controlled always thinking
[1:14:16] and he wanted it off of him and he says
[1:14:19] a virgin shall conceive then he steps
[1:14:23] back and says but how how was the man he
[1:14:31] wondered how but you know when he spoke
[1:14:35] it was God's thoughts coming through a
[1:14:38] clean channel and was God's thoughts go
[1:14:42] through a clean channel the Holy Spirit
[1:14:46] Himself gives that word life
[1:14:50] amen sir brother Branham says the world
[1:14:53] is a seed but isola sowed in the ground
[1:14:58] and every seed will bring forth of its
[1:15:02] kind if you need salvation
[1:15:04] the seed is here if you need healing
[1:15:07] here is the seed in the world the Word
[1:15:11] of God is a seed put it in your heart
[1:15:14] don't dig it up every morning to see if
[1:15:17] it is sprouted put it in there and leave
[1:15:21] it there is God's business to bring
[1:15:25] forth the harvest you just leave it
[1:15:27] there water it by faith and prays every
[1:15:31] day thanking God for it believe it go
[1:15:39] out whether you understand it or you
[1:15:41] don't
[1:15:41] give thanks to God for it water eating
[1:15:45] with prayer and you know he and they go
[1:15:48] forward justifying Oh God said Oh God
[1:15:52] say so the reason why God's word comes
[1:15:56] through your mind is because God has
[1:16:00] found you a good ground he has found you
[1:16:05] a good ground God's Word was to put on
[1:16:08] flesh through your believing channel you
[1:16:13] thank God because these thoughts come
[1:16:16] through your mind they are not data
[1:16:19] faults they are not evil thoughts but
[1:16:22] God is bringing greater light about his
[1:16:25] word and as you share it among yourself
[1:16:29] and it becomes a testament of your life
[1:16:32] you know God Himself desires to bring
[1:16:36] that word to pass so when good thoughts
[1:16:40] pass your mind believe them meditate on
[1:16:43] them speak it into the channel of
[1:16:47] creation because that's the way the word
[1:16:50] comes to be a creative concept when you
[1:16:53] speak it
[1:16:56] see there are so many things that both
[1:16:59] our lives as children of God we have all
[1:17:03] these kind of troubles in our families
[1:17:05] we've got different troubles in the
[1:17:08] church this family sometimes against the
[1:17:11] other family and so many different
[1:17:13] things begin to bother us but simply
[1:17:16] because we are feeding on the negative
[1:17:19] seeds and yet every seed has got a life
[1:17:24] so once you allow your seed in a good
[1:17:28] ground it's going to sprout you see this
[1:17:32] is the problem of the sower you know
[1:17:35] when the the evil and so but all my the
[1:17:39] Son of God has sown seeds the ground is
[1:17:42] good he comes and was to salsa so you
[1:17:48] see that ever seen but you are a good
[1:17:51] ground and God chose his word through
[1:17:54] you the enemy will work to come and so
[1:17:58] some behind you but you see you do not
[1:18:02] have to open channel for the negative
[1:18:04] seeds if the devil comes down and say ah
[1:18:08] after we were not born again say no the
[1:18:12] word says I'm a son of God amen keep
[1:18:16] sowing the right seeds
[1:18:17] tell the devil I come from God tell the
[1:18:20] devil redeemed tell the devil God's
[1:18:23] righteousness
[1:18:24] you keep sowing the right seed and
[1:18:26] you're going to have the right harvest
[1:18:30] tell that the from the righteousness of
[1:18:33] God in Christ and the devil is going to
[1:18:37] back up because he has no part in you
[1:18:42] amen
[1:18:43] speak the fruits of God because if folks
[1:18:45] are creative concepts amen don't speak
[1:18:50] your fears
[1:18:51] I know that there are certain fears that
[1:18:54] come your way
[1:18:55] anything that negative you say now
[1:18:58] that's the wrong soul trying to commit a
[1:19:00] good ground
[1:19:03] rejection those fears reject when the
[1:19:06] bill comes and says are you sure you
[1:19:08] gonna make it you say yes I'm gonna make
[1:19:12] it because I'm not a preacher of Tang am
[1:19:15] eternal amen
[1:19:17] don't speak your differences amen
[1:19:21] when that ever comes I've said the
[1:19:22] church is going to get to know you sir
[1:19:25] devil we are one body we are of one bag
[1:19:30] we have got one God we've got one
[1:19:34] purpose the name your good ground amen
[1:19:39] don't keep speaking about your
[1:19:41] weaknesses amen turn that ever I could
[1:19:45] be weak but let my strength be
[1:19:48] manifested through my weakness let the
[1:19:52] weak say I am strong amen so the word is
[1:19:57] the seed and it comes with its
[1:19:59] potentials and the white zone in a good
[1:20:02] ground it will bring forth an eternal
[1:20:05] character yes because that's what the
[1:20:08] world is all about it has to manifest
[1:20:11] Christ it will definitely bring for the
[1:20:14] attributes of Christ not your attributes
[1:20:18] now but the attributes of Christ that's
[1:20:21] what the word does you remember the
[1:20:24] transition of David when he was trying
[1:20:27] to become king determines under the
[1:20:30] tortures and the persecutions that so
[1:20:33] talked him through but after all of it
[1:20:38] you know saw was dead David says is
[1:20:43] there not any of the house of soul that
[1:20:47] I may show the kindness of God on to him
[1:20:51] he wanted to show the right side he had
[1:20:56] been tormented as a human being he could
[1:21:00] get bitter sometimes but he says well I
[1:21:04] need to start sowing good seeds these
[1:21:08] seeds are not my seeds
[1:21:10] but they are seeds of Christ that dwells
[1:21:13] in me I must begin to bear his fruits
[1:21:16] the fruit of the Spirit and then he says
[1:21:20] is there any of the house of soul that
[1:21:24] has remained that I may show him not my
[1:21:28] kindness but the kindness of God
[1:21:32] hallelujah he says that my own is not
[1:21:36] possible but I'm speaking living thieves
[1:21:41] praise God so you know the word as is
[1:21:46] for patience he says not my kindness but
[1:21:50] the kindness of God no wonder it is pure
[1:21:56] he has no ever charge is not self
[1:22:00] glorifying he does not behave itself
[1:22:03] unseemly seeketh not of his own you know
[1:22:07] it works for the benefit of the body not
[1:22:11] easily provoked thinketh no evil does
[1:22:15] not rejoice in iniquity that's what the
[1:22:19] right seed sir it looks at all these
[1:22:25] good gifts and he says fine but if there
[1:22:29] is no charity if they are not prepared
[1:22:33] by the life of Christ so it bears all
[1:22:37] things like in the case of David that's
[1:22:41] what the CDs and once you put the right
[1:22:45] seats amen even through the mouth of the
[1:22:49] Prophet like Balaam the word remains
[1:22:52] positive why do you think Balaam got
[1:22:56] that kind of problem Balaam was
[1:22:59] interfered with by Balak but before that
[1:23:03] he was an anointed prophet he had the
[1:23:07] right seats on the side of him and when
[1:23:09] the temptation come even though the seat
[1:23:13] that was in him remains positive he said
[1:23:18] there shall come a stir out of debt
[1:23:20] Jacob and
[1:23:21] - arise out of Israel and shall - might
[1:23:25] the corners of mower then he stands back
[1:23:28] and says what's this kinda magic the
[1:23:33] word even through the life of the
[1:23:35] Prophet like a bailer how about the word
[1:23:39] if it's rightly planted in our hands
[1:23:42] what do you think it shall produce see
[1:23:46] we should know that the word never fails
[1:23:49] it has an eternal nature he says that an
[1:23:55] incorruptible seed and through the seven
[1:23:59] church edges it has worked through em
[1:24:02] any memory body was in a good ground
[1:24:06] it speaks Christ was a good ground for
[1:24:11] that word in Jesus it spoke volumes
[1:24:17] because he was a predicated ground
[1:24:21] he says lo I come in the volume of the
[1:24:24] book that's written of me to express the
[1:24:27] image of the invisible God he manifested
[1:24:32] that name are you together with me yeah
[1:24:36] you know John 17 6 6 I believe it is he
[1:24:41] says I have manifested ining they
[1:24:47] believe that John 17 6 of manifest
[1:24:51] remaining but you know you start
[1:24:54] wondering because sometimes we don't
[1:24:56] really look back and understand what the
[1:25:00] name stands for the name is the
[1:25:03] definition of character and sometimes
[1:25:08] this definition if it comes from God is
[1:25:11] a prophecy even in the midst of the
[1:25:15] weakness he says there at Vita and yet
[1:25:21] Peter was foretelling but it was a
[1:25:23] professor thou shalt not be called Abram
[1:25:26] but Abraham he had no son but you know
[1:25:30] the name was the definition of the
[1:25:32] caller
[1:25:34] and so in Jesus came down and he says
[1:25:38] that manifested thy name I have come
[1:25:41] down to manifest the attributes of the
[1:25:43] great Jehovah all that God was I'm here
[1:25:48] to manifest hallelujah
[1:25:50] so the word is the fruits of God Express
[1:25:54] when it finds good ground in the heart
[1:25:57] of the believer you manifest what God is
[1:26:05] that way the believer becomes the volume
[1:26:09] of the book just like Jesus was the
[1:26:12] volume of the book amen you become that
[1:26:16] written epistle to express those
[1:26:19] attributes that way you need not anybody
[1:26:23] commend who the lat
[1:26:26] you do not want any and you don't need a
[1:26:30] letter of commendation please receive
[1:26:33] brother so-and-so because he's an open
[1:26:37] book what you see is what you buy amen
[1:26:43] when the Holy Spirit comes into your
[1:26:46] life he opens you up because you are a
[1:26:49] written epistle rather woman so the word
[1:26:55] becomes the recommendation hallelujah
[1:26:59] it's the seed growing on the side of us
[1:27:02] and bringing forth of his own fruits it
[1:27:07] comes to harvest amen in numbers 203
[1:27:12] Moses did not declare himself the
[1:27:14] meekest man on earth
[1:27:16] but the word declared in the meekest man
[1:27:20] you know because that's the fruit that
[1:27:22] was tangible the seed comes to harvest
[1:27:27] j11 the career job man
[1:27:30] that was perfect and upright and one
[1:27:33] that feared God and eschewed evil is not
[1:27:36] one who says look at what I am but the
[1:27:42] seed on the inside brings for the
[1:27:44] harvest
[1:27:45] amen Isaiah fretta 1 verse 8 decay at
[1:27:50] Abraham the friend of God is not Abram
[1:27:55] who said you know who I am
[1:27:56] I'm Abram the friend of God no sir Acts
[1:28:01] chapter 13 verse 22 he raised up unto
[1:28:04] them bility to be their king to whom
[1:28:06] also he gave their testimony and say I
[1:28:09] have found David the son of Jesse a man
[1:28:12] after my own hat hallelujah why there is
[1:28:19] something on the inside that friends
[1:28:22] good ground and takes control the king
[1:28:27] sits on the throne and begins to bring
[1:28:32] forth his life into harvest and the
[1:28:36] Swint happens bosses no longer i but
[1:28:42] quest that leaves him amen
[1:28:45] John fight father here he says I kind of
[1:28:49] my own self do nothing as they hear I
[1:28:53] judge and my judgment and my judgment is
[1:28:58] just because I speak not my own will but
[1:29:02] the will of the Father which are said to
[1:29:06] me I bear witness i if I bear witness of
[1:29:10] myself my witness is not true there is
[1:29:15] another that beareth witness of me and I
[1:29:19] know that the witness which he witnesses
[1:29:22] of me is true who is the Christ that
[1:29:28] lived in the Jesus body he says he
[1:29:33] witnesses and this witness is true are
[1:29:40] you together with me so brother Branham
[1:29:43] says Christ did not come down to make
[1:29:46] himself known he did not come to reveal
[1:29:51] the Sun he kept revealed and
[1:29:55] no the father see what I'm saying so he
[1:30:01] did not come to testify of himself but
[1:30:04] the father that brought on the inside
[1:30:06] that seed of life but existed in Genesis
[1:30:11] one had found a ground to make himself
[1:30:14] made manifest again he came to reveal
[1:30:19] the father as we come to reveal Christ
[1:30:22] and every one of us has a unique part to
[1:30:26] reveal but is the producer where God
[1:30:30] works
[1:30:30] he can call Peter John James Paul
[1:30:34] different brothers as pastors but the
[1:30:36] way he worked through us is totally
[1:30:39] different everybody has got a part the
[1:30:43] seed on the inside there comes up to
[1:30:46] manifest himself amen and you know you
[1:30:51] have your predestinated position in
[1:30:54] Christ you possess it you step in there
[1:30:57] and then you say now father I'm ready to
[1:31:01] bring manifestation let me try to get
[1:31:06] into this adult faith here let me say
[1:31:09] this which we all know but when Malachi
[1:31:12] for him he thought if we had the or
[1:31:15] robust field without the big Ram field
[1:31:18] but then we also have the Malachi 4
[1:31:20] field listen friends there's something
[1:31:23] that I want to bring out here now all
[1:31:27] this field also and you see as long as
[1:31:32] life continues sowing and reaping shall
[1:31:36] not cease that scripture so you saw
[1:31:40] simply because you are looking for a
[1:31:42] harvest
[1:31:44] if there is no harvest expected there is
[1:31:48] no reason why we saw are you together
[1:31:52] with me so Malachi 4 came he sought the
[1:31:58] fields with all this under mania or
[1:32:02] robbers Billy Graham they never saw the
[1:32:05] world so they don't feed in the parable
[1:32:08] of muscle fatigue because the parable
[1:32:11] says the solar showed the world are you
[1:32:16] together with me so technically we are
[1:32:20] in the harvest amen
[1:32:23] so the people simply you see the people
[1:32:26] are separated for the message and you
[1:32:29] start seeing that they are bearing the
[1:32:31] fruit of the Spirit
[1:32:33] they exhibiting the life of Christ the
[1:32:37] fullness of the Godhead bodily again
[1:32:40] showing that we in the harvest
[1:32:43] the child has grown again through Luther
[1:32:47] wisly Pentecost and now the bringing
[1:32:51] back of the world to bring forth the
[1:32:54] fruit again the scripture says and the
[1:32:58] child grew let's go just back here to
[1:33:02] Luke chapter 2 verse 40 he says here and
[1:33:06] the child grew and waxed strong in
[1:33:10] spirit filled with wisdom and grace of
[1:33:15] God was upon him and verse 52 he says
[1:33:19] and Jesus increased in wisdom and
[1:33:23] stature and in favor with God and man
[1:33:28] so the life you know hard to grow and
[1:33:34] brother branham show thyself that
[1:33:37] happens in the series not here with the
[1:33:40] shack so once the Sidious saw it the
[1:33:44] womb of a virgin it grew and then the
[1:33:48] child was born but when the child was
[1:33:52] born that was not our Redemption the
[1:33:56] Bible says and the child grew and then
[1:34:01] he brought forth the gospel Redemption
[1:34:05] and then he went to Calvary and took our
[1:34:09] sinful nature upon himself to give us
[1:34:12] his own righteousness by bringing down
[1:34:14] the bottom of the holocaust in the upper
[1:34:17] room and when that happened
[1:34:21] but child again was being bought and
[1:34:23] this child had to grow he had to grow
[1:34:27] through Ephesus he had to go through
[1:34:29] Samana he had to go through a bigamist
[1:34:32] he had to go through all those ages to
[1:34:35] come to the age of the harvest are you
[1:34:40] together with me so the child has grown
[1:34:42] again through Luther
[1:34:45] Wesley Pentacles and now back into the
[1:34:48] fruit time here we are we are in the
[1:34:53] time of the harvest we are life of his
[1:34:55] life spirit of his spirit and when
[1:34:58] Christ is our life shall appear we shall
[1:35:01] appear with him that's who we are we a
[1:35:05] quest one more time but in a physical
[1:35:09] body we shall be like him
[1:35:12] that's the harvest amen so as is you
[1:35:16] know that's first John chapter 4 verse
[1:35:19] 17 I believe which says as he is I mean
[1:35:24] so a we in this one he says as he is so
[1:35:29] are we in this one meaning but we are
[1:35:34] the manifestation of his invisibility
[1:35:39] like he was the manifestation of the
[1:35:42] invisibility of Jehovah Ponyo and then
[1:35:45] brother Branham says what God was he
[1:35:48] poured into Christ and what Christ was
[1:35:50] he poured into the bright body and then
[1:35:55] John says as he is in the present tense
[1:35:58] so are we in this world and he says that
[1:36:01] is our bonus in the day of judgment
[1:36:06] hallelujah he has brought us up into
[1:36:10] that to restore the image and character
[1:36:14] that gave the authority of Dominion we
[1:36:18] are here he can never judge his own body
[1:36:21] that's why he says we have passed from
[1:36:24] judgment to life
[1:36:26] so now listen our friends but teaching
[1:36:30] grains kept sowing the seed of the world
[1:36:33] through the Ministry of Malachi flow so
[1:36:39] out there
[1:36:40] it was another photo familiar for the
[1:36:44] Baptist another DS but the word was
[1:36:48] served by Malachi for in good health now
[1:36:53] listen if the sowing of the way is where
[1:36:58] we have the three kinds of ground the
[1:37:03] wayside peroxide and even the good
[1:37:08] ground all these are in the message
[1:37:13] churches because that's where the word
[1:37:16] was so so friends if we are going to
[1:37:20] bear the fruit we had better take care
[1:37:24] of our ground
[1:37:26] he says break the fallow ground and
[1:37:30] don't show in the fold
[1:37:36] take care of your ground because the
[1:37:40] seed sown in a good ground is the only
[1:37:44] web that can come to harvest amen so now
[1:37:50] we know that the teaching grains came
[1:37:53] and many people sometimes we get a
[1:37:57] little bit of confusion here they say
[1:38:00] all you know the former rain was the
[1:38:03] teaching but the Holy Spirit is the
[1:38:06] latter rain but no both ways it is the
[1:38:11] Holy Spirit is the Holy Spirit as the
[1:38:16] planter because you cannot teach a dry
[1:38:23] litter and it brings life
[1:38:26] the Holy Spirit has to be behind every
[1:38:30] statement to energize it so he is the
[1:38:34] solar and the Energizer the one who
[1:38:38] bring
[1:38:38] first promise so what are we talking
[1:38:41] about that in the sowing of the seed
[1:38:45] entirely the Holocaust is responsible
[1:38:49] okay
[1:38:51] your tournament attitude was to here he
[1:38:54] says my doctrine shall drop as the rain
[1:38:58] my speech shall distil as the dew as the
[1:39:03] small rain upon the tender hub and as
[1:39:06] the showers upon the grass so there's
[1:39:09] nothing much add here because he sold in
[1:39:14] the former rain he gave us all that we
[1:39:19] needed for this journey we have it on
[1:39:22] the tapes everything that we have need
[1:39:26] of you see so you know he gave you to us
[1:39:29] so we are being remembered game after
[1:39:34] revelation 10 7 and the mystery of
[1:39:38] Christ has been revealed down here he's
[1:39:41] telling us pipbuck no seeds and sewed
[1:39:45] them back again thou shalt prophesy
[1:39:49] again I write this clear one more time
[1:39:53] I'll still run back the same shoes that
[1:39:58] Malachi for so so here we stand in a
[1:40:03] special time whereby we are not only
[1:40:07] having the seeds into the harvest but
[1:40:11] what we have this we sow back amen see
[1:40:18] that's what is happening here the same
[1:40:21] one who came as the former rain is the
[1:40:23] same one that comes forth in the
[1:40:26] manifestations the same spirit because
[1:40:29] listen friends when the former rain went
[1:40:33] down to server
[1:40:36] he says I'll come back again as the
[1:40:40] lottery he I brought the promise but he
[1:40:45] I'll come and energized the promise he
[1:40:49] says our return and
[1:40:51] see according to the time of life it
[1:40:54] will not be another one but I will
[1:40:58] return again unto thee in the time of
[1:41:01] life it's the same one
[1:41:03] listen friends here we you know you use
[1:41:07] motoring all the time you know
[1:41:09] motorbikes in you know those
[1:41:12] four-wheelers and because but the man
[1:41:15] who puts together the mechanics is the
[1:41:17] one who also arranges for the dynamics
[1:41:20] of the track it's the same one that's
[1:41:24] the same thing we have you see that was
[1:41:28] you give yourself over to the former
[1:41:31] rain and the seed is planted
[1:41:33] he says it's incorruptible the rain will
[1:41:36] come upon it
[1:41:39] you see what I'm talking about
[1:41:41] it's the same passion let me give you
[1:41:44] Joey chapter two here there is something
[1:41:46] here I want to bring hopefully it can
[1:41:48] bless us Joey to verse 23 he says be
[1:41:53] glad be ye children of Zion and rejoice
[1:41:57] in the Lord your God for he has given
[1:42:00] you the former a moderately the same one
[1:42:05] he will cause to come down for you the
[1:42:09] rain the former rain and the lottery in
[1:42:12] the first month are you together with me
[1:42:15] first of all he has to serve the former
[1:42:20] II and then after does that he brings us
[1:42:25] in Revelation 10 8 and he says thou must
[1:42:29] prophesy again
[1:42:30] so in this mafia of the harvest there is
[1:42:35] a unique time here where he says that
[1:42:38] you have to serve back again and again
[1:42:41] the manifestation should keep coming
[1:42:44] behind the word that you saw so there is
[1:42:48] a one-man promise which is Malachi 4
[1:42:52] cramming alone in the former rain but
[1:42:55] after he has done that and the bride has
[1:42:58] separated itself to the message then
[1:43:01] which we get has to be planted back and
[1:43:06] he says at that time I'll be singing
[1:43:09] both rains together that's the promise
[1:43:14] that we are standing in and in Isaiah
[1:43:17] chapter 6 were three he makes it so
[1:43:19] clear he says then shall we know if we
[1:43:24] fall on to know the Lord his going forth
[1:43:27] is prepared as the morning and he shall
[1:43:31] come at us as the rain as the latter and
[1:43:35] for marine unto death he says after
[1:43:39] Malachi who has done his job
[1:43:41] the promise of this hour is not latter
[1:43:45] in the promise of this hour is firmer
[1:43:49] and Lipari together and that's why he
[1:43:53] says on the sensitive he shall come to
[1:43:57] us as the former and latter in together
[1:44:01] that's why we have got pastels butter
[1:44:04] peeking the former rain seeds and
[1:44:07] planting them back and the Holy Spirit
[1:44:10] is following those seeds in the hearts
[1:44:13] of the children of God
[1:44:15] thus our good works every seed must come
[1:44:19] to a harvest the person of Christ comes
[1:44:22] there to us of the former and latter
[1:44:24] rain together short quick work amen
[1:44:29] so every minister is the anointed as a
[1:44:32] planter to pass on the understanding by
[1:44:36] a gift
[1:44:37] amen and the same ole spirit resides in
[1:44:41] the heart of every believer too quickly
[1:44:43] that sea which lands in a good ground so
[1:44:49] that every seed must have an opportunity
[1:44:52] of coming to the harvest
[1:44:54] if there is no harvest then there is no
[1:44:57] need for us to do the sewing you saw
[1:45:01] because there must be a harvest listen
[1:45:04] friends when he said the words in the
[1:45:07] bride as it was in Mary he met that the
[1:45:11] word will
[1:45:12] and compromise restoration the word
[1:45:17] could not remain a baby throughout the
[1:45:20] word had to grow but many times when we
[1:45:24] read the court the court never changes
[1:45:29] it remains in the sub is static
[1:45:32] that's the written word even right after
[1:45:35] now we can go to as a 7:14 is in the
[1:45:39] scripture a virgin shall conceive but
[1:45:42] when we minister sometimes we said the
[1:45:45] word is in the bride as it was in the
[1:45:47] Mary Mary gave birth when are you giving
[1:45:50] back to the sketch of the perfect man
[1:45:54] are you together with me you are because
[1:45:57] there must be a bath and until you have
[1:46:00] the bath that you can also be able to
[1:46:03] plant you can't give what you don't have
[1:46:07] amen so the crop is now formed by the
[1:46:10] latter rain in this season where we are
[1:46:13] and we identify as the very bright and
[1:46:16] life of Christ Jeremiah the Proms
[1:46:20] chapter 5 verse 24
[1:46:23] Naida said they in their heart let us
[1:46:26] now fear the Lord our God that giveth
[1:46:29] rain both the former and latter knee
[1:46:36] season he reserved unto us the appointed
[1:46:41] weeks of the harvest I love that this is
[1:46:47] he gives the rain and he reserves a
[1:46:51] season for the harvest so when the seed
[1:46:56] goes into the ground God reserves the
[1:46:59] firm a special thing and in this space
[1:47:03] of time
[1:47:04] Boaz comes down in his field because
[1:47:10] they harvest is good and that's the time
[1:47:13] again when you see Ruth coming up here
[1:47:18] interior sowing and reaping
[1:47:22] and this Ruth here what happens she
[1:47:25] conceives to bring forth the same you
[1:47:29] see we are in this season here friends
[1:47:31] the return of the very life that went
[1:47:35] into the ground let me give you this
[1:47:38] quote I love it
[1:47:39] Christ was the first one trace from the
[1:47:43] prophets and so forth although typed in
[1:47:45] many places
[1:47:46] he was the first fruits of those that
[1:47:49] slept in the bright coming of Christ
[1:47:52] coming out of the church they'll have to
[1:47:54] be achieved with the game in the last
[1:47:57] days so here we are there must be
[1:48:01] another harvest we are he experiencing
[1:48:05] again the life of the original seed its
[1:48:07] adoption time you see it's the time to
[1:48:12] manifest at the life of Christ amen
[1:48:15] so you see brother Stephen why do we
[1:48:21] have discrepant feeds now but look at
[1:48:29] people for this one then people for that
[1:48:32] you know why because we're in the
[1:48:35] harvest that's the reason why because
[1:48:40] we're in the harvest now so the
[1:48:42] principle matter team is that when the
[1:48:45] authentic so when sowing the seeds the
[1:48:47] non-authentic came behind sowing the
[1:48:51] tares are you together with me now the
[1:48:56] players with sown in the right brain and
[1:48:59] the follower also comes and comes in
[1:49:05] some kind of a smooth way he sews
[1:49:09] exactly the seed he does not show
[1:49:15] doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church he
[1:49:20] says there the Pharisee but the war
[1:49:24] problem lays on the attitude behind it
[1:49:29] the motive behind it
[1:49:32] he says together
[1:49:34] this seed with something else a little
[1:49:38] bit of philosophy here and a little bit
[1:49:42] of psychology there some form of
[1:49:45] competition personal goals and it's not
[1:49:48] basically Pentecostal doctrine because
[1:49:51] you would catch that the motive and
[1:49:54] objective was what makes the seed a seed
[1:49:58] of descriptors and that's what makes
[1:50:04] Matthew 24:24
[1:50:06] because you cannot tell the man
[1:50:10] preachers God yet bossom in Jesus name
[1:50:12] serpent seed as all these kind of things
[1:50:14] but the attitude with which the seed
[1:50:17] comes is what creates manipulate the 424
[1:50:23] and every seed but goes in the ground
[1:50:26] comes through the habit so we're now the
[1:50:31] firm owner looked around he could not
[1:50:34] differentiate between the wheat and the
[1:50:37] tares they were standing on the same
[1:50:40] doctrine they were both saying God you
[1:50:42] know sent us a prophet they were
[1:50:44] standing on the same water baptism they
[1:50:47] were saying exactly the same but what
[1:50:50] spoils the seed is the attitude with
[1:50:53] which we received the word and sent away
[1:50:58] we need to keep our channel clean he
[1:51:03] says break up the fallow ground that you
[1:51:06] may not show in the film's best way
[1:51:09] maastradamus a metaphor is so slick
[1:51:14] because it ties people to the duck
[1:51:18] letter and the word is the word
[1:51:24] if only it can bring forth its purpose
[1:51:28] Christ was that word because we grew to
[1:51:35] come to the harvest and the father's is
[1:51:39] the purpose for which the seed comes
[1:51:42] into the ground
[1:51:47] let there be light there's no light what
[1:51:52] happens does not God's were God's work
[1:51:56] has positive life behind it the
[1:52:01] principles let them go together and in
[1:52:04] the time of the harvest that's why you
[1:52:06] see all these things happen somebody
[1:52:09] kicked back the message and somebody did
[1:52:12] they didn't know what they were looking
[1:52:14] for you know they come to the time of
[1:52:19] challenge but the attitude with which
[1:52:21] they were seen god help us to clean the
[1:52:26] channel you see when Paul sowed the seed
[1:52:31] his fear was men and so that kind of
[1:52:39] seed with some kind of attachment
[1:52:42] pulling people to themselves the object
[1:52:46] was not Christ and process watch out
[1:52:50] because this seed must be kept in its
[1:52:54] original channel you see so we shall be
[1:52:59] given a period of harvest thus the law
[1:53:04] of sowing and reaping the reserve is the
[1:53:09] season of harvest see and now that's why
[1:53:13] I say we're now adoption time the
[1:53:15] manifestation of the sons of God they
[1:53:18] see coming to its harvest in DC let's go
[1:53:22] to Romans chapter 8 here and see if I
[1:53:24] can finish somewhere you know sometimes
[1:53:28] you really do not know who you are and
[1:53:31] that was the problem of joy he he was
[1:53:36] redeemed he was a son of God but he was
[1:53:41] not sure because it had not struck his
[1:53:44] heart as a revelation and so now at the
[1:53:49] closing of the edges then a voice calls
[1:53:54] him come up hither and when he moved
[1:53:57] over his trusting Thrones were set
[1:54:01] and then he saw my the judgment has come
[1:54:05] but Who am I
[1:54:08] journey began to cry that's the
[1:54:11] revelation that we needed to have if we
[1:54:15] can know that we are redeemed and our
[1:54:18] names
[1:54:19] I am the Lamb's Book of Life we shall
[1:54:21] settle down but if we do not know who we
[1:54:26] are we cannot come to the harvest you
[1:54:32] see the purpose of this message is to
[1:54:34] bring people to a settlement that they
[1:54:38] settled realize that no their what God
[1:54:41] called them for the purpose that's where
[1:54:44] we grow up - but you see people are not
[1:54:48] settled
[1:54:49] they are running back and forth this way
[1:54:51] and that you and then fears and then oh
[1:54:53] pastor I don't know whether I've got it
[1:54:55] or you know we need to come to a point
[1:54:57] of settlement let me tell you the reason
[1:55:01] why you're here is because you are a
[1:55:04] child of God God near you from before
[1:55:07] the foundation of the world
[1:55:09] and let me tell you you've got a body
[1:55:11] waiting for you if you don't make it
[1:55:17] what will God do with that body because
[1:55:19] it's the time it is eternal the shadows
[1:55:24] are around you find that's what God is
[1:55:27] dealing with so he allows you to go into
[1:55:30] chastisement so that we may clean this
[1:55:33] spirit this spirit which controls you
[1:55:37] and takes you into this and packs into
[1:55:39] that that's what God is dealing with are
[1:55:44] you together with me yes let me tell you
[1:55:49] even in nature knows that you are a
[1:55:52] child of God and what nature is crying
[1:55:56] for is father let this your children
[1:55:59] come to the realization of who they are
[1:56:02] let them come to the harvest
[1:56:06] let's go to Romans chapter 8 verse 19
[1:56:09] for
[1:56:10] be honest expectation of the creature
[1:56:12] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[1:56:14] sons of God now the manifestation is
[1:56:18] just a clearing away of the mist of the
[1:56:22] frog that kind of you know causes you to
[1:56:28] think like you're not part of it
[1:56:30] you know this bracketing in the cuttin
[1:56:33] of time you know as long as you're in
[1:56:36] the cuttin of time you'll have fears but
[1:56:41] you see the only way we can overcome
[1:56:43] these fears is by remembering what God
[1:56:46] said about you brother Branham at the
[1:56:50] similar fears he says what shall I be
[1:56:53] like will I make it I wonder I wish I
[1:56:56] got can you let me says would you want
[1:56:59] me to go beyond the car he says exactly
[1:57:02] brother Branham had similar fears like
[1:57:05] you do and God says let me take you
[1:57:08] behind bigger the cuttin of time this
[1:57:12] button here is the liar
[1:57:14] it's ducking sentences but the creation
[1:57:19] knows who you are and the creatures are
[1:57:22] pray that you may compare realization of
[1:57:26] who you are and you know that God is
[1:57:29] helping you to come to a time of harvest
[1:57:33] which is abduction time the
[1:57:36] manifestation of the sons of God is the
[1:57:40] seed on the side of you that must come
[1:57:43] to that position it's not this thing
[1:57:47] here is the seed on the side of you and
[1:57:52] once the seed on the side of you comes
[1:57:55] this type of maturity to realize Who I
[1:57:59] tell you that will be the king on the
[1:58:01] throne you begin to combine your kingdom
[1:58:06] you take control of your flesh
[1:58:09] hallelujah because God will have brought
[1:58:13] back the image and likeness he says let
[1:58:16] us make man in our image and in our
[1:58:19] likeness to have dominion
[1:58:21] so when you come to the harvest you are
[1:58:25] actually bringing back the life of the
[1:58:27] seed which is on the side of you and
[1:58:31] that was the image and likeness which
[1:58:34] God wants you to take and stand at the
[1:58:37] top of your fears hallelujah
[1:58:41] let this thing not talk to you when this
[1:58:44] thing twice talked to you you took back
[1:58:47] God's what rate I'm a son of God a man
[1:58:51] yet I'm chosen and in the Lamb's Book of
[1:58:54] Life
[1:58:54] I'm waiting for my body change amen
[1:58:59] see he says in Romans 8:19 for the
[1:59:03] earnest expectation of the creature
[1:59:05] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[1:59:07] sons of God amen for the creature was
[1:59:12] made subject vanity not willingly but by
[1:59:15] reason of him who has subjected the same
[1:59:18] in hope because the creatures have also
[1:59:21] shall be delivered from the bondage of
[1:59:24] corruption into the glorious liberty of
[1:59:27] the children of God so we know that the
[1:59:31] were creation groaneth and travaileth in
[1:59:35] pain together until now and not only
[1:59:39] they but ourselves also which of the
[1:59:42] firstfruits of the Spirit even we
[1:59:44] ourselves groan with ourselves waiting
[1:59:48] for the adoption to wit the redemption
[1:59:50] of this body for we are saved by hope
[1:59:54] but hope that is seen is not hope for
[1:59:57] what a man sees why does he yet hope for
[2:00:01] it hallelujah amen Romans for he says
[2:00:08] that against hope he believed in hope
[2:00:10] yes if the devil comes and says you have
[2:00:14] beaten down you shall never bring forth
[2:00:17] the harvest the stretch of the perfect
[2:00:19] man you just tell her well that's devil
[2:00:23] that listen Satan Abram in hope against
[2:00:28] hope he believed in hope
[2:00:32] yes God never fails on his word amen
[2:00:39] so nature groans and his groans are the
[2:00:42] inner longings for total Redemption and
[2:00:46] the creatures no but our fate lays in
[2:00:51] the rest of man nature looks forward in
[2:00:54] faith believing that the man who fell
[2:00:57] will count with harvest because the seed
[2:01:01] that was sown in his body is eternal
[2:01:04] life nature has faith but you will make
[2:01:07] it
[2:01:10] listen listen man and when Adam sinned
[2:01:14] by heeding his wife's groaning instead
[2:01:17] of holding to God's Word he lost all his
[2:01:20] inheritance when he lost his fellowship
[2:01:23] and righted life remember the day eat
[2:01:25] thereof that Dave died and when he lost
[2:01:29] his life he also lost his inheritance in
[2:01:33] life he lost two things
[2:01:34] he lost life and also lost his
[2:01:38] inheritance in life which was the earth
[2:01:40] he lost both of those and the redemption
[2:01:44] is bringing those together back you see
[2:01:48] and now they asked that never seen
[2:01:51] nature is crying it understands that
[2:01:55] there is a Redemption coming for it and
[2:01:57] then he says let man come to his
[2:02:01] adoption the earth knows you see so when
[2:02:07] Adam seen he lost his obstructed heed to
[2:02:11] you know to his property and you know
[2:02:14] Satan took it over you know to control
[2:02:18] him but God says I know what I'm going
[2:02:21] to do I'll take the wheat seed and drop
[2:02:26] it in the cocklebur the life on the
[2:02:31] inside is different from this coconut
[2:02:35] shell
[2:02:36] and that life is growing it's growing
[2:02:40] and crowding out the control of this
[2:02:44] flesh and the child grew and then he
[2:02:51] says in wisdom in stretcher in grease
[2:02:54] that was crushing the Jesus body and
[2:02:59] it's planted now again in another body
[2:03:02] the body of the church and then he says
[2:03:05] this child will grow and he says will
[2:03:09] grind wisdom will grain structure will
[2:03:12] grow in grace to come to the purpose in
[2:03:16] mastcam to his harvest the fullness of
[2:03:19] redemption will be a path of both man
[2:03:24] and nature
[2:03:26] God bringing back that state again and
[2:03:29] then we are saved by grace I mean by by
[2:03:32] hope that's what he says it will be new
[2:03:35] bodies and a new earth
[2:03:37] I'll together with me so we are coming
[2:03:40] to a time where we really need to look
[2:03:43] beyond these things here which try to
[2:03:46] attack us let me tell you the reason why
[2:03:50] you have trials is simply because you
[2:03:53] dropped into this body of flesh it has
[2:03:57] got certain elements that control it
[2:04:00] this body of flesh even when the Krishna
[2:04:03] took the body he became hungry I had
[2:04:09] together with me when he came down into
[2:04:11] the body of flesh brother the
[2:04:15] temptations acted towards him and wanted
[2:04:18] to take out his control and then Paul
[2:04:21] says he lanta previous by the things he
[2:04:24] suffered to keep him in the channel so
[2:04:28] all these things that you go through is
[2:04:31] God keeping in channel and peel the seed
[2:04:36] comes to the harvest that's what we are
[2:04:40] looking for that's what God wants to do
[2:04:44] this is the season where we are we end
[2:04:46] the season of D amen
[2:04:48] he kept revealing portions of himself
[2:04:51] through the seven chat edges and he kept
[2:04:54] restoring the elements that make the
[2:04:56] kingdom and in the age of the odyssia he
[2:04:59] at the age of game and the end of war
[2:05:01] things and now he says if you become
[2:05:06] I'll cause you to sit in my throne as I
[2:05:09] overcame and I sat in my father throne I
[2:05:12] manifested who my father was
[2:05:14] that was the authority I took this wrong
[2:05:17] and he says even you overcome you are
[2:05:21] going to be the store of God's divine
[2:05:24] authority you are going to be the voice
[2:05:27] of Jehovah Indian time it's the harvest
[2:05:32] it will be a life it will be a
[2:05:35] manifestation it will not be things that
[2:05:38] we say we say but it will be a life that
[2:05:42] we experience and remember as my father
[2:05:48] sent me so send are you my father sent
[2:05:52] me as a growing word so I send you also
[2:05:57] as a growing word the word has life and
[2:06:02] once the word is spoken it may take
[2:06:06] years and years and years but finally
[2:06:09] two picks up life and brings forth a
[2:06:12] manifestation amen
[2:06:14] so don't rely on yourself rely on God's
[2:06:18] well Holly don't rely on yourself rely
[2:06:24] on the seed of God's Word and when the
[2:06:28] time of planting it back a may plant
[2:06:32] back every seed because there has to be
[2:06:35] a continuous planting and harvest
[2:06:37] planting and harvest that's what it is
[2:06:40] that's what the word is for plant back
[2:06:43] John 3:16 God loved me gave his life for
[2:06:47] me plant it back plant every seed black
[2:06:51] into your soul God to come and whatever
[2:06:54] a part of his body
[2:06:56] and then you are going to bring forth
[2:06:58] fruit all the time fruit all the time
[2:07:00] fruit all the time and the devil said
[2:07:02] man this is a great harvest time
[2:07:05] this man has countries harvest god bless
[2:07:08] you Lester
[2:07:17] the harvest is here Boaz wouldn't be in
[2:07:22] his field but they are the people that
[2:07:27] have realized that they are the growing
[2:07:31] of God's Word that will come down to
[2:07:35] harvest every seed and God will testify
[2:07:39] about it he will say you are written
[2:07:42] epistles and you say amen I'm God's were
[2:07:46] made manifest you see the devil will
[2:07:50] come you know the devil not ceased being
[2:07:52] the devil listen friend he will not

[2:11:53] let's take a little by little and go
[2:11:55] back over that message you know it's uh
[2:12:00] the word itself it has life within it
[2:12:05] and it's God's thoughts being delivered
[2:12:08] and we we come to the realization and I
[2:12:13] believe God brings us to this more and
[2:12:15] more that words we are receiving the
[2:12:20] word we are not receiving something that
[2:12:22] is not already in us we are receiving
[2:12:25] the life that activates what he has
[2:12:28] already placed within us so you are
[2:12:33] already the word it's not God repeating
[2:12:37] himself it's God activating what is
[2:12:40] already there it's like I know this
[2:12:45] might be a lot for some of the older
[2:12:47] people but you have cell phones and
[2:12:49] inside of that cell phone there you get
[2:12:54] it some of the cell phones say by this
[2:12:57] cell phone it is for Verizon this one is
[2:13:00] for spring then you buy a certain cell
[2:13:03] phone you have to pay a little bit more
[2:13:04] money that says it's open whatever
[2:13:07] network that cell phone has a SIM card
[2:13:12] with in it which means it is built to be
[2:13:16] able to communicate and receive the
[2:13:19] signals that are already out there
[2:13:21] translate them so we receive calls and
[2:13:25] texts and so we're able to tap in to
[2:13:28] what is already going through here God
[2:13:31] has provided to where that that can be
[2:13:34] submitted and there is a channel we can
[2:13:36] get into to where that's that that seed
[2:13:40] that SIM card becomes activated and when
[2:13:43] it becomes activated then you begin to
[2:13:46] have communication you begin to have you
[2:13:49] begin to see images are being sent
[2:13:53] the images are sent to your videos are
[2:13:57] sent to you messages are sent to you
[2:13:59] tweets are sent to you is that right
[2:14:02] yeah the Lord speaks to you because you
[2:14:04] have been baptized into this network
[2:14:08] hallelujah and you have the same
[2:14:11] cellular service that Philip had that
[2:14:14] Peter had that Andrew had the same
[2:14:19] service it is laying and resting within
[2:14:28] us oh my I tell you the Lord is so good
[2:14:32] at me the word is so so rich and so
[2:14:37] precious to our hearts amen aren't you
[2:14:40] thankful tonight when you look back over
[2:14:42] the tests and trials of your life that
[2:14:44] it's God's mercy and God's grace to keep
[2:14:47] us as clean channels in that powerful
[2:14:52] God it's God it's not us there's not one
[2:14:55] of us that would ask and say Lord I want
[2:14:57] to trial I want to test none of us do
[2:15:01] that but the Bible says is the trying of
[2:15:04] our faith it also says it worketh
[2:15:07] patience and the whole part is cleansing
[2:15:11] and purging so that that life and his
[2:15:14] work might be accomplished aren't you
