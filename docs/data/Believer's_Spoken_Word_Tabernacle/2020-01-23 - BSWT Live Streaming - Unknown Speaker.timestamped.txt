[39:22] that God that you'll continue to touch
[39:25] their bodies you want Lord may you move

[39:30] here tonight Lord that maybe they aren't
[39:33] feeling well in their body more than
[39:34] someway I ask God that you'll touch him
[39:38] as you touch each and every heart Lord
[39:40] spiritual you know our needs tonight not
[39:45] they would be drawn to you I pray Jesus
[39:50] precious amen amen
[39:56] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[40:00] so thank the Lord for His mercy tonight
[40:04] I want to go in the scriptures if we
[40:09] could let's start with Exodus 15 once
[40:12] again I only want to just read two
[40:14] verses of Scripture from there verse 25
[40:16] and verse 26 and then we'll let you have
[40:19] your seats
[40:28] in exodus verse 25 there it says and he
[40:33] cried unto the Lord and the Lord showed
[40:37] him a tree which he had cast into the
[40:41] waters the waters were made sweet and
[40:44] there he made for them a statue and an
[40:48] ordinance and there he proved them and
[40:51] said if thou wilt diligently hearken to
[40:55] the voice of the LORD thy God and will
[40:59] do that which is right in his sight and
[41:01] will give ear to His commandments and
[41:04] keep all his statutes I will put none of
[41:08] these diseases upon thee which I have
[41:10] brought upon the Egyptians I am the lord
[41:14] that he V amen thank god bless you bless
[41:19] the reading of his word as you're being
[41:21] seated
[41:26] I'd like to look a little bit more
[41:28] tonight on that thought the Lord that he
[41:30] Lavie when we look at this and for some
[41:36] time months quite almost about a year
[41:41] ago and just you know looking at these
[41:43] things and many times that we we
[41:47] minister upon healing it's always
[41:50] present within every part in every
[41:53] aspect of the gospel and yet sometimes
[41:55] we we understand that how God in
[41:58] ministering to our needs and where we're
[42:01] at God would speak so specifically to
[42:05] help you and I and even in our approach
[42:08] of things brother Branham would would
[42:10] mention it when we look at many of the
[42:12] messages on healing that brother Branham
[42:15] would minister some of them you know
[42:16] you'll find were and will minister for
[42:18] maybe 24 minutes and then it goes on and
[42:21] on from there on messages that were just
[42:23] specific within healing and we know that
[42:26] within healing there's no way that you
[42:28] can actually deal with healing or
[42:30] minister or preach divine healing
[42:33] without actually administering and
[42:35] dealing with sin because sickness itself
[42:39] is is a substance of death and death
[42:42] itself has set in remember in the very
[42:44] beginning when God had given the word to
[42:49] the first family and first couple in
[42:51] Eden he said the day you eat thereof
[42:53] that day you shall die yet we realized
[42:56] when they when they when they had eaten
[42:59] and taken of that of the tree of
[43:01] knowledge of good and evil we recognized
[43:03] that that was another being that was
[43:05] their spiritual being that was Satan who
[43:09] was present there and death itself had
[43:12] set in before it ever death made its
[43:14] effect known in the body death set in in
[43:18] the soul when Eve herself when she took
[43:22] in that of a lie against God's Word and
[43:24] it moved there from her mind and sweat
[43:27] down there into her soul and then the
[43:29] actual act followed and within we find
[43:31] the pronouncing of the judgment upon
[43:35] that to where that death itself death
[43:38] already come to that of the soul
[43:40] there had been a separating from the
[43:42] presence of Almighty God and then we
[43:45] find that how that death itself would
[43:47] set in so much to where that God would
[43:50] say that that you know the ground is
[43:53] cursed and he would God would speak that
[43:55] you know from dust I'll came and dust
[43:58] thou shalt return and I don't want to
[44:00] speak on death tonight but yet to the
[44:02] believer we realize that even within
[44:05] time and how time goes and sometimes you
[44:08] know you've seen loved ones or you've
[44:10] seen different ones that have have
[44:12] suffered and I think of how that you
[44:15] know I remember even when a you know
[44:17] brother Paul we had been eunuch a ting
[44:19] and even from where brother Paul of
[44:22] Fontaine's were where that he was
[44:23] looking at even upon his dad him brother
[44:26] Paul made this statement he said you
[44:28] know he said there's enough prayer
[44:29] that's growing up he said there is
[44:31] enough faith that is set forth that if
[44:33] it is the will of God to raise him up
[44:36] here in this life you'll be raised up
[44:38] but they're better requests and I
[44:41] believe it's the desire from our heart
[44:43] for everyone loved ones and different
[44:46] ones that when you see someone suffering
[44:48] no one likes to see anybody suffer and
[44:50] yet so I remember you know brother
[44:52] Paul's request I thought about it with
[44:54] with my own daddy that you know as much
[44:57] as he could have remain here in this
[45:00] life but I look even in my own daddy he
[45:02] was already suffering they said if you
[45:04] keep him here you'll be a vegetable
[45:05] there would be nothing that that could
[45:08] be done and you know one thing about it
[45:11] is in this lifetime
[45:12] we certainly miss that being able to
[45:15] greet somebody call him up talk to him
[45:18] or hear from him again but as a believer
[45:20] Paul would let us know that our sorrow
[45:23] is not as others but he says our sorrow
[45:27] ensure we are sorrowful we are sad but
[45:31] we realized that they have went ahead to
[45:34] the shore to the home that we soon are
[45:37] to be going to and whether we go by the
[45:41] way of the grave or or whether by way of
[45:43] the rapture it's a glorious reality to
[45:46] know that where our destiny is is laid
[45:49] within God it gives us a real rest it
[45:53] gives us a real
[45:53] peace in the Lord and when we look at
[45:56] this this reality that that is here you
[45:59] know brother Branham would talk about
[46:01] death he said you know death will back
[46:04] your back you into a corner here God get
[46:06] you out
[46:06] death will back you into a corner there
[46:08] God gets you out death will back you
[46:11] into a corner here Carl gets you out he
[46:13] said but eventually said death remember
[46:15] he said death can only pull you into the
[46:18] presence of Almighty God so even with
[46:21] what you know the last the last hole in
[46:24] the last straw
[46:25] though he could say like that that the
[46:27] enemy has but yet within it all his
[46:30] kingdom and everything has already been
[46:33] conquered by the mighty Conqueror amen
[46:38] there there is no defeat to that of a
[46:41] believer it's all victory and so when
[46:46] when we we look at these things we we
[46:49] realized that this was a part of the
[46:51] journey that Israel was on and there was
[46:54] that value that I believe when God would
[46:58] allow this situation to come about
[47:00] remember God he is speaking here that he
[47:03] said he allowed us to come about for a
[47:06] statute for an ordinance and to prove
[47:09] them you see God is wanting to give them
[47:12] a witness that of a statute that here as
[47:16] he goes on to say if you will hearken
[47:19] diligently to my voice that means
[47:22] carefully in antutu to look in upon that
[47:26] and to do what is right in my sight you
[47:29] see now look God is asking them that
[47:32] they would carefully and diligently
[47:35] take in of the word and in their heart
[47:37] their motives and objectives would be
[47:40] set right because remember that God
[47:43] looks on the heart what many of man and
[47:48] others can see and look at remember man
[47:51] sees the work of the faith that is
[47:55] resting in our heart and so all of that
[47:57] is covered in that verse of verse 26 of
[48:00] where that our hearts would be given to
[48:03] the Word of God what value there is to
[48:05] the Word of God what they forth
[48:07] in Eden now God is letting him know I
[48:10] have brought you out of the house of
[48:13] bondage and I am not brought you just to
[48:18] come to this wilderness and this is a
[48:20] place but I have a place prepared for
[48:24] you that I'm taking you to so along this
[48:28] journey there are things that will come
[48:31] up along the way to remind you that this
[48:34] is not your final resting place
[48:37] things will remind you that this is not
[48:40] your home things will remind you if you
[48:42] happen to get off a track a little bit I
[48:45] will release and allow the enemy to
[48:47] touch your body to line you back up in
[48:50] my will and we realize that all sickness
[48:53] that comes it is not all the chastening
[48:57] of the Lord we we understand that as
[49:00] believers that when sickness comes that
[49:03] there is times where sickness comes and
[49:05] there is nothing wrong with a walk and
[49:08] the life of a believer they're not out
[49:10] of step but they're right in step and
[49:12] but yet we understand this as believers
[49:16] that Satan cannot touch our life until
[49:20] he first gets permission from Almighty
[49:22] God I'll tell you what I'm grateful to
[49:26] be under the protection of the Lord
[49:28] Jesus Christ I'm glad that before the
[49:32] enemy can do anything he first has to
[49:35] get permission of the chief shepherd
[49:38] that's standing at the door and God will
[49:42] give him limitations that he can go to
[49:44] we see that within job remember he
[49:47] touched job's family he touched their of
[49:50] the family and he was certain I'll make
[49:53] him curse you to you to your face but
[49:56] then we find out that job didn't curse
[49:58] God as a matter of fact when the reports
[50:00] came in Joel chapter one job begin to
[50:04] worship the Lord it wasn't because of
[50:07] the circumstances but if he entered into
[50:10] worship the Lord and I that you can take
[50:12] what you want to think but I believe
[50:14] that Joel was a him might have been
[50:16] sorrowful no doubt with
[50:18] his spirit within his body but one thing
[50:21] job was thankful for got a revelation
[50:24] had come to his life and there had been
[50:26] a lamb that had been offered that though
[50:29] token the word had been applied to that
[50:32] home and that his children that they
[50:34] knew the Lord and the word joke had
[50:36] saved I can rest my my spirit is
[50:39] sorrowful but this one thing that I know
[50:42] I know that I shall meet him so even in
[50:46] the midst of our sorrow and despair
[50:49] there is still worship to Almighty God
[50:54] from the heart of the believer
[50:57] that's the loyalty of the heart that
[51:00] brother Branham talks about and three
[51:02] kinds of believers he said it's the
[51:04] loyalty of the heart that beats the
[51:06] material until it's ready to go into the
[51:08] mold
[51:11] God is so mindful of our needs
[51:16] he can't how that Satan you know would
[51:20] common he he's permitted to afflict our
[51:24] body while we're here on this journey
[51:26] but notice God would let them know there
[51:29] is the value for obedience to the Word
[51:32] of God where they walked away from
[51:35] obedience to the Word of God God lets
[51:39] them know right here in this that there
[51:41] are situations that's going to arise
[51:44] that are so bitter there are things that
[51:47] will take place and you know with
[51:49] healing here we could go and a lot of
[51:51] avenues not only physical healing but
[51:53] that even many times were it can be even
[51:56] in our emotions that we have been hurt
[51:59] or we have been injured brother Ram
[52:01] talked about in his own life but to
[52:04] realize that within it all God wouldn't
[52:06] let him see the value of obedience to
[52:09] the word so much so that he would let
[52:12] him know sickness will come but this one
[52:14] thing that I will say to you he said
[52:17] that with your obedience to the word I
[52:19] will put none of the diseases of Egypt
[52:23] upon you now I want you to think of the
[52:25] mercy of God when you read in
[52:28] Deuteronomy 28 also Deuteronomy 7 you'll
[52:31] realize that there are things that God
[52:33] placed within their diseases that was
[52:35] brought upon the Egypt such as leprosy
[52:38] leprosy would be that of where one who
[52:42] had rose up against the word we see the
[52:44] example with Uzziah Jews I rose up and
[52:48] he challenged the position and authority
[52:50] of the priesthood he was smitten with
[52:52] leprosy
[52:53] right there we recognized that even were
[52:57] Miriam herself you know she couldn't
[52:59] understand how could you know Moses be
[53:02] saying that and we should marry among
[53:05] you know and and not have any mixture
[53:07] and yet he marries one a Midian but yet
[53:10] God would let it know you cannot
[53:12] question even things that you yourself
[53:15] do not understand do not question and
[53:19] when she questioned leprosy she was
[53:23] smitten with
[53:23] leprosy remember what God had said it
[53:26] would have been better that your father
[53:28] spit in your face then you to speak
[53:30] against my prophet is that right so we
[53:33] find here leprosy came but notice the
[53:36] mercy of God the mercy of God it reached
[53:40] out to Miriam she had to remain outside
[53:42] of the camp but the mercy of God would
[53:45] bring healing to her body her life and
[53:48] bring her back into the camp think about
[53:51] that now when we look at this when we
[53:53] see these or conditions or diseases that
[53:56] God would bring upon people who have
[53:59] been disobedient to the Word of God and
[54:01] God would allow that he talked about the
[54:03] madness and other things like that
[54:05] think about those lepers in the days of
[54:08] the Lord Jesus
[54:09] think about those in the days of Elijah
[54:12] they had to have a promise to hang on to
[54:15] you see within everything you know it's
[54:19] like you and I you know even though we
[54:21] look at that diseases have come upon
[54:24] this earth and many times those diseases
[54:26] lack in Egypt our vials that have been
[54:29] poured out of temporary judgments like
[54:32] brother Brown will talk about the flu he
[54:35] said the influenza was a vial that was
[54:37] poured out when England rejected the
[54:40] gospel yet how many of us have ever had
[54:43] the flu but we have not had the flu
[54:46] because we rejected the gospel we have
[54:48] come in contact with the flu because we
[54:51] live in this pest house are you
[54:54] listening
[54:54] so we find that there are situations and
[54:57] things that will arise that from our
[55:00] hearts that we know that our hearts is
[55:02] following him in in line with the word
[55:05] of God we also know that with God and
[55:08] listen to me close these the burden of
[55:10] my heart with this in many different
[55:12] things to share this tonight because
[55:14] many times the way that the enemy will
[55:17] work when sickness comes and it's not
[55:19] just among young converts or new
[55:22] believers he worked sometimes of UNEP on
[55:25] the older believers and he work and want
[55:28] to bring something as though that there
[55:30] is something between you and God let me
[55:33] just tell you something you can take to
[55:34] the bank and cash it and go ahead and
[55:36] buy something
[55:37] and that is if there is anything between
[55:40] you and God God
[55:43] don't play games while don't hide
[55:46] nothing from you if there's something
[55:48] where the chastening is coming in your
[55:50] life
[55:51] it ain't guess God Himself will reveal
[55:55] it the mercy of God will reveal it so
[55:59] that that area can be lined up it won't
[56:03] be left up to you or me trying to drum
[56:05] up charges come on somebody so when we
[56:09] look at that that's one of the first
[56:10] things that we that we would look at in
[56:13] God's Word and to know that that to be
[56:16] the truth I wonder if you turn with me
[56:17] to Romans chapter 8 verse 10 you know
[56:22] it's return here to Romans 8 verse 10
[56:24] Paul what's up Paul would write of this
[56:28] if and if Christ be in you the body is
[56:34] dead because of sin but the Spirit is
[56:38] life because of righteousness
[56:42] in if the spirit of him that raised up
[56:45] Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[56:47] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[56:50] also quicken your mortal bodies by his
[56:55] Spirit that dwelleth in you therefore
[56:58] brethren we are debtors not to the flesh
[57:01] to live after the flesh for if you live
[57:04] after the flesh ye shall die but if you
[57:09] through the spirit do mortify the deeds
[57:13] of the body ye shall live for as many as
[57:18] are led by the Spirit of God they are
[57:20] the sons of God for we have not received
[57:23] the spirit of bondage again to fear but
[57:28] we have received the spirit of adoption
[57:30] whereby we cry Abba Father the spirit
[57:36] itself beareth witness with our spirit
[57:37] that we are the children of God and if
[57:42] children then heirs heirs of God and
[57:45] joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we
[57:48] suffer with him that we may be also
[57:52] glorified together for I reckon that
[57:57] these sufferings notice plural the
[58:01] sufferings of this present time are not
[58:05] worthy to be compared with the glory
[58:08] which shall be revealed in us
[58:18] hallelujah
[58:24] hallelujah I just saw I need to keep
[58:27] going here for the earnest expectation
[58:32] of the creature waiteth for the
[58:36] manifestation of the sons of God for the
[58:40] creature was made subject to vanity not
[58:46] willingly but by reason of him who had
[58:49] subjected the same in hope remember God
[58:52] could not make us sin he placed us on
[59:00] free moral agency is that right
[59:05] so not willingly were we subjected to
[59:09] this but there because of the choice
[59:12] that was made verse 21 sent because the
[59:16] creature itself also shall be delivered
[59:20] from the bondage of corruption into the
[59:23] glorious liberty of the children of God
[59:27] for we know that the whole creation
[59:30] groaneth and travaileth in pain together
[59:33] until now and not only they but
[59:35] ourselves also which have the
[59:39] firstfruits of the Spirit even we
[59:41] ourselves groan within ourselves waiting
[59:44] for the adoption to wit the redemption
[59:47] of our body now remember how Paul laid
[59:51] this out we've not received the spirit
[59:54] of bondage bondage is fear fear is
[1:00:00] slavish
[1:00:02] I have to do this if I don't do this I
[1:00:05] don't know if I'd be accepted at that
[1:00:07] that's slavish fear but we have received
[1:00:10] the spirit of adoption adoption is that
[1:00:13] of placement where we in ourselves come
[1:00:16] in to the right place or position or as
[1:00:19] brother Brennan would put it like that
[1:00:21] he says of where your name was wrote
[1:00:23] there he says here in your old book but
[1:00:27] he says your name has been transferred
[1:00:29] into that of the marriage bla book of
[1:00:33] that of the Lamb's Book of Life he
[1:00:36] didn't write your name in the Lamb's
[1:00:37] Book of Life it already was there and he
[1:00:41] was there there was a seed within you
[1:00:43] laying in representation to your name
[1:00:47] being in that part of the word and it's
[1:00:49] connected with the theophany that's on
[1:00:52] the other side the only thing that had
[1:00:55] to happen is the quickening power of God
[1:00:58] would come upon our hearts when there
[1:01:00] was oh my there was a desire to be
[1:01:04] delivered we were down in Egypt's
[1:01:08] bondage remember they went every day
[1:01:11] they made bricks every day but he got to
[1:01:15] a point God kept allowing the process of
[1:01:18] time to come home to where eventually
[1:01:21] their prayers
[1:01:22] changed it changed to a place to where
[1:01:26] the Bible says God had respect to their
[1:01:30] prayers because they begin to no longer
[1:01:33] pray make my life better they begin to
[1:01:36] pray Lord let the promise come to pass I
[1:01:40] want to get out of Egypt Lord I'm tired
[1:01:45] of living in this pondage under a
[1:01:47] taskmasters cast verse driving me to do
[1:01:50] things I don't to do I want to be
[1:01:54] delivered
[1:01:56] they were calling for a promise of God
[1:02:00] that belong to them and God heard their
[1:02:04] prayer and there just happened to be a
[1:02:09] man by the name of Moses it just
[1:02:17] happened to be you know no God had him
[1:02:20] there for a purpose because before they
[1:02:25] could ever be let out of Egypt God had
[1:02:28] to deliver Moses of Moses that's the
[1:02:32] first Exodus is to deliver Moses of
[1:02:34] Moses just like when he delivered Jacob
[1:02:38] Oh Jacob he let Israel out his arise
[1:02:43] they got to a spot in their prayer that
[1:02:46] they got tired of being in bondage and
[1:02:49] so notice has here within the life
[1:02:54] moving into our life it comes that of
[1:02:57] the spirit of adoption where the spirit
[1:03:00] of that land the spirit of Almighty God
[1:03:04] amen our Heavenly Father it moves down
[1:03:08] as he is searching for you and I moving
[1:03:11] on our heart you realize that before you
[1:03:14] and I could ever cry out and say father
[1:03:16] save me it was because there was already
[1:03:19] something there that could be stirred up
[1:03:22] by God to cry out save me hallelujah and
[1:03:28] the Spirit of God would move down like
[1:03:30] it did upon the prodigal son and said
[1:03:33] save me father and the same Holy Ghost
[1:03:37] that would send that unction there and
[1:03:40] move upon her life and that part on the
[1:03:42] inside would raise up and begin to
[1:03:45] respond remember when God is moving he
[1:03:49] has a leadership for our lives he does
[1:03:52] not move upon our lives to leave us in
[1:03:55] limbo he comes to lead us and God had a
[1:03:59] message that was for them that they
[1:04:02] might be
[1:04:04] into the Liberty that the soul was
[1:04:08] crying out for the wilderness was not
[1:04:14] their destination they were just passing
[1:04:18] through and God took him away that he
[1:04:23] wanted to take them but here they were
[1:04:26] they had been free from Egypt I want you
[1:04:30] to think of this for a moment they had
[1:04:32] been freed from the taskmasters but then
[1:04:35] how God led them the way that he led
[1:04:37] them he had come to the Red Sea but God
[1:04:41] has a purpose within it all because the
[1:04:44] enemy is going to try to take their life
[1:04:47] he's going to try to overtake them but
[1:04:50] God makes a way that through that of the
[1:04:52] Red Sea when it would be open that when
[1:04:55] Pharaoh would try to pass through that
[1:04:57] Red Sea he wouldn't be able to make it I
[1:05:01] don't care how strong they were I don't
[1:05:03] care thoroughbred their horses were they
[1:05:05] couldn't make it to room that of the Red
[1:05:08] Sea which is a type of that of the blood
[1:05:12] of Jesus Christ brother Branham would
[1:05:15] reach back and even pull it as a type of
[1:05:18] a shadow of Pentecost he said where when
[1:05:21] they were driven by under those
[1:05:23] taskmasters here but on the other side
[1:05:25] they had joy they had Liberty hey man is
[1:05:32] the same way that even as we look at the
[1:05:35] Red Sea the Red Sea is also a type of
[1:05:37] our deliverance that here we pass from
[1:05:41] this life into that life that of the
[1:05:44] rapture and even the tribulation Saints
[1:05:47] 144,000 it is all a reality of the
[1:05:51] victory where everyone has come through
[1:05:53] the blood even those in the tribulation
[1:05:57] that don't know his name but they come
[1:05:59] to know his name are you with me so we
[1:06:03] find that how that within this this
[1:06:06] great time of coming across there they
[1:06:11] were free they were free of that of
[1:06:15] Egypt and they were walking
[1:06:17] in this wilderness but yet there was a
[1:06:19] land that they were called to you
[1:06:20] realize that this what we just read in
[1:06:22] Romans a it is just the same parallel of
[1:06:26] the journey that Israel was on to think
[1:06:30] of it how that it would be written here
[1:06:33] in Romans 8 but here you and I are the
[1:06:36] body is dead Paul would write and call
[1:06:38] it the mortal body he would speak that
[1:06:42] there was a life within you and I before
[1:06:44] it was a life that was in direct
[1:06:47] contrast to the Word of God but God rich
[1:06:51] in His mercy would move down and God
[1:06:55] would change that nature he would kill
[1:06:58] that old man on the inside but he would
[1:07:01] leave us here in this body this body has
[1:07:05] Paul calling it a body of death a body
[1:07:08] at Ages a body that's susceptible to
[1:07:11] sicknesses all kinds of weaknesses and
[1:07:14] things but yet God in His mercy would
[1:07:17] move down in place within our hearts the
[1:07:20] spirit of adoption and the spirit of
[1:07:23] adoption in our hearts lets us know that
[1:07:26] I'm only here in the possession not my
[1:07:29] inheritance this is my possession not my
[1:07:32] inheritance but in the meantime while
[1:07:35] I'm looking for my inheritance I will
[1:07:38] take the earnest money of the
[1:07:40] downpayment
[1:07:41] and manifest the victory in this mortal
[1:07:45] body if I didn't have to preach I
[1:07:50] believe that run but the band said it
[1:07:56] like this and I read this one to you the
[1:07:57] last time we were together out of God of
[1:07:59] this evil age he said now go he's asking
[1:08:03] God that you would heal the sick and
[1:08:05] afflicted and he says now Lord I believe
[1:08:07] the second paragraph I have there now
[1:08:09] Lord but for the greatest of all healing
[1:08:11] if you heal their physical body from
[1:08:14] cancer TB pneumonia is something they'll
[1:08:17] get sick again
[1:08:18] no doubt if they live very long for
[1:08:20] their body you still under sin the curse
[1:08:26] but let the real divine healing the
[1:08:31] healing of soul which makes a new
[1:08:33] creature passes from death unto life and
[1:08:36] then waiting in this old Tabernacle for
[1:08:41] the redemption of the body after the
[1:08:44] soul has been redeemed I like that
