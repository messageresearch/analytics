[35:56] may God bless you I looked out the

[36:01] there from praying in here and I thought
[36:03] my goodness not
[36:06] again with the and I know that snow it's
[36:09] not like we're down south where you know
[36:12] if if they hear the word snow it's like
[36:14] oh my goodness what do we do you know
[36:16] but
[36:18] um um you know what I want to just say
[36:21] thank you and uh just being able to be
[36:24] here tonight and make it out tonight
[36:26] through through whatever you had to come
[36:27] come through to to get here and uh
[36:29] certainly I know between the deacons and
[36:31] myself we try to keep a watch on those
[36:33] things and we don't certainly don't want
[36:35] to force anything but I'm thankful that
[36:38] God makes a way we can come together
[36:39] aren't you amen amen and uh always want
[36:43] to remind you those some of some that
[36:45] live obviously almost half of the church
[36:48] live a great distance from here um but
[36:51] just always to use wisdom if we have
[36:53] service it means that it's okay to have
[36:55] it within this radius uh but you always
[36:58] have to use wisdom from where you're
[36:59] traveling from you know cuz I know some
[37:02] places over there near akan and then you
[37:04] can have places in sanduski you just
[37:06] have to use wisdom with where you're
[37:08] located and and um you know within it um
[37:12] so we'll we always try to keep a watch
[37:14] on that I want to say um I we I'd taken
[37:19] account and looked at those items that
[37:21] are out there on the table the addresses
[37:24] and birthdays anniversaries I've I've
[37:26] updated um updated that you'll see if
[37:29] you put any marks on there it's
[37:30] highlighted over that let you know that
[37:32] I've got that covered um and so if you
[37:36] haven't checked that out of your
[37:38] birthday anniversary please put that on
[37:41] there um we certainly would like to have
[37:43] it um also the telegram I think we're
[37:47] getting we're getting more and more
[37:48] people
[37:49] on and um so and I also know some some
[37:54] people I've talked to some brothers and
[37:55] sisters your your password is what
[37:58] what's kind of held you up and uh so you
[38:03] know we'll see what we can do there's
[38:05] I'll tell you what these these young
[38:07] ones and brother Brian I mean
[38:09] these I'm just happy I can do certain
[38:12] things on my iPad and on my computer I'm
[38:14] right there you know but these when I
[38:17] get into trouble that's when I I'll ask
[38:19] them hey how do you do this or sometimes
[38:21] I'll ask my boys I'll say Hey how do you
[38:23] do this I want to do this how do I do
[38:25] that but you know perhaps you can just
[38:27] see one of them maybe after service or
[38:30] um maybe at the fellowship dinner on
[38:32] Sunday um just I think it's so handy
[38:35] because we're able just to um put those
[38:38] things out there and uh we we did it
[38:41] purposely I explained this to you before
[38:43] just so you understand when you some of
[38:44] you the first time you see it you're
[38:46] like I can't respond to anything well on
[38:49] those threads you can't and the reason
[38:52] we did that is
[38:54] because you know how it is sometimes
[38:56] when respon say the message gets lost y
[39:00] uh I'm on threads like I said with
[39:03] ministers some here in the states some
[39:05] in the area some that are around the
[39:07] world hundreds and and all of a sudden
[39:09] you wonder what's what's everybody
[39:10] saying praise the Lord about what are
[39:12] they saying amen about and then you
[39:14] realize oh oh oh oh oh oh okay 2: a.m.
[39:17] in the morning this was sent from a
[39:18] brother in Uganda oh that that that's
[39:21] what they're talking about so we want to
[39:23] try to keep it so that it's not cuz
[39:26] everybody gets a lot of notifications I
[39:28] know that um we get and so that's what
[39:31] we've tried to do that just to keep it
[39:33] simple um that it's always before us the
[39:35] announcement and prayer request and um
[39:38] so thankful to hear that brother Shane

[40:15] bouquet and um you know God has such a
[40:19] way that uh and and I CU I believe in
[40:22] that I believe we need all parts of the
[40:24] five-fold ministry we you know we we
[40:26] might have certain preferences but we we
[40:29] what we want is is Lord I want to always
[40:31] see you whatever vessel you're using I I
[40:33] want to I want to be to that level of a
[40:36] I want to I want to become a mature son
[40:38] and daughter of God that I'm not looking
[40:40] at the vessel and say oh this that's a
[40:42] little bit different in Ministry I want
[40:43] to be mature enough to say God help me
[40:45] to see you because this is a vessel that
[40:49] there's a gift in there but I'm I'm
[40:50] depending on seeing you you know my
[40:52] needs so Lord take that vessel and just
[40:55] speak to my heart and I'll tell you it's
[40:56] abs absolutely beautiful how God takes
[41:00] the different gifts that he's placed in
[41:02] the body and I I tell you I'm just I'm
[41:05] just so thankful to be a part of the
[41:06] body of Jesus Christ I'm thankful to see
[41:09] how God uses the gifts in the body
[41:12] because what what you see what rejoices
[41:14] my heart is not only have I been blessed
[41:16] but the church we've been edified we've
[41:19] been helped and that to me is that's
[41:22] that's that's what it's all about amen
[41:24] don't you love the Lord tonight amen
[41:27] let's just stand and I'm probably going
[41:29] to read from a scripture I'm not
[41:32] probably I am and I've never preached
[41:34] from this scripture that I can ever
[41:36] recall from in my life and you're
[41:39] probably thinking what could that
[41:40] possibly
[41:41] be it's a scripture we refer to many
[41:45] times but it's a scripture that I've
[41:48] never just taken a text upon and
[41:51] ministered from it but looking at the
[41:53] Book of Job where we have been drawing
[41:56] inspiration from that of job 26 and
[41:59] remember we were looking at the aspects
[42:01] of how that um the attribute and the
[42:05] display of Savior and how God worked
[42:08] through men down through the Old
[42:11] Testament and it was not the man that
[42:13] was the Savior but it was the word of
[42:15] God but a Man became surrendered God
[42:18] used prophets God God still uses
[42:20] Ministry God sent has a prophet as he
[42:23] sent in this hour God still has lives
[42:25] and you and I in our lives as we're
[42:28] surrendered to the Lord can actually be
[42:31] used to be able for God to minister even
[42:34] that attribute to bring help to bring uh
[42:38] Salvation to someone else not our words
[42:41] but his word because our words will fail
[42:44] but his words can't fail and so we just
[42:47] want to be channels that's what Jesus
[42:48] when he told the disciples he said when
[42:50] you go and Terry in Jerusalem and when
[42:54] you be indued with power from on high
[42:56] then
[42:57] shall you be Witnesses unto me and
[43:00] that's that's where we're at is we want
[43:02] to be with all of our hearts God true
[43:04] Witnesses and that true expression
[43:06] through our life so I want to read here
[43:09] this this scripture out of Ecclesiastes
[43:11] chapter 11 and verse verse one cast thy
[43:17] bread upon the waters for Thou shalt
[43:20] find it after many days give a portion
[43:24] to seven and also to eight for thou
[43:27] knowest not what evil shall be upon the
[43:30] Earth if the clouds be full of rain they
[43:34] empty themselves upon the Earth and if
[43:36] the tree fall toward the South or toward
[43:39] the North in the place where the tree
[43:41] falleth there it shall
[43:44] be he that observe the wind shall not
[43:48] swow and he that regardeth the clouds
[43:51] shall not reap as thou knowest not what
[43:55] is the way of the spirit nor or how the
[43:57] bones do grow in the womb of her that is
[44:00] with child even so thou knowest not the
[44:03] works of God who maketh all in the
[44:06] morning sow thy seed and in the evening
[44:09] withhold not thine hand for thou knowest
[44:13] not whether not and whether shall
[44:15] prosper either this or that or whether
[44:18] they shall both be alike
[44:20] good the scripture goes on to say truly
[44:23] the light is sweet and a pleasant thing
[44:25] it is for the eyes to be behold the son
[44:28] but if a man live many years and rejoice
[44:31] in them all yet let him remember the
[44:34] days of darkness for they shall be many
[44:37] all that cometh is Vanity now watch the
[44:41] last part of this scripture here as well
[44:43] Rejoice oh young man in thy Youth and
[44:47] let thy heart cheer thee in the days of
[44:50] thy Youth and walk in the ways of thine
[44:52] heart and in the sight of thine eyes but
[44:55] know thou that for all these things God
[44:57] will bring thee into judgment therefore
[45:01] remove sorrow from thy heart and put
[45:04] away evil from thy flesh for childhood
[45:08] and youth and youth are
[45:10] vanity i' just like to speak here if the
[45:13] Lord would help us a few moments of
[45:15] casting thy bread on troubled human
[45:20] Waters let's just pray Heavenly
[45:24] Father Lord Jesus how thank thankful we
[45:27] are for your mercies tonight Lord Lord

[46:28] be dealt with Lord and moved upon in our
[46:30] lives would you help us Lord give us the
[46:33] grace that father we might be able to
[46:36] see as we look into the word the way

[47:00] Can Do Lord we just commit ourselves
[47:02] into your hands Lord and ask that you
[47:04] would forgive us if there's anything

[47:08] Lord that would have been displeasing to
[47:10] you in any way help us father that Lord
[47:13] Our Lives Lord might be fitted and
[47:15] pleasing to you we commit this service
[47:17] into your hands and ask that every
[47:19] single need Lord would be met for your
[47:22] honor and glory in Jesus precious name
[47:25] amen amen God bless BL you as you're
[47:27] being
[47:29] seated I want you to think back to that
[47:31] scripture as we looking at it and as we
[47:35] were referring that there in the Book of
[47:37] Job of job 26 of where job had asked of
[47:41] those Brethren that had come to him how
[47:44] savest thou him that has no strength and
[47:49] him giving might to him that ha no power
[47:52] and to know that here that you know the
[47:55] Brethren as we were talking and as they
[47:57] had come to job they had every good
[47:59] intention but yet they lacked the
[48:03] discernment and you know there's things
[48:05] that within all of walks in our life
[48:08] there's many needs that's Among Us
[48:11] there's many needs of individuals that
[48:13] we rub shoulders with on a daily basis
[48:17] there's lives and sometimes that we can
[48:19] look at and see that maybe perhaps on
[48:22] the outside they are smiling but yet on
[48:25] the inside there's so much torment and
[48:27] turmoil that is taking place you got to
[48:30] remember we're living in a time in an
[48:32] age that where the Bible said men's
[48:35] Hearts would be failing for fear there's
[48:37] there's such such anxiousness depression
[48:40] and and fear that's upon the people and
[48:43] realizing that where we are standing we
[48:45] are standing at the point of the coming
[48:48] of the Lord we're here there we're we're
[48:50] were here standing at the end time these
[48:53] things were prophesied to be and yet we
[48:55] see so many effect effects and so many
[48:57] things that actually lend itself and
[49:00] lead to this to where that you find
[49:02] things where lives are so bogged down
[49:05] with spirits and oppression and so many
[49:07] other things and we know that even in
[49:09] this hour that we're living in and we
[49:12] think about you know these Dimensions we
[49:14] live in the first three dimensions but
[49:16] in that fourth dimension itself and to
[49:18] think about even how that's where
[49:20] television waves come through that's
[49:22] where even the waves like of this
[49:24] wireless microphone that's through a
[49:26] cell phone and all those different
[49:28] things come through their internet all
[49:30] those things and yet we're finding here
[49:32] even in the time that you and I are
[49:33] living in of when we look sometimes at
[49:36] individuals and people and whether and
[49:38] it's not just middle AG it's not just
[49:40] young people or older people it's people
[49:43] of all ages and it's amazing and
[49:45] astounding sometimes of the things that
[49:47] you can find that's so present among the
[49:49] young people and it's not just something
[49:51] that has just come or Fallen right out
[49:53] of the air we realize that there are so
[49:55] many things that's happening even right
[49:58] through that fourth dimension there
[50:00] there is such a such right now even with
[50:03] things through the internet and so so so
[50:05] many different things in that way you
[50:07] realize that the Bible tells us because
[50:09] we're living in a time it told us that
[50:12] as it was in the days of Noah so shall
[50:14] it be in the coming of the son of man
[50:17] that's right then it also said as it was
[50:19] in the days of lot so shall it be in the
[50:22] coming of the son of man so within those
[50:25] two things that the Lord Jesus Jesus
[50:27] would be mindful to point out it when
[50:29] remember lot was called out Noah was
[50:31] taken in so there's a coming out of and
[50:35] there's a going in but in the days of
[50:37] Noah the Bible said of how that the
[50:40] Earth itself was filled with violence
[50:44] through them there were lives and
[50:46] individuals in that moment in time that
[50:49] had been able to come under such an
[50:52] influence of demonic spirits such evil
[50:56] such wickedness that was that was around
[50:58] now I want you to understand this
[51:00] sometimes the evil and the wickedness it
[51:02] can be so much compartmentalized but let
[51:05] me just tell you something the evil and
[51:07] the wickedness that would even have been
[51:09] in the days of Noah would have been even
[51:12] that of religious Spirits because
[51:15] religious spirits that would have come
[51:17] and gathered around the ark would have
[51:19] waited would have criticized Noah would
[51:22] have you know torn it all there is
[51:24] nothing to this man and this message
[51:26] that we've got to come and get into this
[51:29] Ark but I'll tell you if they wanted to
[51:31] be safe they had to get into the ark
[51:34] they had to come under that word if not
[51:37] they would not withstand the waters that
[51:41] was going to come upon the earth I want
[51:44] to remind you there's also spoken of in
[51:47] the Book of Revelations of where it
[51:49] speaks of the great that sets upon
[51:52] that of the thickness and the multitudes
[51:55] of people or upon the waters and to see
[51:59] the effects and and we're not ignorant
[52:01] to know exactly of what of what that is
[52:03] we understand it's that Roman Catholic
[52:06] system that is so permeated down through
[52:10] the time and the ages and sure there's
[52:12] been daughters and so forth that's come
[52:14] out of there but you see the effects of
[52:17] it that all throughout the world and and
[52:19] where we're at there people are so
[52:21] religious it Marvels me even in the time
[52:25] that we're living in that you can't even
[52:28] even watch or look at a politician
[52:31] without them saying one thing blessing
[52:33] the name of Jesus and then a curse word
[52:36] going out of their mouth at the same
[52:38] time it it shows you the desensitizing
[52:42] that has taking place and that is
[52:45] religion religion will never take the
[52:48] place of true salvation religion is only
[52:52] a covering that covers where the actual
[52:55] need really is that's what took place in
[52:58] the Garden of Eden is it not when the
[53:01] ACT had taken place in the Garden of
[53:03] Eden it wasn't an apple we understand
[53:06] that there was an act that took place in
[53:08] the Garden of Eden and where did they
[53:10] cover they covered where the ACT had
[53:13] taken place they didn't just go and grab
[53:15] any leaves that was laying around they
[53:18] would if they did they would have
[53:19] grabbed some of the biggest leaves they
[53:20] could get a hold of but they grabbed fig
[53:23] leaves because fig leaves it speaks of
[53:27] seeds
[53:29] within are you with me multiple seeds
[53:33] within here we are living in in an hour
[53:36] in a time where there's such troubling
[53:39] among Humanity I mean I I pray God help
[53:42] us to be sensitive to lives and hearts
[53:45] cuz we do not know when we look at all
[53:48] of the seed we do not know who is seed
[53:51] who's not I I to me I'm not worried
[53:53] about that I just pray God help me to
[53:56] shine the light let my light be a help
[53:59] or an encouragement to someone else you
[54:02] might say brother Samuel they might
[54:03] never darken these doors that is not
[54:05] going to stop me from shining the light
[54:08] to encourage and help another human
[54:12] being along life's way Hallelujah Hey
[54:14] listen if God thought enough that he
[54:17] would allow men to tap in to certain
[54:20] things with medicine surgeries and other
[54:23] things knowing because there'd be people
[54:26] that would not believe in Divine Healing
[54:28] and God would be so loving and merciful
[54:31] that he would so arrange that it's not
[54:34] those men that heal it's not a surgery
[54:36] that heals it's God who is the Healer
[54:39] life is the Healer in the body but God
[54:42] in his love would be so mindful to move
[54:45] for those needs in humanity how much
[54:48] more you and I that's
[54:51] right amen now when we think of this
[54:54] this Troubled Waters all around us H
[54:57] it's just it's amazing of the of the
[55:00] time than here of where that we are
[55:02] living in and to understand casting thy
[55:05] bread I want you to know this it's not
[55:07] just casting bread but it's thy bread
[55:10] upon the waters what is bread bread is
[55:13] the staff of life is that right right
[55:17] the children of Israel were sustained by
[55:20] the Mana that came down from above is
[55:22] that right but then here stood the the
[55:26] ACT actual antitype or the Perfection or
[55:29] him who could declare I am that true
[55:33] bread from Heaven he he was not
[55:35] discrediting the Mana he sent the Mana
[55:38] but the Mana was only a type of him to
[55:40] where that there would come a true
[55:43] sustainment into the very heart of man
[55:46] that would sustain man that would give
[55:48] you and I the strength to live above sin
[55:51] through him by a true relationship where
[55:54] the bread of life himself has come down
[55:57] and surrendered his life that he himself
[56:00] might impart his life into you and I
[56:03] that we can have strength that we can
[56:06] live more abundantly it's the bread of
[56:09] life that's among us this is why that
[56:11] even in the evening time God promised
[56:14] there would be light in the evening time
[56:17] God promised there would be bread in the
[56:19] evening time even when we in ourselves
[56:22] would would pray and admonish give us
[56:25] this day Our Daily Bread we we we need a
[56:29] continual uh filling of the spirit of
[56:32] God not that we lose it because once
[56:35] you're sealed you cannot become unsealed
[56:38] but when you've ever been sealed but we
[56:40] realize that within it God I need more I
[56:43] I need I need that bread I need that
[56:46] Revelation to guide and direct my life I
[56:49] want more of him give us this day our
[56:53] daily bread hallelujah we're not Beggars
[56:57] we're not strangers we are Sons and
[56:59] Daughters of God that have been
[57:01] purchased by the blood of the lamb and
[57:03] the spirit of God has brought that
[57:06] reality to you and I that I was always a
[57:08] son and daughter of God clear back from
[57:11] the mind of God I always belonged to him
[57:14] and he came and sought me out I was not
[57:17] seeking for him it was him that came and
[57:20] sought me
[57:22] out you know what that is that that
[57:24] ought to create a faith in our
[57:26] to know there is one who loved me and
[57:29] that kind of a love that has been
[57:31] bestowed upon me I I want to serve him
[57:34] with all my heart Lord with all my life
[57:37] you sought me out
[57:40] Lord casting thy bread thy bread I want
[57:44] you to understand once you you have
[57:47] received that bread that life that word
[57:50] remember when we stand here and here we
[57:52] are and we take that communion we take
[57:55] it in symol as Paul gave it remember
[57:58] Paul caught by Revelation he takes us
[58:00] back to the Last Supper Paul wasn't even
[58:02] there but being a prophet of God he sees
[58:05] that last supper and he breaks it out I
[58:07] have received of the Lord and he takes
[58:10] these very symbols and shows of what
[58:14] that is of the wine of what it's to
[58:17] represent it's to represent the blood of
[58:20] Jesus Christ it's to represent inside of
[58:24] that wine there there there is a power
[58:27] of
[58:28] stimulation there is an authority to
[58:31] divorce and remove sin and to cleanse
[58:34] the life there is a power within it and
[58:37] it's a fellowship
[58:40] amen and then the bread that bread has
[58:44] it's been broken and that bread his body
[58:48] his body he was he was he was he was
[58:51] crucified here here his side was opened
[58:54] and to think that body that bread it
[58:57] represents the body of Jesus Christ by
[59:01] the indwelling of his own
[59:04] life it represents this is why that in
[59:07] our lives this is the same thing that
[59:10] when Abraham met MDC he gave him Bread
[59:13] and Wine he gave him what was needed
[59:15] after he overcame that's what happened
[59:17] in Acts 2 it was the coming of the
[59:20] spirit of God the same one that meant
[59:22] Abraham gave them what they needed Bread
[59:24] and Wine he gave them the holy spirit
[59:27] because the Holy Spirit and the word are
[59:29] not two separate things it is one and
[59:32] the same yes sir that's why when we are
[59:35] born of the word we are born of the
[59:38] spirit we are born of the water and of
[59:40] the spirit amen gives us the strength
[59:43] that we have need of so then in our
[59:45] lives we are living by the bread of God
[59:50] that's so good that's so good we're
[59:53] living by his bread yes that's a living
[59:57] bread Our Lives display this is a living
[1:00:01] bread it this is not this is not like
[1:00:04] the Mana that fell remember it it fell
[1:00:07] and they were required to go and get it
[1:00:09] but they could go out there and they
[1:00:11] could get that mana and they were told
[1:00:13] don't keep more than what you're going
[1:00:14] to eat after you get done make sure you
[1:00:17] burn it is that right why because it
[1:00:20] would contaminate with
[1:00:23] maggots now I want you to think of this
[1:00:25] yet they they were commanded Moses was
[1:00:28] commanded or told Aaron go and take and
[1:00:32] fill a golden r with that Mana that fell
[1:00:35] on the first day and put it into the
[1:00:38] holiest of holies the same Mana oh my
[1:00:41] but that Mana never got maggots in it
[1:00:43] that's right never corrupted you know
[1:00:47] why it just shows when the holy spirit
[1:00:50] makes its way beyond their mind beyond
[1:00:52] their spirit and it comes into that abod
[1:00:55] that God has serve for himself in the
[1:00:57] soul and our Nature has been changed the
[1:01:00] Holy Ghost will never depart from our
[1:01:03] lives it's a
[1:01:06] seal it's a seal we are held there by
[1:01:09] the Seal of the Living
[1:01:11] God oh glory be to God that's an anchor
[1:01:14] friends you see this is why when the
[1:01:17] bread is revealed and ministered it
[1:01:20] brings a certainty and a real positivity
[1:01:23] to the heart of the believer that is
[1:01:25] born of that word because what you are
[1:01:28] resting in is not your own works it's
[1:01:30] not your own Merit but you're resting in
[1:01:33] the redeeming work of the blood of the
[1:01:35] Lamb that you see working in your own
[1:01:38] life sir and that's where your rest is
[1:01:42] at and through our rest then becomes the
[1:01:46] reflection in our lives so bread itself
[1:01:48] is a staff of life I want you to think
[1:01:51] of this this brother Brown preaches a
[1:01:54] message here called Mother's Day
[1:01:56] and I want you to listen to what he says
[1:01:58] here he says oh the resurrection means a
[1:02:01] lot to me I'm anticipating on that great
[1:02:04] crowning hour aren't you I'm looking
[1:02:06] forward to it and then as the light
[1:02:08] begins to spr spread forth we'll know as
[1:02:11] we're known we'll understand we'll
[1:02:13] remember our acquaintance and the ones
[1:02:15] that's been there remember remember when
[1:02:17] they were on Mount
[1:02:18] Transfiguration they knew who Moses and
[1:02:21] Elijah was is that right they they they
[1:02:24] nobody had to tell them or to try to get
[1:02:26] pictures to prove it they under the the
[1:02:29] prophet says it like this under that
[1:02:31] inspiration he said when that morning
[1:02:33] breaks you recognize your mother
[1:02:36] Hallelujah you recognize your loved ones
[1:02:39] that's gone on before some of you that
[1:02:41] lost children or grandchildren before
[1:02:43] they ever came to the age of maturity on
[1:02:46] that Resurrection morning you will
[1:02:48] recognize them why because they are a
[1:02:52] part of that word and it's that word in
[1:02:54] you and the in insiration of the Holy
[1:02:57] Spirit to bring that
[1:03:01] realization oh what a what a what a day
[1:03:03] we have to look forward to what a moment
[1:03:06] watch this this I I want just just to
[1:03:07] take I want you just to draw
[1:03:09] encouragement from this the prophet says
[1:03:12] it like this he says there'll be many
[1:03:14] there that we didn't even think would be
[1:03:18] there you know it's at that time I
[1:03:20] believe the bread that we have cast upon
[1:03:23] the human Troubled Waters will return to
[1:03:26] us on that day when we see the effects
[1:03:30] of Our Testimony on people that we
[1:03:33] didn't understand their action towards
[1:03:36] it will probably be there what a day
[1:03:41] amen that will bejah Hallelujah so we
[1:03:44] don't understand their action towards it
[1:03:46] you know what it's saying the scripture
[1:03:48] is saying that even their action don't
[1:03:50] judge their action for it amen just our
[1:03:54] responsibility is to shine the light oh
[1:03:58] my you know what friends that rejoices
[1:04:00] my heart to recognize and realize that
[1:04:04] there will be lives that our testimony
[1:04:06] by God's grace has touched and maybe
[1:04:09] they were a little offended put out with
[1:04:11] it maybe they were a little indifferent
[1:04:13] but the grace of God in our lives it
[1:04:16] walked on with the love of God and you
[1:04:18] know what was left they might have
[1:04:20] disagreed with the word why because of
[1:04:23] what they have been taught y right right
[1:04:25] not because they wanted to but because
[1:04:28] of what they've been taught but let me
[1:04:30] remind you love the love of God is
[1:04:33] greater and able to dismantle every
[1:04:36] ounce of hardness it's able to overthrow
[1:04:39] every bit of bitterness and Malice and
[1:04:41] enmity the love of God is
[1:04:44] greater no wonder the songwriter said oh
[1:04:48] love of God how rich and pure how
[1:04:52] measureless and strong
[1:04:56] Glory Hallelujah casting our bread upon
[1:05:00] trouble water it's not my responsibility
[1:05:03] what comes out of but God our testimony
[1:05:06] before others when you'll see others on
[1:05:09] that day and they were standing there
[1:05:12] and we in our mind the last Reckoning
[1:05:14] that we had is oh my the way they were
[1:05:16] going but you don't know what took place
[1:05:19] between that time that we spoke that
[1:05:22] we've lived and then when they stand
[1:05:25] there
[1:05:26] oh my I'm just going to say with I'm
[1:05:29] going to say it like this I want to take
[1:05:31] everybody with me that God's
[1:05:34] intended and you know what God had asked
[1:05:36] me to sort sort people out God hadn't
[1:05:38] asked me to do that he said son just
[1:05:40] cast The
[1:05:42] Net just cast The Net even the disciples
[1:05:45] wanted to sort out the tears and and
[1:05:48] move this and move that he said don't do
[1:05:50] it lest uprooting the tears you'll
[1:05:54] destroy the
[1:05:57] wheat Let It Grow and in Harvest it'll
[1:06:01] declare itself it'll be gathered notice
[1:06:04] he goes on to say here in this he says
[1:06:08] and then the seeds that we've SED not
[1:06:11] even thinking what they would
[1:06:13] do but here they are yes they are they
[1:06:16] brought forth precious F fruits and
[1:06:19] we'll see them on that day the Wayward
[1:06:22] loved ones and relatives
[1:06:26] that scripture believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:06:29] Christ and thy and thy house shall be
[1:06:32] saved Isaiah
[1:06:34] 6365 they and their offspring shall be
[1:06:38] there with them it does not matter how
[1:06:40] Wayward they might be right now remember
[1:06:44] God's grace is greater than their
[1:06:46] waywardness you and I were Wayward at
[1:06:49] one
[1:06:52] time let's just put it this way the
[1:06:54] reason that we see what we see where we
[1:06:57] are where we are is for such a time as
[1:07:01] this everywhere you look at the
[1:07:04] scripture when the Revelation struck
[1:07:05] Abraham he became an
[1:07:08] intercessor is that right Revelation
[1:07:11] Struck it could struck struck Moses he
[1:07:13] was an
[1:07:14] intercessor amongst the wrong of the
[1:07:16] people intercessor Esther as in the
[1:07:19] wrong that was taking place everything
[1:07:22] she became an intercessor
[1:07:26] and that's what the spirit of Jesus
[1:07:28] Christ is even in you and I right now
[1:07:31] it's the right kind of a mediator that
[1:07:33] it ministers within you and I to be able
[1:07:36] to say Lord forgive them they don't know
[1:07:38] what they're doing they didn't mean to
[1:07:40] say it that way father that's right they
[1:07:43] they they don't they don't know any
[1:07:44] better but Lord God give us Grace give
[1:07:46] me Grace Lord let my heart be that much
[1:07:49] more sweetened that what will be left
[1:07:53] and impressed upon them will not
[1:07:55] necessarily be that they remember all
[1:07:57] the words that I've said but Let It Be
[1:08:01] You Let It Be You Let It Be You Lord
[1:08:05] because after all that's what it's about
[1:08:09] it's about him that's that's what it's
[1:08:11] really about all the preaching all the
[1:08:13] word all the sharing all the testimony
[1:08:15] all the witnessing it's about one thing
[1:08:17] it's about getting people to the Lord
[1:08:19] Jesus Christ that they might see him and
[1:08:22] know him in a personal relationship
[1:08:28] that's
[1:08:30] Hallelujah so here you know it's the
[1:08:34] it's the bread I want to just say it's
[1:08:36] the
[1:08:37] bread of Our
[1:08:39] Testimony
[1:08:41] right I won't ask you to raise your
[1:08:44] hands but there's no doubt all
[1:08:46] throughout this
[1:08:48] congregation those that would be
[1:08:51] streaming sometimes you get
[1:08:53] discouraged sometimes you look look
[1:08:55] around it's
[1:08:57] true that's what it burdens our heart
[1:09:00] when you see the condition of the world
[1:09:02] I I'm not praying that America turn
[1:09:06] around she's she send away her day of
[1:09:08] Grace that's right that's right do I do
[1:09:11] I do do I pray I I pray for others I
[1:09:14] pray for I pray for you know our local
[1:09:17] uh establishments our you know policemen
[1:09:19] and other things like that I'm
[1:09:21] instructed to by the word of God in
[1:09:23] first Timothy is that right right but
[1:09:25] but we understand how to pray I'm not
[1:09:27] praying for everything to turn around
[1:09:28] and oh God's going to send a Revival God
[1:09:31] has sent a Revival by his word through
[1:09:34] his Spirit remember if God's going to
[1:09:36] send a Revival David was moved and said
[1:09:40] I want to see a Revival but David went
[1:09:43] to the captains of thousands about
[1:09:46] bringing back the ark and when he went
[1:09:49] that way there was a man who died they
[1:09:52] put it on a new
[1:09:53] cart but there's one if there's a sure
[1:09:56] way if Revival Revival comes by the word
[1:10:01] because anything other than that is just
[1:10:03] it just becomes a workup where lives
[1:10:06] it's only a period of time but listen
[1:10:08] the word brings a change brother and
[1:10:10] sister this is why when David was
[1:10:13] instructed he had to go to Nathan and
[1:10:15] Nathan was the prophet on the scene at
[1:10:18] that hour and he instructed him take it
[1:10:21] off that new cart and get it over where
[1:10:24] it belongs over over the hearts of the
[1:10:27] Levites and bring it back into its
[1:10:29] position the word could not come back
[1:10:32] into its position without the word
[1:10:34] giving the direction it must be over the
[1:10:37] heart now let me tell you every real
[1:10:40] Revival in your life in my life in our
[1:10:42] home it starts with a word in our
[1:10:45] life it's a word that brings Revival I
[1:10:49] thank God for songs I thank God for
[1:10:51] music but it's not songs that bring
[1:10:54] Revival it's not I love worship because
[1:10:57] we've got something to worship
[1:10:59] about Hey listen we're living in the
[1:11:01] time of where the lamb has been revealed
[1:11:04] in Revelations 5 and worship is set
[1:11:08] before the children of God I'm thankful
[1:11:10] to see myself in the book I'm thankful
[1:11:13] to see that the lamb has overcome I'm
[1:11:16] thankful to see the clearness of
[1:11:19] Victory but to realize our worship is
[1:11:22] because of the word and where we see
[1:11:25] ourself in the
[1:11:29] word so it's a word that brings
[1:11:31] Revival and God's has sent his word as
[1:11:35] he promised right is that right and so
[1:11:38] God sending his word and I want you to
[1:11:41] think of it that it's the bread of Our
[1:11:43] Testimony our life that's lived cuz you
[1:11:47] know there's a lot of things there's
[1:11:49] when we talk about lives and hearts
[1:11:51] getting discouraged let me just say it
[1:11:53] to you like this it
[1:11:56] isn't we don't know sometimes how how
[1:11:59] far a person could go you can look at
[1:12:01] and say Well they're not doing nothing
[1:12:03] and their backslid and their this and
[1:12:05] they that listen don't ever write nobody
[1:12:07] off cuz let me just tell you something
[1:12:09] right now when when when when when
[1:12:11] that's already in your heart you need to
[1:12:14] get back to the
[1:12:16] Altar and I'm not saying you need to get
[1:12:18] saved again but I'm I'm saying you need
[1:12:20] to meet God and say Lord I need a
[1:12:23] refreshing
[1:12:26] because let me tell you there's human
[1:12:27] Troubled Waters right now there's light
[1:12:30] now let me just say this to you there's
[1:12:32] nothing that's too great for our
[1:12:34] God nothing all the round through here
[1:12:38] in this in this building just with what
[1:12:40] what is here tonight there are lives
[1:12:42] that are testimonies and trophies of
[1:12:45] God's Redeeming Grace there's enough we
[1:12:48] could go throughout this building and to
[1:12:50] be able to declare testimony after
[1:12:52] testimony that our God is more than
[1:12:57] enough that's right that's right but in
[1:13:00] the midst of times when we get weary you
[1:13:03] know the Bible tells us to it tells us
[1:13:05] of how that even in our lives it says
[1:13:08] that let me just skip down to this it
[1:13:10] tells us that don't don't be don't be
[1:13:13] deceived God's not mock it tells us to
[1:13:15] seow The Good Seed and it tells us I
[1:13:18] want you just to really focus in on on
[1:13:20] on verse n let us not be weary in wello
[1:13:25] doing in other words don't get to a
[1:13:28] place to where you just think there
[1:13:29] ain't nothing I'm doing that's making a
[1:13:32] difference it's not
[1:13:34] you it's not you that's making a
[1:13:37] difference it's what's In Your
[1:13:40] Vessel it's the bread it's the bread in
[1:13:43] your life that's giving you strength
[1:13:45] it's the bread that has through your
[1:13:47] life it's an example and that bread is
[1:13:50] being cast out on troubled human
[1:13:54] Waters Hallelujah that's only Satan's
[1:13:56] tactic to try to get you to draw back
[1:13:58] and you think man there ain't nothing
[1:14:00] being effective here I might as well
[1:14:02] quit doing this and I might as well quit
[1:14:04] reaching out I might as well you know
[1:14:06] quit trying to text or I might as well
[1:14:08] quit trying to witness her no that's
[1:14:10] only Satan that's right trying to cool
[1:14:13] you
[1:14:14] off be not weary in well doing for in
[1:14:17] due season we shall reap if we faint not
[1:14:22] yes it is true that we need refreshing
[1:14:26] from the presence of the Lord it is true
[1:14:29] we need to be uh reminded and and
[1:14:32] refilling upon refilling of the spirit
[1:14:35] of God that is absolutely true because
[1:14:37] we in our human humanness and Humanity
[1:14:41] as best as we try we in our Humanity can
[1:14:44] become discouraged by what we see but I
[1:14:48] want you to
[1:14:49] remember faith is not only for when
[1:14:52] you're going through a disease right or
[1:14:55] a
[1:14:56] sickness but it's when things look like
[1:14:59] they're going the opposite way we walk
[1:15:02] not by sight but by faith when you maybe
[1:15:06] see a loved one going a certain way or
[1:15:09] you see a brother or sister maybe
[1:15:11] somebody getting you look and say Well
[1:15:12] they're may be getting a little cold or
[1:15:14] a little LAX don't write nobody off but
[1:15:16] pray for them even the more so and say
[1:15:18] God if whether it be me or somebody else
[1:15:21] let me Lord God in the middle of that
[1:15:24] moment Lord give me the grace to be able
[1:15:26] to reach out to
[1:15:29] him let me go backwards
[1:15:33] here BR says it like this he talking
[1:15:35] about it your little bark meaning your
[1:15:36] little boat like G like the Lord Jesus
[1:15:39] was in as you're sailing on life solemn
[1:15:41] seed testify sing or pray like bread
[1:15:44] upon the Water it'll Return To You
[1:15:46] Someday speak a little word for Jesus do
[1:15:50] something testify sing pray do something
[1:15:53] for him while you're s failing over life
[1:15:56] Soloman all right listen all the
[1:15:59] accolades we could accomplish in human
[1:16:03] life that doesn't mean one thing if our
[1:16:06] life has not been spent for him that's
[1:16:09] the only thing that's going to matter on
[1:16:11] the other side that's right even when we
[1:16:13] stand there before the Judgment seat of
[1:16:15] Christ not the white Throne because we
[1:16:18] won't stand before the white Throne
[1:16:19] under the blood sealed by the spirit of
[1:16:21] God we're not we're not going to be part
[1:16:23] of the white Throne remember we are
[1:16:25] standing by his side as a wife is
[1:16:27] standing there but the Judgment seat is
[1:16:31] that's a part where we give account for
[1:16:33] the Deeds that's done in the body and
[1:16:36] these are things that when we look at it
[1:16:38] in our life Lord when it all is said and
[1:16:40] done look I just want you to understand
[1:16:42] I've said it many times before I'm not
[1:16:44] trying to get accolades and rewards I
[1:16:48] just love
[1:16:49] him whatever he wants me to do I I don't
[1:16:52] care how it compares to somebody else I
[1:16:54] just want to do what he wants me to do
[1:16:56] it it may never be known man I I don't
[1:16:58] care as long as I can do something for
[1:17:02] him that that's all he's did everything
[1:17:05] for me he did for me what nobody else
[1:17:09] could do and not just one time but again
[1:17:12] and again he's been so
[1:17:15] faithful the least little thing Lord
[1:17:17] that I can
[1:17:19] do
[1:17:21] notice a forlorn and Shipwrecked brother
[1:17:25] in seeing shall take heart again said
[1:17:27] Long Fellow yes while we're sailing life
[1:17:30] solom man let's give our testimony let's
[1:17:33] do something that will leave footprints
[1:17:37] on the sands of time footprints that
[1:17:39] perhaps another yes a forlorn and
[1:17:42] Shipwrecked brother seeing what we did
[1:17:45] will take heart again and make another
[1:17:49] try he seen where somebody was pouring
[1:17:51] it out he made a try and stood on the
[1:17:54] Promises of Christ and become a soldier
[1:17:56] of the Cross let's make
[1:17:58] Footprints who knows the footprints that
[1:18:01] you live leave behind through the
[1:18:03] expression of your life you might say
[1:18:06] well I'm not a martyr like they were
[1:18:08] back then but I want you to understand
[1:18:10] the same kind of life that polycarp
[1:18:12] lived and all the rest of them lived
[1:18:14] they lived it by the spirit of the
[1:18:15] Living God they responded to the
[1:18:18] anointing of God that was upon them in
[1:18:21] that hour to surrender their lives right
[1:18:24] is that right and the same spirit of God
[1:18:28] the remember Paul said not not not only
[1:18:30] for me shall there be a crown of life
[1:18:32] but for all them who love his appearing
[1:18:36] right his appearing him making himself
[1:18:39] his word alive right now in our midst
[1:18:43] that it's undeniable it's Jesus Christ
[1:18:46] the same yesterday today and forever The
[1:18:48] Works that I do shall you do also the
[1:18:51] appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ we
[1:18:55] shall receive a crown a crown what I'm
[1:18:57] not interested in a Golden Crown but
[1:18:59] it's a Crown of Life another body a new
[1:19:02] body Paul wrote of it a body that
[1:19:04] reserved in the heavens Peter said it's
[1:19:06] one who's undefiled in the heavens right
[1:19:08] it's a body that is reserved in the
[1:19:11] heavens a
[1:19:12] theophany a word
[1:19:14] body there you go it's reserved amen oh
[1:19:18] I tell you what I'm looking forward to
[1:19:20] the day when not only this body right
[1:19:22] here this terrestrial will be changed
[1:19:24] but but I'm looking forward to when I'll
[1:19:26] no longer have that human Spirit but
[1:19:28] it'll be
[1:19:30] theophany glory be to God aren't you
[1:19:32] looking forward to that we don't go and
[1:19:34] become Angels those that die and slip on
[1:19:37] that pass on in the presence of God they
[1:19:40] don't become
[1:19:41] Angels they move into that Heavenly Body
[1:19:46] that
[1:19:47] theophany just as real more real than
[1:19:51] what we are right here tonight is that
[1:19:54] right amen that's exactly remember they
[1:19:57] saw when Samuel came up remember even
[1:19:59] standing on Mount Transfiguration on and
[1:20:01] on that we could go but notice will'll
[1:20:04] take heart again somebody's seen your
[1:20:07] life in my
[1:20:10] life this is this is really my prayer
[1:20:13] God let my life and let the lives of
[1:20:16] every one of us be a life that somebody
[1:20:19] that is backslid that is Shipwrecked
[1:20:22] maybe their life is a mess that it would
[1:20:24] look like it's easier to untangle
[1:20:26] fishing
[1:20:27] line than their life to be straightened
[1:20:30] out but nothing's too great for
[1:20:32] God there is nothing that is beyond the
[1:20:36] blood of Jesus Christ nothing oh God let
[1:20:40] our life let our testimony Let It Be how
[1:20:44] this is displayed that others that maybe
[1:20:46] have been
[1:20:47] Shipwrecked that there can be a display
[1:20:50] of something of that impression in their
[1:20:52] mind and in their heart to give them
[1:20:54] courage to say I'll rise and try again
[1:20:58] it may not be where maybe you or I or
[1:21:01] somebody has has prayed for somebody
[1:21:03] else it might simply be with someone
[1:21:06] taking notice of how you interact with
[1:21:09] your
[1:21:10] family how you interact with one
[1:21:12] anothers how even when the boss has laid
[1:21:16] everything on you that he can lay oh
[1:21:18] yeah and another one that you're not
[1:21:20] even aware of is watching your life cuz
[1:21:22] we are an influence
[1:21:24] yes we are we are an influence somebody
[1:21:27] is watching our life but where they can
[1:21:30] be able to look at that and say my Lord
[1:21:33] the way he or she has taken that that's
[1:21:36] more that's more than human human human
[1:21:40] strength but it be something that's so
[1:21:42] real that it maybe the rest of the
[1:21:44] people in the plant or the office or
[1:21:46] work walk right by it but there's
[1:21:48] something about it it catches their
[1:21:50] attention and would give them strength
[1:21:53] to rise up and say Lord I'm going to
[1:21:57] trust you amen I'm going to trust you
[1:21:59] what what you are and my brother my
[1:22:01] sister what you are Lord be that way in
[1:22:04] me maybe they won't be asking God about
[1:22:07] strength to just you know be able to be
[1:22:09] sweet and responsive back to the boss
[1:22:11] they might be asking God Lord help me to
[1:22:14] overcome these habits in my life help me
[1:22:16] Lord God to clean out the things in my
[1:22:18] life the things that are hindering me
[1:22:20] Lord God but through that very thing
[1:22:23] right there they can look and know that
[1:22:25] God is alive and
[1:22:27] real sir just cast cast thy bread upon
[1:22:31] the waters it'll return that is so good
[1:22:33] it'll return Yes you know brother Braham
[1:22:36] talks about a sister and I don't know
[1:22:38] what ever happened with her but he talks
[1:22:40] about how that she would make clothes
[1:22:42] for you know sister mey when you know
[1:22:44] she was you know poor and there were you
[1:22:46] know just she was just a little girl and
[1:22:49] how that this this this lady and this is
[1:22:51] what I want you to catch brother Brown
[1:22:53] would talk about how that here she was
[1:22:56] brother BR talks about how that she had
[1:22:57] baxin she lived just right down from the
[1:22:59] church BR said I used to see her dance
[1:23:01] in the church he said man I'd see her
[1:23:04] shout under the spirit of God just shout
[1:23:06] under the power of God he said but she
[1:23:08] she got away she she back and he said
[1:23:11] but every time she would see me on the
[1:23:13] street she would run and grab my hand
[1:23:15] brother Bram pray for
[1:23:19] me you see it wasn't shut out wasn't
[1:23:23] closed off
[1:23:25] you see she knew let me let me say this
[1:23:27] friends we know there's a time for a
[1:23:30] word to be given sometimes there's
[1:23:31] moments where I have found where there
[1:23:34] is times where God will give a word of
[1:23:36] admonition or a correction but God gives
[1:23:39] us the wisdom for what to do at the
[1:23:42] moment where was this individual at they
[1:23:45] themselves were backsliding no doubt
[1:23:47] they did not know how to get out of that
[1:23:50] trap that they were in but they had
[1:23:53] enough confidence and knew that I have
[1:23:56] not been closed off from the body I've
[1:23:59] not been excommunicated Hallelujah and
[1:24:02] they could run to pray for me she came
[1:24:04] it came a time in the hospital she sent
[1:24:06] for him God ministered to her
[1:24:09] heart I want you to think of this here
[1:24:12] in the time we're living in Isaiah
[1:24:14] chapter 14 where it speaks of how in the
[1:24:18] scriptures of how that Satan himself
[1:24:21] Lucifer in Isaiah 14 how are there
[1:24:24] fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the
[1:24:26] morning how art thou cut down to the
[1:24:27] ground which didst weaken the Nations
[1:24:30] for thou has said in thine heart I will
[1:24:32] Ascend into heaven and I will exalt my
[1:24:35] throne above the stars of
[1:24:39] God his desire I will sit on the Mount
[1:24:43] of the congregation in the sides of the
[1:24:45] north I will Ascend above the heights of
[1:24:47] the clouds I will be like the most high
[1:24:50] yet Thou shalt be brought down to Hell
[1:24:52] to the sides of the pit
[1:24:55] to exalt his
[1:24:57] throne to be worshiped above the stars
[1:25:01] of
[1:25:02] God that phrase stars of God means
[1:25:06] messiah's
[1:25:09] Brothers to understand how Satan Here
[1:25:13] Wanting and placing himself to in a way
[1:25:17] be able to detour worship to
[1:25:20] himself and really to understand that
[1:25:22] within our lives if we if we just you
[1:25:25] know sometimes we we get away and and
[1:25:28] sometimes we don't remember just how far
[1:25:31] God has brought us because we can look
[1:25:34] sometimes at situations and I want you
[1:25:36] to remember you weren't schooled into
[1:25:40] this you're not schooled if you're
[1:25:42] schooled into anything you can be
[1:25:44] schooled out of it right amen but it
[1:25:47] takes the spirit of God to come around
[1:25:49] over our lives to break the darkness
[1:25:52] that was around our lives
[1:25:55] that's why the prophet said I would have
[1:25:56] served the Lord at a much younger age
[1:25:59] but there was a spirit that hung around
[1:26:02] me that kept telling me wait a little
[1:26:04] longer wait a little longer wait a
[1:26:06] little longer wait a little
[1:26:09] longer true but finally that Spirit was
[1:26:13] broken I want you to think of this here
[1:26:16] out of works of Faith expressed and I
[1:26:19] want you to think of this
[1:26:21] here out of this part and I want you to
[1:26:23] think of it in this term I want you is
[1:26:26] go through some things I want you to
[1:26:27] think about that on the display of the
[1:26:29] name of Jesus Christ how many believe
[1:26:31] that's what we're called to to display
[1:26:33] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:26:35] there's no other greater name than the
[1:26:37] name of the Lord Jesus Christ now notice
[1:26:40] this when it speaks in works as Faith
[1:26:43] expressed brother R talks about having a
[1:26:44] dream he says I don't dream very often
[1:26:46] I'm not a dreamer I dream that I seen a
[1:26:48] man a young fellow in shackles and he
[1:26:52] was trying to get out now watch this
[1:26:54] somebody told me those are horrible
[1:26:57] people don't have nothing to do with
[1:27:00] them and I seen this young fellow
[1:27:02] getting out of his sa shackle so I just
[1:27:05] let him alone and I thought I'll just
[1:27:07] see what he does so when he got out he
[1:27:11] was a nice fellow and I've seen others
[1:27:14] trying to get out now notice in this
[1:27:17] dream that he
[1:27:19] had he sees a young man that is in
[1:27:22] shackles
[1:27:24] and there are others around him in the
[1:27:27] dream that said those are horrible
[1:27:32] people but when this young man he
[1:27:34] noticed when this young man got out of
[1:27:36] these shackles he thought I'm going to
[1:27:38] see how this young man acts and when he
[1:27:42] got out from under the shackles he was a
[1:27:45] nice
[1:27:47] fellow you see sometimes you begin to
[1:27:49] realize some things that are called
[1:27:51] personality are not personality they're
[1:27:54] demons that's true they're
[1:27:57] spirits that is there but notice when
[1:28:00] the shackle is
[1:28:02] broken what that young man really was
[1:28:04] can actually be able to display itself
[1:28:07] that's what Paul said we were dead in
[1:28:10] sin and
[1:28:11] trespasses we walked according to the
[1:28:14] prince and power of the
[1:28:16] air but God rich in
[1:28:20] Mercy who loved us that while we were
[1:28:24] dead in our sins right aren't you glad
[1:28:28] for
[1:28:30] that I want you to watch how how he goes
[1:28:33] on brother ra talking about within this
[1:28:35] dream you know he's seen brother borders
[1:28:37] and seen others of them and they're just
[1:28:39] brother you know brother B saying
[1:28:40] brother Bram I just can't grasp what's
[1:28:42] going on I want you just to listen this
[1:28:44] very carefully he said they they spoke
[1:28:48] to him even even a certain lady who used
[1:28:50] to help him so much there you know she
[1:28:53] said brother Deliver Us from this
[1:28:56] talking about these iron bars this is a
[1:28:58] house of hell you've been
[1:29:01] misunderstood and you
[1:29:04] misunderstood these people
[1:29:06] too did you catch that yeah you've been
[1:29:10] misunderstood and you have
[1:29:13] misunderstood these people too these are
[1:29:17] fine
[1:29:19] people and I looked over there in a
[1:29:21] great big Cellar big walls down beneath
[1:29:22] a great big cave great iron bars 8 or 10
[1:29:25] in thick and people out of their mind
[1:29:28] Twisted arms and legs beating their head
[1:29:31] like that crying deliver the people
[1:29:33] brother randam help us we're in
[1:29:36] trouble he said I looked around and I
[1:29:39] said I wish I
[1:29:40] could and he says go on and looking
[1:29:44] around and my this little bitty body and
[1:29:46] I looked at he looked at himself his
[1:29:48] little itty bitty body and all he could
[1:29:51] look at and says no way I I can't get
[1:29:53] him them irons them IR bars are sitting
[1:29:55] too close together then and how the
[1:29:57] people are so out of their mind but
[1:29:59] notice how that when you look at it
[1:30:01] brother R says when he looked he seen
[1:30:04] some flick lights flickering around in
[1:30:06] there I want you to notice the lights
[1:30:09] that were there over the in the Sals
[1:30:12] there were lights flickering in there
[1:30:15] but there was people who was bound
[1:30:18] up
[1:30:20] bound but there was lights God let him
[1:30:23] see there are lights flickering in there
[1:30:26] and I looked up and there stood the Lord
[1:30:28] Jesus with lights of rainbow around him
[1:30:31] he was looking right straight to me and
[1:30:33] said deliver those people and I thought
[1:30:36] how could I deliver them I haven't got
[1:30:38] strength enough in my arms to break
[1:30:41] those bars so I said House of Hell give
[1:30:44] way Amen to the name of Jesus Christ
[1:30:50] Hallelujah notice these people were fine
[1:30:55] people yes but in that
[1:30:58] condition in that
[1:31:00] condition you see there's so much that
[1:31:02] we can apply here you seen it sometimes
[1:31:05] as you you know throughout the years and
[1:31:07] times like that whether it may be even
[1:31:09] working with children are working with
[1:31:10] others and things like that sometimes
[1:31:12] you can look at the things that you can
[1:31:14] see and you'll look at it and when you
[1:31:16] when you see it got it's recognizing
[1:31:18] that sometimes there's things you what
[1:31:20] you're what you're dealing with is a
[1:31:22] spirit and what what what what is so
[1:31:28] important is to be able to separate the
[1:31:32] person from the
[1:31:34] spirit because the spirits the spirit
[1:31:37] what it wants to do is draw you or I
[1:31:42] out into a
[1:31:45] battle and every time we leave from
[1:31:48] behind that word we are always going to
[1:31:49] be
[1:31:51] defeated but if standing right there
[1:31:53] with that word I want you to notice this
[1:31:55] cuz we could read right over this quote
[1:31:57] and just just keep on going but I I want
[1:31:58] you to notice where we're drawing from
[1:32:00] this house of Hell give way to the name
[1:32:05] of Jesus Christ there is nothing as
[1:32:09] powerful as the name of Jesus Christ
[1:32:13] amen you know when we have been repented
[1:32:16] of our sins been baptized in the name of
[1:32:18] the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:32:20] of our sins and to receive the gift
[1:32:24] of the Holy Ghost we have been
[1:32:27] baptized into the very person of Jesus
[1:32:30] Christ into the word into that life into
[1:32:33] that domain into him where his life is
[1:32:37] dwelling in us and we are dwelling in
[1:32:39] him and this is why when brother bradam
[1:32:43] when he was asked and that one man told
[1:32:44] Brother Bram said brother Bram I don't
[1:32:46] think you got to call it don't matter
[1:32:48] calling a name over anybody when you
[1:32:50] baptize them he said you know my my wife
[1:32:53] he said said you know he said every time
[1:32:55] you know she sweeps the broom or the
[1:32:57] house she don't say you know in in the
[1:32:59] name of of brother Jones brother Braham
[1:33:02] said he said but you didn't just run out
[1:33:05] there on the street and say come here
[1:33:08] Mrs Jones you had to go through a
[1:33:11] ceremony oh there you go and you went
[1:33:13] through a ceremony and then she became
[1:33:17] your wife right then everything she does
[1:33:21] from that point on she does it in your
[1:33:24] name
[1:33:25] Hallelujah and that's within our life
[1:33:27] this is the power friends it ain't about
[1:33:30] that we can stomp or how loud or
[1:33:32] whatever more let me just tell you
[1:33:34] something your constant belief and faith
[1:33:37] in the word of
[1:33:39] God can send Devils
[1:33:43] flying Hallelujah it can break holds let
[1:33:46] me just tell you something it can break
[1:33:48] holds in your
[1:33:50] home it can break holds that are around
[1:33:53] your children children you know you're
[1:33:55] giving yourself to the name of the Lord
[1:33:57] Jesus Christ giving yourself to that
[1:33:59] character giving yourself to his word
[1:34:01] you
[1:34:02] realize it it can bring it can cause
[1:34:05] things that have been a separating point
[1:34:07] to Bow its
[1:34:09] knee I don't have time to read the rest
[1:34:11] of these scriptures but you can read in
[1:34:13] Colossians 3 everything you do in word
[1:34:16] or deed do it all in the name of Jesus
[1:34:18] Christ but notice what it said the
[1:34:20] scripture before that maybe I will read
[1:34:22] that notice what it said said before
[1:34:24] that let the word of Christ dwell in you
[1:34:27] richly you there's got to be virtue
[1:34:29] there's got to be strength there's got
[1:34:30] to be something that can be given out in
[1:34:33] that time is that right you've got to
[1:34:35] dwell let it dwell in you to dwell in us
[1:34:38] let it become the influence of our life
[1:34:42] so that it becomes Christ in us that is
[1:34:44] the impression on
[1:34:47] others not that they're impressed by us
[1:34:50] but it's a life it's his presence is so
[1:34:53] good
[1:34:54] that's what Philippians 2 I I don't have
[1:34:56] time to read that but that's what
[1:34:58] Philippians 2 as it comes from as well
[1:35:01] you know because we can leave we can
[1:35:02] leave that there and I'm not going to
[1:35:04] read it but we can leave that there
[1:35:06] Philippians 2611 and we can understand
[1:35:09] that what brought that Victory and that
[1:35:11] authority to where that that name is
[1:35:14] above every other name and every devil
[1:35:16] has to bow that character and that life
[1:35:19] was produced and through humility to the
[1:35:22] word of God he learned obedience by the
[1:35:25] things he suffered and through
[1:35:27] submitting that walk in that life you
[1:35:29] know why he did that so that he could
[1:35:31] understand you and I he didn't only come
[1:35:33] down to redeem us but while he walked
[1:35:35] here that he might be able to be the
[1:35:37] right kind of a mediator in you and I
[1:35:39] when it's hard sometimes and it's hard
[1:35:42] to submit to the word we can say Lord
[1:35:45] give me Grace Lord show me Lord teach me
[1:35:49] Lord cuz he knows what it is he knows
[1:35:53] what it is
[1:35:54] he learned obedience through the things
[1:35:56] that he suffered but look at the effect
[1:35:57] of it look what he went through where he
[1:36:00] sacrificed his own
[1:36:02] will what did it bring where every demon
[1:36:07] there's not a name Heaven Earth beneath
[1:36:10] the Earth nothing that won't bow at the
[1:36:13] name of Jesus
[1:36:14] Christ if we can look at this in the
[1:36:16] right way and I could just put a picture
[1:36:18] of you up there put a picture of me up
[1:36:20] there it's daily living in submission to
[1:36:23] the word of God it breaks the
[1:36:28] holes it takes down it
[1:36:31] dismantles House of
[1:36:36] Hell let me tell you sisters there's
[1:36:39] things can I just say it like this I
[1:36:41] want to say God bless you

[1:36:50] brothers we we can walk around well

[1:36:54] like what I'm dressed like there's other
[1:36:55] guys that wear jeans and flannels and
[1:36:58] boots you know but sisters here you
[1:37:03] are walking and your hair right flowing
[1:37:08] true you know because remember long hair
[1:37:10] is uncut

[1:37:24] brothers we we don't you know we don't
[1:37:26] we don't we don't bear that to that
[1:37:28] degree but I want to say what what a
[1:37:31] blessing it is to Bear the
[1:37:33] reproach for
[1:37:35] him what a blessing that is what a what
[1:37:39] a privilege that is to be under the
[1:37:41] authority of the word of God Amen you
[1:37:43] know you know you understand I you know
[1:37:45] I don't know how many times there's we
[1:37:47] could just stop right here and I could
[1:37:48] ask sisters to come up here and give
[1:37:51] testimony of life
[1:37:54] sometimes individuals that's come and
[1:37:56] set in this
[1:37:57] church they might have only set for one
[1:38:01] service but they came because of the
[1:38:04] testimony they saw in one of our
[1:38:07] sisters they would see their life and
[1:38:10] say where is it that you go maybe even
[1:38:13] they poked fun at you and then they'll
[1:38:15] see where you go see it become
[1:38:18] everything becomes you know what it is
[1:38:20] listen those people don't mean to be in
[1:38:23] that way
[1:38:24] that's how they're
[1:38:25] taught they're taught do you understand
[1:38:28] what that is that's Spirits yes it it's
[1:38:32] Spirits that's got in there enticing
[1:38:34] spirits to lead people from the word of
[1:38:37] God Satan doesn't care what he has to do
[1:38:40] as long as he can prevent
[1:38:44] relationship that's that's what he wants
[1:38:46] that's why that he that he sent his
[1:38:48] Doctrine from the pits of Hell on the
[1:38:50] Trinity is to break that even that a a
[1:38:54] picture of a relationship God above us
[1:38:57] God With Us God in us hallelujah that's
[1:39:00] so good it's to break that reality that
[1:39:02] the purpose of God himself coming down
[1:39:06] tabernacling deity in a body of Flesh
[1:39:09] for Redemption is that through and
[1:39:11] through that shed blood he might come
[1:39:13] and Tabernacle inside of a body of
[1:39:18] Believers he becomes the
[1:39:21] example yes he does are you hearing me
[1:39:24] yes the Lord Jesus becomes the example
[1:39:27] of what God intended every son and
[1:39:29] daughter of God to
[1:39:31] be aren't you thankful for that that's a
[1:39:34] clear picture it doesn't put the Lord
[1:39:37] Jesus out here as something of well I'll
[1:39:39] never be able to obtain to a Victorious
[1:39:41] life but it's having that that
[1:39:43] Victorious Life that defeated every
[1:39:45] principality that rose on that Easter
[1:39:48] morning that same one that ascended up
[1:39:50] and now has returned back in the form of
[1:39:52] the Holy Ghost it say that same
[1:39:53] quickening
[1:39:56] power I want you to think of this yes

[1:40:01] glory being revealed in our
[1:40:05] lives brother Brown would tell us like

[1:41:35] going to go I'm not here trying to make
[1:41:37] people see this

[1:42:05] congregation oh my we don't we don't
[1:42:07] know cast thy bread upon the waters yeah
[1:42:11] oh my brother BR said oh he said they
[1:42:13] might disagree with you and fume fume
[1:42:15] and fuss a little bit but they don't
[1:42:17] mean it they really don't mean it if
[1:42:21] they go to fussing they don't mean it
[1:42:23] it's just by what they've been
[1:42:25] taught but just love them right into it
[1:42:30] pray for
[1:42:32] them oh God you see friend this is where
[1:42:34] we need the strength of the Lord It
[1:42:36] Isn't So Much many times the strength of
[1:42:38] the Lord to be able to First be able to
[1:42:41] talk to someone and to to express
[1:42:43] ourselves sometimes there is that
[1:42:45] element of it depend on how we're made
[1:42:47] up and things like that and sometimes
[1:42:48] you know it depend you know a lot of
[1:42:50] different factors but my my point is
[1:42:52] within this is that when we look at this
[1:42:56] let us remember it's not it's not up to
[1:42:59] you it's not up to me to make anybody a
[1:43:04] Believer that's in God's hands right and
[1:43:08] you know the moment that we can just
[1:43:09] rest within
[1:43:11] that it's like it's like in our lives
[1:43:15] anybody ever been stressed
[1:43:17] before wow you guys have wow man you
[1:43:21] ever been to a place you get stressed in
[1:43:22] your chest oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah I
[1:43:25] remember some of the first years when I
[1:43:26] when I started teaching and man I you
[1:43:28] know you're trying to just sort your way
[1:43:30] out you know they tell you the first
[1:43:31] three years in anything is you're trying
[1:43:33] to find your feet and I remember man the
[1:43:35] first year my goodness and my dad had
[1:43:37] just had open heart surgery here I was
[1:43:39] Brother Ray sitting in my classroom man
[1:43:40] I was I was having pains right here and
[1:43:41] immediately pains going down the left
[1:43:43] side oh man and here I am and all these
[1:43:46] are things come on now those thoughts
[1:43:47] come and things like that and I'm
[1:43:49] sitting there and that pain was real I
[1:43:51] thought what is that and what that was
[1:43:53] was stress sometimes tense
[1:43:56] anxiousness many things of life that can
[1:43:59] come and to think that how that that
[1:44:02] sometimes that tenseness of where we
[1:44:03] come and we can feel like I I I've just
[1:44:05] I I've got to say it that's not what
[1:44:07] brother Brandon was doing when he was
[1:44:08] testify he wasn't up tense it was just
[1:44:12] his love with the Lord it just it just
[1:44:17] overflowed if we're going to sit down
[1:44:19] and talk and any time along oh sure we
[1:44:22] might be able to sit around talk about
[1:44:24] hunting and things like that and maybe
[1:44:25] if I see somebody you're somebody that
[1:44:27] you know likes you know some team or
[1:44:29] something like that maybe I can I
[1:44:30] remember somebody that can talk you know
[1:44:32] hey this this this but we going to get
[1:44:34] around long enough he's the love of my
[1:44:37] life absolutely he's a love of my life
[1:44:39] abely we get around long enough and you
[1:44:42] know what it ain't something that we
[1:44:43] have to force how many know what I'm
[1:44:45] talking about you don't have to force it
[1:44:47] he's the love of our life so what I'm
[1:44:49] saying is that those things where it
[1:44:51] becomes like restricted when we get in
[1:44:53] that place of restrictedness that's not
[1:44:55] casting bread upon the Water right but
[1:44:59] the casting of the bread upon the water
[1:45:00] is to
[1:45:02] remember what God did for you and how he
[1:45:05] did
[1:45:06] it he'll do it right for that loved one
[1:45:10] that relative that coworker if they
[1:45:13] belong to him to what even to whatever
[1:45:15] degree that they are yeah you know what
[1:45:17] and it might even be in degrees that God
[1:45:20] would use you it may not be all it once
[1:45:23] that's right it might be years and years
[1:45:26] and years on end brother Sean how many
[1:45:29] years was it that brother Ray witness to
[1:45:32] you uhoh five little by little by little
[1:45:40] by
[1:45:41] little sometimes it's by
[1:45:44] degrees
[1:45:45] degrees sometimes we look at things and
[1:45:48] think man as soon as I some different
[1:45:50] ones of you testify you know brother
[1:45:51] Andy when he worked over there and steel
[1:45:53] mill and how that affected many of your
[1:45:54] lives some of your lives you say well
[1:45:56] why was that it was not because you were
[1:45:58] any greater than anybody else God when
[1:46:01] God shows you anything it's because
[1:46:03] you've got a work to do there's things
[1:46:05] that God desires to move in your life
[1:46:09] the more that he shows you the more that
[1:46:11] he's Desiring he wants to work through
[1:46:14] your life
[1:46:16] right my
[1:46:19] goodness that's good let me can I just
[1:46:21] skip to this last quote here
[1:46:24] nobody said Amen on that
[1:46:27] one but let me just skip to this last
[1:46:29] quote and I want to I'm I'm I'm ending
[1:46:31] here remember
[1:46:35] that they laugh
[1:46:39] like but this is our
[1:46:42] responsibility and God's responsibility
[1:46:45] there's there's two parts here watch how
[1:46:47] brother Bram places this in the message
[1:46:51] he's asked a question
[1:46:53] in the message he's asked the question
[1:46:55] God being misunderstood this is the
[1:46:57] question and then I'll display the quote
[1:46:58] he said 'th Lord has told us through
[1:47:00] prophecy this person's writing a
[1:47:02] question the Lord has told us through
[1:47:03] prophecy to witness unto others of the
[1:47:05] things that we have heard and seen here
[1:47:07] such as The Nearness of the coming
[1:47:10] baptism in the name in Jesus name and
[1:47:12] such things we have told these things to
[1:47:15] some who seem to be Christians yet they
[1:47:17] don't seem to believe what do you think
[1:47:20] will happen to those people will they go
[1:47:22] in the rapture
[1:47:23] brother Bram doesn't he starts the
[1:47:25] question this way but I'm not going to
[1:47:26] display it this way he says I'm glad you
[1:47:28] said at the end of that what do you
[1:47:32] think he said because which he said if
[1:47:36] it's what I think it wouldn't make it
[1:47:39] right he said but I believe now let me
[1:47:42] read it to you he says I believe that no
[1:47:45] man can walk in the light of God until
[1:47:49] God reveals it to him I don't believe
[1:47:52] any amen all these hidden things are HID
[1:47:54] from the people no man can see them
[1:47:56] except God reveals them and I believe it
[1:47:59] because in the Bible it's always been
[1:48:02] that way you have you have eyes cannot
[1:48:04] see ears cannot hear all the father ha
[1:48:06] given me will come on and on many
[1:48:08] scriptures now watch you're responsible
[1:48:12] for spreading the light you're not
[1:48:14] responsible for them receiving the light
[1:48:17] you're responsible to take it to them
[1:48:19] but you're not responsible for their
[1:48:21] reaction if God lets us in that'll be up
[1:48:23] to him they haven't got the garments on
[1:48:26] and so forth but remember they can't see
[1:48:28] it until God reveals it unto
[1:48:33] them so what should we do well the
[1:48:36] prophet said inside of many of those
[1:48:39] places he calls out Methodist Baptist on
[1:48:41] and on and on he said there's many good
[1:48:44] people they're only waiting to see the
[1:48:48] light flashed across their path in
[1:48:54] humility I said oh
[1:48:58] God let us be that
[1:49:00] Lord there's lives on this human
[1:49:03] Troubled Water listen we would be in the
[1:49:06] same shape if not for the grace of
[1:49:08] God listen I'm standing right here I've
[1:49:11] watched God deliver from anxiety I've
[1:49:14] witnessed God heal from
[1:49:16] depression sometimes right away
[1:49:19] sometimes over a period but nonetheless
[1:49:20] it's God healing them that's right true
[1:49:23] and to see human Troubled Waters who
[1:49:27] wouldn't want to see somebody
[1:49:29] helped I remember one of the first
[1:49:31] things that you know sometimes there's
[1:49:33] things it's the first time you see it it
[1:49:34] kind of startles you and one of the
[1:49:36] things I remember you know at times when
[1:49:37] you now it's almost Common Place
[1:49:39] everywhere you go but I remember when we
[1:49:41] first got married I had a neighbor that
[1:49:43] they end up buying the trailer that was
[1:49:45] right next to us and when they moved in
[1:49:47] there and I seen I seen the the the
[1:49:50] gentleman that moved in there oh my Lord
[1:49:53] I I I didn't know how I was even going
[1:49:54] to look at him because like I said now
[1:49:55] this is commonplace but then he had the
[1:49:58] nose ring in had tattoos had everything
[1:50:01] all that was I mean back in 98 that was
[1:50:04] that was strange now you can go into
[1:50:07] certain restaurants and that's almost
[1:50:08] like
[1:50:09] prerequisite but it's just so common but
[1:50:12] it it shows you the time where where
[1:50:14] people are at listen friends you know
[1:50:16] what I'll tell you what under many of
[1:50:18] those things tattoos earrings and
[1:50:20] everything else there's good people
[1:50:24] yes there's people that are bound with
[1:50:27] different spirits and but underneath
[1:50:29] that is good
[1:50:32] people God help us to look beyond the
[1:50:35] shell that's one thing that God that's
[1:50:38] one thing that God spoke to my heart if
[1:50:40] there was nothing else than him bringing
[1:50:43] that that gentleman in right next to me
[1:50:45] it was for God to turn around and speak
[1:50:47] to my heart and say God help
[1:50:50] me cuz if not for your grace no doubt I
[1:50:53] looked a mess and I would look a mess I
[1:50:55] would look like the rest but God in his
[1:50:59] grace not one not you not me God in his
[1:51:02] grace God rich in
[1:51:04] Mercy I
[1:51:06] wonder I
[1:51:08] wonder if we could just look and say
[1:51:11] Lord let me
[1:51:13] cast my
[1:51:15] bread upon the water help me through my
[1:51:18] testimony it may not even be somebody
[1:51:20] that I'm actually talking to might be
[1:51:23] somebody else on the job that's watching
[1:51:24] me how that I've responded and let me
[1:51:27] just say it to you like this there's not
[1:51:28] one of us in here that is perfect or
[1:51:32] that has been free from mistakes on our
[1:51:35] job family whatever more but may we may
[1:51:40] we look and say God if there's something
[1:51:43] that I need to personally go to someone
[1:51:46] and say forgive me for the what the
[1:51:49] response that was displayed forgive me
[1:51:52] because that is not what a son or a
[1:51:55] daughter of God is to display and I am
[1:51:58] sorry that that display was done that
[1:52:01] way you say brother Samuel what will
[1:52:03] that do I'll tell you what humility
[1:52:05] remember I just read to you out of
[1:52:07] Philippians 2 humility to the word of
[1:52:09] God you might say they won't return my
[1:52:11] calls they won't answer my text they
[1:52:13] won't give me no period of time but if
[1:52:15] you'll take it before the Lord and say
[1:52:16] Lord you know that Soul you know that
[1:52:20] Heart Lord you know what I meant Lord
[1:52:22] you know I didn't mean but Lord God give
[1:52:24] me an opportunity Lord yes L that
[1:52:27] whatever that last impression would be
[1:52:29] let him see Let It Be an impression
[1:52:32] where a son or daughter of God has been
[1:52:34] able to display that you know what my
[1:52:38] life it didn't hit the mark but I'm here
[1:52:41] to stand as a son and daughter of God
[1:52:42] I'm here to ask as I've asked him
[1:52:44] forgiveness you forgive me because my
[1:52:47] life is to be an example I want to cast
[1:52:50] the right bread upon the Water let that
[1:52:54] be in our families let it be in our
[1:52:56] church let it be all around that every
[1:52:59] Our Testimony that is left after we
[1:53:02] leave it's been the bread bread that's
[1:53:06] there don't ever lose hope don't ever
[1:53:10] lose hope you hold on to the promise of
[1:53:13] God because God made that promise yes he
[1:53:16] did you love him tonight yes sir oh my
[1:53:19] think about what the prophet said there
[1:53:20] in that Mother's Day message there will
[1:53:22] be individuals he said that we didn't
[1:53:25] think would be
[1:53:27] there to me that CS us even when you
[1:53:30] have thoughts or thinking or different
[1:53:32] things it it causes you to look at
[1:53:33] things right now like hey there's some
[1:53:35] waiting on me right
[1:53:37] now there's some waiting on me right now
[1:53:40] abolutely don't you love the Lord yes
[1:53:43] sir let's just
[1:53:45] pray heavenly
[1:53:47] father thank you
[1:53:50] Lord you know Lord our needs you know
[1:53:53] the needs that are among us you know the
[1:53:57] hearts lives Lord that not only that we
[1:54:01] would rub shoulders
[1:54:03] with dear God we work with in our
[1:54:08] families
[1:54:10] relatives even as that
[1:54:12] other couple of quotes that I
[1:54:17] read of those Lord that would be
[1:54:20] backslid
[1:54:23] Lord sometimes it can be backsliding and
[1:54:26] setting right here in the
[1:54:29] church sometimes lord it's something
[1:54:31] that's happened also along the
[1:54:34] way maybe it's not setting right here
[1:54:38] Lord but
[1:54:41] God May our
[1:54:43] life be a life that
[1:54:46] could be one that somebody could take
[1:54:48] courage
[1:54:50] from maybe it's that returning to that
[1:54:53] loved one or that other and saying
[1:54:55] forgive
[1:54:58] me maybe it was something that maybe it
[1:55:00] wasn't something that wasn't said or
[1:55:03] done maybe it was a lack of
[1:55:05] care just something Lord how you would
[1:55:08] deal with our hearts to be able to touch
[1:55:10] their lives that you could touch their
[1:55:14] hearts Lord
[1:55:16] Jesus there's human Troubled Waters
[1:55:19] around
[1:55:20] us there's prevailing ing
[1:55:24] Waters Lord only the ark would withstand
[1:55:26] those
[1:55:27] Waters there's Waters Lord God as we
[1:55:30] read in the Book of
[1:55:34] Revelations there was also
[1:55:36] Waters that an ax head was lost in one
[1:55:40] day but there was a staff placed in the
[1:55:44] hand of the Prophet could reach down and
[1:55:48] against the laws of gravity
[1:55:52] it brought that ax Head Up From The
[1:55:55] Bottom beneath the waters and joined it
[1:56:00] Hallelujah to that staff right that wood
[1:56:05] oh
[1:56:07] God granted Lord May Our
[1:56:11] Lives be like that in your
[1:56:14] hand may it be like that in your hand
[1:56:17] Lord it could be an
[1:56:19] encouragement Hallelujah to someone else
[1:56:22] along the way maybe it's maybe it's not
[1:56:24] somebody that's out there it's another
[1:56:26] brother or
[1:56:27] sister right here in the local body
[1:56:30] maybe it's a brother or sister we come
[1:56:32] in contact with at a meeting somewhere
[1:56:35] funeral
[1:56:36] wedding sometimes a places Lord where
[1:56:39] individuals will come sometimes it'll be
[1:56:42] places like that or Fellowship dinner or
[1:56:44] family gathering sometimes Lord where
[1:56:45] they'll come in places like that but you
[1:56:48] know what I'm so glad you're not resp
[1:56:52] restricted to work just inside these
[1:56:55] four
[1:56:56] walls as a matter of fact your Prophet
[1:56:58] told us that inside of your children you
[1:57:03] go to church every single
[1:57:06] day Lord Jesus help
[1:57:10] us help us Lord
[1:57:13] to cast The Bread upon the
[1:57:16] water help us Lord that our testimony oh
[1:57:20] we get discouraged
[1:57:22] I know it Lord and I know Lord God all
[1:57:25] around it happens we get
[1:57:28] discouraged but
[1:57:31] father may we take
[1:57:33] courage even in that like your Prophet
[1:57:36] told
[1:57:37] us sometimes the reactions that we have
[1:57:41] seen not because we've had some certain
[1:57:45] thought about somebody or something but
[1:57:47] the
[1:57:48] reaction that we witnessed
[1:57:50] [Music]
[1:57:52] but the reaction that we saw at the
[1:57:56] last was not what was the lasting or
[1:58:01] what
[1:58:02] remained it just shows Lord it was the
[1:58:05] effect of that word on
[1:58:08] display it shows the effect of the word
[1:58:10] of
[1:58:12] God oh
[1:58:15] Lord how many times were we've walked
[1:58:17] away from
[1:58:18] situations whether it be family loved
[1:58:21] ones relatives
[1:58:22] people on the job we just been
[1:58:25] discouraged we've been
[1:58:28] down but
[1:58:30] Lord help us to remember our
[1:58:33] responsibility
[1:58:35] amen our
[1:58:38] responsibility is to Shine the
[1:58:43] Light Lord God it's in your hands to
[1:58:48] open their
[1:58:49] eyes it belongs to you Lord that
[1:58:52] just like you did to us you made us meat
[1:58:55] to be
[1:58:58] partakers of The Inheritance but the
[1:59:01] Saints in light as Paul wrote It's not
[1:59:04] what we
[1:59:05] did but it's your grace
[1:59:07] Lord father would you help us forgive us
[1:59:13] Lord forgive us and I ask you Lord where
[1:59:17] we've let
[1:59:18] down forgive us Lord knowing that Lord
[1:59:23] it was never a
[1:59:25] desire to stumble
[1:59:28] anybody Lord for a mistake or anything
[1:59:31] never never
[1:59:33] Lord you know Lord God even as I was

[1:59:53] done give me the opportunity Lord to
[1:59:56] make that
