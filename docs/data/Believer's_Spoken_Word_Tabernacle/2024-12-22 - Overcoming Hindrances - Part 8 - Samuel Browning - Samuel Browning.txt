Believers that he wasn't born during this time but to understand the reality and the world makes it about certain things but to have that reality in our life of God give us the most precious gift that he could ever give us and you know the world didn't want it the world didn't like the wrapping that it was wrapped in that's right they they they despised that and even in the end time the world didn't like the wrapping and I'm not just talking about the veil but I'm talking about even the manifestation of God they they didn't they didn't want that but you know beyond all of that I I'm so glad that God beyond all of the veil beyond all of the wrapping I'm grateful for the gift I'm grateful for the gift of Salvation I'm grateful for the gift of eternal life aren't you amen I'm grateful for the gift of the Holy Ghost Paul called it the Unspeakable gift amen because it's changed our lives without him we are nothing amen so it's by his grace amen aren't you grateful now we didn't earn it we didn't Merit it but it's by The Sovereign Grace of God well that's enough to get us excited and uh I told my wife on the way home on Thursday she we were going home and I said I am so tempted I said I'd love to continue on from where I'm at on Thursday I said I'm so tempted I said but I've got to obey the Lord I know what he put on my heart for Sunday but uh you know you just enjoy the the good things of God don't you and the Lord just speaks to our hearts and I you know I don't deserve it we don't deserve it but I'm so glad he comes and speaks to us I'm glad he works with us aren't you amen so it's so good to see each one of you and I don't want to just keep you standing but I I love you it's so good to see you see different ones back battling from sickness and different things like that and man it's so good to be it's good to be together amen it's really really good to be together so amen I want to say thank you to the musicians and uh we want to just get ready to turn our attention to the word of the Lord and if you want to uh open your Bibles to Philippians chapter 4 uh and I'm just going to read um I'd like to read um a few verses of scripture from here uh this morning and beginning with verse 4 and then we'll read through uh verse 13 and then we'll pick up from there everybody doing okay okay verse four I want you this is a a common scripture we we hear Rec quoted rejoice in the lord always and again I say rejoice now if you you notice what's very very key in this rejoice in the Lord so not only are we in him but our rejoicing is about him and in him because a lot of times circumstances around us the circumstances if we limit it to that there's no rejoicing in the circumstances but our rejoicing is in the Lord and that's why the rejoicing is all way this is not something this scripture is not something that you know we use to to get people going and get them worked up that's not what this scripture is about it's not about a scripture to whip or brow beat somebody and say hey you you know you don't need to be sad we we experience times of Gloom and other things but this is talking about rejoicing in the lord always that there is a place and in him and concerning him I can rejoice in him I cannot always rejoice in the surroundings that I find myself in I cannot always rejoice in everything I see around me or what I feel but I can rejoice in him that's where where the real true joy of the Lord comes from is the work that he's done in our lives Amen Let Your moderation be known unto all men the Lord is at hand be careful for nothing that phrase means don't be anxious but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be made known unto God and the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your heart hearts and Minds through Jesus Christ finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely and whatsoever things are of a good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things and if we could just pass everything through there because there's a lot of things that's true but it doesn't follow all the the criteria that's right a lot of things it's honest but it don't follow it's got to meet all the criteria word on top of word on top of word it's that's the same way in our lives is that right doctor's report comes in and it says we found this on the scan well that's that's facts but the truth is by his stripes I'm Healed facts and Truth are two different things is that right amen those things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the God of Peace shall be with you but I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again wherein you were also careful but you lacked opportunity not that I speak in respect of want for I have learned in whatsoever State I am in therewith to be content I know both how to be abased and I know how to abound so this is something that Paul has come to understand in his life I know how to be abased and I know how to abound everywhere in in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me can we read that last one together just a just an affirmative confession I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father oh God you who are the word Lord Jesus as we just Lord bow our heads and our hearts Lord in your presence we invite you Lord that is here that you would come Lord and just speak to our hearts in a personal way Lord the things that you have placed upon my heart there's no way Lord that oh God in myself Lord that I can bring these things as you've laid it there on my heart so I just ask Lord that you would just give me Grace to get out of the way and Lord to enter into that same inspiration oh God that moved Lord for this here this morning Lord I pray that you'll take control Lord and speak to every heart to every need minister to our lives Lord in every area Lord Heal those that are sick among us those that are streaming Lord father those Lord in pain and discomfort Lord may you minister to them Lord minister to everyone in need Lord I pray physically spiritually Lord emotionally oh God may you Minister Lord to Body Spirit and soul lord right here this morning once again Lord pour out of your spirit Lord for we give Lord you all the praise honor and glory and just commit ourselves Lord Lord into your hands now in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you as you're being seated amen maybe turn to the person beside you and say God bless you bless you I don't know if they I don't know if they had you do that or not but joy God bless you you don't have nobody beside you but I want to go ahead kick it over for me please but I want to um I want to deal with this thought here on on hindrances and I want to um go just a little bit here upon this and it it's going to take me a little bit to build this but I'm not going to do it all in one service um but I want to look here a little bit more at hindrances and overcoming hindrances in our lives and you know when we think of this thought this is what I want you to be focused on on from the negative to the positive and I thinking of it in this terms you know when you look at it many times we've heard this analogy used and everything is based on perception sometimes even experiences sometimes it can be even where we are presently uh sitting and sometimes you know you you could ask a person what do you see and someone could say well I see a glass that's half empty and or someone else could say well I see it's it's that's half full I mean it's it depends on how you're looking at it so perception is everything and so listen when we understand that when we've come here into this into this life you and I came through and by that that sexual birth that first birth and that's that's a negative there our lives are surrounded by negative there's negative all around us we experience negative you know you get if you you know you you find yourself you know you're growing and you're eating and everything and then all of a sudden you get to about the age of 25 and my things start happening and you know aches start happening and you some of us are eating better than we did before and you know things just aren't happening and and we you know it it but it's all it's all that and itself is all in the negative but you see all of that is that God himself before the foundation of the world he already made up his photo album he's not like you or I where we have pictures of our children and they're going from you know when they were born and you know they look like a red plump melon and then they're going from here or or what have and they're going up but God in his family album God doesn't have a picture of us in any of our uh mistakes or our failures or our flaws but God himself he took a picture of you and I before the foundation of the world the Bible said the lamb was slain before the foundation of world there was a reason that the lamb was slain in the mind of God the Bible tells us in the Book of Job that here it was that when the sons of God God shouted for joy and so here that we understand that God in his album he's already took a picture of you and I of what we were at our best and somewhere between that 18 and 21 year age I always kind of you know I I don't want to joke but I always thought I thought well I hope it's closer to 18 cuz my hair started turning loose when I was 17 so I want to you know but God knows he knows all about it you know and you know it's one thing for sure brother Brandon would say say you know if you're a blonde here you're that's what you're going to be over there if you're a a brunette here you're going to be a brunette over there so it's not all of a sudden that when then when the changes come that when our body has changed oh my I'm going to you know I'm not going to be this anymore I'm not going to be that anymore it's a changing back to what God had in his mind before the foundation of the world as a son and daughter of God and all of the imperfections and all of the negative will have been done away with and it will be fully developed into the positive amen so from that time so until that time here we are walking in this journey in this life of where we are where we experience and surrounded often times by the negative and the negative sometimes is what we can see and what we can feel even in our own being it can things that we can even look at sometimes in our own in our own lives our own failures our own mistakes and then we can look at that and we get to looking at that those are the things that will cause us to become unsteady or questioning and remember what's key is our perception and our perception is is what we're looking at and the spirit of God just comes to dial Us in to the right things on how to look at the right thing because you know what the negative here uh you can go through so many things and oh I'm just going to think positive what does that mean well you could say well thinking positive means that glass is half full but if we think down to a real a real place of overcoming there's only one source that's positive and that's the word of God heavens and earth will pass away so then we want our thoughts to be based on the word of God and any thought that comes in we want to pass it through the word is that all right now notice brother BR says this here in Victory Day He said it seems like the Christian Life if the fellow is not absolutely centered on Christ the Christian life seems like it holds so many disappointments but those disappointments are God's Divine will happening for us now it don't seem like it would be that but it's God's way of doing things he lets us hit the river to see what we'll do do so the key is is that life that is can not be so centered upon Christ and and then it just seemed like everything is such a disappointment but once that life is centered on Christ and you have to maintain your Focus On Christ This World Satan and all of his imps everything around is busy to try to get your focus and my focus off of the thing that really matters and that is the word of God the word of God matters more than my feelings the word of God is more than my surroundings because all these things right here will pass away let me just tell you this right now the trial you're in is not a permanent residence don't have them forward the mail to the trial you're in right now you are just passing through like like like David wrote in Psalms 84 where passing through the valley of baka we are on our way to the translation of the body we are on our way with this is not our final resting place and I'm grateful for God's grace this is why when we come to the house of God you know as we're sitting here you can't push stop on me you can't fast forward me you can't remind me I mean you can get up and walk out but you can't stop any of that you can you can't push play or pause you can't do that and what I'm trying to say is is that as you come and sat right here you are waiting on God to come and speak to your life and let's just be honest sometimes when we come here we're not in the best frame of mind we have walked through things throughout the weak this seems like the negativity and everything that is so far around us we need help from one who is greater than us and we need help from a positive Source that'll come down and minister is word and by the power of the Holy Ghost will take our mind and put it on things of where it needs to be that's the help we we get from God now I'm not talking about not playing tapes you understand what I'm saying because you can be at your house and putting on a tape and then you can get such a place you won't even put a tape on but you walk out of here you walk out of here when you come into the presence of God right here then as you walk out of here what is God doing encouraging you in your daily walk with him and then you're in the message then you're praying then you've got strength to carry on is that right God works in that way so we're not just coming here that we would become uh smarter people sure God imparts knowledge by divine revelation but he's also here to encourage you and I and he works in so many different ways throughout a service God like he brought Israel up to the place of the Red Sea and he wanted to see what they were going to do and he told speak H don't cry to me speak that the children would go forward and the Red Sea opened them up it opened up then we find that even within you know when something is has happened and and sickness has happened and and you know someone backsliding or something that has happened but to come right to that place and speak the word of God and move forward and God will perform his word I want you to think of this here in 2 Corinthians chapter 4 Paul said we have this treasure in Earth and vessels what's he talking about what treasure is he talking about he's talking about God's own life that's the treasure in earn frail vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed that's negative yeah that's good right we're troubled on every side but the positive is we're not distressed amen see I'm not going to let the negative where my sentence the end of it be negative come on Friends notice he says persecuted but not forsaken so another words I'm not ignoring circumstances but I'm just going to tell you this I'm persecuted but I'm not forsaken he said he never leave me nor forsake me so it's gone from negative to positive notice he said said cast down but I'm not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body so the trials the tests that God In His Infinite Wisdom allows to come our way they are tailor made for our lives because God is Desiring to get out of us what he knows lays within us that's why always bearing about in the body the life of Jesus Christ for we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal bodies and Paul goes on to say for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the Thanksgiving of many redown to the glory of God for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day what a contrast outward man is perishing then inward man is being renewed so this outward Madness is feeling the effects and you know of all the tests and all the trials and look it doesn't take very long I mean I I look I'll just say it for myself I look at pictures of myself and I see wrinkles that I never saw before and if I let my hair grow on the sides right here it's it's it's white thank you but I look I look at things that when I when I see it and and you know we we see things that when we go through the pressures the tri look when the Lord Jesus was here he was thought to be a man not more than 50 years old he wasn't even close to 50 years old it was the pressure the burden that he was bearing the outward man was perishing but the inward man that was the truth that was the reality that that inward man on the inside was the strength Giver it's the same way in our lives in our in our walk with God for our light Affliction notice how Paul could say this I I'll just be honest you probably throw tomatoes at me if I made that statement or light Affliction but nobody can throw tomatoes at Paul you know what I mean because Paul ain't making light or simple of the things that we go through let me tell you the things you go through the things I go through they are personal the trials are to bring more of Christ out of us that's what trials are for they're experiences to bring more of God out of us now notice for our light Affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and Eternal weight of Glory while we look not at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal aren't you glad that the Holy Spirit has anointed your eyesight and anoints our eyes to see beyond temporal things of this Earth and there's you know what it is there's a strength cuz you see once you have seen and recognized and caught a vision of the Living God it stabilizes you it's a stabilization that's deeper than your mind it's deeper than your spirit it's what's there on the inside there's an anchor that anchors within the veil it holds you amidst even when your reasoning is gone when the prophet was standing there and the Satan told him said look at everything you've done for him look at everything that's happened he's took your wife took your little baby and brother BR said at about that time I was getting ready to say if that's how he's going to be he said but oh there was something down on the inside that new birth that spoke up in that time and said yay though he slay me I'll trust him it's something that's greater that's within us and you I think we can Fellowship on that through things that we go through that you you recognize that something deeper there's something greater there's something more and there's even how the spirit of God will come and work in our lives in a service and God anointing our sight that we would not walk by the things of this world or of this Earth but we would walk by that sight which is called Faith to be able to see the victory to be able to see what God has for us watch this go God comes down he he comes to change our perceptions of looking at things let me just say this to you that even when the spirit of God has come into our lives we still need the ongoing working of the holy spirit in the renewing of our mind changing our perceptions changing our outlooks on things is that right I'm just dropping this in here he said now because I want you to think that little Eagle the prophet said that little Eagle that walked along in that barnyard down there he he was told he was a chicken that's what he was told all he saw was you know them putting out the chicken feed and this that's all he knew and he was taught to look down because chickens look down they're going to get their food but when that Mama eagle flew over who knew she had an eagle somewhere he was always an eagle Hallelujah you and I were always Sons and Daughters of God right but they had to we had to have a personal contact with the Living God that would change from where we're looking to look up to him and then receive Grace to escape what we were born into this is why it's very clear this is why the word of God it it never expresses that you will become a son and daughter of God you always were a son and daughter of God the Bible said in Galatians 4 because ye are Sons he hath sent forth his Spirit into your hearts is that right so a son and daughter of God it's allowing the spirit of God comes to minister to you and I what our rights are this is why serving God is so much deeper than just coming to church it's yet that's a part of it but it's it's deeper than belonging to an affiliation or or just you know a mental recognition but the reality of it is is a relationship with God where God brings you and I back to that rightful position as a son and daughter of God this is why the scriptures I love the scripture Psalms 82:6 I have said ye are God's and all of you are children of the most high that's good that's a good one Jesus refers back to this it's a powerful chapter but Jesus refers back to it in John chapter 10 and he says is it not written in your law I said ye are gods and if he called them Gods unto whom the word of God came then the scripture cannot be broken now notice when Jesus is referring to this here in John chapter 10 he's speaking of how that the word would come to the prophets but let me ask you the question when the word comes to the prophets why does God send the word to a prophet he sends the word to the prophet because there are people that are ordained to hear what that Prophet has to say that Prophet is just like this microphone that I have on this microphone has no thoughts of its own but a prophet I'm just working with this with the young people there on Friday on prophets but you recognize what a prophet is a prophet is not someone who where God is just speaking to to him as though to tell him something new that's not what a prophet is but a prophet is caught up into the Realms of God's thinking and he hears what God has already said he hears it those words are going around and God brings him up into here that when Isaiah spoke he said he was wounded it hadn't even happen but he spoke of it in a past tense already Declaration of the coming of the Messiah why because when God speaks any word it is finished nothing can alter that word that's right that's right nothing can change that word that's right oh and you and I were always a part of that word that's right Satan wanted to alter and change and tried to scruple up a lot of things in our first birth and experiences and things that happened to us but although he can try to deface the outside he cannot disturb the written evidence that's been sealed on the inside you can change the open evidence but the evidence that's been sealed on the inside you can't touch it that's so good hallelujah hallelujah that can be interpreted in many different ways on what the outside you're this you're that you're this but God comes to let us know who we really are that's is why it matters the word that we're setting under God never called called us to just be you know as church members or or to take up some name and well we're this and we're that well you know I'm a I'm Methodist or I'm Lutheran or I'm Pentecostal or I'm just a message believer I'm not I'm nothing wrong with with walking in light but my point is is that that life's got to be inside of us and God brings a word to you and I to let us know who we really are brother there's nothing that can push back the negative in our life like the positive raise of the s o n watch out brother BR says this here in the uncertain sound he said we've got to tell him he's a Son of God born for the kingdom of God he is somebody this is just a negative a picture a negative waiting for it to be developed someday he said when you die out to yourself a new picture starts on the inside key word starts on the inside a new picture starts on the inside and then that new creature Christ Jesus begins to show itself through and one of these days he will come to receive you up to himself then the whole thing will be changed and then this negative shadow will become a positive though it's developing the picture now just for just for us to revisit and probably for the young people CU When I say camera they think of iPads iPhones and phones but you know there's such a thing called a camera and we'd put in we'd put in phone and I know there's there's also you know photographers that will still use this method and so here it comes there's you know that that role of film starts like this and then it'll you know you you put it in there in the camera and you start taking pictures and what's happening is is there's actually images that is actually being captured through the lens of the camera and th those images are being put in a negative form now I want you to catch this the picture is taken of a positive image the picture taken of a positive image it comes onto a negative but the negative then is submitted to develop the picture of the positive that was taken I didn't lose you did I so if there is the negative on that on the here in this life then there had to be a positive somewhere else where you and I were always Sons and Daughters of God and God took a picture you and I were Sons and Daughters of God and he submitted here that seed of God here that is placed in our life and we're surrounded by the negative but here here in the midst of our life there's a transforming that's going on a picture is being developed what's that picture that's the picture that's according to his mind it's just like this you know you see this right here how many of you ever looked at just negatives yes was it fun no I mean if I if you call me over your house brother R Say Hey I want to show you some picture when I was little boy I might even stop there but but when he shows me over and says hey and all I see is negatives that is not going to be fun right right that ain't going to be fun I mean I've tried to look back at certain negatives you ever have a bunch of negatives messed up and you got to put them back in the right kind of put them back in the right pouch trying to match them up with the right packet of pictures it's hard work you know why you don't see the details there very clearly and that's how God was through the Old Testament it was Parts being revealed down through those ages down through the prophets but when he became manifested when the he stepped forward as the son himself then the negative was developed into the positive it was him in Jeremiah it was him in Isaiah he was he is the Bible never said he was but it says he is despised and rejected of all men he was despised in Noah he was despised in Elijah he was despised in Elisha all of them were parts that when it was developed It produced hallu Jesus Christ so to look at this uh this on the right I'd much rather now when we talking looking at a family album I look at these pictures right here this is what I like to see it's kind of hard to see them details right you take this even here that's a slide looks pretty fun don't it but look over here look at them pictures if I gave you that picture you're looking at you're like I don't know you can't really tell what really well it might be a bright day it might be but over here when that negative is developed it's a positive that's the same thing it is within our lives from here from the negative to the positive now I want you to think about this when God comes in the Holy Spirit comes into our life through and by the transforming power of the Holy Spirit remember in order to take these negatives and make a positive the picture it's got to pass through a dark room right some of us maybe took that in high school where you had to take photography or if you took it as elective so you didn't have to set in study hall or something like that and you and you took that and there was there was you know there was in bends you got to put it in this bin for a while and then going take it up put it in this bin for a while and then put it back down in here and put it back down in there has a lot of work makes me want to say thank God for phones it was a lot of work but it was the it was the it was the chemicals that would cause the development that would bring that all all to pass within there and that's what the Holy Spirit does in our life it develops that negative that that seed that God has put on the inside and here is the positive and the positive is still encased in a lot of negative that's all around us that we have to deal with day by day but what's important is is the positive experience from a positive God gives a positive token that's what is the positive that will lead to eventually everything our body our spirit everything will come together glorify theoy and with that Soul what y brother says this in Christ he says he says what they meant to those people in type what what it ought to mean us in the antitype what they done under the law and what could we do with it today under the baptism of the Holy Spirit if they had the shadow we got the positive they had the negative we've got the positive they have the they had the picture in a negative we've got it in a positive after it's been developed at Calvary and we went to Calvary with the lamb is that right and every believer that comes to Christ must come to the same Cross of self-denial and die there with the Lamb with his lamb die out to our own thoughts die out to your own mental thinking and just take what the holy spirit says in your heart and then live for Christ so then when the new birth is come you know because the thought can come and is like it was with the Lord Jesus and say you know what good could come out of Nazareth well if we're just thinking about Nazareth it's the most meanest City there was but we weren't talking about just of a Nazarene he was there that it might be fulfilled as the scripture said he was a Nazarene but he was he was an identity that was beyond that of a Nazarene look they might look in your neighborhood where you live and say what good could come out of there but we're not talking about fleshly associations we're talking about that which is of god and you could look at your life or look at my life and think what could have ever come out of his life oh yeah I remember I remember the conversations of of things not that it was conversations that I heard but it was passed on bed on to me oh you know you know what what's going to come out of his life and and things like that and you know had things that I I knew I knew I knew teachers knew different things and they you know kind of want to make little jids and stuff like that in the classroom and and so forth I I understood all that but you know what I knew there's one thing about it I'm glad that he came down and he sought me out and he did something for me that no man could do I couldn't bring it out of myself you can't make yourself a Christian it's God himself who comes down and declares himself in your life you you and I are his workmanship this is why Satan always wants to try to bring frustration when we're trying to do something trying to do something and I I keep failing all we're seeing is the negative that's around us but if you can just let go and let the positive God by a positive word say Lord move into the depths of my life oh God blow everything else out of the way how many of you know that bridge that they built over there in Australia brother Ram talks about it many times and there were men that would not take that job up to build it between those two places that island in the mainland there in Australia there are many men said it can't be done but there was one man he had a reputation and he told him he said I'll take the job he said you're you're crazy he said let me have it but he went over there and he blasted beyond all the sand he went down beneath all that was there in that water floor and he blasted it all out until he got down to the Rock that's so you know why because that you couldn't build on anything else and this is why the Holy Spirit it goes down it's a blasting away of our thoughts it's a blasting away of our habits it's a blasting away of desires you know what he's doing he's getting down to the inside because that inside the prophet said is that foundation stone he placed in you and to be a son and daughter of God he builds his Revelation upon that part of himself which is a son and daughter of God that's right yes sir so I say holy spirit Blow Away Lord Blast away everything Lord that's unlike you and let it be founded and when that man came they might have thought he was a bragard they might have thought this guy nothing but a boastful guy but he told him he said I want this bridge filled I want Locomotion locomotives on this bridge I want semis on this bridge I want it full when we open it not just passing over it brother Ryan filled with traffic setting on it yeah you know why he was confident in his work you know why he was confident because of what they couldn't see what was beneath the surface he had hit rock and that's why in your life you might think I don't know if I could take this or I could take that but when it's founded on the rock where are you resting you're resting on the rock of a solid experience in Jesus Christ that you can't get away from even if you tried to oh my I'm talking about the positive this morning yes you are yes you are hallelujah oh my so we've got a new parent now a new parent and everybody knows you know you you have a in your parent what does our parents do will they guide us right it it all changes as as we go I mean you know eventually it got things that you know as as my dad and them would they work with me and well don't touch this it's hot and you know they're trying to cover things up things you know all of a sudden you know for long you don't have no furniture in the house for long it's like let's just take away the walls and we'll just have tents you understand what I'm saying we're just trying to protect all the bruises and things getting knocked out and everything else we are padding on the corner man why didn't they have some as St when we were younger might have saved me from some knots on my head but you see as as a little boy there's times I would fall but Dad would come down and pick me up he would he would reach down with his hand and and there were times when I started to ride that bike I looked at that with training wheels man that was all right but then all of a sudden when it came time to ride without training wheels I don't know about that I don't know about that Hey listen Hey listen I I didn't have the privilege to ride on a sidewalk I was raised in the country and it was gravel driveway just like this was out here so trying to ride the the bike on that that was an extra challenge but think about it here was dad you know on the back of it back you know and you feel pretty good you can you can feel you know Dad holding on but all of a sudden what dad's objective is is to get me confident as his he is there that to get me confident and that ability and those things begin to grow and establish in my life but you know what sometimes it might have taken a day sometimes it took days sometimes maybe it took weeks I don't know but you know at at either point we have transitions in our journey and as we're growing and that sometimes as the growing you all and I remember exactly where it's at we're at times where we were as 5 years old and you're like man if I can only be 10 man why' I got to be five you know some of us you know you couldn't ride the rides at a certain height I won't say no more but then then you have then then you have as time goes on you know you come into certain times you're like man I shoot I can't wait till I'm 16 I can get my driver's permit then after a while you get your driver's permit you know and that's just a one thing to do and you know somebody's there to guide you and help you you don't just go out and say Hey I want a driver's permit no you got to take a test right you got to study a book about a bunch of laws memorize it you got to pass a signs test and all of these things you know all those all those situ ations right and then you have to ride if you're under 18 you've got to have training from a school somewhere plus 50 hours with an adult that signs off on an affidavit ask me why I know that so well right now that's so good but it just don't happen you don't just say hey you know what I feel like driving it's a process it's a process and then even as you get your drivers like well when you get your driver's license do you ride away say soon as you get your driver's license I'm going to take off and man I'm going to Los Angeles I don't think so there's places you've never drove through yet right City Driving is allog together different y right and I'm not talking about lorine lorine City and it's it's Unique in itself believe me but you know uh you know but but still when you go to other places it's it's a different story when you pass through all those things listen what I if you can catch what I'm trying to get to here is it's the same way that God works with our life there's changes that are taking place as he's working with us but sometimes we get frustrated with where we are at true let me just tell you frustration itself is never of God and it's never God's business to try to frustrate us that's that's but God's working with us right now to prepare us for that next moment this is why the scripture says i' I've got to hurry here this this is why the scripture said that you must be born again is that right John 3 you must be born again if you you're not born again you can't even see the kingdom of God and in verse 5 it said except a man be born of water and spirit he cannot even enter into into the kingdom of God so to understand the kingdom of God the blueprints to know what God desires of your life to understand all of that to actually even come into the kingdom of God you must come by the water and the Spirit by the word the new birth is not something that we just grow into the new birth is an event an experience that takes place in our life so good how many of you have pictures from when your children children or child was little only about five of you two of you okay you got you got pictures right do they look the same now no they don't they Everything's changed it changes right even as they start going through different things they start they start changing things start developing so when they're born they don't all of a sudden start out fully mature now I know I know I know I know I know I know when they get to be 13 years old hey they can tell the president what to do Ain't It Funny friend listen to me ain't it funny that even even sometimes even in our spiritual walk with God where you and I listen we don't we don't skip toddlerhood we don't you don't skip the birth is that right you don't skip the birth you crawl you start walking you're a toddler come on now it's the same thing Jesus is using this he never said when a man becomes born again he becomes a fully matured Son of God it's a process is that right it's working on that's why it's working on in our lives that's why we start out with the milk of the word right as we're growing I'm talking about getting Beyond this part that of the negative now watch this brother Bram says this and I'm I'm reading these because I want it to be very definitive and you must be born again brother Bram talks about all these things that people are being told you know uh in many different things but this is one point he goes on he says they're being told tonight you're a sinner tomorrow you're a manifested Son of God nonsense where you get that in the word babies are not born men they're born babies and grow to men that is a key that will actually defeat negativity you see we're not just saying think positive think positive it's you've got to un we are understanding who we are as Sons and Daughters of God being told who we are where we're at and the process we what we're going through if I'm crawling right now God ain't expecting me to run a race out here in this parking lot and shame on you if you want to challenge me to a race and I'm only crawling come on friends you know you run me off you run me back and forth well he just toddler hey you want a race we understand I know it's very simple and sometimes it seem but but it gets down to where we're at see God's working with every one of our Lives you know that's this is why that even within it the more that we mature that's right the more we have greater sympathy and understanding to pray for one another amen but see sometimes when we get to the we can get in those and we all pass through them we all pass through them so I'm not I'm not here condemning I'm just saying to understand where we're at and to understand where God's taking us cuz sometimes we can get into this I'm this shotgun I got up here first I called I'm riding shotgun with mom up here first and you're on the back no hey hey get over by the window hey hey quit bumping me and we're sitting in the middle hey quit bumping me quit touching me pray tell where they're supposed to go you know what I'm talking about don't you I mean pray tell me where you're supposed to go I mean there was a lot of times station wagons just in case for young people looking up station wagons were a thing you the mom and dad and whoever else sat in the middle row we didn't have these consoles down the middle that was also for p a person's body down the middle and then you had that second row ain't that right brother Aaron you had the second row and you know what the back was for to throw all the rest that won't fit in the other seats you have people's elbows faces feet and everything else in yours but you know what's funny as you grow a little bit you begin to realize it don't matter if I'm in the front seat seat or the back seat by the window got this window or I'm in the middle seat it don't even matter if I'm sitting in the trunk I'm just so happy to be going with Mama but you know that don't happen overnight so that what that deals God deals with our life he'll even correct us on our on on our thinking now in our thinking sometimes did we get it when we were that age we didn't sometimes we just thought Mom and Dad don't understand and man we were so wanting our way but after a while as we grow up and with the right right tutoring with the right tutoring where Mom and Dad would say that's not going to exist anymore that's the same way God does you and I God doesn't let us throw ourselves on the floor and pout and give a fit and kick a fit you know why cuz we'll be doing that later on down the road are you with me God is one who does not believe in spoiling the child he believe God knows his own word that foolishness is bound in the heart of the child and only the rod correction will drive that out that's why the the word of God comes to drive out foolishness out of our heart he's not there to condemn us he's to drive out of our life what's hindering us and hindering him from working in our lives you see if we're not careful when we get corrected or something comes our way now listen I'm not going to say that you're not a child of God but sometimes a person can get corrected and they get so offended while they're corrected and they'll leave and well I'm going to go to this church I'm going to go to this church look I'm happy as long as you want as you continue on with the Lord but sooner or later you're going to have to deal with that issue in your life and realize it's not everybody else's fault that there is things still in your life that even when correction comes it bothers you oh that's good that's so good come on friends that's good oh my all of a sudden my no we're not there all the way yet notice in the scripture Ephesians 4 speaking the truth in love not in harshness but speak the truth In Love sometimes that's where it's got to get down beneath all of the all of the stuff because it's all the stuff that's hindering us right thank God for that thank God for the truth being spoken in love how is that in love knowing that down beneath there that this right here that's not my brother that's not my sister that's not them there's a confidence on the inside there there is more of God to be made manifest Hall that's good listen let the devil come around like sand balot and like tobiah came around the walls when Nehemiah was building them and said there ain't nothing but a pile of rubbish here while these walls a fox could run right through them let the devil say what he wants but we are the redeemed of the Lord and God is building Sons and Daughters of God by his word we're not looking at the negative cuz the negative will never take us anywhere but the positive of his life and of his experience pulsating in our life it'll take what the world calls rubbish and bring out of it a son and daughter of God it'll take a dirty pile of laundry and when it's passed through justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost it can actually have the image of the king himself impressed upon it notice this last this phrase here everybody all right May grow up into him in all things so it didn't just overnight it's growing up in all things I many ever had those I had them them knee pains when you're growing yeah and I Remember Mama we lived in the country houses farm houses and man all of a sudden I just T night I just hauler out just start crying oh man crying crying crying and she'd bring up aspirin I'm so glad they put Coen on that stuff now she'd bring up asterin Mash that stuff down and put it in jelly you hope she got it all covered with jelly I'd have that you know she' give me that aspirin and then she'd take a massager that she had and start you know massaging my knees oh I just said I would crying and crying the pain and then and what was going on but you know what that is it was growing pains growing pains are not are not the pains are not rejoicing you know mama would always tell me you're growing Again Sam you're growing I wish I would stop growing in certain areas but she keeps telling me you're growing you're growing Samuel and I'm thinking I'm hurting right now this hurts I can't even think about tomorrow morning yeah that's good preacher I can't even think about the favorite pop tarts and I've got picked out for breakfast I can't think about that all I'm thinking about is the pain and sometimes what that you and I can look at is the the trials the test and what's going on but God is encouraging you and I and says yield my son yield my daughter you're growing that's good oh but grow in Grace not in unto but grow in Grace and in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ Our Savior our Lord Jesus Christ to him be glory now and forever brother BR says it like this he says when a man is converted let's just say like the little white button starts in his heart that part is God when he's born again with the spirit of God it's God's Spirit dwelling in him if he can let that Spirit grow and take out all the roots of bitterness and press God's way through him now God's not pressing from the outside in no God gets on the inside and a little white button like that right there that much when a man has been born again that much but the more that he can yield it'll push out now the whole key in growing is yielding but that yielding to it through all the correction through all the chastening through all the experiences sometimes it's the experiences that God allows us to come to in our own character development to where things to be rubbed out of our life things that maybe we've had to repent of over and over and over and finally it gets to a spot to where we recognize Lord I need to die in this area of my life I I need to die it gets to a place where we're no longer it's no longer an excuse it's no longer a something like such a thing cuz sometimes there's things that we brag on the negative boy I tell you what he or she will just tell it like it is and finally God will just allow situations to go and then if they're a real child of God born of the spirit of God I'll tell you what those things will come right around and God will work that thing out of their life but it will not be that God is doing it without their yielding they'll have to come finally to a place to realize this is not a brother this is not a sister this is not so and so this is not them that has done this or this or that or my boss or whatever more but God helped me to die in that area of my life and I'll tell you that takes a son and daughter of God stepping up with courage now watch how brother Ram will say this here he said God's desire is that he would dwell supremely to do our thinking our walking our talking then it's no longer the man it's God in the man notice he said eternal life is the light of God that dwells in the man and if he will yield to the SP Spirit more he becomes unman likee and becomes more Godlike notice the key yielding brother B goes on an uncertain sound that says talking about that button again when a man saved that much of him is God that's the little light that comes in to make you quit doing what's wrong and notice what it starts with it starts with things that are so obvious with with dealing with sin nature and then from there it works outwardly in the molding and shaping of our character he says now if you can take all the malice Envy strife and unbelief out that little button like of the light and power of God will keep growing growing growing growing crowding out unbelief that's and if you do it by you can't do it by exhortations of bodily exercise you do it by a Sanctified consecrated life that the holy spirit moves through you wow so let me just say this when God God listen everyone you are to have a personal experience with God and then with your experience with God we take encouragement from one another through testimonies through Fellowship but God God works on on you he works on me just as he did with that personal experience to where you pass from Death unto life friends that is the absolute necessity without that experience in your life it'll just be like you or me trying to put peacock feathers in a black bird it'll be like you and I trying to manufacture wool but when the spirit of God has come and our Nature has changed you say how do I know that my nature has been changed the love of the things of the world is gone and there is the love for God it's a love that's not just here it's a love that creates a real Fellowship a real relationship it creates such a reality that it stands out there like that mother deer did when that Little Fawn call was being made and she seen the hunter but she stepped out there with reality it produces reality and then from there there's a growing that takes place now notice cuz sometimes in the negative I'm trying I'm trying to get to I'm trying to get down here I only got a couple more parts to go here one more point but sometimes when we get to looking at on the negative we can just get focused on where we're at we can get focused on man if I if I had a not a bad day well why did you have a bad day yeah that's the key well I I I I I fell into this area why did you fall into that area see as a Son of God why did that happen if certain things were coming up and it felt like that it felt like you know the the thickness of whatever of lust or whatever was around you why were you feeling that in such a way you say well I'm still I'm still in this body but why is it that certain things were bothering in such a way that is where it certain things that was passing by your eyes certain things that was coming certain places where they ought not have been what what was it that has started that you see negative that can be around what is it that would cause a person here they come in from work and they come in from work and everything is wrong the kitchen the table is 5 centet to the right too far I mean you know the rice is not right today it's more orange than it is yellow where's the gandulas where's the pork you give me chicken everything yeah now you listen you wonder why is that because if that person is a son and daughter of God there's something that they realize I got to get out of this I got to get out of this I got to get the war that's right there that War I got to get out of this I got to I got to break this that's not right but what started that maybe it was from the workplace where there's a bunch of critical Spirits not people come on Friends don't be oh I'm tell you I can't I can't hang around them guys don't blame the guys come on if we if we when we come back to that place and been critical it wasn't because of the guys it's what we allow to come in because you're always going to be around negative but you and I it has to be God let it be in my life something that will neutralize that and if we feel ourselves getting negative like why in the world are they driving so slow why don't they hurt hurry up I mean it's 35 you can at least go 50 down through here you know what I'm talking about friends and sometimes those are the very things it hinders and the Holy Spirit is grieved and he P pulling back and that really is what bothers you and I as a son and daughter of God when we lose and we sense that we've grieved him in some way we've offended him in some way but that if we can receive it is part of the child training and we learn from that correction and that correction is where he pulls back his presence and we say Lord forgive me and then we realize when you go into work you may still have the same critical people around you don't have to walk around and shun them like they're the plague but be a son and daughter of God in every situation if you're not strong enough to do that ask God to make you give you the strength to be able to do that come on friends if you can't look at the trash online then get off of it if you can't look at Facebook and Instagram sometimes we got our face too much in those books so much in those things right there and there's why there's a weakness within our life and our walk with God and no wonder we're not any further along than we ought to be but you know what God works with our life and if we'll recognize it as we come around those situations soon as you get away you get in your car say Lord cleanse me Lord Lord if there's any piece of straw that a bird has carried into my mind I don't want that Nest maybe they started to put them mud around those straws and we we battle Birds on our porch them Birds must have been there from I don't know when I mean them little them little guys are about that big they'll have a nest in no time I've knocked them down in the morning and they've already gotten one built by 1 p.m. and I mean it's mud woven with straw sometimes we look and say oh just one piece of straw it can get built very quickly and there's things that we're responding in a certain way and the spirit of God is bringing us more and more to the realization you're a Son of God you're a daughter of God you have authority over unclean spirits yeah that's so good some of us we might be geared we're we're geared in certain ways and see God's not here to try to change the gears he's here to give us Grace to rule over those gears is that right I mean some of us you know it just ah it don't matter you know it's okay this or that it's all right others of us man you know if it's always this way it's this way it's this way it God has all variety but God works in our life and here's the point that I want to get to it's God leading you and I and sometimes the part with the negative that we're trapped around we get into looking at our feelings this is one of the things that even as a young Christian a young believer it will affect in their life they'll look many times at feelings and we still if we'll be honest as older Believers we battle against feelings sometimes the things that we've said that are negative is because based on our feelings right in instead of the word of God well you know and here comes in whisper I like well you're not getting anywhere you're not making any Improvement you're still dealing with things and and we listen to that listen God is not in the business of running his children down he's in the business of reminding you of who you are he's in the business of giving you strength even as he corrects us as he guides us to give us strength to rise above it and you know what when you start out I'm just I'm just speaking here from my heart as you start out and your walk with God sometimes you might want to see things and say well my I want to you know man I should be like this brother I should be like this sister no you shouldn't you should be whom God has made you and let me just tell you something these other brothers in here I could call a number by name or whatever more listen they didn't they didn't start out like like where they I mean they started out where you are now and where I am then then all of a sudden one day boom man and they're they're over here they don't start that way it's little by little by little this is why this is why even when you're seeking God for anything you if you're seeking God for the Holy Ghost start really getting in and reading your Bible listening to the message and praying and seeking after God press beyond your own feelings because the negative is what will try to hold you back when Caleb when Caleb and them were there the spies came back in the land all they could talk about was the negative it affected the whole Camp the whole house started to wail and weeping and Caleb stood up and stealed the people so wait a minute who brought us out of the pits wait a minute who was it that opened the Red Sea wait a minute who was it that gave us a word about a lamb being slain with blood spread placed on the lentils of the door poost and we walked out of there with the treasures of Egypt who was that that's brought us here amen he's beginning to rehearse the works of God I tell you right now there's times you need to if you need to get in the bathroom close the door and look in the mirror and say Where Were You When God got a hold of you what were you before God started dealing with your life you might say well they might think I'm a Nut you know who you're talking to encourage yourself in the Lord what God has done for you it'll change the negative to the positive you watch the holy spirit will come right into the room I am a daughter of God I am a Son of God the Holy Ghost belongs to me uh Deliverance belongs to me he's working on my character he's molding me he's shaping me this might be all broke up but I think pray God to put it together to make sense it's experiences sometimes in our lives that we come through it's experien say and those experiences we come through it makes us as we yield to him it makes us what we ought to be you love him so we want to continue to yield to him let me read one more scripture and I'm I'm I'm stopping here this is the key being led by the spirit Paul said here in Romans 8 verse 13 if you live after the flesh you shall die but if you through the spirit do mortify that means keep dead the Deeds of the body so you got a strength to put the Deeds of the body in line do you don't want to pet them well this has always been part of my family tree you're part of a different family tree now you're part of a different what good can come out of but your last name there my last name there a son and daughter of God that's the good thing that can come out of there right so notice if you through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body you shall live sometimes that is not just something with that is just overnight if to have the thought that I'm going to live in such a place that I'll never make a mistake brother Brown tells us he said don't ever get thinking that way this is why we need the blood of Jesus Christ we're here within the negative but we're pressing on there's things that is more I'm more sensitive to now than what I was even a year ago absolutely yeah there's things I'm more there's say and when I say more sensitive there's more of the awareness of this guy yeah that's right that's what I'm talking about the awareness of this guy that's my hindrance there's more because you know what happens the word has a way of exposing in our lives and it's calling us higher and this is the real key friends you can take this to the bank and cash in for if you live after the flesh you shall die but if you through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body you shall live this is the one for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God and verse 16 the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God that's so see it's being led when the spirit of God comes to speaks to our hearts and deals with our life can we be led say yes Lord be it unto me be it unto me Lord to be led by him you see because we've never passed this way before when God told Israel coming into the land stay behind the ark the ark is the word because you've never passed this way before you're a new creation behold all things old things are passed away and all things have become new right brother Bram says this he says every time you move out a little unbelief God steps right in and takes over the scripture for this everywhere The Souls of your feet are set that I give you to move out of little unbelief H H how do we know to move out of un little unbelief did Israel decide what city they were going to take in the order they were going to take it they didn't that's right God said Jericho then it was AI God gave them Jericho they so they could see when it comes to AI don't take your own intelligence don't take artificial intelligence take the mind of Christ working in you is that right notice but notice it didn't decide that it was it was step by step of the way right they didn't take all the land at once that's how listen the promised land that's how it is in your life how it is in my life from the negative to the the positive it's little by little by little see just even how simple it started in your life my life your walk with the with God my walk with God it starts with what repentance starts with that going into water baptism God begins to God is sanctifying the life and God deposits the gift of the Holy Ghost in your life it's walking on with him and you don't start walking from that birth it's a growing BR says there you are you're pressing out from that little button is taking over the fibers of you spreading out God working through you in you and around you I I know today and I'm not trying to make fun of anybody but I know today I'm so thankful all of a sudden they started offering you a little bit more dress shirts and all of a sudden they got to these things slim fits modern fits now if you like them I'm not against them I know some of young boys they like all that I I I just I I don't like all that to me that kind of stuff when when we were you know you wear your pants so they can see your your your socks I'm I'm okay with that I'm I'm not condemning nobody you understand I'm just trying to make a point here when when I was growing up and your pants were too tight they need to be boxed up and given to somebody else and they were too short you know or your pant or you know you you had your shirts and they were they were so tied on you you know you boxed them up and gave them to somebody else or or hand them down to somebody but you see now with the spirit of God when it grows in our life man it if there's sometimes it feels good when there's things you start breaking out of you know it's like you know when you're things are St moving you realize man it's it's it's growing in my life and you know when you see God growing in your life it's not just in the exploits god listen God gives signs and wonders and miracles God will do things through your life God will do wonderful little things and I don't want to say little just to say little but you know why he does that to encourage you but the real growth the real growth is when you as you can see him in your life and you can begin to recognize your littleness and his greatness you can begin to see certain things in your life and say Lord I want to rule over that in my life Lord you begin to because soon as you identify and you and I can't identify it brother Aon if it w for the word we couldn't identify it but the word helps us to identify it and as we will yield to the word the more we become unman likee and more Godlike and God gives us Grace to reign in that are life from negative to positive you love him we'll just stop there let's stand oh my thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord oh my growing I want to keep growing don't you I want to keep growing Lord I want to be more if you play that song Lord I want to be more like you maybe this morning as we would pray God knows each of our needs God's know go knows each of Our Lives listen friends no matter where where we're at here this morning what we all have need need of is more of him that's not a cliche that's just not a statement that is made but we all need more of him we're all growing there's lives here that need no doubt among us some that might stream or archive that in need of a a real true experience with God but don't let Satan point that put that experience something somewhere out there it's it's right it's right there by you you say how is it right there by me brother B said' when you begin to hunger and thirst for the Holy Ghost he quotes that scripture blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness for you shall be filled he said that's the spirit of God on your life wanting to fill your life say brother Samuel what what do I do just invite him just invite him say Lord all of my thoughts all that I have Lord I surrender to [Music] you the negative if you just focus on him who is the positive he'll give you the grace to be delivered of that negative birth and then and then in our lives as we're walking with him we come through we come into different times in our lives my I remember when God first got a hold of my life you can too man it was just wonderful it's actually more wonderful now but then it's tests trials different things that came things that we had to learn mistakes sometimes God would let us let us fall right on our face to bring us to a place to help us to realize we need him I want you to think of this God's not a cookie cutter God when God moves down into our lives by the spirit of God he moves down some might be more strong willed than others others might have more of a of a gentle nature but that's we're that's not we talking about we're talking about something deeper when the Holy Ghost has come in and then the Holy Spirit begins to move in that life that person that might be a gentle nature the spirit of God would have to work in their life to where that they don't come into a place of just being pushed around a little bit accepting certain things not that they become arrogant but God has to work and build in their life to that place and then God will have to work on somebody else who's maybe more strong natured to be a little bit more to be tender to be sensitive to be yielded to know when to say something and when not to say something see God's working on all of us and Friends the spirit of God that Spirit of adoption the scripture said it leads us to full adoption I say God Have Your Way in our lives Lord have your way in our lives move through US Lord God let the spirit of God just so flow through our lives may may have even as we are embarking and looking upon this new year coming in I pray May Our Lives be so Changed by the glory of God May there be lives that are so completely yielded coming into the new birth say Lord God I want to yield myself Lord God I want to yield my thoughts I want to yield Lord all of my being Lord I want you to have everything Lord [Music] God oh my let's just go to him in prayer [Music] Heavenly [Music] Father Lord we're standing as a needy

invite you Lord maybe things Lord they've struggled with Lord of different pressures and things in their life and none of it leaves leaves them happy at all may they just simply invite you in every area of their life say Lord I want you to be over every bit of fashion all the what I dress the wear I want you to be over it all Lord go through my closet Lord because Lord as you would go through

in the house of God just simple things Lord God but father we need you Lord You're the strength of our life for Lord I'm sure that when we could search back down through our lives and we can see as you were guiding us through just some moments ago why is it that we were bothered with certain things why is it if it was something that bothered us of criticalness or something that showed up why is that it's not because of a person but Lord if we can really look back down through it can be something Lord there of a trap something we've come into Lord maybe we haven't been giving ourselves to you the way that we should that where we've built up a resistance to where those things can't stick help us Lord help us father I pray oh God cleanse us Lord make us more like you father Grant it Lord I

things that you've spoke to us personally may we Lord take just meditating just dwelling upon that Lord and dear God help us to yield Lord sometimes Lord things and terms that they're very simple terms but sometimes they can become so vague they can become so abstract but Lord simple yielding it even starts Lord God with prayer simple yielding taking Lord and going through Lord God a chapter listening Lord maybe to a portion of a message on the way to [Music] work maybe listen to a little bit more of the next day and the next day simple yielding that's that's simp simple yielding and allowing you to have the right away Lord it says so much like of a person who would come on a shift before they would ever step by the machine or go into their office first thing they'll go is in maybe into the kitchen cafeteria they make themselves a cup of coffee they become known by they've got to have their coffee before their day starts Lord help us Lord help us Lord that we can just even see of sometimes the things that would seem so vague and we can look and say well yielding yielding but Lord God you intend for us to be able to see that even in our own lives it takes Lord just of the simplest of things and just to invite you Lord just in daily devotion it allows you to move to work in our lives it's a yielding and that yielding oh God it starts an effect throughout that whole day help us Lord as we're driving Lord God on the way to the job help us Lord of a morning say Lord help me Lord God be the Lord of my of my life in this day Lord guide me you know what Lord is ahead

reminders on our phone Lord God let it be like reminders that'll drop down lord from the presence of God as we begin to think on you Lord yielding yielding Lord God no doubt sitting right here this morning we've yielded to be able to stand right here and set in the house of God no doubt Lord God where our flesh Lord has told us you're not going to be able to sit there why why do you just why don't you just sit home and stream just set home in the comfort of your chair but there's something Lord God that it was not a feeling but Lord there's a yielding to the word of God that says forsake not to assemble yourselves together is the manner of some is simple yielding obedience to the word of God Lord God you don't intend your word to be something that is vague or abstract but God it's simple it's simple it's simple obedience to the the word of God and then Lord God you speak to us oh Lord Jesus help us Lord help us we want to grow [Music] Lord grant it Lord father May that button
