tonight amen through it all you know we look around here in the congregation all different ages and different walks of life but yet the testimony to me I look at and take comfort and strength even from those that are much older been walking in the way but the testimony is through it all through it all it certainly isn't any any great stock in our genes there's a greater gene it's a greater gene that was down on the inside and God come and he found that gene amen and then that gene is really what found us that's what really unlocked who we really were we were stumbling around wondering and trying to fit in here trying but God came along and then there was a match that was made and then you realize when that match is made hey wait a minute I'm not the son of I could say James and Pat Brown I'm the son of God there's been a blood tie in that now I realize all all this is this is who I really am ain't it wonderful so wonderful so good to be here tonight and I think the musicians may God bless you I won't be singing anymore if we could let's turn in the Bible to Exodus 25 will read for one scripture here and then we'll let you be seated and to see how the Lord just just takes us here tonight in Exodus 20:5 verse verse 31 maybe we'll pray they're getting ready to import that back there so let's just have a word of Prayer Heavenly Father Lord Jesus how thankful we are Lord for your mercy and your grace Lord this day in father's so thankful Lord for their God your light that is shined Lord into our hearts Lord o God how we're thankful that not only it's shined into our hearts but there was something there to receive it Lord and and to be able to reflect that gospel that has been shined into our lives Lord this is our desire Lord is just to reflect you Lord father we pray that tonight that you'll just come Lord be the speaker here Lord and hear through us tonight as well Lord may you come and just take your word you know our needs you know questions upon hearts and father we just ask that just to be in your hands that you can speak lip to ear Lord to us tonight Lord we desire just to get out of the way and father even from the toils and and the cares of this life and this day we know that Lord that our life is in your hands we're trusting in you Lord so father as we Lord would not even try to take thought of tomorrow because as you have spoke to us Lord and our rest to say that tomorrow will take care of itself may we rest Lord God in you and as you would come and speak to our hearts tonight and minister to every need Lord spiritually and physically we pray we give you all the praise honor glory and they know Jesus Christ amen amen in Exodus 20:5 we'll read one verse of scripture and then I'm ones gonna let you be seated here here says and thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold of beaten work shall the candlestick be made his shaft and his branches his balls his knobs and his flowers shall be of the same may God bless you as you're being seated I want to speak to you here on a thought tonight we been looking at for some time and tests and trials and you know sometimes there's things that you get well you you just you just follow the Lord and you don't know everything of what is all going to come out but we're always we're in a journey and God knows exactly what we what we have need of and many of these things that when I look at it and when I look over this this part of the word and looked at it here for many weeks months and just something just began to really just further stand out to my heart and I want to just take a thought on a beaten work to display light a beaten work to display light when we look at this you know we we won't get to this tonight but brother Branham likens this he takes this very part of this candlestick and he likens it to not only the the suffering of the Lord Jesus but how that we know as we looked at this a past couple of weeks on the dead of love oh I oh and how that Paul said that I might fill up the sufferings that are left behind of Christ for his body sake and we know that the suffering itself it's something that I believe that the grace of God has lifted us to a place and he will continue to lift us to a place sometimes in the midst of a trial we are we are so focused on ourselves within the midst of it and that is something that then how God will by His grace allow us to be able to come to a place to be able to look beyond ourselves and I'll tell you this right here I need prayer in that we we all need prayer in that I read where Paul says our glory in my infirmities I've Lord I say lord help me get to that place you know because Paul said the reason he said in doing that that the power of Christ the tent might rest upon my life so we realized that the very first thing we will look at and many times as we'll look within ourselves but yet we know that every test and trial that comes our way that it's already ordained by God and God is overseeing every bit of it to see that the molding and then the out working of our life that it's his life that he wants to display and really if it wasn't for the test or trial we we would not be able to truly be able to display the grace of God and even to the manner of what God desires to bring forth out of our life so I'm thankful that God helps us to be able to come into that place to where that you'll allow things to come our way to where that you and I can come to that place and say Lord I'm just trusting you as this I I don't know how to I'm trying to see a way out of this and I don't see a way out of it I don't see any exit door out of this so I'm just gonna put my eyes on you and I'm just gonna trust you to take me through this because we know that everything God does is perfect and he's May he's working all things for his good for our good and and when we look at this here in the scriptures when we look at it it says coming back to this verse it says thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold of beaten works shall the candlestick be made his shaft his branches his bowls his knobs and his flowers shall be of the same what we would see even within it that it is a beaten war of this was not something that could be brought out of Egypt there was nothing like this that could have been brought out of Egypt God was not going to use something that was already construct and fashioned upon the earth but God was going to take elements of things that he had placed here in the earth and God was going to use those elements when they would be formed and shaped that it would actually reflect his glory of something that would be even much greater when he by his own life would be able to come into a body of believers and begin to reflect his own life I want you to notice that within here in the scriptures as we look as we're reading it it speaks first of all of a candlestick of pure gold then it speaks of this candlestick it doesn't speak in plurality but it speaks in singular that this candlestick and then out of this candlestick it is his branches it's his knobs all of this is about him and then as we go on down through the scriptures if I can just continue to read it says and six branches shall come out of the sides of it three branches of the candlestick out of the one side and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side three bowls made like unto almonds with an OP and a flower in one branch and three bowls made like almonds in the other branch with an OP and a flower so in the six branches that come out of the candlestick so what we're seeing is is this candlestick that how that this candlestick is to be made out of pure gold but out of the candlestick is to come six branches they will be his branches these flowers which would be that of the almond flowers which would speak it's the almond itself is the very the flower itself is the very first flower that will come forth after winter after the darkness is passed that where that almond itself it will speak of that life it will speak of firstfruits and so when we we look into it it says the candlestick shall be a ford bowls made like unto almonds with her not with their knobs and their flowers there shall be a knob under two branches of the same and enough under two branches of the same and an OP under two branches of the same according to the six branches that proceed out of the candlestick their knobs and their branches shall be of the same all it shall be one beaten work of pure gold and thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof and they shall light the lamps thereof that they may give a light over against it so these these lights the lamps themselves when they were to be lit they would cast their light over to highlight the candlestick itself but within this when you begin to look at this is truly you know when we see these things it's truly a masterpiece of divine inspiration this is something that as we said that this was not what they carried out of Egypt they carried gold they carried precious things out of Egypt but they did not carry any of these things that would be used within the tabernacle or even that of anything that would be replicated like it but remember within it this inspiration that we're reading from right here in Exodus 20:5 is where Moses himself was called by God to come up into the mountain and he was called to come up unto the Lord into the mountain he was going to receive the tablets of the Lord and to receive from God and as he's up there of division begins to break forth and we see that this vision it all the way through the Bible the Bible itself is the great book of redemption all the way through it shows and depicts Redemption and how that you know even from the very beginning and then down into here how that God Himself is by this inspiration he's making known to to Moses within it that this is this is a pattern these are things that I want you to see here and I want you then to coming back down to earth to bring that vision back down to earth I want you to think about this maybe you hadn't thought about this but I look at all of the detail that was given here that was given to Moses and you know when Moses comes down this time how that everything where the people had already started to sin and they had made a golden calf and you recognized that there were men in the camp who were skilled to be able to craft things and make things but they were still under the inspiration of Egypt they had not come under this inspiration because you see in order to come under this inspiration it would have to be then a word that would be given and that word would be spoken if I can say it over this generation and then the anointing of God could begin to fall that what God had spoken there in the heavens would actually become manifest in the earth that's always God's pattern it's an inspiration we we can't take the Word of God and begin to make or form from a previous inspiration but it's got to be by the fresh inspiration that God gives in this hour and this season it it's not a different inspiration it's the same inspiration that was poured out on the day of Pentecost it's the same Holy Ghost as a matter of fact the scripture lays that out for us in the book of Revelation it's the seven spirits of God God don't have seven spirits but it is the same Holy Spirit coming forth seven times through seven ages it's the same God coming down and performing what was in the heavenlies is now to be manifest in earth it's not an earthly pattern that God is pulling this from but it's a heavenly pattern and to see that how that this was stated here I wish I would have given a picture here tonight within this because maybe not all have seen it I think I've got things on that computer back there but to see how that this this lamp this candlestick and you find it all the way through the scriptures here over and over where God will call it the candlestick and his lamps he'll refer to it over and over because you cannot form the branches first it's got to be the candlestick is form first and then out of the candlestick will come the branches how does that will come the knobs out of that will come to flowers showing that the that which is truly of that heavenly origin it must come forth from Jesus Christ so when we look at this we we find that how that it's the branches that come out of the candlestick he wasn't seven branches but it's six branches and remember it was six measures of flower that that Boaz gave Ruth it's church ages of how that God would manifest himself in the seven church age as he would give that of the six branches coming out and you know I think the things of how brother vine will say when he opened the six seals and you see that seven seal was on earth and the six seals were taken off it was Christ who was here them the mighty God who came down among us the same Living God to reveal himself what was not an earthly pattern but a heavenly pattern and when I look at this I I look back in these things and you see of how that these branches were to come out of his side and and I look at how that when when these branches the scriptures are clear that when he himself was offered up his side was hoping when his side was open what was released was the elements to make up his church so it had to be with the candlestick and then the branches that wood would come out of there but this candlestick was not something that was just just just laying here in the earth but we recognize that the scripture could say of how that it was Adam who was first formed and then he was formed to recognize that here God had had him upon the earth but when he put Adam to sleep he opened up the side of Adam and he brought out of that that rib and then God began to multiply and then that same life that was there with an Adam God was able to to subdivide that in place that same life that was original right there inside of Adam's bride she was given to him for the purpose that he might reproduce himself our intention was never God's never intended for Christianity to be a reproduction or an impersonation of another man but the God's only desire is that his life would be reproduced within his children he never wanted us to be a bunch of carbon copies god never wanted us to act like one another get God himself desired and it all through and by his predestinated plan is that you and I would be conformed we would be fashioned we would be shaped unto the very image of his son it's God's desire it's God's work it's God's achieving them let me just tell you where you're at tonight it's not your achievement it's not your working but it is his achievement through our submission even for us to submit it takes his grace to move on the scene and begin to condition us to where we are at rest to allow him to have his way and I think of this of how that when we look at it that the candlestick itself being that of the focus and how that the Bible would go on in numbers eight four it would refer back to this again and say this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold unto the shaft thereof under the flowers thereof was beaten war this was not something that could be pieced together this was not of a puzzle that would be put together you could not make that of of the branches and then attach the branches no sir the branches must be born out of a candlestick the branches must come out of there this is not an assembly of parts like a factory where you have a candlestick coming down and then you have branches here and we're assembling branches no the Bible is very clear when God gave - even from this to the cherubims but as we focus on this tonight God let it be known it's to be a pure gold of one Beaton work this is not to be divided into all these little parts where everything is so segregated no sir it shows that the baptism of the Holy Ghost as it moves down upon the believer it brings you an eye into that same body where you and I are made partakers of that same life but fell there in the very beginning you and I are partakers and a part of that body that God Himself has been building down through seven ages we are a part of that body we are not separate from that body but we are a part of it and they'd live their part they live their message they submitted to that and you and I the scripture says that their God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect hallelujah so when we see this it's a beaten work a beaten work it was not this this gold think about this gold this gold that came out of Egypt it was already gold you know the gold itself had been taken and mined from the earth but the gold it still was something that it was not in the form that it needed to be in that gold still had to be melted down member when Aaron he told him you know Aaron he told him take your earrings off man you know place them here and and how that you know they melted down the earrings of gold and then they begin to they form that golden that golden calf you're gonna really see that it still had to be melted down and we looked at within this gold of how that this gold was set forth you know and you think about how that God Himself coming down and becoming one of us God came down all my may we never get tired of this because this is our Redemption store that God Himself came down and he could have taken something of a great splendor the Bible says he took a form of a servant he made himself of no reputation let me tell you something tonight you and I didn't have a choice through the way that you and I came into this world we didn't have a choice with weaknesses that would be about us we did have that choice matter of fact as we go on in life sometimes weaknesses themselves make themselves known and they begin to stand out the more that God has the right away in our life the more weaknesses stand out in our life I want you to think about this he who was rich became poor the Bible said he was the Calvary not in power in weakness he was crucified you see he can't chose to come down and take a body the Bible said it behooves him to be made like unto his brethren he came down and lived in a body and that body itself though it was virgin born but remember it aged it could get sick he could feel temptation he could feel all of the pressures that you and I feel and he did feel them he did experience frustration come on now all of these things what was this God so subjected himself to be able to so that you and I could look and see my the way that same life what he has done that same God can manifest that same life through me how hard would it have been if you'd have looked at somebody who didn't have no faults he didn't want no fault in him listen to me now but how would it have been if there was one they never experienced what it was like to be sick didn't know what it was like to be tempted didn't know what it was like to have war and contend with himself come on somebody then how could he look at you and say be of good cheer for I've overcome you could say overcome what did you overcome you had no battles but God himself so came down and become one of us it behooves him to be made like unto his brethren oh ma look at this in John 15 the Bible says I am The True Vine and my father is the husbandman he's that True Vine there was not a true vine upon the earth but here the very root of the vine how that God Himself had already prophesied I'm gonna plant a vine and here is declaring I am that true vine you know what he's saying I am that candlestick and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth NOT fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit now you are clean through the word which I've spoken unto you abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me who's speaking here the candlestick you are the branches I am the vine except you invited me you cannot bear any fruit I am the vine verse 5 ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing out of that candlestick came these six branches out of a vine comes the branches because the vine itself is the source of life the branches are not the source of life the branches themselves are only channels whereby that the very life of the vine might manifest itself through and this is what God he requires he desires for every life for every one of us is just to be a channel just to be a branch that his life can flow through i'm the vine ye are the branches out so he's already he's letting it be known here I am that candlestick now think of this here in verse six he says if Europe man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned so if a man doesn't abide in him a man can a person can come can come around him but in order to abide in him you have to be born in him you can come around him and experience much of the of the life the life working the life conditioning but you must be born in him in order to abide in him if you abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you think of this my worms he he's not just talking about letters or for just words that are just wrote out but he's speaking of this word is is Rhema which is that word that God himself has spoken personally to your heart if ye abide in me and what my words that which I have spoken to you might say well that that came to me with you were ministering her but this brother was minister but it wasn't me it wasn't the minister come on friends it was God speaking personally to you God has instruments God has channels but the instrument and the channel is just that no more the glory itself belongs to God oh my if ye abide in me and my words abide in you you should I'll ask what you will and it shall be done unto you herein is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples don't you want to bear fruit don't you want to reflect him the Rebbe says it like this in the Patmos vision he goes into this he says he is the main vine that which comes out of the original root from the original seed that has the life in it now that vine does not bear fruit it is the branches that do that amen the vine doesn't but the branches do it if all you have is a vine divine can't bear fruit of itself but it must have branches amen they says you can take a citrus tree and we're familiar with this such as an orange tree and graft into a grapefruit limb a lemon limb a tangelo limb and other kinds of that variety and all those limbs will grow but those grafted limbs will not bear oranges no sir the lemon the lemon limb will bear lemons and the grapefruit limb will bear grapefruit and so on yet those limbs will be thriving off the life in the tree so the branches themselves that if the vine is an orange tree but it is of the citrus variety it can be grafted into the vine but yet it will never bear the true image of the vine it will give evidence that there is life flowing there remember as brother M tells us here what a person could say well I know I've been born of the Holy Ghost because I speak in tongues program says that is an evidence of the Holy Ghost being there but it's not an evidence that you've been born again they're right it's it's not the evidence of the new birth the evidence of the new birth is to bear the fruit of the vine it's to bear his image Oh glory this was his desire he couldn't just demand this of you and I because you and I could not produce this we could not produce this life you say well what we a seed of God we were we are seeds of God but we could not produce this life you and I were in a situation we could not help ourselves or get ourselves out of we needed one to come down from glory who was greater than ourselves we needed the true vine because all of these other trees that we were born other we born of this tree we reflected this tree we reflected all these things all of these strains and everything from the natural tree but there was by virtue of predestination there was a seed of God when you drop from your mama's womb when you took that breath of life there was a seed that in her right there it was ordained to inhabit that body and here God in himself coming down and made a way that you and I might come in to this tree of life but remember before you ever get branches you got to get the candlestick you don't make the branches first God never made the church first and then now who we the Savior the Redeemer comes no it's the lamb first it's the candlestick first it's him first in everything in our life it's him first everything in our life it's not let's get our life in order we'll get this together we'll get this together and then we'll really consecrate to God wrong order bill order is the candlestick first and then all the branches that so come out of your life everything that God has intended for you to do if you'll just submit to him put him first then you'll watch how God will blossom the testimony out of your life you won't have to struggle to be an overcomer if you only let the candlestick be the first and foremost part of your life but if you don't let the candlestick Christ the vine be the center most part of your life you'll struggle to bring forth fruit because you're trying to do it but remember it has to be the divine energy of Christ Himself the true vine moving through branches that are born in him Omaha let's go on and read this he said if that true true that that tree ever puts forth another branch of itself it will be an orange branch and bear launches because the life in the limb and the life in the trunk are identical whereas it wasn't so with the grafted limbs those grafted branches had their sources in other kinds of life from other trees from other roots from other seeds oh they bear fruit all right but they won't bear oranges they cannot because they are not of the original and Brisbane goes through in that next paragraph and he talks about how that's the way the church is the vine has been split and limbs have been grafted in and he talks about the denominational seeds but in the next paragraph he says if the vine ever brings forth another branch of itself and we know this statement is so common to us around the message but do you see that it has to be the vine bring forth another branch brother sister this ain't something in the future I'm looking at that branch tonight I'm looking at a part of that branch that the vine himself has put forth this has not been a branch that's been formed by man it's not been a branch that's been birthed by the head this is a branch that has been birthed by the Word of God in this hour the Spirit of God has moved down and through that word has brought forth that branch that was already here but it brought it forth and birthed it if the vine ever brings forth another branch of itself that branch will be exactly like the vine itself exactly it'll be able to take all the life in it this this vine doesn't have to cut corners this branch doesn't is not something that singled out but the branch itself is able to fully manifest and say amen to every promise of God it's able to say amen to the word when the word comes by and even though we can look at our lives and say I don't see that yet but I want see that Lord in me we can say amen to the word what are we saying so be it in my life we are putting ourselves as branches we are identifying ourselves to the vine with provide I am a branch of the vine the vine that is speaking behind that is declaring itself I am a branch of that time oh my it will be the same kind of a branch that was brought forth at Pentecost hallelujah it will speak in tongues you know prophesy it'll have the power and signs of the resurrected Jesus Christ in it you agree with that and this will also bring that forth the same power there was a Pentecost it's also able to stand tests and trials if they can't stand tests and trials it's not the same branch come friends it was in every day in the book of Acts if there was a miracle taking place no sir as a matter of fact you even read where you speak of how that here they were when Peter was in prison the whole church is gathered around praying and then here you know when the little damsel comes to the door and she begins to answer the door she closes the door and goes tells arrest him and praying and the rest of them said you've got to be crazy it ain't Peter out there it's his angel what were you praying for it showed their humanity their humanity was still there they were praying they were believing God but it showed that there was something greater than just their abilities or their focus but there was a part within them that God had been able to so contact and they moving in that path klog desired to spare Peters life drug desired to show and manifest himself and here it all comes together for his glory and yet God still allows their humanity to be shown don't raise your hands but how many of you and God's answered a prayer that you've had it you can't believe it why huh lord have mercy let me go over and look at it again oh dear God I just and believe it why you're still human but God takes the weakness of our humanity to display his greatness you see his beating his shaping his molding was not of the same manner that our our beating and molding and shaping comes our beating and molding and shaping comes because there's a lot of volcanic ash that's packed into us there's a lot of things we've as brother brems says accumulated over the time he says in another place how can I overcome a lot of dirt is packed into us packed into you they didn't mean that it was just scattered there's a lot of dirt that was packed into you there's a lot of things that have been packed into our life hurts and everything else come on now that we didn't ask to be packed into us it's kind of like Mama's sending you out you know on a 60-degree day and she feels like it's ice freezing it's freezing out there you need to bundle up and you go out there your lord have mercy it's burning up oh why is all of this sock hat and everything else on me God knows exactly what he's doing and notice how brother Brent brings us down he says because it's thriving on the natural resources of the vine itself you see it wasn't grafted into the vine it was born in the vine it's not something that was added to it but it's of one beaten work it's a one solid piece oh my oh my Bladon going down there brother Brian a couple paragraphs he says notice he says if they had been born of it that same life that was in the original stem Jesus would come through them and manifest through them verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because I go unto my father now look this display the display of these branches that are born out of the vine already astir ordained that the life of a vine might express itself let's go over to zechariah chapter 4 here i'm just trying to just follow him here zechariah here Zechariah 4:1 and the angel the bible says the angel that talked with me came again and he waked me as a man that is wakened out of his sleep and he said unto me what see us now and i said i have looked and behold a candlestick all of gold not candlesticks a candle stick of gold with a bowl upon the top of them you can't put the oil down here in the bottom you put the oil that comes from on high the oil gets poured down and his seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are up on the top thereof and two olive trees by one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side thereof so I answered and I spake to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be I said no my lord then he answered and he spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts who art Thou O great mountain before zerubabbel thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying grace grace unto it we know that scriptures have compound meanings is that right we recognize that these two trees that are standing by Old Testament and New Testament and yet at the latter part of this scripture you know it's fixed these two are anointed of the Lord and brother you play some also has those two witnesses that are going to come there in in among Israel and call out that 144,000 and you look at how that it's so closely identified here in Zechariah 4 this is a vision of God's Redemption it speaks of how that God himself coming down and then through the imparting of his life God is going to take a people for his namesake and through that same life God Himself will move right over and upon that Moses and Elijah he will call out 144,000 out of that out of the nation of Israel and they will call them out by the same gospel message and they will be baptized with the same Holy Ghost it's all part of it you see he paid the price for all is that right he came down and he paid the price for all but in paying the price for all remember his whole purpose in coming was to redeem the elect but he paid the price and there are others who can be saved and and they can no salvation but God is so separated to where there's a depth of redemption and that is reserved for the elect alone I think God for salvation amen I think God for souls even though they may not see the light that we see but you know you never know that you just have to let it you just have to let God Himself work because let me tell you something friends just because somebody comes to a message church and said they believe brother branham's a prophet and everything else doesn't mean they're walking in the light either you see it's got to walk fully by life that's fully dedicated to the Lord it takes a life that's fully been born of the vine and where it is the very life of Christ that's being reflected through their life this is not about Association here is not enough to be associated around this message you've got to be born out the Holy Ghost it's got to be a branch that comes out of the candlestick it's gotta be a a fresh experience it's gonna be a new birth it takes the work of the Holy Ghost coming down and this whole work is a beaten work it takes God coming down and God moving and separating all the dirt and the sludge and all the gum and all the yuck and all the malice and everything else from around our life why be why is he doing that because he knows beneath the dirt and beneath the sludge beneath all that there's gold there and he's pulling that gold out of the earth he knows that gold that leaves in her life and he's working he's shaping he's molding for what purpose a beaten work to display light to display light oh my brother branham he says it like this he says that what God was telling Zachariah here when he said not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of Hosts now by might not by power you know God brings you and I into places in our lives where we get to test our might we can test our power and God lets us test the might lets us test our power and we realize we can't do nothing but I'm a branch but without me you can do nothing now I really have a good understanding about power you see power isn't just something supernatural sometimes it can be by knowledge power it's not by power not by might but by his Spirit is God declaring right here when Zachariah is asking him the angel said what is this and Zacharias said I don't know what it is you tell me what it is because as a prophet I can see cymbals but I need somebody to interpret it for me is that right and I need to know what is this this is what you're showing me he shows him this candlestick now you and I we could look at this candlestick and say well that's just something to give life why would God show this and why would God declare that this candlestick this candelabra the candlestick with the six branches there the seven lamps why would God say that because the church would be living of the power of God the Spirit of God not by might not by power every age every age there has been those who have just regarded their might and the power intellectually to try to produce and live out but you cannot produce it listen friends the producing of this message is not knowing every quote you can know every single letter that doesn't mean anything to God you can know he said this here and set that there there's things are no doubt than many of us here I could quote it the way brother Ram quotes it I could say it the way says it with the Paul's just from listening to the tapes many times and poring over things but that is not what it is it must be that life living and pulsating on the inside and the greatest desire that we would have as branches is God let me lose my identity that the identity of the vine might be made manifest in me he didn't even have her own name when she came out of that and the Bible said that he called their name Adam in the day they were formed they men she had cheated off her identity was hidden within Adam and that's the same way but for the bride of Jesus Christ our identity is hidden in him our identity is not in a church I'm gonna say it it's not enough just to be identified around this message you've got to be identified with Jesus Christ that is the real revelation of this message is Jesus Christ [Applause] hallelujah there were many listen I I quoted this to your month ago there are people yet in the world tonight who still hang right around the River Jordan they've never moved from the River Jordan not just spiritually there's people who hang right around that River and you ask who are they they say we're followers of John you know if they miss they miss Christ there's people who can follow brother random and they miss Christ they don't recognize Jesus Christ they want to take the natural voice of a man and make that the voice of God that natural voice is not the voice of God the voice of God spoke through that earthly voice to you and I they men the voice of Jesus Christ that spoke through that earthly messenger to you and I if we can't recognize that then we can't recognize called still speaking but he still speaking that voice is still speaking that same Holy Ghost is here tonight still speaking that same word that has been broke upon this generation let me tell you something when the anointing falls it will not produce another golden calf trying to take us back to an Old Testament form a priesthood but when the real inspiration drops it brings us into the real priesthood of our milk asset if the Lord Jesus Christ where we find our true identity glory be to God in the highest hallelujah we are branches to bear images of Christ notice how John says this here in John in Revelations 1 verse 9 let me just try to get somewhere here here you find in Revelations 1 verse 9 my John let's you know he said I'm your brother I'm your companion in tribulation but he don't focus on the tribulation look what happens to John he knows why he's there it's not a comfortable position it's not a comfortable place where he's at but he only lets you know I am your brother and fellow companion in tribulation but even in this we see of how that the revelations so breaking around John's life you don't ever read anything else in the Book of Revelations where John himself would mention about his tribulation say lord help me I'm raising my hand for all of them Lord all that because sometimes we can't even make it in the whole chapter we're ending one chapter my tribulation John took one verse out of 22 chapters we take 22 chapters in one verse we glory but I believe God's bringing us there I believe that with all my heart he is bringing us there he's teaching us friends these things are not something it's just handed to you but God Himself is working in our life you know the whole thing of it is the whole secret of it is he's teaching us to trust him that's the whole thing oh brother Samuel that's easy really is it isn't it that's his whole working that's what he's been working even since he called you since he sanctified you since you field since he filled you with the Holy Ghost he's still working on you to trust him completely but don't worry Abraham we're headed to our final mountain he's bringing us there amen he's faithful here here John he turns around and you notice to see how that God bringing this lie to you and I because there's got to be a way to bring this life to us let me just bring it down here like this tonight there had to be a way now when we look at this as we look at this candlestick it had to be that of a work that was formed that was shaped there had to be a way that was made in order to bring this forth so it had to be God Himself coming down his only life being given for you and I the scripture says it like this in verse 13 of Revelations 1 that when John had turned to see the voice that was speaking unto him how long how brother brems rawls this here he says John did not turn around to see it didn't say I turned to see who he said I turned to see the voice you see he did not john identified the voice that was speaking to him the voice that was speaking to him had something for him so when he turned to see the voice and the voice that spake to me what he beheld was Jesus Christ what he beheld was the word well we could preach here a long time you see how God lets you know where you belong he speaks to you and feed you so you don't have to wonder where you belong you understand me now then you know God need we understand we have all of these parts about you pray over what church you're gonna go through absolutely you look for those things you pray over that you absolutely should and God has a way of making things known I believe that has to be God that has to be God amen it can't be a man verse 13 here and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of Man clothed with a garment down to the foot and girl about the paps with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as where's the flame of fire and his feet like unto fine brass as if they had burned in a furnace and his voice is the sound of many waters in order for this work to come forth he had to come down and he had to pay the price he had to tread the winepress the Bible says in Isaiah 63 alone his garments dyed red when he tread the winepress it was him and him alone there was nothing there to help him as a matter of fact the prophet said within that time even the earth itself the moon and the rest refused to shine he died paid the price that this life this oil might come to you and I he paid the price for us look at the Bible says it like this as it comes down it speaks of how that here even in the very latter part of it it says the seven candlesticks in verse 20 which thou sawest are the seven churches seven candlesticks its Christ Himself the candlestick the vine the life and out of him comes forth the branches he laid down his life like Adam did he laid it down that out of his side might come forth the elements that wouldn't comprise and make up his bride body he is the savior of the body the church he's the head of the church it's his flow of life and energy moving down through the church hallelujah and how that he himself had declared clear back over in the Book of Psalms he says I will dwell in the midst of my brethren I will declare thy name there's only one way that he could come in the midst of the church and give his life for you and I and that was that he had to be willing to give his life that you and I might have life so then the life that we now live in the flesh we live by the faith of the Son of God who loved us and gave himself for us so who's the focus here is the focus the branches or is the focus the candlestick Christ the focus is Christ if all we see is those seven candlesticks we missed it but remember in the midst of it one likened to the Son of man having his paps girded with a golden girdle and the brother brand picks it up in 1954 the church ages he says notice here he is one likened to the Son of Man it's Christ himself in the form of his church he is walking in the midst of his church and in the midst of that church here he himself we are a part of that beaten work our lives we are now we're invited that we might have our lives shaped our character molded because now once this oil once this life has been given now can come forth this church now can come forth the oil once the fire has come down on the and consume the sacrifice now can come the oil and can come the fire to light the lives of the believer and through that grace that is given to us that we might be able to reflect his glory every test and every trial and everything that comes our way God has a provided place for you and I he has a place of rest for you and I where we can rest where we can dwell and that's in him I said that's in him we can rest there let's bow our heads Lord Jesus father just lord within the thoughts Lord that just so pressing Lord upon my heart I pray that Lord here tonight that you lord somehow just taking Lord the thoughts Lord and bring them together lord help Lord God Lord that thought Lord that desire Lord of just so heavy on my heart Lord just beginning to look at these things and Lord to see father it's your life in everything Lord it is it's about reflecting you and Lord Jesus were aware of it that it's true lore the biggest enemy we have is ourselves your prophet made it made these statements in many different ways he says we smother you out so we argue against many many different statements that he makes them the message perfect strength Lord help us help us Lord to be more yielded to you Lord help us Lord when we're we're going through different tests and different trials help us Lord to be even more resting and you help us avoid father there's no way that we could win this is not a mind over matter we can't psyche our way into this but we need your help Lord we pray the Lord that you would help us to think of it Lord God that if we could say like this our our nervousness or our lack of trust it takes one it takes one who is the Prince of Peace himself he who is our rest it takes you Lord moving working in our lives Lord even when we're at tonight you've brought us here Lord you've helped us Lord to surrender you've created the conditions you've created that Lord that we might rest and we might surrender Lord Jesus as branches tonight Lord we only desire Lord to surrender even mourn submitting our lives and what God I think of what Lord your prophet is he placed in there now that he would speak to us and let us know you are ordained to be divine channels of his energy but his energies that God did not ordain for you just to go to work come home and read the newspaper he said that God ordained you that you might bear fruit you might be a channel a branch for his life to flow through Lord help us help us to be more consecrated Lord within that help us to be more focused upon that Lord father all around us Lord there's things Lord Jesus to try to distract us and try to take up Lord our thoughts and everything with the cares of life Lord Jesus we need your help Lord and I pray Heavenly Father that God you would help us tonight Lord as your children Lord Jesus that that same life Lord Oh what a what a comfort it is Lord in our hearts Lord because we what is within our bosom and has lifted us up we can Lord look back in your word and we find our identification in you Lord Oh father what a comfort it is and and then through that comfort Lord we can see that just as you it was you moving through the lives of the believers it was not the Acts of the Apostles it was the acts of the Holy Ghost through the apostles oh god help us tonight Lord help us as branches award that this life will Lord God would so flow through us Lord Oh Lord Jesus granted Lord tonight I pray but that testimony Lord of you the vine the candlestick that one walking in the midst of your church or God what a comfort it is Lord you're the same yesterday today forever we love you tonight Lord God Father we ask Lord that you would just Lord God moved Lord upon every heart if there's one here tonight that does not know you Lord in that way I pray tonight Lord that in their heart Lord that they might be drawn Lord for what they have heard and what they have seen that which the Lord is different but may they recognize that what it's different Lord is is not a man it's not a church but it's the Living God it's you representing and making yourself known among believers Lord God where believers are you'll come and you prove your word Lord and father I pray tonight Lord God made that heart Lord just Lord God just and surrender to you say Lord I want your life in me Lord I want that life to flow through me Lord God I want to give my life I want to be a branch I want to be a branch that's consecrated to you granite Lord God for Lord every step all that needs to be all the needs to be taken within it Lord we we see it within your word whenever there was Lord gone a life that you dealt with you first sort bring conviction to that heart Lord and understand that conviction in leads to repentance Lord Oh God and then how you move down in that life Lord and bringing it into the water of baptism to be identified in your death that they might come forth Lord and be identified in your resurrection granite Lord God I pray to where that they and themselves Lord become lost in you Lord Oh Granite Lord Jesus I pray father for every life Lord tonight we give ourselves to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen stand with me would you there is a [Music] Oh floor from with [Music] [Applause] oh yes Lord [Music] breathe [Music] [Laughter] [Music] Oh is one [Music] there [Music]
