went forth behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him amen thank God for ears to hear what the Spirit say it to the churches hey man you know the Bible tells us in the last days is said it'll be a famine and have been in the Book of Amos and it will not be a famine it said for bread and water but it'll be a famine for the hearing of the word of God and when you think of it it's not just hearing scriptures and chapters and and so forth but it's hearing so that famine is result of the inability to hear but to be able to hear then you're able to feast you're able to feast and find and hear and receive and be benefited I'll tell your friends more and more that and when I look at it in God's grace and what God continues to unfold I see more and more it's the grace of God that's all I see it's God's grace it's nothing I've done it's nothing I could do it's nothing I've merited but it is simply the grace of Almighty God it's not that many of us it's not that we have some great astute mind to be able to understand things we could read and read the scriptures you realize that brother Bram tells us he said you can listen to this message he said you can listen to it 24 hours a day every day of the week but if the Spirit of God is not on the inside to teach you he said you'll never understand it the Pharisees they didn't understand it they knew the word but they did not know the author of the word how precious it is to know the author of the word then when he shows up you're always going to recognize you amen we're waiting on his coming aren't we and I believe he's coming this morning y'all believe he's coming this morning now he may not come this morning in his corporal body and us be raptured but he's gonna come here this morning he's going to speak to us and this whole gathering is us getting ready and the preparation for that coming of the Lord you realize that this right here is a great type right here Paul laid it down by us coming together in the house of God we are gathering unto Him that one of these days one of these days when the dead in Christ shall rise we which are alive and remain will be getting together here on this earth this is only a rehearsal of what's gonna take place amen aren't you grateful to the Lord amen it's so good to be a Christian I just thinking of that this morning I woke up and I said Lord what a privilege it is to serve you it's a greatest privilege it is to serve the Lord and you know I just say it like this and I pray you don't misunderstand me but if there was not a heaven to go to there was nothing after this I wouldn't change what I'm doing for one thing I wouldn't change how I'm living I'm not living this way because of something I live like this because I love him he changed me is that how you feel amen well we're just we're just so appreciative of the Lord I want to say as we're getting ready to lift up the mission offering here first of all I need to apologize to you because I told you I was gonna send you that link where they talked about the Spanish translation project and I I started working on it and getting that link for you and then got sidetracked and so I I have it for you two to give out to you so that you can look at that or brother Eli had brought last Saturday their brother Paul's and I want you if you get a chance to to listen to that and I'm just so thankful to the Lord for what God has done I think what brother Eli had mentioned that they're still have the remaining 200 they're already translated they're just processing that right now it should be here by the Lord willing by the beginning of 2020 every single message in Spanish will be uploaded it'll be able a men and so with with our our little part that we've had has just been to support then the printing of it and it's something that's so vital as I mentioned to you we a lot of times with things that we have right now we kind of have in some instances we use our devices and we use a lot of other things like that but there is so many of those places they don't even have devices to use when you get out into the country in other places like that and that's why the need has went forth and different brothers are even printing they're doing a lot of printing we're coming out of China they found places to print that then get it shipped to other places because there's no longer any printing going on and I didn't know if you were aware of that the voice of God is no longer printing the message its handing out tablets but we there's many that still need the word in a printed and it needs the Holy Ghost to quicken it amen so we just want to just want to keep that in mind and just thank you for your your support within that and we just want to give to that this morning want to say brother Jerry we certainly appreciate brother Jerry being here with us amen you pray for him and Lord willing I think he's gonna be leaving out there tomorrow so you just want to keep him in prayer the Lord will just bless him and refresh him and we want to just as the brothers would come and get ready to lift the love offering or the mission offering here this morning you just give from your heart amen how many thankful to the Lord the sprayer Heavenly Father Lord as we just Lord come before you in this moment Lord we're just so grateful Lord for your mercy and your grace Lord Lord we see father as Lord each and every day your mercies there noon Lord we thank you for that father Lord is we would lift Lord this this mission offering this morning father you're the one Lord and Lord oversees it and directs at God to see that it goes the Lord to minister to the needs of your children Lord you've Lord I thank you Lord of how that you have Lord equipped us and blessed us Lord than more not only have we been able to move Lord or to help out with the Lord the printing Lord of the of the books Lord and getting it into the minister's hands and believers hands but I think your father Lord for you've allowed us Lord to also be a part Lord of other endeavors Lord God things Lord that's taking place in the Philippines Lord you see dear God we're not a people Lord of great wealth but you don't need Lord people of great wealth Lord God all you need is hearts Lord and have one desire and one objective Lord and that's to see you glorified and I pray God that Lord that you would take Lord God the offering Lord that's given from the hearts Lord and I ask God that you'd bless the worshiper Lord as they would give and sacrifice Laura de of their living and I pray that God that you would take it Lord and multiply it Lord God direct it Lord God into the use Lord for the kingdom of God for the Lord how we're living every day every moment Lord we're longing dear God for the day of sweet release Lord and father until that time Lord God with patience Lord we wait Lord God looking Lord for you because Lord you never fail Lord every promise you've made or God you have made it real to our hearts Lord and father we thank you for that Lord we just ask your blessing upon the further part of the service now Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen god bless you as you give I want to ask have a brother here this morning a friend and brother that brother Jerry and myself when we went to the Philippines there two years ago brother LAN LAN we had a camp meeting that we started with and over in the island of caballo and you can only fly in there right now on two different days of the week and fly in and out so we were there with the saints of God just had a wonderful time with brother LAN LAN and and his his family and the believers that were gathered there and others that came in brother LAN LAN was has reached out to us this year and been able to come by and to share the Word of God with us and what God has put on his heart and I I just want to say I so appreciate our brothers burden and vision there's been a lot of outreach and and work that our brother has done and a lot of things even he was sharing with us here the other night when the typhoon high end had hit into the Philippines and not all not all the Philippines was was taken down by that that typhoon but there were certain places and certain islands that were really really affected because of its pattern and the Lord just allowed our brother to be used and they were able to go and minister to the different needs of the Saints that were there and how the many of them had lost everything they had and then how that God you know had used them in the local assemblies and one of the testimonies that brother LAN LAN had received from even local people is that even with what God had equipped them to be able to do there were things that the government and no one else had been able to do that and you know how it is in many of those cases government can send in food they can send in supplies sometimes unfortunately there's not always the people above who's honest and they lock it up and instead of giving it out it's locked up so you know we the one thing that was tested testified is how that God had taken just the group of believers that they hadn't been able to minister to the needs of his children I'll tell you what we still we're serving a God who can take you can take just loaves and fishes and can multiply it to see that it meets the needs a men he's more than enough any amen so we just want to just welcome brother LAN LAN here this morning and his family is just a just a real blessing I'll tell you every one of them are just really talented musicians and can sing so we just want to welcome brother LAN LAN and just ask that God will just just make him feel at home here this morning and we want to pull on the gift of God I believe that God knows what we have need of God can take God can take a man that is from clear the other side of the globe and God will direct that man to speak exactly what you and I have need of that's the kind of God we serve amen so let's just let's let's just look to the Lord as our brother would come amen and brother LAN LAN we're glad to have you here this morning with us amen come on brother so break Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved like me [Music] [Applause] was must fly up now [Music] god bless you Saints and on behalf of my church in DeKalb I'm City Philippines I bring greetings in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I'm so happy this morning to be video stand before you but you know I I feel nervous this morning and please pray for me my English is not good and just pray that God will it's me how to you know so to speak what's in my heart first of all I would like to thank God for this great opportunity that he has given me once again to come and the travel the other side of the world and meet the brothers and sisters fellowship video and I also thank Butler Samuel and but jelly for accommodating me and for the for their yesterday her son will have been touring me here in this around this place and I really enjoyed the fellowship hallelujah and his family sister browning yeah get the she got the nice house and nice cool and my family they were seeing the pictures that I've been posting on Facebook and all of them are you always eating and thank you very much for that Alleluia and I enjoyed the fellowship that we have yesterday last night and just pray for me hallelujah and I regret everybody to please stand then let us open our Bible in the book of Romans chapter 15 from verse 1 up to verse 4 and before we will approach the world let us bow our heads and let us approach the author of this word their Heavenly Father once again we thank you Lord God for another opportunity that you have given me giving us Lord God to read and to hear you word and Lord God Alleluia as we know Lord Jesus that there is a scripture that is written in this Bible Alleluia that is not under your the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and Lord God Alleluia and our human mind cannot understand it it is impossible for us to understand it without the Holy Spirit Alleluia to teach us Lord God and I pray this morning Alleluia that q.l sent down the Holy Spirit to anoint you word annoying dearest instrument and also Lord God the hearer in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen Alleluia Romans chapter 15 verses 1 to 4 says within that our strong October the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves let every one of us please his neighbor for his good to edification for even Christ please not himself but as it is written the reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me and verse more for whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope one thing one more scripture in a first Peter chapter 2 let us read verse verse five it says ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house and house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ and me the Lord at blessing upon the reading of his word and you may be seated in the presence of the Lord Alleluia so brother Samuel and brother Jerry they had been in my place and they had been a great blessing to the believers in our islands and the nearby places there hallelujah and actually the church had been expecting for them to come this year but because of lack of communication I do not have any communication with brother Samuel so it seems there is a conflict on the schedule Alleluia and maybe this time they could not be able to come to our place but we know that there is always a time for everything and I am still hoping and praying that God will bring them again to the minister to us Alleluia so this morning I would like to speak on the subject spiritual priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices Alleluia spiritual priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices now we see in the Old Testament that the priests drr peculiar people and the lib hallelujah D are a group of people who lived not for themselves but the belief Alleluia are dedicated and a consecrated lives Alleluia to serve God and to serve their brethren Alleluia and didn't care so much on the things of the world Alleluia but they live hallelujah in the temple and didn't even have portion on the land Alleluia but their portion is gone hallelujah although they don't have portion or inheritance and natural inheritance which is the natural land but God took care of them Galleria poor God is their portion Alleluia and they didn't care so much on material things but they are more on the spiritual side Alleluia and in our time Alleluia if we read Revelation chapter 5 after the lamp had taken the book from him that sat on the throne hallelujah and and the Bible said that he had made us unto our God kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth hallelujah so we are and as a Apostle Peter say that we are and a peculiar people we are a chosen generation a peculiar people a royal priesthood Alleluia and to offer up spiritual sacrifices there is a ministry that we are going to do hallelujah is to to open up spiritual sacrifices now natural Israel is type 2 the church which is the spiritual Israel Alleluia and this time I would like to take an example Israel's journey from Egypt into the Promised Land and burnham said that many people refer the promised land to the Millennium and he said it is not hallelujah the promised land had Wars and killings the Millennium won't have any words or killings hallelujah and the promised land it referred to the Holy Spirit the battleground hallelujah so once we became a part of that body baptized by one spirit into that body Alleluia and brahbrah ham say that we are not on a picnic we are on a battleground not like us these megachurches you know sometimes we can hear them their members are Wendy testifies that since I become a part of this big church I became a Christian I don't have any problem hallelujah I am always happy and you know no brothers and sisters once we separate hallelujah became separated from Satan hallelujah and then he became our enemy or we become his enemy then all the forces of Satan is pointing on us 24/7 so we are on this we are not on a picnic and we are on a battleground hallelujah now in Israel's journey to the promised land there were three stages as we have also the same Christa gist of grace for the church hallelujah from justification sanctification and baptism of the Holy Spirit baptism of the Holy Ghost justification hallelujah after they left Egypt by believing the world disapper acted themselves from the Egyptians disappear separated themselves from from the world and then the next stage is after the cross Red Sea that was sanctification hallelujah and killed everything from Egypt was killed were killed be handed hallelujah and they were sanctified through the blood hallelujah that kills all the human desires of evil and then the last stage is the baptism of the Holy Ghost that was when early after the cross Jordan and started to possess the promised land hallelujah but brothers and sisters as Barbara Ham say that the redemption is in two parts or twofold number one is coming out and the number two is going in early ie it is not only coming out and then God for so claim in the wilderness but God is trying to bring them hallelujah to possess or to enter into the Promised Land but before after the cross Red Sea or he came out of Egypt and before the inter into the promised land they have go OPS's a process of sanctification Alleluia and God sent down his word to his prophet Moses hallelujah and those who refused God was cleansing them hallelujah God will not allow any man to enter into the Promised Land without first cleansing them cleaning them Alleluia and that's why the Bible says that all we had God destroy them in the wilderness because of unbelief it means to see they refused the word hallelujah that God was giving twist his prophet Alleluia so in God destroy them in the wilderness those who refused the word and after only brothers and sisters Alleluia it is the word that cleanses us Alleluia and that's why press and sisters we also have the same thing in our age area and you know God sent the message it is not only for us to have a strong doctrine that we can debate with other religion but every time you come to church Alleluia God is Attali cleansing as cleansing us Alleluia Ephesians 5:26 it says he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word hallelujah so the missus that we are you know it is preparing us it is cleansing us hallelujah now by the baptism of the Holy Ghost hallelujah then we are born again hallelujah we are born into the body hallelujah and for by one spirit we're all baptized into that one body and if we see brothers and sisters the greatest battle that happened in a time of Israel was not hallelujah after the cross rinsing or hallelujah they came out of Egypt but the greatest battle that happened in the time was when the cross children early after the cross Jordan not windy had just lived or came out of Egypt but windy start hallelujah to possess the promised land hallelujah then the battle was intensified hallelujah and we also have the same promise in the day of Pentecost of Apostle Peter said and the promise is unto you and unto your children and hallelujah once we started to possess that promise the life in the Holy Ghost hallelujah then the battle will be hallelujah intensified and you know brothers if you will just read the book of just wow that wind is not told how long we wait to possess the land and then Holloway conquered Jericho and other dia yeah yeah but how yeah windy he started Toto conquer them and then the kings of the land the the organize themselves hallelujah and it became the battles became more harder and harder that's the same thing brothers and sisters to our to our time hallelujah now natural battle hallelujah I believe that there are some of you here that became a soldier Marjorie he was a I I know he was a soldier before early and I don't know if there are some other brothers here Alleluia and the natural battle you will hardly win a battle without a proper team or or coordination Alleluia there must be a proper teamwork with each other Alleluia a proper communication a proper coordination that's why brothers and sisters the Philippines being an ally to the United States every year we have this we called it in our in our language Balikatan exercises poly-cotton military exercises every year they are doing it in the Philippines in the this time they are doing it in the South China Sea hallelujah as you know you know what is happening now in in the the South China Sea and Balikatan means shoulder-to-shoulder there is there is no worry and yet they are practicing to have a a good be more hallelujah so that in case the Philippines is being attacked by by an enemy or Olivia the United States is being attacked by any any country Alinea be already hub Olivia da da that P more they already know what to do hallelujah because we have been practicing it for so many years all away and the same things brothers and sisters hallelujah we are in this great battle and every believer every part of that battle we should have hallelujah proper teamwork earlier with each other Alleluia and when I I was looking and watching YouTube how this American forces invaded Iraq or Afghanistan beyond haba you know they have the ground forces with the with tungsten on them with them and then they also have they artillery we have the Air Force and we needed some missile then there is the there are ships Olivia from the Navy that can launch missile Alleluia and even though how how what kind of bomb training the ground forces behave hallelujah the hub dad the bullet proof and they have these night-vision goggles and full of ammunition and high-powered guns but brothers sisters if we are just depending on them on their training on their ability without an Air Force hallelujah they cannot win the battle it would be hard for them to win the battle and then sometimes they say that those who dominate the air alia be win the battle and you can see that that China they have millions and millions of soldiers while the American forces I think they only have more than 300,000 active soldiers and we have more than 400 reservists but the submission the civilian we have every one of them they have guns hallelujah but we have hala we had the biggest air force in the world Alleluia and didn't operate you know although the China they have millions of soldiers but because we have a power from above Alleluia and he believed he will win the battle hallelujah and the same thing brothers and sisters know how good we are how righteous we are how ability we have if we don't have a power from above earlier a power communica a proper communication hallelujah to the power above we will never win the battle Samson he was known Elisha Hawaii of his strength but when he lost his contact hallelujah to God hallelujah he lost the battle hallelujah now on the ground forces we have to fight shoulder-to-shoulder hallelujah although he feel upset to his fellow soldier just like in mean I was young we have a military camp near to our place and sometimes they when they don't have any operation be good to houses and some places and you know drinking and after drinking windy they get drunk and sometimes the you know fight with each other and they feel they have some differences but when we go hallelujah to the battle we have to forget everything hallelujah we have to support one with each other we have to fight shoulder-to-shoulder we have to protect his fellow soldier hallelujah as well as his fellow soldier can protect him too it's the same thing with us brothers and sisters and we should know who is our enemy Illya sometimes you feel upset with the with brothers or with sister but brother sisters you need to support them we need to support with each other hallelujah now hallelujah and so I bar Burnham say that eternal life is living for others Alleluia it is not just for yourself when you got eternal life he said he was just one man the perfect man He gave His life and he made an example for you now what must we do now the first thing I want to say is Jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others the same thing Paul was saying and on the on the scripture that we read in hallelujah in Romans chapter 15 hallelujah his life was spent for others that's perfectly eternal life when you say you go to church and you know good things that's fine but when you live for your life Olivia to yourself you have an eternal life for eternal life is living for others that's why Paul said we then that are strong alleluia ought to bear the infirmities of the weak hallelujah hallelujah and not to please ourselves we then that are strong those who are strong alleluia ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and the question is how can you bear the infirmities of the weak when you yourself this week hallelujah we knew yourself are our babies children hallelujah that's why one of the reason that God gave us the fivefold ministry hallelujah is in order for us to not to remain children if you read in efficient chapter 4 verse 11 he says and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers the purpose is for the perfect thing of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying edifying of the body of Christ the word perfect or perfect it doesn't mean that you don't have any mistake because the Prophet said as long as we are in this place we always have this sticky nature that's why God will you know change this this body hallelujah we always commit mistake but the word perfect here it means full grown matured hallelujah to be an adult and not to remain children for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry in order for us to be you know full grown to be matured Alleluia till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man and to an adult and a matured man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ so that Alleluia we henceforth be no more children but adult only about matured Alleluia toast those to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive in order for us not to remain children Olivia that's that is our hallelujah being a minister being a pastor it's always our desire how do we have to see the church to see the believers Alleluia being matured in the faith established in the faith Alleluia that's why even Paul one time Alleluia in he wrote his epistle tada believe the Hebrew believers in Hebrews chapter 5 verse 2 lb says for when for the time ye ought to be teachers he have made that one PTO again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and ye are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat I've been living and being pitching you Alawis and supposed to be you should have been much you became matured and here now you are still needing milk and not strong meat hallelujah you are still children hallelujah you really supposed to be a pitcher Alleluia that can can help those those that are weak but now you said Oh hallelujah how comes you are still children still needing mirror hallelujah now here are some signs of being a babe or being a child in first Corinthians chapter 3 verse 1 he said and I brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual spiritual means you are mature I cannot speak to you being a matured one a spiritual one but as an to kernel kernel a beam but as and to Colonel even as unto babes in Christ for being in Christ no problem you are already in Christ but you are still a baby why because you are still Colonel Alleluia you should be spiritual you should be spiritual is a sign of being hallelujah a matured one hallelujah but carnality is childish oh babe I have video with milk and not with meat for hitherto we were not able to bear it neither yet now are you able for ye are yet colonel hallelujah so here are some some some manifestation of carnality which is a sign of being a babe for where whereas there is among yo inveighing and strife and divisions are ye not carnal and work as men for while one says I am a ball in another I am of apollos are ye not carnal hallelujah so we can see brothers and sisters that carnality Alleluia is a sign of being a babe Paul is attaching carnality to being a babe hallelujah and Hebrews chapter 5 verse 13 he says for every one that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe hallelujah and a babe is unskillful imagine brothers and sisters we are on this great battle and you both on the battlefield hallelujah and you are bringing somebody video to help you on the battle and you are bringing babes hallelujah so what what do you think would happen in the battle you are expecting you are meaning you know you bring you ha a lot of soldiers and all of them are babes hallelujah so how can be help earlier instead of a support they are just burden all of the way because babe carnality hallelujah the same thing and here is the sign of being a matured one John chapter 21 verse 18 he says verily verily I say unto thee when thou was young now goodness thyself and locust whether the wouldest but when thou shalt be old thou shalt stretch forth thy hands and another shall gird thee and carry thee whither thou what is not when a man is young whatever he wants to do he will do it we're even wherever he wants to go he will go and nobody can pitch him it is his will Alya he will do whatever he is Willis and then hallelujah when thou shalt became all hallelujah he just stretch forth thy hands hallelujah and somebody were good you and he will bring you into places where you don't want to go it means to say that when a man became all it is no longer he's no longer doing his own will but it is somebody's will ania is done in his life hallelujah just like Paul hallelujah in all his intellectual earnings he wants to do his own whim hallelujah and he was thinking he is supporting God he is supporting the believers and Christ said Jesus said you are persecuting me hallelujah but brothers resistors after Paul was converted after he became converted Alleluia and the you know brothers and sisters before he was thinking that he was doing the will of God allelujah he is so jealous for his his group he so jealous for his religion hallelujah and he is even using the same Bible hallelujah but you just said all you are kicking against the pricks you are persecuting me hallelujah he is persecuting the very god that he thinks you are serving but one day all was changed became converted hallelujah and one of his account this is Galatians chapter 2 verse 20 I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live but it's no longer I that liveth it is Christ that lives in me leave it in me and the life which I now live in the flesh hallelujah live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself came early and that's why brothers and sisters sometimes he wants to go into this place but the Holy Spirit tells him told him not to go but you have to go this way it is no longer his will but somebody's will he is living Alleluia to somebody's will one time Apostle Peter he was so in love with his master for three and half years that I had been with the Lord Jesus Christ and he was so in loved he he was willing to give his life hallelujah for the Lord maybe one day Jesus was you know teaching them telling them about what would happen to him and the Bible says the Son of Man Jesus I started to you know to say the son of man Alleluia will be delivered into the sense of man and the Bible says Jesus he was showing to his disciples what things he is going to suffer hallelujah maybe the Lord had been copying the Book of Isaiah been quoting the Book of Psalms and then the scriptures that Ben that was written by Moses hallelujah imagine to believe the word hallelujah Jesus is saying this is going to happen Olivia this is the things that are going to happen to me and then Peter said over my dead body I'm not going to allow it hallelujah instead of accepting what the scripture is saying and now Peter was depending what he his feeling is to his master hallelujah and Jesus said Peter you are an offense to me get thee behind me Satan hallelujah and one time when Marco was about to arrest the Lord and Peter he wrote is you know he's Motiti and then when Marco was trying to arrest Jesus and in him hallelujah Peter was really intended to cut the head of hallelujah Marco and Marco he escaped and that is ear cut hallelujah he was really willing hallelujah don't do it Peter put it back Honoria but one day Jesus say look chapter 22 verse 31 and the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan hath desired to have you that give me him is safe you as with but i prayed for thee that thy faith fail not but when thou art converted Alleluia you need to be converted Peter but window are converted that's the time that you can strip in strengthen your brain this time Peter you cannot do it Alleluia you are still living with your feelings Alleluia instead of believing the word you are still you know you still depend on what you feel alan leong your fleshly feeling Alleluia on your own your emotion you cannot strengthen but one day Peter when thou art converted and that's the time that you can be a support you can be a help you can strengthen your brethren Alleluia that's why brothers and sisters on the day of Pentecost hallelujah when he was baptized with the Holy Ghost was filled with the Holy Ghost before the day of Pentecost he was under his emotion he was under his feeling and he was scared he afraid and they were hiding Alleluia before the day have been because he got his feeling pitch master and after they arrested him Alleluia he went there and you know trying to show he was concerned for his master but here comes a a young lady are you with him are you one of his disciples hallelujah no I don't even understand what you are saying I don't know him hallelujah under his human emotion but after he was filled with the Holy Ghost hallelujah that fear left him he was no longer living under his emotion under his fear but he was living now hallelujah - somebody's leading Halloween there he started hallelujah to live as a support as a help to strengthen alia the believers before he afraid to die but now when they were about to crucify him oh my he did not refuse hallelujah don't just crucify me like my lord but crucify me upside down a beanpole he said and now I am willing Allah we I am ready to be offered hallelujah but before he didn't want to be you know he is the one who want to you want to kill but now he wants to to be killed hallelujah begins because he is no longer living hallelujah under his his feelings hallelujah no one time when this relights were with the rich Alleluia da the Jordan River right at the Bank of Jordan River maybe Jordan is not it is not a big river you know you can have been a child can put a stone and can throw it to the other side hallelujah and they are already there and they've been in the wilderness for 40 years margin brothers and sisters maybe you will say for me there is no reason that I'm going to doubt the Word of God God put them in a place that they could done anything they couldn't do anything their food hallelujah they don't have store to buy they don't have place to plant and yet within 40 years God feed them hallelujah didn't have a hospital to go and when somebody is a HEPA you know got sick problem said they have dr. Moses hallelujah and their folk did not swell their feet did not swell if be the bee left Egypt and be hub maybe the hub there shows is like like that hallelujah is it not a miracle brothers and sisters there is for me maybe for you you will say there is no reason that I'm going to doubt the Word of God hallelujah we have seen the pillar of fire by night the pillar of cloud by day the way the the witness how God divided the Red Sea Alleluia you know the Bible says that there is there was a rock following them hallelujah and they are I believe brothers and sisters that at the time on on Kadesh Barnea Alleluia that be were not only for me but this is not a doctrine that I am you know they were not just two million in at the time because they left Egypt there were two million Israelites that left Egypt hallelujah and let me give you an example 32 years ago when I got married with my wife we were only two and after 13 years or 15 years we became 9 in the period of in that you know in just in 15 years how about the is 40 years how many do you think but I am NOT going to give you any figure you might say over Lennon is making a doctrine hallelujah and in our time especially here in the United States the people didn't want to help many children because the reason is it's hard to support them but in the wilderness hallelujah they don't have to worry because God is supplying all their needs maybe some of them they got 15 children were children ten children Alleluia and they don't have to worry didn't let their children go to go to school they don't buy food they don't work they just eat sleep hallelujah they wake up there is already the manna you don't have to worry if they have a lot of children hallelujah and then when they were Alleluia in in right at the Jordan River hallelujah and Moses hallelujah sent them to search the land and then when they came home I believe processes data Moses chose a 1 in every tribe let me say in every 500,000 Moses just one hallelujah and like for example if if barrage theory is going to choose a brother in this come in his congregation to represent discharge I believe he is not going to choose somebody who is just a new in you know who's just new in in the congregation maybe I believe he is going to he is going to choose a matured brother hallelujah a matured one that will represent his church early and this I believe this is what Moses did to the congregation of Israel hallelujah he chose one in his tribe and then there were 12 spies that he sent to search the land and then after searching the land numbers chapter 13 verse 26 and they went and came to Moses and to Aaron and to all the congregation of the children of Israel and to the wilderness of Paran to Kadesh and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land and they told him and said we came unto the land whither thou sendest us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and there is the fruit a bit here is the problem in Alleluia truly the word that is true hallelujah you know nobody had been there hallelujah nobody had send the land yet but how they did know that the land is flowing with milk and honey that the land is fat it was only the Word of God described the land and when they discovered it praise God you might say the Word of God is true we imagined but resisters if you are going to to buy one pound of grapes this time maybe it's only one cluster is one one pound but during that time one cluster of grapes there were two men carrying it Moses prophet Moses the Word of God is true hallelujah but and for me hallelujah there is no reason that we are going to doubt the Word of God and then God told him hallelujah you go possess the land the brains alia that the sole of your foot shall played upon that land is yours don't be afraid for the battle is of the Lord hallelujah but brothers and sisters when they came back and they already have the fruit of the land the proof of the Word of God hallelujah bursting take nevertheless the people that be the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities our world and very great and moreover we saw the children of n up there the Amalekites dwell in the land of the South the Hittites and the jebusites and the Emirates dwell in the in the mountains and the Canaanites dwell by the sea and by the coast of Jordan and calleb still the people before Moses and say let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it but the man that went up with him said we not be able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we hallelujah and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel saying the land through which we have gone to search it is a land that ended up inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw Alleluia in E in it are men of great stature and they're resolved the Giants the sons of enna which come of the Giants and we were owner on our own sight as grasshoppers and so we were in their sight imagine brothers and sisters men hallelujah who's supposed to be a matured ones hallelujah indeedy obscene be witness hallelujah the power of God in the wilderness and instead of holding just believing to what the word says then they start to give report hallelujah basing on their feelings on their emotions on what they see Alleluia of these other five senses missing the report they were basing on what they feel in their you know their fear hallelujah Colonel feelings and instead hallelujah to be a support instead to give aa courage to the people awliya because the debased hallelujah they depend on under emotion on their carnality instead of just looking to the Word of God hallelujah they made the Wigmore weaker it didn't help hallelujah the congregation margin great men chosen from every tribe hallelujah supposed to be strong supposed to be spiritual hallelujah and when the Gabe report basing on their carnality hallelujah it didn't help the congregation numbers chapter 14 verse 1 and all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and the people whip that night and all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron and the whole congregation said unto them would God that we had died in the land of Egypt or would God we had died in this wilderness and wherefore hath the Lord brought us unto this land to fall by the sword that our wives and our children should be afraid we're it not better for us to return to Egypt it's good maybe it is better for us go to the world hallelujah why did we have that kind of decision because a negative report Alleluia it caused discouragement and and they said one to another let us make a captain and let us return into Egypt and Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the simply of the congregation of the children of Israel and Joshua the son of nun in Caleb the son of Jephunneh which were of them that searched the land rend their clothes and they speak are all unto all the company of the children of Israel saying the land which we have passed true to search it is an exceeding good land if the Lord be light in us then we will bring us he will bring us into this land and give it as a language fluid will with milk and honey now producers here are allelujah the pen spice and here are Moses ah just we're in Cali they saw the same thing just wah so the same thing that the ten had seen and that then they also have seen what Joseph a and colleague Hobson but Joshua didn't globe beyond based on their own carnality on their emotion but be based hallelujah the report Bibi stood on the Word of God hallelujah and then here then spies the same word just once a and Caliban same but Brazil sisters they have different report because they base it Alleluia on their carnality Alleluia and it didn't help the congregation Alleluia the same thing Alleluia the report is we are like gossiper but just what said we are just bread to us hallelujah because Alleluia they are living in two different what do you call that in English yeah just when caliber spiritual and we look to what the word says and then they store the best to what be feeling you know book book book in their hearts hallelujah we are just you know and you know brothers and sisters Alleluia Jesus said if the Lord be light in us then he will bring us into this land and give it us a language with fluid with milk and honey if the Lord delighting us if the Lord pleased us on us how to please the road Hebrews chapter 11 verse 6 for without faith it is impossible to be like him impossible to please God Alleluia for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him what is faith faith if you know it is not in in the body not in in in the spirit but it is in the soul Alleluia just like Abraham when God told him Abraham you will have a son and abraham believed God hallelujah it was counted in for righteousness and many may be people at all he's crazy he's an old old man and yet is still believing because Abraham hidden base to what holiday at the ability of his flesh but Abraham he was looking not to his ability but he was looking to what the Lord had said that's faith earlier if only hallelujah if the Lord delights in us if the Lord placed in us Alleluia how we can please the Lord earlier without faith you cannot you can never please God it is impossible it is impossible to delight the Lord Alleluia now verse 9 in numbers chapter 14 verse 9 he says only rebel not he against the Lord neither fear ye the people of the land for they are bred unto us the defense is departed the defense is departed from them and the Lord is with us heard him not but all the congregation made stone with them with stones and the glory of the Lord departed in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel and they rose up early in the morning and got them up into the top of the mountain saying lo we be here and we'll go up unto the place which the Lord had promised for we have seen and Moses said were for now do ye transgress the commandment of the Lord but it shall not prosper hallelujah it shall not prosper go up do not up for the Lord is not among you that ye be not smitten before your enemies for the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you and ye shall fall by the sword because ye are turned away from the Lord therefore the Lord will not be with you but they presume to go up unto the hilltop nevertheless the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and Moses departed not out of the camp then the Amalekites came down and the Canaanites which dwell in that hill and smote them and discomforted them even unto former millions maybe thousands maybe died at that time what is the reason hallelujah because of these people this spice that should be that we should supposed to be supposedly we should be a support a help hallelujah and because of their carnality and brought negative report to the congregation it caused a lot of deaths it costs death for a lot of sin sir israelites elderly and brothers and sisters sometimes in this congregation you might be thinking that this is just a simple negative report you know brother si you know the brother is like this the sisters like this don't allow any negative report to come in to the congregation you might be thinking this is just a simple thing hallelujah but brothers and sisters you don't know hallelujah what would be the result it might cause several deaths are we a spiritual death in the congregation don't allow any negative report Alleluia because of their carnality carnality is like children we hallelujah that I believe brothers listeners we have a lot of just went just what's up there five you versus two and five at that time the Lord said unto Joshua make these sharp knives and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time and just what made him sharp knives and circumcise the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins and this is the causeway Joshua did circumcise all the people that came out of Egypt that were males even all the man o'war died in the wilderness by the way after they came out of Egypt and all the people that came out were circumcised but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt then we had not circumcise our brothers I'm sorry too for mentioning about these things but I believe that God did not put these things in a Bible without any significance or important things for us to know hallelujah now originally God's covenant to Abraham was to circumcise every male child after they were born areaa eight days after they were born hallelujah and I don't know how you do it here in in the Philippines in the United States we do it different in in the Philippines but for us believers we there circumcision or no circumcision it has nothing to do with our salvation because our circumcision is not in the flesh but it is in the heart Alleluia so by the baptism of the Holy Spirit so circumcision is a type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost hallelujah and then here is a thing brother sisters Yeshua was commanded to make not only prepare knives but make a sharp sharp knives hallelujah to circumcise all the men aboard earlier for Israel and the reason is all the men that came out of Egypt they were all circumcised but the men that were born in the wilderness nobody was circumcised the question is why hallelujah when they were in Egypt it's been it has been and when they were in Egypt they were busy people being enslaved earlier be are obligated you know to work but when they have the male child we still have time to circumcise the child and why is it that when they were in the wilderness we'll really have the profit maybe they can remember now the Covenant of God to Abram they have the pillar of fire the you know they go to the to the tabernacle and the Bible said new one was being circumcised hallelujah in the wilderness one of the reason is circumcision is the type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and in the wilderness it was not the baptism of the Holy Ghost it was the period of sanctification so nobody was get circumcised in the time and then when they entered into the promised land after crossing Jordan it is now Alleluia the time of the type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and map is him of the Holy Ghost circumcision Alleluia is the same to us hallelujah they must have to do it and then one thing more when you circumcised and infant whether he liked it or not he can do nothing when the parents are circumcised a child we will just cry and it is not his own decision it is the decision of his father and his mother that's why brother sister Alleluia sometimes before we we heard this missings I mean the parents are Christians and the children also are Christians because the you are born in Alleluia in in a pair in a Christian home but brother sister saying that we have the Prophet that tells us that everyone must be born hallelujah everyone must decide it is his own decision not the decision of the father or the decision of the mother it is your own decision and there is Moses is Joshua with a sharp knives hallelujah and you have to decide whether if you are going to face that sharp knife or not or reject that sharp knife because it is hurt Allah we are no anesthesia that's the same thing we do in in the Philippines hallelujah when we were about 8 to 12 years old that's the time that the time of our circumcision and we we go to the certain some of them they go to the hospital with anesthesia but for us in the province we just go to a certain farmer and then we got this sharp very sharp knife or Motiti and it hurt to cut the flesh but you have to face it hallelujah you know the Word of God is quick and powerful like - indeed short it's hurt you know when the pastor begin to you know earlier it hurt to our outward man but your outward man must be cut hallelujah hallelujah so he can live in us Olivia and there is mostly a here's just one before you can hallelujah you cannot possess the land without the baptism of the Holy Ghost hallelujah so just watch chapter 1 verse 1 to 9 now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord speak unto just what the son of nun Moses Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all these people and to the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel now just why Moses hallelujah is now dead and you are the one to bring them you are the one to leave them all away you are the one to be you know to be a to help them hallelujah every place that the sole of your foot shall trade upon that have I given unto you even as I said unto Moses for from the wilderness of this Lebanon even unto the great river the river you prepare all the land of the Hittites and unto the the great sea toward the going down of the Sun shall be your cost there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fill thee nor forsake thee so how is he going to bring the people how is he going to hallelujah to help the congregation of Israel be strong you cannot help if you are weak so you should be strong and have a good courage for unto these people shall shut doubt divide for an inheritance Alleluia the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them in order for just what to leader people he must be strong and very courageous but what do you mean strong and how to be strong hallelujah not to remain a weak a child hallelujah the seven only be now strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe earlier to all though to do according to all the law all the law only which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the

in the morning and they removed from seat him and came to Jordan he and all the children of Israel and lots there before the Passover and it came to pass after three days that the officers went through the horse and they commanded the people saying when you see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God and the priests the Levites bearing it then he shall removed from your place and go

heretofore here is the thing our ancestors as they are going to cross Jordan to possess the land and the Lord said unto Joshua at the officer hallelujah he when he announced hallelujah and become indeed the people saying when ye see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God and the priests the Levites bearing it then he shall remove from your place and go after it then you have to follow hallelujah when you see the priests now at this time it is just wha who was the leader of Israel hallelujah he lived he was do the leading and we have the Holy Spirit in our he's a type of just one hallelujah in our time it was justwow who was the leader who was leading them and yet it was not just what in front of them it was the priests hallelujah that you can see but we're leading them that's why maybe today we have say you say okay I have the Holy Ghost and I can do anything I can do but but the officers say that uh and the commanded the people saying when you see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God and the priest bearing then he shall remove from your place and go after it just follow hallelujah don't go near don't go ahead of them just watch them and follow them there will be a space of two thousand cubits or three thousand feet by distance don't go near just follow Allah lujah the minister who was who were bearing the ark which is the type of the world Alleluia that's why Barbarin say that you can you cannot live or help Revelation higher than your pastor Alleluia you should obey your pastor you should respect the one who is bearing God who God puts here Alleluia the ministers Alleluia and there shall yet there shall be a space between you and it about 2,000 cubits by me sure come not near unto it that kimi no the way by which he must go forth ye have not passed this way heretofore Alleluia now in reporting he says and it came to pass when the people removed from their tents to pass over Jordan and the priests bearing the Ark of the Covenant before the people and as we that birdie art will come into Jordan and the faith of the priests that birdie art were dipped in the brim of the waters for Jordan overflow with all his banks all the time of harvest so it means to say that at this time the current in Jordan River was too strong hallelujah that the waters which came down from above stood and rose up upon and hip very far from the city Adam that is besides are eaten and those that came down toward the sea of the plain even the salt sea failed and were cut off and the people passed over right against Jordan the in the priests that birthed the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord stood firm stood firm in dry ground in the midst of Jordan and all this relies passed over and the priests that bear the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground until all the people were passed clean over Jordan now here is the thing brothers resistors maybe just wah he was commanding okay priests we are now at the bank Jordan and then we can see how strong the current is hallelujah okay priest yogi in the midst of Jordan and stood there firm stood firm in in the middle area of Jordan maybe the priest will say how about if will if I will get drawn in hallelujah in that ribbon he cannot you know he will not float because we have a heavy load that they are bearing but brothers and sisters by faith because it is just what the Holy Spirit told them to do it either it will cause Allah meeya their lives hallelujah we have the ministers have to do it Toby hallelujah just for the sake hallelujah to serve for their brethren there is sometimes or not only sometimes but sometimes the ministers hallelujah D have to you know I mean if it is hard just for the sake of the believers of their brethren and the congregation we have to do it but thank God when we started to step on the water that the water stopped flowing hallelujah and Israel passed over Jordan hallelujah una drag car dry ground and then while the priest was there standing hallelujah and then the children of Israel started to cross children and while justwell was there watching all these relights passing over Jordan hallelujah there the tribe of Judah the tribe of Simeon hallelujah the tribe and all the tribes and not only the children of Israel but the Bible says we have a lot of cattles with them imagine brothers and sisters how long will it take hallelujah for them to pass over Jordan and then here is the priest that Purdy are the Bible says be stood firm how long will that priest will endure Alleluia you know they are carrying a box and that box were we're over was overlaid with gold how he how he be this it was and then on top of it there is the mercy seat and then on top of that nurses better taught cherubims how heavy is that a louia and then inside of that art of the Covenant there were that two table stones hallelujah but resistors we have to endure Alleluia in order for all this relights can pass through Jordan maybe some of the Israelites will say oh how good to be a priest you know he where are you know a finally name a white robes oh he's a good-looking guy you know sometimes especially in the Philippines the pastor Berlin is wearing a tie or other well other believers are they go to church wearing slippers hallelujah yeah maybe the people they are just looking on the outward appearance of the priest but the thing that they don't know there were nice inside of that robes that were shaking because they were tired already you know they don't know what we are suffering inside hallelujah and they have to understand it brothers and sisters maybe brother Samuel II always you know laughing by Jerry or Islam you know smiling to give encouragement to the believers because even though we have a pastors we have a lot of burdens in our hearts we have so much problem hallelujah but when we made the believers we always wear a smile because we cannot encourage we cannot encourage somebody if we are if we show that we are also that we are discouraged but the thing is hallelujah so you have to understand your pastor you have to pray for your pastor hallelujah is bearing all the burden just awliya for all the congregation to pass through Jordan Alleluia and maybe just I was there he will not just one will not allow that priest to get out from their position unless hallelujah all the congregation had been Alleluia the past being over Jordan Halloween so that's why the profits always support your pastor love your pastor and pray for you for him you know brothers and sisters if you have problem ministers are also human if you have family to feed the ministers they also have family to feed if you have you feel hungry the ministers they also have stomach Alleluia so you have to understand hallelujah and pray for them hallelujah we live for the Brethren the priests but Barbarin said when he caught this Revelation chapter 5 verse 10 in a meetings in civics it's mrs. book I think in pergamene church and she says that when he could this and had made us unto our God kings and priests and we shall reign on earth he said that kings and priests plural every son and daughter of God he had made us kings and priests for what purpose purpose to offer up spiritual sacrifices not only the pastor brothers and sisters but we also have hallelujah to offer up he had made us to be a priest kings and priests for a purpose hallelujah what is the job of the depressing the old assignment is to save for the Brethren Alleluia that's why Romans have to offer up as a first Peter said chapter 2 verse 1 ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house house as an holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ hallelujah you know brothers and sisters when we talk about sacrifices like for example if you fail to come to church and you are happy to come that is not sacrifice you are need hallelujah but when you fail I don't like to go this time and that's the time that you have to make sacrifice and when you feel that I don't like that sister now you know he's doing like they got a lot of weaknesses and and I don't like that brother then that's the time that you had to offer up sacrifice to bear if you think you are matured enough then you are the one who ought to bear the infirmities of that brother of that sister Alleluia last verse that I'm going to share this morning I'm going to read Deuteronomy chapter 3 18 to 20 and I commanded you at that time saying the Lord your God had given you this land to possess it ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel all that are meat for the war but your wives and your little ones and your cattle for I know that ye have much cattle shall abide in your cities which I have given you until the Lord have given rest unto your brethren as well as unto you and until they also possess the land which the Lord your God had given them before Jordan and then ye shall and then shall ye return every man unto his position which I have given you now here's the thing brothers resistors when the wealth to Canaan land and to possess it they did not Israel did not possess it at just one time hallelujah we have to fight in every inch hallelujah like for example after conquering this portion here Oh Carrie you mean you position this is now your because the bible says joshua he divided the land according to the word of god that he has given to moses there is a pattern while Jews Wawa's dividing the land there there there was already a pattern early okay whose is it Reuben and then we conquered this portion here okay hop tribe of Manasses it and then though login and fight for another battle okay Judah you possess it a prime Alleluia but those who first who since their inheritance Alleluia you have to live your wives live your children live your cattle and then you have to help your brethren who haven't got possessed yet their inheritance you already have your inheritance you already have occupy or possessed your inheritance but you have to fight hallelujah you still have to fight not for your own battle but for the battle of your brethren until every single seed of Abraham can possess their own inheritance and after that you can go home to your wife and your children and enjoy your position hallelujah what is our position is our lives in the Holocaust those who became mature living halleluyah under the leading of the Holy Spirit Aliyah you will not say oh I don't care about them the important is I am no matured I am enjoying the the life and the Holy Spirit I am filled with the holes brothers and sisters you have to still have to fight hallelujah to help because brothers and sisters until the last police needed Sid Harle away will know his position will have this position the rupture will not take place we have to help one another where every everyone well everyone's burden hallelujah until the time time come hallelujah that we can possess only all hallelujah everybody can possess the same kind of life so god bless you all and I know give the time [Applause] love that amen it's challenging it's challenging to our hearts and if the Word of God is not challenging and it's not the Word of God but it's challenging to our hearts amen and to see that that strength you know and as it was spoken that they which are strong must bear the infirmities of the weak it's not our strength I think the Lord was so clear on pointing that out as Paul remember Paul would tell us dude they that measure themselves by themselves are foolish we measure ourselves by the working of the Word of God in our lives we measure ourselves by him is that right yeah I think that was so tremendous how the Lord brought that out that the nuggets that laid within there you find individuals that were matured or seemingly matured in a lot of things but one thing that was lacking when they went over and when they went over to spy out the land it was - and they were missing the maturity of the life of the promise in their lives and there isn't the church itself this church and the church throughout the world of the Lord Jesus Christ it's not our strength is not in our knowledge but the strength is the Holy Ghost that's our strength you remember when Israel elected Saul to be king they elected him because he patterned like the other nations but remember when God took the kingdom from Saul he said the strength of Israel will not lie and God took David just a little ruddy boy but in David's life David might have been only this tall but he had a place for God that was so big and the strength of Israel could step right in David's life that's he's our strength amen aren't you happy Amen how many say Lord let me be strong let me be strong I want to be stronger Lord in you a man I want to be stronger in you he meant because the reality is you're not going anywhere without me and I'm not going anywhere without you amen we are our brother's keeper amen let's just stand and amen let's just so thankful to the Lord for that we certainly appreciate brother lanlan Amen just yielding to the Lord and the Lord just speaking through our brother amen and let's lay this to heart let's lay the Word of God to heart don't just let it be a service and we just go out every but take it to heart and and let it be the prayer that resonates in our hearts Lord I want to be stronger I don't want to be where my prayers when I'm praying it's always about me but my prayer it turns to where it's not so much about me but it's praying for others amen it's recognizing those means recognizing when someone disagrees with us someone when doesn't see eye to eye maturity is not maturity isn't that there isn't any wrong or there's not any mistakes or there won't be anything that bothers but maturity is recognizing Satan's working it's recognizing that amen and recognizing the God who lives in us as greater amen let's sing that turn your eyes upon Jesus Amen or turn your eyes upon Jesus in his wonderful face and the face will strangely dim in the light of his glory and grace keep your eyes on Jesus look for is wonderful face and the things of will strange [Music] of his glory and ray once again turn your eyes or turn your eyes upon Jesus look full in his wonderful face and the things other weirdo strain [Music] of his glory and rays let go and let God have his wonderful way let go and let God his way your sorrows will vanish your night turn today let go and let God have his way amen we want to be stronger in the Lord amen and I think as it was so clearly spoke to our hearts this morning was taking heed to all the Word of God brother Bram tells us like this he said there's an old believer that can be more spiritually healthy or strong than his knowledge and adherence to the Word of God amen so we just don't we need the knowledge we need to know what God requires of us but then the adherence to it and that is be it unto me according to thy word as God deals with our hearts and we let go see the way many of the times in our thinking our strength is what we can do but we realize our strength is nothing it's not our strength that that brings a change it's not our strength that'll get us out of here but it's the strength of the Lord so that adherence is Lord be it unto me according to your word what God deals with our hearts as he speaks to our lives in the word as it comes to wash us and to cleanse us the man is to give to that word say Lord be it unto me we don't want to walk out here cuz we know we can't walk out of here the same way we walked in we walk out of here closer when we walk out of here further away I want to walk out closer amen I want to walk out closer I want to walk out with a greater determination in my heart Lord I want to do that which is pleasing to you those things that you've brought right down to my pathway this morning I want to adhere to it I want to give my life to you Lord I want to submit to that word amen is that your desire amen let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer Lord precious Lord Jesus Lord we're so thankful this morning Lord the clarity Lord that you have spoke to ass Lord Lord you have Lord as David Lord would Express you have made known to us the path of life Lord you we thank you Lord for taking the gift Lord and brother Langlands life the Lord as he yielded it to you once again this morning standing firm there in the Jordan lord I pray that Lord if there's one Lord that has not crossed over may they Lord recognize that that's their rights it's an inheritance being ministered unto them Lord may they lay aside Lord every weight every sin that would so easily be said may they Lord lay aside all of the faults of doubt and every voice that would be contrary Lord to your calling and beckoning upon their heart may they just Lord surrender and falling into the arms of the Lord Jesus Christ Lord God I pray this morning for every heart Lord our desire Lord is to not just to know your word but to adhere to it Lord we thank you for every time Lord and how you correct us for the
