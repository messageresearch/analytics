========================================

about something that's thrown in the air and well I I hope this is God's will and I no you better not you better not throw anything up like that Hing it's God's will are you with me it's where faith is revealed then you've got an expectation no matter what happens that God is in control God has revealed to my heart that this is his will that even when things go wrong and things that are negative don't you see how powerful it is to really know the will of God that's how power f it is to walk in God's will it doesn't mean that we won't be tested but it means that in the midst of the testing when everything is shaking around us that even where we and ourselves it seems like it's swimming around in our head but there is an anchor on the inside because the will of God is Faith revealed from God and that's why we can have hope to say where I see like there's no hope like job job said there ain't no cattle that can reproduce more ble there ain't no more camels that can reproduce more camels but there was a power inside of job's soul that held job through it all and even when job wasn't aware of it up here it held him and at the end of it when it all broke forth he could say I know my redeemer liveth this is why it's so powerful Faith where it has an anchor in our soul and job was able to stand there and know I've got a great greater expectation sir aren't you glad that Faith delivers an expectation so thankful for the love of God it brings forth a trust this is why when the prophet said when the doctors would shake his head he said can you trust him in that time he said can you trust him when everything else is gone yes Can Am what a what a what a statement he says he says you need an overflowing baptism of love divine love let me just say it like this Lord each and every day of my life I want a fresh refilling I want a fresh refilling of the love of God you say is that scripture Jude said keep yourselves in the love of God it shows there are battles to try to pull us what out of that realm that God has intended for you and I to live in but keep yourselves in the love of God oh glory be to God oh it seems like you pray and your prayer is not answered do you still love him is there something that keeps purging you on notice what is this something that's purging you on that makes you go on when others would have turned around and said if that's how he's going to be and what what good is it for me to serve him that's when there's a selfish motive involved you do not serve God because of what he can do for you you serve God because you realize without him I am absolutely nothing I am a sinner I was on my way to hell but the blood of Jesus Christ was shed for my sin dead and there's a life inside of that blood that is present to change me and deliver me as a new creation I don't serve him because of what he can do for me I serve him because his love came down and projected to me when I was nothing I was in the mud and the m i was unworthy [Applause] I was not worthy you are not worthy but God rich and mercy and that's something in your heart keeps purging you on are you hearing me now when you feel like letting down there's something that purges you on take one more step there something keeps purging you on something tells you well just stay home tonight something purges you on something says you might as well turn loose but there's something got a hold of you that says keep going on there's something you find yourself here you are you find yourself there how do you find yourself there are you hearing me now you wondering about Transportation how did Phillip get here to the unic let me ask you something you might think of look upon that as something great I'm telling you right here tonight there are lives and hearts that you wonder how am I sitting here tonight with a faith in my heart with the strength in my life let me tell you what that is that's the same holy spirit that lifted up Phillip and presented him where he needed to be [Applause] Hallelujah Romans 5 verse one therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in the hope of the glory of God we have access by by by faith faith has given us an access into his presence and we're standing there by his grace you know what Grace is Grace is not Grace is not telling you how unfit you are Grace lets you know what rightfully belongs to you and Grace lets you know the one who is Grace himself or Grace personified through is of him who has made a way and become the very way for your life no matter what the circumstance no matter what the situation the grace of God stands for your life my and you rejoice in hope in an expectation of the glory of God oh not not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience and experience hope wow you see experiences that you've been through are you hearing me now experiences you've been through is what's created the expectation for the trial you're in right now that's right things that you've been through let's call up David a moment David how can you stand here and you're calling this uncircumcised Philistine how you calling out because I've had experiences the bear and the L I've seen the same God I know him and so because of experiences David could say I've got hope in the Lord I'm not walking out here with I wonder if it's going to be David how do you know it's going to happen or how's it going to be I don't know but I know one thing he is an uncircumcised Philistine I'm standing here as a covenant child of God he cannot stand there and tear down the enemies of or the children of God he walked out there with an expectation the same way you can walk to an expectation of a doctor's report the doctor can say this and say that I don't we don't think nothing bad about them they're only read they only can read the instruments and the knowledge that they're given but you've got a different report and you've watched God move on the seen in your own life in the life of others and testimonies throughout here as experiences that you're a part of you might say it didn't happen to me but your prayers was part of it God might have used your hands God might have used your lips you were a part of it there are experiences and those experiences build an expectation Hallelujah glory be to God and hope vers five hope maketh not ashamed cuz this expectation in in confetti thrown up in the air no this is a hope that faith is said here you go what do I do expect all things because this is why because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us there's a cake down off of South Africa Spurgeon writes about it when he when he picks this up there's a cake down there that it was actually called the Cape of storms and there was Sailors that tried to go down through there and sail around that Cape but every time they got to a certain place storms over through the vessels and caused them to turn back but eventually there came some with different vessels and these that came with different vessels they were regarded as Boulder Navigators they they were they had ships that were built for it and when they made the turn around this cape it no longer is called the Cape of storms it now has been called the Cape of Good Hope Hallelujah let me tell you something before our champion came man would run up against death and right there it was but he was hidden away in Paradise but there stepped one from the portals of Glory he was built sufficiently it was not of this building of this Tabernacle it was God's word that had been spoken and prepared for you and I and he passed that Cape where it's no longer trebling a Cape of storms but now it's a Cape of Good Hope and the same almighty God has made a way for you and through your tests through your trials you're standing as a witness where was a Cape of storms it's a Cape of Good Hope because my expectation is in the God who brought me through that trial he's still God in this trial though the circumstances don't look alike but he's still the same God don't have to be the same circumstances he's the same God and I'm still a Believer Philippians 1:19 for I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer and the supply of the spirit of Jesus Christ according to my Earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed but that with all boldness as always so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body whether it be by life or by death for for me to live is Christ and to die is gain Paul said my expectation is in the Lord Paul you might die that don't hinder it Paul what do you mean Paul said come here a minute let me tell you something death at one time was our Master death at one time was like the big old bad Boogeyman but there came one down from Glory that spoiled the principalities that despoiled death and the hell and the grave conquered Satan's Trinity rose up on the Easter morning and sent back the Holy Ghost as a witness and Paul do you know you might die but listen death is no longer my master or I'm no longer subject to it but death has become my servant death can only pull me into the presence of God that's why there's no disease no disease takes a child of God are you hearing me this unfortunate circumstance that didn't take it death is a servant to a child of God death as the prophet described is just like the horse on the carriage that pulls us from this to here and he said it's just like a little shock in the body and you're there oh Hallelujah you say what are you talking about I'm talking about the C of Good Hope all right are you with me now in this generation uh God I believe has allowed me to see beyond the curtain of time and I have seen you all there GL what is it beyond the Cape of storms now in the Cape of Good Hope no matter what we have to go through no matter the tests the trials no matter the disappointments I know where my destiny is how do you know that because the Lord is my portion saith my soul thank you God sometimes things even what we're hoping for even scripturally sometimes things don't happen the way that maybe we think they're going to happen see God Only God when he lets out a promise then God will let out the details as he wants to know but he keeps us in expectation and just because we might get our expectation might get a little off it don't stop God's word are you with me John's eye got filmed over right right John's eye he was in prison he said oh he says go ask him if he's the one or do we look for another after the compliment that was paid but you realize John spoke at the river not because of relation but John spoke because the word had said upon whom Thou shalt see the dove descend the same is he so John was speaking by a revealed word confirmed by the spirit of God coming upon it so it was not John under enthusiasm under emotion of I see of this or I see of that no it was a certain word of God that he spoke but now in the humanity here he is standing back there and you know he he he wasn't seeing things happen the way he thought they ought to happen is that right in the message forgotten beatitude what a beautiful message brother R goes into it he want and seeing things happen the way he thought it should happen now I'm sure every one of us have been there even with certain things we're praying about where we maybe we looking listen your expectation is not wrong but look at it and say Lord that something may not be happening or might go according to how I didn't think it was going to happen but it does not hinder God's promise one bit and let me tell you what God did for John he did not go down there and send the disciples and run him down and say what a sorry guy he was but he built him up in the front of those disciples and he said there's not a man born among women greater than John he said take the word down there what you see taking place take the word why he knew John was a word man he was a prophet brother if there's any encour enouragement that you I are going to see and receive it's got to come by the word if there's anything to take away my doubt or my Gloom it's got to come by the word is that right and here they were walking along and John himself remember John when he received that word it dismissed that Gloom there were some disciples when the resurrection took place they were walking along copius and a friend I always like that scripture I like how brother Brown tells in message Paradox he said he was with a friend well I know to to receive a prophet in the name of a prophet is to receive a prophet's reward and that's to be a friend of a prophet so that that's me I'm there I'm walking with this word how about you I'm walking with this word I I believe that God God's identified so to me these are not just things that just said it's with a friend and I believe I'm a friend not because I'm anything I I believe I'm a friend just like Abram Abram didn't seek out God God sought him out and the Bible said he was called the friend of God is that right now think about this you want to be a friend of God you just do what God tells you to do you Just Surrender Your Heart to God and you know what God speaks friendly to you and you respond back to it and say Amen Lord I accept that be unto me you repent of your sins you're baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you look to the Lord for the Holy Ghost what is it it's receiving God's friendly words then then what if you become a friend of God my my and here they were walking and they said in verse 21 we trusted hoped expected that it had been he which had redeemed Israel beside all this it's a third day since all this has happened I mean to them it was just like it didn't H it didn't happen the way we thought it was and and this is the the third day right you see it's like this seemed like all hope was stripped out of them you know the Bible says in the Book of Proverbs hope deferreth it just makes the heart weak what do I mean by hope deferred well there's an expectation but you see if it seems like it's delayed or it's not happening then that's where the the the heart itself can can become weak but this is why David would could say that Lord my I had I had I my soul had waited on thy salvation but my hope is in the Lord though things aren't coming like I thought they would come but I'm still trusting in you Lord because it maybe ain't how I had it figured out but your word will come to pass there's not enough Devils that can keep it about there's not enough Gloom the devil can put around your life to hold you back from being a real son and daughter of God there's not enough that can keep you back because God has spoken who can but prophesied we trusted we hoped we expected but here is God stepping on the scene didn't disturb him a bit he just looked and he said oh fools and slowth heart to believe all the prophets have spoken you know what he did he went right down through the scriptures and begin to take them right through the scriptures and show everything that happened was exactly according to prophecy is that right so that they would know him by the word that's how you and I know him we know him in the Fulfillment of his word is that right it created a faith in them that just let me tell you what it did that opening of the word right there created such a faith in them that they were ready to receive the evidence and confirmation of the promise of the Holy Ghost in their own life it made them ready to after this event the Bible said they went with joy unto Jerusalem why they had an expectation Faith had handed them a hope is that right it handed them an expectation that's why the revelation of the will of God is Faith and Faith it is produced from love it gives a true pure expectation to the believer I love that don't you I love this scripture right here these these passages out of Psalm 62 you no doubt recognize it this is out of like the message Shalom but I I I love this passage of scripture my soul wait thou only upon God oh yeah I think that's fitting in the message Shalom let me tell you why because the prophet would talk about the advancement of the hour the first message Shalom he spends all that time with those in the trailer court I think about two and a half two two hours and 40 minutes is a long time but he comes at the end towards the end of that message he said now Brethren Brethren be patient andan he talks about all the Fulfillment of the word but then he said be patient he said don't don't don't try to go out and make something happen why would people want to go out and make something happen than my friends in the Fulfillment and seeing God opening his word but one of the things that you and I we are not we are not privy to and that's the exact time moment frame of fulfillment we know we're living in the hour we know we're living in the end time is that right but aren't you thankful that God makes you and I aware of the season and the hour and the time and the promise that we need to be looking for let me tell you the promise that we need to be looking for right now more than anything else is the rapture that's what this message come to produce it came to produce a people that are expecting not people that are becoming adapted to this world but a people that are under an expectation that at any moment at any moment my loved ones are going to appear before me at any moment I'm going to see the Lord Jesus Christ you said that's 30 or 40 days but I'm living in a moment to see him come Hallelujah my soul wait thou only upon God for my I love this for my expectation is from him man didn't give it to me Church didn't give it to me denomination didn't give it to me God have given me this expectation are you with me the Bible said let every Every Man's word be a lie and let God's word be true right every one of us have made promises sometimes and had to call and said brother I'm sorry I'm just not going to be able to come over and cut your bushes today my brother I'm sorry or honey I'm sorry I I just wasn't able to get that painting done on that wall today right and we've had I'll tell you I'll get to it first thing Monday morning but not God right right you and I had things sometimes that come up sickness or calls or unexpected events not God nothing takes God by surprise let me tell you something God's never been in a crisis never God's never been in a crisis God's never had an anxiety attack come on that's why he can keep you and I in perfect peace think about it if he wasn't the Prince of Peace where you can I work could you and I have hope but the Bible said for he is our peace [Applause] Hallelujah my expectation is from him he has delivered to me the expectation for what I'm to be looking for he only he he he only is my rock and my he he is my defense I shall not be moved in God is my salvation and my glory the strength of my The Rock of my strength and my refuge is in God look at Abraham a promise God said I'll bless you right you'll be a blessing you're going to be a father of many nations he received that Revelation stay with me now he received that Revelation you can look back in his life and say well I don't see it oh you didn't see it in full manifestation right but you let it keep working right you let it keep working that's it you let that Revelation keep working of Jesus Christ in your life it'll take you all the way from Genesis 11 to little things that you might look at and God calls you higher God will bring you in situations like genesis 13 separations will come God will bring you in to situations in Genesis 14 where you look at and say but they took lot but God will let you see what it is to live a separated life and just how powerful it is to be separated to the word because when you're separated to the word then you've got jurisdiction Authority and power over every unclean Spirit why because the word is what's reigning in your life God takes you into full manifestation but that Revelation it works out it's growing growing growing growing growing and pushing out so here he is walking around testifying of something that he himself has received by Revelation now is it all the way clear to Abraham at that time no because if it would have been clear then he wouldn't have listened to Sarah when she said take Hagar that's true but let me just tell you what hegar and ishmail was it was just an interruption right it's all was was an interruption your failure just an interruption it does not take away from what God has said about you it does not take away from what the word has said about you your failures right I let down on this and those are interruptions they do not take away from the counsel of God God's word cannot be [Music] defeated but here Abraham walks on with God and he's conf now think about it he doesn't know every little detail but he's already putting down payments at the hospital here's a here's here's a dime what's that for that that's that that's my bill for my wife and I okay you can just almost see after the glass is closed they probably get behind there can you believe this can you believe this these two old people are going to have a baby but you see he had to go through that ridicule you know what that ridicule proved that there was something greater than his feelings there was something greater than his feelings you think at times he didn't turn around and walk out of there and it might have been the first time that he was challenged it might have been like a little bit of a blush but he kept going he would say here's another dime every time he kept going and standing on God's word eventually he could walk out of that doctor's office there wasn't one flush on his face you know what it was it was the word he was feeding on that was building strength in his life and then it came to a place I love how Paul writes it here in Romans 4:8 who against hope believed in Hope what was he beli what was the hope you're Abraham you're getting old and a matter of fact you know your stream of life is Dr up so you can't even produce another ishmail right against hope the expectation where all expectation is removed let me say it in the words the prophet said which is exactly the scripture he says in works as Faith Express all hopes is gone where God took away like what job was seeing that he spoke about the other night all hopes is gone he had nothing that he could sink his teeth into as a well I tell you that this I think it might work out you know how it is sometimes if this boss gets in place it just might hold the thing together you you all know what I'm talking about right but this is where all hopes is gone but look how the scripture writes it who against hope right believed in hope he had an expectation that was greater than the expectation of his mortal life his mortal life could stare at him every day in the mirror and say you're getting older he could look at his humanity and see there's no hope in it but there was a faith on the inside there was an expectation that looked beyond what he was seeing let me tell you God has delivered a word to your life and to my life to cause you and I to look beyond what we've seen look beyond what we know and look into what God has always known and thought about you and I Hallelujah no matter what you were told when you were little no matter what when Mom said oh you were a mistake you're not a mistake it was in God's mind it wasn't a chance hallelujah hallelujah God knew about your life hallelujah hallelujah and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body dead Faith had handed Abraham a true expectation and that Revelation kept growing in his life that and as that Revelation was growing he was feeding on that word you see how was he feeding on Sarah you feeling any different today Hallelujah right it's like us if our wife or our husband sick or something how you feel today oh man I I feel worse than yesterday oh remember those that were prayed for cancer and other things sometimes right afterwards that's when they were the sickest but that was the clearest sign of healing because the bloodstream was under the authority of the word of God for cleansing that's good right that's why brother BR says sometimes he says symptoms can be the biggest enemy to Faith it doesn't mean that symptoms aren't there just don't look at him don't look at him it may not be happening the way don't don't don't worry our expectation is in the Lord he said by his stripes I'm Healed I'm Healed I'm the Lord that Health all th disease that's what he said and he is the Lord is the portion of my soul my Hope's in him amen think about this the Bible says in Hebrews 11:9 by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise that's good now Abraham it do mean that when you read this scripture it don't mean that Abraham wasn't friendly no doubt Abraham would be maybe he was you know like one of them guys you walk in you know to fers hey how you doing I'm doing good how you doing hey I'm doing wonderful how how how you'all been you have a good Memorial Day no he was a friendly guy but what he was Abraham was not going to be subjecting himself to support a fallen world he was out for one Mission and that was I'm looking for a city and I'm here to get everybody that wants to go amen is that right that's what he was there for in other words Abraham saying I'm not like lot I'm not interested to being a mayor of the city I'm not interested in turning around everything of this world I'm not getting tied up that's why the Bible said no man whom God had chosen to be a soldier entangleth himself with the Affairs of this life you have to watch that there are traps around and you know what them traps will do they'll take the expectation oh yeah away from your life brother Samuel I thought you said faith is the revelation of God's will it is and it will hand you in expectation but you've got to feed what God has given you and you feed it by drawing from The Source who spoke to you don't just draw and say well now I'll draw now I'm going over here no you you've got to continue to draw from that same source and when you do then it comes out like it did in Abraham's life watch this he looked for a city which had foundations he expected this is what looked for waited for looked for a city that had foundations cuz while he saw upon the Earth none of those cities had foundations what does that mean they didn't have foundations surely their walls would wouldn't have been able to stand they weren't built on God's word that's there wasn't built upon God's word that's so good there were cities that that had come about but yet here Abraham was looking for this city it was something in his heart do you realize what brother R tells us he said something told Abraham there's a city around here after he met mesic What did the meeting of mesic do it caused Abraham to go into a greater expectation Abraham where are you going early this morning I'm going to go find that City amen but Abraham what city no there's a city that has foundations there's a city that's sure there's a city because I met the king and the priest of that City you see what it did every meeting with God brought his expectation stronger every experience just intensified his expectation and his walk with God to where he got up where's it at he was looking for it and I love how the prophet says it in one little simple statement he says what was it he said that same faith that was in Abraham's heart that eventually led to Bringing forth an Isaac he said then he said came forth that Faith son that Faith seed and it was through that Faith seed that Abraham received entrance into the city he was looking for do you realize that's why the Holy Ghost inside of you that has raised up that seed on the inside that's your token your entrance in the Rapture that's your entrance into the New Jerusalem Hallelujah he made a way Hallelujah he is your righteousness he believed God and he was imputed unto him for righteousness hallelu hallu like Simeon Simeon received that God spoke to him it been promises all the way down through on the coming Messiah remember brother Brown describes he said that church was so small in the message birth pains he only a few people that was really really looking well you Brother Sam I thought you said that I thought that all the way through the scriptures there were people that were looking for the Messiah but you see listen friends and I want you to understand God's grace so so greatly it wasn't Simon that gave himself this this ability to see that's right it wasn't it wasn't Anna that gave herself the ability to see and that kind of expectation they were a part of the program of God and I want to tell you that where they might have been looked at as Outcast and no good and good for nothing and everything El they were looked over but God always knew right where they were and God when it came time to fulfill his word of Prophecy he had a voice on Earth at that time and the spirit of God would move not only there as it would come there and bring forth there within the very womb of Mary but here would come forth John all of these Witnesses were coming it created such a condition in the hearts of the Believers and they were looking and it created a greater expectation an expectation that caused them to stand in the face of ridicule an expectation that caused them to stand and know how can you follow this man how can you do this how can you believe this oh this man we we heard you know his mother was pregnated by a drunken Soldier you see what the word did to them it gave them an expectation to where that when the world to try to draw their attention down here their eyes had been lifted up to see only the promise of God's word hallelujah you take Simeon he went back in his office like he normally did maybe he made his cup of tea in the morning cup of coffee however you do it and about that time Glory the whole Holy Spirit the same one the Bible said revealed to him you're not going to die oh let me preach now a little bit you're not going to die until you've seen the Lord's Christ his salvation I don't care what kind of virus came near him I don't care what kind of a condition I don't care what kind of a report came you brother s Brother Sam you say that don't say that in the Bible but let's bring it down to reality Caleb was promised that mountain he got older but it never did away with the [Applause] promise Hallelujah I don't care how long you waited on the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost is still for you I don't care how many times you've been disappointed but it's still for you the promise of God belongs to you and the prophet said when God has spoke that to your heart you've got a right to expect the Holy Ghost you've got a right to expect it you've got a right to expect Deliverance [Applause] Hallelujah it doesn't matter what tried to take Simeon away and words could have come around him ridicule could have come around him trying to do everything they could to distract him it wasn't that he had some great DNA he had a promise he was feeding on it it created such an expectation to where he was able to look above the things of this life and say I'm looking for him [Music] do matter what came Caleb's way Caleb said I got a promise Caleb might have come up there his whiskers might have been long I don't know and everything else but when it came time to take promises and notice not just when they crossed the Jordan but notice how the spirit gives unction this is your time Caleb what I promised to you the spirit gave unction and Caleb went up to Joshua and said I remember what the prophet said to me he said that where my foot hath trod that belongs to me let me just bring that down to you the experiences you've had in your life the Holy Spirit sweeping over your life the spirit of God dealing with your heart those are places where your foot have tro and the spirit of God it rises in your heart to say that promise that mantle did not come upon my life for nothing that mantle has fallen upon my life it causes me to seek after that promise are you hearing me tonight [Applause] friends Caleb Grew Older that's true a lot of things Rose that's true but it didn't take it out of his heart he fed on that he became stronger cuz he said even that day he said I'm more able now than I was when it was made to me you're 40 years older I'm more ready now Caleb it's been 40 years I'm more ready for the Rapture now than I've ever been it's been 40 years Caleb there's been Church troubles there's been Church splits there's been this happen in your family you there's been certain things that didn't go your way I'm more ready tonight hallu can where's your secret oh you didn't know that secret stash I've been feeding on I've been feeding on the word that was given me I've been drawing and I've been eating on that word that's been secret food that was stored up I've been eating on that food I've been nourishing on that food as a matter of fact i' get beside myself in that tent I'd have a shou and spell praise to God glory to God why because the same inspiration it lays there in the word of God as when it was spoken originally that same one who is the inspire has inspired me day after day when I didn't feel like I could make another step Hallelujah he inspired me yes sir what did he do Caleb it built my hope my expectation is stronger Caleb but you know them Giants there you know they've got kids now I expect a greater Victory Caleb we're living in a world of Darkness where all sorts of devils have been released the pit has been opened up but God would not have placed me here to be defeated my God has never spoke a word he's never breathed a word into my heart that's ever took a hope away from me let me tell you something God will never breathe into your life anything that will take away an expectation from a promise of God a devil might try to come along and whisper in your ear but God will never ever take Hope from his children but God is always here to breathe hope in into the lives of his children where you may have lost hope God himself says I am your hope and he breathes into your life you love him my hope let's just stop there tonight my hope is in the Lord am what's Simeon doing out of his office today he's acting strange well you know he's kind of strange anyhow you know what he's been talking about he been talking about there's a Rapture coming and he was a part of it and he's been talking about this of the Messiah but you know he's always had a certainty about his life especially even it's grown stronger it's not an arrogance but a certainty about his life where he would come out here and he just kind of look and he just waiting but I'm noticing something today his steps are so directed this morning let's watch and Simeon led by the holy ghost that revealed the promise to him that let him know today is the day amen that is so good today yes sir is the day and led Simeon right yes right to right what he said he would see yes and when he saw it now thy servant can depart in peace mine eyes have seen thy salvation what did that Faith Delivered a hope the Holy Spirit took the word that was already spoken written and breathed and Simeon was a vessel that caught it nourished it cherished it I wonder in his office I wonder if he had excuse me for saying it this way because I know they don't have Pages like this but let's just say it was almost like this I wonder if he had Pages Doge geared like we might have markers I know they don't have it like this at Scrolls I realize that but I Wonder has Simeon no doubt he was going through all the promises of what had been spoken to that is so good and when he came out this is your day hallu I wonder if the same holy spirit is speaking to your heart this is your day this is your moment amen maybe this is your day for salvation to surrender your life and your heart to God maybe this is your life this is this is your day where the spirit of God there's been a longing and a craving and maybe just kind of brush it off but right now you recognize this is this is my day the Holy Spirit not brother Samuel but the Holy Spirit making it real to you this is your day brother Samuel it's a Thursday night it don't matter if it's Thursday night Sunday night it don't make no difference to God God's God's still God he's still God hallelujah he don't have to come on Sundays alone God comes wherever he's invited and he's welcome let me tell you something God has arranged this moment here tonight with you in mind with me in mind if the spirit of God would be speaking to your heart today is your day maybe it's for healing in your body Hallelujah maybe it's for deliverance of a besetting sin maybe it's for the Holy Ghost you know how he spoke to you he speaks to your heart today is your day what do I do follow him let your heart follow him because he will lead you into the promise that he has made and confirmed to your heart let's pray Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we've spoke Lord God what you would Lord lay Upon Our Hearts and you certainly Lord have taken us in Precious Places Lord to Lord breathe on only Upon Our Lives but in our lives now Lord I pray right here tonight or Jesus mayy right here there's a Simeon where it's been made known revealed to him by the Holy Ghost and Lord here to feed upon that promise [Music] now comes that moment today is the day maybe there's something Lord that stirred that heart that you ever think about where you come from and where you're going do you really know God do you really know who Jesus is or is it just a Sunday school story of what you've heard as far as you know but something that can be a pondering and then right here in this moment you realize there's someone who knows me who's speaking something let me tell you it's not a something it's it's the Lord Jesus a man cannot know you a man cannot speak to you a man cannot move your heart within that way a man might move your emot itions but cannot move your heart in a place to [Music] believe but I wonder right here tonight if you don't know him you would be in that place to say I want to surrender my life to the Lord Jesus I don't want to continue to walk my own way I want to surrender my life to him I want you to know the altar is open here tonight it's not necessarily the altar itself that has any virtue in it but an altar itself speaks of sacrifice and the real sacrifice starts in your heart where you sacrifice your own will that's where real the real altar takes [Music] place right here tonight perhaps the Holy Spirit just I know he is calling out today this is your day Lord for the Holy Spirit oh Grant it Lord Jesus Grant it Lord father this is your word you've given you said [Music] Lord for as many as the Lord our God shall call Lord you're still calling now I pray father Minister Lord to each life maybe the spirit of God would call to you may besetting sin something that it just seems like it just so easily beset you the Holy Spirit would call to your heart and breathe hope into your life to expect full Deliverance I wonder tonight you just claim that receive that same for the Holy Ghost to receive that to claim that same thing for salvation not just something that we just just recite out with our words but Lord God here the altar of my heart you're welcome to come here we would pray I'll pray with you but I know God is here to meet us according to his word he's here to give salvation he's here to give the Holy Ghost he's here to give healing Deliverance he's still the same God father Lord Jesus what you've inspired and laid on My Heart [Music] Lord I may not have done Lord a very good job of it but I just wanted to be led by [Music] you Lord Jesus you've delivered delivered your word to our hearts I I've said Lord what you what you give me to say but now it's up to us Lord what will we do with it Lord granted Lord the same Grace that was brought that brought it to us may we receive that same Grace in the name of Jesus Christ amen don't you love him Hallelujah oh [Music] my from [Music] this oh my is in the Lord forever ever [Music] more oh all within the presence of the Lord yes [Applause] Lord oh my oh
