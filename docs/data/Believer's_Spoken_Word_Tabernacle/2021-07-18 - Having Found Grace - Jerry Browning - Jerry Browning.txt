[Music] my lord wonderful [Music] wonderful [Music] wonderful [Music] amen amen he is wonderful isn't he amen what a what a privilege and an honor it is to serve the lord jesus amen it was that song that we were singing amen behold elijah's god is here with us today amen it's it's it's a reality you know it's one thing to recognize what where god was and what god was doing but it's another thing to recognize where god is amen in order to go from where he was to where shall be you must recognize the present amen and god is present in his body of believers amen one thing that we can we can all agree on is that the message of the hour came to bring us into a relationship with jesus christ it came as a reality for you and i god manifested himself to reveal himself that he's the same yesterday today and forever what has that done for you and i it built our faith in the word of god amen we are we are standing like abraham stood amen we're a blessed people in this hour amen to be able to to recognize those things and to stand here and though you go through tests and trials and though there's discouragements that come i won't ask you to raise your hand but all throughout this building there's tests and trials and there's times that that maybe you felt like you were going to give up and you were discouraged but you must remember is that he that begun the good work in you he'll finish it amen and when you look at the tests and trials you know when we see him in in even in the right light and i think it becomes more and more clear as you recognize that in the midst of a test of trial where the frailty of our our vessel is exposed our humanity that includes your body your spirit but yet in the midst of that god's strength prevails and you can stand back and look and say you know what it's not i who liveth but christ who liveth in me and so then the test and the trial itself has come out and it's a blessing amen because once again it's shown that the deity of jesus christ is present in your life amen we just love him don't we amen sometimes we don't feel like in the midst of joy in the midst of test or trial but you know joy isn't about bubble dancing joy is a condition that rests upon i know in whom i have believed and i am persuaded that he is able to keep that which i've committed against that day amen we certainly just love you in the lord and just want to remind you and um out there in the uh in the restrooms we put up just some of the announcements of some of the things that's coming on here with different ministers and things that some things that we'll we'll have in here beginning in september and some different brothers okay uh deacons brothers if you'll just come our sister needs prayer let's just play that song only believe amen would you sing that through for us one time please let's take it we ask lord jesus [Music] [Music] more [Music] oh [Music] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] jesus the devil is a liar amen amen i want to remind also the youth meeting this coming friday there at our home my wife and i are home there at uh 7. i put that on the now that's put on the announcement as well i want to welcome our visitors here this morning amen god bless you amen good to have you here with us amen and good to have brother jerry and sister mina here [Applause] and i just i'm looking forward just to just to feeding amen just to just to drawing on the gift of god now remember god knows what your need is amen the whole part of this service is tailored to meet your need so let's just draw let's just draw from el shaddai this morning and whatever you have need of god is present to meet that need amen you believe that as brother jerry would come let's just continue to sing that song only believe [Music] all things are possible [Music] thank you father [Music] amen could we just stand and let's just sing this lord i receive lord i received [Music] lord i received that all things all things no matter what the need is [Music] i received all things are possible lord i [Music] you may am seated for a few months it's been requested i sing a song i didn't i didn't bring i got all the words on my phone i didn't bring it out here with me so we'll just have to go by memory but it was requested that i sing the song my heart is like a house amen amen [Music] my heart is one day i let the savior in [Music] there are many bruins we would visit now and then but then one day he saw that door i knew the day had come too soon i said jesus i'm not ready us to visit in that room cause that's a place in my heart where even i don't go i got some things in there i don't want no one to know but then he handed me the king the tears of love on his face he said i want to make you clean let me go in your secret place and as we opened up the door and the two of us walked in i was so ashamed his light revealed my hidden sins but when i think about that room now i'm not ashamed anymore because i know my hidden sin no longer hides behind that door it was a place in my heart where even i wouldn't go i had some things in there i didn't want no one to know but then he handed me the key his love on his face and he made me clean i let him in my secret place [Music] is there a place in your heart where even you don't go you got some things in there you don't want no one to know well he's handing you the cake those tears of love on his face he'll make you clean let him go in your secret place [Music] well he made me clean i let him in my secret place praise the lord well we're happy to be here this morning and this place in this church and people hold a special place in my heart and uh this is where that i got started at and uh many of you were there the first time that i ever preached and uh trust the lord that we've grown a lot since then and uh we're been come down the road many miles and through many trials and tests and tribulations and and growing pains brother branham called them growing pains of god's grace amen and i i can say i don't regret a mile i don't regret anything though everything god's had his hand on my life and uh he you know if you belong to god uh he's going to get you he won't let you go and one way or another he he if he's got to bring you down and get you humble to get you he'll do it god won't let go of those that belong to him they may be able to run for some time but eventually they'll come to the end of the rope amen praise the lord let's stand and just uh go to the lord in prayer before we open this scripture this morning heavenly father lord we are so thankful to be here again with the believers lord here and father we ask god that you would come this morning anoint us lord god with your spirit lord with the holy spirit lord that we may be able to yield to you and lord that you may be able to speak knowing lord that's the only way that anything will be a help to the people and lord that's our desires for you to receive all glory for the people to be helped lord for them to be encouraged and lifted up i pray god that you would just lead us in that way lord supply the needs lord that you know that they have today lord we ask it in jesus christ's name amen i'd like to read from genesis chapter 6 beginning at verse 1. what i want to speak on today is having found grace and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and the daughters were born unto them but the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose and the lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he also is flesh yet his day shall be a hundred and twenty years there were giants in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of god came in unto the daughters of men they bear children unto them the same became mighty men which were of old men of renown and god saw the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and it repented the lord that he had made man on earth and he grieved him at his heart and the lord said i will destroy men whom i have created from the face of the earth both man and beast and creeping thing and fouls of the air for it repenteth me that i have made them but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord these are the generations of noah noah was a just man and perfect in his generation and noah walked with god amen you may be seated the bible tells us the earth was filled with violence during this time it tells us that the earth was corrupt that all flesh had corrupted their way brother branham says if you ever notice whenever men begin to multiply people begin to get together great gatherings of people and remain and that city becoming populated more population the first thing you know it begins to bring in diversities for recreation from that it goes into gambling and from gambling into drinking and from drinking into prostitution and breaking up of homes and marriages and divorce and then murder and it keeps growing and growing and growing like a chain of no end but when god walked with man alone by himself he had favor with god but when man begins to multiply and begins to get others and others and others satan having more of a range to work in the man begin to believe a little bit leaning in this way and the other a little bit this way and then when satan comes in he just fires it on then it becomes this and that and imaginations begin to come great and then corruption sets in we know in the the bible tells us that the thing that hath been is that which shall be and that which is done is that which shall be done and that there is no new thing under the sun many times when we think about noah's day we think in terms of being more primitive but that's just the opposite of what it was the prophet tells us that noah's day was very advanced he says they could shoot rockets into the sky and know there was no moisture up there they if they could shoot rockets in the sky then that means they could build great ships themselves the prophet even said they had their own boats and then so it was it was not a primitive time but when god began to the reason a lot of people think of it being more primitive is because of the design of the ark and if you think about that age being so far advanced then when the people of that day would begin to see the ark being built to them it would have looked primitive it would not have looked like their ways it wouldn't it would not have looked safe to them no doubt in that day they had a ship that could not be sunk because there's nothing new under the sun so i'm sure you know today what the titanic is most remembered for is sinking and so noah began to build this but this ark was so great in size that it was an eyesore to the city no doubt looking the way it looked and being so large they could see it from everywhere in the city so they were constantly reminded that noah what's telling them it's going to do something that it's never happened before they were constantly reminded that noah was preaching to them that it's going to rain and notice that peter says noah preached 120 years and so you can imagine noah getting up maybe a year 100 and saying you know the sky looks clear today like it always has they said maybe noah's going to preach something different today and then he would say but i'm going to tell you something the sun's not always going to shine because it's going to rain yes there he goes again preaching the same thing again but it's because it was the message of the hour and that's what we've got to preach if we don't have something different to preach we've got the message of the hour to preach and the message of the hour is this message of salvation it is a message of escape it is a message of deliverance it is a message that will set you free it's a message that will take you home it's a message that will change you eternally and god in his sovereign grace looked down and saw noah now i want you to realize something it isn't the way i just said it would make it seem like that god was looking over the face of the earth and he saw all the wickedness and everything and all man and then after he decided he was going to destroy it then he noticed noah no noah was part of god there was a part of god in noah amen and so that's why noah found grace in the eyes of the lord and god in his grace not wanting anyone to perish really i know the bible says he was going to destroy man but he weighed a wave escape so that all that would believe would have a way to escape the prophet says he made a way of escape so that everyone of that age that desire to escape could escape and the bible tells us that that day is going to repeat again as it was in the days of noah amen the bible tells us so shall it be the days of the son of man they didn't eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day noah entered into the ark and the flood come and destroyed them all said it's going to repeat again but don't forget it also says as it was in the days of life in a days of lot if you recall when the two angels went down to bring lot out of sodom that the men of the city saw these two angels to them they appeared as men and they went to lot's house and said bring them men out to us so we can know them i know this isn't politically correct anymore as they call it but sodom was full of homosexuality and that's what's come upon this earth again today and in sodom there was nothing there's nothing new they had their rights they wanted their rights and they thought it was a right to them to have whoever they wanted and they wanted these men remember lot offered them his daughters and they were virgins and they were married his two daughters were married but lot said i'll give you my two daughters who have never known a man it meant that their husbands were homosexuals they said no we don't want your daughters we don't want your women we want those two men and the bible says they pressed so hard they were beginning to bust the door down and the angels had to blind them so that they could go out and take lot and his family with them but also it says remember lot's wife was too brought out but there was part of her that stayed back there and that was her heart [Applause] and she turned to look back and they were told don't even look back to see god's judgment friends we're going to be leaving this world and not even looking back to see the judgments of god that set in we're not going to be here when the tribulation period takes effect the prophet said cut me open fill me full of suffer and set me on fire but don't let me go through that tribulation it's going to be a terrible time but we won't be seeing it because we won't be here [Music] but lot's wife looked back because she didn't want to leave and there are people today that have heard this message and have come out with us but they're turning back and they're going back to the same pig walla they came out of they're going back to the denominations they're turning back away from the message they're they're getting on the internet and they're trying to tear apart and tear down anything associated with this message and with the profit of this hour it's happening again and she was turned to a pillar of salt look at the day we're living in see how bad it's getting it says in the days of noah there was violence in the earth doubt there was peaceful protests guess i should have put air quotes around that tearing down statues and tearing down different things and and setting things on fire and destroying buildings it's violence killing one another over what we're all human beings but you see the nature that's in the world it's different than the nature that you find in the lord that's right the racism you find out in the world you don't find that in the people of the lord don't bring them racial ideals into here because friends look if there is racism among the people of god then we're all in that's trouble there should be no racism among the people of god you want me to tell you whose lives matter the children of god's lives and he don't care what color you are he doesn't care what race you are what nationality you are he doesn't care what language you speak because the only reason we speak different languages is because of the tower of babel but we're going to go to a place where we'll all speak the same language [Applause] and it won't be a language that has slurs in it it won't be a language that has all these derogatory or curse words or any of this type of thing it'll be a pure holy language hallelujah oh hallelujah you know i just said those things to warn you watch those things that they don't creep into your mists because that's what satan would like to do is get that to creep into the churches and start tearing apart the churches noah found grace brother branham said that in that day no doubt they had a reno nevada or the likes thereof gambling and prostitution and drinking and all these things going on crime in the streets murder murdering one another we know where that started that murdering started back in the garden that murdering started back with cain who was of that wicked one hallelujah but there were scoffers in those days denying the words of truth denying that what mo noah was preaching was going to be a reality to them noah was preaching something that was a fantasy it was just something of fiction because up until that time the earth had been watered from a mist that rose up from the ground but god told noah it's going to rain in other words noah water's going to fall out of the sky and it's going to keep doing it for 40 days and 40 nights and i'm going to flood the whole earth over how many has ever witnessed the flood somewhere where you lived or around or something it rains for days and days and the water raises up and then you start getting flash floods on the rivers and in the creeks that you used to be able to wade across now they're dangerous creeks that you could drive cars across and now they would take a four-wheel drive right down the creek with them we constantly in tennessee when we have flash floods there's always somebody losing a truck because we have a lot of those what i call underwater bridges you drive across the creek to get from one side of the road to the other and you drive through the creek and they're used to driving through these creeks and then they go to do it when the flash flood and the water's up and the next thing you know they're on top of their truck and they're having to go down there in boats to rescue these people and the thing about it is friends they got signs up that warned the people where these creeks are they got signs of warning them high water but people don't listen to warnings and that's what they're doing today there's warnings going out but people are not listening to the warnings [Applause] god they don't want to hear about there's coming an end to this earth they don't want to hear about that god's bringing judgment but it doesn't matter what they want to hear it's going to happen anyway [Applause] god gave noah a message of grace a wave escape salvation i'm so glad that i'm saved i'm so glad that i can say this morning i'm saved because it shows if you can say i'm saved this morning it shows you found grace in the eyes of the lord [Applause] noah found grace and god run away to of salvation for noah now we know that god knows everything it's his foreknowledge he knows who will and who won't god chooses according to election you believe in election don't you well you do if you believe the bible because it's in the bible and god knows everything that's going to happen so god knew in the days of noah he knew who was going to accept that message and he knew the vast majority was not going to accept it so god when he gave noah the dimensions to build the ark he gave him the dimensions that would house a family of eight and two of every animal that lived on the face of the earth and the bible says this it says bring into the ark male and female it didn't say bring into the ark a bunch of males bring to the ark a bunch of females if it had there have been more animals extinct all the animals would have been extinct he said bring male and female look i'm going to tell you something friends it's all throughout the bible but they don't want to believe it and if they continue to have their way about it they can arrest me for saying these things if they continue to either way about it they can force their way into your church i had a visitor come to our church i didn't know him it was somebody from the neighborhood but i didn't know him and i got up and preached that day and it just so happened that day that i preached on sodom i found out he got up and left i found out later he that he was a known homosexual there in that community well if i would have known he was a homosexual i'd still preach the same thing because i don't want that spirit in my church what they should have been doing was getting out in the middle of god's grace while there was grace to be had they should have got out in the middle of god's grace and cried for mercy there's going to come a flood noah but my grace is sufficient my grace is sufficient to take you through this flood hallelujah the lord never leaves himself without a witness it may come down sometimes to one man like noah but god's never without a witness it may come down sometime that you are the only one working in the place where you work as and you are the only witness of god there but god's never without a witness god always has a witness he always has somebody that he can say this is my servant he goes where i say go he goes when i say go he does what i tell you to do regardless of what anybody says he does it anyhow this is my beloved servant he always has somebody amen now brother branham said in that day just like today they were saying noah thinks he's the only one that's got truth noah thinks he's the only one that's going to be saved that's what they say about you what do you think you're the only one that's got the truth you think you're the only one that's going to be saved you know what the prophet's answer to that was he says these signs shall follow them to believe and he said that's not my word that's his word they would have said noah you think you're the only one that's gonna be saved he says well i'll tell you this only whoever gets in this ark is gonna be safe and i'm going to tell you something friends only those who get in christ are going to be saved not those who get in church but those who get in christ a pastor can't save you only god can save you jesus christ is the one who died for our sins amen the prophet can't save you jesus christ is the only one that can save you you've got to get into christ but what it was noah was given a message of grace and you know what they did they'd done despite into the spirit of grace they made fun of noah they mocked him they didn't believe they said we've got boats if it does flood we'll just get in our boats and we'll just float along with you but you see their boats weren't made to stand through the flood have you ever studied on gopher wood it's a very porous wood no doubt when they saw noah getting gopher wood to make the ark they thought this guy is really insane that's the last wood you'd want to make an ark with to make a boat but he wasn't making a boat but god told him you take pitch and you pitch it within and without and you see gopher wood being porous it soaked up all the pitch and made it impermeable to water [Applause] it become one with the pitch amen we've got to become one with this word this word is our ark this word this message is our way of escape [Applause] we've got to become one with christ hallelujah the bible says in hebrews for if we sin willfully after we receive the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin but certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries he that despised moses law died without mercy under two or three witnesses of how much sore punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who had trodden under foot the son of god and have counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and have done despite and to the spirit of grace the prophet says in sirs we would see jesus he said they tramped the blood of the covenant wherewith they were sanctified with and called it an unclean thing and done despite to the works of grace grace would have saved them the works of grace but they've done despite unto the works of grace there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin and people are doing despite to the very works of grace that that's called them to sanctification there's people that have come to this message friends and have turned their backs and walked away and and while they're doing it they sound ever so religious [Music] but then you know like everybody almost they post everything they do on social media so with their newfound revelation that goes beyond this message it now allows them to drink beer at least according to the pictures on social media it allows their women to wear clothes that they used to preach against they used to preach against skirts that had zipper in the front because they said oh it's a garment pertaining to a man but now they're wearing pants now they're wearing shorts what is it they're doing despite to the spirit of grace the grace where with god called them give them an opportunity they heard the words of truth they were enlightened with the truth now there remaineth no more sacrifice for their sins it wasn't noah's works that saved him it wasn't cause noah was a good moral man it wasn't because noah had never been thrown in jail it wasn't because noah was handsome it wasn't because he was better looking than the rest or belonged to a better church or had more money or belonged to a better organization it was god's grace that saved noah god's grace now why was it that noah found grace in the eyes of the lord we said because he belonged to god if you have found grace in the eyes of the lord it's because you belong to god [Applause] hallelujah it isn't because that you're you've been a good person it isn't because you've never done anything evil or wicked or or been in muck and mire of sin or was under some other kind of dogma of creed of a religion it's because of god's grace and you're here this morning because you found grace in the eyes of the lord god's extending grace and if you are here this morning and have said i have not found i don't know grace grace is being extended this morning the prophet gives a story about the little eagle we're all familiar with it about the little eagle they took an egg the farmer did and he put it under a hen and it hatched out this eagle in the barnyard and the eagle was down there and he saw the chicken scratching around they clucked he couldn't cluck they click click click look look but he couldn't speak their language it didn't sound right to him but it's all he'd ever heard right so it must be okay but it done something about it just ain't right but when that mother eagle flew over and she screamed there was something about that voice he had never heard that voice before but when he heard it that one time it brought something out in him and he screamed just like she screamed all of a sudden he's talking the same language she's talking he understands what's being said all the chickens around they didn't understand what was being said they didn't understand what what do you mean about seven seals seven church ages i don't understand that language but he understood it spoke something to him when it said i'll send malachi 4 5 before i destroy this earth that meant something to him he might not have been able to to sit down and explain it to you but something about it spoke to him something about it said i know that's true i want to know more i'm not satisfied yet i want more that's why jesus said if you knew who was talking to you you'd ask me for a drink and i'd give you a drink of water that you'd never thirst again i don't know why because it's an endless fountain of water it doesn't stop it keeps going on throughout eternity [Music] we don't know it all yet we might know a whole lot more than when we started out but there's still more to be revealed [Applause] not on this side the mysteries to be revealed on this side have been revealed but there is more that will be revealed once we go from this dimension to the next the half has not yet been told we talk about the body change of what we're going to be but i'm going to tell you something talking about it and thinking about it and and you know just uh dwelling on it ain't going to be nothing like it happening when it happens when it happens it's going to give you a feeling you couldn't get from thinking about it [Applause] hallelujah praise the lord every now and then i look back at pictures of myself when i was in my early 20s just so i'll recognize myself in the mirror one day what happened something in that eagle was quickened but the prophet says there has to be something there to be quickened there was nothing in them chickens to be quickened to that voice but there was something in that eagle that was quickened there was something in you to be quickened by when you heard the word of the hour and why was it that it was different for you because you found grace in the eyes of the lord because you belong to him hallelujah and you hath he quickened who were dead and trespassed in sin where in time past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince and power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversations in time past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of wrath even as others but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherein he loved us notice loved us there wasn't a time that god came along and said i think i'll love you now he always loved you he loved you before the foundation of the world [Music] praise our god he loved you before you were a gleam in your daddy's eye he loved you before your great great great great granddad and grandma were ever even born he loved you he loved you with an eternal love it means he never started loving you and he's never going to stop loving you there's nothing you could do to make him love you more and there's nothing you've done that can make him love you less hallelujah even when we were dead and sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace you are saved and hath raised us up together and made us set together in heavenly places in christ jesus that in the ages that come he might shoot the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through christ jesus for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourself it is a gift of god amen it is a gift of god now your character is not a gift it's a victory that's why you go through tests and trials and tribulations here think about it i'd rather go through some tribulations now than to be in the tribulation that's coming amen well that's another message hallelujah now i'd like to go to genesis chapter 18. genesis chapter 18 verse 1 and the lord appeared unto him in the plains of memory now speaking about abraham and sarah here and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day and he lifted up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground and said my lord if now i have found favor in thy sight pass not away i pray thee from thy servant let a little water i pray you be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree and i will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort ye your hearts after ye shall pass on for therefore are ye come to your servant and they said so do is thou a shed and abraham hastened to the tenant of sir and said make ready quickly three measures of fine meal knead it and make cakes upon the hearth and abraham ran into the herd and fetched a calf tender and good and gave it unto the young man and he hastened to dress it and he took butter and milk and the calf which he addressed and set it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat god came down brother branham says he picked up some dust and some potash and and some petroleum and some other elements and he blew into them and made a body to step into then he made two bodies for the two angels that were with him and then they went to meet with abraham and abraham said if i've found favor in thy sight notice again it has to do with finding favor in the eyes of god finding grace in the eyes of god find favor in thy sight listen friends abraham had already found favor it shows that he had found favor because god came to him god came to him and then he said where's sarah your wife says he's in the tent behind you and he said i'm going to visit you about the time of life and sarah is going to have a son and the bible says that sarah heard it in the tent door behind him and said she laughed within herself in her heart now she laughed me an old woman my lord an old man and we're going to have a son and god they're eating bread drinking milk and eating a calf and butter and all these things and notice he said terry with me god and the angels waited there patiently how long does it take to dress out a calf takes a little bit of time then you got to cook that thing that takes some time you got to make those cakes and you got to bake them take some time god waited patiently hallelujah god waits patiently on us hallelujah and he said why did sarah laugh sarah denied it but friends what he did showed that abraham had favor with him he revealed the thoughts of sarah's heart and in our day in our age brother random stood on the platform and said if he's the same god that appeared to abraham and told the thoughts of sarah's heart that was behind his back in the doors of the tent then if he's the same god today he can do the same thing and brother branham turned his back to the audience and began to call people out tell them who they were and what they had an ailment with and then he turns around and said see he's the same god today what was it in the days when the son of man is being revealed and he revealed to abraham what he was going to do it shows that he had favor with god because god revealed himself to abraham he revealed what he was going to do to abraham god has come down and opened up your eyes in an age where people are spiritually blind and he's opened up your eyes and he's revealed this truth to you it shows that you have found favor with god it shows you are a favored people it shows you are a favored woman a bride to be to christ one man found favor with god brother branham said now i want you to notice that is the beginning of christianity of the church i want you to notice it wasn't because abraham was a good man it was because god elected and chose abraham it wasn't abraham choosing god it was god choosing abraham can you see it now as it was then so it is today it isn't you choosing god it's god choosing you if god has chosen you he chose you because you are have found favor in his sight and you didn't find favor because you were super religious you found favor because you were elect and that's why god called you and brother brahm said this might be very strong but i want you to notice immediately after election and choice it's separation from everything else as soon as he calls he elects and calls and then when he calls he separates from everything else as soon as he calls he separates you from everything that hangs on to you that proves it isn't a denomination it isn't two or three people together he expects every individual it's an individual affair with every person seek out your own salvation with fear and trembling you don't you don't get in because your mom and dad was good you don't get in because mom and dad loved you right you get in because god chose you it's an individual affair now that should be good news yes brother branham says that every baby if it dies goes to heaven is that right how many believes that right he said it could be born to the most wickedest two people in the town but if it dies as a baby it goes to heaven well i can tell you this people could be born to the two wickedest people on the face of the earth but that doesn't mean that they're not the elect of god and god can't call you you could be born to maybe the most religious person but it doesn't have anything to do with whether god's going to open your eyes or not you could be born to a denominational person you could be born to any kind of organization now i don't say that looking down on them they can only see what they can see i don't know how it all fits together but brother branham says god's got quarters and nickels and dimes and and pennies and he says don't throw them away they all make change he said they're all in god's economy you know i don't know how they fit but he said they do and so i just believe it but it doesn't matter what mom and daddy believe mom and daddy couldn't believe some dogma of something but it has nothing to do with god choosing you he chose you by election i was come to me about a brother i can't think of his name right now he's from south carolina but he he has a quite a testimony how his father killed his mother and he saw it happen and then he became on the streets became involved in gangs and became i believe kind of like an enforcer in a gang you come from a horrible horrible horrible experience and from a horrible life but one day god called him brother burley williams that's who i was thinking of and he passes the church and he's got quite a ministry for young people you ought to be thankful that god elected you you ought to be thankful that he called you amen amen brother brown said i thank god that i was elect i thank god he chose me i never chose him he chose me [Music] you never chose him he chose you no man can come to me except my father draws him first and all the fathers give me will come to me you see if god calls you he'll knock on your door and that's the time for you to come he doesn't knock on people's door all at the same chronological age different times different ages different seasons each one of you have your time in your your season for god to call on you some he calls young praise god i think god he calls some young and they'll never know the depths of the wicked vileness of this world i thank god my children never knew the wickedness that i got into and knew they never went down those paths and i thank god they didn't some he calls an older age he called one man at the age of 80. said you see that stick in your hand i want you to take it and i want you to go down to egypt and deliver my people [Applause] 80 year old man one-man army he wasn't going down there with his past knowledge of how to fight as a warrior he was going down there as a warrior for god he was going down there as a warrior for the i am hallelujah the thing you want brother brown says his favor with god you don't care what the holy spirit calls you to do to shout scream cry ball anything it wants you to do anything the holy spirit puts on you you do it because you don't care you lost all that man-made stuff you're free in christ jesus the spirit of god has set you free and you're free in the power of god bathing in his beauty worshipping him in spirit and in truth you're a free person you took the word of god and it took a hold in your heart you don't care you're not ashamed you're not afraid hallelujah why because you found favor with god i like the story about the woman at the well one of the things i really like about it is that jesus said i have need to go to samaria amen hallelujah he had a need to go down there why because there was an elixir to god down there somebody that the father had chosen she was an adulterous woman she was an ill-famed woman she was one that other women looked down upon in the city she she was frowned upon she was you know they wanted to keep her away from their men she had to go to the well at a different time of the day and that was the time jesus chose to go oh hallelujah oh friends i'm so glad i'm saved hallelujah that's the time he chose to go and that's why he needed to go there and he said why is why his uh disciples went to go fetch some food to eat he went down to the well and this woman came and he said fetch me a drink of water and she said it's not customary for you jews to ask us samaritans you know the jews looked down with samaritans samaritan was half gentile half jew he looked down on us jesus didn't have a racial bone in his body jesus wasn't racial and neither are his people i don't know why that keeps coming up none of that's in my notes but he said if you knew who was talking to you amen you'd ask me for a drink see brother branham said god foresaw her amen oh hallelujah god foresaw you thank you father there is nothing you've done that ever surprised god tell you friends when i got that revelation it just did something to me amen brother branham said god chose moses he said you know he killed a man one time but god still chose him because that's who god had chosen he wasn't surprised by it right he wasn't surprised by anything that you've ever done he isn't he is surprised if you've backslidden if you've got cold on god he is not surprised he knew everything that was going to happen he allowed the things that happened that happened because there's nothing too great for him and he constantly reminds us of who he is and how great he is and of his love and his and his care and his mercy and his grace for us she was a predestinated seed that's why and friends she found grace in his eyes she found favor with him she couldn't find favor with nobody else in the town but she found favor with jesus hallelujah you found favor with him and he began to reveal his word to her she says our fathers say that your fathers say you worship in jerusalem are saying this mountains he said the time cometh and now is where you'll worship him in spirit and in truth he said go get your husband she said i have no husband he says you've spoken well for you've had five and the one you're with now is not your husband she said sir i perceive you're a prophet we know when the messiah comes that he'll do these things he said i'm he that speaks to you oh something quickened inside of her something came alive she recognized that he was the messiah that would have been promised the priest of the temple called him bells above yeah they said you cast out devils by the power of devils there was nothing in them that was a difference between her and them oh they could look and say the difference is she's an ill-famed woman and we're holy but the difference was there was a seed of god in her to be fit [Applause] she was a predestinated seed she was chosen of god she was elect god had foreseen her before the foundation of the world and he placed her name on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world your name didn't get placed on the land's book of life when you came and accepted salvation it was placed on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world hallelujah you didn't become seed by rebirth you were seed and therefore could be reborn said you weren't a pig or a or a dog and then became a sheep or an eagle said you always were a sheep only the elect can be reborn hallelujah praise the lord hallelujah we read in the bible in the first part of genesis about two boys i'm going to be closing we read about two boys cain and abel now brother branham says that their mommy and daddy taught them that it was fruit and so cain when brother brown said both boys wanted to find favor with god cain wanted favor with god so cain brought of everything that had been that he had yielded through his hard work in labor and made a beautiful altar made a beautiful sacrifice to god of everything that he had worked and toiled over and he comes up before god and he's waiting for god to come down and accept his offering and he looks over and he sees abel abel didn't he didn't build no altar like cain did he just put some rocks together and he brought a little innocent lamb over there and he took a rock and he bashed his brains out and he took a rock and he cut it and spilled its blood it was an awful looking mess and god came down and had honor unto abel's sacrifice but under cain's sacrifice god didn't have no honor abel found favor with god not because of his sacrifice abel found favor with god therefore was able to make the sacrifice see here's what i'm getting at the bible says by faith abel offered a more excellent sacrifice than that of king and brother branham said it was by revelation he said faith is a revelation and abel offered a more excellent sacrifice because god revealed to him it wasn't true he revealed to him that something had to die he revealed to him that it was blood that took him out of the garden he revealed to him that that something had to die in order for their nakedness to be covered that he had revelation of this shows that he found favor with god friends you didn't find favor with god because you come here to church you didn't find favor with god because you got real good or because you got dunked in some water and or something like that it wasn't because you got baptized it was because you belonged to him that's why you found favor with god you did all these things because you fight favor with god you did all these things because god revealed it to you it wasn't just being dumped in water it was going down in waters of baptism and and and and your sins being remitted from you [Music] hallelujah it was burying that old man and coming up a new creature in christ now there's people who don't have that revelation and they go down dry centers and come up wet ones nothing changed what changed you was god opening your eyes and revealing himself to you that shows that you have found grace in the eyes of the lord it shows that you have favor with god you could go out of these doors this morning there should be a joy in your heart knowing that you have favor with god hallelujah hallelujah it brings to me a whole new meaning to my grace to sufficiency amen my grace is sufficient for you he told paul paul said i've got a thorn in the flesh and i prayed three times that he would remove it from me but his answer to me was my grace is sufficient paul found grace in the eyes of the lord paul the bible says yet while he was breathing out threatenings on the church that god appeared to him in a pillar of light yes and paul recognized the supernatural and he said lord who are you he said i'm jesus whom thou persecuted it's hard to kick against the pricks you're coming to me paul was blinded by scales come over his eyes but jesus said i'm going to send a man to you amen and he's going to pray for you and the skills are going to come off your eyes and you're going to receive the holy ghost and then he went lord you want me to go down there to saul of tarsus he's the one that's been persecuting us well i've called him to do a great work for me yet while he was breathing out threatenings it didn't matter friends your past life don't matter hallelujah things that you've come from don't matter the times that you've lit candles and made offerings and and and all these different things none of those things matter god's opened your eyes hallelujah let's stand heavenly father lord we come before you this morning we ask god that you will take this word now that's been preached lord may the people take it to heart their god may they go forth joyous lord may they go forth victorious ready to face the battles that are to come lord we're going to be facing battles until we leave here but lord no matter what comes our way we've got the assurance that you called us no matter what imperfections show up you're going to finish the work you said you would you started it you're going to finish it you're going to perfect us we're not perfect now but lord we're coming to perfect lord jesus bless your people i pray this day bless them dear god as they go their ways and as they go to eat into fellowship and so on lord bless their time and their fellowship together lord bless their children dear god bless the children today dear god i pray dear god that there's been things that said that even the children could understand lord lord i remember being about eight years old and said another ministry of this end time message the things that i picked up the things that i comprehended at the time lord i know that children can hear your words there's things they pick up on and comprehend the things they don't in time it'll come we ask your blessings now dear god knowing lord that we've found favor in your eyes thank you for your grace thank you for your mercy your god praise the lord amen praise the lord amen amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] sure [Music] i'm so glad that i was on oh let's just worship me for him [Music] the heavens [Music] yes thank you lord jesus on the cross i was on his mind the look of love was on his face the thorns were on his head and blood ran down his scars roar it stained a crimson red though his eyes were on the crowd that day he looked amen oh i'm glad i was on his mind and for he knew [Music] hallelujah thank you [Music] hallelujah [Music] of such mercy thank you lord for we was on the cross i'm glad i was on is mine and i'm gonna make it he's already said that i would so i keep on trusting that he's working everything for my good for he walks beside me and heaven is in my [Music] [Applause] [Music] i'm gonna make it he already said that i would i'll keep on breathtaking that he's working everything for my good and he want beside me and heaven comes in [Music] so i'm not giving up [Music] i'm not turning round by the grace of god i'm gonna wear that shiny crown someday but i'll keep [Music] i'll keep going on [Music] through this veil of tears at times i've even questioned even if my lord was near then at times that old tempter he says why not turn around you [Music] just look him in the eye and call him a [Music] liar by the grace of my god i'm gonna wear i'm not giving up no i'll keep going on would you like to tell me there's been something bothering me why is it that old devil he just won't let god's children be has purpose and determined to get right in the way and to take us from the way of life and lead [Music] i'm not [Music] [Applause] [Music] i'm not turning round but by the grace of god i'm gonna wear the shining crown sunday so i'll keep holding [Music] hold [Music] hallelujah hallelujah amen praise the name of the lord amen you feel that way amen we are made out of the stuff that can't bluff amen it's a reality amen in our lives you know to me you you find one of the things that how the lord spoke to us today it's one of the things that that that satan fights so much on that of predestination there's a lot of things and and i'll just tell you there's not a lot that even believe it even how brother branham brought it but the reality of it is is that no sunday school no bible reading no parents no prophet no pastor put the seed of god in you he was always a seed of god amen just like that prodigal son when he he went his way but it did not change that he was a son he was always a son even when he had all types of stuff on him that nobody wanted to be around him he was still a son but the only way he could be recognized as a son is there would have to go a call out to him and the angel of the lord spoke to his heart and when he came in the presence of his father back into his homeland then that's when he can be recognized as a son and that's what the spirit of god first of all the spirit of god tells us we're sons and daughters of god it and you know it's just something about it that the spirit of god is he's not there to try to persuade us to convince us he speaks with an authority and it build there's a faith that rises within us that it's not us that's doing it it's the seed of god that's responding to the light of god and he's drawing us to him and into that place to where we can really be expressed who can take credit for anything i mean if if if the seed was put in you because when you read the bible then you've got something to do with it if it was put in you that well you know when when you came to the altar it came came in you that's not the scripture that's not the scripture at all but the reality is when you drop from your mother's womb that seed was in you then but the baby tells us in god rich and mercy when you took that breath of life right there it enters in amen and thanks be to god that he came looking for me amen i'll tell you what the word of god it it it dismantles all fear it dismantles every doubt it dismantles every question and it it removes the reality of is that what you were before in that first nature that's not who you really were that was a false image but the true image is now what's reflecting in your life what did that amazing grace amazing grace amen like mary when when the angel of the lord came to her and said thou art highly favored of god highly favored she was already blessed brother man tells us david was blessed before the anointing oil was ever paul poured upon him we were blessed amen aren't you glad why you couldn't fit into the world there's things you tried you tried you tried to fit in but there's just something about it you couldn't fit in because you're not of this world you never were of this world you were always a part of god amen i'm just so thankful for that aren't you amen how many just enjoyed the word of the lord this morning amen amen heavenly father lord how we thank you father for your mercy and your grace lord it's so true as you speak to us again and again lord it's you letting us know that you've got this in control lord it's not us it's not of him that willeth nor runeth but it's god who showeth mercy lord jesus we would ask lord here this morning that lord god that you would help us to continue just to yield to you lord yielding to your working lord yielding lord to your grace lord to work out in our lives all that's needed lord we're thankful lord for your molding and the shaping in our lives we thank you for every test and every trial lord we thank you father for every victory lord and lord jesus we're thankful that we're saved lord father we just pray that as we would depart lord from the presence of one another in this place dear god we ask that you would just go with us maybe there's one lord that hasn't fully surrendered but i pray that god that this word that you spoke here this morning that lord it would just just so move in their hearts even as they would rest lord in their pillow and and to recognize that there's a greater purpose lord in life than anything that they could ever imagine and lord that there's one who loves them who cares about them lord and desires to really bring them into life granted lord i pray father may you watch over your children this week as lord they go through this week lord the jobs and different things that lay before us we ask lord jesus that you would guide us and direct us lord we love you and we thank you now father in the name of the lord jesus christ amen as you're being dismissed in the name of the lord why don't you shake hands with one another amen may god bless you [Music] the world didn't give it to me this joy that i have the world didn't give it to me this joy that i had the world didn't give it to me you know that the world didn't give it and the world can't take it away the holy ghost the holy ghost the holy the ghost didn't give it to me the holy ghost that i have the world
