of people he said whether two or three are gathered together in my name he said i'll be in their midst i don't believe we came here to be seen tonight we come here to have a meeting with god we come here that our lives might be challenged we might be further changed and that if there's anything that's unlike him that it would be dissolved that we leave out of here with more more of him less of us this is our this is our prayer tonight let's just go to the lord in a word of prayer lord jesus the lord just counted such a privilege and an honor you've given us lord we can come together lord father we realize lord jesus that lord this is a very awesome moment lord it's something lord that we don't take for granted lord we just lord want to give give our all right now lord i pray that lord that through your god the cares of this life lord if there be any weariness of mind any weariness of spirit lord even through the toils and labors of this day and of this week lord may you just

you just lord be the speaker and the hearer here tonight lord may we just be taken under your control lord and i pray that god for every need that's gathered here lord we go ahead and we give you the thanks lord jesus because lord we know that god that the promises and what you've done you've already lord finished the work you've already lord god completed lord and lord may our faith just raise into that place lord i pray that god you'll just be very personal to each of our hearts lord we love you and we thank you tonight lord give you all the glory and honor in the name of jesus christ amen amen if you would if you'll turn with me let's go to first first corinthians 13 4 and i want to say we just so appreciate your your prayers while we were there in michigan ministering and i tell you uh brother ron spencer just just was really just how god just used our brother in such a special way and i tell you for those of you which most of you you know this as a church because we've been praying but i tell you brother rahm didn't preach like a man who has stage four cancer i think a what a testimony and what a courage that should give each and every one of us amen you know it's just sometimes there's things that sister rita you know how god moved for you and sage for cancer god completely healed you and we just believe that for brother ron as well we're just waiting on the manifestation of it because god's already that the promise has already been been given and god has already confirmed that we're just waiting on the manifestation and i believe that with all my heart so we just it was just a wonderful time with brother paul and the saints as they dedicating the the assembly there the church and so we just want to turn our attention to the word here and what we've been reading from this this particular verse of scripture here for some time i want to just go just a little bit further here this evening and paul as he writes here charity suffereth long and is kind and charity envieth not and charity vaunteth not itself and it's not puffed up and we know that that to be puffed up it's not arrogant or proud or does not display itself in a in a haughty manner so we want to just look at this tonight a little bit further if the lord will help us may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated i want to go to first corinthians chapter 8 and i want to to look at this here tonight paul will bring here's another place and you'll find paul he will deal with this the spirit of god through paul will catch these things even as it's there within in the body and it's the spirit of god god's love and god's care his desire to make himself known and to reveal himself in such a manner in a way that god doesn't want anything to be a hindrance and for us we don't want anything to be a hindrance either and so it's god's desire that that how that in his life and his glory that he would flow freely through our lives and so when we look at this look how paul would write of this in first corinthians chapter 8 verse 1 now as touching things offered unto idols we know that we all have knowledge knowledge puffeth up but charity edifier now to edifies to to build up if any man think that he knoweth anything he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know but if a man loved god the same is known of him now paul would would deal with this we all have knowledge and you'll see this word that is as it's used throughout the scripture and it's not it's not always the same meaning of where we're drawing this from but here at paul there's times where it would speak of knowledge where it is dealing with the intelligence the understanding understanding what's right understanding what's wrong but then there's also that knowledge which is of a divine knowledge and so you find that how we have both of them but yet when we look at this this word as paul would say here knowledge puffeth up and to see that that knowledge itself there is an understanding there is there is a a knowledge that that also comes that as we further walk on with god as paul would would write even of this right here of things that's lawful things that's unlawful for christians look how paul and some of these them some of these scriptures i'm going to read so that you you just won't put this word knowledge as something that is earthly because that's not what it is but when we look how paul would even how the spirit of god this word would be used paul would write in romans 11 33 all the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of god this is the knowledge of of god all the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of god how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out in first corinthians 1 4 and i'm just pulling just from a few here i thank my god always on your behalf for the grace of god which is given you by jesus christ that in everything ye are enriched by him in all utterance and in all knowledge even as the testimony of christ was confirmed in you so that you come behind in no gift waiting for the coming of our lord jesus christ now i want you to just to catch this here that there is a part of it to where when the knowledge that we speak of and paul is was is even a writing of this here it's to know first of all what is right and wrong and to know that god's word is true the very first thing that the enemy in his attack upon the church of the living god and it's been all the way even through the old testament if the enemy can get in there and tamper with that word and remove the truth of it and the knowledge of that word and try to put it off of well this is something in the past this isn't no longer required this isn't really necessary that's the enemy tampering with the truth of god's word the knowledge of the word and remember when jesus using the same word knowledge he spoke to the pharisees and he says that they themselves wouldn't enter into the kingdom and he says they also have shut off the key of knowledge from others to enter in you see you've got to know what you have to know in order what you have to know in order what to do by the bible says he would make known unto us the pathways or the path of life so it is god remember even when they stood there on the day of pentecost they said what must we do to be saved and peter peter rang out with a prescription repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ those are two things that we must do but then that's when god steps in after that and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost see there's a pathway there's a true pathway when israel got away from the word look where it took them though dwelling in the word but here they are bound with idolatry and they're between two opinions here between bowel and god and you know which one which one is and see there became a tampering of the real truth the real knowledge of god and then look where it led them to it led them to where sin was in the camp it led them to where god pulled back his presence from their lives and here they were standing here in a mess really of a defeated state so when we see this brother bannon would say it like this and i love this statement in the sumerian church age and he deals with how the paralysis would work through uh the false vine and he said it was also coming in the true vine and he says it like this no true believer is any stronger and spiritually healthy and alive than his knowledge of and adherence to the pure word of god so notice notice our brother put that there it's not only the knowledge of the pure word of god and we need we need the mind of god to speak forth the knowledge of god and then we need the grace of god to adhere to it so that it's not just knowledge but it becomes manifestation so this is where it's in god's hands god comes to unfold himself and the grace also that is needed that that word might be expressed this is where it comes into our lives in second corinthians 10 5 paul said casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god when the enemy wants to try to fire in a thought or fire in a suggestion or anything else as a believer it's brought to that of the word and the word is what judges it don't care how good it looks how good it feels it's the knowledge of god the word where we're standing on that word to know god's word is true what god said back there he's never altered i'm god and i changed not he's the same on everything second corinthians 8 7. now notice how paul brings these two together he says therefore as you abound in everything in faith in utterance and knowledge and in all diligence and in your love to us see that ye abound in this grace also abound would mean to grow within it and you see when we look at this you might say well what more do i have to know brother brown would deal with this you know even as a maturing of a believer there's more even as you go along that you come to understand you grow even in your walk with god as you walk with god it should be in your life and as a believer you learn more that it's less about you it's more him it's us yielding and god doing is that right this is where the reality comes in brother branham would put in this way he says when i first started out he says i said i'm like a man swimming across and going real quick he said but after a while you just kind of learn how to make those strides he said so that as you're making those strides then you're not so worn out you know exactly where to start and where to stop see that's that that's knowledge that's understanding that's that's learning that's maturing now notice this is ii peter 3 18. but grow and i always like how this is wrote here grow in grace and in the knowledge of our lord jesus our lord and savior jesus christ to him be glory both now and forever amen notice how peter would write this grow in grace not grow you don't grow into grace you grow in grace must first come into grace grow in grace and knowledge not knowledge then grace but grow in grace because with the knowledge that's being opened we need grace coupled with it because it's grace that opens our eyes it's grace that helps us to see and it's that same grace that helps us to be tolerable with others so do we need understanding and not in knowledge yes we do we need knowledge there's things that you know even when brother branham would be asked questions you find in questions and answers in different places and different ones where you know speaking about even where it was um you know maybe somebody uh coming in and and and how a gift is used you know within the church and brother brahma is is trying to get to us express to them how to go about it in wisdom instead of just looking at something in a manner of right and wrong but he brings it to a place he says when a toddler your child's learning to walk you don't go up and correct them because they're learning to walk but he says you're there to kind of and to instruct them but as they get older that's a different story then there comes a correction because now they know better is that right then brother rams ask questions about things of you know do we take you know somebody aside and and uh you know tell them this and or you shouldn't dress this you shouldn't wear this and i always go back i was a little boy i don't remember it but always remember when my dad stood in the place you know where he when he was pastoring uh down in in rockford ohio there close kind of the van were in those areas and when he was pastoring there and here was a was was was a lady who came in and my goodness when i did you've heard those of you that have been in the assembly for some time you heard dad tell it she came in with a mini skirt and everything else or whatever more and you had different ones that stood up and said should we pull her aside and tell her and dad said don't you touch her you let the word of god because she's responding to the word let the word bring conviction and dress her and and you heard how brother browning told it brother dave you probably remember that you find different ones and and what was taking place little by little the word as the salt was being put into the pottage it was neutralizing the effects of sin to where she's responding to the word of almighty god you say why do you mention that well as god brings it back to my attention i think sometimes that people have made the gospel and made the message to where it's no more than rulers and everything else instead of the real grace of god i believe in real holiness that it'll display itself but i'm also going to tell you you can have all the holiness on the outside and not have the holy ghost on the inside i've come face to face with that as well the message is not something you put on it's what you get into because you can put it on here and take it off out there but the message is jesus christ it's a place of dwelling to the believer we're not something we put on here on thursday and take off the next day and put on here and put off there are you with me neither is it a code of conduct immorals or ethics and we do this and we don't do this and we do you're no different than the amish but there must be a reality on the inside that you live by a real godly conviction [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah it's got to come down to the depth to the inside do we need knowledge and understanding yes because even in those things that god would just share even there that's understanding that's knowledge for a person to come to terms with wait a minute here i might be doing all the p's and q's but if the desire is still down here and if there's still not a love affair i've not made the mark of really being born again because the love of god it holds us now notice how brother branham and notice how paul let me just let me move to this paul speaking of this knowledge here he says though i have the gift of prophecy and i understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i'm nothing so it it shows when we look at it as paul has expressed this we all have knowledge knowledge prophets up but charity edifies so yes we need knowledge and understanding but without charity what good is it what good is all the mysteries without charity without charity what good is all the knowledge that do this and we don't do this and we what good is it without that you see this is where as as brother brown would deal with this in the knowledge you know the knowledge itself it doesn't do us any good without the real spirit of love in our life without the holy ghost it doesn't do any good brother brown would pick it up of how that knowledge would would look at things and knowledge and he would say it just in this manner i can't associate with those people they're uneducated or i can't associate with them brother braham said it don't make any difference whether they know their abcs or not they can know christ i'm going to say it pretty plain here you know to really believe in a pentecostal experience it's sad but that's becoming a rare thing around this message i'm not trying to bring differences i'm just trying to tell you that knowledge and mysteries and all the everything you can go through that if it don't come down into practicality to where there's a real birth on the inside and if it despises the real move of the holy ghost deny it renounce it they have a form of godliness but deny the power thereof the commandment says from such turn away is that right he ordered jesus it ought to be him that's welcome if we want if we believe he's the same yesterday today and forever that's just not a scripture that's who we declare he is what he did before he still does today amen oh the baptist says you can never get too low he said may god always keep that spirit in me no matter what what the man believes what he doesn't creed color well i want to reach a handout to help him i want that spirit in me that i will not think i'm better than somebody else oh he says let me humble myself who am i but clay that god has made let my life be humbled that his life will be reflected lets all christians feel like that knowledge gets us nowhere look at this in verse 2 if any man first corinthians 8 2 if any man think that he knoweth anything he knoweth nothing as he ought to notice think here the spirit of god is identifying if one would think or be of the opinion or to think indeed that he has perceived something knoweth perceived something he's perceived it he's discerned the correct knowledge or understanding notice where paul is going if he thinks this is a feeling of himself that i've got a handle on this i've got a real hand on this whether it's man or woman it's not that way it's not us that has a handle on it it's god's grace that we understand these things it's god's grace that god has made you and i aware of what's acceptable and what's not acceptable this is why even in divine revelation real true revelation even when it's revealed brother iran would point this out to us there remains a supernatural element even after the word has been revealed there's a there's a supernatural element around it and to think i love how daniel says it in daniel 2 30 when daniel remember he was praying for the mercies of god and daniel stands before the king after god has revealed to him the dream of nebuchadnezzar and the meaning and daniel says it like this as for me this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that i have more than any living but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thine heart notice it's not revealed to me for any wisdom that i have more than any living see the word daniel saying it didn't come to lift me up above you but this came that life might be preserved daniel now here paul goes into this here in verse two and let's just let's just look at this here just just a few moments if any man think that he knoweth anything he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know it so paul by the spirit of god it is not so much what the person knows but it's does he know it the way he ought to know it the first word that's used here in this knoweth anything it's dealing with a perception or discerning but the next three knoweth nothing as he ought to know and in verse 3 if any man love god but if any man love god the same is known of him every one of those words right there it points to relationship if he has knowledge without relationship he doesn't know it the way god wants him to know it god doesn't want us to know him by facts brother mcspang explained it he said like a canary in a cage and that canary can say hey i'm i'm i'm more superior than the rest of you canaries i watched this girl today and she did this and she did that and she did this and she did that and these human beings do this and they do that and he said you let another human being now a human being walk in and begin to speak to that canary he said that canary though it has all this knowledge of human beings it cannot understand that human being speaking to it why it's only got a canary brain are you with me this is why you must be and it has to be more than just knowledge it must be a real substance on the inside we can know all the facts about everything and this and that and this and that and that's all it is at the end of the day nothing but a bunch of facts but you don't marry facts this word is not facts it's a person jesus christ is not a doctrine doctrine comes from him but he is the person of the word himself and this word every man thinks he knoweth it i mean you see look how knowledge my i've got an understanding of these things and my nervous and and though sometimes those things are not said but you catch it it can be caught in the way even in looking at things probably perhaps every one of us have been in situations like that where you can feel like you know what you've been made to feel like as though you know nothing sometimes that's taking place whether you've been on the job or you know somebody likes to make you feel little so they can feel bigger you know now they've got they've got the inside scooping on the revelation and everything else and as i've said here before there's no minister on this earth right now that has the inside school on jesus christ there's not one that the bride is looking to the message has already come by the messenger that's the voice that we're hearing from amen brother samuel aren't you going to seek out this pastor no because they know god i know god just let they know god they don't know the mind of god for this for this assembly but god knows what he's doing it's god that assembled this work it's god that lays taking account our needs and lasers on our life it might come in a little bit of a different angle but it's god letting himself be known he's a personal god hallelujah oh my we're never too big to learn but there's not one man and if any man wants to put himself up in that category you know right away it's a wrong spirit it's a kingdom spirit to try to elevate himself that doesn't come from the spirit of jesus christ that is not come for the real true revelation brother brown could stand on the platform and he stood there with an understanding that was not based on seventh grade education he stood there let me tell you something what god did in this hour as god would reveal himself god let it be known this was not a man this was not the intelligence of man it was not man's man's well let me see what my perception of the word is it was not that at all even where men had wandered at the word of god men had made statements about the word of god but god came down assembling stones that were on the mountain and where men said i don't know if this could be or that could be god came down with his presence not knowledge but his presence put every stone in order it ain't plagiarism it's god coming on the scene and god declaring this was my thought that they wondered at but these are no longer the days of wondering these are the days of thus saith the lord [Applause] to the greeks see this knowledge right here as we speaking about this but he as he ought to know if any man love god the same is known of him the greeks they looked at this and this this word to the greeks the greeks believed when they they knew something when they knew the facts about it whether or not a korean whether or not it affected their conduct or not they knew it if they knew the facts but to the jews true knowledge was always manifested itself in one's conduct i like that one did not know something until that fact had a practical outworking in his life its relationship so paul was letting it be known its relationship god's relationship with his people his life pulsating in every individual believer and through the body so now as we look at this the bible look how i would say in another place with guarding this of knowledge charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away but charity never fail you see knowledge without that true revelation of jesus christ without the love of god being shed abroad in our heart it eventually vanishes we've seen it over the years seeing even reason where it has been nothing but knowledge and now there comes other knowledge along and that knowledge vanishes but if but charity cannot be moved charity is that thai post of the holy spirit the revelation of jesus christ where you're not living this life by do's and don'ts it's by the love of god that's in your heart is that right this is why paul could write within it then ephesians 3 19 and to know the love of christ this is by experience that same word to know it by experience which passeth knowledge yeah we need knowledge but we need that experience because it passes knowledge amen that we might be filled with all the fullness of god paul would write in second corinthians 4 6 for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ and we have this treasure in earth and vessels that the excellence of the power may be of god and not of us notice the knowledge how was this knowledge come about it was god who has shined into our hearts so it was not knowledge that just it stopped here but it came all the way to the inside and it's reflecting it's reflecting the glory of god through our lives so notice now it's touching things offered unto idols we know that we all have knowledge knowledge puffeth up but charity edifier knowledge alone apart from real charity to govern that understanding in our life can lead to a feeling of pride we know a little bit more but charity notice how paul put this he separates charity edifying we need knowledge we need understanding but we need charity most of all because charity is there to govern that understanding because there's a lot of things that we can see a lot of things then and within it charity is there to edify what does edifying mean edify is not just you know you you you speaking a good word to somebody but real edification comes by the holy ghost and that is a life that's lived it's not just edification that takes place through through the through the ministry the word here through the pulpit but even through your life one to another the holy spirit is able to edify the body it's him that's edifying encouraging building up it's him that you see this is why paul would write even of these things when he would speak uh to titus and he would speak about the responsibilities he said let the older the elder brothers let them teach the younger and he wasn't all together talking about sit down and have a seminar with them and and you know teach them how to be sober and this and that though those things are very very good but he's talking about an example and a life that's lived because he would also write to the older women to those he said that's already married with children that they would teach the younger and he would tie it in with how that they're to love their husbands how did they're to care for the children how to be keepers of the home that's not just something that we just that's spoken out here in christianity it's not just not just a a a bundle of teaching it's in life that's lived so notice how paul would bring this is very very simple scriptures but it applies to so so much more than even how paul is dealing with this here because in everything we do remember this it's not just about us when we've surrendered our heart and our life to god we've been drawn it's about him we've surren our life has been drawn to surrender it's not about us it's about him and so that it's about him it's about his body notice how paul in picking these verses up of how that this will how the life and how the expression of that life is to be lived in verse four of first corinthians eight as concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is not other god but one no the same word no this is knowledge for though there be that there are called gods whether in heaven or in earth as there be be god's many and lords many but to us there is but one god the father of whom are all things and we in him one lord jesus christ by whom are all things and we by him paul is expressing we have this understanding now notice how he brings this how be it there is not in every man that knowledge for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol and their conscience being weak is defiled let me just pause here for a moment paul's dealing with and we see it in different parts and i know we've read through these things before but it pertains more than just eating meats and and what they were dealing with it pertains to the whole of the body and what it was dealing with is how that even in that time when they would go to either purchase meat because there was sacrifices that were offered to these gods in these temples and they would take that and then that meat itself whatever it wasn't taken would be taken out there and it was sold in the shambles or in the meat market and so paul paul is letting it be known here then he's he's saying saying to them we have this understanding but he's letting it be known to the whole body that that same understanding is not in the whole body because for some their conscience now paul's not dealing in the soul realm he's dealing in the spirit realm are you with me he's dealing in a place to where in this particular point where it's still weak where there's certain things that just bother them there's certain things that they just don't you know and it wouldn't matter how much you could explain it it still troubles them with me i mean you know there's certain things where you know maybe you know somebody you know maybe because i don't know maybe because you know out in the world you know how things were and it might sound strange to you but it might be how that they live down the world and and they might associate a pair of genes with how they lived out in the world i'm talking about a man now and so to them there's still that association they don't want no association with that they're just fine to say you know what i'm fine without it and there's no sin against it i'm talking for a man are you with me so paul is dealing with this conscience because that's one of the five inlets of the spirit and he's speaking it says that howbeit not every man has this knowledge for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol and their conscience being weak is defiled but meat commendeth us not to god look how the instruction comes me commendeth us not to god for neither if we eat are we the better neither if we not are we the worst so paul is letting him know you don't have to prove your understanding that i understand these things so if i don't eat then i'm going to offend the lord no paul paul he's bringing it beyond that we're not commended to god if we eat or if we don't eat but take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to them that are weak for if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols you see our lives are influencing somebody amen and we can't look across even i'm just saying it for here for our assembly and say well everybody's strong and i'm saying it's strong and even to be endued with the strength of the lord the holy ghost our lives are set forth to be an example we're influencing somebody whether we want to be or not you might say well i ain't even professing this way or not whether you like it or not you're influencing somebody and you want to make sure that your life is influencing them to jesus christ we don't want to put anything of a hindrance in the way of somebody else because our the focus is the body paul's not dealing with things what he's speaking of here uh you know in things within this manner as though of sin he's talking about a person's perception on things their perception on it if paul would would deal with it our liberty on it our liberty to where that the weaker one would be emboldened to eat it but they're eating it with the thought this is offered to an idol is that right if any man notice and through thy knowledge verse 11 shall the weak brother perish for whom christ died but when ye sinned so against the brethren and wound their weak conscience ye sin against christ wherefore if meat make my brother to offend i will eat no flesh while the world standeth lest i make my brother to offend even though paul had an understanding on it but paul said if meat makes them to offend long as the world's standing i won't eat meat who is this about the body you see the love of god takes out of us the me mine i we it takes that out of us we still have to pull things in subjection but there's a greater resource on the inside paul deals with this here and just for sake of time paul is dealing with this here in the book of romans in romans chapter 14. and paul is speaking here in verse one he says him that is weak in the faith receive ye but not to doubtful dispute disputations for one believeth that he may eat all things another who is weak eateth herbs letting on him that edith despise him that eateth not and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth for god hath received him sad thing is this devil even has got around even on different things that has nothing to do even with this then listen the devil is a very deceptive and cunning guy but he can't out fox the holy ghost [Applause] i'm appalled at the church and i say this message believers that are being motivated by things outside in the government and taking positions on faith well we do this they don't do this that is not the holy ghost [Applause] see it begins a spirit of knowledge and puffing up and we do this and we don't do that we we need to have discernment of the spirit of almighty god we're not ignorant of satan's devices are you with me egypt but it's it's something how i've watched this over months over the course of years where people have got some sort of a self-righteousness because they were a massacre this one doesn't wear a mask that is nothing of god whatsoever [Applause] you understand me we don't want those things coming in here i won't stand for it coming in here this is where the spirit of god is to have liberty there's one resource we're to rely on and that's the holy ghost it's thus saith the lord [Applause] i mean it's it's i mean these are things that's all laid out you find statements this way and statements that way do you pay any attention to it not that nor the news but i hear different things and i'm appalled at how can the church of the living god get caught up in such nonsense are you hearing me we have one who's our protector and that is jesus christ amen my confidence it's not i i'm faithful for all but i want to look into this and look into that but our confidence is in jesus christ if you feel more safe with this and say well i feel safer now you need to check up because it's in him he is our safety [Applause] that's free but i see how that spirit wants to come in amen and as long as we do this we do this or we do that or we what does that have to do with the gospel it has nothing to do with the gospel at all let's see how how even if this right here and i'll just let me just resume here and notice how paul would bring this here because you see if you don't then it becomes what's the next thing we have to do are you with me what's the next thing we have to do i have to do this or i have to do that i want you to understand what i'm saying it becomes what what becomes the next thing you have to do there comes a time we've got to stand on god's word either god is a god of his way or he's not that's not arrogance it's god who made the promise he didn't become a less god when a virus came along he steal jehovah rapha [Applause] you take a brother right here just one of them that has been right in the face in three floors of that virus and those things of when it's taken place and god has kept him i know different ones got it and god brought you through it the atonement is just as strong [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so everyone cast these things down cast these things down this and this and taking positions on this and position this why would we allow that devil to bring division discern him out and withstand him just one thing if we can't do it on that what about other things that was free with a bow on it right one man is timothy in verse five one man esteemeth one day above another another esteemeth every day of life every let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind and paul goes on verse six let me just let me just let me just skip down here on this for sake of time verse 8 for whether we live we live unto the lord whether we die we dine to the lord whether we live therefore or die we are the lords and paul says in verse 10 why dost thou judge thy brother while why dost thou said it not thy brother for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of christ as i live saith the lord every knee shall bow to me every tongue shall confess to god so then every one of us shall give account of himself to god yes there's a lot that could be said about that but paul as he says in verse 13 let us not therefore judge one another anymore but judge this rather let us discern this that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brother's way amen i know and am persuaded by the lord jesus that there's nothing unclean of itself but to him that esteemeth anything to be unclean to him it is unclean it's not looking down it's if the person esteems it to be unclean okay all right you have to have that that that's that's your perception on okay we're still brothers we're still brothers and sisters okay is that right notice even then we're not talking about sin we're not talking about sin but if thy brother be grieved with thy meat now walketh thou not charitably destroy not him with thy meat for whom christ died let not then your good be evil spoken of for the kingdom of god is not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the holy ghost for he that in these things serveth christ is acceptable to god and approved of men let us therefore follow after pursue the things which make for peace and things where with one may edify another for me destroy not the work of god to prove that i'm able to do this this is there's nothing there's nothing in the word of god against it there's nothing in my heart against it but notice for the word for meat for your liberty don't destroy the work of god some things that may sound it may sound very strange to you but you hear brother branham pick up certain things even in god hiding and revealing himself in simplicity and he deals with even how sometimes he talks about and he identifies as self-righteousness but he talks about among some of the um the holiness people where they don't believe you weren't they don't believe the brothers wearing short sleeve shirts they ought to wear you know a long sleeve shirt you might look at that and we could look at that and say i mean come on what does it matter if they wear a short sleeve shirt or they wear a long sleeve shirt but remember we're there to try to reach them there's things sometimes where i've went if i don't know exactly where it's going i don't mind wearing a white shirt but sometimes you know what i'm not there i'm not there to prove anybody any liberty that i can wear a brown shirt or a purple shirt or a red shirt i'm not interested in that i'm interested because i've been asked god's laid on their heart god's laid on my heart i want to go there i don't want anything to be a hindrance that's not how just i live my life out there i live it here as well that's my heart's desire i don't want anything because god holds me responsible i don't want anything for there to be here a hindrance for god to be able to speak to his people sometimes that requires maybe there's a little bit more prayer waiting on certain things and this and that i just say that not just for me but that's for all of us the desire we want we want the body of jesus christ to be built up amen we don't want anybody to stump notice all things indeed are pure but it is evil for him for a man who eateth with offense it is good they're good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine nor anything whereby thy brother stumbleth or is offended or is made weak sometimes these are things it's not all together you say well brother simon i don't you know i this is not something i you know would do in front of somebody else or anymore remember we're not talking about sin right but see we've got other also other avenues that we have to deal with as well you may not you may not be something you do completely out here but everything that you post everything you put out that's right are you with me there can be things that hey not everybody within the congregation or assembly and you can know there are certain things that just might not be real set up what should i do keep it at your house the world don't need to know furthermore i never understood why the world needs to know what you had on your plate for dinner but i know it's more than that you understand what i'm saying sometimes there's things like that that just and you look at it and say well well i ought to have that freedom but remember it is your liberty but you've got liberty here that's what's most important you have a liberty here you're not condemned within it this is what paul says hast thou faith have it to thyself before god happy is he that condemneth not himself in the thing that he allows so what is allowed don't condemn yourself by putting it out and then where it troubles others it could be a wrong example in the wrong example it's not that it's sin remember what paul is saying sometimes there's things that just out of a weakness of conscience watch how paul would govern this i'm closing here watch how charity would govern this in paul's life in first corinthians 10 23 all things are lawful for me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but all things edify not right paul said i'm a liberty i'm a liberty all things are lawful but not everything edifies that's right paul was evaluating not whether it was lawful to him or not does it edify right i tell you this to me this this scripture it speaks of even that character that nature that paul was speaking of in philippians 2 look not every man on his own things but also on the things of other there ought to be an awareness in order to be an awareness of of of one another awareness within this assembly awareness of that of the body where god has placed us an awareness of these things and what's around us it says where paul would go on he would express these things and he would say it in this manner can i read these to you whatever sold in the shambles that eat asking no questions for conscience sake the earth is the lord's and the fullness thereof if any of if any of them that believe not bid you to a feast so unbelievers invite you to come over whatsoever is set before you eat asking no questions for conscience sake he's dealing with the meat because if you ask was this offered to idols and they say yes and you go ahead and eat they perceive it they're they're eating it to idols but in reality there's liberty in your heart it's meat the earth is the lords and the fullness thereof i'm not eating it because it was offered to the idol like sometimes you look at some of those you see pictures of those buddha temples and whatever they got some good looking cakes in there you know i mean three tiered cakes and chocolate cakes and things like that no wonder that that guy's big but if any man saying to you this is offered in sacrifice unto idols eat not for his sake that showed it and for conscience saying for the earth is the lords and the fullness thereof conscience i say not thine own but of the other paul said why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience for if i by grace be a partaker why am i evil spoken of for that for which i give things whether therefore you eat or drink or whatsoever you do do it all to the glory of god amen give none offense neither to the jews nor to the gentiles nor to the church of the living god that's a challenge because james said we offend all is that right we've things whether it's been sadder or whatever more but the objective is god help us to be sensitive help us to be sensitive to be sensitive to him amen and i think even in this time and in the hour that that we're living in just some things that wasn't even in my notes but what we see going around this is where we want the holy spirit and it's not just in those things of mask and no mask and this and that it's beyond that it's god help us to be sensitive help us to be censored help us to have a real discernment within things to discern and discern this one thing discern the body of the lord to stand there as a as a real soldier of god to say satan you have no part here because there can be certain things there's certain things that you that you as an individual can have certain convictions certain beliefs even certain thinkings about some of the things that you know as we're dealing with that's not the problem where it becomes the problem is where you start taking things and looking down on somebody else as though you know more and this and that that's not of god so it's always evaluating those things even brother branham talked about even in bringing the message he said we don't bring it with the motive of saying we're right you're wrong see that's not the motive it's truth it's the spirit of truth it's god has delivered his word in this hour but the motive behind it is not we're right and you're wrong if the word has gone out to catch the elect of god and it's god's grace that we that we would see it verse 33 even as i please all men in all things not seeking mine own prophet but the prophet of many that they may be saved may god help us may god help us that even in the understanding and the knowledge that god has given to us may it may be governed with charity when you see when we look at things we see things may god may we not may not be you feel what we feel or i feel we know more than somebody else and may we look and recognize and know it's god's grace it's things that you might see there's things we might even differ but we have one common purpose and one common goal we're looking to him and that the body of jesus christ is edified that god be lifted up that souls would be saved and filled with the holy ghost lives would be build up in him we would grow in grace and in knowledge this is the desire may god help us to be to be sensitive with this we don't want to walk with puffed up we want to walk with real charity not something that we put on but you know it's something we just say god help me we pray and we ask god with everything that's about us because i'd say for every one of us that are in here we're all made up differently we all have different temperaments but there's not one of us not one that likes to feel belittled there's not one including myself have we yes perhaps even we maybe have made somebody else feel little are you with me this isn't a great big hug session and it's in kumbaya but i'm just letting you know that there's things that we're not all together innocent in ourselves but god help us to be sensitive that we've got one purpose and one goal and that's to reach that life may it just be a real expression of jesus christ that's lived out amen in our midst heavenly father lord how we thank you tonight for your mercy lord i prayed your lord jesus that you would lord help us oh god lord sometimes the lord as we we see lord these things lord through your word the admonition that that comes to us sometimes lord there's things that lord as it can come and if we're not careful lord and not really discerning it by the word the lord we we find ourselves out of place lord but i ask that god that you would help every one of us lord help us to be sensitive lord within these things lord i believe dear god that you admonish us in these things lord you speak to us as believers lord as paul would speak to the corinthian church that god to be aware of these things to give ourselves lord even more to you lord oh god help us lord we don't want lord haughtiness about us lord lord if we have this understanding or that understanding o god any understanding we have lord it's because of your grace that's given to us lord father and even even the things lord that would be of the natural things of life oh god it's because you've given us understanding lord not because we're somebody or something that we have done oh god help us lord i pray may lord i pray god our lives be just so governed by charity lord directed lord in this hour help us lord that even in things lord that are present lord help us lord to use discernment lord help us to stand oh god as children of god lord not be drawn as your prophet would admonish us about taking sides and lord we see it in the scripture let us take sides with jesus let us stand there let it let that be the result and the rest of resolution of our life lord may we just lord just look to you help us lord i pray god i pray if there's one lord that doesn't know you in that reality of the love of god would you just lord as you spoke to their heart would you just go and make yourself real to them lord they've gone to where they can see it lord that there's an inner working lord there's a love affair between you and them lord a reality o god that passes all understanding all knowledge lord it's a reality it's an anchor it never fails lord there's nothing could
