to let you have your seats here just for a moment just ask that uh different uh some different requests and so forth that had come in even while you all were praying up there and before thursday night i was trying to read the one request from sister ethelene and i read it as though there was a baby but i guess no matter how old a person is they're they're they're the mother's baby and so the individual was actually sister ethelene brother joseph their neighbor the young man was actually 20 years old and when they come home not sister ethelene but their neighbors when they came home they found the young man deceased so then thursday night everything you know was encased there with firemen and police and that happened just early in the evening so just wanted to make a correction on that and then there's no with that right there with sister ethelene there's some other quest that she had with family things like that is taking place and you know i just mentioned it like this and i'd say to all of us brother jack was preaching last week and ministering he didn't put that scripture in there but there's only so much you can go into in a time but i just i love the scripture where it says when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than i and i like how it says that lead me i need leadership lead me to the rock that's higher than i and then it immediately goes into the next scripture it says for thou hast been a shelter amen i rock is christ jesus he is our shelter and i just i was just um sent that you know to our sister and the different ones there i also want to ask that you would keep in prayer from brother mike wall's church there in washington dc there is a sister where she had went into labor the young young family and there was a condition that had come up and i guess was already there a tumor that was in her in her brain or in her head and um since the time of delivery she's she's not come to it's been been in a coleman it's actually been for for quite a few it's been over a week now so we've been praying and it's just i haven't mentioned it from the pulpit just simply because if i don't do this right here it's not that it's not important that i have to write things down and it's before me on my phone but i wanted to bring it before you if you'll just keep that in prayer there's still the husband is sitting right there and they're believing for a miracle the baby was just born and so they have two other children and from what the report was is that you know the doctors whether they you know maybe it was a condition right there with a tumor they just weren't even aware about that was in the head but i just asked if you'll just keep her her name is sister solace if you'll just keep her in prayer and uh would you do that amen and i just um just been praying for it i know churches all around from the thread just just been praying and so i just wanted to mention that to you as well this morning also we have a baby dedication a man that you want to do here this morning and maybe if you can sing that song bring them in amen just sing the course there brother brian lead us in that and we want to dedicate for the constantine and his wife their their baby and brother constantine was it it was july 9th or 8th i don't know about you but the whole month of july was just like a wash it seems like i i don't even know where where the month of july went but july 8th july 8th right brother constantine so what a wonderful what a wonderful joy amen to welcome a man a little baby here and just thinking you know of the scripture where it says they brought young children to him to the lord jesus that he should touch them and his disciples they didn't understand what was going on but those were the parents they were moved they wanted him to touch them and that's what every one of us as parents when we dedicate our children to the lord we desire he would touch them and there'd be touches multiple touches after that he'd just keep touching them in services and keep touching them through a long life amen so much so that i love when when jacob was standing there and he crossed the hands were crossed and i love the the inspiration where jacob speaks with in that moment he says may the same angel that redeemed me redeemed them also he knew he had confidence in his token that what the token did for me it'll do for them amen i love that amen so we we just as we invite brother constantine and his wife so glad to have you you all here today amen could we sing that song amen let's sing it as a congregation [Music] from the fields of sin bring them in bring them in bring [Music] she's beautiful you want to dedicate little emma to the lord oh my she's precious let's just dedicate it heavenly father thank you lord for your mercy oh god for my brother our love thank you father for your hand of mercy and watching over them lord throughout this time o god is the caring of the children of this child lord little emma lord you know that there were many reports that came at different times that lord where fear could have easily set in but each time god you've come on the scene lord you've brought deliverance o god lord here we stand here lord and i just lord i know that they feel the same way lord i feel filled just even in this moment i'm standing here and i'm holding a miracle because not only lord is it a miracle oh god that lord how that dear god that conception and a child would come forth but god dis over all the obstacles lord and father she's here lord we just lord are desiring that you just come and touch our lord that god that your hand of mercy will always be upon her life oh god and father that has a father and a mother and just lord dedicating her to you and just to consecrate lord of their lives lord and looking to you for direction lord lord your wisdom lord for you know exactly how to order her life lord you know the purpose that you have for her and so i ask that god that even even that in this moment lord that as just as you would give them the inspiration for her name i pray that god that you will also give him inspiration lord day by day lord this little emma's name lord has taken lord as an abbreviation from emmanuel lord as our brother stated here then lord i pray that you'll always be the lord of her life oh god you would guide her every step of the way lord and we pray heavenly father may your heart lord her spirit always remain tender oh god to you lord lord bless lord my brother constantine and his wife lord and little emma lord we give her to you lord in the name of jesus christ amen amen can i have the mic just a moment it's fine thank you god bless you i promise to the lord to do this testimony because when my wife got pregnant we went to the hospital after the second ultrasound exams and they said the baby had genetic right arm bend and the radius was shot at that time they asked us to make a lot of exams including the amniocentesis the exam consists to send a syringe in the mum belly to take the amnesty straight baby and other example negative i went by that time to the pastor and i spoke to him and he said do you believe that you can't do a miracle for your children i say yes i believe we pray that day we went to the hospital and they said we can have a normal delivery because baby my bleeding by the brain so that's why i scheduled a c-section and that day today i'm really happy i thank god thank you for your support for your prayers and that there because she has a low platelet level in her blood like a mom and i remember that day when she went to this world and they made a blood exam they say well the level of the planet of the baby is 100 000 the normal range is between 150 and 180 so they're gonna try to observe her if she need a transparent blood transfusion and the second day it was 105 000 per milliliter so a little bit less i uh sorry the first day when she coming it was 108 he made it test that day after it was 1-5 second day was 128 and the last day of the day when we went out of the hospital it was 149 and i said thank god for that and there is a little thing after two weeks ago they called us to the hospital again and i said well we want to make another genetic test i said well there's something wrong with the baby he said no no no there's no real no it's just a we had a seminar about home because we didn't understand our kids exams and they ask us if we want to participate for a study with kent state university for some genetic disorder or something like that i said no i don't because i know uh jesus killed her so i really thank god [Applause] well praise the lord and so praise we thank god for that don't you just have uh the midst of everything i want to share just an update also with the building project very quickly um the i just just thanking the lord i tell you with that i'm glad that constantine gave gave us testimony just how that god has moved each step of the way you know it's like kind of like it says i don't know the song right now i can't think of the full lyrics but it says how god made a way it says i don't know how that you did it i don't know how but he did it and that's that's such a such a blessing to see how god how god has moved for that for that need amen i just want to brother brian can you give me that up there number number two for that fleece on the no on there switch it over on the scaler switcher i think i'm plugged in here there we go okay okay so i just want to do this here on this update what you see going on so that you're you're aware of these things the things we have was the with the three three different phases and i'll just kind of allude to those the first phase which we see out here right now where the concrete has been poured my goodness i'm thankful for that aren't you and it certainly made things a lot nicer for us and we just thank god for that the second phase that was and it's all all of it's kind of put together but just to kind of separate it and you'll see why but the second phase you've already seen two of the steps on either side there that's been placed in their steps here at this door and back there and then they're also going to place steps over there that are that are pre-made and the brothers elected going with that because so that those things sometimes where they've seen brother richie had inspected that and the brothers were also talking about it where sometimes the steps themselves you'll see them when they're attached and they end up cracking and breaking up and so if something happens with the steps we can always replace that um but we just that's where they elected it so the second phase was the steps um and there's you see those out there and it's also the railings and that's all being done through illyria concrete and the railings themselves what you see here on this step and what you see back there that's the same thing that will be on this whole setup out here is those railings so they're you know kind of like everything else they're kind of backed up and i think it's been at a month from whenever they measured it brother carlos you were here when they measured it okay okay so towards the end of the month or earlier those railings will go in and then um phase three that'll be where we put then the roofing over top of the ramp as well as over top of the area that we step out on uh to give us the protection and things like that from the rain and so forth so just so that you you see what's going on the first phase which was the concrete and that's what we had put before um and had to work on and that was the 14 800 the second phase that was the stairs and the railings and having them do it that's seven thousand five hundred dollars and then the phase three brother richie has that estimated out but not with the metal roofing cost yet but that's four thousand just for uh the lumber and right now at this time this is a total before today's offering this is what we have taken in i i know that we may not be experts in math but we can look at that and you can say well that's 16 uh four almost and this over here just don't seem like it's lining up we're about nine thousand dollars off well just so you understand i wanted you to underst understand and be aware of it and the trustees as well is that within a project as we're going through that there is we have a savings but the savings itself is for those things that if something comes up that's completely unforeseen that comes along the way um you know i know we've talked about it different times there's been talks sometimes about sewers and they you know and that's never happened down through there yet but we just tried you know how it is in your own finances you try to have something to offset a rainy day fund and god and that through your giving this right here through your giving and your sacrifice and even with the savings that's there it allows us to keep moving with the project so things are being done and we're just as we're taking the offerings it just continues to go right back in there anything that we have to pull from there and then we have just a few more times going into the fall where we'll do the special offering and then as god with terry and just continuing upon our hearts that we just uh should be able to completely recoup that and continue to put back in savings uh because there's also some other things the brothers you'll see these some of these piles out here and um of rock of the stone and things like that and there's even in the midst of all of this there also you know that the property at times where this with the parking lot there's been a huge need for draining we that's why we haven't been able to put a you know concrete or black top down because you have to have drainage and so that's also they're going to be doing that from the corner back there and all the way out to the street to get that drainage and the neighbor over here next door gus who's been so so good to us um he he's been uh talking to brother richie here for quite some time and he said that he said if you do it he said i'll pay half the cost to get it done so he's because it's a need to that water coming it comes in like that and so we need to get it out there to the street and then as that's being done over here where that grass is you know when you drive out that service drive all of that's going to be graveled in so that the parking lot itself will be extended so we don't have to try to if you look out there right now and probably take some pictures you'd kind of wonder how do people park and we have had some individuals even over the past that you know they've parked over here you know in that grass area my goodness i mean you know you just sink you almost feel like you're in quicksand around here so we we just we thank the lord for that and i ask you just to continue to pray and pray may god richly bless you amen as you give as you've continued to give and amen it's it's certainly a wonderful thing that god has provided for us to be able to do and so i just wanted to update you on that and so that you understand how things are moving along and getting done so at this time i'd like to i think at this time let's just just prepare to turn to the word and um next sunday brian you can turn that off next next sunday the lord willing we want to for all the young people and different ones that are going back to school we're just going to ask the lord's blessing and have have prayer here together next sunday and also ask that you would consider yeah go ahead and come on up brothers come on up for the special offering um see how quick i'll see how quick i forgot that that's bad isn't it that's bad and honey you'd be proud look i maybe just didn't have enough room but please go over the announcements on the calendar look at that there's many things coming up also things that are posted in the restroom that are even not out to you yet such as some meetings that are coming up in september and november uh even for the young people and we're all young we're all young so some of those will be uh coming up as well we'll get that information out to you amen you love the lord amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer brother carlos would you ask the lord's blessing thank you lord jesus thank you yes amen man if you'd like to stand man let's just sing let's sing a little something here on the road to emails [Music] three men walk that way as they reach their destination the two men asked the third to stay and as they talk together breaking bread and pouring wild hallelujah i finally now realize the simplicity of his size how could he desire to have fellowship with there must be something more within that only he can't see i prayed you lord take all my life i gave it all to you oh grant that every day your commune with me grant that every day you'll come with me amen could we just enter into prayer together let's just each and everyone just go before the lord this morning heavenly father lord how we thank you lord for the testimonies of your marvelous grace lord thank you father lord for your hand o god of mercy lord thank you father lord how you provide o god for yourself lord lord we love you this morning we appreciate you lord o god when we just stop lord to think oh god lord as david would say that god how the lord thoughts lord too numerous lord for us to take in lord are your thoughts toward us lord oh god every part in every area lord of our life you have it covered lord every situation lord you have it covered lord it's in control help us lord i pray god that we could just yield more to you lord to your control and to your leadership lord i pray father that lord is just god we've come into a place lord and entering into worship lord oh god just such a wonderful atmosphere lord of the holy spirit to come into lord we just would ask oh god that you'll just come and take your word and speak to our hearts lord god i pray that lord that the same channel lord the same inspiration the same one lord you're the same god that you'll just come lord i pray and breathe lord upon our lives this morning o god come and speak to our hearts lord in a very personal way lord we need to hear from you lord it's your thoughts that we desire lord to hear and and to know and oh god to become personal in our lives we just invite you lord that you'll just have your way now father in the name of jesus christ amen and amen amen would you turn with me to psalms 23 thank you musicians amen psalms 23 i'm just going to begin reading here from verse 1 and just drawing from this as as a background here the psalm of david the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his namesake yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod in thy staff they comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil and my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever amen may the lord bless the reading of the word bless you as you're being seated i'd like to just speak on continue with that thought the lord is my shepherd and we were looking at here just a couple weeks ago and i the question that i posed within that the lord is my shepherd with is who is your king it's very very clear here david is writing under inspiration and david is declaring the lord is my shepherd and all these scriptures you can put together of psalms 23 david is expressing in that very first verse the lord is my shepherd and i shall not want that he's my complete satisfaction that was also david was able to have an experience to the degree that god had given and allotted in that time because the perfect sacrifice had not come right but it was prophecy of what would come when the perfect sacrifice would come when the antitype of the type the lamb of god would come and the blood would be shed for the remission of sins to pay that sin debt that then the lord himself would be a would now come in to dwell in the hearts and lives of an individual then there's this this scripture becomes to the aphex or to the fulfillment the lord is my shepherd i shall not want to where there's no other desire but him and so when we see this i i mentioned to you uh that the when brother branham preaches the message rejected king and i mentioned to you before and i'll say it again just from where i'm we're drawing things from if you haven't listened to he preaches that twice the message rejected king and brother adam goes from preaching the message rejected king going right straight into preaching the adoption series and that's where the placement that we are called to in this hour where the spirit of god taking us fully into christ because we realize where we are at in this hour that it the call and the urn the yearning for of the even the earth is groaning and travailing as it says in romans 8 for the manifestation of the sons of god and we are here in this hour god has sent to you and i the message that message did not it's not been reflected from a seminary it has not been reflected and from from a man's mind remember those seven stars that are in the right hand and the right hand symbolizing the very power of god the godhead all of his strength all of his deity those stars are there not to emit their own light they are there to reflect his light his glory his power all that he is into the church of the living god and then by god's grace not anything that we have done to make ourselves but god in himself knows when he sends his word there's going to be a people though we were not just in darkness in our life paul said we were darkness but there's a there is a part within us a seed like that's buried in the earth that when that reflection of jesus christ is emitted in into this generation there is like a wick on a candle that is made to capture that light and display that light to display jesus christ as the same yesterday today and forever to serve the purpose of god in this hour and that's all the grace of god and so when we when we see that when brother adam was was speaking of this uh in the in rejected king and remember he's just come and i just want to lay this in he's just come from beyond the curtain of time where god allowed him to see beyond the curtain of time and when brother banham steps out from that and coming too he's he's remember he's he's laying there in his bed and he's saying i keep pressing keep pressing keep pressing and he says i'm more determined now than i've ever been and after coming back from that experience he says i can no longer be the same william branham you see every experience that we have with god it brings a further change in our life our further experience with god should in every service and and it should be something we desire just you know spending time with the lord and you don't have to confine it just to a prayer closet on your knees he he's there with you he wants he wants to have a relationship with you he wants to speak to you he wants to know you he wants us to to talk with him and to think of this of how that god in his mercy how that he would speak into our lives that experiences that would so affect us that would cause us to look beyond the things of the world and all the troubles and everything that's there before us i thank god for strength that comes by true holy ghost experiences and so i i start here this morning if we could and i want to look at a scripture out of first samuel 19 and and and and kind of compound on that point of who is your king but i want to compound it with this question this morning have you come under the headship of the word have you come under the headship of the word now headship itself i'm just going to read this definition headship is the position of head or chief or chief authority leadership or supremacy now first samuel 19 and verse 18 we're gonna break in here on on saul and david david's running from saul and here we find even you know the times in in the presence there of saul that saul and that evil spirit would come upon him and he would take that javelin and he tried to even to kill david many times and many things that we could you you know in the scripture that saul was in pursuit of david's spirit of jealousy it was an evil spirit a spirit of malice all of those things and and so when we when we break in on this this is where we're coming to where david himself has fled in verse 18 if you allow me to read this it says in first samuel 19 18 so david fled and escaped and came to samuel to rhema and told him all that saw it done to him and he and saul went and dwelt and nailed and it was told saul saying behold david is at naoth in rhema and saul sent messengers to take david and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying and samuel standing as appointed over them the spirit of god was upon the messengers of saul and they also prophesied and when he was told saul he sent other messengers and they prophesied likewise and saul sent messengers again the third time and they prophesied also then went he also to rhema so into the picture he's been sending messengers and when messengers are getting there to rhema they're coming under that anointing and they start prophesying so eventually if we could say it you know in layman's terms saul is not going to send messengers no more he's going to go so then the bible says in verse 22 then he went also to rhema and came to a great well that is sekku and he asked and said where are samuel and david and once said behold they be it nailed in rhema and he went thither to nail in rhema and the spirit of god was upon him also and he went on and prophesied until he came to naoth in rhema he stripped off his clothes also now down to his linen breeches and prophesied before samuel in like manner let me just stop on that when it says strip down to his clothes you realize what that is that's why wearing shorts is nakedness we'll just drop that in while while that's here hallelujah david was down to a loincloth remember stripped of stripped of his clothes now notice prophesied before samuel in light mammoth manor and laid down naked all that day and all that night and wherefore they say is saul also among the prophets now i want you to remember all of these messengers are not going to salute david or commend david remember saul does not know as far as that he was there to witness david's anointing but saul begins to recognize there is a favor that is about this young man's life as a matter of fact when you read on further in the scripture it was david's behavior his character that actually is what made saul to know he is the king so you see whatever takes place in secret will be made known openly glory be to god but but when we look at this and and this whole the whole thought within all of this stuff the lord is my shepherd i begin to just meditating upon many of these things and you know and and just seeing it and when you look at it he sends messengers and the spirit of god will go upon those messengers and they're there to take david and you know they don't come back with david saul he goes now saul's not going there you and i could look at it if we were to talk to saul on his way to rhema we would say this guy is of no good humor at all he's after david he's he's there to get him we would we maybe the way we would look at it and say how could the spirit of god come upon that and we look at how that he he's pursuing david he's after to take david they see the spirit that's upon him wants to destroy david right but he comes into a situation let's just say he comes into a service and the anointing of the spirit of god comes down upon saul and saul begins to prophesy just like everybody else and no doubt they can look and say you saw my praise the lord the holy ghost has come upon him he's a changed man but when it departs he's the same old saul he's no different so you see the holy spirit can come even in a life if a life has even not truly truly repented you can feel the spirit of god and it's a must that you do sense the spirit of god because it's the holy ghost that leads you to repent of your sins right but to recognize when the anointing itself and as that anointing is coming there saul you can read after this in other chapters he's still the same old saul brother branham remember with the message as we're talking about the headship we're talking about the anointing of the word of the holy spirit as we're referring back in the scripture that that though that in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god it that's what the holy spirit is it is the word of god the heavenly father coming into that life and setting upon the throne in our life not just something that we have an experience with and it leaves us when we're the same person no the holy spirit is come to bring a transformation in our life to where our lives become fully under the headship of the world in other words where christ has full preeminence in every minute detail of our life in other words we don't leave him at church and pick him up whenever we come and and you know put him back on that's not how we serve god that's not the headship of the word but the headship of the word is where the person of jesus christ has come and set down upon that life and it changes that life and that life is ordered by the headship of jesus christ he's preeminent brother iran deals with this and you're very much aware as uh bible readers are and even within the message but i'm just gonna lay this there are three realms that you and i are aware of that we live in we live flesh spirit and soul a person can have the anointing on their flesh and that doesn't change they can have it upon their spirit it doesn't change them but the holy the real new birth is where that saw on the inside that all that old nature that old soul dies and there's a new man that get raised up not not just a divorce a divorce isn't good enough devotee can't be just divorced because jesus will never marry someone who's got a living husband it's against his word are you hearing me that first husband that first nature has got to die is that right that's to where that then that he becomes the lord of our life now brother adam deals with this on how that the holy spirit he said it's got to come in the right order of the anointing because it can fall upon our flesh it could fall upon our spirit but but god's desire is that that word would fall and bring the transformation on the inside of our life this is why when you look uh all the way you can look in many realms of christendom and you see these things that is actually a fulfillment of matthew 24 where it says false christ would arise christ meaning anointed ones they would arise showing many great signs and wonders and they point to the signs and wonders as their vindication but if there but if the voice that's behind that signs and wonders does not speak according to the word it's not of god now i mean you know we thank god for the rain that we've had right i've done my natural rain yeah everybody's awake right i don't know what day it was this week but man i thank god for that rain that came the nice ring kind of cool things down a little human at first but you know what there's i have certain weeds that are growing on the edges of my property i have weeds that are growing in my flower beds that i have to go out there and pick out and underneath different trees and so forth i don't like doing that i wish that i could somehow control the rain and say don't water if you see a weed don't fall on it right look at me trains every one of you would like that same thing and if we had our way we'd go start putting buckets on where they could possibly be we'd have to cover everything but you see that's why jesus said the rain falleth on the just and the unjust the same holy spirit that can come down because man can't do that it's not a devil healing another person satan has no ability or authority to do that it's god is that right but you see this is why that even where the holy spirit coming you know bill the brahman said they can perform just as many miracles as the true gospel but it's by the word being here he says and that's what does it you see he says if the true spirit of god is there it'll direct it into the word not just one place in the word the entire word for the entire age now let me just let me just say it in this manner the scripture says that when the holy spirit is come the comforter when he has come and remember who is this comforter it's god himself it's the holy spirit it's the word jesus said i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you and this comforter says that he might abide with you there's no there's no way once he has come into that rightful place i don't care what test what trial what circumstance comes your way your flesh might get weak your spirit can get weary but you have one on the control tower on the inside who's there to give you strength and direct you through it all and say i don't know how it's all going to happen but i know in whom i have believed and i'm persuaded that he is able not i'm able he is able to keep that which i've committed to him against today so that's our confidence see our confidence comes back into the sacred sands of god's grace and let me tell you something you always you got to visit those sacred sands i i you know brother branham talks about when when here the you know the dreams and visions were happening about the oncoming visitation and the opening of the seven seals remember brother brahm did not know what was taking place and he's standing before his congregation there and he's speaking is this the sign of the insurers and brother graham is looking at things could it be and seeing all these dreams and visions and things beginning to come together and brother brahm says i must get away and i must seek the will of almighty god i must go back to the sacred sands to seek god's direction well what is the sacred sands that's your personal experience with jesus christ those are grounds can i say it that no devil can put his dirty feet on no devil can put his feet on those sacred sands and that's where we go we go to him we're relying on his leadership in our life and so with that being said knowing that every part of our life we need his leadership don't we we need it and you know even when the holy spirit has come uh it's not just so something we just go on autopilot but we become so aware and asking lord lead me and guide me and even when there have been mistakes or decisions or times that we've went off without really seeking his will and really praying about it as a believer we learn from those things we're corrected by the holy spirit on the inside right it brings a correction to our life because this is the promise that the spirit of truth will lead and guide us into all truth and he's still guiding us he's leading us that's what it is you know we're not we're not born again and all of a sudden mature overnight i pray god gives me grace of some things i've studied on for a few years to be able to bring those things but we do not grow up overnight there's a maturing that takes place in our life once we're born of the spirit of god just like the little baby little emma that we dedicated right here if god tarries there's gonna come a time here where brother constantine his wife and they'll have to start watching where she's walking and they'll have to start you know lending their fingers and she'll move from a walker to start doing other things you know all that part is as she's growing and developing and the things that shall be doing and walking and learning to walk all of that is part of growth and development and maturity and that's how it is in our lives as believers now with that i want to just you know bring it into this into this place when we deal with headship and it comes down to a question on who is your leader who is your leader it's very important to know who your leader is because remember there was a group of geese that you know when the geese began to swarm and going south to the you know to the rice fields there in louisiana that here came up a gander and this guy he took them clear over there to england maybe it's because they were canadian geese [Laughter] just a little just a little but you know they still don't know what to do once that that leader got off course and took him over there now that that leader looked the same as them they were hearing his hawk and he was you know he was he was assuming that position but look where it led him they couldn't need they couldn't get back over here because they didn't know what to do where did we miss the mark how did we get out of line oh i i'm so glad that the holy spirit as david said this is the beauty of headship of the word of god that he restoreth my soul let me just say this to you we need his restoration in our lives we need the new birth and we need his restoration each moment his leadership for every aspect of our lives that's why we are thankful for the mercy and the blood of jesus christ to know that we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous that when we repent of our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us oh glory so who who is your leader now let me refer to just a few places in the scripture if i may hosea chapter 8 verse 3 and verse 4. i want you to notice how how hosea under inspiration would be moved to speak this by god now this is the lord speaking here in verse 3 it says israel hath cast off the thing that is good the enemy shall pursue him they have set up kings but not by me you're catching this they have set up kings but not by me i've not led them to do this this is what they've done now remember back to a few weeks ago we're reading that from the church ages god's desire was to raise up a king but it would not be that of just an earthly king there it was god's desire that he was going to come down as their king and pay the prize shedding of the blood and the and then the imparting of his life that was god's idea but satan knowing that he put it in the hearts of the people to get ahead of the plan of god the devil's a slew foot samuel i want to be inspired but you want to see where is your inspiration coming from and when you look at where it's coming from you can tell that by where is it leading you because let me tell you something friends any inspiration that comes from god will not take you away from god things can't be dressed up and says well the lord told me to do this the lord told me to do this if god leads you outside of his word then god is standing oh god forbid i say this but god would be standing as a hypocrite to his own word but god will never lead us against his word because he is the word that's why in all of our leadings and everything else we we just don't go up on a feeling of things we're leading or what we would see we want to know lord is this you i mean everything you know god deals with every one of us differently but even how god over the years would you know one one of the ways he deals with me is through dreams and there's times where i've seen things in a dream that's taken place in homes or you know and throughout within the church but you know brother samuel what did you do well i committed to god because i look at and say lord if that's of you and you gave me that dream then you will help me to see it when it comes to that time sometimes it's not being shown as to prevent something there's times where it's shown that god brings back and says see what i told you now i'm not saying he does that all the time but that just happens to be one of the ways that god deals with me is that right i mean god deals with you in a certain way i trust he deals with you in a certain way i trust it's been you know where it's not a strange thing to hear to hear that god would speak to me i talk about you because we're no different we are brothers and sisters in the economy of god have set up kings but not by me let me move on here in deuteronomy 17 14 notice god is announcing not jumping back before they ever come into the land god is announcing of what will take place he says when thou art come into the land which the lord thy god giveth thee and shalt possess it and shalt dwell therein and shalt say i will set a king over me that sounds familiar because everything you remember in isaiah 14 satan says i will ascend it's always got the eye the eye you know syria had an eye problem but god fixed her eye problem he sent her some eyes to take away her eye and in those eyes came forth the breath of god but notice i will set me up a king over me like as all the other nations round about me i will set it up remember they have made set up kings but not by me in first time you're eight four now we get down into david and saul now notice here are the elders in verse 4 of israel they gather themselves together and they come to samuel unto rhema and they said unto him behold thou art old and thy sons walk not in thy ways now make us a king to judge us like the other nations now you know they might have some good reasoning and some good arguments and say hey you're getting old and your sons don't even they don't even walk they don't even follow the same truth that you're proclaiming so we need a king it might have sounded like good reasoning but what already shows when they got their eye on the other nations they were taking their eyes off of jehovah jireh samuel didn't provide himself god provided samuel god provided that leadership god gave them direction it was not men providing for themselves but god was providing for his people and that's the same way that god does in this hour god provides for us as his children we don't have to shift for ourselves we don't have to go about things on our own ability we can look to almighty god god wants us to trust him this request to be like the world you see it was like we've read in these scriptures it was the desire of the people it was a worldly desire because they were wanting to be like all the other nations we want a king like them well you see they're kings that they had it allowed them to live all sorts of life the kings that they had is why they had all sorts of abominations that were taking place that's why they worshipped other idols that's why there was all sorts of things that was taking place right you see the idols that were worshipped before they ever came in to the land of canaan remember there were things taking place in the land of canaan before israel ever got in there that god was able to say it's an abomination for man to lay with man it's an abomination for a woman to put on a garment that pertains to a man and god let him know the reason that i'm kicking out these inhabitants is for their abominable ways that's what their kings brought to them now notice this they were yet now once you remember when we read here in the scripture they let samuel know that samuel we don't got no problem with you you're a good guy you've never you never you know misused things and you've never taken advantage they couldn't lay a finger on that but they weren't rejecting samuel they were rejecting god but they let him know you know we still want his blessings we still want tongues we still want miracles we we still want all these blessings we we want all of that so don't mistake us there are certain things but you see god's not an extra value menu you need do we go and select what we want from him i'll take this and take this and take this you can deal with this but don't you touch that area of my life don't you touch that lord don't you go there hello somebody see that is why when they're asking samuel you say well if it's their desire and they're asking samuel because they're wanting the blessing of god's representative to bless what their desires are but samuel could say i can't bless your desires because your desires have not come from god and the word is addressing that worldly desire that's in their life but yet that worldly desire says i want a king they desired a king the bible tells us in the book of acts i tell you this is why it behooves every every person every life listen friends our life the desire is that every part of our life that god let my life match this word like brother graham said i don't care he said that my suitcoat matches my trousers but let my life match this word not my imagination but let my life match this word and if there's something that's out of line then quickly we repent of that and say god line me up lord with your word so they they desired a king this is why when brother branham would tell us to be careful on the desires of your heart because god will give you the desires of your heart balaam had desires god let him have his desires that's why with the word of god coming and speaking to our lives we want to have that openness to say lord evaluate my life if there's something that's out of cater if there's something that's out of line lord then let it be lined up lord god let it be lined up put me in desperation oh god to be lined up with your word because we want him enthroned in our lives i don't believe anybody i'm just going to go out here maybe you think i'm going on a limb i don't believe you have taken your time to come here this morning to be religious i don't believe that many pressures and and you know it can be how you're feeling in your body your mind or whatever sometimes it can hurt to even set on those pews i don't believe we've come here to be religious but i believe we've come here to have a meeting with almighty god [Applause] hallelujah we want him to be king not what i want what you want lord what do you want i want my desires to match your will hallelujah you see how they wanted all of that we still want the blessings we want the miracles we still want all this you know the scripture speaks in isaiah there were seven women in this day that would take hold of a man and they would say to that man give us your name this is what we're going to tell you we're the ones controlling what's going on you give us your name to take away our reproach but we're still going to wear our own apparel that's a scripture and eat our own bread you know what bread is bread is the staff of life it's a staff of life we want your name but remember his name is who he is what good does it do to have just a name tact on something if the life isn't there to vindicate it amen it's got his name is a person it's him a manifestation of his word it's the king of glory moving into our life but notice just give us your name let us be identified as christians or message believers and now you know that that'll that'll be so let me tell you something just to be identified around the message will never ever alone deal with sin nature we must be born again and that's why the message has come to lead us beyond just sensation to lead us beyond emotion to lead us beyond just the spirit of god coming down and we say wow wasn't that wonderful wasn't that great the holy spirit has come through the message of the hour to show us there is a deeper walk in jesus christ there's a real victory i want you to think of this here's the lord jesus walking here upon earth he's been walks out of the river jordan here the spirit of god descending in the form of a dove he comes down and he says this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell uh oh here's a change now this is a change taking place here comes an abiding not just the spirit of god resting upon and pulling back now see it did that in the prophets but the prophets david the rest they were truly of the election and they had when david could say take not that holy spirit from me it's just like with the rest of the prophets they didn't they weren't going back and being the same people like saul was see there was even a difference within that but how that god had made a way now it would come for the abiding and the dwelling of himself the dove would come to the lamb now remember jesus life he was one of the most misunderstood people that ever walked upon this earth and here he was moving around here you know you have disciples coming to judas and then you have you know others that you know are not even named it just has part of the multitude of different ones but if you'll notice here in the scriptures let me read this in john chapter 6 this is after here one of the times where the feeding of a multitude it speaks in verse 13 how they had gathered up the remaining fragments of what was there verse 14 it says then those men when they had seen the miracle that jesus did they said this is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world this is critical here in verse 15. when jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force to make him a king he departed again into a mountain himself alone they were wanting to make him a king now we we could sit here and we can speak of it and say well he was the king he is the lord of glory that's come down but he himself makes the way for himself it is him coming into our life that he sets himself forward as king it's not me it's not you that makes him king it is not us taking him by force and this is going to happen it's not by force it's by surrender even though this word this king of glory is full of glory full of power it'll never work and operate in the right way unless we yield to him and his program because they're going to be just like saul anointing comes upon and then leaves off and listen friends i'm not against emotion that should be very obvious to you but neither do we put our stock in emotion see this is where we walk in a balance you know you get i don't even really want to get into that you have people that's all against emotion and they've got all their quotes and all this this listen let him be king stop trying to interpret the king's word and let the king's word be in power [Applause] hallelujah i mean how can you not be emotional when you begin to think about what he's done for you now you may not run you may not jump you might cry but there's something about it that it moves you because it's something we've all been moved in our emotions people tell me they're not emotional ah i've caught them different times of different things whether it's their soccer game or they're this or that oh i'm not that emotional you liar you are emotional it's just you're letting your emotions loose on the wrong things if there's one thing we ought to be emotional about it's the lord of glory who's in our midst [Applause] hallelujah let him have the uppermost seat just hearing brother ryan i'm here the other day lord i didn't know what i was going to do when i heard it because that's how i felt in revelation the reverend brother is preaching the liberal relations series part four i believe it's a part part two there and brother brahman says you know he's talking about being a jesus fiend he said you know when you're a jesus fiend you just can't get enough of jesus you know it's just something about it that you he said you start thinking about him and you he said somebody said they go to preaching about him and and the word starts being preached and something just stirs up within your life you start thinking about it what is it you're a jesus fiend and you've got to have your daily fix hallelujah come on friends we can be so addicted to so many other things sometimes we can be more addicted and dedicated to looking over the news and seeing what this political guy is doing and this political guy's doing let me save you the trouble they're lying like they did the day before and they'll be lying tomorrow but we have a kingdom that has come in power and that we should give our lives to [Applause] more interested in seeing this headline when's the last time when you got up a morning you cracked the bible open you opened up maybe on your app you've got to we got a reading app when's the last time that that has taken place when's the last time you've approached it in prayer oh i'm just trying to get a wake of a morning well what a thing to wake up to inflation and this and that and everything else wow that got to lift your spirits that ought to be encouragement for the day i'm sure when you get to looking at that you're wondering saying where's that devil at bless god i just read on inflation today i don't think so you think that we are who have the smartphones would be smarter than the phones come on friends every one of us can get into a habit but thanks be to god for the grace of god our king will not leave us that way he'll come and speak to us and because there's the headship of the word in our life we can say yes lord yes lord jesus could stand there in pilate's hall and you know they were talking to him in pilate's hall and asked him and he was a king he said thou says yeah he said my kingdom is not of this world but what the pharisees and the rest of them that wanted to make him king they wanted to put him in a position they were doing it not by god's desire and god's will they were doing it by their own will and let me tell you something just as much as the word caught what they were trying to do and slipped out of their grasp that's the same way he'll do in your life if you try to take the word and place it in an area of your life and you're trying to put it here and put it there jesus won't be manhandled jesus your lord i need you to take care of this you can't take him by force he will depart right out of your midst what must i do surrender i know it's very simple but it's surrender let me tell you something you know you and i couldn't even surrender in the right way unless he himself had surrendered in the garden he experienced that surrender that you and i have to go through that's what my king has done for me it's not somebody who gave me a list to do this and do that but he came down and took his own wires his own laws upon himself [Applause] though he were a son yet he learned obedience by the things that he suffered he experienced what it was nevertheless not my will thine will be done prayed that way three times knowing what surrendering is knowing what dying is to self praise the lord that god might have his way in our life they wanted a messiah you're familiar with these terms thinking of this world's falling apart again you hear these these statements the pharisees and them they want they want to know you know it's kind of like this political party gets together and we're going to stand on the floor we're going to act like we're enemies but we're going to go out as buddies afterwards we're going to act like we're different come on friends we're not kool-aid drinkers here we know but jesus when he's there among them they're testing him and to them they're looking at him and saying hey you ain't conforming to us hey hey you're not conformed you can't this this can't be they couldn't deny one miracle they couldn't deny one thing jesus going down and led by the spirit of god and that man who was raised up on the sabbath one of them who was raised up on the sabbath and goes down to the pool of bethesda you know many of the other places in the scripture and they wanted to take him because you violated the law the scripture also says jesus gives a parable he says that the son of man coming in this generation as the one who entered the marketplace and others were sitting around piping and he didn't come and dance according to how they wanted him to dance you see because the king does not march to the beat of the world the king of glory comes according to his word that's why it is not that we and i that can take the king and i'm going to set him here i'm going to set him there but it's got to be a yielding to his life and invite him that lord you would become king in my life now let me read this to you here brother graham's talking about out of hebrews chapter 10 and maybe this will come together a little bit here he says you know in hebrews 10 it tells us if the worshiper is once purged he has no more conscience or desire of sin the whole thing is gone from him you don't have to sin every day you don't have to do these things you do it because you willfully want to and the reason you willfully want to is because you never did die to yourself now what's he addressing where is the king is the king only on the flesh is he only in your spirit or is he seated in the throne of your life because once he sees sets on that throne that's his seal the world has passed away from our life is that right now he says when you die to yourself he said i know that scorching but it's good when you die to yourself then you become a new creature then those things are gone and if you try to act like you've got them before you have them it's like i said the other day like a black bird trying to put peacock feathers in his wings and you see i'm a peacock but he said it isn't that is something that he has stuck in his south it has to grow from the inside out [Music] it's not enough just to come and well i'll tell you oh my i've been to church here on on sunday or been to church on thursday and friends if all you're leaving is and there can be a refreshing there can be a oh my just i tell you the the presence of god just feels so relaxing it feels so resting but god's desire is that that would be that way in your soul so it's not walking back out into the world like saul did saul came under the anointing but he went right back out and he continued on the same way that is the way now watch how brother brad words this on the way back he said that's the way the holy spirit is it's not something you smear on or something like that it's a new birth you've got to be born again and these virtues of the holy ghost has to come from the inside out and when the world and sin and cutting hair and painting you can line everything else up comes out against the word of god it shows the holy spirit is not there it might be on the flesh and on the spirit but is it there meaning where it should be now let me say this forgiveness is a wonderful thing thank god for forgiveness that comes our way thank god that even as holy ghost-filled believers that when we do ask god for forgiveness it might just be for a thought passing through whatever as it comes our way thank god there is forgiveness but let me just say this to you because sometimes i've had things where where where you know and i'm in meetings and things like that where you know it's coming i just need a refilling and it's not a refilling of the holy ghost they need a feeling of the holy ghost they need an experience of the holy ghost because forgiveness itself is an experience are you hearing me but forgiveness that same way that that comes upon your life that you feel like wow that's gone from my life that's what god wants to do in your soul and it drives out all fear it drives out all fear of failures because you can't fail because god can't fail you're no longer tied to your family tree by the nature amen so it's not you making him king it's where we surrender and he takes that rightful position we don't want to have a worldly desire you realize somebody could take the word right here and they can take the word but have a worldly desire with it that's still continuing on in their same life in their same walk now listen let's go deeper because it's deeper than just not smoking and drinking and running around committing adultery and all those are all things those are all attributes of unbelief but god came not just to deal with attributes but to deal with the root cause you can still be free of all those things and still not under the headship of the word and that's god's working in your life of saying yes lord be it unto me but remember don't stop until he has become enthroned in your life don't just go to a certain spot and say well i'm pretty good i recognize god sent a message i recognize god this is the prophet you know i've had an experience with god a real experience with god does not allow you to settle down we're getting tougher now but when it's not us making him king it's him that declares he is king see this is where the scripture would say that he that's joined let me just refer to these scriptures here without reading them exactly first first corinthians 6 and verse 13 he that is joined to the lord is one spirit not two different people one spirit romans 8 16 said the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god so there's a witness with the holy spirit in our spirit we're the children of god i'm a child of god this is why when the scripture would say first john 5 6 this is he that came by water and blood remember i read this to you a couple weeks ago even jesus christ not by water only jesus was not just a good man who was born all of us came by water but there was a distinction here came one by water and blood a blood that could handle the sin question a blood that can deal with unbelief a blood that can remove every hindrance prepare ye the way of the lord and here it is the spirit that beareth witness because the spirit is truth now let me just try to move this into this point where we're looking on headshit this is where the danger becomes of taking man as your leader when i'm saying this man is your leader i'm not just talking about a man i'm talking about ideas of man i'm talking about our own ideas about things there's the danger of taking man as our leader god will operate now let's bring it into ephesians 4 bringing it into other places of scripture god operates through man but it is not man leading man it is god leading his people through surrendered vessels it's god not man it's god he leads his people by his word i know we quote hebrews 13 8 that says jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever but the verse above that says what remember them that have the rule over you considering the end of their conversation but how is that rule that rule is not man ruling over man like you'll do what i say the people of god are not moved into position by force are you hearing me that's why the people of god you're not moved into position by of something being you know a force and hammering on this and hammering on that but there's how god works because the leader let me tell you something the leadership of the holy spirit is so much greater than our thinking about things can i give you a little example here i'm just listening here this morning and brother graham's talking of a sister who was getting ready to leave and go back home from the meeting she didn't feel she she wasn't going to be able to stay there any longer and the holy spirit said you remain at this meeting because you're going to receive a prayer card and you're going to be the third one that's called she shows up to the meeting brother billy paul they're giving out cards guess which one she gets number 97 she looks at the card and says how in the world lord you spoke to me she knew that lord you spoke to me to stay here and not fly home and brother and i'm here in that moment he's directed by god he says now we're going to start and we're going to call up 10 and we're going to start with the last card 199 98 97. you say brother samuel why would god do that to break us out of our order he lets you and i know he's in control [Applause] the greatest control there is is when we realize i have no control over this but there is one who is here that's in control that's the greatest reality when i'm ministering in a meeting in a service when he comes down and all been my control everything there is gone the nerves disappear all those things because he steps down and begins to speak [Applause] hallelujah oh glory be to god so the prophet let me let me come down into this here the prophet could say and ask us the question god's chosen place abortion where am i going to take you to if i'm leading you somewhere where am i going to take you all right he said am i going to take you to branham tabernacle he said that's as much as fault as anywhere else why because it won those same spirits were there listen friends the spirits just so maybe this is a a wake-up call the spirits don't just remain out there in denominations the difference is we have the answer to the devil's question jesus christ very simple is the same yesterday today and forever sometimes problems take us maybe take our breath away like but remember remember remember who your king is your king my king has never lost a battle [Music] there's been some of subjects that have let down on the word but the word's never been defeated never been defeated where am i going to take you he says i think about it he's not taking us to a church but he's taking us and pointing us to jesus christ brother brown could make that statement not for one moment do i bring a message that people might follow me or that i might build some organization but he said there's one true purpose and desire that i have had and that's to see a real relationship between god and his people that's the call of the hour is relationship a god who goes with you that god who speaks and he deals with your heart and your life to go with you let me let me try to bring this here down can i read this see brother branham praying god's chosen place of worship dear dying lamb may it never do that he's talking about become a denomination if i go in this generation may the people who believe this message never stand still for a denomination you'll die right in your tracks remember that he says the very hour that you mention denomination among you i don't care how sincere you are take man for your leader instead of the holy spirit to confirm this word that's the hour you die the genuine seed cannot because there's nothing left after the seed it's the same thing was back at the beginning it's the bride that fell into the ground to bring forth the corn of wheat again i want you to notice these words this as i was meditating my family and i we were on vacation a lot of this work this whole thing inspiration i'm just setting and we we were getting ready to watch a production on david and all of this some of them my family knows when we they started after this production started talking i just kind of i said a little quiet because i didn't dare take my phone out because i was wanting to start scriptures and quotes and everything as i said there but i was amazed at even how that the way that they went and even i think it was benjamin talking about it when we were sitting around he says you know it just wasn't something it was just surface levels because so many things today that they it's portrayed just as christians just surface level but they really went into some depth on things and one of the things that they had showed and i thought it was really incredible because this was already upon my heart what god was dealing with my heart on the lord is my shepherd you know you can't control when the anointing comes and all those things sometimes i just say god help me to remember it and i try to use my fingers as much as i can and getting things down and grabbing this quote and this scripture and god just keeps on compounding it throughout whether i'm sitting in my office or out so that flow was going on and i i said god maybe if you have have this for us then then then you you'll be the one to direct me and guide me and i'm i'm thinking of this quote this whole is something i was even meditating on where brother brown made that statement he says may the people who believe this message never stand still for a denomination now i want you to notice what he's mentioned stand still denomination and taking man as your leader all those three things are synonymous with one another because to dominate what is it to denominate this is what we believe and that's it not going on any further but we know the bible said when the spirit of truth has come he will lead and guide us into all truth it's a walk it's a journey it's a relationship it's a continual unfolding in our lives it's not just standing still as though that we've made it you can be backslid without even realizing your backslid backslid is to get cold on god and if the prophet himself could stand there and say even how paul could say i die daily it wasn't compromise but it's showing that where our lives are at and especially with the hour that we're living in it ought to be something in our lives that we're taking inventory and not out of fear but our desire is that the king of glory would have his way in our lives let me say this it can be very dangerous to take somebody else's idea the word of god we recognize that the word of god is our absolute the message that god has sent to us is an absolute and when that same life has come inside of us that's an absolute and what does it do it ties us to the word of god that no matter what comes here or there we're anchored not by our own strength we have not made the word by our own strength but we are yoked with the word by the holy spirit and we're taking him as our leader abraham said when you take man as your leader to confirm the word instead of the holy spirit that's the very moment you die can't be man's ideas it's got to be the holy spirit he confirms the word he confirms his own working in our lives this is why that with man's ideas there can be there could be many patterns that can be sent out before you well my dad did this or my mama did this sir brother and sister so and so do this don't get your eyes on brother and sister so-and-so because brother and sister so and so their hearts might be already on the turn away are you hearing me well i know so and so did this and and this seems to be okay you don't make other people your example and if you're wanting to wrestle with that and hold on to that you need to come back and look in your life and say wait a minute god you're dealing with my life where are my desires at are you with me we don't want to make excuses we want to invite the king of glory we want to make a calling and election sure is this all right we want to take our cues and our leadership from the holy spirit you catch what i said we want to take our cues and our leadership from the holy spirit not from culture not from somebody else we want to take it from the holy spirit we want to be in contact with him as he comes through the word let me just say it like this you see brother brown was not taking us to a church he was not leading us to a movement this message is not a movement man has tried to make it a movement man has wanted to set up camps around it are you hearing me now the reason every denomination has ever come about and brother bram says clearly like this and we can say amen to it it's because of the lack of the revelation of jesus christ this message is not a movement this message does not put limitations and say oh this is too deep of a situation this is a bad thing but the message is jesus christ the son of man revealed right here among us it's not books it's not tapes it's the veil taken off the seals taken off of jesus christ where the church has saw him and the church looked upon him and they wanted to take him by force but he slipped out of their grasp he won't be taken that way he will not come and yield and put a crown upon worldlyism upon worldly desire upon theology he will never set down upon that as long as saul is still alive you can't put the crown on his head are you hearing me as long as saul is still alive you can't put the crown on his head but when saul has passed away the unction of the holy spirit began to move him to hebron he brought a place of the fathers begins to move him to that place and they moved to crown david king first in hebron what took place in hebron elohim came down to visit abraham on the plains of memory it's the place of the fathers but you see not to a church not to an idea but it's to the lord himself this is why all of this gospel when it's preached in its purity it's redemptive power it will only take an effect on you if you believe it and receive it that's the only way it can work is if you believe it and you receive it let the king of glory ride in in power my it's just hard to find a place where to even to stop but the holy spirit is sent to be the leader of our lives see we don't want to take a portion of the word and we're taking this and the lord's the king god's the king he's the king of my life and our life is still deadly dangling with the world still up and down and in and out still everything else you see when it comes out of our life david was recognized as king by saul god had anointed him because of the character he displayed the holy spirit makes us more than just good moral people when the king himself has come down our lives are set on fire there's things where decisions and he becomes the very absolute of every part of our life it's not us that makes ourselves christians it's him david would also write the lord as my shepherd he would say we are the sheep of his pasture it is not us that have made ourselves he hath made us it's a working of the holy spirit that moves into our life it's christ forming himself in our life stay with me here i'm closing when you hear the holy spirit as it comes and these things that he has spoken to us even here this morning to bring a real examination in our lives i would implore you i would encourage you don't sit there in defeat oh brother samuel i haven't went deep enough this is the king calling to you to go deeper to where you you get tired of just having an experience of forgiveness over and over and over as brother branham describes it in the rejected king he said people have taken in the manner well i repent of it when i you know do wrong and i'm i'm i'm okay until i do it again but rem said something's wrong something's wrong it's not just you see this is this is what the working of the holy spirit comes to do is to bring about a real change in our life do we need forgiveness we do need forgiveness but you are made to live and walk in victory you were made to be an example a display everywhere you go in your homes and everywhere then i'm a christian i say here this morning don't try to take him by force but let him take a hold of you let him go deeper let the holy spirit go deeper in your life if there's things that you've got off a little you've gone off a little target there's certain things that's pulled your way that you know the holy spirit dealing with your life that you know what i've made some decisions that i didn't run by the king i didn't run these decisions by the king maybe the king has been trying to tell you and you wonder why does brother samuel keep ministering on this and why does this minister keep this and why do i hear that it's not brother samuel i don't go around and look and look for things you understand that i don't go around and look and say let me see who i can hit now we're here to minister the word we're here to be a blessing we're here to help but if there's something that what you've been as you're hearing the holy spirit deal with don't discount it don't put it off recognize that's the love of almighty god and his brother uh uh jack could minister and take that thought their rock is not like our rock let me tell you their king is not like our king their king don't care for them their king doesn't care if they're religious if they take this up and and they have you know an imagination of jesus and and they have pictures of jesus their king he doesn't care how many pictures of the prophet we have he doesn't care how many message books we have doesn't care how many quotes we know that king doesn't care but our king cares our king says what that messenger was set for was with the message for you he came all the way god came all the way from glory with you and me in mind god sent this message with you and me in mind and this message never came to turn our heads he came to turn our hearts that the king would take his rightful position in our life i'm i'm just i i just thank god for his mercy in this hour that i think that in a service in a time like this that wow what a moment that god is here to break back veils veils where satan would want to put up and saint would love to drive you away from here you do anything he can to get you away from the presence of god from the word of god that can help you and he would like to bring condemnation on your life things that he has led you to do and you've done them and then he'll turn around and say there's no hope for you and he's the one who's been the one inspiring and leading but there is one here this morning with grace he's here to inspire you even in your mind and in your heart right now to think back go back to what you was go back return back to what god's desire is for a real man for a real woman he wants to be the king in our life but not what we make him to be because we can make things and then we go out we're the same people do the same things and i say that this morning by the grace of god because there's a there's a king here not a king but the king amen amen that is here to bring change this morning amen he's here to bring a deeper experience and a deeper walk he's here to bring renewing in hearts that could sit here and say samuel i know i've had an experience would have passed from death unto life but maybe your focus has gotten a little bit off on things we have normal tasks of life don't we we have task of life things you have to do don't feel condemned about that but sometimes we can get we can get off track and our focus off in the wrong things and looking at this and looking at other things and god is standing there the whole time and saying i'm your provider i'm your keeper i'm your sustainer you don't have to go to anybody else's shoulder i'm here i'll pull you up to my bosom hallelujah he wants to be your king he wants to have the headship the preeminence of every decision in your life let me tell you how great our king is i love how brother brown will say this over and over and forgive me for continuing to take time but as it's coming he said what makes him so great to me is how he's willing to make himself so simple it's satan that wants to complicate things it's satan that wants to try to tinker with the simplicity that is in christ and make it far out it's not something that's hard or complex it's surrender it's yielding to you you might have to wrestle it out but there is god our king is there inspiring us to wrestle it out our king is there inspiring us in that portion of the word just as he did when he was there in the garden of gethsemane our king is here to inspire us to move into his word i think every one of us and you could say the lord i want your will yes i want to evaluate decisions that's been in my life maybe you can look in your life and see at one point you've been pretty fervent but what's happened what's happened you used to be really resilient about being in the house of god used to be really resilient about those things well you say brother samuel it doesn't make a difference if we come to the house of god or not it does if you can help it i know some of you are placed in different localities some of you you know the way things happen at different times but remember remember within all of this it's important when we come together getting a little quiet on this one now is he king or not the bible said forsake not to assemble ourselves together then you understand that's not brother samuel brother samuel's trying to get people here to preach to i'm not trying to get people here to preach to i'm trying to tell you that if that right there is something that you start making excuses for there's some things you need to really examine in your life and that's not to put you down you understand what i'm saying friends i love you i couldn't stand here and minister this but it's important that we look at it because if not then we take the message and say well i'm all right i'm okay we don't want to stand still we want him to be king in every decision that we make not patterning off of one another but following his leadership i thank god for there is other examples but for me and my house i'm praying and i'm asking god for leadership because every one of these young men that i have right here they're all three different remember when god the angel of the lord came to samson's mother he revealed the purpose for that child's life and the mother was praise god praise god which a mother would be glory to god there's a there's a child cutting the mother would be that way but the father taking his responsibility said ask that and ask that man to come again and the father asks of that man seeing that the child shall be this way how shall we order it see because the father is entrusted with leadership of that home the mother's excited she should be there's a baby coming praise god i'm expecting and the father said ask him to come again because god knows the secret that's bound up in that child's life and i want to be under the leadership so i guide in the right direction it's looking for the king of glory so we don't want to hang our heads i don't want to encourage you let's move on let's move don't don't don't don't don't continue in the same pathway if you've gone off track it's time to get back in step it's time to ask god to renew the vision in your life say lord let that word that word to be the headship and that shows whether that word is in its place or not let's pray heavenly father lord jesus lord with the direction this inspiration lord that you have lord given to speak with lord questions that cause us to reflect that we might give an answer amen not an answer as it were to you but an answer as though that lord we might be able to reflect upon our own lives of where are we as you've taken us lord in this place to ask us the questions who is your king are we under the headship of the word who is your leader because all of these comes together lord we don't want a man's idea we don't even want to look back over our shoulder we don't want to look at someone else we want to look to you every father every mother lord gathered right here every husband every wife every every young person every lay member every one of us father who want to seek your face i pray lord right here this morning i i know there's needs i know there's a lord you just didn't send me with this lord for the words just to fall to the ground i i don't believe that lord there's a purpose there's a plan there's an objective right here in this this service this morning is that lord there would be hearts and lives that would accept the grace and mercy of god and say lord i need a deeper experience and lord that wouldn't invite you or god to go deeper lord even for every every one of our lives lord we want lord a lord a deeper experience with you lord jesus we want to know you more lord father every every part in every area of our life oh god we we want you to have the preeminence it's not just something lord that we would say but god that would reflect itself in every decision that we make lord help us lord i pray god i don't trust my flesh lord i have no confidence in this flesh lord but my confidence is in you my confidence is the working of the word of the holy spirit in my life those sacred sands that's that's where i have confidence lord and we look to you lord father i pray this morning if there is one that's here the lord there they've realized it's just lord where they've tried to take and make you king by their own will by their own force instead of surrendering their will may they lord jesus lay down their life right now lay down their will may they lay everything down lord at your feet this morning like those lord that took off their garments and laid them up on the ground with the palm leaves and you came riding in lord it speaks of us willingly laying down our own lives that god that you might ride in in power and glory lord god you're the one who does the impossible things that are thought to be impossible lord you specialize in it just as lord i brother constance constantine lord i think oh god it's very fitting for that testimony to be given right here this morning of two things lord where they were standing here lord for prayer i believe it was sometime last fall december somewhere around that time lord but that deformity that they said was in that arm but lord when they went back sometime later there was no deformity there you moved on the scene lord and you made that which showed up as a deformity you moved on the scene lord to straighten it out then to see right here this morning lord is a condition with the blood but god to see how the lord that you have healed that little girl that little baby of that blood condition lord there's a real blood condition there's a blood that's greater than that blood that came lord by the first birth that lord jesus that god the blood that was shed and inside of that blood that blood cell there is a life the life that lord after the price has been paid can come back upon the worshiper lord and bring us under that blood to where we lose all our guilty stings where everything lord every worldly desire all the things of the world lord have fled away and it's you lord it's you the king in our lives lord every one of us are at different stages i realize that i realize lord here this morning there's lives that have not surrendered to you and lord that would be you calling to them lives that have but you calling them to a deeper experience lives that's had a real genuine experience with you and you're calling them to a another a deeper experience lord jesus help us lord to recognize that lord all that you ask of us is that we would yield and surrender our lives to you let this word let it have an effect in our life granted lord i know there's hearts and lives lord that they get tired of being they're tired of being up and down tired of lord just seems like things come and go they're tired of living that way and i trust they are i trust that lord they're at a place to recognize that you care you care very deeply lord and your desire is to bring a real change in their life to give them a strength to be their king granted lord we pray may every worldly desire lord may it fade away may lord hearts and lives be so aligned to you oh god aligned from everything of this world lord grant it lord we pray in every area of our life lord have your way father in jesus precious name amen amen could we just just sing something do you love him this morning oh hallelujah my shepherd [Music] and i shall not want hallelujah god would say you see saul when thing was saul saul kept on doing what saul wanted to do but god made an announcement he said the lord hath sought him out a man after his own heart oh my how the holy spirit it seeks he moves in the very depths of our life god let every desire let every every part of our life let my life match you lord let my life let it match you in every way hallelujah glory be to god let's just worship him if you need prayer this morning we'd be happy to pray with you hallelujah but let's let's take a hold let's take a hold up on almighty god this morning just as we worship enter into worship now you say brother samuel it's i don't even know what time brother samuel it's 1 30. it's past 1 30. and i know sometimes friends listen i know sometimes you have to go there's things that comes up you have certain things that press and you have to leave sometimes for a job you know that you know what i'm saying but if all we're doing is getting in a hurry to go out and eat at a restaurant and we're looking at time as though come on come on we've been here two and a half hours why don't we think that way about the things of the world why don't we respond that same way because those things don't have life how come we don't say come on two and a half hours here we've been fishing come on no anyone say that i'm not picking on fishing either because i've been fishing two and a half hours we've been playing this volleyball game no we don't say that we're not saying hey come on come on brother richard let's go let's go let's get another game going here come on i got no you see how subtle things can creep in and it's like we we get into such a place to where everything's just like a rush but he wants to be king he wants to be king hallelujah i didn't say that to condemn me i said just evaluate it you know you know where you're at there have been times in my family or i've we've had to leave but you understand what i'm saying i think we need if we're able to be here and to worship the things i say god i don't want to put you on a time schedule [Music] hallelujah probably everybody right now is afraid oh if i get up and leave no i trust we're more we're more mature than that but you understand that that's for us i can't examine god knows every one of our hearts right but i think it's so fitting to worship him i think about it that the world has put him out they wanted to grasp him and that he would anoint their denominational system but they couldn't lay hold on him they couldn't lay hold on the word but here he come and knocks on our heart and said hey if you open the door i'll come in amen where the world could not lay hold on him but a heart that's willing to open it can as solomon would speak of the bride where the bride would hold the king in the galleries the king would be held by her beauty her character her life [Music] well
