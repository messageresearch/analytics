want to ask that god that you would move upon every need tonight lord though we stand here lord there's a decision lord as we've come to the house of god tonight but we realize lord that the real stand in our life is not by our strength alone but oh god the secret of our strength is you lord it's the word of god residing in our lives lord so father our testimony is like paul that it's the lord who strengthens us we can do all things lord because you are the strength of our life father we pray tonight lord that you'll just move upon every need o god may you just speak to our hearts in a very personal way lord help me just to step aside tonight lord that you'll just come lord and just say what needs to be said lord may you move among us lord father without your presence lord well this

lord just present ourselves and lord ask that you would come lord take control lord of every part of the service may you pour out of your spirit lord we pray for every need o god may we leave from this place lord a different people lord a better people lord more determined oh god our lives lord filled with your presence we pray father we ask it lord in the name of jesus christ amen and amen amen god bless you as you have your bibles i want to go to joshua chapter 1 once again and i'm just i'm going to read through the first few verses they're beginning with verse 1 just to pick up from where we were looking at a few weeks back and here we come into joshua 1 1 it says now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord spake unto joshua the son of none moses minister saying moses my servant is dead now therefore arise and go over this jordan thou and all this people unto the land which i do give to them even to the children of israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have i given unto you as i said unto moses and if we could go on down to verse 5 there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life and as i was with moses so i will be with thee i will not fail thee nor forsake me be strong and of a good courage for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which i swear unto their fathers to give them let's come here into verse seven only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observed to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper whether soever thou goest this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success have not i commanded thee be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee whether so ever thou goest amen may god bless the reading of the word as you're being seated tonight i want to continue to look into this thought here tonight on inquiring of the lord and um we've been speaking on prayer since back there in january very just very specifically on that thought because prayer as we see it is it is uh it's a great privilege of the believer but it's also how that god has entrusted us that our faith would even operate to ask whatsoever you ask in in prayer and in faith believing that shall you also have we are supposed we are it's over and over that god has uh encouraged us to ask for those things the promises and what and what pertains to us and when we look here into the scriptures in joshua we know that this parallels the time that you and i that we are are living in in this hour uh to think of how that god sent a message down into egypt a prophet vindicated with the pillar fire with a message of deliverance and that message was to that was to call him out of egypt and take them into the promised land and we see even how that they were in that of the wilderness for a great deal of time but the wilderness was never meant to be the home of israel they were never meant to get comfortable there it was only a part which they were passing through and that's when we look and we can even see in the unfolding of things of even how that we know when the spies went over there were ten that went over and they looked at the opposition and they said we're not able to go in but there were two that said we're more than able to take the land we find ourselves in the time that we here we are living in that where the church has dwelt so long in the wilderness and god made a promise in his word that the church would not remain in the wilderness but the church must come into the place that god ordained them to be which is what it was back on the day of pentecost where it was not just a portion of god's life but it was the very god himself christ in his fullness dwelling in the life of the people it would be that of a life of a full word on display and we see how that the enemy came in to take away from the word even in the very beginning in that ephesian age but we are living in the time and the fulfillment where god has promised there would be another ephesians and god has done that and is doing that in this hour to take a people that you and i would come in to our position in jesus christ it would not be something that an organization can do but it would be a work of the holy ghost himself just as it was made known to joshua moses my servant is dead and we know that moses was a type of organization it could never take the people of god into position but yet god in his grace that was there all along joshua would bring the people into their position into a place of rest in the lamb to what god ordained for them what god had in his mind all along we are living in this moment we are living in a time to where when the scripture would call for and desire for the manifestation of the sons of god we are living in this hour and let me say this there is no way for that to happen the manifestation for the sons of god outside of god himself coming down in this hour and manifesting his word to draw you and i out and bring us fully into him this is god's work it is grace that has worked all along but now this is the time where the shoutings of grace grace unto it and so we're living in that time of of god's grace to you and i and i want to just draw the attention here in the scriptures if we can look at it of how that we see the certainty and this is just to draw from this because canaan itself is a type of overcoming canaan itself is a life that is being lived in the holy ghost canaan is the promised land of the believer which is the type of the holy ghost by one spirit we are baptized into one body and i want you to notice the word that we read here even in our text that there is no maybe there is no perhaps there is no might be but there is a certainty in everything that god has spoken to joshua as a matter of fact god has let him know it's time to rise up and it's time to move forward it's time to go across this jordan and notice everything is certain when we read those first few verses and i that verse you know in verse 5 there of joshua 1 to me is a powerful verse you know with just just a touch on him there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life no matter what it looks like no matter the opposition no man shall be able to stand before thee now it's not speaking of the natural man joshua but it is the word that he is walking and is veiled in his life that satan has to recognize that word is that right brother bran would say he said now satan you don't have to obey my voice but you have to obey him who i represent is that right so notice as i was with moses so i will be with thee what a comfort that that was god was letting joshua know there's going to be some bumps and hiccups and mistakes and failures but that's not the focus i'm going to be with you just as i was with moses what was god saying here without dwelling on this too much tonight is that your humanity is not going to be done away with but my glory will become so preeminent in your life it will override even your humanity sometimes we need we need the overriding of the glory of god when we have made mistakes when we have made decisions without inquiring of him first we need the grace of god overriding that is able to instruct us teach us correct us and help us so that we might go forward i will not fail thee nor forsake thee what a what a promise but notice god's requirement in verse 7 only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law that moses my servant has commanded you don't turn from it to the right or to the left so in verse 7 and verse 8 which i can continue to read god's letting joshua know that victory is certain but there's something that you must do in everything as it comes to the end of verse 8 that for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success how will that be see that this word does not depart out of your mouth in other words let your life become so wrapped up in this word take things that you don't understand but meditate on it put it before god in prayer and say god i know this is my promise let your life become wrapped up so that you become so far away from your own natural sense-bound way of acting and you become god-like in your actions talking about manifestations of the sons of god because there is a power there's an atmosphere in this word i i'm telling you when you know you go to listening to the word you go to reading the word there is an inspiration in the word of god and inspiration that has come upon the word in this hour man didn't bring that inspiration that inspiration has come from almighty god this book has laid filled with promises it was just like that violin that laid there but there took a master one who knew how to play it and begin to unfold the promises that are in there oh my and god had a vessel on earth in this hour that god could come down in are you hearing me now there's no way to get the music out of the record without a victrola needle put up on the record and that needle is god's gift to this generation god said he would send the prophet and a prophet is not here with his own thoughts he's not here to speak his own understanding but this is the spirit of wisdom that daniel prophesied there would be a time of understanding that would strike the church of the living god and this is god's promise he would have a needle that would come down upon the record of the word and begin to release and reveal the thoughts and the contents that were sealed within so what should i do wrap yourself in this joshua just wrap yourself into it amen i think we need to live within this message i don't think it ought to be when we come to the house of god this is the only time that we're hearing excerpts from the message we need to avail ourself in the message of the hour we need to put it on put it on when you're driving put it on in your home avail yourself in it you say brother samuel what are you talking about i'm talking about inspiration brother and sister when i'm sitting and i'm listening or i'm walking and i'm listening i tell you there's inspiration after inspiration and even after that message is off or i've had to pause it there's still inspiration that is moving out i'm not standing here preaching my inspiration i'm preaching by an inspiration of almighty god that's why the prophet could say in the third exodus what is he said that cloud out there in sabino canyon he said it's the inspiration that has come to the church of the living god to lead us out of creeds and dogmas and lead us to a living reality where now is not god and man twain but god and man have become one hallelujah so this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth be wrapped up in this let it be wrapped up in your life brother brandon would say it like this and i referred this to you before he said thy mouth what you're saying just don't read it and walk away speak it live it teach it i'm going to say god let me be so wrapped up remember how brother julie used to talk about that caterpillar he said that old ugly caterpillar he said but that ugly caliper he said what happened is he said it comes to a certain time it just starts spinning and what happens it begins to get wrapped up and tied up and tangled up right and inside of that cocoon uh that it has what takes place on the inside of there in the secret place there is a metamorphosis there is a change from an old ugly caterpillar it'll come out in a determined date of a beautiful butterfly what is it that butterfly was there in it the whole time it but it took that and that getting wrapped up getting tired of getting tangled up getting wrapped up it would release the butterfly on the inside let me say this the only thing that will release victory in our life that releases a son and god a daughter of god is the word of this hour there is inspiration that god is poured out in this hour and that gives you in our inspiration of how to pray and what to pray about glory be to god oh my now notice this we want to be wrapped up notice let's go to joshua chapter 3 here we're talking about inquiring of the lord because god let him know no man will be able to stand before you but i want to tell you this only be strong and very courageous stay before the word amen hallelujah now joshua chapter 3 verse 1. joshua rose up early in the morning and they removed from him and came to jordan he and all the children of israel and lodged there before they passed over and it came to pass after three days that the officers went through the host and they commanded the people saying when you see the ark of the covenant of the lord your god and the priest bearing it then you shall remove from your place and go after it now notice here the people have come to a place the report has come back to joshua regarding jericho it's come back already that the people are trembling the people of the land are fearful and what they're fearful about is what god has done in the past come on now but you can't live off a past revelation you've got to have a press in revelation hallelujah that's why you might it must be present in our life that's why there must be a refreshing oh hallelujah notice he told the people when you see the ark of the covenant of the lord your god and the priests are bearing it then you shall remove from your place and go after it oh my so not after the priest but after the word as it's moving verse 4 yet there shall be a space between you and it about two thousand cubits by measure come not near unto it that you may know the way by which you must go how many like tailgating anybody like tailgaters people who drive on your bumper so close you could reach back and floss their teeth if you you get i mean you really i mean if probably if you're like me or somebody else you know you just you just start to slow down and hope they just go on around you because you don't know what they're doing you don't know what they're on you're just thinking if if they keep going this way if i have to stop for sure we're going to get it in in in in the back right but he noticed when you when a person is tailgating so close they can't catch if there's a sudden movement like if a cat runs out or something happens and you have to make a movement they are too close in order to catch the movement but if there are placed at the proper distance then when something comes out they're able to move right with it and able to flow right with it god has set it up that you and i would not be on top of the word this is why sometimes when the word is coming forth and you look at the word you say my it's so far out there brother samuel it seems like it's right out here god has intended it he's not taken the word away from you he's trying to show you so that the word is in clear vision so that you can step and you're following the word because it is the symphony that is following the beats on earth that is being orchestrated so that we can move and begin to prepare and we can pray about those things that god is making known this is why that the word itself when it's coming that's why paul could say i seek to apprehend that which i'm apprehended of paul here is the first church age messenger he said i do not count myself to be perfect in other words i've obtained everything but he said i seek after so he's paul's following closely as the word is moving for you have not passed this way before and joshua said unto the people sanctify yourselves for tomorrow the lord will do wonders among you and he spake to the priest and he said take up the ark of the covenant and passover before the people and they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people and the lord said unto joshua this day will i begin to magnify thee in the sight of all israel that they may know that as i was with moses so i will be with thee and thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant saying when you are come to the brink of the water of jordan ye shall stand still in jordan you know brother branham would would take this and we kind of spoke on this a little bit on one of the sunday services you know brother brown would talk about how that there were men in the camp that he said no doubt had been engineers in egypt and they were looking at this statement prepare to go across jordan here it's time and his engineers they could be in their mind it would be a natural thing to try to look at things how they had you know uh worked on all of those things of egypt and you know to erect something there in egypt and uh on those pyramids and how to do this and again tapped into all those laws of physics and things that were there but you know as they stood there it was not god was not going to use their engineering minds or their intellect this was a moment that we were standing before it didn't make sense to cross right now there's sometimes in things that you and i know there's things we're brought face to face with it doesn't make sense we don't know how we're going to get crossed we don't know how we're going to get through the mountain's too high valley's too low there's a river there we don't know how we're going to get through it but here's the secret the bible said lean not to your own understanding but trust in the lord with all thine heart that's what faith is it's trust i think brother jury referred to that statement brother brown had made in their message where the person said you know i was trusting god till the reigns broke on the horses until they broke like brother branham reiterated well that's the very time when they broke you needed to trust you see trust is when you don't have anything to grab a hold of whether it's with see taste feel smell here reason conscience memory you have nothing with one of those gates to grab a hold of and that's where trust it comes in in our life experiences experiences builds it builds faith it builds patience it builds this in our life this was a building moment in their life many of them that are standing right here in this moment in joshua 3 some of them have been young people walking through the red sea are you with me some of them had been there some of them had had been and had you know they were young they had seen you know coming out of egypt but there had to be a fresh experience for their lives there had to be a witness of god's power for their lives oh my think of this brother brown would say it like this he says watch what joshua did what did he put first the clergy no sir he put the word first and he said take that ark and all you preach stay away from it get behind it don't try to lead it let it lead you and he said that's the trouble today we try to get ahead of the word and bypass and make the word to fit this and the word to fit that bless your hearts what we need today is follow the word every one of us have no doubt put together a puzzle at some time and we have tried to put pieces together in the puzzle that we thought sure as the world they belong here right and we could spend minutes looking at those pieces i like the puzzles that got big pieces like this it's i don't like them little ones but we can sit there and look at you're what are you looking at we're looking at characteristics that are there and we're trying to put it together and you know when we were younger some of the puzzles that i ruined as i was just a little boy is because i tried to put pieces together that didn't belong together you say how did you do that well i had to try to use strength my own strength and it's taken a lot of work and ended up bending pieces bending back the picture it didn't look so nice but you see that's sometimes the way that we can get into things we can get in to try to make things fit let me tell you something we don't have to make god's word fit our life we don't have to make god's word fit any situation we don't listen god is not entrusted to me nor anybody to vindicate his word he's the one who vindicates it is that right he don't need me to get on facebook and prop up this and prop up that he doesn't need me to do that let me tell you something what's a clear sign when you've got real peace here in the will of god you don't need to vindicate anything come on friends [Applause] joshua look when he steps out and tells the people we're going over in three days where did god say three days i can't preach on that a lot right now where did god say that but you see he's so in contact with god till his ways have become god-like he knows there's power in three days justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost our lord raised up on the third day oh there's power there's an outer court an inner coat and the holiest of holies there is power in three days we're going over he's i won with the characteristics of god oh god's mind is speaking through his life so our duty is to follow the word not try to make it fit and you know it's like brother brandon would say remember he talked about i think it was one of his relatives they had that prayer book and they were praying and things didn't work out they threw the prayer book in the fire brother bradman says well he says what was wrong is you were trying to change god's mind he said god's mind don't need no changing it's our mind that needs changed right it doesn't say our father which are in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done what i want done let it be that that's what heaven wants done no but whatever from heaven let it be reflected in earth what prayer is is god i'm setting myself aside that heaven might be made manifest in earth hallelujah it's a powerful thing and it's not things that we have as soon as listen friends this is where it comes down to putting your lunchbox when you feel like you've got a pound and put stuff together right there just step away from it say wait a minute god you never called me to make things fit you called me to follow you called me to follow now listen sometimes we want to take things we want to try to make our loved ones fit we want to try to make things fit and do this and do that and do this what happens it drives them away i believe a standard of the word i believe we hold a standard in our homes it's a standard there's no option there's no excuse there's no budging on it this is the standard of this home is that all right never has been an option in this house right here of uh of coming to the house of god when our boys they started working when ben's started working i told him right up i said if you need me to go in there and talk to their managers i'll go right in there and talk to them but thursday nights and sundays we're to be in the house of god but samuel they may not have hired him i know a god who's bigger i know a god who's greater i don't preach a puny god i don't preach a god who can't move i'm a witness myself working in those kind of situations tell me god won't make a way where there's a desire to be in the house of god god will make a way oh my oh my wow i tell you a lot of free things coming out but notice our duty we don't need to try to put things together the word led the way so notice brother ben said the word led the way when it got to the jordan she opened up and they went right over why did the jordan open because they put the word first see joshua had a responsibility in his life be strong and courageous lord sometimes there's some hard things that you're asking me only be strong and courageous joshua this gospel is not for the faint of heart this gospel it requires strength and courage to be able to look into that word and to line up with that word and say be it unto me lord notice his first campaign he put first things first he had a reason for that because god had commissioned him stay with the word and let the word do it every campaign they went forth in the battle because god had charged him to put the word first and after the ark went forth what went forth then singing players of instrument before the fight took place but graham said that's what we need today is we needed singers you said what we had this morning we had singers instruments playing music rejoicing i mean no singing gives courage abraham tells us in 1965 believe the message leadership he said singing gives courage to the believers entering in to take the promises is that right oh my tell you what a wonderful just i tell you what a wonderful presence just was coming right back through there when i was sitting back there in the office just hearing you as a children of god rejoicing and knowing no doubt your rejoicing is pressing beyond discouragements and trials and tests and disappointments but you're pressing beyond it because you know that those things that are there they're lying vanities it's not they're not real and they're feeling but they're only barriers it's trying to keep me from entering into god's presence brother brandon when he preaches the message greatest value of her fart look at some of the words he used in there chop and he uses multiple words on how you come and approach the enemy you chop at him and you know it goes on and on again just so many different words to express how did we come and we fight against the enemy sometimes it's not just one swing it's chopping at it chopping out of chopping at it chopping at it chopping at it chopping at it is that right well i must not be that strong in faith because i've had the chop don't you believe that lie that ain't true whatsoever you're chopping at it shows as a son or daughter of god that this is god's promise and if i've got to take you little by little i'm going to take you down because this is my promise [Music] hallelujah that's what brother ramsey said when we speak to that mountain you may not see it but one grain of sand has turned loose but that grain of sand that's turned loose is a testimony the rest of the mountain is on its way notice then put the word first read the word then the battle sets in and we're bound to win we just got to win stay right with it keep its direction and it'll keep you in the hour of trouble let me just let me let me finish out here in joshua 3. joshua said to the children of israel in verse 9 come hither and hear the words of the lord your god hereby you shall know that the living god is among you and that he will without fail drive out from before you the canaanites the hittites the hivites parasites gergescites amorites and jebusites behold the ark of the covenant of the lord of all the earth passeth over before you into jordan the word is going before you into the jordan aren't you glad the word became flesh aren't you glad that the word became flesh and the word paid the price for you and i the word is leading the way this is a word campaign now therefore take you out twelve men out of the tribes of israel out of every tribe of man and it shall come to pass as soon as the souls of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the lord the lord of all the earth shall rest in the waters of jordan that the waters of jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above and they shall stand upon a heat what a promise take the word and let the word go to leading take the word you say how do i place the word first take the word into your heart take the word take a hold of the promise of god's word listen that jordan was not opening because of their feet the feet was what was on earth come on now i'm just not trying to run away and run over in revelation but that faith was on earth but the but the waters had to obey the lord the ark of the covenant of the lord of all the earth it was representative that almighty god was present right there they can look at that and say well that ain't nothing but a little box of of wood that's covered over with gold but it was a place that god said i'll meet you i'll commune with you right there i'll express my secrets to you let me tell you something after they got in this land one time the philistines got a hold of this ark there was a man by the name of eli right he wasn't doing right one tended to his home hello now and the ark of the lord got taken captive but there wasn't one god down there in the philistine house that could stand out to the presence of almighty god think about it then big old gods plastered up on the wall which were no gods and here was god represented notice in a type yes in a type of when god would come fully into his place of rest in the heart of man showing that when god would get his place there's not a devil big enough or bad enough that can stand before the living god it's not your flesh or my flesh it's god on the inside satan has to recognize that word that's there on the inside that's why when we go before the throne of god we're not going as poppers we're not going demanding we're going with boldness i'm not coming into a place that i'm not invited and doesn't belong to me i mean you might tell me brother samuel go in my refrigerator help yourself it's still your refrigerator all right it's still your refrigerator but when it's something that belongs to me i'm not worried about because it belongs to me i'm not worried about will i drink too much milk will i eat too much cheese will i have too many pickles i'm not worried about that because it belongs to me that's why it must be a personal experience and we dwell in that reality that i'm not a pauper i'm not a servant i'm a son and daughter of god hallelujah when you've got a need or i've got a need you might say brother saying i don't feel like much of a christian it ain't based on what you feel like it's based on who you are the waters don't move based upon what you feel like the waters move because the god of all heaven and earth is dwelling inside of you oh we might as well preach why we're here oh the devil wants to make you think you're some trodden down something you're not a trodden down something you're a son and daughter of the living god hallelujah you've got authority as a son of god authority as a daughter of god [Applause] are you hearing me they hadn't even crossed the jordan yet i hope somebody's hearing me they hadn't even crossed the jordan yet but when they took the word not their ideas but the word i don't have time to read it tonight but out of isaiah 55 let let the sinner in the ungodly forsake his way forsake his thoughts for my thoughts god said are higher than your thoughts he talked about how his telephones they descend down and what they do in his thoughts as they descend down let's just read it here i i sometimes i don't like to just comb over things here let's just read it here just for a moment you may have to pull it up because i don't i have this rolled out but notice as the rain come at verse 10 is the rain coming down and the snow from heaven and returning not through there but the water but watereth the earth and maketh it bring forth and bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater what does this god's thoughts coming down are you hearing me now this is why wrapping yourself up in the word of god let me just say this for anybody even listening anybody here tonight don't wait till well brother samuel when i get a real experience you can't get a real experience outside of the word you've got to take the word first they asked peter on the day of pentecost what must we do he said repent and be baptized and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost what was that that was the guide of the word himself behind that fisherman's life that was guiding them into eternal life they wanted to know what do we need to do and now that prescription is revealed by the guide himself so think of it taking letting the word come down and soak into our lives i'll tell you this right here there's nobody in here or on the internet that'll hear this message that can say that after you just allowed that to happen just letting the thoughts of god just letting the message just letting the word of god just soak into your life that i have a bad day no it might be troubles come your way but you've got strength see what's what's soaking into our life look at it bread bread don't come up like that unless it's in a hot house or manufacture it right you got to plant the seed it's got to be the rain that comes down right it's got a nourish release that seed the germ that's in there it's got to grow through all the stages but then it becomes bread right but how does all that come it's the thoughts of god coming down oh glory be to god so shall my word be that goethe forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing where unto i sent it my goodness we could preach all over the bible with that but i say god let us be so wrapped up with the word of god with your thoughts let me just get wrapped up let them let them saturate like they they talk about how the the snow you know we we see when they come to doing winter wheat well winter wheat depends on snow when we live down there in the country i don't know i guess they must do it around here too but it depends on the blanket of snow keeping that seed a little warm and then it just sat that melts and goes right in the ground so then they're able to harvest that what is at the end of spring and beginning of summer they're able to bring that wheat in it's called winter wheat think of this here's a living god making himself known god was letting his people know i'm closing here i know you think i believe it when i see it but yeah i'm closing this one this right here god was doing this for his people bringing them see how everything is so orchestrated like brother jerry was preaching last thursday night the plan and purpose of god how do you try to who can bring all these things together who man you can't god's proving his faithfulness his might and at the same time in this situation he's also letting them know when you get before giants you get before obstacles think back to this the same god that was a waymaker here be the same god to be a waymaker when it comes to your need what was god saying i'm your waymaker i'm the one who makes the way i make a way from my word to be fulfilled all you got to do is put my word first and i will come and perform it notice what it experienced that would be because god was letting them know there's going to be battles you're going to be engaged in that you're going to have to stand still you're letting them know brother aaron they're going to be battles that you're going to have to walk clear up to it the souls of the feet touch the brim of the water but the braham said it i've quoted it a number of times brother braham said they walked about 20 feet in the water and all of a sudden the whole point being this they had to take the word and the situation had to obey the word because the word was being obeyed from the heart it's power in obedience that's why when saul was coming back and samuel met him and said obedience is better than sacrifice sometimes we're going to have to stand still this right here represented there's going to be times where you're going to have to just pray and trust me and stand still and that the way will open up after you're standing in obedience to my will think of it my goodness think of this word after somebody look at your neighbor and say after after paul wrote it like this for ye have need of patience that after you have done the will of god you might receive the promise when after after you've done god's will be patient the promise is on its way first peter 5 10 but the god of all grace who called us unto his glory by christ jesus after that you have suffered a while make you perfect establish strength and settle you when after noah would never have seen any rainbow until after the flood but the jury got the preaching on the hebrews children last week powerful statement came flowing from the holy ghost on that one brother brown makes it right here but it was just a powerful statement that at their trial they didn't see this coming but it wasn't until after they were in the fiery furnace that the son of god made himself known think about it what was the greatest trial the greatest test in their life brought the greatest experience i got to repeat it as it was said last week because it was just good good good their purpose in the fire was to reveal the fourth man [Applause] whew that's one of them i just take put in the pocket putting the script back but we can preach the ministry of the son of man on that one oh my the purpose and the hour we're living in in the midst of everything that's going on is to reveal the son of man the testing trials have not come to overwhelm you listen even your failures are not there and do not dictate who you are i can't get into that but what dictates who you are is the word of god is the holy ghost in your life mistakes don't define you the word identifies you let's stand [Applause] after after they put the word and they took the word first and it was after daniel it was after he was in the lion's den after that god showed up the friends of god moving down bringing strength bringing deliverance sometimes our standing standing still we've consulted the lord lord what do i do we put the word first remember it's always listen friends though you don't ever want to get it we don't want to be in a hurry and i know some of that comes out because i'm a pastor and i know that characteristics as an ox of the team i'm just four feet on the ground and ox is ox not very fast he's slow but that's also admonition to our life because our life is not growth like this come on now god brings evangelist into the church our faith will soar in the promise of god and there's continual growth but growth does not come like that growth comes little by little by little and it's all god god planting god watering god given the ingredients all god but within this we want to put the word first sometimes you know it's easy sometimes we can say um well i you know i'm putting the word first but we want in everything we want to evaluate and say god is that really what's first situation before you decisions because remember god made a promise here in his word nothing shall stand before you not a man all this land every place that your foot has trout i've given you but that didn't mean that joshua could become relaxed his authority was by the word his victory was from the word that's why those very important instructions in verse 7 and verse 8 be strong and courageous don't turn from the left don't turn to the right there's a lot of things that can try to pull you off here pull you off there and remember one of the greatest things there's things many times that can pull at our heartstrings reasoning and other things and this is where we need the discernment of the word we want to be sensitive with god because we're moving god just doesn't god just doesn't stay in one spot he's moving and we want to be sensitive to say lord i want to catch when you're moving when as the word begins to move i want to be able to start making that step with the word because the word maybe right up there there's an obstacle and god sees it as the watchman he makes this direction right here i want to be moving right in line with the word so every time the word moves just say god help me to be sensitive just to move right with the word [Music] because within that then then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and of a good success oh man let's pray father lord very simple words of instruction that you would speak to our hearts tonight but lord how they are lord really god words that we find ourselves applying and needing to apply over and over in our lives [Music] lord i find in our lives oh god like you would remind joshua that our victory our authority it comes by the word of god lord for each need that's here tonight no matter what that need is may the heart and the life just take that word and just take the word and know that the word will open the way let it lord be so saturated into our hearts let it oh god to where the characteristics of our lives are your characteristics on display lord you know the needs of your children you know lord things upon our hearts and you're mindful oh god lord even in the midst of like what you were proving here with joshua and to the children of israel that there are going to be times that god where they will pray like the hebrew children like daniel they had to go through it but father as they were praying and looking and trusting in you god you made a way lord jesus help us in everything lord to put the word first help us father may it be so wrapped in our lives not something that's on the outside but may our lives be so wrapped up lord that word dwelling in our heart o god granted father is my prayer bless your children bless your people in jesus precious amen and amen [Music] of victories [Music] oh just remember where you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary says give me yes lord just [Music] that the cross would not get heavy and but it would not be [Music] just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision that the adversary says given just hold on [Music] so many times a question with certain circumstances or things i could not understand well so many times and trials my weakness blurs my vision and that's when my frustration gets so out of hand oh yes oh but it's then i am reminded oh i've never been forsaken oh i never had to stand one test alone that's when i look back at all the victories the spirit of god rises up in me and it's through the fire that my weakness is made strong oh he never promised that the cross would not get heavy and the kill would not be hard to climb oh [Music] remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary says just give in oh but just hold on little pride our lord will show up yes and he will take you through the fire again oh and i know within myself that i would surely perish oh but if i trust the hand of god oh he'll shield the flames again yes he will again and i know that he never promised that your cross would not get heavy and the [Music] but he [Music] oh so just remember when you're standing or when the valley of decision and the adversary says given oh just hold on oh our lord will show up yes he will take you through the fire again so just hold on cause our door will show up yes and he will take you through the fire again hallelujah amen praise the lord amen he's an on-time god he's an
