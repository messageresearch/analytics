heavenly father lord what a privilege it is that we can come into your presence lord to know that indeed you are our father we are your offspring lord jesus oh god how the lord that you have made that's so real and more real to our hearts father we would just ask lord here this evening as lord this time lord has set aside your god i think of how that adam and eve lord they would long for that time of the evening when you would come down lord and speak with him lord it's a desire lord in our heart that you would just come and speak to us lord i know sometimes we have different needs we have we have questions we have things lord that is just so out in the forefront in our mind and what sometimes it's not that we're even wanting that to be in the forefront of our mind but it's just upon our heart but god we just want to take lord all of those things the greatest honor as peter would write to us by the admonition of the holy spirit casting all of our cares lord that word cares is all of our anxiousness all of these things cast them upon you lord for you care for us lord you're in control you're the one who's overseeing you're the one who's directing oh god lord we've committed our ways unto you lord i pray that god that you'll just lord move in a very special way now speak to our hearts there's not a there's not a question lord there's not a doubt that dear god for whatever the need is that you can't move for it we believe that dear god lord we don't want to be so focused on one thing that we would overlook dear god your desire to deal with our hearts and our lives lord sometimes the very things that will unlock healing unlock lord the blessing of god so we want to be sensitive lord because we believe dear god that you you have the words of eternal life you know what's best for us you work all things after the counsel of your own will and we believe that oh god we just ask the lord you'll just take control of speaker and hearer together tonight may you be exalted oh god and glorified here in our midst lord speak to every heart and every need lord behind every hand we pray dear god we just want to remember tonight lord as brother mark lord would head into surgery tomorrow lord the procedure there for those kidney stones i pray that god that you will just undertake for our brother in a very special way lord i pray that you'll just guide the doctors lord i pray that lord that you'll just move lord upon his body lord we just ask oh god for a complete healing lord and a deliverance lord in his body we pray in the name of jesus christ the glory of god amen amen amen you love the lord amen it sure is good to be in the house of the lord tonight we just want to invite you to the word of the lord in first corinthians chapter 13 and i want to go back over there and just try to resume here in the word in first corinthians 13 verse 4 it says charity suffereth long and is kind charity envy not charity wanteth not itself and is not puffed up i'd like to just once again just speaking to you on that thought of discerning the love of god i just want to read this quote to you before we let you be seated brother branham he says it like this in the message love he says if you'll learn to love and to be kind to everybody and to be gentle and have patience it'll even make your home life different it'll make your associations different god will honor you and i like these last words now i've tried it brother brown goes into you know many of the different examples and this is we have a fountain as we've looked at here and been looking at when we have been born of the spirit of god we have we have a fountain that we are tapped into the things of the world have passed away there is no desire rooted in that new nature to be envious to have malice to hold a grudge it can't be in that ground but we know that even after we've been changed there's still a part two parts that haven't been changed and this is why we need the god part on the inside we need a son and daughter of god ruling and reigning from the inside one who's there to say this cannot dwell here though we can sense it and we can feel it these things can come but we do not as paul would write give no place to the devil this is our desire and we in ourselves we we can't do this without his help we we're made as god would liken us as sheep we're made to rest we're made to rely upon him because sometimes how things can happen so subtly we might feel like we've got a reason or we've got a ground or we've got a right or we've got but all those things right there when we really are in fellowship with god god many times he can come right down and when we're open in that way to say lord search me search me not just well lord you know i've been serving you for this long or lord i'm a prophet or i'm a pastor i'm a this but if we just can as a sheep say lord search me and we have that that that humbleness of heart to know that we need his help we need his discernment we need his leadership in our life and we have that kind of a that's a welcoming spirit you realize that's the very thing that welcomes him back to take us into rapture it's a welcoming spirit how could we have that how could that be if not for him providing for us and we want to stay in that i believe even as the world gets darker and darker and more evil but i believe that in the presence of the great i am there is a people of god who is becoming more tender and more sensitive to his will amen do you love him god bless you as you're being seated i think as we read that quote we it's not one of us that would not desire that god would honor us but the honor that we're looking for is not that we would be accounted to be greater than anyone else but it's just the favor of god to be able to have his presence abiding in our life to be able to have fellowship with god to be at a place to where that god is so mindful and merciful to take control even in situations that arise in our life and we're sitting there and we don't know what either to answer or do not even know what to do but we know the scripture is true that they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength and we know that there is a there is a great great promise in waiting upon the lord many places in the scripture as it was would admonish us within that and we look at these the preciousness of it of how then in situations i think when brother branham speaks to us regarding many of these situations whether it's the bees the the bull and i i don't know how many times i just keep listening over and over and over and over but the thing that i always marvel about is that you know within it all it was it was many things that came to brother branham and you you read through different parts of the message and you'll find where there were different thoughts that actually tried to come to him but brother branham even thoughts were when that bull came and that man came that maniac there in oregon brother branham when you hear him tell it is some places he's able to recall some of those parts and you might say why would that be because somebody had need of it right there and because we needed to see that part of it as well to where that brother brown would say that the first thing that would come at him would be fear and but yet brother branham would say in each of those instances he said but yet he said i i said i chose to think different thoughts and he said i made up my mind i am not going to die a coward and i think that is i think that's um there's there's such counsel that we can take from that and how that god in the midst of that time there was such a an uh uh uh a relationship and a fellowship that we can we recognize that even as the prophet had with god but that's the same thing that you and i have the privilege to have with god as well it's where it's a continual openness to god there's a you know the bible will speak about prayer and i'm just i'm just going to follow him now when god speaks a prayer you know prayer is not to be made a thing of tradition that i got to get down on my knees you can be down on your knees and yet your heart not even be there at all you see it's it's this is where paul would say pray without ceasing paul would say you know a praise standing it's not the position of your body it's the condition of your heart is our heart really prostrate before god because you can pray right there you know and it's not saying that we you that we should not have time in prayer you should have time in prayer with god but it's not just something that we check in and check out but you know it's a spirit of prayer and you know let me just say this to you if something happens and you seemingly like don't have that time of prayer that you normally would like to have that day don't stop get in your car and keep on in the spirit of prayer remember you're a priest of god you've got within you that of of a portion of the great creator himself and as a son and daughter of god you have the ability by his spirit to create an atmosphere as you say so what should i do well sometimes when it's even in a tight atmosphere and you feel tight or you feel like things that's hard to press through what do i do brother braham says start out your prayer with praise if we just turn it out you might say well i got all these requests well maybe that day you just need to he knows what's in your heart anyhow and there might be a lot of requests and then there's other days where you think i wanted to just praise him but you had a lot of requests on your heart and the spirit of god was moving on your heart to bring this one before the throne and bring this one with before the throne you see we're just priests that want to be moved by the spirit of god and we can stay in that place then then it's then there's then there's a real i believe this is a real effectual witness that we can all we can testify of that god will honor us god sovereign god comes on the scene in the situations that deal with in our home life and associations and and all these things that we have so when we when we look here a little bit more here this evening and i want to just take another part in that scripture and dealing with where charity envy is not now out of the amplified bible it'll just save me from defining words but it says it like this love never is envious nor boils over with jealousy and we recognize that that that even when we have been born of the love of god that's the agape that's the love of god and that should be the love the love within our life that that should influence all the other love because you still you never separate from a feeling of love you still have feeling of love that is still a part of the things in in associates and brother brown would tell us you still have feeling of love for your wife but even in having that feeling of love for your wife remember brother tells us he said that also love there's jealousy that can accompany that love as well but you see it's not telling us do away with that let me just pause here for a moment you realize the scripture tells us that one of the signs of peerless times is men would be without natural affection things listen natural affection things that should be natural things that should just be hey this should not it should not have to be anything that should have to be instructed but you see if there's a condition and the reason that condition is now that was paul when paul spoke of that paul spoke of a seed that would be planted but then that seed would come to fruition and it would be in fruition in peerless times the reason the reason that that seed could even move throughout the earth and be where it's at now is because of the rejection of jesus christ it's not all together that people reject the bible but they reject the god of the bible and when you reject the god of the bible you reject him who is the word he is the one who makes the word to live and so we find the result we see this even in the earth today and the way things are that the way that they are we see this this this but yet within that of agape love we'll find where paul would deal even in ephesians five and you're perhaps from i know familiar with that we've preached from that many times here and you've you've heard it in the message and on and reading it and things but how paul would speak of even that that relationship between husband and wife is to be under the direction of agape love and this is what we want all we want all of our associations we want everything of our life god i want it to be under the influence of the love of god in other words lord i need your discernment i need your wisdom i need your leadership in these things lord god that my life would be completely under the influence of agape love because listen sometimes feeling love itself can kind of get log jammed you know there's compassion but you see even compassion has to be ruled over by a godly love yet we need compassion don't we the bible would write for us to be compassionate but yet remember jesus himself a man full of compassion but yet he walked right down through the multitude stepped over this one stepped over this is a pardon me excuse me and he went and he healed one man that was there at the pool of bethesda what was that that was not human compassion that was the compassion of god human compassion would have said i want to help everybody and let me just tell you that that was a real desire that was there but you see what jesus was reserved to it this was something to teach us that it's ought to be that in all things we're to be reserved to the love of god and i believe this with all my heart even within our lives we can say well i have an attribute to be a husband i have an attribute to be a you know a wife or a father or a mother but we want the leadership of the holy spirit that god would so direct us because sometimes in our lives we can get through reasoning because filial love will go along with that to where we can actually forsake what is really the best and the right way that's why we need the help of god so envy itself i want to just deal with this here tonight and we'll see where we get if we can finish this part up but you know envy we started looking at this and closing out last week but envy itself is a it's a it's an inward condition that's got to be dealt with envy itself even when things as i we referred to as god brought to my attention give no place to the devil and paul would say in another place uh casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against uh against against the obedience of christ to the pulling down of strongholds strongholds and that same word out of ephesians plays it deals with retreats it deals with it's the same word as a castle it's where a fort same word is fortress in other words where something becomes a basis or an excuse and there's a lot of things that you and i can have excuses or as brother brandon would put it that's your rights yeah you've got a right to feel this way you've got a right to feel that way and all of those things having rights but yet if you if as a lamb a lamb forsakes and forfeits his own rights this is where it takes the grace of almighty god in our life you see envy itself is a is something as it can come so so subtly it's linked there with with jealousy you find that even in heaven as we looked at it that in heaven satan was filled with envy right she became he wanted to he look look where he wanted a kingdom that was better than michael's but why couldn't he just say look i want you to catch this satan himself is referred in the book of ezekiel as the anointed cherubim that covert he was god's right-hand man at one time and what more could you ask for what more could you and i ask for than to have fellowship with god no matter who we are it doesn't matter rank status what it does that doesn't matter at all what matters is is to have fellowship with god and to be in the favor of god but that wasn't enough he saw this with michael and he was moved with envy and because of that envy then he started to preach another gospel he started to sow a division then to where that the church that was all together as one there in heaven there became a division all because of a t-a-l-e a tale is that right it began to tell that went out and began to separate the angels i want you to catch this here the angels which every one of them only knew what it was like to be in the presence of god all they knew was holy holy holy lord god almighty that's all they knew amen they were not out here in a factory coming in you know to church and then going out among the workplace no no that's all they knew was in that atmosphere but a tale came among them and that tale coming among them it brought a separation but where did the separation begin it first began in their heart with a decision to even listen to it and here satan knows he studies he knows how to try to take even a person and try to you know put and say well look what this person has god trusted you more maybe you would have that come on some of you know where i'm going brother branham walks through oral roberts facility walks through billy graham's facility what did he say he said i'd be ashamed for them to come to my little trainer here's what he said god perhaps you couldn't trust me with something like this i want you to catch this the spirit of god spoke to the prophet's heart and said look up i'm your portion [Applause] to me thank god i appreciate that being included in the message because you know why it shows that even though that gift that lay there here was a son of god that had been born of the spirit of god the prophet of god to this age but he never tried to act or put on he never tried to cover any of his mistakes i'm gonna tell you if i can say it this clear i i don't know of anybody else who was as transparent as the prophet of god very transparent in many of these things but notice how god moved and it's not one thing it shows that sometimes there are things that even to this that you and i could think well why maybe this or god maybe you couldn't trust me or or this but oh my if we can stay in that channel then the god this is god honoring us god coming down and saying but i'm your push hallelujah you see then satan this jealousy this envy it comes down and satan is finding somebody he's looking he sees what's going on he sees how god has brewed over this earth he sees how that the spirit of god has has brewed and brought forth this earth when it was not even stardust or molecule he sees think of this the tenderness of almighty god he sees god's affection to his own word what god spoke now his word is becoming material and how that out of all the other planets and all the other while it was belching with them with gases and volcanics it's recorded in the book of ezekiel that satan walked up and down the coals of fire what was he doing he was laying claimed satan while he was walking he was wanting to lay claim upon this earth but he's too late it's too late because it was already in god's mind hallelujah just like he wanted to walk or maybe walk in your life but he's too late god's already laid a claim and it's not a claim that's been laid in this moment it was acclaimed clear back before the foundation of the world and that god who laid the claim there is the same god that comes down to make good on that claim how can i get in here right he sees this of this family what you think of this here for a moment he sees this family sees here a husband and wife just their love for one another remember brother randall would just dramatize it there for us how there was such a love they would take one another by the hand and come on honey let's go up to the cathedral right there and gathering among the trees papa's getting ready to come down he saw such a love and such a joy that was among them and brother brandon speaks there was a perfect perfect understanding of the love of god there was not an atmosphere these atmospheres that you and i have to deal with that's all now because of sin because of the fall they weren't dealing with that atmosphere but in the midst of that satan was looking with envy and how can i break this up right you see envy envy it hates happiness and hates joy so satan here he comes comes into the serpent we know he takes that place and he projects a gospel but the gospel he projects is a gospel of envy do you realize paul's writes under inspiration in the book of philippians chapter 1 he said there are some even right now that are preaching the gospel out of contention and envy you know what that was all about well surely there ought to be a right there has to should be a right motive but you had men going about here is paul paul's preaching what's right but notice remember what paul would write in the book of timothy here i am preaching this jesus christ the son of david is raised from the grave and here are the miracles here the witness of the holy spirit but yet it's because of that he was persecuted and those were preaching with envy and is though trying to present themselves of we're preaching truth nothing's happening to us but just because of the blessings the blessings do not mean the clear skies and all the oh this is where we're in the favor of god see that's been the whole thing down through the ages this is where it's like where brother bram says no wonder the church would say where the church and this and that he said when they're protected by the government and then anybody else that doesn't go along with them they just strike them out cut them off cancel them and everything else he says no marvel right it's the same spirit what started in heaven it's the same spirit that works throughout it works there to envy wow let me just try to move we find cain here it comes in cane doesn't come in able but it comes in cane and cane is roth remember where he's wroth god looks to the depth of cain outside cain might have looked fine but god asked him why is your count and it's falling that's your inward person [Music] because he witnessed god he came labored he labored did what he did but then god came down and vindicated abel sacrifice but it was not able's righteousness it was god's righteousness that had been revealed now that righteousness of god had been brought to light and cain it caused jealousy to rise up in his life that didn't come from adam that didn't come from adam so then you find here as we move just a little bit here comes the lord jesus here he is among come to his own in his own received him not here in matthew 27 17 it says therefore when they were gathered together pilate said unto them think of this pilate inherit they hated one another i hate the bible said they hated one another but notice they united against the word made flesh is that right it was prophesied clear back even in the book of psalms notice they gathered together pilate said unto them whom will ye that i release unto you barabbas or jesus which is called christ for he knew look at this for he knew pilate wasn't a believer he knew that for envy they had delivered him pilate wasn't a believer but you see even there's things even among the world the world can see things to a place and say hey what's the motive behind this you understand if this these are things that can be somewhat that can be seen by people that say what's the motive behind all this pilate knew for envy he could see it the bible goes on in the book of mark and records it in that way the chief priest got among the people and began the bible says to move the people to ask for barabbas begin to go and stir this up because because to think of it they would ask for a murderer instead of the lord jesus christ they would ask they would ask for one who was a seditionist and everything else these are scriptural terms but they would ask for him they would call for him rather than take that of the lord jesus what caused them to do that let me tell you something they didn't even know what they were doing this is where it gets to a place to where even the testimony when nicodemus came to the lord jesus he said we know thou art a man come from god for no man can do such miracles but because it wasn't in their church because it wasn't god using them it didn't come their way god specializes in that god don't like coming our way of thinking that's where it really gets tested because we can have our thoughts but don't make your thoughts god don't get in such a way it's got to come this way it's got to happen because remember sometimes the very answer to things it comes in a way you're not even expecting the way the answer will come but god always answers brother braham said because we're praying a certain way and god answers but because he don't answer the way we're praying he said then we'll say he didn't answer but he did answer i just want to be sensitive to hear the answer is that right i don't want to have a cancelled spirit on me that cancels out when he says no i i want to have a i want to have a that of the spirit of god predominated they would say yes lord lord what's your will well son i want you to go through this god give me strength don't hold my hand lord don't turn me loose give me strength day by day lord i need you lord dear god i can't face this without you but lord you said you never leave me no forsake you lord god if you go with me lord amen acts 7 9 stephen picks this up and the patriarchs this is joseph's brother moved with envy and they sold joseph into egypt but i like this part we could really preach here but god was with him i like that i like that a whole lot now god makes every one of us different is that right and i'm not talking about whether we're short round or skinny or this but even in our makeups we're different but even how god has gifted us we're different every even among the five full ministry every gift is different a pastor is a pastor but every pastor is not the same amen and evangelists and on and on those it's not the same now i want you to think of this god paul would write about this who maketh us to differ one from another who is it that is so gifted in this way or in this direction you realize why they ended up down in egypt they ended up in egypt israel ends up in egypt because of jealousy among brethren it led them into bondage you see this is why when we when you can recognize how god is moving it's something about that it should thrill our hearts it doesn't matter how old the person is it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what color it doesn't matter none of that what matters is god is moving in our midst god is speaking to our hearts and we want to be open and be sensitive to god you know as i spoke to some young people even across uh in uh in philippines and i took just a i took just some teaching in one of the morning services and dealt with things of how that god he wants how that we in the parts of our life there's parts in our life of schooling and there's parts where god works in our life he packs talents and skills in our life that he has to unpack but we want him unpacked under his leadership you know what i'm referring to i'm referring to the tabernacle in the wilderness god unpacked that those skills god made unknown in the vision but you see even within all that as i was expressing to them i said you could sit here and you might have a bachelor's degree a master's degree and your pastor standing in the pulpit he may not even have a high school or secondary school diploma but remember there's times you'll need to use your natural your that that schooling that was given but don't you ever try to use that natural schooling that natural wisdom to filter the word because remember the word it was before stardust and or molecule this is the wisdom of god and this is where humility comes into where a person can set maybe with a doctor's degree and the highest of education but yet they're able to humble themselves under the mighty hand of god and hear god's voice and take his leadership they're not resting on their scholarship or their reasonings or i understand this or i can do this or i can put this together but they're waiting on just saith the lord and they're saying god even with everything it's not my abilities that's got this this is you lord that's given me this ability i want this ability like solomon said lord thou knowest my coming in and my going out god i want you to order fully my life envy now if we looked at this in a natural way huh some things that jacob did also stirred up some jealousy you go to giving one one of your kids a special coat come on i know the spiritual type here but you understand there's also many parts to this in teaching and laying it out i'm on a quote a quote that my brother really loves brother jerry loves this quote and that is if god gives one of his children ice cream he gives them all ice cream you see god has a way if i'm my memory recall it serves me correctly about this that even how you take suzanne wesley who had so many kids but yet she was able to spend time quality time with each one of them to wear that when everything was said and done and after it all they all could think i'm mama's pet she made me feel special but then when the next one came along oh mama has the same love for him or her too it's things that we learn that you know among even among even our children they're all different even as we're all different they respond to things differently sometimes they even they think differently they have different likes sometimes they have lights and things or and i'm talking about things that they enjoy to do i'm not talking about sin but things that they might enjoy that you may not be good at at all you may not even like it all but you'll condescend why because of that child you take time you take time with them you learn you learn and you study how how can i be a friend or as brother branham would take the term buddy i understand we gotta balance that term buddy out because there's times where you gotta you gotta be their buddy but you also gotta gotta be the high tanner too that that never standards and and and things never ever leave no matter how old they are and when you're in your home there's standards it's there this is the standard in this house the token put this standard in this is the standard no bending no budging this is where it stands are you with me see that also brings security in our life i don't know how in the world we got on this that brings security in their life you know i always think my brother homer said brother homer you know he's something else he said i'm so glad he's feeling better he said you know he said i know my mama loved me he said she always stayed in contact with me he talked about every day he said she just went and gave me a whooping to start today you know brother homer you know that's got to be the truth but these patriarchs joseph's brother you see god god made the difference and i'll say it like this even when it comes into our homes and the way things are you know it's even of things to wear yeah we have to be careful with things that we don't even you talk things up to where you get people you get your wife trying to be like this sister or your husband trying to be like this this guy listen god don't want us pattern ourselves after one another i'm not interested in this church being like any other church i'm not trying to make it different and god just knows what he's doing i know so-and-so does this that's fine and good for them but i'm not them and they're not me i have to be who god has called me to be and god made just like he made you god has made us that way for a purpose and a reason this is why david could say i'm fearfully and wonderfully made man i would be so out of place i mean it's oh my goodness i mean i do everything i can do when i have power points and things like that and thank god sometimes that i can go in gears like that i love that gear but you know what i can't i can't always do the the other things unless god would have me to do it you know for for a moment i just want to be free if you just be yourself you know you're not trying to worry do i have this or do i say it like this and do i do this just be yourself and let god use you brother braham said it over and over let go and let god have his way amen you know you're just learning learning in this way if you know people have you to preach if they don't care for it they won't have you back settled it so anyhow in acts 7 9 the patriarchs moved with envy and they sold joseph into egypt but god was with him you know what it speaks to you and i that even when times when envy that we can sense when envy has come against us envy envy has put us into a situation but let us remember that if god allows envy to come our way or against us let us remember god that permits it is the god who's faithful is the god who is with us and god will take that and he'll use it for his goodness because when actuality a prophetic eye was able to see that down there in this time when joseph was down there god had to work a little bit of pride out of joseph's life glory be to god acts 13 44. here's some jews at uh at antioch in presidio here's where paul and them are are preaching the bible says the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of god but when the jews saw the multitudes they glorified god knew when the jews saw the multitudes they were filled with envy and spake against those things which were spoken by paul contradicting and blasphemy they didn't know what they were doing they were filled with the same spirit that led that division in heaven i mean think of it who wouldn't want to see somebody these are jews witnessing god dealing among the gentiles they knew what the gem what we were pagans heathens idol worshipers hey you don't have to get too detailed to get into reading of the kind of stuff that went on and the lives and things that was just it was common just as much as packing peanut butter and jelly in your lunchbox come on somebody and the jews could look at them and say oh my oh goodness oh my you would have thought they would have you you would have thought they would have at least rejoiced and said praise god i'm going to be working next to somebody on the line now that my they're not going to have to watch their mouth and they're not going to have their pinups they're not going to do this i'm not going to do that hey come on some of you even when god got a hold of your life you had family that called you a nut called you crazy come on now you think about think about brother branham's here's his daddy his daddy told him you ain't coming and living in this house with that religion kicked him out when he got saved there had to be a decision that was made come on paul writes of this in the book of hebrews you're thought to be a gazing stock you became companion of those who were so used you're becoming outcasts and people ridiculing you people making fun of you but you had met one it become the love of your life he become the one that they can say what happened to you you could say i met jesus i met him and he took it all away don't you want to know him hallelujah you see it's something about it that here they would be filled listen you've even find this sometimes among the workplace where people will be filled with envy and you think what kind of a spirit is coming against me what what reason do they even have to disagree with me you've done nothing maybe but good i'm gonna tell them if you're an agitator then you've got what you got come on now but you understand what i'm saying when because the bible tells us we're to live peaceably with all men as much as lies within you filled with envy now notice here's another place in acts 17 4 and some of them believe and consorted with paul and simon here's some more gentiles at thessalonica and of the devout greeks a great multitude and of the chief women not a few oh my the chief women chief people not a few i mean if it would only been two or three then let they go but it wasn't a few see they were hearing the word of god they were they were hearing a trumpet being sounded to their life they realized i can go free and they just were turning loose in the liberty of god look what this did the jews which believed not moved with envy i'm talking about jews people who knew the law they could quote the word frontwards and backwards knew the prophets knew the psalms and this and ever you say just because they were jews i believe there's some implication here there the scripture is letting us know because remember it was an outcast that crucified the lord jesus they crucified him and they sung the very psalms of what was taking place but they were so blind that they didn't recognize what was taking place well how were they so blind envy brings blindness envy is a horrible thing it can bring a blindness to people don't even know the decision they're making and it's this trap they're being led right into what does that envy moon within me took unto them look at this certain lewd fellows of the baser sort these are guys that were total outcasts these are guys you didn't want around your neighborhood these are guys these jews didn't want to associate with but they knew where to go get troublemakers the bible said certain lewd fellows of the baser sort and gathered a company and set all the city on an uproar and assaulted the house of jason and sought to bring them out to the people what did that they were moved within thee brother i hear brother branham through the message as he says he says even in congress right now he said they're putting up laws he said laws he said to close us down to stop this message and to do he said you know the reason of it is they're filled with envy it's jealousy when it ought to be something they should be rejoicing they said there should be a rejoicing but it's not but do you realize what the sadness of it is it's spirits that's right it's darkness it's what paul called that present darkness and that darkness is evil demonic forces satan let it be known to jesus when he offered him the kings and the kingdoms of the world you let him know i can give you these so brother branham made it so clear he said every man that goes up there is not born again as of the devil it's on my words that's the words of the prophet is that right now i understand how brother branham brings it brother brown will even when he would pray for the presidential election he would pray in a certain way god if you give us grace that here someone comes in that there would be time for more souls in other words someone who would be favorable to that uh to that of the churches but if not then god give us grace yes as he was praying in 1960 you're aware of that that prayer they were these individuals were filled within me remember it was nero nero sat rome on fire and then turned around and blamed it on the christians he was filled with envy you see it shows that very thing among the people and it just starts and it turns around like these are the people that's the problem these are the people that's the problem but you know it gets to finally to a place to where it was like pharaoh came out in egypt and he said get out of here get out of here leave egypt adios hallelujah is that right in that same quote brother brown said see a man can live so close to god till the devil don't even know what to do with him until my sons and daughters of god the devil says i bring this i bring this i bring this i bring that and yet they still keep moving on all right dumb dumb dumb dumb devil it's not me that liveth it's christ that liveth in me now i want you to just let me just come to just a place i've just got just a couple moments here and i want to just bring us here to this place and then we'll just we'll just stop here there's no way i can even get to a place this is why brother branham makes a statement and he says no matter how good a christian is once you think of this no matter how good a christian is before the public how gracious he is to his fellow man doing not but good i don't have it up there but just listen let him confess christ as his savior and acknowledge the operation of the gifts of the holy spirit in tongues prophecy healing miracles and he will be condemned just acknowledge him as your savior you're all right but as soon as you acknowledge him as a living god that's a mosque then you'll be condemned because see a living god among us will not allow sin to remain a living god among us stands against sin is that right it calls sin out and because the devil is exposed what does satan do he works to try to rally and works to try to build envy you see this is where bill graham says c says the spirit of the world is very important the spirit of this world hates the spirit of god so what do i do don't get confused by the flesh and blood that's being used it's the spirit of the world see satan's trickery is to get you focused on the flesh the voice that's being used but recognize who's behind it is that right if you recognize who's behind it that's why brother bram says when your brother does this or your sister says that he says recognize it's not your brother it's not your sister it's the devil that made him do it how many of you have had to say honey forgive me i shouldn't have said it that way i shouldn't have done that oh my some of you must brought your angel wings in here tonight why why because the desire in our heart if you see even beyond everything it moves us into that place that's this is not who we are as i said last week we used to live at that address it used to be no don't walk through that guy's yard that guy come out on the porch we used to there used to be an address where another man used to live but that guy don't live here no more matter of fact brother carlos he had a funeral don't let me get on sunday's message he had there was a funeral service there was a funeral preaching everything but in one obituary where i put him in heaven the spirit of this world hates the spirit of god and because it can't overcome the spirit of the lord it tries to destroy the vessel in whom the spirit of truth dwells see persecution and those things it's it's a part in our life this is why in the scripture let me just try to just try to let me just end with this here proverbs 14 30 because i don't want to keep you i love this scripture a sound heart is the life of the flesh but in the the rottenness of the bones now let's say i love the scripture it's the first part of the scripture i take admonition from the second part but i love the promise and the first because the promise and the prayer first it speaks a sound heart you know what speaking of a healthful heart what's a healthful heart this doesn't mean that you've met all the american heart association they'll change their guidelines after a few years anyhow we're not talking about that but have you met god's guidelines has everything been settled in your heart between you and the lord have you entered into the rest of the lord have you entered into that place where it's the peace of god the love of god is dwelling in your heart by faith then you've got a sound heart and that soundness of heart is life to the flesh what a privilege it is you know what a privilege it is not only does the new birth make a way and it's the entrance ministered unto us it's the rest now the peace in our soul it's the token it's the seal it's the guarantee ah there in the changing of dimension but there is an effect even right now upon our bodies once you think of this you know there's a reason why satan while he'll come and he'll even try to affect us with different things this is why he'll try to come and he'll try to bring situations of stress when something is handed to you don't take it i'm not talking about the box of rattlesnakes now i'm not i'm talking about take it and put it into god's hands and when you put it in god's hands don't go and tamper with it and take it out of his hands and put it there right the bible says commit thy ways unto the lord commit it to god and i know sometimes it seems it sounds you hear brother brahm say it the scriptures would say it but i i've even said this over and over because i've found this in my own life but sometimes when it's something that it seems like it's you're just dwelling on you're wanting to resolve you're wanting to see solved you're wanting to sometimes i've even come to i've come to this place lord help me to come to a place of commitment help me yeah because i i don't believe in just well we just just committed and we just and then you actually you're still carrying it around i want to be honest with god because god god likes honesty god doesn't want us coming to him as an actor he said you just you just tell me what's on your heart we're buddies you can tell me what's on your heart we're friends is that right that's why even the scripture could say in the book of james confess your faults one to another and pray that you be healed there should be even that closeness among us as brothers and sisters let alone how much greater with god amen see god doesn't want us he wants us he wants us to be real to be genuine and so even in this here this this soundness and we see it that sometimes there's things that can come our way and this is why the devil will try to fight at your rest this is why brother branham would say it this way he says worry causes cancer temper causes cancer now you know i some of you may be doing you were too young but i i've dealt with i preached a few messages on this showing these things that the prophet preached and bringing them out in medical science even where they have people in nursing homes that are dealing sometimes with dementia sometimes you have those that that and they don't even deal with sometimes sometimes what actually uh i don't know if i got the right word exacerbates that and moves it forward is because there's a grudge that's been held there that's never been let go and one of the things that even these cancer doctors many times i'm talking sometimes facilities where people will go and they're receiving treatments one of the first things they'll deal with with these people is is to really look to see is there underlying things that they're still harboring like unforgiveness because that in itself this is this is medical science no matter how much treatment you do that right there that laying in that life will never allow the treatments to do any good this is why god says a sound heart is life to the flesh but envy is rottenness to the bones you know it's a disease then when it listen it's a disease inwardly it's things that can happen that's an inward condition this is why we need the help of god we need the help of god i think the lord is just he took us within this just a little bit into this tonight to show us god doesn't first of all god doesn't want us to be like everybody else i believe that we have to listen i believe we have to have godly examples i i believe there ought to be godly examples in the church husbands and wives i believe the pastor and his wife ought to be a real example but i'm not telling we understand we're not talking about showmanship we're talking about being natural it ought to be an example to the expression you understand paul picked this up in the book of titus he wrote to titus how that the older men are to minister to the younger men and the older women are to minister to the younger women because we recognize things that you've come through you also recognize pressures you recognize those things that's why paul would say that the older the elder would teach the younger hey we'll teach them hey be sober minded among other things the elder women teach the teach the younger ones i say elder don't don't don't get offended you older you understand teach them the bible says to love their husbands wow don't they love them they do but show them what it's all about but it's not like here we're going to get on the stage and i'm going to show it that's all he's talking about be natural let it be a display let god work in your life let it ought it's something that is so clear that's there but yet with all of those examples god doesn't want you trying to be like anybody else god doesn't want me to be like anybody else god wants you to be you but that doesn't mean set in our own ways that's that's not don't take it that far it means god has made you and i the way we are but it's to be yielded to him he's got a purpose in what he's done and this is why that even how god has made us and i think it's you know husbands and wives throughout this building you know tonight you could look and say then nobody else from me that becomes more real right nobody else from me but god he doesn't want us to be like nobody else neither does it listen to me he doesn't want things to be said in that way honey why can't you be like sister so-and-so or sweetie or honey who however you call your husband why can't you be like brother so-and-so that is setting up an atmosphere for envy why can't you do look you can see it right here we have four different song leaders and they're all different god doesn't want every one of us to be the same i know tonight some of you probably shocked he's got his suit caught on i'm shocked too but believe it or not i've preached a few times with a suit coat on the whole time but what does it god wants us to be wants us to be yielded wants to be simple we want to encourage one another i'm not interested in trying to shape one another i've said it before sometimes it's just like this when you know you come into a relationship you don't enter into a relationship because you think this is how i might better this individual you might as well forget it you're entering in with the total wrong purposes it's like somebody comes to a church well if i come and we come into this church we'll make this wrong the church is what it is see these are things that we need the discernment and it takes the desert see it not only takes the discernment of the holy spirit we want to have that receiving part of it that part that's receptive that part that puts aside these things because as we go on you'll see how this comes it narrows on down oh i'm just so grateful that the holy spirit loves us enough brother drake he loves us enough for the day he loves us enough but shane aaron he loves us enough to say hey what about this oh lord and all of a sudden you say god forgive me see you wouldn't mean and to harbor it you weren't meaning for that but see god knowing your heart that your heart's desire is to please him you'll make sure there's nothing between you and him don't you love him i just appreciate him tonight charity envy is not i don't want that that's not welcome here at this address it's not welcome and we can say that but really i think of how brother branham prayed it in the message everlasting life there in that new year's eve service in jeffersonville he says oh god keep envy from us lord keep it out of here lord keep it from among us don't even because we're not naive friends to say well envy can't get in here he got in heaven it came in the garden it shows that no matter how innocent we need the discernment of the holy ghost but samuel what does that bring us down to not even to trust our own selves [Music] heavenly father lord thank you tonight for your word your god your mercy to us lord knowing that there is a reason and there's a purpose fathers we've looked into these things you've been taking us lord in this journey oh god our hearts are challenged lord we're not looking or hearing things that are out far off somewhere but god from our hearts there's a desire lord that there's a discernment a discerning in our hearts that there would not be anything lord between between us and lord our our confidence is in you you you won't hide nothing from us you won't you'll bring those things to our attention if there's anything that's there not anything that we have to make up or this or that but but we want you to search us lord if there ever was a time we want you to search us dear god we want to stand with the real soundness of heart [Music] we want to
