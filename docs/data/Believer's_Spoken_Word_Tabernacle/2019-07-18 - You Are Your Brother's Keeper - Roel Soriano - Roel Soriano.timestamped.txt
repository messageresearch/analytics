[34:47] [Music]
[35:03] [Music]
[35:08] you really believe that tonight amen
[35:12] then we can stand like this as the
[35:16] Spirit of God in our life amen like
[35:18] Zerubbabel and say who art Thou O great
[35:21] mountain before Zerubbabel amen thou
[35:24] shalt become as a plain a man and you
[35:27] know it so many times we have we we we
[35:30] always have needs we have things that
[35:32] we're praying about and we're looking to
[35:33] God but you know sometimes we don't
[35:36] always see and this is where faith is so
[35:40] much greater than our sight because even
[35:42] then our feelings because you know your
[35:45] feelings can lie to us amen even our
[35:48] thoughts amen even the thoughts itself
[35:51] like brother cadre spoke here last
[35:52] Thursday night those thoughts if those
[35:54] thoughts are not according to the Word
[35:55] of God then we cast every one of them
[35:57] down amen and let me just put it let me
[36:00] just put it very clear like this that in
[36:02] even a thought that would come with the
[36:04] scripture come with a quote if it is any
[36:06] way to try to isolate your I outside of
[36:09] the body of Jesus Christ it is a lying
[36:11] spirit amen because there's only one
[36:16] that we are made to receive from and
[36:18] that's the Living God amen and anytime
[36:21] that he has anything to say to us and if
[36:24] he even corrects us the correction is
[36:26] glorious because it lets us know he
[36:29] loves us you know my flesh all my flesh
[36:32] just like your flesh can say oh oh but
[36:35] you know really correction itself when
[36:37] we look at in the scripture I love the
[36:38] word the word correction in the
[36:40] scripture when you look at it it means
[36:42] restoration now how many of us ever ever
[36:45] spanked our children and then didn't
[36:48] want anything to do with them no the
[36:50] reason we corrected him because we loved
[36:52] them and wanted to see that little thing
[36:54] in their life curbed out I'm glad that
[36:56] God loves me enough to correct me Amen
[36:59] I'm glad you know what that means it
[37:01] means his eyes on me amen when he
[37:03] corrects me and says I don't don't be
[37:05] thinking that way don't don't don't go
[37:07] that way
[37:08] that I'm so grateful for his mercy
[37:09] aren't you a man it's so good to be a
[37:12] Christian in a man it's good to be under
[37:15] the blood amen hallelujah amen so
[37:19] thankful for God for what he's done in
[37:21] this hour and what he's doing
[37:23] amen in this hour we just want to give
[37:25] the service here turn it over to brother
[37:27] Rowell and for many for here we
[37:30] recognized brother role has been with us
[37:32] many many years and brother o.l comes
[37:35] from the Philippines there in Manila
[37:37] where a pastor as an assembly God has
[37:39] used him for those of you that don't
[37:41] know God has used brother ol2 too as a
[37:46] vessel to to spread this message and
[37:48] they've had upon his heart he started
[37:50] many many years ago I don't even know
[37:52] how many years ago it was in what they
[37:54] called mystery Expos because you know a
[37:57] lot of the denominational ministers and
[38:00] things like that they want to know more
[38:01] things so they would invite them in
[38:05] prepare a meal for him and then invite
[38:08] them in and then just begin to you know
[38:10] teach amen the doctrines of the message
[38:13] and then eventually these pastors and
[38:15] ministers would turn around and say bye
[38:17] after the seventh or tenth day I think
[38:19] it was they turn around and say where
[38:21] are you getting this from so then when
[38:25] they ask naked men that's when they
[38:26] introduced this is the messenger for
[38:29] this age and they would introduce God's
[38:32] prophet brother branham and identified
[38:34] these are things in the scriptures and
[38:36] you see what it is
[38:36] they used scriptures to prove the
[38:41] doctrines of the word and I believe that
[38:44] with all my heart that's exactly what
[38:46] this message was sent to you and I to
[38:49] restore Bible faith how many of you love
[38:52] your Bible I love my Bible more don't
[38:56] you I just I look more and more just the
[38:58] light of God's Word and and there's been

[39:02] have just they've come come to the Lord
[39:04] the church and the congregation they Pat
[39:07] ties them in the name of the Lord Jesus
[39:08] Christ so if just it's just tremendous

[47:27] first John chapter 3 verse 11 and 12
[47:32] people want to talk about the message
[47:34] this is the message verse 11 for this is
[47:38] the message that you've heard from the
[47:42] beginning that we should love one
[47:45] another in say men not as Cain who was
[47:53] of the wicked one of that wicked one and
[47:56] slew his brother
[47:59] and were forced lui him what was the
[48:02] reason his to his brother because his
[48:06] own works were evil and his brothers
[48:10] righteous go to another scriptures in
[48:15] Romans chapter 12 verse 10 to 13 this is
[48:23] st. Paul's admonition to the church he
[48:28] said be kindly affectioned one to
[48:32] another
[48:34] with brotherly love in honour preferring
[48:40] one another not trying to compete with
[48:45] one another but prefer one another when
[48:50] it comes to honor not slothful in
[48:55] business but fervent in the spirit
[48:59] serving the Lord
[49:02] how many knows how she served its other
[49:04] your aptly serving the Lord rejoicing in
[49:09] Hope patient in tribulation continuing
[49:14] instant in prayer and distributing to
[49:18] the necessity of the Saints that means
[49:23] anybody had a need you should be always
[49:25] a week be willing to help meet that need
[49:33] distributing the student message
[49:35] necessity of the Saints and given to
[49:37] hospitality
[49:40] who another scriptures Galatians chapter
[49:45] 5 verse 13 to 15 st. Paul said for
[49:52] brethren ye have been called unto
[49:56] Liberty only use not Liberty for an
[50:03] occasion to the flesh but by love serve
[50:09] one another for all the law is fulfilled
[50:15] in one word even this
[50:18] thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[50:24] but if you bite in the bar one another
[50:29] take heed that ye be not consumed
[50:33] one of another these are the words of
[50:37] the Lord let's pray family father we now
[50:40] ask that you take this words take the
[50:43] service take your servant anoint this
[50:48] words the lips of your servant and to
[50:50] the minds and hearts of the audience
[50:52] Lord and we're just expecting a
[50:56] wonderful time in the service Lord and
[50:59] just ask that you give us the revelation
[51:04] of the words that we just read you want
[51:10] to thank you Lord and we ask that you
[51:13] come now and extend your hand and meet
[51:18] the need that is best represented in
[51:21] this service tonight for we want you to
[51:26] receive honor and glory in the name of
[51:29] our Lord Jesus Christ we pray I mean
[51:40] thank you Lord we have a great
[51:43] responsibility to be our brother's
[51:47] keeper in this day and age were problem
[51:58] says we we now live in the darkest of
[52:00] all the ages the Bible says iniquity
[52:05] will abound in this age and the love of
[52:10] many shall wax cold in this age more
[52:16] than any other aids in the history of
[52:19] mankind
[52:22] but early kindness is needed the church
[52:26] is one thing this world is one thing
[52:31] kindness from people that believe God
[52:37] and we believe the word and you should
[52:44] be able to we should know our
[52:46] responsibilities as Christians we need
[52:50] to look after each other not only after
[52:55] each other but who Bible said the Lord
[52:59] said love your neighbor my - who is my
[53:04] neighbor
[53:07] church mates or just the masses
[53:12] believers are they our neighbors or do
[53:16] we consider the Baptist's the Methodists
[53:17] the Catholics our neighbors do or
[53:21] perhaps even the sinners out there in
[53:26] the world
[53:36] because I believe that we have a we
[53:40] received a perfect message from the Lord
[53:44] and this message he us brought us to a
[53:50] state of maturity and the mark of
[53:56] maturity for me is selflessness
[54:01] Philippians chapter 2 verse 4 says look
[54:05] not every man on his own things but
[54:08] every man also on the things of others
[54:13] let's not be overly concerned about our
[54:16] own needs like we come to prayer meeting
[54:21] and we usually want to play pray for our
[54:27] own needs you know the bills we have to
[54:31] pay a tuition for the children you know
[54:36] medical services houses and cars the
[54:42] things that we need but a lot of times
[54:45] you forget the needs of others
[54:49] but if if a person is truly matured in
[54:52] the Lord has truly grown in faith and
[54:56] his spirituality he focuses less on
[55:00] himself and becomes he becomes Christ
[55:05] centered less and less of yourself and
[55:11] more and more more and more of Christ
[55:15] the RAM said is that said it like this
[55:17] you die to yourself
[55:19] and let the Holy Spirit live it's live
[55:23] its life through you hallelujah
[55:29] this is an overused quotation I would
[55:32] say but I'd like to read it once again
[55:37] God is calling us to live for others
[55:42] that bein Calgary where Bama said this
[55:46] he was just one man referring to the
[55:50] Lord Jesus the perfect man he gave his
[55:54] life and he made an example for you
[55:59] now what was what must we do now the
[56:04] first thing I want to say is Jesus never
[56:08] lived for himself his life was spent for
[56:13] others and that's perfectly eternal life
[56:18] when you say you go to church and you do
[56:21] good things that's fine but when you
[56:24] live your life to yourself
[56:26] you haven't got eternal life because
[56:29] eternal life
[56:31] is living for others that's how you know
[56:35] you got it it's because you spend your
[56:39] talents you expend your energies even
[56:46] you use your life to bless others to
[56:50] benefit others that's that's that's how
[56:53] you know you have received eternal life
[56:56] whose eternal life is living for others
[57:01] you are responsible for your brother as
[57:05] well the Bible states you're responsible
[57:09] for me and I'm responsible for you we
[57:18] should be our brothers keepers as
[57:20] Christians in Genesis chapter 4 and
[57:25] verse 9
[57:26] going back to what happened to Cain and
[57:28] Abel
[57:31] after Cain slew Abel he killed his own
[57:35] brother the Lord asked him verse 9 and
[57:40] the Lord said unto Cain where is Abel
[57:43] thy brother
[57:45] and then he said I know not
[57:49] and my brother's keeper good question
[57:56] well in the first place God is going God
[58:00] is not going to ask Cain the question if
[58:04] he is not responsible for his brother he
[58:09] said but he the older one the more
[58:13] experienced one should we say huh and it
[58:17] should be looking after his brother but
[58:22] we saw what happened instead of looking
[58:24] after the welfare of his brother there
[58:28] was a lot of pride and a lot of jealousy
[58:32] and in which led to hatred and in the
[58:38] end he came killed his brother what was
[58:43] the reason the Bible gave it to us
[58:45] because his brothers work was righteous
[58:50] because of Abel's righteousness Cain
[58:55] became prideful and became envious and
[58:59] he was very jealous because God accepted
[59:04] his sacrifice God received his worship
[59:08] and rejected Cain you see what a bit but
[59:13] would have been the most the sense it
[59:16] the sensible thing to do is for Cain to
[59:20] Humble himself and ask his younger
[59:22] brother Abel Abel what happened I did my
[59:27] best to worship God but he did not
[59:30] receive my sacrifice how come he receive
[59:32] yours can you please share with me what
[59:38] did I do wrong that would have been the
[59:42] most sensitive sense a sensible thing to
[59:44] do right but he was lifted up in Pride
[59:50] and became very jealous of his brother
[59:53] to the point of hating him and he killed
[59:59] him right on the altar hallelujah added
[1:00:06] to that he denied his responsibility and
[1:00:10] lied to God
[1:00:14] I don't know where my brother Abel is
[1:00:17] and behind my brother's keeper
[1:00:22] can you imagine this God was speaking to
[1:00:27] Cain and Cain lied to God and even deny
[1:00:33] this responsibility that God entrusted
[1:00:37] to him to be eased to take to look after
[1:00:40] his brother said am I my brother's
[1:00:43] keeper
[1:00:45] of course there's no sense of asking you
[1:00:48] the question where is your brother Abel
[1:00:50] in the first place what's the sense of
[1:00:54] God asking me the question where's your
[1:00:57] brother Abel who which tells us that we
[1:01:01] are responsible for our brother we must
[1:01:12] not shun that responsibility that God
[1:01:15] has given to us to look after the
[1:01:19] welfare of our brother you are your
[1:01:24] brother's keeper whether you like it or
[1:01:28] not you have a responsibility to look
[1:01:31] after your brother look after his
[1:01:34] well-being the other responsibility to
[1:01:38] keep keep him away from harm and even
[1:01:43] defend him against this enemy against
[1:01:48] anybody who wants to harm him because
[1:01:52] you are your brother's keeper you need
[1:01:54] to see to it that your brother's needs
[1:01:58] are met
[1:02:06] you need to be a helper amen you need to
[1:02:14] be ready to come to the rescue of your
[1:02:18] brother every time he's in need
[1:02:20] hallelujah you are responsible
[1:02:26] in the Book of Luke chapter 22 verse 32
[1:02:33] the Lord said about Peter
[1:02:36] Peter I prayed for thee I have prayed
[1:02:39] for they that they die faith they'll not
[1:02:44] and when thou art converted strengthen
[1:02:47] thy brother I think God is trying to
[1:02:57] tell us something here after you're
[1:03:01] converted that's after you received the
[1:03:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost because this
[1:03:09] was what was lacking in Peters life he
[1:03:13] was serving God he was you know he was
[1:03:16] praying for the sake and maybe preaching
[1:03:18] the gospel but he didn't have the Holy
[1:03:21] Ghost
[1:03:22] Alleluia it's a good thing that he still
[1:03:25] had faith and he was holding on to his
[1:03:27] faith it's a good thing that Jesus
[1:03:30] prayed for Peter
[1:03:32] hallelujah and I want to tell you the
[1:03:38] good news that Jesus prayed for you
[1:03:41] don't believe me look at John chapter 70
[1:03:45] and read the whole chapter and Jesus
[1:03:48] actually prayed for you Alleluia oh I'm
[1:03:52] so glad that Jesus prayed for me like
[1:03:55] Peter amen he when he denied the Lord
[1:03:59] Jesus
[1:04:00] his faith was failing hallelujah but
[1:04:04] thank God that the Lord has prayed for
[1:04:06] him so that his fail his faith fail not
[1:04:10] aren't you happy that somebody paid for
[1:04:13] us hallelujah not just anybody but the
[1:04:16] Lord Himself prayed for us that our
[1:04:18] faith amen our faith our faith is our
[1:04:21] revelation God gave it to us in the
[1:04:25] first place how can it fail when God
[1:04:28] gave it to us hallelujah so praise God
[1:04:32] amen but it's not it's not enough to
[1:04:35] have faith
[1:04:37] amen and try to live a Christian life
[1:04:44] somebody told me I was talking to him

[1:04:51] you think it's it's difficult in our day
[1:04:55] and age to live a truly Christian life
[1:04:59] and I said it's I'm sorry but it's not
[1:05:02] it's not difficult it's impossible it's
[1:05:08] impossible for us to live a Christian
[1:05:10] life

[1:05:31] memorize all the sermons you understand
[1:05:34] all mysteries the Bible says hallelu it
[1:05:36] will amount to nothing Alleluia you need
[1:05:40] to be born again you need to be baptized
[1:05:44] by the Holy Spirit into the body of
[1:05:47] Christ hallelujah that's the only way
[1:05:50] you can go in there's no other way
[1:05:54] fix the Holy Ghost to convert a person

[1:19:04] church affiliation
[1:19:06] let me just rip the
[1:19:10] the the fonts are a little small but we
[1:19:13] can I can read it for you
[1:19:15] well one said thirsting for life 1960 if
[1:19:21] we can discern the spirit of one another
[1:19:24] and realize if a man comes in I don't
[1:19:29] care what church he belongs to if he's
[1:19:32] got the Spirit of God on him he's my
[1:19:35] brother I say amen to that
[1:19:40] Alleluia hallelujah
[1:19:42] he doesn't have to belong to my church
[1:19:45] he doesn't have to belong to a church
[1:19:47] the fellowships with me hallelujah a
[1:19:51] church that doesn't differ with me in my
[1:19:53] understanding of the doctrine if he's
[1:19:56] got the Spirit of God he's my brother
[1:19:58] oh my I love this hallelujah and I don't
[1:20:04] care how great he is how intellectual he
[1:20:07] is how powerful he can speak if there's
[1:20:09] if he's trying to receive the wrong
[1:20:12] thing I don't believe it's my brother
[1:20:14] yet but it's what he's trying to do if
[1:20:20] he's trying to save souls or do
[1:20:22] something for God
[1:20:23] that's a brother who my god help us to
[1:20:33] accept a man that's trying to do
[1:20:36] something for God a man that strike
[1:20:40] trying his best to help others
[1:20:43] hallelujah lead souls to God hallelujah
[1:20:47] that's a brother if he's trying to save
[1:20:50] souls or do something for God
[1:20:53] listen if he said you over witness he's
[1:20:57] still my brother
[1:20:58] I know it's hard for some people to
[1:21:05] follow this but better than you said it
[1:21:09] if he's a Jehovah's Witness
[1:21:11] is still my brother if these Pentecostal
[1:21:15] Holiness Assembly of God Church of God
[1:21:17] oneness tuners three nests we look not
[1:21:23] on finitary in people but better man
[1:21:25] said if it's one the students or three
[1:21:27] nests Halloween or whatever it might be
[1:21:30] is all my brother and sister hallelujah
[1:21:37] I'm expecting a big Amen on that am i
[1:21:45] reading the prophet of God I'm not
[1:21:49] reading from about this book
[1:21:50] I'm quoting to you what the prophet of
[1:21:53] God said hallelujah if if God our hearts
[1:21:58] right with God trying to achieve
[1:22:01] something for the kingdom of God we're
[1:22:03] trying to build a kingdom of our own
[1:22:05] then that God won't honor that
[1:22:11] but if a brother a sister is doing his
[1:22:14] best to build up the kingdom of God and
[1:22:17] not his own kingdom that's my brother
[1:22:20] that's my sister amen I need to help him
[1:22:24] do the best that I can to protect him
[1:22:26] and support him hallelujah and show
[1:22:29] kindness to him hallelujah
[1:22:34] even if he is not one of us
[1:22:39] bourbon said contains they continue
[1:22:43] sunset the other day in boom on Texas a
[1:22:46] certain group of people denominational
[1:22:49] church that had 72 churches sponsoring
[1:22:53] my meetings this is a denominational
[1:22:57] Church but they are sponsoring better
[1:22:59] brands meetings 72 of them
[1:23:03] we work with a lot of denominational
[1:23:06] people denominational churches that are
[1:23:10] supporting the message believe it or not
[1:23:12] in the Philippines
[1:23:17] whether Samwell has met a lot of them
[1:23:22] and a lot of them are poor people out in
[1:23:29] the country some house isolated mountain
[1:23:31] or island hallelujah but we go to them
[1:23:35] and preach the message to them we do
[1:23:39] they eat mr. Expo seminar we invite them
[1:23:42] and feed them and we don't care whether
[1:23:45] a Baptist Methodist you're over witness
[1:23:47] as long as they're willing to sit down
[1:23:49] and listen to us expound the word the
[1:23:53] Bible for a whole day hallelujah without
[1:23:57] even mentioning better balanced name
[1:24:01] hallelujah because I believe God is able
[1:24:05] to do that God is able to to reveal this
[1:24:11] word Amen people don't need better
[1:24:15] Brenda for his word to be revealed
[1:24:23] it amazes people in purple bands message
[1:24:27] you Bieber did your the 11 hundred
[1:24:29] messages
[1:24:31] allelujah you've heard it all you've
[1:24:33] heard it all but without the Holy Ghost
[1:24:36] you can never understand it amen we need
[1:24:43] the Holy Spirit
[1:24:47] embrace God for about four years we have
[1:24:52] been working with 60 churches in Palawan
[1:24:54] mr. denominational churches but they're
[1:24:58] their pastors have already received a
[1:25:00] message they have been baptized in the
[1:25:01] name of the Lord but they just don't
[1:25:05] know how to go about you know teaching
[1:25:07] the message to their people it's kind of
[1:25:09] hyper or somebody to who has taught his
[1:25:13] people that there are three guards for
[1:25:16] thirty years and all of a sudden he
[1:25:18] would say today I'm going to teach you
[1:25:21] something else all that I taught you
[1:25:24] thirteen for thirty years have been
[1:25:26] wrong
[1:25:29] now this is the right teaching
[1:25:32] it's kind of hard for foreign minister
[1:25:34] to do that because if I if I'm sitting
[1:25:37] in the congregation I would be asking
[1:25:41] how sure are you now that you've got the
[1:25:44] right thing amen so what they did they
[1:25:49] open their pulpit wide to us message
[1:25:52] preachers and so we go there visit their
[1:25:56] churches on a regular basis and minister
[1:25:58] to them the message of the hour
[1:26:01] little by little until they come to an
[1:26:04] understanding but the message is all
[1:26:07] about hallelujah and out of the 60
[1:26:11] churches had opened their doors to us 24
[1:26:15] of them are now solidly believing the
[1:26:19] truth of this message glory to God I
[1:26:25] thought men assembled that's not a bad
[1:26:28] number that's not a bad person taste at
[1:26:30] all 24 out of 60 and we have led
[1:26:37] hundreds of congregations from
[1:26:39] denomination in this way hallelujah you
[1:26:48] think we can do this without the Holy
[1:26:49] Ghost No hallelujah
[1:26:54] and so we give him all the glory they
[1:26:57] give him all the honor because he's the
[1:26:59] one that's doing this amen hallelujah
[1:27:04] let's continue on he said seventy three
[1:27:07] churches sponsoring my meetings and they
[1:27:10] had a great meeting going on and I had a
[1:27:13] brother setting on the appropriate Oh up
[1:27:16] on the platform and a district press
[1:27:19] Peter called me that day and he said I
[1:27:21] resent that Bell Bell
[1:27:24] Oh what did bad random dude I resent
[1:27:28] that better when you had a man on the
[1:27:30] platform that was baptised world
[1:27:36] he said how could you do that
[1:27:39] and badman said why
[1:27:50] or the man said why why did you do that
[1:27:53] I said her mom said well it's my brother
[1:28:00] are you listening a man that's been
[1:28:04] baptized wrong and bourbon calls him my
[1:28:08] brother and lets him on the prophet or
[1:28:12] on the platform of his meeting and he
[1:28:17] was reprimanded for it and somebody
[1:28:20] resented it that he did it said why why
[1:28:24] what did you do it I said his he said
[1:28:26] he's he's my brother a submission I did
[1:28:30] it he's my brother
[1:28:36] the presbytery might be thinking he's a
[1:28:39] devil this man was a devil when
[1:28:42] Bannerman was saying he's my brother
[1:28:45] I want you to know he's my brother
[1:28:48] that's why I left him standing on the
[1:28:51] appropriate or on the platform with me
[1:28:53] because that's my brother
[1:28:58] I said now he said you know what we done
[1:29:03] oh this was just a fad now this press
[1:29:07] Peter was threatening by Braille he said
[1:29:09] we've draw the line and cut you out from
[1:29:12] among sense we will no longer sponsor
[1:29:19] your meetings you're not one of us
[1:29:21] anymore we draw a circle and rolled you
[1:29:25] out and I said now I'm going to draw a
[1:29:28] little line above you and cut you back
[1:29:31] in again
[1:29:33] I said I bring why you're my brother I'm
[1:29:43] riding on it I don't care what they
[1:29:46] believe I believe that Jesus Christ is
[1:29:50] not divided all one body we won in Hope
[1:29:55] and doctrine won in charity I think
[1:30:00] we're seeing that a lot in this church
[1:30:02] how long do you on what Christian
[1:30:04] soldier right Jesus Christ the same
[1:30:07] yesterday today and forever
[1:30:09] I'm riding on it hallelujah I guess by
[1:30:18] now you understand what I'm driving at
[1:30:21] but early kindness be kind to one
[1:30:28] another love one another serve one
[1:30:31] another
[1:30:32] hallelujah because if you devour one
[1:30:36] another now Paul was not talking about
[1:30:40] literal devouring you know I don't think
[1:30:46] people were eating one another during
[1:30:48] post time but II Men character
[1:30:52] assassination even speaking evil about
[1:30:58] each other
[1:30:59] hallelujah but biting all the jealousies
[1:31:05] and envy hallelujah
[1:31:07] all the grudges against one another
[1:31:09] hallelujah oh my I think of the message
[1:31:14] movement as I read this verse if you
[1:31:18] devour one another here
[1:31:22] who do you expect to help you you've
[1:31:27] already devoured your brother
[1:31:32] if you devour one another then who else
[1:31:35] can help us tell me hallelujah as the
[1:31:42] recent Bevin said if you have nothing
[1:31:44] good to say about your brother it's
[1:31:47] better to zip your lip up be quiet don't
[1:31:54] say anything at all because if you
[1:31:57] destroy your brother's honor you're
[1:32:00] destroying yourself
[1:32:06] the one who can help you you're trying
[1:32:09] to devour him oh my goodness you're
[1:32:13] supposed to protect him and support him
[1:32:17] and defend this integrity because this
[1:32:20] your brother
[1:32:28] Murr I mean messes fellowship said I
[1:32:32] have learned to love brother Joseph he
[1:32:35] meant butter Joseph Jose
[1:32:38] here's what I like about him many things
[1:32:41] first
[1:32:43] being a Christian brother second you can
[1:32:46] depend on what he says I like it I like
[1:32:51] a man when he tells you anything he'll
[1:32:54] stand by it
[1:32:57] don't you like that kind of a person it
[1:33:00] says something he stands by it
[1:33:02] another thing is he's my friend whether
[1:33:06] I'm right or wrong
[1:33:07] oh my I'd like to have friends like that
[1:33:16] you have a word in English I think you
[1:33:18] called you call them Fairweather friends
[1:33:22] they're only your friends as long as
[1:33:25] you're right as long as the weather is
[1:33:28] right you know people you know how are
[1:33:33] complaining because of the heat there's
[1:33:36] a heat wave there's a warning against
[1:33:37] heat wave supposed to strike tonight
[1:33:40] today tomorrow a couple of days but I
[1:33:46] love this kind of weather I love it
[1:33:53] hallelujah
[1:33:59] amen
[1:34:01] I don't like Fairweather friends I'll do
[1:34:06] it hmm
[1:34:07] whether I'm right or wrong but mom said
[1:34:11] this is what I like about butter Joseph
[1:34:12] whether I'm right or wrong he's my
[1:34:16] friend
[1:34:18] now anybody can be your friend while you
[1:34:21] are right
[1:34:23] can you relate to this as long as you're
[1:34:27] right assume you're alright you're okay
[1:34:29] you're doing nothing wrong they're your
[1:34:33] friends
[1:34:34] anybody can be a friend when you're in
[1:34:36] the right but when you're in the wrong
[1:34:42] then his steel your friend now that's
[1:34:46] not all times that I am right and I
[1:34:52] wonder about people in the message that
[1:34:54] think better Benham do not come did not
[1:34:57] commit any mistakes everyone said I'm
[1:35:02] not always in the right I'm not always
[1:35:07] in the right you know big the biggest
[1:35:14] part of time of the time I'm perhaps
[1:35:17] around I didn't say it but I'm said it
[1:35:24] the biggest part of the time perhaps I
[1:35:28] am wrong but whether I'm wrong or right
[1:35:31] josepho say is my friend I have seen him
[1:35:36] in his hard trials and I've seen him in
[1:35:38] his time when the public knows nothing
[1:35:40] about when he comes up against testing
[1:35:42] time he's always stood by my side like a
[1:35:46] brother and I appreciate that very much
[1:35:48] Oh hallelujah
[1:35:52] don't you appreciate friends that that
[1:35:55] will stay with you even if you're wrong
[1:36:01] I'll do it
[1:36:04] you appreciate them don't you
[1:36:07] but when other people other other
[1:36:09] believers are in the wrong you're very
[1:36:13] quick to keep away from them
[1:36:21] you want people to befriend you even if
[1:36:23] you're wrong but when other people are
[1:36:26] in the wrong
[1:36:28] you don't want anything to do with that
[1:36:32] I'm telling you that's not brotherly
[1:36:35] kindness but mommy didn't do that but
[1:36:39] even I appreciate brother Joseph bow say
[1:36:42] because even though he's in the wrong is
[1:36:45] fixed by him too thick or thin because
[1:36:47] it's a brother message believers that
[1:36:57] good are good at rebuking good approving
[1:37:02] people around we were wrong to do this
[1:37:04] you're wrong to do that it's the right
[1:37:07] way to do go about doing things we're so
[1:37:10] good we've mastered the art of proving
[1:37:13] people wrong but the book of Galatians
[1:37:20] says yes rebuke people who are in the
[1:37:23] wrong but also try to restore them
[1:37:29] listen brethren if a man be overtaken in
[1:37:33] a fault
[1:37:35] here with our spiritual restore such a
[1:37:40] one in the spirit of what meekness
[1:37:44] considering thyself lest thou also be
[1:37:48] tempted we are not always right brothers
[1:37:58] in sisters in the church may sometimes
[1:38:02] be wrong like better Benham most of the
[1:38:05] time they may be wrong but what do you
[1:38:08] do with they're wrong when they commit a
[1:38:12] mistake or when they're at the fall
[1:38:16] hallelujah
[1:38:17] well st. Paul said if your spiritual
[1:38:20] you're supposed to restore your brother
[1:38:25] no this is the instruction for people
[1:38:28] who are spiritual of course Connor
[1:38:33] people don't do this they crucify people
[1:38:37] who are in the wrong they shame them
[1:38:43] they'd Estela tip them
[1:38:47] they call them they call them all kinds
[1:38:51] of bad names evil names
[1:38:54] hallelujah but Paul said restore such a
[1:38:58] man in the spirit of witness neatness
[1:39:02] considering thyself that thou also be
[1:39:06] them tempted lest thou also be tempted
[1:39:09] in other words do it in humility I'm
[1:39:16] finding people find it hard to receive
[1:39:22] that they're in the wrong when the
[1:39:26] person telling them that they're in the
[1:39:29] wrong are not doing it it's not doing it
[1:39:32] in the spirit of meekness you know you
[1:39:37] can rebuke a brother in the spirit of
[1:39:40] love because truth always hurts amen but
[1:39:49] you can speak the truth in love
[1:39:52] the Bible says speak the truth in love
[1:39:54] we believe the message is the truth but
[1:40:01] I know a lot of people that don't speak
[1:40:03] the message in love they're speaking the
[1:40:09] message in pride in yourself
[1:40:17] righteousness not in the spirit of
[1:40:21] meekness they are Carla
[1:40:24] I thought I told better I thought better
[1:40:29] Sam you know I know a lot of people that
[1:40:31] grow grow in the knowledge of our Savior
[1:40:35] Jesus Christ but the Bible said grow in
[1:40:38] grace first grow in grace and in the
[1:40:43] knowledge of our Savior Jesus Christ
[1:40:48] people forget about grace if you come
[1:40:53] next Sunday this coming Sunday maybe
[1:40:56] that would be my message the message of
[1:40:58] grace but may God help us to grow in
[1:41:04] grace first before we grow in the
[1:41:08] knowledge and of our Savior Jesus Christ
[1:41:11] before we grow in the knowledge of all
[1:41:13] the mysteries the deep teachings in the
[1:41:17] Messick's
[1:41:18] holiday first we need to grow in grace
[1:41:22] for all you know you you have not
[1:41:24] received the message if not for the
[1:41:26] grace of God
[1:41:27] [Applause]
[1:41:34] verse two says bear ye one another's
[1:41:38] burden
[1:41:40] and so fulfill the law of Christ what
[1:41:45] bear your brother sins bear your brother
[1:41:50] shame don't be ashamed to be identified
[1:41:56] to your brother when he's in the wrong
[1:42:00] your brother needs company in its
[1:42:03] comfort he needs enlightenment you need
[1:42:07] somebody to share with him encourage him
[1:42:09] hallelujah amen
[1:42:13] bear one another's burden don't be
[1:42:18] selfish
[1:42:21] think about your own burden your own
[1:42:23] trials and problems in life you forget
[1:42:28] about your brother but we have a
[1:42:31] commission to bear one another's burdens
[1:42:36] this is the way we fulfilled the law of
[1:42:40] what the law of Christ this is not the
[1:42:45] law of Moses this is the law of Christ
[1:42:48] is that the Old Testament this is the
[1:42:50] New Testament hallelujah this is a
[1:42:52] better Testament Alleluia
[1:43:01] forgive and restore fellowship
[1:43:08] snatcher of a perfect man but ban said
[1:43:12] when we get to that brotherly kindness
[1:43:17] put yourself in his place on the matter
[1:43:21] oh my you're quick to condemn because
[1:43:28] you don't know what the person is going
[1:43:29] through
[1:43:34] but perhaps he committed something wrong
[1:43:36] he made the wrong decision hallelujah
[1:43:39] because he's going through some of the
[1:43:41] hardest trials in life and the way to do
[1:43:46] it Berman said put yourself in place in
[1:43:49] his place on the matter
[1:43:53] where his shoes know where he's coming
[1:43:57] from try to understand the brother
[1:44:02] hallelujah my brother sin against me
[1:44:06] said Peter
[1:44:08] shall I forgive him
[1:44:11] he said seven times a day Peter thought
[1:44:15] that was a lot shall I forgive him seven
[1:44:21] times Lord listen but seventy times
[1:44:26] seven 490 times a day
[1:44:38] we're talking about brotherly kindness
[1:44:39] here some of us can only be kind to a
[1:44:44] brother up to a certain point okay you
[1:44:50] did it to me trice already you can you
[1:44:53] can do it to me again five times it's
[1:44:58] too much but the Lord said 490 times you
[1:45:04] have to forgive your brother every day
[1:45:07] Oh may God help us
[1:45:11] may God help us
[1:45:14] I need that brotherly kindness in my
[1:45:16] life he said seventy times seven see
[1:45:23] brotherly kindness
[1:45:27] now you see if a brother is all out of
[1:45:30] tune don't be impatient with him
[1:45:36] see be kind to him go anyhow that works
[1:45:44] but remember suppose was saying go and
[1:45:47] fellowship with him help the brother
[1:45:50] tells him what he's doing wrong tell him
[1:45:54] where he's out of the world go anyway
[1:45:57] hallelujah the hardest person to deal
[1:46:01] you know I was a
[1:46:04] I learned a choir in the beginning when
[1:46:06] I first started out in ministry because
[1:46:09] there was no choir director we had no
[1:46:11] musicians no we I was just doing it
[1:46:14] everything by myself I was this song
[1:46:18] leader I was the minister I was a Sunday
[1:46:20] school teacher I was the choir director
[1:46:24] and the hardest person to deal with is
[1:46:29] the man that tries his best to sing but
[1:46:32] they stone death brother branham says
[1:46:39] when the brother is all out of tune what

[1:47:14] end of the day he'll catch on he'll be
[1:47:18] singing in tune oh yeah Birnbaum said
[1:47:27] brotherly kindness is the virtue for the
[1:47:31] age
[1:47:34] at first I was thinking this was for
[1:47:39] John Wesley's age because John versus
[1:47:43] AIDS was the AIDS of Philadelphia and
[1:47:47] Philadelphia means brotherly kindness
[1:47:50] the love of bredrin
[1:47:53] so I thought Bobby the kindness was for
[1:47:56] John Wesley's age but better Berman said
[1:47:59] differently in a message statue of a
[1:48:02] perfect man he said after Columba the
[1:48:06] Dark Ages come in there and then comes
[1:48:10] Sardis which meant death
[1:48:13] Luther hallelujah what then what come
[1:48:16] next after Sardis Luther then comes
[1:48:19] filler dope Philadelphia godliness
[1:48:23] worsley holiness just the just shall
[1:48:27] live by faith sale said Luther
[1:48:30] sanctification through Wesley and then
[1:48:34] come in brotherly kindness through the
[1:48:36] Laodicea
[1:48:43] so in laodicea
[1:48:45] this was what God is still God is
[1:48:48] looking for
[1:48:50] God is working in the hearts of people
[1:48:53] hallelujah
[1:48:55] so that they can be kind to one another
[1:48:59] they can begin to love their brothers
[1:49:03] hallelujah
[1:49:06] then come in brotherly kindness rule day
[1:49:08] you Tasya
[1:49:10] and if we believe the great message of
[1:49:12] the second appeal of Elijah in the last
[1:49:14] days shall sweep the land
[1:49:18] this great message shall sweep the land
[1:49:21] when in Laodicea what is the virtue for
[1:49:26] the Aged brotherly kindness hallelujah
[1:49:33] in the most sinful age in the darkest of
[1:49:38] all the ages when the iniquity shall
[1:49:41] abound and the love of many shall wax
[1:49:44] cold Matthew 24:12
[1:49:47] brotherly kindness is needed in this age
[1:49:54] do you care for your brother
[1:49:56] the steamiest names but mom said now you
[1:50:00] might say look I sure don't like brother
[1:50:04] Nevel or I sure don't like brother Jones
[1:50:07] I don't like better so-and-so and
[1:50:09] something like that
[1:50:10] but just let something happen to him
[1:50:12] brother your heart is broke
[1:50:15] it just nearly kills you see we can
[1:50:19] obtain brotherly kindness and feeling
[1:50:21] for one another
[1:50:25] you have taught me to be honest
[1:50:28] there's people in our church that we
[1:50:30] don't understand perhaps you don't
[1:50:36] express it but in your heart you think
[1:50:38] oh here comes this brother again I just
[1:50:42] hate him with a passion I just hate the
[1:50:48] way he dresses the way he speaks the way
[1:50:53] he reasons out
[1:50:54] I just hate everything about him the RAM
[1:51:01] says you might think you might say I
[1:51:03] hate but I don't I don't like better

[1:51:14] brother meets an accident in a car wreck
[1:51:16] maybe maybe or or he he hasn't he
[1:51:20] suffers a stroke or a heart attack and
[1:51:23] is confined in the hospital your heart
[1:51:25] is broke amen it's alright to have
[1:51:31] feelings sometimes as human beings we
[1:51:33] have ill feelings we don't understand
[1:51:36] each other perfectly we have differences
[1:51:39] purposes it's alright
[1:51:42] hallelujah but that that doesn't that

[1:51:55] hallelujah that's how you know you have
[1:51:57] brotherly kindness if your brother is

[1:55:44] my heart that's something I lost out
[1:55:48] here in that complex he was saying this
[1:55:52] about himself but when I'm built a
[1:55:54] complex because he was hurt so much by
[1:55:57] what people say or see here so he
[1:56:00] developed a complex it is so easy to
[1:56:03] build a complex relabel says if you're

[1:56:39] feelings the same as you do have

[1:56:53] and they have a soul within them oh my
[1:56:58] hallelujah thank you better burn

[1:57:20] add to that virtue and to that what
[1:57:23] brotherly kindness second Peter chapter
[1:57:25] 1 verse 7 until you're built in the full
[1:57:28] stature of Christ and then the last
[1:57:32] thing that is that the last thing is
[1:57:34] love with God the Holy Spirit seals you
[1:57:37] to your destination stature of a perfect
[1:57:40] man amen are your waist aware that the
[1:57:43] statue of a perfect man is the statue of
[1:57:46] Christ there's no other perfect man but
[1:57:49] came statue of the perfect Christ but

[1:57:59] born again
[1:58:02] hallelujah you can be like Jesus you can
[1:58:08] have all these virtuous Alleluia
[1:58:13] some people like to work into these
[1:58:16] virtues like one of em said it's a
[1:58:20] lather and a lot of people they they
[1:58:22] want to work into this virtuous Word so
[1:58:25] that they can have faith word so that
[1:58:27] they can have a virtue and knowledge and
[1:58:30] patience and all these mergers but if
[1:58:33] you think about it how can you work
[1:58:35] faith how can you work your way into
[1:58:42] faith think about it all these churches
[1:58:48] they come to you by the grace of God by
[1:58:52] the power of the Holy Spirit by the
[1:58:58] power of the resurrection of Jesus
[1:58:59] Christ you don't work your way into
[1:59:04] anything this all happens by grace and
[1:59:09] the Spirit of God is the one to
[1:59:14] and do you with this virtuous hallelujah
[1:59:18] don't talk to me about a God power when
[1:59:21] you can even love your brother
[1:59:29] and you cannot impersonate it it's got
[1:59:32] to be real in you but one said you
[1:59:34] cannot impersonate you can impersonate
[1:59:37] it but as I said last night it's just
[1:59:40] like a blackbird booting pick up
[1:59:43] feathers in his wings and saying see I'm
[1:59:45] a peacock
[1:59:47] but he just added them and pushed them
[1:59:50] in
[1:59:52] and who here he's a fake pika
[1:59:58] Alleluia if there is something on the
[2:00:02] inside of him made him push them out he
[2:00:06] that will be a peacock
[2:00:08] certainly but some people are trying to
[2:00:12] do something to look like somebody
[2:00:14] somebody else or impersonate somebody
[2:00:17] else because they thought they did it
[2:00:22] and you see what it does it brings us
[2:00:25] back into a red wall and form again this
[2:00:32] message has brought out us out of
[2:00:36] denominationalism it brought us out -
[2:00:39] amen traditional religion rituals and
[2:00:43] forms hallelujah but we see it again in
[2:00:49] churches we see it again
[2:00:53] divisions brother tearing down a brother
[2:00:57] a preacher tearing down a fellow
[2:00:59] minister hallelujah
[2:01:06] but we try our best
[2:01:09] sometimes we took they try to put
[2:01:11] feathers colorful feathers so that we
[2:01:14] can look as the bride of Jesus Christ it
[2:01:18] don't work that way
[2:01:22] if you're just forcing yourself into it
[2:01:25] it's not doing you any good but urban
[2:01:30] cultures just withdrawal and form
[2:01:35] it's the blood the life that electrifies
[2:01:40] and sanctifies your life that's right
[2:01:45] whom I thank God for the blood of Jesus
[2:01:50] hallelujah oh look at this I have a few
[2:01:58] slides left look I want you to look at
[2:02:01] this quotation the comforter has been

[2:02:20] people in the Vatican
[2:02:22] these are talking about Baptist
[2:02:24] Methodist and people in the denomination
[2:02:26] when it says enemy it says forgive my
[2:02:29] enemy Lord teach me in my heart
[2:02:32] let me forgive my enemy Oh God I could
[2:02:37] go to them lovely in my heart and was

[2:03:09] spirit me he doesn't it didn't mean
[2:03:10] people outside the church because he
[2:03:14] said teach me so I can wash their feet
[2:03:19] he's talking about people in the church
[2:03:22] right in this assembly people that that
[2:03:25] hold communion with him people that
[2:03:28] fellowship and worship with him people
[2:03:31] that he washes the feet of during
[2:03:35] communion if it washing her spirit was
[2:03:38] Lord helped me to forgive my enemy I
[2:03:43] think of Jesus
[2:03:46] knowing Judas but that was the very
[2:03:48] demon that would betray him
[2:03:54] he washed his feet and wiped it with a
[2:04:00] towel prayed for him just like the rest
[2:04:05] of the disciples oh my goodness everyone
[2:04:09] said Lord give me that heart give me
[2:04:13] that
[2:04:14] hallelujah teach me to to forget my
[2:04:19] enemy hallelujah
[2:04:21] are you listening what if I was talking
[2:04:25] about people that are perceived to be
[2:04:28] enemies in the church
[2:04:32] they're not really your enemies they're
[2:04:37] only perceived to be your enemies I mean
[2:04:41] no Judas was a real enemy he was a devil
[2:04:44] but brother banner was praying for
[2:04:47] people who he's able to wash their feet
[2:04:50] Oh think about it people in his own
[2:04:55] Assembly his friends doesn't
[2:04:58] misunderstand him but he doesn't
[2:05:00] understand hallelujah
[2:05:02] he said God teach me to forgive me and
[2:05:07] me teach me O God to be able to wash
[2:05:10] their feet and love my brothers and
[2:05:12] sisters what was the reason it's not for
[2:05:17] my own sake of God I want to do this I
[2:05:20] will humble myself before them and do
[2:05:22] them service so that they don't listen
[2:05:25] it's not for me it's for them
[2:05:36] there's no greater love than this then a
[2:05:40] man lay down his life for his friends
[2:05:43] John 3:16 for God so loved the world
[2:05:47] that He gave His only begotten Son that
[2:05:50] whosoever believeth in him should not
[2:05:52] perish but have everlasting life Jesus
[2:05:55] fulfilled this case amen
[2:05:58] John 3:16 Jesus fulfilled this but we
[2:06:03] have to fulfill this one first John 3:16
[2:06:07] it's not hard to memorize John 3:16
[2:06:11] first John 3:16
[2:06:15] let's read it hereby perceive we the
[2:06:18] love of God
[2:06:21] because he laid down his life for us
[2:06:26] and we ought to lay down our lives
[2:06:33] for own families for own selves we ought
[2:06:39] to lay down our lives for the Brethren
[2:06:45] you need to do what Jesus did that was
[2:06:53] the ultimate sacrifice Jesus did on the
[2:06:58] cross hallelujah
[2:07:01] he redeemed us I want with I won't read
[2:07:07] that verse but I would read this one
[2:07:11] Township Redemption Alabam said a man as
[2:07:15] a soul and therefore that soul is a part
[2:07:19] of God and even in its fallen state yet
[2:07:23] it's the most greatest specie of all the
[2:07:26] species of the earth is the man
[2:07:29] and then get him in connection with his
[2:07:32] maker he becomes a Superman oh this is
[2:07:38] powerful
[2:07:39] an ordinary man becomes a Superman when
[2:07:44] you get him connected to his maker
[2:07:47] hallelujah
[2:07:48] almost because he's the son of God he
[2:07:51] becomes acquainted with his maker with a
[2:07:54] creator of all things and when that man
[2:07:58] they're acquainted with his maker
[2:07:59] becomes a part of his maker he comes
[2:08:02] back he comes back into fellowship with
[2:08:04] his maker every divine word becomes a
[2:08:08] living reality to him and they believe
[2:08:10] so that's why you you know I think of
[2:08:17] the the tribe people who we work with
[2:08:21] there's a lot of them I can name
[2:08:24] probably about 30 churches tribal
[2:08:28] churches where you have to there's no
[2:08:32] other way to get to the places where
[2:08:33] where they live to the churches that we
[2:08:36] started where they go to church but to
[2:08:39] walk
[2:08:41] 13 hours walking up the mountain you
[2:08:45] have to cross the swamps up the hill
[2:08:51] cats amen
[2:08:54] braved the snakes you know and whatever
[2:09:01] wild animal is out there in the forest
[2:09:03] to reach these people 13 hours
[2:09:07] you have to stop and sleep in a certain
[2:09:09] point and continue on the next day to
[2:09:13] reach these people and when we reach
[2:09:17] these people they don't they hardly have
[2:09:20] clothes they don't even have sufficient
[2:09:24] food they don't have education they
[2:09:27] don't know hygiene
[2:09:30] in the Philippines there called
[2:09:34] marginalized people and I look at that
[2:09:37] word marginalize you know they're some
[2:09:40] kind of people of less importance people
[2:09:45] that the society doesn't benefit from
[2:09:51] they're worthless people in other words
[2:09:54] hallelujah but do you realize that these
[2:09:58] people have souls that were created in
[2:10:03] the image and likeness of God and all
[2:10:07] that's needed to happen is for death to
[2:10:09] be connected to their maker and they
[2:10:12] become Superman
[2:10:13] hallelujah if believing every promise of
[2:10:17] God Amen that's close with this thank
[2:10:24] you for your help brother BAM said
[2:10:29] divine healing and I appreciate many of
[2:10:33] you people are poor people and tonight

[2:10:43] offering on that great day when we stand
[2:10:46] up there at the judgment seat of Christ

[2:10:53] when I after he hear my name called and
[2:10:56] I got to come up and stand stand on the
[2:11:00] tape recording will be played and the
[2:11:02] screen will show it all in some of those
[2:11:05] natives and heathens from other
[2:11:07] countries saying all better Brennan if
[2:11:10] you hadn't have come
[2:11:11] I'd have been lost
[2:11:15] and then God will look down on you and
[2:11:18] say you were the one for attention think
[2:11:25] about it that's great that's better
[2:11:29] banners ministry

[2:11:33] probably at least 8,000 believers there
[2:11:37] 10,000 believers eight to ten thousand
[2:11:39] believers in the Philippines I heard in
[2:11:41] Uganda there was about 28,000 came to
[2:11:45] water baptism in the name of the Lord
[2:11:47] Jesus Christ in Uganda there's a revival
[2:11:51] taking place even in the nation called
[2:11:53] China there are two hundred groups at
[2:11:57] least that believe this message in our
[2:12:01] country hallelujah
[2:12:03] there are a thousand bellissimo met them
[2:12:05] they're little people they're black
[2:12:07] people but there are our bridge ins
[2:12:09] there are the original Filipino people
[2:12:12] hallelujah that don't know their right
[2:12:15] from their left they don't have a
[2:12:18] education they don't even know the basic
[2:12:21] hygiene hallelujah but they have souls
[2:12:25] and they heard the message of grace and
[2:12:32] they received the word and they became
[2:12:36] connected to their maker hallelujah and
[2:12:38] they became Superman hallelujah they
[2:12:41] became a part of the bride of Jesus
[2:12:43] Christ but that David one says
[2:12:47] hallelujah when they call my name when
[2:12:49] my name is called and and and probably
[2:12:54] it's given its reward
[2:12:58] the heathens will say if you hadn't come
[2:13:00] you wouldn't have heard this message it
[2:13:03] would have been lost and God would look
[2:13:06] at you wherever I'm said look at you the
[2:13:09] ones that supported the work
[2:13:12] you're the ones that sent me your doors
[2:13:16] are sent by the random you may have not
[2:13:19] seen and Negrito or an ayah but a symbol
[2:13:23] has met some of them you may not see how
[2:13:25] they look how they dress how they smell
[2:13:28] you don't know I need an idea but praise
[2:13:32] God they are your brothers because they
[2:13:38] heard the word if you see the same
[2:13:41] message that you receive and we want to
[2:13:46] give God all the praise and honor and
[2:13:49] glory or what is doing I don't have the
[2:13:58] energy to go on so please come take the
[2:14:03] service god bless you pray for us
[2:14:06] amen we will be visiting some more
[2:14:10] churches but under 20th August we'll be
[2:14:13] heading back home to continue the work
[2:14:16] of the Lord you are responsible for your
[2:14:20] brothers and sisters you are your
[2:14:23] brothers
[2:14:24] thank you and God bless you
[2:14:37] [Applause]
[2:14:45] have you been challenged you know these
[2:14:50] are we just had read through some of
[2:14:54] these scriptures on Sunday and you know
[2:14:57] when Paul says in Colossians 3 put on
[2:15:01] therefore as the elect of God holy
[2:15:04] bowels of Mercy and that whole phrases
[2:15:08] we were looking at there on Sunday put
[2:15:11] on means sink into sea by being born
[2:15:19] again of the Spirit of God we have an
[2:15:21] access the humility in our heart to be
[2:15:25] able to humble ourselves and sink in to
[2:15:29] this garment of humility boughs of mercy
[2:15:35] forgiveness long-suffering you know just
[2:15:40] as I mentioned the here on Sunday there
[2:15:42] is no way that a person can do this
[2:15:45] without the Holy Ghost because the Holy
[2:15:49] Ghost gives us power to submit ourselves
[2:15:52] you know even in times when we know
[2:15:55] we're dead wrong
[2:15:57] you're with me now even when we know
[2:16:00] we're wrong but yet when there's
[2:16:03] something there on the inside that says
[2:16:06] that's not right there's a strength on
[2:16:09] the inside we can just yield to Jesus
[2:16:12] he's in the ship we just need him to
[2:16:15] step forth amen yield to him and he
[2:16:20] takes - he takes control say brother
[2:16:22] sent me what do you mention this is why
[2:16:24] we need a refilling of the Holy Ghost
[2:16:26] every day of our life because we cannot
[2:16:30] forgive we cannot have humility we
[2:16:32] cannot do any of these things just by
[2:16:35] simple mental recognition we need him
[2:16:39] when we see something in the word like
[2:16:41] what came tonight to us and how God
[2:16:43] would speak so plainly though the
[2:16:45] reality when the word comes and
[2:16:47] challenges our heart it should bring us
[2:16:49] the place to say lord I need more of you
[2:16:53] I see where I am and I see where I need
[2:16:56] to be I need more of you and he's the
[2:17:00] one the supernatural God the Living God
[2:17:03] the power of the Resurrection to bring
[2:17:05] us from where we are to where we need to
[2:17:08] be
[2:17:09] you know I thought about this with the
[2:17:12] with what was spoken here tonight and no
[2:17:16] matter what might be that we you have
[2:17:19] been through or I have been through
[2:17:21] here's where it comes down the things
[2:17:23] that brother Branham was mentioning here
[2:17:25] and through the scriptures this is the
[2:17:28] thing that you can we can really look at
[2:17:30] is it our desire to see this fulfilled
[2:17:35] in our life it's not about what our
[2:17:39] feelings are right now there's not one
[2:17:43] person in here who says I enjoy being
[2:17:47] wronged not one of us
[2:17:49] we're not being honest we don't we don't
[2:17:52] we don't look at and say oh I don't
[2:17:53] bother me what people think you're lying
[2:17:55] it does bother us
[2:17:57] it matters it's the reason we say that
[2:18:00] many times is because of pride we get
[2:18:03] into a place of saying well I'll just
[2:18:05] say this so it don't seem so bad the
[2:18:07] reality is if we can just be honest with
[2:18:10] God because just like we like somebody
[2:18:12] to say hey that was wonderful you did a
[2:18:15] good job just as much as that encourages
[2:18:18] us the same thing the other when someone
[2:18:20] says that was terrible
[2:18:26] we need we need the grace of God and I
[2:18:31] would say it like this you know as the
[2:18:33] Holy Spirit brought it here tonight in
[2:18:35] Galatians 6 bear you one another's
[2:18:38] burdens you know that's the first thing
[2:18:40] that that brother branham he used that
[2:18:42] scripture through the hebrew series
[2:18:44] you're aware of it he used that
[2:18:46] scripture when we go to one another and
[2:18:48] we go to one another in Christian love
[2:18:50] and we're long-suffering with a brother
[2:18:52] or sister and then brother Brown will
[2:18:55] use that in Galatians 6 if that brother
[2:18:57] or sister will not heed to that
[2:18:59] correction then that's when we go to
[2:19:03] matthew 16 are you with me
[2:19:06] that's when because they won't heed to
[2:19:09] the love of god that's reaching out to
[2:19:11] try to correct them but oh my how where
[2:19:16] our heart as a believer it reaches out
[2:19:18] to one another
[2:19:19] i'll tell you my desire is not to
[2:19:21] correct people is that your desire y'all
[2:19:26] with me i know i know it's it's we've
[2:19:29] been here some time but it's been good
[2:19:31] ain't it i don't get joy out of
[2:19:34] correcting people matter of fact you
[2:19:37] know there's things when i sit around
[2:19:38] with brothers or different ones at the
[2:19:40] table there might be something said
[2:19:42] that's a little bit wrong and maybe they
[2:19:44] didn't finish this just right but let's
[2:19:46] go on and have fellowship amen let's go
[2:19:50] on I'm not there to try to censor
[2:19:52] everything that one another saying you
[2:19:54] didn't finish that quote just right you
[2:19:56] didn't finish that scripture just right
[2:19:57] but we're there to exalt the name of the
[2:20:00] Lord Jesus Christ I believe one thing if
[2:20:02] we can see one another's hearts say God
[2:20:04] help me to know the heart of one another
[2:20:08] then we can have a little bit more
[2:20:10] long-suffering amen don't you love the
[2:20:13] Lord amen I just tonight I think this
[2:20:16] would be good in this moment right here
[2:20:19] I'd say Lord let this be fulfilled in my
[2:20:22] life
[2:20:23] let it be fulfilled in my life to all
[2:20:26] men
[2:20:27] you know God allows situations to come
[2:20:29] up when it says forgive one another's as
[2:20:31] Christ as God for Christ's sake has
[2:20:34] forgiven us we say Amen to the word haw
[2:20:36] amen
[2:20:37] well God has to allow situations to come
[2:20:39] up to say here's the practice here's the
[2:20:44] practice say lord help me Lord Jesus
[2:20:48] Lord I need more of you Lord I need more
[2:20:52] of you
[2:20:53] amen amen how many would say Lord I want
[2:20:57] a trip to Calvary tonight I want more of
[2:21:02] the love of God poured out in my
[2:21:03] solenoid amen
