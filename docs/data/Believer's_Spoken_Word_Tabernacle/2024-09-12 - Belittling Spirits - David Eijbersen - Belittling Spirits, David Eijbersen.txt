appreciate our pastor too amen and Brother David certainly this is another new song we're going to try to do tonight amen I'm here Lord to present myself to you also want to say it's good to have brother Paula Fontaine with us in the service tonight amen amen he sing these songs probably better you can sing it better than me brother amen let's just sing the song to the Lord It's brother Samuel comes me help me there I am here Lord to present myself to you and I know there's nothing more that I can do oh yes Jesus will you wash me and tress me in your rightousness until you find me through I'll still come and present myself to you sing that real softly now make it a prayer rer I am here Lord to present myself to you that's what I want to do tonight and I no there's nothing more that I can do will you wash me and dress me in your rightousness until you're finally through Lord I'll still come and present myself to you let's make it a prayer tonight I here I am here Lord to present myself to you and I know there's nothing more that I can do will you wash me and dress me in your rightousness until you're find through Lord I'll still come and present myself to amen so good to be in the house of the Lord isn't it it's good to be gathered together amen it's good to have uh Brother David Iverson here with us all the way from Belgium and uh comes from Nazareth Belgium and so those of us that were at the men's meeting we already had a little foraste and then I had a foraste before that men's meeting and uh I was so thankful that Brother David was able to uh see it in his schedule to come by here I I know you're going to be blessed and uh we just so appreciate all the all the variety of God's gifts because every gift that God has given he knows what you and I would have need of and it's always him but it's him coming through a multifaceted channel to minister to our lives and and I just so love and appreciate all the different approaches because when it's all said and done we walk away with seeing the Lord Jesus and our lives being challenged and being encouraged in the things of God and I believe tonight that even though that this wasn't Al together maybe planned out until about a month ago when everything brother Paul and I we had kind of got it together um but I believe it was in God's mind before the found foundation of the world I believe that cuz nothing is by chance or by accident with God so we just we just want to just come to that place and say Lord what you have for this moment I want to be ready for this moment I I don't know what tomorrow holds but you do and he holds tomorrow I want my life to be in his hands right now because God knows right now what he'll deliver is what I'll need for tomorrow God's always on time isn't he amen so I'm just going to invite Brother David and then you know I'm not going to let brother Paul Escape without singing so I think we'll do it like this it's such a wonderful atmosphere and brother Paul would only add to that but brother Paul after the service you see how the service goes and I want you just to sing in the after service how the Lord would lead you so aren't you thankful for brother Paul love brother Paul so much Brother Paul's been such a such a blessing and an inspiration to my life and and uh and so we just are so thankful amen for brother Paul for you to be here tonight and bring Brother David amen amen we're ready for the word of the Lord amen amen could we sing this one more time I am here Lord to present myself to [Music] you and I I know there's nothing more that I can do will you wash me and dress me in [Music] [Music] your [Music] I believe that's what we've come here for tonight to present ourselves before the Lord Jesus Christ amen you you may be seated just for a minute before we read the word of God and uh I'm so thankful to be with with you here and uh as Brother Sam said I bring you greetings from Nazareth in Belgium so uh if you wonder if anything good can come from [Laughter] [Applause] Nazareth I would say come and see amen I pray that that question may be answered tonight after the service but I believe so brother and so I'm so thankful for the invitation Brother Sam and uh we're so glad to be here and uh God has his program and we want just want to be obedient and following the leadership of the Holy Spirit and uh I sure bring you greetings from our congregation and back home in Belgium overseas we've had marvelous time at the men's meetings and uh I can tell you your pastor was really fired up like uh a house on fire on a windy day and uh he's got the same disease we all have you know when the Holy Spirit gets a hold of you and I so enjoyed Brother Sam and all the brothers and it was just a pleasure and an honor to be part of the team and uh We've also had him in in Belgium and it was a real blessing to many people all of us and we're so glad to make new friends and I'm so glad to be here tonight just to see Brother Sam in his natural habitat so to say and uh so good to see you all tonight I know you've been working and uh maybe school and the things uh to come out to listen to the word of God and I believe God has something for us in store amen and so uh may the Lord bless you all and uh we'll stand for the reading of the word and uh if you will forgive my Flemish accent but uh we'll we'll try to bring our Point AC cross tonight and uh let's go to the Bible to the book of uh hagi hagi chapter 2 verse one we'll read a few verses and then we'll go into the word tonight in the seventh month in the 1 and 20th day of the month came the word of the Lord by the prophet Hagi saying speak now to zerubabel the son of shaltiel governor of Judah and to Joshua the son of josec the high priest and to the residue of the people saying who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory and how do you see it now is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing yet now be strong o zerubabel sayeth the Lord and be strong oh Joshua son of josec the high priest and be strong all ye people of the land sayeth the Lord and work for I Am with You sayeth the Lord of hosts according to the word that I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt so my spirit remaineth among you amen fear ye not do you believe that tonight amen for thus sayeth the Lord of hosts yet once it is a little while and I will shake the heavens and the earth and the Sea and the dry land and I will shake the Nations and the desire of all Nations shall shall come and I will fill this house with Glory sayeth the Lord of hosts Hallelujah the silver is mine and the gold is mine saith the Lord of hosts the glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former sayith the Lord of hosts and in this place will I give peace sayeth the Lord of hosts amen let's just take another scripture from the New Testament first 1 John 4 verse 1 to 4 1 John 4 do you love the the Lord this evening you love the word of God amen amen beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world hereby know the spirit of God every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God and every spirit that confessed not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God and this is that Spirit of the Antichrist that Spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world ye are of God little children and have over overcome them past T am past T am Hallelujah because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world Amen let's just bow our heads before you sit down dear heavenly father I thank you Father it's I count it as a privilege to be standing here in the Pulpit of my precious friend Brother Sam Browning Lord and I pray that you will bless this service tonight tonight bless every hearer even the people that might be following on the Internet or later archive Lord we know your Holy Spirit Knows No Time father and your word is always fresh and new Lord I pray Lord that may I may be able to step aside and that the Holy Spirit May minister to what you want to tell to this church Lord father I don't know what is in the hearts of the people but you do father and I pray that you will direct my thoughts and Lord that you will anoint my lips to speak and father not just my lips but every heart here tonight Lord that we may become better Christians Lord we may live closer to you father we humbly pray if there's anything wrong in my life in our lives Lord that you will forgive us Lord and as we sang the songs Lord that we may be available to you Lord and cleanse us Lord in jesus' Name Lord and father that your Holy Spirit may have full Liberty tonight and that you may receive the honor and the glory in jesus' name we ask it amen and amen just greet your brother and sister before you sit down and God bless you tonight in the presence of the Lord well it's good to be in the church on on a Thursday night yes sir hallelujah how many are happy to be here amen David said I was glad when they said unto me let's go into the house of the Lord and even if you're not May the joy of the Lord be restored to us amen hallelujah well I would like to speak tonight uh on a subject that uh the Lord really put upon my heart strongly and uh as a title I would give it the title belittling Spirits belittling Spirits we've just read in the Bible that where John uh encourages us and he uh he uh instructs us not to believe any Spirit or every Spirit but that we have to try the spirits whether they are of God so I believe may the Lord help us tonight that we do that for a moment I believe this is not just Thursday night but every day of Our Lives amen and I believe God has given us the spirit of discernment and it it comes by knowing who Christ is and knowing what the word is knowing the message of the hour and knowing if anyone says anything different we can discern the spirits knowing if anyone has a different attitude we can discern the spirit that is behind it that's right Hallelujah so we see in our opening scripture in hay and um I'm trying to paraphrase and I don't want to keep you too long tonight but just speak from my heart if if you will allow but we see here that God is actually commissioning uh the Church of that day to rebuild the Temple and he is calling the high priest he's calling the governor and he's calling everybody and he's actually launching a challenge and he says who is left among you that saw this house in her first Glory we could say it maybe about this church who has seen the the humble beginnings of this church and all the Glorious moments we've had before all the revivals and the Holy Spirit coming down blessing the meetings so I think it's a question that's appropriate for every church and even for us here tonight who is left that saw the original church and and he says how do you see it now so the Lord is asking those questions who who are the old- that saw the beginning and and we see as as we look around on on a a global scale that uh in the message there is a transition coming that the Pioneers are just little by little dying out and leaving the scene and and if we're not careful we're looking back and the Lord asks us the question who was there when the Pioneers were here who was there when brother Bram was still here we see the last the last Witnesses leaving the scene and now he has the second question how do you see it now how do you look at the message tonight how do you look at your own pastor this church and he says is it not in your eyes the third question in in comparison as of of it as nothing in other words you're looking to all the Glorious times but you look to today and it looks small or Nothing in Your Eyes that's good that's good listen this is not the eyes of God this is he's clearly saying in your eyes that's good yes sir and he's saying right away and he's dealing with the discouragement uh he's dealing with those belittling spirits that said well God did the Miracles and the signs and God did the revivals and the Holy Spirit came down and we tend to speak about the past in in such a way with some kind of nostalgy as if God wasn't doing the same thing as if God has stopped somewhere along the road but he's still the same tonight Hallelujah so he's asking us tonight how do you look at this church how do you even look at the message how do you look at the prophet how do you look at the ministers is it as nothing but he's saying and and we see the Lord by asking those questions he's actually dealing with something that is in the minds of the people there's a spirit of discouragement you know what I grew up under leadership older brothers and my grandfather who founded the church and then later on another older brother I was a co-pastor I've been through many things and I've seen my own church where I grew up as a child I've seen people become so discouraged and and and sometimes look back and those were the days if we're not careful Brothers sister we we tend to look back to the past and God is always advancing you never you never saw the pillar of fire in the desert going in the opposite direction let let's let's go back to Egypt no it was those belittling spirits that said well the garlic putts of Egypt were better but let me tell you this is getting better and better all the time [Applause] Hallelujah the harder we have to fight the better the the sweeter the victory but the Lord is dealing with the discouragement those spirits in the hearts of the people of Israel and listen you can read the chapters it's just two or three chapters it's a and and they are looking at the plans that God has given listen the first that Temple of of Solomon that Mighty Temple with all the gold and and and you know the the carim in in the in the curtains and all the Splender and the glory you and the Thousand and the tens of thousands of animals that Solomon sacrificed and the priests couldn't even Minister because The Cloud of Glory was there and and and here is the temple destroyed because Israel had left the Lord and now the Lord is saying I'm going to rebuild the Temple and they look back to all the glory of Solon and they couldn't simply believe that God was going to do something greater than ever before and and now God is laying out the plans and and they see compared to the Temple of Solomon that the temple is much smaller in size that it it looks less glorious but the Lord is here I I always say the best weapon here is the people discouraged the best weapon against discouragement is to take courage so so after asking this question and here they're looking but this is maybe not not even a third of the Temple of Solomon we don't even have gold and the Lord is saying mine is the silver mine is the gold I will provide the finances how are we going to do this God will provide for this church not just spiritually but financially he will take care of his work hallelujah amen he's saying be strong verse four ohub sayeth the Lord and be strong oh Joshua son of josu the high priest and be strong all ye people of the land this is not just the ministry this is not just the leaders but it's for every one of us tonight Hallelujah all the people of the land from the youngest child in the church till the oldest brother and sister they might not even be attending church anymore but they're still part of the church and the Lord is saying be strong be strong little children be be strong young people be strong older ones Hallelujah for I Am With You sayith the Lord of host according to my Covenant when you came out of Egypt so my spirit remaineth among you Hallelujah I'm still here with my Holy Spirit I've always been here even when you didn't feel it or see it I've always been here hallelujah amen I've never left you even even when people left the church even when you got disappointed even in the hard times have always been with you Hallelujah the Holy Spirit has always been with you brother sister don't you fear Hallelujah and now God says I will shake the heavens I will shake the Earth the Sea and the dry land if this isn't a picture of today I will shake American politics I will shake Belgian politics European politics you know no country on earth is saved from this I will shake all the nations he says but I will fill this house hallelujah hallelujah I'm going to fill this house with glory amen we didn't deserve it but I'll tell you why it's very simple it's built upon the word of God hallelujah Heaven and Earth May will pass away but my word will never pass away this house is built on the word of God this house is built thus sayith the Lord and it cannot be shaken hallelujah hallelujah I will fill this house with glory Lord some people might say oh let the glory be back like in those days let me tell you he's saying the glory of this L house Hallelujah let me repeat it the glory of this L house this little structure that you're looking on and you you you think it's smaller in size you think it's less glorious this latter house this Glory shall be greater than the former Hallelujah so God is dealing directly with that those spirits of belittlement in the people's mind so good Hallelujah you can read it in the chapter he's saying you know you've built your nice houses you winded the forest you get out the wooden planks but my house is laying desolate Hallelujah God saying there's there's some material left to build this church Jesus said those words I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against them you're still here tonight every Gate of Hell is against you but you're the evidence tonight on a Thursday night that they cannot Prevail against you Hallelujah but some have to have come through deep trials some had to had to come and leave their family for this message that's right some have come through through the the deepest Trials of sickness and hardships but you're still here Paul speaks about it in the New Testament about our vile bodies and that word vile means the body of humiliation we have to go through those things but let me tell you tonight let me tell it against Satan and every demon Spirit you may try us you may make us sick you may prove us and all those things but one day we're come coming out of the Grave one day our bodies will be changed God promised us a Rapture and he says the glory of this latter house will be greater than the first oh you think it's something when the Holy Ghost struck your soul let me tell you the glory of this L house Hallelujah every cell of your body is going to be changed so don't let Satan belittle you my brother my sister you know that's what he always did if you are the Son of God change these stones into bread if you are the Son of God jump from the Pinnacle of the temple do something Supernatural and listen it was even so to say in the word of God but we have a prophet that's told us the Bride As thus sayith the Lord or she keeps quiet we we don't have to clown for the enemy that's right amen but he asked that question every time if you are the Son of God that's the question he is asking you day and night if you are a daughter of God you wouldn't have done this if you are a Son of God you wouldn't be in that place let me tell you that's the very evidence that God is inside of you hallelujah hallelujah if you didn't have God inside of you he wouldn't fight you the way he does hallelujah but you know those Spirits try to kill the fight in you belittling you saying you have no power you have no power against cancer you cannot do anything against depression and it's true but let me tell you my Lord my God hallelujah his glory it's not my glory His Glory Hallelujah can make every Cancer disappear his glory can heal those who are wounded in their body and in their mind Hallelujah Hallelujah Lord but you see God created men in his own image and we see what happened in the Garden of Eden Satan try to mingle animal life here is the vine uh theine life God made man in his own image but now we see Satan trying to belittle humanity and mixing animal life into the human race so his strategy from the beginning was to belittle the human race and you can I'm sorry I I if I hope I can just speak from my heart but you you have the quote where the Prophet says and Satan has had a marvelous success in in carrying out his threats right so so we are dealing with a real enemy don't underestimate your enemy right right that's right and we're saying that to Satan also don't under underestimate your enemy amen don't underestimate the sons and the daughters of God hallelujah GL and we see the way that Jesus conquered everyone of those three major trials in the desert was it is written yes amen it was not even a supernatural performance something we can show and oh he could have said the spirit of God is he could have let Fire come down from heaven but you know he just said it is written Hallelujah right yeah and finally when when he tempted him to jump off the mountain he says it is written Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God and Satan left him see the Bible says if you resist him he will flee from you that's right Hallelujah we see the same in the days of Moses here they are standing in front of the promised land like and and here the the 12 Spies come back and they are carrying those huge grape from the valley of escol and they're coming with the very evidence that what Moses what what the Lord spoke through Moses was the truth and here they're standing and and Caleb Still the people like they were saying yeah but the people are strong and they that dwell in the land and the cities are walled it's all true true you might say well the doctor has made this diagnosis and it's all true and and and the walls are very great and we saw the children of anoch there and Caleb Still the people before Moses and he says let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it here is a man and and the Bible says he had a different Spirit than all the rest Hallelujah Lord help us to be like Caleb even if people try to belittle what God is doing let some men stand up and say we are able to overcome we are well able to possess the land Hallelujah yes but the man that went up with him said we are not able to go up against the people do you see that Spirit of belittlement had grab taken a hold of those 10 spies so badly that they actually spoke exactly the opposite of what God spoke through Moses he had spoken every place that your foot will go on as your possession I have given to you there will there will be no man able to withstand you all the days of your life and here they're saying we cannot do it they are stronger than us we are not able to go and they brought an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of of Israel saying the land through which we have gone to search it listen closely and now at first they're saying it's a there is Walled cities the people are strong it sounds quite rational they're just looking at the thing but now it's getting worse the spirit is gripping them and he says we've gone through the land this is the same guys maybe the that that big big grave hanging on a staff is still on their shoulders they they still feel the weight and of the evidence that the Lord has given like brother sister God has given us so much evidence that it is a good land flowing with milk and honey God has given us so much Holy Ghost evidence that it is a good land Hallelujah but here are the people standing and and the weight of that grape on the should shoulder and and he says well the land we they say we've gone to search it and it is a land that listen closely it goes beyond the reasoning now Beyond IR rational it becomes very irrational it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof where can you read it in the Bible like they're actually saying they're carnivors they eat each other but they you know they try to exaggerate and they say how bad it is and oh God help us that we never become negative let let our testimony never never be negative and they say they're not just eating the inhabitants but all the people that we saw it are men of great stature and we saw the Giants sons of anoch with come which come from the Giants and listen closely and we were in our own side this is the problem how do you look at yourself tonight how do we look at ourselves that's if we look with our own eyes it might be good it might be bad but I say Lord help us to look through your eyes and we were in our own side as grasshoppers right another exaggeration they're not just carnivors but we are like Grasshoppers and there the Giants are and so we were in their side I'm wondering did any one of those 10 spies go and interview one of the sons of anoch so now they're speaking for the enemy and they haven't listen they're spies so they were not seen so they're actually lying they as if they could discern the thoughts of the enemy you can actually listen you can read the story of Rahab that it was exactly the opposite rightly right she said the fear the the Lord has gone before you here is RAB and the two spies are coming and the city was trembling already so it was a wrong discernment I say Lord help us to discern spirits and as I say oh I feel at home here tonight hallelujah praise the lord it's just like a Wednesday night at home th Thursday night here praise the Lord always tell the church back home if you want to exercise discernment start with your own mind see people want to point their fingers and to other churches and other brothers and sisters start with your own mind and I'm saying never stop don't you ever think you have arrived everyday this is the most deceiving time and that counts for all of us preachers and Lady likewise yes Hallelujah prise the Lord maybe we could call it autod discerners discern yourself a to discern you know David had David had that maturity he said Lord search me and try me try my heart and my Reigns see if there's any wicked way and bring me back on the right way help us Lord Jesus but they're saying we look in our eyes and and and in their eyes like grasshoppers sometimes we feel like this let me tell you if you feel like this it's a belittling spirit and let me tell you very straightforward it's a demon Spirit you know if Satan cannot lure you into sin like like smoking and drinking and and drugs or or sexual sin he will come another way more subtle with a belittling spirit let us say it like this well I believe the prophet said it I believe the word has said it but somehow I don't think it's for me you're speaking the mind of the enemy and it's a lie because the the reality is Satan is trembling he's trembling here is the prophet he says why did Jesus use the word in the wilderness Hallelujah so that the weakest believer among us can do the same thing maybe you cannot call fire from heaven maybe you cannot do all the grow great things but every one of us here tonight we can believe the word and say Satan it is written the weakest believer if he goes on his knees or her knees all hell is trembling Hallelujah if you start to pray all hell is trembling all of Jericho is trembling but here we see Israel going around the city walking and and they're not saying anything 6 days we know the story but there on the walls are are are the people remember God has discerned already that they're full of fear right right aren't we glad that we have a message that exposes the enemy that reveals the works of Satan amen and here they're marching and here are the soldiers and they are belittling the people they're standing on the high walls they feel so fortified but in the in inside of them their hearts are full of fear amen hallelujah and listen the people didn't do anything spectacular just walk with the word hallelujah six six days in the week it's not you not by might not by power but by my spirit it's not you who's who's going to produce the miracle it's mine the Lord says just walk with the Lord but I wish I could do signs and miracles just walk with the Lord just follow the ark just follow the word of God just do what the prophet tells you to do and let me tell you when it's time to shout the holy spirit will tell you Hallelujah listen not even Joshua not even the priest had to say it's time to shout God said now it's time to shout hallelujah good Hallelujah so don't let the enemy belittle you Satan is watching over those big walls from Hell let me tell you the smallest child in this church can conquer every enemy hallelujah hallelujah look at David versus Goliath wow and he's coming there here is a little Shepherd boy and the prophet says a little Ruddy boy Ruddy old Ruddy looking boy and and here is elop and his anger was kindled and he says against David and he says why did you come here why CEST thou hither why did you leave where did you leave the sheep in the wilderness you shouldn't be here in the battle you should be there in kindergarten just just petting petting the sheeps you know this is for Real Men this is for preachers only oh my Hallelujah reminds me of shamgar he wasn't a preacher he was just a common believer one day he had enough of the belittlement Hallelujah Hallelujah he said I'm tired of letting the devil come tear down all that are buil up over this time and with a simple Ox goat he defeated 600 devil Powers Oh Sister Sister you in the kitchen there you can defeat any enemy you don't have to be a minister God has given you the promise just take it whatever you get can get in your hand fight with it don't let the devil be Bel you belittle you you might say I never had an education let me tell you you're sitting under the teachings of the greatest teacher of all times the holy spirit will guide you in all the truth hallelujah there's no school there's no University hallelujah oh my you're making that too easy tonight to preach good brother Hallelujah I'm really enjoying this Brother s I hope you too Hallelujah but now his his older brother and I want you to notice this is in the same church so this is now not the enemy belittling but now it's a brother or a sister oh my it's getting a little bit more quiet [Laughter] now see Paul had to deal with that in the New Testament and he spoke to he he took time wrers in Timothy and he says let no man despise you right let no man belittle you because of your age I know what it's like to be young minister or what it's like to have been let me say it like this gray hair is coming but I don't want to go there but now alup is saying alup is saying what are you coming to do didn't weren't you supposed to tend to the sheep and and he says now Mr aliab has the gift of discernment he says I Know Thy Pride right we know it's wrong discernment but he's still saying it belittling Spirits I Know Thy pride and the naughtiness of thine heart naughty little boy David and you have that thou are come that thou might see the battle this so he's saying you're you're just a curious naughty Pride little boy you know what little David could have gone home sucking his thumb crying going back to Daddy like Daddy you you commissioned me and they didn't believe me but daddy already sent them out because he knew he would accomplish the mission right Hallelujah you know let us preachers handle handle the thing we can handle it you know and what if the Holy Spirit wants to use a simple brother that never will preach one sermon say Lord keep us humble and David said what have I now done is there not a cause and he turned from him to worth another listen closely it was not done yet this was like if democracy would be counting he would be voted out and he spake after the same matter and the people answered them again after the former matter the people said the same thing as aliab you little naughty curious boy go back back to the Sheep you know they would have voted him out completely if they would have a pastorial vote he wouldn't make it he wouldn't even have been a candidate listen this is me this is you but God chose you before the foundation of the world Hallelujah aren't you glad for that tonight thank and these was the words were were heard with d which David spoke and they were rehearsed before Saul and he sent for him now everybody's talking here is this little guy we are a serious we have one of the greatest battle in the church we've ever had and here is this little guy listen I've got a few good quotes here to share with you I'm warning you it's very good he says here in the great warrior David and when he met Goliath Goliath looked at him and laughed and he said why am I a dog you're coming to meet me like that you little old Ruddy looking boy here he goes again his own Brothers have just given him all the encourage encouragement they had right right and you know young people need encouragement amen but all the people also need it every one of us need it but here is nobody but David is going straight ahead here is the enemy here the belittlement starts again am I a dog that you come with me he says here he was Ruddy little you know what Saul called him who is this Stripling I asked brother Paul on the road here what is a Stripling is apparently it's a young man who who is this young man here this young lad where Paul said who is that stripping out here just an old old kid like little old looking fellow probably shoulder stooped over and here he come with his little sling but he knowed God that's the main thing he was a Believer he was elected Hallelujah I'm talking about you tonight he was called he was anointed he was placed Hallelujah well brother renam I wasn't called to be a preacher you might be called to be a housewife Hallelujah but you got your position in Christ Jesus by the Holy Ghost come on sisters Hallelujah you're just as much David as the rest of them was three kinds of Believers he said when that uncircumcised Philistine cursed him in the name of his God he said am I a dog a little bitty run runt of a kid come out of like that I don't know what a run is but I guess it's the same thing he says I'll pick you up on the end of my spear I'll hang you up there in the tree and let the birds pick your flesh spirits of belittlement do do you fight the same fight I fight is is that the voices you hear day and night Satan coming in your mind if you are the Son of God I'm going to do this to you that is so good yes and here is this and he says oh my what a horrible fellow he was David said you meet me with a sword and a spear and with an armor you meet me in the name of the Philistines but I meet you Hallelujah without a sword without a spear without armor I meet you in the name of the Lord God of Israel there you are that's a Believer he says that's his forth that's his shield that's his defense amen that should be the church's defense any believer that's his defense no matter what takes place what the world says anything else your defense is the Lord God of Israel words works is Faith expressed 65 and a little David standing there with a little piece of leather goat skin and or sheep skin with two pieces string tied to it but it was revealed to him Revelation struck him amen amen amen he said the god that took me out of the paws of the bear amen now he's looking back to his past victories you know the best way to withstand those spirits of belittlement is go back to your testimonies that's right go back to what the Lord has already done for you you that's right Hallelujah sir Hallelujah he says the same God that took me out of Paws of the lion he how much more will he deliver this uncircumcised uncircumcised Philistine in my hand amen yes his brothers way more able to do it Hallelujah there's people that are way more able to do it but God chose you head Soul Head and Shoulders above the Army but you see it wasn't revealed to them we're not any better than people out there in the denominations right we're not even better than the people out in the street and sin Hallelujah but God gave you and I a revelation am Hallelujah here it is they believed it could be done they believed that God could do it but it wasn't revealed to them amen see you can even come to the point where you know it can be done God can do it but it has to be revealed to you personally right so many people say well I believe what the prophet says but you have to you need a personal revelation I believe what Mom and Dad said but you need a personal revelation I believe what Brother Sam preaches well but you still need a personal revelation amen yeah but it's for everyone else in the church I'm not such a good believer you know what you're speaking the language of the [Music] devil you are a good believer God only has good Believers Hallelujah Lord they believed it could be done believed that God could do it but it wasn't revealed to them it was revealed to David so here is the difference right there if it's absolutely revealed to you that God is going to heal you you're going to get it yes sir that sounds awful simple doesn't it but it is awful simple amen you're going to get it he I don't care what is wrong with you I'm still quoting what the odds it may be worse than David and Goliath Hallelujah I believe somebody needs that tonight he says notice when it's revealed David become Fearless Hallelujah Lord show it to us tonight Hallelujah reveal it to us that it's not for anyone else but it's for me he said today I'll cut your head off that's our God by grace in that crucial moment when decisions had to be made that same God that produced The Grace in that day and and dropped that seed of faith in that little Hunchback looking boy seeing his heart the same God at this in this crucial moment and he says could take the woman from the wheelchair the man he says with the heart trouble so now discernment starts I'm not a prophet I cannot discern but let me tell you the discerner is here no matter what your situation is he is he's saying to you I'm the same God that's right don't you look through those Giants tonight brother sister notice the Giant on the other side didn't believe it neither will the cancer he laughed and he said am I a dog that you sent this kid here to fight me he said I'll pick you up at the end of my Spear and let the birds eat your flesh why he had everything for his side Goliath but you see that didn't sh Shake David at all why it was revealed to him am am he had a faith in what he was doing he know he know he was going to do it and he did it it is because that it was revealed to him and he knowed where he was standing and if God would just spoke that right down in your heart tonight said you're not going to be laying in that bed you're not going to be sitting in that chair you're going to be well amen he says there couldn't be anything change your mind in it but until that's happened listen closely we're not done here yet every preacher in the world could pray I don't say it wouldn't help you it would it would encourage you right but he says see the healing power is in you Hallelujah he says it here it don't come from the preacher it comes to you by Revelation amen by faith not by might not by power but by my spirit sayeth the Lord he says here again in the greatest battle ever fought Satan following you all along that great big kingly Priestly Goliad trying to scare deliver out of you but he says you're fortified amen with the gospel the word of Truth around your Lo preacher that's what it is helmet of salvation Shield of faith and a sword waving in your hand Satan I'm coming to meet you you meet me in the name of Science and culture organization this that or the other but I meet you in the name of the Lord God of Israel I'm coming after you give way even death itself cannot stay there chop a hole right through it say Lord help us tonight to chop some holes Hallelujah through those lineages of spirits that try to belittle you yes the Lord hallelujah you see Satan is always trying to discredit the word of God he's always tried to depreciate the word of God to dishonor everyone that re and and it's not just I'm not just speaking about the word of God here the Bible but the word of God that is inside you my brother he's always there to belittle it if you are the Son of God if you are a daughter of God then you wouldn't do this that's that's his his strategy in the Garden of Eden did God really say it and he's still the same but Jesus showed it in and coming in a human flesh that it could be conquered in a very simple and Powerful way it is written that's right yes I say Lord tonight if there's somebody in a slave mentality is there some somebody in a cage mentality it is the result of listening to Satan's preaching right those spirits that try to belittle you to the ground as if you're nothing let me tell you you're created in the image of God himself in his likeness Hallelujah your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit hallelujah it's not a cage for demon spirit it's not a cage for unclean Birds your body is a temple of the holy [Music] spirit so I'm saying let us not allow the enemy to despise what is inside of us let's not allow Satan to despise the Lord God the holy spirit that lives inside you it's not even yourself God lives inside of you Hallelujah he says here in what went you out to see he says you can be too humble you can get so humble until the devil would make a puppet out of you isn't that something you know the devil can come with false humility well it's for everybody else but I'm not there yet you know well well we I believe those things but maybe it's not for me see we can get so humble and the devil just kicks you around see he says Jesus was uh humble enough to wash the disciples the disciples feet he was forgiven enough to pray for those who drove the spikes into his hands but he was also man enough to Plate robes and run the money changers out of the house Amen Let us be like Daddy Let the sons and the daughters be like Daddy Hallelujah that lamb nature and the lion nature that we know that when to be a lamb and when to be a [Applause] lion Hallelujah you you can read it in questions and answers 54 that brother random public and the pulpit is saying he was correcting brother nville and he says I don't want to hurt his feelings there in the in the Tabernacle but he says brother naville is so so humble but sometimes he a little bit too humble he doesn't want to say it ride out directly and say Lord help us as pastors amen that we're not coming in the name of humility and that we're shering our responsibilities but that we can really lay there and say this is right this is wrong but sometimes as pastors that is instilled in our nature as pastors we don't want conflict we don't want to hurt people's feelings and and and you know he he's speaking about that there in that same message in the law having a shadow he says and and and that he could discern that brother Neville thought that this is Brother Bill's Tabernacle brother brenham's Tabernacle so he was he didn't have the freedom to move he says and brother venam says very clearly it is God's Tabernacle Hallelujah this is God's house this is God's Tabernacle and he it says he's the shepherd put in full charge so he's saying brother Neville you have to take your full Liberty right Hallelujah Lord help us to not pull any punches so it doesn't matter our age our background doesn't matter our status in society Satan will always try to belittle you he will say with this words you're too dot dot dot you're too young you're too old you're too experienced you're too inexperienced you're too nervous you're too calm you know it's using anything anything even if it's completely the opposite you're too young you're too old that's good I always wonder about those who want a job and then they get as a reason you're not experienced enough imagine you're going for a first job how can I ever get experienced right but he's telling you that you come you want to do something for the Lord You're not experienced enough well get into it jump into it it's a a good experience wonder you're too simple you're too educated you know this is not the moment wait till later and then the next time he says well you've had your moment but it's pasted you know what he's he's he's trying to belittle you it's always something behind or in front of you but what about today I'm going to tell you what about today 1 John 3:2 beloved but now are we the sons of God hallelujah now are you the daughters of God now are you Victorious everything that God was he poured into Christ everything that Christ was he poured into the church that's power powerful Hallelujah I'm skipping a whole lot of things here hallelujah he says here what he says here in questions and answers this is one of my favorites uh before we close here he says isn't that just the the way the people get today let God just bless a fellow and put a little confidence in him and he gets to be a no it all he's got to start an organization or something that's different why are thou fallen from from Heaven oh Lucifer that's strong language yes it is he says God has a hard time to cry trying to get somebody that he can deal with that will stay humble and meek and stay in the place until God calls him to do something right that we can stay there just do nothing and I'm not meaning you know being passive but just waiting on the Lord till he speaks so God God has a hard time to stay somebody can stay in that place till God calls him to do something you believe that he says a man that God can bless and he will still keep himself a man not be an angel or a God and as soon man as man gets blessed and has a little something given to him he wants to become a God he wants to become an angel he wants to become some great person he says what I do Me Mine when you hear that language he says that's the wrong attitude God is hunting for somebody who he could bless and pour out the blessings and the more He blesses the little the man will become see the belittlement of Satan has nothing to do with humility the the Bible says if you abase yourself you shall be exalted he that humbles himself shall be exalted but he that exalteth himself shall be a based he ISS you're in God's covenant with Abraham and his seed Jesus constantly said fear not fear not I am he that was dead and live alive forever more fear not fear not it's it's like we started out in the book of Hagi he's saying don't you fear Hallelujah don't you fear the glory of this L house shall be greater the power of the third pool will be so much greater than all that this publical spectacle it's but people look now and see the third pool is so secret and so intimate and so personal that if we were not careful we belittle what God is doing today we could go into the depth but listen you know the test tent Vision you know that little w wooden building and every individual went alone with God it was not it was not the whole congregation in the wooden building but just it's you and I with the Lord in that secret place and as soon as the prophet comes out of that Vision the angel came with the Scripture it is written Matthew 6 Jesus said if you want to pray go into your room in your closet close the door and the god that seeth in secret will answer public but people try to turn it around the god that see it publicly will answer you in secret that's not what he said Jesus said you go you alone talk it over with the Lord he's going to solve your problems amen he's going to answer your prayers the secrets of your heart and he's going to reward you P publicly for it so the angel was always scriptural but if we're not careful we look to it and we still want the spectacle we still want the public part and the angel said you cannot explain it it will not be a public show that's right amen help us Lord to stay humble amen help us to stay humble you will often see people with the complex will try to elevate him themselves and try to belittle others so very very like look to elab the brother of David and we are really dealing with some things here tonight it was actually because he knew on the inside he was he was so sour because he was so frustrated he didn't have the answer to the problem he was a big coward and here is a little Shepherd boy and all all of all his belittlement just expressed his complex that was bigger than Goliath right he had a huge complex Al and the old of the people of of you you can tell people with you know I'm I'm not a psychologist but I'm a pastor like people with minority complex can hurt so many other people right and and and it's it sounds so strange because people that want to elevate themselves and show how much they are and sometimes it's a complex of I didn't have Ed ucation and and and the prophet wasn't immune to it we are not immune to it I'm not immune to it but the Lord is saying don't you fear the glory of this Lea house shall be greater that's what the prophet says this this third pool if you've seen it m manifested temporarily it will not be used in a greater way until the pressure comes you wonder how much more pressure will have to come but let me tell you the third pool has never been inactive it's always active brother sister whether we see it where whether we feel it or whatever it's nothing to do with it let's not be literal let's not this is not returning back to discernment with the hands and laying on on the F no no no God is going further that's right and and the prophet is trying to show it time after time he's showing he he in in one sermon in 64 I believe he says nobody comes up to you to the Altar and then he calls the people and and then he starts to discern now they can see wow he's Discerning and the altar is full and now he's saying you're deceived see we want a sign and so many times the discernment comes but he says God is healing much more people out there so he's trying to teach us something there's nothing wrong with an altar there's nothing wrong with laying on of hands but Paul says I will show you a more excellent way so let us not allow the devil to belittle our experience amen but he says it's it's you out there you believe there not even with in perfect Faith he says it literally like this if you would believe if you would have perfect Faith you wouldn't even be in the prayer line right amen amen yes sir I always tell the people every service you can have a prayer line it's always open you can always come to the altar when the Lord calls you amen right but there is a faith a perfect faith that goes beyond that that you listen to the word of God is being revealed to you like David Hall and you receive it and it changes your life that's what we're going into but now we see people looking at it it looks too simple it looks too humble the third pool it should look simple it should look humble praise the Lord trying to find a close here God's covenant with Abraham and I see Jesus said constantly fear not fear not so that's what he said to the people in the time of haga don't you fear I've got this I've I've got everything in my hands I've got a greater glory waiting and which he's actually saying I do this on purpose so that your eyes are not on a big nice building with gold and and the and Solomon coming out in all of his glory there is a greater than Solomon here tonight hallelujah hallelujah and he's saying I'm I do this on purpose that there is a smaller Temple because it's not about the building it's it's not about how safe we feel in the building and how big the building is God is actually saying I want to show my glory and I want all the glory to come back to me not to a building or a man that's standing there and I'm saying tonight all the glory only belongs to you Jesus amen amen and he says fear not I am with you always even to the end of the world and the Christian he says keep sitting back oh I just wonder he says oh my turn loose amen get all these things away from you say Satan Mr Satan you are defeated

tonight's message I want to say this before we go I'm going to tell you what brother Bill my friend overseas all these years going all these trips I'm not a missionary but I'm going say quote him cuz when we hit hard times overseas and I get suck on the food and all these other things happen he's got one statement brother Paul we go forward we go forward I want to say it tonight we go forward there's a greater glory that he has promised us and we're holding on to that amen amen are you happy in the Lord tonight amen hallelujah I tell you this the message of the hour amen is an encouraging message yes because when when when God comes and he deals with he'll deal with sin he deal with unbelief he'll deal with things but it but it never is to get us to look at ourselves it's always to see him that the answer he's already made a way that's right that's right you remember when like brother B said when that when that Mama Eagle came over that that barnyard he said that that little Eagle had always been taught to look down but it's when that eagle begin to come is it learned you can't look down and ever go up right but here came an eagle and brother Braham said it like this in Rising in the sun he said that's why in this day it would take more than a picture or more than just a sermon on Eagles it would take a living eagle to come flying [Music] over that's what this message is it's Christ that has passed over our lives man that's who we really are that's our real identity amen I'll tell you the word of the Lord was so rich tonight and you know when you you yeah you don't even really you don't have words to describe it because we're living in that hour where the the Declaration is who has despised the day of small things uh because there's things that when we look at that even on that of the third poll Remember When U Leo and Jean they had mentioned to brother Brown brother Bram is it going to be we're going to be going in and emptying out hospitals brother Bram said oh no no no no no no see it's looking back to a former glory but see God continues to come forward and he said he said I want you to do it like this he said I want you to write it in the journal and put it up because someday he said you can get it back out and read it and he said this is what I want you to write he said that the ministry of this third pool will not be so much a change in the ministry as it will be a change in [Music] me that's what this word come to do it not only come to bring a real true birth in our lives but then that same word working to mold the very character of Christ in our lives amen bringing us all the way till eventually that final moment when we're Swept Away amen we are people of the change people of the open book is that right amen so oh how I thank God for his mercies tonight amen didn't you just then you appreciate uh the word of the Lord tonight amen amen praise be the name of the Lord amen belittling Spirits you can't stay that's right you can't stay you got to go you got to go oh my I tell you the word of the Lord was so rich brother David God bless you amen amen God bless you tonight amen amen just so good to be able to gather around the Throne of the Lord tonight and we just want to pray for Brother David he's got the meetings there with brother Paul this weekend I think on Saturday is it Saturday or just two on Sunday Su 5:00 okay Sunday at the Tri-State youth meeting at 5:00 and U so we want to pray for them as well for Brother David Lord will just give his brother strength because he's he was there at the men's meeting last weekend and he preached at brother Barry's last night and flew up here today just got off the plane and came here so we certainly appreciate the sacrifice amen and uh I told you you're at home and you really are home you're you're you're at home amen we certainly want Brother David to come back amen you see I I don't know about you but for me this is how I feel it's just like if somebody blesses my boys and they're a help to them man I I appreciate that and to me that's what I look at with Ministry is is I want Ministry that edifies the body amen yes amen I I mean there there's there's an impact when we're gone it it's something that the word has been delivered that just hasn't taking us there but it's a word that's come into our lives and it it'll move us because what it all comes down to is after every amen has said it's now time for the word to become flesh oh yes and I can tell you was preached on tonight we feel that liberating atmosphere as we enter into the word of God and what it is the word of God was actually casting away those belittling Spirits now I'm going to say this to you and because you know it as soon as come out of here the enemy is going to be waiting but I want you to remember the same God that belittled him in the presence of God he's just as much God when that belittling Spirit wants to whisper to you amen say Lord I take what you spoke to my heart and I refuse to go back oh my aren't you glad that God sees Great Value in our lives not in this flesh when God first got a hold of me it wasn't in my flesh that he saw Great Value as a matter of fact in my flesh there was a lot that said give him just a week give him just a little bit he's been to camps before there was even things that got out got back to me oh his daddy and them just took him and brainwashed him but you see God saw the gold on the inside God saw the silver on the inside that he had placed there from before the foundation the world and God knows how to bring out what he's placed in US sometimes it is sometimes there's things that God it'll come all out all at once a change right away but then sometimes it's little by little by little to me however it is it still takes God bringing change amen that's why we do not despise the day of small things I rejoice in every inch I rejoice in that little pinky like brother Bram said just move the pinky and eventually you'll be moving the hand then the arm and then the body just just just move the pinky and and you'll get going is that right it might be in your life tonight it might just be a a pinky in obedience just keep moving that and say thank you Lord for that movement you keep going with that finally it's the hand then it's the arm then then it's the body amen don't you love him my my my amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer and could we just all together give God thanks heavenly father thank you Lord for the word tonight that you've spoke to us the atmosphere Lord your word oh God has created Lord Jesus here we stand Lord and so thankful God tonight Lord as father as your word has been spoken you took Lord your servant and Lord you moved him aside Lord and you spoke Lord to
