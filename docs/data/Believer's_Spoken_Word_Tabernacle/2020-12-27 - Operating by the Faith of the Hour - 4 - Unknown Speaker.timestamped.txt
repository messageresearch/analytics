[21:20] faith in the word of god
[21:37] [Music]
[21:42] god singing through

[21:47] stand oh yes
[21:50] through it all oh yes
[21:58] his word
[22:02] oh so i thank god for all the mountains
[22:12] i thank you for all the storms that you
[22:16] brought
[22:17] me through you see if i would never
[22:23] have a problem i just wouldn't know
[22:27] that you could solve them
[22:30] oh yes i wouldn't even know what faith
[22:33] in the word of god
[22:38] oh yes
[22:49] to trust in jesus
[23:02] [Music]
[23:06] oh
[23:13] [Music]
[23:15] amen thank god for his mercy this
[23:18] morning
[23:19] and i'm so thankful to be in the house
[23:21] of the lord amen
[23:22] and god has certainly made a way for us
[23:24] and we just so appreciate
[23:26] appreciate his mercy and his grace and
[23:28] this hour we're living in
[23:30] and truly the song said through it all
[23:33] i've learned to depend upon his word
[23:36] you know there's many times in our
[23:38] journey
[23:40] sometimes we would love to have a direct
[23:42] word
[23:43] from the lord this is going to happen
[23:46] this will be this will be here this will
[23:48] be there and that
[23:50] that brings faith as well but we also
[23:53] recognize
[23:54] that there are times just like the
[23:55] children of israel where god hasn't
[23:58] spoken directly but you've got a promise
[24:02] and he has already spoken to your heart
[24:04] and you got a promise that you can stand
[24:06] upon
[24:06] [Music]
[24:07] just like they when they walked into the
[24:09] fiery furnace
[24:11] they prayed they did just like the
[24:14] believers would do
[24:15] but they did not have an answer
[24:19] is that right they didn't have they
[24:22] didn't have the promise god never said
[24:24] i tell you what you go ahead and go in
[24:26] the furnace
[24:27] where you're not going to get burnt
[24:29] you're not going to get consumed
[24:31] you're not even going to smell like
[24:32] smoke they didn't have
[24:34] nothing like that but they did have
[24:38] faith
[24:39] in god that he's a deliverer
[24:43] whether god delivers us out of this
[24:45] fiery furnace
[24:47] one way or another we're going to be
[24:49] delivered from the hands
[24:51] of the king amen and truly times in our
[24:55] life
[24:55] it places us in times just like that
[24:58] because faith isn't that we know
[25:00] everything and that we have everything
[25:03] laid out for us so this isn't going to
[25:04] happen or that's not going to happen
[25:06] then it would not be faith the faith is
[25:09] this is what god has said
[25:12] and we rest on that we let god bring the
[25:15] ram into existence
[25:16] we let god move in those times let god
[25:19] do
[25:20] what only he can do and i think that's
[25:23] wonderful don't you
[25:25] amen it's just a work of god we just
[25:28] thank god for his mercy once again
[25:30] as you maybe would turn in your bibles
[25:32] this morning i want to say thankful to
[25:34] the musicians
[25:36] as they hear paul for
[25:39] reading in songs i want to also
[25:44] just say this morning we have a lord
[25:46] willing right after the ministry of the
[25:48] service have a
[25:49] baptism we're here with ryan walker
[25:52] we had spoke back in august and then you
[25:55] know we had
[25:56] issues that had come up with the
[25:59] baptistry
[26:00] the tank or some things the brothers had
[26:02] to work and to
[26:04] redo some things on that and so before
[26:06] he went to college we weren't able to
[26:08] to get that accomplished and you
[26:10] understand with everything that's
[26:11] been going on but at any rate we had
[26:14] spoke on the phone and how the lord had
[26:17] been dealing with his heart and that's
[26:18] exactly what
[26:20] he wanted to give his life to the lord
[26:23] and allowed god just to
[26:25] to take control of his life and he
[26:27] wanted to move forward
[26:29] and in the waters of baptism so we just
[26:32] thank god for that and we just want to
[26:33] continue to pray for him
[26:35] amen that god will just complete the
[26:38] work
[26:39] amen because that's the promise that we
[26:41] have
[26:42] amen the same god that draws us to him
[26:44] he completes his word
[26:46] so as we look here in the word here this
[26:49] morning
[26:50] we want to just uh look here in james
[26:53] chapter two and we'll go ahead and read
[26:55] so you you'll be able to have your seats
[26:58] in james chapter 2 verse 20
[27:02] but wilt thou know o vain man that faith
[27:05] without
[27:05] works is dead was not
[27:08] abraham our father justified by works
[27:12] when he had offered isaac his son upon
[27:15] the altar
[27:16] see us thou have faith wrought with
[27:20] his works and by works was faith
[27:23] made perfect and the scripture was
[27:26] fulfilled
[27:28] which saith abraham believed god
[27:31] and it was imputed unto him for
[27:33] righteousness
[27:34] and he was called the friend of god
[27:39] verse 24 you see then how that by works
[27:44] a man is justified and not by faith
[27:47] only likewise also was
[27:50] not rahab the harlot justified
[27:53] by works when she had received the
[27:56] messengers
[27:58] and had sent them out another way
[28:01] whereas the body without the spirit
[28:04] is dead so faith without works
[28:09] is dead also
[28:13] so we want to just looking at how the
[28:16] scripture in james is we've been looking
[28:19] at this and there's just
[28:20] so much that lays here within it but it
[28:23] brings it down to
[28:25] our lives of what god sees
[28:28] what is in the heart god knows what he
[28:31] has placed
[28:32] within the heart of the individual
[28:35] and whatever is in the heart it comes
[28:38] out in the life and so
[28:42] as james was declaring if if there is
[28:44] not
[28:45] a person can say i have faith but if the
[28:48] faith itself
[28:49] is not expressing that
[28:53] itself of what has said has been
[28:55] received
[28:56] then it's vain and so we recognize
[28:59] there's only
[29:00] one faith that's a real living faith and
[29:03] that's the faith of god
[29:05] you and i still have our faith okay
[29:08] but it takes god's faith to come behind
[29:11] our faith
[29:13] our faith alone will not do it
[29:16] but it takes god's faith to come along
[29:20] and it moves our faith because of his
[29:24] faith just like we said moments ago
[29:25] where you
[29:26] stand upon the promises of god
[29:30] and you maybe don't know how this is
[29:32] going to come out or this is but
[29:33] this is going to come out but his faith
[29:36] moving
[29:37] your faith causes you to stand
[29:40] brown said it very simply in the message
[29:42] desperation he says
[29:44] love pushes faith
[29:47] out to the battlegrounds to stand
[29:52] let's just pray anybody have a need you
[29:55] may want to make known before the lord
[29:57] just say god just
[29:58] remember me lord remember the need god
[30:01] bless you
[30:03] heavenly father you're mindful
[30:07] you're merciful you're faithful
[30:11] dear god we just lord want to commit
[30:15] lord this service to remain part of it
[30:17] into your hands
[30:19] lord behind every hand
[30:22] and lord within every heart we have need
[30:25] of you
[30:27] and lord there's there's no way that a
[30:29] man can meet these needs
[30:32] but we ask that you would come that you
[30:34] would take control lord in this service
[30:37] and you would speak to our hearts lord
[30:40] minister to our lives in a very personal
[30:42] way
[30:43] oh god may the spirit of god just come
[30:46] and get into the word
[30:47] and take it out to the hearts of the
[30:49] people lord
[30:50] we just lord just look to you to know
[30:53] and lord with an assurance
[30:55] that god your word it's a factual lord
[30:58] it'll work lord in every heart that it
[31:00] is received
[31:02] we just give ourselves to you lord just
[31:05] ask that we might just be able to yield
[31:07] and step out of the way
[31:08] we thank you father for each and every
[31:11] lord
[31:12] need that you administer to here this
[31:14] morning we ask in the name of jesus
[31:17] christ amen
[31:19] may god bless you as you're being seated
[31:26] and the message works as faith express
[31:30] brother branham would say it like this
[31:32] and giving many different
[31:33] examples with this of
[31:36] faith and works and he says
[31:41] now jesus said only believe for all
[31:44] things are possible
[31:46] to them that believe faith and works
[31:50] are husband and wife they work
[31:54] together the husband works with the wife
[31:58] the wife with the husband they identify
[32:03] one another he said like a man would say
[32:06] he's married and yet he can't produce
[32:08] and show that he has a wife
[32:10] you doubt his claim a man say i'm
[32:12] married
[32:13] you say where's your wife oh i don't
[32:16] know about that
[32:17] be kind of hard for me to believe you i
[32:20] say well
[32:20] where's your wife well i don't know i
[32:23] said i ain't going to believe it so you
[32:26] see if you have what you say you have
[32:29] i have faith how are you going to show
[32:31] me you got faith
[32:34] by your words i'm married
[32:37] how do i know you're married
[32:40] this is my wife there you are i am
[32:44] married
[32:44] this is my husband i'm healed
[32:47] how do you know my works shows
[32:51] my faith what you're speaking of your
[32:54] faith is what god sees in you
[32:56] your works is what the other people
[33:00] see in you remember the lord jesus would
[33:04] express
[33:04] to us that you are a candle
[33:08] a life that has really been lit by god
[33:12] god has come to that life and god has
[33:16] lit that candle that part that god has
[33:19] placed there
[33:20] and now it is a place that it is that
[33:23] which will give
[33:24] light and he said no no candle is hit
[33:28] under a bushel
[33:30] but rather it's put as a city on the
[33:33] hill
[33:34] so something that you can see
[33:37] from great distances it's a light that
[33:40] that you're able to see
[33:42] it's a life as he would go on to say let
[33:45] me
[33:45] let your light soul shine before men
[33:49] that they may see
[33:50] your good works and glorify
[33:53] your heavenly father
[33:56] so the light itself that's god
[34:00] that's god's life that's the faith of
[34:02] god
[34:03] our good works is not us
[34:06] trying to be good but those good works
[34:10] are those works that is by him alone
[34:14] who is good and there's no one good
[34:17] but god and so it takes god
[34:20] moving on the inside to bring forth
[34:24] the good works that the scripture says
[34:27] we have been
[34:28] for ordained unto good works
[34:31] so it takes god to bring forth the
[34:34] expression
[34:35] the faith of god moving in to express
[34:39] of of the works of god and this is where
[34:43] as brother graham said your faith is
[34:45] what god sees in you
[34:47] your works is what other people
[34:50] see in you you see this is why very
[34:52] simple
[34:54] a person can say well i'm a christian
[34:57] and brother brown would say
[34:58] just perfect like this if your neighbors
[35:00] don't know you are you're a christian
[35:02] something's wrong people should know
[35:05] you're a christian
[35:06] by the life you live
[35:10] not by something that we have to carry
[35:13] to prove them
[35:14] or to tell them let me just say this
[35:16] everything itself
[35:18] it expresses itself let me this covers a
[35:21] full gamut it covers
[35:23] the life you live the types of things
[35:26] that you
[35:26] feed on the types of posts you make on
[35:29] facebook
[35:30] and everything else there is no such
[35:33] thing as well you know
[35:34] sexual humor is just funny that's
[35:37] nonsense
[35:39] there is no such thing to a believer
[35:42] come on you see you're you're like you
[35:45] can tell
[35:45] brother brandon says you let me go into
[35:47] a man's office and let me see
[35:49] the music he listens to let me see the
[35:51] pinups on his wall
[35:52] and i'll tell you what that man feeds on
[35:54] it don't matter if that man says he's a
[35:56] christian
[35:57] it's what he feeds on it tells what's
[36:00] really there
[36:03] so this is not you see the faith of god
[36:05] is not
[36:06] something that we have to declare oh i
[36:09] have to
[36:09] prove this no it's a complete change
[36:12] of nature on the inside
[36:16] it's not a chicken trying to act like an
[36:18] eagle
[36:19] it's an eagle that is expressing it's an
[36:22] eagle so he says
[36:26] that's that's the difference between
[36:28] james and paul here
[36:29] explaining about abraham they never
[36:32] contradicted one another
[36:33] they was both the same married
[36:38] so is faith that doesn't produce works
[36:41] anyone has a right to doubt your
[36:43] testimony
[36:45] is that right right now do you hear me
[36:48] says before we start the prayer line
[36:50] if your faith doesn't produce works with
[36:52] it you can't make
[36:53] anyone believe that you're healed you
[36:56] say well i don't know
[36:57] well yeah sure i've got all the faith in
[36:59] the world you don't
[37:01] because if you are you got faith then
[37:03] works
[37:04] is married to faith their husband and
[37:08] wife one identifies the other
[37:13] the person says well i got peace it will
[37:16] identify
[37:17] itself but if fear is there
[37:21] it'll identify itself as well
[37:24] you see as as it is expressed
[37:27] that their husband and wife one
[37:29] identifies
[37:30] the other now in hebrews 11 1 because we
[37:33] recognize
[37:34] faith this faith that we're speaking
[37:36] about
[37:37] is god's own faith hebrews 11 1
[37:40] now faith is the substance of things
[37:43] hoped for
[37:44] the evidence of things not seen it's a
[37:47] substance
[37:48] it's an evidence in verse 2 for by
[37:52] it the elders obtained a good report
[37:56] when we go on and read the rest of it
[37:58] hebrews 11 which we're not going to
[38:00] but we go through many of the great
[38:03] men and women down through scripture
[38:06] where the bible would say
[38:07] they were subject to life passions such
[38:09] as we are
[38:10] but yet they had a testimony that they
[38:14] were
[38:14] overcomers in their day the hebrew
[38:16] children we spoke of
[38:18] daniel david samson on and on let me
[38:21] tell you why they were overcomers
[38:23] it wasn't because they had good genes it
[38:26] was because they were
[38:27] genes of god and god ignited them
[38:31] and rose up within them his own
[38:34] dna it was gone
[38:38] in them that overcame
[38:42] amen hallelujah and so
[38:45] by it by what by this faith
[38:49] they obtained a good report they
[38:52] fulfilled the word that god had given to
[38:55] them
[38:56] now notice verse three through faith we
[39:00] understand that the worlds were framed
[39:03] by the word of god so that things which
[39:07] were not seen
[39:08] were not made so that things which are
[39:11] seen were not made of things
[39:12] which do appear by faith evil obtained
[39:16] unto be offered unto god a more
[39:18] excellent sacrifice than cain
[39:20] by which he obtained witness that he was
[39:24] righteous god testifying of his gifts
[39:27] and by it he by it he being dead
[39:31] yet speaketh now notice god revealed to
[39:34] abel
[39:35] what did god reveal it was god's faith
[39:38] that revelation of that of the lamb that
[39:42] it was blood that took him out
[39:44] it would be blood to take him back in it
[39:46] was god's faith that came
[39:48] by the revelation of god that led
[39:51] abel to go forth and he carried out
[39:55] what was revealed to him i think these
[39:57] are things that we need to be very clear
[39:59] on
[39:59] revelation is not knowledge knowledge
[40:03] itself
[40:03] will produce no action that's human
[40:06] faith but the faith of god dropping in
[40:11] it takes god's faith as we've been
[40:13] looking at in the previous services
[40:16] it takes him coming he's the one that
[40:19] comes
[40:19] gets into his word he makes his presence
[40:22] known
[40:23] that he indeed is the high priest not
[40:25] way off in the heavens but he's the high
[40:27] priest
[40:28] right here among us this morning he's
[40:30] veiled
[40:31] in his word speaking and ministering to
[40:34] our hearts
[40:34] he's declaring when he speaks to your
[40:37] heart he answers questions
[40:39] he moves for your needs he's declaring
[40:41] he is the ever-present god
[40:43] he is the i am amen
[40:46] he's letting it be known that this is
[40:48] not just a story
[40:50] that you believe in well yeah god raised
[40:52] from the dead he's declaring
[40:54] i am the risen one i'm the one who
[40:56] raised
[40:57] up from the grave and i'm right here
[40:59] among you i'm right here speaking to
[41:01] your hearts i'm alive
[41:03] as he appeared to john i am he that was
[41:06] dead and i'm alive forevermore
[41:08] no man could ever say that it was always
[41:10] the opposite i'm alive and dead
[41:12] but this one said i am he that was dead
[41:15] and now i'm alive forevermore
[41:17] and i've got the keys
[41:20] hallelujah that vision of the word
[41:22] breaking on john's life
[41:24] it inspired faith in his heart now
[41:27] notice
[41:28] by faith enoch was translated that he
[41:31] should not see
[41:32] death and was not found because god
[41:36] had translated him for before his
[41:39] translation
[41:42] somebody said before he had this
[41:45] testimony
[41:46] that he pleased god the rapture
[41:51] is for those who have a testimony
[41:54] amen now i'm talking about a testament
[41:56] just a testimony of
[41:58] well you know i was sick and i got well
[42:00] or i pray for so-and-so
[42:01] not talking about a life i'm talking
[42:04] about a life that's lived
[42:05] the testimony of jesus christ in you
[42:09] the testimony of jesus christ in us
[42:12] enoch had a life you know what he not
[42:14] means
[42:15] right here in the scripture the word
[42:17] evil means dedicated
[42:19] by faith dedicated to the rapture you
[42:22] see
[42:23] where does the rapture how does it come
[42:25] it comes to dedicated life
[42:27] it's not us trying to dedicate ourselves
[42:30] you see this is the power of divine
[42:32] revelation
[42:33] it brings dedication the faith of god is
[42:36] not something you say oh i got to be
[42:38] more dedicated i got to be more
[42:40] dedicated listen
[42:41] god moves on our hearts and we can see
[42:43] in our lives there is more for us to
[42:45] give
[42:46] but i think you're very you're
[42:47] understanding what i'm saying that when
[42:49] that revelation comes brother
[42:51] it's not you trying to pull yourself or
[42:54] try to do something
[42:55] but it's god on the inside of you it's
[42:58] god
[42:59] moving you it's god directing you it's
[43:02] no longer
[43:03] your efforts it's your yielding
[43:06] and his life but without faith notice
[43:11] verse 6
[43:13] without faith it's impossible to please
[43:16] him
[43:18] for he that cometh to god must believe
[43:22] that he is and that he is a rewarder of
[43:23] them
[43:25] that diligently seek him so this faith
[43:28] is a faith that goes beyond the carnal
[43:30] mind
[43:31] the bible says in romans 8 the carnal
[43:33] mind is enmity and strife
[43:36] against god so this faith is that same
[43:39] faith
[43:40] that moves down into the heart as we
[43:42] read
[43:43] in verse 1 faith is the substance
[43:47] it's a deposit that god would make
[43:50] himself into the heart of his children i
[43:53] want you to really lock in here
[43:55] it's a revelation from god as we were
[43:58] looking at that last week
[43:59] it's sovereignly given by his grace
[44:02] amen you can be sitting right here and
[44:04] you've got a need in your life
[44:06] maybe you've got a need for deliverance
[44:08] you've got a need for healing
[44:10] you've got a need for salvation you've
[44:12] got a need for the baptism of the holy
[44:14] ghost
[44:15] god operates sovereignly
[44:19] amen we don't have to work ourselves up
[44:22] into it
[44:24] that is not the purpose of the music
[44:26] then it's not the purpose
[44:28] that when there's no purpose to try to
[44:31] work us up
[44:32] you understand there's things where
[44:34] sometimes where
[44:35] people think pentecostal is where
[44:37] they've got to play the key of g
[44:39] and everybody gets excited no pentecost
[44:42] is where god
[44:43] steps inside of a life where that life
[44:46] has experienced the liberty and the
[44:48] loosening power
[44:50] the cleansing flow of the blood of the
[44:52] lamb pentecost simple
[44:54] is god tabernacling himself in his
[44:57] children
[44:57] that's a real liberty it's that which
[45:00] belonged to you and i
[45:01] pentecos is restoring back to that
[45:03] rightful place
[45:04] that you and i would have in god and we
[45:07] could not get back there on our own
[45:09] but he came he paid the price
[45:12] he sent forth the holy ghost that
[45:15] portion of the promise
[45:16] that belonged to us it comes back and it
[45:19] quickens that seed
[45:20] on the inside it brings us back to the
[45:22] place
[45:24] that we have bypassed
[45:29] so this is a revelation from god
[45:33] sovereignly given by his grace it's
[45:36] broadcast to all
[45:38] yet there's a predestinated ground for
[45:40] it to fall into
[45:42] look at the scripture in verse three we
[45:43] read through faith
[45:45] we understand that the worlds were
[45:47] framed by the word of god
[45:49] this word framed it deals with
[45:52] and it describes what is prepared
[45:55] for oneself frame
[46:00] by faith we understand that the worlds
[46:04] were framed by the word of god god by
[46:08] his word remember
[46:09] god spoke his word but he didn't speak
[46:13] it and then have faith
[46:14] in it he already had faith therefore he
[46:16] spoke
[46:17] this is why jesus brings it down it says
[46:20] if there be no doubt in your heart and
[46:22] you
[46:23] say to this mountain be thou removed and
[46:26] capped plucked up and cast in the
[46:27] undersea
[46:28] it shall be even as thou hast said see
[46:31] it's bringing it down
[46:33] into our life we understand that the
[46:36] worlds were framed all was set together
[46:39] even how things were made think about
[46:41] this you or i don't sit around you know
[46:43] there's interesting things we can catch
[46:45] or pick up where you know they'll say
[46:47] you know maybe how this particular
[46:49] animal hibernates or they migrate or
[46:51] whatever and we just
[46:52] we stand in all that many times of how
[46:55] you don't have to go out there and tell
[46:56] the deer hey change your coat
[46:58] hey change your coat you know winter's
[47:00] coming you don't have to go out there
[47:01] and tell the deer
[47:02] hey lose the red coat put on your thick
[47:04] coat there is just
[47:06] it's already built within them you don't
[47:08] have to tell
[47:09] the ducks hey you know water's for you
[47:11] you know you need to go to water you
[47:13] need these what this is for you
[47:15] god allowed that witness left and
[47:17] remained in the earth
[47:18] to show that where the seed of god is
[47:23] when the life of god the water of god
[47:25] the word of god
[47:27] begins to deal with that seed that seed
[47:29] is coming into a place
[47:31] where there's an awakening going on and
[47:33] you're not going to have to tell them
[47:35] go to water you belong in water or you
[47:37] need to change your cup
[47:39] it is there within them within that seed
[47:42] it's responding to the light and the
[47:44] conditions
[47:45] that are taking place
[47:48] to think of it the frame the word of god
[47:51] if praying
[47:51] it prepared for oneself god prepared
[47:55] the world she prepared that even the
[47:57] stars
[47:58] themselves that's where he wrote his
[48:00] first bible to where even the planets
[48:03] and
[48:03] how those things would come into place
[48:05] the celestial bodies
[48:06] that was all framed by the word of god i
[48:09] asked you
[48:10] did it happen overnight
[48:13] no how long did it take
[48:20] don't raise your hand because you don't
[48:21] got an answer
[48:23] well by the same all i know it is
[48:27] but it is because he spoke it
[48:31] he had faith before he said amen
[48:34] he said it and he comes the faith that
[48:37] spoken
[48:38] is there to perform it
[48:41] that's the same way in every age when
[48:44] god
[48:45] sends his word when luther stood there
[48:48] and they were you know saying well this
[48:50] this bread this is the literal body of
[48:52] jesus christ
[48:53] we transform it and all these all that
[48:55] nonsense
[48:57] and luther the inspiration struck him
[49:00] this is not the body of my lord
[49:04] and he threw it down is that right
[49:07] let me tell you what would cause a man
[49:09] to stand like that
[49:10] and raise up against the catholic church
[49:13] what would cause a man to stand that way
[49:16] i tell you human faith alone and do it a
[49:18] man would crumble under human faith
[49:20] even when martin luther when he was
[49:21] there at wittenberg and mind battles
[49:23] were coming the faith of god
[49:25] was greater than any mind battle that he
[49:27] had
[49:29] what was it that caused him to stand
[49:30] that way i'm telling you it was the
[49:32] faith of god
[49:33] that inspired him in the word of god
[49:36] that brought forth the message the just
[49:38] shall live by faith
[49:40] it framed it it brought together
[49:43] many times when a messenger would go
[49:45] forth it is until afterwards
[49:48] that you would see as the word goes
[49:50] forward that afterwards then you see
[49:52] as the crop beginning to come on but
[49:54] with god the god who speaks his word
[49:58] is present to perform it amen amen
[50:06] sometimes we go by our feelings
[50:09] well i didn't feel this service or i
[50:11] didn't feel that had nothing to do with
[50:12] it
[50:14] god's trying to get us away from some of
[50:16] the things of immaturity
[50:18] and get us into a place of maturity to
[50:20] know his word can't fail
[50:22] amen jesus standing before the tomb of
[50:26] lazarus didn't pray because he had to
[50:27] he said i pray because of them standing
[50:29] by there's a lot of things
[50:31] jesus does the love from his heart is
[50:34] for us
[50:36] he comes before our ten door sarah and
[50:38] he'll speak to us
[50:41] he'll deal with our lives and that's the
[50:43] love of god he's not demeaning us but
[50:45] it's god
[50:45] he's through that time he's bringing us
[50:48] to a place to even recognize
[50:50] his word is effectual how many people
[50:53] sitting in meetings brother rem said to
[50:55] white moody he didn't even you know
[50:56] preach that
[50:57] of divine healing but yet he just got to
[50:59] preaching the word
[51:01] and as he was preaching the word there
[51:03] were people
[51:04] being healed in the audience when the
[51:07] word was going forth
[51:08] why faith inspired the message that was
[51:11] being brought
[51:12] he wasn't preaching divine healing but
[51:14] the divine healer
[51:15] was present on the grounds the faith
[51:18] then spare that word
[51:20] and take that word out and the word
[51:22] energized
[51:23] and people could walk away from a
[51:25] service and they didn't even recognize
[51:27] or
[51:27] sit there and say oh i don't have enough
[51:30] faith oh i wish i had more faith
[51:31] and how the prophet of god by the angel
[51:33] of the lord will look down and say
[51:35] you didn't know you had that much faith
[51:37] did you but you were healed just moments
[51:40] ago
[51:40] faith is a subconscious thing it's not
[51:44] something you have to think about
[51:46] it just comes out right amen that's what
[51:49] this faith that's with the faith
[51:51] comes let me not go there let me just
[51:52] stay here prepared
[51:55] if framing is prepared for oneself
[51:57] notice in luke 8 verse 11
[52:01] the parable now here jesus is giving
[52:03] this parable
[52:05] the seed is the word of god
[52:10] this parable is he gave in each of the
[52:12] gospels
[52:14] and that the parable of the sower the
[52:17] seed is the word of god
[52:19] those by the wayside are they that hear
[52:23] then cometh the devil and take other way
[52:26] the word
[52:27] out of their hearts lest they should
[52:30] believe and be saved
[52:33] they on the rock are they which when
[52:35] they hear
[52:36] receive the word with joy and these have
[52:39] no root for which
[52:40] for a while believe and in the time of
[52:43] temptation
[52:44] fall away and they which fell among
[52:47] thorns
[52:48] are they which when they have heard go
[52:51] forth
[52:52] and are choked with cares and riches
[52:55] and pleasures of life and bring no fruit
[53:00] to perfection but that on the good
[53:03] ground that's what i
[53:04] believe i'm speaking to but that on the
[53:07] good ground
[53:08] are they notice the ground is talking
[53:11] about
[53:12] persons this ground is talking about
[53:16] persons but that on the good ground are
[53:19] they
[53:20] which in an honest and good heart
[53:23] having heard the word keep it and bring
[53:26] forth fruit with patience
[53:30] now brother brown would say here's the
[53:31] predestinated plan
[53:33] in plain view and just as the other seed
[53:36] the word of god is a seed and must have
[53:40] the ground
[53:41] prepared beforehand if you
[53:44] sowed seed just throw it out there on
[53:47] the ground
[53:48] it would do no good the birds would pick
[53:51] it up
[53:51] you would throw it among thorns and
[53:53] thistles it'll choke it out pretty soon
[53:55] jesus parable said so so the ground
[53:58] has to be made ready first
[54:03] so god in sovereign grace prepares the
[54:07] heart
[54:07] [Music]
[54:08] first he prepared
[54:11] you before the foundation of the world
[54:14] to receive him in this age
[54:18] there's a part of you that has been
[54:21] prepared
[54:22] to receive him a part of him
[54:25] that is already prepared to receive him
[54:28] when he makes
[54:29] himself known to you in the hour
[54:33] in the season of the world and notice as
[54:36] he has prepared you and made ready that
[54:39] you could receive him
[54:41] remember he has to come and deal with
[54:44] the heart
[54:44] because he just doesn't override
[54:47] repentance
[54:50] this is god making the heart ready is
[54:53] repentance
[54:54] because of what is laying there already
[54:57] on the inside
[54:59] that's what he's coming that's the
[55:00] betting ground but there's got to be a
[55:01] repentance first
[55:03] are you with me so here let me read that
[55:07] again so god in sovereign grace
[55:09] prepares the heart first that's the work
[55:11] that god
[55:12] does through the preaching of the gospel
[55:15] now and now comes clear back before the
[55:18] foundation of the world
[55:19] he prepared you before the foundation of
[55:22] the world
[55:22] to receive him in this age you are
[55:25] represented
[55:26] in him before the foundational world as
[55:29] a matter of fact
[55:30] you were there when the morning stars
[55:32] shouted for joy
[55:35] are you with me you were also part of
[55:38] those stars
[55:39] that in isaiah 14 that lucifer said i
[55:42] will exalt my throat
[55:43] i will sin above the stars of god the
[55:46] stars of god means the messiah's
[55:49] brothers
[55:50] i will exalt myself above them but the
[55:52] word goes out
[55:54] god that exalted thyself thou shalt be
[55:57] brought down
[55:59] hallelujah glory be to god in the
[56:02] highest
[56:03] god prepared you before the foundation
[56:06] of the world
[56:07] to receive him in this age he foreknew
[56:10] you
[56:11] by his foreknowledge and ordained you to
[56:14] eternal life
[56:15] he knew you therefore he prepared you
[56:19] that's the reason you staggered out of
[56:22] these things
[56:23] and staggered into what you have now
[56:26] you didn't know what was taking place
[56:28] you're staggering all right percent
[56:30] what's going on but look at you look now
[56:32] look what god does
[56:33] when it finally god brings you into the
[56:36] place that is prepared for you
[56:38] listen friends i'm not just talking
[56:40] about this church it's got to go deeper
[56:42] than that
[56:43] it's talking about in christ in your
[56:45] inheritance
[56:46] in your enlightened portion it's when
[56:48] you come into that place
[56:50] you're no longer staggering around and
[56:52] bumping around
[56:53] but now you have been positioned in
[56:56] christ what is it
[56:57] it's a faith that expresses itself as a
[57:00] position
[57:01] mature adopted son and daughter of god
[57:05] is that right it removes the staggering
[57:08] you know what staggering is
[57:09] you don't know what's going on look how
[57:11] god's leading you here but
[57:13] i'm saying things that ought to be you
[57:14] came to the altar that night in a little
[57:15] mission
[57:16] you didn't know what was taking place
[57:17] you all you knew is god dealt with your
[57:19] heart you gave your heart to god
[57:20] maybe it was in your home you had no
[57:22] idea you know it's not even anything
[57:24] you're thinking about but all of a
[57:25] sudden your heart starts to turn what's
[57:27] happening you're staggering out of
[57:29] and staggering into even the staggering
[57:32] it's not you
[57:33] leading yourself it's god leading you
[57:36] you don't even know what's taking place
[57:42] and the truth be known is becoming more
[57:44] real to you and i
[57:46] even as we journey on
[57:50] it was god leading you to the place
[57:52] where he had ordained for you to be
[57:54] if this ground isn't prepared beforehand
[57:56] it can't grow
[57:58] that's the reason the seed of faith when
[58:01] you're preaching
[58:02] faith the discernments of the lord and
[58:04] see what takes place and
[58:05] gifts of the bible working people will
[58:07] work themselves up oh hallelujah i
[58:09] believe it
[58:10] and they come up and they find
[58:11] themselves disappointed the ground has
[58:13] to be foreign
[58:15] and you know it when it strikes him now
[58:18] in the scripture here the bible if i can
[58:22] just refer to a few places
[58:24] without having to really maybe to read
[58:26] them
[58:28] but if you didn't take if you notice
[58:30] that the earth itself
[58:32] as it is spoken of it is the only
[58:36] planet only only one mentioned in the
[58:39] scripture
[58:41] that is inhabited if nasa and the rest
[58:45] of them
[58:47] would only read the bible and believe it
[58:49] right amen
[58:50] they'd stop all the crazy spending
[58:54] are you with me i mean just
[58:57] five million dollars do rats have tails
[59:00] i mean you think of people have they
[59:04] gone nuts
[59:05] yes they have i mean i know they got
[59:08] tails so what
[59:11] but notice this the earth itself
[59:14] notice in the scripture genesis 2 it
[59:17] says
[59:18] the lord god planted a garden
[59:23] eastward in eden this word garden in the
[59:26] hebrew
[59:26] means bride god planted a garden it was
[59:31] a special place
[59:33] that he had prepared in the earth
[59:38] the bible goes on to say out of the
[59:40] ground made the lord god to grow
[59:42] every tree that is pleasant to the site
[59:44] good for food the tree of life
[59:46] is also in the midst of the garden in
[59:48] genesis 4 when it speaks after
[59:51] cain has rose up against abel there
[59:54] remember the bible says thou art cursed
[59:56] from the earth
[59:57] which hath opened her mouth so it refers
[1:00:01] to the earth
[1:00:02] she is a womb it's ground it's a place
[1:00:06] that seed is to be received
[1:00:10] it opens her mouth
[1:00:14] thou telleth the ground it shall not
[1:00:15] henceforth yield unto thee
[1:00:17] her strength in leviticus 26
[1:00:21] 4 god's promise i will give you rain
[1:00:24] in new season and the land shall yield
[1:00:27] her
[1:00:28] increase now look how god would place
[1:00:32] this after the fall
[1:00:34] here we recognize as god here working
[1:00:38] and after the fall had taken place
[1:00:41] and god makes this declaration there to
[1:00:44] this first couple
[1:00:46] in the garden i will put enmity between
[1:00:49] thee
[1:00:50] and the woman between thy seed and
[1:00:53] her seed it shall bruise thy head
[1:00:56] and thou shalt bruise his heel brother
[1:00:59] brown would say it just like this
[1:01:01] god he said had to reveal himself in his
[1:01:04] attributes
[1:01:05] in this person called christ in order to
[1:01:08] take death upon himself
[1:01:10] as jehovah he could not die
[1:01:13] so he had to create himself a body
[1:01:18] and no woman could produce that body
[1:01:22] you see he says when i think of it it's
[1:01:24] his character
[1:01:26] projected the lovely person
[1:01:29] of jesus christ so god's character
[1:01:31] projected the person of jesus christ
[1:01:34] no woman could bring it moses mother
[1:01:38] joshua had she was a great woman so was
[1:01:41] rebecca
[1:01:41] and many other women but none of them
[1:01:44] could produce
[1:01:45] this type of character because it was
[1:01:48] come through
[1:01:48] sex by a fallen people but god
[1:01:52] projected his own body his own
[1:01:55] dwelling place that's the reason he was
[1:01:58] the son of god
[1:01:59] because nothing else could project it
[1:02:01] but his own divine character
[1:02:03] projected this tabernacle to express
[1:02:06] himself
[1:02:07] in woman could not produce it the bible
[1:02:11] says
[1:02:12] man is born of a woman is a few days old
[1:02:14] and
[1:02:15] full of trouble is that right but by the
[1:02:18] woman tree
[1:02:19] we die right but by the man tree we live
[1:02:23] is that right here's the tree of life
[1:02:26] now notice
[1:02:27] he would give her a seed this is the
[1:02:28] promise he would give her a seed
[1:02:31] and when he gave her a seed this would
[1:02:33] be
[1:02:34] her seat the woman herself she has no
[1:02:38] seats she's a betting ground
[1:02:40] right is that right
[1:02:43] a woman can't have a child on her own a
[1:02:48] man himself just can't go and have a
[1:02:49] child on his own
[1:02:51] see that's why the perversions between
[1:02:53] men and women men and men as homosexuals
[1:02:55] and and these women and women and women
[1:02:58] that can produce no life
[1:03:01] what is it death it's perversion
[1:03:05] is that right but you see the hour that
[1:03:07] we're in
[1:03:09] that's where it's at among churches the
[1:03:11] man is not there
[1:03:13] right amen the one that cannot give you
[1:03:15] life it takes the mantra
[1:03:18] to bring you in it takes god he said
[1:03:22] i am the way the truth and the life
[1:03:26] it takes him coming ruth could not bring
[1:03:28] herself in
[1:03:29] boaz had to bring her in rehab could not
[1:03:32] bring herself
[1:03:32] in salmon had to bring her in when the
[1:03:35] daughters of salafia
[1:03:37] had no way to get to their inheritance
[1:03:39] but yet one who was a king
[1:03:41] out their father's tribe they married
[1:03:43] him and then they
[1:03:44] enter into their inheritance it takes
[1:03:47] the man to bring you in
[1:03:50] amen is that right so we see this
[1:03:53] yet god by his spirit
[1:03:57] listen to me now he would transmit into
[1:04:00] her
[1:04:00] into mary that seed
[1:04:03] both the bedding ground and
[1:04:06] life he borrowed the wound
[1:04:11] but he did not take the oven or the egg
[1:04:14] of mary amen that would have been
[1:04:18] another sinful mankind
[1:04:22] you see what god was saying god was
[1:04:24] letting us know i do
[1:04:25] not need your help
[1:04:28] [Music]
[1:04:30] this is why when it came to mary and let
[1:04:33] it be known what's going to take place
[1:04:35] mary first of all look reasoning said
[1:04:38] how can this be but the betting ground
[1:04:40] was there
[1:04:41] already prepared when the word came and
[1:04:44] said the holy ghost
[1:04:45] shall overshadow thee what did that do
[1:04:48] when that word
[1:04:49] came in that hour that was spoken by the
[1:04:52] prophet isaiah
[1:04:53] and god was there declaring it it was
[1:04:55] awakening
[1:04:56] the betting ground that was in mary that
[1:05:00] the word was for
[1:05:01] and she said be it unto me
[1:05:04] according to thy word she did not know
[1:05:08] how it was going to happen
[1:05:09] she did not know how it was going to
[1:05:11] take place all she
[1:05:13] now faith the faith of god that
[1:05:15] energized the promise to be spoken
[1:05:18] had energized her heart toward her faith
[1:05:21] now was declaring that be it unto me
[1:05:24] according to thy word
[1:05:26] amen how's it going to happen that's not
[1:05:29] faith
[1:05:31] that faith you have you've got faith
[1:05:32] because you figure everything out
[1:05:34] then you don't have faith right amen
[1:05:37] right
[1:05:40] oh glory be to god hallelujah
[1:05:44] so notice god god brings forth the
[1:05:47] betting ground
[1:05:48] and the life because no part of it was
[1:05:51] mary
[1:05:52] it was god preparing himself a body
[1:05:56] to come and live in and redeem us
[1:05:58] through remember what took place at the
[1:05:59] river jordan
[1:06:01] remember he was being baptized and here
[1:06:04] came the holy ghost descending down from
[1:06:08] heaven
[1:06:08] and out of lack and unto a dove god is
[1:06:11] coming into
[1:06:12] humanity and out from the dove remember
[1:06:15] from above
[1:06:16] he was spoke out this is my beloved son
[1:06:20] in whom i'm well pleased to dwell what
[1:06:22] was he doing
[1:06:23] the spirit of god the heavenly father
[1:06:26] was
[1:06:26] claiming this is my word has produced
[1:06:30] this and now i'm coming to proclaim
[1:06:32] what my word has produced
[1:06:35] what does the coming of the holy ghost
[1:06:38] say in your life
[1:06:39] it's coming to claim what god
[1:06:43] has already sown in your
[1:06:46] life he's coming to say
[1:06:49] that's prepared ground that belongs to
[1:06:52] me
[1:06:56] oh don't worry on that prepared ground
[1:06:58] on the other part
[1:06:59] on the other ground that was here oh
[1:07:01] there was all sorts of things that was
[1:07:02] done on that ground
[1:07:03] but this ground satan has never put his
[1:07:05] dirty feet
[1:07:06] on the prepared ground of god right
[1:07:08] let's say brother sam you have no idea
[1:07:10] of my past
[1:07:12] but there's a past that's greater than
[1:07:13] your past that ties you into your future
[1:07:16] because you see a seed itself was not
[1:07:18] alive
[1:07:19] but yet there's only one that could
[1:07:21] raise it up and that's god
[1:07:23] it was a batting ground that seed that
[1:07:26] the devil has
[1:07:27] never put his dirty feet on but god
[1:07:30] comes by his quickening power
[1:07:32] after he does away with your first
[1:07:34] husband and raises it up
[1:07:36] now look at this here i just i just want
[1:07:39] to read these things are inspired in my
[1:07:41] heart
[1:07:42] he is the first of this new race
[1:07:45] this is why the bible calls it we are a
[1:07:48] new creation
[1:07:50] in christ jesus he's the first of this
[1:07:54] new race it's not our life or our soul
[1:07:57] per se
[1:07:58] that we lend to god but rather by
[1:08:01] foreknowledge
[1:08:02] and predestination he placed a seed
[1:08:04] within us
[1:08:05] which is the attribute thought of the
[1:08:07] word himself
[1:08:08] one of his genes when you hear this
[1:08:11] genes
[1:08:12] word thought attribute it's speaking of
[1:08:15] the betting ground
[1:08:17] for the word that lay within your life
[1:08:21] the whole time dormant
[1:08:25] dormant only he
[1:08:28] could raise it up only he can raise it
[1:08:32] up
[1:08:33] what does he do before he raise it up he
[1:08:35] prepares the heart first
[1:08:37] he's got to start dealing with the heart
[1:08:39] and as he's dealing with the heart
[1:08:41] you see the staggering you see the
[1:08:45] staggering around but it's god dealing
[1:08:46] with the heart
[1:08:48] amen god dealing with the heart what's
[1:08:49] he doing he's preparing the heart first
[1:08:52] he's got to get everything lined up in
[1:08:54] agreeance
[1:08:56] are you with me notice
[1:08:59] he placed that seed we are one of the
[1:09:02] genes the
[1:09:03] heirs from the loins of his mind when we
[1:09:06] dropped from our mother's womb
[1:09:08] this seed of god that i'm talking about
[1:09:11] that was in god
[1:09:12] when you and i dropped from our mother's
[1:09:14] womb even god knowing the hair color
[1:09:17] the eye color and everything about you
[1:09:19] and i psalms 139
[1:09:21] thou knewest me when my members yet not
[1:09:24] written in thy book
[1:09:27] yet altogether perfect is that right
[1:09:31] god knew you god even knew all of those
[1:09:34] details about you
[1:09:35] but it is something much deeper than
[1:09:38] these characteristics here
[1:09:40] it's that seed that was on the inside
[1:09:42] that seed that come forth from the loins
[1:09:45] this
[1:09:45] this right here on the outside it bears
[1:09:48] the image and reflection
[1:09:49] of brown and browning and all of those
[1:09:51] mixtures down through
[1:09:53] down through the town same way with you
[1:09:55] but there is a part
[1:09:56] a deposit on the inside that browning
[1:09:58] nor brown
[1:09:59] nor anybody else can actually bring that
[1:10:02] forth
[1:10:02] mom and dad help me raise me tell me
[1:10:05] what's right
[1:10:06] point me in the right way but it takes
[1:10:08] god himself
[1:10:09] to come by his own life and raise up
[1:10:12] that life
[1:10:13] on the inside and bring forth a real son
[1:10:16] of god
[1:10:17] in god god gives birth to sons and
[1:10:20] daughters of god
[1:10:21] a church does not give birth to sons and
[1:10:24] daughters of god
[1:10:25] but it takes god in the church to give
[1:10:27] birth
[1:10:28] to sons and daughters of god amen is
[1:10:31] that right
[1:10:32] right so the real you and me
[1:10:35] as soon as we took that
[1:10:38] that breath of life brother ram tells us
[1:10:41] in god rich in mercy
[1:10:42] that seed of god was placed within us
[1:10:44] then
[1:10:53] genesis 2 21 and the lord god calls the
[1:10:56] deep sleep to fall upon adam
[1:10:59] and he slept and he took one of his ribs
[1:11:02] and closed up the flesh instead thereof
[1:11:04] and the ground which the lord god
[1:11:06] had taken the rib which the lord had
[1:11:08] taken from man
[1:11:09] made he a woman and brought her unto the
[1:11:12] man
[1:11:12] and adam said this is now bone of my
[1:11:15] bones
[1:11:16] flesh in my flesh she shall be called
[1:11:19] woman
[1:11:19] because she was taken out of man woman
[1:11:22] is
[1:11:22] womb of man womb of
[1:11:26] man she shall be called woman
[1:11:30] because she was taken out of man
[1:11:33] therefore shall a man leave his father
[1:11:36] and his mother and shall cleave unto his
[1:11:38] wife
[1:11:38] and they shall be one flesh so man what
[1:11:41] did adam unite with
[1:11:43] adam united with what came from within
[1:11:46] him
[1:11:48] he united with that which god brought
[1:11:51] from
[1:11:52] within him woman womb of man
[1:11:56] notice this womb you see this this
[1:11:59] brings the election
[1:12:00] of god to light in our life it's that
[1:12:04] elected
[1:12:04] seed on the inside that comes
[1:12:07] predestinated
[1:12:08] from god not the person
[1:12:11] the seed on the inside god knew all
[1:12:14] those other parts as we said
[1:12:16] about you but remember it's that seed on
[1:12:19] the inside
[1:12:20] that seed that being part of him that
[1:12:23] being of his word
[1:12:24] that being from within him that is the
[1:12:27] womb
[1:12:28] the betting ground that he comes to
[1:12:31] plant
[1:12:31] his quickening power in
[1:12:36] now think of this that seed itself this
[1:12:39] is why brother brown would say
[1:12:41] that soul is that real gift from god
[1:12:45] that soul is the real gift from god amen
[1:12:49] remember your soul is the nature of the
[1:12:52] spirit
[1:12:53] is that right and god god don't want
[1:12:56] that first one
[1:12:59] are you with me god ain't trying to you
[1:13:01] know clean him up and
[1:13:03] man we're going to make him a good
[1:13:04] bedding ground i'll tell you there's
[1:13:05] been an awful lot of
[1:13:06] junk planning in this batting ground but
[1:13:07] this is my bedding ground nope god said
[1:13:09] i'm that's not my bedding ground that's
[1:13:12] the betting ground of your first husband
[1:13:15] your first nature right now is that
[1:13:17] right
[1:13:18] that's why the new birth ain't trying to
[1:13:20] clean up the ground and make it look
[1:13:21] pretty
[1:13:22] amen being born again means a complete
[1:13:25] transformation
[1:13:26] it's to raise up that seed that is that
[1:13:30] of a virgin
[1:13:31] life because jesus christ is the high
[1:13:34] priest
[1:13:35] and he can't marry somebody who's
[1:13:36] already married
[1:13:38] is that right he can only marry a virgin
[1:13:41] is that right
[1:13:42] so he takes him to raise that up after
[1:13:45] he deals with the first one
[1:13:47] this is god preparing the heart first
[1:13:50] notice
[1:13:50] brother em said the first son adam
[1:13:54] was the spoken seed word of god he was
[1:13:57] given a bride
[1:13:58] to reproduce himself
[1:14:04] himself so
[1:14:08] what would she be called adam
[1:14:12] the bible says when he called their name
[1:14:15] adam amen but after the fall
[1:14:18] she received other seed is where she got
[1:14:22] her own name
[1:14:23] eve mother of all living
[1:14:26] but you never find god saying adam is
[1:14:28] the father of all living
[1:14:30] because adam was not the father of all
[1:14:33] living right
[1:14:34] cain was of that wicked one
[1:14:37] all right is that right
[1:14:41] but abel and seth those are sons of god
[1:14:45] he was given a bride to reproduce
[1:14:47] himself now the bride could not
[1:14:49] reproduce him on her own she is the womb
[1:14:53] that which comes from him that is why
[1:14:55] the bride
[1:14:56] was given to him to reproduce himself to
[1:14:59] produce another son of god
[1:15:01] now notice how paul will pick this up in
[1:15:03] first corinthians 11.
[1:15:04] you notice how paul would write about
[1:15:06] this union he'll write about it
[1:15:07] in ephesians 5 he'll write about it here
[1:15:10] in the book of corinthians
[1:15:11] paul will write of it and depict to you
[1:15:13] and i
[1:15:14] that of the spiritual bringing it down
[1:15:16] to the natural and then right back into
[1:15:18] the spiritual watch how paul
[1:15:19] would place this here in first
[1:15:21] corinthians 11 7
[1:15:22] for a man indeed ought not to cover his
[1:15:25] head
[1:15:26] for as much as he is the image and glory
[1:15:29] of god but the woman is the glory of the
[1:15:33] man
[1:15:34] so the woman is to be what the
[1:15:35] reflection of the man
[1:15:38] remember whatever a man chooses for a
[1:15:40] wife shows what's in his heart
[1:15:43] that's right if he chooses some woman
[1:15:45] that runs around
[1:15:46] doesn't care and this and that it shows
[1:15:48] what's in his heart
[1:15:50] because he's making a choice it is a
[1:15:52] reflection
[1:15:53] of his heart so then to see this
[1:15:57] of how that the woman just like the moon
[1:16:00] the moon has no light of her own
[1:16:02] but the moon is to do what give forth
[1:16:04] the light of the sun
[1:16:06] in its absence so the moon
[1:16:09] is that of the wife to that of the son
[1:16:12] the husband so the woman is the glory
[1:16:16] of the man for the man notice how paul
[1:16:18] bringing this in the spirit you're going
[1:16:19] clear back
[1:16:20] there into genesis for the man is not of
[1:16:23] the woman
[1:16:23] but the woman of the man neither was the
[1:16:27] man
[1:16:27] created for the woman but the woman for
[1:16:31] the man for this cause ought the woman
[1:16:34] to have
[1:16:34] power on her head because of the angels
[1:16:38] what a fitting thing
[1:16:39] that paul would place in here paul would
[1:16:41] deal with the part
[1:16:42] in the spiritual aspect it is not that
[1:16:44] god has come from us
[1:16:46] we've come from god is that right it is
[1:16:49] not that oh
[1:16:50] that god's been created for us no we
[1:16:53] were made
[1:16:54] we were made we were created for him
[1:16:57] that we would yield forth lives that are
[1:17:00] surrendered in worship and adoration
[1:17:02] it was not about notice the principle
[1:17:05] here our lives a real true christian's
[1:17:07] life
[1:17:08] it's not about their own will or serving
[1:17:10] their own purpose
[1:17:11] but it's coming back in to the
[1:17:13] submissiveness the subjection
[1:17:15] to the real reality that i'm not here on
[1:17:18] this earth
[1:17:19] to do my own will i'm here to do the
[1:17:22] will
[1:17:22] of almighty god in other words you
[1:17:25] recognize you're a pilgrim
[1:17:26] and a stranger you deny yourself you
[1:17:30] take up your cross and you follow him
[1:17:32] you realize
[1:17:33] this life that god has given me is a
[1:17:36] life to live for his glory
[1:17:38] amen this is real christianity
[1:17:42] not serving god for what while he can
[1:17:44] better your life
[1:17:46] that's that's not christianity amen
[1:17:49] truly serving the lord truly walking
[1:17:52] even
[1:17:52] in the light of the word even by that of
[1:17:54] a human faith can it benefit a lot sure
[1:17:57] it can keep a life out of a lot of
[1:17:58] trouble but you know god's desire
[1:18:00] is that they would get clear down here
[1:18:02] on the inside where it's not just
[1:18:04] up here in your mind oh i shouldn't do
[1:18:06] this and yeah i better not be i can't do
[1:18:08] that yet
[1:18:08] this is not a i can't do that it's not
[1:18:10] according to the word i can't do no but
[1:18:12] god wants to bring it
[1:18:13] so it's so much deeper from that of a
[1:18:15] mind of sanctification
[1:18:17] to where it moves to the inside it's no
[1:18:20] longer
[1:18:20] i can't it's the thing of i can't but i
[1:18:23] don't want to
[1:18:24] i don't want to do that i want to do
[1:18:27] only
[1:18:27] those things which please him amen
[1:18:32] for this cause notice i would bring this
[1:18:34] down for this calls out the woman
[1:18:36] to have power on her head because of the
[1:18:39] angels notice this word power
[1:18:41] is excusia it's a sign of authority
[1:18:44] a sign of authority which is position
[1:18:47] it's position
[1:18:49] what puts our position into a reality
[1:18:54] the dunamis the quickening power of god
[1:18:57] because see as we minister we minister
[1:19:00] the exclusion
[1:19:02] you're sons and daughters of god
[1:19:04] ministering that
[1:19:05] by the dunamis of god are you with me
[1:19:08] it's calling you behold behold beloved
[1:19:11] what manner it is what manner of love
[1:19:13] that god bestowed upon us
[1:19:15] what's god doing he's calling to sons
[1:19:18] and daughters of god
[1:19:19] now you couldn't sit here in your life
[1:19:21] and you know drinking smoking and all
[1:19:23] kinds of habits in your life and
[1:19:25] doing this and that and saying well
[1:19:26] praise god he said i'm a son of god
[1:19:28] that's right he's telling you you've got
[1:19:31] rights and stop
[1:19:32] living beneath your privilege you've got
[1:19:35] a position
[1:19:36] that you're called to then what do i do
[1:19:38] say god
[1:19:39] let the dunamis the holy ghost come down
[1:19:42] lord
[1:19:43] and bring me into the exclusion the
[1:19:45] authority
[1:19:46] of the son and daughter of god that i
[1:19:48] belong in
[1:19:50] that's right amen somebody's going to
[1:19:52] let you know who you are
[1:19:54] is that right then you can know your
[1:19:55] privileges your rights are ministered to
[1:19:58] you
[1:19:58] then you can ask for him who ministers
[1:20:00] to rights take me in lord
[1:20:02] amen you see this is why when you look
[1:20:05] at it power on her head
[1:20:06] why would paul deal with hair why would
[1:20:09] paul deal with hair here
[1:20:11] and paul would deal with it here in the
[1:20:12] scripture and say if it's cut you'd be
[1:20:14] better enough to have it shorn why would
[1:20:16] paul deal look what he says here for
[1:20:18] this calls out the woman
[1:20:19] to have power on her head because of the
[1:20:22] angels think of how god
[1:20:24] would allow these things intact now in
[1:20:26] type how that here
[1:20:28] we recognize the veil itself that even a
[1:20:30] woman would put on in the old testament
[1:20:32] when a woman would wear a veil it showed
[1:20:35] she was under
[1:20:35] authority when rebecca came to isaac she
[1:20:39] veiled herself
[1:20:40] showing she was under authority
[1:20:43] of the word of the promise to meet
[1:20:46] isaac that came by eliezer so when she
[1:20:49] came
[1:20:50] and she asked eliezer who is this man he
[1:20:53] says
[1:20:53] this is my master i said she veiled
[1:20:56] herself and she leaped off of
[1:21:00] the camel now paul paul brings this veil
[1:21:03] and ties the veil in that it is that of
[1:21:05] long hair what's long hair
[1:21:07] uncut hair now how would this be notice
[1:21:10] for the sisters themselves
[1:21:11] notice how this is it's a reflection of
[1:21:14] the sisters yet
[1:21:15] this speaks beyond just sisters it
[1:21:19] speaks to both
[1:21:20] male and female in the spiritual
[1:21:24] because the woman is to have power on
[1:21:27] her head because of what
[1:21:29] the angels not capital a
[1:21:32] lowercase a angels the messengers
[1:21:37] messengers are who messengers of god
[1:21:41] the messengers of god that would carry
[1:21:44] the message what message are they
[1:21:45] carrying
[1:21:46] the message the testimony of jesus
[1:21:49] christ
[1:21:49] that of god's own life whoever they're
[1:21:52] carrying it it's being broadcast to all
[1:21:54] but there is an ordained betting ground
[1:21:58] that when that life would come into that
[1:22:01] bedding ground think of it
[1:22:02] though our sisters would have long hair
[1:22:04] but think of it for
[1:22:05] every brethren's brother and sister
[1:22:08] every male and female
[1:22:10] every one of us must be born of the holy
[1:22:13] ghost
[1:22:14] we must all be adorned with the headship
[1:22:17] of jesus christ the word it's not just
[1:22:20] that which is shown an outward sign
[1:22:23] there upon our sisters
[1:22:24] but it ought to be an adornment about
[1:22:27] our life there is authority
[1:22:29] power on our head we are under the
[1:22:32] authority
[1:22:32] of the gospel of jesus christ
[1:22:36] is that right so it's not the identity
[1:22:38] of our first birth any longer it's the
[1:22:40] identity of the new birth
[1:22:42] this is why paul would go on and write
[1:22:44] in verse 11 nevertheless neither is the
[1:22:46] man without the woman neither
[1:22:47] the woman without the man and the lord
[1:22:49] for as the woman is of the man even so
[1:22:52] is the man also by the woman but all
[1:22:55] things of god notice how paul
[1:22:56] brought that all down then after the
[1:22:58] fall here we come man of woman and woman
[1:23:00] woman there of man we must all as he
[1:23:03] goes on and say
[1:23:04] in galatians 3 28 there is neither jew
[1:23:06] nor greek there is neither bond or free
[1:23:08] there is neither male nor female
[1:23:10] for ye are all one in christ jesus
[1:23:15] is that right and yet being all to all
[1:23:18] one in christ jesus
[1:23:19] god himself has said that the woman is
[1:23:21] not to handle the word
[1:23:23] i suffer not for a woman to teach or
[1:23:25] assert authority over a man
[1:23:27] why he comes clear back from there from
[1:23:30] eden but it is also
[1:23:31] an expression now listen to me now
[1:23:34] brothers
[1:23:35] if the woman is to be the real daughter
[1:23:38] of god
[1:23:38] is to be an expression a type there
[1:23:41] of the bride of jesus christ what does
[1:23:44] that call for you and i to be
[1:23:48] hello husbands love your wives
[1:23:51] even as christ so loved the church
[1:23:56] glory be to god you say lord jesus
[1:24:00] those are big shoes to fill but there's
[1:24:01] a great big god that can help you
[1:24:05] amen notice bill graham says your heart
[1:24:08] is a wound i love this quote your heart
[1:24:10] is a wound he said you know what i'm
[1:24:12] speaking of men and women
[1:24:13] your heart is the wound and the womb
[1:24:15] holds the seed
[1:24:16] the seed is the gospel now the seed
[1:24:18] alone in its heart
[1:24:20] no matter how many gamilias you set
[1:24:22] under no matter how great your pastor is
[1:24:25] how much you've read the bible it'll
[1:24:27] never take life
[1:24:28] until the germ of life has come to it
[1:24:31] look how he says this
[1:24:32] a woman's seed is a wonderful thing
[1:24:36] it's the building of the body
[1:24:39] but it has no life
[1:24:42] it can't it's impossible it has
[1:24:46] it has no life to begin with so no
[1:24:49] matter how much you know the bible
[1:24:51] how well it is in your heart you're
[1:24:53] still a sinner
[1:24:55] a woman's seed is a wonderful thing
[1:24:59] notice
[1:24:59] what happened the heart is the womb and
[1:25:01] faith cometh by an open ear
[1:25:03] that's not been sealed by theology faith
[1:25:06] coming by hearing to hear
[1:25:07] the word comes into the mind you make up
[1:25:10] your mind about it look how this is look
[1:25:12] how simple
[1:25:13] is that right could that be right well
[1:25:16] the bible said so
[1:25:18] i believe it down in the heart it goes
[1:25:23] then it's a wound we are the bride the
[1:25:27] woman
[1:25:27] the seed goes into the church
[1:25:31] what does the seed go the seed goes into
[1:25:34] the woman's seed
[1:25:36] he gave you a seed it's that seed
[1:25:40] of god that lay within you
[1:25:43] it's a building of a body but it has no
[1:25:47] life in it of its own it only has
[1:25:49] potential
[1:25:50] is that right but when that life comes
[1:25:52] into it the betting ground
[1:25:54] it raises that up and that betting
[1:25:57] ground becomes a temple
[1:26:00] a habitation that god can make himself
[1:26:03] known through
[1:26:05] amen it becomes a word that's being
[1:26:08] expressed for your life it becomes the
[1:26:10] faith of god
[1:26:11] that begins to be expressed through your
[1:26:13] life that anybody ever
[1:26:15] when you plant something how many of you
[1:26:16] are planted something in your life
[1:26:18] planted something okay i know you did
[1:26:20] really you're telling me them tomatoes
[1:26:22] this year
[1:26:23] when you go to plant them you know the
[1:26:25] tomatoes do you have to go out there
[1:26:26] over top the tomatoes when you planted
[1:26:28] them
[1:26:28] and and i don't know what kind you
[1:26:29] planted but let's just say you planted
[1:26:30] burpee big boys
[1:26:31] and you planted them and said now listen

[1:26:36] understand

[1:26:42] how you're supposed to grow
[1:26:43] you're supposed to do this and you're
[1:26:45] supposed to do that
[1:26:47] i can still see your eyes i mean i'll be
[1:26:49] able to see your mouth but i can see
[1:26:50] your eyes
[1:26:52] you probably look at me and thinking you
[1:26:54] go do that you're crazy
[1:26:57] you don't go out there and talk to
[1:26:58] plants furthermore
[1:27:01] you don't have to tell the big boy
[1:27:03] tomatoes
[1:27:04] how to produce big boy tomatoes
[1:27:07] you don't have to tell them how to grow
[1:27:11] are you with me you don't have to tell
[1:27:13] the aroma to
[1:27:14] tomato plants or the cherry tomato
[1:27:16] plants now you're only supposed to grow
[1:27:18] like big boys
[1:27:18] you're supposed to scream hey romans

[1:27:21] that
[1:27:22] where is that authority at
[1:27:27] it's in the sea all it needs is the
[1:27:30] quickening power
[1:27:33] to release what's already there and good
[1:27:36] works
[1:27:37] come out here comes a vine growing there
[1:27:39] here comes a vine growing here
[1:27:40] it shoots out there but blossom here you
[1:27:43] don't have to go
[1:27:44] and tell it what to do and grow only
[1:27:45] this much and how you should be growing
[1:27:47] this much you don't have to do that the
[1:27:49] only thing you've got to do is make sure
[1:27:51] it's positioned in light and you water
[1:27:54] it
[1:27:56] the leaves the vines the tomatoes
[1:27:59] are already in it just give it time in
[1:28:03] its position
[1:28:05] amen he shall perfect that which
[1:28:08] concerns me
[1:28:10] [Music]

[1:28:39] and in the blood comes the germ of life

[1:29:36] you know all the different the the four
[1:29:38] different types of ground

[1:29:44] 44. then he said all that the father has
[1:29:47] given me will come to me

[1:29:51] know who it is and who it isn't
[1:29:54] all that i'm responsible for
[1:29:58] is spreading it it's sowing it
[1:30:02] it's preaching the word there's good
[1:30:04] ground
[1:30:05] that it's prepared for let me just say
[1:30:08] it to you right now
[1:30:09] there's good ground that it's prepared
[1:30:11] for even when god would come around
[1:30:13] and god might take a message like this
[1:30:16] or it might be another knee that you've
[1:30:18] got in your life
[1:30:19] that you need lord i need direction
[1:30:21] right now in this situation
[1:30:23] already you've got the faith of god
[1:30:25] moving in your life you pass
[1:30:26] from death unto life but you've got a
[1:30:28] need maybe it's a need for healing in
[1:30:30] your body
[1:30:31] maybe it's a need lord i need to know
[1:30:33] what direction do i take maybe you're
[1:30:34] between two or three
[1:30:36] jobs lord what direction do i take lord
[1:30:38] i need direction
[1:30:39] i need guidance on this and you know
[1:30:42] what
[1:30:43] god is mindful and present to drop
[1:30:47] into the betting ground what you have
[1:30:49] needed
[1:30:50] now he may not tell you take job a he
[1:30:53] can if he wants to
[1:30:55] he may not tell you take job b he may
[1:30:58] not tell you
[1:31:00] oh those test results they'll all turn
[1:31:03] out negative
[1:31:04] he may not tell you that but what he
[1:31:06] might drop down is say
[1:31:08] i'm the lord that healeth thee now you
[1:31:11] might look at it or me would say
[1:31:13] praise god no suffering
[1:31:16] and yet god didn't mean that
[1:31:20] maybe it meant 12 months from now
[1:31:24] 15 months from now brother brown tells
[1:31:26] us there's a sister standing there in
[1:31:28] the congregation
[1:31:30] i think it's 1964 just once more lord
[1:31:33] when you study many many of the months i
[1:31:35] just studying on healing and healing and
[1:31:37] just kept
[1:31:37] studying some of things we were bringing
[1:31:38] in the finally we broke into the first
[1:31:40] part of the year
[1:31:41] and you find how at times that here was
[1:31:43] a woman the spirit of god would speak
[1:31:44] out she was dealing with nervousness
[1:31:46] dealing with all kinds of conditions in
[1:31:48] her life and the spirit of god spoke out
[1:31:50] and said sister
[1:31:51] that nervousness god has healed you from
[1:31:53] that nervousness
[1:31:57] he says go god will bring it to pass
[1:32:03] 18 months later she stands up and
[1:32:05] testifies
[1:32:06] brother branham what god spoke to you
[1:32:09] that day
[1:32:10] god has brought it to pass in my life
[1:32:14] you think there wasn't days that she
[1:32:16] didn't get down
[1:32:17] sure there were days that she got down
[1:32:20] and discouraged you think there weren't
[1:32:21] days
[1:32:22] that there weren't thoughts that didn't
[1:32:23] come our way but what was it
[1:32:25] that motivated her what was it that gave
[1:32:28] her strength
[1:32:29] it was the faith of god regarding the
[1:32:31] promise
[1:32:32] i'm the lord that healeth thee what was
[1:32:35] god doing throughout all that listen
[1:32:37] fred so many times
[1:32:38] we miss what god is showing us by just
[1:32:41] looking at
[1:32:42] the outcome and we act as though
[1:32:45] lord where you at where you're at in the
[1:32:47] midst of it god was right there with her
[1:32:49] he said i'll never leave you nor forsake
[1:32:51] you
[1:32:52] when you're going through a trial he
[1:32:54] don't leave you at the door
[1:32:55] and walk around to this door he walks
[1:32:58] right there with you
[1:32:59] he went through the fire with the hebrew
[1:33:01] children
[1:33:03] he meant what he said he's there with
[1:33:06] you
[1:33:08] but this is where times come faith
[1:33:11] is trust
[1:33:15] trust doesn't need to know god you
[1:33:17] promised me i ain't never gonna get sick
[1:33:19] god you promised me this let me then
[1:33:21] they trust
[1:33:24] trust is lord this is what you said in
[1:33:27] your word
[1:33:29] and faith listen isn't you and i making
[1:33:31] ourselves it isn't that
[1:33:32] it's where that drops in our heart
[1:33:35] anybody know what i'm talking about
[1:33:37] i mean when things drop in your heart
[1:33:38] it's just it's peace right
[1:33:40] it's peace even in the midst of the
[1:33:42] storm even in the midst of what
[1:33:43] one with the things that we're dealing
[1:33:45] with but i'm saying you've got peace yes
[1:33:46] let's say do you have a promise that you
[1:33:48] won't get sick i don't have that
[1:33:50] promise i'm not standing here because
[1:33:52] i've got that promise
[1:33:53] right are you with me or you must stay
[1:33:56] in your house and i don't stay in the
[1:33:57] house
[1:33:58] i don't have a promise when i get in my
[1:34:00] vehicle that i won't get in an accident
[1:34:03] by the way there's a high more highly
[1:34:05] likely likelihood i die from an accident
[1:34:08] are you with me i don't listen to me
[1:34:10] faith is not we're going to say
[1:34:12] you're a young man you're 45 years old
[1:34:14] you don't have to worry about this that
[1:34:15] is not faith
[1:34:18] i said that's not faith that's not trust
[1:34:21] trust is i belong to him
[1:34:24] and the peace that he gives i don't have
[1:34:27] to have that promise me this god
[1:34:29] if you promise me this god i'll do this
[1:34:31] if you promise me this god i'll do this
[1:34:33] that's not faith
[1:34:37] but it's trust that's what god asked us
[1:34:40] to do trust him
[1:34:42] amen how can you can't give that to
[1:34:44] yourself i can't give it to myself
[1:34:46] it has to come from him does it make us
[1:34:49] bigger than anybody else
[1:34:50] not a bit it makes you thankful
[1:34:54] it makes you thankful lord thank you
[1:34:56] lord for your peace
[1:34:59] thank you lord for your peace
[1:35:02] let me try to bring this down it's good
[1:35:05] ground that god
[1:35:06] is looking for that that word notice in
[1:35:09] acts chapter 13 verse 48
[1:35:11] when the gentiles heard this they were
[1:35:14] glad
[1:35:15] and glorified the word of the lord and
[1:35:17] as many
[1:35:18] as were ordained to eternal life
[1:35:21] believed amen and the word of the lord
[1:35:25] was published throughout all the region
[1:35:27] notice those who were ordained
[1:35:30] to eternal life believed first
[1:35:32] thessalonians 2 13
[1:35:33] for this cause also think we god without
[1:35:36] ceasing because
[1:35:37] when ye received the word of god which
[1:35:40] he heard
[1:35:41] of us ye received it not as the word of
[1:35:45] men but as it is in truth the word of
[1:35:48] god
[1:35:49] which effectually worketh also
[1:35:52] in you that belief the word finding a
[1:35:56] betting ground
[1:35:57] in a heart and it goes to work
[1:36:02] what does it do it produces
[1:36:05] just what he said in that word
[1:36:08] amen it goes to work it shows itself
[1:36:12] operative first peter 1
[1:36:16] 22 seeing you have purified look at this
[1:36:20] seeing ye hath purified your
[1:36:24] souls in obeying the truth
[1:36:28] through the spirit unto unfeigned love
[1:36:31] of the brethren
[1:36:33] see that ye love one another with a pure
[1:36:35] heart fervently
[1:36:37] being born again not of corruptible seed
[1:36:41] but of incorruptible by the word of god
[1:36:45] which liveth and abideth forever
[1:36:50] the seed of god god's own life
[1:36:54] coming into that betting ground notice
[1:36:57] what peter would write
[1:36:58] seeing you have purified
[1:37:01] your souls staggering
[1:37:04] god dealing with your life it's time and
[1:37:06] the word is being sounded
[1:37:08] here you are being drawn i don't mean
[1:37:10] you're in a church
[1:37:12] brother man tells us that voice that
[1:37:14] spoke to you when you're on the bar
[1:37:15] store
[1:37:16] and said what are you doing here
[1:37:21] that same voice that spoke there
[1:37:25] hey listen you sound a bar stool that
[1:37:27] same voice spoke to our prophet
[1:37:29] when he was carrying water
[1:37:32] for the moonshine steel right right
[1:37:36] glory be to god
[1:37:40] it spoke to your heart it begins to call
[1:37:43] you
[1:37:44] it begins to draw it isn't necessarily
[1:37:46] like my voice it could sound
[1:37:48] it could be an audible voice like this
[1:37:50] or something that maybe even would speak
[1:37:52] in your heart
[1:37:53] but then again it might just be the
[1:37:55] sounding of his voice that things start
[1:37:57] to turn
[1:37:58] and you look in and say what am i doing
[1:38:02] here
[1:38:04] there's something more than this
[1:38:07] something what's happening it's god
[1:38:11] calling you it's god dealing
[1:38:14] trying to get bring you into place
[1:38:17] where you need to be and so god is
[1:38:20] working and here
[1:38:21] you begin to notice purify your soul
[1:38:27] purify my soul you mean my soul is what
[1:38:29] i'm going to offer up to god
[1:38:30] no god wants it to come completely in
[1:38:32] line and then god kills it
[1:38:34] and then god raises up that seed on the
[1:38:37] inside
[1:38:38] are you with me god brings it completely
[1:38:41] in line
[1:38:41] with his word but you purifying your
[1:38:45] soul
[1:38:46] unto what obeying the truth
[1:38:50] you see friends it goes to everybody
[1:38:52] whether you're on the internet or
[1:38:53] wherever
[1:38:54] the holy ghost the bible says god giveth
[1:38:57] his spirit
[1:38:58] to them who obey his word
[1:39:03] if you don't obey then the spirit won't
[1:39:05] come
[1:39:06] but an obedient heart now notice that
[1:39:08] doesn't mean that oh i've got
[1:39:09] this t cross this t cross and this t
[1:39:11] cross you can sit right here this
[1:39:13] morning
[1:39:14] right here this morning and right there
[1:39:17] it moved within your heart
[1:39:18] into a place of full obedience
[1:39:22] and the spirit of god the token will
[1:39:24] come right down
[1:39:26] and ignite that there might be things
[1:39:27] that you've got to kick out and throw
[1:39:29] away
[1:39:29] when you get home or other things that
[1:39:31] you put but you see what's happened
[1:39:33] it's already been put out of here
[1:39:37] this has been lined up and then god
[1:39:39] comes down
[1:39:40] amen oh my anything precious
[1:39:43] how could we you and i could not bring
[1:39:45] ourselves into this place this is where
[1:39:47] brethren talks about the heart being
[1:39:49] prepared first throwing out that of
[1:39:50] jealousy throwing out that of bitterness
[1:39:52] throwing out different things malice and
[1:39:54] so forth within our life
[1:39:57] it's god moving god working in our life
[1:39:59] amen
[1:40:01] once you think of this as we close this
[1:40:04] bedding ground
[1:40:06] god has a way in his choosing
[1:40:11] the better ground of god's choice
[1:40:15] it has nothing to do with your flesh
[1:40:21] but is it my flesh the temple that he
[1:40:24] wants
[1:40:26] remember there are three chambers in a
[1:40:29] temple
[1:40:31] from the tabernacle in the wilderness to
[1:40:34] solomon's temple
[1:40:36] there's three the glory of god did not
[1:40:40] come down
[1:40:41] in the outer court the glory of god did
[1:40:44] not come in
[1:40:45] and down into that inner court or that
[1:40:49] holy place but the glory of god came
[1:40:52] down into the holiest of holies
[1:40:55] when it came down there on the mercy
[1:40:58] seat
[1:41:00] it would come in there when everything
[1:41:02] was right in its position
[1:41:04] it would come down and remember the
[1:41:07] coming down of his presence
[1:41:09] was the signifying it's finished
[1:41:13] this is a finished work
[1:41:18] it's the same thing within our life it's
[1:41:21] not the flesh
[1:41:22] god doesn't choose based on our flesh
[1:41:26] this is why paul would write he said you
[1:41:29] see that there's not many mighty
[1:41:30] many noble many rich but quite the
[1:41:34] contrary
[1:41:35] god would choose base things of the
[1:41:38] world
[1:41:39] things of the world that people would
[1:41:41] say write them off
[1:41:45] people that in the scripture could not
[1:41:48] come to the well
[1:41:50] but a certain time of the day
[1:41:54] but you see god chooses because out here
[1:41:58] people could look and say oh my no this
[1:42:01] person will never
[1:42:02] never never but what they underestimate
[1:42:04] is
[1:42:05] and don't know is there's a betting
[1:42:08] ground on the inside
[1:42:11] and that bedding ground when god can get
[1:42:13] everything else lined up
[1:42:14] and bring it in line in agreeance with
[1:42:16] him
[1:42:17] then god kills that and he moves right
[1:42:20] into the inside
[1:42:22] what is that seed that's the womb
[1:42:25] that's the seed that which came from god
[1:42:29] and god steps down and he veils himself
[1:42:32] in that life this is why when god has
[1:42:35] veiled in your life in that bedding
[1:42:37] ground
[1:42:38] this is why the spirit of god would say
[1:42:40] mortify
[1:42:42] the members of your body this is why him
[1:42:45] reigning on the inside would tell us
[1:42:48] you can't keep evil thoughts from coming
[1:42:50] but you can keep him from building nests
[1:42:53] is that right this reigning and dwelling
[1:42:56] on the inside is where you say you know
[1:42:58] what
[1:42:59] the same god that's dwelling in the
[1:43:00] habitation his
[1:43:02] habitation a body he prepared for
[1:43:05] himself
[1:43:07] a body he prepared for himself a womb
[1:43:11] a seed and his life emanating from that
[1:43:14] life
[1:43:14] the shekinah glory what does it do when
[1:43:18] that moving the love of god moving in
[1:43:19] our heart
[1:43:20] this is why this is why
[1:43:24] we do the things that we do we don't do
[1:43:27] it because we have to
[1:43:29] we do it because of his presence
[1:43:33] our love for him our desire that
[1:43:36] he would dwell within our life he would
[1:43:39] live
[1:43:40] so freely through our life right amen
[1:43:43] this is why
[1:43:45] oh i'm so thankful for that amen i'm so
[1:43:48] thankful for that
[1:43:50] let's pray
[1:44:01] [Music]

[1:58:08] we want to just have a word of prayer
[1:58:09] here
[1:58:11] brother ryan i think it was i mentioned
[1:58:14] to you earlier
[1:58:15] it was on august and right after a
[1:58:19] the ryan had texted me and i know that
[1:58:22] it was back in the day one of the
[1:58:23] january
[1:58:24] january year from our year almost
[1:58:28] where the lord had started to deal with
[1:58:30] his heart
[1:58:31] and just like we were talking about this
[1:58:33] morning where here you are
[1:58:35] you're staggering in a place but it's
[1:58:37] god
[1:58:38] it's god bleeding it's god turning the
[1:58:41] heart it's god dealing with the light
[1:58:43] and so you know as we spoke to him on
[1:58:46] the phone and
[1:58:46] we went through things and i was just
[1:58:49] talking to him and i said you know
[1:58:51] the way god does something i said you
[1:58:53] know you when you're going to build a
[1:58:54] house that said you just don't go on the
[1:58:56] ground
[1:58:57] and you start building that house i said
[1:58:59] but you've got to go on the ground and
[1:59:01] you've got to clear
[1:59:02] the ground out first a lot of work i
[1:59:04] said that goes into that ground to make

[1:59:21] it's very essential
[1:59:22] then it just keeps on going with things
[1:59:24] you start building
[1:59:25] from there on and so it's the same way
[1:59:28] god working in your life it's
[1:59:30] now clearing that ground it's god
[1:59:33] getting ready to put a foundation
[1:59:35] there are things that we talked about on
