[38:31] this verse of scripture proverbs 18:22
[38:35] and then we'll let you have your seats
[38:38] it said whoso findeth a wife findeth a
[38:43] good thing and obtaineth favor of the
[38:50] lord
[38:51] amen may God bless His Word and bless
[38:54] you as you're being seated so good to
[39:00] see CH and every one of you and a man
[39:03] just I know the Lord rewards you for
[39:05] your sacrifice many some of you coming
[39:07] straight from work and other places and
[39:09] may God just richly bless you for your
[39:13] labor of love and being here because you
[39:16] you've come here to receive from him
[39:18] that's what we've all come for tonight
[39:20] we love it so literally we love seeing
[39:22] one another we appreciate that we love
[39:24] being in his presence we've come to
[39:26] receive from him tonight and we've not
[39:29] only come to receive but we've also come
[39:31] to give is that right we come to give we
[39:35] come to put our our shoulder to the
[39:37] we'll look a fire in our hearts that God
[39:40] would just come among us in a special
[39:42] way we're looking at this scripture here
[39:46] and when we are looking at it I don't
[39:50] know so much tonight whether I'm gonna
[39:52] preach to preach some things or just
[39:54] teach some things we'll just see how it
[39:55] kind of goes tonight but and when I look
[39:59] at this here in the scripture he who
[40:02] finds a wife we recognized that where we
[40:06] were at when we've been looking at this
[40:07] in the time where God Himself has been
[40:12] taking a people for his namesake among
[40:15] the Gentiles when Joseph was put was put
[40:19] out from among his brethren he was given
[40:22] the Bible says a wife and to know that
[40:25] that is exactly what the Lord Jesus has
[40:29] indeed been given is that of a wife a
[40:32] bride of people out of the Gentiles and
[40:36] then to recognize that as soon as our
[40:39] time is up here which were at the end
[40:41] right now we we don't know it just at
[40:44] any moment you know and I think of it
[40:46] like this you know you know God knows
[40:49] exactly and he's the one that's getting
[40:52] everything in place and in order and I'm
[40:56] so glad that that he is the one that's
[40:58] in our midst and he's the one throughout
[41:00] all of the of the earth that's setting
[41:02] everything in order
[41:03] as a matter of fact brother branham
[41:05] would say it like this regarding the
[41:07] angel of the Lord he said in 1960 in
[41:10] Daniel 70 weeks he said the angel of the
[41:12] Lord is present on earth now getting
[41:14] everything together he was there he's
[41:17] assembling the 144,000 of the Jews and
[41:20] he's also getting the bride in line in
[41:24] an order with the word in order to take
[41:26] us out of here
[41:27] everything itself is heading up within
[41:30] this hour so when we look at this
[41:32] thought that who finds a wife we
[41:35] recognize as it's very clear to us and I
[41:38] believe it should be that when a person
[41:41] when we look in the scriptures the who
[41:44] so here would be that of a man and not
[41:46] just a man but it would be that of a
[41:49] husband one who were those attributes
[41:52] that have laid within him you know like
[41:54] you take a little girl she likes playing
[41:57] house with dolls and you know serving
[42:00] make-believe food and things as long as
[42:02] she starts serving real food when she
[42:03] gets older but you know she starts out
[42:05] with make-believe food you know in the
[42:07] in the kitchens and you know she plays
[42:09] with the dolls and you see those
[42:11] attributes that are already there within
[42:14] her but yet within its season those
[42:18] things that were there will actually
[42:20] come into the time and season of when
[42:24] that purpose is to be brought forth and
[42:26] then when we look at that within the
[42:28] natural we recognize here in the
[42:30] scripture of where we're looking at this
[42:33] it speaks of the season of time that we
[42:37] are living in in this hour because the
[42:41] Lord the Lord Jesus is not taking unto
[42:44] himself a girl or just that of a of a
[42:49] woman he's taking one to himself that
[42:53] she possesses the attributes that he is
[42:57] seeking for because he's going to make
[42:59] his future home and to think of it that
[43:02] it's he himself he already knows what
[43:06] lays within our lives he already knows
[43:09] the season of time that we're in and
[43:12] let's just be her and
[43:14] in that you and I have been sold with
[43:16] that word predestinated seed of God God
[43:20] already has out what is taking place
[43:22] right now is something that God has
[43:25] already laid out in his word it's not
[43:28] something strange or new that he's doing
[43:31] but God is actually fulfilling what he
[43:35] already spoke and so we're in a season
[43:38] and time of fulfillment and it is a
[43:41] blessing to be able that our eyes would
[43:45] be open and you might say I don't see
[43:47] everything but remember don't let the
[43:49] devil get you all scattered about that
[43:51] it's to recognize that first and
[43:54] foremost you see that there is a
[43:56] difference and you recognize that the
[43:59] word in itself this is not just
[44:01] something good to be followed but you
[44:04] recognize that this is the very person
[44:07] of Jesus Christ you recognize that it is
[44:11] the Living God that it comes down and
[44:14] deals with our heart speaks to our lives
[44:17] and moves upon us because a man cannot
[44:20] know these things and I'll say like this
[44:21] even if a man even myself if I knew what
[44:25] your need might be it would be
[44:27] hard-pressed for me to fulfill it even
[44:29] if it's something within the material
[44:31] realm it would be hard-pressed for me to
[44:33] fulfill it but yet within this it takes
[44:37] something that is so much greater than
[44:40] what somebody else can supply it has to
[44:43] be God in order to supply what you and I
[44:45] need and to tell you the truth when God
[44:48] speaks to our hearts and moves on our
[44:50] life you can't explain it you can't
[44:54] explain it and this is exactly where you
[44:57] look at then a man himself would move
[45:00] into this season here to where that
[45:03] there are clear desires and clear
[45:05] objectives that he's wanting that of a
[45:08] woman that would display what is truly
[45:10] in his heart brother brems said it like
[45:13] this in the church and its condition he
[45:15] says you know love you couldn't love
[45:17] nothing that wasn't of your own nature
[45:19] loving has to unite with love and a
[45:23] husband and a wife has to love one
[45:25] another
[45:26] if they ever make the grade you know
[45:28] love itself it overlooks a multitude of
[45:31] faults is that right and we're all
[45:34] filled with faults you don't just say my
[45:36] husband or my wife every one of us are
[45:38] filled with false
[45:40] so it requires love to be able to
[45:44] overlook those faults in let's just stay
[45:45] with me a moment it not only takes love
[45:48] to overlook them but even within those
[45:50] folks sometimes the faults itself can
[45:53] just even be in the demeanor that we
[45:55] would take or even in a negative thought
[45:57] way it takes love itself to be projected
[46:00] and manifested and to wash and sanctify
[46:04] and lift us into that place to where
[46:07] what was negative no longer holds us
[46:10] captive what does that love love we'll
[46:15] do that in an in a home between a
[46:18] husband and a wife and that same love
[46:21] that operates between Christ and his
[46:24] beloved bride it elevates you and I into
[46:27] a place that we do not deserve so we can
[46:31] never look at it that we've deserved it
[46:33] but His grace has swept over our life
[46:36] and he says this is what I chose you to
[46:40] be it's just like a seed when any seed
[46:44] can only bring forth after its own kind
[46:46] but Roosevelt says now phase that a
[46:48] family has to love one another if they
[46:51] ever make the grade and he says you
[46:53] search everywhere and you find a girl to
[46:57] be your wife that you love and she
[46:59] searches finding a husband that she
[47:03] could love now I want you to notice the
[47:05] wording here not just trying to find a
[47:07] woman see Jesus remember that the branch
[47:12] el says it like this in Christ a mystery
[47:14] he said he's not revealing his truth to
[47:17] flirter
[47:19] Jesus don't want to flirt he wants
[47:21] somebody that's real somebody that's
[47:25] interested in him
[47:27] simply because of him no matter what he
[47:30] can do for you sure he's a healer he has
[47:33] all things in his disposal but it is not
[47:36] because of that
[47:38] I mean what um nobody in here would say
[47:41] if you looked up on a marriage and you
[47:43] know no doubt there may be some that you
[47:44] could know or think of where you know
[47:46] somebody married somebody simply because
[47:49] of money that ain't love
[47:51] they married not the person they married
[47:55] their bank account come on somebody but
[47:58] you see when you marry the person in no
[48:01] matter what's in that bank account but
[48:03] there is sufficient funds to be
[48:07] deposited in one another's account by
[48:09] love that can be deposited you say where
[48:12] is that account out that's in that bowl
[48:14] of the human heart brother Ram says it
[48:17] is that bowl that's there he said that
[48:19] that within your marriage it must be oil
[48:21] that is put in that bowl now remember
[48:24] oil itself is to be put in daily hello
[48:30] somebody
[48:31] oils got to be put in and continued to
[48:34] put in this is the order that the lights
[48:37] themselves stay burning and don't get
[48:43] nervous we're not just gonna settle them
[48:44] that but I believe with all my heart
[48:47] when we're preaching the Word of God I
[48:49] believe that the word it ought to come
[48:51] down to where we're living not just stay
[48:55] up here in mysteries but the mystery
[48:58] itself when broken it should come down
[49:00] to where the rubber meets the road the
[49:05] puddin is simple is like this to where
[49:07] when you leave you can pack it up in
[49:08] your lunchbox and take it with you she's
[49:13] searching for a wife ha ha ha no let me
[49:17] correct that she's searching for a
[49:19] husband that she can love and God
[49:21] searches trying to find a soul that he
[49:25] can love so he represented himself here
[49:27] on earth as a gentle dove and a gentle
[49:30] lamb and if that lamb would at one
[49:32] moment one minute ever taken on the
[49:34] nature of a snarling wolf that dove
[49:36] would have took her flight immediately
[49:38] she'd have got away because it has to be
[49:44] like nature's to unite now you and I
[49:48] both know it takes god coming by our way
[49:51] just change our nature the Bible says he
[49:56] give us a new heart and a new spirit and
[49:57] the reason of that because we couldn't
[50:00] even get along with ourselves much less
[50:01] anybody else glory be to God now when we
[50:08] look at this here in the scriptures if
[50:10] we open up here in Genesis 2 when we
[50:13] were at last week and I want you just to
[50:15] just to take this in just a moment here
[50:18] in verse 21 it says the Lord God caused
[50:22] a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he
[50:25] slept and he took one of his ribs and
[50:27] closed up the flesh instead thereof and
[50:31] the rib which the Lord God had taken
[50:33] from man made he a woman and brought her
[50:37] unto the man so he's taking from the
[50:40] substance that he's already created so
[50:44] what he's already created now he takes a
[50:47] rib from that substance now to think
[50:50] about it now when he takes from that
[50:52] substance he himself God makes a woman
[50:56] by the living substance that is already
[51:00] present is that right now what now when
[51:04] you look at this after God has brought
[51:07] her forth then he wakes Adam up from the
[51:11] sleep
[51:14] you see Adam God could see something in
[51:17] Adam and say it's not good is that right
[51:22] you said it's not good you know the
[51:24] Bible says it's not good for man to be
[51:26] alone the word alone in the Hebrew and
[51:30] it spelled out it is B ad bad that's
[51:34] what it is you can look it up to be
[51:36] alone is bad that is why he said I will
[51:39] not leave you as orphans I will send to
[51:42] you the comforter the Holy Ghost so that
[51:46] you're not alone though you may walk on
[51:49] your job and you feel alone because of
[51:53] what all you see around you but yet you
[51:56] realize I am NOT alone what it is you
[52:01] don't fit in anywhere here there's been
[52:03] life that's come in here and the life
[52:05] listen now the life coming in is what
[52:09] has brought the separation is that right
[52:14] so it's not good for man to be alone
[52:17] here God is unfolding the mystery within
[52:22] this that how that is he would lay Adams
[52:25] asleep then God brings forth and God
[52:28] makes out of the woman and then God
[52:30] brought her unto the man in the
[52:32] tremendous because the Bible said whoso
[52:35] findeth a woman find a favour with God
[52:37] it don't mean that the man's got to go
[52:40] clear across the other side of the world
[52:41] it means that the husband man who is
[52:44] coming into that season must be fit when
[52:47] he is ready for husband he will then be
[52:50] looking for attributes of wife are you
[52:54] with me that's what he's looking for
[52:56] and that's the same way that when God
[52:59] comes here in this hour he's looking for
[53:02] the attributes of life now you think
[53:05] about it here is Adam himself you know
[53:08] you you know you talk about arranged
[53:10] marriage this is Adams this is Adams
[53:13] choice but Adams choice is God's choice
[53:17] you see he got Adam did not wrestle with
[53:21] it he accepted God's choice and
[53:25] Adam himself now as he he's woke up you
[53:28] know and you realized you and I could
[53:30] say there wasn't nobody else now come on
[53:33] brothers you realize don't want nobody
[53:35] else for you come on brother Brian's got
[53:40] his hand up back there and these they
[53:43] have both of them up I got both of mine
[53:45] on there are nobody else for me is that
[53:49] right so it is just that way because you
[53:53] see a revelation if something that comes
[53:56] personal come on now
[54:00] and it don't keep study don't stop it
[54:04] becomes more real as the days go on now
[54:08] notice Adam he steps up in this time and
[54:10] he says this is now bone of my bones and
[54:13] flesh of my flesh she shall be called
[54:15] woman because she was taken out of me
[54:19] now look how look how the transitions
[54:21] taking place here in verse 24 therefore
[54:24] shall a man leave his father and his
[54:27] mother 19 just talking about him moving
[54:30] out of his house
[54:32] y'all go preach with me this ain't just
[54:35] talking about him moving out of his
[54:37] house it is well now that there is an
[54:40] establishing of his house his domain his
[54:45] kingdom
[54:47] very mem he is going to put his
[54:49] influence he is going to be that how
[54:52] there is going to be a domain of which
[54:54] he himself will be the influencer of
[54:57] that domain so here God is letting it be
[55:03] clear there's a transition where that
[55:05] man is transitioning to the role of a
[55:08] husband and one of the roles in
[55:10] transitioning is leaving everything in
[55:13] order to cleave
[55:16] unto his wife this is where the man will
[55:21] find comfort
[55:23] this is where he'll find satisfaction
[55:26] this is where when trouble comes he
[55:30] Cleaves to his wife because she will be
[55:33] a comfort unto him and vice versa
[55:37] remember birth event tells us when fear
[55:39] when things would you know the the you
[55:42] know things would take place there in
[55:44] the garden and he said you know Eve she
[55:46] said oh and Adam would say oh don't
[55:48] worry that's Leo the Lion you see he was
[55:51] one that was placed there that could
[55:54] settle her
[55:58] that's how God set it up now I know let
[56:02] me just deal with this a moment boy
[56:03] we're gonna get somewhere tonight though
[56:05] we're gonna get to her some time but you
[56:07] see sometimes you know we look at things
[56:09] let me say this to you as a man I know
[56:12] this is very simple but as a man
[56:14] sometimes we think just because we said
[56:17] it boom it all changes pow right there
[56:20] well you know what there is a word that
[56:22] comes but remember when a word goes
[56:25] forward there's a season for the word to
[56:28] come to past and there must be an
[56:31] atmosphere pressing to bring conditions
[56:34] in order for that word to be fulfilled
[56:37] that's even there is there in that
[56:40] natural home brother branham just
[56:42] couldn't say to me to say listen
[56:43] straighten up get beside yourself come
[56:45] on now gods on our side you know God is
[56:47] faithful gods on our side come on snap
[56:49] out of that he didn't do that but
[56:51] remember over and over as you know
[56:53] sometimes I would demonstrate that he
[56:55] puts on that apron and he begins to take
[56:58] the role of a servant not just because
[57:01] of the apron not just because of the
[57:03] apron not just because he was washing
[57:06] dishes he was serving her needs she
[57:10] needed him in a way to settle her
[57:14] emotionally and that's how it is with
[57:18] God working with our lives
[57:21] you see God can speak a word but now he
[57:25] comes to back that word up and when it
[57:28] comes to back that word up he provides
[57:31] the necessary atmosphere and the
[57:33] atmosphere is not an atmosphere of
[57:36] command or demand but the atmosphere is
[57:39] that which is generated from the source
[57:42] of which the word was spoken and it was
[57:45] spoken from the source of divine love so
[57:49] it's spoken from the source of divine
[57:51] love when divine love goes forth then
[57:54] what happens grace itself will step in
[57:57] and begin to produce what love has
[58:00] actually called for you see we're in an
[58:04] age and in all these things sometimes we
[58:07] don't even realize it's all around us
[58:09] that things itself goes we're in an
[58:11] seeds were even in this time we see the
[58:14] word coming to pass but let me remind
[58:16] you that the word itself even in the
[58:19] word coming to pass
[58:20] sometimes we see prayers answered and it
[58:23] seems like popcorn going off and then
[58:25] there's other times where we're praying
[58:26] and it wonder if the popcorn maker is
[58:29] even plugged in I just put it that
[58:32] simple tonight and you wonder if it
[58:34] where it's happen is that right but
[58:37] remember this is where patience comes in
[58:40] you must have patience and patience is a
[58:45] result of faith to know that this is
[58:49] God's Word regardless of my feelings
[58:51] regardless of my symptoms regardless of
[58:54] what I see or what I think God said so
[58:58] so what must we do make sure that we
[59:02] stay in an atmosphere of his love he
[59:08] shall cleave unto his wife you you can
[59:11] go through the scriptures you find that
[59:13] that that that this is where the
[59:15] satisfier is supposed to be this is why
[59:17] it's something that's entitle II off
[59:19] limits that that a man should never be
[59:21] talking to another woman about his
[59:23] problems come on somebody a woman should
[59:28] never be talking to another man about
[59:30] her problems it ought to be confining in
[59:34] one another and you know why the me just
[59:37] said like this as a husband you realize
[59:39] then don't you let the devil try to put
[59:42] one over on you yeah it's not for you
[59:44] listen to me close it's not that you've
[59:47] got to have all the answers it's that
[59:49] you know the source of all the answers
[59:53] that's what's important Joshua didn't
[59:58] have all the answers but he knew where
[1:00:01] to go
[1:00:02] Joshua 1 keep yourself in the word he
[1:00:06] kept himself in the word meditating and
[1:00:08] then when the angel of the Lord showed
[1:00:11] up with a battle plan for Jericho he
[1:00:14] recognized who it was he submitted
[1:00:16] himself and he received the leadership
[1:00:19] that when that leadership was brought
[1:00:21] back into the camp
[1:00:23] was a stability even in his words that
[1:00:26] because there would be an atmosphere now
[1:00:29] that would come upon the camp that would
[1:00:31] absolutely dispel fear you believe
[1:00:36] there's power in the Word of God I
[1:00:37] believe that with all my heart I believe
[1:00:39] there's power in the Word of God even as
[1:00:41] we are praying and looking to God so
[1:00:44] even when we come into situations in our
[1:00:46] home and I'm not going to ask you to
[1:00:48] raise your hands but how many times were
[1:00:50] we been in situations here maybe even
[1:00:52] today and you don't know what to do as a
[1:00:55] husband as a wife as a father has a
[1:00:57] mother you don't even know how to answer
[1:01:00] but remember stand still you are serving
[1:01:06] the Living God and this situation this
[1:01:11] issue you watch him come on the scene
[1:01:14] and direct it when anxiousness wants to
[1:01:18] can't wants to come up you stand there
[1:01:20] and say God himself he will not fail he
[1:01:24] will answer and that's the comfort we
[1:01:30] receive from one another
[1:01:33] think of it you realize the Lord Jesus
[1:01:36] he himself has this scripture would
[1:01:40] speak he would have a life that would be
[1:01:43] able to comfort him in this hour we're
[1:01:47] always looking at Oh us comforting him
[1:01:50] but remember the Bible said he dwelleth
[1:01:53] in the praises of his people to praise
[1:01:58] him it brings him on the scene it
[1:02:01] comforts him but brother brems says when
[1:02:04] that you know he said when that husband
[1:02:06] comes in the wife just sets him down in
[1:02:08] the chair climbs up on his lap
[1:02:12] and just tells him what a good provider
[1:02:15] he is well you're getting quiet on me
[1:02:17] well you know what will preach this five
[1:02:19] six seven fifteen twenty five times come
[1:02:22] on now you might as well say dear Jesus
[1:02:24] help me come on now but it's been the
[1:02:30] saving of my husband we'll know what's
[1:02:31] going on he might think I'm putting him
[1:02:33] in a wrestling hold you don't know what
[1:02:35] he might think come on now
[1:02:38] you understand right now the Lord Jesus
[1:02:41] he loves your attention there is nobody
[1:02:45] that makes his heart go pitter-patter
[1:02:48] rock your attention lack your praise
[1:02:52] does not just in the good Pam's but even
[1:02:57] in the times we're even you can be so
[1:02:59] unsettled but yet in the midst of you'd
[1:03:01] say Lord you're faithful yard
[1:03:06] you're good so this junk from here of
[1:03:13] marriage I just I love how it was so set
[1:03:17] forth in the scripture that God he never
[1:03:20] opened up Adams foot and took a bone
[1:03:23] from his foot because he said you shall
[1:03:26] not walk on her she's not from the sole
[1:03:30] of your feet but he said I'm gonna open
[1:03:33] up that side which is right next to your
[1:03:36] heart and God took her from right next
[1:03:40] to his heart that which he would cherish
[1:03:45] oh my so when we consider this and
[1:03:51] Sweethearts you know those were some of
[1:03:53] the first sweethearts and we look at
[1:03:55] some of these examples here in the
[1:03:57] scripture you know there are many
[1:04:00] examples that speak not only to us as
[1:04:05] husbands and wife but there is examples
[1:04:08] that speak in the scripture of where
[1:04:11] that we are living in this hour in the
[1:04:15] time of wife which the time of life is
[1:04:19] the time to make that home it's the time
[1:04:22] for there to be life to come
[1:04:25] fourth so when we look at it here in the
[1:04:27] scripture I want to just go into another
[1:04:30] place in some sweethearts here in the
[1:04:32] Bible by the name of Abraham and Sarah
[1:04:35] familiar places with us but the Bible
[1:04:38] would say it like this in Genesis 16 now
[1:04:41] Sarah hi abraham's wife bear him no
[1:04:43] children remember she was she wasn't
[1:04:45] fertile she was terrible and she had a
[1:04:48] handmaid an Egyptian whose name was
[1:04:50] Hagar and sorry I said unto Abram behold
[1:04:54] now the LORD hath restrained me from
[1:04:57] bearing now it's true that she wasn't
[1:05:01] able to bear that in itself is true and
[1:05:05] let me just say like this you know
[1:05:07] everything in itself has a timing there
[1:05:11] is a right season and there is a right
[1:05:14] time
[1:05:15] God withheld hannah from bearing he
[1:05:20] Samuel couldn't come until Eli was ready
[1:05:22] to be removed come on now John could not
[1:05:27] come to Zacharias and Elizabeth until
[1:05:30] it's ready to introduce the Messiah
[1:05:31] everything had to be just in order and
[1:05:35] God knew where that word was gonna fall
[1:05:38] in when it was going to fall and she
[1:05:44] tells Abraham I pray thee go in unto my
[1:05:46] maid it may be notice it may be there's
[1:05:51] no maybes with God that's a sure sign
[1:05:55] right there
[1:05:56] there's no maybes it may be that I may
[1:06:01] obtain children by her and Abram
[1:06:04] hearkened to the voice of Sarah I and
[1:06:08] seria Abraham's wife took Hagar her made
[1:06:11] the Egyptian after Abram had dwelt 10
[1:06:14] years in the land of Canaan and gave her
[1:06:16] to her husband Abram to be his wife to
[1:06:21] be his wife and he went into Hagar she
[1:06:24] conceived and when she saw that she had
[1:06:27] conceived her mistress was despised in
[1:06:29] her eyes and Sarah said unto Abram my
[1:06:31] wrong be upon thee I have given
[1:06:36] made into thy bosom and when she saw
[1:06:39] that she had conceived I was despised in
[1:06:42] her eyes the Lord judge between me and
[1:06:44] thee you see even though it was Serio's
[1:06:50] idea Abram listened to it so you know
[1:06:56] who was accountable
[1:06:58] he was my wrong beyond thee come on now
[1:07:05] then listen you and I have one who bears
[1:07:09] all wrong are you with me now think of
[1:07:14] this now this is why it's so careful we
[1:07:17] want to find the will of God you know a
[1:07:21] me remember our brother branham puts it
[1:07:23] within this here and that that sorry i
[1:07:26] was looking at hagar and said man she's
[1:07:29] a beautiful beautiful woman you know God
[1:07:31] for some reason I'm not able to bear why
[1:07:36] don't I just give Hagar to Abraham she's
[1:07:40] I mean I'm sure he'd be delighted in her
[1:07:42] she's beautiful and you know perhaps God
[1:07:46] will gonna is gonna give me a child by
[1:07:48] her see yeah here's the thing that it
[1:07:52] comes down to if Abram himself would
[1:07:56] have just stood there and just looked
[1:07:58] and I hope you'll listen to me tonight
[1:08:00] and look at this don't just let this be
[1:08:02] words tonight but let it be an
[1:08:05] application to our life because listen
[1:08:07] in your life there are patterns let's
[1:08:11] just be honest sometimes there's
[1:08:12] negative patterns we need God's grace in
[1:08:14] overcoming but there's also spiritual
[1:08:17] patterns for how God has dealt with you
[1:08:20] and proved his word and you know what
[1:08:22] that's for you and Abram could have just
[1:08:27] looked glad told him I'll show you the
[1:08:29] land is that right he did when he got in
[1:08:32] there and the land God said this was the
[1:08:34] land I'm talking about Abram worshiped
[1:08:37] right then Abraham you know he went
[1:08:39] about his way famine came up and he left
[1:08:42] and went on down to Egypt but you see
[1:08:44] his faith got him a chair
[1:08:46] that didn't change God's mind about him
[1:08:49] oh come on somebody that didn't change
[1:08:53] God's mind Abram come back in the land
[1:08:56] and here love you still you know hanging
[1:08:59] around with them it was hard for Abram
[1:09:01] to separate from Locke
[1:09:03] that's his nephew he raised him at his
[1:09:06] table come on now separation isn't
[1:09:10] always something that's easy the Prophet
[1:09:13] talked about when God called him to go
[1:09:15] from the East out to the West he said I
[1:09:17] had to leave everything that was dear to
[1:09:21] me to follow the will of God but I tell
[1:09:25] you when God speaks to your heart there
[1:09:28] is something that begins to take place
[1:09:30] in your life but everything else you
[1:09:34] stand like Elijah and say it doesn't
[1:09:37] matter it's God that matters hallelujah
[1:09:45] that's the same way in every service and
[1:09:47] day after day when he would speak to us
[1:09:50] about his will when he speaks and makes
[1:09:53] a note to our heart is something about
[1:09:56] it that as were in contact with God and
[1:09:58] we stay in that atmosphere that's why
[1:10:01] it's important to stay in the atmosphere
[1:10:03] because it opens you and I have to
[1:10:05] receive from him hear from him and
[1:10:07] submit to him in simplicity but it's
[1:10:11] when we get out of the atmosphere and
[1:10:13] then here we are praying and we're
[1:10:15] trying to pray but our prayer is almost
[1:10:17] like pumping a pump you're not going to
[1:10:22] get nothing that way the Holy Spirit is
[1:10:25] timid come on some honey that's where to
[1:10:30] come back in love with him and you know
[1:10:32] maybe it might be you just need to put
[1:10:34] on some music to settle your spirit down
[1:10:37] you need to say God help me get back in
[1:10:40] line so I can receive from you
[1:10:44] hallelujah because let me tell you
[1:10:47] something you don't think he wants to
[1:10:48] talk to you he wants to talk to you he
[1:10:52] loves to talk to you he does God Himself
[1:10:55] does not desire to hide or keep his way
[1:10:59] back for your life from you you might be
[1:11:04] standing at a crossroads but let me tell
[1:11:06] you something tonight you can cast down
[1:11:08] that evil spirit that would be trying to
[1:11:10] whisper in your ear as though God
[1:11:12] doesn't care I'm telling you God cares
[1:11:15] and if you'll just stand still you will
[1:11:18] witness the salvation of the Lord that
[1:11:21] God will direct your path the Bible the
[1:11:24] Word of God is true that acknowledged
[1:11:26] the Lord in all the paths and he will
[1:11:29] direct that footsteps Sara said I'm
[1:11:39] gonna help I'm gonna provide a little
[1:11:42] help now hold on a moment let me get
[1:11:44] this straight you're gonna help him
[1:11:47] Hooper who has made the atoms molecules
[1:11:50] and the earth that you're standing on
[1:11:56] you're gonna help him he don't need your
[1:12:00] help I know there's times we want to see
[1:12:06] things come to past there's things we
[1:12:10] want to see happen but you know what as
[1:12:12] we continue to mature in the Lord you
[1:12:14] realize there's a season and a time and
[1:12:18] it's Satan's desire to try to get
[1:12:20] everything in and our people and get you
[1:12:22] worked at it alive oh my goodness look
[1:12:24] at where everything's at but wait a
[1:12:26] minute here step back that ain't doing
[1:12:29] nothing for God well I'll tell you we're
[1:12:32] just gonna go tonight daddy doing
[1:12:34] nothing for God you need to recognize
[1:12:36] that's not the Holy Ghost that's the
[1:12:39] enemy you need to claim your rights that
[1:12:42] this land is given to the peace of God
[1:12:45] come on somebody you can never do
[1:12:48] anything in hates and it ever come out
[1:12:50] right you can never do anything without
[1:12:54] peace ruling over it and it come out
[1:12:56] right
[1:13:01] I'm telling you tonight
[1:13:03] I'm not just preaching to you or giving
[1:13:06] you a few things where I preach them
[1:13:08] from experience in my heart over and
[1:13:12] over their times we don't know what to
[1:13:14] do in situations and it would do you
[1:13:19] good and students calling around
[1:13:20] everybody else in your family and asking
[1:13:22] for their suggestion you ought to go to
[1:13:25] the Heavenly Father and say what do you
[1:13:27] see in this situation because let me
[1:13:29] tell you something he's got eyes and
[1:13:32] those eyes don't have ulterior motives
[1:13:34] they don't have ulterior desires
[1:13:36] remember his heart and his I said
[1:13:39] beloved I would that there would be and
[1:13:43] good health and prosper but she's going
[1:13:54] to help God out and Abraham went along
[1:14:00] with it you see it was an alternative
[1:14:05] route you know how the Bible teaches us
[1:14:09] in the book of Galatians Galatians 4
[1:14:11] this Hagar is that of the law works of
[1:14:16] the flesh and you and I both know
[1:14:20] there's no works of the flesh that can
[1:14:23] stand justified in God's presence the
[1:14:27] Bible is clear in the Book of Isaiah
[1:14:29] that our works are filthy rags in his
[1:14:32] sights
[1:14:33] understand me even though our works
[1:14:36] might be that which is according to his
[1:14:38] word but if it's generated just based on
[1:14:42] our strength then God said those are
[1:14:44] your works but if they're our works
[1:14:47] that's motivated by the Spirit of God
[1:14:50] then God don't call them our works
[1:14:52] he says it's holy works by holy faith
[1:15:00] God doesn't need our help
[1:15:03] he just needs our surrender that's
[1:15:08] exactly right
[1:15:09] the law can make nothing perfect or
[1:15:11] complete I think tonight we just ought
[1:15:14] to be so set on our heart
[1:15:15] I'll just stay with grace you see grace
[1:15:20] provides grace provides oh my I hope
[1:15:25] that just rings so deep in our heart
[1:15:27] grace provides no does not provide grace
[1:15:31] provided Israel a prophet grace provided
[1:15:38] the pillar fire grace provided every
[1:15:41] step of the way now lets you to look at
[1:15:49] this here and we're just gonna rest in
[1:15:52] this just a few moments here in Genesis
[1:15:56] 17:1 God makes himself known to Abraham
[1:16:08] again and when Abram was ninety years
[1:16:13] old and nine the Lord appeared to Abram
[1:16:19] and said unto him I am the Almighty God
[1:16:24] walk before me and be thou perfect now I
[1:16:31] want you to think about this before we
[1:16:33] continue to read the original promise
[1:16:37] that God gave Abraham clear back in
[1:16:41] Genesis 11 that is recorded in the
[1:16:44] opening of Genesis 12
[1:16:47] you never read Sarah's name in there you
[1:16:54] don't read it in there but yet it is in
[1:16:58] there but it just has to be the right
[1:17:02] season for that to come forth let me
[1:17:06] just say it like this for you and me
[1:17:08] you can set underneath the word and you
[1:17:11] can be looking and saying I don't seem
[1:17:13] like I see myself in that keep looking
[1:17:20] keep staying in the camp and keep
[1:17:24] looking and keep feeding on the world
[1:17:28] Sarah listen every time Abraham would go
[1:17:31] out and come back there was no mention
[1:17:34] the Lord never mentioned Sarah's name
[1:17:39] before able to get you I can tell you
[1:17:51] talked to God today did me I wonder was
[1:17:55] like when he he would come home from
[1:17:56] work she said I know you talked to him
[1:17:59] today how can you tell it's just a
[1:18:02] presence about your life and so she's
[1:18:08] wanting to know you know kind of like
[1:18:09] who called who who was it the Claudia
[1:18:12] who text you oh you're getting texts
[1:18:15] from no not text from worse that day
[1:18:16] that you know ways to get that you know
[1:18:21] see what you know talk to him and try to
[1:18:24] find out but there was no word
[1:18:28] concerning sorry I but yet she was there
[1:18:35] she was there not
[1:18:39] but you see right then you can
[1:18:42] understand you see of where that here it
[1:18:45] is laying here like in a mystery form
[1:18:48] just like that of the Gentile bride but
[1:18:52] I want to call your attention back to
[1:18:54] words in that promise when God gave that
[1:18:59] promise he said I will I have already I
[1:19:05] will bless thee it had everything to do
[1:19:11] with him is that right this was going to
[1:19:16] be his work and so here when God he
[1:19:23] would let the stream of life dry up in
[1:19:25] Abram Abraham had already fathered an
[1:19:28] Ishmael God said I lot I gotta let him
[1:19:31] get dead Sarah I was already barren her
[1:19:37] womb was dead Abraham was all dried up
[1:19:41] all right he got tired of trying but
[1:19:46] when he got tired of trying that's when
[1:19:49] the Lord showed up of his efforts had
[1:19:55] expired and God said got you just where
[1:19:58] I want yet whoo Abraham had been trying
[1:20:05] Sally I had been trying but you see they
[1:20:07] had been trying but God had a reserve
[1:20:10] deployment season and when they came to
[1:20:13] the end of their way that's when he
[1:20:16] could reveal himself that I am the old
[1:20:18] mighty God the all-powerful God the L
[1:20:22] Satya I am the God to bring to pass the
[1:20:26] promise that I've spoken hallelujah he
[1:20:32] made himself known in that time that I
[1:20:35] am the most powerful I'm telling you we
[1:20:41] don't need an intellectual gospel we
[1:20:43] need the power of God it won't be
[1:20:47] intellect that packs the brought out of
[1:20:50] here it's not intellection gives you
[1:20:52] victory it takes the power of God to
[1:20:55] produce the life of Jesus Christ it
[1:20:59] takes the power of God moving inside to
[1:21:02] bring that word to pass he said I'm the
[1:21:06] Almighty God and I will verse to make my
[1:21:12] covenant between thee me and thee and
[1:21:15] will multiply thee exceedingly I don't
[1:21:22] have time to read these other scriptures
[1:21:23] that refer to it but God this same
[1:21:28] phrase the same word the Almighty God
[1:21:32] it's the same one that every time God
[1:21:36] would reveal himself to Jacob to Isaac
[1:21:41] he would make himself known that I am
[1:21:44] the Lord God Almighty aren't you glad he
[1:21:48] makes himself known to you that
[1:21:51] I am the all-powerful one this is
[1:21:58] exactly what is eat you heard when the
[1:22:01] creatures were moving the living
[1:22:04] creatures were moving in the Book of
[1:22:07] Ezekiel he said when their wings were
[1:22:09] moving it was the vice of the Almighty
[1:22:13] and Abram fell on his face and God
[1:22:19] talked with him I want you to think
[1:22:22] about this how God he moves on the scene
[1:22:25] here and verse 4 as for me behold my
[1:22:29] covenant is with thee and thou shalt be
[1:22:32] a father of many nations hallelujah many
[1:22:37] nations see God was showing right here
[1:22:40] in this scripture God as Paul would say
[1:22:42] in the book of Galatians preached the
[1:22:45] gospel to Abram this was the gospel
[1:22:48] being preached he would be the father of
[1:22:51] many nations
[1:22:52] by what not by the natural seed but by
[1:22:56] the spiritual seed right here we even in
[1:23:00] this church right here all kinds of
[1:23:02] different nationalities come on we don't
[1:23:06] even got to go outside this church but
[1:23:07] to think all around the world he is
[1:23:09] bringing together a bride a mini nations
[1:23:13] Kindred's and tongues and she is one
[1:23:16] body there's one church there's one
[1:23:20] bride of the Lord Jesus Christ and he's
[1:23:23] bringing it all together and this think
[1:23:26] of it you and I are living in the
[1:23:28] closing moments and this word was spoken
[1:23:31] and preached to Abraham you tell me this
[1:23:35] word don't got power in it brother this
[1:23:38] word right here of verse 4 it had an
[1:23:41] effect in your life and that effect in
[1:23:43] my life where we can stand and say
[1:23:46] Abraham is my father
[1:23:53] neither shall that name any more be
[1:23:56] called Abram but thy name shall be
[1:24:01] Abraham you know what your name is it's
[1:24:09] your character you're not I mean there's
[1:24:17] a lot of things a lot of people I didn't
[1:24:18] name my boys after because I had some in
[1:24:20] classroom her name certain things you
[1:24:24] know what I mean you know you go to
[1:24:25] start talking about some man they'll say
[1:24:27] James who what's what's his last name
[1:24:30] because you know what when you get the
[1:24:32] surname on there the surname will tell
[1:24:34] you who that James is is that right you
[1:24:40] see look at this
[1:24:41] God said thy name God was changing
[1:24:46] Abraham's character oh he was not just
[1:24:52] changing his name like taking a
[1:24:54] nameplate off and putting another one
[1:24:56] off God was speaking to the expression
[1:25:00] of the word that was sowed in his life
[1:25:03] that character of word that laid there
[1:25:06] God was saying that you're the
[1:25:08] expression of your life shall be called
[1:25:11] Abraham for a father of many nations
[1:25:18] have high made v-not will I have already
[1:25:25] he's dead right now come on now Sarah's
[1:25:31] dead but here in the presence of God
[1:25:34] notice his faith growing and he says I
[1:25:36] have made thee I will make me
[1:25:41] exceedingly fruitful I will make nations
[1:25:43] of thee and Kings shall come out of thee
[1:25:46] we recognize that this chapter here in
[1:25:49] Genesis 17 if that were Abraham notice
[1:25:53] handy Almighty God walk before me and be
[1:25:57] thou perfect
[1:25:58] how can Abraham be perfect
[1:26:00] how can you be perfect how can I be
[1:26:03] perfect
[1:26:04] there's got to be a representation on
[1:26:08] the inside that comes out and stands on
[1:26:12] our behalf my brother and sister that's
[1:26:16] why it takes the Holy Ghost and here
[1:26:19] where Abraham is spoken to by God
[1:26:22] I am the Almighty God and you know what
[1:26:25] God revealed himself to take my breasts
[1:26:29] take my life and draw it into you he's
[1:26:34] weak you with me he's still weak
[1:26:39] he still sterile see still sterile it
[1:26:44] ceased to be between them as husband and
[1:26:46] wife but you know what he's nursing from
[1:26:51] the Almighty God his strength is gone it
[1:26:58] will take the strength of God to produce
[1:27:01] this so he's drawing that's what mother
[1:27:08] mem says when God speaks through a man's
[1:27:10] heart he said when the Holy Ghost moves
[1:27:13] upon your life he said you could square
[1:27:15] your shoulders back put your head up and
[1:27:17] start walking he circles the promises a
[1:27:19] sure thing what God spoke to your heart
[1:27:25] hey man it's it's like we're something
[1:27:28] tonight it's already done
[1:27:31] he was inviting Abraham come nourish
[1:27:35] strength into your body
[1:27:37] he changed Abraham's name from Abram to
[1:27:43] Abraham you know to do this
[1:27:47] God when in order to change his name he
[1:27:52] simply just took Abram and he split it
[1:27:55] apart and he stepped in the middle yeah
[1:28:00] he stepped in the middle with the 5th no
[1:28:03] more though that letter the 5th letter
[1:28:05] there of the he Bravo which is he steps
[1:28:08] in the middle of a
[1:28:10] name and that right there means the
[1:28:13] breath the inspiration the understanding
[1:28:17] the spiritual revelation the life giver
[1:28:20] he stepped in the middle of Abraham's
[1:28:23] life and it becomes Abraham hallelujah
[1:28:28] and he stepped in the middle of
[1:28:31] Abraham's life and then he comes to the
[1:28:33] end of Syria and he puts the Amen on her
[1:28:37] life and then of himself and that going
[1:28:41] on the end of her main May means one who
[1:28:43] is faithful lovely delicate affectionate
[1:28:50] hallelujah that's the power of the
[1:28:54] Living God that moves on our lives going
[1:29:01] to be to God hallelujah you know put the
[1:29:08] bat in the center like this he said you
[1:29:11] know he said he put yellow him he put
[1:29:14] part of God's name because God is father
[1:29:17] of all and he made his name being at him
[1:29:21] he put part of his name with Abraham and
[1:29:24] made him a partner with him I want you
[1:29:27] listen this through his seed he would
[1:29:29] bring forth the seed and bless every
[1:29:32] nation in the earth he'd be the father
[1:29:35] of many nations
[1:29:36] Abraham wouldn't reproduce the faith of
[1:29:39] Elohim Abraham would reproduce the faith
[1:29:47] of Elohim do you realize what you are
[1:29:51] called to do to reproduce the faith of
[1:29:55] Elohim not us not a strength but it is
[1:30:01] him how can we reproduce that it's not
[1:30:05] us his faith itself it has to be his
[1:30:09] faith his word his life become
[1:30:13] preeminent in our lives
[1:30:16] [Applause]
[1:30:18] it's all him it's all him it's what God
[1:30:26] has spoken now once you think of this
[1:30:29] right here if God don't have faith in
[1:30:31] his own word then he shouldn't have
[1:30:33] spoken but he has faith in his own word
[1:30:39] when he's spoken he brings with the past
[1:30:43] it's already finished it's already
[1:30:46] settled all it takes us for us our faith
[1:30:48] to get brought up into that atmosphere
[1:30:50] and it ain't about us trying to oh my
[1:30:52] goodness I'm gonna try to get there oh
[1:30:54] my goodness I'm gonna try to get know
[1:30:55] anything about that it is just simply
[1:30:58] take hold of El Shaddai I and nurse the
[1:31:03] strength into your life day by day and
[1:31:11] you know what that baby has just as
[1:31:14] satisfying come on now he just is
[1:31:19] satisfied that's the way a believer is
[1:31:24] when God has made a promise and that
[1:31:28] promise he can anchor in your heart
[1:31:30] you're satisfied it's done it's finished
[1:31:37] it's over you see when that drops in
[1:31:40] your heart it's done oh I know the
[1:31:44] symptoms might go on you say how can it
[1:31:49] drop and things keep going because you
[1:31:52] got to remember the Word of God is a
[1:31:53] creative word there were two women in a
[1:31:59] meeting one of them had that goiter the
[1:32:03] other one had stomach problems there
[1:32:06] right that woman could not eat the other
[1:32:11] one there had that growth on her body in
[1:32:14] the meeting it was pronounced well
[1:32:19] she went home and she kept having the
[1:32:21] same issues but she kept saying God has
[1:32:25] healed me are you with me remember her
[1:32:31] husband said you better what about doing
[1:32:32] I think you're bringing a reproach on
[1:32:34] God you better not be doing that how do
[1:32:35] you know I was the honey I think you're
[1:32:36] bringing a reproach on God but all of a
[1:32:39] sudden one morning she happened to just
[1:32:43] think about finishing the oats that her
[1:32:46] child had left in the bowl and the old
[1:32:49] mill would tear her up but she ate it
[1:32:53] and nothing happened so what did she do
[1:32:57] she made some eggs come on now and about
[1:33:03] that time her neighbor down the road she
[1:33:06] already had woke up that morning and the
[1:33:09] growth that was long her life it had
[1:33:13] fallen off in the sheets I'll tell you
[1:33:17] what happened the Prophet said the angel
[1:33:21] of the Lord who spoke to their hearts in
[1:33:23] that meeting he was visiting that
[1:33:26] neighborhood that day who was it that
[1:33:31] was coming through that neighborhood the
[1:33:34] Almighty God they had been nursing from
[1:33:39] El Shadia drawing that promise e'en into
[1:33:43] their lives I don't mean to be too plain
[1:33:49] but when a baby's nursing it ain't busy
[1:33:51] looking at everybody else it's got its
[1:33:53] eyes on mama
[1:33:54] you're with me it's kind of Sighs on
[1:33:57] mama come on now brother branham's let's
[1:33:58] poke pretty plain like this too it's got
[1:34:02] its eyes on mama let me tell you
[1:34:04] something when you're nuts in the right
[1:34:06] way you've got your eyes on Jesus who is
[1:34:09] your strength and your sustainer
[1:34:12] [Applause]
[1:34:19] and Abraham also God lets him know
[1:34:27] circumcision tied in with this the name
[1:34:31] change the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:34:34] he lets him know when you get hurt as
[1:34:37] for sehri I die wife in verse 15 thou
[1:34:43] shalt not call her name Sarai but Sarah
[1:34:48] shall her name be and I will bless her
[1:34:55] and give thee a son also of her yeah I
[1:35:00] will bless her and she shall be a mother
[1:35:03] of Nations kings of people shall be of
[1:35:06] her you know that wonderful I will bless
[1:35:10] her not just give her a sensation I'll
[1:35:14] bless her when God blesses it's a
[1:35:17] releasing of his life
[1:35:20] Jerry men and yeah I will bless her amen
[1:35:25] a neighbor him you know Abraham goes on
[1:35:27] in verse 17 shall a child be born unto
[1:35:29] him that is a hundred years old
[1:35:33] Abraham looking at his self and shall
[1:35:42] Sarah that is 99 old 99 or 90 years old
[1:35:47] bear
[1:35:48] but you see Abraham doesn't know see
[1:35:52] Abraham he doesn't know there's coming
[1:35:54] to change but God is already given an
[1:35:58] announcement you call her Sarah God has
[1:36:02] already let it be known there's gonna be
[1:36:04] a change coming because there ain't no
[1:36:06] wait Sarah can bear you a child because
[1:36:09] you can't even give her anything all
[1:36:13] right you you can't even give her
[1:36:15] anything so there's got to come a change
[1:36:17] in you that ain't just Sarah got a
[1:36:22] change Sarah can't say Libra has got a
[1:36:25] change no you both got to be changed you
[1:36:30] see it that's a why it ain't just one oh
[1:36:32] boy so-and-so's got to get changed no we
[1:36:35] all got to be changed let me tell you
[1:36:38] something we need more change than just
[1:36:40] going back to our youth we need to get
[1:36:43] all the junk out of our life there's got
[1:36:46] to come a change or else well on the
[1:36:48] other side we'd end up right back in the
[1:36:50] same mess there's got to come a
[1:36:54] correction of everything in our lives
[1:36:58] [Music]
[1:37:00] hmm but Sarah has or Sarah verse 19 the
[1:37:06] wife shall bear thee a son indeed and
[1:37:08] thou shalt call his name Isaac and I
[1:37:10] will establish my covenant with him for
[1:37:14] an everlasting covenant and with his
[1:37:16] seed forever that God went on to say in
[1:37:21] verse 21 I'm closing
[1:37:23] we'll just stop here my covenant will I
[1:37:26] establish with Isaac in verse 21 which
[1:37:30] Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set
[1:37:33] time in the next year and he left off
[1:37:36] talking with him and God went up from
[1:37:39] Abraham what a lesson
[1:37:47] John Ben stop and look at Abraham and
[1:37:49] say you know what you always do the same
[1:37:51] stuff you always act like this
[1:37:55] no his word is going to prevail you
[1:38:01] remember in this chapter it's the breath
[1:38:04] of the Almighty
[1:38:06] it's God's inspiration coming forth let
[1:38:12] me tell you something there might been a
[1:38:13] lot of things and we can look at right
[1:38:14] here that seemingly was in the way but
[1:38:17] God Himself is moving and he keeps on
[1:38:22] speaking his word there is no negative
[1:38:25] in his word you say how does that apply
[1:38:30] to me there's to be no negative in your
[1:38:34] words when we come and we are in prayer
[1:38:40] we are coming with a positive promise
[1:38:46] made by a positive God backed up by a
[1:38:50] positive Holy Ghost that brings about a
[1:38:53] positive faith positive results come on
[1:38:57] somebody we're not we're not here this
[1:39:00] is not no matter what you feel or what
[1:39:03] you think brother Graham goes into this
[1:39:05] place here and he says you might be
[1:39:07] sitting here tonight he says and you
[1:39:09] think you're old and you might think
[1:39:12] maybe I'm not much good he said but let
[1:39:15] me tell you something
[1:39:16] Abram and Sarah was much older than you
[1:39:20] you can't get much worse than when God
[1:39:24] speaks and you're laughing because you
[1:39:29] know what to the mind to the reasoning
[1:39:32] yeah I don't know how this is gonna be I
[1:39:34] don't know how this is gonna take place
[1:39:35] I don't know how this is gonna happen
[1:39:37] God didn't ask you Abraham how he didn't
[1:39:41] ask you to try to figure it out
[1:39:45] sometimes that's our biggest problem is
[1:39:47] we get in between here and instead let
[1:39:52] God get in between here he gets in
[1:39:56] between here then he gives you strength
[1:39:58] to control between here come on now
[1:40:02] because all sorts of reasonings and
[1:40:04] everything else can arise and let me
[1:40:06] tell you something everything around you
[1:40:08] can present to you why you are not a fit
[1:40:11] candidate let me say this to you God has
[1:40:15] spoken God has spoken to your life God
[1:40:22] has spoken to your heart this is God's
[1:40:24] promise prevents us here the power of
[1:40:29] Almighty God he said is here he said and
[1:40:32] to think of it he said he that knows
[1:40:34] your life and while his anointing is
[1:40:37] here not me this is what he says not me
[1:40:40] but him it's not the bulb that's giving
[1:40:46] the light it's the current in the barber
[1:40:50] is that right it ain't the bulb it's the
[1:40:54] current and it's not the bulb it's not
[1:40:58] that that heals it's the current the
[1:41:01] anointing have a mighty God that comes
[1:41:04] through that performs the word and we
[1:41:11] can rest within that list and
[1:41:26] if you don't take anything else out of
[1:41:27] this tonight you realize the position
[1:41:31] you realize the place we're in but I
[1:41:34] want you to take out of this tonight as
[1:41:36] it applies to our life the Lord Jesus
[1:41:40] himself has laid aside everything to be
[1:41:46] united with you to nourish you to
[1:41:52] comfort you
[1:41:53] to strengthen you to encourage you
[1:41:58] that's what that's that's what he does
[1:42:03] he's provided of his life but I don't
[1:42:08] know what your needs are tonight but I
[1:42:11] want you to look at this right here
[1:42:12] don't get caught up on what your need is
[1:42:16] but look to him
[1:42:20] and you draw strength from him well if I
[1:42:25] could just know we don't want any
[1:42:27] Ishmael's you can't produce this I can't
[1:42:31] produce it it takes God is that right
[1:42:36] it has to be God sometimes you nurse on
[1:42:42] a promise and you nurse for a while you
[1:42:48] don't matter your nursing is you are
[1:42:52] satisfied you are satisfied within that
[1:42:56] because it's his strength that'll bring
[1:42:59] it about you know there's not one thing
[1:43:01] in my life there's not one thing within
[1:43:03] any life that's standing here that any
[1:43:06] of us can take credit for not one of us
[1:43:08] can say well I'm standing here because I
[1:43:10] know it's because of him
[1:43:17] it's because of him
[1:43:20] and we receive that strength from him in
[1:43:23] our lives
[1:43:24] you know he's providing for us like a
[1:43:26] faithful husband he's provided all that
[1:43:31] we have need of
[1:43:38] you know you take a promise
[1:43:40] and the promise when God makes that
[1:43:43] promise
[1:43:45] it's something that stands out to you
[1:43:47] you take that promise and you water it
[1:43:54] you water that with praise drawing
[1:44:00] strength
[1:44:03] and you watch God come
[1:44:06] I know every one of our lives every one
[1:44:10] of us sometimes where we sometimes we
[1:44:12] get into places I believe God helps us
[1:44:15] as we come along and heaven mature when
[1:44:18] we realize it takes patience there's
[1:44:24] sometimes there's things we pray for and
[1:44:26] it's like that then there's other times
[1:44:30] those things were praying for
[1:44:33] it seems like the answer it's not coming
[1:44:39] but it's all the way
[1:44:42] Abraham waited for 25 years I'm not
[1:44:45] telling you you gotta wait for 25 years
[1:44:47] but I'm just telling you Abraham he
[1:44:50] waited for 25 years
[1:44:55] but this chapter that we're in moving in
[1:44:59] even to this next chapter where that the
[1:45:05] one who has now appeared to him as the
[1:45:06] Almighty God he comes in the fullness of
[1:45:10] his power and his strength and he comes
[1:45:14] walking down the road with two angels
[1:45:20] you see what Abraham did there's
[1:45:24] something that happened between Genesis
[1:45:27] 17 and Genesis 18 something happened
[1:45:32] because as God went on and kept talking
[1:45:36] to Abraham God let him know I'm not just
[1:45:40] giving you a promise that's lingering
[1:45:42] out here
[1:45:43] I'm telling you service going to bear
[1:45:46] assignment in the appointed time in this
[1:45:49] coming year see God's now let it be
[1:45:52] known this is the season of the coming
[1:45:55] promise something takes place
[1:46:02] because you find abraham sitting in that
[1:46:06] door of his house
[1:46:12] the Rebbe says he's looking down so no
[1:46:16] doubt Abram just finished praying he
[1:46:19] said about that time is it Abram looked
[1:46:21] up he said in something spoken Abraham's
[1:46:26] heart and said there's something about
[1:46:29] these men
[1:46:33] well Brandon goes on to say he said
[1:46:37] Abraham kept himself in a spiritual
[1:46:40] atmosphere so that he could recognize
[1:46:44] the Lord when he showed up let me tell
[1:46:49] you something
[1:46:50] he's got your address he's got your
[1:46:53] number
[1:46:57] and every promise he fulfills it
[1:47:03] he's the Almighty God let's just pray
[1:47:07] Lord
