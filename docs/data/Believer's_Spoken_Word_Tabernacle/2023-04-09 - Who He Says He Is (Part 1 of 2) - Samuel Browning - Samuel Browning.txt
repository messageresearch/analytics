first loved me hallelujah thank you Jesus [Music] [Music] [Applause] love me just mind tell me [Music] just my make a personal my salvation my salvation [Music] tree amen [Music] sorry about that just a little nervous then a little testimony uh I'm going to thank you all for your prayers and Cardinal and and it was a lot rougher than what I thought I hadn't had anything hit that hit me like that since I was on my way to Germany on a troop ship and got seasick and I got so sick there was nothing else to come up and I thought my thoughts were they're going to find me right here I thought this is it you know so but this hit pretty hard and I it hit so hard I couldn't get my breath I blacked out and uh my wife said I was out about three minutes but when I'll come through I didn't know where I was at what was going on but I heard Shirley's voice calling my name that really helped so I had a time getting out when I was fail but God's good and even in all those he watches over us Hallelujah that's a little song on my heart and I got I wanted to read you this I found this it's in the Smyrna Church days and it was something that really helped me a lot I understand the godhead and so precious I hope it's I'll be a blessing until you're just a little quote he said what we have just set forth would be much easier for all to understand if all belief the doctrine of the Oneness of the godhead for there are not three persons in one godhead but one thus We Are Born Again by the spirit of life thus we are not born again by the spirit of Life Jesus coming in and then subsequently to that the Holy Spirit coming and giving us power if that was true why are we dishonoring the father but not giving him a part in our complete salvation for his salvation is of the lord and there are three Lords then he father must have something to do but surely it can be seen that Jesus made this very clear that he and he own who is God and is he and he alone who is coming into the believer John 14 16 says that the father will send another comforter but verse 17 says that he Jesus dwelleth with him and should be in them will come unto them thus it is the father Son and Holy Ghost all coming in at one time for as the one person comprising the godhead this event took place at Pentecost there aren't two Commons of the spirit just one the trouble is that people don't know the real truth and they simply believed in Jesus for remissions of sin but never go on to receive the spirit and that just helped me so much and I thought it might be a blessing to you and I'm going to try to sing this and it's on my heart and soul if you can sing with me and help me out a little right I need your help and it's down from his glory we didn't get to practice it or anything so I hope I hope they can pick me up on this down from his glory [Music] my God and say your game and Jesus was [Music] born in a manger to his own a stranger [Music] [Music] oh how I love you how I adore him [Music] regret my son [Music] creator the pain must save yours [Music] in real life understands [Music] us creatures [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] wow [Music] [Applause] without reluctance [Music] flesh and blood is [Music] [Music] n't it mystery [Music] hey I know Hallelujah [Music] [Applause] my breath my son I was letting go [Music] and oh God [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah we could go home right now we can go home at this point and say truly I've been blessed by the best part's Yet to Come amen praise God thank you brother Chris thank you for brother Brian singing that special this morning amen let's just sing this little song as Brother Sam who comes you can love me [Music] [Music] take away the vision foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Hallelujah reach down [Music] this for me [Music] oh unworthy to live hope nothing to kill a man [Music] could still go free yes it's true fight on understand why the king [Music] is thrown [Music] my Lord don't feel the pain of Flesh foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] but still go through [Applause] oh he's more than a man hallelujah what kind of a man [Music] I'm so glad it didn't end for you and me unworthy [Music] but the man could still go one more time but the man but the man on the cross had my name is will he says yes I could still put a free wish I could steal the dream amen hallelujah amen let's just sing that little song word of God speak his brother Samuel comes amen just looking forward to his word this morning God bless whether as he comes amen it's God bless you all I I've had a good time up here I'll make a song leader happy I'm finding myself had a loss for words and the funny thing is it's okay the last thing I need is to be heard hers morning Lord I wanna hear what you would say it's a word of God Speak or down like rain washing my eyes to see your majesty to be still and know the joy in this place please let me stay rest in your Holiness word of God's feet [Music] amen we gather together appreciate all the songs and the specials amen the testimonies uh you know I think what we're going to do is you know brothers let's take out the first five pews and we'll just all cram together I must bite or something something but you know let me tell you what the prophet of God told us he said the anointing flows from the pulpit out amen so that's why many times I set where I sat amen I want to be close to it oh I I know it'll reach clear to the back there's times I've been strategic in a meeting and it might be a tight meeting I'd get right in the back or get right in the middle and just start pulling on the gift of God amen because I know one thing he's more than enough to meet every need in every circumstance and you know I just want to be a blessing I want to be a help the word of God means everything to me he's everything and I know that when he touches a life like he's touched mine they'll never be the same if there's one thing that I could desire for anyone and that's the same way that I feel about my children sure I I we want our children yes I I want them to you know certain things but that's not the priority of my life that's not the priority and I'm just you can talk to them about it the number one priority is is that they know Jesus Christ in the povert's resurrection because they've met him then everything else he will guide them and lead them and be with them when Daddy can't be there when situations don't know and what's coming on but they know the same God that their daddy knows and they have that same reality and when they face adversities of Life they have that Assurance I am with you and I'll never leave you nor forsake you so that that's my objective in life sure I believe in education or whatever more but education will never save a soul amen so good to be in the house of the Lord amen good to be here on this Easter Sunday amen and amen well let's just go into the word of the Lord here and I believe God really has he he never disappoints us he always has something for us and my prayer is and I ask that you would pray with me that God helped help the man of God to get out of the way because you know in every service there's many things that God has placed upon our hearts and there's a thought in what it is is it's he's the one who gives the thought and it's based on our needs you know God doesn't come Among Us and speak things and then we wonder and say well what does that what does that mean but God comes with purposely to minister to our needs and you know what I love about it is because sometimes there's things that you know I might know as a need sometimes I know of certain needs and you know how brother Brown will tell us and it's true sometimes we'll study and we study from where we see things are to where we need to be that to catch it to catch it in there but a man can't do that a man can't catch us from one place to another that has to be God and you know there's things that God comes and he does it in a way to speak to us what we have need of in our life and so I'm just going to speak here on a thought this morning the beginning of the week early one morning about three in the morning woke me up and just standing beside the bed and this is what this is the very thought that I'm going to speak on who he says he is who he says he is second Timothy chapter 1 verse 7. amen God bless the visitors and amen God bless you this morning amen for God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind be not therefore ashamed of the testimony of Our Lord nor of me his prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions of The Gospel According to the power of God who hath saved us and called us with and holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and Grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began but is now made manifest by the appearing of Our Savior Jesus Christ who hath abolished death and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel whereunto I am appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of the Gentiles let's just go to him in a word of Prayer hey man could we just pray together and let's pray for one another unless she's here unless just now just invite him in a personal way Heavenly Father Lord as we are gathered here Lord in this moment that God you have given us Lord in this space of time we pray father that Lord as we Look to You Lord and in this Easter morning Lord that is more than Lord just a memorial to our hearts Lord It's a reality Lord that is within us Lord every day of the year Lord and how we thank you Lord God for your mercy Lord and Lord knowing that right here God that it's your desire to come and to minister to our hearts Lord and I pray that you would help us together Lord as speaker in here to get out of the way and just a step aside and Lord we want to invite you personally the Lord God that you would take control Lord in this service Lord and minister to our needs Lord Speak Lord to the very depths of Our Lives Lord and do for us Lord what no man can do Lord I pray that you will come Lord the Living God the supernatural Lord will move right Among Us oh God and confirm your word Lord to every heart Lord in every life oh God we pray we give you all the praise in the honor and glory in Jesus precious name amen amen why don't you greet someone as you're being seated in the name of the Lord amen just say it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen so good to be here indeed amen thank you Jesus Hallelujah amen so I want to take of this thought who he says he is you remember when he revealed himself to John on the Isle of Patmos he not only made himself known that I am he that was dead but I'm Alive forevermore and I have the keys of death hell in the grave so he manifest himself as the mighty conqueror and he made himself known as I am he which was which is and which shall come so it doesn't matter how the calendar changes how time changes he said I'm God and I change not his veils change his form changes but his nature his character never changes and I think of how that when brother Branham would take this in the message it is the rising of the Sun and we we hear this is a theme throughout the whole message because even as it was in the days of the Lord Jesus they had taken promises that were pertaining to the coming of the Messiah and there were other things that were wove in there that became traditions and it was just how that when they were looking at things they missed him for who he really was and God made himself known in such Simplicity and they were holding to so many other things and yet even when he the life-giver would call them they would fall back upon we are Abraham's seed but the Lord Jesus would stand there think about it these are individuals who could say the promises are Promises of adoption that are made and wrote to us as Israelites and they would be truthful and that would be indeed the truth but when the word would go to deal with their life they would fall back upon that where Abraham's seed but Jesus would point out to them if you were Abraham's children you would recognize me and matter of fact you would rejoice as he rejoiced when he saw my day because when God stood before the tent door of Abraham that Not only was a visitation for Abraham's life but it was prophecy that there was coming a messiah that could bring about a change in the inside of a life and a heart of a man in other words it was prophesying God would become flesh and Abraham rejoiced to see that day uh you see what was his rejoicing well his rejoicing is is that he recognized these three men that were walking down there's some things there's something special about that man right there in the middle he had a witness there's something here that is different and how did he Rejoice Abraham just didn't if I can say it this way blow out all the energy through the Smoke Stack but Abraham went and said Sarah the one that spoke to us in the beginning the one that has met me in dreams and lights and visions that same God is here before our tent door this morning I want him to feel welcome here go get a calf go make some corn cakes and go get some buttermilk I want to entertain him because when he's come he has something that he wants to say and is necessary and he wants to do because when we think of this day that you and I are standing in and I you know I think as I went through the stores and uh you know you know you go around and you see all this Easter candy and of course I don't believe in bunny rabbits the only ones I believe in is the white chocolate kind that I get but they don't have nothing to do with Easter right Easter egg hunting and had nothing to do with Easter and notice all the other formalities that even could be religious formalities of Lent and everything else what good does anything do if there is no life in you what good is it it leaves a person empty and this is why that when we look at the resurrection of the Lord Jesus this is why that the prophet could say it like this is it only a memorial now everybody in here knows what a memorial is you can travel to various parts of this country and see memorials you don't even have to leave actually the city of Lorraine you can go see different memorials from events that took place right here in this city is that right but they are memorials but we recognize that this right here this event was not just a memorial as far as we would have to travel to the land of Jerusalem it's more than a memorial it was an expression a witness a fulfillment of the prophecies that God declared and made in the hour that he had spoke and had been announced clear from the coming from the Garden of Eden I will make a way back now to think about it brother Brown would say it Satan doesn't care how religious you are how right you are in your Doctrine but if you miss the life you won't come up anyhow no matter how religious how good how many churches you belong to or will belong to it doesn't matter one thing unless you have been born again let me just bring it close you could have set you could sit right there and have sat in the Branham Tabernacle when the sails were being opened and here the minister of the word but if you don't if you're never born again it will do you no good [Applause] what are you saying brother I'm saying there's a purpose for the message coming there's a purpose in the resurrection [Applause] therefore if God raised up Jesus from the dead now these are some questions did he raise him up for a memorial is this Resurrection morning only a one day in the year or a certain day that we celebrate this or are we benefactors of his resurrection what does it mean to me I think that's a question what does it mean to you now we believe by faith that he raised from the dead but what has that got to do with me that was 2 000 years ago so notice the ram picks it up and he says there had never been a time to that time that a man could lay his life down and pick it up again I don't care any other founder or whatever more they're still waiting outside of their tombs they're still waiting on Muhammad to rise and I got news for you he ain't gonna rise he's a false prophet come on friends God never called Ishmael Abraham's son he said to Abraham in Genesis 21 take Isaac thy only son because his promise is in Isaac foreign I'm not against anybody in the Muslim faith but I'm here to say there is a true Resurrection there is a life that you can enjoy right now and you're not waiting for some promise of perversion but there's a righteousness that comes through the life of Jesus Christ Hallelujah [Applause] that's what Jesus means to me there had never been a time to that time a man could lay his life down and pick it up again is that what he said he said I got power to lay my life down and power to take it up again Glory he defied that scientific proof they had by raising again and when they say now watch how this changes to this day because we in that quote right there I probably could have read that quote in a Pentecostal church this morning they'd have been shouting of course if I didn't tell him you know who said it but they'd have been something glory to God that's exactly right he defect but now let's bring it down to this day right because Satan don't care how much we rejoice in the history but he which was is and shall come when he made himself known to Abraham or to Moses and all he always said I am I am the god of thy father I am he never said I was I am he's oppressing God and when they say that Jesus Christ isn't the same yesterday today and forever his power isn't the same his gospel isn't the same when the Bible says it is the same God defied every denomination every Creed and he moved forth with his holy spirit as he promised and proved it to us that he is alive we are benefactors I'm gonna get to that word in a minute we are benefactors of his resurrection quickened after being dead in the world in sin and trespasses he has quickened us together with him raised with him now sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus his Spirit look at this now his Spirit brings his same life again on the Earth that's what the coming of the Holy Spirit does is to bring his same life again upon the Earth let me just be very clear it's more than just an anointing that anointing comes by the word so it's anointing of the word that comes to express what is the true seed on the inside just talk to an individual yesterday that had gotten a number and called me up from a place here in Ohio and was talking to me and said you know he said they just kind of starting to hear about the message and things like that and you know as we begin to talk and he said I'm seeing certain things in a certain way and I go into churches and I see you know the women cutting their hair and I see all this and I know that ain't according to the Bible he said I know I said let me tell you what's taking place there's another seed that's being sown foreign it's not the seed of the word because if you sow the seed of the word it'll produce a word crop but when they start sowing other seeds of man's ideas man's thoughts man's reasoning all it does is produce a bunch of hybrid carnal Believers that won't line up with the word of God you might say brother Samuel that's a little bit strong but that's God's word you say why well how has that happened because they remember it's two Sowers one in white the son of man and one in black came behind and he shows the seed of discrepancy but the sowing of the word by the seat of the son of man will always call and point to a present life to a living reality not something way out there in the Milky Way but it will declare itself through and behind flesh Hallelujah if the spirit of God anointed that body in such a way now notice that body was anointed and when that seed fell on the earth he just he just raised him up right there he wouldn't let him rest there the quickening power raised him up now I want to say this we are benefactors and to be a benefactor is to be a beneficiary that probably is a more common word for us which what is a beneficiary it's a person who derives Advantage from something especially a trust a will or a life insurance policy not only did the Lord Jesus draw the full benefit but he came back in order to share those benefits with you and I let me just say it like this we couldn't tap into the benefits we could talk about them they could look at him but he himself was one to satisfy but claims and he drew upon those benefits what was the full drawing on the benefits you say he healed the sick he did he fed the hungry he did but the full drawing power of the benefit is the resurrection that would raise one up who was dead and bring him to life you say what has that got to do with me you and I were dead in sin and trespasses thank you Hallelujah but he came by our way as a beneficiary Oh my he raised again for our justification and he come to share the benefits now in this text said I read Paul is calling in the admonition by reality in his heart be a partaker of the Affliction the gospel according to the power of God in other words be all in be all in don't don't have one bit don't have one part of your life out hey man if you're not in get in if you've got to toe out get it in so the token so the life can operate because there are afflictions that come there are tests there are trials that come but listen friends these are things that Paul said being a partaker of the afflictions of The Gospel According to the power of God so in other words the tests and trials that come our way from being all in from being fully committed fully surrendered those are tests and trials that have come to mold and shape us and to declare to you and I when I don't think I can stand another moment but there's one in you that's standing Hallelujah when our strength gives way there's one there's a strength greater on the inside of our lives [Applause] [Music] oh Hallelujah who saved us in verse 9 who saved us and called us with the Holy calling we have received an invitation to a feast now I'm trying to tell anybody how to have their wedding reception I mean I'll just be on this is me I don't like stuff too fancy anyhow I'm not just give me one fork I can lick that fork off and what I eat my salad with I eat my steak with I don't need all that stuff but I've been there is a wedding reception and it ain't nobody here that anybody knows but I was just a young boy and I was you know I was kind of hungry after waiting for that wedding and we get down there and I I just hope that that's not that wedding reception was not a prophecy of every southern wedding reception we got in there and there wasn't no tables they were all setting up chairs we looked like we were in another meeting and walking up to the table and getting little cups and nuts and little quarters of bologna sandwiches foreign you can tell I was disappointed you defend me roasting carrots I'd have been all right and I hate carrots but everything you know we've not been called to to uh to uh to to a table of hors d'oeuvres to just a little bit and a little bit of this but we have been called to a feast [Applause] Jesus when he was here think of it when he was here you can't call nobody to a feast unless you got something to give them right that's why Brothers before you start inviting people over your house you better make sure you got food in the house to feed them right that's why you got to check with your wife but I'm saying like this with this fees that you and I have been called to there is a meal that's already been provided [Applause] and that's why Jesus when he stood there and he called to them to Israel he came and he said the feast is ready come and they started making excuses you know I've got I need overtime I got a boat I got this and I got that and I go you say brother Samuel they didn't have boats and have what they did have they had everything back there but they made excuses why they couldn't come and you know what they could be legitimate excuses but this is the thing that separates when you recognize who's calling you and what you're being called to that it's worth more than your job it's worth more than your Associates it's worth more than anything you're not just being called to a meal you are being called To The Feast of the Lord to be a partaker of his glorious life [Music] he called us with the Holy calling I like this part not according to our works the Bible said in Romans 9 before either one he saw her Jacob had done good or evil God said I love Jacob and I hate Esau [Applause] word hate does not mean like you think it means it means to love less [Applause] oh you hearing me now but God before anything was ever done so you say what was it that Drew God to Jacob because Jacob was a part of God from the beginning he was the son of God from the beginning nothing in this earth transformed or changed him from a pig to a sheep are you hearing me now but what happened is that he got in the presence of God and there's something that's rising up in Jacob he longed for that Birthright he wanted that Birthright he valued that Birthright he slept about that Birthright he dreamed about that Birthright he talked about that birthday that's all Jacob caring about [Applause] [Music] but he saw he didn't care about it he was given first priority Jacob seemingly didn't have a Fighting Chance because he won the firstborn but you see just because you're close don't mean you're close enough oh my God are you hearing me now you can be face to face with Jesus and still not be close enough the Rich Young Ruler was face to face with him but he wasn't close enough what was it the very thing that he held on to in his life and made excuses for and reasons for is the very reason that he ended up walking away he was close remember what Jesus even said to the once Christ Thou Art near the kingdom of God right he had a righteous rightful answer but he went from being close so close to so far away you say what makes a difference on depends on your attitude and what you do with what you're hearing so it's not according to your works you can do all the works in the world and still be the most miserable person in the world are you hearing me I'm not talking about an outward work I believe an outward works but I believe outward works are only expression of the grace that has come to you and you've received in your own life I believe in works the Bible talks about where faith that works our faith expressed if you're not expressing what you believe you say you believe then you don't believe it you're only saying you believe it not according to our works but according my my my to his own purpose and Grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began but is now everybody say now May manifest by the appearing of Our Savior Jesus Christ so what is being unfolded to you and I the purpose the calling the grace that is given to us from the foundation of the world so his coming was with a purpose in Redemption and it came to those that were included all along and then let them know you are included in Redemption and you have a right to draw upon the benefits now I want you to think how Paul is declaring this of the appearing I want to just kind of make a little Sidetrack here right now on this appearing part because it's very very important because remember how that here in the days of the Lord Jesus when he raised I remember he appeared uh to there Mary Magdalene he paired to appeared to the other women he appeared to many that were there of his disciples now I want to just deal with this a moment Paul is declaring the benefit of the appearing of the Lord Jesus through the light of the Gospel it is a great benefit what Paul has said it brings life and immortality to life once something has become light it is understanding it is made manifest there's no more guesswork in it no more maybe so could be might be but life brings certainty now Paul would write it like this in second Timothy 4 8 that that in henceforth there is later for me a crown of righteousness talking about a new body which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all also that love his appearing now I want you to think about this because there are two words and actually the same word appearing can be used in the New Testament and it will mean the appearing of the very life of Jesus Christ in a body of Believers and then it will also mean the appearing when he was here in his Corporal body are you with me so now when Paul is talking about those who love his appearing now when there's an appearing let's just look at how the prophet says it he said what we are witnessing we have already seen and are witnessing the appearing of the Lord and he said now remember appearing and coming that's two different words it's to appear and then to come oh my my we could preach on that one right there it's to appear and then to come because when he appears to you then he's announcing I'm coming to you and his appearing is also preceding or announcing the second coming is on oh my you see the same way there is the same way of how he deals with us in the New Birth now now is the appearing he's already appeared in these last days right here with us in the last few years it's a sign of his coming he's appearing in his church in the form of the Holy Spirit showing that it's him because people cannot do these things that you see the Holy Spirit doing that's the appearing of the Lord Brother Brown picks it up again and he says there is a great big difference in the sign of Jesus appearing and then Jesus coming now the appearing of the Lord is right now when he's appearing in his people are you hearing me now where now is the appearing when he is appearing in his people his Spirit working among them proving that it's him with them getting them ready for the Rapture for the coming of the Lord to catch away his bride be appearing in the coming so the purpose of the appearing is to get a people ready for the rapture now the Bible tells us in Revelations 19 uh be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready right how can you make yourself ready unless there is a call that goes out to you and unfolds to you of how to make yourself ready you say what is that that's Grace that's given to you and I in this hour we wouldn't know how to find ourselves out of a paper bag if not for the grace of almighty God but God in his mercy and Grace has opened up the word of God to you and I that we're not staring at the word of God and looking at it as a history book but we see it as a book of Prophecy we see that it speaks of me it speaks of this hour and it is a pathway that is opened up to me back into the holist of holies is that right so it is the pairing of the Lord right now it's getting a people ready for rapture glory be to God in the highest Hallelujah oh my here he is the appearing on the Messiah in the form of the holy spirit in the church because you know how do you know a pear tree is a pear tree come on somebody say it all right it produces not just fruit produces pears right how do you know an apple tree is an apple tree produces apples right it's the life in it [Applause] right so whatever the life is in that tree it will produce now you know you can see this a brother man testifies in oven you can go on the internet and look it all up but you can take a branch of a citrus tree of an orange and graft it into a lemon tree and you know what it is Citrus life but it will not bear lemons it'll still bear oranges why because that's what the branch is the Citrus life only reveals what the branch was all along but if that lemon tree if it puts forth a branch of its own what will it bear then lemons is that right that's the way it was even when Moses remember there was a question and that question there was dispute among the people about who is to stand in the priesthood let me tell you something it's just like the devil when he wants to dispute with your life let me tell you you'll never defeat him in the outer Court you'll never defeat him in the injust the inner inner Court just in the spirit man you've got to get it right back to the Shekinah Glory back to the sacred Sands because right there is where all disputes are settled it's in the presence of almighty God it's when the pillar fire comes the amen of God is what comes down and declares what is really true come on Friends they took every one of them sticks in there but guess what it was Aaron's Rod back bottom blossomed and burnt almonds all in one 24-hour period let me tell you something you don't have to wait a month or Sundays to become a fruit bearing Holy Ghost Field Victorious overcoming Powerhouse of God what do I do get into the holiest of holies [Applause] get into the presence of God I want you to think of this I'm gonna just stop right here as he's speaking to me it doesn't matter what you feel about yourself it's true you may not be worthy there aren't one of us Worthy I don't care if you cut your teeth on a message Pew you are not more worthy than anybody else but I'm telling you when Jesus Christ comes by your way it's a time to start doubting your doubts and move right in with the grace of God that's coming your way he will lift you the woman at the well she didn't debate whether she was worthy or not Jesus himself came to the well at a time no other body would be there that was a time when those kind of women would come but Jesus had an appointment because he knows if I can just get to that scene Hallelujah she's had a lot of thirsts but there will come a satisfaction she'll leave this well a different woman she'll live it like a real lady [Applause] um what do you say I say when he's appearing to you move with it [Music] don't wrestle with it just go with it all through the scripture the pattern remains true to every believer throughout the scripture you will read where the Lord appeared unto them and it was always with a designated purpose in mind I wish I had time to read it but I I don't have time to read through all of this but the Bible would talk about in Genesis chapter 12 verse 7 and the Lord appeared unto Abraham and said unto thy seed will I give this land and their build he and altar unto the Lord who appeared unto him what was Abraham worshiping by he was worshiping by a word that was spoken that word was leading him to the appearing and when he appeared Abraham knew this is a place for me to build an altar and worship boy I feel good right now when he's appearing to you when he's manifesting himself to you don't wait just start worshiping him as he's appearing to your life as he's speaking to you Lord You're appearing to me this is personal listen he didn't mistake you for somebody else sitting on your Pew he's appearing to you [Music] Genesis 17 1 when Abraham was 90 years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abram and said I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect Genesis 18 1 and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of mammary and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day now in Genesis 26 24 this is to Isaac and the Lord appeared unto him the same night and said I am the god of Abraham thy father every time God Appears when he appears to Jacob he doesn't say I am the god of your grandfather Abraham he said I am the god of your father Abraham why because God don't have no grandchildren Hallelujah every one of God's children are firstborns first generation they are part because this generation does not die the Bible said in Matthew chapter one now these are the generation of the birth of Jesus Christ not Generations because this generation had no beginning and it has no ending their flesh bodies died yes they did but we're talking about the where the body was not the word but the word was in the body and the word is what was a part of the seed that was declared and spoken from the beginning so his appearing is with a purpose I said his appearing is with a purpose he just didn't come among them just to get them all stirred up he came with a purpose the appearing of the word is with a purpose there is a message to be declared there is a purpose and it is Grace that is given to you and I so it's a purpose to make manifest to reveal that of true life and immortality so let me just say it like this it's not a random event I want to just make that clear and just sit on that for a moment this is not a random event it's not a bunch of loosely connected events it's not a happenstance that you're here it's not just by chance that the message came across your path it ain't a random event sure you might have been in places that you never intended to be but God knew where you was going to be [Applause] and let me tell you you and I weren't looking for him he came looking for us [Applause] you said I had a desire for him but you didn't put that in there God put that desire in there that's why David could say that my soul long and after thee oh God and David knew that the same God that is in the sanctuary he can be the same God in a dry and thirsty land he can take a try and thirsty land and change it into a place of Springs of Living Water [Applause] it isn't a random event let me just preach now the appearing of the Holy Spirit look he spoke to Abraham in Genesis 12 actually with Genesis 11. what all along proof he was appearing to him words Visions dreams right he appeared right there in flesh melchized he appeared he continued to appear let me just say this to you Abraham no doubt could have looked at his life and said man I you know I just don't seem to be where the word is calling me to be but what Abraham did was entertain what God was appearing and saying to him what are you saying brother Samuel I'm saying that every experience that God has given you don't discount it because you can't see the full evidence in your life I'm telling you to walk on from experience to experience until your life has been fully changed what are you saying I'm saying press on little Lilly that's above the mud pass above all the dawn that's what I'm saying that ain't a random event well brother Samuel I was at a meeting and I got up and I'm still dealing with some of the same thing that ain't a random event don't discredit it don't discount it but let it let it be known to you God cares about you he loves you and he wants to do for you [Applause] boo devil [Applause] Hallelujah I'm saying boo if you don't have the strength to say boo I'm saying boo devil because I'm claiming you as godship [Applause] Hallelujah these are not random events Acts chapter 1 verse 2 until the day in which he was taken up after that he threw the Holy Ghost had given Commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen let me read on now verse 3 to whom also he showed himself alive after his Passion by many infallible proofs and being seen of them 40 days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God let me just say this the things that he did that were infallible proofs it was the same things that he did when he was walking in his flesh before Calvary yeah yeah matter of fact during this journey of 40 days at the first part of it they didn't know where he was going to show up you know what brother Brown was telling us he said Jesus when he was everything was going on he came out and walked beside him on the road he came into the house when he was invited he met him there when they were out fishing couldn't take anything and then he hollers from the shore how did his voice get there I don't know but it got there and he said hey have you got any fish little children they said no we don't got no fish he said cast your net on the other side he said cast it on the other side when they cast it on the other side what was it they were not able to even hardly pull the net onto Shore and when Peter saw it he didn't even lend him a hand and pulling it in he took off running because he knew I know who's on the show his appearing his appearance is declaring this is him he's the only one that can put fish in my net let me say this he's the only one that can put joy in your marriage he's the only one that can put real overcoming in your life he's the only one that can give you the real strength over all the vices of the devil he is the only one and let me tell you he's still in the business of putting fish in Nets Hallelujah [Applause] glory be to God acts 10 39 and Peter standing in cornelius's house he said and we are all we Are Witnesses of all things he did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem whom they slew and hanged on a tree him God raised up the third day and showed him openly I want you to catch this raised him up on the third day according to the word is that right and he showed him openly now he would seem like openly to everybody but notice the next verse not to all the people but unto Witnesses chosen God even to us who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead sure Peter was chosen Andrew was chosen Paul was chosen on and on even after this but let me say this that brings you and I to a reality that God in this last days has raised beyond all traditions of man and it's made himself known not just to anybody but to Witnesses better chosen of God before the foundation of the world you've been chosen to see the just one I didn't choose it you didn't choose it we were in God's choosing and he's appeared to you and I because we were included in him before the foundation of the world you ought to square your shoulders back in safe Blue Devil so as the pattern of his appearing is to his children it's for the purpose that they might know him know his will and that he might make the promise alive in and through them are you hearing me now in John 16 7 here he stands with them nevertheless I tell you the truth it is expedient for you that I go away remember Peter was ready to fillet some people Peter was a good one buddy I'll tell you what that guy was he can handle he could handle a knife it's it is expedient for you but I go away Peter even told him not so Lord but but the Lord Jesus hear the discernment of the word said get behind me Satan he never called Peter Satan never called him the devil but he recognized the influence that was coming upon him was trying to keep him from the promise that was needed you know Peter didn't even recognize that the things that he was out of human compassion that here that Spirit came upon him and said not so lord they're not going to do this for you Peter did not realize that this is what I really need that this is what the coming of the Holy Ghost is going to do for me this is going to be greater my my been sitting around the campfire hearing a hunting story it's going to be greater than hearing somebody else's testimony I'm going to have a testimony myself it is expedient for you that I go away for if I go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if I depart I will send him unto you just so there's no confusion to send two people it's the same God fulfilling one office in order to bring one another office into manifestation is that right because you you in order to be a father you first have got to be a husband come on now one office leads to another office man I feel like running right now John 14 18. let's just let's just deal with it now I will not leave yet effortless I will come to you it wasn't us receiving the body but the same one who was in that body that was appearing and making himself known as the Messiah he said I will come to you when I have been offered up when the sacrifice is made that expediency that I go away back then when I'm seated there in the right hand of the Majesty on high meaning power and authority let me tell you something the devil ain't got no power over you you don't know what I'm bound with there's one who already raised he's seated in power and honor and Glory why don't you just let the Rays of the strength of the son shine down in your life [Music] hmm yet a little while in the world see me no more but you'll see me thank you Lord they ain't going to see the Corporal body no more all they're going to be able to talk about it'll just be history but you'll see me because I live you shall live also you know what it is Hallelujah it's he who has the policy coming among policyholders [Applause] self to be the same I said who are the policyholders are you a policy holder [Applause] policyholder now just stay with me now but because the policyholders are those that are named and included in the Testament of his will they are the names that have been wrote before the foundation of the world Revelations 13 8 when the lamb will slain before the foundation of the world you know what it's saying there is a security in our identity in the lab because you are the word you always were the word you can never be deceived what is it brother Samuel you are ordained to receive life [Music] can I save this person up you are ordained to recognize him in this generation in this day to see him that is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and he was announcing to them when he rose up the same life that has quickened me and raised me up I'm sending it back to you not only have I come to be the blessing I've come to share the blessing and the very essence of the message that I'm releasing to you is I am alive and because I live you shall live also it's the light that's vindicating it is that right he was a comforter when he was with him right but he told them that it was necessary that I go away because if I don't go away the comforter can't come he is the Waymaker for the comforter to come is that right he still is the Waymaker for the comforter to come so he's speaking to policyholders now I wanted to say it like this you know there's appropriate channels for benefits to be released you know we're living probably in a day and age and I guess everybody's been done you've got some real corrupt people that'll take life insurance policies out on their loved ones and their loved ones don't even know it well it's just a spirit of this age lovers of themselves more than lovers of God come on Friends but you see I want you to notice that there's appropriate channels for these benefits to be released because if you're if you're a beneficiary on a life insurance policy you need to file a claim with a company in order to collect the death benefit the benefit ain't just going to come to your mailbox because you're included in it you've got to recognize I'm included in it and then you get a file for a claim this part belongs to me come on now Acts chapter 1 verse 4 and need notice being assembled together with them he commanded they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which saith he ye have heard of me notice he was declaring them he had already breathed upon them receive ye the promise of the Holy Ghost for John truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me now this power is God's dunamis power that's his quickening power John 1 I believe it's 1 16 said he came to his own and his own received him not but as many have received him to them he gave the power escousia not due to miss cusia is the right to become sons of God so he is coming to you his appearing to you is ministering our rights that are included in the policy that then by faith how do we get Faith by his appearing and we recognize he's speaking to me then we can go and draw upon the benefits of the policy oh my no wonder David could say in Psalm 16 11 thou Wilt show me the path of life now I'll just say it like this you know it's a responsibility here of the policyholder whoever takes it out you know a lot of times you have loved ones you have different ones that take out those policies and uh I know sometimes they may not want to tell who's on it or whatever because such loving families we'll make the Hat Hat Films and McCoys look like kindergarteners and they got their pistol behind their back at the funeral waiting for the funeral to come in so we're going to start taking heads off so sometimes they do those things but I'm not talking about the colonel realm I'm talking about in that of the spiritual Realm because it's really the the ideal like when I when I did a reading on this part of it just looking over some things the ideal way is for the person who takes out the policy is to make it known to the people who are on it are you hearing me now the person who takes out the policy to make known to the people while they are alive while they are with them while you can touch me and I can say William you are included you're not but William you're included in my policy I'm alive right now right you can handle me right you you can look right at me and me being alive is letting you know that once I pass from this realm to that realm that you now can draw on the benefits of that policy and that's why the Lord Jesus when he makes himself alive and known and appears to you and I according to his word he is letting you and I know that you are in the policy that word it is something that's gripping your life it's taking a hold of your life it's something you can't get away from it has a meaning to you there's things you can't explain why because your name is included in the policy [Applause] but you've got to draw on the benefits of that policy it'll do you no good unless you draw on the benefits you can walk around all day long and say well you know I'm a I'm a benefit policyholder you are yeah they left me you know 250 000 they did yeah they did have you handled any of it no ain't seen none of it now somebody could have a right to call you a liar because you're saying you got a claim on a policy and somebody put your name on it and they are no longer here but you're included in their policy and you say no I've not received what's included in that policy then they've got a right to doubt who you say you are but when you file a claim upon that then you receive what is in the claim and then they can ask you and say did you receive all that was in the writing what the writing promise have you received it and they can say I have received all that was promised unto me and that's what the real baptism of the Holy Ghost is it's the holy ghost coming right Among Us it's Ministry speaking his word and he's calling us to what recognize the benefits that belong to you and I as believers it would be a shame to have benefits and not exercise our Authority in them he is coming to energize our faith in him I got one more little turn here Leviticus 23 there's no way I've got a many turn but there's no way I get to all them Leviticus 23 right here the Bible tells us not here Moses is prophesying of the time that when Israel is going to come into the land when you come into that land now notice in verse 10 of Leviticus 23 speaking to the children of Israel and saying to them when you become into the land which I give you and shall reap the Harvest thereof then ye shall bring a sheath of the first fruits of your Harvest unto the priest now notice you will bring a sheep when you get in the land in the position that place that I've given to you you bring a sheath to the priest to be accepted for you verse 11 and he shall wave the sheath before the Lord to be accepted for you on the more after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it now that she that was that of a seed that had went in the ground and it had come up though that that that part of the field it had come up and come to maturity first in other words it was had went in the ground as a sheet and he had come all the way up through that of you know shouting a sprouting tassel and shut all the way back to the original form once again and now when you come into the land then think about it they would not be able to come into the land until the Harvest would be ready remember when God brought them in the land he rained down Manna but after then that Manna had ceased they were circumcised they ate the old corn of the Lamb what were they eating they were partaking of resurrection power seed that had went in the ground and had come back up to life and they were living of resurrection power so God knows exactly that's why it's not a random event that's why the Lord Jesus it was no happenstance that he was taken there on the 10th day and crucified there it was no happenstance that he fulfilled healed every Prophecy of the scripture can I say this it's no happenstance that we are here this morning it's not a random event of where we're standing and scriptures are being fulfilled [Music] man Hallelujah let me just say like the prophet said he said the New Testament speaks of this hour the whole new testament speaks of this hour glory be to God because this is the hour of the Bride the hour where the groom is veiled in Pride form [Applause] who are you you are his victory [Music] the waving of the sheep was a testimony there's more coming [Music] I don't care how many websites you put out there's more coming [Music] I don't care how many unbelieving Devils they're still coming why you can't stop God's word though many disbelief it cannot hinder God I don't care how many skeptic tries you can't stop the fulfilling of God's word [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that way she was a sign it's in effect that's why the prophet let me just slow down just a moment here that's why the prophet could declare now think of it he's standing here in 1963. and he's declaring to the people he's been here all along the token is now manifesting himself right Among Us proving he's the same Jesus so the token is him he's right Among Us his appearing the wave sheep what's he doing he's making himself known to policy holders whose names are in the book well who's the one declaring the names in the book the same one that descended with a little book in his hand what's a little book it's the lamb section come on now fear not little flock it's the father's Good Will to give you the kingdom that's why God ain't in numbers God don't need numbers God just needs surrendered hearts [Applause] it's the same token Among Us Now notice whatever the token did then he's the same yesterday today and forever The Works that I do shall you do also right so therefore the token itself it cannot be present fully in a life if a life says well I don't know about that part of the word that's not the token because he cannot deny himself oh that's not necessary he cannot deny himself are you hearing me that see this is what separates this is what separates this is what makes who says he is who he says he is he is let me just try to tie this up now he says who he says he is he is who that he who he is now think about it when you're looking at a token I know this is simple but I just want to drop this and putting it in very clear because as a token when you know you know when I've had to buy buy airplane tickets I might have the money I could go right up and say you know what I'm going to go to the Delta counter over here and I'm going to send them in the cash or you know I can go to the plane I'm getting on that plane or train the bus now let me ask you I could go up there and I could have a wad of cash in my wallet in my pocket had be a different feeling I don't know what it feels like but you can walk up there to the gate first of all you ain't even going to get to the gate nowadays I don't care how much cash you got right and you better have flight oh this could preach you better have flight ready symbols on your license right now or you're packing a passport to fly domestically are you hearing me now hold my I think it's a time of seal in it it's a time to say I'm flat ready I've already been pre-approved [Applause] shown the proper documentation I've went through yeah it was a hassle but I went through it now all I got to do is show them there the identity I've got a seal on my license that says I'm approved to fly domestically I've already been cleared I am who I am [Applause] I don't know and the token is an identification of his presence in our life because you could have all the money in the world but you got to have the ticket because when you go through those Gates they want to see they want to scan my ticket then they want to see my license they want to take that because I'm not just scanning my license they want to know okay this is your license but now that ticket it lets me know that you have got a flight that is scheduled for departure [Applause] in other words you wouldn't be here right now if you didn't have a flight to catch [Music] has come among us because it's time for us to catch a flight home brother we ain't going in an airplane amen this is the astronaut age an age where lies it's scared escape the pool of gravity escape the pool of the world escape the sin the flesh the gavel and everything this is a rapturing age a rapturing moment and I have been approved by Christ himself mama mama so let me say it like this the chief engineer is present [Applause] you know brother Ram talks about that little guy that was out there you know working on the car the brand said he touched this to this to that to the you know I kind of put myself there when I had to work on a lawnmower or whatever you know what you're doing not a clue [Laughter] thank God for a little bit of YouTube videos for other people who didn't have a clue but now they've got Clues and they can get all the clues together but he was touching this wire to this wire to this wire to that wire nothing happened this this try to check this out change that this isn't doing but look he was very busy you hear me he was very busy changing this changing that trying this trying to trying to trying this trying to you couldn't say he wanted a worker he was a worker but the problem with it was is he didn't know how to order the things but here came one up he didn't have grease up to his elbows he came up in a suit and tie he looked over and he said hey he's a guy can I share something with you now what if that little guy would have looked up and said you ain't even got grease under your fingernails and you're going to tell me something but I believe I believe God bringing this spiritual I believe there was a presence that's there I believe there's a presence that moves Upon Our Hearts that brings humility you say brother Samuel that sounds Supernatural it's all Supernatural it's pretty super how this natural responds to the supernatural and here he was he looks up at that man he said what is it he said well if you'll Touch This to this and move this right here this wire it should start for you so he did that all he had to do was do what was said he obeyed he said how do you know he obeyed because he did it he did it yeah he did it he sacrificed all of his however he sacrificed it and he obeyed got in turn the key started up when it started up he came out he wasn't just saying glory to God it started Glory they got to start he came out when it started he said who are you you see he recognized somebody knew this situation and he asked the man who are you he said I'm the one that designed that engine there's nobody oh you can struggle all your life trying to put this together put this together put this together put this together do this but the chief engineer if you only yield to his voice he'll let you know what to put together and the engine will run he's the one who knows how to turn on the lights he's the one who knows how to make Sons sons and daughters daughters this is why in Romans 8 10 if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you Oh my he wasn't just only the word but he was God himself it took mechanics and Dynamics coming together that body was laying there in the Tomb it was cold it was stiff it was dead but it took life it took the life Giver to come and raise him up again you know why he was pointing out what you and I would need to receive it would have to be God not a church Hallelujah the prophet was a vessel that the wave Chief himself has been waived over the people once again come on Friends it was a declaration this is a sign of his coming it's his appearing and he's letting you and I know the message was not to Rally around tapes not to Rally around books not to travel to Jerusalem or Jeffersonville but the message is get under the blood get in Christ be full Uncle Holy Ghost that's what the message is all about um and the bride herself let me tell you the bride is standing upon Earth she's standing we're not a fragmented bunch of people we have been brought together by the spirit of almighty God and the same spirit of God that has brought us together with him he'll dissolve all differences he'll settle all doubts come on Friends it ain't up for you and I to get into baiting with one another but let him be the Difference Maker falling in love with the Lord Jesus Christ let him be glorified in his body let him be glorified in your life it's a testimony you and I are called to let him be seen in your life [Music] I say today this is where you recognize brother Brandon would say he had not only filled their spirit inside but it quickened their mechanics so they just didn't feel their Spirit where they felt the anointing upon them but he went down upon that seed because that's what the Holy Ghost was for the Holy Ghost was not to fall upon our spirit to where we would only you know speak in tongues if that comes or prophesy or preach or when they it went for that the word the Holy Spirit was come to make the word live where the word was laying in our life cold dead beneath the darkness of Genesis 1 beneath the darkness of our life let me tell you something we just weren't in darkness we were Darkness Paul said ye sometimes were Darkness but now are ye light in the Lord how are you liked because he is the light and he has come to light up your life let me just say it like this how will the world know that he lives how will they know I'm grateful that I know and I've experienced being a benefit policyholder aren't you I mean I can share with somebody else hey he means what he says and let me just tell you this every promise in him is ye and amen when I need healing amen when I need to live all included all that I have need of is included in this policy bless the Lord O my soul and all that is within me and forget not all his benefits glory be to go nice but how will others know the only way they'll know is when they see Jesus in you and me is that right that's the only way they'll know it brother Bram says when the spirit of God in man in you manifests the life of Jesus like the main spring in a watch every tick every part of it moves right it controls your emotions I like that the mainspring controls my emotions it controls your habits it controls your senses it controls your faith that's what it does think about when they were Israel in the midst of a battle here was a man that fell they were running what did they do they just threw that body in there into the grave they didn't know hearing what they'd thrown it on here was here was the bones of Elijah Elijah was already gone to Glory Rock but then quick at quickening power that resided in that life was still there upon Them Bones it wasn't the bones that brought that man to life it was the quickening power yeah well Mom and Daddy it's not your efforts that bring them to life should
