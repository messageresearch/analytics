um let's go here in the scripture to job 23 want to say it just as uh what a weekend the lord gave us and uh just such a a wonderful time in the presence of the Lord um just so enjoyed Saturday even evening enjoyed that time and uh just was a real time of refreshing with the with the worship singing and the testimonies and U so enjoyed the ministering of the word uh I just uh with the thoughts and that God shared I I love I just love how the Lord just just brought everything so personal uh I I thought you know I I told brother Trevor on the phone just yesterday I said you know I said God brought it from the heavenlies and put it in a lunchbox I said that's what I love that's what I love God makes his word so simple and uh many many wonderful things I that God spoke to us and I just I know that I know that in our hearts one of the things that we would long to do and I think sometimes we the enemy likes to get us so busy sometimes with things but may we may we not let our mind Drift from the things that God has spoke to us on because anytime in any service when God comes like that to me it speaks so personal what that is when God brings his word it's God calling us over remember when brother bam said that uh he the the the the that crowbar was given and it ripped off the top of the mountain and he's told them he says look upon these things and then he went on off to the West I mean there was a time we understand that all symbolic the prophet passing on but what was given in this hour look upon that word and that which was uncovered and I look at that that every time that God speaks to our hearts that's God calling you and I to look on these things and there's things that sometimes we don't all together you know how it is we don't all together get it sometimes in one setting but there's things that little nuggets that we need to get in that setting that it'll stand out to us and uh for myself I I I sat there many times you know and I sometimes I'm just sitting and I'm taking I'm taking the notes sometimes the thought is so good I just write down uh uh one hour and 45 minute Mark so I can go back on YouTube and come back to this spot it's just I can't write all that that part down that thought but there's just so many good thoughts that God's expressed and he spoke to our hearts on that of alone and loneliness and so uh we just want to look here in the word of the Lord just for a few moments tonight back in job 23 and verse 13 and it says but he is in one mind and who can turn him and what his soul desireth even that he doeth for he performeth the thing that is appointed for me and many such things are with him therefore am I troubled at his presence when I consider I am Afra afraid of him for God maketh my heart soft and the almighty troubleth me because I was not cut off before the darkness neither hath he covered the darkness from my face and I just like to continue on that thought tonight on having the right perception so may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated uh just feeling in my heart to stay with this this part of it tonight it was just really kind of torn between two parts even up to the moments back there and just looking at this thought on on perception and we often times know the word of of perceiving and sometimes that in itself is uh it's left open really to interpretation sometimes the way we can even uh look at events and uh and go about things is sometimes even from previous things that we've uh experienced In Our Lifetime and uh when we find that that I'm sure there's not one of us in here that hasn't at one time or another had the wrong perception about something and we whether it would have been something about you know of what God's thinking us concerning us or something about us or something we've looked at in the word maybe it was just a wrong perception of how that you were perceiving things that were going on at the job I know sometimes brother brandham talked about it and and I can relate to it as well sometimes you can look out on a congregation and if you simply sometimes just look sometimes at what you see it might look like that people are in complete disagreement with it but yet and sometimes you'll turn right back around and it'll be the very person or persons that will come up to you later not not just here sometimes at a meeting and it'll come up to you and say this is exactly what I needed to hear from God now in reality who was it that was the problem I know that seems odd that something like that could even be right here while I would be standing and ministering but brother Bram even tells us that even while he's standing and preaching he the sickness in his body he says I'm having to take the opposite thought of this right now to keep from pitching over this Podium so sometimes it's things that we look at you know and I thank God and I we come through those experiences in our life that where God would help us and you know does it mean that we'll never be tested in that again does it mean that we'll never have a thought that might not come in that would be wrong no it doesn't mean that at all but where it comes down to is that Lord help me that in everything that does come in let me try it by you because sometimes there's things that we can try the world we can can try the thought and we might have an absolute scripture that would absolutely speak or be expressive against that but then there's other times where the thoughts that come in we have to try it based on the very character and nature of almighty God so I ask that God would just help us and give us the grace that we need because we all have been in those times and places of the wrong perception and interpret things the wrong way and I'm thankful to God for his Grace that would bring us around just like I I read to you uh some quotes or a quote last week and to me it's always been an interesting study not a lot of quotes but there is a number of them is over the time of I used to think brother BR talks about how he says I used to think dancing in the spirit was wrong he said I used to think tongues was wrong and then I quoted one to you which brother Ram quotes over and over all the way through the seals he said I used to think God was angry with me but Christ loved me then he said I've come to find out another place I've come to realize that Christ is the very Heart Of God so to understand what God thought about me or thinks about you and the prophet would even quote that in the seals is to understand that God himself loved you and I so much that he was willing to condens send and become one of us to pay the price and to that he might impart his life back to you and I now this a perception it's a way of understanding something sometimes it's a mental impression of something or in way of interpreting something a quote that I read to you last week out of three kinds of Believers and I I think this is so fitting of how the prophet places it here and he says regarding job and job's thoughts as long as Satan can make him believe that his sickness was his God doing it he had job whipped it wasn't God doing it it was Satan doing it and the same thing today he'll try to tell you these trials and things as your God trying to put punishment upon you it isn't no sir it's Satan doing it and God permitting it to temper you probably no doubt different ones Brother Ray and others that worked in the steel mill we realize that what it means for something to be tempered it means to where it actually grows to a great place of of hardening or able to Bear because we we never want to be able the Bible doesn't say become hard but it says endure hardness as a good soldier so not to become hard and that in itself it really takes the work of the holy spirit that we would not become hardened and and bitter and with all of the cares and things that maybe that we could go through in life and I'll tell you one of the secrets for that is our relationship with almighty God we we need a continual refilling of the Holy Ghost and I want you to think about this that the Holy Spirit himself is God's Own love now let me just finish reading this quote and I'll move on he says what it is it's to make you see if you are tied to this Earth by the Earth cares or whether your Treasures is in heaven now I want you to think about this if God knows that I would somehow be tied to the Earth or there would be a strong pull if God knew that then why is it that God would want me to see that because I am a son you're a son or daughter of God and as a son and daughter of God God does not push us through a pipe or pull us through a pipe and say blessed is he that overcometh but the prophet tells us of all the promises that are laying before us he said but you have a decision yourself to make and the way that we show our faith in God is by the decisions we make regarding the promises based on who said it so to make you see whether you're tied to this Earth by the Earth cares or whether your treasure is in heaven for wherever your treasure is there you are also your heart is where your Treasures are now I want you to think about this in Romans chapter 5 the the Bible says therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in the hope of the glory of God and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience so there's absolutely no other way for our patience to grow outside of tribulation now think about that even when you look at the stature of a perfect man brother B will talk about it and I don't know how far he put his fingers apart when he's preaching is your life worthy of the Gospel but he says your patience starts out about this long and he said then eventually it gets to be this long I don't know how how far apart he put his fingers but I get the gist of it is that our patience will actually grow but you see patience itself like all the other virtues never grow unless there is a contrast to it or opposition so all of those things with those virtues they actually grow in our life and that of adding to it deals with an actual increase so and not only so but we glory in tribulations also now I don't know about you but I still look at that and say God help me to recognize it and to be able to glory in tribulations now now I'm not worshiping the sickness I'm not worshiping the trial but what it is in the midst of it is to know coming to a place to understand that when tribulation comes around that tribulation is in no sign of God's disapproval toward me his our only sign of approval is our Acceptance in the Beloved and if there's anything that's out of line God will let you and I know about it in other words our worship it's our rejoicing the way that we would conduct our life as Believers does not cease when tribulations come our way if there was something to where that as a life could run right back out into the world oh this was a hard time or this situation came or and you know sometimes there are great great situations that can come when you think about it I think back when I was a Believer or a Christian starting out in my journey there were things that came around in that very part of it that tested and things would come that was very disappointing things that didn't go exactly the way that maybe I wanted it to go or was thinking it was going to go or praying about it but when it all comes down to the end of the way God himself already knew that but God allowed that moment of testing and trying not to show to himself but for God to bring out in our lives that trust in him and that you and I might see there's something deeper than my abilities that's holding on this is something greater than me going to school and saying well I'm not going to get caught into bad jokes I'm not going to get caught up in the swearing with the boys again I'm not going to get in I've been there done that but it had to come something to where there was something down in my heart what was it it was a desire that though I didn't understand what was going on my love for God was greater than all of my understanding it was greater Than My reasonings it was greater than all of my wants I could cry because my wants were not being fulfilled I could weep but yet down on the midst of it there was an anchor something that was holding and that was the love of God now what I just gave you in a may maybe a measure of paragraph I could not have explained that at that time when I was disappointed and things didn't go I couldn't have explained it that way but it just goes to show you it isn't about how much you can explain God lets you know what he's done after he's done it and you can look back at it down in your life and say there was something greater there than my abilities oh my and not only so we glory in Tribulation knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience and experience hope so you know when you have been patient throughout the and what what allows us to be patient faith faith yeah and faith is not about knowing how things will happen or when that that's not faith faith just says God said so God said so I just was reading today where the Prophet said when you can take God at his word in a place of God said so then he said it opens up a stream between you and God it's just that simple God said so it's not about me God said so and if God's made a promise I am don't have the ability to bring myself in the condition for that promise to be fulfilled but the same God who spoke it is the same God that brings the conditions how does he do that by our hearts being surrendered how is my heart surrendered because as God speaks to us we realize this is God's mind this is God's thought this is God's interest concerning my life and it brings faith my my an experience brings hope and hope meaning an expectation that I don't know how through so through ex examples and situation just like the older veterans that are here tonight there is when they would come and you could talk with them that have been serving the lord for a great number of time they've been through a lot of Trials they've been through a lot of heartaches they've been through a lot of disappointments they've had a lot of times where God said no they've had a lot of times where situations did not turn out the way they thought they would turn out but in the midst of it all there was something deeper within their life that held them and that was the love of God to where that they themselves can stand and expect God to fulfill his word how can you do that when you have prayed and maybe this situation in your home did not go according to how you prayed well just because I was looking for it to happen this way or this timeline or this time frame has that doesn't mean anything to do with God's word if there's anything that's wrong it was my perception regarding it Hallelujah now let me just stop here think about when John when here he sees the Lamb of God he said Behold the Lamb of God it was identified by the pillar of fire and John himself after that's left he as he said to his disciples go ask if he's the one when he's down in prison or do we look for another now how could a man that would stand there in the midst of that time say such a thing like that this is why when brother Brandon preaches the Forgotten beatitude he takes that scripture and it's a beatitude that's actually stuck in the middle of of other scriptures blessed is he that is not offended in me and notice John himself did not have the right perception but yet what he spoke was right on the money is that right it was right on the money but the word came to John and let John know that go tell John what you see taking place and when John could hear what was taking place what did it do it opened up or it changed his perception hallelujah how I feel is God let my perception always be open to you cuz sometimes you know I understand where the Prophet as he tells us and I always love this quote out of what shall I do with Jesus called Christ and brother BR says if you can get a vision of a perfectly he person standing in front of you he said then you walk step by step by step until you become that person and that is very that that is right on but how how the whole part the whole path of the journey how all of that comes out I don't know that Faith doesn't have to know Faith does not need to know all the steps along the way faith is simply God said so that's it right that's now job listen job has not heard or received a change of thought from God I read we read those uh groups of scriptures last week where job himself the things that he his perception of of things that are taking place in his life but his perception was wrong right job had an anchor he had an anchor and where he stood he stood on what God had revealed let me tell you something you stand you're tested you and I are tested on every word that God reveals to you and I God just doesn't give a word and say well that word's P you've received this word that word is to become flesh in our life and the only way it can become flesh is where we die to ourself and God allows the testing and the trials to come our way what do I do stand on that word I haven't heard from God concerning anything else stand on what he's revealed [Music] you because if God wants you to know anything else he'll tell you until that time you stay put until orders come stand upon that word hallelujah let me tell you friends no matter how much you would feel so encamped and surrounded and encircled by the enemy let me just tell you something there's not enough Devils to keep the dove of the Holy Spirit from Landing in the camp of God's Believers I don't care how many guns of doubt and unbelief can be focused upon it the holy spirit will always find its Mark in the lives of his children verse five my and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God this is the key is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us thank you oh my it's God taking over it's God moving in our life look at look at this out of the message Divine love I love this quote brother BR says doc used to sing a little song let me walk with a Heavenly Dove fill my way each day with love he said I used to think of that and this love would begin to pour out extra we got love but we need the abundance of love the overflowing of love oh my go on down to the next paragraph he says you say I love the Lord but can you trust him when the doctor shakes his head can you trust him when everything else is gone you need an overflowing baptism of love divine love I just say you I've I've looked at over and over and over throughout the times and I just say God I want an overflowing baptism brother the S you want more yes I want more when I have friends listen when I look and I see I see too much Samuel I said God I need more of your love I need more of your love you know we can can try to correct this over here and correct that over there and correct this over here and God said just get more more of me and it'll take care of those other things that's what we need is more of God more of the love of God when you find yourself a little prickly said God I need more of the love of God you find yourself getting a little jealous Lord I need more of the love of God hallelujah God an overflowing baptism not not of my love not of my love my my my love will it wears out yeah I need his love I need more of divine love my love as much as I could try to smooth it up and Patch it over and you know put all kinds of stuff on it like you know you have rust and paint flakes on a car you could try to patch it all over it still is not enough but it takes the love of God in order to bring forth in order for you and I to be able to stand like we need to stand oh my and God allow listen God allows situations to arise don't get down on yourself because you find yourself into a place and say I shouldn't have this thought or this shouldn't be or that perception or I shouldn't be thinking this way or don't don't don't let the enemy get you and beat you in a corner but just say Lord I need an overflowing baptism of love I need more of the love of God invite his presence just to come down and overwhelm you aresh when it seems like you pray and your prayer is not answered do you still love him is there something that keeps purging you on oh that's God's Sovereign Grace and it has to take over it's got to it's God's nature God can't do nothing else but do that amen I want to go to Ruth chapter 1: 19 here is Naomi and Ruth coming back home or has already departed in verse 19 so they two went until they came to Bethlehem and it came to pass when they were Come to Bethlehem that all the city was moved about them and they said is this Naomi and she said unto them call me not Naomi call me Mara for the almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me I went out full and the Lord hath brought me home again empty why then call ye me Naomi seeing the Lord hath testified against me and the almighty hath Afflicted me so Naomi returned and Ruth the moabitas her daughter-in-law with her which returned out of the country of Moab and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley Harvest now there's many wonderful types in there and I I I love preaching types but I I just want to just speak of one point and one thought here brother B takes an in there about Naomi in the message the kinsman redeemer and I want you to think about this Naomi her husband and their boys had left the land that God gave them they had an inheritance in this land and remember brother brand would say this over and over we see it in the scripture every time a Jew got out of Palestine they got in trouble because that's the god-given land and any time you or I get out of what God has given us is going to be trouble now we understand friends that not every time is when tests or trials or things come our way we understand that that is not always when things uh adversity comes is it correction but neither do we want to just walk with an assumption or have a perception an imagination in our heart that well everything is okay we can look clearly in God's word and say lord it's not just about what I feel but is everything that is laid out before me am I living according to all that you have said Do Is My Life walking in obedience with you now they got outside of the land and we understand what took place here amalec her husband passes on you know her sons that married those two moabite women Ora and Ruth they passed away too and then you find that when they both are coming with Naomi and they're going to go back into the land you know there was a an affinity and a tithe that they had there you know a resp responsibility that wasn't wrong to have that kind of a responsibility to want to care for their mother-in-law but it was something to where that only took was one word from Naomi to say go back to your land because what if I could even bear any more Sons would you still be old enough to receive him it took just one little word of discouragement for orpa to say yeah that's good by but for Ruth think about it I want you to think she's a moit hallu there's a curse over them she does not know what beholds or what awaits her she does not have any promise seemingly in the land that's true amen amazing but she is moved Hallelujah brother Brandon would say like this she had a vision oh yeah it was a decision she made right here in chapter one The Prophet says that actually later on got boaz's attention her simple simple statement of your God will be my God your people will be my people where you stay I'll stay where you go I'm going to go that simple statement of obedience of simply saying Lord I am just going to take you at your word amen amen Naomi comes back in and her announcement she's told the people they're all well they're all glad to see her oh it's so good to see you Naomi and Naomi comes back in but she says call me Mara there's been through bitter experiences we understand this with the Jews and coming back into their land and even in the time we're standing of barley Harvest but to think how the prophet would speak of it like this Naomi wondered in the kinsman redeemer she wondered how many of you and I have wondered yeah why has the hand of the Lord been so cruel to me my daughter-in-laws God has cast me out I'm an outcast I don't know what I ever done but I'm an outcast now to think about this I don't know what I ever done but yet we realize we understand that there was a part in it that Naomi and their family left to go into another land right you know you would look at and you would consider why isn't Naomi the only one that comes back or the one that's returning well in order there had to be somebody that would be able to bring Ruth in right it had to be that of a gentile Gentile had to be that of coming through a Jew and then a gentile would come in but you know re Ruth it would not have been enough for Ruth and Ruth's husband to have come back in the land because she would have still have been seemingly like an outcast but God himself would bring it and Lead it to a place to where here Naomi is coming back in with her daughter-in-law she does not know all that is going to transpire she cannot just walk in there and say I'm taking my inheritance back but God has made made provision so in all of her wonderings no doubt it seemed strange the prophet said sometimes it seems strange the way that God will lead us to do certain things he said but we find out when it is in the predestinated plan of God there is nothing can stop God's plan from coming to pass look at this God was working his program but he didn't have have to explain it to Naomi right we understand what took place between Ruth and Boaz and even how that Ruth herself would come and you know here here She is she comes into a field Ruth herself does not even know whose field this is or even if she did she still doesn't know the significance of him and when she comes into the field Boaz begins to notice her day after day and bohas tells those of the Reapers he says I want you to leave handfuls of meal that she might pick it up it was little handfuls that she gathered it was Promises of God that she was gathering she still does not have any promise she doesn't know what's going to come next but she is obedient to what is before her that's what God calls you and I to do it's sometimes the greatest thing the Great greatest compliment that we can give God remember brother B says the greatest compliment is to believe God because what God has said is true that's the greatest compliment so how do we believe God we believe him and it shows in obedience and here she's taking up these handful after handful and then we understand as What It All Leads to to where that here Ruth herself ends up coming into the C through that Union with Boaz and brother brand was saiding like this God was working his program because all things work together for good to them that love God no matter what it is I'm sure there's a lot of things that's may be taking place whether it's family whether it's other things we would not have chosen things to occur the way they did or thought about them in that way but God knows exactly what to do to get you and I or even others into a place where he can speak to them I'm glad he don't ask me because I would tell him no I don't want that done but yet you know what something about I believe with my heart that there is something greater inside of me and inside of you like it was for Hatty Wright Hatty Wright could have asked for material things she could ask for a million dollars she could ask for her her little sister Edith who dealt with that that condition the whole time and brother Bram would say over and over I don't understand why God hadn't healed her brother BR say that in tapes but yet she could ask for that and the prophet standing there and letting her know what you can ask for your mom your dad all these other things but what she asked for was something of an eternal value brother Samuel what do you say I'm saying like this that there may be the way that when we're looking about praying for our loved ones instead of praying for God to bless them ask God lord deal with their hearts to where they come to a place that they recognize they need you I don't care maybe how downtrod they are or how successful they are bring them to a place Lord that they realize without you they're naked yes sir because why that's the more eternal part amen oh God help us let me try to let me try to move on here Mark chapter 16 verse 17 I want to read this scripture here A Familiar scripture to us as Believers and we believe Mark 16's inspired we believe these scriptures we believe this we're Witnesses of this right here and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover oh yes oh yes those are the general orders and they've never [Music] changed hallelujah what that says right there is there's anything that gets between a Believer and the promise God has equipped you and I with victory in our lives to overcome it amen I want to deal with that last little part just a few moments here and they shall recover brother brandham you know when you go through and listening to the messages a trial the trial a court trial you know brother Bram will take those messages and uh dealing with uh these fellas in there by the name of Mr unbeliever Mr skeptic and Mr impatient brother br will take it down through Abraham's life Noah's life and all this you'll find brother brandham in the midst of that message sitting out now he said I'm just he said this isn't me this is I'm just saying what the prosecutor would say in other words I ain't even started yet as the defense witness oh I just love those little things like that pH glory be to God but you know brother B says how that Noah you know Noah was given a promise 120 years how that it was it was you know rain was coming and rain and you know God and Noah was given that promise and brother Brandon would tell us you know like this of how that the defense went us you know standing because Noah faced every one of these things before him brother BR calls it like this he says Noah he wants to wants to also let this court know that Mr unbeliever Mr skeptic and Mr impatient tempted him all along are you hearing me they did not look at Noah and say he's a prophet of God with a word they tempted him all along everything let me let me tell you something these the way all of this right here these are supernatural beings when the prophet's calling him Mr unbeliever Mr skeptic and Mr impatient he goes on and says these are Supernatural characters they're demons don't ever just think that a thought is a thought a thought is a spirit it comes from somewhere and project it in your mind this is why brother Brandon when he would preach that message three kinds of believers and lay it all the way out well you know it would be very easy I'm sure everybody would say well man I'm a Believer and I trust that we can always identify with that but I love how the prophet comes at the end of that message it's a about the last uh 18 minutes of that message and brother Brandon begins to go into prayer and he tells the people he says look out of what's been preached today if you find yourself in one of these other categories he said I'm standing here to offer a prayer of intercessory I'm here to pray and that there's something that you find in your heart or your life that won't line up with God's word but you say Lord I see it in your word I don't understand it but I want to believe it he said why don't you raise your hand and will offer prayer right now what are you saying brother Samuel that the devil is not the amen God is the amen and your condition right now even a category or even something that can be in your mind or in your body is not the finality but God In His Marvelous Grace can give such strength can breathe such inspiration such Faith to move from one category to another to move a life from sickness to health sinner to Saint and let me just say this to you this wasn't brother brandham going out on a limb he's standing on the word of God you say what word is that back in John chapter 17 father I would that they would be with me where I am also and that prayer of intercession by the Lord Jesus was reflective of where you and I were before the before the world begin in the mind of God so we're not out on a limb we're right in the word even where Paul could say I pray that your understanding being open Hallelujah yeah Hallelujah tempted him all along but being a prophet knowing that God could not lie he held on to the word regardless praise the Lord Brother BR tells us of how that Noah conflict between God and Satan Noah got in the ark door was shut remember God called them from inside the ark come in God closed the door and then when they got inside the door and it was closed all shut up Noah said tomorrow morning wait boys it's going to rain now I'm quoting what the prophet said in conflict between God and Satan and no rain came second morning Noah had said it's going to rain tomorrow boys no rain third day no rain the fourth day they almost got their smartphone out and looked on YouTube calling they were about to look up doubt the sign you know then here came the fifth day H boys it's going to be tomorrow and then oh the next day it's going to be tomorrow brother Samuel don't that bother you at all not at all because it shows a Believer when God has said something I'm not looking for it way out in the future it's right here faith is now if it ain't here tomorrow then I'll be looking for it to next day if it ain't there the next day I'll be looking for the next day if it ain't there at breakfast I'll be looking for it at lunch if it ain't at lunch I'll be looking for it at dinner and if you eat a midnight snack I'll be looking for it at the midnight snack ain't nothing wrong with that that's having the right perception the prophet said Believers when they receive a promise from God they're on their toes I wonder how many times Mr skeptic come along to him and said you ain't no boat builder you're nothing but a farmer who told you you could build a boat rightow well according to my abilities I'm disqualified but according to what he said I wonder how many times Mr skeptic looked at him and said H what do you think this is going to do putting a window clear up there three floors what in the world are you thinking getting wood wood that is so soft right soft to where he couldn't even take one test or trial without breaking oh but what you don't know it will not be the wood itself of its own fibers that will withstand the test and trials it will be the pitch of the atonement that is so wo into those fibers that will give it the ability to ride in the waters of judgment Skeptics coming to him Mr impatient how long you going to spend on that floor well I'm going to stay here until God tells me to move to the next floor how long are you going to continue to pray about that in your life I'm going to stand here claim that promise and pray about this until he tells me go to the next floor you see how do we defeat the enemy by standing on the word that God has given you don't have to explain it you don't have to have a whole Litany of quotes to do it or a whole thing of scriptures stand on the word that God has given [Music] you I wish I could preach right now they shall recover brother B takes them three guys Mr unbeliever skeptic and Mr impatient he talks about all them guys coming through you know Mr unbeliever he goes out right away brother B says ain't nothing to it and then he talk about how that you know Mr skeptic said you know I I went down to a meeting they were preaching the word and here I am sitting you know five years later I suffer with this for 15 years and 5 years later and I still got it so he just throws it aside right well there ain't nothing wrong with the promise there ain't nothing wrong with God then brother BR tells us even Mr impatient he said Mr impatient even set in the service and God under the anointing where it said if you shall say to this mountain be thou removed and if remove and don't doubt in your heart he said Mr impatient actually looked down at his legs and said legs you're not going to be crippled no more in the name of Jesus Christ but a little bit of time went by and Mr impatient said you you know what I got under that inspiration and there ain't a bit changed that's good this is this and this is I'm just paraphrasing the words actually quoting what the prophet said to me this is very powerful of how that things a pi can come under the inspiration and yet what it comes down to it really doesn't matter if you feel anything or not it's about when you're willing willing to stand on God's word it drops in your heart and you say you know what this is my promise I may not feel no different I may not feel anything but God said it and if I need a feeling God will give me a feeling he'll give what I have need of Hall think about that little woman we talked about her last week that little woman you know of the that uh of the zerath and here she was down there you know brother Bram would say it in one place of the message that it seemed it seemed like to her that God had forgot about her she was a real believer he said it would seem like to her she's pray she's standing on the word and yet God is silent I tell you we know where that stands as Believers there's sometimes where here you're praying about things and blessings might be dropping all around you but not on you sometimes God comes to test Us in that way to see what will you do will you still love me just as much will you trust me oh my oh I'm glad that God brings us into these moments to help us reflect friends I'm glad about he's a father and he's training us he's teaching us chastening itself is not all about correction matter of fact that word chastening it deals with the whole training of the child it's it's God training you and I God teaching you and I that's right brother Bram said sometimes this is out to be certain of God I'm just trying to Lord have mercy time I don't know where time goes he said how to he be certain of God brother BR said that little woman she knew that he was God and as the barrel went down down down down circumstances got worse and worse all the time but God was letting it get that way he just loves to do that he loves to put your faith to a test to see how you act on it let you be anointed and prayed for then make you worse say come on Satan put him to the test I know he believes me bless God forever oh my put him to a test now I know he took my word for it brother B said could he say that about you wow yeah I want to refer this refer this in a situation let me just say it like this when we think about times a lot of these things we think how in the world when you sometimes maybe could look back to the martyrs before you think how how in the world could I have done that there you you would have done that there just like you're doing it now the prophet tells us he said through your daily striving it's the same faith of the crowns of the martyrs God gives like brother B will go on to say he said for every one of them polycarp and the rest he said God gave he gives Supreme Grace for the Supreme hour you see what it is sometimes listen don't let the devil worry you and go well I don't know if I got rapturing faith I don't know it listen when you have need of rapturing faith it will will be there you say give me scripture on that glad you asked Genesis 22 Abraham said I am the lad are going to go Yonder and worship and come again how do you know that Abraham because God told me to go offer him up and he gave everything he had yes and Abraham heard the ram caught in a Thicket God gave rapturing faith when it was needed yes God giv what you have need of when you have need of it Hallelujah there's a sister here can I have just a few more moments please there's a sister this this testimony is been a testimony that uh listening through the message and out of the message OD Oddball and I I'm not going to maybe uh read it or maybe I should read it out of the message Oddball cuz I don't want to butcher it up but out of the message Oddball and brother R's talking about out of Chicago and he says how many know sister I don't know how to pronounce that name but say it againi putti that sounds like coming from a really Tiano from Chicago from Chicago yeah she had a mental nervous breakdown just recently very very bad but the morning in Chicago at the Christian business Men's breakfast I told the sister under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit she came back to one side and she couldn't hold herself together and I said sister you won't get over it right away but you're going to be well I said it'll either be 18 months or two years right in that bracket you'll be made well now the other day he says while speaking with her I heard her testifying so happy the happiest she had ever been in all her life she was riding in a car she had no peace the Pres presence of God seemed to have departed from her of course it was mental nerve you know and all of a sudden it returned with a great flow of joy and the power of the Holy Spirit was upon her she wept she cried she had a great time three or four weeks ago or month she and I heard her Testify the Sunday before laugh and said brother Brandon when I got back I marked down and took that tape and it was exactly 18 months to the day if she could take a promise take a tape and say God made a promise to me on this tape how much more you and I we could pick up our phone listening to a message listening to a scripture and it's inspired to you and I I tell you what I believe I'd put that thing on my screen my lock screen I believe I'd put it on my Opening screen I believe I put it as a notification as a reminder that God had me in [Applause] mind I wish I could just preach on that point how many knows that sometimes things don't always don't always happen the way that we think it's going to happen Bria if you jump down to that paragraph it says says it's in the message the unchangeable god it says now the thing is with the people it's that paragraph says now the thing is with the people now he's talking about taking God's word Above This taking his word planting the word and watering it said many times you said we want to make an idol out of God we ask God to do something and then he must do it just the way we ask it or we'll say he never answer answered when we do that we waken we weaken our faith in God and we weaken Our Testimony when we do not take him at his word God always answers yes ask and you shall receive seek and you shall find everyone that asks will receive everyone that seeks shall find everyone that knocks it'll be open to them that's the only way that I've always found it that I can get anything from God is take him at his word believe it the way he sends it he said now if we do not take it just the way that we think or it don't come that way we've built God as an idol he's got to answer just according to our ways or well it's just no good he didn't answer us God answers in many ways he answers in Peculiar ways times and everything is odd Hallelujah yes sir my this is why my even with all this with looking at at this let me just let me just stay with this part of it here tonight I remember when brother remember when brother Brandon was called to go down to miltown and uh he heard that crying of that little lamb in the midst of all those Thorns M Town was Georgie Carter brother Brandon went down down there and I I've been privileged to go down there been privileged to see where that little church was at and see where that house was at and we parked right there in front of it and and look at that those those moments you know it kind of gives you a visual of the things that you know because all of us sometimes when you read things we all get in our minds how things may be looked and things like that and that's just natural you know there a part of it to us but anyhow brother Bram when he goes down there he he don't he doesn't understand every every step of the way when he gets down there and you know uh one of the brothers there Mr Wright or brother Wright actually said I got to go down that way and sell some things anyhow at the market so brother Bram when he goes around you know there's something about a a church and he goes to that church or he goes by that church and you know something kept saying to him go over to the church go over to the church and brother Bram said you know I I'm just going to let me stand here till I uh till you go up on the hill he told Brother Wright that and he said um he asked brother Wright he said are they having Church there NOP and then now in in this message here I think I got this one this part in Brianna brother brandham says out of that message faith is the Sixth Sense he said I tried to open the door and the door wouldn't come open now remember he has received a voice that said go over to that church so well you don't just go over to the church just probably stand outside he goes over it and it won't come open he said heavenly father and this is what I want you to know it's very simple heavenly father is there something about this church the reason you called me is this Church what's all wound up in the brush is this what you're hollering miltown is this where you want me open that door for me I took a hold of the door it wouldn't open wow but I thought the Bible said when you pray believe what you have that you receive it that's true but it's according to how God gives it there was nothing wrong with the prophet praying that and saying the Lord is this it why did you send me over here and he prays and that he reaches to open the door and it don't come open you know why that was not the way that God was going to open the door about that time some man came walking around the church said how do you do I said how do you do sir do you want in that church yes sir I got the key and he opened the door so just because something hasn't moved when you prayed stay where God has told you to go he's got somebody and it ain't a man it ain't somebody like that but God knows how to bring the key that you'll recognize this is the key this is how I get in let me just read this last quote is that all right Oh Glory brother Brandon here in the message believe in God I I love this quote he said if God come down and healed me positive right out with a miracle it wouldn't be as great as it would if I can see the promise of God and take it into my heart that right there when you make a statement like that especially here amongst Pentecostal peoples that right there that perception but see what we're talking about is Royal Seed of Abraham Abraham went for 25 years sure Abraham has his ups and downs but Abraham believed god what happened as Abraham get back up his faith he's looking to God and God's directing him and his faith would grow stronger and stronger and stronger as a matter of fact brother B said when I get the feeling gloomy and blue he said I read Romans 4 and in this very very quote right here brother Brian that I read after he gets done reading Romans 4 this is the statement I don't have it up there but this is what he makes After reading Romans 4 where Abraham staggered not at the promise of God he said I could just hit the devil in the face with that for 365 days a year you're a liar this is the word and I'm healed amen that's right doesn't matter what I feel like doesn't matter what it looks like amen they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover could we stand together brother Bram says if he come down and healed me positive right out with a miracle it wouldn't be as great as if as it would if I could see the promise of God and take it into my heart stand there and I can say Jesus is is now healing me for I have accepted his word it's in my heart he is now interceding for me before the father I shall be well there is what God loves stand there on his word and say it's right he is healing me now every day what a perception yeah what a perception yeah sometimes the way things like I said they didn't haven't worked out the way that maybe I thought they'd work out hav't worked out and when things that I've prayed for hasn't come exactly how I thought it was going to be I know I'm speaking we speaking for everybody here that's right when whether it's been healing whether it's been praying for deliverance even for someone praying for some sometimes things itself they don't they you know what it is God shows us that he's still God and our perception sometimes we've all been there we maybe maybe even here tonight if we could just looking at and say Lord the thing I want to do is I might have an expectation but the thing that I want more than any anything else in the meantime while I'm waiting on you to fulfill that promise that you have made to me I just want to fall more in love with you Lord just let more of the love of God let it just come down more into me Lord yes Lord give me the strength I may need make me help me to be more patient help me the Lord through the me meantime while I'm waiting and through this test as I see the right perception it's not that you dislike me more than somebody else God doesn't have favorites in his kingdom God doesn't do that God doesn't do that God loves his children amen all the same offices gifts that that's not that's not a determination of God's love it's just those those are things that go into the body as God sets and there's responsibilities that comes with it but as far as God's love his love is elective his love is not more for for this person than it is for you God's love is the same for each one of his children but if in the midst of this time if you you know look friends even in this moment as I think we've looked at this if we can find ourselves in this place that we find thoughts and other things like that coming in say God I want what the prophet said an overflowing baptism of love I want more I want more of the love of God let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer heavenly father my Lord how that you have taken this [Music] tonight you know Lord every need and you know the hearts of your children Lord as I sat there Lord even earlier and left the office here and then on my way back here Lord my heart just burdened Lord which way do I go Lord I certainly believe with all my heart that you gave us Lord the that final nudge that was needed Lord Lord I Thank you I I don't want to take time but I realize that Lord years and years years ago it would have been Lord a greater struggle maybe there would have been something Lord I would have just taken a message cuz I was so nervous and went and preached it Lord You've you've helped me you've taught me Lord through various things and I'm still learning Papa Lord maybe through this Lord just that little bit of an Insight that your children could see sometimes Lord that things that we may not have a clear Direction or a clear answer we know where we're to be but I don't know Lord I'm standing seemingly like a fork in the road I I don't know Lord which direction but Lord if we can just stand just stand still Lord and just look to you and father you make known your will you you give that unction that we need Lord for that moment father there's needs that have we've read and that's upon hearts there's prayers Lord that's been prayed maybe there's hearts Lord here tonight that they have received a promise from you and like that little sister from Chicago that the prophet tells us about at the end of the Oddball you could have you could have told her when she was going through that time right then and there it could have just ceased but I believe Lord you included that not just so you could prove her stand as a Believer Lord I I want to believe I believe that you included and allowed these examples to be included for us you did it for us Lord that we can look in your word and like the prophet talks about how that prosecutor over and over wants to bring all kinds of accusations against you and say that you you failed to keep your word but yet Lord in even in that portion of scripture they shall recover you never gave a timeline you never even said how that recovery would take place but all healing comes from you Lord yes it does so may we lord like the prophet said when in that opening of that quote Lord because we don't we don't want to put you Lord in a place to where you've got to answer things the way that we think it's got to be Lord I know sometimes in our Humanity certain things every one of us Lord we've wanted certain things maybe to be a certain way sometimes it's because we looked at maybe it was more glorious that it would be this way it would bring more glory to God and yet father your Prophet would stand there in believing God I believe that was preached over in Pennsylvania here and he would stand there and tell us there's nothing even more greater than even if you were to heal us positive right now by a miracle there's nothing more greater than to be able to take your word and stand on that promise and say even now he is healing me oh God I believe that tonight that Lord that not only for the healing and the body but I believe God as your children that we can stand here tonight and say even now I a part of this Rapture I'm a part of Jesus Christ I I may not see everything yet but I I'm a part of it I'm a part of it I know where my heart is that I I know I I I see in my life I see his life coming out I I know his desires are moving through me I know what I was and I know what I am now I may not be what I want to be or what I should be but I know I'm not what I used to be so even now the Rapture is working in me oh God help us Lord I pray if there's one Lord that hasn't received Lord of that love of God Lord in their heart would you just Lord right now Lord Lord God just in the Simplicity of taking you at your word I hear how your Prophet would say it at the end of three kinds of Believers he said if you from the very bottom of your heart can mean it from the depths of your heart receive it right now Lord granted I pray granted Lord we want to stand like that Mama deer stood that one Bert's heart when Mama deer came out there and stood knowing that that Hunter was there knowing that the sights was on her she could smell him she knew it was there but the Instinct in her was drawn out when she heard that call of a baby deer of a fawn Lord God as your children in this hour father may we not look Lord for so much that it has to be walking on the water of
