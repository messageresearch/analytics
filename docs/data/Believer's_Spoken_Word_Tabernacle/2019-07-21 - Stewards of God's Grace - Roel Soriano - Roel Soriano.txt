words are not enough tell you I love listen to a heart and when words are not enough to tell you about love just listen [Applause] aren't you glad that's what he's really listening to is our hearts you know I I love that little the little story many times I live that where that little boy was praying in the cornfield you really didn't know what to say he didn't know the words to offer up and you know I he just started saying his ABCs and the man that was walking by said what are you doing he said well he says I'm I'm praying he said but all you were doing he said was just saying your ABCs he said yeah he said I I didn't know the words to say so but I figured he could put all the words together you know I thought one time I heard a minister say it like this you know it was a man that a brother who was actually a serving in that in the Moody Bible Institute and he went and I thought it was really remarkable he made a statement he said you know he said he said prayer meetings he said was one of those things he said sometimes he said you'd get people and they get around the altar he said and then they start doing but these and the vows he said instead of just talking to God like you talked to your friend amen God don't want these and vows and just talk to him you don't want words that we have to well I need to give good words no we just need to we just need to talk to him amen and then he's able to you know sometimes we don't know exactly what it is to pray or even within a situation how do I pray about this situation but you know I'm grateful that he's still the same God that directed the stone to glass forehead and he knows exactly how to direct what's on our hearts that it goes to the right place and I'm glad about that I've got confidence in that amen and so we just we thank God for His mercy amen this morning so glad to have brother o-l and sister Cindy here with us once again [Applause] and so I'm gonna ask brother Luiz if he will come just greet you brother Lewis and sister Christine sister Christine you just heard sing that's brother Royals first cousin and they're there from Lulu Georgia brother Louie's his and sister Christine their pastor brother Samuel Dale and that's where brother Rael and sister Cindy they'll be going back with them and brother Louie's I asked him if he would just come and just greet you all he's a minister in the gospel of Jesus Christ and preaching the word in this hour and so we we just saw want him to greet you he isn't native and where he is from is Columbia brother Louise come on brother and and and and greet and greet the people of God and how many just enjoyed the word of the Lord on Thursday amen we're just expecting more from the Lord here this morning I have a few announcements we'll make after brother Louie's after he greets you here god bless you all it's good to be here how many love the Lord this morning amen the mill attendee got a loss Carolyn espanol Kentucky's own hispanos mucho Espinosa key a lot of Hispanics and that's what I heard and I was asking brother Samuel last night you know the the the kind of the history the background of this area you know why there's so many Puerto Ricans in this area and stuff like that so it was interesting to me so I love the Hispanic culture because I am one and so once again my name is brother Lewis your ago we reside in in Georgia just about 35 minutes outside of Atlanta Atlanta and we bring greetings from brother Samuel Dale my pastor I've been ministering the gospel since 2009 Lord's been been using us by His grace in Nicaragua and Honduras and we've been also being able to minister in in the Philippines a few times mainly youth camps and and and so the Lord and I've also been in doing some interpretation work in different countries so we just want to put our hand you know our shoulder to the wheel wherever God wants to use us amen and so there's areas there in in Honduras and in Nicaragua that you know the brothers down there they say they say brother Luis you know you know you can come down here and preach in any established church you want to but what about those people like in remote areas that have not even heard the name of the Lord Jesus Christ yet and so that's what the Lord is has put on my heart to work with these young brothers young pastors that are down there in the 30s 40s some even in their late 20s and have been put in that position and have such a burden for the people and they go out ten hours away up in the mountains and just deal with Indian tribes up in those areas and so that's where we've been trying to work with the people there in those areas so we certainly covet your prayers and I certainly enjoyed last night just fellowshiping with brother Samuel and in his family sister Kim she cooked us a great meal and brother Samuel just cleaning some some great things from him as well his wisdom and and then you know just speaking about the word amen and in this it's time to leave Saints it's time to go home it's not time to get lakhs it's not time to get sad it's time to go home amen and when it's time to get home Amen why but when it's time to go home when you know you're gonna go home you're not feeling sad or depressed that's your home amen so if Heaven is your home you should be excited amen in this hour amen praise the Lord Jesus so god bless you we love you in the Lord the old mellow bendiga Kayano you stairs I don't know how much Spanish I was supposed to speak to them brother but no contrast cuantos ain't in English doesn't end in English

service and then brother Louise and sister Christine and the children they'll be there as well and brother Owen and sister Cindy so we certainly just invite each and every one of you I don't know if we have been in a heatwave I don't know if if we would have had that still some of y'all might have wanted to but I may have had to been inside brother Richards just looking through the window but I did I did enjoy the heat for a little bit you know in the past weeks and we certainly we certainly have enjoyed that and but it's also remember a prayer meeting as well this coming the Lord willing this coming Tuesday remember that in prayer and the prayer requests was given we've continued to remember Lilliana in prayer and I didn't get a chance I don't know if I'm made mention to you or not but last Friday had the opportunity to take brother cadre up there and we had the opportunity where the cadre had the opportunity to share his testimony as the Lord had led in regarding to God moving on his behalf and healing him of cancer and so he was able to give that testimony there and as well as to pray for for Lilliana so really and then the presence of the Lord was so so great there in the room and we just when we're praying we want to thank God for what he's done that's how we want to pray we want to thank God for what he's done amen so we're just we're looking a men for for God to to can do can do a complete work there amen for her just yet you know the other prayer request that was mentioned here this morning both of them I've heard that left sister of sister Connie Jenkins her brother Greg I'll have to get with you after service so I know exactly where she's at but even sister Michele Carper she they did some treatment yesterday they said it was a brown recluse that bit her so they asked you know she's they asked her to come back if she was still feeling pain she's been in pain but I believe that worse we are serving the omniscient God it men is omnipresent and he's omnipotent he meant so we just want to even while the words coming forth this morning let's really hold sister Michelle up in prayer that the age of the Lord will make a visit there and just touch her and amen just deliver her in her body of the of that affliction amen he's still God he's still the same Amen so we just appreciate each and every one of you different ones that were that we see here and we're just we want to just pull on the gift of God this morning god knows what we have need of and you know in our minds we're not we're not in our minds thinking of of a Jesus that walked the shores of ascended on hi he rose from the grave triumphed over all principalities and he ascended on high and he sent back the Holy Ghost and that same Holy Ghost is the same Lord God that lived in that body called Jesus that is the same Lord Jesus Christ now walking here the same yesterday today and forever and no matter what your are thought and sometimes our senses sometimes as we set in a service sometimes thoughts can come our situations a test or trial or something comes up oh I got to remember to do this or all I got to remember to do this but just remember is that many times there's things sometimes that can come to you like that and it's only to try to distract you and just say Lord I'm here I'm right here Lord Jesus I'm here and he's right here to move he's walking right right through this you say how do you know that because I brought him with me I brought him with me and he and he said in his word wherever two or three are gathered together in my name there am I also in the midst of them amen we are gathered according to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen this is his promise and we stand upon that and we believe that so if he's the same yesterday today and forever how many say he is then the presence of the Lord then he is here present to heal that which is sick he's here present to deliver that which is bound and he's here to feel and impart his life into those that need life and his life it goes so far beyond anything that we are a person can experience in this life he said I've come that you might have life and that you might have it more amen this is this is the promise of our Lord Jesus this is who's in our midst amen the very life giver himself if there's a promise that you feel like that somehow it seems like it's escaped you or or something and he's here to bring that alive to your life amen he's the life giver to the word Amen so let's just turn our hearts amen to the Word of God this morning as we invite brother Rowell and

Americans called the wives the better half so you've seen my better half now okay I'll let you be seated for just a little while and let me just share with you some of the works that we have been doing in the past years and some of these people better Sammo has met these are the new outreaches church outreaches that we're now working with I told you last Thursday about this one island and palawan or we work with 60 denominational churches out of the 60 24 has come to completely receive the message of the hour and I think that's so wonderful and last year of the Lord opened up more doors in the islands of Cebu Tamar and Mindanao in Mindanao I think it has been 12 years since I last visited the place we started a lot of work in Mindanao but because of my issue my health issue six years ago I just stopped going there you know stopped traveling because it's not easy to travel around the area of Mindanao right now there is martial law in pop imposed and on the whole island and it's kind of difficult to move from one place to another and it's a rough place you know it's a base for a lot of tribes people are still living in Mindanao but after 12 years I came back there and this who visit the brothers and sisters business visit their places were we started churches and I'm thankful to the Lord by His grace they are still continuing on with the with the word without faith the message of the hour and not only that but the churches are going out and winning more souls the Lord starting new churches and I can think of about 200 churches now that are connected to our church and for this I want to give God all the glory and honor I want to share some of this slides with you the new hog treats churches in the pilled Philippine missions here you see new church down in Palawan this is brother Rael our gone and we worked with him is actually tribe tribal leader and he goes where nobody else goes yes he led us to a place I think I mentioned it last Thursday were the only way you can get to the place is to walk for 13 hours there's no other means of transportation you have to track climb up the mountain and cross rivers in order to get to the place and the people are very primitive as you can see this this this brother is now a brother hard we have hardly has clothes on him but better rail led him to the Lord together with people in his tribes and now they started a church in this place and here you see brother al ministering to him and its people about the Word of God yeah this man belonged to the out but all tribe and here's never Church in Purina it's down in Castle Palau in the same Island you know the tribes people there is they're imposing a total log ban in our country but deprives people they are allowed to cut trees and get lumber from the forest they're the only ones that are allowed by our government to do it so this particular group of people here are tribes people and they're able to cut the lumber and all they were asking from us its money to buy nails nails and corrugate us maybe corrugated iron shits you know for the roof so that they can put a roof over the house at their building here's a sample of the framework that they're doing they're building their themselves and here's a typical church in Palawan Sand Mountain church in c-could Palawan you see the dirt floor and bamboo walls and windows you know they don't have glass windows you know it's so made of bamboos when the rain comes the rain comes into the church you know and the floor gets muddied but this is the typical Church who we work with I know at least nine churches that are built this way out in the mountains of Palawan amongst the tribes people here's another tribal church in Catalan you see it's that's typical the way the church is constructed and here's another one in she could belong and here's one in culligan Santo Nino and the church is under repair you see the pews that they're using it's actually fixed to the ground and the wall you know and no padding at all you know and you got comfortable pews but this is all they got counter side views it's a brand new church that we started in some ballast and we're helping them with cement and buy some sand but they they produce their own concrete concrete blocks these are first concrete blocks that are being fabricated and we help them with rebars steel bars and these are more blocks that they made and here's another typical church and this is down in Mindanao which we helped in the past and we had a service there and the Lord just visit us visited us he came down in a wonderful way this is a church in a beautiful island called Chagall there God has become famous now it's a resort island because people come from all over the world to go surfing on this island because the waves on this island that they say it's comparable to the ones in Hawaii so a lot of people they come to this island now Houston has a tribal church in cando Agra allowing see it's very typical bamboo sightings and we help them with concrete blocks as you can see the other the back wall is made up of concrete blocks in dirt floor but little by little they they're trying to improve the church building maybe put concrete on the dirt floor and put some windows and doors but that they just do the best that they can but they love the Lord you know and this is the church now that brother Sam helped me when they helped me with this church with this boat I should say it's a it's a big boss of 50 foot long both longer than this sanctuary here and they're now using it number one for livelihood you know so they can make some money because it's allowance a fishing community and it's an island made up of 300 little islands you know there are 300 little islands in the area surrounding the main island and there are people that live there and their brothers in Palau they tried their best to go to each eye it's of this island and being the Word of God to them though we called it the mission book how mission boug how is our word for blue now we have the blue mission before we started a green mission we call it the bloom TM mission when TM is a word for green it's the rubber plantation that we start that I think I told you about it and now the rubber trees are about this big we're old and in in another P years time we'll be able to harvest sap from them and be able to generate funds to support the mission work in the Philippines one rubber tree will produce $4 a month and we planted 5,000 rubber trees on this island and because of the extended rises and some of the robber trees died and got stunted but we still have at least 3000 rubber trees that are living and growing and so we just want to thank the Lord by the grace of God missionary work will be supported just from the rubber farm amen thank you so much thank you so much for supporting us thank you lord and now we go to the word I ask you to please stand with me I'm gonna talk about you as God's T words of grace we are stewards of God's grace the Bride of Christ is I'm gonna talk to you about the unlimited mercy of the infinite crystal there's a limited mercy limitless it's no way you can exhaust it is the kind of grace that our priest bestowed upon our lives hallelujah if you can read with me Jeremiah chapter 31 verse 31 to 34 the fonts are feels small I'm sorry about that but you can read it from your Bible it says here this is God's covenant to Israel behold the days come said the Lord and I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring bring them out of the land of Egypt which my covenant they break although I was a husband unto them see God was a husband and to them but they broke their covenant said the Lord verse 33 but this shall be the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days said the Lord I will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts and I will be their God and they shall be my people and they shall teach no more every man his neighbour and every man his brother saying know the Lord for they shall know they shall all know me from the least to them of them unto the greatest of them said the Lord for I will give I will forgive their iniquity and I will remember their sins no more I'll take you to another portion with scriptures in the book of Matthew chapter 18 verse 21 to 22 and then Peter came to him and said Lord how oft shall my brother sin against me and I forgave him till seven times we've read this last Thursday and Peter thought it was plenty seven seven seven times a day would be plenty but jesus said unto him I say unto thee until seven times I say not unto thee until seven times but until seventy times seven this reminds us of the Covenant of God with Israel who seventy weeks were given as a covenant of God to Israel and that is seventy times seven we're not we're not just talking about the numbers here you know but seven barbam success is a number of completion seventy times seven is complete forgiveness this is the number of grace hallelujah and in first Peter chapter four verse eight or our last reading just here and above all things have fervent charity amongst yourselves or charity covers shall cover the multitude of sins these are the words of God let's pray Heavenly Father we come humbly before your feet and once again asked that you come and quicken this words to our hearts and mind and let us fill your press and let us know that you are here that you are concerned about us and that you're still the same yesterday today and you'll never change forever Allah know your Stier you're still our healer you're still our the forgiver of sins o God you're still our son keep our Sanctifier and you are still able to baptize it's one of us with your Holy Spirit hallelujah father I ask that you meet every need of the Saints this morning and I asked that you give us a good time in the presence of the Lord and around your word give you the praise and honor and glory in the name of Jesus Christ we pray I'm in may be seated hallelujah I just love to talk about the grace of God I think it's so important that barber dedicated a whole sermon - grace because it the message of grace this is the message of the New Testament and st. Paul calls it a better testament you know better than the old and the louia because in the Old Testament God gave His Word and they expected the people to do their part of the Covenant and that this obey his word and Bertram says God is always faithful to do his part in in every covenant every time he makes a covenant with man God fulfills his part but man always fails fulfill his part and so there was a need to change it there was a need for God to make a new covenant and we just read it the Covenant the New Covenant of God with Israel and we understand that we are the spiritual Israel and we are now under the this new covenant where God said I will put I rewrite my words in their hearts Alleluia this now is the new covenant in case you still don't understand it to put it simply God says I will now pour my spirit so that my spirit will be living in you so that you will not obey my words by your own might or human capacity but it's my spirit the power of my Holy Spirit will abide in you so that my spirit will actually obey my own word because you fail I give you my spirit so that my spirit can obey my own word my spirit in you can obey my own word I don't have to trust in your humanity to do it because I've tried it and you fail miserably now I'm gonna put my spirit in you and my spirit will fulfill the word and in the end I give you the reward I think that's a better covenant and that's a covenant of grace hallelujah in the book of Matthew other Brenna must know Jesus was telling about this horrible of a king and one of his subjects owed him an immense debt let me just read it Matthew 18 verse 35 23 to 25 therefore is the kingdom of God of heaven likened unto a certain King which would take account of his servants and when he had begun to recon one was brought unto Him which owed him think no 10,000 talents No in case you don't know how much that cost we'll talk about it but for as much as he had not to pay it was such an immense debt that the Bible said he had not to pay there's no way you could pay the debt his LORD commanded him to be sold and his wife and his children and all that he had and payment to be made mine what a dilemma huh and I think about the ten thousand talents how much it would cost today one denarii is equivalent to one day's wage and one talent is about 6,000 denarii so one day's wage is one Denari so 10,000 times 6000 is about sixty million days sixty million days worth of labor that's how much this man owes his Lord hallelujah and I made some calculations and just say this man makes about a hundred dollars a day and this would mean he would have worked 166 thousand years of labor times $100 a day that 16 million dollars this man old his Lord I'm a for man to be making $100 a day in owing his employer 16 million dollars it's just unthinkable there's just no way this man will be able to pay this debt hallelujah and I think of our insurmountable sins sorry for the types very small our insurmountable sins against God think about it Romans chapter 3 verse 22 you're familiar with this verse for all have sinned I have includes you and me every preacher in this room every mother you know every young person in this congregation all have seen including better Branham all have sinned and come short of the glory of God think about it my mom says to sin is to miss the mark and my other definition for that is the sin is to fall short when you miss the mark you actually fall short alleluiah worry is falling short of faith is that true you fall short of faith when you worry and Fred you worry about the bills you worry about the trade wars taking place right now you worry about you know wars and rumors of wars you worry about the hurricane worry about a lot of things but see if you worry it shows that there is you fall short of faith and impatience is falling short of kindness you'll be and having a critical spirit is spawning short of love and being dilatory burbank also used to word dilatory i didn't know what the mean dilatory as laziness is falling short of zeal it's when you lose your zeal for doing things for serving the Lord your zeal to pray to help others to witness to people you fall short of that you become dilatory I'll do it being judgmental is falling short of grace failing to come to church is failing to give him praise and gratitude that he deserves we fall short we all for sure before the Bible says all have sinned and come short of the glory of God how often how often do you fall short have you ever thought would ten times an hour be a big number no it won't be let's just say 10 times an hour you fall short you commit a sin against God 10 times times an hour you multiply that with 16 waking hours 365 days in a year for average lifespan of 74 years you will have committed 4,300,000 sins in your own lifetime we ever thought of that it's insurmountable it's just incredible how much he falls short of the glory of God hallelujah Saint John chapter 1 verse 8 to 10 says if we say that we have no sin then we deceive ourselves you think you're in the message you don't commit sin anymore let me tell you you're deceiving yourself Alleluia if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us so the truth is not in us but if we confess our sins if we confess our sins and he is faithful and just to forgive us of all our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say we have not sinned then we make him a liar and God is not a liar he said the truth we all have come short of the glory of God we all have sinned hallelujah even after our conversion we still sin we still commit mistakes but when Cossack mistakes it's actually sinning when you fall short you're actually sitting hallelujah and you need to do and all you need to do is to be faithful be humble to admit that you are a sinner and that you commit sins every day Paul said I backslide every day hallelujah you see we only deceive ourselves if we if we think we're not sinning and we not only deceive ourselves but we are trying to deceive God we think we can deceive God the most powerful deception to me is self-deception but thank God for the power of the gospel you know brother Branham said this the Hebrew serious he said this I have no holiness to present to him let him said this he has no holiness and we think we're holy we tried to dress holy we tried to act holding and you know talk holy hallelujah but better one said I have no holiness to present to him but I am trusting in his Oh His grace and I have I have it in my heart I have unmerited it oh my goodness grace is unmerited favor hallelujah the way I explained it back back in the Philippines you know were simple minded people I say when you throw our rap on your neighbor's house and you broke the window of your neighbor and your neighbor comes to you with a plate with a tray of cake this gives you a cake you broke his window but it gives you a cake that's grace you don't merit it you deserve to be penalized you deserve to be taken to court and you know and pay for your tour the damage that you've cost colony but instead your neighbor bought you a tray of cake oh my that's unmerited favor hallelujah and we don't deserve anything good from God we don't deserve it Alleluia but God saved us anyway God died for us anyway he offered the supreme sacrifice so that we can all be redeemed and we can all enjoy eternal life hallelujah said I I have unmerited it I did not deserve it there is nothing I could do to deserve it but by grace he called me and invited me to come and I look to him and he took the desire away from me and bredrin said I make thousands of mistakes in each month mother Brennan was so humbled to admit that he makes thousands of mistake in age smart how many do you do you make but Ruben was honest in saying I make thousands of mistakes in each month it says in each year sure I do but here's the thing when I see I'm wrong I say god I didn't mean to do it you know my heart I didn't mean to do that I was just trapped into that and I didn't mean to do it forgive me Lord hallelujah amen I believe this should be our attitude we should be always be willing to admit Amen that we are frail people amen you know we're human beings made of flesh and blood and we fail it's time you know every day of our lives the RAM says thousands of sins every month every year hallelujah and ask for the Lord's forgiveness ask for grace we are serving a gracious God we are living under the New Testament not under rules don't do this don't do that this is what you do this is what you should do not this but they're not under rules aren't you thankful that God gave us grace if you are now living under the New Testament the law of grace the law of Christ which is grace hallelujah Romans chapter 3 verse 24 to 26 says being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus when God whom God had set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of God to declare I say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him which believe in Jesus oh my how many believes in Jesus I declare unto you he's just is his righteousness right now and that he's the justifier of everyone that believes in Jesus oh my hallelujah we talk of the steps of grace but a man calls it the three steps of grace justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost barbam says that makes the that makes up the new birth didn't say that well if you think about it these are steps of grace these are not your steps these are works of God in your life [Applause] how are you justified you're justified by faith faith is a revelation we talked about it last Thursday you cannot work your way into faith because faith it's a free gift faith is a gift of God and what did but one said faith is a revelation you know it's a powerful statement you know I talked to I talked to a lot of ministers theologians have been in Bible school for 10 years some are thirty years but when I say this profound statement faith is a revelation Alleluia they think it's so deep it's so profound Alleluia they never heard it in Bible School but the seventh-grade that said it faith is a revelation halibut and it's a free gift of God to you you did not merit it there's nothing you did to deserve it God gave it to you freely al aliy if your name's in the book hallelujah it's made available for you it's yours Alleluia and how are you sanctified we're sanctified by the blood of Jesus not by your own blood not by your own works is by the blood of Jesus hallelujah were sanctified by the word I shall listen to the word amen your life will become clean hallelujah Bertram says it this way you become the word as she received the word oh my thank God for Church here is where we receive the word by faith how do you receive it by faith and that's how your life is being sanctified hallelujah for some this happens immediately for some I know some Christians it's a total 100 degree change in lifestyle some somebody said 360 degrees now if you turn 360 degrees you're back to the same way it's a hundred eighty degrees Alleluia so everything about you change hallelujah any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new and how are you baptized with the Holy Ghost how are you sealed into the body of Christ again it's the work of the Holy Spirit it's not the work of the preacher no we fail if we think that because the ministry is strict the pastor preaches so hard and we're so strict in imposing church conduct order and doctrine imposing holiness upon the people that the people will become the church will become better it's not the work of any particular man three steps of grace remember that justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost God does all this hallelujah [Applause] I caught a part of this statements because I wanted to tell you how that better been him at one time wanted to he was he was condemning an old woman you know because he was carousing with two policemen you know in a bar I think it happened in Ohio somewhere in Ohio he said some Roadhouse a restaurant and he saw this this woman drinking wine with his two political policemen and he addressed he described it this way and then he said then he she had her painted her hair painted blue you think blue hair is new but this blue hair was careful but where was here said she painted her hair blue and I thought oh my look here look there and the two old drunk men sitting there in summertime one of them with a big cover o'the overcoat on and an old army overcoat and a rag wrap around his neck for a scarf and they were so drunk sitting there with his old lady and bertram said let me just get out of this dump he was he was condemning the lady and then God showed him the vision right you remember of the world turning and there was a rainbow about the globe and and that rainbow was actually the speaker blood which was the blood of Jesus that serves as a bumper of mine I thank God for that bumper our sins our sins cannot go through that bumper if you're a believer today our sins cannot go through that bumper hallelujah and Bertrand saw the face of Jesus and how that he was suffering every time he committed sin and he couldn't believe that he was doing it to Christ Christ was grimacing and it was in pain every time he committed something wrong hallelujah and better I'm said Emma am I doing that to you Lord not my scene hurting you and then he saw a book sitting there with his name William Brennan and all his sins listed below underneath his name all the sins that there's committed and Christ just took his finger to his side and with the blood that came out of it wrote on top of that book pardon Oh hallelujah [Music] God was saying to Bella banner here I have forgiven you I have pardoned you and you are condemning this woman to speak something to us it's because of God's grace that we received forgiveness that we have been accepted into the kingdom of God hallelujah but after we've been accepted into the kingdom of God and our lives have changed they have become righteous we have become holy hallelujah and then we start looking at other people who are sinning and we begin looking down on them no different from but better random did Alleluia but you see God wrote across your name pardon with his own blood he forgave you how dare you condemn others when Rama said I do not understand how a man can condemn a sinner a fellow sinner under the blood of Jesus Christ you can never condemn another person able to dispense this grace - I am known in my country to be a pastor that always wants to preach grace under well all the preaches about this grace they call me mr. grace the message of grace Birnbaum said this then why could anyone criticize and say that grace is wrong that we are saved by works no we are saved by grace that through faith not by works works show that you have been saved but what saves you is the grace of God grace saves you grace it was is what God does for you works it's what is what you do for God to show appreciation of what God did for you by grace you are saved hallelujah and here's a very balanced way of presenting it hallelujah I was talking about assemble and he agreed with me when I said I'm finding that a lot of message churches and message believers are come they lean towards more towards on Arminianism they want to work their way into heaven hallelujah to the point of rejecting the grace of God Alleluia I think of the people of Israel but Aram says it's grace that gave them a prophet grace gave them a message grace brought them a pillar of fire grace brought them to the promised land and they wanted law they wanted priests to tell them what to do hallelujah in effect when the when grace was made into flesh and Jesus came on the scene they ultimately rejected Jesus hallelujah they wanted law they wanted to stay in the Old Covenant and rejected Jesus Birnbaum says just like a marriage grace is it's like this Hebrews chapter 6 he said accepting meat abroad as my wife was what love done for her what she does in appreciation she's a nice woman she stays home and takes care of our children and lives leaves a good true life that's not because we're not married we are married but she does that in appreciation if she runs downtown every day and took in every 10-cent store and up and down the streets and never was a dishes or anything else we are still married think about it hallelujah what sister meter does or does not do does not have one thing to do with the fact that she's married to William Brennan because Hillenbrand already made the decision to accept her as his wife so Bertram said even if he runs down to town every day and took in every ten to ten cents store up and down the streets and never wash the dishes never cleaned a hole or anything else we are still married absolutely when I took my bow that settles it she's my wife as long as there is life in us she is my wife that's her bow but what appreciation she does for that she stays home and takes care of the children and tries to be a real wife when God accepted the cry the sacrifice surprised he accepted Christ that's why he went into a heaven right after he died and rose again the story did not stop there he was it went him to heaven that means God the Father accepted the sacrifice but did you know that when God accepted Christ he has accepted you with it he did not look at your weakness he did not look at all the sins that you've committed he look at the holiness of Christ he meant that holy blood saved you and when when he accepted the sacrifice he accepted you that's why the Bible taught you the accepted in the beloved you're only accepted in the beloved that's Christ our beloved hallelujah amen not because of any any good thing any good work that you did he already made a decision before the foundation of the world to marry you hallelujah and he wrote down your name in his book and it put a period to it nothing can change it bambam said he took a picture of you of his beautiful wife and in that picture you were not smoking your when you are not wearing a miniskirt amen you are not wasting your time on Facebook in that picture hallelujah you were as perfect as Christ was hallelujah whoo you know what that picture is Alleluia that's your theophany perfect picture Alleluia after you leave this this body here you go back to your theophany hallelujah I'm not worried about this earthly body you know my doctor keeps on scaring me said you're like you're like you're like a walking time bomb because three of your arteries are blocked arteries of my heart they're block 80% and to two other arteries are a partially blocked you need to have a bypass he told me this six years ago who said it can happen any minute you know you're like a ticking time bomb Alleluia oh praise God it's almost seven years now and I'm still alive and kicking and pitching the world [Applause] but I accept this body is coming down one of these days we're gonna leave this body amen I don't care so much about this body Alleluia I'm looking forward to having a new body I'm turning 16 October becoming a senior citizen you know in the Philippines we get a 20% discount on everything and then looking forward to it but I look forward to my new body more hallelu it's the perfect picture of me amen we're all going back to that you see when God gave you grace you have to accept it oh my you have to hurry her bomb said when Jesus died he cleanse all the world of sin but you have to accept it his Amen you have to accept grace don't be like the Israelites they wanted the law you have to accept your pardoning or God would destroy the world the very first thing that that was committed would rock her off her place the world because he is holy his words are right and we are stewards of God's grace first Peter chapter 4 verse 10 every man had received the gift even to minister the same as every man had received a gift I'm sorry even so Minister the same one to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God scriptures saying as she received grace you should be able to distribute grace a she received grace should be able to give them away give it away James chapter 4 verse 6 but he giveth more grace how much grace more grace the grace of God is unlimited you think you think you've had enough grace but he giveth more grace oh my you think you've done enough wrong you had an out short shot coming in your life hallelujah but he giveth more grace he giveth more grace wherefore he said God resisteth the proud but giveth grace unto the humble arrogant people self-righteous people they cannot handle great but God gives grace only to the humble the Pharisees thought they had it all they couldn't take it hallelujah they couldn't take the the grace of God that was being manifested in Christ in their day Alleluia you see we have a big responsibility like I told you last Thursday you have a big responsibility we are our brother's keeper can you say together brother's keeper you are our brother's keeper second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 8 verse verse 18 and 19 says here all things are of God who had reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and we say Amen to this right and has given to us given to who given to us what the Ministry of reconciliation do you get it Alleluia he has given to us the same ministry that he performed here on earth to reconcile people unto God we can sell sinners and to a holy God that's what he did and the same ministry he has given to us Jesus is not here anymore but the bride is here to continue his word he has given to us the Ministry of reconciliation to wit that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses on them that had committed unto us committed and to who and to us the word of reconciliation this word that people see message of the hour is the word of reconciliation Alleluia this is what will bring sinners back in the relationship to a holy God amen hallelujah it's your responsibility this is our ministry this is the ministry of the bride today Ministry of reconciliation Alleluia not the Ministry of conflict not a Ministry of controversy I don't blame blame people for calling the message the message but they don't realize we have been given this responsibility of reconciling the world unto God God was in Christ now Christ is in us reconciling the world unto himself everything that's what he's got in God he poured into Christ and everything that was in Christ is now poured into the bride of Jesus Christ and now we have to do the work of reconciliation hallelujah Luke chapter 7 verse 47 jesus said but wherefore I say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved mots but to whom little is forgiven I'm the same loving little just say this to Simon the Pharisee who thought he was so sure he was so righteous in the sight of God no he was righteous in his own sight hallelujah and the Lord told him a parable about two people owing somebody a great debt or some debt one owed him fifty and the other owed him five hundred pence and having nothing to be able to pay back the debt and then the the benefactor actually forgave them both and the Lord asked the question who do you think we love the the the one that that forgave them more though the Lord said Simon answered the right question and said you said it right before I sent to you her sins the sin of this woman that was kissing her his feet and Simon was condemning him in his heart because he was an ill-favored woman and and he was having a ministers meeting right in his house and this woman came man is known to be a prostitute and he was kissing the feet of the Lord Jesus hallelujah and he was thinking not in my house I'll endure but the Lord said the woman is kissing my feet because he loves you more than you do because her since were married the more sins were forgiven the more scenes that are forgiven the more you love the Lord I thank God that he meant people gave all my seeds I love you hallelujah the one that's forgiven the most number of seeds will love the Lord most demos hallelujah see rejecters of grace are not able to give grace you see them alone around the message movement today around the message churches people find it hard to forgive find it hard to tolerate others that are not as holy and as righteous as themselves you know why because they have not received the grace they did not understand they did not have a revelation of what grace was all about we are in the bride because of the grace of God we are saved we are enjoying eternal life because of the grace of God hallelujah because we are all under the blood the shed blood of the Lamb how can look at other people who are not doing as good as we are and condemned him hallelujah knowing that we were just saved by grace hallelujah but the grace given give grace the grace given give grace hallelujah amen hallelujah forgiving people know how to forgive others people who are married to marinated in mercy dip mercy commit yourself to God because Jesus was this was what Jesus did first Peter chapter 2 verse 23 who when he was reviled he reviled them not again when he suffered he threatened not but committed himself to him that Rodger judgeth righteously in two months I'll Ram said they have been just gonna read this huh too good to get through with this I just have a few more slides remaining said reverence we ought to honor one another respect one another as brother and sister and love one another with undying love oh my oh my what the standing and dying love you say well I just can't well just stay there a little longer and then you will like people too you will love those who doesn't love you Alleluia that's really good sign of Christianity when you can from your heart love those who does not love you love the unlovable oh god this is the true seal of Christianity true sign of eternal life you got eternal life if you have undying love for people who don't love you it's easy to love people that love you but those who don't love you they hate you with a passion they curse your name they speak evil of you hallelujah you can love them with undying love is it possible you say it's hard it's difficult no it's not difficult it's impossible you don't have the Spirit of God in you you cannot do it hallelujah but look at the humility of the prophet of God you're spraying heavily father i bow down upon this altar and ask forgiveness of my sin if a prophet of God can do this we sure can do this I asked forgiveness of my sin I asked forgiveness of the sins of those who are around the altar since of our church fellow church mates I asked forgiveness for this church for the body of believers nationally I see Christ praying in better Branham this is Christ in better Brandis not bad man it's Christ in better belly asking for forgiveness not only for himself but for others for a whole nation not only for the whole nation and he said internationally no better but it sounds old me so this this kind of problem happens in the Philippines likewise it also happens in the Philippines I told burns ammo for example burn ban calls the church a universal Church so universal Church have universal problems we got the same problems you have here they were Universal but Barrera asked for forgiveness of the national sins and also the international since I asked for mercy for us being dilatory concerning the things of the kingdom I ask that you will pardon us of our sins and take our take away our transgression and forgive us for being so stupid and we think if we're so smart environment said forgive us not for being so stupid or the stupidity of the people or how we come short bamm-bamm says how we have taken bodily exercise we have done things that we ought not to have done how we have sinned before you and now I'm looking for you to come Lord and I want to have the same kind of spirit in me that you had in you it's this your desire the same kind of spirit that was in Jesus I want it to be in me I want that kind of a spirit that if my enemy spit could be hanging from my face and with all my heart I could say I forgive you for it and I could forgive others as Christ as God for Christ's sake forgave us on that while the spit of your enemy is still hanging on your face you are already willing to forgive that person how many times have you heard say Oh give it time I just can't do it now but you have to talk to him brother he's your brother he's your sister not now I'm still hurting or somebody say you know when you're hurt it creates a scar sometimes it takes time for the scar to be healed but better Bram said when your enemy spits on your face and the spit is still hanging on your face you should be able to be willing to forgive already that person Oh may God give us up this spirit the spirit of grace hallelujah and then let me just coat this again he said other from the depths of my heart I forgive my enemy Oh God oh I could go through them lovely in my heart and wash their feet do anything that I could so they don't miss that glorious sweet by-and-by the Reverend was willing to wash their feet when it says God teach me to forgive my enemy it was the thinking of Communists is that keep thinking of criminals is that thinking of persecutors it's thinking about people in the church people in the church sometimes we perceived them as enemies just because they're not like us hallelujah Oh Bertram said teach me to love my enemy and to be able to wash their feet what for not for my own sake not so not so that I make make make it to the rapture Lord I'm willing to do that humble myself watch my enemies feet so that I may get to the rub you know that's not his reason it's both he but must so that they don't miss that glorious sweet by-and-by so that for me I'm doing this for them Lord oh my god help us hallelujah you know better bottom call rap cheering grace we always say rupturing faith right but Bertram calls it many times wrap cheering grace you look in the message it's because it's rupturing grace because even rapture comes to you by the grace of God it happens by the grace of God rapture is a revelation but man says you can't even understand it you can even comprehend it hallelujah unless God reveals it to you but one said and that's the way a Christian is we planted together in Christ Jesus who is the inexhaustible fountain of life we are planted in Christ we just drain and drain and drain and push out and everything we have need all for this earthly journey divine healing the power of God and all these other things in every individual that's in here that's received by the bap the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost for Europe you are planted in Christ if you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are already planted in Christ and what do you need to do just drink and drink and drink and drink some more hallelujah what does it do it pushes out what you have drunk drink from the grace of God drink from the word I will drink of the Spirit of God and it pushes out in your life you start manifesting in your life hallelujah he men and Bible said the Holy Ghost baptism yes sir and everything you need off in this life's journey even the rapture is in you then oh my oh everything that you need in this life's journey even what even the rapture is in you then if you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost oh my it's like that Keiichi go over bottom or she own the cage eagle and as I laid there he said in his great eyes looking towards heaven the blue skies above him is a heavenly bird he lives in the heavens he was born to live in the heavens that's his nature to live on high and here is be the case over him and he can't get up anymore I thought that was one of the saddest sights I've ever near Lee seen and walking away from there the Holy Spirit seemed to say to me that afternoon setting in the park where I was I couldn't get it off my mind and I wanted to buy the bird but they wouldn't let me have him it was a sad sight and then Birnbaum said this and I felt sorry for him but when the Lord spoke to me in this matter here's the worst sight than that there's men and women walking the streets that was born to be sons and daughters of God living below their privilege beating their brains out in nightclubs and everything else when they should be soaring the skies of God's great to great pleasure and power oh you are Eagles but you are limiting yourself with the things of the world with expectations of people around you you are living below your god-given privileges privileges because you are sons and daughters of God you ought to be sorry the skies and not leading on this earth and limiting yourself to the things of the world like John god John was asked come up here don't stay there John there's nothing good where you're staying there's scorpions and it's too dry there that's just rocks and prisoners and all evil things taking place down there you don't have to stay there come up here I don't care what situation you're in now you don't have to stay there come up here they're your sons and daughters of God Alleluia now we know we are living in the most in the darkest of all the ages and about two years ago we read of this incident in Nevada there was a shooting a man just started shooting the people that they were attending some kind of a concert or something and a man just started shooting them with automatic gun shots and several people were died and I read about it this the shooter Steven pada it was the Nevada shooter he he was amassing well it was wallowing in pleasure and was seen with prostitutes before the shooting they before the shooting he was living life for himself Bertrand said when when you wonder why we got juvenile delinquency stopping people to death on the street and we become neurotic cases because we have left our God and we've accepted Creed's in our church instead of the Holy Spirit they god help us not to reject grace and received instead of the grace of God except churchianity her mom said Alleluia denominationalism is churchianity explaing and chapter Jannetty it's centered on the church in the system and the problem we don't want churchianity we want true christianity which is christ centered hallelujah you see the more sin abounds more grace about Romans chapter 5 verse 20 and 21 moreover the law entered that the offence might abound but where sin abounded grace did much more abound I say amen to that verse there's there's so much scene grace abounds so much more amen sin the sin of the world cannot be any greater than the grace of God there's no scene I don't care how it what kind of scene it is there's no scene that cannot be covered by the grace of God hallelujah [Applause] that a scene reigned unto death even so my grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus our Lord hallelujah we know this world is coming to an end this world is afraid it's like a brother said like a boy walking through the cemetery trying to whistle they're afraid the whole world is afraid the world seems to be in that same condition know that something is lingering near something is fixing to happen so every time an earthquake shocks California you know people are afraid you know something is about to happen the big one is about to hit California everybody knows yet every scientist knows it people of the world knows it hallelujah they know it's lingering near it builds up to a pressure of course to the sinner but to the Christian who is instructed in the Word of God ought to know that the coming that that's the coming of the Lord sinners should be afraid but the Christians who have been instructed in the word we ought to know that's that's just the coming of the Lord amen [Music] I ought to build up a glorious Jubilee in the Christian knowing that the end is nigh it's not a dead fall theme oh it's the end time wars tsunamis are coming volcanoes are gonna be erupting earthquakes in diverse places people are scared to death but we should not be scared we should not be afraid it should build up a glorious Jubilee in a Christian in other words we should be rejoicing that these things are taking place but we said look out because your redemption is drawing nigh this is what we live for someone said not too long ago to me said brother branham you scared the people when you talked about he might come the next hour I tell my people before the service is over the Lord might just come before the services even over and and people say you're scaring the people that way you scare the people when you talk about he might come in the next hour I said scare the people not these people see that's the greatest note that we can sound that's what we're looking for behold the bridegroom coming why that's what we live for that's the hour that we are all living for I know nothing could be greater than that hour but to the sinner of course it's a terrible thing aren't you glad you're a believer hallelujah they call me mister grace that's all right Paul is known to be the apostle of grace he said this but by the grace of God I am what I am and His grace which has bestowed upon he has bestowed upon me was not in vain but I laboured more abundantly than they all yet not i but the grace of God which was within me all that they ever did for God all that you ever do for God and will desire to do for God hallelujah we can only do it by the grace of God it's not astrally doing it hallelujah Paul said it it's not i but the grace of God which was with me therefore whether it were I or they we preach and so he believed hallelujah now you just go through this second Corinthians chapter 8 verse 1 to 5 this is the the grace of God that was bestowed upon the Macedonians I can say this is the same grace that was bestowed upon the people of Sheffield moreover brethren we do you wit you to wit of the grace of God bestowed upon the churches of Macedonia how that in a great trial of affliction abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality or to their power I bear record J beyond their power they were willing of themselves praying us with must entreaty that we should receive the gift and take upon us the Fellowship of the ministering of to the Saints they were giving Paul a certain amount of money that he collected amongst the Saints in Macedonia and they were pleading please receive it hallelujah and Paul said we received it because they were praying with us we mustn't wheaty that they would receive the gap that we would receive the gift and take upon us the Fellowship of the ministering of the saints oh my this is a wonderful fellowship hallelujah an exclusive fellowship not everyone is able to do it but if you're able to give to the cost towards of course then you are part of this circle of fellowship what kind of fellowship the fellowship of ministering to the Saints oh my and this they did not as they hope but first they gave their own selves to the Lord you can never do this you can never give towards the cost surprise if you don't give you first give yourself to God first give yourself to the Lord and then you can give to the cause hallelujah and unto us by the will of God we then as workers together with him beseech you also that you received not the grace of God in vain this is my appeal to you this morning are you beneficiaries of God's grace and I urge you don't receive it in vain if you receive it give it away God has been gracious to you be gracious to other people hallelujah for said I have heard thee in a time accepted in the day of salvation I have a sucker D behold now is the accepted time you know now is the day of salvation so we're leaving I wrote ironic lives second Corinthians chapter 6 verse 3 to 8 to 10 giving no offence in anything that the ministry be not blamed but in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God in much patience in afflictions in necessities in distress in stripes and imprisonments in tumults in Labor's in watchings and in fastings by pureness by knowledge by long-suffering by kindness by the Holy Ghost by love unfeigned by the word of the truth word of truth by the power of God by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left by honor and dishonor by evil report and good report as deceivers and yet true as unknown and yet well known as dying and behold we live as chastened and not killed as sorrowful yet always rejoicing as the poor as poor yet making many rich as having nothing yet processing all things you have Christ in your life you possess all things but it's so sad that people will miss him a warning when mom says quoting the scriptures let him that is filty be filthy still let him that is righteous be righteous still that team that is holy be holy still hallelujah the thing is closed oh brother and then what he said this in the breach when mercy will be over grace will be over but soon you know after both than the kinsmen work then he come and claimed his possessed possession and that's exactly what the Bible said it on become he come forth and took the book and then the intercession is over he is off the throne and there is no more blood on the mercy seat and preachers in the message coat this statements a lot and it brings fear into the hearts of the people because in our country there's a teaching that goes around that after the seals were opened the blog has went off the mercy seat and there's no more mercy grace is over hallelujah and Bernie Bernbaum said don't let me be said don't let it be said some of these days I thought the rapture was supposed to come and hear the voice say back in the past god help you God and here the boys say back it's in the past I thought the rapture was gonna take place but in the it's in the past it happened already you didn't know it they said there's no more intercession I don't believe that hallelujah now listen to this quotation and I'll end with this now in the day of mercy now it's the day of mercy well now it's the day of mercy now let's go back in the Old Testament they're here just a little bit and find out what mercy is going back and see what happened to this role this role of course is the judgment see he the reason today that we were there is mercy it's because the mercy seat is sprinkled with atonement the blood and as long as blood is on the judgment seat then it is not judgment no more it is mercy because something died to stay judgment if you see it's amen as long as blood is on the mercy seat it shows that something died to hold judgment back but when the church is raptured are you're listening when the church is raptured then the mercy seat becomes a judgment see I think this there's no need for clarification here hallelujah you see this is the timeline the beginning and the ending and the prophet of God was taken into eternity the divine rearm so that he's able to see the beginning and the end well he speaks about the beginning except it's in the present he speaks about what's happening in the present as in in presence everything is present as when you're in eternity everything is in present tense that's why God said I am that I am you never said I had been he never said I will be but I am that I am because he's not limited by time he is a God of eternity that's why I'm preaching about our eternal priesthood amen so the prophet of God is here and it's just a big beginning to the end and it's it's the end when mercy is over and is telling the people as if it's in the present tense this is how the people were confused hallelujah he says he says Christ getting off the mercy seat hallelujah and the blood is off the mercy seat and that's when the a filthy will become filthy still and the holy people will become holy or still mercy will be over but what happened he was taken to the eternal realm's and people in the timeline hallelujah they don't understand that they don't get it hallelujah they say mercy there were how can we be over how can you limit the grace of God do you realize that when the seats were open heaven was actually open to us and Bellavance says heaven consists of the word heaven is filled with the word so when heaven was opened when the seals were opened I believe there's more grace for the bride more grace for the people hallelujah God has not stopped interceding for us hallelujah that's fine second Peter chapter 3 verse 21 chapter 3 verse 18 it says but we need to grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus a view Jesus Christ to him be glory both now and forever hallelujah we love the message but we need to grow in grace hallelujah we need to grow in the knowledge about the message knowledge about the Godhead baptism the seals and theophanies and all these wonderful things the mysteries have been brought to us we need those but first we need to grow in grace hallelujah two more slides we're over there's more of God to be had to be had you believe that you might think I've had enough of God but there's more of God to be had and you need to crave it there's more of God to be had and father so many things could be said right here maybe the church wouldn't understand but I pray that you will give them such a crave for it see that's the key you need to crave for it pay for what more of God you are blessed with God's mercy and grace in the past but there's more mercy for you he giveth more grace but in order to receive it you have to crave for it hallelujah Lord that they will come and see you we're at the end time the astronaut age I pray father that they will realize it is that isn't trying it isn't trying to condemn what they had it's only trying to give them more rapturing grace Mary BAM calls it rupturing what grace rapturing base for the hour will come when we'll have to have a rupture power rapture power oh I like that term rapture power I will do here doctor power everybody say that means rapture power oh my goodness hallelujah the hour will come well we'll have to have rapture power not only to heal the body but to change it in a moment in a twinkling of an eye Christ will be so real to their bodies until that he can change it by his great death and what he has purchased don't let anybody tell you intercession is over because my Bible says it's not over Hebrews chapter 7 verse 25 says wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost even the mountains of the Philippines the remotest islands in the Philippines God is able to save them to the uttermost hallelujah that come unto God by him it's still happening God is still in the saving business I'm telling you God is still in the healing business if you're sick today God still can heal you hallelujah why because said the Bible said see he ever liveth to make intercession for them hallelujah how long does he live ever liveth for all eternity he lives while he is living he will not cease to intercede for you and me how can mercy be over hallelujah when we are here because of grace we don't deserve it you know what we deserve you deserve to go to hell but God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth on him shall not perish but will have eternal life your soul sing so sing that's awesome hear the Lord praise hallelujah praise bass go thank you amen I think we can see marvelous grace my father's grace they're singing in church we sing it a lot marvelous grace hallelujah praise Jesus may God bless you if there's any need this morning you won't have to make an altar call it's taken care of it's already done and God's grace and mercy so ready yeah marvelous grace we see

there he's already [Music] and how many want to show your appreciation to the Lord [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] look at the Lord Jesus here was a woman the Pharisees they brought her to Jesus they wanted her to be helped so much that they brought her to Jesus they said Lord Jesus this woman was she needs help in her life betting what they did they brought her to Jesus to condemn her are you with me and here the mercy of God the one that David song and then the one that Ezekiel saw the same mercy of God that supplied the angel with the softest hands when Elijah was in the midst of his depression the same mercy of God didn't even look up just rode in the sand now I want you to watch this did not even look up he just said whichever one of you are without sin let him cast the first stone I'd say you heard thudd thudd thudd maybe she was standing there and wondering winner of the thuds gonna cease when's the last thud but you see there's not one of those stones could be thrown and come against her because the Lamb of God in the mind of God had already paid the price in the mind of God there was nothing that could stop and hinder the grace of God from reaching her life I don't care how many stones or things that the enemy tried to bring at her life to try to hang over her there's nothing that could stop the grace of God from reaching her but then came the words out of there Jesus said a woman where are your accusers you see the Bible tells us while he was here walking in flesh he bore our sicknesses while he was here not even yet on Calvary he was announcing even there this is what the blood will do it removes all accusations the enemy might be able to say well you made a mistake even this morning on the way to church but you see God looking through the blood he can see what the desire is in our heart you see he paid the price that the desire within us might become alive that's what he did when Rahab stepped out of Jericho now you know she was not gonna be able to get married to Salman because if she still had you know living husbands but here's the grace of God she comes out and here's the ceremony taking place she's got to remain outside of the camp but she's brought in to the camp by Simone she's brought in to Covenant by Simone she's brought in to Israel we have been brought in to the Covenant by Jesus Christ Boaz brought Ruth in Jesus Christ brought us in and as they're standing is there anyone you know how the marriage ceremony go is there anyone would see just cause why these two shall not be joined together in holy matrimony let him speak now or forever hold their peace and they looked around in Revelations 5 and there was no accuser there was no accusation because you know why there was no one left to say she can't be are you with me all of the accusations of Jericho where she was living it ceased under the judgment of God and when the blood of Jesus Christ was shed sin was annihilated under the blood of Jesus Christ righteous judgment of all-mighty God you say what are you saying brother son I'm saying don't live in Jericho no more receive the grace of God walk out of there and be united with Simone let us show our appreciation as he told the woman where are thy neck users you see he wanted her to look around he could have told her hey hey hey hey look you don't have no more users no he wanted her to see where are you dine accusers she no doubt she's trying to lift her head she looks no feet now her eyes maybe start coming up or no legs there's none Lord he said neither do I can give a go and sin no more what grace is this what love is this you see what that does what God spoke to us this morning when we can receive it you say over the same if I can just know it's just received it with the gift of God it's a grace it's a gift you can't merit it you can't earn it you can't be good enough but what do I do just accept it a pardon itself is not a pardon unless it's accepted as a pardon and when you accept it as a pardon you are identifiying I am guilty but there is a righteous one I was under the condemnation of the fall but there's another man that came the man Christ Jesus and I'm under the righteousness of God of that purchase you can you see what that does it can allow you this morning if you just just allow the work of grace not not your work well I'm gonna go out of here and I'm gonna no just be appreciative of it and say Lord but you spoke through your servant this morning transform me I'm sure when brother Bannerman sister methi got married but there's a lot of times that maybe she burnt biscuits maybe she didn't know how to make mashed potatoes just right or you know you know you can go into your own foods you say what does that have to do with everything because she didn't know exactly maybe how to do everything just right but you know what she was showing her appreciation for the grace of God when it came time for dinner time there was meals on the table or this and that all of those things but after some time I could probably tell you that she probably came to a time where the mashed potatoes were palatable and then they kept getting better the biscuits you understand what I'm saying it's God's grace let God who began to work in you let him finish it so what do I do stay on the Potters will and he that has his hands on your life and on my life by divine grace just stay there and let him make out of your life out of our life what he already sees lord I appreciate your grace I want to walk in that grace amen it was said very simply but with much authority you don't have to leave out of here the same way you walked in and I'll say it just like this you don't have to have it was said you don't have to have hands laid on you we're here to pray with you but I want you understand he's already done it because even if you come here and we lay hands on you it's not our hands that'll do it what is it faith when you can just accept it there's one who came and stood for me let me just tell you he didn't just stand for the healing of your soul you're dealing with things today anxiety depression and and all the low things are one where he also paid the price for your spirit for your mind he paid the price for the healing of your body because the healing of your body is the earnest the earnest it's a witness there's going to be a rapture a body change [Music] all through this building we could raise our hands about times we feel gloomy we feel dying down and then there's times my goodness we feel like we're on top of the mountain you know what it is there's a witness there's a witness there that there is a body he spoke about it a theophany body amen where there is no clue no gloom but while walking through the midst of this time gloom can come but when there's joy you see we say what joy grace that has been ministered to our hearts today when you see this this creates what we were looking at last Sunday and atmosphere you know many of you know this you you can look at you have an employer and they say we're gonna train you on the job but they let you know listen you make a mistake here you're gonna cost me a lot of money you're gonna do this you're gonna do that how do you feel you feel like oh I mean you're already a bundle of nerves then you add that on top of it it's already do you see what the Holy Spirit he came this morning to tell us this it in the first service this it in the first service that he came and spoke these things you know what he's doing he's creating that atmosphere we're not living by fear were to live by the love of God the grace of God does the salmon what are you saying I'm saying my pencils got an eraser on it that's what I'm saying are you with me and I'm also saying that I because sometimes that eraser wears out so I have one of them big pink erasers that's the brand on it called pink eraser I got one of those too oh my there must be a lot of people around you or failures no that's just for me but we want to be dispensers of that be channels of that you see even right here of what God's done for you listen to me carefully I'm not I don't want to take your time but I'm trying just to just drop these things and even when you go out of here this morning you testify of what God has done for you don't you allow the enemy to put something back nor you testify of what God's done for you he's healed me he's delivered me he set me free I've received that grace you say what do you say I put it all in a nutshell I'm a Christian you let that be your testimony the Bible says he's the high priest of our profession which is confession what we say that he is not I'm going to be no he's not going to be he is so he is we are I'm a Christian and you watch as you're speaking that word in the confession of the grace of God that you've received in your life and you watch your life your life begins to transform around that confession what is that that's God as you confess what he is it works in your life it works righteousness it works holiness in our life don't you love him this morning the grace of God where could we do without God's grace amen you love him lord help me to let it become more real in me I don't want to just a one and we're a Manning this service we're saying so be it I am NOT saying Amen because I know that quote I know that scripture I know that's now I'm saying Amen I'm saying Amen so being Lord let it move deeper in my life because you know as it moves deeper in me guess who's there's less of less of Samuel less of Samuel there's less of Joey there's less of Matthew Michael less of Aaron there's less of Rey there's less of Richard less of Tony there's less and more of him that's what we want amen so be it Lord in my life a man he's the high priest of our confession when you're on your job and you feel like in a low time sometimes you can go right out of this building and tomorrow you might feel a weight but remember though you leave this atmosphere here he didn't leave you he did not leave you he did not leave you so matter of fact he's always been with you he lets you know I've always watched over your life that's why when you should have lost your life years ago I was there I was there that's the grace of God we didn't know it we didn't deserve it but God's grace he said nothing's going to stop my grace from reaching my children God's still saving he's still filling with the Holy Ghost still healing Mercy is still present amen there's blood on the mercy seat the Lamb of God is still seated on the throne of God he's still wearing the priestly garment amen of his blood hallelujah he's still wearing that and we know him as the Lamb of God the Lamb that does what taketh away the sin of the world one of these morning's you'll change the garment from lamb to lion when he that transition comes our garment will change to our bodies will be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye but in me wonderful John Lily they said a lion had prevailed he looked to see a lamb I see y'all later but it's the authority of the lion speaking through the lamb neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more god and simplicity oh don't you love him this morning don't you love him Lord Jesus Oh amen let's just bow our heads amen let let every bit of the word sink into our hearts take it take it let's take it this morning say Lord let me just live in appreciation for it amen Lord Jesus once again father we're standing like not the nine lepers but we're standing like that one who in the midst of his joy in the midst of his delight that where he was once a leper he had been made holy he paused and he he came back and said thank you for healing me thank you for touching me Lord we say thank you this morning [Music] and Lord as we each and every one is when we leave this place this building Oh God let us just Lord live in that appreciation Lord perhaps here this morning every one of us Lord may be newer ones but every one of us may we even Lord from our hearts just say Lord show me Lord what pleases you what what pleases you Lloyd show me Lord teach me Lord in the showing of the appreciation of grace Lord work in my life Lord work in my life deepen the word of your grace in my life you say lord help me to yield me Lord not to try to build everything in my mind and try to put everything together but help me just to rest in your grace Lord and allow you to do what only you can do our lives Lord they're not the work of man no no no no no no nor man's work will explore will reflect man's grace but that that kind of grace Lord it it's not it's not a grace that releases but all God to reflect the grace of God the pardoning grace of God it generates purity it generates holiness the grace of God is that with power and authority to release sons and daughters of God to allow sons and daughters of God to grow into the perfect stature of a perfect man Oh Lord Jesus Lord throughout this building this morning Lord you have spoke to every heart we thank you Lord Jesus Lord we ask that you would just go with us as we would go Lord our separate ways from one another's presence but never out of your presence Lord if there be one that they fill alone may they just realize may they just say Lord you said through one of your servants that you're with me would you just Lord God prove yourself right now to me you might be setting in your living room tomorrow and you just you do that you know what you do you invite him you're just inviting him and he'll just he loves to make himself known personally to you that's grace that's grace Lord Jesus oh Jesus may we invite you order not on the job when things or would get difficult in the hole Lord and places Lord may we invite you say Lord you said Lord in your word you'd never leave me nor forsake me Lord God will you just Lord move right now on my behalf I'll reach up and invite the god of the word to perform his word that's reaching out for that grace that's reaching out for that grace brannad Lord we pray father we're giving you things not just for what you have brought to us this morning the work that you have wrought in our lives but we're giving you things for the testimony that is coming out of this service this morning Lord victory Lord God Oh father where self is laid down Lord self works are laid down where our own righteousness is laid down Oh God what victory this morning Lord there's victory in Jesus we love your father we appreciate you and Lord God it might be said in a simple maybe seemingly carnal way but maybe we've burnt the biscuits and they're getting better and better maybe they're not dark all the way around maybe it's just on the edges but your grace you'll help us to where eventually
