[26:10] so good to be back home it's good to be
[26:13] back together again I want to say just
[26:16] from sister Kim and myself we certainly
[26:20] appreciated the prayers we were there we
[26:24] had three services that were there Ian
[26:28] and one that was just primarily focused
[26:31] to the men and with brother Eugene and
[26:35] the congregation there in Edmonton and
[26:39] the Lord was just so so good to us and I
[26:43] just so appreciate how the Lord just
[26:45] brought such a continuity you know
[26:50] within the services and just spoke to
[26:51] our hearts and and made a good way back
[26:56] home for us I really appreciate that I
[27:00] covered your prayers tonight I'm not
[27:02] really feeling all that well myself just
[27:06] you know it's something you know how it
[27:07] is you travel you get a little bit of a
[27:08] if you deal with things having sinus and
[27:11] so forth I've got a little bit of that
[27:13] and when we stepped off the plane on
[27:15] Friday well we went here from what 80s
[27:19] so all of a sudden I stepped off the
[27:21] plane it was in the 30s you know I love
[27:25] snow and snow was on the ground it
[27:28] snowed the whole time except for the
[27:30] last day and so you know you have that
[27:34] part which I'm having my psyche my mind
[27:37] is having to adjust to that because I'm
[27:39] used to going as we all are from the
[27:42] winter into the spring and then into the
[27:44] summer you know the work that's normal
[27:47] but everything now from going through
[27:49] that I I find myself trying to look back
[27:52] at events at the first year I thinking
[27:54] wait a minute I'm back in warm no I have
[27:57] to remind myself we have not went
[27:59] through the winter yet here
[28:01] and you know it was the grayness you
[28:04] know how it is here when it's December
[28:06] and times where it's like the thick
[28:07] grayness and yet you don't see any
[28:09] sunlight and they said that was a little
[28:12] bit uncharacteristic for them but not
[28:15] need needless to say it was just a
[28:17] wonderful time with the brothers and
[28:20] sisters there and brother Eugene and
[28:21] sister Sarah Braun just just such a
[28:24] wonderful time of fellowship and well so
[28:29] just just so thankful for your prayers
[28:31] and that's that's what I was counting on
[28:33] is your prayers when we went in there to
[28:36] those services that the Lord would just
[28:38] have his way and say what he wanted to
[28:40] be said I heard you had a wonderful
[28:42] service here Amen just so thankful to
[28:46] the Lord for that
[28:47] amen so appreciate that I want to make
[28:51] just a few announcements before we turn
[28:53] in the word and that is I want to say I
[28:56] appreciate brother ray getting this
[28:57] together about the for the brothers to
[28:59] come together and eat on Sunday brother
[29:03] ray he's always thinking about eating
[29:11] but I'm just gonna if I could I just
[29:14] like to change it to we'll just meet
[29:16] we'll just go to the Perkins restaurant
[29:18] as well because I know that for some of
[29:22] for the brothers and things too to be
[29:24] able to help their wives in some cases
[29:26] and also to be there for their Adam also
[29:29] at times you know to be there maybe to
[29:31] get some pictures during that time as
[29:33] well so we can find another place in
[29:35] that restaurant to get off to ourselves
[29:37] if that be alright and and just have
[29:41] that in and it's instead I'd write I
[29:44] wanted to make that announcement instead
[29:46] of just send it out to you by email
[29:47] because you might be looking at saying
[29:49] what's being said and I hope that's
[29:51] clear tonight I hope I haven't fussed
[29:53] everything up you know so for the
[29:56] brothers we will also go to Perkins but
[29:58] we will not be in the shower and I okay
[30:03] with that
[30:06] all right brother ray you'll be on point
[30:10] to make sure you get the table set up
[30:11] there
[30:14] like to also say we thank God I'm not
[30:17] going to be able to read this but we
[30:20] want to thank God for answering prayer
[30:23] you know brother mark has been giving a
[30:26] request for the Lord to to provide a job
[30:31] for him and the Lord willing a testimony
[30:33] follow and God has certainly answered
[30:35] the prayer
[30:42] I would say you know the details and
[30:45] things like that that they can certainly
[30:47] they're important and they can be shared
[30:50] with others but the market had a print
[30:52] out there and just for a sake of time
[30:55] within a service I think the most
[30:57] important thing is when we see God move
[31:00] in different prayers that request that
[31:03] we have and no matter what that is in
[31:05] this situation it's for a job and we've
[31:08] seen God move for that here in the
[31:10] assembly I all my heart and we can say
[31:14] lord help me together all of these
[31:16] things in and to just to rest upon you
[31:21] for the needs that are in my life amen
[31:25] I believe that these are testimonies the
[31:27] things that happen in our life when you
[31:30] look what Paul said Paul said in the
[31:32] book of Philippians the things which
[31:34] have befallen us have done so for the
[31:37] furtherance of the gospel so the the
[31:40] experiences and tests and trials in our
[31:42] life are truly the molding and shaping
[31:44] and the growing of the character in our
[31:47] life and yet at the same time that is
[31:50] also a testimony and a comfort to others
[31:53] as well so we just want to say thank God
[31:56] for that we so appreciate the Lord so
[32:00] are you ready for the word tonight amen
[32:02] let's look in the word and in Psalms 32
[32:06] and we just ask the Lord that he would
[32:08] just come by our way tonight because we
[32:11] surely need him we surely need him
[32:18] Psalms 32 and we're just going to read a
[32:21] few verses and we'll let you be seated
[32:24] but beginning at verse 7 and I want you
[32:31] to notice here's David this is David
[32:35] declaring this of the Lord thou art my
[32:41] hiding place and thou shalt preserve me
[32:44] from trouble
[32:47] thou shall compass me about with songs
[32:52] of deliverance
[32:55] Salem and I will know what God respond
[33:01] and watch what God says directly I will
[33:06] instruct thee and teach thee in the way
[33:09] which thou shalt go and I will guide
[33:14] thee with mine I ve not as the horse or
[33:20] as the mule which have no understanding
[33:25] whose mouths must be held in with bit
[33:28] and brow and bridle lest they come near
[33:31] unto thee many sorrows shall be to the
[33:34] wicked but he that trusteth in the Lord
[33:37] mercy shall compass him about be glad in
[33:40] the Lord and rejoice you righteous and
[33:43] shout for joy all ye that are upright in
[33:47] heart so let's just ask his blessing on
[33:51] the word as we look into it this evening
[33:54] Heavenly Father Oh God
[33:58] we are just so thankful for this
[34:01] opportunity that we have to be able to
[34:04] come together as believers brothers and
[34:07] sisters of like precious faith Father we
[34:10] pray this evening that oh god that you
[34:14] would come Lord in our myths Lord
[34:17] through your word and that you would
[34:19] Lord move us out of the way speak O God
[34:23] to our hearts Lord and father Lord calls
[34:27] Lord our hearts Lord to understand Lord
[34:30] O God we just ask that you would now
[34:34] minister Lord for you know every need
[34:37] Lord in our midst or God and father may
[34:41] you settle every heart Lord Jesus and I
[34:44] pray that God that you'll just Lord have
[34:47] your way in the service Lord in the name
[34:50] of Jesus Christ amen
[34:53] god bless yous your being seated I want
[34:57] to just if you would look with me as
[35:00] well in John 5 verse 19 I want to go
[35:03] back into that place of Scripture
[35:07] noticing the the comfort that David is
[35:12] expressed that the Lord is his hiding
[35:14] place and that the Lord Himself will
[35:18] preserve him in that of trouble and he
[35:23] would surround him with songs of
[35:25] deliverance and God's fulfillment or
[35:28] God's commitment is that I will instruct
[35:31] thee and teach the in the way which thou
[35:33] shalt go and I will guide thee with mine
[35:36] I I look at that and I know there's so
[35:40] much you know and God will break as we
[35:42] have need of it open to what we have
[35:44] need of but I look at the simplicity
[35:46] that God would speak to us be not as the
[35:50] horse or as the mule which have no
[35:53] understanding whose mouths must be held
[35:55] in with bit and bridle unless they come
[35:57] near thee God's desire is that our lives
[36:01] would be so harnessed to his word by his
[36:06] spirit that we are not in a place to
[36:12] where we have to be driven but where we
[36:15] can be led
[36:17] that's God's pleasure you you realize
[36:20] that that's his pleasure the Bible says
[36:22] that this that the sons of God are led
[36:25] by the Spirit of God leadership is a
[36:29] privilege it's an honor to be to be led
[36:34] that is God's greatest desire look how
[36:37] God came down and even though Israel
[36:40] knew the promise of what God had for
[36:43] them when they were in Egypt they knew
[36:47] about the promise they even had a
[36:50] reminder that they would walk by daily
[36:53] weekly depending on where they were at
[36:54] that God was gonna visit them according
[36:57] to the promise they could look at the
[36:59] bones of Joseph he said when God visits
[37:02] you and he will don't you leave my bones
[37:05] here you take him back with you so they
[37:08] had a constant reminder among them but
[37:12] within this it took God coming on the
[37:15] scene and we we know the background on
[37:17] the story we don't have time for that
[37:18] but
[37:19] God come on the scene and even though
[37:22] Moses would be the human vessel in which
[37:25] God would take and speak his word
[37:27] through yet Moses himself had to be
[37:31] completely surrendered and completely
[37:34] stripped of himself in order for God to
[37:38] do it and then God moves through that
[37:40] channel in God then brings the people
[37:43] out in the land and it's God leading
[37:47] them the entire time it's God's
[37:50] leadership it was a privilege they were
[37:53] not brought out as the Spirit of God
[37:56] would remind him in the book of
[37:58] Deuteronomy you were not brought out of
[38:00] the iron furnace of Egypt by your own
[38:03] doing but I brought you out as a matter
[38:07] of fact God let him know I have bore you
[38:10] unto myself on eagle's wings God was
[38:15] letting them know all of these things
[38:17] were reminders of what he had done and
[38:21] if we can see it and look at it then we
[38:24] can rest to know that what he has done
[38:27] he which was is the same he that is and
[38:31] he that is is the same he that shall
[38:33] come so it's Jesus Christ from beginning
[38:37] to end it's all that privilege of being
[38:40] under the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[38:43] and to see how that God here when this
[38:48] expression that is given in John 5:19 a
[38:52] very a very common scripture to us that
[38:55] we can look at an old that this this is
[38:58] not just a scripture to us as believers
[39:02] but we recognize this is the privilege
[39:06] that is afforded to sons and daughters
[39:10] of God who through the very opening of
[39:14] the blood cell of the Lamb of God and
[39:17] the imparting of that life that we have
[39:20] the opportunity and privilege to come
[39:23] into this relationship that God was in
[39:27] Christ and we have the privilege to come
[39:30] into that relationship that
[39:32] is God in Christ and Christ in US making
[39:36] us one and accepted in the beloved
[39:40] it is a privilege it is it is the honor
[39:45] that we have for this invitation because
[39:48] remember what Adam forfeited Christ came
[39:53] and redeemed when God could speak to
[39:57] Adam in the beginning these were not
[40:00] when Adam named those creatures Adam was
[40:04] not guessing it was not as though just
[40:07] words were just dropping but Adam was
[40:10] walking under the very mind of God in
[40:15] that moment to be able to speak in other
[40:18] words Adam was not saying giraffe and
[40:21] then looking to say did I say the right
[40:23] thing or horse did I say the right thing
[40:25] but you see there was such a harmony
[40:28] that came that Adam was operating in the
[40:31] mind of God and there was an authority
[40:35] that came with it
[40:36] Adam was was walking in a place to where
[40:40] he knew what God wanted in the season of
[40:45] the word that he was in Adam did not
[40:49] know what God or what the full
[40:52] understanding was on multiply and
[40:54] replenish we understand that right
[40:56] we understand he didn't know that at
[40:59] that time but you see what God has
[41:01] spoken the promise is if we will walk
[41:05] faithful and obedience and patiently
[41:08] wait by looking to him God will bring
[41:11] everything to pass in his season and in
[41:15] his time and we'll be right in line with
[41:18] what he is doing in that moment Satan
[41:22] knows that God's promise cannot fail
[41:26] because the promise is God you ask me he
[41:32] knows it cannot fail so remember the
[41:35] same tactic that Satan is always used is
[41:38] to try to push people beyond the promise
[41:42] or to hold them back from the promise
[41:45] see there's ways of doing that the same
[41:48] thing applies which the Prophet made
[41:51] these statements and they are principles
[41:53] that have not passed but principles that
[41:56] must be applied to today and that is man
[41:59] is always rejoicing in what has been
[42:05] looking to what will be but failing to
[42:08] catch the junction that joins the past
[42:10] and the future and the only one who
[42:14] joins that is Christ himself
[42:17] you see when Christ himself is revealed
[42:20] there's no longer a breach between the
[42:22] past and the future now you see him who
[42:26] was is and shall be you see Christ being
[42:30] revealed because we can look at the past
[42:33] rejoice in the past relish with the past
[42:35] and miss the present and to miss the
[42:38] present is to miss the future so then to
[42:43] correctly then to be able to see this is
[42:46] to recognize him
[42:47] then it's him back there and to
[42:49] recognize that he's still the same God
[42:52] today and what is his plan and his
[42:55] program and his desire for this moment
[42:59] and this is what the Lord Jesus is
[43:03] expressing here that the son can do
[43:07] nothing what obedience this was not one
[43:12] who had bitten bridle in his mouth but
[43:15] here was an understanding it is very
[43:17] important the son can do nothing is up
[43:19] he knew who he was he knew his position
[43:25] he knew his relationship see all of this
[43:29] it did not result result in a place of
[43:33] pride you see when one understands who
[43:37] they are and in the relationship it
[43:39] brings forth a real true humility to
[43:45] wait and to look to the Lord for all
[43:48] things because it's not about what man
[43:51] looks at what man is seeing what man
[43:55] wants but it's about what does my
[43:58] father what it's looking to please him
[44:03] that's the objective so this is what the
[44:07] Lord Jesus is making aware that what the
[44:09] son see it so here the opening of this
[44:12] of the veil here this relationship what
[44:16] the son seeth the father doing now I
[44:18] want you to catch this here here is is
[44:21] the Lord Jesus standing in this time
[44:23] here and these promises that have laid
[44:27] in the scripture concerning the Messiah
[44:29] have been quickened to him they have
[44:34] been made alive to him personally and so
[44:39] what he is expressing is who the Word
[44:42] says he is so he's walking in this place
[44:47] of authority there's a channel that is
[44:51] open between him and the Father in other
[44:54] words the readings the scrolls the
[44:56] prophets the Psalms all of those things
[44:59] are no longer just print but those
[45:01] things unfold to him his position of who
[45:05] he is and there's a channel that's open
[45:08] that he's able to see what God is doing
[45:11] in that time so it's not just listen to
[45:15] me it's not just walking around the
[45:18] scrolls and say thank God for Jeremiah
[45:20] thank God for Isaiah thank God for
[45:23] Ezekiel thank God for Joel thank God for
[45:25] Habakkuk know he is catching the vision
[45:28] of who it is that was behind the
[45:31] prophets and by catching that vision
[45:34] then he himself is standing there to
[45:37] fulfill the words that were spoken by
[45:40] the prophets moved by the Spirit of God
[45:43] and as he submits to that in humility
[45:46] the same Spirit of God who moved upon
[45:49] the prophets to speak that word is the
[45:52] same spirit of God moving through him to
[45:55] manifest that word so it's the same
[45:58] working of God all the way God with us
[46:02] God above us God with us
[46:05] God in us
[46:07] so here it's the Sun who holds that life
[46:12] remember the father of the word and that
[46:16] as it speaks the father the word the son
[46:19] the Holy Spirit these are one
[46:22] it's a pulsating of life think of this
[46:24] he who the Sun quickeneth has life this
[46:30] is the promise as that right and to see
[46:34] how that when that word was moving it
[46:39] brought those who were just walking in
[46:43] an order of life an order of cosmos of
[46:47] this life when that word moved upon them
[46:51] it quickens them and raises them from
[46:54] the order of cosmos to the order of true
[46:59] life you know we read in the scriptures
[47:04] so and where Andrew and Philip and all
[47:07] them they left and they left they were
[47:09] no longer tax collector they were no
[47:11] longer this they were no longer that
[47:12] that whole the whole synopsis of all of
[47:15] that is that what where they were at
[47:18] already remember they knew these
[47:22] prophecies they knew these writings are
[47:26] you with me they weren't ignorant of
[47:28] these things they knew about them they
[47:31] knew about them just as well as the
[47:34] Pharisees knew about them but the
[47:36] difference is is that when this promise
[47:38] of the Messiah was manifested on to them
[47:42] through the Lord Jesus it was something
[47:45] that it brought forth in them as they
[47:48] were identified in that promise and
[47:51] everything else of this life became
[47:54] secondary they understand when we look
[47:58] at this in the prints of the word it's
[48:00] not saying will you quit your job you do
[48:02] this you quit this you quit that and we
[48:04] go and we live in a communal environment
[48:06] that's not what that's not the program
[48:08] at all but what it is expressing that
[48:10] when this has truly been revealed and
[48:13] what is taking place everything else
[48:16] becomes secondary
[48:19] and it becomes this Paul express Christ
[48:22] who is our life if you think back in the
[48:26] days of Noah Noah once that is revealed
[48:29] Noah did nothing that would hinder the
[48:32] ark from going forward
[48:34] so what was it Christ in that day was
[48:38] the theme of Noah's message he was the
[48:42] theme of Noah's life he was the thinking
[48:45] filter of which Noah passed everything
[48:49] through and judged all things by that
[48:53] revelation that had taken preeminence in
[48:56] his life
[48:58] you see we speak of discernment
[49:01] but it's discerning all things because
[49:04] all around us and in every moment no
[49:06] maybe you can never let down discernment
[49:09] is not an option discernment is not like
[49:12] heated and cooled seats in your car
[49:14] discernment is a must for the hour
[49:20] hallelujah and then discernment itself
[49:25] when we look that the site that was
[49:28] present at that time were those who were
[49:32] polishing the tombs of those who had
[49:36] been moved by the Spirit of God but they
[49:38] kept going around those tombs and they
[49:41] were worshipping as it were the latter
[49:44] but yet they failed to see the Christ
[49:48] the God who was present there to even
[49:52] express what became letter they failed
[49:55] to catch that and see it and because of
[49:58] that they looked at the latter they
[50:01] looked at the Lord Jesus and they said
[50:03] this is what Moses said your Beelzebub
[50:06] they could not tie the two together but
[50:09] here are ignorant and unlearned men and
[50:13] it was not their learning that brought
[50:15] the two together but it was that
[50:18] election and foreign nation of God was
[50:21] there and the presence of God moving
[50:24] upon their life it ties those things
[50:27] together
[50:28] where that the promises were laying here
[50:31] that they were looking for and there was
[50:34] a seed and within their hearts and their
[50:36] life Christ himself spans the breach and
[50:40] gets a hold of their life and
[50:42] manifesting that promise so that the
[50:45] life itself will flow into the body of
[50:49] believers its Christ working it's his
[50:52] life so well the rest is looking at just
[50:57] letter and all they see his church
[51:01] that's all they see is Church all they
[51:04] see his letter all they see is tradition
[51:07] and remember now
[51:09] they weren't lazy they were zealous
[51:12] regarding church they were zealous
[51:16] regarding traditions even with things
[51:19] with brother so-and-so the brother
[51:20] so-and-so the brother so-and-so said
[51:22] that brother so-and-so said all of those
[51:24] things they were zealous with traditions
[51:27] they were zealous with the latter but
[51:31] the Lord Jesus could see the father
[51:35] working you with me he was working he
[51:42] was moving and he caught what was taking
[51:46] place to where now that even when the
[51:49] Lord Jesus was letting them know John
[51:53] has come he's introduced the Messiah so
[51:59] there was a junction introduced the
[52:01] Messiah now here he is coming to a place
[52:04] to where now the offering up and the
[52:07] fulfillment of that word will lead into
[52:09] another part another phase where it will
[52:11] actually be that same God now come and
[52:15] dwell inside of the people tabernacling
[52:19] in the mystical body of Jesus Christ
[52:23] through him by this spirit
[52:26] so it's a key Junction to know where
[52:30] we're at and even the Lord Jesus himself
[52:32] would speak of this in John 14 and he
[52:36] referred and said the Spirit of Truth
[52:40] and that's powerful the spirit of truth
[52:44] remember truth is not a doctrine truth
[52:48] is not a letter truth is the person of
[52:52] Jesus Christ the Spirit of Truth so
[52:59] notice the Lord Jesus says whom the
[53:01] world cannot receive they can't receive
[53:05] the Spirit of Truth because if cieth him
[53:10] not it's not aware of him because it
[53:16] sees him not neither knows him and that
[53:19] incredible looking at the same word but
[53:23] yet cannot see him I tell you if your
[53:27] eyes and your heart are opened you ought
[53:30] to be thankful to God because let me
[53:33] tell you something you didn't give that
[53:34] to yourself God has given that to you
[53:39] [Applause]
[53:40] you didn't study your way into it you
[53:44] are ordained to it and remember it's not
[53:48] these eyes it's this down here these are
[53:52] the eyes that he's come to open right
[53:57] this was closed off the profits at times
[54:00] the profits could see the profits could
[54:02] they would Express of what was going on
[54:04] but you realize all of those things were
[54:07] examples of what God's desire was to do
[54:11] and to be once he got himself a son
[54:14] again he had to get himself a son again
[54:19] in order that he might come down pay the
[54:23] price and then impart his life upon that
[54:27] life that was already there in order to
[54:30] breed back sons and daughters of God
[54:33] again he had to do that a great mystery
[54:39] of his life being expressed and notice
[54:43] he says because they see him not neither
[54:46] know him but you know him for he
[54:51] dwelleth with
[54:53] you and shall be in you the Lord Jesus
[54:58] has just declared in the scripture that
[55:00] he that is walking with you though he is
[55:04] here in this veil in this vessel he
[55:08] shall be in you see see it was necessary
[55:13] to catch that Junction from he that is
[55:16] with you too he that is in you it's
[55:21] necessary without catching that you're
[55:23] still looking back he then is with us
[55:25] the Lord Jesus walking with us though
[55:27] but remember the Lord Jesus here his
[55:30] word of what he has said the Spirit of
[55:33] Truth he will come to you is the right
[55:38] according to his word amen so we see
[55:44] that that the Spirit of Truth it is that
[55:47] person of the Lord Jesus Christ and I
[55:51] take our direction and our focus here
[55:54] back to the scripture we were looking at
[55:57] there a few weeks ago out of Zechariah 4
[56:00] and to look at it in this manner of
[56:04] Zechariah 4 verse 1 whereby that the
[56:07] angel Zechariah said that talked with me
[56:09] came again and waked me as a man that is
[56:15] wakened out of his sleep and as we were
[56:19] just just speaking on this in the
[56:21] closing moments the last time I believe
[56:23] if we notice within the scripture here
[56:27] when we look at it then it waked me as a
[56:32] man then is wakened out of his sleep but
[56:35] notice what it was that woke him up the
[56:40] angel talked with me so the angel was
[56:46] not just present but there was a message
[56:51] there was something to be given that
[56:54] pertained to him and when this was
[56:58] apparently angel that spoke to me came
[57:00] again a woke me as a man that is waken
[57:04] out of his sleep and to realize here
[57:06] Zecharia has the Spirit of God is making
[57:10] this clear to us Zakaria is here in the
[57:14] midst of this time and remember this is
[57:17] a time right here in the rebuilding of
[57:19] the temple after the return of Babylon
[57:22] there within the stages to where wort
[57:25] has been has ceased for 15 years and and
[57:30] notice the Holy Spirit speaking here
[57:33] within it Zechariah is wakened his lies
[57:38] are wide open but now he becomes
[57:41] awakened you know your eyes can be open
[57:45] and yet you're asleep I mean there are
[57:51] people who can do that but I'm saying
[57:53] you can have your eyes open and yet
[57:57] you're not alert to what's taking place
[58:00] because it's not these eyes that see it
[58:04] it's the eyes down here it's because of
[58:09] the new birth the Holy Spirit the Spirit
[58:12] of Truth the guide that has come into
[58:15] the Church of the Living God that lets
[58:18] us see that the father is not dormant
[58:22] the father is working he is working what
[58:29] he seeth the father doing that doeth the
[58:33] son likewise it's operating in an open
[58:37] channel of what God is doing within this
[58:40] hour so notice how the Spirit of God
[58:43] will take Zechariah in that time and he
[58:46] will show Zachariah the seven golden
[58:49] candlesticks then he brings Zachariah to
[58:52] a place which is a statement that I I
[58:54] believe is so so important that I trust
[58:57] that we can pick up here and a little
[58:59] bit we're God lets him know this when
[59:02] you're looking at those seven golden
[59:05] candlesticks you're seeing those two
[59:07] olive trees one on either side where the
[59:09] oil is feeding there into that lamp
[59:12] stand let this be known to you Zechariah
[59:16] that this is not by might not by power
[59:19] but by my spirit saith the Lord God is
[59:25] letting it be known this is my working
[59:28] this is instrumentation but I am the
[59:32] energy I am the vine ye are the branches
[59:39] hallelujah
[59:41] notice how the Spirit of God would take
[59:44] us as Paul would direct us in Romans
[59:47] 13:11 and it would say and that knowing
[59:52] the time that now it is high time to
[59:58] awake out of sleep for now is our
[1:00:01] salvation nearer than when we believed I
[1:00:05] want you to catch this Paul is writing
[1:00:08] this Paul is the first church age
[1:00:11] messenger and Paul here he is writing
[1:00:14] and the age itself is even opening
[1:00:17] afterwards and Paul is writing this by
[1:00:22] under the leadership and the unction of
[1:00:24] the Holy Spirit because remember God is
[1:00:27] building a church and it's not something
[1:00:33] that it waits to the end and then all of
[1:00:35] a sudden at the end he gets built but
[1:00:38] it's little by little stone on top of
[1:00:41] stone experience after experience word
[1:00:45] on top of word trial after trial it is
[1:00:48] all being built as a habitation for
[1:00:52] Almighty God and this is where Paul is
[1:00:57] calling the urgency it's high time to
[1:01:01] awake out of sleep so it's not that the
[1:01:06] people were sleeping physically this is
[1:01:09] not he's speaking spiritually they're
[1:01:12] not aware of what's going on now you can
[1:01:16] look and I can look and we recognize
[1:01:18] that this was not the hour of of the
[1:01:22] coming of the Lord and yet it was his
[1:01:25] coming
[1:01:26] this is all part of his coming the
[1:01:31] coming of the Holy Spirit in every age
[1:01:35] he's coming and he's gonna come in a
[1:01:38] corporal body for those he's come for
[1:01:42] here with me so here Paul is wakening
[1:01:46] them to the place for it for right now
[1:01:49] is our salvation nearer than when we
[1:01:52] believe you catch that the word itself
[1:01:54] coming in this moment it puts the
[1:01:57] believers in awareness to live for that
[1:02:00] moment and they are living for that time
[1:02:03] because we don't know the day nor the
[1:02:06] hour but we are living for that moment
[1:02:09] it's like you're waiting maybe you know
[1:02:12] as the testimony we have for a job
[1:02:13] you're praying for a job Lord I'm
[1:02:15] looking for you for a job Lord this is
[1:02:17] what you said in the word that I've
[1:02:19] never seen the righteous forsaken or a
[1:02:21] child of God bringing bread all of those
[1:02:22] promises are coming out in prayer and
[1:02:24] you're reciting those promises and you
[1:02:27] know what as you're praying over those
[1:02:28] promises those are your promises and as
[1:02:32] you're praying you're waiting you're
[1:02:34] watching you're believing and then when
[1:02:36] the door itself opens you're alerted
[1:02:38] this is the time this is the moment
[1:02:41] you're alerted to that which you've been
[1:02:43] alerted to wait for for now is our
[1:02:49] salvation nearer than when we believed
[1:02:53] you consider this Paul being an Alpha
[1:02:56] messenger you consider that the ministry
[1:02:59] that God has brought upon this earth in
[1:03:01] the last day was to do what I have
[1:03:04] preached what Paul has preached many of
[1:03:09] the things which Paul spoke it put the
[1:03:11] believers down through the age into that
[1:03:14] place of readiness how did it happen by
[1:03:20] the word by the word you see this was
[1:03:26] not something to say let's all go sell
[1:03:30] our houses
[1:03:31] let's all go create a little campsite
[1:03:34] and we'll all just pitch tents around
[1:03:35] this over this way no that's to make
[1:03:38] yourself odd
[1:03:41] that's to make yourself odd but the
[1:03:44] direct instructions and guidance of the
[1:03:48] Holy Spirit coming through the Prophet
[1:03:50] he said don't make yourself odd when
[1:03:58] people can look at things like that and
[1:03:59] say it's a call they've got a right to
[1:04:01] say that because there can be cultic
[1:04:04] actions how you estimate cultic
[1:04:08] behaviors but the bride of Jesus cries
[1:04:10] is not operated by Coptic behavior she
[1:04:15] is under the leadership of the Holy
[1:04:18] Spirit it is cries in our midst that we
[1:04:23] are worshiping with but we are rallying
[1:04:27] around him because without him we have
[1:04:30] no life hallelujah notice the unction
[1:04:41] the night is far spent the day is at
[1:04:48] hand Paul declared it there the day is
[1:04:53] at hand
[1:04:54] very close it is at hand at hand doesn't
[1:05:01] mean right now but it means to be alert
[1:05:04] for that which is approaching stand on
[1:05:07] guard to be ready when even when through
[1:05:09] and when when John could say the kingdom
[1:05:11] of heaven is at hand at hand here it is
[1:05:15] here it is a present approach let us
[1:05:19] look at this let us therefore cast off
[1:05:23] the works of darkness and let us put on
[1:05:27] the armor of light the Lord is the light
[1:05:32] of my life
[1:05:34] let us not want to let us cast off the
[1:05:38] works of darkness and put on the armor
[1:05:42] of light moving and being clothed and
[1:05:46] dressed in the light of him
[1:05:52] let us walk notice let us walk honestly
[1:05:56] as in the day now if you turn off the
[1:06:01] lights and it's dark people could do
[1:06:07] things and nobody would see it but Paul
[1:06:12] is letting them know let us walk
[1:06:16] honestly there would be dark but light
[1:06:20] has come to us the day has already broke
[1:06:25] in our hearts let us walk honestly as in
[1:06:29] the day hallelujah not in rioting and in
[1:06:34] drunkenness not in chambering and
[1:06:36] wantonness not in strife and inhibiting
[1:06:38] you not pause preaching here he's
[1:06:40] preaching the message and the Ministry
[1:06:43] of all of the character of that heavenly
[1:06:48] Jerusalem because after all the order of
[1:06:53] the city is the order of the people who
[1:06:55] live in it and this is why that the
[1:06:59] Prophet would express this when he's
[1:07:01] there in God hiding in self in
[1:07:03] simplicity and revealing himself in the
[1:07:06] same he's dedicating that of the elder
[1:07:09] of the tabernacle they're a jury at
[1:07:11] Jeffersonville but that is not the focus
[1:07:14] that is not the event that was taking
[1:07:16] wrong taking place but there was a
[1:07:19] tabernacle of the Living God the bride
[1:07:22] of Jesus Christ that by the word is
[1:07:26] being dedicated to God himself that he
[1:07:30] might step in that Tabernacle the word
[1:07:37] calling us to himself you with me he
[1:07:43] that was there in that ministry was to
[1:07:47] declare and announce that as the passing
[1:07:50] of that veil moves off it was to bring
[1:07:53] us to a place to where it is no longer a
[1:07:56] swelling with Christ but Christ dwelling
[1:07:59] in
[1:08:00] Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:08:04] and how are we dedicated by the word the
[1:08:10] way it brings us to a place of
[1:08:13] dedication and you are that Tabernacle
[1:08:18] that he purchased you are that building
[1:08:21] that he's been working on he's been
[1:08:24] building down through the ages that he
[1:08:27] himself might step in his fullness into
[1:08:30] his bride body ooh let us walk honestly
[1:08:39] as in the day
[1:08:42] let us as the Prophet said characterize
[1:08:45] our selves here as though we were
[1:08:48] already there let us live here as though
[1:08:52] we would live there if what is the quick
[1:08:56] examination if what you are doing here
[1:08:58] and the way you are standing here and
[1:09:01] you cannot fit it in over there then you
[1:09:03] need to repent and you need to allow God
[1:09:07] to move for you so that your life can
[1:09:10] reflect that over there because the
[1:09:15] rapture is not going to change that the
[1:09:17] rapture is a manifestation of a change
[1:09:20] and a molding that's already been going
[1:09:22] on the rapture is the final climax of
[1:09:27] the rapture here with me the rapture is
[1:09:32] a cycle whereby you have already caught
[1:09:35] up with Jesus Christ though here we who
[1:09:39] were dead in sin and trespasses yet now
[1:09:43] hath he quickened and we are seating
[1:09:47] seated in heavenly places with Christ
[1:09:51] Jesus we recognize we have
[1:09:57] representation we recognize and know who
[1:10:01] we are see that authority in that
[1:10:05] channel opens we are citizens of the
[1:10:08] king
[1:10:10] our citizenship is in heaven
[1:10:13] I don't care what your earthly is your
[1:10:15] that soul is a citizen of heaven you are
[1:10:20] you you are a delegate of heaven you now
[1:10:23] they send delegates from one nation to
[1:10:26] another nation and they represent this
[1:10:28] nation what this nation stands for let
[1:10:31] me tell you something
[1:10:32] when God deposited his life and raised
[1:10:35] up that life that was already
[1:10:37] predestinated within you you are a
[1:10:40] delegate of heaven you are a
[1:10:42] representative of all that heaven is and
[1:10:45] all that heaven stands for and as you
[1:10:47] stand upon that word then all of heaven
[1:10:50] is standing behind you you are delicate
[1:10:57] of that new City a delicate of that
[1:10:59] heavenly Jerusalem because the lie of
[1:11:02] that round that heavenly Jerusalem has
[1:11:05] moved inside of you we are not of Hagar
[1:11:12] we are not of a church we are not of a
[1:11:16] movement we are born of that New
[1:11:21] Jerusalem the Holy Spirit and showing
[1:11:25] forth at our site has become open we
[1:11:28] have met our milk esident and he is here
[1:11:31] with us to repeat of God and we are
[1:11:37] looking for a city whose builder and
[1:11:41] maker is God glory be to God hallelujah
[1:11:50] blessed should be the name of the Lord
[1:11:53] hallelujah you talking about riches
[1:11:56] we've got true riches do you catch that
[1:12:01] when Abraham here after the battle was
[1:12:03] over that he was tempted with the riches
[1:12:07] of Sodom he was tempted for all the
[1:12:10] labor that he had done in bringing back
[1:12:12] those souls he was tempted to take and
[1:12:15] be made rich by Sodom but he stood there
[1:12:19] has a true son of God and he refused the
[1:12:23] rich
[1:12:23] of Sodom and when he refused the riches
[1:12:26] of Sodom here came Melchizedek and the
[1:12:31] Prophet tells us Melchizedek had been
[1:12:34] put out of Jerusalem there and he was
[1:12:37] coming to Abraham as Christ was put out
[1:12:40] of the church but he come to you he came
[1:12:43] to me at sons and daughters of God where
[1:12:47] he's not exiled he's not a fugitive he
[1:12:51] is the love and desire of our lives
[1:12:57] here's my riches here's my pleasure
[1:13:03] this bread this wine but put you on the
[1:13:12] Lord Jesus Christ notice puts you on
[1:13:14] sink into sink into the Lord Jesus
[1:13:19] Christ sink into yielded being clothed
[1:13:23] with him and make not provision for the
[1:13:29] flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof make
[1:13:34] not providential care for the flesh how
[1:13:39] do I not make providential care
[1:13:41] provision for the flesh by being focused
[1:13:44] on him as you're focused on him he is
[1:13:51] your authority for every attack that
[1:13:54] comes upon you he is our strength
[1:13:58] thou art my hiding place thou shalt
[1:14:03] preserve me in the time of trouble that
[1:14:06] will compass me with songs of
[1:14:08] deliverance you know what a song does I
[1:14:11] could play a melody up here right now
[1:14:13] and you'd start singing it words would
[1:14:16] come right back to you when a melody
[1:14:19] strikes there's a power within something
[1:14:22] sometimes you know you might be in a
[1:14:23] store and they're songs you used to
[1:14:25] listen to before God got ahold of your
[1:14:27] life and that little tune can go over
[1:14:29] you could finish every phrase in every
[1:14:31] stanza and everything else why those
[1:14:33] words are so packed down in there and
[1:14:35] that song begins to
[1:14:36] stimulated well let me tell you
[1:14:38] something there is a song of deliverance
[1:14:42] that is a song of the redeemed a song of
[1:14:46] the Redeemer in Revelations 5 when it
[1:14:49] was broken it said they sang a new song
[1:14:52] our life is comfortable with the music
[1:14:56] of God symphony of which we are a part
[1:14:59] of this great symphony we are
[1:15:02] encompassed about we're songs of
[1:15:04] deliverance you let it be when you're
[1:15:06] going through a test you're going
[1:15:08] through a trial and all of a sudden a
[1:15:10] portal strike and something rises up
[1:15:12] within you
[1:15:13] I am the Lord that deliver thee I am the
[1:15:16] lord that he'll see I am redeemed I am a
[1:15:19] son of God I am a daughter of God he is
[1:15:23] my way maker
[1:15:25] it's songs of deliverance Paul is it
[1:15:32] truly exhorting the believers that they
[1:15:35] would walk in faith that they may please
[1:15:38] the Lord and prevail and stifle anything
[1:15:43] that would seek to hinder attacks are
[1:15:51] always around us always
[1:15:58] but remember let us walk honestly as in
[1:16:02] the day let us walk honestly let us be
[1:16:07] focused on him let us put him on I know
[1:16:16] how do I put him on what as he is
[1:16:19] opening himself up in the word walking
[1:16:21] that the things that that God is
[1:16:24] breaking in ministering listen friends
[1:16:26] you know this just as much as I know it
[1:16:28] the things that is being ministered
[1:16:30] right here are not things that is
[1:16:32] contrived by my thinking you know as
[1:16:34] well as I do there are things that where
[1:16:36] chords are being struck of scriptures
[1:16:38] you've read there's messages you've been
[1:16:40] listening to and certain things that are
[1:16:43] coming together I'm telling you this is
[1:16:45] not the orchestration of
[1:16:47] man it's God his program and what he's
[1:16:51] doing to show you his providential care
[1:16:54] for us and if he cares for us we ought
[1:16:58] to care about what he's doing and give
[1:17:02] ourselves to it what we see the father
[1:17:04] doing that doeth the son likewise o
[1:17:09] blessed be his name the Bible says in
[1:17:13] Hebrews 11 let me come down in Hebrews
[1:17:18] 11 the Bible says that Abraham and Sarah
[1:17:20] they said they looked for a city whose
[1:17:24] builder and maker was God
[1:17:27] they knew that city would have to be
[1:17:30] upon this earth see that mystery already
[1:17:33] hidden back there that was just not a
[1:17:35] good saying to tickle people's ears it
[1:17:38] was a reality showing that the future
[1:17:40] home would be here upon this earth to
[1:17:42] know even as God would speak to Abraham
[1:17:44] and let Abraham know that that would
[1:17:47] whatsoever not that I see it from the
[1:17:50] north to south east to west over into a
[1:17:51] land that I have given thee you know God
[1:17:54] was saying this land is yours even
[1:17:56] though you've not walked on it I've
[1:17:58] already given it to you the land already
[1:18:01] belong to him let me tell you something
[1:18:05] every promise already belongs to you
[1:18:11] hallelujah is to stand up there and
[1:18:14] declare what belongs to you this promise
[1:18:19] bones to me he made a way for me and
[1:18:23] this promise is for me if there hadn't
[1:18:26] been nobody else he made that promise
[1:18:28] with me and mind glory be to God they
[1:18:34] were looking for a city whose builder
[1:18:35] and maker was God the Bible said they
[1:18:38] embrace the promises they embraced you
[1:18:44] know that word embrace it means they
[1:18:45] took them to their bosom they cherish
[1:18:49] those promises those promises it
[1:18:53] affected their life these were not these
[1:18:56] were not people who were just moving
[1:18:59] around things but these were people who
[1:19:02] the spirit of the promise that it spoke
[1:19:05] of the coming Messiah had so plucked
[1:19:08] their heartstrings that they took those
[1:19:10] promises and they were waiting they held
[1:19:14] him dear to their hearts oh sure they
[1:19:18] had ups and downs sure sure they had
[1:19:21] times of discouragement tell them
[1:19:24] somebody you know what in reality not
[1:19:26] only was God molding and making them but
[1:19:29] if the Prophet would point out to us and
[1:19:30] souls in prison now he said I often
[1:19:33] wondered how why God would let Abraham
[1:19:35] and Sarah go down there like that he
[1:19:37] said but then I come to realize if it
[1:19:39] hadn't have been for that we would not
[1:19:41] have known the grace of God hallelujah
[1:19:50] glory it's one thing to know God's grace
[1:19:53] when God picks you up by the bootstraps
[1:19:55] and he saves your soul and filled you
[1:19:58] with the Holy Ghost but oh man how grace
[1:20:01] begins to teach our heart to fear even
[1:20:04] in the times when we have failed him
[1:20:06] when we have done maybe from our best or
[1:20:09] or in the mistakes that we made of
[1:20:11] failures but yet grace itself oh how
[1:20:13] great it appears to our life not that we
[1:20:16] might get by but thank God for His grace
[1:20:20] that we might go forward they embrace
[1:20:29] those promises they moved forward by the
[1:20:33] Spirit of God waiting for him these were
[1:20:37] not people who embraced the promises
[1:20:38] that just casually went and offered a
[1:20:42] lamb no they embrace the promise they
[1:20:47] embraced it
[1:20:48] it wasn't just going to the Tabernacle
[1:20:52] to offer a lamb it wasn't just offering
[1:20:55] up turtledoves you say brother Samuel
[1:20:57] did they see everything they didn't but
[1:21:00] what God had spoken that time it was
[1:21:04] something about it that they could see
[1:21:06] that this being God's program God's Way
[1:21:11] God's will
[1:21:13] and they were directed in it so they
[1:21:16] weren't people going through motions
[1:21:18] they were people who were put in motion
[1:21:26] the scripture says in second Corinthians
[1:21:31] 5:7 familiar scripture to us for we walk
[1:21:38] by faith and not by sight that's just a
[1:21:47] declarative and we did you just needed
[1:21:49] to declare that tonight I walk by faith
[1:21:51] and not by sight but I know there's been
[1:21:55] time forget the past behind you we walk
[1:22:01] by faith and not by sight oh brother
[1:22:06] Samuel that's awful deep of grief hey
[1:22:07] I'm not the one to preach the message of
[1:22:09] grace God preached a message of grace
[1:22:13] the prophets tapped into that
[1:22:15] inspiration when Abraham did what he did
[1:22:21] come on now when he took Hagar was he
[1:22:24] walking by faith or by sight by sight
[1:22:27] but watch this God's commitment to the
[1:22:31] promise that God Himself comes on the
[1:22:35] scene and showing his promise will not
[1:22:38] and it cannot be defeated and proving
[1:22:42] that in Abraham is out that elect stock
[1:22:45] when the way would pass over his way
[1:22:49] notice what happens quickly he's able to
[1:22:52] keep moving in by faith and not allowing
[1:22:57] the past to dominate and dictate his
[1:23:01] life that's faith faith allows you to
[1:23:07] say the past is the past
[1:23:11] to forget those things which are behind
[1:23:16] me can i press forward to the mark that
[1:23:22] leads ahead of me it shows where your
[1:23:25] eye is God is not having eyes on the
[1:23:30] side of his head looking back that's an
[1:23:32] unclean spirit
[1:23:37] but God's eye is an eye that looks
[1:23:39] forward it looks forward not behind
[1:23:42] because that which is behind is behind
[1:23:50] then alive I feel good already glory we
[1:23:57] walk by faith and not by sight
[1:23:59] you know citing just your nuts rise it's
[1:24:03] feelings too it's our thoughts sometimes
[1:24:10] that's walking here in this realm but we
[1:24:13] walk not by faith now
[1:24:16] I'm gonna just just drop this little
[1:24:18] example here and we'll just move move on
[1:24:22] let me just would you bring it down here
[1:24:25] here's a man by the name of blind
[1:24:27] Bartimaeus that each and every one of us
[1:24:29] we've heard about right hallelujah and
[1:24:37] you know brother Branham over here we'll
[1:24:39] go through this brother Graham did not
[1:24:41] tell this as rehearsing a Bible story
[1:24:44] you know what I'm talking about don't
[1:24:46] you when brother bran referred to these
[1:24:48] things and he would preach blind
[1:24:49] Bartimaeus he would preach those that
[1:24:51] many times over and then he would refer
[1:24:53] to these things do you realize brother
[1:24:55] Branham wasn't preaching a story he was
[1:24:57] preaching an event that was prophecy of
[1:25:01] what was to be that evening he was
[1:25:04] preaching what was to be prophecy for
[1:25:07] you and me that's what the script this
[1:25:11] is a book of prophecy not a book of
[1:25:14] history if it remains a book of history
[1:25:16] oh we worship around oh jesus healed the
[1:25:19] sick jesus healed the sick what a mighty
[1:25:21] ministry Jesus had Jesus did all sorts
[1:25:24] of things here we are
[1:25:25] were worshipping around the outside of
[1:25:28] what was done and were polishing up what
[1:25:40] he did this is not a book of history
[1:25:45] it's a book of prophecy what has taken
[1:25:50] place listen to me these are these
[1:25:53] prophecies are promises and in this hour
[1:25:57] God ain't makin promises he's fulfilling
[1:26:01] them he's fulfilling what he has
[1:26:06] promised some promises in prophecy are
[1:26:10] not written they're expressed can I
[1:26:15] preach a few moments they're not written
[1:26:17] but they're expressed Rebecca's low-road
[1:26:20] but yet it was the expression of the
[1:26:23] prophecy in her life same with Esther
[1:26:25] same acerra
[1:26:26] same with Mary but think about those
[1:26:28] contents of expression that are wrote in
[1:26:31] the word that if God not coming to show
[1:26:35] you and I you and I would have a king
[1:26:38] down there in career lusting after an
[1:26:41] old grandma and he lusted after her he
[1:26:49] wanted her so bad come on somebody but
[1:26:54] you see God opened it up to show you and
[1:26:57] I they were not old people they had been
[1:27:01] changed they were changed to receive the
[1:27:09] coming son it didn't see this and having
[1:27:11] that written there but there's an
[1:27:13] expression of prophecy that is picked up
[1:27:21] blind Bartimaeus
[1:27:23] he's sitting by the highway with Ram you
[1:27:29] know here brother Ram drama town daring
[1:27:31] a cool October morning leaves blowing by
[1:27:36] here's blind Bartimaeus now he not
[1:27:40] ignorant of the word he heard about a
[1:27:42] God who was above them he heard that but
[1:27:49] a blind bartimaeus when the Bible says
[1:27:51] when he heard that what was taking place
[1:27:54] that he was Jesus of Nazareth he began
[1:27:57] to cry out he recognized and he was
[1:28:02] convinced God was in Christ no sir you
[1:28:09] weren't gonna keep him just keep on
[1:28:11] going around Jericho old Joshua Joshua
[1:28:14] fought the Battle of Jericho Jericho sir
[1:28:17] buddy he recognized that the same God
[1:28:20] who led Joshua and brought those walls
[1:28:24] down was that same God who was present
[1:28:27] in Christ
[1:28:29] what was it faith gave him sight to
[1:28:32] where he which was he recognized he is
[1:28:36] and that tied him into the future
[1:28:40] without recognizing this he would remain
[1:28:44] blind you with me
[1:28:49] many charge to me this is what they said
[1:28:51] Shh shut up quit saying that so loud
[1:28:57] you're you're disturbing everything what
[1:28:59] the Bible says he crowd all crying all
[1:29:01] the more louder Jesus thou son of David
[1:29:06] have mercy on me he had a claim on him a
[1:29:12] son of David and here God revealed his
[1:29:18] power that was there in Christ to
[1:29:23] bartimaeus in that hour
[1:29:29] let me tell you what his crying did the
[1:29:32] Bible said Jesus stood still Jesus
[1:29:37] stopped it got a hold of his attention
[1:29:42] now you and I both know there ain't no
[1:29:45] way that his voice was greater than the
[1:29:47] rest of the voice it was faith that made
[1:29:51] contact with the Lord Jesus it was two
[1:29:56] on impotents coming together come on
[1:30:01] somebody just like the Prophet said in
[1:30:03] spiritual food a new season he said this
[1:30:06] is the secret here he said to recognize
[1:30:09] he said that how that it must be that
[1:30:12] gift in my life and there must be a gift
[1:30:15] of faith in your life and he said then
[1:30:17] that gift of faith in your life is able
[1:30:20] to receive what the gift has given forth
[1:30:22] in me and that is our secret food do you
[1:30:27] recognize that is our secret food it is
[1:30:31] Christ the eye of God dwelling in his
[1:30:35] many membered body just as he was
[1:30:39] dwelling and speaking and ministry
[1:30:42] through various prophet but now what is
[1:30:45] it dwelling within his bright body and
[1:30:48] it's that secret food sustaining
[1:30:54] quickening moving us it's not we're
[1:31:00] coming to hear sermons well wonder
[1:31:03] what's gonna be said today no this is
[1:31:07] life this is secret food right

[1:31:19] stored up but you're not eating raw
[1:31:20] cabbage we're not eating raw carrots but
[1:31:24] there's a man on the scene come on now
[1:31:27] that man who can turn on the light and
[1:31:30] he's the one that's bringing it all
[1:31:33] together he had prepared for me a table
[1:31:37] in the presence of mine enemies come on

[1:31:52] tell you something when he gave us the
[1:31:54] promised messiah he didn't give us grain
[1:31:57] he gave us bread from heaven that true
[1:32:01] manna glory be to God
[1:32:05] it's his life it's him that we're
[1:32:09] feeding on he son of man not a son a man
[1:32:16] that's to keep going oh oh thank God for
[1:32:21] this but it's to recognize him who sent
[1:32:27] it and he was dwelling in the midst
[1:32:29] because for him dwelling in the midst
[1:32:32] that he comes in the midst of you that
[1:32:37] junction that ties it together
[1:32:40] notice what he did boy he had a garment
[1:32:44] on and he casts that garment away that
[1:32:50] garment spoke of his condition that
[1:32:54] garment spoke he was a beggar where he
[1:32:58] said at spoke he was a beggar everything
[1:33:02] about him it spoke he was a beggar but
[1:33:06] when he was told to come and rise be of
[1:33:10] good comfort rise he calleth vm ma oh
[1:33:15] god help me drive this old man he was
[1:33:19] calling on Jesus he recognized him and
[1:33:23] the word spoke back and called him be of
[1:33:27] comfort and arise he was awake what I
[1:33:32] needed to arise and when he arose he
[1:33:36] can't stuff that garment he weren't
[1:33:38] gonna need that garment no more he
[1:33:40] wasn't gonna need that place that was
[1:33:42] not gonna be his become his pew his
[1:33:44] Bible was sitting there it had always
[1:33:46] been there and that's not no no no he
[1:33:48] didn't need that place no more he had
[1:33:51] fine
[1:33:51] the place what his heart had been long
[1:33:54] for and he cast aside that garment ain't
[1:33:59] gonna need that garment no more just
[1:34:02] like one of these days he will call in I
[1:34:04] shall answer and you and you and I ain't
[1:34:07] gonna need this garment no more
[1:34:09] [Music]
[1:34:10] hallelujah Lord that I may receive my
[1:34:15] sight what do you want that I might
[1:34:19] receive my sight and Jesus said go thy
[1:34:22] way and what's this
[1:34:25] he didn't spit up on the ground and put
[1:34:27] it upon his eyes he said well that's
[1:34:29] because he already had eyes that's true
[1:34:31] but notice what he's letting us know
[1:34:34] that in all things it is faith that
[1:34:38] brings it to past go thy way thy faith
[1:34:43] how does faith come by hearing the word
[1:34:48] of God go thy way thy faith hath made me
[1:34:52] help do you recognize he did not say
[1:34:55] because I touched you because I laid
[1:35:00] hands on you
[1:35:00] no no he didn't say that thy faith hath
[1:35:05] made thee whole
[1:35:06] what was it he just recognized God was
[1:35:10] present in Christ and at that moment he
[1:35:12] cried out and said this is my hour this
[1:35:15] is my moment this is my time and he
[1:35:20] acted upon it and threw everything else
[1:35:24] to the side it was high time it was high
[1:35:27] time that blind bartimaeus arose out of
[1:35:30] that and immediately he received his
[1:35:34] sight and followed Jesus in the way in
[1:35:38] their wonderful he received
[1:35:43] site you know listen he offered his lamb
[1:35:53] he offered his Turtledove but remember
[1:35:58] what that lamb was you know that's a
[1:36:00] dramatization the Prophet would give us
[1:36:02] remember what that lamb was that lamb
[1:36:04] was his eyes to get back home he needed
[1:36:09] eyes to get back home to see how do I
[1:36:12] get back home
[1:36:13] and you and I needed eyes to get back
[1:36:16] home our eyes were covered over with
[1:36:20] blindness filled with spiritual crusty
[1:36:24] matter you with me but God had provided
[1:36:28] a lamb and in that lamb is the life and
[1:36:33] that life
[1:36:35] coming up on the worshiper brings us
[1:36:39] from death unto life it brings us from
[1:36:43] worshipping around to worshiping in and
[1:36:47] that wonderful we're not worshipping
[1:36:49] around the revealed word we're
[1:36:52] worshipping in the revealed word
[1:36:55] hallelujah oh my how we thank God and we
[1:37:00] we are so grateful for all that God has
[1:37:02] done but we're not looking at it as
[1:37:04] history we recognize that what God did
[1:37:07] in the profit is what God does and is
[1:37:13] doing and will do in the believer now
[1:37:19] I'm not looking for another gift new I'm
[1:37:23] not looking for another gift all brother
[1:37:25] Samuel this man got I'm not looking for
[1:37:27] another gift there's a lot of gifts that
[1:37:30] can pop up there's a lot of things that
[1:37:32] can come along and get people God has
[1:37:37] sent a gift to a generation God has
[1:37:40] gifts in the body but not one gift is
[1:37:42] made to rally around the gift that God
[1:37:46] has given his church that were to rally
[1:37:48] around is Christ
[1:37:52] is that right you go to rallying around
[1:37:55] the gift God will show that that gift is
[1:37:58] indeed a gift from him and it's in side
[1:38:01] of humanity so we recognize we don't
[1:38:06] rally around the gift that God would
[1:38:09] place in a man we rally around Christ
[1:38:13] he's the one that we rally around you
[1:38:16] love him
[1:38:18] whatsoever the son see it the father
[1:38:20] doing that doeth the son likewise what a
[1:38:24] channel I'll tell you friends listen to
[1:38:28] me in this hour for our eyes to be open
[1:38:31] we're not making ourselves anything can
[1:38:33] you imagine look what they said
[1:38:34] concerning the Lord Jesus who do you
[1:38:36] think you are he made himself equal with
[1:38:40] God they who do you think you are they
[1:38:44] got upset with him because of him
[1:38:47] expressing unity with the father but
[1:38:53] remember it wasn't the people it was the
[1:38:55] spirit that was motivating them the same
[1:38:59] spirit that was upon Cain that motivated
[1:39:02] him the same spirit think of even how
[1:39:05] that Paul would even bring that forward
[1:39:07] in the book of Philippians then for us
[1:39:10] for you and I to be able to think it not
[1:39:12] robbery for to be able to say that I'm a
[1:39:15] believer I'm the son of God I'm a
[1:39:16] daughter of God I am one with Christ
[1:39:19] that's not robbery you're not taking
[1:39:22] away from him no it's releasing what he
[1:39:27] himself is now to be in you and through
[1:39:31] you you see it's recognizing the purpose
[1:39:36] the purpose of what it's all about
[1:39:41] to fail to recognize the person of Jesus
[1:39:45] Christ working in his many membered body
[1:39:47] now is to miss it but to recognize that
[1:39:52] it's Christ in you in me the hope of
[1:39:56] glory
[1:39:57] that's the purpose of the message coming
[1:40:01] and that is the working of the message
[1:40:04] now you with me remember it this the
[1:40:09] amount of a angel did not speak out and
[1:40:11] say as John the Baptist for run the
[1:40:14] Second Coming so shall you know it
[1:40:16] didn't say that
[1:40:17] it said so shall your message the
[1:40:23] message taking effect and flesh Christ
[1:40:27] in you and me is the declaration of the
[1:40:33] bride coming of Christ declares his
[1:40:36] coming to tie together he which was he
[1:40:41] that is he that is to come
[1:40:44] aren't you glad now remember he that is
[1:40:49] he'll still do James just like he did
[1:40:51] before and what he did before he'll do
[1:40:55] it again
[1:40:56] hallelujah for that which we see now has
[1:41:00] already been and that which has already
[1:41:02] been is now you love you let's pray Lord
[1:41:13] Jesus our hearts tremble father when we
[1:41:20] look upon these things Lord it's not Oh
[1:41:26] God
[1:41:27] with a slackness Oh Lord but father was
[1:41:32] seeing the awesomeness of the
[1:41:34] responsibility in this hour
[1:41:38] and Lord as we look at it in the word
[1:41:40] it's not about us making something
[1:41:44] happen it's us getting out of the way
[1:41:53] remaining in that channel of the word
[1:41:55] Lord as our brother Steven was here Lord
[1:41:59] last Thursday he was expressing that
[1:42:01] Lord the expressing of the word for that
[1:42:05] word Lord that coming to harvest it's a
[1:42:08] sewing again Lord sewing again word

[1:42:39] brotherly kindness we grow in faith we
[1:42:42] grow Oh God we see that even as your
[1:42:45] prophet himself would stand there Lord
[1:42:48] on that mountain that day and in the
[1:42:50] message on the wings of a snow white
[1:42:52] dove and speak concerning what you have
[1:42:55] done Lord God in the opening of the
[1:42:58] seals and the confirming and vindicating
[1:43:00] of your word Lord he said this has led
[1:43:03] me to a faith that I never had before
[1:43:06] Lord it's a growing a maturing and to
[1:43:11] recognize that that comes by experiences
[1:43:16] tests and trials that brings the word
[1:43:21] forth in expression in our lives

[1:56:05] [Music]
[1:56:15] you

[1:56:34] [Music]
[1:56:43] there is none there is
[1:56:53] no one else can touch a heart like you
[1:56:58] do
[1:56:59] [Music]
[1:57:01] like it's a
[1:57:07] [Music]
