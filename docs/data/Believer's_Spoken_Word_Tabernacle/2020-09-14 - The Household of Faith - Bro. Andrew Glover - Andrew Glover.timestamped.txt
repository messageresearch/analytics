[13:50] here I have to
[13:55] today no for a long time
[13:59] a l of you don't know
[14:01] this I was then going
[14:06] into due to my diabetic
[14:10] condition and things weren't looking too
[14:13] good my gfrs were constantly dropping
[14:16] dropping dropping dropping
[14:19] dropping and you
[14:22] know my family they were praying and all
[14:25] of them you know and incessantly and my
[14:30] doctor he was concerned my new doctor Dr
[14:34] Carbone he was very concerned and he was
[14:37] saying Tom you're going to have to see a
[14:38] nefrologist and go through all this and
[14:41] and
[14:43] usually uh when you're you start going
[14:46] in renal
[14:47] failure two things can happen neither
[14:49] one of them is good one of them you may
[14:51] have to go to dialysis and one of might
[14:53] not be able to put you on dialysis then
[14:55] you just
[14:56] die so you know the devil put that fear
[15:01] upon
[15:05] you and today I was sitting back there
[15:07] and listening to brother Glover preach
[15:10] he talk about that guardian
[15:13] angel that we all
[15:15] have and I thought back the times in my
[15:19] life where I needed that and it was
[15:22] always there for
[15:24] me God don't take you to a cliff and
[15:27] just drop you off
[15:29] he's there from birth to
[15:31] death and you can't leave until he's
[15:34] done with you
[15:36] amen so I've had this burden on my heart
[15:39] and and my heaviness of my chest and you
[15:42] I know from my medical experience I deal
[15:46] with Labs I know what gfrs are I know
[15:49] what Crea BUN levels are and all that
[15:53] and M didn't look good at all did not
[15:56] look good at all so he said I'm going
[15:58] have to send you in in for renal um
[16:00] ultrasound so I went in for the renal
[16:02] ultrasound I said well I'll get the bad
[16:05] news from it whenever he gets the
[16:07] results you know you always have that
[16:11] doubt but still yet there was just
[16:14] something deeper than the doubt that's
[16:16] inside of you you know that God he's not
[16:20] going to let you go until he's done with
[16:22] you
[16:23] Hallelujah so I went to his office and
[16:27] he said here's your Arenal results he
[16:31] said your kidneys are perfect you know
[16:34] everything looks good Hallelujah I said
[16:37] thank the Lord for that amen he said but
[16:41] your
[16:42] GFR your creatinine level your bun is
[16:46] way too high your gfrs are
[16:50] dropping he said that you're going have
[16:52] to drink more fluids and whatever you
[16:54] know and I thought well I going to do
[16:56] more than that cuz I know I've seen I
[16:59] I've had patients 17 years of nursing
[17:01] I've seen it go I've seen what happens
[17:04] to kidney
[17:07] patients so we went out to eat today and
[17:12] me and Brian the kids
[17:14] and I come
[17:16] back home and I was sitting or standing
[17:21] in the living room and all of a sudden I
[17:23] got a phone
[17:24] call I said who in the world be calling
[17:26] me at this time it was my doctor Dr
[17:30] carbon he said I I I need to talk to you
[17:33] I got something to tell you I said oh
[17:35] God you know your first impression is
[17:39] I'm a gner either he's going to tell me
[17:41] I'm going have to go to nephrologist and
[17:42] get on a uh dialysis or something
[17:45] because it goes so low they have to
[17:46] because your kidneys clean your blood
[17:49] and without your kidneys function you
[17:51] know you'll
[17:53] die
[17:55] so I went in the back room by sh with
[17:58] the doctor on the phone he said
[18:01] Tom he said you're GFR it was 42 when I
[18:04] went in the other day he said your gfrs
[18:08] are
[18:10] 55 I said well praise
[18:14] God I said you know doctor we're
[18:16] Christians and we go to church praise
[18:19] God and we believe in God hallelujah and
[18:21] we believe that he can
[18:23] heal and he said there is a higher power
[18:28] sir amen
[18:37] yes FR back Sister Rita sitting here
[18:41] she's fac oh you're going her now you
[18:43] got
[18:45] cancer cancer ain't nothing to God right
[18:49] amen Tom you got kidney failure kidney
[18:52] failure ain't nothing to God we're not
[18:54] going to leave here until he's done with
[18:56] us I just like I was telling Samuel
[18:59] Samuel was standing there and uh I no
[19:04] he's kind of fidgety I was playing my
[19:06] goodar all a sudden he looked over here
[19:08] he got I said oh God you going to tell
[19:11] me I got my B up too
[19:15] loud so he comes over there puts his
[19:18] hand on me said I want to pray for you
[19:21] and he he pray a sincere prayer prise
[19:24] Our God I'll never forget it thank you
[19:27] Lord
[19:30] and I believe it's through your your
[19:31] prayers my family I don't think anybody
[19:34] else knew about it but my family they
[19:35] have their nightly devotionals that
[19:37] always remember
[19:39] Grandpa Sam pray for me many a prayer
[19:43] and God honors prayer yes he does
[19:45] hallelujah and he honors Faith yes he
[19:48] does andall I believe that from here on
[19:52] out that uh it's going to get
[19:56] better Hallelujah very nothing
[20:00] impost for for Jesus Christ and I've
[20:02] noticed that I've lived 66 years I've
[20:05] seen a lot of Trials and tests and
[20:07] things but God has never let me down and
[20:09] he never
[20:10] will he promised me he'd be with me to
[20:12] the end hallall thank you so
[20:26] much this is is as Rosanne comes and
[20:28] gets ready amen and I believe they said
[20:31] that number that he talked about that
[20:33] number it's medically impossible for
[20:35] that number to go up because that means
[20:36] the kidneys is working better it's
[20:37] medically impossible for that number to
[20:39] go up unless God your
[20:42] [Applause]

[47:48] something was said this morning to bless
[47:49] you and to help you and to encourage you
[47:52] and just pray that your your faith was
[47:54] strengthened just have a simple thought
[47:57] here on my heart tonight and we the
[47:59] devil's battling our voice but by God's
[48:01] grace we'll we'll battle back amen
[48:04] hallelujah in the book of Galatians here
[48:06] the sixth chapter we want to read from
[48:08] the 10th verse and we sure want to say
[48:10] once again it's been an honor to be here
[48:11] with you this weekend and sure glad to
[48:13] have my wife here with me and we sure
[48:15] always enjoy coming up this way and
[48:17] seeing the Believers here and the Saints
[48:19] and I sure appreciate brother Samuel and
[48:21] his wife and family and their friendship
[48:23] and been privileged to do some meetings
[48:26] together with brother Samuel and then
[48:27] hallelujah this year everything just
[48:29] changed but God's still in control amen
[48:31] amen but we sure appreciate brother
[48:34] Samuel and his stand for the for the
[48:36] message and for the ministry and just
[48:37] thinking of all the camps we got to do
[48:40] together last year and just seeing the
[48:41] power of God move and working together I
[48:43] think that's what we're here to do is to
[48:45] defeat the Devil in every aspect that we
[48:47] can so we sure thank the Lord for his
[48:49] mercy and Grace here in the book of
[48:50] Galatians the 6th chapter I want to read
[48:53] from the 10th
[48:54] verse Paul here writing says as we have
[48:58] therefore
[48:59] opportunity let us do good unto all men
[49:03] especially unto them who are of the
[49:06] household of faith we have opportunity
[49:10] let us do good unto all men but
[49:12] especially unto them who were of the
[49:15] household of faith and then I'd like to
[49:18] look in the book of Ephesians the 2
[49:21] chapter Ephesians the 2 chapter and
[49:24] looking there in the 19th verse uh Paul
[49:27] writing again here in the letter to the
[49:30] Ephesians I was just studying the other
[49:32] day and heard brother B say Paul wrote
[49:34] the book of Romans and Galatians and
[49:36] Ephesians and all those books he said
[49:38] but to me he said Paul was not just
[49:40] writing to anybody he was writing to
[49:42] Believers and I think tonight we're here
[49:43] as Believers so in the 19th verse he
[49:46] says now therefore ye are no more
[49:48] strangers and foreigners but fellow
[49:51] citizens with the Saints and of the
[49:54] household of God and are built somebody
[49:58] shout built built and are built upon the
[50:00] foundation of the Apostles and Prophets
[50:03] Jesus Christ himself being the Chief
[50:06] Cornerstone notice here in whom all the
[50:08] building fitly framed together groweth
[50:11] unto a holy Temple in the Lord in whom
[50:14] ye also are builded together now you're
[50:17] not builded divided but you're builded
[50:19] together for a habitation of God through
[50:23] the spirit we ask Lord this evening to
[50:26] add the blessing to the reading of his
[50:28] word let's just bow our hearts together
[50:29] here and humble our Spirits in his
[50:31] presence and just ask him to speak to us
[50:33] tonight Heavenly Father Lord as your
[50:35] believing children have gathered here on
[50:37] this Sunday evening father Lord as I
[50:40] just walked into the sanctuary and just
[50:42] felt your presence moving through the
[50:43] building Lord I Thank you that we are
[50:46] here tonight I thank you that we're able
[50:48] Lord to still be able to feel your
[50:50] presence dear God lord as I was just
[50:52] reading the other day Lord where your
[50:54] Prophet said in sh report there in 1963
[50:57] he said the time will come when it'll be
[50:59] past time feeling and Lord past feeling
[51:02] time and Lord I think tonight of how
[51:04] that so many Lord have have gone beyond
[51:07] Lord the the message of the hour and
[51:08] they've gone beyond your word and
[51:10] they've went into things of
[51:11] intellectualism and all kinds of things
[51:13] Lord that have numbed them dear God but
[51:15] Lord I Thank you that there is a bride
[51:17] here on the earth tonight that when you
[51:19] begin to Lord move in the mberry bushes
[51:22] it was when you begin to Lord begin to
[51:24] move to the meeting we still are able to
[51:26] feel you and for that tonight God we're
[51:28] grateful and Lord I pray tonight God
[51:30] that you would just send a coal of fire
[51:31] up off the altar Lord may you strengthen
[51:34] our voice for this meeting tonight Lord
[51:36] may you not anoint me only to preach but
[51:38] may you anoint the people to pull and
[51:39] receive also and father I pray tonight
[51:42] God in this weekend of services Lord
[51:44] that you would just break through
[51:45] tonight for the people Lord may may you
[51:47] just come down father may they push
[51:49] through every tiredness every weariness
[51:51] oh God and Lord maybe they're looking
[51:53] for a blessing in these Services Maybe
[51:55] they're looking for an answer or a
[51:56] direction God I pray tonight in the name
[51:59] of Jesus Christ by The Same Spirit that
[52:01] raised my Lord from the dead May that
[52:04] same Spirit come in this building
[52:05] tonight and may it break every barrier
[52:08] may it break every wall may it tear down
[52:10] every veil of tradition and ritualism oh
[52:12] God and Lord May your children begin to
[52:14] feel the refreshing from the presence of
[52:17] God lord may you move in a mighty way
[52:19] Among Us and Lord whatever is
[52:20] accomplished in this service whether it
[52:22] be healing salvation Deliverance
[52:24] whatever would be oh God God we'll be
[52:26] sure to give you all the honor and all
[52:27] the praise and all the glory for it's in
[52:29] the wonderful name of our Lord and
[52:31] Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the
[52:33] Believers said amen amen amen and may
[52:36] God richly bless you this evening amen
[52:38] you love the Lord amen amen from those
[52:41] scriptures tonight if the Lord would
[52:42] help me for just a few moments tonight I
[52:44] would like to by the help of the Lord
[52:46] maybe speak to here and if I would title
[52:48] this tonight I want to speak to you on
[52:50] uh the household of faith the household
[52:54] of faith and I I believe that we're
[52:55] living in a very Troublesome time
[52:58] believe we're living in a time of
[52:59] turmoil I believe we're living in a time
[53:01] of chaos and confusion and I believe
[53:03] we're living in a time of attack I
[53:05] believe that the devil prophet of God
[53:07] would say is attacking from every
[53:09] direction every angle every every place
[53:11] the devil can find the area to get in
[53:13] and attack the devil will take that area
[53:15] to attack the Church of the Living God
[53:17] and I believe it's not necessarily an
[53:19] attack on our Doctrine I don't believe
[53:21] it's necessarily an attack maybe on our
[53:23] church building or where we stand uh
[53:25] maybe the things that we believe but I
[53:27] believe it's an attack on our faith I I
[53:29] I really believe that the devil is
[53:31] Desiring amen Satan is Desiring uh for
[53:34] the church to forget and begin to fear
[53:37] amen now the devil has desires as well
[53:39] as God has desires and brother said this
[53:41] way or rather paraphrasing here Satan is
[53:44] Desiring the church to forget and to
[53:46] fear but I believe at the same time amen
[53:49] that God is Desiring the church to
[53:51] remember amen and believe so Satan is
[53:54] Desiring the Church to forget and fear
[53:57] God is Desiring the church to remember
[53:59] and believe brother man would say here
[54:01] and letting off the pressure oh how
[54:03] Satan would desire to take us quickly
[54:06] amen from the scene right in the midst
[54:08] of the battle amen Satan's desire is to
[54:11] take us out of the battle his desire is
[54:14] to take us out of the fight now let me
[54:16] just say it this way not necessarily
[54:18] just to take us out of the fight amen
[54:20] but to take the fight out of us amen
[54:22] that we would lose our desire to fight
[54:24] we would we would lose our our Zeal to
[54:26] go forward we would become amen
[54:28] complacent we would become formal we
[54:31] would become lukor and just stay with at
[54:33] but if we're going to get anywhere amen
[54:35] then we've got to be willing to fight
[54:36] now we cannot forget that and I I think
[54:39] it's amazing how that Satan desires amen
[54:41] for us to forget and fear but God
[54:43] desires for us to remember and believe
[54:45] and if you actually studying science uh
[54:48] any any time you'll find that science
[54:50] has proved that there is a connection
[54:52] between fear and memory there is
[54:54] actually a direct connection nection
[54:55] amen that when somebody begins to stress
[54:58] when they begin to have anxiety when
[55:00] they begin to fear or they begin to
[55:02] become depressed that it can actually
[55:04] cause forgetfulness amen amen it can
[55:06] cause confusion it can it can cause
[55:09] difficulty on concentrating amen and
[55:11] other problems that disrupt daily
[55:13] activities or it can remove them from
[55:15] doing what they should do Amen to doing
[55:18] what they wouldn't normally do fear is a
[55:20] powerful force amen amen fear can come
[55:22] in and if fear grips a church amen it if
[55:25] it grips a pull pit it'll grip the pews
[55:27] if it grips the pews it'll grip the amen
[55:29] the music fear has a power of gripping
[55:32] amen but I don't think we've come here
[55:33] tonight to fear the devil amen I don't
[55:35] think we've come here to fear what the
[55:37] devil can do to us amen but I believe
[55:39] we've come here tonight because we
[55:41] remember who we are amen amen we
[55:43] remember who we are amen I think it's
[55:45] amazing how that you would you would
[55:47] begin to look at how Satan desires the
[55:49] church or the children of God to begin
[55:51] to fear amen and begin to forget now you
[55:53] would Sayer why would Satan uh desire
[55:56] for the children of God to forget and
[55:58] fear in the message the kinsman redeemer
[56:00] he says who has the most power before
[56:02] God Amen what is an angel an angel is a
[56:05] servant is that right amen they are his
[56:07] servants but what are you amen you are
[56:09] his sons and daughters and who has amen
[56:12] the most power in heaven a sinner that's
[56:15] been saved by grace or an archangel
[56:17] that's standing by his right side he
[56:19] said the sinner that's been saved by
[56:22] grace has more Authority in heaven than
[56:25] the Archangel that has stood by his side
[56:27] without sin because he is a son amen and
[56:30] a son has more Authority than a servant
[56:32] of course amen oh he says we forget what
[56:36] we are amen we forget many times what
[56:38] made us what we are and after we become
[56:41] what we are then we forgot how we got
[56:43] here amen we forget what we are we
[56:46] forget many times what made us what we
[56:48] are and after we become what we are then
[56:50] we forget what God is here I just want
[56:53] to stop here for a second and say amen
[56:55] that the Church of the Living God and
[56:57] the Bride of Jesus Christ did not get to
[56:59] where she's at tonight amen by fear amen
[57:03] but we got here by faith amen we didn't
[57:05] get here by amen by depression or by
[57:07] anxiety or by by by by nervousness but
[57:10] we come to this place by faith amen and
[57:13] I think if faith has brought us this far
[57:15] amen then faith will take us the rest of
[57:17] the
[57:18] way amen now there is a reason then why
[57:21] Satan amen wants us to forget our faith
[57:23] brother R would say now faith is a law
[57:25] of God see the same thing all this power
[57:28] of God that we're talking about is
[57:31] accessible To Us by faith all things are
[57:35] possible if you say to this mountain be
[57:37] moved and don't doubt in your heart but
[57:39] you believe what you said come to pass
[57:41] you can have it see it's accessible to
[57:43] you if you've got the law there it is
[57:46] see the law is faith that controls all
[57:49] things amen now fear does not open the
[57:52] power of God Amen fear does not open the
[57:54] Supernatural amen fear does not open the
[57:57] power of God to deliver an individual
[57:59] amen but faith is the law of God that
[58:02] opens all the blessings of God to the
[58:05] church then Satan's greatest fear amen
[58:08] is the church what access amen the power
[58:11] of God Amen the prophet of God said
[58:13] Christ in the true church is a
[58:15] continuation of the book of Acts he
[58:18] knows that if the people get the true
[58:19] revelation of the true church and what
[58:21] she is and what she stands for and that
[58:24] can do the Greater Works then she will
[58:27] be an invincible Army amen he if they
[58:30] get a true revelation of the two Spirits
[58:32] within the framework of the Christian
[58:34] church and by God's spirit discern and
[58:36] withstand the Antichrist spirit amen
[58:39] then Satan will be powerless before her
[58:42] amen somebody shout Satan will be
[58:45] powerless before her amen he will be as
[58:48] definitely thed which means prevented
[58:50] today as when Christ with stood his
[58:53] every effort Amen to gained power over
[58:55] him in the desert yes Satan hates
[58:57] Revelation but we love it amen because
[59:00] with true Revelation in our lives amen
[59:02] we will prevail over the Gates of Hell
[59:06] amen now remember Satan wants the church
[59:08] amen to forget who they are can you say
[59:11] amen amen Satan wants the church to
[59:13] forget amen what made her what she is
[59:16] amen Satan wants the church to forget
[59:19] amen who called her and who ordained her
[59:20] and who elected her amen he wants you to
[59:22] forget that amen because if you remember
[59:25] that amen and by faith you begin to
[59:28] believe that amen then you can access
[59:30] the power of God Amen but let me tell
[59:32] you why Satan wants you to forget it
[59:34] amen is because he remembers amen what
[59:37] happened before when the church got a
[59:39] hold of the power of God Amen he
[59:41] remembers Amen in Luke the 10th chapter
[59:44] amen the 70 returned again with joy amen
[59:47] saying Lord even the devils are subject
[59:49] unto us through thy name and he said
[59:51] unto them I beheld Satan amen as
[59:53] lightning fall from heaven and he said
[59:55] behold I give unto you power Amen to
[59:58] tread upon serpents and upon scorpions
[1:00:01] and over all the power of the enemy and
[1:00:03] nothing shall by any means hurt you amen
[1:00:06] the prophet said that was immediately
[1:00:08] after that Jesus give his disciples
[1:00:10] power amen over unclean spirits and he
[1:00:13] said I beheld Satan fall amen from
[1:00:15] heaven like lightning now what amazes me
[1:00:17] is the disciples went out amen and they
[1:00:20] begin to access the power of God they
[1:00:22] begin to manifest The Works of God they
[1:00:24] begin to see demons becoming subject
[1:00:27] Amen to them when they would speak the
[1:00:29] name of Jesus and it released such a joy
[1:00:31] in them amen it released such a power in
[1:00:33] them that they come running back to
[1:00:35] Jesus and said Jesus let me tell you
[1:00:37] what happened he said but before it
[1:00:39] happened amen while you were doing it
[1:00:42] amen I saw Satan fall from Heaven like
[1:00:44] lightning amen but watch here he said
[1:00:47] see the power of that church moving
[1:00:49] forward had upset the whole Kingdom of
[1:00:53] Satan you see and he saw him as he
[1:00:57] dropped from his places because God had
[1:00:59] given again amen power to his church
[1:01:02] amen he was cast Plum out of the holy
[1:01:04] places and everything you see by the
[1:01:07] power amen of that church of them having
[1:01:10] Power and Jesus said I give you power
[1:01:13] over unclean spirits amen and they
[1:01:15] really upset the kingdom of Satan oh I
[1:01:18] love this then what could we do with it
[1:01:22] today the power of God amen work then
[1:01:26] then what can we do today as the Church
[1:01:28] of the Living God with the power of God
[1:01:30] Amen I'll say it this way Satan he is
[1:01:33] not so much afraid of just the ministry
[1:01:36] accessing the power of God Amen he is
[1:01:38] not just afraid amen of a prophet
[1:01:40] accessing the power of God Amen he is
[1:01:43] not afraid of your pastor accessing the
[1:01:45] power of God he is not afraid of a
[1:01:47] deacon amen accessing the power of God
[1:01:50] but he does not want the Ley Amen to
[1:01:53] realize this is more amen than just a
[1:01:56] Ministry of power this is more than just
[1:01:58] a propit of power amen but this is a
[1:02:01] body of power that the same power that
[1:02:03] is in the head amen has come into the
[1:02:06] body and if the head defeated the devil
[1:02:09] then there's a body on the earth that's
[1:02:11] going to defeat the Devil as well oh
[1:02:13] church I tell you that power is not a
[1:02:15] million miles away that power is right
[1:02:18] here in this building tonight there is
[1:02:20] enough power in this church that if one
[1:02:22] housewife amen if one father if one
[1:02:25] young person would reach up right now by
[1:02:28] faith and get a hold of that power
[1:02:30] you've got the power tonight amen to
[1:02:32] defeat every demon out of hell you've
[1:02:35] got the power tonight amen to overcome
[1:02:38] every symptom of whatever sickness of
[1:02:40] doctor a might have told you you had hey
[1:02:43] I'm not talking about a weak church I'm
[1:02:45] not talking about a powerless church I'm
[1:02:48] talking about a church amen that is in
[1:02:50] touch with
[1:02:52] God he do not want to lay it
[1:02:54] to access the power of God if you look
[1:02:57] at Luke 24 the Bible said ter ye until
[1:03:00] you be ued with what power from on high
[1:03:04] in the book of Acts chapter one he said
[1:03:06] you shall receive what power in Acts
[1:03:08] chapter 2 amen the power came amen upon
[1:03:12] 120 seeds amen who hauled themselves in
[1:03:15] the upper room amen but God was not just
[1:03:18] wanting Amen to manifest his power in
[1:03:21] the apostles he was not just wanting to
[1:03:23] manifest his power
[1:03:24] Amen in Mary and those that was in the
[1:03:26] upper room amen but in Acts chapter 3
[1:03:29] amen there were two preachers with that
[1:03:31] power amen that come out of the upper
[1:03:33] room amen and they went walking by the
[1:03:35] gate called beautiful and they found a
[1:03:37] man that had been laying there for many
[1:03:39] years amen and now the power of God that
[1:03:42] was in those preachers amen went into
[1:03:44] that man and the Bible said Peter said
[1:03:47] silver and gold amen Have I None but
[1:03:50] such as I have give I Thee in the name
[1:03:53] of Jesus Christ rise up and walk and the
[1:03:56] Bible says immediately amen immediately
[1:03:59] there was strength that went into his
[1:04:00] feet into his ankle bones and he stood
[1:04:03] up the prophet of God said that never
[1:04:06] amen the sermon the de or that Peter
[1:04:08] then preached on the day of Pentecost
[1:04:10] and 3,000 Souls were added that never
[1:04:12] shook the devil's Kingdom he said he
[1:04:14] never as much as even got out of bed he
[1:04:16] said because he knew that if they were
[1:04:18] just preaching it if they were just
[1:04:20] talking about it amen then there was
[1:04:22] nothing to worry about he said but when
[1:04:24] that man got up he said the devil roll
[1:04:27] over in his bed and said now amen
[1:04:30] there's somebody else got that power and
[1:04:32] I don't know about you tonight amen but
[1:04:34] I believe what a prophet of God said
[1:04:36] when he said the pillar of fire amen
[1:04:38] came in the upper room and it began to
[1:04:40] break apart and a liquid in there and a
[1:04:43] liquid in there and he said when we come
[1:04:45] together amen the pillar of fire amen
[1:04:48] comes back together in the fullness of
[1:04:50] its power church I don't know about you
[1:04:52] tonight amen but we we are not fooled we
[1:04:55] are not fooled by theology we are not
[1:04:57] fooled by personalities amen because
[1:05:00] we've done seen the real thing and when
[1:05:02] you see the real thing then the false
[1:05:05] can't fool you and the caral
[1:05:06] impersonation can't fool you when you
[1:05:08] see amen the power of God Amen come down
[1:05:12] in the church and manifest itself as
[1:05:15] only God can do it will not fool a real
[1:05:19] believer yes sir there is there is a
[1:05:21] real genuine amen baptism of the holy
[1:05:24] spirit that brings the same results amen
[1:05:27] that they got on the day of Pentecost
[1:05:29] amen that I think when we begin to hear
[1:05:31] these things what we need to do amen is
[1:05:33] we need to sharpen amen our spiritual
[1:05:35] memory in second Peter chap 3:1 the
[1:05:39] Bible said this Second Epistle beloved I
[1:05:41] now write unto you in both which I stir
[1:05:44] up your pure Minds by the way of
[1:05:45] remembrance that you may be mindful of
[1:05:48] The Words which were spoken before by
[1:05:50] the holy prophets amen and of the
[1:05:52] Commandment of us as the apostles of the
[1:05:54] Lord and Savior amen how many can say
[1:05:56] that we all need reminders amen from
[1:05:59] time to
[1:06:00] time amen we all need reminders now I
[1:06:03] believe that we need reminders
[1:06:04] especially in the present hour we're now
[1:06:07] living in amen I think we need to be
[1:06:09] reminded sometimes of who we are amen of
[1:06:12] whose we are and of where we are going
[1:06:15] amen amen remember tonight who you are
[1:06:18] amen you are the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:06:21] amen remember whose you are you belong
[1:06:23] to the Lord Jesus Christ then don't
[1:06:25] forget where you're going amen you're
[1:06:28] going in the Rapture amen see those
[1:06:30] reminders amen actually refresh our
[1:06:33] spiritual memory I think of how in the
[1:06:35] Bible amen it says we should call to
[1:06:37] mind these things how in like
[1:06:38] Deuteronomy 32 and S we should call to
[1:06:41] mind amen the past mercies of God he
[1:06:44] says remember the days of old and
[1:06:47] consider the years of many generations
[1:06:49] ask the father and he will show thee thy
[1:06:51] elders and they will tell thee amen I
[1:06:54] believe tonight amen I'm just going to
[1:06:56] preach here for a minute that we need
[1:06:57] some young people amen that can remember
[1:07:00] God if this thing should car 15 more
[1:07:03] years if it should car 20 more years I
[1:07:06] think we need some young men that can
[1:07:08] raise up and say I remember how the
[1:07:10] power of God would fall in the church I
[1:07:12] think we need some young ladies that can
[1:07:14] raise up and say I remember how that God
[1:07:17] moved in the church amen I think we need
[1:07:20] some people that can remember these
[1:07:22] things and can pass it down from
[1:07:24] generation to generation amen I think we
[1:07:26] need to remember amen the wonderful
[1:07:28] works of God when you see God do
[1:07:30] something it's not something to take
[1:07:32] lightly it's something that you should
[1:07:34] you should etch it in your mind amen you
[1:07:37] should write it upon your heart for
[1:07:39] David said I will remember the works of
[1:07:40] the Lord surely I will remember thy
[1:07:42] wonders of old I will meditate also of
[1:07:45] all thy works and talk of all thy doings
[1:07:47] I think we need to call to mind amen
[1:07:50] that though we are surrounded by all
[1:07:51] kinds of negativity amen though we are
[1:07:53] sured by all kinds of trouble amen that
[1:07:56] the Lord is still a deliverer Amen in
[1:07:59] Jonah 2:7 he said when my soul faint
[1:08:02] within me I remember the Lord and my my
[1:08:05] prayer came unto him amen into the in
[1:08:07] thy Holy Temple I think we need to
[1:08:09] remember amen the death of Christ how
[1:08:12] that amen after this manner he took the
[1:08:14] cup and and the cup is the New Testament
[1:08:16] in my blood this D is y as you drink and
[1:08:19] remember to me I think we need to be
[1:08:20] reminded amen of what the blood done for
[1:08:23] us I think we need to be reminded amen
[1:08:25] of what Calvary really was amen for as
[1:08:28] often as you eat this bread and you
[1:08:29] drink this cup amen you do show forth
[1:08:32] the Lord's death until he come amen I
[1:08:34] think when we begin to remember these
[1:08:36] things when we begin to call to mind the
[1:08:38] past mercies of God when we begin to
[1:08:40] call to mind amen how that God Amen
[1:08:43] delivered Jonah and how that God Amen
[1:08:46] delivered all those before us I believe
[1:08:48] when we begin to renew our spiritual
[1:08:50] memory then it begins to bring a joy to
[1:08:52] us how that David would say my soul
[1:08:54] shall be satisfied as with tomorrow in
[1:08:57] fatness and my mouth shall praise thee
[1:08:59] with joyful lips when I remember thee
[1:09:01] upon my bed and meditate on me in the
[1:09:03] night watches amen see when David begin
[1:09:06] to remember amen David begin to get
[1:09:08] happy amen when David begin to remember
[1:09:11] amen David begin to shout he begin to
[1:09:14] rejoice and the prophet said oh my don't
[1:09:16] think I'm excited I know where I am no
[1:09:19] it's just feels good when I get to
[1:09:21] thinking about that amen see there is
[1:09:24] one among us see that's what I'm trying
[1:09:27] to tell you tonight is you've got to
[1:09:28] remember friends that God has not left
[1:09:31] us he is still with us he is still for
[1:09:34] us he is still in us he is still behind
[1:09:37] us oh somebody shout there is one Among
[1:09:40] Us amen there is one Among Us who is
[1:09:43] among us tonight it's not the president
[1:09:46] it's not the governor it's Jesus Christ
[1:09:49] amen the Son of God and I think of is
[1:09:51] here tonight we ought to do everything
[1:09:54] our power Amen to make him
[1:09:58] welcome we ought to make it welcome amen
[1:10:01] I tell you like a prophet of God said he
[1:10:02] said see what's wrong is you don't
[1:10:04] realize who's here he said you don't
[1:10:06] realize who's knocking on your door he
[1:10:08] said you don't realize who's trying to
[1:10:10] get in he said let me take a minute and
[1:10:12] tell you who it is it's the king of
[1:10:15] glory it's the Mighty God it's Elohim
[1:10:18] it's MDC that made Abraham he said it's
[1:10:21] the God Amen that healed blind
[1:10:24] it's the god that raised Lazarus from
[1:10:26] the dead it's the God Amen that walked
[1:10:29] on water it's the god that opened the
[1:10:31] eyes the that God has come down here
[1:10:34] tonight and he's not come here to bind
[1:10:36] you he has come here to loose you oh I
[1:10:38] think tonight church we ought to just
[1:10:40] take a minute and just start praising
[1:10:43] God Amen and let him know we remember
[1:10:46] him we remember what he done for us we
[1:10:49] remember where he brought us done we
[1:10:51] remember amen the snares that he kept us
[1:10:54] out of we remember the traps that he
[1:10:57] took us away from church when we begin
[1:10:59] to remember these things then there
[1:11:01] becomes a faith in the church amen we
[1:11:03] remember how God healed one brother amen
[1:11:06] we remember how God healed one sister
[1:11:09] and when we begin to remember amen that
[1:11:11] it begins to cause Faith Amen to begin
[1:11:14] to chug on the inside of your soul and
[1:11:16] somebody stands up and says if he did it
[1:11:19] one time he can do it
[1:11:22] again I don't know about y'all tonight
[1:11:25] but I'm feeling one of them oldfashioned
[1:11:27] amen St Paul revivals and the Bible hold
[1:11:30] I don't know about y'all but I'm feeling
[1:11:32] amen them oldfashioned amen devil
[1:11:35] stomping sin chasing amen Holy Ghost
[1:11:38] fill meetings when people just let go
[1:11:41] and let God have his way and they
[1:11:43] remember what God done for oh brother
[1:11:46] Andrew he ain't done nothing for me I
[1:11:48] can't remember nothing amen yes you can
[1:11:51] he woke you up this morning
[1:11:55] he's kept you another day in Satan's
[1:11:57] Eden in your right mind that's enough to
[1:12:00] praise God for oh come on church amen he
[1:12:04] deserves Our Praise when he begins to be
[1:12:07] praised then blessings begin to come
[1:12:10] down oh we need to be reminded who we
[1:12:13] are we need to be reminded who we are we
[1:12:16] need to be reminded of where we're going
[1:12:18] amen I thank you how the Bible says amen
[1:12:20] how that the comforter which is the Holy
[1:12:22] Ghost whom the father will send in my
[1:12:25] name he shall teach you all things and
[1:12:27] bring all things amen somebody shout all
[1:12:30] things all to your remembrance amen who
[1:12:34] whatsoever I have said unto you amen now
[1:12:37] how many knows that it's good to get
[1:12:38] those reminders we live in a day and
[1:12:41] time where you got to have a reminder
[1:12:43] amen I think of how just a few days ago
[1:12:45] a brother in our church he actually sent
[1:12:47] a reminder out just a just a little text
[1:12:50] on his
[1:12:51] heart and he said this he said you know
[1:12:54] just to some brothers in our church he
[1:12:55] said you know as the head of your
[1:12:57] household you can literally place the
[1:12:59] token over your wife and kids while
[1:13:02] everyone is growing weary and they're
[1:13:04] feeding off of media us as a head amen
[1:13:07] can place the blood over our loved ones
[1:13:09] and keep them covered we've heard this
[1:13:12] he said but it became so real to me
[1:13:14] while praying over my family this
[1:13:16] morning while they slept it's our duty
[1:13:18] as men but it's also our privilege and
[1:13:21] brother Samuel when I heard that word
[1:13:23] household I begin to think what is a
[1:13:25] household amen a household is of one's
[1:13:28] own house amen belonging to a house amen
[1:13:31] a family domestic domestic or or
[1:13:34] intimate belonging to one's household it
[1:13:36] means to be related by blood amen it
[1:13:39] means to be the adherence to it means to
[1:13:42] be devoted to in Deuteronomy 16:5 thou
[1:13:45] mayest not sacrifice the Passover within
[1:13:48] any of the gates which the Lord thy God
[1:13:50] giveth thee but at the place which the
[1:13:52] Lord thy God shall choose to place his
[1:13:55] name amen see where thou shalt sacrifice
[1:13:57] the Passover at evening at the going
[1:14:00] down of the Sun at the season thou
[1:14:03] camest forth out of Egypt amen Paul
[1:14:05] would say it this way amen for by one
[1:14:07] Spirit are you with me
[1:14:08] tonight for by one Spirit are we all
[1:14:11] baptized into one body whether we be
[1:14:14] Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or
[1:14:16] free and have been all made to drink
[1:14:18] into one spirit amen the prophet picks
[1:14:21] this up and says 1 Corinthians 12 says

[1:17:08] substance of things hoped for it's the
[1:17:10] evidence of Things Not Seen amen what
[1:17:12] does that word substance mean it means
[1:17:14] foundation in Hebrews 3:14 for we are

[1:17:20] beginning of our confidence amen
[1:17:22] steadfast unto the end in the stature of
[1:17:25] a perfect man he said see faith is the
[1:17:27] foundation of it all and when you're a
[1:17:29] skeptic of the Bible when you're a
[1:17:31] skeptic of the word being right you
[1:17:33] might as well just stay back until first
[1:17:35] you believe
[1:17:36] it he says what is sin it's unbelief
[1:17:40] there's only two elements that controls
[1:17:42] the human being that's either doubt or
[1:17:44] faith one or the other see you are
[1:17:47] possessed of one that dominates your
[1:17:50] life and just depends on how much Faith
[1:17:53] you have is how high you can rise see
[1:17:56] then faith is the key to go higher amen
[1:17:59] fear is the key to go lower amen faith
[1:18:01] is the key Amen to rise into Heavenly
[1:18:04] places amen but fear is the key to go
[1:18:07] into depression and to go into anxiety
[1:18:10] oh faith and doubt will not mix together
[1:18:12] and neither will fear and faith mix
[1:18:15] together amen the pro of God said that
[1:18:17] the fall in the garden produced a hybrid
[1:18:19] Faith amen what is a hybrid Faith it'll
[1:18:22] take what a man says and it'll mix it
[1:18:24] with what God says he said that's what
[1:18:26] the church has got today amen the
[1:18:28] so-called church is a hybrid Faith amen
[1:18:31] it's mixed with fears it's mixed with
[1:18:33] doubts it's mixed with frustrations if
[1:18:36] it was genuine faith it wouldn't move
[1:18:38] I'll tell you tonight friends amen the
[1:18:40] reason I'm going to preach here for a
[1:18:41] second amen the reason why we got
[1:18:44] message preachers around this message
[1:18:46] amen pointing people amen the
[1:18:48] psychologist is because they're not of
[1:18:50] the household of faith amen the reason
[1:18:52] why this message amen we've got people
[1:18:54] pointing alcoholics amen the Alcoholics
[1:18:57] Anonymous is because they have left the
[1:18:59] household of faith amen the reason why
[1:19:02] we got young people that can't get
[1:19:03] victory over pornography and they're
[1:19:05] told to go through this rehab and go
[1:19:08] through this rehab is because we' mixed
[1:19:10] the word of God with a bunch of fear
[1:19:12] that it won't work but in the name of
[1:19:14] Jesus Christ I condemn every fear I cast
[1:19:17] every fear away and I invite the faith
[1:19:20] of the Son of God to come in this church

[1:20:14] will take you away from
[1:20:16] it he said a hybrid Faith amen makes a
[1:20:19] beautiful church but it's a dead church

[1:20:33] Saints amen then we are not contending
[1:20:36] amen for a church Faith we are not

[1:20:41] tonight we are contending for the
[1:20:44] unadulterated Faith amen let me tell you
[1:20:47] who amen made possible Hebrews 11 was
[1:20:50] the faith of God it was not a hbri faith
[1:20:53] it was not a man-made faith it was the
[1:20:56] unadulterated Faith what does the word
[1:20:59] unadulterated mean it means not mixed or
[1:21:02] diluted with any different or extra
[1:21:03] elements it is complete and absolute
[1:21:06] having no inferior added substance it is
[1:21:10] pure amen then I tell you tonight what
[1:21:13] we need is a pure message and that's
[1:21:15] what we got what we need is a pure
[1:21:17] pulpit and that's what we got what we
[1:21:19] need is some pure pews and that's what
[1:21:22] we got I tell you tonight if you're
[1:21:24] trying to mix this and mix that and mix
[1:21:26] this and mix that Amen to make a way of
[1:21:28] Deliverance you're wasting your time we
[1:21:31] have already got a way of Deliverance
[1:21:33] it's through the unadulterated faith of
[1:21:35] Jesus

[1:21:44] you see him come down and manifest
[1:21:47] himself just exactly like he did in the
[1:21:49] days gone by then you should have all
[1:21:52] together amen pure unadulterated faith
[1:21:54] in him and accept him on those real
[1:21:57] grounds amen can I take a few moments
[1:21:59] and tell you tonight what real
[1:22:00] unadulterated faith is it is taking God
[1:22:03] at his word regardless of what man says
[1:22:06] it is believing God in the eye of the
[1:22:09] storm it is raising your hands and
[1:22:11] praising him when you don't have no
[1:22:13] other reason to praise him it is coming
[1:22:15] to church when you've got every excuse
[1:22:17] to stay home it is shouting when you've
[1:22:20] got every excuse to sit there come on
[1:22:22] church I'm not talking about a hybrid
[1:22:25] faith I'm talking about the faith of God

[1:22:48] the reason we are gathering amen the
[1:22:50] prophet would say A True Believer is
[1:22:52] soundly solid based on Christ and
[1:22:54] there's nothing will shake him but
[1:22:56] because it's you're waving and pulling
[1:22:58] off to one side that's the reason you

[1:24:16] death in there even sickness can't stay
[1:24:18] in his presence if Satan then puts his
[1:24:21] hands to you and tres to tempt you into
[1:24:23] something you just hold your token in
[1:24:25] your hand and show it that you are a
[1:24:28] redeemed product of Jesus Christ amen he

[1:25:29] of Faith amen the prophet of God says
[1:25:31] there are two elements that controls the
[1:25:33] entire human race in the world and one
[1:25:36] of them is fear and the other is Faith

[1:26:06] the next day they say don't when one day
[1:26:08] they say go here and the next day they
[1:26:10] say don't and that fear is gripping the
[1:26:13] minds of people to where they're not
[1:26:14] acting like humans where they're scared
[1:26:16] to come out of their houses where
[1:26:18] they're scared to be around people where

[1:39:26] that when they come in the presence of
[1:39:28] God Amen the devil come also amen but my
[1:39:31] Bible says that job be to fear in job
[1:39:34] 3:25 for the thing which I greatly

[1:39:39] was afraid of is come unto
[1:39:41] me in the book of Jo is this okay in the
[1:39:45] Book of Job it says here job feared and
[1:39:47] what he feared is actually what happened
[1:39:49] what he brought is fear amen his faith
[1:39:51] would have kept it from him but his fear
[1:39:54] brought it to him job had a fear that
[1:39:57] these things would come upon him and
[1:39:59] they did if you have a fear that your
[1:40:01] disease won't leave you it won't but if
[1:40:04] you have faith it will see then fear
[1:40:08] brings it to you fear is the vehicle
[1:40:11] that brings the disease to you amen but
[1:40:13] faith is the Chariot of God that takes
[1:40:16] it
[1:40:18] away are you hearing me tonight amen the
[1:40:21] problem of God said looking at Peter how

[1:40:38] waves was and he got scared and when he
[1:40:40] did down he went what he feared happened

[1:40:54] perfect Faith

[1:41:23] because Satan does not want us to see
[1:41:26] the works of God Amen for the works of
[1:41:28] God was made manifest that the that that
[1:41:31] the works of the devil might be
[1:41:32] destroyed in the book of First Peter

[2:02:47] possible
[2:02:50] picked up that slingshot and he began to
[2:02:52] sling it and he looked down there and he
[2:02:54] looked at Goliath and Goliath squared
[2:02:56] his shoulders back and he said he ye

[2:04:38] David oh but I thank God for a
[2:04:42] prophet cuz I wondered for a long time

[2:05:09] this if you don't like me shouting just
[2:05:12] watch
[2:05:17] this
[2:05:19] hallah I didn't know but I went right on
[2:05:22] over there and I said you know what I
[2:05:23] said there was a man one time who got in
[2:05:26] an
[2:05:27] addict and the whole time this brother's
[2:05:29] just sitting there looking at me I mean
[2:05:30] he's just sitting there he's looking at
[2:05:32] me in the meantime brother Samuel his
[2:05:33] wife's over there dancing carrying on
[2:05:35] the Pew but he's just sitting there
[2:05:36] looking at
[2:05:39] me but I was on a I was on I was on a
[2:05:41] rap trail and I wasn't going to stop
[2:05:42] till I got
[2:05:45] it I said you know what you may have a
[2:05:48] lot of condemnation on you but there was
[2:05:51] a man one time that got a hold of a
[2:05:52] geography book in the
[2:05:54] [Applause]
[2:05:58] attic and he begin to read about the sea
[2:06:01] and he be to read about how they hadn't
[2:06:03] found the bottom of the sea and that old
[2:06:05] sophisticated Church down there be to
[2:06:08] hear him stomp on the ground and the
[2:06:10] prophet God said his daughter ran up
[2:06:11] there and said Daddy what's wrong with
[2:06:13] you he said honey I don't have a Bible
[2:06:15] but I got a geography book and I was
[2:06:17] reading in the graphy book about how
[2:06:20] they've yet to find the bottom of the
[2:06:21] sea oh glory to God and I begin to think
[2:06:23] about how that my Bible said that Jesus
[2:06:26] thre my
[2:06:29] [Applause]
[2:06:30] sins in the sea of forgetfulness she
[2:06:33] said then what do you shouting about he
[2:06:35] said because that tells me that they
[2:06:37] can't find the bottom of the sea so my
[2:06:40] sins are still
[2:06:47] falling
[2:06:49] my sins are still
[2:06:51] fallen and when I said that brother it
[2:06:54] was like a like a lightning Bol hit him
[2:06:56] I said but while your sins are still
[2:06:58] falling there's a power here to rise to
[2:07:01] lift you up and to reveal to you you
[2:07:03] never done it in the first place brother

[2:07:15] laps around well I got to be honest with
[2:07:16] you I got carried away with him and when
[2:07:18] I turned around he was gone I didn't see
[2:07:21] him I thought my God Enoch just left
[2:07:24] here he was gone brother and about that
[2:07:27] time I looked and there was about four
[2:07:29] deacons running out the
[2:07:31] door he ran out the door on the church
[2:07:35] parking lot and they ran out there to
[2:07:37] make sure he was so drunk he didn't run
[2:07:39] in the road but he was out there
[2:07:42] dancing in the message
