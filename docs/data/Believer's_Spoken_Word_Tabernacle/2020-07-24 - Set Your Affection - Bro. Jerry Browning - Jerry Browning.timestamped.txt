[32:42] [Music]
[32:55] amen praise the lord
[32:58] good to be here tonight with you
[33:02] just like to would you stand please
[33:07] lord in prayer before we turn to the
[33:08] scriptures
[33:15] heavenly father we come before you
[33:18] tonight and we're asking father for you
[33:20] to come and speak to us lord from your
[33:22] word
[33:24] lord you know the needs of each and
[33:26] every one here tonight
[33:27] i pray lord that you will speak to those
[33:30] needs dear god
[33:32] we ask these things in the name of the
[33:34] lord jesus christ unto the glory of god
[33:37] amen
[33:42] turn with me in your bibles to
[33:43] colossians chapter three i want to read
[33:45] verses one through three
[34:05] if ye then be risen with christ seek
[34:07] those things which are
[34:09] above where christ sitteth on the right
[34:12] hand of god
[34:14] set your affection on things above not
[34:17] on things
[34:18] on the earth for you are dead and your
[34:20] life is hid with christ in god
[34:22] you may see me i'd like to speak on an
[34:25] eye to set your affection on things
[34:27] above
[34:32] i want to read from romans chapter 8
[34:35] verses 5 through 9.
[34:45] it says for they that are after the
[34:49] flesh do mind the things of the flesh
[34:52] but they that are after the spirit the
[34:54] things of the spirit
[34:56] for to be carnally minded as death but
[35:00] to be spiritually minded as life and
[35:02] peace
[35:03] because the carnal mind is enmity
[35:05] against god for it is not subject to the
[35:08] law of god neither
[35:09] indeed can be so then they
[35:12] that are in the flesh cannot please god
[35:16] but ye are not in the flesh but in the
[35:17] spirit if so be
[35:19] that the spirit of god dwell in you
[35:23] so if the spirit of god dwells in you
[35:27] so you you see there's a nest necessity
[35:32] for being born again there's a necessity
[35:34] for receiving the holy ghost
[35:38] you're not going to be able to make it
[35:40] in your christian walk
[35:42] without the holy ghost
[35:45] that's the thing that people say you
[35:48] know sometimes well i
[35:50] i can't live that i can't do that no of
[35:52] course you can't
[35:54] but that's what god sent the holy ghost
[35:56] for
[35:58] was so the holy ghost would lead and
[36:00] guide you the holy ghost
[36:02] would teach you and it would keep you
[36:05] from those things
[36:09] now there's two sources of love
[36:14] one comes from your spirit realm
[36:17] and that is the human love
[36:21] then there's love that comes from your
[36:24] soul
[36:25] that is a gop of love
[36:29] video love or the human love
[36:33] it will cause a mother to
[36:37] risk her life to save her child
[36:41] it will cause a man to risk his life to
[36:45] save his wife
[36:48] and that's just human love
[36:51] think how much greater god's love is
[37:00] if you only love god with the human love
[37:03] and
[37:03] that is what brother branham said he
[37:06] said
[37:07] he thinks a lot of times he's very
[37:09] convinced that
[37:10] people have been deceived in thinking
[37:12] they've got a gobble love when what
[37:15] they've got is
[37:16] just filial love human love
[37:19] a human love for god i'll show you place
[37:23] in the scriptures where different ones
[37:24] had
[37:25] uh at one time a human love
[37:28] for jesus and
[37:31] with if all you've got is that human
[37:33] love
[37:35] then you've never received the real love
[37:37] spirit of god
[37:39] and if all you love god with is a human
[37:41] love
[37:42] then at some point you're going to leave
[37:45] him
[37:46] because human love fails
[37:51] but god's love is eternal
[38:00] real brotherhood said real genuine love
[38:03] of
[38:04] god comes into the human being by the
[38:07] new birth being born again
[38:09] it had no beginning no have no end
[38:12] you are then a son of god and a daughter
[38:15] of god and your affections
[38:17] are on things above
[38:20] so you to have the god love
[38:24] to be able to have a gobble of you've
[38:26] got to be born again
[38:30] if you've got just human love
[38:34] why uh human love is kind of fickle
[38:42] remember when god came and
[38:45] was talking to adam and eve and he said
[38:48] who
[38:48] told you he asked adam who told you who
[38:51] to eat of that tree
[38:54] and notice adam's love for eve that
[38:57] woman you gave me
[39:00] it was her she gave me of the tree
[39:06] that that's human love
[39:09] but also human love caused him to win
[39:14] uh she had went out and sinned
[39:17] her she was deceived but adam the bible
[39:19] said was not deceived
[39:22] and adam went out willingly to save her
[39:26] and that was human love that was his
[39:29] filial love
[39:31] but god knowing the church was guilty
[39:34] and
[39:34] unworthy he done the same thing he went
[39:38] to the cross
[39:39] took upon him our sins
[39:43] he became us that we might become him
[39:46] and he did that out of god so loved the
[39:49] world
[39:50] that he gave his only begotten son jesus
[39:53] so loved that he gave his life
[39:58] for who or the world but for
[40:02] who would receive it would be the bride
[40:05] of christ
[40:15] you can't uh you can't love with your
[40:18] body
[40:19] your love with your spirit it's one of
[40:21] the inlets of the spirit
[40:24] and that inlet of the spirit
[40:29] it can if it's if it's not set in tune
[40:32] with the soul
[40:34] it can get you in a lot of trouble
[40:38] there are people who uh want to see
[40:41] their children
[40:42] saved but they love their children with
[40:44] the with the human love
[40:46] from their spirit i've had people come
[40:50] to me and say
[40:52] my son is doing this and that and i want
[40:55] god to stop him
[40:57] would you pray that god would stop him
[40:59] and i said do you really want me to pray
[41:01] that
[41:02] they said oh yes i said all right but
[41:05] god's going to stop him then
[41:07] and so the next thing you know they
[41:09] called me up and said he's in jail
[41:11] i said well god stopped him
[41:16] but the same one that asked me that
[41:19] their
[41:20] human love for the sun went down belled
[41:22] him out
[41:23] when i said let him set there
[41:27] because that that would be the only
[41:30] place i could get to to get a hold of
[41:31] him to talk to him
[41:36] and i said he can god can deal with him
[41:39] there
[41:40] you don't you don't gotta you know say
[41:42] well god can't deal with people in jail
[41:44] that
[41:45] that's not true god can deal with the
[41:48] soul no matter where you are
[41:54] so you know your filial love
[41:58] will do more damage to your children
[42:03] than anything else because the human
[42:07] love will make excuse for them a human
[42:09] love
[42:09] will make a loophole for them
[42:12] human love will say well you know you've
[42:15] got to realize brother jerry that's just
[42:17] they've always been like that that's
[42:18] just how they are
[42:21] in other words just accept them well
[42:24] that ain't the way god looks at it
[42:29] god's love would bring them down in
[42:33] to to their last breath just to save
[42:36] their soul
[42:40] because friends look god's love he's not
[42:43] in love
[42:44] with this flesh you walk around in
[42:48] because that's not the real you anyway
[42:52] and this isn't going to be the flesh you
[42:53] walk around in after the rapture
[42:57] so god's not in love with something that
[42:59] is finite
[43:01] that's going to pass away and this flesh
[43:03] is
[43:05] it's going to be changed
[43:08] but what god is in love with is that
[43:11] soul
[43:12] that's on the inside and that's what he
[43:15] came to say
[43:18] he came to redeem this body that's true
[43:21] and we'll come to that redemption
[43:24] in in due time
[43:28] but god loves the soul
[43:34] human love loves the flesh
[43:40] i i would rather if one of my children
[43:44] weren't serving god i would rather see
[43:47] them come down to death's bed
[43:50] give their life to the lord and be gone
[43:52] the next moment than to spend the rest
[43:53] of the time we've got here left on earth
[43:56] with them because at least i'd know
[43:58] where they were
[44:02] that's the truth because once we leave
[44:06] here
[44:08] then your children you won't look at
[44:10] them as your children anymore
[44:12] your loved ones you won't look at them
[44:14] as your loved ones anymore
[44:17] because one day there's going to be
[44:20] folks sitting on this side of the
[44:22] judgment bar
[44:23] and folks standing out on that side
[44:26] and those that are standing on that side
[44:28] you won't say lord now
[44:30] back in life that was my son or my
[44:32] daughter you know
[44:33] have mercy on him no it's going to be
[44:37] judged by the word
[44:46] your memory of those things will at one
[44:48] point be wiped
[44:51] that's the truth because how could you
[44:54] be happy
[44:58] constantly walking around knowing well
[45:00] so and so didn't make it
[45:03] but god wants you to be happy he wants
[45:05] you to be happy here
[45:08] and you know when you've got loved ones
[45:11] that are not saved why
[45:13] you god still wants you to be happy
[45:17] you can't be worried about them you can
[45:19] pray about them and commit them to god
[45:22] but worrying will just bring sickness to
[45:25] you
[45:29] if they belong to god they're going to
[45:31] come i'll tell you something friends
[45:33] if you belong to god you'll come
[45:37] you might come easy or you might come
[45:39] hard but if you belong to him you're
[45:41] going to come god will make sure of that
[45:47] and he has a way of getting your
[45:48] attention
[45:56] there is uh degrees of human
[46:00] love there's different degrees of human
[46:03] love there's
[46:04] one love you have for your children
[46:07] there's one love you have for your
[46:08] spouse
[46:09] it's another love you have for your
[46:11] brothers and sisters
[46:14] there's another love you have for your
[46:15] friends
[46:17] there's different degrees of agape love
[46:25] matthew 5 46 said for if you love them
[46:28] which love you
[46:29] what reward have you do not even
[46:32] republicans
[46:33] the same
[46:40] remember when jesus was invited to
[46:43] simon's house and
[46:45] he sat there and no one washed his feet
[46:47] no one welcomed him with a kiss
[46:50] and so on until the woman came in
[46:54] and afterwards jesus said to simon i've
[46:57] got something to say to you
[47:00] and he said what is it he said
[47:03] there was a a a a creditor
[47:08] which had two debtors and he said one
[47:11] holding 500 pence and the other 50 pence
[47:16] and they couldn't pay their debt
[47:19] and so the creditor just forgave him the
[47:22] debt
[47:24] then he asked simon he says now which
[47:25] one of them would love him the most
[47:29] and simon said the one he forgave the
[47:31] most
[47:33] and jesus said you've spoken well
[47:36] amen and turned to the woman said your
[47:39] sins which were many
[47:41] are all forgiving you
[47:44] this was showing that there were degrees
[47:47] of agape love
[47:51] she was forgiven of many sins
[47:56] she loved greatly
[47:59] now
[48:05] when uh god created man
[48:09] we know that he created him in a spirit
[48:12] form first
[48:14] and the bible says he created him both
[48:16] male and female
[48:18] and man and woman and
[48:22] uh but there was found no one to till
[48:26] the soil
[48:28] and so god came down and he made a body
[48:31] out of the dirt he took the masculine
[48:35] spirit
[48:36] and he put it in adam
[48:41] but then we find that after
[48:44] all this creation and went on that adam
[48:48] was lonesome there wasn't fountain no
[48:51] help made for him he had all the
[48:53] the animals and all these things around
[48:55] him but there was no help made found for
[49:00] him
[49:06] you realize the serpent was created in
[49:08] the
[49:10] in the creation
[49:14] and it was the closest thing to man
[49:18] and we know what eve did when she had
[49:21] her opportunity
[49:24] but adam didn't find a help mate
[49:28] with the serpent adam didn't mix with
[49:31] the serpent
[49:35] and so god didn't come down and
[49:39] take more dirt and make another creation
[49:43] but since he had created them as
[49:46] one to begin with he come down and
[49:49] and caused a deep sleep to fall upon
[49:51] adam and from his side
[49:53] he took a rib right brother graham said
[49:55] he took the rib that was right over his
[49:57] heart
[49:59] and from that he made another body and
[50:02] brought that feminist spirit down
[50:04] and put it in that body and brother ram
[50:06] said that
[50:08] was that feminine spirit was the love
[50:10] spirit kind and gentle and
[50:13] and weak he said but he put the
[50:15] masculine spirit
[50:17] in the man but today they've got it
[50:20] all twisted up and twisted around
[50:23] and brother branham said if it's any
[50:25] other way then it's
[50:38] perversion
[50:47] the verb said it was love at first sight
[50:51] adam come to from sleep and
[50:54] beheld her he said you'll be called
[50:56] woman for you were taken from man
[51:00] and he and he said it was love at first
[51:02] sight
[51:05] you know isaac
[51:08] when he was out walking in the fields
[51:11] eliezer brought rebecca and you know
[51:14] rebecca had a veil over her
[51:18] but when they saw one another even with
[51:21] the veil over her
[51:23] isaac brother brown said it was love at
[51:25] first sight
[51:29] and that's the way it is with christ
[51:33] it's love at first sight christ loved
[51:36] you
[51:37] because he foresaw you
[51:40] not just sight as we look at it in this
[51:42] world or this earth
[51:44] but he foresaw you
[51:48] when he was on the cross i was on his
[51:50] mind
[51:52] hallelujah he loved me
[51:56] he knew me yet he loved me
[52:02] and and the love that he had for me
[52:05] is what took him to the cross
[52:09] when he had to overcome
[52:13] his human self in the garden
[52:19] where he said father if it'd be possible
[52:22] let this cup pass from me
[52:25] and you know he prayed three times
[52:29] but on the third time he said
[52:30] nevertheless not my will but thine be
[52:33] done
[52:35] but he had to overcome the flesh and
[52:36] what helped him to overcome the flesh
[52:39] was the agape love
[52:43] what helped us to overcome the flesh
[52:46] god's love
[52:47] in us you'll never overcome the flesh
[52:52] without
[52:52] that true love of god in your soul
[52:57] but once you've got that love of god in
[52:59] your soul
[53:00] it'll stop you from smoking it'll stop
[53:02] you from lying it'll stop you from
[53:04] drinking
[53:05] it'll stop you from all these things why
[53:07] because all those things are attributes
[53:09] of sin
[53:10] which is unbelief and when you've got
[53:13] the perfect love of god
[53:16] then it brings faith
[53:19] not unbelief but belief
[53:23] and perfect love brings faith
[53:29] sometimes we as brother madam said we
[53:34] we people say they love god
[53:38] but remember peter when uh
[53:42] jesus was speaking about the things that
[53:44] was going to happen to him
[53:46] and he said that
[53:50] i'm going to die they're going to
[53:53] they're going to
[53:54] do these different things to me and
[53:57] peter took him aside and rebuked him and
[53:59] said
[54:00] far be it from you for those things to
[54:02] happen
[54:04] see that was peter loved jesus
[54:08] but he loved him with the human love
[54:12] and that's why when jesus was there and
[54:14] they were whipping him and all these
[54:15] things and peter was standing
[54:17] just afar off and looking on they come
[54:20] and ask peter said you're one of those
[54:22] that went
[54:22] that was with jim peter said no i'm not
[54:28] what was that human love it was failing
[54:33] and he said but i i know
[54:36] you talk like them he said i don't know
[54:39] the man
[54:41] see that was human love human love said
[54:44] far be if i won't let these things
[54:46] happen to you
[54:48] but then when they begin to happen he
[54:49] said oh i don't know him
[54:54] when jesus arose
[54:59] and he went to
[55:02] down to the shore the seashore and there
[55:06] was
[55:07] peter and some of the disciples out in a
[55:09] boat because remember peter said
[55:12] he didn't know what to make of all this
[55:14] he says oh i'm just going to go fishing
[55:17] so they were down there in the boat and
[55:19] they were fishing and they
[55:21] toiled all night and they hadn't caught
[55:22] a thing
[55:25] and jesus appeared to him on the shore
[55:28] he said have you any meat and they said
[55:30] no we told a night we haven't caught
[55:32] anything
[55:34] and he said cast your nets on the right
[55:36] side of the boat
[55:39] and and you'll haul in some fish
[55:43] and so they took the nets cast them on
[55:45] the right side of the boat
[55:46] what makes a difference the left side
[55:48] the right side i don't know
[55:51] but jesus said cast it on the right side
[55:54] and they cast it on the other side of
[55:56] the boat and all of a sudden they had
[55:58] fish
[55:59] brother graham said believe god created
[56:01] them fish
[56:04] and when this happened they pulled in
[56:07] they more than they could hardly pull up
[56:10] then the bible said the disciple that
[56:12] loved
[56:13] whom jesus loved said peter that's him
[56:19] he's done this before i remember
[56:23] that's him and when peter realized that
[56:26] it was
[56:27] indeed jesus why he cast himself in the
[56:31] sea
[56:33] then when they came into shore while
[56:36] they found
[56:36] jesus had a fire going and he was
[56:39] cooking fish
[56:41] now when the boy came that time
[56:45] and had his loaves of bread and his fish
[56:48] and jesus began to break off the loaves
[56:50] and the fish or whatever jesus never had
[56:52] to
[56:52] make another fire to cook more and more
[56:55] fish
[56:56] but it just multiplied what was there
[57:00] so there was a reason that jesus built a
[57:02] fire this time
[57:05] and it was because jesus was showing him
[57:07] first thing he was going to do was take
[57:09] care of their natural needs
[57:12] and he was going to feed him now they
[57:15] caught the fish and they were bringing
[57:17] them in in a small
[57:18] boat and as they bring but jesus already
[57:21] had some fish
[57:25] and he was cooking it on a fire for when
[57:27] they came in
[57:30] and he took care of their natural needs
[57:33] look friends jesus cares about your
[57:35] natural needs
[57:36] as well as your spiritual needs
[57:43] he'll take care of those things and why
[57:44] the bible said seek ye
[57:46] first the kingdom of god and all of his
[57:49] righteousness
[57:50] and all these other things will be added
[57:52] unto you jesus will take care of them
[57:57] then we find peter makes it into shore
[58:01] and as he comes in the shore and jesus
[58:03] says to him
[58:04] simon lovett stop me
[58:07] and you look in the greek jesus asked
[58:10] him
[58:11] simon feel he owe thou me do you love me
[58:14] with the human love
[58:16] and peter answers yes lord i love you
[58:19] with the human love
[58:22] and then jesus asked him again said
[58:26] simon lovett's thou me ask him again do
[58:29] you love me with the human love
[58:32] and he said yes lord i love you with
[58:33] human love
[58:36] he said do you love me with the god of
[58:39] love
[58:41] peter said i love you with the human
[58:43] love
[58:45] jesus wasn't trying to embarrass peter
[58:49] but he was trying to show peter that he
[58:52] would not be able to love with the agape
[58:54] love
[58:55] until he had received power from on high
[59:00] until he received the holy ghost he
[59:02] would be incapable
[59:04] of loving with a gop of love
[59:07] but then watched when peter has a gop of
[59:10] love
[59:11] they go to crucify peter
[59:14] peter said i'm not worthy think about
[59:17] this
[59:18] i'm not worthy to be crucified like my
[59:20] lord
[59:21] is it crucified me upside down
[59:26] that was a gospel of so i'm not worthy
[59:28] to be crucified like him
[59:33] but peter was willing to give his life
[59:36] yeah you don't hear him saying please
[59:38] don't crucify me he just said don't
[59:40] crucify me like that
[59:42] crucify me upside down peter was willing
[59:45] to give his life
[59:46] for the gospel that's
[59:50] godly love
[59:55] now you think about people
[59:58] that will miss this rapture
[1:00:05] and if they're given a choice while you
[1:00:08] join this or you bow to this
[1:00:10] you know like the the shadrach meshach
[1:00:13] and abednego they said if you
[1:00:15] bow to this idol
[1:00:18] talk among yourself boys come up with an
[1:00:21] answer and they said oh king
[1:00:23] we don't need to take counsel we're not
[1:00:26] going to bow
[1:00:28] it's because they loved they loved god
[1:00:32] but see how is somebody who missed the
[1:00:35] rapture how they going to overcome these
[1:00:37] things when all they had was a human
[1:00:40] love
[1:00:42] won't be able to
[1:00:46] because at that time all that had the
[1:00:48] godly love will have been gone in the
[1:00:54] rapture
[1:00:56] love god with the human love then you're
[1:00:59] constantly torn between
[1:01:01] love of this world and love for god
[1:01:05] because that's you're loving with the
[1:01:07] human love
[1:01:10] you love these things of the world and
[1:01:11] you say well i love god
[1:01:13] i don't want to go to hell i want to go
[1:01:15] in the rapture
[1:01:18] but i i really love these other things
[1:01:20] over here
[1:01:21] and they're torn between
[1:01:25] you see the spirit minds the things of
[1:01:29] the soul
[1:01:31] and desires for the things the soul
[1:01:35] desires
[1:01:37] but the flesh the
[1:01:40] the it desires for the things of the
[1:01:43] flesh
[1:01:45] it's carnally minded which we find as
[1:01:48] enmity with god
[1:01:55] and there are people that get caught
[1:01:58] between that
[1:02:01] and they struggle but once you've been
[1:02:04] born again
[1:02:06] what happens is you receive that agape
[1:02:09] love
[1:02:10] then there's no more struggle
[1:02:14] now let me just make something clear
[1:02:17] here
[1:02:17] you can you could there could be things
[1:02:20] like your
[1:02:22] your dog or your i don't know your
[1:02:24] clothes your car
[1:02:26] your house these things you love and you
[1:02:29] love them with the human love the degree
[1:02:31] of
[1:02:31] human love and that's not adultery
[1:02:35] on god but if you take
[1:02:39] and direct that divine love
[1:02:42] what should be toward only toward god
[1:02:45] and direct it at those things then
[1:02:47] you're committing
[1:02:47] adultery on god your husband
[1:02:56] but you know i had someone
[1:03:01] some years ago that kept saying they i'm
[1:03:04] trying i really want to serve god i
[1:03:05] really want to serve god but
[1:03:07] you know i like cocaine and i i like
[1:03:10] marijuana and i like doing these things
[1:03:12] you know
[1:03:13] and they were struggling but it was
[1:03:14] because they were trying to come to god
[1:03:17] of their own accord of their own mind
[1:03:20] they were trying to do it
[1:03:21] on it with a carnal mind you see
[1:03:26] god's love doesn't reason
[1:03:30] human love will reason
[1:03:34] human love is intellectual
[1:03:37] and it'll reason but god's love won't
[1:03:40] reason
[1:03:42] god's love is based on the word
[1:03:46] look human love is based on emotions
[1:03:51] and when people love god with the human
[1:03:54] love
[1:03:54] then it's based on how they feel
[1:04:00] and they you know maybe some things will
[1:04:03] start to go wrong
[1:04:05] and they'll begin to think well
[1:04:08] uh why is all these things happen to me
[1:04:11] don't god love me
[1:04:14] that's because they're loving with the
[1:04:16] human love and they're looking at god
[1:04:18] with the human love
[1:04:19] and they're expecting god to love them
[1:04:20] with that same kind of love
[1:04:22] and so there's a question there does he
[1:04:24] love me look
[1:04:26] yes he does but with the god of love
[1:04:31] and then a god of love allows things to
[1:04:34] come your way
[1:04:35] in order to mold you and shape you to
[1:04:38] reign in the time
[1:04:40] of the millennium it's to mold you and
[1:04:44] shape you to get you
[1:04:45] ready to live in a new heaven and a new
[1:04:48] earth
[1:04:52] you know after the time of the
[1:04:54] millennium we're raised back up and then
[1:04:55] the earth's burnt over
[1:04:57] the heavens has burnt over the
[1:04:59] atmosphere
[1:05:00] right and then god makes a new heaven
[1:05:04] and a new earth
[1:05:06] makes it i ain't worried about the ozone
[1:05:08] layer
[1:05:10] i'm not worried about global warming
[1:05:13] because i'm looking to a new earth
[1:05:18] and then after that we come back down
[1:05:22] and live for eternity on the new
[1:05:25] earth god's preparing us for that now
[1:05:30] that's why he allows us to go through
[1:05:32] things
[1:05:35] and god will allow you to be tested
[1:05:40] so that you can take inventory of
[1:05:42] yourself
[1:05:44] he'll allow you to be tested so you can
[1:05:45] say am i loving god with the human love
[1:05:47] or am i loving me with the god beloved
[1:05:52] the bible says set your affections on
[1:05:54] things above not on things of this earth
[1:06:05] well yeah i love god but i love to go
[1:06:07] out and kind of
[1:06:09] have a good time you know
[1:06:13] i have a good time
[1:06:18] i believe in having a good time it's
[1:06:22] just
[1:06:22] it differs what they think is a good
[1:06:24] time what i think is a good time
[1:06:28] i i don't i don't think going out and
[1:06:31] getting plastered
[1:06:32] and waking up the next morning with a
[1:06:34] hangover is a good time
[1:06:39] i don't think getting out and running
[1:06:41] around your wife is a good time
[1:06:49] i think serving the lord is a good time
[1:06:55] i enjoy hearing the testimonies of the
[1:06:58] people of what god
[1:06:59] does in their lives that's a good time
[1:07:04] hearing about how something was coming
[1:07:08] against them and how god delivered them
[1:07:13] when you can get into the presence of
[1:07:15] god maybe you've been praying and then
[1:07:17] maybe been listening to a message or
[1:07:19] something or reading your bible or a
[1:07:21] book
[1:07:21] and all of a sudden something just
[1:07:23] strikes you in the spirit
[1:07:24] and then something just sinks down in
[1:07:26] there you know and
[1:07:28] and you just get beside yourself and you
[1:07:30] just start having a hallelujah breakdown
[1:07:32] that's a good time
[1:07:37] remember brother branham said he was out
[1:07:39] there hunting and remember that and he
[1:07:42] got to watching those those eagles and
[1:07:44] what was going on and he got
[1:07:46] all happy and seeing god in nature and
[1:07:48] that he
[1:07:49] leaned his rifle up against the tree and
[1:07:51] he said he
[1:07:52] he uh got all beside himself started
[1:07:55] running around the tree
[1:07:58] he said a little squirrel came down and
[1:07:59] began to chatter at him
[1:08:01] all right what are you running around
[1:08:03] the tree for days miracles are passed
[1:08:07] what are you all happy about for don't
[1:08:09] you know how life
[1:08:10] is he said he just ran around the tree
[1:08:13] again
[1:08:17] he was having a good time out there all
[1:08:19] by himself
[1:08:22] hallelujah look you don't got to come to
[1:08:24] church to get in the spirit
[1:08:27] you ought to get in the spirit and bring
[1:08:29] it with you
[1:08:39] many of you know brother ron spencer
[1:08:43] some years ago he was asked to go
[1:08:46] hunting in a certain place
[1:08:49] and uh and asked us to preach at this
[1:08:52] church
[1:08:54] and there was a couple of men
[1:08:58] there were husbands of women that was in
[1:09:01] the church
[1:09:03] and they had kind of set up for them to
[1:09:05] go hunting with him
[1:09:08] and i i don't remember now i don't think
[1:09:10] they got anything on that hunt
[1:09:13] but brother ron got them two men saved
[1:09:17] all out there in the woods and they had
[1:09:20] a good time
[1:09:22] hallelujah
[1:09:32] god doesn't want you to divide
[1:09:36] the love you have for him with anything
[1:09:45] he doesn't want you to divide your love
[1:09:48] between him and your wife
[1:09:50] well you know if she goes to church then
[1:09:52] i'll go
[1:09:56] no god wants you to put him first
[1:10:04] and i have found over the years that's
[1:10:06] where some folks have
[1:10:07] their problem at they come to me with
[1:10:11] different
[1:10:11] problems in their family and different
[1:10:13] problems going on and i find out the
[1:10:15] thing it is they haven't put god first
[1:10:23] brother biscuit i went and heard him
[1:10:25] preach one time or
[1:10:26] actually speak i should say he was
[1:10:29] speaking to ministers
[1:10:31] and he said people come to me for
[1:10:33] counseling he said you know he doesn't
[1:10:35] take care of the books and all those
[1:10:37] things of the church he don't know who
[1:10:38] does what
[1:10:41] who gives who doesn't or whatever but he
[1:10:42] said when people come to him
[1:10:44] for counseling with problems he said the
[1:10:46] first thing i have them
[1:10:47] ask him are you giving your tithe and
[1:10:49] offer
[1:10:51] because if you're not doing that then
[1:10:54] that's where you
[1:10:54] the first part of your problems at
[1:10:58] you see you've got to put god first
[1:11:05] oh they don't need my money
[1:11:09] that's where you're wrong it ain't your
[1:11:11] money
[1:11:14] according to the bible ten percent comes
[1:11:16] off the top
[1:11:18] and then your offerings come then after
[1:11:20] that
[1:11:22] and that all the tithing it already
[1:11:25] belonged
[1:11:26] to god you haven't accomplished anything
[1:11:32] you just gave god back what was his
[1:11:34] already
[1:11:36] but when you're giving you offerings
[1:11:39] that's when you're really giving to god
[1:11:42] something that belongs to you
[1:11:49] you've got to have god first in your
[1:11:52] life
[1:11:54] he's got to be before your husband
[1:11:55] before your wife before your children
[1:12:05] god will not take second place
[1:12:09] he's got to have first place in your
[1:12:12] life
[1:12:14] and and it re it solves a lot of your
[1:12:17] trouble
[1:12:19] when you've got him in first place
[1:12:22] because then a lot of your questions
[1:12:24] about whether i should do this or
[1:12:26] whether i should do that get answered
[1:12:28] amen
[1:12:32] and if there's i've always done it this
[1:12:34] way if there's a doubt
[1:12:36] then just don't do it
[1:12:39] you know brother ram said check your
[1:12:40] motives and objectives right
[1:12:43] but if there's any doubt then just leave
[1:12:45] it alone
[1:12:52] you got a control tower it's in your
[1:12:55] soul
[1:12:57] that control tower see from there it
[1:13:00] comes out that
[1:13:01] godly love and
[1:13:06] that control tower also if you'll yield
[1:13:09] be yielded to god
[1:13:13] who dwells on the inside it'll con it'll
[1:13:16] take control
[1:13:17] of that spirit and control
[1:13:20] your gate of affection
[1:13:31] forgive me i just been preaching i don't
[1:13:33] even know where i'm at in these notes
[1:13:39] christ revealed his own word brother ram
[1:13:41] says therefore whatever the will of god
[1:13:43] is
[1:13:45] let god's will be done whether i'm happy
[1:13:47] with it or not i want to live so he
[1:13:50] will be pleased with what i do
[1:13:56] check your objective and your motive by
[1:13:58] that you'll know whether you love god
[1:14:00] or not what if he'd say you serve me
[1:14:03] but i'm going to cast you away would you
[1:14:06] say i love you anyhow
[1:14:11] now genuine love for god no matter what
[1:14:14] part i
[1:14:14] am lord if i can only say a word for it
[1:14:17] to help
[1:14:18] protect it let me do that that's the
[1:14:20] same thing would be with your wife if
[1:14:22] you really love her
[1:14:24] not affiliate love but agape love a
[1:14:26] genuine love
[1:14:30] brother madam gives an example and he
[1:14:31] says
[1:14:34] if you love your wife with filial love
[1:14:36] he said if some
[1:14:38] body insulted her said you know you
[1:14:41] would want a defender
[1:14:42] he said you'd want you may even want to
[1:14:44] shoot him
[1:14:48] he said but if you had a godly love
[1:14:50] you'd pray for him
[1:14:53] that's different then he goes on another
[1:14:57] place and begins to
[1:14:58] say about talking about love and
[1:15:02] for your wife and your husband and so
[1:15:04] forth and he said
[1:15:06] if you loved a woman and you you wanted
[1:15:08] to make her your wife but she didn't
[1:15:10] want to be with you
[1:15:12] she had loved someone else he said if
[1:15:15] you really loved her right
[1:15:17] with the godly love you would want her
[1:15:19] to be happy you'd want her to be with
[1:15:20] who she wanted to be with
[1:15:23] but if you're not loving or right then
[1:15:25] what are you going to do
[1:15:27] you're going to try to force the issue
[1:15:29] i'll leave that
[1:15:39] the great need the world is dying for
[1:15:41] today is
[1:15:42] and and god is love
[1:15:45] you find in the church what hindered the
[1:15:47] church was the wrong conception of love
[1:15:51] there's two different types of love
[1:15:53] that's real love one of them
[1:15:55] is called agapio that's god love then
[1:15:58] there's
[1:15:58] the perverted love which is filial love
[1:16:00] which means human love
[1:16:03] video comes from the word fellowship
[1:16:07] and he says filial love is accompanied
[1:16:11] by
[1:16:11] jealousy but agape love
[1:16:16] is god's love is the beginning of love
[1:16:19] it's the fountain
[1:16:20] of love and the church today is lacking
[1:16:23] that
[1:16:23] real agapial love that will make you
[1:16:26] love your enemy
[1:16:32] i will tell you something friends you'll
[1:16:35] never be able to love your enemy with
[1:16:37] human love
[1:16:38] if that's what you're relying on it
[1:16:41] won't work
[1:16:45] i can tell you right now i do not filio
[1:16:47] any of my enemies
[1:16:58] but agape love will make you pray for
[1:17:03] agape love will make you look beyond
[1:17:05] that maybe see it ain't really that
[1:17:07] person that's your enemy
[1:17:08] it's the devil that's got to hold up
[1:17:13] and you can pray for their deliverance
[1:17:20] i've been there
[1:17:24] i've got i've got a son-in-law that
[1:17:26] tells you about it every time he comes
[1:17:28] and visits you
[1:17:44] first john
[1:17:48] chapter 2
[1:17:52] verse 14 says i have written unto you
[1:17:54] fathers because
[1:17:56] ye have known him that is from the
[1:17:58] beginning and i have written unto you
[1:18:00] young men because you are strong
[1:18:02] and the word of god abideth in you and
[1:18:05] ye have overcome the wicked one
[1:18:08] love not the world neither the things
[1:18:11] that are in the
[1:18:12] world if any man love the world the love
[1:18:14] of the father is not in it
[1:18:28] you know brother branham said in the
[1:18:31] message i believe you
[1:18:32] that i can do this he says i love to
[1:18:35] hear an organ
[1:18:40] brother branham was one man spoke to him
[1:18:43] and
[1:18:44] and said brother branham said i i've got
[1:18:47] something against you and he said what's
[1:18:50] that
[1:18:51] he said you have music in your church
[1:18:56] and brother branham says well
[1:19:00] god loves music he said oh no no no he
[1:19:03] can't
[1:19:05] he brother brahmana said well you know
[1:19:07] one time there was a prophet
[1:19:10] that had kind of got beside himself got
[1:19:13] really upset
[1:19:14] because of what had been come and told
[1:19:17] to it
[1:19:18] and he and he couldn't get in the spirit
[1:19:21] and he couldn't prophesy and so he
[1:19:24] called for a minstrel when they come and
[1:19:26] played and brother m said they played
[1:19:28] a real holy ghost song and after they
[1:19:31] began to play
[1:19:32] then he began to get free up in the
[1:19:34] spirit and was able to prophesy
[1:19:36] then he said if god loved music back
[1:19:39] then he still loves it today
[1:19:41] because the bible says he's the same
[1:19:43] yesterday today and forever
[1:19:54] satan we know has perverted music
[1:20:00] and that's you know the bible says that
[1:20:03] uh uh
[1:20:06] lucifer the workmanship of his table
[1:20:10] uh tabarets and pipes with him
[1:20:13] the day he was created he took and con
[1:20:16] and perverted that from a worship to god
[1:20:19] to a worship to himself
[1:20:24] but god loves music
[1:20:27] and he loves music in the church
[1:20:30] and if music would get the spirit of god
[1:20:33] to move on the prophet
[1:20:34] brother graham said the music in a
[1:20:36] church can get the spirit of god moving
[1:20:38] in the church
[1:20:47] and it doesn't have to be dead
[1:20:51] it doesn't have to be funeral music
[1:20:56] it reminds me i think it was if i'm
[1:20:58] right it was brother bosworth that was
[1:21:01] in the hospital dying and they were
[1:21:03] closing the blinds you know and singing
[1:21:05] these
[1:21:07] songs you know just kind of weepy songs
[1:21:10] and he said who's dying here me or you
[1:21:14] he said sing some happy songs
[1:21:19] you can you can worship the lord
[1:21:28] there can be life in your services
[1:21:32] singing music and dancing
[1:21:40] some people used to dance in front of
[1:21:42] everybody for the devil
[1:21:45] but now are ashamed to dance for the
[1:21:47] lord in the church
[1:21:48] [Applause]
[1:21:51] brother branham said he went and visited
[1:21:54] some pentecostal people he says and they
[1:21:56] got happy in the spirit and began to
[1:21:58] dance and you know
[1:21:59] and so he got to kind of doing some
[1:22:01] research on it
[1:22:03] and found out that when the children of
[1:22:06] israel had crossed over the red
[1:22:07] sea the miriam took up her her
[1:22:11] uh tambourine and began to dance
[1:22:15] and said when they brought the ark of
[1:22:18] the covenant back into jerusalem what
[1:22:21] david got out before it and danced
[1:22:24] he said so i see the dancing is of god
[1:22:26] just the devil
[1:22:27] perverted it he
[1:22:30] it it wasn't his he copied something
[1:22:34] that was of god
[1:22:41] said he was preaching on the second
[1:22:42] coming of of jesus christ
[1:22:45] and there was some some people that had
[1:22:47] come down
[1:22:48] come from louisville to come in to visit
[1:22:51] and he said
[1:22:52] they uh put a note up there they had a
[1:22:54] song
[1:22:56] and so these uh young women got up
[1:23:00] and began to sing this song and one of
[1:23:02] them was played on the piano
[1:23:05] and it was uh there's going to be a
[1:23:07] meeting in the air
[1:23:11] and as they were going through it and
[1:23:13] they just kept
[1:23:14] singing and kept playing and after a
[1:23:15] while one of them got to dancing
[1:23:18] brother ram said his first thought was
[1:23:20] oh my in my own church
[1:23:21] i'm really going to hear it for this he
[1:23:25] said but then
[1:23:25] after a bit he said he found out he was
[1:23:28] tapping his foot
[1:23:31] and he said he thought my that must be
[1:23:34] the methodist foot
[1:23:36] and he said his foot just got tapping
[1:23:39] and tapping he said next thing you know
[1:23:41] he said i was out there dancing with her
[1:23:44] he said i got in the spirit i got the
[1:23:46] victory
[1:23:48] he said that's what it was i just didn't
[1:23:50] have enough victory
[1:23:53] and he and he said people say well now
[1:23:57] all right if it's in order he said if
[1:23:58] it's of god it'll be in order
[1:24:01] it'll it'll be uh presentable
[1:24:05] if it's of god don't worry about
[1:24:08] it
[1:24:14] i've seen your senior pastor one time
[1:24:17] take off running from here it looked
[1:24:19] like he was going to run through that
[1:24:20] door
[1:24:21] i was up here preaching he ran over at
[1:24:24] that wall
[1:24:25] turned around and ran back
[1:24:30] he got happy got beside himself
[1:24:33] after he'd done that another brother
[1:24:35] jumped up began to run around the
[1:24:36] building
[1:24:39] this has been years ago
[1:24:44] way past 20 some years ago before i ever
[1:24:46] moved down to tennessee
[1:24:50] hallelujah
[1:24:54] your love ought to be toward christ but
[1:24:56] satan perverts that love to something to
[1:24:59] the world
[1:25:01] god made man in his mechanism to thirst
[1:25:04] for god's life
[1:25:06] and satan perverts it over and tries to
[1:25:08] satisfy that blessed thirst with sin
[1:25:12] that's what makes women smoke cigarettes
[1:25:14] what makes men smoke cigarettes
[1:25:16] what makes you get out and strip
[1:25:17] yourself off on the streets
[1:25:19] that's what makes people do the way they
[1:25:21] do that's what makes the men and women
[1:25:23] live dishonorable to one another
[1:25:25] it's the reason they stay home on
[1:25:27] wednesday night and watch i love susie
[1:25:29] or something like that instead of
[1:25:31] staying at prayer meeting and it's
[1:25:33] because the devil
[1:25:34] has given you a lemon he's perverted
[1:25:36] that godly thirst in you
[1:25:38] trying to satisfy you with his own slop
[1:25:40] out of hell
[1:25:42] but god made you to thirst for him
[1:25:49] brother branham had come back from a
[1:25:51] trip he was in jeffersonville
[1:25:54] and he got back in he wasn't feeling
[1:25:56] well
[1:25:58] and his stomach was really bothering me
[1:26:03] and he thought maybe about maybe he
[1:26:06] wouldn't go
[1:26:07] over to the service you know
[1:26:10] and uh brother neville was going to be
[1:26:13] speaking
[1:26:14] and brother branham thought maybe he
[1:26:16] wouldn't go over the service he just
[1:26:17] wasn't feeling well
[1:26:19] and he said you know if i'd if i hadn't
[1:26:22] went he said i wouldn't have been lost
[1:26:25] right he said but i i got up and went
[1:26:29] anyway he said you know why i went
[1:26:32] because i love
[1:26:34] god
[1:26:36] amen hallelujah i win anyway because i
[1:26:40] love god
[1:26:41] amen it's a thirst for god that brings
[1:26:44] you here
[1:26:47] it's the thirst for god that makes you
[1:26:49] get off a shift at work
[1:26:51] you know and maybe hurdly try to eat
[1:26:53] some supper and
[1:26:54] try to get ready to get in over here or
[1:26:57] maybe sometimes
[1:26:58] people i've seen him come straight from
[1:26:59] work
[1:27:01] what is it's a love for god
[1:27:07] someone says hey why don't you come out
[1:27:10] and have dinner with me on thursday
[1:27:12] night and oh i can i'm going to church
[1:27:16] and it ain't because you have to go to
[1:27:17] church
[1:27:19] it isn't because it's a law
[1:27:22] it's because you love god you can't wait
[1:27:24] to get there brother brown said
[1:27:26] if you've got the holy ghost
[1:27:29] you can't wait for them church doors to
[1:27:32] open
[1:27:33] if you've got the real love of god in
[1:27:35] your heart you can't wait to get here
[1:27:38] that's the real love of god
[1:27:42] you see satan wants to put a damper on
[1:27:44] that
[1:27:45] many times he'll he'll you know bring
[1:27:48] something to get people all upset on
[1:27:50] thursday night
[1:27:53] everything's going fine monday tuesday
[1:27:55] wednesday but on thursday something gets
[1:27:58] you know a hair gets in the biscuit
[1:28:02] and uh you know it seemed like
[1:28:06] you know then after a bit and said well
[1:28:08] nobody feels like going
[1:28:11] that's just the devil trying to throw
[1:28:13] something in there to hinder you
[1:28:16] come anyhow realize who that
[1:28:19] is that's just the devil
[1:28:22] and if you love god you'll overcome that
[1:28:24] devil
[1:28:26] because greater is he that's in you and
[1:28:29] what is it that's in you
[1:28:30] it's god and what is god the bible said
[1:28:34] god is love
[1:28:47] satan is always trying to get
[1:28:51] something fumbled up in your mind
[1:28:55] but shut your affections on things above
[1:28:58] where christ
[1:28:58] sits at the right hand of god and
[1:29:00] remember this
[1:29:01] the bible said he's the same yesterday
[1:29:03] today and forever
[1:29:05] and if his spirit be here he reveals
[1:29:08] things today as he
[1:29:10] did in days gone by
[1:29:14] and then in another message what he
[1:29:16] saith unto you do it
[1:29:18] brother braham's praying he says and may
[1:29:20] the lord reveal himself to each one of
[1:29:22] you tonight
[1:29:23] in such a way you'll set your affections
[1:29:25] toward jesus christ
[1:29:35] the holy ghost will make you live a holy
[1:29:38] life
[1:29:39] that's what the holy ghost power is for
[1:29:41] is to set your affections on things
[1:29:43] above
[1:29:45] the mind of christ in you you can't help
[1:29:49] from seeing those things
[1:29:52] hallelujah when you look at him you turn
[1:29:54] your head that's right
[1:29:56] it'll make you turn your head
[1:29:59] you say i can't do it oh i just can't do
[1:30:02] it sure you can't but the holy spirit
[1:30:04] come for that purpose that's what it did
[1:30:06] it come to take it out of you
[1:30:08] all them old habits and things you're
[1:30:10] doing that old
[1:30:12] backbiting separating yourself saying uh
[1:30:15] i i don't want nothing to do with them
[1:30:17] holy rollers the holy ghost come to take
[1:30:19] that out of you
[1:30:24] falling apart of this world the room
[1:30:27] says
[1:30:28] there's to be a new heaven come forth
[1:30:30] and a new earth
[1:30:31] which will never part again as long as
[1:30:33] eternity lasts
[1:30:35] we're looking for that new heaven and
[1:30:37] earth this one you
[1:30:39] have you this one you can have all you
[1:30:42] want
[1:30:43] for me i want that one it depends on
[1:30:47] where you set your affections
[1:30:50] it depends on what post you tied to
[1:30:54] if you tied anything in this world any
[1:30:58] politics and things like that
[1:31:00] and trust in that you'll sink with it
[1:31:05] you're like god's love brings a real
[1:31:08] true trust in god
[1:31:15] with god's love you'll see things moving
[1:31:17] and you don't think well god's frowning
[1:31:19] on me
