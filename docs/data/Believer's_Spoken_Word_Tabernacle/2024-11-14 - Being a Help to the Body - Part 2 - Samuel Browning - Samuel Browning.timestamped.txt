[40:21] and father
[40:23] we've opened this service Lord with one
[40:27] desire Lord and that's oh God that as we
[40:32] would Lord begin to worship you and
[40:34] thank you Father for your mercies and
[40:36] your goodness for your care Lord Upon
[40:39] Our Lives for your leadership Lord we
[40:42] have we have come here tonight with Lord
[40:45] a praise within our hearts
[40:48] Lord father yet how what a paradox it is
[40:52] Lord that here we can come with a praise
[40:55] in our hearts and sometimes Lord we come
[40:57] with very heavy hearts at the same
[41:01] time with Lord needs and things that
[41:05] Lord that lay before us and dear God may
[41:09] be Lord of even presently Lord pressures
[41:12] and decisions that Lord that we need
[41:16] your
[41:18] leadership
[41:20] [Music]
[41:21] Lord that's what we
[41:24] value more than our own thoughts more
[41:27] than our own
[41:29] opinions Lord in our own thoughts and
[41:31] our own opinions there is no there's no
[41:35] peace but
[41:37] father it's Lord through your word it
[41:41] brings peace into our lives
[41:43] Lord this is why Lord that even you
[41:46] would say in your word time and time
[41:48] again that he that would keep his mind
[41:51] stayed on
[41:52] me I will keep him in a perfect peace
[41:59] Lord would you help us tonight
[42:02] Lord God if there be any minds or any
[42:05] hearts Lord any heaviness Lord that's
[42:08] Among Us father you're here to minister
[42:12] to our needs Lord thank you Lord father
[42:15] may you come Lord tonight and once again
[42:19] like you took that little lad's lunch
[42:22] Lord father you brought forth from there
[42:26] when it was in your hands and Lord we
[42:29] just certainly want to place our lives
[42:32] in your hands we want to place God every
[42:34] word Lord into your hands and ask that
[42:37] God in our being that Lord may we be
[42:39] guided Lord not only to say father to
[42:43] speak the word of God but Lord also
[42:46] anointed to hear it Lord and to receive
[42:49] it so Lord I ask that God that you would
[42:51] be with us now forgive us Lord of our
[42:54] shortcomings father Lord we ask tonight
[42:58] for your mercies Lord to come Among Us
[43:00] Lord for every need that's gathered here

[43:05] father we just invite you to have your
[43:08] perfect will in this service Lord we
[43:11] commit ourselves Lord into your hands
[43:13] now asking it all for your glory in
[43:16] Jesus name
[43:20] amen amen God bless you tonight if you
[43:23] would uh turn with me to job 2 26 I want
[43:28] to go right back into that that portion
[43:30] of the word that we were looking at
[43:32] there before I want to say what a
[43:34] blessing this past weekend
[43:37] was and uh I know the previous week was
[43:41] such a great blessing too with brother
[43:42] Nathan and brother uh Alexander and I
[43:46] certainly didn't get to um thank you the
[43:50] way that I wanted to when we had service
[43:52] here on Friday night but I certainly
[43:53] want to say thank you for your prayers
[43:56] while we were gone that previous week to
[43:59] uh Arizona and uh God gave us strength
[44:02] to be able to navigate through all the
[44:05] meetings and the services and the Lord
[44:07] just he had his way and that's that's
[44:10] what that's what our desire is and I to
[44:12] me it's always a comfort to know there's
[44:15] people back home that's praying for me
[44:17] amen because we we're together in this
[44:20] and um my wife and I we did when I I
[44:23] flew in there we flew in on got in on
[44:26] Tuesday evening evening and there's a
[44:28] few things that I had to kind of make a
[44:30] decision and I had made a decision that
[44:32] I wanted to go down to Tucson uh because
[44:35] there uh I wanted to go in some of those
[44:38] places where brother brandham went and
[44:41] so uh I got to see some of those it was
[44:43] a busy time but it was worth it was
[44:46] worth it so uh we hiked up I got to hike
[44:49] up to Eagle Rock and I get up there and
[44:52] uh my wife and I and it just was such a
[44:54] blessing to me those are it's a precious
[44:57] this time and so uh even within that I
[45:00] told my wife as we had to then make a 5
[45:02] and 1 half hour trip up to Phoenix and
[45:04] it end up being a long trip unbeknownst
[45:07] to us uh president Trump had come into
[45:10] Phoenix and I thought why is this taken
[45:12] Phoenix is already a big city and
[45:13] they're hard to get around and I thought
[45:15] why is this taking us forever you know
[45:17] forgive me just a little bit of my
[45:19] Humanity because we were just way out
[45:21] and after we get on past it my wife said
[45:23] honey she said I think she said there's
[45:25] president's Trump's having a w in there
[45:27] and I thought oh my no wonder they shut
[45:29] down freeways and but we made it up
[45:32] there and you know I we were a little
[45:33] tired but I said you know it's been
[45:35] worth it I just you know some of those
[45:37] places like that I just I appreciate
[45:39] that God would give us Grace to uh to
[45:41] see them and for me I you know I don't I
[45:44] would share the pictures with you but
[45:46] I'll get preaching on it and there's
[45:49] times that that will come from those
[45:51] places I I sat there and just Gathering
[45:53] inspiration as from Eagle Rock as we
[45:56] were there and you're seeing places that
[45:58] was uncovered and um that was previously
[46:01] hidden and I I just to me it's just it's
[46:03] just a lot that I could say in there but
[46:05] I know God will give us Grace at some
[46:07] time to bring those things out and so I
[46:09] don't mean to keep you standing I just
[46:10] wanted to share my our expressed our
[46:13] gratitude and thanks for your prayers
[46:15] while we were gone and um so we just uh
[46:19] we love you in the Lord and I was so
[46:22] happy to get back home though when we
[46:23] got back home and after the last meeting
[46:25] was over I was ready I told my wife as
[46:26] said I'm ready to go right now I'm ready
[46:29] to go she said we can catch a Redeye
[46:31] flight and you know let's just go you
[46:33] know but uh we also got to see in the
[46:36] lar last night we were there as we drove
[46:38] down to Phoenix and we got to visit with
[46:40] brother and sister walker uh we're there
[46:42] right there in Phoenix now and you
[46:44] probably remember them from when they
[46:45] were here you know he's a podiatrist and
[46:48] things and so we got a chance to
[46:50] fellowship with them uh a little bit
[46:53] later that evening but um anyhow we
[46:55] thank God for his Mercy and man just so
[46:58] thankful for the word of the Lord and
[47:00] how God has ministered to us as his
[47:02] children amen don't you didn't you

[48:01] thou the arm that hath no strength and
[48:05] how hast thou counseled him that hath no
[48:08] wisdom and how hast thou plentifully
[48:11] rewarded the thing as it is to whom hast
[48:16] thou uttered words and whose Spirit came
[48:19] from thee amen may God bless you and
[48:22] bless the reading of the word as you're
[48:24] being seated also want to remind you of
[48:26] the Fellowship dinner here this coming
[48:28] Sunday brother Aaron did you need me to
[48:30] make any more announcements or anything
[48:33] nothing okay um so those onion sister
[48:38] Caroline I waited all Sunday evening for
[48:41] them brother Ray didn't give you the
[48:43] address my
[48:46] goodness see give me change text now or
[48:49] something no but anyhow um sorry about
[48:53] if there was the confusion but I we just
[48:55] want to look we look forward forward to
[48:57] that just a little time to come together
[48:58] and have fellowship and with one another
[49:01] and uh friends that's very important in
[49:04] the
[49:05] body that's something is very very
[49:07] important and so um we just certainly
[49:10] value that very much and um I like the
[49:14] food that you cook but I'll be honest
[49:16] with you if I did not if it was all gone
[49:19] by the time I got up there I would be
[49:21] happy that we were able to come together
[49:24] and I mean that there's been there's
[49:26] been times when we had at the Depot and
[49:28] you know I had just there was little
[49:30] little things to pick from but my heart
[49:31] was so happy a lot of times that I
[49:33] didn't get a chance to eat till later on
[49:35] that evening but I was I mean you know
[49:37] he got little things here and there and
[49:39] uh but anyhow I I really mean that with
[49:42] all my heart um so I want to just speak
[49:46] on this uh once again tonight Brianna if
[49:49] you'll go ahead and kick it over for me
[49:50] here I want to go ahead and speak on
[49:52] this once again tonight and how the Lord
[49:54] has just um really press this these
[49:57] thoughts here upon our heart on being a
[50:00] help uh to the body and I want to just
[50:03] say it you know really u in this way
[50:06] when we look at it that really um the
[50:09] only way that we can really be a help is
[50:13] is when we're really drawing from the
[50:15] Lord as we should and Satan's desire is
[50:19] always constantly to try to um drag us
[50:23] out and you know hinder us and uh want
[50:26] to get us down and and I'll just say it
[50:28] like this throughout the assembly
[50:30] there's times that we all uh face or are
[50:33] in different uh Seasons sometimes even
[50:36] in our own lives we're in a season as an
[50:39] assembly and then churches go through
[50:41] seasons and then as individuals and so
[50:44] we're not always all I mean can you
[50:46] imagine if the whole assembly if
[50:48] everybody was down at the same time but
[50:51] see God God knows even as we're going
[50:53] through tests and trials and where we're
[50:55] at I that that that's be on my pig grate
[50:57] to figure that out I I don't try to but
[50:59] I just know that God he is Mindful and
[51:02] and it's him that's ministering through
[51:05] the body so it's not it's not us and and
[51:09] I say it in this way because when we're
[51:11] thinking of this of being a help to the
[51:13] body with that question in mind how are
[51:15] you helping the body and you know it's
[51:17] like this that a person that if if
[51:20] you're not drawing strength from the
[51:22] Lord then then we really can't be we
[51:24] have no strength to give out we've got
[51:26] to be drawing there's got to be a source
[51:28] that we're drawing from and that's
[51:30] that's the real key because we can get
[51:32] in our mind that I'm going to do this
[51:35] and I'm going to do that I'm going to be
[51:36] a help here but the reality and I think
[51:38] that's wonderful to have objectives and
[51:40] and everything but I I'll just say it
[51:42] like this that as we stay in God's
[51:45] presence and really that staying in
[51:47] God's presence doesn't mean that us
[51:49] staying locked up in a prayer closet
[51:51] somewhere it just means being in tune
[51:53] and in fellowship with God you can be in
[51:56] Fellowship I I believe in our time and
[51:58] stealing away in prayer but I believe
[52:00] that it where Paul would say praying
[52:02] always so if we're praying always
[52:05] there's no way that you can stay in your
[52:06] prayer closet 24 hours out of the day
[52:10] but we can stay in a state of prayer we
[52:12] and with staying in a state of prayer it
[52:14] it there's a sensitivity that comes to
[52:16] where that God will speak to us God can
[52:20] move to influence and direct our lives
[52:23] and and and lead us and it also helps us
[52:26] to be able as we're there in fellowship
[52:29] with him to be able to look Beyond even
[52:32] our own needs and and the conditions
[52:34] that we're surrounded with that would be
[52:36] one of the admonitions not only that
[52:39] Paul would give but one of the things
[52:40] that Paul said that you would fulfill my
[52:43] joy that you would be likeminded and
[52:45] look not every man on his own things but
[52:48] on the things of others and and I think
[52:50] many times that even when we look at the
[52:52] complexities of life and and physical uh
[52:56] emotional spiritual I mean you know for
[52:59] you and I to stand here tonight the
[53:02] Mount of devils that you have had to
[53:04] fight through to set right here tonight
[53:07] uh it's it's just throughout the week
[53:09] and you know you know the whole purpose
[53:11] within it is that Satan doesn't care how
[53:14] many times that he has witnessed you
[53:17] press right on through that he still he
[53:20] can't understand that but he he will
[53:22] still come and he'll try to hinder
[53:24] because Satan knows the power of the
[53:28] word as it comes upon the hearts and
[53:31] lives of the believer that it can
[53:32] actually give you an eye and it does the
[53:35] strength to actually begin to look
[53:38] beyond our circumstance and to believe
[53:41] God for all things he he he knows that
[53:44] when I say he knows that because he has
[53:47] watched You and I by God's grace in our
[53:50] life that it's just unexplainable how
[53:52] when we've walked into a service and
[53:55] then you leave out of a service and
[53:57] there has been such a supernatural touch
[54:00] from God that maybe the words themselves
[54:03] it wasn't word by word but it was just
[54:05] being in God's presence that has so uh
[54:09] moved within our hearts to look Beyond
[54:12] uh the situations and the conditions
[54:14] that we were in and I'm telling you that
[54:17] God not only has done it once but he'll
[54:19] continue to do that to minister the help
[54:23] that you and I have need of and there's
[54:26] many many many many different ways that
[54:29] help can be ministered to like when we
[54:31] look here in this scripture that word
[54:33] help means to sucur uh it means to help
[54:37] or support one and there's many
[54:39] different ways that we can do that and
[54:41] ways that how that the Holy Spirit would
[54:43] lead us to do it so we always want to be
[54:46] sensitive to the leading of the Holy
[54:49] Spirit and I coming back I guess to a a
[54:51] point within it is that how when I begin
[54:54] to just just meditating on these things
[54:56] I I've been going through you know
[54:58] different messages and just meditating
[55:00] on you know that the seeing the value of
[55:03] of living behind the veil and how that
[55:06] Satan's desire is always just to get us
[55:09] clouded up and I don't believe that that
[55:12] any one of us would just um uh I want to
[55:16] say on purpose look Beyond somebody
[55:19] else's need or just Overlook people I
[55:21] don't believe that that that is
[55:23] something that we would do but I believe
[55:26] sometimes we can become a lack of
[55:29] awareness because of where of where the
[55:33] the situations and things of life to
[55:35] where we sometimes just feel like that
[55:37] you know what I'm doing good enough just
[55:39] to take care of
[55:43] me I mean it's true yeah exactly I mean
[55:47] you know i' I've been in those I feel
[55:49] like yeah I'm just just doing good
[55:50] enough just to take care of me and that
[55:52] Satan's desire is to keep us in that
[55:55] Realm because listen friends the Holy
[55:58] Spirit when it's come it you are
[56:00] ordained to be a vessel that he would
[56:03] Express himself through there's many
[56:06] ways that God will Express himself he
[56:09] will Express and display his life
[56:11] through you you and I we are ordained to
[56:14] be as channels God help us to be
[56:18] aware because that's what eternal life
[56:21] is all about it's it's living for others
[56:24] is that right I I I mean these are
[56:26] things that you know in this age that
[56:29] we're in that if Paul would have to
[56:31] admonish us as Believers and I believe
[56:34] he would write it for this day CU he
[56:36] says as you see those days approaching
[56:39] even the more so what assemble
[56:42] yourselves together knowing of the
[56:44] pressures and the conditions that would
[56:47] be present but it's a time to press
[56:49] beyond that and I'm just going to say it
[56:52] like this that God has not called you
[56:54] and I to become robots but it's to live
[56:57] in his presence and to realize that's
[57:00] the value of everything about our life
[57:03] that puts everything in perspective he
[57:06] is the source listen psalms 27 verse1 is
[57:10] a great key it's the very chapter that
[57:13] the Holy Spirit led the prophet to take
[57:15] for the message the Rapture and it is
[57:18] that the Lord is the strength of my life
[57:22] that that that's it right there don't we
[57:24] we don't want the enemy to try to tell
[57:25] us we need to do this or we need to do
[57:27] that but if I can just stay lined up
[57:30] with him and under his influence then
[57:33] God himself will see that my footsteps
[57:36] are ordered in the right way he will
[57:38] help me to be sensitive that at any time
[57:41] he can drop a word my way he can he can
[57:45] use me as an instrument as a tool that's
[57:48] available for
[57:52] himall now let me just refresh our
[57:55] memory here on this this I want to just
[57:57] this this quote I read last week and or
[58:01] about three weeks ago now but brother BR
[58:03] said I'm so glad to know that he can be
[58:07] found amongst the
[58:08] Brokenhearted in our sorrows he's not
[58:12] one that would leave us he stands by us
[58:16] when all has failed and the last hopes
[58:19] of Earthly reaching has come to its end
[58:22] he is still God and he loves us he was
[58:25] he was the the expressing of God and the
[58:28] prophet said oh how I believe that he
[58:31] Longs for his people to be so Anointed
[58:35] with his spirit that we could go to each
[58:38] other in trials in troubles and give the
[58:43] expression of his
[58:46] sympathy I mean I you know there's
[58:48] sympathy that I can have with someone
[58:50] else or even empathy if I've not been
[58:53] through it but you know notice what's
[58:55] called here is that to give his sympathy
[58:58] to somebody else Lord help me to be that
[59:00] sensitive now I know that sometimes we
[59:03] look at these things like this and think
[59:05] man that's not that powerful and that
[59:07] Dynamic if what you mean is that is
[59:10] something that is not illustrious it's
[59:13] not something that is on on the pull pit
[59:15] it's not something that is a show it's
[59:18] not something that everybody would be
[59:20] signing up as far as to do then yes
[59:23] you're exactly right but you see that's
[59:25] exactly how God works in his body that's
[59:28] why you know years and years ago when we
[59:31] spoke on the gifts many times where when
[59:33] individuals say where are the gifts in
[59:35] the church if they'll really be honest
[59:38] what they're asking for is where is the
[59:40] gift of tongues which is the least of
[59:44] them
[59:44] all is that right it's looking for
[59:48] something that well we need to see
[59:49] something here and yet to think about it
[59:52] that the gifts themselves they operate
[59:54] within every l local body but the
[59:57] difference is they are never to be
[1:00:00] advertised or to be purported up that
[1:00:03] I've done this or I've done that because
[1:00:05] God won't share his glory with nobody as
[1:00:08] a matter of fact when that little mother
[1:00:10] when here she was in that in that
[1:00:12] meeting and she got on her heart to pray
[1:00:15] for that that that child that that
[1:00:17] mother had and she just she tried to get
[1:00:20] away from it tried to get away from it
[1:00:21] and finally she walked up and she said
[1:00:24] would you mind if I prayed for your
[1:00:27] little daughter she said now listen
[1:00:29] after I pray for her you still keep your
[1:00:31] prayer card you go right in the
[1:00:34] line and so here she prayed for her now
[1:00:38] you know we've referred to this many
[1:00:40] times she comes on the platform and the
[1:00:42] angel of the Lord moves down and the
[1:00:44] prophet said well I see your little girl
[1:00:47] was sick but but God touched her out
[1:00:49] there when that sister prayed for her
[1:00:51] and brother brandom said it just like
[1:00:53] this he said what it was he said is the
[1:00:56] compassion of that mother was able to
[1:01:00] touch God more than if it would have
[1:01:03] been me
[1:01:06] hall now nobody would have known that
[1:01:09] nobody would have known that but God
[1:01:11] called it out you know I believe God
[1:01:13] Called It Out for Samuel brownie I
[1:01:15] believe God called it out for you and I
[1:01:17] because he will not forget your work and
[1:01:20] labor of love when there is no desire
[1:01:23] for any Earthly credit the desire the
[1:01:26] only thing we want to see I want to see
[1:01:28] lives better when I go somewhere I want
[1:01:30] to see lives lifted up I want to see
[1:01:33] them encouraged is that all right I
[1:01:35] don't want to see lives torn down if I'm
[1:01:37] invited to come in and Minister a
[1:01:39] service I don't want to tear a church up
[1:01:41] that's not the desire the spirit is is
[1:01:43] that it would be edified it would be
[1:01:45] lifted up in Christian love it don't
[1:01:47] mean that sometimes God won't speak
[1:01:49] words that might correct us here or
[1:01:51] there but yet at the same time even when
[1:01:53] you go into your local supermarket I do
[1:01:56] not want to leave that worse than when I
[1:01:58] came
[1:01:59] in
[1:02:01] hello I want to be an encouragement to
[1:02:03] somebody else because our kind words
[1:02:06] might be the only kind words that they
[1:02:08] would ever
[1:02:09] hear you remember years ago when brother
[1:02:12] Daryl Ward was doing one of our meetings
[1:02:13] in May and he gave the testimony of how
[1:02:16] that here was a man and this this wasn't
[1:02:18] even among I don't believe among even
[1:02:20] Believers but here was a man and here he
[1:02:22] was you know homeless and conditions and
[1:02:25] whatever more and here he was he was
[1:02:27] sitting right outside of Dunkin Donuts
[1:02:30] well anyhow I won't make no comment
[1:02:32] there but he was sitting right outside
[1:02:34] there uh you know and here he was
[1:02:36] sitting out there and and someone be to
[1:02:39] just have a little feeling on their
[1:02:41] heart and they went over and they
[1:02:44] actually provided for him uh uh you know
[1:02:47] something to eat and something to drink
[1:02:49] he turned around and wrote on the
[1:02:51] receipt and left it on their table when
[1:02:53] he left and said thank you for your
[1:02:56] kindness because today I was ready to
[1:02:59] take my own
[1:03:01] life see who would think
[1:03:04] Donuts Dunkin Donut coffee I mean who
[1:03:08] would think but it wasn't the donuts it
[1:03:11] wasn't the
[1:03:12] coffee are you hearing me it wasn't that
[1:03:15] it was that expression of kindness I I
[1:03:18] wonder how deep that went to where he
[1:03:21] was able to look Beyond and say wait a
[1:03:23] minute where I think there's no use
[1:03:25] nothing going on I don't know what had
[1:03:27] happened in the man's life I don't know
[1:03:29] what kind of luck that he had fallen on
[1:03:31] but I know one thing that God laid it
[1:03:33] upon somebody's heart to do something
[1:03:35] for him to encourage him
[1:03:39] amen
[1:03:41] hallelujah
[1:03:43] wow how did we get
[1:03:46] here but notice go to each
[1:03:50] other in trials and in troubles
[1:03:56] and give the expression of his sympathy
[1:03:59] as it pours prise God from our heart see
[1:04:02] see that fellowship with him is where
[1:04:05] that enrich comes in our life you know
[1:04:08] brother Ram describes that human heart
[1:04:10] he said it's like a a bowl of golden oil
[1:04:14] called love remember in the Tabernacle
[1:04:17] in the wilderness they had to replenish
[1:04:19] that oil you see this is why that
[1:04:22] there's one feeling with many many ref
[1:04:25] feelings amen this is why the refilling
[1:04:27] of the holy spirit this is something
[1:04:29] that we don't have to wait well I have
[1:04:30] to wait till the next camp or I have to
[1:04:32] why to wait you can have a refilling
[1:04:34] every day of your life and that's really
[1:04:37] that's the strength that's what helps us
[1:04:39] that's what keeps us from being prickly
[1:04:41] that's what helps us to be sensitive and
[1:04:44] actually have the sympathy that God
[1:04:47] himself has toward us that when I was
[1:04:50] when I was lost he found me when I was
[1:04:52] down and out he picked me up you see
[1:04:55] sometimes we get away no wonder God
[1:04:57] would write it over and over in the book
[1:05:00] of Deuteronomy for them to remember
[1:05:03] where he brought them
[1:05:06] from oh God help us as it pours from our
[1:05:10] hearts that's been born of his Spirit to
[1:05:13] reflect in the church the love of the
[1:05:16] Living
[1:05:19] God you love
[1:05:21] himen amen now notice you know there's
[1:05:25] many different ways as I said here
[1:05:27] moments ago there's many ways to give
[1:05:31] help right and the ways when we want to
[1:05:35] give help to someone that is without
[1:05:39] strength there's many different ways
[1:05:41] that that that can be done or or one
[1:05:43] that is without power just no might
[1:05:46] there's something that's just you know
[1:05:48] there's a need that's there now remember
[1:05:50] job is speaking these things because
[1:05:54] those that have come to him his friends
[1:05:57] they didn't mean to do job
[1:06:00] harm they didn't mean to do that I I I
[1:06:02] don't believe that I I believe they had
[1:06:04] the best
[1:06:05] intentions but remember as we looked at
[1:06:07] there a few weeks ago what it was was
[1:06:09] missing was
[1:06:11] discernment they had no
[1:06:13] discernment as one writer calls it he
[1:06:16] says these guys were like eye surgeons
[1:06:18] trying to perform heart
[1:06:20] surgery they they in other words they
[1:06:22] had they may have had look some of the
[1:06:24] things they said were actually
[1:06:27] word they were word we we've went over
[1:06:30] that here within the previous years they
[1:06:32] were words but it actually was not in
[1:06:34] the right season and it wasn't applied
[1:06:38] correctly oh I thank God for his mercies
[1:06:40] in this hour not only did God send you
[1:06:43] and I a word but the same holy spirit
[1:06:45] that has sent this message is the same
[1:06:48] holy spirit that will give you and I the
[1:06:50] unction of the season and the hour that
[1:06:53] we're living in I'm many knows you can
[1:06:56] testify of it that even when we're at
[1:06:58] right here in 2024 there has been an
[1:07:01] advancement in the message of the hour
[1:07:04] We're Not beyond the message of the hour
[1:07:07] but the message has become more clear
[1:07:09] Christ has become more real and we are
[1:07:12] seeing ourselves more clearly than we've
[1:07:15] ever seen ourselves before what is it
[1:07:17] there's an
[1:07:19] advancement
[1:07:21] hall hallelu hallelujah so with in this
[1:07:26] this is God God comes in a way to help
[1:07:28] you and I I I think how God would do it
[1:07:31] in such a way he would give something to
[1:07:33] help you and I like brother Ram talked
[1:07:35] about that man he said that here he
[1:07:37] comes he said and he walks up to a man
[1:07:39] who's a roofer and he's nailing down the
[1:07:41] shingles with a hammer he said now if he
[1:07:44] comes up to him with that nail gun nail
[1:07:46] gun and he tells him you don't know
[1:07:48] nothing get out of the way he said that
[1:07:51] man probably won't receive it he said
[1:07:53] but if you'll just say my What a Wonder
[1:07:55] ful job you're doing no doubt he is
[1:07:57] doing a good job he's doing it for a
[1:07:58] living but he says then ask him have you
[1:08:00] ever seen one of these things right here
[1:08:03] he said it it might be able to help you
[1:08:05] he said I'll tell you what I'll do I'll
[1:08:06] just leave it with you brother BR said
[1:08:09] see it ain't nothing wrong with the
[1:08:10] product we have the Holy Ghost he said
[1:08:14] sometimes it's our
[1:08:16] presentation of the product we have I
[1:08:19] tell you listen friends if there's we've
[1:08:21] got the real Holy Ghost it ought to be a
[1:08:23] product that we can leave with someone
[1:08:25] you say what do you mean by that I mean
[1:08:27] to where that when we leave the presence
[1:08:29] of one another there ought to be such an
[1:08:32] atmosphere about our life where the
[1:08:34] sympathy of God Is So poured down into
[1:08:37] our life it leaves an impression it may
[1:08:40] not even be the words that you have said
[1:08:43] but it can just be the atmosphere and
[1:08:46] the love and the kindness the substance
[1:08:48] that people feel from those
[1:08:51] words BR said see this is all about it's
[1:08:55] something of an
[1:08:57] advancement now watch when we look at
[1:09:00] this here I want to just take just a few
[1:09:02] moments here tonight and I want to just
[1:09:05] say to you in this way we want to look
[1:09:08] at one of the ways of really being a
[1:09:11] help is
[1:09:13] words
[1:09:15] words
[1:09:17] words now I want you to watch this how
[1:09:19] brother Bram says this in
[1:09:21] desperation he just got done preaching
[1:09:23] the message token said father God our
[1:09:25] whole life is wrapped in that for it's
[1:09:29] you and you are our life I tell you if
[1:09:32] there's one thing to be wrapped
[1:09:34] in it's him it's this message it's this
[1:09:38] Revelation let it wrap me up amen
[1:09:41] because getting wrapped up in him it'll
[1:09:43] change this caterpillar to a butterfly
[1:09:46] let me get wrapped up in him let me I
[1:09:48] don't want my life wrapped up in other
[1:09:50] things notice he says there is some here
[1:09:52] Lord that even holds this token that I
[1:09:54] spoke
[1:09:55] they have possessed that token and yet
[1:09:57] they're sick I want to speak tonight on
[1:10:01] giving them courage to encourage them to
[1:10:05] take that god-given rights they have a
[1:10:08] right to defeat the Devil he's already
[1:10:11] defeated and he's just bluffing them I'm
[1:10:14] claiming them Father now notice he can't
[1:10:17] defeat the Devil for
[1:10:20] them right brother B says you always got
[1:10:22] to check because if there's not enough
[1:10:24] Faith to actually caus that to move he
[1:10:27] said then there won't be faith enough to
[1:10:29] keep it from returning back is that
[1:10:31] right so notice what brother Bram is
[1:10:33] doing he's got confidence in the word
[1:10:36] Lord help me that I can say something
[1:10:38] that would encourage them to take their
[1:10:42] god-given
[1:10:43] rights oh my notice he says now help me
[1:10:48] to speak the word you speak through me
[1:10:53] Lord with a few notes that I got wrote
[1:10:56] down here and little scriptures wrote
[1:10:57] out I pray that you'll help me Lord and
[1:11:01] get in the word and give them faith for
[1:11:05] the glory of God hallelujah notice help
[1:11:09] me to speak the word Lord you come and
[1:11:12] get in the
[1:11:14] word it isn't we understand it isn't the
[1:11:17] amount of words that we could say it's
[1:11:20] just saying the right
[1:11:21] words I said God help me help us to say
[1:11:24] the right words
[1:11:25] is that right help
[1:11:27] me now you know when we left out of here
[1:11:29] a few weeks ago and I just begin to
[1:11:32] think when I got out of here and and um
[1:11:35] you know I was just thinking on on on
[1:11:37] something here of within these words and
[1:11:39] how that words matter and I begin to
[1:11:42] think about you know of a shot you might
[1:11:44] think well how in the world does that
[1:11:46] tie in well I I don't know just how God
[1:11:48] deals with me but let me just tell you
[1:11:50] something about this when I was a little
[1:11:52] guy and I I say that in you know ways
[1:11:55] that but I could have been little when I
[1:11:56] was a little guy I seemed like every
[1:11:59] time I went to the where my mom worked
[1:12:01] they had the health health department
[1:12:02] underneath it and every time I went
[1:12:05] there it seemed like that short little
[1:12:07] nurse that she might have been about
[1:12:09] this High it seemed like she always
[1:12:10] wanted to give me a
[1:12:12] shot and then it wasn't just your shots
[1:12:15] for school I mean anytime you were
[1:12:17] sick I hated shots I would go ask them
[1:12:21] I'd say look and before I'd even tell
[1:12:24] them my symptoms even when we moved to
[1:12:26] another doctor I'd ask them I'd say are
[1:12:28] you going to give me a shot they didn't
[1:12:30] know my
[1:12:32] symptoms then as I got older I got into
[1:12:35] high school and things and sometimes I'd
[1:12:37] get sick playing football or whatever
[1:12:38] more and I'd ask them can I have a shot
[1:12:41] that changed man that changed i' ask him
[1:12:44] for a shot I'm going to tell you
[1:12:46] something that happened to me here oh I
[1:12:48] don't know it might have been I don't
[1:12:49] know maybe 10 years ago now I don't know
[1:12:51] but I had a you know I had a sinus
[1:12:53] infection and and they were going to
[1:12:55] give me a a shot of an antibiotic I said
[1:12:58] yes I've had this same antibiotic many
[1:13:01] times I would call its name if I
[1:13:03] wouldn't butcher it but I I've had it
[1:13:06] and and and and and when I I it's a
[1:13:08] thick it's like a thick the needle's a
[1:13:10] little bit bigger I mean to me the
[1:13:12] needle seem like this but that needle
[1:13:15] when they came you know with it yes I
[1:13:17] want I want something to get it started
[1:13:19] I I've had them do that when I've been
[1:13:20] doing winter youth Retreats and maybe
[1:13:22] got sick in Tennessee and they'd give me
[1:13:23] shots and things like that so I said
[1:13:25] yeah give me a shot Well the lady goes
[1:13:27] out of the room and that Tech and she
[1:13:29] comes back in and you know they go to
[1:13:31] give you that shot soon as she put that
[1:13:33] thing in and gave me that shot I hit the
[1:13:36] ground man pow I thought what in the
[1:13:39] world has happened I mean I had such
[1:13:42] pain such pain I did not know at that
[1:13:46] moment things was flashing through my
[1:13:48] mind I thought am I going to have to
[1:13:50] call my wife oh no some of you are
[1:13:52] probably saying I hope I don't have
[1:13:53] shots tomorrow but but let me just tell
[1:13:56] you what happened with it so when I I
[1:13:59] that lady came back in and then the
[1:14:00] doctor came back into the room after I
[1:14:02] talked to her I said I don't know what's
[1:14:04] going on I said but man I am in so much
[1:14:06] pain I may have to call my wife to come
[1:14:08] get
[1:14:09] me she
[1:14:11] said I'm sorry she said I forgot to put
[1:14:14] the numbing
[1:14:17] agent on the end of that needless to say
[1:14:22] I've never forgot
[1:14:25] because now when they going to give me a
[1:14:27] shot even when I've been down in
[1:14:29] Tennessee or somewhere else I'll ask
[1:14:31] them hey you got the numbing agent on it
[1:14:33] I just ask him because it sent me clear
[1:14:35] to the ground I'm saying in this way
[1:14:38] that it was something that I
[1:14:41] needed but it didn't have the right
[1:14:45] Administration with it this is why the
[1:14:49] Bible says speaking the truth in
[1:14:53] love this is where not just words that
[1:14:56] matter this is where sometimes that
[1:14:58] Satan would want to try to even trap us
[1:15:00] up it's not just saying as far as the
[1:15:03] right words but it's those words being
[1:15:06] seasoned with the love of God seasoned
[1:15:10] with the Holy Spirit and sometimes that
[1:15:12] requires us to bite our tongue until the
[1:15:15] appropriate
[1:15:17] season right is that right sometimes it
[1:15:21] requires us something sometimes of
[1:15:23] things that we might see or think we see
[1:15:26] or whatever more but sometimes sometimes
[1:15:29] words listen friends we've all been
[1:15:31] guilty of this we've all been guilty a
[1:15:33] word that maybe we've taken the wind out
[1:15:35] of somebody else or we've gotten a
[1:15:37] response that we didn't think we were
[1:15:38] going to get and sometimes you know what
[1:15:40] if we really step back and look at it
[1:15:42] and say was the right agent applied with
[1:15:46] the words that were given
[1:15:50] right oh my so we want words that are in
[1:15:57] season remember when we look here in the
[1:15:59] scripture the Bible says a man hath Joy
[1:16:03] by the answer of his mouth and a word
[1:16:07] spoken in due season how good is
[1:16:11] it now remember remember we some weeks
[1:16:14] ago when we were dealing with David and
[1:16:16] Abigail remember when David was going up
[1:16:18] there to take business with naboth
[1:16:20] naboth had scorned him right but Abigail
[1:16:23] was moved by the Lord and she came and
[1:16:28] spoke to
[1:16:29] him and those words that were spoken in
[1:16:32] season turned his wrath to a place that
[1:16:36] he could reflect before you make this
[1:16:38] action before you make this decision
[1:16:41] you've got swords on your side you're
[1:16:43] getting ready to go full steam but let's
[1:16:45] reflect here a moment because God's
[1:16:47] going to bring you to the throne he's
[1:16:49] not going to fail what he said he would
[1:16:51] do but what you don't want is having
[1:16:53] regret in your heart amen that was a
[1:16:57] word spoken in due season it was a good
[1:17:00] word it turned David's wrath yes it is
[1:17:03] that right now it would have maybe
[1:17:05] seemed so unfitting here is Abigail here
[1:17:07] she is coming to the king and is going
[1:17:09] to turn his words but sometimes it's the
[1:17:12] things that we would least expect are
[1:17:14] the very things if we will take hold of
[1:17:16] that word it can be the very things that
[1:17:18] would cause us to think and to consider
[1:17:22] before we make actions true that's true
[1:17:26] amen hallelujah now watch this a word
[1:17:29] spoken in season remember brother BR
[1:17:31] would tell us like this you know that
[1:17:33] you know he said any Minister he said
[1:17:36] you know it's not you that's doing the
[1:17:38] speaking he said you never preached a
[1:17:40] sermon in your life it's the Holy Spirit
[1:17:43] preaching through you I mean it's very
[1:17:47] simple I mean a man can lay on all sorts
[1:17:49] of quotes and scriptures and everything
[1:17:52] else but it takes the inspiration of the
[1:17:55] Holy Spirit now let me tell you this I
[1:17:57] believe that it's the inspiration of the
[1:17:59] holy spirit that has to inspire a man on
[1:18:02] what to even begin to minister what are
[1:18:04] the needs and how do I approach this and
[1:18:06] I'm just going to be honest with you
[1:18:08] there's ways and there's things that God
[1:18:10] will lay upon our heart in a certain
[1:18:13] time that it seems like it does not why
[1:18:15] would this be dealt with or why would we
[1:18:18] say this or why would this or God would
[1:18:20] say stop and pause right here in this
[1:18:22] series and take this direction it may
[1:18:25] not make sense to our minds but God by
[1:18:28] his inspiration knows just what you and
[1:18:31] I have need
[1:18:34] of Hallelujah I tell you I've learned
[1:18:37] when I say I've learned I've learned to
[1:18:39] just trust him I've learned to follow
[1:18:42] him I've learned to just rely on him and
[1:18:45] look that don't mean that everything is
[1:18:47] easy it don't mean that there ain't
[1:18:49] battles but I'm telling you when it
[1:18:51] comes down to it it's God that has a
[1:18:53] word that's in season think about it
[1:18:56] this is why the prophet said if I spoke
[1:18:59] um a Lutheran word over you it would
[1:19:01] have no effect a Methodist word or a
[1:19:05] Pentecostal word it would have no effect
[1:19:07] on you because this is bride time this
[1:19:10] this is a this is a time that calls for
[1:19:13] a bright message a revelation straight
[1:19:16] from the Throne of
[1:19:18] God that's what it calls for so God
[1:19:22] knows what you and I have need of in the
[1:19:24] season that we're in notice job's
[1:19:28] testimony he said to the men in an
[1:19:31] earlier chapter I also could speak as
[1:19:34] you do if your soul were in my soul
[1:19:37] instead I could Heap up words against
[1:19:39] you and shake my head at you
[1:19:43] right cuz you know sometimes what can be
[1:19:46] the tendency depending on how we're made
[1:19:48] up is to give
[1:19:50] lectures well some of us would never be
[1:19:53] promoted as intellect uals or professors
[1:19:56] but we know how to give lectures now
[1:19:57] listen friends don't confuse me there's
[1:19:59] sometimes where there's things in the
[1:20:01] right season for things to be
[1:20:04] ministered you understand what I'm
[1:20:06] saying there's sometimes a right season
[1:20:08] and there's things that we learn as we
[1:20:10] go along of what needs to be ministered
[1:20:12] to it that moment is just an
[1:20:14] encouragement and a strength because
[1:20:16] they're already down where they're at
[1:20:18] and God will supply the ample time of
[1:20:20] when not to give the lecture but to give
[1:20:23] instruction
[1:20:25] is that right we see the prophet he took
[1:20:28] that same approach right down through
[1:20:30] the message now watch what what job said
[1:20:32] behold but I would strengthen you with
[1:20:35] my mouth and the moving of my lips
[1:20:38] should assuage your grief in other words
[1:20:42] it would cause your grief to be
[1:20:48] restrained job was a channel he was a
[1:20:51] true prophet of God and I'm going to say
[1:20:54] this to you you and I are called to be
[1:20:56] real channels of God Amen now think
[1:20:59] about it we don't think about just being
[1:21:01] a channel does anybody know the name of
[1:21:04] the lady who cleaned out the barn swept
[1:21:08] it picked up all the manure and had a
[1:21:10] meeting but we know the man who end up
[1:21:12] getting saved wasn't even a great crowd
[1:21:15] even came to that meeting when you
[1:21:16] really get to reading about it right
[1:21:18] there was only a few people one one
[1:21:20] shaggy-haired boy in cover Halls that
[1:21:22] walked down there and gave his life to
[1:21:23] the Lord we know his name
[1:21:25] Dwight El moody right but what was she
[1:21:29] she was a channel now she didn't all of
[1:21:32] a sudden rent Billboards and say hey
[1:21:33] wait a
[1:21:34] minute him it's because of
[1:21:37] me she was a
[1:21:40] channel and being a channel it allowed
[1:21:43] God to move with inspiration upon her
[1:21:46] life to be moved to minister to a need
[1:21:50] that was present in that community in
[1:21:53] that life and notice how God would work
[1:21:56] even where with job that job himself
[1:21:58] would be a channel not just of the
[1:22:01] revelation of God to come through in
[1:22:04] that hour brother Ram would deal with
[1:22:06] that and I have heard but now I see man
[1:22:07] you talking about using the word
[1:22:09] inspiration remember he would tell us
[1:22:11] job had a way of getting himself out of
[1:22:13] the way job lived by that inspiration it
[1:22:15] was inspiration or divine revelation
[1:22:18] that he had received from God but not
[1:22:20] only did he have the
[1:22:23] inspiration with being able to read the
[1:22:26] heavens not only did he have inspiration
[1:22:29] into the spiritual things but he was a
[1:22:31] man that through all of his walk with
[1:22:33] God he had a life that was inspired to
[1:22:37] be able to take account of the needs of
[1:22:40] others Glory because when he's asking
[1:22:43] these questions from our text he's not
[1:22:45] asking them as far as to promote himself
[1:22:49] he's letting them know this is what you
[1:22:52] should have been about
[1:22:54] this is what you should have been doing
[1:22:57] notice in Job chapter 4 it says behold
[1:23:01] now this is their testimony earlier
[1:23:03] chapter thou Hast instructed many to job
[1:23:06] this is what they're saying thou H has
[1:23:08] strengthened the weak hands thy words
[1:23:11] have uphold in him that was Fallen what
[1:23:14] a
[1:23:15] testimony thy words have up him that was
[1:23:18] Fallen yet upheld them and you have
[1:23:21] strengthened the feeble needs in the
[1:23:23] Amplified verse four means your words
[1:23:25] have held firm him who was
[1:23:29] falling
[1:23:31] Lord want say it like this God help us
[1:23:34] to have words that cause forward
[1:23:36] movement am amen you see in the in the
[1:23:40] army of
[1:23:42] God Retreat right going
[1:23:46] backwards that's yeah there's no such
[1:23:48] thing that's that's not it's just go
[1:23:51] forward see the way that the word of God
[1:23:54] goes it goes forward even let me just
[1:23:57] say it to you like this even when God
[1:23:59] deals with our heart and we have to
[1:24:01] repent and there's things that we repent
[1:24:03] about you know we're not going backward
[1:24:05] it's actually going forward when the
[1:24:08] Holy Spirit deals with our hearts maybe
[1:24:10] if your heart's condemning you and
[1:24:11] finally you come to a spot and say wait
[1:24:13] a minute I'm not going to carry this
[1:24:15] condemnation no
[1:24:17] longer there is a fountain that's opened
[1:24:19] in the House of
[1:24:21] David there is there there is
[1:24:23] forgiveness there is deliverance and the
[1:24:25] Bible said if we confess our sins he is
[1:24:29] faithful and just to forgive us you see
[1:24:32] that's a principle of God's word that
[1:24:34] promotes going forward
[1:24:38] amen I want you to think about this my
[1:24:40] goodness some weeks ago this I got a
[1:24:42] hold this scripture about turn me
[1:24:46] around a
[1:24:48] word fitly spoken Hallelujah is like
[1:24:52] apples of gold in pictures of
[1:24:57] silver all you can see is deity in
[1:25:01] Redemption but the word fitly here this
[1:25:04] is what really had me turned around the
[1:25:07] word fitly when you look it up it is the
[1:25:10] same word that is used to describe the
[1:25:15] wheels that Ezekiel Saw the wheels that
[1:25:19] were there when his train filled the
[1:25:21] temple that Isaiah saw fitly means the
[1:25:24] will so what is it we want a word that
[1:25:27] speaks of going forward a word that
[1:25:30] encourage forward because remember the
[1:25:32] Bible said wherever they went any of
[1:25:34] those for anointings where did they go
[1:25:36] the Bible said when the spirit came into
[1:25:38] the wheels the wheels were moved and
[1:25:41] what it say is that these go forward
[1:25:44] they never go
[1:25:46] backward the anointing that lays upon
[1:25:49] the word that's why we're not under that
[1:25:51] man anointing Pentecost was under the
[1:25:53] man anoint oting right but through the
[1:25:56] opening of the word now here comes the
[1:25:59] eagle anointing upon the Bride of Jesus
[1:26:02] Christ it's going forward under the
[1:26:05] anointing and characteristic of the holy
[1:26:07] spirit in this hour notice it's a word
[1:26:10] that has an anointing upon it to put the
[1:26:14] people of God In Motion for
[1:26:17] Rapture it's a word that is fitly spoken
[1:26:21] amen and when it's fitly spoken all you
[1:26:24] will see is deity in redeemed
[1:26:28] vessels apples of gold and pictures of
[1:26:31] silver oh glory be to God yeah apples
[1:26:33] you're the apple of his
[1:26:38] eye glory be to God now watch
[1:26:41] this the Bible says the preacher sought
[1:26:45] to find out acceptable
[1:26:47] words and that which was written was
[1:26:50] upright even words of
[1:26:52] truth right now this is where it comes
[1:26:56] down to words that would be of a
[1:27:01] help help me
[1:27:05] Lord remember even with Paul when he
[1:27:07] came and they wanted to continue to try
[1:27:10] to catch him in different
[1:27:12] ways Paul stood there when they came and
[1:27:15] here's the Pharisees and
[1:27:17] Sadducees right here A whole group
[1:27:20] that's United against him and Paul be
[1:27:24] begins to
[1:27:25] speak of his lineage in Israel and he
[1:27:29] says I
[1:27:31] am of the Pharisees one who believes in
[1:27:35] the resurrection of the Dead you know
[1:27:36] what he did he just halfed that
[1:27:37] congregation in
[1:27:40] half half of them that was ready to they
[1:27:42] were all one big gain to get him but the
[1:27:44] wisdom of God gave him the wisdom for
[1:27:47] that
[1:27:48] moment is that right then even when it
[1:27:51] came you know to to the Philippian
[1:27:53] Jailer everything else Paul never called
[1:27:55] he never took out his Roman passport at
[1:27:58] any at just any time but by the unction
[1:28:01] of the Holy Spirit he pulled it out at
[1:28:04] the right time it wasn't something that
[1:28:06] like some card you know where he had
[1:28:08] hidden back he was getting ready to play
[1:28:09] it no Paul had no thoughts about that
[1:28:12] but when it came to that God told him
[1:28:14] and gave him an unction to use that pull
[1:28:17] that out at that time how are you doing
[1:28:19] this to me as a Roman
[1:28:22] citizen see God had a reason for it a
[1:28:24] purpose so it was the right words in the
[1:28:27] right season amen and so sometimes the
[1:28:30] acceptable words remember though
[1:28:33] remember brother Ram tells us in Christ
[1:28:34] the mystery he preaches a prisoner
[1:28:36] before that and he keeps coming back to
[1:28:38] that story of how that he said that you
[1:28:40] know that woman that was possessed that
[1:28:42] suser and how she was going around
[1:28:44] behind him you know she was announcing
[1:28:46] that you know these been me men be of
[1:28:49] God and on and on and Paul said he knew
[1:28:52] brother said Paul said Paul knew that he
[1:28:54] had the power to cast that thing out but
[1:28:58] he said he was such a prisoner that he
[1:29:01] waited on the leading of the holy
[1:29:03] spirit is that right so God allowed free
[1:29:06] advertising for a few
[1:29:11] days a word spoken at the right time it
[1:29:15] didn't mean that that wasn't hard upon
[1:29:17] Paul no more then let me get it down
[1:29:19] where we're at sometimes there's things
[1:29:21] that we might feel pressed we might feel
[1:29:24] op pressed to say maybe it's to family
[1:29:26] maybe it's to son or daughter maybe it's
[1:29:28] a husband or wife but this is a real
[1:29:31] true application God help us to find the
[1:29:34] acceptable
[1:29:35] words I mean many of us have lost a
[1:29:38] loved
[1:29:39] one we've lost different
[1:29:42] ones I I don't know why it is you know
[1:29:45] sometimes you know when we're coming I I
[1:29:48] don't know I mean a lot of times I just
[1:29:50] be honest with you I don't know what to
[1:29:51] say so you know what I don't say nothing
[1:29:53] see I'm I'm praying for you cuz
[1:29:55] sometimes we can say some Sometimes some
[1:29:57] of the things you ever had people come
[1:29:58] to you and say I know just exactly how
[1:30:00] you're feeling no you don't no you don't
[1:30:03] now I don't mean let me let me just
[1:30:05] clarify that because I've had I've I've
[1:30:07] got people that I'm associated with that
[1:30:09] you can actually go to express something
[1:30:11] like Brother Ray I'm praying for you I I
[1:30:13] I I I you know there's a little bit I I
[1:30:15] can't identify exactly where it's at but
[1:30:17] you know it's just something in my heart
[1:30:18] about it but I'll be praying for you God
[1:30:20] I I I can't maybe understand what you're
[1:30:22] going through but you know sometimes
[1:30:24] there's been individuals say no you
[1:30:25] don't no you don't you can't and in the
[1:30:27] reality of it is sometimes it's been
[1:30:28] things that you've actually been
[1:30:31] through but sometimes the words that
[1:30:33] we're hunting for and looking for and
[1:30:35] sometimes we feel like we have to say
[1:30:37] something but I tell you the greatest
[1:30:38] thing we can ever say is I'm praying for
[1:30:41] you because you might know exactly what
[1:30:43] they're going through maybe some sort of
[1:30:45] a lost loved one and sibling or what you
[1:30:47] you might know exactly but just say you
[1:30:48] know what I'm praying for you praying
[1:30:50] for the family praying for you that God
[1:30:52] would be merciful to you
[1:30:55] God help us to find acceptable words but
[1:30:59] words that also are of
[1:31:01] truth right brother BR tells us over and
[1:31:04] over when he preached his first
[1:31:06] sermon he says this and you must be born
[1:31:09] again
[1:31:10] 1961 he says that in convinced and
[1:31:12] concerned different places he got up
[1:31:15] remember you most of you remember the
[1:31:16] story he got up and man he was so
[1:31:18] emotional all he cried and everything
[1:31:22] else and at at the end of the
[1:31:25] service he walked over Dr Davis said
[1:31:28] that is the most terrible I have ever
[1:31:32] heard right thank God he was honest with
[1:31:36] him you know why Dr Davis had experience
[1:31:39] he said you gave them people a bunch of
[1:31:42] emotion you never gave them one
[1:31:46] word he said when I was a lawyer then he
[1:31:49] went into his own experience he said
[1:31:50] when I was a lawyer I was arguing cases
[1:31:52] he said the first case I ever cried he
[1:31:54] said I got up there he said man I just
[1:31:56] oh you don't know this Widow you don't
[1:31:58] know this one and begin to just all that
[1:32:00] and he said finally the the the the
[1:32:02] other attorney stood up and said your
[1:32:03] honor how much more of this nonsense are
[1:32:06] you going to put up with and the honor
[1:32:09] just got up and just threw it on out and
[1:32:12] Dr Davis brought that down he said you
[1:32:15] know what it was he said that other
[1:32:16] attorney had spoke to him and said all
[1:32:18] you were doing was a bunch of
[1:32:20] emotion you weren't giving any law
[1:32:24] and this is where listen Dr Davis that
[1:32:28] right there was a credit to brother
[1:32:29] brandom's growth because what he told
[1:32:32] brother brandom is if you if in the only
[1:32:35] thing that counts is the word you've got
[1:32:38] to lay the word out you've got to lay
[1:32:40] the law out you've got to lay because
[1:32:42] that's the only thing that will produce
[1:32:44] faith is the word of
[1:32:47] God right acceptable words at the right
[1:32:52] time
[1:32:54] acceptable words notice how Isaiah would
[1:32:56] say this Lord the Lord God hath given me
[1:33:00] the tongue of the
[1:33:02] learned that I should know how this is
[1:33:06] powerful to speak a word in season to
[1:33:10] him that is weary now notice not just a
[1:33:12] word but
[1:33:15] how right
[1:33:20] how be and he says he wenth more morning
[1:33:24] by morning he wenth my ear to hear as
[1:33:29] the
[1:33:31] Learned Glory God has taught me how
[1:33:36] Glory how now you know sometimes within
[1:33:39] that I I know sometimes we no doubt
[1:33:43] sometimes with all of us maybe I'll just
[1:33:45] speak it in that way that there's little
[1:33:46] times of things that we had judged to be
[1:33:50] insignificant or what would this word
[1:33:52] mean I don't know I I don't even know
[1:33:54] how I listen I don't even know how to
[1:33:56] approach the situation I don't know how
[1:33:58] to approach one there's phone calls that
[1:34:00] I've had to make I don't know how to
[1:34:01] approach
[1:34:03] that but you know what the first thing
[1:34:06] the only thing you can do is is just
[1:34:07] wait on him and
[1:34:09] listen and just listen and any words of
[1:34:12] comfort that can be ministered you don't
[1:34:14] have to come up with some great big
[1:34:16] flowery words or something that has to
[1:34:18] well I'm not a minister God you don't
[1:34:20] have to be a
[1:34:21] minister right I don't know how to put
[1:34:23] it all together you don't have to know
[1:34:24] how to put it all together but you can
[1:34:26] be a channel that God can work right
[1:34:28] through to minister to that other life
[1:34:32] anybody believe this oh yeah
[1:34:35] hallu I mean I think I just read across
[1:34:38] some quotes here today brother Ram
[1:34:40] talking about when he had come to the
[1:34:41] spot of that nervous breakdown and he
[1:34:43] calls a man out in the audience brother
[1:34:45] Gro he said brother Gro and his brother
[1:34:47] he said when I was nearly beside myself
[1:34:49] he said they ministered to me during
[1:34:52] that time night and day he said now he
[1:34:55] said I was out in the cornfield praying
[1:34:57] and brother Gro came out there wrapped
[1:34:59] his arm around me and said Papa God help
[1:35:02] brother brandham at this time he he help
[1:35:04] him Lord may you give him strength he's
[1:35:06] Beyond himself and brother Bram said
[1:35:08] brother Gro I trust that one of these
[1:35:10] mornings we'll be able to stand on the
[1:35:12] other side with our arms around one
[1:35:18] another how God help me to say the word
[1:35:23] how
[1:35:25] I say that as a father I say it as a
[1:35:27] husband I say it as a pastor and
[1:35:30] anything else you help me to know
[1:35:33] how cuz we are privileged in this hour
[1:35:36] to have the
[1:35:38] word but it's
[1:35:41] how
[1:35:42] how how right the whole message the
[1:35:46] token brother Bram takes that through
[1:35:47] the token and it's an application time
[1:35:50] it's an application hour now watch this
[1:35:54] God sees little things how many believe
[1:35:55] God sees little
[1:35:57] things little things he said he's not
[1:36:00] quick to forget your work and labor of
[1:36:01] love God won't Overlook it now watch I
[1:36:03] want to just read these little simple
[1:36:05] statements to you because sometimes
[1:36:06] that's where the devil gets us in a trap
[1:36:08] of well uh you ain't nothing Well none
[1:36:10] of us are
[1:36:11] anything well your words you know what
[1:36:13] God ain't going to talk you out of
[1:36:15] encouraging somebody that's right you
[1:36:16] can just take that to the bank and cash
[1:36:18] and it won't
[1:36:19] bounce God will God will never but he's
[1:36:22] trying to minister to somebody else
[1:36:25] through you and said do you mind if I
[1:36:27] borrow your phone for a minute do you m
[1:36:30] mind if I borrow your mouth for a minute
[1:36:33] do you mind you know I gave you those
[1:36:34] hands would you mind if I use them to
[1:36:37] text something to somebody would you
[1:36:40] mind if I took a little bit of the
[1:36:42] resources I gave you to send a card to
[1:36:44] somebody else would you
[1:36:49] [Music]
[1:36:50] mind Little Things
[1:36:54] brother B says it like this it's been
[1:36:56] said by our Lord heavens and earth will
[1:36:58] pass away but my word shall never pass
[1:37:00] away that's how infallible the word of
[1:37:02] God is no matter how small many times we
[1:37:05] think just because anything is small
[1:37:07] that it's not noticeable but Jesus said
[1:37:09] that even a sparrow Sparrow who was two
[1:37:12] two of them sold for a fourth of a penny
[1:37:14] and not one of those birds could fall to
[1:37:16] the ground without God knowing it God
[1:37:19] notices little things many times you say
[1:37:23] I can't do very much the conditions
[1:37:26] today but just a little kind word to
[1:37:30] someone an
[1:37:32] invitation a little
[1:37:35] testimony a little kind smile or a
[1:37:38] greeting to a passer by might mean more
[1:37:42] than you think it does it's
[1:37:46] little maybe I'm just going to speak
[1:37:48] freely just as it's coming to me you
[1:37:49] know it used to be I remember when God
[1:37:51] got a hold of my life and I know it was
[1:37:52] this way before he did you know what he
[1:37:54] used to be where Saints would get
[1:37:55] together at one another's house oh yeah
[1:37:59] and now we're lucky if we can all get
[1:38:00] together on the same Pew all get
[1:38:03] together at church at the same time you
[1:38:05] see what s listen friends you see what
[1:38:08] Satan wants to do is get us isolated in
[1:38:10] our own little world we become so
[1:38:13] insular to our own
[1:38:15] selves that's true and Satan wants to
[1:38:18] get us so caught up and all we can see
[1:38:20] is everything that's all around us let
[1:38:22] me tell you something the strength and
[1:38:24] how that you allow God to be a channel
[1:38:26] in your life to minister to somebody
[1:38:28] else God has ordained for you and I to
[1:38:31] do that you will find there will be
[1:38:33] strength and blessing that will come
[1:38:35] your way God never called you and I to
[1:38:37] sit in a church as though we're like 50
[1:38:40] states sitting Under One Roof but God
[1:38:42] called us as a body to minister to one
[1:38:47] another that's right and the church said
[1:38:50] amen would Satan would like to get us
[1:38:52] all separated in our own little States
[1:38:54] and our own little ideas and our own
[1:38:56] little
[1:38:57] things come on friends we're always
[1:38:59] going to we're always going to see
[1:39:01] differently we're not going to see eye
[1:39:03] to eye on every single thing but
[1:39:05] sometimes I don't even believe it's that
[1:39:07] I think many times we get away from that
[1:39:10] brotherly
[1:39:13] love we get away from it no wonder Paul
[1:39:17] would write to us let Brotherly Love
[1:39:22] continue
[1:39:25] is that right but the same I've never
[1:39:28] been that way we might want to try
[1:39:30] it the Bible says entertaining strangers
[1:39:34] yes yes because sometimes we've
[1:39:36] entertained angels
[1:39:38] unawares that's good brother Bram said
[1:39:42] you're looking for God don't worry this
[1:39:43] ain't in my notes he said you might be
[1:39:45] looking for God and he said you know
[1:39:47] what that person he said that's sitting
[1:39:49] right next to you he said it's godville
[1:39:51] right in there he said you're looking
[1:39:52] for God he said and here it is in your
[1:39:54] neighbor here's God right there the
[1:39:56] whole time but you know what sometimes
[1:39:58] listen friends I'm not saying this that
[1:40:00] we happens willfully we can sometimes
[1:40:02] just get in a
[1:40:05] rut in a rut and you know what Co didn't
[1:40:08] do us no favors either it just worked to
[1:40:12] to to sort of just kind of just to build
[1:40:14] those things right there and try to do
[1:40:16] all of that and try to hinder but I
[1:40:18] think God give us Grace to be able to
[1:40:20] sit down and just to minister to one
[1:40:22] another it's not about sitting down and
[1:40:24] hey you know what I'm going to come to
[1:40:25] your house tonight and we're going to
[1:40:26] solve problems no let's just have
[1:40:29] Fellowship let's just have Fellowship
[1:40:32] you know the prophet said in Fellowship
[1:40:34] is
[1:40:36] protection my
[1:40:38] goodness these little things are growing
[1:40:41] blowing up here aren't
[1:40:45] they I love this statement remember that
[1:40:48] remember the little girl brother BR
[1:40:49] talks about ra waving that flag yeah
[1:40:51] right it was a Canadian flag
[1:40:54] she was waving that flag and Prime Min
[1:40:57] what a prime minister or whomever it was
[1:40:59] went
[1:41:00] by and she started
[1:41:03] crying she started crying the teacher
[1:41:05] couldn't find her she said he didn't see
[1:41:09] me I was waving my
[1:41:12] flag her patriotic part she was waving
[1:41:15] it he didn't see me right and that
[1:41:19] little that that teacher went out and
[1:41:20] got her remember brother Bram tells this
[1:41:23] oh my went out and got her and
[1:41:25] ministered to her at that time and
[1:41:27] notice how the prophet takes it here in
[1:41:28] this message he said but that's not so
[1:41:31] with Jesus you might get overlooked by
[1:41:34] by man but it's not so with Jesus he
[1:41:37] sees every little move that you make
[1:41:41] every little kind word that you speak
[1:41:44] and every little kind deed that you
[1:41:49] do let me just I'm just going to stop
[1:41:52] here
[1:41:57] brother Brandon makes this
[1:41:59] statement he's praying for for a lady
[1:42:03] for a sister and the the angel of the
[1:42:05] Lord has called this this sister out
[1:42:07] this is out of voice of the sign
[1:42:10] 1964 and brother Ram
[1:42:13] says what do you think L sitting next to
[1:42:15] him a man who is healed with arthritis
[1:42:18] do you believe too do you believe do you
[1:42:20] believe God can tell me what your
[1:42:21] trouble is you're way away from me just
[1:42:24] believe him now do you believe I've told
[1:42:26] you the truth then your high blood
[1:42:28] pressure will go down you believe it no
[1:42:30] he SP the angel of the Lord has brought
[1:42:31] his attention to this lady now watch he
[1:42:34] says you raised your hand up too now
[1:42:37] he's talking to somebody different you
[1:42:39] was trying to encourage
[1:42:42] her so the one that had been called out
[1:42:45] this one sitting next to her had been
[1:42:47] trying to encourage her do you believe
[1:42:50] God can tell me what's well you know
[1:42:52] what since you've been so nice to help
[1:42:54] her now God will be nice to help
[1:42:58] you the angel of the Lord was calling
[1:43:01] her out and the one sitting next to her
[1:43:03] was encouraging her Hallelujah and that
[1:43:07] moved that moved God's heart amen you
[1:43:12] know but brother Bram says when he saw
[1:43:13] Adam and Eve walk out of the garden
[1:43:15] brother Bram said when he saw that Adam
[1:43:17] was willing to walk out with his wife he
[1:43:20] said that moved God to to see that
[1:43:24] expression of Love through human beings
[1:43:28] it moved him to such a place to say I've
[1:43:30] got to make a way back Hallelujah it
[1:43:33] brought him on the
[1:43:37] scene listen friends I I don't God knows
[1:43:40] how to apply this to our hearts on
[1:43:42] Little Words little things we can say it
[1:43:45] can be little words that maybe can come
[1:43:48] from me but I listen I'm just telling
[1:43:49] you this I don't believe God has called
[1:43:52] me to this church that I'm to be the
[1:43:54] only source of encouragement I'm only
[1:43:58] one small part in it and I really mean
[1:44:00] that one small part but that
[1:44:02] encouragement that it would so flow
[1:44:05] that's right through the body a word
[1:44:07] that is in due season that encourages
[1:44:10] you for who God sees you to be as a son
[1:44:12] and daughter of God that words can
[1:44:15] actually be fitly spoken that's right
[1:44:18] through your
[1:44:19] life to one another amen this this is
[1:44:23] why friends I say that sometimes the
[1:44:25] little the little things God knows how
[1:44:27] to help us to apply that in our own life
[1:44:29] whatever God has he's called you and I
[1:44:31] to do even in ministering here through
[1:44:33] the body do you realize sometimes even
[1:44:35] the special songs that sung and praying
[1:44:38] over those songs and even when they're
[1:44:40] sung oh my you know you know what
[1:44:42] happens there's Devils that are put to
[1:44:44] flight that's right there was one battle
[1:44:47] in the book in the time of Israel you
[1:44:49] realize where Israel didn't even have to
[1:44:51] go fight they went out and just took up
[1:44:53] the spoil cuz there were special the
[1:44:56] Bible says singers anointed to sing
[1:44:59] praises to the beauty of his Holiness
[1:45:02] let me tell you you want to be an
[1:45:03] encouragement and you want encouragement
[1:45:05] in your life don't allow the enemy to
[1:45:08] cause you to hang your harp up on a
[1:45:10] willow tree don't allow the enemy to
[1:45:13] just look at you and say you're nothing
[1:45:15] you don't have any position you're a
[1:45:17] child of God you're a son and daughter
[1:45:19] of God you've got a purpose you've got a
[1:45:22] position
[1:45:23] I don't care you might think it's ever
[1:45:25] so little but you let God get in what's
[1:45:27] little right right there's a good way of
[1:45:31] always thinking about that that Lord I'm
[1:45:32] nothing without you but don't ever let
[1:45:34] it keep you from where you're making
[1:45:36] excuses say God let me just be available
[1:45:38] to
[1:45:41] you little things friends little things
[1:45:44] it's not big things it's little things
[1:45:46] little things little things it's just
[1:45:48] that little words sometimes just just
[1:45:49] even that out of the way just out of the
[1:45:52] way
[1:45:53] moment just an out of the way to go and
[1:45:56] check on somebody else Minister phone
[1:46:00] call everybody with me yes I know listen
[1:46:04] I I know we're tired I know we're tired
[1:46:06] at times I get that even sometimes when
[1:46:09] I leave out of the office here man I
[1:46:11] leave out man all I'm just I'm ready to
[1:46:13] eat I'm ready to eat man I've already
[1:46:15] had all the coffee I'm coffeed up to
[1:46:17] here right now I I'm ready I'm ready to
[1:46:19] eat I've already had my lunch on that
[1:46:20] I'm ready I'm ready to eat and sometimes
[1:46:22] you just feel like man I just want to I
[1:46:23] just want to sit down and just and just
[1:46:28] rest sometimes I'll leave out and with
[1:46:30] stste a little bit more when I get home
[1:46:31] but at any rate I understand there's
[1:46:33] pressures and things of life but I I
[1:46:35] want to encourage you don't be value the
[1:46:40] value that God has placed in
[1:46:45] you whether as it was mentioned moments
[1:46:47] ago you're a special singer don't
[1:46:49] devalue that that's right say God help
[1:46:52] me amen I know not I know not all of us
[1:46:55] maybe would be called to that or what
[1:46:57] but every one of us has our part because
[1:46:58] it ain't just about special singing It's
[1:47:00] about also checking on one another amen
[1:47:03] is that all right calling somebody get
[1:47:06] somebody on your heart you don't have to
[1:47:07] send them you know a great you know I I
[1:47:09] know I know some of y'all are wonderful
[1:47:10] with words I wish I could be better with
[1:47:12] words but I know some of you I mean like
[1:47:13] on my wife when my wife goes to write a
[1:47:15] text I mean it's just like you know and
[1:47:18] then sometimes when I go to write a text
[1:47:20] it's it's just short
[1:47:23] it's difference God made them male and
[1:47:27] female it's just true I mean it's just
[1:47:29] different you know uh but and what I'm
[1:47:31] trying to say is God knows what we have
[1:47:33] need of he knows what we have need of
[1:47:36] doesn't he he knows just how to minister
[1:47:38] to you and I I'd say Lord you know what
[1:47:40] and not not don't don't look at it and
[1:47:42] say I'm you know what I'm going to wait
[1:47:43] till I get out of this this how I feel
[1:47:45] in this rut but you know what the very
[1:47:48] answer to you getting out of the rut
[1:47:49] you're in can be allowing to become a
[1:47:51] channel that the Holy Spirit can pour
[1:47:54] strength into your life and lift you
[1:47:56] from that condition because you are
[1:47:58] ordained to minister to the body of
[1:48:00] Jesus
[1:48:01] Christ you love him
[1:48:03] tonight God help us to have a word
[1:48:06] that's right in
[1:48:07] season let's just
[1:48:13] pray anybody else want to be remembered
[1:48:15] in prayer
[1:48:20] tonight could we just let's just let's
[1:48:22] pray for one one
[1:48:24] another let's just pray there's hands up
[1:48:26] my hands are up too Lord help us
[1:48:30] Heavenly
[1:48:32] Father Lord Jesus you
[1:48:35] know every single need you know the
[1:48:38] paths that Lord that we're to walk
[1:48:41] through Lord father even Lord as you
[1:48:44] would direct us even in this moment in
[1:48:46] this
[1:48:47] season Lord here you would open these
[1:48:50] things out of job 26 and begin to
[1:48:52] minister
[1:48:54] Lord truly I didn't see that Lord until
[1:48:57] some weeks
[1:48:58] ago Lord God just a little bit just a
[1:49:01] few days before I stood here and
[1:49:03] ministered the first time out of job
[1:49:06] 26 but you've seen what we need Lord and
[1:49:09] truly Lord there's no way that we could
[1:49:11] have seen what we need to see and that
[1:49:14] it would be applied to our lives if it
[1:49:16] wasn't you and given us the unction for
[1:49:18] the season now father I don't believe
[1:49:22] Lord that you've spoken a word to us in
[1:49:24] this way that it would just fall and not
[1:49:28] return and return back to your Void I I
[1:49:30] don't believe that Lord I believe God
[1:49:32] that just within My Heart Lord and the
[1:49:34] hearts of my brothers and sisters here
[1:49:37] Lord none of us Lord not one of us mean
[1:49:41] to overlook things Lord we do not mean
[1:49:44] to walk around Lord as it were
[1:49:47] unaware but we ask you Lord God for your
[1:49:50] grace that you would help us to be more
[1:49:52] more aware help us Lord not to despise
[1:49:56] Small Things help us Lord to realize
[1:49:59] it's you unlike
[1:50:01] that Monarch or whatever it was in
[1:50:04] Canada he could not see that little girl
[1:50:07] but father you see every little thing
[1:50:11] Lord countless Lord testimonies of how
[1:50:13] it was in job's
[1:50:16] life Lord I pray that Lord also right
[1:50:20] now that God you would so tender
[1:50:23] eyes our hearts
[1:50:26] Lord if Lord even for words that would
[1:50:30] would come Lord our way may Lord you
[1:50:32] help us Lord that even that words that
[1:50:35] would be expressed to someone else Lord
[1:50:38] May there be Lord like that when that
[1:50:40] shot Lord that has it should have been
[1:50:42] given to me there was a numbing agent
[1:50:45] should have been there Lord something
[1:50:47] that would have helped it I'd had that
[1:50:49] shot i' had that that antibiotic many
[1:50:51] times but I never had had it like that
[1:50:55] God help us forgive us Lord when we've
[1:50:58] given
[1:50:59] wordsall without really being
[1:51:02] sweetened within your presence I know
[1:51:05] that's a trap Lord the enemy wants to
[1:51:07] get us Lord in those ways sometimes we
[1:51:09] feel like I've got to say this and I've
[1:51:11] got to say that and really Lord if we'll
[1:51:14] just weigh it on out we know that
[1:51:18] anxiousness is never the leadership of
[1:51:21] the Holy Spirit
[1:51:24] but in reality Lord nervousness is quite
[1:51:26] the
[1:51:27] difference a person can be
[1:51:30] nervous and they're not anxious they
[1:51:32] they could just be nervous here it is
[1:51:34] there may be something that they're just
[1:51:35] waiting and looking to you and trusting
[1:51:39] upon you but anxiousness can Lord be
[1:51:41] quite the different it becomes something
[1:51:43] to where there's not really there's like
[1:51:44] a a turmoil part that's going on and and
[1:51:47] it becomes like built up out of
[1:51:48] frustration and Lord God help us I pray
[1:51:55] may we
[1:51:56] reside and let off in the pressure in
[1:52:00] the proper place
[1:52:01] Lord let the pressure off Lord in you
[1:52:05] lord your Prophet spoke of how that
[1:52:07] pressure comes around our lives he said
[1:52:10] there's no there's no one exempt from it
[1:52:13] it makes the good act this way it makes
[1:52:15] the bad act this way makes the rich act
[1:52:17] this way makes the poor acts this way it
[1:52:20] makes the people out there act this way
[1:52:22] way and it also the people in brandham
[1:52:24] Tabernacle Lord God every one of us I
[1:52:28] know I'm speaking Lord we're living in a
[1:52:30] time of such great pressure there's
[1:52:34] demonic pressure all

[1:52:41] released there in Revelations 9 the
[1:52:44] darkness that's upon the Earth we we
[1:52:46] feel it Lord sometimes Lord as we come
[1:52:49] to the house of
[1:52:51] God we come into our homes and then come
[1:52:54] to the house of God and sometimes Lord
[1:52:56] this is the greatest place where we feel
[1:52:58] the greatest
[1:52:59] peace no wonder sometimes individuals
[1:53:02] will close their eyes in here it's where
