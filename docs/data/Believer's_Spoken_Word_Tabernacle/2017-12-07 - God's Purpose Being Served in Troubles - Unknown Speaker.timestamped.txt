[36:33] ourselves to you Lord and just ask you
[36:35] and just speak to us Lord in the name of
[36:38] Jesus Christ amen amen
[36:41] let's just look in the word of the Lord
[36:43] tonight in Genesis 31 I want to go back
[36:47] in here and just look a little bit more
[36:54] into these things in Genesis 31 verse 1
[37:02] and he heard the words of Laban son
[37:08] saying Jacob hath taken away all that
[37:11] was our fathers and of that which was
[37:14] our fathers half he gotten all this
[37:17] glory and Jacob beheld the countenance
[37:21] of Laban and behold it was not toward
[37:25] him as before I would dare say that even
[37:31] Laban sons would not have had what they
[37:35] had if not God had brought Jacob there
[37:40] it wouldn't have had that but to see the
[37:43] blessing that from God word committed to
[37:47] Jacob and here they are but we see how
[37:49] things have turned in this time look at
[37:53] this this is so precious of verse 3
[37:55] Jacob sees the countenance of Laban
[37:57] changing but in verse 3 and the Lord
[37:59] said unto Jacob return unto the land of
[38:03] thy father's and to that kindred and I
[38:05] will be with me in that wonderful he
[38:09] sees the things changing toward him and
[38:12] as he sees that God speaks to my what a
[38:17] wonderful thing isn't it and they're
[38:18] wonderful when the Lord speaks to our
[38:21] heart even in the midst of things that
[38:24] sometimes it seems like what's going on
[38:26] here but this is a moment and the Lord
[38:29] speaks them is this return
[38:32] in verse four and Jacobson and called
[38:35] Rachel and Leah to the field unto his
[38:38] flock and said unto them I see your
[38:40] father's countenance than it is not
[38:42] toward me as before but the God of my
[38:44] father that's been me and you know that
[38:47] with all my power I have served your
[38:49] father and your father hath deceived me
[38:52] and changed my wages ten times but God
[38:56] suffered him not to hurt me
[38:59] amen may God bless the reading of his
[39:02] word bless use your being seated I'd
[39:04] like to keep on reading their verse
[39:07] seven how that David Jacob mentions that
[39:10] he's aware you know God could have I've
[39:15] shown to Jacob in the midst of this time
[39:19] he could have shown to Jacob when it
[39:21] came down to where Laban deceived him by
[39:23] giving him Leah instead of Rachel first
[39:26] God could have uncovered that but God
[39:29] didn't uncover that and show that to him
[39:31] at that moment that's my brother Brown
[39:33] will tell us in in many parts of a
[39:36] message in Robert LeBron keeps going to
[39:38] John 5:19 and he's he's bringing that
[39:42] into his in that's the Ministry of
[39:44] Christ working not just only there in
[39:48] the ministry where I son of man is
[39:50] revealing thee son of men but it is the
[39:52] same principle within our lives even as
[39:55] believers and brother Brown remember the
[39:57] Spirit of God says this is the harmony
[39:59] that is to exist now and brother BAM
[40:02] we'll take it over and over even in God
[40:05] I think it's God identified by his own
[40:06] characteristics in 1964 well brother BAM
[40:09] says many people get the wrong idea and
[40:11] the wrong slant about prophets he said
[40:14] they look as though that they themselves
[40:17] just did what they wanted to do he and
[40:20] he takes us back to Elijah Elijah stood
[40:22] on Mount Carmel said I'd done all of
[40:24] this at thy word
[40:25] o God he goes on to say how they said
[40:28] that a they can only operate as God
[40:30] would reveal himself to them for no
[40:33] flesh the scripture says can glory in
[40:34] his presence and the Prophet says in
[40:36] that same quote even the flesh of Jesus
[40:39] Christ could not glory in the presence
[40:41] of God or it was God who revealed
[40:44] himself
[40:45] through the Sun it was bringing back
[40:47] that which was lost and restoring that
[40:49] relationship so even when we look at
[40:52] this this verse of scripture in verse
[40:53] seven of how that God permitted all of
[40:57] this to take place but yet
[40:59] Jacob is aware God gave permission for
[41:03] all of this but he suffered not him to
[41:07] hurt me
[41:08] so God God has limits you with me
[41:12] God has limits on things and Jacobs
[41:14] aware of this that God has not suffered
[41:17] him to hurt now notice in verse 13 of
[41:19] Genesis 31 here here is Jacob he's
[41:23] rehearsing now remember he's called Leah
[41:25] and he's called Rachel he's called them
[41:27] unto the field and in verse 13 he's here
[41:30] he's rehearsing as God has spoke to him
[41:32] I am the God of Bethel where thou
[41:34] anointest the pillar and where thou
[41:36] Valis the vow unto me now arise and get
[41:40] the out from this land and return unto
[41:43] the land of thy kindred and Rachel and
[41:48] Leah answered and said unto him is there
[41:51] yet any portion or inheritance for us in
[41:54] our father's house are we not counted of
[41:57] him strangers now what look how things
[42:01] are are shaping up Jacob has called them
[42:04] to to the field with with this very
[42:09] purpose in mind that they are going to
[42:12] leave but notice when he calls them and
[42:15] begins to make these things known that
[42:17] we have read here their response is what
[42:21] portion do we have here
[42:22] what inheritance do we have here God is
[42:26] preparing not just as he dealt with
[42:28] Jacob's life to leave already before in
[42:32] the previous chapter but God has made a
[42:34] way so that when he speaks to Jacob in
[42:37] this hour and he says I'm the God of
[42:39] Bethel he's already been dealing with
[42:41] Jacob's heart so that when God speaks
[42:44] directly to him he's already prepared to
[42:47] move upon that authority of the word
[42:50] that's how God will deal with our lives
[42:53] many times the Holy Spirit dealing with
[42:56] our lives not just in a saw
[42:57] servus but sometimes God has been
[43:00] dealing weeks and weeks and weeks and
[43:02] time to do what soften us to the point
[43:06] to where when he drops his word were
[43:08] ready and in a condition and ready to
[43:10] receive it
[43:11] to think of God in this hour it could
[43:13] not just come directly and drop the
[43:16] message just right away but remember
[43:18] everything started with the signs and
[43:20] wonders the residue the resurrected Lord
[43:23] Jesus Christ here in our midst what was
[43:25] it doing preparing the hearts of the
[43:27] people for what a message that was going
[43:30] to follow the sign that they were seeing
[43:33] of the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ God
[43:36] has an order just like even when the
[43:39] word itself came to Nathan or David
[43:42] rather and David was in the wrong with
[43:44] mishima but Nathan never just charged
[43:47] right in there and said you are wrong
[43:49] but what did he do he took the word and
[43:52] he opened up David to a place to where
[43:55] now when the word could come to David
[43:57] David was ready to resume it to it and
[43:59] act upon it God knows what he's doing to
[44:02] think of it God knows and understands
[44:05] that and God will come by his presence
[44:07] just like in the beginning in Genesis 1
[44:09] when there was a need for this change
[44:12] upon this earth the word spoke and when
[44:14] the word went forth the Spirit of God
[44:17] began to move upon the waters see how
[44:20] God moves in to do what and the when the
[44:23] spilling the word says mood it is to
[44:25] change conditions or create the
[44:28] atmosphere that's needed for the word to
[44:30] come forth sometimes the things of what
[44:34] of how that we are looking at things and
[44:37] when we see this here sometimes the
[44:40] conditions and what we're looking at we
[44:43] see the word that God has spoken we see
[44:45] the word then he's laid out here and it
[44:48] word that not only applies to the
[44:49] prophecy and the fulfillment of the age
[44:52] that we're living in but even when it
[44:54] comes down to simple things within our
[44:56] life and I don't mean to say simple just
[44:59] to make light of that but I mean where
[45:01] that here these things are being
[45:03] fulfilled prophetically within the earth
[45:06] we see these things taking place here
[45:08] we're watching prophecy itself being
[45:11] the same thing here just yesterday or
[45:13] Tuesday when when President Trump
[45:15] announced that recognizing Jerusalem as
[45:18] the capital of Israel listen friends
[45:21] those things are going on as well but to
[45:23] look at it let's see bring it down even
[45:25] into here and apply it to our own lives
[45:26] it's God Himself causing even you and I
[45:29] if we can say it like this to recognize
[45:31] that here what poem this earth God by
[45:34] His grace we are his chosen place of
[45:37] worship we are the place where God
[45:39] chooses to tabernacle in the hearts of
[45:42] his children you see all of these things
[45:44] even within that it's called moving even
[45:47] upon our lives to where there's things
[45:49] that deals with things that sometimes we
[45:52] want to just lay aside or we want to
[45:54] just put off as insignificant but
[45:56] remember this word came to prepare a
[45:59] people for rapture and translation it
[46:03] came to prepare us fully and give us in
[46:06] this lifetime a real victory and give to
[46:09] us discernment even in our own lives to
[46:12] where we're able to live victorious even
[46:14] over resentment even over jealousy even
[46:17] over all these things it's the power of
[46:19] this revealed word that lifts you and I
[46:22] and changes you and I and let me tell
[46:24] you something this word being revealed
[46:26] there's times when you face and you
[46:28] sense pressures in your life like Laban
[46:31] himself the sons were yes sowing all
[46:33] these things and here Jacob realizes
[46:36] things are changing toward me but God
[46:38] says to him return unto me and here
[46:40] Jacob he calls his wives unto himself I
[46:44] tell you sometimes God permits things to
[46:46] come about for one purpose and that's to
[46:48] call us unto himself think of this they
[46:54] this is not Jacob putting words in their
[46:56] mouths this is Rachel and Leah this is
[46:59] their testimony Jacob's already told
[47:01] them you've seen my testimony I've never
[47:04] I have I've served your father with
[47:06] everything within me
[47:08] they sing that but notice their
[47:12] attentiveness there's nothing here for
[47:14] us so if there's nothing here for us
[47:16] let's go you see how that the things
[47:21] that we God will permit the changing in
[47:24] the turning of
[47:25] to where it's it's moving us it's taking
[47:28] away all the feathers and everything out
[47:30] of the nest what's it doing it's turning
[47:32] us you said brother Sam is turning us to
[47:34] look into the coming of the Lord we're
[47:36] looking to the coming Lord but friends
[47:37] listen it's not just something where
[47:39] something that's way out there and I
[47:40] don't mean that the coming of the Lord
[47:42] is way out there but I'm saying that God
[47:44] also is moving within our lives
[47:46] individually and calling us beyond the
[47:50] our own selves absolutely the Prophet
[47:55] over and over in that message perfect
[47:57] strength by perfect weakness how that he
[48:00] would speak of this and he says oh how
[48:02] the tabernacle he said we need a good
[48:04] killing this morning he said and I need
[48:07] a good killing with it killing a
[48:10] deadening a laying down but to notice
[48:14] how that that Rachel and Leah how they
[48:16] answered here and they are already
[48:20] declaring in verse 15 where aren't we
[48:24] not strangers among them he has sold us
[48:28] and hath quite devoured also our money
[48:30] for all the riches which God had taken
[48:32] from our Father than is ours and our
[48:35] children's now then whatsoever God has
[48:37] said unto thee do it miss wonderful
[48:41] family harmony is that right this is
[48:46] unity they're united this isn't I don't
[48:49] want to go but it's here they are they
[48:52] want to go they don't see any reason to
[48:55] stay even in their land that they've
[48:57] known their whole life this place that
[49:01] they've grown up in their whole life
[49:03] but now they look upon this place and
[49:05] say we're a stranger here we have no
[49:08] continuing City here we had no
[49:10] inheritance here God had to allow this
[49:13] to get this way for them whatever it was
[49:16] so that Rachel Leah this was their
[49:19] testimony
[49:19] let's leave whatever God has said let's
[49:24] go my verse 17 then Jacob rose up and
[49:35] said his sons and his wives
[49:38] upon camels he carried away all his
[49:41] cattle and all his goods which he had
[49:43] gotten the cattle of his getting which
[49:45] he had gotten in an Haram and for to go
[49:47] to Isaac his father in the land of
[49:50] Canaan in the message victory day where
[49:56] the RAM says Jacob had a V day one time
[49:58] he was scared to go back to his brother
[50:01] because he had done evil but yet the
[50:03] Holy Spirit began to warn him in his
[50:06] heart return back to the homeland where
[50:08] you come from you've come from the
[50:10] homeland you've done evil over there now
[50:12] I'm sending you back and he says that's
[50:16] what the devil is so after us about
[50:19] that's what the devil is so after the
[50:22] bride the church for now it's getting
[50:24] close to v-day she's getting real close
[50:27] that's when the enemy does his worst to
[50:29] reroute the Bible said whoa into the
[50:32] earth because the devil is like a
[50:34] roaring lion in the last days going
[50:36] around devouring what he will you see
[50:38] woe unto them the persecutions and
[50:41] things would take place hold right to it
[50:44] don't you move right or left stay right
[50:47] with the word God said so that doesn't
[50:51] Jacob he said longing in his heart
[50:53] everything seemed to be wrong he wanted
[50:59] to go back home the Holy Spirit was
[51:02] leading him he had and made a promise to
[51:05] God he had to go to Bethel to pay these
[51:08] tithing and so forth so here God has
[51:13] been dealing with Jacob's life the Holy
[51:16] Spirit four years from when Joseph was
[51:19] born then how God speaks to him so
[51:23] directly and now Joseph yields to what
[51:28] God is calling for or Jacob yields to
[51:31] what God is calling for you see what
[51:34] good would it do for God to send a
[51:36] message if there wasn't hearts to
[51:37] receive it what good would it do for God
[51:40] to give a give a word and even even when
[51:43] we look at 4:00 at 4:00 at 4:00 this
[51:45] evening Thursday night and Sunday and in
[51:47] the surf what good would it do for God
[51:49] to give a word if there wasn't hearts
[51:50] that could receive
[51:52] we know that in all of this that even
[51:55] when you look through this in the time
[51:56] of Jeremiah you see it even in Ezekiel
[51:59] even when Israel was out of their land
[52:01] before remember God God was the one who
[52:05] was going to calls and perform his good
[52:08] word and deal with the hearts of Israel
[52:10] because it wasn't just after 70 years
[52:13] that all of a sudden the switch was
[52:15] turned on and they walked out of Babylon
[52:17] but everything that would take place
[52:19] they didn't know every little detail of
[52:22] all that was going to go on but God let
[52:24] it know that I will perform my word in
[52:27] causing you to return it wasn't God
[52:29] dragging them out of Babylon but God
[52:32] dealing with the heart to where they
[52:34] longed to come out of Babylon and it
[52:37] wasn't a longing to I want to get out of
[52:39] Babylon I hate Babylon I can't stand
[52:41] babylon babylon so bad over synonym
[52:43] babylon no wonder that their desire to
[52:46] leave was about him not about condition
[52:49] so much you understand sometimes it's
[52:52] things looking at it's not just about
[52:54] being free of conditions it's about
[52:56] uniting with him because if it was just
[52:59] to me I want to be done with this I'm
[53:01] tired of this entitled little assist I'm
[53:02] tired of that I'm tired of this and I'm
[53:04] tired of that and if it's just that then
[53:06] once that is lifted then where do you go
[53:09] how many times the Prophet tells us in
[53:12] desperation people will ask for certain
[53:14] things and asking not just what he's
[53:16] told us there I've seen it in my life
[53:18] you've seen it here where people were
[53:20] asked for certain things I've got to
[53:21] only heal me if God will only do this
[53:23] and God all and do this and God does it
[53:26] faithfully to show his care and
[53:28] attentiveness to his word and they turn
[53:30] right back around and while serving you
[53:35] see what the purpose is what they wanted
[53:37] they didn't want to serve him they just
[53:39] wanted free this is hindering me come on
[53:43] somebody you know I want to see people
[53:46] delivered from judgment not just to be
[53:48] delivered and just to say well this was
[53:50] a problem is his hinders my work and I
[53:52] can't get a job that I can't it's got to
[53:54] be something greater than that it's got
[53:56] to be I want to know the Lord Jesus and
[53:59] me
[53:59] him he'll take care of the drug problem
[54:02] amen he'll become your gospel he'll
[54:05] become your drug he'll become your
[54:07] complete dependency and you will be
[54:10] addicted to him amen
[54:15] it's about him the management we think
[54:19] of things in our life sometimes and
[54:21] sometimes things God allows to show
[54:24] greenness about our life areas that we
[54:26] need to be matured Ian oh my brother
[54:29] sister let us not get caught up so much
[54:32] in the area I want to be free of this
[54:34] but let us say Lord let me be so United
[54:36] with you Lord help me Lord that then my
[54:39] life can be so dead too that by being so
[54:42] alive in you Lord sometimes sometimes
[54:48] things are already moving behind the
[54:50] scenes before we ever see anything
[54:52] physically God was dealing with Jacobs
[54:54] heart before you ever seen a move
[54:57] noticeably God was dealing with Rachel
[55:01] and Leah's heart as well to think of it
[55:03] Jacobs purpose what's the whole purpose
[55:05] why is he here why is he there in Iran
[55:08] why is he there what's the purpose about
[55:10] that
[55:11] it was a purpose for him to obtain a
[55:13] wife now I want you to think of this
[55:16] because I want you to look at this just
[55:17] in your life in my life did he even
[55:20] before the seed itself is quickened and
[55:23] expressed God himself show it shows he
[55:26] has his hand upon our life every step of
[55:29] the way and Hosea 12:12
[55:32] Jacob fled into the country of Syria and
[55:35] Israel served for a life and for a wife
[55:40] he kept sheep Jacob fled but Israel
[55:44] served yet he's not it's not been
[55:46] quickened yet you ask me it's not been
[55:50] quickened but yet what is this it shows
[55:53] this purpose that he's there for is to
[55:55] obtain a wife that was not Jacob that
[55:57] was Israel that was that part yet not
[56:00] quickened but was there serving for a
[56:03] wife that's why the Prophet could say
[56:07] here stood a twelve-year-old boy in the
[56:09] temple and they looked at him and
[56:11] marveled and the Prophet could say as he
[56:13] stood there he says you you know you're
[56:15] not I must be about my father's business
[56:17] the Prophet said a little
[56:18] twelve-year-old boy he said no earthly
[56:21] wisdom of his own he said but to think
[56:23] of it he said the father didn't even
[56:25] dwell in him at the time but here he was
[56:27] speaking oh that was that seed that was
[56:30] laying there the whole time so here in
[56:37] Genesis 28 15 this remember I bring you
[56:45] back to this because here is Jacob he's
[56:48] received this promise and valve from the
[56:52] Lord and God has said this that I am
[56:57] with thee and will keep thee in all the
[56:59] places whether thou goest and we'll
[57:01] bring the again into this land I will
[57:05] not leave the until I have done that
[57:06] which I have spoken to the we can say
[57:14] perfectly and clearly when God makes
[57:17] this known to Jacob here before he ever
[57:20] here at vessel before he ever gets to
[57:22] her on Jacob doesn't know what all
[57:25] that's going to entail he doesn't know
[57:29] and that's Richard that the countenance
[57:31] is gonna be turned against him he
[57:33] doesn't know that the coming back into
[57:35] the land is going to involve pressure he
[57:38] doesn't know that adversity is gonna
[57:40] strike his way he doesn't know that that
[57:43] that's part of God bringing him back
[57:45] into the land God doesn't tell us
[57:48] everything God doesn't tell us
[57:53] everything in even in the timeline of
[57:56] everything neither does God want you an
[57:58] act to guess or presume but just walk
[58:01] faithfully in what is revealed all of
[58:06] the parts I want you to think of this in
[58:09] in in the time of the exodus here and to
[58:13] look at these things here here in Exodus
[58:15] 2 verse 23 a familiar part we're
[58:18] familiar with this the scripture said it
[58:20] came to pass in process of time that the
[58:25] king of Egypt died
[58:26] and the children of Israel side by
[58:29] reason of the bondage and they cried and
[58:31] their cry came up unto God by reason of
[58:33] the bondage if you read back over into
[58:35] Exodus 1
[58:36] there's none there's no doubt about it
[58:38] in Exodus 1 when everything was coming
[58:41] upon them there's no doubt about look
[58:43] remember when the Pharaoh had said take
[58:46] any male child and throwing put him in
[58:49] there of the crocodiles and so forth but
[58:51] to think about it how that the Hebrew
[58:53] midwives would not do that they were not
[58:58] heed to that Kings commandment
[58:59] look here's pressure coming even at that
[59:02] time but yet it's not the timing of the
[59:06] exact moment of the exodus but all of it
[59:09] is set in motion even though they don't
[59:13] see everything yet and I dare say in
[59:15] that time here you find that this way
[59:18] that the slavery the scripture goes on
[59:20] to say that here was all as we read last
[59:22] week it was them looking and out of fear
[59:24] they're saying oh we got to do something
[59:26] with these people if we don't do
[59:27] something they're liable to rise up
[59:29] against us arrival to do this live with
[59:30] everything was speculation it was all
[59:33] propaganda everything to sway that of
[59:36] Egypt toward that of Israel and then to
[59:39] see how things are coming coming coming
[59:41] about God allows things to continue into
[59:45] a time but then notice because Moses had
[59:48] to be born Moses had to be born it would
[59:53] seem like listen to us immediately when
[59:56] pressure starts shoot God steps in but
[1:00:00] how many years was that how long was
[1:00:04] that from when the very first one rose
[1:00:08] and the scripture is clear to point out
[1:00:11] he knew not Joseph God permitted that to
[1:00:16] arise in that hour one who knew not not
[1:00:20] Joseph knew not the blessings of Joseph
[1:00:23] but there had to be all of these parts
[1:00:25] had to be ready not only did God have to
[1:00:29] have a man ready on the scene that God
[1:00:32] would step down and in such simplicity
[1:00:34] would
[1:00:35] feeling something by the way of promise
[1:00:37] and in that word and his promise and
[1:00:39] that pillar fire accompanying that
[1:00:41] prophet would take a word down there to
[1:00:44] the children of Israel and they would
[1:00:46] recognize that the god of our fathers
[1:00:48] has visited us he's with us he's here to
[1:00:52] come and fulfill the promise of his word
[1:00:55] amen god allowed the end of the sainted
[1:00:58] God is preparing the hearts of the
[1:01:00] people and as he's preparing the hearts
[1:01:02] of the people to receive it he's also
[1:01:04] allowing those in the land of Canaan to
[1:01:07] wax worse and what's worse and wax worse
[1:01:10] and worse worse all of these things are
[1:01:12] going on if the children of Israel would
[1:01:16] have been focused on the waxing worse
[1:01:18] they would have missed the deliverance
[1:01:20] just keep your eyes and step with what
[1:01:25] God is revealing to us and then when
[1:01:27] it's time for us to stand here God will
[1:01:29] prepare us for that point by the way my
[1:01:33] title on this tonight God's purpose
[1:01:35] being served in troubles God's purpose
[1:01:39] being served in troubles I know this may
[1:01:41] not maybe mean so much maybe to a lot of
[1:01:43] you maybe maybe may not mean to anything
[1:01:45] but to one person but the Lord laid
[1:01:47] these things upon my heart and months
[1:01:49] ago and just looking at this tonight I
[1:01:51] believe the Word of God as timely don't
[1:01:53] you I believe that I believe the Word of
[1:01:55] God is right in season in our hearts the
[1:01:58] Bible goes on to say how that God heard
[1:02:00] their groaning and God remembered his
[1:02:02] covenant with Abraham with Isaac and
[1:02:05] with Jacob and God looked upon the
[1:02:07] children of Israel and God had respect
[1:02:09] unto them not to think of how that you
[1:02:12] know brother Adam puts it in this manner
[1:02:14] of how that there was a favor who raised
[1:02:17] up who didn't know Joseph and that was
[1:02:19] the beginning of the beginning that was
[1:02:21] the beginning of the Exodus so even
[1:02:26] though note nothing seems to be
[1:02:28] noticeably changing right there when
[1:02:32] that king arose who knew not Joseph that
[1:02:35] was the beginning of the beginning right
[1:02:37] there though while the rest of the world
[1:02:41] the rest of Egypt the rest of Israel
[1:02:44] they knew that not but yet that was the
[1:02:46] beginning God had to
[1:02:47] allow that well you say the Egyptians
[1:02:51] elected that man or this or that or he
[1:02:53] God orchestrated it and when the thing
[1:02:59] began to form under a political power
[1:03:01] began to form God begin to get ready the
[1:03:04] iniquity of the hammerites was fulfilled
[1:03:06] the time that he promised Abraham was
[1:03:08] fulfilled and the time of deliverance
[1:03:09] was at hand look at these words of
[1:03:11] powerful words and God permitted it
[1:03:18] didn't take God by surprise God
[1:03:20] permitted a pharaoh to rise up who knew
[1:03:24] not Joseph and ramasees was born right
[1:03:26] after said he come ramasees and ramasees
[1:03:29] was the one who knew not the blessings
[1:03:31] of Joseph he didn't know what the
[1:03:33] spiritual side was he was only a
[1:03:36] political genius that he could take a
[1:03:38] Ethiopia and the rest of the countries
[1:03:39] under military might that's all he knew
[1:03:41] was the military might think of how that
[1:03:50] God made himself known to Abraham that
[1:03:57] your seed sojourn that's these things
[1:04:01] when God begins to just deal quick and
[1:04:03] those things are so precious
[1:04:04] they're gonna sojourn in this land
[1:04:06] that's not their land they're just gonna
[1:04:08] soldier this is not our land
[1:04:10] we're just sojourning this is not my
[1:04:13] inheritance
[1:04:13] it's my possession I'm just so
[1:04:16] journeying here but one of these days
[1:04:18] one of these moments I should say it
[1:04:20] shall be changed
[1:04:24] which is so journey your seed shall
[1:04:28] sojourn in a strange land any land
[1:04:35] that's not God's promised land is a
[1:04:37] strange land strange fire strange God's
[1:04:42] it's strange but God said I will deliver
[1:04:48] them with a mighty hand now what you
[1:04:52] think of this deliver them if they're
[1:04:54] gonna need to be delivered it shows that
[1:04:57] there is going to be circumstances
[1:05:00] that would merit and call for
[1:05:03] deliverance God would allow the
[1:05:07] circumstances to come into a place that
[1:05:11] then he steps down through his word and
[1:05:13] this and manifests himself as the
[1:05:15] deliverer
[1:05:18] they walked into Egypt freely of their
[1:05:22] own accord they were not hog-tied and
[1:05:25] bound by chains that drug into Egypt
[1:05:28] they went down there of their own accord
[1:05:32] but how that God was letting him known
[1:05:35] it's gonna take a mighty hand
[1:05:37] glory be to God nothing short nothing
[1:05:42] short of the power of God
[1:05:44] think of this improving his word in here
[1:05:50] brother diamond says Abraham seed did
[1:05:52] sojourn in Egypt for hundred years
[1:05:55] he promised also to deliver them with a
[1:05:57] mighty hand a strong hand he would
[1:06:00] deliver the people out of the Egyptian
[1:06:02] bondage and he kept his word look what
[1:06:05] he had to do to get them children down
[1:06:08] in Egypt look what he had to do God
[1:06:14] permitted look what he had to do to get
[1:06:18] him down into Egypt the words already
[1:06:19] spoken they're gonna be in a strange
[1:06:21] land how do you get him in a strange
[1:06:22] land
[1:06:24] nothing's out of cater
[1:06:27] but look what has to take place in the
[1:06:29] brother Ram says it looked like disaster
[1:06:32] had befall was be falling and everything
[1:06:36] it was horrible for Joseph to be
[1:06:40] considered dead look how he's been
[1:06:44] bringing this it was horrible for him to
[1:06:47] be considered dead think about his
[1:06:49] father remember his father he wept they
[1:06:52] could hear him throughout the whole camp
[1:06:54] he wept look God could have showed Jacob
[1:06:57] right there they're lying to you he was
[1:07:01] a prophet not gonna showed him there
[1:07:04] you're lying but if God would have done
[1:07:08] that you want to messed up the whole
[1:07:10] program
[1:07:13] sometimes there's things that God could
[1:07:16] speak to you and I and show us certain
[1:07:18] things but listen if he did it would
[1:07:21] spoil the whole program of what he has
[1:07:23] for our life I don't need to know every
[1:07:27] step of the way I just need to know that
[1:07:29] he is with me that's all I got to know
[1:07:32] [Applause]
[1:07:36] you with me tonight we're not gonna know
[1:07:41] every step of the way
[1:07:42] but understand I know I this trial is
[1:07:44] coming on and I know one doesn't know we
[1:07:45] don't we don't know we don't know why
[1:07:48] those things are coming about that is
[1:07:50] scriptural friends do you understand
[1:07:52] that that scriptural it's not scriptural
[1:07:54] for God to come around and tell you this
[1:07:57] is why you're going for this this is why
[1:07:59] you're going through this that's not
[1:08:01] scriptural God never came down and told
[1:08:08] Daniel Daniel you're going through this
[1:08:10] because let me tell you why I want to
[1:08:12] show myself to you like I never showed
[1:08:14] myself to you before I want I want you
[1:08:18] to see me that I am there as that
[1:08:20] ever-present light that can shut the
[1:08:24] mouth of the lines he didn't tell him
[1:08:25] that
[1:08:26] but when Daniel got there after the test
[1:08:30] was over
[1:08:30] Daniel could say I saw him like I never
[1:08:33] saw him before
[1:08:34] Daniel you say Daniel he had God visited
[1:08:38] him in the angel here coming down there
[1:08:40] on the river
[1:08:41] he had many visitations let me tell you
[1:08:43] something you had many visitations
[1:08:46] I've had many visitations but when we're
[1:08:48] in the midst of the test or trial how
[1:08:50] precious is the visitation of Almighty
[1:08:53] God oh it's like no other time why he
[1:08:57] reveals himself
[1:08:58] I am your help I am your deliverer I am
[1:09:01] your salvation and Satan's Whitford and
[1:09:06] chattered and whatever more oh but let
[1:09:08] us hold faithful to the Lord say God
[1:09:12] help me look at this oh my he said Jacob
[1:09:17] his father think of it he said to
[1:09:19] believe that his own son had been killed
[1:09:22] by animals
[1:09:23] how hard now look now no look on brother
[1:09:25] BAM Drex this now here's a promise
[1:09:27] that's got to be fulfilled a promise
[1:09:30] that is needed to be fulfilled and here
[1:09:33] you have people within it better
[1:09:36] sorrowful hurting there's things that
[1:09:40] they're believing that's not true
[1:09:42] Joseph's not gone and God is permitting
[1:09:45] it why so that his plan is being worked
[1:09:50] out how hard it was on little Joseph to
[1:09:55] know that the poor little fellow away
[1:09:57] from his people betrayed by his brethren
[1:10:00] throw it into a ditch supposingly to be
[1:10:03] dead sheep blood put up on his coat
[1:10:05] where they had slayed a lamb to eat it
[1:10:07] put the blood upon it and took it to his
[1:10:08] father knowing all this but Joseph could
[1:10:12] remember one thing that the hand of the
[1:10:15] Lord was upon him he knew that he was a
[1:10:18] believer prophetic I going down in here
[1:10:26] into Joseph's life I believe that was on
[1:10:28] my heart the prophetic I how this
[1:10:30] prophet none wanted by the Spirit of God
[1:10:32] and the Prophet was able to look at this
[1:10:34] let me tell you if he I believe with all
[1:10:36] my heart even to that speck that he
[1:10:38] talked about in Paul a prisoner Jesus
[1:10:41] Christ how that God permitted Joseph to
[1:10:43] be down there in that prison he said
[1:10:45] because he had some pride that needed to
[1:10:48] be worked out
[1:10:49] God was interested in specks not just
[1:10:53] blobs so God said that speck will hinder
[1:10:56] you God was working it out that's what
[1:11:02] did it take a prophetic hey no matter
[1:11:07] how much think of this this was not
[1:11:08] imagination this was not somebody
[1:11:10] walking by you in the church and they
[1:11:11] walk by you and then your imagination
[1:11:13] goes I don't know you know they walk
[1:11:15] right by me you know and this and that
[1:11:16] and so forth and whatever more
[1:11:19] Britannian we ought to be beyond that
[1:11:21] listen to me now
[1:11:23] we could say we ought to be beyond that
[1:11:26] remember it's the enemy that comes in
[1:11:28] whispers it's what we do with the wood
[1:11:30] that comes
[1:11:32] if you're not living where you want to
[1:11:34] be living where that Christ is your
[1:11:36] all-in-all to where you're able to say
[1:11:38] you know what if that is true it's true
[1:11:40] so what they're my brother they're my
[1:11:42] sister can I get an amen on that one
[1:11:49] he'll horrid be to God no matter how
[1:11:53] much his brothers turned him out how
[1:11:56] much there was no cooperation anything I
[1:11:58] don't know if I have that one even down
[1:12:00] in there but the RAM goes on to this
[1:12:02] this Joseph knew God would keep this way
[1:12:05] when he saw that vision of all them
[1:12:08] bowing before him he know that he had
[1:12:10] that he know that had come to pass
[1:12:11] because it was it would come to pass
[1:12:13] because it was thus saith the Lord
[1:12:14] Joseph didn't understand every part but
[1:12:17] what he did know he was a believer
[1:12:20] that's all that we have to know I am a
[1:12:23] believer
[1:12:23] just like how brother brother John was
[1:12:26] ministering here on those Thursday
[1:12:27] nights secure in Christ
[1:12:28] it's our rest you don't allow the enemy
[1:12:31] to try to trouble you in other areas you
[1:12:32] rat the rest and where our ground is
[1:12:35] that we operate from we are secure in
[1:12:37] him as a believer as a believer what's
[1:12:45] this he says how would arrest ourselves
[1:12:49] in the word he says yes Joseph had to go
[1:12:51] through had much to go through go down
[1:12:54] into Egypt but God brought him out just
[1:12:56] exactly as he as he said think God
[1:12:59] permitted a family not only did this
[1:13:03] happen but then God permits a family
[1:13:07] shows it to pharaoh he couldn't have
[1:13:10] shown it to Joseph first he had to show
[1:13:12] the Pharaoh if he has shown it did she
[1:13:14] could have shown it to Joseph first but
[1:13:16] it will if he shown it to Joseph first
[1:13:18] Pharaoh would never have accepted it but
[1:13:20] God showed it to Pharaoh first and then
[1:13:24] God had won at that time all of a sudden
[1:13:27] oh I remember there's a guy who told me
[1:13:30] this and this and this in the prison his
[1:13:33] memory was sealed until an appointed
[1:13:37] time I wonder how many cases came before
[1:13:41] Pharaoh's court of dream
[1:13:44] and other things I wonder how many but
[1:13:47] yet God would not allow the action to
[1:13:49] come and his memory to be charged you
[1:13:51] would think friends you would think that
[1:13:53] that man would remember and talk about
[1:13:55] that the whole time his life was on the
[1:13:58] line
[1:13:59] but God sealed it and he didn't remember
[1:14:02] until the right time the situation arose
[1:14:06] it was not the wisdom of that man is the
[1:14:09] wisdom of God that said this is a time
[1:14:11] speak boy speak for his people
[1:14:14] this is a time God permitted a famine
[1:14:22] and then when Joseph's instrumental of
[1:14:25] the Lord he brought out of the prison
[1:14:28] how everything looks in the prison but
[1:14:30] God has him brought out of prison Sheen
[1:14:32] shaved a robe put on him and there he
[1:14:35] stands in front of Pharaoh and he begins
[1:14:37] to interpret the dream that's given to
[1:14:39] Pharaoh begins to speak it right out
[1:14:42] it's through through even his actions or
[1:14:47] the word that's coming forth that
[1:14:49] identifies his name
[1:14:53] here he has given a name of
[1:14:55] zaphenath-paneah the revealer of the
[1:14:58] hidden things right in my and when you
[1:15:03] look at the anointing of the holy spirit
[1:15:05] the angel the Lord remember what God
[1:15:07] said my name is Enya it will always bear
[1:15:10] the characteristic of Jesus Christ here
[1:15:15] Joseph he comes into this place oh my he
[1:15:19] could being in the pit being in there
[1:15:22] mud and everything else riding around
[1:15:24] with those the men that were dragging
[1:15:26] him along and water however they the
[1:15:27] whole encounter was could he ever have
[1:15:29] imagined of standing there and being the
[1:15:33] more one of the most powerful people
[1:15:35] there in that of Egypt and to know that
[1:15:37] that position was not given to him
[1:15:40] because he was somebody it was given to
[1:15:44] him because God's Word was to be
[1:15:47] fulfilled through his life
[1:15:49] Oh may we not glory in anything that's
[1:15:53] given to us but let us glory in the Lord
[1:15:56] and the Lord I long to know that God
[1:15:59] places where he will that his will might
[1:16:03] be fulfilled he permits the famine he
[1:16:08] permits all for them to have to come and
[1:16:10] then for the news to break how they must
[1:16:16] have felt they had to go back to Daddy
[1:16:17] and they were gonna tell daddy hey we
[1:16:20] lied to you see they're repentant see
[1:16:24] there in the middle there in a measure
[1:16:25] of return we've lied to you your son
[1:16:29] Joseph is alive that's what was needed
[1:16:31] to cause Jacob to rise up but it wasn't
[1:16:35] Jacob that was rising up it was Israel
[1:16:38] that was rising up you with me when the
[1:16:42] wagons came down to get him the wagons
[1:16:46] were coming down from Egypt and the
[1:16:48] Bible didn't say Jacob got on the wagons
[1:16:50] it said Israel got on the wagons amen at
[1:16:54] the change of the body it will be that
[1:16:57] real you on the I on the inside that
[1:16:59] gets in the chariot look at this now I
[1:17:05] hope you don't mind this me reading it
[1:17:07] if you do too bad I believe that I
[1:17:14] believe these these words it was hard
[1:17:18] look at this it was hard for those
[1:17:20] Hebrew children down there in Egyptian
[1:17:23] bondage which had been blessed and given
[1:17:27] the fruit of the land the best place
[1:17:29] Goshen to find out that they had become
[1:17:33] slaves Goshen was the best was the
[1:17:37] choice part it was a choice part of the
[1:17:39] land they were living good lives in
[1:17:43] Goshen but then there was a king who
[1:17:46] knew not Joseph and although that the
[1:17:50] land itself was still a fertile land God
[1:17:53] allowed pressure to come that was
[1:17:56] turning there
[1:17:58] and they become slaves slaves by a mere
[1:18:06] change of law they become slaves are you
[1:18:12] with me the Bible tells us concerning
[1:18:17] this spirit to understand that there's
[1:18:21] two spirits that are working throughout
[1:18:23] this this earth Holy Spirit and the
[1:18:26] unholy spirit everywhere that you look
[1:18:30] the Catholic Church the Roman Catholic
[1:18:32] Church they we're not behind it they're
[1:18:34] lying
[1:18:34] the spirit that motivates them is the
[1:18:38] same spirit motivating the nations of
[1:18:40] the world and God permits motivations
[1:18:44] let me tell you let me say it like this
[1:18:46] you know how they'll do a release on a
[1:18:49] dam every once in a while and they'll
[1:18:51] let so much pressure go pressure mounts
[1:18:53] up and then they'll let so much go God
[1:18:56] permits those spirits to turn loose and
[1:19:00] permits those things to come
[1:19:02] even in the strength of which they're
[1:19:04] coming it's not him doing it it's God
[1:19:06] permitting it so it's God permitting hmm
[1:19:10] well let it come a little bit but God's
[1:19:14] not worried it's all working everything
[1:19:18] for his purpose this is where the
[1:19:22] scripture could say in Daniel 7 in
[1:19:24] speaking of that little horn of that
[1:19:28] fourth kingdom of this kingdom here it
[1:19:30] says he shall speak Daniel 7:25 he shall
[1:19:33] speak great words against the most high
[1:19:36] and shall wear out the Saints of the
[1:19:38] Most High
[1:19:38] what's these words he speaks blasphemy
[1:19:41] he breaks his name down into titles
[1:19:46] teaching for doctrines the commandments
[1:19:48] of men that's the take away you know
[1:19:51] what that that's that's taken away from
[1:19:53] the deity of Jesus Christ when he breaks
[1:19:57] it down entitles it it wants to come and
[1:20:00] attack Redemption God becoming one of us
[1:20:04] amen deity God coming and becoming one
[1:20:09] of
[1:20:09] to redeem us congrats it that's
[1:20:13] blasphemy to speak them titles you with
[1:20:17] me so whether we're the worlds that all
[1:20:20] dinner is this Trinity and this is one
[1:20:22] listen isn't it God said that's
[1:20:24] blasphemy I'm gonna go with what God
[1:20:28] said and I'm gonna go a little of the
[1:20:29] prophet of the sage said he said yes
[1:20:31] saith the Lord that Trinitarian doctrine
[1:20:34] is of the devil
[1:20:37] why it's a three cord prong seeking to
[1:20:41] bind people unto itself it doesn't
[1:20:44] release people in Liberty it binds them
[1:20:47] to doing this works and this works in
[1:20:50] this works it's a spirit of fear but the
[1:20:52] name of Jesus Christ is a strong and
[1:20:55] mighty tower that the righteous run into
[1:20:58] the name of Jesus Christ is the liberty
[1:21:01] of the Church of the Living God amen
[1:21:05] amen
[1:21:08] now that call upon the name of the Lord
[1:21:10] they shall be saved but this one right
[1:21:17] here see his cover is taken off this
[1:21:21] trace all the way through some cover
[1:21:25] we're out the Saints of the Most High
[1:21:27] and think to change times and laws in
[1:21:39] order to change times and laws he must
[1:21:42] be given preeminence they must be given
[1:21:46] parliamentary seats you miss me
[1:21:49] he's got to be given he's got to be
[1:21:51] granted this think of it how the Pope
[1:21:53] stood what was it two years ago stood
[1:21:55] right and address what the whole joint
[1:21:57] houses together that was only something
[1:22:00] new ho what a thing that's been done
[1:22:02] what a historic thing it already started
[1:22:05] way back there way back there but you
[1:22:14] think now you hear hear all of this is
[1:22:17] given premanande think to change times
[1:22:19] and laws for what what influence what
[1:22:22] purpose what is it behind
[1:22:23] and they shall be given unto his hand
[1:22:25] look at this they shall be given into
[1:22:28] his hand until a time and times and
[1:22:30] dividing of time he's not taking us just
[1:22:34] of his own accord he's being permitted
[1:22:38] God is permitting it whoa
[1:22:43] that gives me comfort God has it all in
[1:22:48] control oh my but here's the end of the
[1:22:53] story and the judgment shall sit and
[1:22:55] they shall take away his Dominion to
[1:22:57] consume and destroy it unto the end and
[1:22:59] the kingdom and Dominion and the
[1:23:00] greatness of the kingdom under the whole
[1:23:02] heaven shall be given to the people of
[1:23:03] the saints of the Most High whose
[1:23:05] kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom and
[1:23:07] all dominions shall serve and obey Him
[1:23:11] notice this brother Bram talks about how
[1:23:15] that God would have to harden Pharaoh's
[1:23:17] heart and look he says he has to do this
[1:23:21] to put the people back in the promised
[1:23:23] land before he could bless them to bring
[1:23:26] forth the Messiah to them God had to
[1:23:31] allow that hardening God hardening in
[1:23:34] order to get them back in the land think
[1:23:37] of it if he manifested the promise of
[1:23:40] the Messiah outside of the land they
[1:23:42] would have been content to stay there
[1:23:45] this is why the word when God sent His
[1:23:48] Word in that resurrection sign here that
[1:23:50] word it goes forth it's called us out of
[1:23:53] Babylon it called us out and noticed
[1:23:56] calling us out and we're what has God
[1:23:59] been able to do and what is he able to
[1:24:02] do now as the Prophet said the bride
[1:24:05] must get out from that group of
[1:24:07] rejecters over into the promised land
[1:24:10] where the Messiah can be made manifest
[1:24:15] unto them what among believers Amen the
[1:24:22] Word of God that's maturing is the same
[1:24:25] word that's weeding out
[1:24:29] hey man God is moving God is working
[1:24:35] look at hold it
[1:24:37] III have that in the notes but I didn't
[1:24:40] put I didn't I don't have it here in
[1:24:41] front of me but just let me refer to
[1:24:43] that in revelation 17 the scripture I
[1:24:45] believe it's verse 25 it speaks of how
[1:24:47] that God hath put in the hearts of these
[1:24:51] kings these men that are law as kings
[1:24:54] with Bramson notice it says as Kings he
[1:24:57] said because they're not Kings they are
[1:24:59] dictators but they are giving power as
[1:25:01] kings
[1:25:02] where does their power come from from
[1:25:04] her how does she release that power it's
[1:25:07] permitted for her to release that where
[1:25:11] did Hitler get his authority to go
[1:25:13] it was the releasing of those spirits in
[1:25:16] revelations 9 is that right you look at
[1:25:20] many of the videos and things like that
[1:25:21] you look and see certain things look at
[1:25:23] Hitler that guy was a preacher man yes
[1:25:27] sir
[1:25:27] he took text and man that guy would
[1:25:30] preach and let me just say this when the
[1:25:32] Prophet talks about him fulfilling what
[1:25:34] Martin Luther said let me say this to
[1:25:36] you the heckler already had in his heart
[1:25:39] Hitler just took I took a situation took
[1:25:41] something and said it'll be good for me
[1:25:43] that'll fit in good with me Luther's
[1:25:45] respected among them that will fit in
[1:25:47] good with me and he went on are you with
[1:25:50] me it was already in his heart God
[1:25:54] allowed that to be said but here that
[1:25:55] was within his heart and he went on I
[1:25:58] wonder how many times were the prophets
[1:25:59] said certain things have to be said a
[1:26:01] certain way to throw some off are you
[1:26:07] with me friends but to see how that this
[1:26:12] is being fulfilled and how that the
[1:26:15] spirits God has permitted those spirits
[1:26:17] to move upon this of Hitler's heart to
[1:26:21] harden his heart and this was where I
[1:26:23] found to be astounding how did he have
[1:26:25] to harden Hitler's heart to be against a
[1:26:27] Jew when he was a half Jew himself it's
[1:26:33] a truth it was half Jew it was hardened
[1:26:37] against his own
[1:26:39] how could he have to do that like Stalin
[1:26:42] and Mussolini look what he says now
[1:26:44] people that's not inspired like a nation
[1:26:48] God has to take the things that are
[1:26:51] living by the laws of the land many
[1:26:54] times to make his promises come true
[1:26:58] people that are not inspired but we are
[1:27:03] inspired is not national pressure that's
[1:27:09] moving the bride no we are inspired God
[1:27:14] poured out his inspiration in this hour
[1:27:17] for this hour meaning it will come like
[1:27:21] a flood the Spirit of God has raised the
[1:27:24] standard against it the inspiration has
[1:27:26] been poured out what's needed for this
[1:27:29] hour to preserve you alive to keep you
[1:27:32] now and to practice away into glory God
[1:27:35] has delivered his word to us but the
[1:27:42] people that's not inspired God has to
[1:27:44] take laws of the land listen to me now
[1:27:47] let me just try to let me just try to
[1:27:50] hone in on this part here people that's
[1:27:52] not inspired like a nation God has to
[1:27:55] take the laws of the lands many time to
[1:27:57] make his promises come true he says they
[1:27:59] ask to harden those dictators hard to
[1:28:00] run the drew back to the promised land
[1:28:02] it had to be that way you're aware of
[1:28:06] this and I'm aware of this there's walls
[1:28:07] that's been laying on the book for years
[1:28:09] where they could come right against
[1:28:11] churches years it's been years remember
[1:28:15] one of the promises that Trump was
[1:28:16] making that he was going to undo a
[1:28:18] certain law that had been on the books
[1:28:20] where they could take your tax-exempt
[1:28:21] status and other things like this
[1:28:23] remember that were his promises upon
[1:28:26] there and this is look that was rallying
[1:28:29] the evangelical vote you say brother
[1:28:35] Simon what good would that do because
[1:28:37] they aren't people
[1:28:38] that's not inspired so what do they want
[1:28:42] yeah we gotta fight for our rights we
[1:28:45] gotta fight for this we gotta fight for
[1:28:47] this we have to fight for this they're
[1:28:49] not inspired
[1:28:50] but as the bride of Jesus Christ listen
[1:28:52] friends I'm not puffing us up I'm
[1:28:54] declaring what the Word of God has said
[1:28:57] concerning you and I our hope my hope is
[1:29:01] not in legislation my hope my trust is
[1:29:07] in the Lord
[1:29:09] lord have mercy if I thought about all
[1:29:11] the legislation what ever more I'd be a
[1:29:13] nutcase understand friends why do I want
[1:29:19] to keep up with all the legislation will
[1:29:20] really save me you want to do that so
[1:29:21] you're not a dummy so you're not an
[1:29:22] idiot well if this is being a dummy and
[1:29:24] in any of them let me alone but I want
[1:29:26] to be so occupied with the promise of
[1:29:29] God I don't want to be occupied with oh
[1:29:32] my goodness they're coming to get to
[1:29:34] this section and go straight oh my
[1:29:35] goodness they're coming in there's this
[1:29:36] this section knows it oh my goodness in
[1:29:37] Goshen right now they're letting a
[1:29:39] little little boys shower with little
[1:29:40] girls oh my goodness I don't want to be
[1:29:42] occupied with that not that I'm
[1:29:43] condoning it but I don't want my energy
[1:29:46] taken to where I'm all about that and my
[1:29:49] life is depleted spiritually and I'm
[1:29:51] left here because I got my eyes on the
[1:29:55] wrong thing Jesus has said when you
[1:29:58] begin to see these things come to pass
[1:30:05] your Redemption draws nigh so brother
[1:30:12] Samuel you're okay with it I didn't say
[1:30:14] I was okay with that what I said is that
[1:30:16] God had not anointed us to come under
[1:30:20] that we are a people that are inspired
[1:30:23] by the Holy Ghost in this hour look at
[1:30:28] friends the law some things that are
[1:30:31] changing and how things are moving
[1:30:33] around and you find things look there is
[1:30:37] a congealing the Prophet could look back
[1:30:39] there and talk about the World Council
[1:30:41] of Churches he could say he could scream
[1:30:43] out with such an urgency I've often
[1:30:45] wondered when the brother Brown stood
[1:30:47] there and he screamed out that way in
[1:30:48] this world is falling apart again I
[1:30:50] wonder what they must have thought
[1:30:54] brother bream even calls that I don't
[1:30:56] hate down in Shreveport the Spirit of
[1:30:59] God discerns their thoughts anything
[1:31:01] brother branham's our old cranks I think
[1:31:02] he's this the thing is that but you know
[1:31:04] it is a profit of seeing seeds let me
[1:31:07] just lay this in I'm not making the
[1:31:08] Martin Luther King thing thus saith the
[1:31:10] Lord coz brother Branham didn't but I do
[1:31:11] say this right here I do look at those
[1:31:14] things very closely because I studied
[1:31:15] what was he seeing that he said I have
[1:31:17] an opinion on I want to see what he's
[1:31:19] saying I hope you're all hope you're all
[1:31:22] right with that I'm not making it dust
[1:31:23] saith the Lord but I know he's seen
[1:31:25] something
[1:31:25] it's just like when brother Graham says
[1:31:27] when people have a problem with on 1977
[1:31:30] you know I predict you know under divine
[1:31:32] inspiration what's wrong what's wrong
[1:31:34] with that statement you get inspired to
[1:31:36] and I have to and predicted things and
[1:31:38] thought things and yet we were under
[1:31:40] real true inspiration I think it was I
[1:31:47] think it was brother Lonnie mentioned
[1:31:50] years ago he said the reason is he said
[1:31:53] brother Brennan has made that statement
[1:31:54] he said because it was pitch black and
[1:31:56] he couldn't see anything beyond that
[1:31:58] time I'm not arguing with those
[1:32:04] statements to me I stand with it brother
[1:32:07] I mean how can you say when he said
[1:32:09] that's your opinion his opinion and you
[1:32:10] can say okay I'll take therefore opinion
[1:32:12] but I want to look and see how can you
[1:32:13] say that because God vindicated the wire
[1:32:15] he's revealed who it is to me this is
[1:32:18] Jesus Christ revealed to me the brand is
[1:32:22] not Jesus Christ but it's Christ
[1:32:23] revealed in his word that's simple cuz
[1:32:28] I'm it just saying like this I'll take
[1:32:30] his opinion any day over your opinion
[1:32:31] and I'll take it any day over my opinion
[1:32:35] if I had a mirror right now I'd say take
[1:32:38] that Oh glory well I gotta come down
[1:32:44] here tonight sometime man I'm getting
[1:32:49] there quit pulling now ha ha jessabelle
[1:32:55] religion in this message brother venom I
[1:32:59] didn't put it up here but let me read
[1:33:01] this part brother Ram talks about how
[1:33:02] Jezebel was the head behind the throne
[1:33:05] this is 61 she was the one that done the
[1:33:10] leading in this instrument these are not
[1:33:14] Bible stories
[1:33:15] there's the profit can look and say that
[1:33:17] was prophecy for right now prophecy for
[1:33:22] right now here we are we're living in
[1:33:24] the days of ahab and jezebel and the
[1:33:27] same one could say we are living in the
[1:33:29] days of his revealing himself unto
[1:33:31] Abraham in an Abrahamic age well then
[1:33:36] what happened miss Bible is not a book a
[1:33:38] book of stories this Bible has become
[1:33:40] alive to you and I we see well act blood
[1:33:45] revealing himself personally it's you
[1:33:47] and I looking in the word like Abraham
[1:33:49] sitting in front of the tent looking and
[1:33:51] they come you and I live that kind of a
[1:33:54] way setting there and looking for him
[1:33:56] because we by God's grace had been
[1:33:59] brought in tune and in sync with the
[1:34:01] angel of the Lord and we are looking for
[1:34:04] him brem says look how she took the very
[1:34:10] laws of the land and twisted them around
[1:34:13] I don't have time to show you this but
[1:34:15] remember when she wanted that vineyard
[1:34:18] they have one of the vineyard but he
[1:34:21] couldn't get it but she says we'll work
[1:34:25] some things around here what's she doing
[1:34:27] she's moving him he's looking at like
[1:34:31] this his own idea she's being moved by
[1:34:34] his spirit they're trying to do what
[1:34:36] take me bossed vineyard that's his
[1:34:39] inheritance Oh glory be to God that same
[1:34:43] Jezebel spirit has worked from the very
[1:34:45] beginning of the outpouring of the Holy
[1:34:47] Ghost to try to do what take away the
[1:34:49] real true birth of the Holy Ghost that
[1:34:54] is my inheritance they meant that have
[1:34:57] Christ in my life
[1:34:59] for him to be walking present in my life
[1:35:02] that is my inheritance amen this message
[1:35:06] that God has sent to us in this
[1:35:08] generation is the revealing of our
[1:35:11] inheritance
[1:35:12] [Music]
[1:35:13] absolutely but she worked with the
[1:35:19] different feast of Israel and those laws
[1:35:22] and she mixes it all together to call a
[1:35:26] feast and a fasting she's she's
[1:35:29] intertwining those things you would look
[1:35:31] at you think wait a minute oh no brother
[1:35:33] Samuel Jezebel when she stood up there
[1:35:36] she said there's a separation of church
[1:35:38] and state I read this week again more
[1:35:43] fully President Kennedy's speech that he
[1:35:48] gave to the Greater Houston Ministerial
[1:35:52] Association and aspra the purpose of
[1:35:56] that speech was to convince those men
[1:35:59] that I am NOT gonna side with
[1:36:02] Catholicism when I am elected no
[1:36:05] Catholic is gonna persuade me these are
[1:36:07] his statements I can email you the
[1:36:09] article
[1:36:10] they've exact transcript his whole thing
[1:36:12] is to try to take it and say I believe
[1:36:15] in a separation of church and state I
[1:36:16] believe in this there'll be no influence
[1:36:18] you know what brother Branham said
[1:36:20] concerning President Kennedy's election
[1:36:22] in condemnation by representation for
[1:36:26] the brem says for them he speaks he says
[1:36:28] how that the end brother Graham says the
[1:36:30] colored vote how that they gave that
[1:36:32] vote for for for Kennedy he's he likens
[1:36:36] it to that Sletten that that the slave
[1:36:39] spitting on Abraham Lincoln's garment he
[1:36:42] said what they did would be equivalent
[1:36:44] to me spitting on the blood of Jesus
[1:36:47] Christ that's a powerful statement
[1:36:50] because he said they don't know what
[1:36:52] this what they've done brother Bram
[1:36:55] takes a whole three quarters of the
[1:36:57] message condemnation by representation
[1:36:59] he's raised of giving announcement he
[1:37:01] says remember I told you last week pray
[1:37:03] before you go into the voting booths he
[1:37:07] said but look what the nation has done
[1:37:08] and when you read that transcript it
[1:37:11] sounds very much like it sounds like oh
[1:37:12] this guy's not gonna be he's not gonna
[1:37:14] be influenced by religion he's not gonna
[1:37:16] be influenced at all he's not it's a
[1:37:20] spirit the guy was suave and debonair
[1:37:22] and everything else
[1:37:25] that's exactly right but it was a spirit
[1:37:29] he could not help it let someone just
[1:37:31] think of this Oh God can I have just a
[1:37:33] few more moments I want you to look at
[1:37:36] this I want you to think of this the
[1:37:38] Prophet by inspiration is able to see
[1:37:41] this what's motivating Kennedy is that
[1:37:43] right but he's able to see it's a spear
[1:37:46] behind him to even to the place there
[1:37:48] where he could say no doubt he's a good
[1:37:49] man and when he was shot brother bream
[1:37:52] didn't say he got what was coming to him
[1:37:54] he never said that he said all that poor
[1:37:57] Widow oh did you see those children
[1:37:59] oh let's pray for them tonight this is
[1:38:03] the kind of character that brought the
[1:38:04] word in this hour where it was able to
[1:38:08] see wrong and you have to have the right
[1:38:11] kind of attitude towards it I say God my
[1:38:16] hands up in my heart of God help me Lord
[1:38:18] Jesus I see this when I look at that and
[1:38:21] the Prophet said how God uses the
[1:38:22] messenger that's an example of what he
[1:38:25] how he wants to use every believer
[1:38:26] that's what I'm focused on I'm not
[1:38:28] focused on that I'll have to see visions
[1:38:30] I have to do that that's not it I can
[1:38:32] see that that word brought a smile to
[1:38:34] maturity I could have that same
[1:38:38] expectation in my life Oh glory to God
[1:38:44] you love him the Prophet said like
[1:38:47] Israel and recognizing your day in its
[1:38:50] message back in her promised land
[1:38:55] she don't know how she got back there
[1:38:59] now you might say well brother Samuel if
[1:39:01] we talk to Israel today Israel remember
[1:39:05] what I was talking about this in 1963
[1:39:06] Israel could say this and say this and
[1:39:09] say this but it's a mystery you say well
[1:39:15] bro same well they know that this
[1:39:17] happened this time in this but it's a
[1:39:19] mystery what started things moving walls
[1:39:24] were being changed things were being
[1:39:26] taken place and it was moving them
[1:39:29] turning their hearts do you realize
[1:39:31] right now you realize how many Jews are
[1:39:33] going back to the whole land yearly
[1:39:35] thousands you can look this up
[1:39:39] you can see that the the the clips right
[1:39:41] there fear of going back to their
[1:39:43] homeland there are still streams of Jews
[1:39:45] going back to the homeland you said
[1:39:49] brother Sam you talked about a thousand
[1:39:50] tooth no no I'm not talking about one or
[1:39:51] two thousand I'm talking about 30,000
[1:39:53] 50,000 these strings there's an act
[1:39:56] there there is after what took place
[1:39:59] remember when they were going in Yemen
[1:40:01] and here they were to fly those Jews
[1:40:03] from Yemen and flew him back into the
[1:40:06] homeland do you realize that the airline
[1:40:08] that flew them was an airline that was
[1:40:11] ready for bankruptcy that airline was on
[1:40:15] the verge of collapse you say what good
[1:40:18] would that be think about it if it had
[1:40:21] been an airline that would have we got
[1:40:22] it made we don't need to worry about
[1:40:24] that but God moved upon their hearts and
[1:40:29] they went down there and flew the
[1:40:32] mission they took the seats out of the
[1:40:33] plane loaded him onto the plane but you
[1:40:36] know what the Jews that were standing
[1:40:37] there they had ladders to get on the
[1:40:39] plane I don't mind to tell you I don't
[1:40:41] like getting on a high ladder myself I
[1:40:44] really don't but here they are and
[1:40:48] they're looking and I'm reading about
[1:40:50] these things the Jews were not gonna get
[1:40:52] on they were afraid but their rabbis
[1:40:54] spoke up at that time and so you
[1:40:56] remember he said that we will return on
[1:40:59] the wings of an eagle he caught this
[1:41:05] right here and they could say airplane
[1:41:08] but notice they were not questioning
[1:41:10] they moved the word was spoken at the
[1:41:13] right time they were in position it
[1:41:15] caused him to move and that airline now
[1:41:19] is a well-known airline Alaskan Airlines
[1:41:22] and its partners with other line there's
[1:41:24] many underneath it because of their
[1:41:26] simple obedience see God had to have him
[1:41:30] in a position of what humility I'm not
[1:41:33] calling the other airlines out but it
[1:41:35] could've been an airline sir we ain't
[1:41:37] doing that we're not doing this but God
[1:41:40] had an airline that was they were they
[1:41:43] were in a place of really to be humble
[1:41:48] and because they were willing to be
[1:41:51] obedient here they are
[1:41:54] how many airlines you know and I know
[1:41:56] where those airlines themselves over
[1:41:58] collaborate with this airline we go with
[1:42:00] merge with this airline well we're no
[1:42:01] longer gonna be operating a Cleveland
[1:42:02] now we're gonna how many of you know
[1:42:04] that many of them you understand what
[1:42:08] I'm saying all of these things even the
[1:42:10] mission that's flowing back in there
[1:42:12] it's a mystery but these things begin to
[1:42:14] turning bringing them back into the land
[1:42:17] she was just automatically put back
[1:42:20] there
[1:42:21] why national force put her in her place
[1:42:23] he says I'm gonna say something national
[1:42:27] force put Israel in her homeland
[1:42:29] national force will put the church in
[1:42:33] the World Council of Churches see all
[1:42:36] these long when you see the evangelicals
[1:42:40] rallying a whole board this is good
[1:42:42] remember remember it's just like how
[1:42:45] things are taking place and even right
[1:42:46] now in Russia you know in Russia we just
[1:42:48] just received a report here that over
[1:42:52] there and in one in the in the st.
[1:42:53] Petersburg newspaper press they are
[1:42:56] forbidding the message to be preached
[1:42:58] until the court date of January not
[1:43:04] allowed to be preached Britta Simon
[1:43:08] what's gonna come out of this that's not
[1:43:10] for me to try to figure out all I want
[1:43:13] to do is walk faithful step by step by
[1:43:16] step by step just because that's
[1:43:20] happened doesn't give me a right
[1:43:21] tomorrow to sit down and eat whole cakes
[1:43:22] and pop-tarts and put my feet up and
[1:43:24] drink iced tea you understand we're
[1:43:27] gonna do them all get up and pray and
[1:43:29] study the Word of God and live for Jesus
[1:43:31] Christ and it might be within a moment
[1:43:34] in a twinkling and I I'll be changed you
[1:43:40] might be getting ready to hear you know
[1:43:42] on the keyboard and all of a sudden
[1:43:43] enter but there's another enters its
[1:43:46] come enter and you changed you're
[1:43:50] getting ready to put another another
[1:43:51] part on a code but there's another code
[1:43:53] that fully comes into place changed in a
[1:43:56] moment in a twinkling of an eye
[1:43:57] Oh glory you love him
[1:44:01] these powers are putting this the
[1:44:03] Council of Churches into place all these
[1:44:05] laws these things that's what I'm
[1:44:06] getting to is that within Russia the
[1:44:08] same thing in other places you can only
[1:44:10] be if you're recognized by the state
[1:44:16] there's a brother send me you mean to
[1:44:18] tell me that you think that the
[1:44:19] government is gonna force everybody to
[1:44:21] preach that it's permissible to allow
[1:44:24] homosexuality no I don't necessarily
[1:44:26] think that but I do believe that there
[1:44:29] could be a covering to where you must be
[1:44:31] in here if not in here and you're out
[1:44:34] there you can't do nothing you
[1:44:38] understand what I'm saying you have to
[1:44:40] be inside of here if you're outside of
[1:44:41] here your speech is not free see there's
[1:44:45] forces it's precious that's why the
[1:44:48] Prophet could say that has the scripture
[1:44:52] says in the I will keep thee in the hour
[1:44:54] of temptation really Bram could say
[1:44:57] there will be many who at that time will
[1:44:59] say we can serve the lord better in this
[1:45:02] system no no we serve the Lord by
[1:45:05] staying with him though all hell a sell
[1:45:11] me I shall not be moved
[1:45:15] is that right but the power of God would
[1:45:21] put the people in the bride and to you
[1:45:26] it's a mystery but it's a mystery now
[1:45:28] that is revealed to you how did God has
[1:45:32] brought you opened our eyes what is it
[1:45:36] it's God Himself by the power of God
[1:45:39] putting us in the right not our
[1:45:41] intellect oh because yeah I true this I
[1:45:43] didn't know no no because all the
[1:45:46] doctors are true no no no if I've met
[1:45:48] him and when I meet him then all the
[1:45:51] other doctrines will they find their
[1:45:53] place in my life and I find my place in
[1:45:55] them they become protection on the life
[1:46:01] in the tree
[1:46:07] maybe just a little of a background that
[1:46:10] how God is spoke to us tonight but a
[1:46:13] musician's if you come sometimes as we
[1:46:17] see this sometimes we don't see the
[1:46:20] things that are are taking place and
[1:46:22] sometimes we wonder where things are
[1:46:24] going on and bringing it down from here
[1:46:27] in that level bringing it down into our
[1:46:29] own lives that's that that's really my
[1:46:31] focus of where I'm coming to with all
[1:46:32] this right here we're just getting
[1:46:34] scratched but some of these these
[1:46:36] pressures some of these changes some of
[1:46:38] these things are taking place how even
[1:46:40] God will allow things to take place
[1:46:41] around you and I
[1:46:44] for what reason for what purpose that he
[1:46:48] might declare himself and that his word
[1:46:51] might be fulfilled he friends when we're
[1:46:55] talking about word being fulfilled we're
[1:46:57] not just talking about the final climax
[1:47:01] of all of this we're talking about his
[1:47:04] character in his life
[1:47:06] being being formed in our lives
[1:47:10] being shaped in the midst of our lives
[1:47:12] us being made ready i I don't know the
[1:47:16] day nor the hour but I know I'm living
[1:47:18] in a time I know that and the end and
[1:47:21] the urgency upon my heart and the
[1:47:23] urgency upon your heart and should be on
[1:47:26] your heart my heart is to be ready I
[1:47:30] want the word to examine me I wanted to
[1:47:34] examine my feelings addict my objectives
[1:47:38] I wanted to examine me thoroughly I
[1:47:41] don't want I don't want to walk in a
[1:47:45] place to say
[1:47:46] so unsold this or this they're done this
[1:47:50] was Saturday I don't want to walk in
[1:47:52] them places
[1:47:53] you understand what I'm saying I want we
[1:47:56] want to see Gordon molding and shaping
[1:47:58] you're not realize listen what I'm
[1:48:00] saying Fran is this is not so much about
[1:48:01] listing things it's God let my heart be
[1:48:06] so in tune with you to where I'm able to
[1:48:09] discern what's trying to work behind it
[1:48:14] and still be able to look at the veil
[1:48:17] and say you know what I love you still
[1:48:22] be able to look at the veil and say now
[1:48:23] you might not tell your boss I love you
[1:48:25] you may not do that I mean it just
[1:48:27] wouldn't be appropriate and some things
[1:48:28] like this but in your heart you could
[1:48:31] say I appreciate you you understand
[1:48:34] there's things that you that can come
[1:48:36] our way brother or sister or whatever
[1:48:39] more you say you know what thank you
[1:48:41] lord
[1:48:41] appreciate you sir brother say no this
[1:48:44] this bothers me so much but do you
[1:48:46] realize it isn't the person it isn't the
[1:48:49] thing it's God allowing us to see
[1:48:51] there's a part of agitation about life
[1:48:55] that he wants to minister and manifest
[1:49:00] his glory
[1:49:04] the sender how how is this I have this
[1:49:07] trouble I have this situation friends
[1:49:09] listen I can't explain these things I
[1:49:12] can't explain it
[1:49:13] I can't explain my own life you
[1:49:15] understand I can't explain that I can't
[1:49:18] explain God I can't explain me I'm
[1:49:20] talking about just me as a person I
[1:49:22] can't explain that but I know who has
[1:49:25] who's in control
[1:49:29] and like Joseph like I say can you say
[1:49:33] tonight Lord I don't know what's all
[1:49:36] come along but I know I'm a believer I
[1:49:40] know I'm a believer Lord and if I can
[1:49:44] have we can have that confidence then I
[1:49:46] can look to the Lord and say Lord all of
[1:49:48] these other things when you bring things
[1:49:51] to my attention it's not up to me to try
[1:49:53] to change them it's from me to you to
[1:49:56] pray over I want you to think of this if
[1:49:59] there are things that God made known to
[1:50:01] you I about our life and he does what if
[1:50:04] what if when we prayed about it the
[1:50:07] first little thing we notice I'm
[1:50:09] bothered about this and we praise O God
[1:50:10] I don't want this about my life and all
[1:50:12] of a sudden it's lifted and it's gone
[1:50:14] there wouldn't be any travail in our
[1:50:16] life
[1:50:17] but see that travail you know what that
[1:50:20] travail does for God God says listen to
[1:50:24] him they want to be so lined with my
[1:50:28] character and though you and I can't
[1:50:31] hear the conversation but even in the
[1:50:34] midst of that travail God's bragging
[1:50:37] God's bragging because for anybody else
[1:50:41] or any other person they would be
[1:50:43] content but God's bragging on you and I
[1:50:48] then when we come through that and
[1:50:51] finally when the release is coming or
[1:50:54] mine you can say lord thank you thank
[1:50:58] you lord
[1:50:58] sometimes when things comes it's just
[1:51:01] like when a favor rises up who knows not
[1:51:03] Joseph it's the beginning of the
[1:51:05] beginning then you find something else
[1:51:07] spirals something else and you find
[1:51:10] if we're not careful we find ourselves
[1:51:12] enslaved
[1:51:15] feelings attitudes thoughts we find
[1:51:19] ourselves enslaved but I believe tonight
[1:51:25] God has called us to stand fast in this
[1:51:30] glorious Liberty but Jesus Christ I
[1:51:33] don't know what tomorrow holds neither
[1:51:35] do you but I know who holds the future
