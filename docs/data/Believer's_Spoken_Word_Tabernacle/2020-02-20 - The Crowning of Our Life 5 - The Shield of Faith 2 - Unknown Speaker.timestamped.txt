[5:22] him tonight Abel is paid by the Richard
[5:25] [Music]
[5:30] you can be seated for a minute me and
[5:36] Maria we just wanted to thank the church
[5:38] for those at the from Ileana we just
[5:44] want to say that you know just as you
[5:47] guys refer there's many many people even
[5:48] different religions everybody in the
[5:50] frame we were just hoping that the Lord
[5:53] were with healing and really what
[5:58] happened was they went to Cincinnati
[6:00] five times for trial
[6:02] clinical trials each time and they went
[6:08] the Boston one time they they were
[6:12] getting some treatment from the
[6:13] Cleveland Clinic here at the end but
[6:15] this last Wednesday they went to
[6:19] Cleveland Clinic I mean they went
[6:21] through Cincinnati and he went down
[6:25] there Wednesday they came back Thursday
[6:27] they were very very soberly on it and
[6:32] gave me with the bed my son called me at
[6:40] 12:30 big guy
[6:48] and by then the head her breathing she's
[6:52] doing seizures so then I took my guy
[6:56] home and and they took her to the main
[6:59] campus at that Friday morning the same
[7:03] day I went back to the Cleveland Clinic
[7:05] for doing ok that rusty very peaceful
[7:09] they were still doing tests so by the
[7:13] time I got home and maybe later we found
[7:15] out he had a massive stroke he was
[7:19] bleeding in the brain and the only thing
[7:21] they could do for her was upgrade on her
[7:23] brain and put a trait through and they
[7:28] went against it by then I already knew a
[7:30] little bit I told Samuel I wasn't for
[7:33] that either but they decided to do
[7:37] so then they called us all back up there
[7:40] Friday for three days it was very let's
[7:44] say very very far samuel was able to
[7:51] come up Friday and sit a small prayer
[7:56] there
[7:57] [Music]
[7:58] and the presence of the Lord came and we
[8:03] had some real hard time but we all said
[8:06] but sometimes my son would bring up
[8:08] videos of her and we laughed we you know
[8:12] we do it really happy thinking about the
[8:15] way she was and everything probably the
[8:18] saddest part that I've ever seen him
[8:20] behind seems sad things said here's
[8:27] Jamie was in the bed with her
[8:30] Jamie's in bed with her Jasper on one
[8:33] side
[8:34] Jamie at once this was Friday mostly
[8:37] Friday and they were just talking to her
[8:40] crying and he was just very sad very sad
[8:44] to see the love of a father in love and
[8:47] there's nothing that you could do one
[8:51] thing about those three days she has
[8:52] always done morphine's was always
[8:54] comfortable he had a few days breathing
[8:58] but at the end when she passed away
[9:02] Rachel the other side
[9:10] they were both in bed with her at the
[9:15] end
[9:16] passed away real quietly they were able
[9:19] to give her a bath when she was all said
[9:23] and done always really really good just
[9:32] continue to keep them in for Saturday
[9:36] and Sunday
[9:43] one thing that while this process was
[9:46] going on Maria would talk to me I asked
[9:51] her about these being apart she would
[9:54] always say that Jesus was dinner and one
[9:59] six days before they went to Cincinnati
[10:01] before she passed away I went over there
[10:05] and I felt her a little bit we're gonna
[10:07] pray and I prayed with her and then I
[10:11] said in the name of Jesus Christ and she
[10:13] goes amen
[10:14] and she smiled so I looked at her and I
[10:18] said she could hardly talk she could
[10:20] hardly talk just very weak I looked at
[10:22] her and I said I just love it when you
[10:24] say Amen and I love when you spot so you
[10:28] know we just got to keep them in prayer
[10:31] because he was just so hard it's
[10:36] heartbreaking to see what they went
[10:37] through and one more time
[10:46] father we just want to thank you for all
[10:49] that you've done
[10:50] we know that by grace and it's by faith

[11:07] and Jaimee and Jazmyn makai we just ask
[11:11] that you be with them and give them
[11:13] comfort and give them stress given that
[11:15] peace even though they don't know you we
[11:20] ask that you might be with them Lord
[11:22] Jesus have mercy upon their soul thank
[11:28] you Lord for the time that we had with
[11:31] Liliana and all the good memories
[11:35] one day Lord we know that we'll see her

[11:41] her father we have these other prayer
[11:44] requests for loved ones for families

[37:11] words that can be said but yet we we
[37:14] want the the Spirit of God to come
[37:17] present there and because that's
[37:21] something that it where a person might

[37:59] us I want to go ahead and just bring
[38:02] this just feeling on my heart to go
[38:03] ahead and continue on with that tonight
[38:06] I trust the Lord will just guide and
[38:09] direct us here tonight he knows what our
[38:10] needs are and we know that God is is
[38:14] always he's right on time so as we look
[38:18] in the word if you want to go ahead and
[38:20] turn with me to second Corinthians
[38:22] chapter 10 and verse 3 we'll begin there
[38:41] also remember a brother Richard you
[38:44] might have mentioned this I couldn't
[38:46] hear it real clear until they turned it
[38:48] up back there for me but to remember the
[38:50] viewing for Liliana that will be on this
[38:53] coming Saturday from 2:00 to 7:00 and we
[38:57] have sent out by email we sent out the
[38:59] link or the actual obituary and one
[39:03] thing I just want to mention to you that
[39:05] there's some of you right now and I
[39:07] don't know who you are but you you have
[39:10] it you need to update your email and so
[39:13] I need you to fill that out if your
[39:14] email is out of date or you need to
[39:17] check on it you need to check on that
[39:19] with sister Rosanna so that we make sure
[39:21] that we're getting you the communication
[39:23] that needs to be got and we try to do
[39:26] that and for those who have Facebook I
[39:28] don't myself but we try to also put
[39:31] certain things out there that are
[39:33] related to the church maybe
[39:35] announcements and things like that as
[39:37] well so if you wouldn't mind just kind
[39:39] of looking over maybe just a you can ask
[39:41] sister Rosanna what would email do you
[39:43] have on file for me and then we can go
[39:45] from there and get that all straightened
[39:47] out so let's look here in second
[39:50] Corinthians chapter 10 verse 3 Paul says
[39:55] for though we walk in the flesh we do
[40:01] not war after the flesh for the weapons
[40:06] of our warfare are not carnal but mighty
[40:12] through God so when God has given us
[40:19] that of his armor we have with within
[40:23] and on us those weapons but yet those
[40:27] weapons are meant to be used under his
[40:32] leadership that's our strength amen for
[40:37] our weapons of our warfare are not
[40:39] carnal but mighty through God to the
[40:44] pulling down of strongholds look at this
[40:49] verse verse 5
[40:50] casting down imaginations and then
[40:54] incredible that's been put into our
[40:56] hands
[40:57] they shall cast out Devils Satan was
[41:02] cast out of heaven are you with me when
[41:05] he comes around you are to cast him out
[41:08] he brings the fault he brings up cast
[41:12] him out you have a forty to cast him out
[41:16] Andrea notice the placement and verse
[41:18] five casting down imaginations and every
[41:23] high thing that exalteth itself against
[41:27] the knowledge of God and bringing into
[41:29] captivity every thought to the obedience
[41:32] of Christ and having in a readiness to
[41:36] revenge all disobedience when your
[41:39] obedience is fulfilled let's just bow
[41:43] our heads in a word of Prayer Lord Jesus
[41:46] as we Lord would just come into this
[41:50] moment of the service nor do we want to
[41:53] say that we're just so thankful
[41:55] Oh God thank you for Lord your
[41:58] loving-kindness Lord thank you Lord for
[42:02] your mercy and your grace upon our lives
[42:05] Lord we thank you Lord how that you work
[42:09] with us Lord how you deal with our
[42:11] hearts Lord and father how oh God you
[42:15] strengthen us Lord through this journey
[42:18] Lord God and father as a Lord we take
[42:22] these few moments Lord to look into the
[42:25] Word of God Lord we ask that you would
[42:27] just common take control tonight Lord
[42:30] you know what our needs are tonight you
[42:34] know what needs to be said the way that
[42:36] it would need to be said Oh God
[42:39] for every request that's gathered your
[42:42] Lord for the thoughts nor the intents
[42:45] everything God that's on the heart lord
[42:47] I just pray that God that you Lord that
[42:50] you would come and speak personally may
[42:52] your presence Lord Oh God just move Lord
[42:56] God through your word Lord and just
[42:59] touch hearts and lives and God I pray
[43:02] that Lord if there be any hole
[43:04] the enemy Lord Oh God let it be Lord
[43:08] removed here tonight Lord may faith just
[43:11] rise Oh God in that word to know what
[43:15] you have done for us Lord everyone right
[43:18] here in this building Lord and everyone
[43:20] that would be listening Lord even under
[43:22] the sound of my voice God to recognize
[43:25] the Lord what you've already done may
[43:28] our faith Lord just release that now
[43:31] Lord
[43:32] Oh God we just ask that you help us Lord
[43:36] speak to our hearts personally we pray
[43:38] in Jesus name Amen may God bless you as
[43:42] you're being seated I look at this this
[43:49] thought and we have been looking at the
[43:52] the armor of God the weapons of our of
[43:58] our warfare Paul would mention as we
[44:02] look at this that the the the weapons of
[44:06] our warfare are not carnal but they are
[44:08] mighty through God you remember how Paul
[44:12] will mention even in the scripture in
[44:14] the book of Romans Paul will mention and
[44:17] in the book of Colossians and he would
[44:19] deal with even in our lives of how that
[44:22] through the spirit we are to mortify the
[44:25] deeds of the body it would do no good
[44:28] for us of our own strength but through
[44:31] the strength of Almighty God he gives to
[44:34] us the grace by the quickening power to
[44:37] bring our lives in subjection to the
[44:40] Word of God because truly when God has
[44:43] touched a heart and God has dealt with a
[44:46] life the greatest desire that we would
[44:48] have within our hearts is to please the
[44:50] Lord it moves from from a place of just
[44:53] you know wanting to Lord I want to give
[44:55] my I want to surrender and it never
[44:57] moves from a place of just surrendering
[45:00] we want to continue to give to the Lord
[45:02] but then we recognize that within our
[45:04] lives that has God has touched our lives
[45:07] in our hearts that in win-win who has
[45:10] he's moved in our lives we did not enter
[45:13] a picnic and I know we've heard these
[45:15] words many times before
[45:17] there are truly times in our life where
[45:19] we have reprieve we have rest we have
[45:23] times that the rest will come it says
[45:25] that in the book of Acts when there
[45:27] would be rest and there would be times
[45:29] of trials and temptations and things
[45:32] would come and to the church even when
[45:35] we look at the Lord Jesus he would come
[45:37] through a time of testing of trial but
[45:40] then at the end of it when that season
[45:42] was over the Bible said the angels came
[45:44] and ministered unto him so God knows
[45:47] exactly what you and I what we have need
[45:49] of and to think of it that has God has
[45:52] given to us this armor and if I can be
[45:56] just as you know pointed and saying it
[45:58] God will never come down and use the
[46:01] shield of faith that he's given me he'll
[46:04] never use it for me but he requires me
[46:07] to use this shield of faith that he has
[46:09] given me all rebid of this armor is that
[46:12] which God has issued to you and I that
[46:16] we would that we would use it and that's
[46:18] why he gave it to us we are not we're
[46:21] not here to parade around but it's here
[46:23] we are in a battle we are in a war and
[46:26] God prepares us as he's prepared every
[46:29] generation God has prepared us in this
[46:32] hour for the battle that that we are in
[46:36] even right now and you know the
[46:39] scripture would would go on to say here
[46:42] in the book of Ephesians picking up in
[46:44] that of the shield of faith and it would
[46:46] say above all taking on taking the
[46:49] shield of faith wherewith you shall be
[46:53] able to quench all the fiery darts of
[46:55] the wicked and as we were looking at
[46:58] that a little bit and starting in on
[47:00] that on Sunday that the above all it
[47:02] deals with a putting upon or a putting
[47:05] between our lives ourselves and the
[47:09] opposing enemy it is in our hands to
[47:12] take up that shield and brother Ana
[47:13] would say it like this he said that's
[47:15] the shield that knocks off the darts you
[47:18] see the reality even though God has
[47:21] given to us the helmet of salvation the
[47:23] breastplate of righteousness all of the
[47:26] other armament but yet the shield of
[47:28] faith is what will Quinn
[47:30] the fiery darts of the enemy the shield
[47:32] of faith was not just a shield that was
[47:34] given for when there would be battles
[47:37] within sword that was a part of it but
[47:40] Paul noticed the inspiration of the
[47:42] Spirit of God was not drawn to say take
[47:45] up the shield whereby you shall be able
[47:48] to remove every glance of the enemy
[47:51] sword there is a part within it but Paul
[47:53] would see of how that that shield of
[47:56] faith would be used to absolutely quench
[47:59] every not just some but every pirate
[48:02] part of the enemy
[48:04] yeah the reality that we we look at this
[48:07] where David would express this and I
[48:10] think as we were looking at some of this
[48:12] here on on Sunday God has given us this
[48:16] armor and it's like David would say in
[48:19] one place of the scripture he teaches my
[48:21] fingers to fight David would say in
[48:25] another place he teaches my hands to war
[48:27] and I'll say it like this we need
[48:30] training and brother Brandon would put
[48:32] it out in the contest and all the way
[48:34] down putting on the home of God taking
[48:36] on the home of God greatest battle ever
[48:38] fought on and on that the training that
[48:40] is a must and a need is where that a man
[48:44] or a woman would be come in dude with
[48:47] the power of the Holy Ghost not just
[48:50] something that becomes upon our flesh or
[48:52] upon our mind in our spirit but that
[48:55] which goes down and becomes a living
[48:58] reality in our life and there's a change
[49:01] on the inside where then the word
[49:04] becomes seeded in power in our life and
[49:08] this is the training that because once
[49:11] that training has come no matter what
[49:13] you and I can face we have already
[49:17] overcome because we have the overcomer
[49:20] within us we might fail but yet we have
[49:24] the overcomer
[49:25] within us he will guide us he can direct
[49:28] us on how to use the sword and I you
[49:31] know just to maybe to speak of this a
[49:33] little bit there's things that God has
[49:35] even had to teach us on how to use the
[49:37] sword instead of when we're witnessing
[49:39] cutting people's heads off we take the
[49:41] sword and are trying to
[49:43] point them instead of slicing are you
[49:46] with me God teaches us how to use this
[49:49] armor because when we receive it we need
[49:52] we need to know how to use it how to be
[49:55] effective with this armor and I I
[49:58] believe that's what everyone of us as
[50:00] Christians want to be we want to be we
[50:02] want to be better Christians and I and I
[50:05] think of how you know the scripture in
[50:08] first chronicles 12 8 when it would
[50:10] speak of the gadites and then they were
[50:12] separated the Bible says themselves unto
[50:15] David into the whole to the wilderness
[50:18] men of might and men of war fit for the
[50:23] battle these guys came ready to fight
[50:27] they came ready to fight God prepares us
[50:32] for the fight now notice how one of the
[50:36] descriptions that is is is mentioned
[50:39] here they could handle shield and
[50:42] buckler whose faces were like the faces
[50:45] of lions and were as Swift as the rose
[50:48] upon the mountains you know it's one
[50:50] thing to be able to handle the buckler
[50:51] meaning shield or spear it's one thing
[50:54] to be able to handle the sword one thing
[50:56] to be able to handle you know that of a
[50:59] spear but it's another thing to be able
[51:01] to handle the shield you can handle the
[51:04] sword but it listen all of these parts
[51:06] work together if we're not handling the
[51:08] shield correctly it's a good possibility
[51:10] that we are not handling the sword
[51:13] correctly all of these parts are linked
[51:16] together are you with me so this was the
[51:20] testimony that they could handle shield
[51:23] and buckler brother branham would pick
[51:24] it up in Satan's Eden and he would talk
[51:27] about the hour that we are we are living
[51:30] in and he would speak of the desire that
[51:33] would be upon his heart to bring
[51:35] something to the people that would
[51:36] enlighten us for the promise of God for
[51:39] this age now he said I'm not reaching
[51:42] back to what somebody else for some
[51:44] other age but to enlighten us in the
[51:47] promise for this hour this hour that
[51:50] we're living in it is an hour that is
[51:53] just as deceptive if not more
[51:56] so then going back to that of the Garden
[51:58] of Eden and remember what the deception
[52:01] was Satan never came to Eve with
[52:05] something he never walked up to her with
[52:07] the bottle of Jack Daniels he came and
[52:09] attacked her with a word and so this is
[52:13] exactly where Satan he launches his
[52:16] attack is attack in trying to launch it
[52:19] through the word and let's just be real
[52:21] here tonight there is not one of us and
[52:24] that includes preachers as well that is
[52:27] able to withstand the attack of the
[52:29] enemy in our mind or in our body there
[52:32] is only one thing that can outdo the
[52:34] enemy and that's the Holy Ghost there
[52:37] might be things that we cannot
[52:39] understand or see and they're saying
[52:41] sometimes that you can have a little bit
[52:43] of a question of things that you can
[52:45] look at and think well what's the
[52:47] direction on this or what's this but you
[52:49] know within it all it is the Holy Spirit
[52:52] that we are resting and we are resting
[52:54] in the Word of God if we're not resting
[52:57] in him then we become skittish I don't
[53:01] want to be deceived I don't want to be
[53:03] and we're not to live in fear God has
[53:05] never made us to live in fear that is
[53:07] contrary to the rest of Almighty God and
[53:12] we are to rest in him glory be to God
[53:17] amen now notice brother Branham would go
[53:20] on and say we want to enlighten you to
[53:23] know to make you a better soldier in the
[53:27] field that you're fighting in now to
[53:31] learn the tactics of the enemy so that
[53:33] you can block everything before it gets
[53:36] to you that's the main thing is to learn
[53:40] to keep the punches off of you as much
[53:44] as you can now David would write of this
[53:51] in Psalms 11 verse 1 and remember much
[53:54] of where you find in the Book of Psalms
[53:56] remember David is a man when we read in
[54:00] many of the Psalms is a man that is
[54:02] regarded as a fugitive within Israel
[54:05] he's already been anointed
[54:08] king of israel he's already come under a
[54:11] prophet's word saul was still there
[54:14] before the people and remember the evil
[54:16] spirit that comes upon saul is a spirit
[54:20] that wants to try to kill David is that
[54:24] right he tried to do everything he could
[54:26] kill David's influence and on and on
[54:28] he tried to do all of those tactics but
[54:31] you see what God had done it was not a
[54:34] man it was God's doing and you find that
[54:37] through the Book of Psalms you find
[54:39] David in a midst of a time where he is
[54:42] looking to the Lord in the defense of
[54:45] his life some of it a majority of it is
[54:48] where that he is in Saul is pursuing him
[54:51] there are times when Absalon when that
[54:54] uprising comes but within it all within
[54:57] the Book of Psalms I'm sure you find
[54:58] this as a Bible reader you can find how
[55:01] that David he approaches the battle and
[55:04] how things would come at him and how
[55:07] they have is the same way that the enemy
[55:09] will approach you and I notice what
[55:12] David would say here in verse one in the
[55:15] Lord in the Lord put I my trust how say
[55:21] ye to my soul flee as a bird to your
[55:25] Mountain for lo the wicked bend their
[55:28] bow and they make ready their arrow upon
[55:30] the string that they made prively shoot
[55:34] at the upright and heart that word
[55:35] privately means calamity did the Satan's
[55:39] desire is to shoot calamities that word
[55:43] probably means plume to shoot crew to
[55:46] shoot darkness once the sea at once the
[55:51] soul has been sealed that cannot touch
[55:54] our soul our Saul has never had a gloomy
[56:00] day in its life I'm talking about since
[56:02] we've been sealed by the Spirit of God
[56:04] that seal cannot once the seal is there
[56:08] it cannot be broken but Satan will try
[56:11] to fire and he'll try to shoot and all
[56:14] of those other parts in our life of
[56:16] flesh and all spirit
[56:18] and notice or David says look what
[56:21] David's response is if the Foundation's
[56:24] be destroyed what can the righteous do
[56:28] what's David talking about David's
[56:30] David's answer to the question that you
[56:33] are telling me flee to the mountains as
[56:35] a bird but David is letting them know
[56:37] I'm trusting in the Lord now David is
[56:41] not ignorant there are times that you
[56:43] and I have to run but remember we are
[56:45] not running in fear are you with me
[56:48] there are times where where there is a
[56:51] need to run and to move back and to run
[56:55] you know into the presence of the Lord
[56:57] there's times in situations where you
[57:00] need to get yourself out of that
[57:01] situation that's part of the shield of
[57:04] faith some three powerful words in the
[57:08] book of Genesis 39 when when Pharaoh's
[57:11] when Potiphar's wife was pressing upon
[57:14] Joseph she pressed upon him every day
[57:17] you know Joseph he didn't have a choice
[57:19] he had to work that shift in that
[57:22] factory right then are you with me now
[57:25] he had to work on that floor but notice
[57:28] it was a spirit that was upon her that
[57:31] was pressing upon him but there's three
[57:33] powerful words that when she said to
[57:36] reach and put her hand upon him the
[57:39] Bible says he got him out who got him
[57:43] out Joseph got his self out he took off
[57:46] and ran from the situation he was not
[57:50] running as a coward he was running
[57:53] according to the ledge
[57:54] I cannot stay in this situation that's a
[57:57] shield of faith
[58:02] Oh mah could only be to God
[58:07] think of it Joseph did not have to
[58:10] Joseph ones tender say well I'm gonna
[58:12] stand here and prove that how overcome
[58:14] he was proving overcoming come on
[58:17] somebody
[58:18] it was overcoming he got him out and
[58:22] noticed this David knew where he was
[58:23] standing and we we were we were coming
[58:26] into this on Sunday and dealing with how
[58:28] that those fiery darts for the Rams
[58:30] sometimes when it comes to sickness he
[58:32] were to recall them poisonous darts and
[58:35] he talks about how he says there are
[58:37] some young men here in a service he said
[58:39] there's two young men and and he said
[58:41] they're got a lot of service left in
[58:43] them for you Lord I'm there two soldiers
[58:46] Christians who believe you and the enemy
[58:49] has shot a dart and that poison dart has
[58:53] struck somewhere into their body and
[58:55] they've come back retreated back to the
[58:59] hospital of God's grace for
[59:02] reconciliation for healing that they
[59:04] might approach the front again with the
[59:08] shield up going to the battle they'd
[59:11] come to join the forces of prayer with
[59:13] us Lord and we go to meet the enemy can
[59:16] you give me that third slide there Brian
[59:17] of that whole thing where you look at
[59:19] this look at this at this very part
[59:21] right here this was something they would
[59:23] do they would take all of those shields
[59:25] and when here they were getting ready to
[59:27] approach a battle or a city they would
[59:30] actually every one of them would take
[59:32] their shield and they would march in
[59:35] position and they would put their shield
[59:37] together so that there was no arrow that
[59:41] could be able to touch that whole group
[59:43] brother there's times of standing like
[59:45] this we stand together in unity and we
[59:48] are putting our shield of faith together
[59:51] are you with me putting our shield of
[59:54] faith together to stand there and to
[59:57] approach and say we're not giving up any
[1:00:00] ground this ground belongs to us are you
[1:00:03] with me tonight it doesn't matter what
[1:00:05] sickness comes our way we stand there
[1:00:08] upon God's giving ground that has been
[1:00:10] made real to us and the law
[1:00:12] that healeth all bad diseases hallelujah
[1:00:17] we stand upon that word like we've been
[1:00:20] preaching on healing we stand upon that
[1:00:22] word when it comes to deliverance for
[1:00:24] our homes he stand upon that word when
[1:00:27] it comes to the baptism of the Holy
[1:00:29] Ghost we don't pull apart we put our
[1:00:31] shields together and we march all to
[1:00:34] take every promise that God has given to
[1:00:37] us and this is exactly what brother
[1:00:43] Branham is talking about in this meeting
[1:00:45] there are two young men that he says
[1:00:48] they have been struck with poisonous
[1:00:50] darts remember brother man tells us he
[1:00:52] said the Satan's arrows they went over
[1:00:54] the shield and they connected hmm that
[1:01:04] they might approach the front again you
[1:01:07] know you don't get wounded by sitting in
[1:01:08] the mess hall you know I'm talking about
[1:01:11] brother Carlos you don't get wounded by
[1:01:13] sitting around telling battle stories of
[1:01:15] somebody else's battle come on somebody
[1:01:18] you don't get you don't get you don't
[1:01:20] get wounded because you're just around
[1:01:22] where it's going on or around all the
[1:01:24] tents and I went and visited this
[1:01:26] soldier and yet you know I've seen a
[1:01:28] vengeance soldier so-and-so an apostille
[1:01:30] soldier so-and-so and he told me about
[1:01:32] do you want their testimony or do you
[1:01:34] want your own come on now you they can't
[1:01:37] fight I can't fight your battles you
[1:01:39] can't find my battles but the only way
[1:01:41] you get wounded is when you're on the
[1:01:43] frontline and fighting and there'll be
[1:01:46] times when we get wounded but thanks be
[1:01:49] to God there is a hospital of God's
[1:01:52] grace and as the Prophet said an
[1:01:55] ambulance God's ambulance of angels that
[1:01:57] are able to pack us to healing oh I'm
[1:02:01] glad for that tonight
[1:02:04] Amen warriors in the battle now notice
[1:02:08] we were looking at this on here how the
[1:02:11] scripture would talk about the shield of
[1:02:13] faith being able to quench all the fiery
[1:02:16] darts of the enemy of the wicked one and
[1:02:20] that word quench it deals with putting
[1:02:23] out or extinguishing a fire
[1:02:26] and I gave you some of these points on
[1:02:28] Sunday here toward the latter part of
[1:02:30] the message but but you've seen there
[1:02:33] with the shields that brother Brian had
[1:02:35] posted up there for us that particular
[1:02:37] shield is the one that Paul would see by
[1:02:40] that by that of one of the Roman
[1:02:42] soldiers and Paul would under
[1:02:45] inspiration he would would take that and
[1:02:48] begin to look at that shield of faith it
[1:02:50] was a shield that was four foot long two
[1:02:52] foot wide it weighed about 22 pounds and
[1:02:55] remembered when they would carry this
[1:02:57] shield it was one that would actually
[1:03:00] block in the front it was made of wood
[1:03:02] that was pressed together and then it
[1:03:04] had a leather part upon the front of it
[1:03:07] but the edges of it were of brass and
[1:03:09] metal so if a sword came it was able to
[1:03:12] deflect that sword when it would come on
[1:03:14] the edge but the wood but the warriors
[1:03:17] when they were the soldiers would take
[1:03:19] these shields and they would take them
[1:03:21] and they would put them in water and
[1:03:24] soak them overnight and the shields
[1:03:27] themselves would soak up the water so
[1:03:31] when it came time now for the battle to
[1:03:33] take place the next day when all the
[1:03:36] fiery darts whatever were launched at
[1:03:38] them they had within that shield the
[1:03:41] substance that was needed to be able to
[1:03:45] quench the fiery darts and I'm telling
[1:03:49] you right now this is why we need our
[1:03:50] refilling of the Holy Ghost we need
[1:03:53] refilling after revealing after
[1:03:56] refilling give us this day our daily
[1:03:58] bread that's why this is what Jude would
[1:04:02] write up in the book of Jude he would
[1:04:04] say building up your most holy faith
[1:04:07] praying in the Holy Ghost
[1:04:09] it's admonition on our life listen you
[1:04:12] can know all the word but prayer is very
[1:04:14] very important it's a way so let's let's
[1:04:22] look at this just for a moment on these
[1:04:24] these darts that would come in here and
[1:04:27] you find that this of the D tactics that
[1:04:30] would advance and how that we looked at
[1:04:33] that the other night Yahtzee I've got my
[1:04:34] arrow here when we would look at that
[1:04:38] and you realize that every one of these
[1:04:40] the arrows themselves of fiery darts
[1:04:43] they would take the shaft and they were
[1:04:45] actually made out of cane and in that
[1:04:48] that shaft of cane II would be hollow
[1:04:50] they would put combustible flammable
[1:04:54] liquid in there alcohol or different
[1:04:57] things that they would put in there on
[1:04:59] the end of it they would wrap the tip of
[1:05:01] it in in tow and pitch and light it on
[1:05:05] fire when the arrow would go forth
[1:05:08] flying through the air one of the things
[1:05:10] just looking at the arrow if a win-win
[1:05:13] he would come flying because at the
[1:05:15] beginning of a battle you would have
[1:05:18] arrows flying from every side that was
[1:05:20] all part of the tactic because when
[1:05:23] arrows are coming from all sides think
[1:05:25] of this when you have flaming it looks
[1:05:28] like comments almost better going forth
[1:05:30] the way that the riders describe it the
[1:05:32] way that these things would look it and
[1:05:34] a person's looking all around the whole
[1:05:36] part within it was to induce panic
[1:05:39] confusion fear that all those thoughts
[1:05:43] would arise why because the because then
[1:05:46] the soldier he gets his focus on the
[1:05:49] fiery dart instead of looking at he's
[1:05:52] been prepared to take care of their
[1:05:55] fiery darts hey man so to think when
[1:05:59] that when that would go forth as soon as
[1:06:01] it would hit on the shield or the
[1:06:03] soldier this would disengage and all of
[1:06:06] that flammable liquid would just go out
[1:06:08] and where the flammable liquid goes you
[1:06:11] know how gasoline is wherever the liquid
[1:06:13] goes the fire will follow so sometimes
[1:06:17] it would fall upon the flesh other times
[1:06:19] it would fall and get down to the spirit
[1:06:21] are you with me now you see the reality
[1:06:25] is that when you and I when God has done
[1:06:28] a work even within our lives let me said
[1:06:31] like this even when God is doing a work
[1:06:34] in a life this is why brother bana would
[1:06:36] pray of just reading in the message
[1:06:39] presuming he would ask for those who
[1:06:41] just gave their hearts to God he said
[1:06:43] God let a great determination of grace
[1:06:47] come upon their lives
[1:06:49] to where that they will go on to be
[1:06:51] sanctified by the Word of God give them
[1:06:54] a great determination to go on let me
[1:06:56] just tell you something right now even
[1:06:58] when God is dealing with your life and
[1:07:00] you might be if I say like this on the
[1:07:02] first rung of the ladder
[1:07:04] you're not defenseless God has given you
[1:07:09] his word you can stand on that word and
[1:07:12] every promise it belongs to you you have
[1:07:17] to fight for it but it belongs to you
[1:07:22] glory be to God
[1:07:24] this shield that would be given remember
[1:07:28] brother Mannis said like this he said as
[1:07:30] soon as you say you got the Holy Ghost
[1:07:32] he said the devil's got every gun
[1:07:35] trained on you your your face went on a
[1:07:44] wanted poster in hell but don't get
[1:07:49] scared because you got greater is He
[1:07:52] that's in you than he that's in the
[1:07:55] world come on somebody the enemies
[1:07:59] against you listen the reality brother
[1:08:01] Brad would put it so simple he said you
[1:08:03] were just slouching and slapping along
[1:08:05] before he said but now you got dressed
[1:08:08] up got cleaned up
[1:08:09] you got a uniform on he said the devil's
[1:08:11] got every gun trained on you every
[1:08:13] temptation that can be thrown at you
[1:08:15] he's coming with that all but you have
[1:08:18] greater is He that is in you than he
[1:08:21] that's in the world that's why I could
[1:08:24] say take the shield and when the dots
[1:08:27] come back them off and move on simple
[1:08:31] words but powerful back them off and
[1:08:34] move on then fall you keep going
[1:08:38] [Music]
[1:08:43] hallelujah the devil tells you you're
[1:08:45] strange calls fiery darts cuts fella
[1:08:47] shot at you he's a liar don't you pay no
[1:08:49] attention to quench em and move on
[1:08:52] there's Brown to be taken I remember
[1:09:00] when God just got a hold my life
[1:09:02] probably loved you heard brother Donnie
[1:09:03] say this and I remember you know sitting
[1:09:05] on the platform at times I'm just just a
[1:09:07] young boy you know almost you know 25 or
[1:09:10] whatever years ago and he would say he
[1:09:12] said the devil he says the one that'll
[1:09:13] talk you in to rob at the bank and then
[1:09:15] turn around and have you called 911 he
[1:09:19] said he's the one that a fire of thought
[1:09:20] in your mind and turn around and say how
[1:09:22] could you think there's such a thing
[1:09:25] come on now we're talking about an enemy
[1:09:28] you know why oh my I wish I'm then I
[1:09:30] gotta stay on the shield of faith his
[1:09:32] whole thing he wants to try to bring
[1:09:34] condemnation because he knows the power
[1:09:37] of that word when a believer will take
[1:09:40] that word and speak that word I'm
[1:09:43] telling you brother you may not see the
[1:09:45] mountain tall but a crumble a grain of
[1:09:48] sand does everything he can to try to
[1:09:55] silence that voice greater is He that's
[1:10:03] in you with the baptism of the Holy
[1:10:06] Ghost in your soul your soul is no
[1:10:09] longer flammable it's got fire burning
[1:10:14] in there already it's like the burning
[1:10:17] bush it's a fire burning within yet the
[1:10:19] bush is not consumed
[1:10:22] there all right but there's still two
[1:10:25] other parts of you and me that's
[1:10:26] flammable this is why we've got this
[1:10:35] choice we've got a choice victory is not
[1:10:38] automatic that's true you shall be able
[1:10:40] to quench all the fiery darts of the
[1:10:43] enemy but it is not automatic it's
[1:10:46] warfare here we require and it requires
[1:10:50] us to live from the realm of our soul
[1:10:54] to live from that victory of Calvary
[1:10:57] that's been brought into our soul and
[1:10:59] we've been brought in
[1:11:00] that's why requires every day that's why
[1:11:03] the devil fights every day he wants to
[1:11:05] fight you in your daily walk
[1:11:09] he fights you in your prayer time
[1:11:13] because this is our strength I don't
[1:11:19] care how much mysteries a person knows
[1:11:21] if your prayer life is not up to par
[1:11:23] you're a target and just put it as plain
[1:11:27] as simple as can be you've got to stay
[1:11:29] in fellowship brother Branham would even
[1:11:32] tell us like this he said the key to the
[1:11:34] mysteries is prayer oh my so we want to
[1:11:41] stay in that strength notice let's look
[1:11:43] at a few scriptures here and first
[1:11:44] Corinthians 10:13 there hath no
[1:11:46] temptation taken you but such as is
[1:11:49] common to man but God is faithful who
[1:11:54] will not suffer you to be tempted above
[1:11:56] that you are able but will with the
[1:11:59] temptation also make a way of escape
[1:12:03] that you may be able to bear it you see
[1:12:07] the question is do you want a way of
[1:12:09] escape there is a way of escape God is
[1:12:14] faithful he will with the temptation
[1:12:16] make a way of us of escape our strength
[1:12:19] is turning the battle to the gate to the
[1:12:24] Word of God this is why Paul would write
[1:12:27] to you and I in Romans 6 verse 12 let
[1:12:31] not sin therefore reign in your mortal
[1:12:35] body that you should obey it in the
[1:12:38] lusts thereof don't let it linger
[1:12:41] like we read here in the scripture bring
[1:12:43] it in subjection this is where the
[1:12:47] strength the strength our strength as a
[1:12:51] believer our strength it comes from the
[1:12:54] Lord when when our lives are not where
[1:12:59] it needs to be we don't have the
[1:13:01] strength we ought to have
[1:13:04] come on now we talked about white dog
[1:13:06] and black dog we readers and there's a
[1:13:08] need which one wins which one when he
[1:13:11] feeds the most come on now
[1:13:14] you see it's all it's recognizing you
[1:13:17] know brother Adam would even deal with
[1:13:19] with with these things in himself where
[1:13:21] he would recognize fiery darts that had
[1:13:24] been able to connect even in his spirit
[1:13:27] to where he himself would identify in
[1:13:29] earlier parts of the message and
[1:13:31] throughout of how he said I've become
[1:13:33] negative I've become critical I've got
[1:13:36] negative thoughts in my heart but you
[1:13:38] know what he would say at that moment
[1:13:40] I'm determined to blast my heart out he
[1:13:44] recognized he became critical but what
[1:13:47] was that it was not bad of what we know
[1:13:50] the inner man becoming critical but
[1:13:53] noticing the things that were being said
[1:13:55] things that were being done then it
[1:13:57] become critical you know listen friends
[1:14:00] these are things that when brother
[1:14:01] Branham was talking about it it needs it
[1:14:03] for anybody to be critical of are you
[1:14:07] with me when a person becomes critical
[1:14:10] it's a sure sign fiery darts have
[1:14:13] connected and that flammable liquid is
[1:14:17] going all over the place come on now
[1:14:20] when your fellowship is criticism it
[1:14:23] ain't fellowship it ain't invitin angels
[1:14:27] it's inviting Devils we are not to be
[1:14:31] critical people are you with me
[1:14:38] hallelujah that was free think about I
[1:14:44] want you to think of this the enemy
[1:14:46] would fight the Prophet in this area of
[1:14:48] his life an area of his life that would
[1:14:52] require such humility and yet that very
[1:14:55] area is the area that Satan would target
[1:14:59] and fire siren dark after firing up why
[1:15:02] because he was a cold
[1:15:04] he was purposed by God to be the prophet
[1:15:07] of this age they covered he experienced
[1:15:10] these things but he had to overcome them
[1:15:13] in order to
[1:15:14] be a vessel that could bring the word of
[1:15:17] the Lord to you and I it just didn't
[1:15:19] happen he had to battle and to fight
[1:15:23] what a testimony in his to us that not
[1:15:27] therefore sin reign in your mortal body
[1:15:34] sometimes we get to looking at the
[1:15:36] thoughts and we were thinking way out
[1:15:38] here was sin but remember it's dealing
[1:15:40] with even in things that come in things
[1:15:43] we hear thoughts and other things words
[1:15:45] that are being spoken are you with me
[1:15:54] new dawn would slant like this and by
[1:15:56] faith Moses he said no Lord we would ask
[1:15:59] you that you would forgive us of any
[1:16:01] mistake any sin of trespass or omission
[1:16:07] omission is omitting going over what
[1:16:12] should be done and neglecting it
[1:16:15] transgression that if any evil thought
[1:16:18] has pierced our soul by the fiery darts
[1:16:21] of the devil that you would drive away
[1:16:23] this evil of thine and of that people we
[1:16:25] would ask you Lord that you would send
[1:16:27] the Holy Spirit to take hold of the word
[1:16:29] at this time as we yield ourselves as
[1:16:31] instruments that you would speak through
[1:16:34] us and hear through us thy word and may
[1:16:37] we in return receive it as from thee and
[1:16:40] leave this place today feeling that we
[1:16:44] have been readjusted to the cause of
[1:16:48] Christ that we might be better fit for
[1:16:51] the service of tonight tomorrow because
[1:16:53] of your visitation and they say lord
[1:16:57] help me to be readjusted when I need to
[1:17:00] be readjusted help me Lord let me be
[1:17:02] readjusted hey listen some of y'all let
[1:17:04] you go and let people crack your backs
[1:17:05] and everything else what do you do I'm
[1:17:07] all out of whack I need to get
[1:17:08] readjusted I need to get lined up
[1:17:10] there's times we need a good spiritual
[1:17:12] Cryer contractor we need to have some
[1:17:14] things cracked back into place that have
[1:17:16] gotten out of place
[1:17:17] maybe our feelings or our thoughts or
[1:17:19] our attitudes have got a little bit out
[1:17:22] of place and it's not exactly wearing
[1:17:25] needs to be but God knows exactly how to
[1:17:27] tell us them say earlier down here and
[1:17:29] move your arm up here put your leg over
[1:17:31] your head this way and let's do it this
[1:17:33] way and let's and all of a sudden pop
[1:17:35] then you say oh I never did get to feel
[1:17:38] that but I just take people's words they
[1:17:41] always tried to crack me and said I
[1:17:42] can't do it
[1:17:44] notice Galatians 5:16 this I save him
[1:17:48] now watch this this I say then walk in
[1:17:52] the spirit and you shall not fulfill the
[1:17:57] lust of the flesh
[1:17:59] this word walk means to live or to
[1:18:02] regulate one's life notice Galatians
[1:18:05] 5:17 for the flesh lusteth against the
[1:18:09] spirit it's not the human spirit this is
[1:18:12] the Holy Spirit the flesh lusteth
[1:18:15] against the spirit and the spirit
[1:18:17] against the flesh and these are contrary
[1:18:19] the one to the other so that you cannot
[1:18:22] do the things that you would it's moved
[1:18:26] to a place to where when the Holy Ghost
[1:18:28] has come there is a battle a warfare
[1:18:31] that sets forth on the inside where now
[1:18:34] there is a desire you have a power you
[1:18:37] have authority on the inside and you
[1:18:39] recognize that opposing force you know
[1:18:42] the enemy can come to you when you're on
[1:18:44] your way to receiving the Holy Ghost and
[1:18:46] he can come to you and you can stand
[1:18:48] there and say well you know I don't have
[1:18:50] the strength I know I'm still feeling in
[1:18:51] this here in my life but you do not have
[1:18:53] to become a puppet for the devil you can
[1:18:56] take God's Word and say I'm going to
[1:18:58] stand on God's Word on this promise Lord
[1:19:01] if there's something out of line
[1:19:03] in my life that's hindering me from
[1:19:04] receiving your word because they're
[1:19:07] sharing no problem with you if there's
[1:19:09] any problem it's right here Lord so I
[1:19:12] need your Lord to bring an adjustment
[1:19:14] Lord in my life to where the world
[1:19:16] itself can actually be able to come to
[1:19:20] pass in my life so there's an actual
[1:19:23] opposition that is between in that love
[1:19:26] in a believer but the band would call it
[1:19:29] a constant war that takes place but
[1:19:31] remember greater is he that is in you
[1:19:34] than he that's in the world 1st John
[1:19:37] chapter 2 verse
[1:19:38] steam for all that is in the world is
[1:19:41] the lust of the flesh the lust of the
[1:19:44] eyes and the pride of life it is not of
[1:19:47] the Father but it is of the world these
[1:19:51] are the three gates of temptation that
[1:19:54] every temptation that comes to you and I
[1:19:57] comes right through one of these three
[1:19:58] gates the brother brand would take this
[1:20:02] up in the healing of Jairus daughter and
[1:20:05] the brother brand would talk about in
[1:20:08] this quote to me it's just a beautiful
[1:20:09] how that it's how that it's laid out so
[1:20:12] clearly on the battle that you and I
[1:20:14] would be in he said now notice he said
[1:20:17] Satan he does not tempt down in here
[1:20:20] talking about the soul he tempts out
[1:20:22] here in the flesh he said you know for
[1:20:25] example you're going down the street
[1:20:26] tomorrow and you're walking along
[1:20:28] singing Christian songs and somebody
[1:20:30] says you know he or she is just a
[1:20:32] hypocrite talking about you there's
[1:20:35] nothing now the first thing he says your
[1:20:40] flesh picks that up in the year and it
[1:20:46] suggests to the mind
[1:20:50] let's see what it suggests get even with
[1:20:52] them
[1:20:54] listen I'm a sealed believer yes a
[1:20:58] sealed believer but remember the enemy
[1:21:01] these parts out here are still flammable
[1:21:04] when you got the Holy Ghost you never
[1:21:08] got a glorified body we never got our
[1:21:11] feet off any are you with me but we did
[1:21:13] receive the victory that leads us to
[1:21:16] that are you with me Oh glory be to God
[1:21:19] think of this get even with him time it
[1:21:22] gets back here he says it says back here
[1:21:25] vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord I will
[1:21:28] repay so Satan tempts out here he
[1:21:32] doesn't get down here because this is
[1:21:34] immortal
[1:21:35] it's the flesh that he tends he said now
[1:21:38] for example a young man going down the
[1:21:40] street a young Christian boy a young
[1:21:42] lady coming and morally dressed the eye
[1:21:44] picks it up and the flesh suggests to
[1:21:48] the mind evil then it gets to the mind
[1:21:51] it goes to the soul the nature is good
[1:21:53] he said then he said when the soul he
[1:21:56] said the spirit there will say whosoever
[1:21:58] looketh upon a woman to lust after her
[1:22:01] has committed adultery in his horn
[1:22:03] already the young man turns his head and
[1:22:06] walks away that's down here is where
[1:22:09] it's got to be down in the heart are you
[1:22:14] with me that's where it's got to be down
[1:22:18] there within the heart man you know one
[1:22:20] of the biggest things that is so highly
[1:22:21] combustible about our life is
[1:22:24] self-confidence that is I mean that
[1:22:28] right there
[1:22:28] is really highly flammable it has those
[1:22:31] little signs on it
[1:22:32] highly flammable I can do this I can no
[1:22:39] it's I can do all things through Christ
[1:22:41] who strengtheneth me are you with me I
[1:22:46] can do all things through Christ who
[1:22:48] strengthens me so to think how that
[1:22:51] self-confidence itself would be such a
[1:22:53] combustible part notice in the life of
[1:22:56] the Lord Jesus when you look in the life
[1:22:58] of the Lord Jesus think of this here he
[1:23:00] is upon this earth we've looked at this
[1:23:02] in many different times and you've heard
[1:23:04] it many different times and you look at
[1:23:05] it through the prophets message but here
[1:23:07] comes the Lord Jesus
[1:23:08] here he comes up out of the River Jordan
[1:23:11] he's received the Holy Ghost the word
[1:23:14] has been quickened to him he's received
[1:23:17] a revelation of God for his day and he
[1:23:20] goes forth and the Bible says the spirit
[1:23:22] led him into the wilderness to be
[1:23:25] tempted of the devil you see when God
[1:23:28] doesn't work he ain't afraid God said I
[1:23:32] ain't afraid of this work I can lift
[1:23:34] this work go
[1:23:35] it can actually be tested and proven
[1:23:38] that this is the real deal that's what
[1:23:42] God allows our faith to be tested
[1:23:44] sometimes our faith is so tested to a
[1:23:47] place where you look and say I feel like
[1:23:50] I'm at a breaking point but remember
[1:23:52] it's not altogether your strength
[1:23:55] it is his strength that strengthens our
[1:23:57] faith and when we come through the test
[1:24:00] or the trial we come forth better he was
[1:24:09] tempted you agree with it Jesus was not
[1:24:14] going through an act he was tempted so
[1:24:19] here he is walking in a body of flesh
[1:24:23] having a spirit and down on the inside
[1:24:27] his soul
[1:24:29] and he moves up into this temptation and
[1:24:32] remember the enemy is going to try him
[1:24:34] as he's tried everyone who has lived
[1:24:38] before he's going to come with the same
[1:24:40] tactics the same techniques that he came
[1:24:43] against II which we just read the lust
[1:24:46] of the eyes the lust of the flesh and
[1:24:48] the pride of life the first tactic that
[1:24:50] he comes to if Jesus is in such a
[1:24:52] weakened state
[1:24:54] he's hungered he has not had any food
[1:24:57] for 40 days and think of it here he is
[1:25:00] in a time where brother man will put it
[1:25:02] like this on the hebrew series he said
[1:25:04] when a man gets hungry he'll do about
[1:25:06] anything so notice Jesus came to such a
[1:25:09] place
[1:25:09] I like how brother Graham said it he
[1:25:11] said Jesus brought the kingdom of God
[1:25:13] solo to where it can be you and I can
[1:25:16] look and see of just how that the
[1:25:19] weakness Christian can take the Word of
[1:25:22] God and stand on the word and defeat the
[1:25:26] enemy Jesus was in a weakened state here
[1:25:32] came Satan Satan was refreshed and ready
[1:25:40] he was refer Satan was refreshed and
[1:25:42] ready I mean you know maybe Satan you
[1:25:45] know it just just got up here the 40th
[1:25:46] day I'll wait to that time he's ready to
[1:25:48] go he's refreshed and ready here was
[1:25:51] Jesus in a weakened state it just goes
[1:25:54] to show that a weak Christian can whip a
[1:25:56] refreshed devil
[1:25:58] [Applause]
[1:26:00] Jesus brought the kingdom of God solo to
[1:26:03] where you don't have to feel strong you
[1:26:05] don't have to be a strong Christian but
[1:26:08] the weakest Christian can take that work
[1:26:10] and stand on that word with the shield
[1:26:12] of hate you know back the devil up he
[1:26:17] came to pit him there in his habitat in
[1:26:20] his hunger in his weakness but then even
[1:26:22] after that Satan wants to tempt him in
[1:26:25] the pride of life right lust of the eyes
[1:26:31] so here he overcome and I'm not moving
[1:26:35] kind of quickly but he overcome every
[1:26:38] one of those temptations that came at
[1:26:43] him he was tempted you know the Bible
[1:26:45] says in the book of Hebrews chapter 2
[1:26:47] and then going over to Hebrews 4 that he
[1:26:50] was tempted in all points such as we are
[1:26:53] that word in him that he suffered he
[1:26:56] underwent a sensible experience to think
[1:26:58] how God so subjected himself and came
[1:27:02] down this was not just like a guy who's
[1:27:04] one nerd won your vote and he puts on a
[1:27:06] hardhat and walks through a factory no
[1:27:08] sir that is not the same way this is
[1:27:11] where God Himself did not just come down
[1:27:14] and put on a hardhat he came down and
[1:27:16] subjected himself to absolutely
[1:27:19] understand what it's all about when the
[1:27:22] fiery darts would come in upon the flesh
[1:27:25] and the pool would come or when it would
[1:27:27] explode and how did the shield of faith
[1:27:30] would be able to quench every Dart of
[1:27:32] the enemy he would be able to experience
[1:27:35] the Bible says he'll undergo a sensible
[1:27:38] experience he would know how it felt
[1:27:40] when it's pulled by wrong
[1:27:43] are you with me this was our Lord Jesus
[1:27:47] and he overcame by what the word not by
[1:27:51] any of his divine powers
[1:27:52] he never overcame by any of his
[1:27:55] supernatural powers he overcame
[1:27:59] by the word this is where David would
[1:28:03] talk about he has given me the shield of
[1:28:06] his salvation he has given me his truth
[1:28:10] as my shield and buckler these are
[1:28:13] things that David would speak and exhort
[1:28:16] to us on now when we look at this let me
[1:28:19] just try to narrow this down here just
[1:28:21] just a few moments many times where
[1:28:24] we're looking at we're looking at the
[1:28:26] battle as though that it's out here
[1:28:29] Satan can come as we were reading with
[1:28:31] all the suggestions and everything that
[1:28:33] he can try to come at us but remember
[1:28:35] what what he's trying to hit is
[1:28:37] combustible material so as to understand
[1:28:41] the battle is right here this is the
[1:28:45] battle right here it's not how fair if
[1:28:48] the battle is right here it's - its to
[1:28:51] walk in the spirit and you shall not
[1:28:54] fulfill the lust of the flesh to quench
[1:28:57] the fiery darts of the enemy now notice
[1:29:00] this I want you think of this we just
[1:29:03] refer to this of the Lord Jesus he was
[1:29:05] tempted on through the scripture if the
[1:29:10] body if the flesh was God then you got
[1:29:12] God being tempted and God can be tempted
[1:29:17] are you with me
[1:29:18] but God was in Christ come on now is
[1:29:22] that right and Jesus even as brother
[1:29:25] branham would tell us he says Jesus
[1:29:27] Jesus himself was tempted by women
[1:29:29] tempted with drinking tempted with all
[1:29:32] those things they were fired at him and
[1:29:34] he experienced all those temptations
[1:29:36] every test every trial listen he
[1:29:39] experienced words being said about him
[1:29:41] his whole life
[1:29:43] think about it everywhere he would win
[1:29:45] there was a black mark upon his life
[1:29:47] where people had said well you know his
[1:29:49] mother you know she wasn't pregnant you
[1:29:51] know by a drunken soldier all of these
[1:29:53] things were out there now notice Jesus
[1:29:56] could have become focused on trying to
[1:29:59] put all of that out he couldn't put it
[1:30:01] out out there but he can put it out
[1:30:03] right here
[1:30:04] are you with me too many times we're
[1:30:07] trying to put it out in somebody else's
[1:30:09] mouth it ain't their mouth it's right
[1:30:11] here hmm this is why David would say let
[1:30:20] me just skip down to a place in Psalms
[1:30:22] 57 4 here is David when he escaping from
[1:30:26] Saul he said in my soul is among lions
[1:30:29] and I lie even among them that are set
[1:30:32] on fire even the sons of men whose teeth
[1:30:35] are Spears and arrows and their tongue a
[1:30:39] sharp sword what's his response to it be
[1:30:42] valid salted Oh God I'm not dragging
[1:30:47] down his holiness be Val exalted what he
[1:30:51] is that that's rather well above the
[1:30:55] heavens let that glory be above all the
[1:30:58] earth how many times brother branham
[1:31:00] would tell us simple advice but he would
[1:31:02] tell us he said if you're going to fight
[1:31:04] the battle
[1:31:04] God can't find it sometimes you're
[1:31:09] tempted to try to fight the battle prove
[1:31:11] your points and everything else help me
[1:31:13] preach now but that's only a trap of the
[1:31:17] enemy what that is it's this it's
[1:31:19] combustible I've got to say this I've
[1:31:23] gotta lay this and I've got to do this
[1:31:24] and I've got to do that fiery darts man
[1:31:28] that flesh and that spirit is all
[1:31:30] inflamed didn't they realized why would
[1:31:32] they say that why would they do this one
[1:31:35] is that that is arrows that have been
[1:31:37] fired
[1:31:38] Psalm 64 three who wet their tongue like
[1:31:41] a sword and bend their bows to shoot
[1:31:45] their arrows even bitter words don't ask
[1:31:52] you to raise your hand but nobody likes
[1:31:55] to receive bitter words you know we
[1:31:58] don't like to be misunderstood oh
[1:31:59] brother Samuel then don't bother me
[1:32:01] you're lying
[1:32:04] you can try to pretend like you don't
[1:32:06] bother you but it bothers you but you
[1:32:09] see listen the bothersome part is
[1:32:11] because steel right here in our life
[1:32:14] there is those parts that are
[1:32:15] combustible
[1:32:16] remember that does not mean we're
[1:32:19] defeated
[1:32:20] we are not defeated we are not walking
[1:32:24] around and say well I wonder where the
[1:32:26] devil's next punch is coming from we're
[1:32:28] not looking for his next punch
[1:32:30] we've got promises to take we've got a
[1:32:33] rapture to take I'm not worried about
[1:32:37] his punches I know that God will prepare
[1:32:40] every footstep and everything that I
[1:32:43] have need of it's just don't let me get
[1:32:47] in the way this was why brother Branham
[1:32:57] would say and we would you know no
[1:32:59] wonder it be like the congregation
[1:33:00] reason they would laugh when brother
[1:33:01] Brent would say it and you say they
[1:33:05] would laugh it was kind of like while I
[1:33:06] try myself on Sunday being a real young
[1:33:08] Christian Lord of Mercy I've never
[1:33:10] experienced a battle like that and you
[1:33:12] know the enemy come in at you like that
[1:33:13] but you know you wait a little bit and
[1:33:15] then the enemy he wants to try to make
[1:33:17] his approach that'll scare us that this
[1:33:20] cares God prepares you for it
[1:33:22] but brother Graham would stand right in
[1:33:25] the message perfect faith talk about
[1:33:26] words think about brother Brian what
[1:33:28] he's come through he's come through
[1:33:29] things where people say brother brems
[1:33:31] coming to town put your hair up pin it
[1:33:33] up we don't want to talk about here you
[1:33:35] know I'm doing this program you know
[1:33:36] he's always got this going on you know
[1:33:38] brother Brian he's a prophet of God long
[1:33:39] as the anointing is on it but don't pay
[1:33:41] no attention to his doctrine all these
[1:33:45] same things and you know what that
[1:33:47] wasn't even the heart brother Branham he
[1:33:49] had he had God's heart within this his
[1:33:51] heart was to help God's people where the
[1:33:55] enemy had lessened and the enemy had
[1:33:57] stripped down and wanted to take away
[1:33:59] from the real effect of Calvary to just
[1:34:03] a church membership but God put a
[1:34:05] revelation in the prophets heart to
[1:34:08] scream out in this generation to get our
[1:34:11] eyes off of organization and also
[1:34:14] Creed's of man and get our eyes to Jesus
[1:34:18] because it's in Jesus we can recognize I
[1:34:21] must
[1:34:22] and I need help I need deliverance there
[1:34:27] is a blood that can loosen me he had to
[1:34:34] overcome all of that sometimes you know
[1:34:37] for me maybe I'm maybe I'm odd maybe you
[1:34:39] do too
[1:34:40] I look at much of this right here where
[1:34:42] brother Branham was preaching about and
[1:34:44] you started hearing things and you
[1:34:45] realize there's certain statements
[1:34:46] brother Ram will make and you begin to
[1:34:48] pick up battles he's been in he don't
[1:34:51] even have to come out and say it but you
[1:34:53] recognize it from in your own you start
[1:34:55] recognizing certain battles he's been in
[1:34:57] that God has brought him through in that
[1:35:00] encouragement this is always
[1:35:02] encouragement for me always Paul's copy
[1:35:05] putting my notes keep on walking notice
[1:35:10] he says think of it he says in his own
[1:35:13] life when words would come he looks out
[1:35:16] and sees people that's drew drove a real
[1:35:18] long distance and they stayed over for
[1:35:20] the night service he said you know I get
[1:35:23] spells
[1:35:24] I myself get spells he said I get to a
[1:35:27] spot sometimes what gets me is when I
[1:35:32] get those spells when I get all
[1:35:34] overworked and Satan comes telling me
[1:35:39] why nobody cares for you you really
[1:35:42] haven't got a friend in the world
[1:35:46] hey you see we would look at the
[1:35:48] anything you gotta be kidding me brother
[1:35:50] brems got to hide from people he's got
[1:35:53] to hide and duck away but you see the
[1:35:56] effect being overworked these are
[1:36:00] insights he's sharing with us being
[1:36:02] overworked many times think about how
[1:36:04] many things brother bran would tell us
[1:36:05] over and over I said I'm standing at the
[1:36:07] pulpit right now having to take the
[1:36:09] opposite of what Satan is trying to tell
[1:36:12] me right now he would stand there
[1:36:14] battling with spirits service after
[1:36:16] service and then right here the enemy
[1:36:19] when he gets overworked he gets a little
[1:36:21] weak and the enemy comes to him and says
[1:36:23] nobody cares about you let me bring it
[1:36:27] down to your home he really don't
[1:36:28] appreciate what you do
[1:36:29] when's the last time he thanked you for
[1:36:30] it preach brother sin when's the last
[1:36:35] time that he complimented your meal
[1:36:37] when's the last time he told you thank
[1:36:39] you then they're getting on the husband
[1:36:41] what's the last time that she said she
[1:36:44] loves you you know she's so busy with
[1:36:47] everything else that's going on she
[1:36:49] don't even seem to have time for you and
[1:36:53] then that little bit of a jealousy wants
[1:36:54] to rise up you can sit here and look
[1:36:57] like angels but I know the truth and all
[1:37:00] of a sudden you start copping a little
[1:37:02] thing it's a little different when in
[1:37:05] turn we need the shield of faith the
[1:37:09] shield of faith to say wait a minute it
[1:37:11] is not God that would be propelling me
[1:37:14] in this way and even if there were
[1:37:17] things that were wrong that ain't going
[1:37:18] to accomplish nothing
[1:37:20] Lord Jesus well here we are Thursday
[1:37:24] night
[1:37:24] oh my he said now remember I'm not
[1:37:29] immune to the temptation I've got to
[1:37:32] overcome that now watch how he overcomes
[1:37:35] it but when I look back and I see these
[1:37:38] people that's traveled from a long
[1:37:39] distance this is what he does by the
[1:37:41] jury he says I put it right back in
[1:37:44] Satan's face and I say what about that
[1:37:50] that's what we need to do what about
[1:37:52] that nobody loves you what about that
[1:37:58] catch you got the other day well nobody
[1:38:03] loves me nobody greets me they cannot
[1:38:05] chase you down as you're running to your
[1:38:08] car hello somebody nobody seems to care
[1:38:12] about me at church you know and here you
[1:38:15] are you don't stick around to shake
[1:38:16] hands with nobody simple Scripture but
[1:38:19] powerful he that showeth himself
[1:38:22] friendly has friends so you need to put
[1:38:27] that right back in the devil's quiver
[1:38:29] he said that helps me overcome now let
[1:38:36] me come back to her point and just
[1:38:37] coming down here James says in James
[1:38:42] 1:13 let no man say when he is tempted I
[1:38:45] am tempted of God for God cannot be
[1:38:50] tempted with evil neither tempteth he
[1:38:55] any man but every man is tempted when he
[1:38:59] is drawn away of his own lust and
[1:39:03] enticed where does it remain where does
[1:39:08] it reside right here lust let me just
[1:39:13] say this to you lusts do not let lust
[1:39:15] just be a term well that is where a man
[1:39:17] is looking upon a woman or a woman
[1:39:19] looking to a man lust is a forbidden
[1:39:21] desire come on now you and I are
[1:39:26] forbidden to get angry come on now
[1:39:30] you're forbidden to hold grudges come
[1:39:33] you're forbidden to have that of corrupt
[1:39:36] communication going out of your mouth
[1:39:39] come on now all of these things apply
[1:39:42] now tuned to recognize this is where the
[1:39:46] guarding this is where the protecting
[1:39:48] and this is where it requires faith to
[1:39:50] direct the Word of God this is why in
[1:39:53] 1st John 5:4 for whatsoever is born of
[1:39:58] God overcometh the world
[1:40:01] and this is the victory that overcometh
[1:40:02] the world even our faith now I want to
[1:40:07] read this quote to you here
[1:40:11] LeBron was talking about the six sins
[1:40:14] he's talking about all of our the five
[1:40:16] senses and the sixth sense in the
[1:40:20] beginning they're a paragraph 190 he
[1:40:22] says made this super sense may the sense
[1:40:25] of faith that belongs to the believer
[1:40:27] because he have to have it in order to
[1:40:29] believe God Lord give us more of it and
[1:40:35] they say more of the Lord I want more of
[1:40:38] their faith o purge the Lord and tries
[1:40:41] fill us with thy goodness and with our
[1:40:43] power let us walk all the days of our
[1:40:46] life by the sixth sense by the sense of
[1:40:50] faith that's only given by Jesus Christ
[1:40:52] that what we pray for may we believe
[1:40:55] that we receive it and have no doubt in
[1:40:57] her heart and you promised that it would
[1:40:59] come to pass he said now he goes on you
[1:41:02] know he goes on to sing the song faith
[1:41:05] in the Father faith in the son faith and
[1:41:07] the Holy Ghost these three are one
[1:41:08] demons will tremble sinners awake faith
[1:41:11] in Jehovah will anything shake he makes
[1:41:14] a comment then he goes on the sings that
[1:41:16] again now in paragraph 193 says o my
[1:41:19] precious faith precious glorious faith
[1:41:23] God give me faith remember it's a shield
[1:41:28] of faith by faith Abraham by faith Isaac
[1:41:34] by faith Abel offered unto God a more
[1:41:36] excellent sacrifice than Cain him being
[1:41:39] yet dead testify
[1:41:40] o how we need faith I love him I want
[1:41:45] more faith my desire in this life and
[1:41:51] for this new year coming is more faith
[1:41:54] in God God take away any doubt that's in
[1:41:59] my mind if there should ever arise one
[1:42:03] Satan fights at me
[1:42:06] he fights at you he tries to shoot his
[1:42:09] arrows but may I have the shield of
[1:42:11] faith always before me
[1:42:13] to his stand the wiles of the devil -
[1:42:16] back to knock off his fiery darts they
[1:42:23] want more faith notice and second
[1:42:30] thought that Thessalonians I'm closing I
[1:42:31] just a few more scripts we want more
[1:42:33] faith right many times we're asking the
[1:42:35] Lord I want more I want more faith now
[1:42:39] watch how faith while faith is
[1:42:41] accompanied with this this real kind of
[1:42:44] faith that we need for battle your faith
[1:42:46] notice he's talking to the church your
[1:42:47] faith groweth exceedingly and the
[1:42:50] charity that's love of every one of you
[1:42:54] all toward each other
[1:42:55] aboundeth so that we ourselves glory in
[1:42:59] you in the Churches of God for your
[1:43:01] patience and faith in all your
[1:43:04] persecutions and tribulations that she
[1:43:08] endure the Bible tells us in first Kron
[1:43:11] 4 Corinthians 13 - that though I have
[1:43:15] all faith to talk and move remove
[1:43:17] mountains and have not charity I'm
[1:43:19] nothing over and over you find the
[1:43:24] underlying theme of this armor is the
[1:43:26] love of God because that's the armor of
[1:43:28] God that is the Holy Ghost that is the
[1:43:30] Word of God that's what keeps that
[1:43:34] shield well-oiled that's what keeps it
[1:43:37] saturated if the love of God you look at
[1:43:39] we're talking about the love of God
[1:43:41] we're talking about falling and continue
[1:43:44] to be in love with the Lord when you
[1:43:47] start when you find yourself getting
[1:43:48] irritable and short with one another
[1:43:50] it's time say Lord I need a refilling I
[1:43:54] need a refilling why because that
[1:43:57] revealing it'll work out towards other
[1:44:00] things that are coming in our life but
[1:44:01] listen don't get down on yourself just
[1:44:04] go to him who's able to gradually feel
[1:44:06] like you devil you kept me away where
[1:44:12] you tried to sidetrack me here and get
[1:44:14] it out here as though oh this person
[1:44:16] saying this and this person saying this
[1:44:18] the truth of the matter it's right here
[1:44:21] in my mortal member
[1:44:22] if I can take this and reign over this
[1:44:26] they can keep on saying what they want
[1:44:27] to say Jesus went to Calvary when
[1:44:32] criticism was all around him brother
[1:44:35] Branham said he made a choice not to pay
[1:44:38] any attention to the criticism and keep
[1:44:41] his eyes on Calvary
[1:44:43] I believe if he did it I believe he's
[1:44:47] acquit just to do it don't get focused
[1:44:53] on your failures greater is He that is
[1:44:57] in you it's what do you want to do about
[1:45:00] it do you want to turn the battle into
[1:45:02] the gate do you want to say Lord we
[1:45:04] don't ever try to perfect this you can't
[1:45:06] perfect this but it's to recognize when
[1:45:09] it rises up and say oh wait a minute
[1:45:11] here this is not about this and this and
[1:45:14] this those are all distractions but
[1:45:16] right here we need help we need help
[1:45:24] these are not things we can just talk
[1:45:26] about these are things that require
[1:45:28] dying when we're in the midst of battle
[1:45:30] and our fighting see the way that the
[1:45:32] mind the carnal mind would think of it
[1:45:34] it's looking at battle many times we're
[1:45:36] out here you know swinging the sword but
[1:45:38] remember the strength of the sword being
[1:45:40] swung the strength of the shield being
[1:45:42] up than that of the belt being tightened
[1:45:44] it all comes back to our individual walk
[1:45:47] with God Galatians 5:6 for in Jesus
[1:45:54] Christ neither circumcision availeth
[1:45:57] anything nor uncircumcision but faith
[1:46:00] which worketh by love the shield of
[1:46:05] faith I want more faith
[1:46:10] increase my faith Lord help me Lord to
[1:46:14] die in those areas where I'm tested and
[1:46:17] let Lord let my life be so filled with
[1:46:19] the love of God you know friends it
[1:46:21] isn't it isn't so much what we're saying
[1:46:23] oh I want to really I really want to
[1:46:25] want to have the right attitude or the
[1:46:27] right direction toward this person or
[1:46:29] this individual that's the right way to
[1:46:30] start are you with me that's the right
[1:46:34] way to start is to be in that manner
[1:46:36] because that's that's that's inclining
[1:46:39] in that direction but to say Lord fill
[1:46:43] me fill me with more of the love of God
[1:46:49] if we just focus on being for feel more
[1:46:52] of the love of God the love of God will
[1:46:54] take care of every area it'll fortify us
[1:47:01] and give us strength
[1:47:02] when bitter words are flying when things
[1:47:05] are said and we're misunderstood we're
[1:47:09] tempted to want to prove our point
[1:47:10] tempted to want to prove our point our
[1:47:13] side of it that's a trap there's time
[1:47:16] sometimes just for things to be said but
[1:47:19] always remember the battle it's not out
[1:47:21] there it's this right here that's
[1:47:23] combustible it's this right here
[1:47:27] but don't let sin reign in your mortal
[1:47:28] body keep up the shield of faith if
[1:47:33] you're weary just say Lord renew me let
[1:47:39] him renew you the love of God Oh am i I
[1:47:44] believe that with all my heart that
[1:47:45] that's that's our desire believe that's
[1:47:47] what we need is a refilling of the Holy
[1:47:50] Ghost I believe that with all my heart
[1:47:53] a refilling of the Holy Ghost it takes
[1:47:56] care of family problems a refilling of
[1:47:59] the Holy Ghost takes care of
[1:48:01] disagreements you know why because the
[1:48:04] water level got low and there starts to
[1:48:06] be a fence between you preach brother
[1:48:09] same but the love of God comes pouring
[1:48:11] in the water level starts rising Lord I
[1:48:16] want to be a conduit
[1:48:19] I don't want to be part of the Beavers
[1:48:22] dam I want to be a conduit that the
[1:48:24] water can flow let's pray father
