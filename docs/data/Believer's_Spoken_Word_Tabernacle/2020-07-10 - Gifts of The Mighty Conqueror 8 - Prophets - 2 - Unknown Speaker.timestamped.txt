[33:47] you know just just heard this morning
[33:49] just
[33:50] listening to brother branham in the
[33:53] first part of hebrews and he said you
[33:54] know

[33:56] christian be one completely
[34:00] give everything you've got every talent

[34:08] when i sing this song
[34:11] i know brother branham he tells us when
[34:14] we get there on that other side
[34:17] and to think that those who lived in
[34:20] those earlier ages
[34:22] they'll look us up say what age did you
[34:25] come out of
[34:28] and they will say how did you do it
[34:32] yet they know because they overcame also
[34:35] by the same one but i want you to think
[34:39] of
[34:40] the spirit of christ and how that will
[34:43] move
[34:44] as they would look for us and say how
[34:46] did you do it we want to hear your
[34:48] testimony
[34:50] we look back at them and say oh i can't
[34:52] wait to meet jeremiah
[34:54] i can't wait to meet paul i can't wait
[34:57] to meet them
[34:59] because what it is that we see in them
[35:02] as we see that standard of christ
[35:06] and i believe we we see that in the body
[35:09] of jesus christ
[35:11] right here on the earth if there's one
[35:13] thing
[35:14] one desire that would stir up in my
[35:17] heart we can look at one another
[35:19] it's not to be like somebody but it's
[35:21] that that how christ is reflected
[35:24] in that life oh god let it be reflected
[35:27] in me that way
[35:29] that's what real fellowship does it
[35:31] really it challenges not be great it
[35:33] challenges
[35:35] it's something that just encourages our
[35:37] life
[35:38] amen that christ would be the center
[35:42] of all these things don't you love him
[35:43] tonight amen

[36:41] us to capture it as well
[36:44] may we not be as lord just hearers of
[36:47] the word
[36:49] but god may we be found as doers of the
[36:52] word
[36:53] lord to look into the word of god
[36:56] into the perfect law of liberty lord
[36:59] taking account of our lives
[37:02] and looking to the very one

[37:26] protection during these times lord we're
[37:30] trusting in you lord
[37:32] and we just ask god for your leadership

[38:06] hearts lord
[38:08] we love you and we just appreciate your
[38:10] father
[38:11] in the name of jesus christ amen
[38:15] amen may god bless you let's turn in our
[38:17] bibles to ephesians 4.
[38:23] i hope you're not getting turned tired
[38:25] of turning there because we've got some
[38:27] we've still got some ground here but i
[38:29] want to just
[38:30] bring you back into those places
[38:34] and god has a purpose for the ministry
[38:37] that he's given god has a purpose for
[38:39] every
[38:40] one of his children in the body
[38:44] of jesus christ and so
[38:48] let's look here in ephesians 4 verse 7
[38:52] but unto every one of us is given grace
[38:55] according to the measure
[38:57] of the gift of christ
[39:00] wherefore he saith when he ascendeth up
[39:02] on high he led captivity captive and
[39:05] gave
[39:05] gifts unto men now
[39:08] that he ascended what is it but that he
[39:12] also descended first into the lower
[39:16] parts of the earth he that descended is
[39:19] the same
[39:20] also that ascended up far above all
[39:23] heavens
[39:24] that he might fill all thing
[39:28] and he gave some apostles and some
[39:32] prophets and some evangelists
[39:34] and some pastors and teachers
[39:37] may god bless the reading of the word
[39:39] bless you as you're being seated
[39:42] paul would go on and we for sake of time
[39:46] will not
[39:46] read on there from verse 12 through
[39:49] verse 16
[39:50] but the whole purpose it's the working
[39:53] of the ministry
[39:55] of jesus christ the word working
[39:58] and becoming preeminent in the body of
[40:01] believers
[40:02] and there's a there's god has within it
[40:05] a reason
[40:06] and a purpose of what he's doing paul
[40:09] would
[40:10] come into another place in first
[40:12] corinthians 12 27 and say now
[40:14] ye are the body of christ and members in
[40:17] particular
[40:18] and god hath set in the church first
[40:21] apostles
[40:22] secondarily prophets thirdly teachers
[40:24] and he goes
[40:25] on from there and i want to continue
[40:27] tonight to look at that
[40:29] thought if god will just help us there's
[40:31] no way that we'll get
[40:32] we'll get finished with this tonight but
[40:35] on that thought
[40:36] of prophets and to see
[40:40] of how that god as we looked at last
[40:42] week
[40:43] not that we would need any convincing of
[40:46] this but to recognize that god
[40:48] has indeed had prophets in the new
[40:51] testament and we
[40:52] we see that within the scripture i know
[40:54] that to be
[40:55] uh many times many of you have come in
[40:58] contact with
[40:58] uh people who have taken those
[41:00] scriptures like we looked at it last
[41:02] week where it says the law and the
[41:03] prophets were until john
[41:05] but that in itself to take it and just
[41:08] to say
[41:08] that there's no more prophets is an
[41:11] error
[41:12] because god has showed that there were
[41:14] he first of all he gave
[41:16] these gifts unto the church and and
[41:20] it is shown throughout the scripture now
[41:22] when we looked at it last week
[41:25] we were looking at the term prophets and
[41:27] i'll read
[41:28] go into something here in just a moment
[41:30] when we know
[41:31] that that word in in just in the
[41:34] dictionary and in the english
[41:35] it means one who is to tell forth
[41:38] foretell
[41:39] or to preach and so we we
[41:42] recognize that every new testament
[41:45] prophet is a preacher every preacher
[41:48] is a new testament prophet but one of
[41:51] the things that's very
[41:52] clear god has set forth and i'm not
[41:55] going to get into this tonight
[41:57] but god set forth here the working
[42:01] where here we find john the baptist
[42:04] would be
[42:04] a prophet that would come that would be
[42:08] a keystone of between the old and the
[42:11] new
[42:11] and then we find the lord jesus himself
[42:14] being the god prophet the prophet
[42:16] of all prophets and then when the word
[42:20] is come uh in the outpouring of the holy
[42:23] spirit
[42:24] to remember that the gentiles themselves
[42:28] that paul was set aside by god
[42:31] as a prophet to the church of the living
[42:34] god not just a preacher
[42:36] but one who would receive the word of
[42:39] the lord
[42:40] and would separate and divide and bring
[42:42] together law and grace and to tie
[42:45] together
[42:45] the entire bible and that that how god
[42:49] would even begin that for the gentile
[42:52] age
[42:52] god held a promise in his word you may
[42:55] have said here for a long time you may
[42:57] have been acquainted with it for a long
[42:59] time
[42:59] but to recognize that god placed a
[43:02] promise in his word
[43:04] or from the old testament and in many
[43:06] places
[43:07] all the way in the new how that he would
[43:09] visit
[43:10] us in this hour with a prophetic
[43:14] ministry it was all with us to declare
[43:18] that jesus christ is the same yesterday
[43:22] today and forever don't just let that be
[43:24] a phrase it is the same god of what he
[43:28] was before
[43:29] he's not changed at all men has
[43:32] changed him and they
[43:35] and because of that that's why the
[43:37] sickness and disease
[43:39] are among their people but when he is
[43:42] preached and known to be the same
[43:44] he is still the bowman gilead that
[43:46] brings healing
[43:48] to wounds he's the same one that can
[43:50] take
[43:51] lives that that brother branham i think
[43:53] as he said it today when i was listening
[43:55] he said to where the devil even refuses
[43:58] the people
[43:58] he's used them in such a way but god
[44:01] will come right down and say
[44:03] thou take that life and i'll reflect my
[44:05] glory
[44:06] god takes a hold of that life and god
[44:08] would take a life that the world would
[44:10] say
[44:11] nowhere for him and everything but god
[44:14] comes down by his amazing grace
[44:16] and will sweep into that life and so
[44:18] transform that life
[44:20] he'll take what was such an outcast and
[44:23] god by his life
[44:24] will bring to light and reality the
[44:27] saint of god that's trapped on the
[44:29] inside
[44:32] oh there's no liberty outside of jesus
[44:35] christ
[44:37] so when we look at this with with
[44:39] prophets
[44:40] i want you just to i'm going to just let
[44:42] me just make this statement and then
[44:44] i'll move on
[44:45] brother branham what i'm getting ready
[44:47] to read from here
[44:48] in july of 63 brother branham himself
[44:52] even in earlier parts of the ministry
[44:55] even when he had
[44:56] the uh ministers together in the message
[44:59] taking sides with jesus and he would
[45:02] speak to them and he would say now
[45:03] brethren
[45:04] i'm not a prophet and he would go
[45:07] through this and lay it out and this is
[45:08] why
[45:09] he said because here i am operating like
[45:11] an evangelist and you can't mix the two
[45:14] offices now remember
[45:15] hearing his understanding is coming out
[45:18] that his understanding of a prophet he's
[45:21] looking back at the old testament
[45:23] and seeing an old testament prophet he's
[45:25] in the wilderness he says
[45:26] he doesn't hold meetings he doesn't pray
[45:28] for the sick he doesn't have healing
[45:30] campaigns
[45:31] he's looking at all that and god this is
[45:34] in
[45:34] may of 62. but the but the holy spirit
[45:38] notice the work is still going on
[45:41] but god in 1963 there uh
[45:44] in the standing in the gap this is where
[45:46] the holy spirit
[45:48] points out to the prophet because he's
[45:50] saying
[45:51] you said i'm a prophet lord i i don't
[45:53] see how i fit that bill
[45:54] from the scripture god has to open his
[45:57] understanding and say
[45:59] that was the old testament prophets
[46:02] you've been called to a higher office
[46:04] you are a new testament officer and you
[46:07] are new testament prophet you've been
[46:09] given
[46:09] more gifts than them this he said is the
[46:13] apostolic
[46:14] form so then this is where we begin to
[46:17] find
[46:18] the balance god will deal relative to
[46:21] one man
[46:22] it is a one-man message in the old
[46:24] testament there was not ministry going
[46:26] out under that of apostles and
[46:28] evangelists
[46:29] and teachers but over here in the new
[46:32] testament
[46:33] there is all of the ministerial gifts
[46:35] that go forth from under that ministry
[46:37] of the prophet
[46:39] that's an important revelation within
[46:41] them
[46:43] so to see that when brother randall now
[46:46] will
[46:47] hear these these parts you see as he's
[46:50] growing because remember
[46:51] a prophet only knows what god reveals to
[46:54] him
[46:56] a prophet can stand and look at
[46:57] something god shows him
[46:59] and he'll look at it he doesn't know
[47:01] what it is unless god
[47:03] interprets it for him is that right
[47:06] zachariah seen again the lamp stands
[47:08] what is this
[47:08] i don't know what is it right john
[47:11] on the isle of patmos sees those in
[47:13] white robes not just that's just one of
[47:15] many places
[47:16] and he says john what is this thou
[47:18] knowest what is it
[47:20] you see a prophet is an instrument a
[47:22] vessel used by
[47:24] god that god is the one who reveals to
[47:27] that prophet oh my i feel like shouting
[47:29] right now
[47:30] you see that prophet is not going to a
[47:32] school of theology
[47:34] or some man's thought he's lifted above
[47:37] the thoughts and ideas of man because
[47:39] the ideas and thoughts of man can
[47:41] pervade but god in his grace
[47:44] will lift that man up and he will begin
[47:47] to see the things that's
[47:48] necessary and come back and report them
[47:51] to the children of god
[47:54] oh my let me read here god he says
[47:59] he says a real genuine prophet
[48:02] is a special person not a special you
[48:05] know
[48:05] be any different from anybody else but
[48:07] he's got a special job
[48:09] he has a special commission he's got to
[48:12] be special
[48:13] a little out of the way from the others
[48:15] in order to do that
[48:17] just like god is liking this prophets to
[48:19] be an eagle
[48:20] now an eagle is a special bird he's just
[48:23] a bird but he's a special bird
[48:25] he can fly higher than other birds he
[48:28] can see
[48:28] farther than other birds and now
[48:32] in order to go higher he's got to be
[48:34] built so he can go higher
[48:36] and what good would it do to him to go
[48:38] up there
[48:39] unless he could see what he was doing
[48:42] after he got up there
[48:43] so he has to be special built bird he
[48:46] he's kind of in the hawk family he's a
[48:47] ripper of the bill
[48:49] and he said many of them are scavengers
[48:51] there's about 40 different kinds of
[48:52] eagles
[48:53] but the prophet is a special man
[48:56] a prophet is a man whom the word of the
[48:58] lord
[48:59] comes to because the prophet is so
[49:02] designed
[49:03] in his life that his subconscious and
[49:06] his first conscience
[49:07] is so close together that he doesn't go
[49:11] to sleep
[49:12] to dream his dream he sees it when he's
[49:15] wide awake
[49:16] now that's something god has to do see
[49:19] he sees
[49:20] what's going on it's very important he
[49:23] sees
[49:23] what god's doing
[49:27] god's got a vessel on earth that god can
[49:30] speak
[49:31] to in this way
[49:35] hallelujah a prophet foresees way off
[49:38] see
[49:39] the things that is coming he sees the
[49:42] cup of god's wrath
[49:43] full before it's filled you catch that
[49:47] he sees it full before it's filled
[49:50] i don't know how many of you have
[49:52] recorded you know
[49:53] as i'm going through and just you know
[49:55] you just listen to the message listen
[49:57] the message
[49:58] even with everything that's been taking
[50:00] place it's
[50:01] this has not just happened just now it's
[50:03] happened to me many times before
[50:05] it sounds as though the prophet is right
[50:08] here
[50:10] but you know why because it's not
[50:12] brother branham
[50:13] it is the same angel of the lord he
[50:17] which was which is and which is to come
[50:20] [Applause]
[50:21] he's identifying things there
[50:24] that are in seed form like brother
[50:27] brahma says in satan's eden think of it
[50:29] i mean here satan's eating and then uh
[50:32] evening messenger and he talks about
[50:33] boys
[50:34] walking through the playground with
[50:36] their britches hanging down
[50:39] i don't know i don't think that took
[50:40] place in the 60s
[50:43] right that inspiration came out of
[50:45] prison
[50:50] we need to be careful what we're
[50:51] inspired by
[50:54] amen there's a living image of a living
[50:57] god just like when that little eagle
[50:59] he was told to look up it was a pamphlet
[51:01] he saw he saw
[51:03] a living eagle he saw a being that he
[51:06] was
[51:08] are you with me
[51:11] oh glory so he can say
[51:14] thus saith the lord god will destroy
[51:17] this city except you repent why
[51:19] he's an eagle he rides way up in yonder
[51:22] and he looks way off there
[51:23] and he sees that cup of wrath poured out
[51:27] that's what the prophets look at he
[51:29] ain't looking at what's going on here
[51:31] he's looking yonder what a lesson for us
[51:36] why would we look here when we had
[51:39] greater eyes come
[51:42] why would we get caught up with what's
[51:43] going on around us
[51:45] let us focus on the true vision
[51:50] the things that we see are what temporal
[51:53] but those things that are the unseen are
[51:56] eternal
[52:01] oh it says you can see he says it's
[52:04] coming
[52:05] he can see uh so high till he can see
[52:09] that shade that darkness
[52:10] he said the world would be darkness and
[52:12] gross darkness he's up high enough
[52:14] the sun's shining now but he sees that
[52:17] shade coming
[52:18] he's saying what he's looking at it
[52:21] ain't here yet
[52:22] but it'll sure be here it's going to be
[52:25] here gross darkness upon the people
[52:28] we can truly say this day this scripture
[52:30] is fulfilled
[52:33] gross darkness when people don't know
[52:35] what they are
[52:38] not even able to make sound reason
[52:40] judgments
[52:42] darkness upon the people what is it it's
[52:45] the spirits that have been released
[52:47] darkness and it has been made available
[52:50] because of the false
[52:52] teachings that they've been under
[52:56] gross darkness upon the people
[53:01] he knows it's coming years away yet he
[53:04] sees it
[53:04] he goes into amos he said amos he was
[53:07] that anointed prophet of god
[53:09] he saw the darkness and the judgment he
[53:11] seen syria come down with their chariots
[53:13] and sweep through there
[53:14] slaughter them people out he saw it
[53:17] coming and the judgment of god upon them
[53:19] 50 years before it happened being a
[53:22] prophet
[53:23] he was lifted up i want you just to
[53:25] catch this here we'll work with this
[53:26] tonight
[53:27] being a prophet he was lifted up into
[53:30] the spirit
[53:31] and he saw it far off he saw the cup
[53:35] full before it was filled
[53:39] a prophet is born a prophet
[53:47] let me just say it not only as a prophet
[53:48] born a prophet evangelist pastor
[53:50] all of them it's not hands being laid on
[53:53] that puts the gift in
[53:57] the laying on of hands is simply to
[53:59] recognize what god has already testified
[54:02] is that right when david was anointed
[54:04] king it was because the testimony had
[54:06] already went before
[54:09] see that's what real true listen to me
[54:10] this is just a little that's what real
[54:12] true voting is
[54:13] in the assembly when it's voted on a
[54:17] pastor or this or that
[54:18] it's to identify what god has already
[54:21] identified the vote is not a political
[54:25] thing
[54:26] that's why the church of the living god
[54:27] is not a democracy it's a theocracy
[54:31] oh i know that stumbles some people but
[54:33] that's the reality
[54:34] it is it is people who are in tune with
[54:37] the spirit of
[54:38] god and to recognize what god has placed
[54:41] before them
[54:42] that's the same way when it comes to
[54:44] deacons trustees and on and on
[54:46] suddenly it's god it's identifying what
[54:49] god has placed here that's free
[54:53] a prophet is born a prophet
[54:57] uh brother branham would bring this so
[54:59] clearly because of the confusion
[55:02] take us right back into the scriptures
[55:04] to show the difference
[55:07] that that that that the spirit of
[55:09] prophecy
[55:10] is is the holy ghost the testimony of
[55:12] jesus christ
[55:13] in the church and how that the gift of
[55:16] prophecy
[55:16] is one of the nine spiritual gifts not
[55:18] belonging to anybody
[55:20] but meals throughout the body but the
[55:23] brain said it could fall on this one
[55:24] tonight
[55:25] and never again and fall over on this
[55:26] one the next night same with every
[55:28] every one of the nine spiritual gifts
[55:30] but but a
[55:31] prophet of god remember a gift of
[55:34] prophecy
[55:35] is to be judged before it's ever
[55:39] received
[55:41] that's scripture is that right but a
[55:44] prophet
[55:45] nobody stands before a prophet
[55:49] so there's there is god giving a
[55:52] declaration
[55:53] and a witness in his word to the
[55:56] children of god
[55:58] that indeed this is my prophet now
[56:01] brother branham he picks this up in the
[56:02] voice of the sign
[56:05] and he says now the english word a
[56:07] prophet just means a preacher
[56:09] anybody every every preacher is a
[56:11] prophet because he is foretelling
[56:12] something
[56:13] preaching the word under inspiration
[56:16] is called a prophet but in the old
[56:19] testament
[56:20] they were more than that they were seers
[56:23] he's bringing it now
[56:25] down into our day what god has promised
[56:29] in our day
[56:33] it says that now they were man who told
[56:35] things that was coming to pass
[56:36] they give him the rights that give him
[56:39] the rights to be the interpreter of the
[56:41] word for that day
[56:42] because god took the word of that day
[56:44] and interpreted it
[56:45] himself through that man
[56:49] it goes on the same things that we had
[56:51] mentioned before
[56:52] and in paragraph 83 says the entire
[56:55] bible
[56:56] was wrote by the prophets
[56:59] in first peter chapter 1 verse 10 i know
[57:03] i'm being very deliberate but i want to
[57:04] lay these in i don't want to so much
[57:06] preach it i want to lay it in and teach
[57:08] it
[57:08] in verse 10 of which salvation now he's
[57:11] talking about the coming
[57:13] of the messiah all the bank of
[57:17] prophecies
[57:18] i want you to think of it when brother
[57:19] brown talks about
[57:21] walking how that when cleophius
[57:25] and the other disciple were walking on
[57:27] on the road to emmaus
[57:30] remember here the lord jesus the
[57:32] resurrected lord jesus christ
[57:35] steps out and begins to walk with them
[57:38] they
[57:38] are sad they are downcast yet they've
[57:42] been a part
[57:43] of the very ministry of the messiah but
[57:46] there are pieces that has not been tied
[57:49] together for them
[57:51] and when those pieces are not tied
[57:53] together they were sad
[57:54] but he steps out think of it you know
[57:57] brother adam says in christ the mystery
[57:59] this six hour eight hour sermon he took
[58:02] all of the prophecies that was there
[58:05] from the law
[58:06] the prophets the psalms my you could
[58:08] spend hours on the book of isaiah alone
[58:11] let alone all the rest and to think he
[58:13] began to speak to them
[58:15] all the prophecies even concerning the
[58:18] sufferings and
[58:19] everything that was to be fulfilled he
[58:21] made
[58:22] clear to them events that were taking
[58:25] place
[58:26] he had tied it in its prophecy he tied
[58:29] in
[58:29] what is happening has already been
[58:31] spoken what was spoken
[58:33] is what was already seen before the
[58:35] foundation of the world
[58:37] he's tying events together
[58:42] is that right now this is where in first
[58:46] peter 10 this is what peter
[58:48] is speaking and notice how peter would
[58:49] write this of which salvation
[58:52] the prophets have inquired and searched
[58:56] diligently
[58:57] who prophesied of the grace that should
[58:59] come to you
[59:00] searching what or what manner of time
[59:03] the spirit
[59:04] of christ which was in them did signify
[59:08] when it testified beforehand the
[59:10] sufferings of christ and the glory
[59:12] that should follow so what was in the
[59:14] prophets the spirit of christ
[59:17] the same one who created
[59:20] a body that he might come down
[59:24] and redeem us so it was not
[59:27] the prophet speaking by their own will
[59:30] but they were set aside moved upon by
[59:33] the spirit of god
[59:34] it was the spirit of christ in them
[59:38] identifying his own working and his own
[59:41] pathway so
[59:44] if it was the spirit of christ in the
[59:47] prophets
[59:48] to announce or to prophesy of what was
[59:51] coming
[59:52] it would take the same spirit of christ
[59:54] to come
[59:55] and fulfill it in the lives of those who
[59:58] that word was ordained to come to pass
[1:00:01] in
[1:00:03] all glory be to god unto whom it was
[1:00:06] revealed
[1:00:08] that not unto themselves but unto us did
[1:00:10] they minister these things notice
[1:00:12] it was revealed but yet they saw not all
[1:00:14] things
[1:00:16] it was open it was revealed to them as
[1:00:18] much as god
[1:00:19] would show them but they were
[1:00:22] certain in what god had revealed to them
[1:00:27] they didn't have to see all of the folds
[1:00:29] opening up or all the parts
[1:00:30] they were certain in what god had
[1:00:33] revealed
[1:00:35] oh glory aren't you glad you could say
[1:00:38] the same thing i'm certain
[1:00:39] in what god has revealed i may not see
[1:00:43] everything i may not understand
[1:00:44] everything but i know
[1:00:45] what god has revealed is right now for
[1:00:48] this time
[1:00:49] i am anchored to that unseen realm
[1:00:54] oh glory be to god oh how precious is
[1:00:57] that anchor in this hour
[1:01:01] oh yeah you remember in the days of paul
[1:01:03] there were men
[1:01:04] on the ship on the ship when they were
[1:01:07] going
[1:01:08] and you know they come up on the island
[1:01:10] there were men on the ship
[1:01:12] who came under disguise to try to get
[1:01:15] rid of
[1:01:16] uh the anchor and try to get rid of all
[1:01:18] these other things but the spirit of god
[1:01:20] revealed it to paul and said
[1:01:21] ah tell these men don't you go that way
[1:01:23] don't you go this way
[1:01:24] get back in the ship why because if you
[1:01:28] don't abide in the ship
[1:01:29] it's death all who remain
[1:01:33] will be safe what is that speaking of
[1:01:36] there is no other place of safety
[1:01:39] than in jesus christ under the blood
[1:01:44] [Music]
[1:01:46] when we don't have we're not operating
[1:01:48] under disguise
[1:01:49] brother it's been revealed who we really
[1:01:51] are
[1:01:53] i'm not under a disguise we're not under
[1:01:56] a disguise
[1:01:57] let that in the book of
[1:01:59] revelations who's all
[1:02:00] decked up and painted up and has all
[1:02:02] these crosses and everything
[1:02:04] she is a faker she is under a disguise
[1:02:08] but the spirit of god comes down and
[1:02:10] reveals you and i
[1:02:12] it's not something we're putting on
[1:02:14] serving god it's a reality
[1:02:16] he is my own and all he is my life he
[1:02:20] has
[1:02:20] changed me
[1:02:22] [Music]
[1:02:24] glory be to god
[1:02:28] oh my unto us they did minister the
[1:02:32] things which are now reported unto you
[1:02:34] by them that have preached the gospel
[1:02:35] unto you with the holy ghost sent down
[1:02:37] from heaven
[1:02:38] which things the angels desire to look
[1:02:41] into
[1:02:43] now let me just maybe refer to this
[1:02:45] instead of
[1:02:46] reading it you can read it when you get
[1:02:48] home
[1:02:50] but out of exodus 4 when god calls moses
[1:02:54] there's a promise god made to abraham
[1:02:57] that i will visit them after 400 years
[1:03:02] god gets moses separated
[1:03:06] unto himself
[1:03:09] imagine moses felt pretty lonely
[1:03:12] he'd been run out of egypt after his
[1:03:14] mama had told
[1:03:16] him he had went to sunday school he had
[1:03:18] memorized all the seven messengers
[1:03:20] he had memorized all the sevens come on
[1:03:22] now he had all of those things down pat
[1:03:25] he knew
[1:03:26] you know the different supernatural acts
[1:03:28] in the life of the prophet
[1:03:31] he had heard the ministering you're a
[1:03:33] special person
[1:03:34] a god has ordained you he had heard that
[1:03:37] but here he is
[1:03:38] trying to go about it in his own
[1:03:40] strength
[1:03:42] he's trying to live it by what he's
[1:03:44] learned and yet on the inside does not
[1:03:46] match
[1:03:47] up with what the words calling for in
[1:03:49] other words he doesn't have a heart
[1:03:51] that's been turned to this word
[1:03:53] he's got a mind that knows it but a
[1:03:55] heart that's not been turned
[1:03:56] so god has to bring him and cause him to
[1:03:59] be
[1:04:00] exiled from egypt the very place that he
[1:04:03] could say
[1:04:03] i'm supposed to be there but god says
[1:04:06] but first of all
[1:04:07] i've got to strip you i've got to clean
[1:04:10] you and then i've got to equip you
[1:04:12] and you've got to become my prisoner
[1:04:14] because you're still
[1:04:15] a prisoner of your own will
[1:04:20] so god called moses this was a
[1:04:22] conference out here
[1:04:23] moses didn't understand he didn't know
[1:04:25] what was going on he had forgot
[1:04:27] everything everything had been lost he
[1:04:29] just had forgotten
[1:04:30] he was going on about his life but one
[1:04:32] day he's out there with the sheep
[1:04:34] and he looks up and it catches his
[1:04:36] attention god knew he would pass that
[1:04:38] way
[1:04:40] and god hear the very fire it's in that
[1:04:44] bush and it doesn't consume the bush
[1:04:46] that phenomenal the supernatural it
[1:04:48] takes a hold and gets moses attention
[1:04:50] he comes up before it and he takes off
[1:04:53] his shoes he takes off
[1:04:54] and he lays down before it but you see
[1:04:57] just taking off his shoes was not going
[1:04:58] to be enough
[1:04:59] that was a good start come on somebody
[1:05:02] but it had to come to a place
[1:05:04] to where he would completely lay down
[1:05:06] his
[1:05:07] own life his own will his own thinking
[1:05:11] oh god us this is almost just
[1:05:14] low tongue lord i i i gotta can't can't
[1:05:17] talk lord
[1:05:18] god had to say are you willing to get
[1:05:20] weaker
[1:05:23] i didn't call you because you were a man
[1:05:25] of eloquent speech
[1:05:26] i called you because i foreigned you
[1:05:28] from the foundation of the world
[1:05:30] your weaknesses think about this in the
[1:05:32] presence of god
[1:05:33] his weaknesses shine forth you never
[1:05:36] hear mittens mention
[1:05:37] of the weaknesses while he's down in
[1:05:39] egypt but once he gets in the presence
[1:05:41] of god
[1:05:42] every weakness he has becomes exposed
[1:05:46] brother there's nothing like the
[1:05:47] presence of god
[1:05:49] it knocks all the dirt and the rubbish
[1:05:51] and the trash
[1:05:52] it makes us realize we're nothing but 84
[1:05:56] cents worth of dirt
[1:05:57] but there's a greatness a grace that god
[1:06:01] has placed on the inside if it can get
[1:06:04] us in a place to yield ourselves
[1:06:07] all it takes is a yielded life
[1:06:11] he could not listen brother braham said
[1:06:13] he could not feed the five thousand
[1:06:15] if the little lad had not given him the
[1:06:17] lunch
[1:06:18] he took something that was there and
[1:06:21] transformed it
[1:06:22] but it had to be given to him aren't you
[1:06:25] glad that god moved upon your heart
[1:06:27] and you said lord all i've got is a
[1:06:29] little lunch all i've got is a
[1:06:31] is a little faith lord i have a little
[1:06:33] faith
[1:06:34] to believe that you're the same he said
[1:06:36] give it to me
[1:06:37] surrender it in my head i'll take that
[1:06:40] little faith
[1:06:41] i'll multiply it from faith unto faith
[1:06:44] from righteousness unto righteousness
[1:06:46] i'll transform your life
[1:06:50] hallelujah here he is before this bush
[1:06:54] god speaks to him he lets him know
[1:06:59] there's going to be two signs that's
[1:07:01] given
[1:07:02] and every sign there's going to be a
[1:07:05] voice
[1:07:07] i want you to listen to me every sign
[1:07:11] there's going to be a voice god don't
[1:07:14] send signs to be sending signs
[1:07:20] he's speaking god through a sign
[1:07:23] is getting the attention to say i'm
[1:07:26] wanting to speak personally
[1:07:36] in exodus 4 i just i just have to pass
[1:07:38] over that but i've just referred to that
[1:07:40] verse 8 can i read that one it shall
[1:07:42] come to pass
[1:07:44] if they will not believe thee neither
[1:07:46] hearken to the voice of the first sign
[1:07:49] that they will believe the voice of the
[1:07:51] latter sign see god's mercy he didn't
[1:07:53] have to give multiple signs
[1:07:57] but this is god's mercy and his
[1:07:58] compassion
[1:08:00] egypt's not going to receive it but his
[1:08:02] elect will
[1:08:04] and remember the hardest thing god has
[1:08:06] ever had to do is get one mortal to
[1:08:07] believe another mortal
[1:08:10] that's why we must have the supernatural
[1:08:15] glory be to god and it shall come to
[1:08:17] pass watch
[1:08:18] if they will not believe also these two
[1:08:20] signs neither hearken unto thy voice
[1:08:22] that thou shalt take of the water of the
[1:08:25] river notice
[1:08:26] things that they need you shall take
[1:08:28] from it and
[1:08:29] pour it upon the dry land and the water
[1:08:31] which thou take us out of the river
[1:08:33] shall become blood upon the dry land
[1:08:35] what was it judgment
[1:08:37] if they reject judgment is poured out
[1:08:39] upon the land
[1:08:42] blood would be poured out you see all
[1:08:45] the way
[1:08:46] think of this characteristic
[1:08:50] i know some of these things may seem to
[1:08:52] be redundant but
[1:08:54] i think it's not only good review peter
[1:08:56] said as long as i'm with you
[1:08:58] i want to stir up your pure mind by way
[1:08:59] of remembrance
[1:09:01] but i think it's good that also we have
[1:09:03] new ones young ones that are among us
[1:09:05] that they hear this
[1:09:10] everywhere you look in the scriptures
[1:09:14] elijah the tishbite where did he come
[1:09:15] from yeah who's his father or mother
[1:09:22] moses moses comes from amram and yoshi
[1:09:26] we have that that's one of the few
[1:09:30] of the prophets never in the scripture
[1:09:33] do the prophets step from out of the
[1:09:36] church
[1:09:37] the organizational system
[1:09:41] they come outside of that because why
[1:09:44] god can't speak to him inside of there
[1:09:47] this is why god had to pull out
[1:09:49] the prophet in this hour and then
[1:09:52] remember
[1:09:52] god did not open and loosen the seals
[1:09:56] in a denomination it was on the outside
[1:09:59] why christ suffered without the gate
[1:10:02] we must go to him without the gate
[1:10:07] the prophet comes to call the people
[1:10:09] back to the word from which they drifted
[1:10:12] you never read the old testament
[1:10:14] prophets and them coming and patting
[1:10:16] people on the back oh everything's all
[1:10:18] right you're the blessed of the lord
[1:10:19] you're the
[1:10:20] the false prophets you do peace
[1:10:24] oh peace everything's gonna be all right
[1:10:27] it's gonna be all right
[1:10:28] false prophets now i know we got them
[1:10:31] whether prophets media prophets oh
[1:10:33] they're all false prophets
[1:10:35] but i'm talking about false prophets in
[1:10:36] the church too
[1:10:39] why they are not bringing the people to
[1:10:42] the world
[1:10:44] before you can ever come to the way
[1:10:46] first of all before you can ever get
[1:10:48] where you need to be
[1:10:49] you have to repent
[1:10:52] a lack of repentance will gain no
[1:10:55] entrance
[1:10:57] so the prophet has come to do what call
[1:10:59] the people back to the word
[1:11:02] brother tells us he said the reason god
[1:11:04] will send a prophet
[1:11:05] he said because people get away from
[1:11:06] reading their bibles
[1:11:11] i look at that statement and i ponder
[1:11:13] does he mean that they were not going
[1:11:14] through
[1:11:14] and reading them at all perhaps they're
[1:11:16] not reading their bibles but perhaps
[1:11:18] they're not reading them meaning
[1:11:19] they're not having relationship they're
[1:11:22] not letting the word
[1:11:23] really penetrate their lives
[1:11:26] and god what does he do he sends a
[1:11:28] prophet to do what
[1:11:29] get the people back to the word that
[1:11:31] they've already been given
[1:11:33] it makes known the supernatural god is
[1:11:36] among them
[1:11:37] moses failed with his natural thinking
[1:11:41] but when he became yoked and tied to the
[1:11:44] word
[1:11:44] by the supernatural god brother there
[1:11:47] was a lot of opposition that came his
[1:11:49] way
[1:11:50] but he had an anchor
[1:11:53] he had a hole in his life that held him
[1:11:56] when situations got bleak he could go to
[1:11:59] the lord
[1:12:00] even when things were not happening
[1:12:02] according to his thinking he had an
[1:12:03] anchor that was greater than his
[1:12:06] thinking
[1:12:08] oh i thank god for the holy ghost
[1:12:13] the prophets when they come and every
[1:12:15] time they come the
[1:12:16] systems the ecclesiastical systems
[1:12:19] condemn them
[1:12:22] they condemn they want to tear them down
[1:12:27] the same way you see this parallel
[1:12:30] the same way that god deals with taking
[1:12:33] an individual like as he took elijah
[1:12:37] and he reveals himself to elijah
[1:12:40] calling to call the people back to the
[1:12:42] word
[1:12:43] god here making himself known
[1:12:46] to an individual to to elijah that's the
[1:12:51] same way god
[1:12:52] does with us as individuals
[1:12:55] it's not a church revelation
[1:12:59] it's not a group revelation oh praise
[1:13:02] god i'm in the message
[1:13:03] no no is it in you
[1:13:07] are you in jesus christ have you been
[1:13:10] born again
[1:13:12] god does not call this is not a
[1:13:14] collective revelation
[1:13:16] it's not a group thing this is a
[1:13:19] personal identification
[1:13:22] is that right that's what the holy ghost
[1:13:24] comes to it comes to personally
[1:13:27] identify you
[1:13:31] oh glory be to god oh my
[1:13:34] my my mind let me read here
[1:13:38] the scripture out of deuteronomy 18.
[1:13:42] and then we'll move to some things in
[1:13:44] deuteronomy 18 verse 15.
[1:13:46] here here is moses speaking
[1:13:50] by the holy spirit the lord thy god will
[1:13:52] raise up unto thee a prophet
[1:13:54] from the midst of thee of thy brother
[1:13:56] and like unto me
[1:13:58] unto him ye shall hearken he's speaking
[1:14:01] of the messiah according to all that he
[1:14:05] that thou
[1:14:05] desirest of the lord thy god in horeb in
[1:14:08] the day of the assembly saying
[1:14:10] let me not hear again the voice of the
[1:14:11] lord my god neither let me see this
[1:14:13] great fire anymore
[1:14:14] then i die not and the lord said unto me
[1:14:17] they have well spoken
[1:14:18] that which they have spoken now remember
[1:14:20] god came down
[1:14:22] and moses said as they responded no
[1:14:25] don't let god speak no more let moses
[1:14:27] speak
[1:14:29] and moses said god has come to prove you
[1:14:32] that you might fear him why because when
[1:14:36] moses would speak
[1:14:37] they may not hear the rune and
[1:14:40] but it was the same god it was god now
[1:14:43] thundering through a human voice
[1:14:45] are you with me now it was thunders
[1:14:48] coming out through
[1:14:49] that of a voice oh glory
[1:14:52] so here now look at this here they could
[1:14:55] be looking they could say oh the lord
[1:14:56] thy god he's gonna raise up a prophet
[1:14:58] but remember
[1:14:59] the spirit of christ was in the prophets
[1:15:02] it was testifying jeremiah was a portion
[1:15:04] isaiah was a portion each of them they
[1:15:07] were not taking away
[1:15:08] but when the elect heard it it only put
[1:15:11] them in tune for their day
[1:15:12] and they were tied to that prophecy
[1:15:15] those that got up on that easter morning
[1:15:17] with him
[1:15:17] were those who were tied to this
[1:15:19] prophecy
[1:15:21] they had heard the voice of god in their
[1:15:23] day
[1:15:24] it was not ritual oh it's time to go up
[1:15:26] for this feast oh it's time to do this
[1:15:28] oh it's time to do that oh
[1:15:29] no no it was not a ritual life it was an
[1:15:32] effectual life
[1:15:35] yeah you you read those in the old
[1:15:38] testament
[1:15:39] they they heard god's voice there was a
[1:15:42] reference they were moved with
[1:15:45] oh brother and sister don't let this
[1:15:46] become common to you and i
[1:15:49] let's be referenced as the bible said
[1:15:51] let us have reverence grace that we
[1:15:52] might serve him with reverence
[1:15:54] notice he said i will raise them up a
[1:15:58] prophet
[1:15:59] i will raise them up a prophet from
[1:16:00] among the brethren like unto thee and
[1:16:02] will put my words in his mouth
[1:16:04] and he shall speak unto them all that i
[1:16:06] command him
[1:16:08] and it shall come to pass that whosoever
[1:16:10] will not hearken unto my words
[1:16:13] which he shall speak in my name i will
[1:16:16] require it of him
[1:16:18] but the prophet which shall presume to
[1:16:21] speak a word
[1:16:22] in my name which i have not commanded
[1:16:25] him to speak
[1:16:27] or that shall speak in the name of other
[1:16:29] gods
[1:16:30] even that prophet shall die
[1:16:33] and if thou say in thine heart how shall
[1:16:36] we know the word which the lord had not
[1:16:39] spoken
[1:16:40] when a prophet speaketh in the name of
[1:16:43] the lord
[1:16:44] if the thing follow not nor come to pass
[1:16:47] that is the thing which the lord hath
[1:16:49] not spoken
[1:16:50] but the prophet hath spoken it
[1:16:52] presumptuously
[1:16:54] thou shalt not be afraid of him
[1:17:00] you see the word when a prophet would
[1:17:02] speak
[1:17:04] the light of the urine the breastplate
[1:17:07] of aaron
[1:17:08] if this was of god and they brought him
[1:17:11] before
[1:17:12] it was to make all of this light up
[1:17:16] is that right if it didn't light up you
[1:17:19] could say
[1:17:20] you're lying i don't care how much you
[1:17:23] feel about your line
[1:17:25] is that right so here notice
[1:17:28] now to think that what they spoke had to
[1:17:32] flash
[1:17:32] and light up with those burst stones
[1:17:35] that are there
[1:17:37] right how much more is the testimony of
[1:17:40] the holy ghost
[1:17:41] in our life it should flash with the
[1:17:43] word
[1:17:45] it should be a flash with the word about
[1:17:48] what god has spoken
[1:17:50] he is manifesting
[1:17:53] oh glory this is why remember with jesus
[1:17:57] when he would stand
[1:17:58] there he says you called them gods whom
[1:18:00] the word of the lord come to
[1:18:02] prophets receive the word of the lord
[1:18:08] jesus said my sheep they know my voice i
[1:18:11] want you to listen to this here
[1:18:14] the brahmana says if the voice is that a
[1:18:16] voice of the sign if the voice come
[1:18:19] the same old voice he said you see a
[1:18:22] sign rather and that sign that the man
[1:18:24] is doing is the same old school of
[1:18:25] thought
[1:18:26] then you can say right then that didn't
[1:18:28] come from god
[1:18:31] if it's the same old school of thought
[1:18:33] if it keeps identifying the same old
[1:18:35] school of thought it never did it never
[1:18:37] has
[1:18:38] it would be against god's program
[1:18:42] i don't care how much a man can have
[1:18:44] signs and wonders in his ministry
[1:18:47] but if he denies the word of god
[1:18:51] and he holds the same old voice
[1:18:55] of ideas from the past that have been
[1:18:57] presumptive idols
[1:19:00] god didn't send it there can be
[1:19:03] devils cast out sick that are healed but
[1:19:06] remember
[1:19:07] that's their stock they stock their
[1:19:09] livelihood in that
[1:19:11] did we not cast how devils in thy name
[1:19:14] have we not preached in thy name
[1:19:15] prophesied in thy name
[1:19:17] you see they are relying on the gift
[1:19:20] in their life instead of the word
[1:19:23] testifying of them
[1:19:26] that's why god had to send a message in
[1:19:28] this hour
[1:19:29] it was not a new something different
[1:19:33] but it was to tie us back in to the
[1:19:36] faith
[1:19:36] of the apostolic fathers that our hearts
[1:19:40] would be
[1:19:40] anchored brother we would know where
[1:19:44] we're standing
[1:19:48] hallelujah oh i feel like preaching
[1:19:52] it's listen to this this and this let me
[1:19:54] just let me just speak on this a little
[1:19:56] bit
[1:19:57] it's got to be something new let me just
[1:19:59] keep reading here it's got to be
[1:20:00] something new
[1:20:01] it's got to be something that the people
[1:20:03] don't understand or it wouldn't be sent
[1:20:06] it don't need to be sent it's the same
[1:20:08] old school theology it's got to be
[1:20:09] something different
[1:20:10] yet it's got to be identified in the
[1:20:13] word
[1:20:14] that it is for that day the positives of
[1:20:16] god's word it has to be that
[1:20:18] there's no slip ups to it it's got to be
[1:20:20] the truth got to be vindicated by god
[1:20:22] the truth
[1:20:23] and the man who speaks it has to be
[1:20:25] vindicated of god
[1:20:27] to be a seer from god or it's wrong
[1:20:30] and they don't even see it at all don't
[1:20:32] even believe it
[1:20:38] god vindicated thoroughly
[1:20:42] this ministry of malachi 4.
[1:20:48] all these other false prophets and these
[1:20:50] liars are saying
[1:20:51] oh this and that and this and that
[1:20:54] where's your vindication in the word
[1:20:57] don't just show me signs and wonders
[1:20:58] show me vindication in the world
[1:21:00] show me live that are transformed by the
[1:21:03] power of god
[1:21:04] that are placed and identified and
[1:21:06] connected with jesus christ
[1:21:10] because a false prophet will take a gift
[1:21:11] and try to bind people to himself
[1:21:15] and bangs them under fear but the spirit
[1:21:16] of god will come through the word and
[1:21:18] guide people into the true atonement
[1:21:21] which brings peace
[1:21:26] oh glory be to god in the highest signs
[1:21:30] are from god
[1:21:31] the signs that follow the voice that
[1:21:33] follows the sign
[1:21:34] must be the voice of god speaking from
[1:21:36] the word for that age
[1:21:38] god gives signs what does he do it for
[1:21:41] always give signs
[1:21:43] he told them that that's what they'd
[1:21:45] look for in him the signs
[1:21:47] god gives signs listen now to attract
[1:21:50] the attention of his people
[1:21:54] he said let's study this thoroughly
[1:21:55] signs are given to attract the attention
[1:21:57] of the people
[1:21:58] because when a god-sent sign is given
[1:22:01] god is ready to speak
[1:22:03] god is ready to speak when the sign is
[1:22:05] given if it comes from heaven it's from
[1:22:07] god and god is ready to speak
[1:22:09] he's trying to attract the people's
[1:22:11] attention
[1:22:12] there's a purpose god's not showing off
[1:22:16] it's a purpose and the word comes to his
[1:22:20] prophet and the prophet is identified by
[1:22:23] the sign that he shows
[1:22:25] and then he comes to the word and the
[1:22:26] word is made manifest that settles it
[1:22:28] it don't need any interpretation god has
[1:22:30] already interpreted
[1:22:31] it's just as perfect as it can be now
[1:22:34] the bible says
[1:22:36] in hebrews 1 1 god who at sunder at
[1:22:40] times and it
[1:22:41] divers manners spake in times past unto
[1:22:43] the
[1:22:44] fathers in the prophets by the prophets
[1:22:48] hath in these last days spoken unto us
[1:22:49] by his son whom he hath appointed the
[1:22:51] heir of all things
[1:22:52] by whom also he made the worlds now
[1:22:55] notice
[1:22:56] in second peter chapter 1 verse 20
[1:22:59] see it was god's pattern speaking in his
[1:23:02] prophets
[1:23:03] noting knowing this first that no
[1:23:05] prophecy
[1:23:06] of the scripture is of any private
[1:23:09] interpretation
[1:23:10] for the prophecy came not in old time
[1:23:13] by the will of man but holy men of god
[1:23:17] spake as they were moved by the holy
[1:23:20] ghost
[1:23:21] think of the humility amos said i'm not
[1:23:23] a prophet nor am i the son of a prophet
[1:23:26] it was humility they were not vouching
[1:23:29] for
[1:23:29] positions oh
[1:23:33] think when the fountain shall be opened
[1:23:34] in the house of david the bible says in
[1:23:36] the book of zechariah
[1:23:38] those that are wearing that mantle cloth
[1:23:40] of a prophet will take it off and say
[1:23:41] i'm no prophet
[1:23:42] why they recognize that there's only
[1:23:47] they're one in humility to lay down it
[1:23:49] says to cast aside
[1:23:51] their idols and their lies and all those
[1:23:53] things why they're in the presence
[1:23:55] of the living god amen
[1:23:58] in the wonderful what the fountain does
[1:24:00] open in the house of david here
[1:24:02] it allows us to cast off all of those
[1:24:05] things
[1:24:05] like i used to have this idea about
[1:24:07] heaven i used to think when we got to
[1:24:09] heaven we were like this it allows us to
[1:24:12] cast it off
[1:24:14] why it's a fountain that's open in the
[1:24:16] house of david
[1:24:18] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:24:23] holy men spake as they were move caught
[1:24:26] up
[1:24:26] from one place to another by the holy
[1:24:30] ghost
[1:24:36] let me just refer to this because i
[1:24:37] don't have the time to just yeah i want
[1:24:39] to read it but
[1:24:42] this is why brother branham he'll go in
[1:24:43] he said god likened his prophets to an
[1:24:45] eagle
[1:24:49] now god he says notice he says in the
[1:24:51] impersonation of christianity god
[1:24:53] likened the prophet to the eagle
[1:24:55] that would go in the makeup of a prophet
[1:24:58] he's a seer
[1:24:59] that in the spirit he climbs beyond the
[1:25:01] emotion of the church
[1:25:02] he goes beyond the rhythm of the music
[1:25:05] he goes beyond the clapping of the hands
[1:25:07] he goes beyond the joy among the saints
[1:25:10] he goes beyond all that
[1:25:12] god brings him up into a realm alone
[1:25:16] alone then he opens his eyes
[1:25:19] and he lets him look around and see
[1:25:21] things that is to come
[1:25:23] then he brings him back down among the
[1:25:25] members of the body
[1:25:26] to foretell them of what's in the making
[1:25:29] he said see
[1:25:30] how god took ezekiel high up he said a
[1:25:33] prophet is also a gift of knowledge
[1:25:34] look at this a knowledge is like an
[1:25:37] attorney
[1:25:38] who studies the books and when you go to
[1:25:40] hire an attorney to plead your case he's
[1:25:42] only taking what he knows
[1:25:45] and you're paying for what he knows to
[1:25:47] present your case before the judge
[1:25:49] aren't you glad that we're not under a
[1:25:52] guess so
[1:25:56] this is not a guess so brother this
[1:25:58] right here
[1:25:59] here he who was a judge become our
[1:26:02] attorney
[1:26:03] and that same one is revealed in the
[1:26:05] prophetic ministry to do what establish
[1:26:08] us that we can know where we're standing
[1:26:13] glory be to god it's a spirit of truth
[1:26:17] now bill graham says then now watch this
[1:26:19] statement he says then the word that god
[1:26:21] has spoken
[1:26:22] before the foundation of the world it
[1:26:24] isn't that god
[1:26:26] speaks and says something to the prophet
[1:26:29] at that time
[1:26:30] it is that the prophet catches what god
[1:26:33] has already said did you catch what he
[1:26:35] said he said it isn't that god is
[1:26:37] speaking to that prophet right then
[1:26:39] it's god is catching that prophet up
[1:26:42] into what he has already
[1:26:43] said for the word was before the
[1:26:47] foundation of the world
[1:26:49] god spoke the word and it's laying way
[1:26:52] out stretched out in time
[1:26:54] and the prophet goes up and sees the
[1:26:56] time coming see it's only a gift of
[1:26:57] knowledge that he brings down and puts
[1:26:59] it on paper
[1:27:00] she's going up jacob's ladder here
[1:27:03] now notice he talks about isaiah isaiah
[1:27:06] you know he he foreseen these things
[1:27:08] before the foundation of the world
[1:27:09] let me go here you know uh and sirs we
[1:27:12] would see jesus
[1:27:13] he said now the bible is just a prophet
[1:27:15] too by a gift of knowledge
[1:27:17] foresaw what god spoke
[1:27:20] before the foundation of the world think
[1:27:24] how beautiful
[1:27:25] before the foundation of the world god
[1:27:26] spoke these words
[1:27:28] he looked and as he seen the great on
[1:27:30] coming he seemed would have taken place
[1:27:32] look when isaiah isaiah is lifted up
[1:27:36] out of his senses and isaiah in isaiah
[1:27:38] 53
[1:27:39] you notice through the book of isaiah
[1:27:41] isaiah will be prophesying
[1:27:42] he'll be declaring things present then
[1:27:45] he'll move over
[1:27:47] into the path taking us clear back into
[1:27:49] the mind of god
[1:27:50] and in isaiah 53 he never writes of the
[1:27:54] coming
[1:27:54] of the lord jesus as something that will
[1:27:58] be
[1:27:58] but he says he was bruised
[1:28:02] why it's all it's there he's not
[1:28:05] something new being spoken
[1:28:07] god catches the prophet out into the
[1:28:09] word
[1:28:10] the word is not kind the word is eternal
[1:28:15] and the prophet is seeing what god has
[1:28:18] already spoke
[1:28:22] hallelujah it's not wire but it becomes
[1:28:24] vision
[1:28:26] and then the prophet receives that and
[1:28:28] he comes back down and we are blessed
[1:28:31] so we come under the vision of the word
[1:28:37] no wonder isaiah said after he was
[1:28:40] separated from uzziah
[1:28:42] isaiah passed away he says
[1:28:46] i was i was there in the temple
[1:28:49] i saw the lord and his train high and
[1:28:52] lifted up
[1:28:54] see he got separated then he began to
[1:28:56] see things
[1:28:58] that he was ordained to see listen to me
[1:29:00] in order to see the things that you
[1:29:02] ordained to see you've got to separate
[1:29:06] god has to allow things to separate and
[1:29:09] you notice
[1:29:09] as we in our lives the separation
[1:29:11] continues to come what's god doing
[1:29:13] it's all the plan and program of god
[1:29:15] that he might reveal himself
[1:29:17] more to us
[1:29:20] think of ezekiel ezekiel could talk
[1:29:23] about the hand of the lord that's upon
[1:29:24] me
[1:29:25] he picked me up by a lock of my hair he
[1:29:27] carried me in the spirit
[1:29:28] he transported me here ezekiel didn't do
[1:29:30] that he did not have the power
[1:29:32] to lift himself up but god who called
[1:29:36] him to be a prophet
[1:29:37] was there to lift the prophet up
[1:29:40] and the same god who has ordained you to
[1:29:43] be the bright is here to lift you up
[1:29:46] he's here to lift you up into those
[1:29:48] realms of where you belong
[1:29:50] amen no wonder paul could say that we
[1:29:53] were
[1:29:54] we we are blessings spiritual blessings
[1:29:57] and heavenly places what he was caught
[1:29:59] up and what's he do
[1:30:00] he brings that vision of the word back
[1:30:02] to you and i what does it do it lifts us
[1:30:05] up
[1:30:06] oh glory oh blessed be the name of the
[1:30:10] lord you love him
[1:30:13] so the prophet he's able to see the
[1:30:16] unseen realm
[1:30:18] the others are looking just at the word
[1:30:19] remember brother brown says they're
[1:30:21] looking at the word he says
[1:30:23] they're packing the word along and
[1:30:24] they're saying we're a christian nation
[1:30:26] we believe the lord
[1:30:27] we believe the lord we've got his
[1:30:28] prophets and he said they claim we
[1:30:29] believe the bible he said and they don't
[1:30:31] recognize they don't
[1:30:34] they despise it because they despise the
[1:30:36] spirit of the lord
[1:30:39] is that right now notice when god sends
[1:30:42] that word
[1:30:43] to a prophet what does it do it becomes
[1:30:47] that
[1:30:48] to establish the hearts of the people
[1:30:52] and the blessed assurance of the living
[1:30:55] god
[1:30:56] by living revelation let me just
[1:30:59] say it like this how god
[1:31:03] would sinned in this hour there was a
[1:31:06] need
[1:31:07] we could probably talk to all of
[1:31:09] christendom talk to a lot and say
[1:31:15] right do you believe jesus is the son of
[1:31:16] god yes i sure do
[1:31:18] and they can say hey man i believe that
[1:31:20] i believe he's the son of god
[1:31:21] but you see
[1:31:25] in order when you're shooting a gun or a
[1:31:27] bow or whatever if you're off
[1:31:28] at a short distance further down the
[1:31:32] line you're really going to be off
[1:31:34] so you got to get zeroed in in order to
[1:31:36] hit it at the judgment
[1:31:38] are you with me you got to get zeroed in
[1:31:40] right now
[1:31:41] and this is why god had to send eyes
[1:31:44] in this generation because yes there was
[1:31:48] a portrait of jesus but it was leaving
[1:31:50] people in sin
[1:31:53] it was teaching another jesus
[1:31:56] but god had eyes in this hour and it
[1:31:59] catches up and what does it do
[1:32:01] it's calling the attention from the
[1:32:03] church look away to jesus
[1:32:06] look away to jesus look unto jesus
[1:32:09] the author to finish your faith and what
[1:32:11] do you see you see a living lord jesus
[1:32:14] the same one that he changed lives back
[1:32:16] there in his same power
[1:32:18] you see that same living god that
[1:32:20] there's no way
[1:32:21] we could ever do away with our leopard
[1:32:24] spots but there had to be one
[1:32:26] that could stand in the gap for you and
[1:32:28] i that could make up where we lack
[1:32:30] that can transform our lives there's
[1:32:32] only one thing that can do that
[1:32:34] and that is the blood of jesus christ
[1:32:37] and the holy spirit comes back
[1:32:39] to witness you were included
[1:32:44] hallelujah
[1:32:49] this is what catching up does can i have
[1:32:51] just a few more moments
[1:32:53] this is what catching up does this is
[1:32:55] what a prophetic ministry does
[1:32:57] it catches you from where you are
[1:33:00] over into what god has already seen you
[1:33:02] to be
[1:33:04] you're with me when the prophet is
[1:33:06] caught up and this message is being
[1:33:08] preached
[1:33:08] brother remember it's not of things that
[1:33:11] god is saying it's what god
[1:33:12] has already said and when god has spoken
[1:33:15] to your heart personally
[1:33:16] what's god letting you know that you are
[1:33:19] always in my mind
[1:33:20] you always were a part of me hallelujah
[1:33:23] i
[1:33:24] never lost sight of you and this word
[1:33:27] comes to do what
[1:33:28] lift you brother without this word we'd
[1:33:32] still be in a valley
[1:33:33] of dry bones but the word of the lord
[1:33:38] has come to bring us together in the
[1:33:41] prophecy
[1:33:42] uniting with the word and put life into
[1:33:45] us
[1:33:49] that's what a prophetic ministry does
[1:33:54] god promised
[1:33:59] it's like samuel and david the bible
[1:34:02] says
[1:34:05] for samuel 3 21 the lord appeared again
[1:34:07] in shiloh
[1:34:08] for the lord revealed himself to samuel
[1:34:11] in shiloh
[1:34:12] by the word of the lord
[1:34:17] samuel was the one they rejected
[1:34:22] he felt the rejection but it was
[1:34:24] actually god they rejected
[1:34:28] while the rest were rejecting god had a
[1:34:31] little boy down there
[1:34:34] and was out minding his own business
[1:34:35] tending the sheep
[1:34:38] little did he know he was gonna have a
[1:34:41] personal visitation one day
[1:34:45] samuel said how am i going to go down
[1:34:47] there saul's going to kill me
[1:34:49] how do i get this message down there he
[1:34:51] said go
[1:34:52] under the secret of the sacrifice
[1:34:56] bring the sacrifice say i'm going to
[1:34:58] sacrifice at the house of jesse
[1:35:00] you see it comes back to the true
[1:35:02] atonement
[1:35:03] he comes down to the house of jesse they
[1:35:06] offer sacrifice
[1:35:07] every one of those seven sons come
[1:35:08] before and samuel surely this is the one
[1:35:10] god said no no
[1:35:14] no he comes at 7-1 lord
[1:35:18] they're all here no no no no no
[1:35:21] your message is going to reach beyond
[1:35:22] what you see right now
[1:35:27] is these all your sons nope
[1:35:31] he said there's one out in the field
[1:35:33] don't call him we ain't
[1:35:34] we are not sitting down till he gets
[1:35:36] here
[1:35:37] oh brother this word is going on this
[1:35:40] word there's no
[1:35:41] setting down brother there's an
[1:35:43] anointing of the word
[1:35:44] that is poured out upon our life he
[1:35:47] raised david
[1:35:48] david was a shepherd he never lost that
[1:35:51] that of what god had brought him from
[1:35:53] think of it
[1:35:55] and god raised him to be king
[1:36:00] what did that a prophet under the word
[1:36:03] of the lord whom the word had been
[1:36:04] revealed to
[1:36:05] now the word that god spoke concerning
[1:36:07] david was poured out in anointing upon
[1:36:09] his life
[1:36:11] and that anointing upon his life
[1:36:13] remember his conduct
[1:36:14] his conduct his conduct his character is
[1:36:17] what saul said
[1:36:18] i know thou art the next king he had a
[1:36:21] character that was
[1:36:22] fit for millennium reign
[1:36:26] it's anointing of the word oh my second
[1:36:29] corinthians 20 20.
[1:36:31] my i asked for a few more moments i
[1:36:35] some of you probably like hey you do
[1:36:37] that all the time notice what
[1:36:39] jehoshaphat said i i love the scripture
[1:36:41] when they are in besiegement
[1:36:44] he says believe the last part of that
[1:36:46] verse believe in the lord your god
[1:36:48] so shall you be established believe his
[1:36:52] prophets
[1:36:53] soul shall you prosper
[1:36:57] hey we're like hazel
[1:37:04] what's going on oh oh my goodness
[1:37:07] look what's surrounding us elisha gets
[1:37:11] up
[1:37:12] knocks or maybe you don't know
[1:37:16] but he says there's more with us
[1:37:20] than there is against us why
[1:37:23] he's anchored to that unseen realm
[1:37:28] the unseen realm has made the written
[1:37:31] word alive to him
[1:37:35] to where he'll stand on the promise of
[1:37:38] what god spoke through david the angel
[1:37:41] of the lord is encamped around them fear
[1:37:44] him and love him
[1:37:46] you see once god's been made real
[1:37:48] brother aaron it don't matter what
[1:37:49] promise
[1:37:50] what need you have you can stand upon
[1:37:52] that word because the same god who has
[1:37:54] made himself real
[1:37:55] in your life is the word he's the all of
[1:37:58] it
[1:38:01] my i'm wearing y'all
[1:38:04] let's stand
[1:38:18] it stabilizes us in this hour
[1:38:22] it drives our fear this is why
[1:38:27] john 3 jesus said a man
[1:38:30] must be born again it raises us into a
[1:38:33] realm
[1:38:35] that we've only heard about
[1:38:40] it raises us into a realm where brother
[1:38:42] graham says
[1:38:43] we've only been bumping into
[1:38:47] but now what when god moves
[1:38:51] see the eyes of the heart become through
[1:38:54] the baptism of the holy ghost a new
[1:38:56] birth it raises into that realm
[1:38:59] into god's program and here we are
[1:39:03] we're in this world but we're not of
[1:39:06] this world
[1:39:08] we're walking in two different worlds
[1:39:13] we're affected by the world
[1:39:16] of our rebirth our new birth
[1:39:20] but here we are still walking in this
[1:39:22] world have to contend with the things
[1:39:25] around us
[1:39:26] have to take care cares of life
[1:39:29] things that are all around us now listen
[1:39:32] everything that god has entrusted to
[1:39:34] your care
[1:39:34] husband wife children job all those
[1:39:37] things like that
[1:39:38] not of things of this world remember
[1:39:40] paul would say using this world is not
[1:39:41] abusing it
[1:39:43] so it would show that there's things
[1:39:44] that we have to do things that we have
[1:39:46] to give care to
[1:39:47] things that we have to tend to paul when
[1:39:49] he would write that in the book of
[1:39:51] corinthians when he would talk about
[1:39:52] he that is she that is unmarried care
[1:39:54] for the things of the world or of the
[1:39:56] lord
[1:39:56] she that is married cared for the things
[1:39:58] that's of of the of the world he's not
[1:40:00] saying somebody becomes a sinner
[1:40:02] they become worldly he's dealing with
[1:40:04] that all of these things that there's
[1:40:05] more
[1:40:06] cares that we have if you yourself do
[1:40:09] not care
[1:40:10] for your spouse you don't care for your
[1:40:12] job if you go about with an attitude
[1:40:14] you know i don't care what happens
[1:40:16] remember listen to me very carefully
[1:40:18] that's not an attitude according to
[1:40:20] god's word
[1:40:21] why because he cares i said he cares
[1:40:25] jesus cares what kind of product he puts
[1:40:28] out at the factory
[1:40:29] jesus cares what kind of work he does at
[1:40:31] the nursing home
[1:40:32] jesus cares what kind of work he does at
[1:40:34] the sanitation jesus
[1:40:36] cares on the accounts jesus cares
[1:40:40] he cares on the notre he cares
[1:40:43] see this is something that for the the
[1:40:45] of of the believer
[1:40:47] it's not a i don't care that's not our
[1:40:49] attitude why
[1:40:50] spiritually spiritually god has dealt
[1:40:53] with our heart
[1:40:54] to let us know in this hour i care
[1:40:56] enough about you
[1:40:58] i send you a message i send you a place
[1:41:02] of escape
[1:41:03] you know what that does it moves on our
[1:41:04] heart he cares
[1:41:06] do you care and then the response to
[1:41:09] that care
[1:41:11] it moves throughout our lives oh sure
[1:41:14] it's
[1:41:15] there's not one of us we don't like to
[1:41:18] walk out into those other realms after
[1:41:20] you leave out of a service
[1:41:22] come out of a sunday service sometimes
[1:41:24] in your mind you're thinking
[1:41:25] here comes monday don't don't dread it
[1:41:28] remember
[1:41:28] what god does for you in these moments
[1:41:31] and these
[1:41:32] times just like in your personal times
[1:41:34] of devotion in your prayer closet no
[1:41:36] doubt there's times
[1:41:37] that you study in the word of god
[1:41:39] there's times you're listening to a
[1:41:40] message
[1:41:40] and there's things that you'll hear and
[1:41:42] you're thinking man and like i never
[1:41:44] heard this before and you just get such
[1:41:45] a blessing
[1:41:46] listen don't look don't let the devil
[1:41:48] take you and say oh but you've got to do
[1:41:50] this later in the day no
[1:41:52] know that god has spoke to you
[1:41:54] personally to strengthen you
[1:41:56] because he knows what's coming later in
[1:41:57] the day you look to the same god who
[1:42:00] would speak to you in that manner he'll
[1:42:01] give you direction even when it comes to
[1:42:03] cooking dinner
[1:42:04] even when it comes to getting the
[1:42:05] children around even when it comes to
[1:42:07] taking care of the insurance
[1:42:09] no matter what it is he's in control
[1:42:12] as believers we are aware that we're not
[1:42:15] walking
[1:42:16] by natural means sure there's natural
[1:42:19] things that we have to attend to
[1:42:21] we're not so heavenly minded that we're
[1:42:23] not any earthly good
[1:42:25] but by god's grace there's a spirit of
[1:42:27] god within us
[1:42:29] it alerts us i'm not of this world
[1:42:32] yes there's things that i have to attend
[1:42:34] to but this is not my home
[1:42:36] this is not what i'm tied to you realize
[1:42:39] this is not who i am
[1:42:42] this word that god has sent
[1:42:45] it's no longer just looking at writing
[1:42:48] on a page
[1:42:49] oh i remember that i remember that as a
[1:42:52] young boy
[1:42:54] i remember that i remember reading
[1:42:57] trying to read the message trying to
[1:42:58] read the scripture i remember that
[1:43:00] i remember hearing though but i also
[1:43:03] remember
[1:43:05] when he drew me to himself
[1:43:09] i remember the grace that he gave me to
[1:43:11] surrender my life
[1:43:13] and i remember his grace that filled me
[1:43:16] with my eyes become illuminated
[1:43:20] this was no longer the message of my mom
[1:43:23] and my daddy
[1:43:25] this was my message
[1:43:28] this is me that i saw in the mirror i
[1:43:31] saw me
[1:43:32] i seen me that's what it did that's what
[1:43:36] this message did it picks picks us up
[1:43:41] and it lets us see who we really are
[1:43:45] you see not just some other theology you
[1:43:48] know how it is when people say
[1:43:49] what are you where do you go to church
[1:43:50] what are are you methodists are you
[1:43:52] baptist say
[1:43:52] i'm a christian you're a what i'm a
[1:43:55] christian
[1:43:57] oh yeah i'm a believer i'm a believer
[1:44:01] i believe every i believe god i believe
[1:44:04] he's the same yesterday
[1:44:06] today and forever i believe he still
[1:44:08] gives the holy ghost
[1:44:10] i believe he still heals i believe he
[1:44:13] still sets free
[1:44:14] i'm a believer i believe he's still
[1:44:18] god of his word i believe he's god and
[1:44:22] his people
[1:44:24] and begin to look at you what what's
[1:44:26] going on what's different
[1:44:27] but you recognize god's grace
[1:44:31] not you ezekiel not you isaiah
[1:44:34] but god by his spirit as john could say
[1:44:38] the spirit carried me away
[1:44:43] one of these mornings brother brian as
[1:44:45] he's been carrying us
[1:44:47] away and showing us things we said god
[1:44:52] thank you for opening my eyes thank you
[1:44:54] for turning my heart
[1:44:57] one of these days the same holy ghost
[1:45:00] that's carried us away from death and to
[1:45:03] life
[1:45:04] that's carried us away from glory unto
[1:45:07] glory
[1:45:08] one of these days it'll be the last day
[1:45:12] and will be carried carried home
[1:45:17] will be changed in a moment and a
[1:45:19] twinkling of an eye
[1:45:20] or it won't be a hard thing it'll be a
[1:45:23] step
[1:45:24] just like you're making steps right now
[1:45:26] it'll be another step
[1:45:28] what should i do keep walking enoch
[1:45:31] keep having a testimony that's pleasing
[1:45:34] god

[1:46:57] who will lift their life
[1:47:00] out of all of that which satan is trying
[1:47:03] to pour on them
