brother bill back here with us amen and joey amen different ones good to see you brother josh and says john mariah yeah my it's just good to be it's good to be together you know i think of many of those these times that we you look at and [Music] you know you you we we look at it in terms of that we know that even this gathering here this morning we can't even expect that this gathering would be the same next week next month or next year there's others that's gone on home to be with the lord and these are things that even with that right here we certainly want to take the the most of every opportunity it's pretty incredible how brother branham would bring it in the message feast of the trumpets and he's just he's dealing with all those spirits that have been released and you know satan can't he cannot um stop the program of god he'll do all he can to try to hinder it but everything god has it there's a junction and that junction will be met it's just like everything in our life there's a there's everything and what's to be fulfilled the purpose the everything within that right there and there's nothing can take us before that purpose is done nothing as a matter of fact brother brandon would say just like this he said when god's through with me here i'm ready to go how could he say that because christ was his everything while he was here every part of his life it was revolved around jesus christ i'll tell you what a [Music] what a testimony when you go back and you know we have little bits and pieces on and i say bits and pieces on tape when you go through and you listen to the supernatural series and how brother owen jurgensen wrote that out and you listen to the very beginnings there you realize that here the vessel that god used in this hour was just like you and i and what i mean is is that you find one he was running from god as a matter of fact when they even referred to him one of his buddies referred to him as you look like a preacher billy in that suit he was ready to fight him [Music] but you see what what's awesome about that is because down beneath all of that darkness see that was confusion that's where our lives were at let me just say it's very clearly you might have said and said in a message church and it's not the message that's brought confusion but the light itself comes to bring break us out of that chaos we were born into because our first birth is chaos but when you can receive that overcoming power on the inside then it brings order to your life then it brings clarity then it brings fruit then it brings all this is this is what i have longed for he is my everything amen you know i want to just mention here i want to have uh brother dave senior and i'm going to ask brother brian to give their just testimonies here briefly are what they wanted to say concerning the men's meeting and then i have just another announcement be sure i know some of you don't have emails some of you do and some of you do and you don't check it and and some people they some some people check it and then you know after announcements and things like this and people say hey what about this and what about that you better be careful you're giving yourself away because if you're not paying attention then i know whether you're not streaming or not hello somebody because if you're asking things that's already been covered then we we know so i want to just uh invite to maybe we can have brother dave senior have him come first and then we'll have brother brian where's this microphone here we go get this one i don't like those corded things are we there we are i don't get any i'm not getting no signal there we go thank you come on over this way i bless you i'm just a little nervous but i'll try i i thought a psalm that come to me the meetings i can't quote it psalms 133 he said how good he is for brethren to be well together in unity it's like the precious snoring all on eric's head that run down his beard to the helm of his garment and i thought that was a good scripture right there to describe those meetings and i'll have to say to begin with i was i was battling infection and it really was a battle and i i know david was over the house one day and i just tell him i said dave pray for me is this really a battle here and he said dad he said i'm praying for you but he said i wonder sometimes if it isn't the devil trying to take a blessing away from you and so i got to thinking of that and you know brother adam said god's put something on your heart you know satan bought value but go ahead and do it anyway and sometimes we have to make a sacrifice and i certainly can tell you i got up that morning and boy it was battling me so bad and i told shelly i said honey i just don't think i can go this is hurting so bad it's so hard and i got to thinking about what he said and i know the lord you know thinking of on his word and i said you know what i'll just try to start getting ready here and see how it goes and the time i got ready i text dave and said i'm ready to go so the grace of god and we had wonderful fellowship down there and i got to say too we got into service and the brothers started singing and everyone that that just kind of faded away you know i was my body was still giving me a battle but that didn't make any difference there and the word was precious and it challenged me we just take that in our hearts you know i'm an old man i've been this this way 53 years but you know what that word's still precious he's still working on us he's not done with us yet we're not there but we're on our way and i and that i left there i was blessed i was challenged to be a better husband a better daddy a better brother to my brothers and sisters and certainly closer to my lord and more sincere and all that i do brothers sisters we only got going to pass this way one time we only got this one time serving we want to do our best to give him all our praise and our love and our hearts he gave everything for us we owe him everything and i love him with all my being and the more i know of him the more i love him and you know i think of what apostle paul said too let us run this race with patience looking to the author and finish of our faith and our lord jesus christ he that we're going to good work in us he will finish it we know that and i was telling sister browning out there in the vestview one day and as an army we had to we had to run a mile it was just part of your training and i was a young soldier and strong and we we started out and well i had a head of steam i was so strong and i'm running and i'm running and i'm getting them down the track and i'm getting tired and i'm paying for breath and i'm keeping going i mean but you know what it got to the place i just couldn't hardly get my breath my legs was numb but you know what i could see the finish line oh my god you know what we're in this battle i know the world's going darker yeah you know what we need all the help we get but hate it the gun is working us you see it's and i can see the finish line brothers and sisters we're newer than we've ever been we're close to that shore so i just encourage you brothers if god carries another year if you can you know try to make those meetings i'll tell you what i come a really glad and was blessed and was so glad that i did god bless you i want to say one other thing in that that the brothers were so kind to me talking about brotherly love i can and little things like experience that there where they they would help me out of the vehicle and just give me a hand and brother sammy we go out of his way to to take us up that hill to the meeting and normally i could have climbed up with no problem but you know what i was really thankful that just just the love of god and that just such a blessing to me well i'll tell you he sat in the front by me on the way down and so what i did was i just and i listened i thought i'm i'm i'm in the presence of a of an old oak tree so i just i just sat here i wanted to listen and we had a good fellowship and and of course these guys in the back brother dave junior and brother brian and brother drake my goodness they had i know they had a good fellowship it was fellowshipping all the way all the way down and all the way back and you know i just trying to focus on the road but i just i really appreciate brother dave you know because what it is is you can see over the time as brother dave there's just been a life that has just been lived and i just so appreciate that and you we just really really appreciate brother dave and i thought of him when i was in the middle of ministering the the second part there in their services and i thought of brother dave i actually was going to have brother dave and i think his brother jim crook from brother paul's and because there was a few other brothers there that i i know that they've had their lives it's just been all the way through the years and i thought what a testimony and what an encouragement that is to us because i consider myself a young man i know i only look about a few days beyond 17 but i'm still i'm a young man so i'd like to have brother brian come but in reality some of you probably don't know this this is my dad now some of you are looking in there well come over here stand next to me now if you want to know how that happened after i finished speaking the second time there you had a brother that that thought that this was my dad he says that's your son so after that just like the other day i texted him said happy birthday dad i know this is no place for jokes but it's okay i said it's okay our hearts are in in in the right place but so i just i really appreciated that you know so i guess i look younger it's just how it is all right thanks for the sam appreciate that brother chris uh and then speaking that yeah you can tell the family resemblance obviously you know we're so similar you know but yeah we uh i've i wanted to say brother cress was right about that hill we we me and brother dave and uh brother drake walked up that hill man that hill is no joke from the uh from the the mess hall up to the um up to the church it's a it's a bit of a hike but uh i just want to say i i'm i'm a bit of a i'm a bit of you probably can't tell by me being up here um i am a bit of an introvert which means usually you know i'm around people for a little bit and then i need a little bit of me time you know a little bit of private time you don't have to worry about any of that because when you're there there is no there is no down time so you don't have to worry about but what i'm trying to say is it didn't it didn't bother me you know sometimes i like to get off by myself but it was really wonderful that the presence of the lord there was so great from like everything we were doing you know it was like everything just kind of flowed from from from one event to the other and then they weren't kidding we did have seven seven full sessions we had that was that was six services and and and one uh sort of seminar from brother brother coffee's son and uh and that's not full blown church services with full song services and everything or that we wouldn't had nearly enough time um but the good the thing was they feed you constantly the whole time you're there it's it's we arrived and we ate and then we went to church and then we ate and then we went to bed and we woke up and we ate and then we went to church and we ate and then we had another then we ate and then we were kind of joking how many knows what a pavlovian response is the uh the dog you know they'd ring the bell and then the dog would start salivating because he associated i was like now every time every time we go to church and hear a sermon we're going to be like where's the food where's the food somebody bring out the somebody bring out the snacks yeah yeah it was it was good it was good food some people were saying oh cafeteria food hey for me it's just food it's just fine i mean you can tell from me i'm not too picky um but uh the one the one one thing i really liked was when we went into church like it was there was lots of brothers there but like everybody was singing it was it was almost like a man it was like i was in a men's choir almost i mean it was just voices were just blasting out every brother were singing for two brothers i mean it was it was wonderful oh my fortress is you know just so powerful it was so wonderful to be there and then the presence of the lord was just there from the very beginning all the way through um but everybody didn't get too super spiritual it was it was really kind of funny because we were having a great song service and brother brother fontaine and brother uh brother jack duff were up there singing those brothers can sing man there was it was wonderful and now some brother fontaine's like and we sang and singing and singing and singing let's sing one more song but the jack duff said let's eat let's eat it's it was it was a little past lunch time but everyone was so involved in it it was wonderful and i always say whenever i hear a good sermon whenever i hear a good service you know a good word from the lord i always wish i had like at least six months to go live that out because it's just so you know jam-packed i just lord just i think about six months to get that right and then we'll have another having their service but you we had like six six full-blown sermons and i was like that's like three years of materials and we'll be back here before that so i just say lord we're gonna have to compress that down a little bit help me live that out um but it was wonderful fellowship in the van and on the retreat and as with the samuel saying we met these brothers from africa uh brother aaron and brother caleb and uh yeah the brother was like hey brother i just wanted you to know i was really impressed with your son's sermon today you know because it was so good i was like my uh my son said yes yes mother samuel wonderful wonderful brother we really appreciate him and i said oh it's the beard and i explained it to him said oh brother i can never tell how old white people are i'm sorry i can't i can't so i was like the beard probably didn't help you know that probably confused me anymore but uh the the great thing was like there was a there was a there was a there was a theme all the way through it and i know the brothers didn't get together beforehand and and coordinate it but the theme to me was you know recognizing your authority as a son of god and what god's called you to be in this day and then how to use it properly i mean it was it was so and brother david drake you guys can you know it was it was it was just so it helped me like refocus like you know obviously the word of the lord is always coming and we're always hearing these things but it was like it was so focused on that and it helped me get really focused on that you know to because i want to be a better husband i want to be a better father you know for my family and it was it was so inspiring to me and i i really feel like it's made a difference in my life since i came back and it was it really i just been inspired i've been seeking lord in prayer more and things and it's just you know it's not just that camp meeting feeling i don't think i think it's a difference it's made a difference in my life and you know i know brother samuels mentioned he'd love to get a big bus and take everybody down you know all the brothers down i would recommend if we you know if if you can next year definitely i like i said i was a little hesitant because you know but it it was it was just such a wonderful experience the whole time the trip down every service and all the way by the time it was over i was like i can't believe it's over already i can't believe we're going back to real life now you know but it was it was a really wonderful time and if anybody can uh get a chance to go next year i recommend you do it i really do amen god bless i want to also make a quick announcement here as well we know that with the untimely passing their brother roel soriano his family they've been they've been suffering greatly with grief and someone had asked about mailing cards to sister chichi his wife and condolence and sister kim my wife she spoke with his daughter about it and she thinks that would be a great tremendous help we've just tried we've just stayed in contact personally with them and just trying to encourage them through this this time and i know that you've continued to keep it in prayer as they come to your heart you know even if you're maybe you're on your way to job or you're on the job and it just drops you remember that just just take them before the lord in prayer that god will just be with them continue to comfort them and give them the strength that's needed as well as the direction for the the church and the assembly that's there and so what with that in mind i'd like to ask if all possible if any of you could be so kind as to write any testimonies or interactions that you had with our brother along with any pictures to share with him because he's been coming here brother oil has been coming here for over 20 years it's been this if he if you know they would have been able to come here this year uh it would have been 21 years so it'd be you don't know what that means and maybe perhaps you do i don't want to take anything away from anyone but it it means a lot just because number one you took that little bit of time you know brother brahm talks about when he's overseas he said he would buy his wife a little trinket okay and it was and he would bring that back and he would give it to his wife now it wasn't the trinket that sister meaty was blown away by it was the thought that he thought of her while he was away and that's when brother brown is dealing even with that part of it i think that's the thing that really it speaks to our hearts and our lives and sometimes we just get so we get caught up in life there's a lot of things in life itself but if you just could just take a little bit and we we would be happy uh to collect all the cards any digital pictures or testimonies and we'd like to send them all together because it's probably going to be about a month before they would even get uh that box we'd like to make it a memorial keepsake for this for sister chichi and and the girls we'd like to have any of the testimonies and digital pictures by next sunday so this went out on an email about was it two weeks ago or a week ago okay so just to remind you if you could just take that look through your pictures or if you have a testimony because brother rowell i tell you he brother noel just preached some masterpieces and i tell you what i i remember many of the services and one of them that i also remember i think was back in 2018 the last service he preached here was stewards of god's grace but he preached the service back in 2018 that to me it was phenomenal it's praying for the perfection of others and that was just it it just was tremendous there was a lot a lot of tremendous services and we appreciate the every gift that god sends us and so we just want to just continue to keep them in prayer as well and we just want to just look to the lord now amen maybe we could sing a song here as we'll stand and maybe change our position let's sing that song i need you lord i need you lord right now i know i took a little bit of time and i i trust that you'll be gracious with that let's just let's just really as we such a wonderful atmosphere here let's just just just focus right in now oh i need you lord i need you lord right now yes i need you lord i need you lord right now for i'll lift my hands and bow my knees and worship at your chrome for i need you lord i need you lord right now one more time oh i need you lord i need you lord right now oh i need you lord i need you lord right now oh i lift my hands and bow my knee and i worship at your throne for i need you lord oh i need you lord all right oh my let's sing it one more time now oh i need you lord i need you lord right now oh i need you lord i need you lord for i need you lord i need you lord right now amen let's just go before the throne of grace you have a need upon your heart just place it there before him heavenly father we thank you dear god for your mercy thank you for your goodness lord thank you for bringing us together lord in these times oh god thank you for making a way o god that we and ourselves lord could know the real joy and what life really is lord your loving kindness is better than life oh god lord we just invite you now lord as we turn our hearts to look into the word [Music] lord we just desire that you would come be the speaker in here here this morning may you move in a very special way god lord just let me step aside that you can take lord the gift that you placed in my life and lord jesus you would just come down lord and just use that gift lord to be able to minister lord to the needs lord what is calling and what's drawing lord in the hearts of your children lord this morning every one of us have a need lord we all desire more of you lord i pray father for every need lord that's upon the hearts of your people as we lord offer it up lord before you this morning we invite you lord that you'll come in a very personal way father just speak to our hearts now we ask him lord in the name of jesus christ amen amen god bless you this morning if you'll turn in your bibles with me i know brother brian mentioned he's the process he's working on right now and some things what he was dealing what he's mentioning it didn't allow us to get wouldn't allow us because everything all the way that transfer the notes that's all tied in uh with things so you just have to turn in your bibles at so let's go to psalm 65 verse 4. if you don't mind maybe if you someone's next to you and you can look off of their bible and i want to read just this one verse of scripture where we were drawing from last week it's good to have brother bobby sister michelle here with us as well amen psalm 65 verse 4 i want to just read this verse blessed is the man whom thou chooses and calls us to approach unto thee that he may dwell in thy courts we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house even of thy holy temple amen may god bless the word bless the reading of the word as you're being seated just to move right into this when we look at this scripture we begin to looking at this last week and i want to just really continue that point on the testimony of our lives and that also of a consecration you look here in in the scripture and how that we see that the very the choosing of god when we look at the very first part of that blessed is the man whom thou chooseth and we see that the choosing of god itself it's it's tied directly into the blessing of god that god himself would draw upon our life because remember jesus said if i be lifted up i will draw all men unto me and he is the word he's the living word and his life is what's expressed and he reveals himself by performing his word in our midst and so that's how he's known that's how he reveals his name his name is his character his character is his life and what god as he would say if i be lifted up i will draw all men unto me and that word draw is an inward impelling that takes place it's god that deals with the life let me just say this a person doesn't even have to be sitting here in the house of god for god to start dealing with her life the prodigal son was in a shape and in a place but that place or the shape he was in could not stop the angel the lord from growing right there and dealing with his life because there were some who knew where he was at they knew what he had need of and they were praying every night for him and the angel of the lord was there not only to inspire that prayer and faith in the word but the angel of the lord is the one who went there to deal with the heart of that prodigal son and begin to change his heart concerning home before he ever left the pigpen and it's the same way when you see the parallel how god bringing israel god spoke it all the way through isaiah jeremiah on and on how god would gather them back together and look where israel is back in their homeland that is a supernatural sounding of the holy spirit to draw israel into a place where god can deal with them so the choosing of god upon our life is is tied directly to the blessing of god how that god would would call us beyond the things of the world because if we can we can fellowship on this point the things of the world holds no lasting joy or pleasure it doesn't matter what a person solomon sums it up in the book of ecclesiastes over and over and over again of everything that a man could get a man could have a man could spend his whole entire life and going for this and going for that and solomon writes it in ecclesiastes 6. he said and then he said the man's not even there to enjoy it it's vanity it becomes vanity and because the things themselves i mean we we know this we see things to where uh things that are temporal or material value and it's not saying that there's not things that we may maybe that we don't want but there is as a believer we evaluate that though this thing i could have it's not sin but what's it going to require of me to have it are you with me i mean there's look let me just bring it as it comes to my mind there's no sin in having a boat all right right there's no sin and having a boat oh you know they're just no there's no sin in having a boat but if having that boat means you're gonna have to compromise on coming to the house of god i'll just work i'll just stream they've got streaming available then right there there is something that was not sin that now becomes sin are you hearing me this is why the bible says that no man who is called to be a soldier entangleth himself with the affairs of this life that he might please him who have called him that's not god's responsibility that's ours galatians 5 1 stand fast in the liberty wherewith christ hath made you free and be not entangled again in the yoke of bondage there's a lot that could be said with that part of it but i think that when we can draw from the scripture that we have to we have we are mindful we not have to be we are mindful that there's things that we have we need the discernment of the holy spirit in our life that's why we need to come to the house of god you might say brother samuel i've got discernment but wait a minute here we need the word of the living god to come down hebrews 4 12 says he comes down as a discerner that's a judge of the thoughts and intents of the heart because sometimes our thoughts are dead on but god has to come down like he did to the prophet and reveal if you continue to go this way this is what's going to happen but it's your choice but you see this is why in our lives that we can never ever ever take anything for granted we want our lives to be evaluated by not only evaluated by the word of god but to live by the inspiration of god through every part of our life let me just say it like this if there's something that i can do and jesus can't do it then i can't do it right i don't want to do it if there's something that if i can say well i can do this if jesus can't be my buddy and be there with me i don't want it if it's something that's going to get between me and jesus i don't want it because he means more than life to me this life holds no lasting joy or pleasure but the choosing of god has its tied to the blessing of god it calls us into the place that we were ordained to dwell in let me say it like this to where we become a fully manifested son or daughter of god not a son or daughter of god by knowledge but one that's expressed not one that oh sons of god do this daughters of god do this oh sons but it comes to a place to where there are times that yes as the word comes to bring correction and direction in our life there's a maturing and a groin but we're not doing it by an intellectual thought it must come from an intellectual thought to a subconscious moving and that takes the birth of the holy ghost in our life to where it's no longer us walking by our intellects or our mind our reasoning but now it is the mind of christ that is pulsating within our life we have a advocate we have an absolute we have a source that we're able to go to and say lord what do you see in this praise you see and there's nothing that'll satisfy that calling in our lives for a just there's nothing that will satisfy it because david said a deep call to deep at the noise of thy water spout nothing will satisfy it but a full manifestation in our lives and to see that even a life that hungers after god let me just say this to you a person can look at another person's life or as you might said here today and you might say man i want what they got i want hey there's life setting here right now today where that life has been expressed and that's why they're here i want what this person gots but let me just tell you something who put that desire in you to want that you can say well i've got a lot of other things in my life but my point is who put the desire in you to want that kind of a lie amen i'm telling you you didn't put that into you your family didn't put that into you all the teaching you sat under didn't put that in you that came from the mind of god it was in you the whole time that's why there is no joy no satisfaction no pleasure in the things of this world because you weren't meant to fit into this world you're not of this world you always belong to god [Applause] you always were a son and daughter of god but you had to get to a place to recognize this is who i am i'm not the son of james and pat brown i am the son of almighty god and this is where the scripture said blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled you can't get to hungering after god and god not be moved you can't get thirsty and god not be moved it's god who put that hunger there god who put that thirst there the word comes to stir it up we're living in the season and the hour this is your moment this is your time this is my time blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness they shall be filled the holy ghost is not a maybe it's a certainty amen amen praise the lord so remember as we look here in the word of god in hebrews 10 the spirit of god he comes to draw upon our heart that we'd come through the right approach remember blessed is the man whom thou chooses and calls it to approach unto thee now approach means everything right you heard how brother brother brown will go through this he said there's a way that you approach he said like a king you know i might call i might call you buddy and everything else you know and that's just kind of just a term you know i can't help that that came along you know but i don't i don't walk up to a king and say hey bud what's going on hey buddy i mean you know how you call people buddy it ain't even hey buddy you don't walk up to a king that way matter of fact brother bam said there were times where they had to take out the cuffs out of his trousers there was an approach even to a judge brother brown says it like this he said you don't go up to a judge and say hey judgey hey pal he said you referred to him as your honor there's a right approach you see let me say this to you god is so interested in the fulfillment of his word that he won't leave it in the hands of a man but god will send his word it's god fulfilling his word and it's god revealing himself to be the only provided approach it takes it out of church denomination it takes it out of the hands of man that's what's messed it up down through the church ages is when it got into the hands of man but when it's in god's hands let me just tell you like this look at your hands look at your hands when you see your hands you look at and say that's my hands if you're born of the spirit of god those are god's hands he's the vine we're the branches and god uses you as subjects to witness to deliver this word and to express this word amen amen it's a right approach and so you know this is why and i'm just to lay this in very clearly that the way of approach as paul would write here in hebrews 10 19 he says having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus now we realize that the blood of jesus as it ran from that body it went back into the ground it broke down into the elements and became part of the earth i'm talking about the literal blood but the blood was shed to pay the price but what what was on the inside of it was the life and because the blood has made the purchase that the life can now come back to you and i and draw us bringing us out of the pawnshop back into christ but the right approach because you know a lot of times the the term the blood of jesus is just thrown around but you see this is why that god would have it wrote in his word uh where down through the ages like brother brahms said the the theme of every apostle the theme of every ministry was the baptism of the holy ghost was getting under the blood and this is why in this hour when there's a lot of other things that got into the sight of the church it has got the church in such a sight to where she believes she's all right and the bible says she's naked and doesn't know it that nakedness she might be fully clothed on the outside but she's naked because her soul the unconverted nature stands out in the presence of god is that right so the blood of jesus there had to be a call in this hour that would tell us look away unto jesus look away from all of the isms and doctrines and this and that and you know a person you know even as it rolls up around our ranks well you got to see it the way i see it you got to see it the way i see it i think like one sister told you know a person you know off on their own little belief and he got on that person you know and said hey you didn't bring your glasses to service and she said i forgot them tonight and she said here you can use mine she said no thank you because i'm afraid i'll see things the way you do god bless that sister because you see they get into an eye and he gets into a channel gets into a camp gets into a seclusion but nowhere nowhere should there be anything that is exalted or lifted up above the name of jesus christ satan hates that he's tried to tear it down through the ages of the deity of jesus christ of christ becoming preeminent in the life of the believer he's tried to diminish the blood as a past happening instead of the holy ghost coming and making it real that we were in the mind of god and god came down for you and i he paid the price and now the holy spirit has come to seek you out and bring you back to himself you can't separate the blood from the word because it was the word that was made flesh and bled for us is that right that's scripture so in order that he did that in order to open up the way now hebrews 10 19 having therefore brethren boldness somebody say boldness that's a confidence to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus it was one time death to go behind that veil it was death only one could go behind there is that right representing there was a time coming there would be one who would go back in there once and for all he wouldn't oh my he would make a way but brother you make one trip there you'll never be the same [Applause] oh my boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having a high priest over the house of god remember we collectively collectively are members of his body a part of the house of god we are stones that have been assembled by the grace of god brought to a place that now god might inhabit the his people as paul would write we have been made a habitation of god through the spirit individually we are a dwelling place as well amen and to see when god let me just say this and move on when god has come individually then let me tell you something your little stone alone is not the tabernacle of god god didn't say let them make me tabernacles we're going to preach now boy all right what are you saying well i get my own little private thing and i pull off this way i get my own little prank the revelation of jesus christ will stay together it wields us together it unites us together how can the revelation of jesus christ be in his heart be in our heart and us away from one another it can't happen that way it drives us together because it's the love of god pulsating in our heart for one another [Applause] amen praise the lord man that was free that's like an extra prize in the crackerjack box but here's what i look let me just deal with this here just a moment and drop this and let's move on in hebrews 10 22 the next verse says let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water this this is the result paul is letting the believers know this way that's been made for you and not only been made for you but now through this way it is opened up that then the life itself can be changed in other words where there is condemnation there cannot be faith but see now the spirit of god comes to deal the word of god comes to deal with condemnation comes to deal with sin comes to deal with guilt comes to deal with doubt it comes to deal and begin to expose that old nature that's there that this is not my perfect will but i am your perfect will god reveals himself as the will for our lives is that right so now when the word is being expressed now god is is beckoning to you and i let's draw near with the full assurance let's let's move in to this place let's operate here as sons and daughters of god you see we grow and i don't want to labor on this point this morning but when we come into this place with god we come into the place of adoption as sons but we still have to grow and mature brother brahms just said it very simply and works as faith express he talked about how he grew in his own ministry he said if you're not growing something's wrong hate to say it but sometimes the way we grow is learning from our past mistakes i mean for those of us who have them you know i mean for you know for the rest of you know they got angel dust instead of carpet you know but for the rest we learn from that we grow from that so you know brother batman is dealing with this consecrated life and he's talking about how a person he said when they would ever take their life a man ever takes his life out of these other places and into that consecrated place with christ now brother branham i read you the quote last week where brother baby says too many are are playing in the courts yet now i don't want you to i know you wouldn't but let's just put it very simple he's not talking about us playing kickball he's not you can even talk about where people are not well they're not being silly the word playing is the opposite or a contrast sincerity let me just let me say here now brother brown deals with it you can be sincere deadly and sincerely wrong see i'm we're interested about being sincere to the word and the presence of god i want you to be very clear here i'm not talking about sincerity of where we do this and we do that and we measure up to your standard and then we measure up to your standard then buddy we're sincere that's not what i'm talking about we're talking about sincerity to god amen when god deals with our life we can say forgive me lord i see my shortcomings i see my weakness i see that lord lord jesus let your word be formed in my life that area that's a weakness what are you doing you're inviting the blood to cover it and inviting god to deal with it amen you can't get in without repentance and you'll never live a very victorious life without repentance and you can't repent if you don't allow the word to speak to you and evaluate your life but when the word comes it evaluates our life then we can say like paul i die daily we don't even have to be in the house of god but our lives now daily monday tuesday wednesday it's the word we're hearing there's a reflection going on and saying lord build me up here lord build me out here lord cause me to increase here lord give me strength here why because you are in contact with god you have been brought back into the place that adam fell from where god is speaking lip to ear to you you're his child his son or his daughter i tell you repentance is an awful big thing repentance ain't blaming something on mommy or daddy or anybody else i'll tell you you don't take a hound dog to sniff through that kind of stuff right well you know i wouldn't be like this if anyone saw it that ain't repentance that's called worldly sorrow paul identified it what it is sometimes where people get in a sorrowful condition and the only thing they're sorry about is because they're sorry some of you catch that but it's not godly sorrow because godly child worketh worketh worketh worketh why because it worketh it's god who deals with your heart and through that godly sorrow it works out a life that then it's a fruit that expresses the work that started in the heart that's what we want don't we oh ungodly sorrow see it's repentance you see this is why brother brown makes a very a very simple statement in god hiding and simplicity out of new new albuquerque new mexico he said when you fully surrender you'll fully come in right right but the same i repented i don't have the holy ghost you haven't fully repented when you fully repent the holy ghost will come when you come to come into a place to where it's a full surrender i don't want these things no more i don't want this life anymore lord i want you see it moves from these things to i want you it's a full surrender there's got to be a repentance let me tell you something you can hear all this preaching of the word but let me tell you something if it don't bring conviction in your life and bring you to a place of repentance you're missing it amen i'm not saying that we're all without the holy ghost you understand what i'm saying you're mature enough to catch that what i'm dealing with is how the word it ought to be dealing and bringing conviction to our hearts and our lives there's a responsibility that we have when the word is dealing with us and this is why that when paul would deal with it you know and brother brown was talking about this playing it deals with from playing to living you know i'm just not i'm not interested in playing i know you're not either i'm not interested in in playing around with the man with the message i'm interested in living it amen i'm interested in this word becoming flesh in my life amen this is why it's a time to be serious it's a time to be focused in it's a time to be consecrated more than ever before let me tell you something god in this age knew what it was going to take for you and i yeah brother brown said we said people don't even have hardly enough faith to heal a toothache and we've got to have faith to get out of here now there's only one thing that will bring that faith the key of g the key of c your favorite song won't bring faith oh brother samuel i'm i'll tell you what i can't wait to get in a good service man the power of god is moving around faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god the power of god comes on the scene to demonstrate the word is that right to deal with our life then our lives might be further changed from glory unto glory unto glory so how god himself would provide for us in this hour knowing what we have need of and god has he sent the message according to what he promised he would do in this hour then i think it behooves us with everything brother brand would say it like this i think it was in spiritual food and due season he says if he is that north star if he is he says our absolute he says if he is our ultimate if he is her all and all he said then we we it deserves for us to give everything to him our whole lives and let our whole lives revolve around you say what do you mean by that let me tell you something when the slaves were down there and they were in bondage down there in the south and they had different ones that would go down there and the underground railroad passed through this area and many of the places and remember when they went through there what was that they were following they were following the north star the north star is what directed their movements then if it was a cloudy day there was still the moss and things that they could detect on the trees but they knew head north they knew kept going keep going this way and follow the path of the star let me tell you something in this hour we are not in darkness this is a gloomy day it's a day of grace our greatness where a man doesn't know right from wrong but the promise said in the evening time there will be light that's no longer prophecy we are living in that and we are the manifestation that our light has come this evening life has come to our lives what do you mean to where we're not we're not tossed about looking right we have found him found him yeah he found us i have found him whom my soul loveth you see to be zeroed in in this hour this is why when brother branham would speak of and i'm just going to have to kind of move through it he deals with the dwelling place as we looked at it there in our drawing of how that god dwelling in the holiest of holies and how that within that you know has he dwelt in the tabernacle god dwells in you as his tabernacle brother baby says we must make this place a dwelling not an outer court place or a first holy place but we must live with god in the holiest of holies a consecrated hidden life alone quiet with god now i want you to think of it make this place a dwelling place amen so brother brahma said don't make it an outer court don't make it a holy place what's by the brand what's brother i'm talking about it's got to be a new birth on the inside right it can't just be in the outer court let me just say about the outer court do we need the drawing again anybody need the drawing or we got it i'm not asking that because i like playing with it i don't it's not a plan i did that with the young people for years but the outer court you know a person can come in here and they don't repent and they could see that they can see the healing they could see miracles they can even enjoy the word man that's some good preaching and not even repented in the outer court that's right but they've come in and because what it is they feel like i've done my duty they feel pretty good i mean who don't feel good when you get out of the house of god i mean even if you've got a high tannin i mean you feel good you know he kept in contact with me i mean you know it's good to be in the presence of god amen but you see the outer court itself these are the types of things when brother brown tells us being in that outer court a person can come into an outer court and then the very next day or a moment later or whatever more they're making a bad business deal you would look at their life and in the midst of their peers or maybe on your facebook page let me tell you something who you are in private is who you really are you might you can't put on a show you can't come in here and put on a show who you are you are when nobody's watching my goodness boy this is a it's a pipeline you know we're not interested god's not interested in patching stuff up i hate veneer i hate veneer there's things where you know my wife and i and there's things i had veneer stuff everybody know i'm talking about yeah you know the stuff i want to tell you what country it comes from you probably know but it's this stuff just like they take of you know it's like cardboard yeah and they just glue the stuff on there you forget a cup of water on it one time you'll know it's been there peel right back on you right why it can't take the change in temperature preach with me now it can't take it it just bends up and it comes unglued and everything else you see god doesn't make veneer christians where we're just with man everything right on the outside but samuel you've seen veneer i've seen veneer christians we've seen veneer we all have seen veneer christians because when things start coming down look what comes out [Music] you begin to realize there's that solid oak core that's veneer the experience of god is not a veneer experience it's a real experience to wear when the word deals with our life buddy it might set us on fire but there's real grains on the inside well there's real grains just like the grains in this word that can say yeah lord be it unto me lord you're exactly right lord i'm in the wrong word i'm failing here but lord i'm looking to your grace to give me strength to rise up hallelujah you see because brother brown would even deal with it in this part of it where he would talk about of that and that inner that holy place and talk about that holy place that brother bram calls these areas the adolescent age and then the message hidden life he said well we're fussing you know he said some people they come into that of where the seven candlesticks are he said now they've got enough light to debate and argue or criticize this church don't got it this church got it this church forgive me but who made you the absolute all right you're right amen you see it becomes enough light but you see look that ain't the way that ain't the reason that light is coming that ain't the reason that ain't the purpose of that light coming off that seven golden candle stick the purpose of that light was to show reflect out into the outer cord in the labor where the labor is reflecting that cross and it's to point you that start here come through consecration and go all the way you see the light the star the star is not drawing you to itself come on now the messengers will never draw you to themselves but the messengers are to give light to open up and expose the way that god himself is revealing into the holiest of holies praise the lord i tell you friends you you think it ain't you think things ain't confusing you sit around and you talk you talk to i you know he talked to different ones it's been relatives and stuff like that and here they've got individuals that no longer are sitting in their church and they and they look at it well they spoke in tongues yeah i know they had it that's what they say they're confused though i'm not saying i'm calling them confused i'm saying what they are they said they're puzzled they don't understand i know they got it because they spoke in tongues and yet they divorced this person and went off with this person and we're doing this or whatever more but you see what it is that pathway it was not the true pathway into the new birth gifts are fine but remember how brother man tells us gifts are not an infallible sign of the new birth but he said gifts can identify that god's presence is there working a gift but it's not an infallible sign that a person has been born again are you hearing me thank god for the message of the hour this is evening time light that evening time light was not to cast people out it was to open up the way and to break back the clouds of darkness where satan was wanting to keep people back from a real genuine life in jesus christ no wonder brother ram could say if god gave me the opportunity and the choice and said william branham i'll give you all these great gifts or i'll fill you with the holy ghost with that of the love of god burning in your soul he said i would tell god i'll take the love of god over any gift [Applause] gifts will fail and a person relying on a gift as their holy ghost will fail come on prince within that is not the evidence of the holy ghost that's why brother randall said in satan's eating don't watch the holy ghost so much in demonstrations you watch it in action he's talking about the life amen amen said it like this talking about coming into those courts he says it's better that we come easy and we take our time and see where we're going praise the lord did you hear me amen i'll say that to anybody no matter where you're at here this morning no matter whether young person middle old or whatever more i tell you look very carefully clearly how god has been bringing this out if the desire is lord i want the holy ghost there is a provided way you repent baptized in the name of jesus christ we shouldn't get tired of hearing this that's right amen right hey man this is i'll tell you what this is like right here it's just like when we were getting home from tennessee and anytime else that i've come home from a trip maybe i flew into cleveland i tell you what brother joey as soon as we start getting close to 58 or jager i'm about ready to tell him let me out i'll run the rest of the way home i can't wait to get to my house it's home when you go down through that look at the whole mile look at this person oh my they've put a tree over there i'm looking why that's where i live that's my home this pathway to a child of god we don't ever get tired of that because we know there's lives that haven't experienced yet but we know what it's like to experience a real repentance being baptized in the name of jesus christ and receiving the gift of the holy ghost we know what that's about we are ambassadors brother branham called us like this he said we are messengers angels of the covenant with christ [Music] so it becomes our responsibility so you say brother samuel what do you say i'm saying that don't get into such a place where we're looking way off here you got to take care of first things first there's an approach oh glory to god i i felt it but have you repented if you still got bitterness and malice and everything else in your heart and in your life and their sin and you haven't repented the holy ghost won't come on that you might have an experience that he comes upon you you might feel goosebumps you might feel i don't care whatever you might say but brother here's what brother bam tells us when it all comes down to it he said a person can say i seen a light i felt a wind i did this he said that's all i'm good i'm not going to say you didn't he said but what kind of life do you live after you get up from there that's what matters we're not after sensations and feelings i like them but we're not living by a sensation or a feeling as nothing more i like than the presence of god i believe the children of god ought to be the happiest children and people there are on the face of the earth because we've got everything we've got the greatest treasure and the greatest riches as paul would call the holy ghost paul would say it's the unspeakable gift of almighty god we ought to be the happiest people in the world you see it's a responsibility that we have in our lives daily we're living in an age we're living listen friends don't get caught up in and don't say well so and so they're not no no you forget about so-and-so well i'll tell you what if if so forget about them we have to take responsibility for our own lives brother samuel i thought my pastor was ordained to see me through ordained to see you through not carry you that's right oh lord i'll tell you what man the pipeline was coming down listen friends you know my heart i'm not here to step on people's toes but that's not what a pastor is a pastor's not come to carry you but a pastor to see you through what is it because without a vision the people perish you know what that word vision means in proverbs it means without a vision and that word means nakedness without leadership in the hebrew god provided real vision is leadership and real leadership will see to it that you're not naked we have a responsibility i've got a responsibility before god amen we have to take inventory of our lives just like you know many of you work on jobs in different places somebody's got to take care of the inventory i mean you know brother aaron if they walk out there and say hey we're going to go cut this bridge today the guys go out there and cut it because i'd imagine it's your job there's somebody has to take care of inventory i might be looking at the guy this morning but somebody's got to take care of inventory you can't just be saying you know what i forgot to get more of them diamond tip blades if i don't know if you are the guy or not but we're going to say you are today if he forgets to do that let me tell you something right now that boss or that ceo is going to be wanting to take it out of his paycheck because them contractor is going to hold them to it and say you made a commitment right here you know they're always looking for free money anyhow not just contractors but a lot of people are yeah and it don't stimulate nobody free money don't stimulate nobody it just makes people more lazy well but you see you got to take inventory is that right we have to take inventory we have to take inventory of our lives right now god is the watchman the holy spirit he knows what's coming down the pipeline and that's why we must take inventory by the word don't look at it let me tell me preach to you now don't look at it like well i should know this and i know this and i know don't get that adolescent stage don't get that know-it-all attitude but let god cleanse you if you come to a spot brother samuel we've received the message of the hour but the message of the hour comes under the leadership of the holy spirit it don't make you on an island buy off to yourself and neither is god saying that you're something that you're not even intelligent that's not what god is saying but god is recognizing we are in a spiritual warfare a spiritual battle and satan is doing his best to try to get to your life and cool you off and hinder the working of god but god's desire is his life would be pushed and lived through our lives this is why we need the discernment of the holy spirit consecration let me just dropping this in this term consecration isn't doing works or more works in order to make yourself righteous that ain't consecration but what consecration is is yielding your life in obedience to the word of god by first of all agreeing with him amen amen means so be it and then seeking until that word is made real to us see when it's when it's revealed remember there's three stages in christ is the mystery god's desire to reveal his word first yes then after it's been revealed then it becomes preeminence then the third fold is where the kingdom is restored as it was in eden that not only is taking place as far as over the expanse and here we are in a part of that timeline but that's how the word comes into power in our lives it don't just drop from revelation to become power but revelation that's why brother baby says we need to pray for revelation more than anything because with revelation comes prevailing power prevailing power what first of all we need prevailing power to work here to get rid of our thoughts i'm not just talking about the new birth i'm talking about in our everyday individual life because we still carry seed taste feel smell here conscious memory affection you get it we carry all that and this is why we need the prevailing power because revelation will uncover it'll reveal and when that revelation is revealing what does it do it's power that's being released as we can allow it to work in our lives that word will come preeminent and once it becomes preeminent then it begins spoken through our lives and now that kingdom is restored and you're seeing a son of god being manifest like it was back in the garden of eden and like it was through the lord jesus christ and like it has been down through every age and here in the end time amen you see that's why after the service is over it's not just man that was good that's amen glory to god i'm not listen friends i'm not talking down to you but i think we need to look at these things a little bit more that it's more when we're coming together here my lord how brother andrew brought that out how god used him to bring it out he told me in the back office before he came out he said i'm gonna preach something simple if that's okay lord if that's simple help me you see everything that god speaks to our life when we say it's simple when god gets a hold of it because we begin to realize what's in our hands this is how i felt when we looked at that there on thursday night i felt like the guy who handed me the key ring to my impala when i bought it back in 2012. i didn't know what i didn't know what an auto start was i'd heard of auto start heard of all those things before but i didn't know what it looked like so i'm looking at the key fob and they're drawing up the final paperwork and i'm sitting down there and i thought one was that button for right i know what i was for right i mean i knew what luck can unlock and i knew with the trunk but man i wonder what the i don't know what that's all about finally i asked the guy but joe i had to ask a guy this guy he come over i said hey what is this button right here for right it's here let me show you so he took it and demonstrated the power amen that was already in my hands are you hearing me [Applause] are you hearing me that's why brother branham would tell the church he would say he said you say i ain't got enough faith he said you've got enough faith he said you just need to know how to operate it that's right are you with me now brother brown could take a clear back and deity of jesus christ and bring it down to let us know he said the deity of jesus christ it's right there present in your life to live an overcoming life what that man did he revealed to me what that button was all about you know because there was a pattern you couldn't just push that button at least on my key fob and it start up you had to press lock twice and then hit that button yeah don't mind telling your brother josh i appreciated that when i was standing there at the school when it was cold days i could but you see i didn't know what i had but once i found out what i had somebody had to make known to me what was already in my possession i'm just going to have to go ahead and preach an hour there was already as god would declare it right here that god was already here god was already here but god had to have an instrument a yielded vessel according to his word to begin to reveal what satan had taken from the church and wanted to rob from the people of god that had to be one who would stand there as a vessel and reveal to the church of the living god of what belongs to us what we have the potentials that it might become reality i'm not talking about me or you having lines of discernment i'm talking about of having an access to a living god where there is a real holy ghost who comes to the innermost place in our life and he dwells in that area of our life and he influences every court is that your desire lord influence every court amen of my life you see this is why in corinth in second corinthians 3 when paul would write of this and he would deal with how that and in verse one i just got to read this do we begin again to commend ourselves or need we as some others epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men now what paul is saying that light paul goes on the next chapter that light that shined in the beginning and brought forth order where there was chaos that same light has shined into our hearts but not for ourselves only it came to illuminate the purpose the plan the word that now that same word it would be reflected to a generation to a people of god who would come into the same illumination of jesus christ you're an epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men so simply put in layman's term our life is to be the expression of what brother branham preached amen just as much as abraham spoke under inspiration and the lamb came into manifestation are you hearing me the same lamb that was slain in genesis 15 when there was needed a confirmation that same lamb shows up in genesis 22. in this hour how does that lamb come into existence he don't have to go to calvary once again but the lamb comes into view in revelations 5 because there's a strong angel on the earth that is proclaiming who is worthy and now that lamb comes into view in where where does he come into view not just in the life of the prophet but he comes into view in the life of his redeemed body his pride and there is a uniting that takes place as bride and groom and never said we were the lion's wife we're the lamb's wife but don't push me satan because there's a boldness on the inside but there's a lamb that comes under the word when my husband asks for me it's a lamb nature amen don't better say no how small that might be a wolf you don't wanna you know what a wolf don't show your teeth when the words come and just show your heart when stephen was preaching they they gnashed on him with their teeth but there were those who had a heart amen for as much as you are manifestly declared to be the epistle of christ ministered by us written not with ink but with spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart so it's coming to be veiled by the word of god now to be veiled by the word is you know you could you could cut this bible up and this is all the word of god in printed form right and you could actually take this and make some make a garment out of it and say man i'm veiled by the word but that ain't the veil he's talking about because you see the reason israel could not see because they had a veil on their heart now that veil is a traditional veil it's a sin veil and see a sin veil that's why the bible tells us that we must be born again without being born again we can never see the kingdom of god is that right so god comes to deal with the veil that's over our life he makes himself known why he's one of our kind are you with me he's a kinsmen redeemer he's one of our kind so there's an attraction that takes place because when he comes remember he delivers his word paul said that epistle that's written in our hearts and that now that word that god has revealed now is spoken out and it's to now come into manifestation in the lives of the people you know what god is declaring when god sends this word this message to a generation god is declaring there is a people on earth right now that are this word and will be and is the very manifestation of this word it ain't about what you see or you don't see it simply be it unto me according to thy word and god comes to deal with a sin veil how does he deal with it by the word veil he comes the word itself it comes and it makes itself known and it deals with that calling us because that sin bill is a barrier are you hearing me it's a barrier it's a tradition that sin veil remember it's a traditional veil that's i've got us i'm going to say some things as it's coming to me when brother branham preaches the message the men the services on demonology demonology religious realm demonology on the physical realm or physical realm and religious realm and enticing spirits when brother brown deals with that of how that demons themselves demons don't have no problem hiding behind spiritual gifts brother brahman talking to people in entirely spirit they were they get real spiritual oh i'm going to start fasting and everything else but god isn't calling you to that god's calling you to a new birth come on now whether it's any gift that can be lined up this is why our life is not based upon any gift my life as an overcomer is not based on the gift to preach come on now it's not based on that at all this is the gift of god working through the gift of god i'm talking about the gift of god is that soul on the inside that came from god that is the predestinated channel of god and god sends a word like he did through john the baptist to prepare the way get all the junk out of the way so that the word can come to its rightful position and when the word comes to its rightful position it don't write in weak and mingly and mangy the word rides in with power in our lives [Music] and he exhibits himself as the mighty conqueror so we become veiled by the word tonight brother brown says it like this i've got to read this he said tonight we're getting he says there's raising up among us groups carnal comparisons somebody try to act like it and live a different life can drink and smoke women can live most any way they want to like the world and stay home and watch television and things of the world and call themselves pentecostals let me just update that they can do all those things and still call themselves message believers brother samuel that's awful straight you might he might hate me now but you'll love me on the other side you see this is why when brother brown when he preaches the message knoweth that not brother brahma he know is it not god of this evil age these are the messages where brother bram deals with how you can have the baptism of the holy ghost every hour of your life and still be lost and go to hell because the holy ghost has come to quicken the word and make it live not to bring sensation amen come on now all right brother brown said the blessings we receive outside of christ he said they're only temporal they fade away but any blessing inside of christ that brings you in it's lasting hey ask moses if the blessing wasn't lasting when he stood face to face with pharaoh the blessing he got from the burning bush it held out pharaoh stood right there and said no not gonna let him go moses didn't say uh-oh speed oh no network signals down what am i going to do now what is this i thought i no you know where the word was at the word wasn't here the word wasn't here in the outer court it wasn't here in the holy place the word was down here and moses he came to that spot and moses he came to god and he said lord in egypt thou sentest now that my people your people lord you let's set me down here and now this is what pharaoh said you see the difference it was an anchor on the inner court those things arose that he couldn't understand those things happened and it didn't go according to how he had it all planned out come on now it didn't happen that way but he had an anchor and absolute to go back to and said god he knew he met god he knew he met god so he could go right back to the sacred sound let me tell you something sacred sands it ain't your prayer closet somewhere there might be a place in mind where you could say i believe it was right here but the sacred sands is the presence of god where you made your life a place that god could come down and have a meeting with you brother you pack that everywhere you go you might be in the hardest of trial the hottest of the desert but the sacred sands of the new birth are right there with you in your life [Applause] and you can stand there with boldness and say god i can't make sense of none of this lord i had a lot of plans but i realized those were my plans and they weren't your plans it takes a real son and daughter of god to be able to stand there and humble themselves in the midst of their plan come on we've all been there god teres guess what we'll be back there again why because we're still walking in this flesh we don't want to be back there but there's times in our life that we have to be able to say that you know what i'm here lord these were plans that i had but this was not your plans lord amen [Applause] [Music] this is where you begin to pray yes lord your ways are higher than my ways but i think my ways are good right now lord i said okay go ahead you see you're a son and daughter of god listen to me god is the son and daughter of god he doesn't put us in the head like brother joey that's right you don't come down oh i'm going to get you joy if you go that way i'm going to get no i didn't we're living in a month of booze boo and haunted houses and haunted this and god don't come down the house of god need to be a spooky place it's a place of liberty where the word comes down and deals with our life now there's things that god can deal with our life and once in a while he might have to let us dangle over hell a little bit to show us the weak links in our life but you know what he does that with loving kindness he does that because he loves us and he really cares about us see it takes these things out of us here this is why when brother brown talks about that remember he talks about he says brother baum says it like this he said you take a woman he said here she is he said she she's she's uh uh she spoke in tongues man felt the holy ghost come on he said and still get out there and wearing shorts and stripping down and pants and everything else and brother brown says like this you try to tell her she don't got the holy ghost why they're basing it on experience instead of the word that's why brother branham tells us in the church age book he said away he said the reason the problem that's in the church is because too much has been based on experience he said we've got to get away from experience and back to the word he wasn't telling us that we don't need to have an experience are you hearing me let's balance this out he wasn't saying we don't need to have an experience but he's saying you've got to have an experience that's deeper than the outer court deeper than the inner court it's got to be a word birth a word experience and that's what the baptism of the holy ghost brings it brings a life not a life that's perfect in itself but a life that'll submit itself to the word a life that the spirit of truth will lead in god into all truth amen you might not never speak in tongues you may never be one that prayed for somebody and god uses that you pray for them and they are healed but you know what they don't got nothing to do with your soul i'm not making a lot of all that i thank god for every gift but i'm going to tell you there is no gift that we're to rest our experience on i feel like just preaching a little bit more just as this inspiration of the picture coming together this is why brother branham preaches a message led by the spirit of god he tells us in the message of prisoner he says come next sunday i'm going to preach a message he said because there's some reason he said that people he said you see him just kind of sluggish he said we ought to be on fire with the message that god sent us he said they're kind of wandering around and sluggish he said god has given me a message to deal with that next weekend now brother brown he turns right around and i believe he preaches the message i think it is he that is in you or he careth for you and brother brahms turns into that message and he starts preaching about hybrid food he takes it from a reader's digest thing and he talks about how the hybrid fruit is breaking down even the natural abilities in the body of women to reproduce in minds and whatever more lord have mercy just look around us today is that right but then he goes into dealing with situations of what he's seen where he said you had preachers that coming off the airplane hey i remember my daddy told me about a well-known evangelist and different one that was called out even on tape and things getting off the plant getting off the plane over here in cleveland couldn't even walk down the steps they were so drunk well-known man prayed for people people getting off the cots he was a man i'll tell you i i won't quote that because i really don't want to call the man's name out but you know you of how brother branham even revered this man's ability to preach that's right but brother around him deals with he didn't call the man out on tape but brother ram's dealing with things he said the reason he said you find things in people's life he said here's what it all comes down to they're really not repenting you can't bypass repentance you can't just say well i agree with the message the devil agrees with this message the devil if i can say it like this agree with it the devil knows it's the truth you can send down and ask the devil he's just messing the truth he'll tell you it's burnt my heart many times it's kicked me out of homes it's kicked me out of lines i know the power in this message you don't got to convince the devil brother he's a believer [Applause] come on you know i'm referring to in the book of james the devil believes and he trembles the truth brother said they're trying to impersonate a genuine right it's not been revealed to him i want you to listen this this quote listen to this it's not been revealed to him when it is revealed it's glorious when it's revealed so what changes not the word us us not the word us how does that change sin veil is broken and now it's a word veil and the only thing we can see and desire to see is jesus one thing we can look back across your life and say wow lord you had your hand on my life all the way amen even when i wasn't even seeking you and i thought i was just kind of doing my own thing and this and that but god you've watched over me amen devil would like to take in your life many times i look back and when i was a little boy i can't even explain this you know that's why the devil gets after you that's why he was after you because there's something somewhere along the line there was something about your life where god shows interest that's right as a little boy here i was in a barn and i was up there i crawled up in that barn and i bought up the ladder went up that barn you know and there was a hole it went perfectly cut it was jagged that's one thing i remember the jagged hole what we do them those cattle those steers would come in there and they would come in there and what we'd do is we'd kick that straw i wasn't allowed up there but one day i crawled up there next thing i know i wake up taking straw out of my hair i was on the ground it was way up in the air you say what was it my life couldn't be taken right then that's right i was a little guy my life couldn't be taken your life couldn't be taken because why there's a greater life that had to come to expression inside of your life god never lost track of you never lost sight amen praise god when it's revealed it's glorious and something takes that out of you when you walk in there and you become a veil he said now you see moses veil he was the living word to the people and today the people that are veiled are the same thing he says they are written epistles read of all men not a new epistle over and over oh man with different ones oh brother brandon when god opens those seven thunders it's going to give you something that's not even written in the book but brent said that sound 99 he said but god won't go outside of his word amen then of course we had you know some oh these those seven thunders they were this they were what the scripture says write it not all right it's a message but it's not the seven thunders are not wrote out it's the voice of god that sounds is that right and so we're not a new epistle in other words god didn't come to add books to the bible well my book who are you well i'm the i'm the second i'm i'm the second book of acts if it's a book of acts part two then it's a continuation of acts part one amen he won't dress different act different talk differently hello now if that vine not if the church if the vine ever puts forth another branch it'll write a book of acts behind it amen glory be to god so we're not our own little epistle well i'm my own little pistol i got my own doctrine i got my own doctrine i got my own favorite quotes how important to you oh you're your own epistle but you see not a new epistle an epistle that's already been written where was that epistle written in the mind of god before the foundation of the world it's called lamb's book of life and that epistle is that that part that you and i play in this book the lamb's book of life listen there's many people in the world listen and this is not a knock there's many people had there not been a fall people wouldn't there many people wouldn't even been here but there is a book of life and then there's the lamb's book of life the lamb's book of life remember when the mighty angel descended he had a little book open this message is calling to the lamb's book of life that's why i don't get offended if somebody else says well i don't know i really can't see that i'm not offended that they can't see it because listen there are names that are on the book of life that are not ordained to see the lamb's book of life and i thank god for that oh yeah oh yeah i'll shout with him on that i'm having a problem with that a bit but a new epistle not a new epistle because you see if you got your own epistle well then you can have your own church right because every church got there doctrine boy this is why the holy ghost is needed by the new birth it keeps a life christ centered amen so things aren't gotten off in pet doctrines hearing pet doctrines there and pet doctrines there and it becomes the first church of whatever the last name is see we're not a new epistle you know we're not running down the bookstore hey you got a new tab you got a new tab what tab do you need i need the tab brian jr that's what i need the tab not a new epistle we're the one who's been written already but you see just like anything that's been written there comes time to loosen the voice that's contained in the writing and god provides a diamond chip to come and begins to come upon the record of our life oh not the record of our past that's done away with amen but now it begins to bring out the real record of our life that goes clear back to the mind of god amen hallelujah let me finish reading this not a new epistle but the epistle that's been written made manifest it's those who believe the word and the promise of this day that god is pouring out his spirit upon all flesh and that is written epistles when a person tries to carnally impersonate that it backfires your life shows what you are you read this in closing here i want you just to just listen this is how other message influenced how many know that our life is influencing somebody you you may not even have say brother samuel i am witness to so and so your life is the best witness it's the best the brahman said i've many times preach funerals he said i never try to say too much about the person that's passed on me because there's no need of saying it i mean probably everyone has been to funerals for people sitting there in the honestly but you see what's happened it becomes so common this is why people don't take things serious right yeah that's right because they had a preacher get up there and paint up that that old boy like man he was he was an angel and knowing that guy was a rascal and he at least as far as known he never got right with god this is why a funeral you preach it before you ever pass that's right is that right i mean somebody don't get up at a funeral room i'll tell you what they were so faithful your life says whether that or not that's right are you hearing me the people he says the life the man has or woman whatever it might be has lived the life they live will speak louder to the congregation than anything i could say about them that's right are you hearing me now anything i could say about him what's brother i'm saying brother brand i'm saying is that one of my quotes ain't enough you've got to have it inside yes you've got to have the voice of god inside that speaks concerning your life to the congregation more than anything i could say about them i would never change their opinion their life told what they were and then we never know just what we're doing what influence what we're doing is having upon others the bible said we're written epistles right of all men that is your life reads your life reads so loud to the public until your testimony if it's contrary to your life is without any effect it's what you are inside of you that people read right it's what you are inside of you that people read so whatever is wrote inside remember the testimony that i give you god provided the place for the testimony and that testimony coming the shekinah glory accompanies it to make it live all right and notice here he says we are written epistles read of all men that is your life reads so loud to the public until your testimony if it's contrary life is without any effect it's what you are inside of you that people read not so much what you say but what you are seeing you can pin something on somebody and say this is that and so forth but your life being different from what they say your testimony of your life is louder than the testimony that someone could say something about you so just keep that in mind that we're bringing influences every day and the life that you live proves what's on the inside of you you can't change that it reflects every person reflects outside what he is inside but the time goes on if we take the testimony of being christians how many would say lord that's my testimony i'm a christian praise god amen i think that's one of the most solemn things that a man or woman or boy or girl could do or would when he takes on the name of christ that he is going to be a representative of christ you should watch every move you make because somebody is watching you and in this it reflects what god has done for you inside of you there's some challenging words i don't know about you but i want to be the best sign that god's gone i want to be the best son when that little boy called that bartender out and he said hey your sign's down the bartender went out and said he looked up my sign's still all right he said my sign is up there no no no no he said i'm talking about your best sign my best sign he said yeah he said this guy right here laying up along the curb drunk my best he said that's your best sign the little boy said he said because he's got the evidence of what you're selling on the inside is good stuff it's the best sign the best sign in our lives this is why brother branham when he makes this statement and he says in your life every one of us we should want to see our loved ones saved is that what we want they asked brother brown a question how do we win our what's the best way to win our loved ones brother brahma never said sit down and just have a big old bible study with them i'm not against bible studies i've done okay but what brother braham tells us he said this is the best way you win your loved ones is be loyal to what you that's right believe amen be loyal to it in word indeed and an action and everything it don't mean listen to a real life that's really been converted the spirit of god will deal with our life and correct us when we're wrong and we make those corrections by yielding to the holy spirit but brother and sister if your life isn't there this morning i'd say lord take me into the holiest of holies let him take you there don't don't rely on anything i don't rely on any gift don't rely on any sensation don't rely on don't rest until you have that satisfaction on the inside lord willing and sometime from there we'll pick up the last part of that verse where david said we are satisfied the verse we read for our text with the goodness of thy house and of thy holy temple i'm satisfied lord i've found him who my heart hallelujah desires he's everything to me amen and it shows in our life see even the very simple things that we do the daily things that we do praying reading coming to the house of god brother samuel there's some times that i i seem like that i have to battle to get down to pray sure but there's a desire to get before the throne of god what do i have to do well brother andrew referred to it here on thursday night sometimes it's a sacrifice we've got to take it and say lord and you don't maybe feel it's easy to pray a lot of times when you feel anointing man something i mean you just start praying and then there's other times where you have to press a little bit there's sometimes it's very easy to sit down or drive and listen to a message or whatever sometimes it's very very easy to do that then there's other times where you have to press you have to press but i can tell you right now we get a great blessing out of it when we press there's times when it comes to the even coming to the house of god there's times where there's things that comes up and look i'm not saying somebody's sick you you understand that but if there's times listen friends let let the holy spirit evaluate our lives really evaluate closely because look just coming to church if it's just coming to church that ain't enough either but what i'm trying to say is don't let nothing get in your way take inventory in your life and be honest before god because this is why brother bran tells us he said coming to the house of god keeps us in fellowship amen man we want to give every i know i've gone i've gone i've gone along today but we want to give everything everything that we've got this is a time to be very consecrated it's a time god deals with our life let's get it corrected let's get things that say lord let me lay it aside because we are here to be instruments of his amen our life is not our own we belong to him amen a blessed people that he's chosen and calls to approach that we might dwell in him and be satisfied with the goodness of his house you ever ate a good meal you had a good meal and man you don't matter and somebody can walk something else in front of you you're satisfied right that's something so small compared to the person of jesus christ in the life of a believer he's more than everything he's our life he's the one who gives us the strength that even when our body like brother brahman says when his body would tell him ah you don't need to go down there to church tonight just tell brother neville to go ahead and take the service but he says my space that his flesh told him that remember but he said the inner man said you made a commitment say god let me live under that influence let me let my life so live under that influence i want to be more consecrated because as we come into him we live in his presence the bible says where the spirit of the lord is there's liberty there's all kinds of there's liberty here in the house of god but remember is there liberty in your house there's got to be liberty in your house and if there's liberty then you're free to become what the word says you are and if it's and if it's not you're free to receive and come into that liberty yes amen and you know what happens with that liberty we're being changed from glory unto glory unto glory unto glory until eventually the atoms of this body will be changed he's working on us amen he's working on us amen let's pray father lord i i'm just so thankful lord for the leadership of your word by your spirit in this hour lord jesus with such clarity lord that you would you would speak to our hearts that lord not only where that we might know where we are dwelling but where we are to dwell and where lord our lives is the prophet lord would express it there lord that our lives as a hidden life to be lived lord god in that place consecrated with to you lord father i pray this morning lord that god is your word has gone forth if there's one that's here i pray that lord that just between you and them i pray that lord that they they would make not only that ultimate decision to really surrender and forfeit their life lord to turn it over to you god they would look to you and say lord i don't want to play in the courts i want to be very serious lord in this moment i want that experience lord in my soul i want that settledness i want that peace i want that reality i want that change in my life i want you lord [Music] i need lord i need mine that's what i need [Music] because every eye and head is bound please would there be one before the lord has said lord i want that experience in my life god bless your hands god bless you i want that experience lord father [Music] you see the lord the heart behind every hand lord how that you you speak [Music] with such love lord god your desire is that we would dwell in that place with you and lord everything else of this life nothing else can ever satisfy that longing but you lord now i pray god that you'll just i pray lord that not just me praying but god i ask the lord as they father lord have raised their hands and to unite with your mind your desire for their lives i pray god the lord jesus may this be lord that moment lord in their lives oh god we're lord there is lord a real receiving lord of a real experienced lord in the depth of their life oh god an experienced lord that's not something lord that it just gives away lord god later in the afternoon or monday morning or next month when a hard trial comes along but an experienced lord that goes down into the very depths of their soul that lord it's an experienced lord of changing from death unto life grant it lord satan you're defeated you've lost the battle and in the name of the lord jesus christ you're exposed you have no right to know authority and no power your trail has been uncovered and you can't hold a son or daughter of god when the desire moves in their heart to move in to that place with god house of hell give way in the name of jesus christ [Music] hallelujah prank it lord god may the lord jesus looking to you lord and narrow the lord not stopping until there's a satisfaction to know that god that's the satisfying portion that's promised to them lord god grant it lord it belongs to them may they receive that promise lord may they dedicate themselves even right now lord as they've done that lord may the lord dedicate themselves to that place lord under your inspiration [Music] lord [Music] i know throughout this building there's lives and hearts that like myself lord that god have experienced this grace and we know it to be grace the mercy of god to lord in our lives that it's beyond an outer court it's beyond a holy place [Music] but it's into the whole list of holies lord will your life abiding inside of us we may not have all kinds of gifts we may not even be i think our brother branham lord as he dealt with one person in the church that church that person wasn't maybe even the most notable person or whatever in the church but your prophet called them a value to the church they thought they were going to pass away they thought they were going to die they were a nervous type person [Music] lord as they came to brother branham for that personal interview actually it was brother branham who called upon that personal interview for their life [Music] and lord when he began to talk to sister bruce there she asked brother branham a question she said most of all i want i want an experience to know that i've got the holy ghost she said again i want an experience i can put my foot on that i've got the holy ghost now lord his brother branham he's the one that conducted and called for that interview and as he spoke lord to sister bruce in that moment [Music] he began to speak to her in a time in knowing that he says he said to her a normal human being a human being they come here with these desires in their life this would be normal human nature to desire to desire the things of the world he said but not you he said something happened to you one time didn't it she said yes he said what and it changed you don't have that desires no more but your desire is for him what did that for you she said christ he said that's your answer sister right there that's the grounds of her experience to put her foot on the desire down on the inside that expresses itself all the way outside lord yet lord i think of how sister bruce said it there she said but brother branham how can i possibly be the bride of jesus christ i make so many mistakes the lord how brother branham took her into that place he said sister bruce calvary was for your mistakes god made a way that the desire within you could come to a full reality [Music] he said god hears our voice but he sees the blood because lord god when our life has been hidden beneath the blood [Music] by the baptism of the holy ghost the desire that paul seats within our life is to please you is to serve you it drives us lord to do those things lord that are pleasing to you lord i pray [Music] right here among us this morning lord maybe there's lives but just want to be honest in your presence and say lord i've let a few things creep into my life i've let some things get between me and you maybe some things between your prayer life times between really giving [Music] to the word of god and you see how things have cut in maybe it's things that's got between you and coming to the house of god let me just say it to you like this if there's anything between you anything that's come in between just take this opportunity and just allow the holy spirit just to move down and just to remedy everything that's there anything that comes any conviction say god forgive me lord give me strength help me lord not to get tangled back up in that help me lord god in this hour to keep my lines straight to keep my life lined up lord granted lord granted father in the name of jesus christ oh i need more of you that's the way that's the way [Music] [Music] for all those wasted hours [Applause] anybody want to join me and say lord i need more of you [Applause] let me empty out more cause i need more oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] nothing less than more of you oh foreign i need to have more [Music] oh i need more i need more hallelujah [Applause] [Music] that's the way it's got to be [Applause] [Music] lesser samuel and more of god [Music] i need a refilling i need [Music] think how brother branham places it in christ the mystery he says god's desire to get this revelation to you he said but you let so many things take it out of you he said you let your job [Music] you've been through a whole litany a whole list of things you let your husband you let your wife you let and he keeps on and notice he says you left i believe that's with every revelation [Music] i believe that's with every revelation because we're being changed from glory into glory i want to say lord let me evaluate i don't want lady osea taking things out i don't want it taking things out i don't want to let things get it out of me let me just stay there lord let me just meditate on let me just talk to you about it let it be a part of our life even you know don't make don't let prayer even be a traditional thing even when you're going down the road maybe you're walking through the supermarket maybe you're driving in your car and say lord and it strikes your heart god be it unto me lord let this word let it just so live in my life lord let it paul say it in my life lord strengthen me and bring something to your heart god let it be that's a communion we've been restored back to that place of fellowship with him and that's god wanting to have just communion with you and just to say lord i i want to dedicate my life i don't want to i don't want to let the things of this world there's so many things that want to try to get it out of us is that right it's not it's not bad people it's just things around us that we can say god i need more grace to recognize things that could be coming about to try to take things out of me [Music] sometimes we all realize listen to me now i have to just say these things are coming to me to balance this out sometimes we realize we go through seasons in our lives too is that right it's like at times when i've talked to the young people and i remember you know sometimes on your job sometimes there's more hours you have to work you don't have a choice they say we want more of that drywall we want more doors in or whatever more you don't have a choice but in the midst of that time listen it ain't nothing like you're signing up for it but sometimes when you come into that where there's a season and you're going through that right there you know what you're able to pull on you're able to pull on the resources where you've already been storing up you're able to look in that time and not walk around with your head hanging down but you're able to have fellowship with god even that word you've been listening to that word you've been taken in you start praying you just say lord jesus you know i don't want to be right here you know i don't want to be in these long hours but lord jesus this is a place i'm inviting you here the company may not invited you here but when they hired me to work i'm inviting you here lord god i'm inviting you to be right here my co-worker i'm inviting you lord to sit in this desk right next to me you invite him let him be a part of your life in everything you do when you've got to work overtime invite him right there and say lord i've got to work this overtime but i don't want nothing taking you out of my life i invite you right here lord jesus make him a part of everything you do make him feel welcome at all times in everything you do and i can tell you right now it doesn't matter how the enemy can try to stack those things up here's one thing about it the presence of god he'll come right there in your life it won't go down it won't be walking around under guilt of well i've had to work overtime and i've had to do this the desire of your heart is to please god so what are you saying by the samuel i'm saying it like this if you burnt the biscuits and you now say oh i can't do the laundry i got to make another pan of biscuits invite him in the kitchen where he's been right there god help us not to get all tore up with the things of life sometimes our best laid plans and we'll say oh we can get this job knocked out in an hour it ends up being a year [Music] right you hearing me yeah and then those things we can get on we can get frustrated we can get down what should i do invite him just invite him and say you know what i might have to work overtime but it ain't getting it ain't getting this revelation out of me [Music] a trial comes up in your life a test comes up in your life you can say ain't getting it out of me i'm inviting jesus right here the same jesus said he said he'd be with me never forsake me [Music] sometimes when i was there teaching school and they would have all these things they would pile up on their thought how in the world am i going to get all this done and teach plan for the next week how am i going to get all this done sometimes everybody knows what it feels like to feel overwhelmed right everybody sometimes you just feel you sometimes when you we get to feel overwhelmed we just feel like you know what what's the use i just sit down where do i even begin at what should i do just invite jesus lord i need help right here i'm going to feel a little anxious about the situation is so much i don't know how i'm going to what do i do invite jesus just invite him say lord door's unlocked front seats for you jesus come on we're gonna be buddies let's go to work today [Music] pardon
