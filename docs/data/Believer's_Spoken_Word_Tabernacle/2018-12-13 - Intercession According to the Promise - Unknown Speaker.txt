word Lord and and just Lord move it upon our hearts and into our lives Lord we pray father we just give ourselves to you now Lord for your glory Lord that you would lead us Lord tonight we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen I want to just start reading and Deuteronomy 9 and I'd like to just begin reading at verse 23 Moses is making known of this to the new generation of what had taken place when the older those older ones and then throughout the journey of where they've come to at this point remember what we've been looking at Israel is at the point and at the place of crossing over and Moses is not only directing them with counsel going into the land but he's also reminding them of God's covenant throughout the whole journey and I believe that's important so we look here in verse 23 here Moses breaks in on this and he lets them know likewise when the Lord sent you from Kadesh Barnea saying go up and possess the land which I have given you then ye rebelled against the commandment of the Lord your God and you believed him not nor hearkened to his voice you have rebelled against the Lord from the day that I knew you thus I fell down before the Lord forty days and forty nights as I fell down at the first now I want you to catch what's just been said here I'm not gonna have you standing long I know it's been a week but notice what it says in verse 24 ye have been rebellious against the Lord from the day that I knew you thus I fell down before the Lord forty days and forty nights as I fell down at the first because the Lord had said he would destroy you I wonder how much within the humanity this would be possible it's not it's not humanly possible it's something that goes completely against human nature so there has to be a greater nature over human nature in Moses right now because he speaks out that you've been rebellious since the day that I knew you but thus I went and prayed for you I prayed therefore and oh my look at this I prayed therefore unto the Lord and said O Lord God destroy not thy people and thine inheritance which thou has redeemed through thy greatness which thou has brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand remember thy servants Abraham Isaac and Jacob look not unto the stubbornness of this people nor to their wickedness nor to their sin so notice what's taking place here this inside of Moses this intercessory he's turning the very eyes of God from the stubbornness from the wickedness and he's turning God's eyes to the promise which is veiled in Moses life and he is a part of it look at this lest the land wench whence thou broughtest out say because the Lord was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them and because he hated them he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness yet they are thy people and dine inheritance which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm may God bless you bless the reading of his word you may be seated I'd like to speak to you on a thought intercession according to the promise you know when we look at this with intercession for intercession itself to take place it is for one that would intercede which would be to intervene on the behalf of someone else and the real reality is it is that there's no way that one could actually be able to stand and to intercede unless they themselves were one with the promise and with the Lord who made the promise because outside of that there's no power there's no ability to intercede but when one is is united with the Lord and United with him and the promise of his word then it is a life of intercession that works then according to the promise and I look at this that how Moses himself these words that we read across here that in every in every aspect of the prayer in the intercession that's offered up intercession itself it is according to the promised word intercession is not just saying bless the people Lord intercession is not saying Lord they're good people that in itself is not intercession but intercession must operate and it is true intercession is according to the promise so when we look at that the thing that that same spirit of Christ that in inner sight interceded in Moses according to the spirit of promise and then if we can think back to even that same spirit of God when Moses came down from the mountain there was judgment that came upon those who had actually sinned against the Lord because God had told Moses he said I will not blot out but those that have sinned against me and so to know that when we think of an in this terms and I don't want to get too deep in this year but to recognize when we look at the Lamb's Book of Life there's not a name that can be added nor removed from the Lamb's Book of Life but because of the fall that took place there in Eden we not only find there to be the Lamb section but we find the book of life there's many lives that would have never even been upon the earth if there had not have come a fall in the beginning but there's many people that would be born upon this earth that dole they would not be of the elect but there would be those who would desire to be saved they would never have the the ability by by election in formation of God to understand God's program to because they were not a part of God but yet they would look to the Lord and God would save them that's happened with in every generation in each of these plans we'll look at a few examples tonight if the Lord help us but then you have others whose names they were never on the book of life then you had names that were wrote on the book of life but because they stood against the Living God their names were removed remember even God broader revising there will be a final revision of the role you know after after ever all the events have climax there'll be a revision and to think of how that God he has he is so placed it and this is where I want your to be that what God has ordained within his word it's going to be there is some there is nothing that can stop God's Word from coming to pass we know it has to be God to bring it to pass and God Himself is the one who gave the word and he fulfills the word and to think of this intercession that was moving within the heart of Moses I want to just say it like this that you know the Spirit of Christ the life of that promise what was once a promise that was there it had been rehearsed as a promised and they were down in Egypt and it was being rehearsed as a promise God made a promise to Abraham it kept on rehearsing it but when the day came that God made a visitation there and came time to fulfill that promise it was no longer putting that promise off to a future date but it was a declaration that God who made that promise has now on the scene to fulfill that promise and let me just say it like this God in this age has not come to make promises God has come in this hour to fulfill promises but they have looked for the rapture and the coming of the Lord the Church of the Living God like as we mentioned on Sunday they moved with urgency looking for this promise believing that they would see it in their generation by being a part of it through the new birth but yet to recognize that there were many in lives that were laid all the way down within this great Lamb's Book of Life that he himself would have to thoroughly redeem waiting on you and I to come on the scene and our names to be splashed in that Clorox bleach and to think of it of how that within the midst of this time there is an intercession that's according to the promise Moses in this he wasn't asking God Lord just look over their sin and and keep going on I want you to remember every time that when the Israel themselves rose up here the previous on the golden calf and on and on their repeat who died instantly are you with me there were lives that were that were died there because they had sinned against the Lord and then in this case were those who had brought up an evil report they died right there right there as God spoke in the camp then you had many others who went along with what was said and they they came to their death as God said I will not allow them to enter into the land but this is my point that I want to draw you to this intercession and to think how that God himself had brought him out by way of a promise but thank God that God had by way as a pillar of fire he had a heart that that heart was so yoked to the promise of God where Moses himself would stand there not as a natural man but he would stand there where a promise had so taken ahold of his heart be that promise you couldn't have separated Moses from that promise that promise was Christ revealed to Moses in Moses and through Moses it was simplicity right there you realize when the promise is you are united with that promise it would be easier for someone to separate the bone in the muscle and everything from you but you are unable to be separated from the promise because you are always a part of that promise we were always a part of that word but the Spirit of God comes down to you and I and makes known that hey I interceded for you before you knew anything about it and I've already made a way for you thank God for the Spirit of intercession thankfully God had a prisoner that wasn't that was a prisoner to his will not his own will his own will it would have been easier for Moses to wipe his hands and say I'm through with it they spoke against you they spoke against me this had to be something bigger than flesh of Moses you know what God was so here with the heart that is full of love and intercession it will stand for God's Word knowing that God cannot fail you couldn't have bat Moses off of this promise this was not the same Moses who when he rose up and slew an Egyptian and then something his brothers said wow you're gonna do the same thing to us and he took out of there and ran he separated himself he went off and noticed he forgot all about the promise he became occupied with sheep raising he lost his vision as the prophet told us but this time you were not going to get Moses away from it because it wasn't something of his intellect it was something that was already sowed in his heart and now the same God that had sewed it in his heart had brought it to a reality this was not Moses acting out this was the Spirit of Christ acting through Moses on behalf of his word Who am I who you see here intercession on behalf of the people forgiveness and mercy was about the promise the fulfillment it's about the fulfillment of the promise this intercession was about the promised God and made it one about pity but it was according to the word I believe we can take a look good lesson here that our prayers should be according to the word not just bless them Lord let him keep going to know but it ought to be prayer according to the word if the word has been revealed to us we ought to have prayer it ought to be an intercession that rises up within us according to the promise that we are born of the Bible even to think you know struttin hearts some months ago in reading of how that Moses would look upon them in the opening chapter of do neurone Deuteronomy 1 and he said you know God said he wouldn't why you and he said he's done it he said the Lord God make you a thousand times more than what you are and bless you as he promised you you see Moses did not look upon the people and just you know just ride it off but Moses knew what God said he won't fail him I look dismal it may look dark but this is God's promise I'll tell you what that's why there's such a need for a uniting with the heart of Christ we don't need uniting with letters we don't need uniting with quotes and prints we need to be united with the God who made the promise and then we've got the heart of God who made the promise pulsating in us you can throw scriptures and quotes around the dime a dozen but if you don't have the heart of God behind it you're thrown around things and placing it here and there and don't even have the right thought and context that's behind it brother Brandon tells us how many times over and over the Lord Jesus cannot intercede on anything other than his word Lord I hope I get better he's still sitting there and he ain't interceding because his promise does not I hope you but if you say Lord by your stripes I'm already heal Bertram said there he is standing as an intercessor shaking his bloody Garnett and declaring it's finished I've interceded for them all of their needs what they have need up you realize a word from you where did that word come from that word has come from the throne of God from the mighty Conqueror himself that you could rise up in the midst of your weakness oh my in the midst and a time when you feel so weak but you can call on him he is the high priest and apostle of our profession [Music] we enter seeds according to his word I break in on this in numbers 14 this particular part that we've read in Deuteronomy and here Moses is before God now mind you this ain't the first time mind you even before they left Egypt the first instance when Moses and Aaron went before Pharaoh and Pharaoh said the tally of their bricks shall not diminish you let them go gather strongly and they came to Moses and said what have you done to us it didn't start in the wilderness it was already there now I'll tell you what any one of us in our natural makeup now I know some of you might have on some of those seven virtues you might have a little bit more spilled naturally in your life than what others of us do but that ain't what we're talking about come on you see it would have taken something more Moses if he ran before he would've ran again but Moses was a part of God he was a part of the promise one time he had eyes and looked out the window and looked upon his brother but now he had eyes that not only seen them as people of the promise but it had become illuminated in his heart that these indeed are the promised people and what God had made it was not a man who made this promise God made the promise and God can't fail the Lord said unto Moses in verse 11 how long will this people provoke me how long will it be ere that they believe me for all the signs which I've showed among them how will smite them with the pestilence and disinherit them and I will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than thee this is second time God has said this they're right and let me just say it like this he's not talking about the the natural genetics of Moses for that promise that was made there is a spiritual seed in whom was in mind when the promise was uttered are you with me in the scripture there in Exodus remember you find I don't say an argument but I want you to find when God told Moses he said bad people he called Multan Moses that people have sinned and you're a Moses said your people you say well who's worthy it was Christ and Christ is God it was Christ there in Moses these are his people Oh glory be to God and Moses said unto the Lord then the Egyptians shall hear it for thou broughtest up this people and I might from among them and they'll tell it to the inhabitants of the land for they have heard that thou Lord art among this people that thou Lord art seen face to face and that that cloud standeth over them and that thou goes before him by daytime in a pillar of cloud and in a pillar of fire by night now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak saying because the Lord was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware into them therefore he had slain them in the wilderness and now I beseech thee this this word beseeched is one of prayer and entreaty which and in treaty means to earnestly make a humble request you said Moses is coming before God and he's telling God to reconsider and that's a humble request humility is according to the word come on friends you can find people all around not even believers some people very humble in spirit that ain't no sign the humility is a humility by the word you with me Cain was a humble guy but Cain could not came build a church Cain brought an offering come on now they say my words that's the prophet's word Cain was humble but Cain could not come to the level of humility or the depth that Abel could come to Abel was able to submit himself to the revealed program and will of Almighty God he didn't have to understand why this lamb he didn't have to he knew this is what was been revealed as the provided sacrifice and he went and did it by faith now I beseech thee let the power of my Lord be great well I just love that his power brought him out of Egypt right the blood yeah it was demonstrated bringing them out of the mightiest nation on the earth his power was made manifest his power there at the Red Sea was made manifest and noticed the very Spirit of Christ inside of Moses is interceding let thy power be great let me just say this to you right now we sing that song Amazing Grace we sing it many times and so often but how much greater that God's grace means to you and I right now tonight as a believer then when we first believed oh it's even so much greater to think of the greatness of how that God drew us unto himself cleaned up our lives and he stepped on the inside and put a burning fire of himself on the inside and then to think as trials as tests this thing's gone throughout the years and yet there's something beyond our own will that keeps motivating us that keeps pushing us that keeps moving in our life it's not our own will it's not our own goodness it's not our works it is the sovereignty and foreordination of Almighty God that God's program His Word will not be defeated if his word can be defeated then God can be defeated but God cannot be defeated he's not a man that he should lie nor the son of man that he should repent he ain't never had to take back a word and ain't about to start now let the power of my Lord be great you might have a need in your life right now that you're calling let the power of the my Lord be great according as thou has spoken nots this intercession according to the promise according as thou hast spoken saying the Lord is long-suffering and of great mercy forgiving iniquity and transgression and by no means clearing the guilty visiting the iniquity of the father's upon the children under the third and fourth generation you say what Moses has done right here within this portion right here this is what God has revealed to him after the past situation with the calf in Exodus 33 that whole part up through the remember Lord you spoke you was gonna send somebody with me who is it that thou you're gonna sin with me and God says glad you asked because I was wanting you to do that but you know I've got I want you to ask him that I'll move in and show you and make myself known in a greater way to you it was it that Moses you know when we look at this had he had an experience at the burning bush he did once it faith it was a solid absolute experience but within this right here the very heart of Moses was calling out and God would reveal himself according to Moses do you realize all glory do you realize God revealed himself to Moses in this way and when this situation God already had knowledge of this but God would step on the scene and Moses he was not just somebody who had accumulated a whole string of quotes and scriptures but this man was living by the word when it came time for this situation he reminded God of the word that God had just revealed to him this is who you are the Lord not was not will be the Lord is pardon I beseech thee pardon the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of our mercy has thou has forgiven this people from Egypt even until now so how did they make it from Egypt even till now by him by his forgiveness how do you and I make it from day to day by him by his forgiveness let me tell you something every one of us need an intercessor on the throne every one of us need the lamb on the mercy seat come on friends it is I'm not talking about going around and willful sin I'm talking about that each and every one of us every day of our lives we need the intercessory work of the lamb sometimes we thought things wrong we've said things wrong sometimes mistakes and traps and other things we need the intercessory of the land no the scripture would speak to you and I in revelations 12 that we have overcome him by the blood of the Lamb glory if my brother and sister that's the working power of the new birth where you and I are connected with the Living God of the promise now if you think you're living too good that you don't need an intercessor you're already deceived you need an intercessor I need an intercessor hallelujah then the Lord said I have pardoned according to thy word see Moses word was God's Word but as truly as I live all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord I want you I could preach months on this scripture right here notice what God is saying my program will not be interrupted sure as I live he lives yet he ever liveth to make intercession as truly as I live the Robina God the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord do you realize this promise it pertains to not only the outpouring of the Holy Spirit it not only pertains to the working through the Gentile ages it not only pertains to the rapture the wedding supper the Millennium it goes clear into the future home for as surely as I live the whole earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord huh he's undefeatable but within this because almost men verse 22 which have seen my glory and my miracles which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness and have tempted me now these 10 times and they're not hearken to my voice surely they shall not see the land which I swear into their fathers neither share any of them provoke to me see it spirit of intercession spirit of intercession is not pity spirit of intercession is according to the word do you realize that promise it was identified with those who are written within that section of the Lamb's Book of Life to wear their names cannot be removed I want you to look at it when you get home I don't got time to read it here but the Bible at the very end I believe it's Exodus 25 26 27 the very last Scripture it talks about how that God he actually removed those men who made the calf that Aaron made that's how it's said he's reason removed those men who made the calf that Aaron made isn't it amazing that though Aaron himself was an artificer he was one who actually had molded and shaped the gold but yet God Himself all the mercy and grace of Almighty God that God did not slay Aaron you know why because Aaron was already in the book explain that I can't I can't are you with me I can't explain that but I believe it the only thing that I know for sure is is that God could not cross over and remove Aaron's name oh my so I if I was you I wouldn't be trying to get your eraser out and remove my name or anybody else's name you just make sure your name's there and live like it's there leave about a very spirit and heart of Almighty God who put it there but my servant Caleb because he had another spirit with him and have followed me fully him will I bring into the land where until he went and his seed shall possess it see God recognize those who rebelled and then God recognized those who fully obeyed Caleb's foot was not in the land remember he was the one standing over a there he had toured the land seen the land he represented the tribal Judah but remember what Caleb stood there he and Joshua in the midst of those spies that brought up an evil report but yet Caleb himself sealed the people and he told them the Lord is forests let us go up and take it at once you see he all already fully obeyed from his heart you see this is why it's so important that we must have fellowship with the spirit and the word Moses was harnessed to it he was yoked to the Living God no wonder Paul could even Express this in his working were there among the churches and Paul would say I work according to his working that worketh in me mightily to think of even how that Israel through their journey you can see even in this part through the wilderness you can see the church ages let alone when they get into the land that there is a period of time that God is actually working and dealing with Israel you know the Bible says there was a mixed multitude that came out of Egypt is that right but yet within the midst of that mixed multitude God already knew that there was going to be seed in there that was promised that was actually going to inherit the land so you see intercession itself was not God saying I'm not going to deal with disobedience no God will deal with disobedience God will deal and he will correct he will reprimand he will actually remove listen friends not just in the future he'll actually remove lives and hearts and names who will not be obedient unto Him you realize brother Bram tells us in multiple places in this in the message that if the person will not take correction from God he said God will take them out of this earth because he will not lose one I want to receive correction don't you I don't want that testimony other side God had take me early why well I was stubborn I wouldn't listen to him I don't want that you realize there will be rewards handed out on the other side Paul speaks of this before the throne I don't want that to be on my resume I want it to be Lord thank you for every time you with me thank you for every time you corrected me every time you straighten me out because I realize it's for my benefit so this word itself the word of the round will go into this and the message for zooming and he deals with how the word itself it must be abiding within our lives not it cannot be just upon our intellect but it must be abiding within our hearts he goes on to say notice God had called Moses out and said I'm going to destroy the whole nation just step aside you ever thought about those words before just step aside you mean God had to tell Moses step out of the way what when God's just do it it's because it was the heart of God the Spirit of Christ that was represented in Moses and God could not walk over his own word he would be defeating himself so he told Moses step aside Moses interceded all of these words throwed himself in the bridge throwed himself in the breech it was Christ in Moses you see God would have killed a whole bunch one time for sin but Christ's throat his self in the breach for the whole human race Moses throat itself in the breach for Israel why they were a people of the promise a promise that God had made notice he said you made a promise God you made a promise that you take them into the land that's right what did Moses do to God when it looked like God was going to do something contrary he thrilled the word in his way oh brother mem said a man how I love that I feel like shouting just talking about it put the word in the way God can't walk over his word remember he said remember that servants Lord Abraham Isaac and Jacob glory be to God God had remembered a promise that's why in this hour has its lifted up in this hour it's bringing God to the attention it's quick into our lives and reminding God not that God forgot but it's reminding you know that reminding says it says i'm united with this promise i'm one with this promise i know you didn't forget it but i want you to know it is the heartbeat of my life it's what i think upon it's what I live for it's what I delight in remember that covenant Oh God [Applause] he said you promised to do it you said you'd take them to a good land that was flowing with milk and honey I've told them what you said and here we are we're on your hands we're on your hands you're the one who brought us out you brought us out here you're the one has provided manna forests provided quail you've provided water you've opened the Red Sea you've done all this were on your hands this trip is an all-expense-paid ticket by you we're on your hands God said I'll tell you I'll take that stubborn bunch and let them rot in the wilderness but I'll take them children of theirs that they say that wouldn't go anywhere they perish in the winters I'll take them over you said God wouldn't keeping a promise oh but he was he was standing true to his promise and he was their children that would have the spirit of the promise inside of them God did not make a promise just because people are along for the ride but everybody that comes along for the ride everybody's meaning that you know that ain't true 1st Corinthians chapter 10 they all drink from the same rock they all pass through the Red Sea they all eight men are they all but there were a few inside of the all who were a part of that promise and that promise made more than anything to them in the world they were not of the people who tempted the Lord or provoked him but they were people who waited on God they looked and walked patiently they believed what God had said he would perform sometimes it's just a carrier these people do you realize if God had destroyed them there have been nobody to go in the land but if you look at just the people so remember what we read and open and catch stubborn people but you see it was what was on the inside of them that was going to come forth Oh help me preach a little bit if it was just looking upon our flesh there ain't none of us that's worthy your best day is filthy rags in his sight Amen God didn't provide good walks he provided his own life his blood to be a token he didn't say when I see your good works I'll pass over you he said when I see the Blood I will pass over you whether this message is a life it's a lot that's to be lived and you've got the life inside of you you'll heed the news you'll refrain from the don'ts you'll heed to the Spirit of God you'll you'll live a life that is righteous the works that will come out of your life will testify to the grace that you've received but don't go looking down at your works and look down your nose in me or anybody else because you still need a high priest just as much as I do Moses was able to stand in the breach for the people let me just move on brother and we'll say it like this in one place and I just read these one to read these points to you brother Brown will say it in one place and he'll talk about Moses you know out of the scripture when you you look at the scripture in Psalms 106 verse 23 it says therefore he said that he would destroy them had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach to turn away his wrath lest he should destroy them how could Moses you know what it means to stand in the breach that there's not a gap do you realize what the Holy Ghost is to you as a genuine believer when you've been born of the Spirit of God it is the does away with the breach between you and God it is the abstract - the title deed there is no longer a separation and here Moses himself he stood in the breach how could he do it because he had the Spirit of Christ on the inside of him it really brings the perspective of one in a million but LeBron tells us he goes into this and the message water from the rock he says Oh am I talking about how the people had grumbled and complained he said here's the power of a believer he thrown himself in the breach for the people and said God don't cross over don't cross over me take me first for you take them lord have mercy in the midst of their own but he said take me first before you touch them he's drawing the attention it's not to Moses the man spirit of Christ that promise that is made flesh God said God could not cross Moses the love of that people Moses had what if Moses would have separated himself what if Moses would have said I don't know about these people these can't be the people I mean they're sorry they're sorry oh my goodness there's just look at him how could he are you with me how could he separate himself one of Moses would have taken the attitude well I've got to be separate from sin he was in his heart tell me how Jesus could walk on this earth separate from sinners yet he was in the house answer me that question what is separation separation is a condition in your heart remember what they called him a wine-bibber they looked on him why you mixing with these people but remember what Jesus said he told us we're the salt of the earth and the salt cannot save unless it makes contact there's got to be contact glory be to God there's people you and I work with there's people that we rub shoulders worth the media spin limiters bring it on down right here it's beyond just the ranks of the message it's right here in our local assembly there's hearts and lives that need ministering to intercessory that needs to work there it must be the love and the burden of Christ within the body to be separate from sinners does not mean that I'd go along with the sin but it means that I go along and I become all things to all men that I may win some to Christ Paul did not mean that he was a partaker of their sins but Paul recognized the grace of God that come to me ain't none of you he said they were bigger sinner than I was I was the chiefest Paul never forgot the grace of God that came his way that's what makes me wonder sometimes where I wonder if people ever did experience God's grace because you see you'll live by the depth of the sacrifice that's revealed to you if the sacrifice revealed to you is very shallow you'll live very shallow but if it's revealed with great all-sufficient power as our Passover you'll live by the regenerative power of the blood of the lamb in your life you'll be able to see things and look beyond things of fall look almost everything and see various I need right there there's a heart that's crying out for God but if we're in the I don't know I don't know if I can hire that God can use you you're not in the right temperance of love for God to even usually let me go on with my message tonight you've got to have love right brother I'm standing there on the platform what did he do he looked at the feet of the man come on measured his shoulders realize his foot no there won't work coat won't work he had a heart floor that man just heard by the Rams say here just hear the morning listen to a message brother Graham talks about Burt how many know how many times brother Graham talks about old Burt night God he hunted with and yet brother Ram watch out brother Ram will dramatize it you know the way brother Ram will dramatize it I guarantee maybe some of us maybe even wouldn't hang around with a guy called Burt but brother Brandon went hunting with him and evidently the hunting that brother Brandon did with him ain't the hunting like me and some of the brothers would do we're generally were out in separate tree stands but he and brother branham were close together and there are things that brother Brent said oh no he's not going to do that tell me he ain't gonna bring up that whistle and blow that whistle whatever more but you see what was the outcome of it what was the outcome the man's soul was one for the kingdom of God because the Prophet was able to submit and manhandle by the Spirit of God his own pride who and God could not cross Moses the love of that people Moses had do you realize you can't talk to nobody unless you got love for him you can't you might as well be quiet you cannot do that you've got to have love for him it's like me if I went to another church and I'm sitting and I'm watching people and looking around if I don't know the heart of those people how in the world could I get up and say I've seen you doing this wrong first of all I would never do something like that that's the pastor's authority within that assembly but second of all I don't even know the heart of those people I don't know their culture their ethnicity I don't know how they think but you know what they are God's people there's something I might think I see that something wrong then I must and will by the spirit of intercession out of love for God's people in her seat and say lord help him and help me just to commit and forget it the heart of God seemed that and couldn't cross over his prophet brother Branham picks this up and says can you see it what prayer can do she already said can you see what prayer can do change God yes after God's already spoke something that's going to be prayer can change it and then he picks up and tells us about Isaiah in Hezekiah how God changed his mind Hezekiah began to pour his heart out and God sent Isaiah back and said alright go tell him prayer changed it what changed it in each one of these situations with Israel prayer what kind of prayer prayer intercessory prayer according to the promise you know what that means in your life that means the same way in your life in marriage with your children you've got a promise in God's Word you've got a promise in God's Word they and their offspring shall be there with them you've got a promise in God's word of a husband and wife you've got a promise all the way through I can resign them all tonight it'll just take up too much time but you have promises in the word that you're able to bring before God and say Lord that my heart would match your heart that what you can see is your heart in me that that promise might come to pass because that's my promise Oh Sammy you don't know no no no no no but Sammy no no no it's God who made the promise and if God made the promise God didn't call me to fulfill it he's the one who fulfills it prayer can change it the Bible tells us the prayer of faith shall save the sick and God shall raise a mother it also lets us know that we're to pray for one another that we may be healed be effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much I'm just trying to get to get somewhere let me get to this point here and then walk we'll just close so many places in the scripture that you could see this with intercessory prayer in job John chapter 1 verse 4 the Bible said his sons went and feasted in their houses every one his day and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them and he was so when the days of they're feasting were gone about that job's sent and sanctified them and rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all for job said it may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their heart that word curse means to bless oneself curse God in their hearts thus did job continually you know what this was a type a type of the Living God the Lord Jesus Christ is ever liveth to make intercession for you and I he is seated there until every one of his sons and daughters come home joke did it continually her adventure they might have done this you know what he put but offering of the lamb when any type of temptation could come and it was about his children and saying this and saying that notice even when the report came that your children have perished but joke could stand there on the promise that God had revealed to him I have offered up the lamb on their behalf all god help us I'll tell you as parents as families as each and every one of us as husbands in a household moms and dads we need to continually Oh for the lam continually we need to continue to show that word and set that word before children before household continually God can bring out of the ground what's not been planted but the urgency as I heard the Prophet saying the message inspiration he said all God help us that we may so before the nighttime cometh he said we must so that there'll be a crop for tomorrow it's an urgency and so on I want you to think of this as we wind this down the Lord Jesus himself the Bible records an in Isaiah 53 of how that God beheld the lamb he beheld the offering up of his sword he poured his soul unto death verse 12 said he was numbered with the transgressors and he bare the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors you see I don't want to say simple truth because I'm not making light of that but I'm bringing this to this place but that is the real reality of what God has done for you and I it has always been that that down through the ages were Satan has wanted to take away from the word and the effectiveness of the sacrifice but you see God has always moved to bring the attention by way of his angel messengers to every age it is pointed back to the all-sufficient sacrifice that was made for you and I it was made for you in mind don't you realize that when God would send his spirit and to think how that Paul would stand there and he would say it has been given to us the word of reconciliation we pray you in God's stead that you would be reconciled to God we pray you in Christ's stead he would let it be known we are ambassadors we are representatives of that light and of this glorious possible we have to bring the good news the announcement that there's been a sacrifice and offering and it was made with you in mind and that light has shined down through the ages in every Gentile Church age and what was it it was the Spirit of God moving in intersession to call his children unto himself those who he had redeemed after cross we were reconciled to God and because we were reconciled payment ransom was made then the announcement comes to you and I and there is that which rises up within us and recognized I was a part of that transaction that transaction was made with me in mind hallelujah it calls us back to the redemptive work of Calvary all down through the ages Paul and them folly was going to come in their day I'd rainiest and then thought it was going to come in their day Martin and them live you see what they had to live that way that was the spirit there that had moved upon their life the issuing of the Holy Spirit their depth of the Holy Ghost that came in that day and they live they live true to that word but you realized that God there had to stay that her the lamb had to remain on the mercy seat until the last name is actually come into manifestation and where it comes to the place to where the name is actually splashed beneath the Clorox bleach we're living in the time of the finishing up of all things oh and I'm so glad as the prophets head oh god I hope he's there tonight for my sin and your sin an intercessor on the throne interceding for you and I who is it that sent the stars in his right hand he did who is it that brought you to himself he did who is it to see to it that this truth crossed your path he did let me just tell like this simply put you and I would not even be here tonight if it had not been the offering up of the Lord Jesus Christ he made a prayer of intercession in John 17 and that prayer of intercession was reflective to what had already taken place before the foundation of the world and he was standing to make intercession for you and I I pray father that thou make us that one even as thou art in me that we might be in them and that prayer has been in fulfillment soon and very soon it'll be the completion the complete answering of the prayer that was made and he has seated there on the midde toriel seat making intercession for you and me think about what kind of lives that maybe some of us were in conditions that you could say I'm glad that God didn't come glad my number didn't call them because I wouldn't be ready he knew that he knew that his intercession held for your life and for my life Ramana you might even been raised around the word of truth just as I was but you know what we had to come into manifestation to where our names would be as the Prophet said in souls in prison thoroughly redeemed we were already redeemed how did you become thoroughly redeemed when you become expressed in this our loving he's seated there on the mercy seat tonight interceding on behalf of his promise you and I can keep him busy tonight you realize that we can say we can put all of our petitions by faith in need before him he's not gonna rise from that throne until the last one has come in glory be to God that's just bare hands Lord how we thank you tonight father thank you Lord Jesus for the greatness of your mercy Lord we realize Lord that your mercy it holds for us Oh God as your prophet would say I don't want God's justice I could never stand it so you would go on to say if I got we got what we deserved we would get help but father your mercy oh it doesn't let us get by but your mercy comes and eels with our life brings us to you corrects us cleans us up fills us up and helps us to grow up chastening us correcting us edifying us we're your workmanship or how we thank you tonight I'm so grateful Lord for the intercession that was made according to the promise or it's always been something that touched my heart after a cutting message like the message the indictment your prophet would move in there in that place I find this to be very remarkable because in that same message he's also speaking of how that himself he wanted to have a heart for the people it lost the feeling and he was recalling that and then after speaking in the message Lord God I believe it was your spirit that moved in and said Lord but I asked for mercy for those Lord some of those Lord that's in these systems and different things he prayed for ministers Lord that were in those systems judgment Lord God an indictment was pronounced it was the same spirit of Christ letting it know if this is an ending with the mercy of God could step in and pray there were a live Lord many different lines different ones of a different ones that we know what I think of different ministering brothers I know that were at that time they were in an organization I think of my own dad Lord whose went on home to be with you Oh God I think of each of our lives it shows a sword it shows each of us sir pastor husband is a dad it shows each of us as believers of the body of Jesus Christ of that burden at desired would that intercession according to the promise [Music] or god help us help us to keep our eyes on you help us Lord to walk with submissive hearts Lord help us Lord that as you would admonish us through Paul's letter to the Philippians looked not just on your own things but look upon one another considering one another praying for one another interceding for one another help us lord help us that we may have a real heart father for husbands for wives for children or myself as a pastor for each and every brother and sister that's here avoid different ones that will hear this service Lord some no doubt the streaming I pray God may we have your heart Lord Oh Lord Jesus for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life help us in Jesus father what a comfort it is you're not gonna lose a one you made the promise the Lord I think about it how many of us Lord many that are older than me sitting here I was just sort of a little something in diapers and even before that many of them Lord were following the truth of this hour no doubt they never thought they never thought we would be here this long when I think back 22 years ago when you were 23 years ago after you got a hold of my life I never thought we would be here in 2018 getting ready to go in 2019 I've never even seen things the Lord never even foresaw things I didn't need to I don't need to know the future of this is going to happen in that but Lord things that we've seen happen right around in our own range some things sword we've seen people walk away and other things Lord or things that we fought that we've never even entertained never even thought about it but father you know Lord and I pray God for your mercy I don't know Lord whose cross the line and who has it but I pray God for your mercy Lord there's no doubt Lord God that there's some Lord God that got caught in the wave they need a real birth they need a real absolute leader real anchor Lord they really needed to meet you Lord but I pray God I ask for your mercy for their lives Lord God not that you would bless them I don't pray in a way of pity I pray Lord God that you'll deal with their hearts Lord Jesus turn their hearts Lord God I pray help them to see the error of their lord help them to see Lord God that spirit of air Lord God that would move around them Lord God granite lord I pray Heavenly Father or God right here in our sembly Lord what God I pray father for so many different needs there's lives Lord that they need a deeper walk with you I pray that God that you would move for them Lord I pray that you would move Lord God for the discouraged in heart Lord I pray father for those Lord better suffering in their body lord I pray that you would move for them Lord God those Lord God that maybe in their spirit Lord that are troubled I pray Heavenly Father that God that you Lord who is the balm in Gilead that you would ease or God may I pray father peace be still or God tonight Lord and may you who is the great rest or God and love her Lord of our soul may there not be one here tonight Lord or God under the sound of my voice Lord Jesus that would Lord go without Lord making you their refuge would their wrists granite Lord we pray help us lord help us we may not be a prophet like Moses was but I don't believe that that's why your prophet he ministered this he never said in that quote what's the power of a prophet no that's not what he said he said what's the power of a believer and we're believers would we may not be prophets we may not have all but we're believers in another part of the message Israel in the church part for your prophets tells us like this he said watch a man before God look at the power of a saint before God what were Saints sanctified ones born of your spirit believers may we throw our lives may we live our lives not for ourselves but may we live it unto you living for others help us Lord I pray we love you and thank you Lord in Jesus me all your loving tonight blessed be the name of the Lord aren't you glad for his intercession you know you think about it like this I got to thinking about this on the way to church thought about that of John 17 the intercessory prayer that was made thought about the lamb seated on the mercy seat thought about him being our high priest of our profession thought about how that God would move down and begin to deal with our lives I got to thinking about that habit you know I was out doing my own thing but then God began to deal with my life he began to deal with your life what was that that was the effect of that prayer of intercession that was moving it was made it was already declared before the foundation of the world but here the Lamb of God begins to sound that out and then the same spirit of that lamb would move into the hearts of different ones and you didn't even know it I didn't know it but our name was being brought before the throne of God I hope it don't stumble you but your name might have been brought before before the throne of God it might have been by somebody who was a Baptist they might have been a Pentecostal and what they knew is that he's a savior come on somebody he's a savior they would say Lord save him Lord save him Lord God knew he had more for you but it was somebody who knew you that prayed for you but God said I've already prayed for him he an hour to be united in this life you see you didn't stop it was gone moving all the time he was calling you to himself the effects of that spirit of intercession do you realize tonight healing that you've received in your body is because there's an intercessor on the throne means that you've had met in your life it's the effect of the intercessor moving upon your life when you've been discouraged when you've been down do you realize what that is when you when you look and you said ma I just don't feel like I've got any strength at all but you thought of the word what was it the Spirit of God moving down said let the weak say I am strong and you said I am strong what is that the intercessor went to work and virtue was released from the throne of God Bobby intercessor himself they might think we're nuts my thing were fanatics but we know we know we've received the experience and the experiences of the release of his virtue in our lives don't you love him intercession according to the promise and let me just let you in on a little news he ain't stopped interceding for you his intercession is full and complete until you be crossed over until you be crossed over until were fully in his arms let's stand I keep reaching to you the intercession
