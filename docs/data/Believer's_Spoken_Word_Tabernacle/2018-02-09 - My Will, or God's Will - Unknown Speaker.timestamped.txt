[35:17] amen were just just expecting you know
[35:20] when we come to the house of God we
[35:23] should always be expecting you know if
[35:26] we if we don't come expecting then this
[35:28] really we we only gonna get what we
[35:31] expected if we don't expect anything
[35:33] then we're not gonna get anything but if
[35:35] we can just expect and you know the
[35:37] thing of it is is that every service is
[35:40] always unique it's always under his
[35:43] divine leadership and guidance you never
[35:46] know how it's gonna go you don't even
[35:47] know as a minister you can study and
[35:49] then you find how that it's based on the
[35:51] needs of the people because it's God
[35:53] taking a gift that he's given and got
[35:56] using that gift to speak to his children
[35:58] and then God has a way in the after
[36:00] service to however that's gonna take
[36:02] place but what we do know is that
[36:04] everything that when we are in his
[36:06] presence there is change taking place
[36:09] there is things there were hearts are
[36:11] being turned hearts are being softened
[36:13] there are God is doing so many things
[36:15] there's you know there's so many things
[36:16] that God is doing that we're not even
[36:18] aware of but that's a confidence that we
[36:21] have in him that he is at work and the
[36:24] Bible says where the Spirit of the Lord
[36:26] is there is Liberty and we are changed
[36:29] from glory into glory
[36:31] aren't you thankful for that that's just
[36:32] not words that's a reality we are being
[36:35] changed we are being changed into his
[36:38] same image well I'm so thankful never

[37:49] but I'm glad to be here and let's stand
[37:53] together and open the scripture this
[37:54] morning that's did this evening the best
[37:57] sound a preacher can hear is the people
[37:59] looking for the scriptures now we're
[38:01] gonna look into where we had here
[38:04] proverbs 14 proverbs I'm sorry
[38:07] Psalms 143 first songs 143 we have three
[38:14] places we're going to read from the one
[38:18] get nervous
[38:19] psalms 143 and verse 8 caused me to hear
[38:24] thy loving-kindness in the morning for
[38:27] indeed do I trust because caused me to
[38:30] know the waiver and I should walk before
[38:33] I lift up my soul unto thee that make a
[38:36] good song when it verse 9 deliver me O
[38:40] Lord from mine enemies I love thee I
[38:43] flee unto thee to hide me teach me to do
[38:46] thy will for thou art my god thy spirit
[38:50] is good lead me into the land of
[38:53] righteousness
[38:54] quicken me O Lord for thy name's sake
[38:58] for that righteousness sake bring my
[39:00] soul out of trouble and over thy mercy
[39:04] and of thy mercy cut off mine enemies
[39:07] and destroy all them that afflict my
[39:10] soul for I am thy servant the servant
[39:13] totally submitted proverbs 14 and verse
[39:21] 12 there is a way which seemeth right
[39:26] unto a man but the end thereof are the
[39:28] ways of death we're going to speak this
[39:33] morning it's evening on a subject my
[39:36] will or God's will we have a choice
[39:40] let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you
[39:43] for your goodness to us thank you Lord
[39:46] for the way you've led and directed all
[39:48] things we thank you for the music the
[39:50] Lords of those who come out with just
[39:52] pray that you'd bless them feed each one
[39:54] Lord I can only speak the words you gave
[39:56] me but your spirit would put it into
[39:58] their hearts let's each one Lord we ask
[40:00] bless those around the world that are
[40:02] gathered in your name this evening
[40:04] protect them
[40:05] help us Lord we ask in Jesus name Amen
[40:08] you may be seated
[40:12] there's one other scripture on read or
[40:14] in Jonah a few pages on over Jonah was
[40:19] an Israelite he was a prophet he was
[40:22] important to God's plan and the verse 1
[40:25] now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah
[40:27] the son of amita he's saying arise go to
[40:31] Nineveh that great city cry against it
[40:34] for their wickedness has come up before
[40:35] me so Jonah was you know a Jewish
[40:39] prophet he from he's from a little town
[40:42] called get temper which is in the north
[40:44] part of Nazareth up in Galilee and he
[40:46] was the first foreign missionary an
[40:51] apostle is one that had sent the
[40:54] disciples a follower and apostles one
[40:56] that sent so he was the first foreign
[40:59] missionary and our prophet said that's
[41:01] the highest calling I know so you don't
[41:04] want to hear that because you know
[41:05] prophets well he said the Apostle was
[41:08] the highest calling so will you
[41:09] that he also says here I believe every
[41:12] Christian is obligated not so much that
[41:14] you have to go to the old country and
[41:16] preach but if you can't go help send
[41:18] somebody else
[41:20] everybody should hear the gospel at
[41:22] least once I want to do my part he says
[41:24] there's something about missionary work
[41:26] that I just love it and just to know
[41:29] that what you're doing you're doing
[41:32] God's will when you're giving to
[41:34] missions so we don't even have to pray
[41:36] about it it's just like acts 2:38 you do
[41:39] even have to read it twice it says so do
[41:42] it along with a lot of other scriptures
[41:45] you just do it you know it's very very
[41:48] simple
[41:48] so missionary work is not only you know
[41:53] traveling to someplace where they don't
[41:54] speak your language where they don't
[41:56] have your food but I don't have your
[41:57] temperature of the water in the shower
[41:58] and all that kind of stuff that's not
[42:01] the only way to do missionary work you
[42:02] see missionary work is living for others
[42:05] right here in Ohio you've got a mission
[42:08] field right here you know now it doesn't
[42:12] mean you got to go through the mall
[42:13] passing out tracts just live your
[42:15] message you see so everyone wants
[42:19] eternal life nobody gets up in the
[42:22] morning symbolic see what I can do to
[42:23] get to hell no everybody wants to go to
[42:25] heaven
[42:25] well like the popular song says they
[42:28] just want to go today you know want to
[42:32] get there but not today
[42:34] so as a church and I know that you got a
[42:40] good pastor and he's got a vision but
[42:42] some churches don't have a missionary
[42:44] vision and they just kind of dry up you
[42:47] know but the scripture says without a
[42:50] vision that people perish it's in
[42:52] Proverbs you know it's a little bit loud
[42:54] up here knocking my head together here
[42:56] yeah got enough problems but
[43:03] might not invite me back you know
[43:05] in the message that day on Calvary he
[43:08] says he was just one man the perfect man
[43:10] he gave his life and he made an example
[43:13] for you now what must we do now the
[43:16] first thing I want to say Jesus never
[43:17] lived for himself his life was spent for
[43:20] others you ever notice that he could
[43:22] have had all kinds of things they live
[43:25] for others that's perfectly eternal life
[43:27] when you say you go to church and do
[43:29] good that's fine but when you live your
[43:31] life for yourself you don't have eternal
[43:33] life eternal life is living for others
[43:37] not so much giving 100 dollars for the
[43:40] people in Africa just living it for here
[43:41] right here you know it proved that when
[43:44] he came in the Lamb of God he lived and
[43:46] had eternal life because he did not live
[43:48] for himself he lived for others and when
[43:50] you receive a kind of life by receiving
[43:51] that day on Calvary you don't live to
[43:53] yourself no more you live for others now
[43:57] at this point we want to give a little
[43:58] bit of a missionary report to let you
[44:00] know what we're doing because we're down
[44:02] in Tennessee we mainly are dealing with
[44:04] the people in Latin America we travel
[44:07] some other places but you know in acts
[44:10] 11 and acts 11 27 they had a situation
[44:16] over there where that there was a famine
[44:18] in the land now God warned them by way
[44:22] of a prophet verse 27 and these days
[44:25] came prophets from Jerusalem unto
[44:27] Antioch and there stood up one of them
[44:30] named Agabus and signified by the spirit
[44:33] that there should be a great and darth
[44:34] or in other words a drought hunger
[44:37] throughout all the world which came to
[44:41] pass in the days of Claudius Caesar and
[44:43] you can go in history and you can find
[44:45] that it was true God warned him you know
[44:47] okay then the disciples in other words
[44:50] the followers of Jesus Christ every man
[44:53] according to his ability determined to
[44:56] send relief under the Brethren that
[44:58] dwell in Judea which also they did and
[45:01] sent it to the elders for the hands of
[45:05] Barnabas and Saul okay so they had a
[45:08] situation and the ones that could they
[45:11] gave their dollar their $20 for two rows
[45:14] and they sent this money and it helped
[45:16] the Saints in Jerusalem okay in Judea
[45:19] well today I don't know if you read the
[45:22] news or seen or anything but there's a
[45:25] great great hunger going on in the
[45:28] country of Venezuela now why is that
[45:30] they live in a you know in a tropical
[45:33] country it never gets cold
[45:35] how come up by Dustin have three
[45:36] chickens and a pig and you know an
[45:37] instant
[45:38] well there's live in cities a lot of
[45:40] them so anyway they're having these
[45:43] problems because they had president that
[45:47] tried to bring it into socialism
[45:48] socialism has never worked in any
[45:50] country around the world but just for
[45:52] the guys the top it's real nice so in
[45:54] the process of bringing the country into
[45:56] socialism he cursed nots people don't
[46:02] mention that name in church we call them
[46:07] the people with the red shirts and so he
[46:11] he said I hate them from the innermost
[46:14] part of my being a little bit later he
[46:18] got cancer in the inner most Peter part
[46:20] of his being so they have the world's
[46:25] greatest proven resources underground
[46:27] oil but it wouldn't matter if they paved
[46:31] the streets with gold it's not going to
[46:33] help because they are cursed thanks to
[46:36] him so now with all this oil other stuff
[46:39] they're starving there's no medicine you
[46:43] take your chitta sick childhood the
[46:44] doctor he prescribed something you go
[46:46] it's not available
[46:47] you know they closed the border with
[46:51] with Colombian with Brazil so people
[46:53] don't escape no go over there by nice
[46:54] stuff and bring home a lots of problems
[46:57] okay so what do we do just sit here and
[46:59] well pray for y'all know we help them
[47:01] we're sending thousands of dollars of
[47:04] rice beans soap toothpaste a lot of
[47:08] stuff from Miami to them and they're
[47:11] helping hundreds of families other
[47:12] people send them cash because there are
[47:14] some there's some food over there they
[47:15] can buy but they're their economy shot
[47:18] they're up to 4000 percent inflation it
[47:22] doesn't work so it's a
[47:25] so we're helping them okay that's one
[47:26] thing another thing that's going on we
[47:29] have a radio broadcast and I know it
[47:32] doesn't sound like much because
[47:37] Americans don't listen to the radio you
[47:39] know but Spanish people do listen to the
[47:42] radio there's two broadcasts ones in
[47:46] Honduras goes out all over Honduras and
[47:49] as the message goes out I think two or
[47:52] three times a week over the hills and
[47:56] the mountains they're listening and they
[47:59] say hey please send somebody we've got
[48:01] three people want to be baptized
[48:02] eventually there's about a group that
[48:05] will send a brother and now there's a
[48:06] church there that's happened many times
[48:08] so that's one broadcast that's working
[48:10] out real well another broadcast is over
[48:13] here on the border of Arizona and Mexico
[48:16] and it goes out every Friday night
[48:18] tonight for example and it's reaching
[48:22] out where we can't go
[48:24] people listen oh that's good okay so one
[48:28] of the men that heard the broadcast he
[48:30] was in jail maximum security and so he
[48:36] heard it somehow hey this is good I like
[48:39] that now what's on the broadcast
[48:40] well there's singing good music there's
[48:43] praying and there's prophet speaking
[48:48] translated tape so they're hearing in
[48:50] English in Spanish so the this fellow
[48:53] heard it and he said man this is good so
[48:56] he sent down through his people because
[48:57] he's in maximum-security so it has to go
[48:59] through his lawyer and everybody
[49:00] eventually get down to the brother that
[49:02] they can do something about it and he
[49:04] said you have any literature so they
[49:07] sent him the the little booklet my life
[49:09] story and the how the angel came to me
[49:11] it's got a little drawing on the front
[49:12] so they sent that to him man this is
[49:15] good well he just happens to be the
[49:18] number one bad guy of the world right
[49:19] now and he's got people everywhere he
[49:22] said I need 10,000 copies of this for my
[49:24] people well we don't have 10,000 copies
[49:28] so we put the text on a memory stick
[49:32] give that to his people and with his
[49:35] money
[49:37] he published 10,000 copies and a few
[49:40] other things now how many of you people
[49:42] here there's probably a hundred and ten
[49:44] people here right or less how many of
[49:46] you people have someone that you know
[49:48] that's on drugs and can't get off this
[49:51] ratio it's okay we're not going to turn
[49:53] you in to the FBI or anything okay so
[49:55] you know how desperate people are to
[49:57] have that stuff whether it's pills
[50:00] whether it's coming from the south or
[50:01] Horwitz from and so they've got to have
[50:04] it
[50:04] right somebody's got to bring it it's
[50:08] called supply and demand now the problem
[50:12] is that to get it from the growers the
[50:14] processors to your relatives and such
[50:16] there's a long process and so they're
[50:21] fighting over that who drives the truck
[50:23] we're in here people getting killed
[50:25] every day in Mexico alone just since the
[50:28] 1st of January there's over a hundred
[50:31] people being killed just in the
[50:33] trafficking of the drugs thousands have
[50:36] been killed over the last few years so
[50:38] this man's in jail the last thing he
[50:41] said when he was sent to New York when I
[50:44] get a little bit of Liberty I'm gonna
[50:46] call you guys come baptize me so his
[50:49] heart's already been turned he already
[50:51] realizes the value of the gospel he
[50:53] rises the value of this message he has
[50:57] put his money into it now there is cases
[51:01] like the thief on the cross never get
[51:04] baptized that's something in the world
[51:05] you know it happens some have repented
[51:09] and come to the Lord and when their
[51:12] bosses saw that cut their head off
[51:14] never got baptized yeah just the last
[51:16] few months well so this man has a wife
[51:20] over in California and she hasn't been
[51:25] able see him for a year because he's
[51:26] been in jail in Manhattan since 20th of
[51:29] January last year well anyway she says
[51:33] you know I've seen the change in him and
[51:36] I've seen the change in my dad was in
[51:38] jail in Mexico I want that same Jesus
[51:42] so he's our sister now she's been
[51:44] baptized she's studying the church age
[51:46] book she's seen what this is all about
[51:48] she almost got to church the Phoenix
[51:50] Sunday but didn't get there but anyway
[51:54] things are happening you know because of
[51:58] the gospel going out you know and so we
[52:01] just know that one of these days we're
[52:04] gonna call and we'll be able to go over
[52:08] and baptize this man so you pray now
[52:11] Jonah Jonah had a direct commission from
[52:15] God didn't have to pray about it you
[52:18] have to go consult anybody go preach to
[52:20] the enemy their wickedness has come up
[52:21] before me I can't stand anymore go
[52:23] preach to him okay only one problem
[52:26] Jonah was Jewish and the people of
[52:30] Nineveh were Gentiles very serious
[52:33] segregation okay now Nineveh at that
[52:37] time was the capital of Assyria
[52:39] currently northern Iraq very wicked
[52:42] sinful people very cruel violent city of
[52:45] over 120,000 people it was a large city
[52:48] took three days to walk around it and
[52:50] these Assyrians were constantly
[52:53] tormenting there's realigns so that
[52:55] didn't start in 1948 that started 3,000
[52:58] years ago
[52:59] they're always insults or he's been the
[53:02] target okay
[53:03] so God was sending his prophet right
[53:05] into the jaws of danger to face the
[53:08] enemy goal cry against it okay
[53:10] it was time for repentance it was time
[53:12] for warning God always sends a warning
[53:15] before judgment nobody goes straight to
[53:17] hell you have to go by the cross to get
[53:18] there you see and so when Jesus was here
[53:22] he did many miracles in many cities but
[53:28] there was three towns in particular
[53:29] where he did miracles and ministered and
[53:31] they paid no attention
[53:33] uh-huh it was Bethsaida
[53:36] courts him and the worst was Capernaum
[53:39] it's in your Bible now Israel doing very
[53:45] well thank you
[53:46] they've come up from 0 to first world
[53:49] country in seven less than 70 years but
[53:51] those three spots are not inhabited
[53:54] it's a pile of rocks in Capernaum
[53:58] there's a monastery the Catholics have
[54:01] built some things don't get scared
[54:03] thanks to the Catholics there's
[54:04] something to go over there and see
[54:06] they're preserving it because my friends
[54:09] the brand of mites would have brought it
[54:10] all home by now
[54:13] now you think it's crazy I was over
[54:16] there and our dear friend
[54:19] Monaco cumbias was with me so we're in
[54:23] this place upon the Mount Carmel and
[54:28] that's where the Carmelite nuns come
[54:29] from now Carmel there's a big convent
[54:32] and everything so there's a cave this
[54:33] they say this is the cave of Elijah it
[54:36] may have been I don't know there's no
[54:37] sign you know it's just tradition so
[54:40] it's inside this church so we go in
[54:42] there to pray and just to see and take
[54:43] pictures and we get back on the bus and
[54:47] money goes hands are all black want to
[54:50] go what do you been doing bud well I was
[54:52] looking for a loose rock in that cave
[54:54] [Laughter]
[54:57] just want to wring his neck you know but
[55:02] thanks to the Catholics they have
[55:04] preserved these places that's nothing to
[55:07] be scared of I know the Catholics the
[55:09] the some relative of the main patriarch
[55:12] was a friend of ours but anyway Israel
[55:16] is doing fine they're in their homeland
[55:18] and if you want to go we got five trips
[55:21] going this year and we'll talk business
[55:23] after church just get your checkbook
[55:25] ready now the reason that I even say
[55:30] that is because brother Bram told me if
[55:32] you ever get to go your Bible with a new
[55:35] book well sure enough and all those
[55:37] hundreds that have been with me in the
[55:38] last 37 trips their Bible has become a
[55:41] new book now if you don't love the Bible
[55:44] then save your money and go to the
[55:46] Disney World
[55:46] stay out of my face you just go spend it
[55:49] somewhere else but if you love the Bible
[55:51] it will be more to you it's okay to
[55:55] laugh in church then we're here to have
[55:57] a good time
[55:59] okay so but when when God you know spoke
[56:06] this curse and you capernum the worst of
[56:08] all of them and give him the big blast
[56:11] nothing happened life went on 60 years
[56:15] later when nobody was thinking the
[56:17] earthquake came all into the dread into
[56:20] the Sea of Galilee when brother bran had
[56:23] spoken choosing my bride in Los Angeles
[56:24] in 1965 mm-hmm
[56:27] you know all he said about that and
[56:30] here's 60 years later almost and big
[56:35] chunks are falling in but he said it's
[56:37] gonna be a piece three to four hundred
[56:38] miles wide that goes in their zone
[56:41] almost 1,500 miles long the whole coast
[56:45] slide in and Hollywood got such a an
[56:49] inspiration they made that film 2012
[56:52] they did a pretty good job now after
[56:56] seeing that what you want to move over
[56:57] there and put your kids in school I
[56:58] don't think so I guess what I've been
[57:01] down that Coast there's about a dozen
[57:02] churches just like you they have a
[57:06] different revelation okay so why is this
[57:10] important to us over in 2018 because
[57:12] first Corinthians 10 all these things
[57:14] happen to them
[57:14] for examples and they're written for our
[57:16] admonition for us to learn from upon
[57:19] whom the ends of the world are come the
[57:21] ends of the world weren't coming on them
[57:22] they're coming on us we're the endtime
[57:24] generation see the end the end of the
[57:27] ages is at the door all the signs are
[57:30] pointing that way you see and so the
[57:32] world is falling apart now once again we
[57:35] have a message of warning before
[57:37] judgment okay and it's very simple
[57:40] message right to the point repent or
[57:42] perish with the unbelievers you have a
[57:44] choice you see and so you can choose so
[57:48] what we need is a shaking we need to
[57:51] shake off the shackles of sin this
[57:53] attitude of who cares of non concern we
[57:56] need a trimming off you see a cutting
[57:59] away of the lazy idle no interest
[58:01] attitude and all the idolatry right in
[58:06] our Bible it's always and watch out for
[58:09] a dollar tree
[58:10] you know and so it's very important now
[58:12] we're far beyond a pill or now Excel sir
[58:16] and you're gonna be okay and just come
[58:18] to church and pay your $2.00 and you
[58:20] know my way past that we need some
[58:23] serious surgery you see so we need the
[58:26] truth we cannot afford to go on play in
[58:30] church it's high time that we actively
[58:32] seek each one of us seek the presence of
[58:34] the Living God and bring our lives into
[58:37] line with the scripture which harmonizes
[58:39] perfectly with the message of the hour
[58:42] it's not like our friends in Salt Lake
[58:44] City that it's you know stuck on to the
[58:47] Bible there's doesn't harmonize with the
[58:49] scripture ours harmonizes that's why we
[58:52] don't just have the Bible and a bunch of
[58:54] books no our prophets message is simply
[58:58] the advanced of the scripture it's the
[59:01] amplified version of the scriptures very
[59:03] simple okay so we have to find our
[59:08] closet find our prayer time how we
[59:10] completes him and find his will for our
[59:13] individual lives now we expect brother
[59:16] Samuel to live that life wall just right
[59:18] straight can't drive a brand new car
[59:20] can't have nothing fancy because you
[59:21] know pastor and all that what about
[59:23] y'all we're in this together you know
[59:26] and so Hebrews 13:8 is for everybody not
[59:30] just the Prophet it's for everybody you
[59:33] see now in 1st John 4:20 says if a man
[59:36] says I love God and hates his brother
[59:38] he's a liar and we're all it's one time
[59:42] another been real good Liars for he that
[59:45] loveth not his brother whom he has seen
[59:47] how could he love God whom he's not seen
[59:50] so however we treat each other brother
[59:53] to brother Sister to Sister
[59:55] that's how we treat God see your brother
[59:59] in need well then you drop everything go
[1:00:01] help him you know just like it was your
[1:00:03] own son so that's the way we treat each
[1:00:05] other you see so he's watching our
[1:00:07] reaction to every test now God could
[1:00:10] solve all your problems before the Sun
[1:00:12] comes up put money in your bank account
[1:00:15] you know polish your car and all the
[1:00:17] things you need before the Sun comes up
[1:00:21] it expects you to put in your part
[1:00:24] and so he lets these tests go on and on
[1:00:27] because you got a lot more patience than
[1:00:29] I have so he lets these tests these
[1:00:31] trials go on you know in he's watching
[1:00:34] your reaction he's watching the reaction
[1:00:35] of all the other people you know he can
[1:00:38] solve it all but he's watching you for
[1:00:40] the reactions you see so Jonah is God's
[1:00:46] man of the hour back then okay
[1:00:47] he had a clear-cut decision from God a
[1:00:50] commandment from God go cry against
[1:00:53] their sin and their corruption I know
[1:00:55] all about the segregation and all about
[1:00:58] your fears and your doubts go any way
[1:01:00] God equips when he sends God provides
[1:01:04] when he sends you know and so back over
[1:01:07] here in Jonah chapter 1 verse 3 but
[1:01:12] Jonah he was human prophets or humans I
[1:01:17] can show you where our prophet says
[1:01:19] anointed prophets make wrong decisions
[1:01:22] as scary but they're humans ok but Jonah
[1:01:28] rose up to flee to Tarshish from the
[1:01:32] presence of the Lord and he went down to
[1:01:34] Joppa and he found his ship going to
[1:01:36] Tarshish so he paid the fare thereof and
[1:01:39] went down into it to go with them to
[1:01:41] Tarshish from the presence of the Lord
[1:01:43] as he missed it the first time he had a
[1:01:46] plan God told him to do certain thing
[1:01:48] it's like here we are in Lorraine and so
[1:01:52] God says my son I want you to go to
[1:01:54] Indianapolis and take care of you know I
[1:01:56] rather he says once you go to Toronto go
[1:02:01] northeast go up there and preach against
[1:02:04] it so he comes out of the house the next
[1:02:05] day I thought nobody was looking and
[1:02:08] instead of going towards Toronto he goes
[1:02:10] towards Indianapolis 180 degrees
[1:02:13] opposite and it says right there in the
[1:02:15] Bible and thank God we have a Bible with
[1:02:17] all the details whatever to guess and
[1:02:20] says he he went down to the coast went
[1:02:23] down to the where the boats are and you
[1:02:24] had to find one going from the presence
[1:02:27] of the Lord
[1:02:28] president the Lord was obey him go my
[1:02:30] way go this is the will of God go here
[1:02:31] but he says no I think I'll go this way
[1:02:34] so I had to look for that boat that's
[1:02:36] going the wrong way
[1:02:38] it's on the coast of the Mediterranean
[1:02:40] Israel because you don't remember the
[1:02:43] globe it's got the Israel there and so
[1:02:45] he found the one going there he got down
[1:02:47] his pocket guys $10 if somebody gave him
[1:02:50] and he paid the fare and I didn't have
[1:02:52] his prophet coat on he looked like
[1:02:54] everybody else he was trying to hide
[1:02:56] he's trying to be mr. cool and get by
[1:03:01] like our brother Peter at that time now
[1:03:05] well going to this just for a minute
[1:03:07] Peter is with the Lord they're there
[1:03:11] they're at the Garden of Gethsemane or
[1:03:14] they're going there and Jesus says now
[1:03:16] has anybody got a weapon well yeah we
[1:03:19] got two swords done so we get there
[1:03:22] because jesus knew what was coming see
[1:03:24] and so they get over there and he's
[1:03:27] already told him look it's gonna get
[1:03:28] tough guys they're coming after me and
[1:03:30] this and this and this is gonna happen
[1:03:31] so they get there and here comes these
[1:03:33] guys with these torches and they had
[1:03:36] Judas with him now Jesus looked like
[1:03:37] everybody else they didn't know who he
[1:03:40] was which one is he other one I kiss so
[1:03:43] he goes through and gives Jesus a kiss
[1:03:45] on the cheek now they know who he is
[1:03:47] bought Peter unrepentant Peter the one
[1:03:51] that had the keys the one that done all
[1:03:53] these great miracles and all the things
[1:03:54] that happen with Peter now
[1:03:56] comes up with him gets that sword out
[1:03:59] whack it takes this guy's ear off right
[1:04:02] now the years sitting on the ground and
[1:04:06] they're all looking geez picks up the
[1:04:09] near but something they all should have
[1:04:12] been on their knees right then you are
[1:04:15] the son of God no life goes on
[1:04:19] they took him and they got him over
[1:04:21] there it's about six hundred yards over
[1:04:22] to Caiaphas his house and they got him
[1:04:25] over there in a dungeon now somehow
[1:04:28] Peter got it sorry self into the
[1:04:31] courtyard now he's over there and it's
[1:04:35] it's it's a still early spring it's kind
[1:04:37] of cool so they got a little fire going
[1:04:39] it wasn't his fire it's the enemy's fire
[1:04:42] he's warming his fisherman's hand there
[1:04:44] by the fire and so he's remember he's
[1:04:46] from up in the north
[1:04:48] the country they got another accent it's
[1:04:50] like when the Canadians come over here
[1:04:52] you know they speak different so so he's
[1:04:56] from up there and so when she came by
[1:04:58] serving the tea when he said thank you
[1:05:00] oh you're one of them never heard of him
[1:05:03] big old curse word came out because
[1:05:05] Jesus already told him that Peter it's
[1:05:07] gonna get bad and and you're gonna curse
[1:05:10] me three times before the Sun for the
[1:05:12] rooster crows me Lord I'm Peter I know
[1:05:15] that's the problem of your Peter your
[1:05:18] unrepented and when you get straightened
[1:05:20] out help the Brethren but in the
[1:05:21] meantime you might want to just keep it
[1:05:23] shut but he couldn't do that so he
[1:05:27] sneaks in there he tried to sneak in and
[1:05:29] look real cool like like Jonah yeah
[1:05:32] how'd you sneak in you know there's a
[1:05:33] brother story they told me once about a
[1:05:34] fella that had a we got a job way off
[1:05:38] someplace and so he had you know leave
[1:05:39] the church and go go on this job for
[1:05:41] three months and they were people were
[1:05:43] really praying for him because one of
[1:05:44] the poor brothers over there and no
[1:05:46] fellowship or nothing no tapes no
[1:05:47] nothing so when he came back they they
[1:05:52] said well how'd it go on oh well just
[1:05:53] fine no opposition nobody make fun of it
[1:05:56] oh no they never even know I was
[1:05:58] Christian
[1:05:59] imagine that so anyway here's brothers
[1:06:03] Jonah he's down here he pays the fare
[1:06:06] and and he gets on this boat and it's
[1:06:08] like a merchant boat were there taking
[1:06:10] Goods you know from from Israel over to
[1:06:13] Tarsus
[1:06:14] I got bananas and all kinds of stuff and
[1:06:15] so he's down there he goes down he goes
[1:06:18] to sleep you know well they start to
[1:06:21] have a big problem because this guy's
[1:06:23] you know he's we're not gonna say he's
[1:06:26] out of the little Lord but he's made
[1:06:27] some decisions here you see him and so
[1:06:29] he goes down through there and in verse
[1:06:32] three he went okay fled from the Lord
[1:06:35] but the Lord sent out a great wind into
[1:06:38] the sea now these guys if they knew
[1:06:39] there was a storm coming they wouldn't
[1:06:41] have took off you're a little smarter
[1:06:43] than that they're gonna stay until it's
[1:06:44] good weather well they take off now the
[1:06:46] big storm comes up and they start
[1:06:48] pitching the stuff off the boat because
[1:06:50] they don't want to sink and they they're
[1:06:56] praying to their gods no response
[1:06:58] whatsoever where is that tourists we let
[1:07:00] on here let's go find here maybe he
[1:07:02] know something well he got a finally got
[1:07:05] up there and oh well he knew what the
[1:07:06] problem was he said look guys I know
[1:07:08] what you can do if you'll just throw me
[1:07:11] overboard everything will be okay so the
[1:07:14] scripture says that God had this this
[1:07:16] special fish time we're not gonna give
[1:07:18] what it was but it was a big special
[1:07:19] fish and so the fish comes along he's
[1:07:21] thrown ride along the boat
[1:07:22] he's waiting so when they pitched Jonah
[1:07:25] out he barely got wet because he went
[1:07:27] right in right so now he's in the fish
[1:07:31] and it's looking pretty bad you know and
[1:07:36] he's down in this fish now he didn't
[1:07:41] break relationship with God he was still
[1:07:43] God's son he's still you know believer
[1:07:46] but he broke the fellowship just like
[1:07:48] happens in our life when we break
[1:07:50] fellowship whether it's with mom and dad
[1:07:52] whether it's whoever it hurts now you're
[1:07:54] still a son and then we're gonna go get
[1:07:56] you but it's not good you see and so
[1:08:00] here he is in this in this fish now the
[1:08:06] the fact is there's no surprises with
[1:08:08] God God knew or you're gonna be tonight
[1:08:11] he knew who's not gonna be here because
[1:08:14] he y'all made the right decision not to
[1:08:16] come hear me but to be insurance I mean
[1:08:18] fellowship hear the word other people we
[1:08:20] don't know who they are the empty seats
[1:08:23] never scare me I'm just wanting
[1:08:25] everybody that's here to get something
[1:08:26] to take home to see but some you know
[1:08:29] it's Friday 9:00 well you know we got to
[1:08:31] do this go do that got a caught a Costco
[1:08:33] and got to go eat and all this stuff you
[1:08:35] know they say we're having a recession
[1:08:37] sometimes but you try to get in
[1:08:39] restaurants on Friday night well anyway
[1:08:43] so you made the right decision now he's
[1:08:47] in this he's in this fish and the
[1:08:49] miracle is that he could live in the
[1:08:51] fish see that there was oxygen in the
[1:08:53] fish that he could live okay now he's
[1:08:55] got seaweed all around him he's up to
[1:08:59] his waist in fish vomit
[1:09:04] it's bad yeah yeah and of course she
[1:09:07] couldn't see a thing it's dark it's
[1:09:09] Blacky you know every place he put his
[1:09:11] hand it's that soft fish-belly you know
[1:09:15] and he couldn't quit breathing but you
[1:09:17] know he just had to put up with it you
[1:09:18] know when you go into a bad situation
[1:09:20] where poor things don't smell good you
[1:09:22] notice that after you're there for about
[1:09:23] an hour you don't smell it so he kind of
[1:09:26] got used to that now he got he learned
[1:09:29] to keep his mouth shut because you just
[1:09:33] don't taste it now he could hear he can
[1:09:38] hear the growling of the other fish
[1:09:39] stomach you know because the fish is on
[1:09:41] the bottom of the ocean there breasting
[1:09:42] so the stomach's are rolling and he's in
[1:09:45] there it was bad he had bad symptoms so
[1:09:49] when you think you got problems yeah how
[1:09:53] big are your problems anyway nothing
[1:09:54] compared to his are they some of them
[1:09:57] you got your own self into like he did
[1:09:59] but if you're God's child he will bring
[1:10:02] out okay okay so symptoms everywhere and
[1:10:06] he had plenty of time to reflect on his
[1:10:10] actions and his decision up here in
[1:10:12] verse three to go from the presence of
[1:10:15] the Lord he did that willingly he knew
[1:10:18] exactly he went 180 degrees opposite to
[1:10:20] where the Lord told him so he had time
[1:10:23] to think about it and the other thing is
[1:10:25] he didn't know how long this is going to
[1:10:27] be no nobody told him it's three days he
[1:10:31] probably thought this is it well I don't
[1:10:32] know it's gonna last but I hope I
[1:10:34] survive somehow but he's in this fish
[1:10:36] and so he closed his eyes you know and
[1:10:39] closed his mouth
[1:10:40] he said these symptoms are all lying
[1:10:42] Vanity's that'd be hard to do when it's
[1:10:46] so real you know so he was very much
[1:10:49] alive he could touch taste couldn't see
[1:10:52] get here he can smell and God supplied
[1:10:54] the oxygen now so he prayed very
[1:10:57] earnestly that's when you really get
[1:10:58] serious you know and this wasn't part of
[1:11:01] the bargain I mean that ten dollars I
[1:11:03] spent look what I got you know wasn't
[1:11:04] part of the bargain unforeseen
[1:11:06] circumstances I thought it would be
[1:11:07] different how many times we heard that
[1:11:09] amongst these followers well I thought
[1:11:10] it'd be different I thought the Lord
[1:11:11] would come by now I thought we don't
[1:11:13] care what you think let's go to the word
[1:11:15] you know
[1:11:16] and I've heard people according to my
[1:11:18] calculations I don't care about your
[1:11:20] calculations and I got this all figured
[1:11:22] out well guess what every time figured
[1:11:24] out come down the bottom zero because it
[1:11:26] doesn't work Solomon was smart enough to
[1:11:29] say it's all vanity forget it so the
[1:11:32] symptoms are very real but he had to
[1:11:34] ignore the the present reality and focus
[1:11:37] his mind on the Word of God that he had
[1:11:39] stored he didn't have an iPod didn't
[1:11:44] have a phone to call you know
[1:11:45] headquarters nothing what he had stored
[1:11:48] that's why it's important not that you
[1:11:50] listened to score me on the radio but
[1:11:52] get into your Bible and read two pages
[1:11:54] every day real simple everybody can do
[1:11:58] it you see and so he had this story and
[1:12:02] he didn't have a Bible didn't have any
[1:12:04] prophetic manuscripts no pictures
[1:12:05] nothing he got serious so in chapter 2
[1:12:08] one through nine he's praying now we
[1:12:12] didn't know he didn't know was gonna be
[1:12:13] three days but he's praying very very
[1:12:16] earnestly now our prophet says the
[1:12:18] devils tremble when the weakest of
[1:12:20] saints go to their knees the one that
[1:12:23] repented last night when he kneels the
[1:12:25] devil start to tremble he says what a
[1:12:28] power and a privilege has been given to
[1:12:30] the Church of the Living God when you
[1:12:32] fall to your knees in prayer even the
[1:12:34] Devils tremble to the weakest of them
[1:12:37] think about it in another place and the
[1:12:39] weakest Christian here tonight can
[1:12:40] defeat Satan anywhere any place any time
[1:12:43] under any circumstances with thus saith
[1:12:46] the Lord you just believe it God said so
[1:12:50] that conquers everything you don't have
[1:12:53] any problems did anybody walk to church
[1:12:56] tonight no we all come in a nice car
[1:12:59] right it's got a heater
[1:13:00] it's got wipers you know so we don't
[1:13:05] have problems not compared to what he's
[1:13:07] going through so why is he in this
[1:13:09] situation well apparently okay
[1:13:12] apparently he shirked away he tried to
[1:13:15] evade his duty he ran from his
[1:13:18] responsibility he ran from the presence
[1:13:20] of God right there the scripture he ran
[1:13:23] from the will of God he opted for his
[1:13:24] own will our subject my will or God's
[1:13:28] will is
[1:13:29] the only fellowship was broken not the
[1:13:32] relationship so every one of you made a
[1:13:34] choice to come here today and of course
[1:13:37] in every group there's three kinds of
[1:13:38] believers now I don't know who the make
[1:13:41] believers are you know I don't know who
[1:13:42] each category when brother Branham
[1:13:45] preached the message three kinds of
[1:13:46] believers he could have had three colors
[1:13:50] hats here white yellow and red maybe and
[1:13:54] he could have said now you Deacon put
[1:13:55] these on on those guys and put these on
[1:13:57] those guys he could have done that
[1:13:59] because he knew who's who
[1:14:00] he had discernment I don't have that
[1:14:02] discernment no he simply preached the
[1:14:05] gospel and then he said no when you
[1:14:08] leave here your commentaries about this
[1:14:10] service will show which one you are so
[1:14:13] when you get over there drinking coffee
[1:14:15] tonight and you make comments about the
[1:14:18] song leader or about me and the pastor
[1:14:21] not having enough hair will know which
[1:14:24] one you are okay
[1:14:27] Lord helps okay so we're past the
[1:14:32] believers now he made a choice Jonah
[1:14:36] made a choice he's willing to pay the
[1:14:38] price and go another way he just didn't
[1:14:42] have any idea how high the price was
[1:14:43] gonna be and we get ourselves into
[1:14:46] situations sometimes we think well we'll
[1:14:48] do this and that
[1:14:49] who would price gets real big we should
[1:14:51] have gone the other way you know well
[1:14:53] anyway he chose to go in the opposite
[1:14:56] direction okay
[1:14:57] and he probably thought well you know
[1:14:58] there's probably all kinds of sinful
[1:15:00] people or in tarnishes and you know
[1:15:02] they're they're more like me and and I
[1:15:04] could preach them without any hassle
[1:15:05] without in our position and God would
[1:15:07] have blessed his word okay
[1:15:10] he always blesses the preaching of his
[1:15:11] word but obedience is far better than
[1:15:14] sacrifice and I'm sure you got
[1:15:17] testimonies we could be the rest of the
[1:15:18] night talking about that but you know we
[1:15:21] have right here in this within a 20 mile
[1:15:24] radius
[1:15:24] we've got Catholics we got Baptists we
[1:15:27] got charismatic got all kinds of people
[1:15:28] we got some people say they believe in
[1:15:30] Malachi 4 they never darken the doors of
[1:15:32] any Church you know and so we got these
[1:15:34] kind of people around they're using the
[1:15:36] same Bible and many are being blessed
[1:15:39] they're getting healed miracles
[1:15:41] everything because they believed
[1:15:42] approaching God God honors faith there's
[1:15:47] Catholic churches we can go to they've
[1:15:49] got a room the size of this church lined
[1:15:51] with crutches where they've been healed
[1:15:54] walked away they believe they're
[1:15:57] approaching God God honors faith brother
[1:16:00] Brennan says in thirsting for life and
[1:16:01] this great pillar of fire the angel of
[1:16:04] God the logos that went out of God that
[1:16:07] led the children of Israel through the
[1:16:08] wilderness when it came among the people
[1:16:10] it separate itself and great licks of
[1:16:12] fire began to come up on each one as the
[1:16:14] pillar fire began to break up God
[1:16:16] dividing himself among his people
[1:16:18] that ought to tear the heart out of
[1:16:20] anybody God tearing himself apart that
[1:16:23] he might divide himself a little bit to
[1:16:25] each one of us and we look at it as
[1:16:28] blessing but he says it ought to shake
[1:16:30] us you know he says can you see now why
[1:16:32] I am standing for the unity of every
[1:16:35] church ok comma starts to narrow down
[1:16:40] every full gospel church every believer
[1:16:43] so we can cut to the chase can you see
[1:16:45] why I'm standing for the unity of every
[1:16:48] believer we ought to be of one heart one
[1:16:52] mind one Accord no matter how much we
[1:16:55] differ in the scriptures it's going to
[1:16:57] happen or our favorite quotations or our
[1:17:01] hero preachers he says that might be say
[1:17:04] one might see it this way but that way
[1:17:07] has nothing to do with it but in
[1:17:08] principle we have to stand one great
[1:17:11] mighty army of God marching on not
[1:17:14] standing still not going around a circle
[1:17:16] of marching on because each one of you
[1:17:18] in your peculiar injury now you're
[1:17:22] looking at one person I'm looking at all
[1:17:24] of yous I see all the peculiarities you
[1:17:28] see
[1:17:29] so in our peculiarities as God has
[1:17:31] proved that is ignoring your doctrine
[1:17:33] hmm because he gave you the Holy Ghost
[1:17:35] in the Bible said he gave them the Holy
[1:17:37] Ghost of those that obeyed him it's an
[1:17:39] acts 5:32 now if I obeyed him in my
[1:17:42] peculiar way and you obeyed him in your
[1:17:44] peculiar way he gave us both the Holy
[1:17:46] Ghost we ought to be Christian brethren
[1:17:48] and sisters enough to arm up together
[1:17:50] that means lock arms march forward arm
[1:17:54] up together and March on for the gray
[1:17:56] purpose the gospel there's our orders
[1:17:59] right there now you're listening to the
[1:18:02] same tapes and everything the same Bible
[1:18:04] I have why can't we do that because
[1:18:06] we're listening to certain things see
[1:18:08] we've been taught wrong you know but
[1:18:11] unto us
[1:18:11] you see he's trusted and revealed the
[1:18:14] mysteries of the kingdom we're not just
[1:18:16] anybody you see God doesn't hold those
[1:18:18] people out there accountable for what
[1:18:20] he's holding you accountable
[1:18:21] God has trusted you with the secrets of
[1:18:24] his word the fullness of the revelation
[1:18:25] see so God has a perfect will and he has
[1:18:29] a permissive will for each of us okay he
[1:18:32] says over here in 1965 we try to work on
[1:18:37] God's permissive will and he will permit
[1:18:39] it but also if we take his permissive
[1:18:41] will though it's not right he will make
[1:18:43] his permissive will work out to glorify
[1:18:45] His perfect will but there will be a
[1:18:47] price see you go wrong little costly get
[1:18:50] back in another message this God changed
[1:18:54] his mind we must submit ourselves to his
[1:18:56] will and his word don't question it
[1:18:59] believe it don't try to find a way
[1:19:01] around it just take it the way it is so
[1:19:05] many wants to go around get some other
[1:19:06] way when you do you find yourself going
[1:19:08] on find God blessing but you're working
[1:19:12] in his permissive will and not in his
[1:19:14] divine perfect will so I travel a lot
[1:19:18] see a lot of churches a lot of people
[1:19:20] thought I'm similar to you and they
[1:19:24] always have questions people have lots
[1:19:26] of questions and you would think that
[1:19:28] after you know being in the message a
[1:19:30] while that they would be solved no they
[1:19:32] have questions don't tell about the
[1:19:35] church and Africa yesterday about the
[1:19:37] ring okay so people have questions so
[1:19:40] one of the questions how can I know the
[1:19:45] will of God for my life everybody under
[1:19:48] 30 wants to know the perfect will of God
[1:19:50] for their life you know well there's a
[1:19:52] real simple formula God's Word and God's
[1:19:55] Spirit and God's will always run in
[1:19:57] parallel they don't find each other they
[1:20:00] run in parallel they harmonize you know
[1:20:02] and so the word the will in the spirit
[1:20:07] they agree
[1:20:09] now some people have a portion of the
[1:20:12] word memorized to the very letter they
[1:20:14] have their favorite parts you know Jesus
[1:20:16] wept or whatever they'll memorize those
[1:20:18] favorite parts and to the letter but the
[1:20:22] wires are crossed and they display a
[1:20:24] contrary spirit you see and there's no
[1:20:27] harmony with the rest of the word they
[1:20:29] have bad fruits the results are contrary
[1:20:32] to the word in John 4 23 and 24 says God
[1:20:35] is seeking those that will serve and
[1:20:37] worship Him in spirit and in truth and
[1:20:40] that's why that we bring this little
[1:20:44] level here we'll see if we have a place
[1:20:45] to put it that we must have balance let
[1:20:52] you pull that's good that's good okay
[1:20:54] [Laughter]
[1:20:57] without balance you're gonna get
[1:21:00] fanatical you go one way or the other
[1:21:02] you must stay balanced okay now brother
[1:21:07] brown says overhearing questions and
[1:21:08] answers how do you feel it's a question
[1:21:11] how do you feel is the best way to find
[1:21:12] God's will the Lord's will in some
[1:21:15] important matters well that would be for
[1:21:16] everyone it will sort of have that
[1:21:17] question here's the answer I'll tell you
[1:21:20] dear friend the best way to find the
[1:21:22] will of God and some important matters
[1:21:23] is prayer oh we already knew that now
[1:21:28] watch it you need to get a spirit like
[1:21:29] naman real quick here now here's the way
[1:21:32] I do it okay pay attention I take it
[1:21:34] before the Lord and it's always been my
[1:21:36] strength I wait upon the Lord and see
[1:21:38] what he says and I just let myself be
[1:21:40] neutral to it don't take either side now
[1:21:42] that's very hard to do especially when
[1:21:46] boy sees girl and boy wants girl and
[1:21:48] that's not God's will eventually proves
[1:21:52] out right and that's why like I said
[1:21:54] last night and I repeat it again I'll
[1:21:56] say it again tomorrow probably there's
[1:21:58] worse things than going through life
[1:22:00] single look around a lot of them work
[1:22:04] fine like brother Samuel like myself a
[1:22:07] few others but some of them don't worked
[1:22:08] real good okay so you got to be neutral
[1:22:13] about these things
[1:22:14] what's God want so if I was in your
[1:22:16] place and didn't have these visions from
[1:22:17] the Lord yeah he had a bit of a handicap
[1:22:20] I would just wait upon the Lord and say
[1:22:22] Lord now you show me what's the decision
[1:22:24] to make and then the way you feel led to
[1:22:26] do it it's not the end of it the way you
[1:22:30] feel led to do it then wait just a
[1:22:32] little bit prayer and wait that's not
[1:22:35] the 21st century way is it then wait a
[1:22:39] little longer and see which way he leans
[1:22:42] which way the spirit goes now father in
[1:22:44] my heart you know it does not matter but
[1:22:46] I want to know what you want to do about
[1:22:48] it so there's the formula to find God's
[1:22:51] will
[1:22:51] prayer and wait it will work okay now
[1:22:56] with Jonah God did make his permissive
[1:23:00] will turn around to accomplish his
[1:23:02] perfect well okay the special fish
[1:23:05] delivered Jonah on the shore and we'll
[1:23:09] stop right there because you'll listen
[1:23:11] to tape you'll find out the brother Bram
[1:23:12] tells the story about the fact that the
[1:23:17] people in Nineveh worshipped as God of
[1:23:20] the sea the water and so forth of God
[1:23:22] Dagon and so here comes - here comes the
[1:23:25] fish and Jonah walks out on the tongue
[1:23:26] and they all were believed
[1:23:28] okay listen again he says I read that in
[1:23:31] a book if Jonah is is deposited right
[1:23:35] there on the shore by Nineveh then why
[1:23:39] does the word say over here in or is
[1:23:43] that verse 1 of 3 chapter 3 and the word
[1:23:46] of the Lord came again to Jonah the
[1:23:47] second time saying arise go to Nineveh
[1:23:49] that great city because he wasn't there
[1:23:52] yet now this all happened in the
[1:23:56] Mediterranean now for the fish to get to
[1:23:59] Nineveh go study your globe you have to
[1:24:01] go down all the way around Africa and
[1:24:03] come up here and go through the Straits
[1:24:06] of Hormuz and come up the river to
[1:24:08] Nineveh but it just can't happen in
[1:24:10] three days you don't care how special
[1:24:11] the fish is but the he's a saltwater
[1:24:13] fish no he was vomited out right there
[1:24:17] on the shore near where he got on okay
[1:24:19] so now we got this this mighty prophet
[1:24:22] and he's he's covered in vomit smells
[1:24:28] really bad
[1:24:29] now he's pitched that into the sand and
[1:24:31] now he's covered in sand he take your
[1:24:33] kids
[1:24:34] Beach and how did they get well imagine
[1:24:36] a wall with sticky vomit and now they're
[1:24:38] rolling in the sand he had to go to the
[1:24:41] car wash just to get cleaned off before
[1:24:42] he could even get the new clothes you
[1:24:44] know he was in a bad way and so it came
[1:24:48] to him the second time now you might not
[1:24:52] have the luxury of a second time
[1:24:54] that's not promised everybody be better
[1:24:57] if you made the first time they see you
[1:25:00] got to get into action
[1:25:01] the first time he reveals it to you not
[1:25:03] when you feel like it
[1:25:04] I mean grandma gives you the green light
[1:25:06] no now now a long time ago 1955 some of
[1:25:11] you might have a memory that long sure
[1:25:14] you don't but the film came out the 10
[1:25:18] commandments 1955 and so some people had
[1:25:23] seen it they commented to brother
[1:25:24] Branham and he maybe I'll take the
[1:25:27] family to see it ok so they went to this
[1:25:28] theater there's almost sizes Church
[1:25:30] small theater and so they're sitting
[1:25:33] there and he's Sam and his wife and the
[1:25:36] two girls Joseph wasn't born yet so
[1:25:39] they're in this theater and watching the
[1:25:42] film and you know how that does the
[1:25:45] pillar fire comes rolling in he jumps up
[1:25:47] takes off his hat cuz it was perfectly
[1:25:49] right Wow Oh then he realized it's a
[1:25:52] film he sits back down ok so they watch
[1:25:55] the film for four hours now they're
[1:25:56] going home and so Rebecca she would be
[1:26:00] like nine years old the time she's
[1:26:03] crying she's very sensitive little girl
[1:26:06] and so he said well what's wrong honey
[1:26:08] you know we just saw this film yeah but
[1:26:10] dad did you notice when when Moses said
[1:26:14] all that's on the Lord's side come with
[1:26:16] me
[1:26:17] well some people came but she was
[1:26:19] looking at those people back there that
[1:26:21] was dilly-dallying around those people
[1:26:23] that was kind of an ounce if we go what
[1:26:24] do you think you know earth opened up
[1:26:27] swallow so she was worried about those
[1:26:30] people and the fact that God wasn't just
[1:26:33] you know and so he saw this as a
[1:26:39] teaching moment he said well let that be
[1:26:41] a lesson to you young lady when God
[1:26:43] shows you something you move now
[1:26:45] you don't wait around take a vote go and
[1:26:49] so that would have been better for Jonah
[1:26:51] right but Jonah got a second chance okay
[1:26:55] so he got cleaned up
[1:26:57] he went over went to you know we were
[1:27:01] supposed to go and chapter three verses
[1:27:04] five through ten records the reaction of
[1:27:08] the preaching of the word of God it was
[1:27:10] the greatest revival in recorded history
[1:27:13] yeah entire city 120,000 turned to God
[1:27:17] and stayed back the wrath of God they
[1:27:20] had a choice repent or perish with the
[1:27:23] unbelievers but guess what about 150
[1:27:26] years later which is you know it's a
[1:27:28] blink of an eye on God's time 150 years
[1:27:30] later these people forgot about all that
[1:27:34] they entirely departed from God and
[1:27:37] forgot the mercy forgot the forgiveness
[1:27:39] of God and God permitted the babylonians
[1:27:41] to come into the year 621 BC and utterly
[1:27:44] destroy the city okay yeah and so
[1:27:48] devastating was the destruction that the
[1:27:50] ruins weren't even discovered till just
[1:27:52] a hundred years ago now I don't know
[1:27:55] what they used but somehow they
[1:27:57] obliterated Nineveh and they just found
[1:28:01] it you know 2500 years later in such a
[1:28:05] hatred to destroy now when when they had
[1:28:09] the problems in Jerusalem and the Romans
[1:28:11] came in and destroyed because Jesus had
[1:28:14] said simply one day there in Matthew 24
[1:28:16] you know they're showing him the man
[1:28:17] look at this what these people have
[1:28:19] built it was the biggest beautiful most
[1:28:22] thing beautiful thing there was at that
[1:28:23] time it was beautiful temple Hall is
[1:28:25] quite rock and everything in Jesus it's
[1:28:30] gonna come to pass not one Rock left
[1:28:32] upon another he spoke it I had to come
[1:28:35] to pass so just a few years later here
[1:28:38] comes the Romans and the smallest
[1:28:41] building stone that they used over there
[1:28:43] was four tons so they destroyed and they
[1:28:48] pushed it all down and they're still in
[1:28:50] a pile therefore they left him so just
[1:28:56] that that urge to destroy hatred
[1:28:58] well even Scofield says here in the
[1:29:01] Bible such as the way of God light
[1:29:03] rejected brings destruction
[1:29:07] 19:56 brother ran said now America is
[1:29:09] going to decide this year and I think
[1:29:12] they're going to decide wrong 1956 here
[1:29:15] we are all this time later or seeing the
[1:29:18] effects they turned away from God look
[1:29:22] at it you go through the airport then
[1:29:24] really know what bathrooms are going to
[1:29:26] it's so simple they got one with pants
[1:29:29] and one with dresses so everybody pants
[1:29:30] can go in there or dress is going here
[1:29:32] don't work that way doesn't utter
[1:29:36] confusion because in 1964 brother Brent
[1:29:39] said if this goes on the way it is now
[1:29:41] in 50 years that's four years ago in 50
[1:29:47] years it'll be total insanity so it's
[1:29:50] not gonna fix it's gonna get worse okay
[1:29:55] so everything is working right according
[1:30:01] to God's plan now Jonah was in fact a
[1:30:04] very crucial part of a larger picture
[1:30:06] okay we're not gonna throw rocks at him
[1:30:08] he was just part of a big picture see so
[1:30:11] much so that Jesus repeated it over in
[1:30:13] Matthew 12 so when you don't fully
[1:30:15] understand an issue whether it's in your
[1:30:17] family or in the church or in the
[1:30:19] message at large or with dr. you know
[1:30:21] mr. Trump or whoever leave it alone
[1:30:25] that doesn't need your opinions when you
[1:30:28] don't understand something that's going
[1:30:29] on be careful it could be part of a
[1:30:32] bigger picture and God allows certain
[1:30:34] scenes to play out and to bring our
[1:30:37] reactions to the surface you say be
[1:30:39] careful so God has not called me he's
[1:30:42] not caught a brother Samuel or anybody
[1:30:44] else to straighten all the items that we
[1:30:46] think are out of order no this thing's
[1:30:49] gonna work out and God's gonna judge
[1:30:51] those that didn't walk according to his
[1:30:53] word the others he'll take home your Oh
[1:30:56] simple now I would seen the gods man
[1:30:58] God's proffered the Aged God's anointed
[1:31:00] messenger it was seen that he was back
[1:31:02] slidden
[1:31:03] and stepped out of the will of God he
[1:31:05] would seem that way right and it would
[1:31:07] seem that way because we as mortals with
[1:31:09] our little canary brain you know
[1:31:11] all small creatures that we are we make
[1:31:15] judgments when we don't have all the
[1:31:17] facts you don't know what that person's
[1:31:20] going through you don't know why he
[1:31:22] stayed home from a service something's
[1:31:24] going on
[1:31:25] people need the love of God see not
[1:31:27] judgment see so we make these snap
[1:31:30] knee-jerk reactions with partial
[1:31:33] information and we get in trouble leave
[1:31:36] it alone
[1:31:38] we're not God we're not the managers of
[1:31:40] God's bride if you want to you know act
[1:31:43] all high and mighty well we could be
[1:31:45] fruit inspectors but even fruit
[1:31:47] inspectors don't throw it all the way
[1:31:49] they they okay we're gonna put this over
[1:31:51] here you know watch out you see so very
[1:31:56] few people from any given generation
[1:31:58] recognize the value of God's message of
[1:32:01] the hour see hindsight is much greater
[1:32:04] than looking in the future let's see now
[1:32:07] Simeon for example live near the temple
[1:32:09] and every time there was that day of
[1:32:11] dedication a baby she'd go out and look
[1:32:13] look and of course people made fun of
[1:32:15] him what's the old man looking for now
[1:32:16] you know and so but he was spirit led he
[1:32:19] knew what he was looking for him and he
[1:32:21] was one of the few that recognized what
[1:32:23] God was doing in present tense he didn't
[1:32:25] worry about all the other stuff just
[1:32:27] pleasing God you know now brother Brown
[1:32:29] says in questions and answers in 1957 a
[1:32:32] long time ago this city jeffersonville
[1:32:34] at the day of the judgement will answer
[1:32:36] great price some day where there have
[1:32:38] been hundreds and hundreds of
[1:32:40] outstanding healings done right here
[1:32:43] signs and wonders and the appearing of
[1:32:45] the angel down on the river and the
[1:32:48] papers blasted at forth and everything
[1:32:50] and still people don't believe why is it
[1:32:52] now someday I'm going to leave here I'm
[1:32:54] going he says I'm 48 years old now why
[1:32:57] didn't the world recognize that picture
[1:32:59] you know the halo why didn't they catch
[1:33:01] these other things right quick why don't
[1:33:04] they catch these other things
[1:33:05] why don't they catch these prophecies
[1:33:07] and things you know they can't do it now
[1:33:09] but one day I'm going to leave this
[1:33:11] world and when I leave they will
[1:33:13] recognize it some of you young people
[1:33:15] will realize that after I'm gone this
[1:33:18] day these things are fulfilled
[1:33:21] in the harvest time but why did the say
[1:33:25] what did the Luthor's do after the death
[1:33:26] of Martin Luther they met with Satan and
[1:33:29] made a denomination out of it and died
[1:33:32] she never done anything else she's
[1:33:35] become a mass of people to tapes you
[1:33:37] need to listen to soon the world falling
[1:33:41] apart and gotten simplicity from
[1:33:43] Albuquerque New Mexico
[1:33:44] April 63 he says you might not believe
[1:33:48] that but this is taped listen to it a
[1:33:50] few years from today if there is such a
[1:33:52] time then you will know whether it's
[1:33:54] true or not one day when the evening
[1:33:56] lights are breaking forth and it's too
[1:33:57] late then you'll say that man could have
[1:34:00] been right but it's too late then just
[1:34:04] exactly like Jesus said when he was here
[1:34:06] on earth
[1:34:07] he said God sent you prophets down
[1:34:09] through the ages every time the world
[1:34:10] system got out of order you know and
[1:34:13] what did you do with each one God sent
[1:34:15] the Prophet you all put him in the grave
[1:34:16] in other words you killed him and then
[1:34:18] in about another generation you wake up
[1:34:20] and realize that that was a prophet and
[1:34:22] then what did you do you garnish the
[1:34:24] tomb make it nice and verse sorry you
[1:34:27] make a tradition of his life now you
[1:34:31] want to talk about every word you want
[1:34:33] to say what he said I dare you and
[1:34:35] that's exactly what Israel had done
[1:34:38] Moses they made a tradition of his life
[1:34:41] tomorrow is Saturday it's sundown
[1:34:44] tonight their Sabbath starts so they're
[1:34:47] there they're getting ready to go to
[1:34:48] church tomorrow morning around the world
[1:34:50] and they've got a portion of Moses that
[1:34:52] they read all of them read the same
[1:34:54] portion on that Saturday see they made
[1:34:57] her tradition of his life that's the way
[1:35:00] they did with Martin Luther John Wesley
[1:35:03] and other men we are always looking back
[1:35:06] making a tradition of their life
[1:35:08] garnishing their tomb and their message
[1:35:10] was for another day by the time they
[1:35:11] were by the time you wake up the day's
[1:35:13] don't live by and we're in another day
[1:35:15] the whole system has worked that way for
[1:35:17] since the beginning man-made systems
[1:35:19] certainly so my question today well
[1:35:23] brother Rams his life be the exception
[1:35:26] it's not proven out that way is it he's
[1:35:29] proven to follow that same tradition so
[1:35:33] many people are just now realizing
[1:35:35] the value of the message we've had the
[1:35:38] warning so what you don't understand
[1:35:41] what you don't think is right leave it
[1:35:43] alone because you don't have all the
[1:35:45] facts
[1:35:45] be careful so Jonah was God's prophet
[1:35:50] but as a human he looked for the easy
[1:35:52] way see he looked for the way of no
[1:35:54] pressure all to agree with him
[1:35:56] pat him on the back and many kind of
[1:35:58] times God will he will show us his will
[1:36:00] he only didn't indicate it to us then we
[1:36:02] go discuss it with the relatives and
[1:36:04] what do you think and so can we get a
[1:36:06] vote on this and we'll get a consensus
[1:36:07] to see if people to agree with us we're
[1:36:09] looking for the easy way like Jonah
[1:36:11] brother Brent says you have to struggle
[1:36:13] to do the will of God sometimes so it's
[1:36:16] not always easy but it will produce the
[1:36:18] best results Cynthia there in okay got
[1:36:24] to keep my people and so today we have
[1:36:29] many message believers now I used to
[1:36:32] think that everybody carrying these
[1:36:33] little booklets was message believers no
[1:36:36] we got a lot of book carriers and
[1:36:39] amongst the book carriers there's some
[1:36:41] believers okay so we've got these book
[1:36:43] carriers that is willingly you know by
[1:36:45] their own self-will they're climbing
[1:36:46] onto boats headed for Tarsus
[1:36:49] now with Jonah it was 180 degrees but
[1:36:52] today it's only two degrees up look good
[1:36:55] sounds good a little bit rock and roll
[1:36:57] but that's okay you know and anyway we
[1:37:00] go then guess what when it's too late
[1:37:03] because when you start off two degrees
[1:37:05] off it starts going like this and way
[1:37:08] out here when it's too late well it
[1:37:10] looks like this ship of Zion but it's
[1:37:13] not no the rock and roll music got worse
[1:37:17] the preacher starts saying things not
[1:37:18] needing to tape anywhere nope no message
[1:37:20] not even in the Bible and you're it's
[1:37:21] too late because you're way over here
[1:37:23] and you can't get across to the right
[1:37:24] boat you got to come back where you
[1:37:26] started you see and that's happening
[1:37:29] something that looks similar but it's
[1:37:32] way off so may God help us to be aware
[1:37:37] be sure you know what you're doing see
[1:37:40] we can have a leading you can have a
[1:37:42] doctrine you promise out of the pages of
[1:37:45] the Bible but if it's not in the proper
[1:37:48] cease
[1:37:48] flowing in the economy and the plan of
[1:37:50] God for the hour you will be fighting
[1:37:53] the will of God
[1:37:54] you'll be fleeing from the presence the
[1:37:57] Living God thinking and believing that
[1:37:59] you're right but you'll be choosing your
[1:38:02] will and not God's will see not having
[1:38:05] rightly divided the word of truth and
[1:38:07] that's why we need Ephesians 4 because
[1:38:09] God put it in and nobody can take it out
[1:38:11] you see so there will be a price to play
[1:38:14] now in dark later to see how dark is it
[1:38:17] it's very dark a long time ago 1959 and
[1:38:24] to tell you this before dinner
[1:38:26] okay that's one second time here so a
[1:38:29] long time ago 1959 brother Brown was
[1:38:31] preaching in Puerto Rico Haiti and some
[1:38:34] of those islands okay yeah he was there
[1:38:36] twice in Puerto Rico but anyway he's
[1:38:38] down there to Caribbean and one of the
[1:38:41] Americans with him said that he spent
[1:38:43] four hours with him one day and he asked
[1:38:45] him why do you say so much about 1977
[1:38:48] well the first clue is that we don't
[1:38:51] have all the tapes right because we
[1:38:52] don't hear much back then but he had
[1:38:53] said some things and so brother Brennan
[1:38:56] said well it's real simple because when
[1:38:57] I looked through the stream of time of
[1:38:59] course when he's looking three sees
[1:39:00] numbers you know he's seen time he said
[1:39:03] when I looked through the stream of time
[1:39:04] and it was in 1977
[1:39:06] you've got so dark I didn't see any
[1:39:09] believer could live in that darkness
[1:39:10] beside says 18 years out there of course
[1:39:14] the Lord's coming now so nobody's making
[1:39:15] plans well guess what we're 41 years the
[1:39:20] other side now very dark see just
[1:39:24] because you've got a smartphone doesn't
[1:39:26] mean it's high time snow it's very dark
[1:39:28] okay so now we're going to read
[1:39:31] something here that's very important in
[1:39:32] Revelation chapter 4 1961 nowadays
[1:39:36] they're so they said well we don't
[1:39:38] believe in saying hell on the pulpit we
[1:39:41] need men of God men who won't be cold
[1:39:43] back now ever now everybody can't be a
[1:39:47] preacher but you've got a voice if
[1:39:49] you're a preacher you're called to the
[1:39:51] pulpit to preach if you're not you're
[1:39:53] still a preacher but live the people a
[1:39:55] sermon that your sermon be lived
[1:39:58] it's the voice that that lived life that
[1:40:02] you have God let me through you that's
[1:40:03] the voice of God that will bring
[1:40:05] reproach to them who reject it just live
[1:40:07] your sermon you ladies with the long
[1:40:10] hair you don't have to say a word just
[1:40:11] go through the shopping center they'll
[1:40:14] be taking pictures of you there's a lady
[1:40:16] that you know well you know Mindy Mark's
[1:40:20] wife so we went to Israel and she's
[1:40:22] she's only 5 1 and her hair is 5 foot
[1:40:26] long you know her so we go to Israel and
[1:40:30] she does everything with her hair down
[1:40:31] she works in the garden everything okay
[1:40:33] so we're getting Israel and here's
[1:40:36] people taking pictures of the church and
[1:40:38] taking picture of that they see Mindy's
[1:40:39] gonna take picture her well she doesn't
[1:40:43] say a word
[1:40:44] now the people speak against it well it
[1:40:46] says right here that's not gonna go good
[1:40:48] for him but you just just living your
[1:40:50] message
[1:40:50] he says the preacher is called to preach
[1:40:52] his and live it to if you can't live it
[1:40:54] then stop preaching it well about that
[1:40:58] but you're supposed to live your sermons
[1:41:00] how we need in jeffersonville now this
[1:41:03] is a quote has been so misused how we
[1:41:04] needed jeffersonville thousands of lived
[1:41:06] voices in other words manifestations of
[1:41:09] the grace of God the Thunder of God
[1:41:12] thundering out against those who don't
[1:41:15] believe it my way the Thunder of God
[1:41:18] thundering out in sweetness holiness
[1:41:21] purity undefiled lives walking around
[1:41:24] the earth without a blemish that's the
[1:41:27] thunder of God
[1:41:28] yes sir real Christians that's
[1:41:31] thundering is the enemy the devil
[1:41:33] doesn't care how loud you can holler the
[1:41:36] devil doesn't care how much you how you
[1:41:37] can jump or do all this stuff and what
[1:41:40] hurts the devil ah what's gonna hurt the
[1:41:42] devil is to see that sanctified holy
[1:41:45] life consecrated to God say anything you
[1:41:48] want to him call him anything he's just
[1:41:50] as sweet as can be
[1:41:51] moves right on that throws him that's
[1:41:54] the thunder that shakes the devil okay
[1:41:58] so if we turn our back on the word maybe
[1:42:02] not openly like you know Jonah but just
[1:42:05] through indifference through a bad
[1:42:07] attitude well I don't see it his way so
[1:42:09] we're gonna you know
[1:42:11] we're gonna change churches we're gonna
[1:42:12] we're gonna go over here goes man those
[1:42:14] guys just a bad attitude you know
[1:42:16] then we're fleeing from the presence of
[1:42:18] God and following an antichrist spirit
[1:42:21] and an antichrist doctrine sinking real
[1:42:27] deep and soon you will be anointed with
[1:42:29] arrogance selfishness self-righteousness
[1:42:33] respective persons none of which came
[1:42:35] from God so if we deviate one degree off
[1:42:39] sinner now how many of us like to hunt
[1:42:41] got some hunters right okay whew well I
[1:42:44] got a real hunter out west my son but
[1:42:47] you know if we deviate one degree off a
[1:42:50] true center it's just gonna get worse
[1:42:52] see and so one degree off center you're
[1:42:56] not going to hit the target and you
[1:42:58] don't have to be 180 degrees off like
[1:43:00] Jonah just a couple of degrees off and
[1:43:02] you're not gonna get there you see now
[1:43:05] you remember the story of Mary and
[1:43:07] Joseph they had been they lived in
[1:43:09] Nazareth they went down to Jerusalem for
[1:43:13] the Bar Mitzvah and the big thing you
[1:43:15] know Jesus was 12 years old so they're
[1:43:17] down there and it's a big family thing
[1:43:19] everybody comes around it's a big deal
[1:43:20] well now they're going home so they
[1:43:24] didn't have any Holiday Inn so they get
[1:43:26] to the end of the first day and they're
[1:43:27] going to camp out and do their thing
[1:43:28] with her family and Mary says Joseph
[1:43:31] where's the boy
[1:43:32] oh I don't know weren't you watching him
[1:43:35] and they had a little bit of an argument
[1:43:37] you know he's not with them they thought
[1:43:41] he was with him all day traveling and
[1:43:45] here's Suns going down and they can't
[1:43:46] find him well they can't travel in the
[1:43:48] dark so they got to go to bed well I'll
[1:43:50] guarantee you need to one of them slept
[1:43:51] very good because there's you know you
[1:43:53] know you've married people you think
[1:43:55] that it's 50/50 that's not true does
[1:43:58] that 50/50 business is that when you put
[1:44:01] your head on the pillow
[1:44:02] you got a wonder at all let's see did I
[1:44:04] win or did she win who won today
[1:44:06] no it's 80/20 you give 80% hoping she'll
[1:44:11] give you 20 and she does the same thing
[1:44:14] it'll work real good yeah okay so back
[1:44:18] to our story here
[1:44:21] so they left him behind well I guess
[1:44:23] he's down there well the next day and on
[1:44:26] the third day they found him where they
[1:44:28] left him so you can think that he's with
[1:44:31] you you think that you're right because
[1:44:32] your little doctrine fits these two
[1:44:34] verses but what about the rest of it is
[1:44:35] it flowing with the Word of God you know
[1:44:38] so be careful so brother Brent says it's
[1:44:43] possible today that good men find men
[1:44:45] walking with Christ reading his word
[1:44:47] still don't recognize that this is the
[1:44:49] hour that certain things of this Bible
[1:44:51] must be fulfilled it's the hour that
[1:44:54] we're living in the time is at hand when
[1:44:56] these things must be done it's written
[1:44:58] and thus it must be fulfilled because
[1:45:00] God promised it yes our eyes must be
[1:45:04] open to see the word he says the
[1:45:07] Pharisees had the word drawn out just
[1:45:08] exactly he had it down to the degree
[1:45:11] just perfectly the way the Messiah was
[1:45:13] coming they had to figured out they
[1:45:16] believed they were right and here he was
[1:45:18] born walked amongst them and they
[1:45:20] condemned him when he told him you all
[1:45:23] need to search the Scriptures for in
[1:45:25] them you think you have eternal life and
[1:45:26] they testify of me and they said us
[1:45:30] search the Scriptures Hey
[1:45:33] so-called prophet we got a paper on the
[1:45:35] wall since we graduated from
[1:45:37] such-and-such it says we got ten of them
[1:45:38] we have searched the scriptures we are
[1:45:41] Moses disciples you know he said if you
[1:45:44] were Moses disciples you would know me
[1:45:47] because Moses wrote about me and he did
[1:45:49] you know the Lord your God so reasonable
[1:45:51] profit like in the me lawgiver and so
[1:45:53] forth and a prophet and him the people
[1:45:56] shall hear see if they had known
[1:45:58] wouldn't if they would have known Moses
[1:46:01] writings they would have known him they
[1:46:04] thought they knew Moses writings but
[1:46:06] they didn't know it they were blind to
[1:46:09] the very fact so just a few words from
[1:46:11] him like that what do they do
[1:46:12] sprung up this man has got a devil comes
[1:46:15] to teach us what school to even come
[1:46:17] from and so forth you know but they
[1:46:20] failed to look and see that the very god
[1:46:22] that promised the word was vindicating
[1:46:23] it right there through the person of
[1:46:24] Jesus Christ for he was the light of the
[1:46:26] hour he was the light for the walk
[1:46:28] people to walk in and only the Word of
[1:46:30] God produces light only God's Word
[1:46:34] God's Word produces the sunshine God's
[1:46:36] Word produces the earth God's Word
[1:46:38] produces the air everything is the Word
[1:46:40] of God made manifest
[1:46:41] everything got a reality to it and when
[1:46:45] he was here he said I am God and besides
[1:46:47] me there's no other so we don't have to
[1:46:49] argue whether Jesus Christ was God or
[1:46:51] not he says it was you know so what I
[1:46:54] could say to you here in finishing look
[1:46:56] around be sensitive you know discern
[1:46:59] your surroundings be sure that you're
[1:47:01] balanced in spirit and in truth we got
[1:47:05] look I know a lady she's got so much
[1:47:08] truth she's way over here like this 20
[1:47:12] years ago she told me I have heard
[1:47:14] everything William Brennan said eight
[1:47:15] times over and you just try to push that
[1:47:20] further the other way bad and then we
[1:47:23] have the rock and roll people all spirit
[1:47:26] and no truth we got to have balance very
[1:47:30] important so be sensitive check up our
[1:47:34] life our doctor and our experience has
[1:47:36] to match God's Word for the present hour
[1:47:39] now you can be an expert carpenter and
[1:47:41] build a big boat like that got down
[1:47:43] Cincinnati and so what we're not going
[1:47:46] out of here in a boat no you know it's
[1:47:50] got to be God's Word for the hour and we
[1:47:53] don't care about matching you know
[1:47:55] imagination and explanations we can't
[1:47:57] afford any longer to live in a glare
[1:48:00] live for today prepare for tomorrow
[1:48:02] we're on a journey we have a goal we're
[1:48:04] going to the resurrection we're just
[1:48:06] going around circles you know so we we
[1:48:10] have the same spirit of Malachi of the
[1:48:12] Malachi 4 people you know we got
[1:48:14] religious tourists accumulating the
[1:48:17] accumulating religious souvenirs
[1:48:19] I'm giving stuff away I don't want
[1:48:21] souvenirs you know and and we're at the
[1:48:24] point of burning candles now some people
[1:48:26] come from the Catholic Church right and
[1:48:28] you know good Catholics and they got
[1:48:30] those candles we got people today not
[1:48:35] way off today in I know in Peru and
[1:48:39] maybe a couple other places they've got
[1:48:41] candles burning too William branham's
[1:48:42] picture they come right around again
[1:48:46] where they come from
[1:48:48] it's pathetic idolatry flee idolatry and
[1:48:52] so these people don't have any
[1:48:56] relationship with Jesus Christ they
[1:48:57] don't know the word you see okay I am
[1:49:01] finished and got done one page he says
[1:49:05] here well that's the way it is today
[1:49:06] with people who call themselves
[1:49:07] Christians
[1:49:08] you say oh I belong to church that's
[1:49:10] good but you see the reason there is so
[1:49:11] much trouble in the church the reason
[1:49:13] there's so much confusion in the church
[1:49:15] so much discontentment in the church
[1:49:17] you'll ever see a church like that
[1:49:19] everything's smooth here it's not
[1:49:24] because Jesus is not there it's because
[1:49:26] Jesus can't get ain't gain access to the
[1:49:28] places he wants to go we have these
[1:49:31] little compartments oh no don't touch
[1:49:33] that
[1:49:33] you can come into my heart that's far
[1:49:36] enough
[1:49:36] I'll join Church otherwise let me run my
[1:49:39] own business Jesus wants to be the
[1:49:41] supreme ruler of your being and the only
[1:49:43] way that he can bless you is when he
[1:49:45] becomes your Lord Lord is rulership
[1:49:49] ownership who made you who has the right
[1:49:51] to replace in your heart the Creator to
[1:49:54] open your heart you know and right over
[1:49:56] here in Middletown Ohio he said and when
[1:49:58] Jesus comes in he wants to be welcomed
[1:50:00] just like we have the man at the door
[1:50:02] you want to be welcomed
[1:50:03] welcome here can we happen to help you
[1:50:05] find a seat he says but we've got little
[1:50:08] secret doors little bitty doors in our
[1:50:10] heart we don't want Jesus in over on the
[1:50:13] right hand side of the human heart after
[1:50:14] Jesus gets in is a little door called
[1:50:16] pride
[1:50:17] oh I'll receive him as Savior but don't
[1:50:20] tell me the way I have to dress and the
[1:50:23] way I have to do and if I have to let my
[1:50:25] hair grow or I have to stop smoking
[1:50:27] cigarettes or quitting going to the pool
[1:50:29] room or just add your big list of that
[1:50:31] you know he says don't worry he won't
[1:50:34] stay too long
[1:50:35] pride so if he's not Lord of all your
[1:50:40] being you know then he's not Lord at all
[1:50:43] because we're not seeming serving a God
[1:50:45] of commune of convenience he's seen and
[1:50:47] if he's calling you yield to him we can
[1:50:52] pray for you now we can pray for you
[1:50:53] tomorrow whatever but there comes a time
[1:50:56] in everyone's life when this F state
[1:50:58] Lord it's all yours
[1:50:59] I'm
[1:51:01] as far as I'm going it's all yours I'll
[1:51:04] put all my stuff away
[1:51:05] follow you word of god says but as it is
[1:51:09] written I have not seen ear has not
[1:51:11] heard neither has entered into the human
[1:51:13] heart the things that God has prepared
[1:51:15] for them to love him but God has
[1:51:18] revealed them to us by his Spirit he
[1:51:21] sent us a prophet he's revealed these
[1:51:22] things and we've got an errant language
[1:51:24] we can read it we can hear it we can see
[1:51:26] it yeah we've got this confusion because
[1:51:28] we're not lined up amen let's stand
[1:51:31] together thank you for your attention if
[1:51:34] he musicians would come would like to
[1:51:37] sing Jesus be the Lord of all Lord we
[1:51:41] thank you for your love to us we thank
[1:51:43] you for your word thank you for the
[1:51:45] patience of your people Lord to put up

[1:51:48] reward their sacrifice the Lord just
[1:51:50] help us together to live what we have we
[1:51:53] love you Lord we need you help us in
[1:51:55] Jesus name you know a long time ago
[1:51:58] there was a preacher in Italy called
[1:52:00] Francis of Assisi that's where Pope
[1:52:04] Francis got his name you know but Pope
[1:52:06] Randy principe of us East was a gospel
[1:52:10] preacher Catholics say belongs to them
[1:52:12] but you know brother Brent says the
[1:52:13] gospel preacher among other things he
[1:52:15] said preach always use words when
[1:52:18] necessary brother Brent said the same
[1:52:21] thing live your message because what
[1:52:25] happens today we're so smart Oh blah
[1:52:27] blah blah blah blah and eventually all
[1:52:29] that doesn't line up with our testimony
[1:52:31] so just save all that and just live it
[1:52:34] amen Jesus be the Lord
[1:52:42] [Music]

[1:54:48] know I'm gonna share a little something
[1:54:49] with you that probably share you to the
[1:54:51] church here in the Lord willing week's
[1:54:53] coming but listen or early Monday
[1:54:55] morning I'm just listening just
[1:54:57] listening to the message the invasion of
[1:54:59] the United States and you you know as
[1:55:02] many of you if you've listened that
[1:55:03] message you find how that the Spirit of
[1:55:05] God is is speaking how things so subtly
[1:55:09] as as the Lord was speaking through his
[1:55:12] through brother George will enter in and
[1:55:14] brother BAM is identifying of how that
[1:55:16] Hollywood has become he said the place
[1:55:20] to where streams of demons are going out
[1:55:23] of there then brother Branham in the
[1:55:25] middle of that message he steps forward
[1:55:26] and once again these are things that I
[1:55:28] love within the message brother bream
[1:55:30] didn't try to act he didn't try to
[1:55:32] portray that he didn't deal with issues
[1:55:34] in his life but in the middle of that
[1:55:36] message brother Bram says I find myself
[1:55:38] going back to the hotel room and
[1:55:41] wondering in my mind how many people are
[1:55:44] in my meeting and brother bream said
[1:55:46] that's wrong he found that in his mind
[1:55:49] going on and he said that's wrong and
[1:55:52] then he goes on to talk about how things
[1:55:54] suddenly were being said that you know
[1:55:56] this particular man is the man of the
[1:55:58] hour
[1:55:58] brother Ram said there's no man of the
[1:56:00] hour except the Lord Jesus Christ then
[1:56:03] you find brother man unclear at the end
[1:56:05] of the message come back around in
[1:56:06] prayer the last few paragraphs he comes
[1:56:09] right back around and he says the Lord
[1:56:10] forgive me
[1:56:12] he said because where I'm at right now
[1:56:14] with that thinking of wondering how many
[1:56:16] people and Counting the numbers of my
[1:56:18] meeting he said I'm getting out of the
[1:56:21] way
[1:56:22] he said forgive me Lord Jesus you know
[1:56:26] what it was was pride we're all in Our
[1:56:29] Lives there's nothing that all of a
[1:56:31] sudden that once we've been born again
[1:56:32] all we're completely we're aware and
[1:56:35] we're not susceptible no there's two
[1:56:36] parts of us that are not born again
[1:56:38] there's two parts that have to
[1:56:40] constantly be brought in line with the
[1:56:42] word and one of the greatest men that
[1:56:45] lived Apostle Paul God saw that he
[1:56:48] needed help so God allowed a messenger
[1:56:51] of Satan to do what keep him in a place
[1:56:53] of humility aren't you thankful God
[1:56:57] knows friends he knows each and every
[1:56:59] one of us he knows our makeups he knows
[1:57:00] our dispositions as brother George was
[1:57:03] reading that quote tonight he knows our
[1:57:04] peculiarities God knows what we have
[1:57:06] need of he knows everything about our
[1:57:08] life the greatest thing we can do is
[1:57:10] search me Lord David David did not even
[1:57:14] put it to his ownself David just said
[1:57:16] search me Lord you try my heart Lord God
[1:57:19] see if there's any wicked way in me
[1:57:22] oh my aren't you thankful to the Lord
[1:57:25] that's what we want in this hour and
[1:57:27] that's what the presence of the Lord
[1:57:28] among us it's the greatest it's the
[1:57:30] greatest MRI
[1:57:31] it's a spiritual MRI as we're listening
[1:57:34] to the word if we're just listening to
[1:57:35] the word and it's something we're
[1:57:37] looking off right out there we're
[1:57:38] missing the desire of what the word is
[1:57:41] to do I don't know about you but when I
[1:57:43] read in the more I read the scriptures
[1:57:45] when I'm listening to the message I mean
[1:57:47] this I wanted to examine right here I
[1:57:50] wanted to examine my life because that
[1:57:53] message it came from me there's a lot of
[1:57:57] others but it came from me and as I'm
[1:57:58] listening I'm listening all my and you
[1:58:01] know what even after you're done
[1:58:02] listening with the message you know if
[1:58:04] it continues to resonate you might find
[1:58:07] yourself on the job putting a bolt on or
[1:58:10] maybe all of a sudden something comes
[1:58:11] together for a program or maybe you're
[1:58:13] putting a fitting on for a washer of a
[1:58:15] plumber all of a sudden something comes
[1:58:17] to you what it is the Spirit of God
[1:58:19] bringing back to your remembrance what
[1:58:22] he said
[1:58:23] that's his love and his care oh I'm so
[1:58:26] glad he didn't leave it to flesh to
[1:58:28] perfect but he himself is here present
[1:58:31] among us
[1:58:32] all glory be to God aren't you thankful
[1:58:35] for that tonight say Lord keep me ever

[2:06:10] heart Lord and father we've not come
[2:06:12] here Lord God to hear Lord of our
[2:06:15] strengths but we've come here tonight
[2:06:17] Lord to hear of our weak points Lord
[2:06:20] that those things Lord might be Lord
[2:06:23] just further made known and in your
[2:06:24] presence Lord these things are brought
[2:06:27] to light Lord God
[2:06:28] and father we ask Lord God that for
[2:06:31] every need that's here Lord if there's
[2:06:33] one year tonight Lord that doesn't know

[2:06:43] presence Lord that they would sense Lord
[2:06:46] God that father in your presence there
[2:06:48] is true safety Lord God and father Lord
[2:06:51] to wear that it's just a time of
[2:06:53] surrender Lord where they within their
[2:06:55] hearts Lord repenting Lord and saying
[2:06:57] Lord what would you have me to do next
[2:06:59] Lord what's the next step Lord father
[2:07:02] knowing that all of these things Lord
[2:07:04] it's it's laid out in the scripture Lord
[2:07:06] many times but maybe there's lives that
[2:07:08] are here tonight Lord that's never heard
[2:07:10] it Lord but father we see it clearly in
[2:07:13] your word as brother George referenced
[2:07:15] it tonight Lord do repent lord if it's
[2:07:18] Lord God it's not our about it's not
[2:07:21] about our tears it's a condition of the
[2:07:22] heart Lord God and father were a hardest
[2:07:25] turn Lord where you begin to deal with
[2:07:27] returning it Lord it's a heart you can
[2:07:30] speak to Lord and it will respond to you
[2:07:33] and father as that I floored will live
[2:07:35] Lord and and move on junction to another
[2:07:38] Lord repent and be baptized in the name
[2:07:41] of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[2:07:43] remission of their sins and Lord the
[2:07:45] promise is Lord that we shall receive
[2:07:47] the gift of the Holy Ghost Lord that's
[2:07:50] your word Lord God and father Lord as we
[2:07:53] Lord come Lord as you as a mention here
[2:07:56] tonight Lord submissive to that word
[2:07:58] Lord it isn't about whether Lord that we
[2:08:01] understand it Lord the understanding is
[2:08:03] to recognize it's your word Lord and we
[2:08:06] surrender to that Lord and it's you that
[2:08:09] performs that word Lord there's not a
[2:08:11] person in here tonight Lord including
[2:08:13] myself that hasn't walked already Lord
[2:08:15] in the waters of baptism been filled
[2:08:18] with the Spirit of God that can look
[2:08:19] back Lord and when they Lord have been
[2:08:21] baptized that has more of a meaning Lord
[2:08:24] it is more precious tonight Lord than
[2:08:26] the very moment Lord God they first
[2:08:28] believe Lord Oh God for we see it to be
[2:08:31] amazing grace Lord God that is sought us
[2:08:34] out Lord Jesus and brought us to
[2:08:36] yourself Lord in everything Lord God how
[2:08:39] that we desire Lord
[2:08:41] searches out Lord God Oh Lord of David
[2:08:44] said search me Oh God
[2:08:46] try me Lord and see Lord if there be any
[2:08:51] wicked way in me
[2:08:52] Oh God we believe Lord Jesus that Lord
[2:08:56] God that father as your search is made
[2:09:00] in our life and we allow Lord we submit
[2:09:02] our lives Lord to be open that way then
[2:09:04] God you're able to show us even Lord
[2:09:07] what would be the smallest of detail but
[2:09:10] we can see as was said tonight a
[2:09:12] two-degree variance now ends up to be a
[2:09:15] great variance later on Lord
[2:09:18] Oh God granite tonight Lord may there
[2:09:21] not be one Lord here may there not be
[2:09:23] one Lord that would miss it what God may
[2:09:27] not want Lord God but may lord every
[2:09:29] heart Lord I pray father may each life
[2:09:32] may every individual Lord may we Lord
[2:09:34] God even from the closing of the service
[2:09:37] or may we be more determined Lord more
[2:09:40] determined Lord to surrender and yield
[2:09:43] ourselves more God
[2:09:45] Oh father Lord Jesus we desire Lord that
[2:09:49] you would have the preeminence Lord in

[2:13:34] well I don't know how brother George is
[2:13:36] supposed to go over to Toledo and be
[2:13:40] over there tomorrow night I don't know
[2:13:41] really how to pray I don't know whether
[2:13:42] I should pray that the snow they get all
[2:13:44] the snow that they need because if they
[2:13:46] get all the snow that they need then
[2:13:48] we're just gonna have church
[2:13:52] so you think it'd be alright if we
[2:13:54] prayed that way mris not here is she you
[2:14:05] know they'll have to make a call there
[2:14:06] tomorrow but let's just let's remember
[2:14:09] you know brother George and prayer and I
[2:14:12] think it's just it's wonderful to hear
[2:14:14] what the Lord is doing sometimes we
[2:14:17] don't see you know so much or maybe
[2:14:18] hears so much beyond what we would say
[2:14:20] maybe our walls but you know what the
[2:14:23] Spirit of the Lord is moving God's
[2:14:25] getting his people ready he's getting
[2:14:27] every every last one just even the
[2:14:29] testimonies brother Randy was share with
[2:14:30] me from India God's doing a work God's
[2:14:33] doing a work the main part of it
[2:14:35] sometimes were you know even as a person
[2:14:37] we may not go but it's like the example
[2:14:39] brother George referred to yesterday the
[2:14:42] brother branham referred to the success
[2:14:44] of his meetings he pulled back the
[2:14:45] curtain and he showed John Ryan laying
[2:14:48] on the ground praying I'll tell you what
[2:14:50] prayer I'll say it like this prayer is
[2:14:53] so underestimated but prayer is the
[2:14:55] greatest weapon that God has ever placed
[2:14:59] into the hands of mortal man you know
[2:15:01] brother branham play he told us he said
[2:15:03] prayer is the radarscreen sometimes we
[2:15:06] can't see and even sometimes how we feel
[2:15:09] but prayer shows up you know show things
[2:15:13] up
[2:15:15] it may not seem like an answers coming
[2:15:17] you might have prayed and prayed but
[2:15:18] it's not about how long who were talking
[2:15:23] to he hears us he hears us and to think
[2:15:27] about it that when you go to start
[2:15:29] talking everything else he hushes
[2:15:32] because he wants to hear from you
[2:15:35] because his blood has paid the price
[2:15:39] that we might have access to the throne
[2:15:42] of God hallelujah glory be to God even
[2:15:46] that he deals with our hearts to turn
[2:15:47] our hearts in that manner to begin to go
[2:15:49] to him in prayer he loves to hear from
[2:15:52] you just like when you get a text from
[2:15:54] your you know your buddy or somebody
[2:15:56] text you in something they're getting
[2:15:57] ready to say thing I'll Meyer your wife
[2:15:59] or your husband and maybe sometimes you
[2:16:01] don't want to get those texts but you
[2:16:02] get certain texts from people like oh my
[2:16:05] the Lord loves to get a text from you he
[2:16:10] loves to and he has a greater Facebook
[2:16:12] account

[2:16:19] post after post after post about you and
[2:16:22] I in this book of redemption and every
[2:16:24] once in a while one of those posts he
[2:16:25] performs a private chat I don't even

[2:16:32] while he has a little private chat about
