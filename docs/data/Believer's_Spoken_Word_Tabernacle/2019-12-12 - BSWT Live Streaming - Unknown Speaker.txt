tonight Lord to be gathered together and Lord we're looking Lord we're looking to hear from you Lord we need to hear from you tonight Lord as we've come your Lord just - Lord give and yield of ourselves tonight Lord speaker and hearer together Lord that you would speak and hear through us Lord and minister Lord to our needs Lord here tonight we pray Lord that you'll just come among us and just speak your word Lord into our hearts we pray father Lord we ask it now in the name of Jesus Christ for your glory amen amen in Exodus chapter 15 exodus chapter 15 verse 22 I want to just read here beginning in verse 22 and so Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea and they went out into the wilderness of Shur and they went three days in the wilderness and found no water and when they had come tomorrow they could not drink of the waters of Marah for they were bitter therefore the name of it was called marna and the people murmured against Moses saying what shall we drink and he cried unto the Lord and the Lord showed him a tree which when he had cast it into the waters the waters were made sweet and there he made for them a statue and an ordinance and there he proved them and said if thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God and will do that which is right in his sight and will give ear to His commandments and keep all his statutes I will put none of these diseases upon thee which I have brought upon the Egyptians for I am the Lord that healeth thee amen may God bless you bless the reading of his word as you're being seated tonight I want to continue with that thought on the Lord sweetens bitter waters and just to really draw our attention here within the the scriptures I I'm just so thankful to the Lord how that God he makes known his love and care and when I I look back and I see throughout the scriptures you know these are not just stories they are not just examples that happen but they are witnesses of God his abiding presence and his faithfulness to us as his believing children and I'm grateful for that that God would lead will give us these expressions that we can see and we are partakers of that in our own lives these these the bitter waters that they were brought to would be a representative of the test and the trials that that we would go through as as the people of God and tests and trials were aware that that a test and trial is not anything that is is not a punitive it's not punishment but a test and trial is therefore our molding and our shaping many of the times you know we we I believe as believers we would we gravitate to the place to examine our lives and say Lord is there anything that I've done within this is there anywhere that I'm falling short because brother Brennan would tell us that there is a tension that comes with being a believer in uniting time and sigh and he said you don't release tension you actually add tension to your life he said because as a believer he said you know when you were in the world you just went about your everyday life and everyone you didn't care but he said when he said you become a Christian he said the tension about your life is constantly every moment you are wondering am i pleasing to my Lord and brother branham would go on to put that out and he said it's like the automobile engine here is a belt that goes around all of the pulleys there and that belt itself is the kree is such attention and it's needed in order to make the car go down the road and brother Graham would come back around and say after all he said see Christian to us attention is a blessing to us as Christians it's a blessing that within our lives you know that the very first thing that we would think of is say Lord is there anything wrong is there anything out of step in my life because within that to know that God is faithful he God does not hold things from you and I he he does not keep anything back but if there is something that has has come up that is where where there is a correction that's coming God is faithful to guide us within correct because remember within this correction itself is not the joy god does not get joy from bringing correction but what God receives joy from is when the correction becomes reflected in our life and our lives become disciplined to the word and so this is the whole this is a whole purpose of it and as a believer we we have that tendency and maybe some more with a makeups and things that we have but yet within it to know that when our hearts are poured out like that and there is nothing that God would bring before us within our hearts then we can stand there and and to know that God he is directing everything he's over at all anyhow even when it's correction God's over it he's still in control but to realize that trials they are not they are not punishment that has come our way but rather it is directed by the hand of the Lord to think Israel in this scripture that we're reading here they are in the pathway to come into the promised land they're in the wilderness and there is many ways to go about and type it that when we recognize that they were coming into the promised land that would belong to them the promises and their inheritance that that was there within the land for you and I we we are dwelling in the promised land of the Holy Ghost in the revealed Word of the our baptized by one spirit into the body of Jesus Christ and we also are on our way to the promised land but it's not the promised land where there is wars and fighting but the promised land I'm talking about is in my father's house are many mansions the promised land that I'm talking about is is that as he said in Revelation 3:21 that as I overcome even as I overcome and I'm set down with my father in his throne so shouting you as you overcome sit down with me in my Father's throne we also have the promise that this corruption shall put on incorruption we have the promise that this vow body but the same God who changed our soul will also change this body to matchless on the inside we have that promise that we are coming into because we are not in a junction remember brother Brannon would point it like this in the future home and he would tell us he said the church is not called to a junction like Luther like Wesley and like that' Pentecost but we're not at a junction we are coming to the full promises of God what the others have waited and they have held fast to in the coming of the Lord the coming of the Lord is upon us there's not another age to come this is the age that the rapture is promised a man Enoch was the seventh from Noah it is promised in this hour the rapture to the Church of the Living God so in the meantime when we look at all these promises those are are very wonderful and they are glorious promises that pertain to us in this hour as the overcomers and yet to realize that there is the need through our journey just as God was taking Israel through the journey here this moment when they came to bitter waters was a moment for God to actually express his love and his power and it was for God to teach them and to train them now you know when we realize it you and I every experience we come through is to prepare us for another experience and another experience but all of those together are preparing for us to sit with him in his throne it is all preparing so it is all molding of our character and there's no other way for character to be molded other than through suffering and so when we look at this let me just take a few places in the scripture here tonight in first Peter chapter 1 verse 3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead aren't you glad it's a lively hope we've got a lively expectation by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead because as he raised so have we raised in him so notice we this is the lively expectation we have to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you I want you to understand this has been reserved for you and it is still reserved for you the body is waiting all mine just as our spiritual body is being molded here in molding into the word image brother Bram suggests as there is a little spirit that comes next to the woman when she's getting ready to give birth he says for that spiritual body gets mere he said while we are being formed here there is a body that is prepared to theophany for when we step out of this line we go right into that theophany body God has everything prepared and arranged because within the theophany there would be no temptation but God here in this lifetime this is the proving grounds it's where everything is proven and and to think of how that all of this here the Bible goes on to say in verse 5 who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time you wonder how you're sitting here this verse holds the answer you've been kept by the power of God you see the power of God in your life is not just power for you to stand when the enemy makes an affront but it also is power by that of life for you to be able to stand when circumstances around you are breaking all around you and to be able to stand and for his life to be reflected in our lives whether we're out whether we're down it is the life of Jesus Christ that is on display in our life there's no other way to explain it we have been kept and are kept by the power of amen it is faith that is the victory all mine and verse six now watch this wherein ye greatly rejoice we rejoice in that duly though now for a season you ever heard things where people say I hope we have a fall this year I hopefully have a spring this year I hope we have a hopefully have it you know this year hope it just don't go straight to winter people like transitions we all do right we like transitions because sometimes it seems like we don't have a fall we don't have a spring it seems like it goes from cold straight to hot right but yet sometimes if we're looking at that in terms of tests and trials I'd like to have a short spring sometimes I'd like to have a short fall sometimes but it's just a season and you know one thing about a season brother William you don't ever know I know our calendar says summer starts on June 21st we'll tell my skin when it was boiling back there in Memorial Day that summer starts in June 21st you with me but all that is set up on the lights in the heavens with me so now seasons themselves are just periods of time and remember even when Jesus was tempted the Bible says that the devil departed from him for a season so though now don't remember we greatly rejoice we've got a promise that's what we're rejoicing about though now for a season if need be and it ain't up to us to determine if it's necessary he's the one if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold temptation look at this word heaviness its to make sorrowful to affect with sadness cause grief to throw into sorrow and to make one uneasy calls him a scruple so why is this heaviness come about I'm rejoicing we're rejoicing and looking and what the promises that we are coming into but yet there is a heaviness at times that can surround our lives by the trial notice and then near the Bible says manifold temptations and there's many ways that Trials come our way there's a there's afflictions that can come in our body there is situations that can arise on our job there's so many different ways through many manifold temptations but notice the Bible says that the trial of your faith being much more precious than gold that perishes and though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ whom having not seen you love in whom though you now you see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls so the trial of our faith our faith is more precious than gold let me just say it like this how would you know what you've really got unless it's put to the test
