[32:34] for the mercy of God once again amen
[32:37] it's so good to be together and we just
[32:43] want to just look here in the word just
[32:47] one verse of scripture and will let you
[32:48] have your seats
[32:51] Genesis chapter 21 and verse 1 and the
[32:57] Lord visited Sara as he had said and the
[33:02] Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken
[33:10] let's read that again and the Lord
[33:15] capital L capital o capital R capital D
[33:20] visited Sarah as he had said
[33:26] and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had
[33:31] spoken
[33:36] god bless you as you're being seated
[33:40] just like to speak tonight for a few
[33:43] moments Sarah's visitation we know that
[33:51] what we've just read here as we were
[33:54] looking here's some time a few weeks and
[33:59] last week we were dealing with this in
[34:01] Genesis 18 here in Genesis 21 were we
[34:06] open in the scripture this is that which
[34:10] the Lord had said while using human
[34:15] flesh to speak it it was not the human
[34:20] flesh that would return back but it was
[34:22] the Lord Himself that would come make a
[34:26] visitation to Sarah the flesh would not
[34:30] ride the trail again but the Lord
[34:32] Himself would ride the trail again so
[34:35] there were seeds that had to be sown and
[34:38] in order for this to take place
[34:40] remember this itself as what is
[34:43] mentioned here in Genesis 21 his
[34:47] promises that were was already made and
[34:51] as the journey with Abraham continued it
[34:55] began to become more clear even to where
[34:58] that God would express it in Genesis 17
[35:01] at the latter part of that chapter that
[35:04] Sarah indeed shall have a son according
[35:09] to this set time within the next year
[35:11] and I will establish my covenant with
[35:15] him and so God at all God was very it
[35:19] the the promise itself and the clarity
[35:22] had become more and more clear and
[35:26] within it becoming more clear at once it
[35:30] is just to see this these this is word
[35:33] that is being sown even in that time to
[35:38] where that in this chapter of chapter 18
[35:40] where the visitation takes place to
[35:44] where that Abraham has seen he as
[35:47] witness God appear in
[35:49] dreams and lights and God is you know
[35:52] made himself known in various manner
[35:55] before but here and in this time before
[35:59] they promise for being an order before
[36:02] it to come to pass God makes and
[36:05] manifests himself through that of human
[36:07] flesh and remember it was when this
[36:11] coming down that Abraham himself he
[36:14] recognizes that there is something
[36:16] different about this these men that are
[36:21] coming down through here Abraham did not
[36:24] just look at them as just you know that
[36:28] well it was something that seemed to be
[36:30] different as far as on the outside but
[36:33] what it was it was something there on
[36:35] the inside that Abraham was in tune with
[36:39] God and I want you to think of this now
[36:41] he was already in tune with God and each
[36:44] step even through all of Abraham's
[36:47] failures even through all the
[36:49] misunderstandings of the promised God's
[36:52] Word was prevailing in Abraham's life
[36:57] sometimes it would have looked like that
[36:59] Abraham well you know surely God would
[37:02] have cast him off or God would have
[37:04] wrote him off but you see God does not
[37:06] choose flesh that would be flesh within
[37:10] itself that would be strong in that the
[37:13] flesh would gain glory but God chooses
[37:16] that with words within weakness if
[37:18] weakness itself is displayed but you see
[37:21] that weakness is only an opportunity and
[37:25] a channel that God can make his power
[37:28] known through that weakness so through
[37:31] everything that had taken place it was a
[37:33] great triumph for even Abraham to be
[37:36] able to take the promise of God and even
[37:39] to triumph even over every one of his
[37:42] failures but now when you we come into
[37:45] this to see of where this visitation
[37:48] will will come to Sarah here we come
[37:51] back into the scripture here in Genesis
[37:53] 18 in this time of visitation where
[37:56] remember Abraham himself recognizes this
[38:00] is a day of visitation
[38:02] when we finally open here in verse nine
[38:04] if we can just refer back to this where
[38:07] where we read from our text the Lord
[38:09] visited Sara as he had said and the Lord
[38:12] did unto Sarah as he had spoken in verse
[38:15] nine it says they said unto him where is
[38:18] Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the
[38:21] tenth and he said I will certainly
[38:25] return unto thee according to the time
[38:29] of life and so and lo Sarah thy wife
[38:33] shall have a son and Sarah heard it in
[38:36] the tent door which was behind him now
[38:38] Abraham and Sarah were old and well
[38:42] stricken in age and it ceased to be with
[38:45] Sarah after the manner of women now
[38:47] notice here's the conditions you see
[38:49] when you when we look at things many
[38:52] times you can hear a story you can hear
[38:54] a testimony but unless you know the
[38:57] background that testimony doesn't stand
[38:59] out as great as it does if you know the
[39:03] background and so when you consider that
[39:05] even the background on things is very
[39:07] important even to where brother Branham
[39:09] would take the the text of Psalms 27 and
[39:12] he would refer to that text he says
[39:14] we're gonna read this text as a
[39:16] background for the rapture and the
[39:18] background itself is a setting it lets
[39:21] you know the setting of which the bride
[39:23] is going to be caught away in rapturing
[39:26] grace it's not a setting of something
[39:29] that is easy but on the contrary she is
[39:32] and we are surrounded by the enemy but
[39:36] yet within the midst of it there is a
[39:38] place that has been reserved that you
[39:41] and I would be able to stand in this
[39:43] hour and that stand is not our strength
[39:45] but it is God's provision that it's made
[39:48] a place for you and I in this hour where
[39:51] you and I can stand the Bible said he
[39:53] has set me up on the rock in the secret
[39:55] of his Tabernacle in his pavilion he has
[39:58] hidden me there in this time of trouble
[40:01] so God has already made a provision I
[40:03] I'll say it like this tonight when we
[40:05] look at that and see that in the word I
[40:08] believe if we can really take it in and
[40:10] not just leave the word out here but
[40:12] to see that in everything that can come
[40:15] our way even in this life to recognize
[40:18] he is our provision God is not left to
[40:22] you and I to be Franek to be anxious to
[40:25] be digging around as though that you and
[40:27] I are the one that's got to come up with
[40:29] the answers he is our place of safety
[40:33] he has always provided for his people
[40:36] and the way that he provides for his
[40:38] people the greatest thing that he could
[40:40] ever do is provide himself has the place
[40:44] of refuge and the Ark of safety for his
[40:48] people that's the greatest provision our
[40:52] challenge many times over and over is
[40:55] our own anxiousness and why are we
[40:59] anxious because we get our eyes on the
[41:02] conditions which is exactly why this is
[41:06] included in the scripture right here
[41:08] they were aware of their conditions this
[41:13] is why Abraham in the previous chapter
[41:16] laughed when God said you're going to
[41:19] have a son by Sarah he laughed
[41:23] you know why he knew the conditions of
[41:27] his body at one time he produced in his
[41:31] mouth but a stream of life was gone
[41:35] Sarah's womb was dead she had been
[41:38] barren the whole time hallelujah so
[41:43] think of this God allows the conditions
[41:46] to be recorded here for you and eyes to
[41:49] see that the conditions were not
[41:52] favorable for the promise hallelujah but
[41:57] the conditions were what was needed for
[42:00] God to declare himself as the Living God
[42:06] sometimes our conditions we look at it
[42:09] and say God shoulda gave that promise to
[42:11] somebody else the conditions would have
[42:13] been it would have been more favorable
[42:14] but those conditions are opportunities
[42:18] for God to come on the scene and make
[42:21] himself known because this is not a work
[42:24] of power or Mike it's the work of the
[42:28] Holy Ghost hallelujah any healing that's
[42:33] taking place it's because of the Holy
[42:35] Ghost faith that arises in our hearts
[42:39] it's because of the Holy Ghost
[42:42] deliverance it's because of the Holy
[42:44] Ghost amen is because of him or repeated
[42:52] on our conditions we'll always look
[42:55] unfavorable now Abraham and Sarah were
[43:00] old and well stricken in age
[43:04] in other words they had they had they
[43:07] had already had their golden Buckeye
[43:09] card for years
[43:18] they had already had senior discounts
[43:20] and senior privileges it's letting us
[43:26] know the condition when the word has
[43:28] come the Bible says in verse 12
[43:31] therefore Sara left within herself not
[43:37] allowed in herself in here
[43:44] she laughed saying after I am waxed old
[43:50] shall I have pleasure my lord being old
[43:55] also
[43:57] and the Lord said unto Abraham
[44:02] wherefore did Sarah laugh he didn't come
[44:07] out of that Sarah why are you laughing
[44:09] he went into her atonement how'd y'all
[44:14] would we'll get that in a little bit he
[44:15] went there to her atonement he asked the
[44:19] question to her husband come on now I
[44:22] can't read that quote yet I got pages
[44:24] ahead of me now but he asked the
[44:27] question he's directing to her head this
[44:32] is why it is the blessedness to be under
[44:35] the headship of the word amen because
[44:40] when questions arise it's directed to
[44:43] the headship and if we are baptized into
[44:46] the body by one spirit we are under the
[44:49] headship of Christ amen and the Holy
[44:55] Spirit deals with our life to work all
[44:58] things out to where if there's any
[45:01] unbelief it works to cast that out and
[45:06] the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did
[45:11] Sarah laugh saying shall I of a surety
[45:14] bear a child which am old
[45:19] the word the word standing in her midst
[45:23] discerned her heart let me just say it
[45:27] to you like this
[45:28] as far as and I'm gonna read a few
[45:30] statements here in a minute as far as a
[45:33] son a man coming and revealing v son of
[45:37] man Genesis 18 in that respect is
[45:40] history but the word is still here the
[45:45] son of man himself is still here in
[45:48] bright form and that word is still
[45:52] discerning hearts and lives there's not
[45:56] a man that can know even when brother
[45:59] Randall say it was not brother Branham
[46:00] who knew what was in the hearts of the
[46:02] people that's not what a prophet is but
[46:05] a prophet is that a one who is in tune
[46:08] with God a special gift that is given
[46:11] that God Himself would be able to
[46:14] transmit his secrets and his secrets
[46:17] then would be declared to his people the
[46:19] rest of the world writes it off as just
[46:22] another ministry and whatever else they
[46:25] want to classify it as but it has a
[46:27] meaning to that of the elect believers
[46:30] because it's it's not because the tiolet
[46:33] are super smart it's because of
[46:35] sovereign grace if it was not for
[46:38] Sovereign Grace you and I would miss it
[46:40] I want you to think about this all the
[46:49] way down there men that worse collared
[46:51] men they knew Moses message they studied
[46:54] it out they could quote it forward
[46:56] backwards let me tell you something they
[46:58] were fine people come on somebody they
[47:02] were flying people they were people you
[47:05] couldn't put a finger on their life but
[47:08] they didn't recognize the God that they
[47:11] have been reading about they couldn't
[47:14] recognize his visitation hope you're
[47:19] with me it takes more than recognizing
[47:21] quotes to recognize God amen you need to
[47:25] recognize the Living God that spoke
[47:27] there
[47:28] let them quote supporting youto without
[47:31] recognizing God you miss it you can have
[47:35] a fistful of quotes and Miss God we can
[47:40] have a fistful of scriptures and miss
[47:42] God God comes to fulfill his word
[47:48] hallelujah we don't know him by letter
[47:52] to know him by letter used to know him
[47:55] in the flesh but we didn't know the
[47:58] person of Jesus Christ heat him down let
[48:03] me repeat that again
[48:04] he didn't die he's the same God right
[48:09] here among us he's the same God living
[48:12] in his prime he's the same yesterday
[48:14] today and forever
[48:18] that's God's Word
[48:21] hallelujah he's the same God tonight the
[48:25] same that he ever was and that word
[48:30] discerned Sarah's heart let me tell you
[48:35] something the word is on your side the
[48:42] word is on your side he had already God
[48:45] had Sarah in mind the whole time it just
[48:51] began to come forth in this moment but
[48:57] here Sarah
[48:58] was a part of that word and now here
[49:01] comes a living word and what's that
[49:02] doing discerning the very intense and
[49:06] the thoughts of her heart why because
[49:08] the Bible said as a man thinketh in his
[49:10] heart so is he
[49:14] you get to thinking that I know good
[49:17] ain't no count I know this I know that
[49:19] you watch how your testimony you watch
[49:22] the atmosphere that will come about your
[49:25] life well I always fail and I always do
[49:28] this so now this and that and whatever
[49:30] more you know what you know what God
[49:32] already took cussing out of your mouth
[49:34] and you need to forfeit the devil's
[49:36] language because a negative testimony is
[49:40] Devils language come on somebody you see
[49:45] what God is doing he's changing her
[49:47] language because out of the abundance of
[49:52] the heart the mouth speaketh what's he
[49:55] doing housing on a changer language he's
[49:57] got to so word and that word being
[50:00] showed in her heart that word itself as
[50:03] it's taken in her heart it's watered in
[50:06] her heart by faith he casts out doubt
[50:08] and unbelief and fear the repeat of God
[50:14] hallelujah what's he doing he's giving
[50:18] Sara the visitation the testimony of who
[50:23] God knows her to be the word is a
[50:27] discerner no doubt going through this
[50:33] congregation right here Brigid we could
[50:35] spend days right here of times whatever
[50:38] vessel that God is used but how many
[50:41] times were you've had questions on your
[50:43] heart you've had needs in your life
[50:45] you've had situations I'm gonna just
[50:47] tell you right now if God is so mindful
[50:50] about that to speak out of I don't care
[50:53] if it was five people you mean to tell
[50:55] me god is that mindful to speak to you
[50:58] in your need you know what God's trying
[51:00] to let you know I care about you I love
[51:02] about I love you I'm thinking about you
[51:05] I will actually turn this service around
[51:08] to speak to your knee hallelujah he
[51:13] manifests himself that he cares Amen he
[51:18] came there to the tenth door with one
[51:21] thing in mind where is Sarah thy wife
[51:28] and the word is there to come forth and
[51:34] bring a transformation in her life to
[51:37] where it's casting out all unbelief Oh
[51:45] glory be to God
[51:49] he's announcing his coming he says in
[51:55] verse 14 is anything hmm I just love
[51:59] that is anything too hard for the Lord
[52:07] nothing
[52:14] at the time look at this at the time
[52:16] appointed I will return unto thee
[52:20] according to the time of life and Sarah
[52:24] shall have a son then Sarah denied
[52:28] saying I laugh not for she was afraid
[52:32] and he said nay thou did his laugh you
[52:38] see the covering was taken off now I
[52:44] want you to think about this here for a
[52:46] moment here in the Old Testament where
[52:49] we stand
[52:51] it was prophecy within the life of
[52:55] Abraham
[52:56] of that which would in this visitation
[52:59] that would take place in that time when
[53:03] God himself would take upon a virgin
[53:09] born body that he had created and God
[53:12] would manifest himself in the flesh and
[53:15] come in order to pay the price for
[53:18] redemption and then through the praying
[53:22] of that price he would release now that
[53:25] life that we were intended to have he
[53:29] went out through the opening of the
[53:30] blood cell now sin that same life now
[53:34] back into the Church of the Living God
[53:37] or upon the seeds of God in order to
[53:41] raise them up in that newness of life
[53:47] it was a season and I want to say it
[53:49] like this
[53:50] where we are standing in the sound this
[53:53] is a season of the fulfillment of God's
[53:55] Word it's a season this is this is bride
[54:00] time you see it was an announcement that
[54:03] was being given these messages that God
[54:06] brought within this hour
[54:08] these are announcements it is seeds that
[54:11] was being sown seeds of the word and
[54:15] what seed you sow that seed will come
[54:18] forward but that seed must first be sown
[54:22] so there had to be a sowing of seed that
[54:25] is identified for this power that these
[54:28] are the promises that belong to us and
[54:32] the Spirit of God is the one who picks
[54:35] up those promised seeds and actually
[54:38] begins to sell those seeds and those
[54:40] seeds themselves find their mark in the
[54:43] hearts of that of the children of God
[54:46] and in the time those seeds come to life
[54:49] by the same God who showed him in the
[54:52] heart
[54:53] he brings a harvest in the life it is
[54:56] all his doing you see when we look at
[55:04] this visitation and looking at this in
[55:07] Genesis 18 remember Bill Graham will
[55:11] tell us and he'll dramatize it in his
[55:13] then the message is anything too hard
[55:15] for the Lord brother bran would ever
[55:17] actually say that even in the tent that
[55:19] morning there had been a fuss
[55:26] some of y'all now and just turn around
[55:28] in black the devil's right there had
[55:31] been a fuss in the ten blood ram even
[55:33] said in the tenth before he said Sarah
[55:35] had got to notice and some of the you
[55:37] know some of the fashions going down
[55:39] into Sodom he sent dinner or other
[55:42] things he said was coming up he said but
[55:44] you know what all that was it was he
[55:46] said it was when you see things like
[55:48] that arise he said it is only Satan
[55:52] bringing in our position because the
[55:55] promise is on the way
[55:57] [Applause]
[55:59] so when you feel like sometimes in math
[56:02] it seems like opposition is rising you
[56:05] go ahead and get in your tinting door
[56:06] because your visitations on the way
[56:11] opposition arises it's trying to hinder
[56:15] trying to turn you aside and at that
[56:18] very last moment listen this is where
[56:20] you discern it and say God you are my
[56:23] strength Lord you made the promise Lord
[56:26] and I'm going to look to you and not the
[56:29] circumstances
[56:33] Amen help us Lord amen I believe the
[56:39] Church of the Living God is rising in
[56:41] this I believe that was all my heart
[56:44] amen the ministry think of this it's the
[56:47] minister it was Abraham that caught that
[56:50] visitation it was Abraham that caught
[56:54] the visitation that was present and told
[56:57] Sarah you know go make three hoecakes
[57:00] and and sent two young men to get the
[57:02] fatted calf and brother Bram tells us he
[57:04] said it was Abraham that got Sarah and
[57:07] said Sarah this is what God promised
[57:10] this is our day of visitation you see
[57:13] God had to have some eyes on the scene
[57:16] come on somebody God had to have some
[57:18] eyes on the scene that could catch the
[57:21] day of visitation you and I would not
[57:25] have caught it on our own hope you
[57:29] understand what I'm saying
[57:30] you see it's the continuity of how God
[57:33] works
[57:35] it ain't quitting brother ran him in a
[57:37] place that God didn't pudding but it's
[57:40] recognized the Lord God will do nothing
[57:43] but he fairs revealing his secrets to
[57:46] his servants the prophets and better
[57:49] this was some secrets that was to be
[57:52] made known these were things that were
[57:54] wrapped
[57:55] they were secret and sealed within
[57:57] promises there but when those seals
[58:00] begin to be broken their names begin to
[58:03] be called names would be a change and
[58:09] Jehovah himself was coming down and
[58:12] planting his name his life his power in
[58:17] the life of Abraham and in the life of
[58:20] Sarah you talking about a mighty
[58:22] visitation and Abraham said this is our
[58:29] day you see Abraham is split and Sarah
[58:32] know this is the day of visitation this
[58:35] is your time this is the moment you
[58:37] recognize that's why God had the
[58:39] ministry that he did in this hour of
[58:41] Malachi 4 Luke 17 and 30 revelations 10
[58:44] 7 don't let them just be buzz phrases to
[58:47] you that was God's promise word in this
[58:50] hour and that will select you and I know
[58:53] of our day of visitation
[58:56] what was that seeds that were shown for
[59:00] right now when that latter rain is
[59:02] falling hallelujah where is Sarah thy
[59:10] wife brother brems said it like this and
[59:15] proving his word in 1964 he said now we
[59:17] say he's raised from the dead I didn't
[59:20] say it the word here said they said he
[59:22] raised from the dead he says he's the
[59:25] same yesterday today and forever you
[59:26] believe that he promised these things to
[59:29] happen in the last day that the same son
[59:31] of man will be made manifest now
[59:35] remember that was not Jesus talking to
[59:38] Abraham there that could discern the
[59:40] faults of Sarah's mind behind him that
[59:43] was not Jesus he had not yet been born
[59:47] but it was a man in human flesh that
[59:50] Abraham called Elohim the great Almighty
[59:54] you see Abraham was able to discern who
[59:59] was behind the flesh Abraham wasn't
[1:00:03] worshipping the flesh he knew who was
[1:00:06] behind that flesh Jesus said as it was
[1:00:12] in the days of Sodom
[1:00:13] now what's closed in the days of Sodom
[1:00:15] see the conditions nobody can argue here
[1:00:19] we're in the phase of sana we're living
[1:00:22] in the days of Sodom that was promised
[1:00:24] its conditions so will it be at the
[1:00:28] coming of the Son of Man when the Son of
[1:00:30] Man is being revealed not no more as a
[1:00:33] church see not no more the bride is
[1:00:36] called in that day the Son of Man will
[1:00:39] be revealed what to join the church to
[1:00:43] the head unite the marriage of the bride
[1:00:47] let me just tell you you can't have a
[1:00:50] wedding without a bride and you can't
[1:00:53] have a wedding without a groom a bride
[1:00:58] ain't gonna marry a picture seeing gonna
[1:01:02] marry a piece of paper a bride marries a
[1:01:06] person come on somebody they meant so in
[1:01:11] order for there to be a marriage that
[1:01:14] has to be a summoning and an awakening
[1:01:16] that this is the time of the marriage of
[1:01:19] the lamb has come but they just had long
[1:01:23] forward to it but the declaration in
[1:01:26] this hour a seed that lay within the
[1:01:28] world now that seed is picked up and
[1:01:31] it's spoken and prophesied and declared
[1:01:34] over this generation that the marriage
[1:01:36] of the lamb has come and the bride the
[1:01:39] Lambs wife she has made herself ready
[1:01:43] and that declaration declares to you and
[1:01:47] I that it is the fullness of Christ
[1:01:50] Himself the son of man who is in all men
[1:01:56] just as much as it would be insanity for
[1:02:03] a man to marry a little girl it would be
[1:02:07] insanity for a woman to marry a little
[1:02:11] boy you say what do you say I'm saying
[1:02:16] the marriage of the lamb is not married
[1:02:19] to a little boy it's Jesus Christ the
[1:02:24] Son of man in our midst
[1:02:26] that same one has had him could say
[1:02:29] she's bone of my bone flesh of my flesh
[1:02:31] life of my life it has been building
[1:02:35] down through seven ages and now here is
[1:02:39] the bride called forth in this hour to
[1:02:42] be united with him this is the taking of
[1:02:49] the Gentile bride the bridegroom call
[1:02:56] will come right through this when the
[1:02:59] Son of man will come down and come in
[1:03:02] human flesh to unite the two together
[1:03:04] you see these these were seeds that were
[1:03:07] being sown it's identifying the day of
[1:03:12] visitation listen many men had tried to
[1:03:19] pick up scriptures they had tried to
[1:03:21] figure things out by charts
[1:03:23] I'm telling you very smart men you even
[1:03:27] read in some of the things even in
[1:03:29] Scofield's notes and other things like
[1:03:30] that you realize these men were in tune
[1:03:33] with God the difference is when God
[1:03:37] comes on the scene to declare the word
[1:03:40] for right now that's the difference when
[1:03:45] God is declaring the word for right now
[1:03:47] these promises were preached and they
[1:03:50] were looked forward to but you see the
[1:03:52] difference is is now with the
[1:03:55] vindication of the Holy Spirit standing
[1:03:58] press and it's no longer putting
[1:04:00] promises in the future but it is
[1:04:02] declaring I am the
[1:04:04] direction and the lie that this is the
[1:04:08] time for he who made the promise is on
[1:04:11] the scene to fulfill the promise
[1:04:17] remember Satan's trip if he can't get
[1:04:20] people from looking back he tries to
[1:04:22] push him ahead but it comes down to
[1:04:28] unite the two together who the Son of
[1:04:32] Man and the bride the church has to be
[1:04:36] the word and he is the word he was the
[1:04:41] Living Word where he was signs followed
[1:04:46] where he was
[1:04:48] demons trembled come on somebody where
[1:04:51] he was the sick were healed there right
[1:04:56] where he was there was deliverance where
[1:04:59] he was there was life and he's the same
[1:05:02] today
[1:05:08] don't misunderstand that if God's given
[1:05:11] you a promise of healing that's as good
[1:05:12] as if you had healing standing right
[1:05:14] here because remember the same God that
[1:05:17] does it here is the same God that gives
[1:05:18] you the promise it says it's finished
[1:05:20] it's over this is my promise
[1:05:26] a living God and and he is the word and
[1:05:31] the two unites together and to do that
[1:05:34] it'll take the manifestation of the
[1:05:36] revealing of the Son of man not a
[1:05:39] clergyman he said see it's the Son of
[1:05:44] Man Jesus Christ will come down in human
[1:05:47] flesh among us and we'll make his word
[1:05:50] so real that it unites the church and
[1:05:54] him as one the bride and then she goes
[1:05:58] home to the wedding supper
[1:05:59] she's already United this is already a
[1:06:06] uniting that takes place before there
[1:06:09] ever is a physical uniting between a man
[1:06:12] and a woman there already is a uniting
[1:06:16] there where in their hearts beat as one
[1:06:20] is that right
[1:06:22] it is where that same life the life of
[1:06:25] the bridegroom moving behind the flesh
[1:06:30] of the bride this bridal tent that he's
[1:06:34] come to unite in hallelujah this bridal
[1:06:41] tent that he came to unite in she's
[1:06:48] already united we go to the wedding
[1:06:50] supper not the marriage
[1:06:53] they meant the marriage takes place here
[1:06:57] it mantid through that marriage we're
[1:07:00] looking for him there is a literal Jesus
[1:07:03] that's coming that's what believers
[1:07:07] believe that's what we're looking
[1:07:09] forward to oh no you can't spiritual
[1:07:14] Isis coming like that hey man he has
[1:07:17] come in the fullness of his spirit and
[1:07:20] he's coming that he came down and
[1:07:22] manifests himself through that other of
[1:07:24] a gift of a prophet and then God coming
[1:07:27] now in that of his bride but that is
[1:07:30] what makes you and I aware and looking
[1:07:33] for the physical return of the Lord
[1:07:36] Jesus Christ amen
[1:07:41] but the rapture is going to the wedding
[1:07:42] supper when the word here unites with
[1:07:47] the person and they to become one then
[1:07:50] what does it do it manifests the Son of
[1:07:52] Man again not Church theologians the son
[1:07:55] of man the world and the church becomes
[1:07:57] one whatever the son of man done he was
[1:08:01] the word the church does the same thing
[1:08:05] you see how the Spirit of God is placing
[1:08:09] this it's not leaving this revealing of
[1:08:12] the son of man in the Union
[1:08:15] back in Genesis 18 it brings it on down
[1:08:19] into that in that visitation to Sarah to
[1:08:23] where there is a uniting of the two
[1:08:27] together and so if the church does
[1:08:30] something different from him they're not
[1:08:33] the church it's not the bride of Jesus
[1:08:37] Christ it's an imposter
[1:08:41] come on some I don't care they got
[1:08:43] quotes or whatever they got it's an
[1:08:44] imposter if it does not stay with the
[1:08:48] said the Lord
[1:08:51] you can't cut out parts of the word if
[1:08:54] God had ministry they're a powerful
[1:08:57] ministry the same son of man in the
[1:08:59] Church of the Living God has a powerful
[1:09:01] ministry now
[1:09:03] they had non spiritual gifts back there
[1:09:05] he has not spiritual gifts here it's the
[1:09:08] same Lord Jesus I don't want no hybrid
[1:09:14] form
[1:09:14] I'll only enjoy and delight in the
[1:09:17] original Out Boy of the Holy Ghost
[1:09:21] because I know it brings results
[1:09:26] Amen we don't need any tampering with a
[1:09:29] formula the Prophet didn't tamper with
[1:09:34] the formula he was a true prophet of God
[1:09:39] come on somebody he didn't tamper with
[1:09:42] things he preached that word seeds were
[1:09:45] sold and there's a crop on the earth
[1:09:48] tonight when the Holy Spirit visiting
[1:09:52] that bride and is raising that word to
[1:09:56] life in you and I I'm a Regis something
[1:10:04] here about love sit on the plane and
[1:10:10] can't go into Canada I know little
[1:10:14] things make a lot mean a lot to me but
[1:10:16] Lord God be merciful quickly Lord shake
[1:10:20] them let them not look at flesh that
[1:10:24] same flesh that God dwelt in disappeared
[1:10:27] in a little bit after that it vanished
[1:10:30] because God only used it so will the
[1:10:34] flesh that is using now will vanish one
[1:10:38] of these days it'll go back to the dust
[1:10:40] of the earth if Jesus Terri's but the
[1:10:44] Spirit of God will live on forever that
[1:10:48] [Applause]
[1:10:50] flesh went back to the earth Cosi was
[1:10:55] only using it if you Terry or I Terry if
[1:10:59] God Terry's pretty soon this flesh that
[1:11:02] is using now we'll go to the earth but
[1:11:04] the Spirit of God will live on forever
[1:11:09] because remember this is not a man's
[1:11:12] work hallelujah
[1:11:15] oh my as that prophesy rang out when the
[1:11:18] Prophet was coming up to the platform
[1:11:21] and that prophecy rang out and said
[1:11:23] there is a man coming to the platform
[1:11:25] now whose message will forerun
[1:11:28] the coming the second coming of the Lord
[1:11:30] and brother Ram said did you notice what
[1:11:33] it said it never said the man it said
[1:11:36] the message will fall around the second
[1:11:39] coming of the Lord
[1:11:41] a man is not the man that was promised
[1:11:47] to return to us but it was the Lord
[1:11:50] Himself his promise to return in a
[1:11:54] visitation to you and I when that flash
[1:11:58] went off the scene the world had been
[1:12:01] delivered seeds have been sold now it's
[1:12:05] time for Sarah's visitation this is
[1:12:08] bride time glory be to God so Sarah
[1:12:14] would receive seed on the second ride he
[1:12:19] come riding his trail again come on
[1:12:23] somebody not brother Adam but the Lord
[1:12:26] Himself the life giver they men the same
[1:12:33] Lord God that used the human flesh of a
[1:12:36] man and afterwards vanished that same
[1:12:38] God visited Sarah and performed his word
[1:12:42] that he had spoken concerning her Oh God
[1:12:47] we can just let this drop tonight what
[1:12:49] he said he performed what he said he
[1:12:54] performed he is the performer of his
[1:12:58] word everything would be in the right
[1:13:04] time
[1:13:05] the right season here they were waiting
[1:13:10] on the day of Pentecost he told him go
[1:13:13] wait in the upper room until your endued
[1:13:15] with power from on high they had to go
[1:13:18] wait there I'm saying you watch God's
[1:13:20] precision it was there at the feast of
[1:13:24] Pentecost it was there at the outpouring
[1:13:27] of the Holy Ghost on the day of
[1:13:29] Pentecost when the day of Pentecost was
[1:13:32] fully come God keeps every word right in
[1:13:38] his season right in his time they just
[1:13:46] deal with this here just a little bit
[1:13:48] times getting away from us but genesis
[1:13:52] 21:2 for Sarah conceived and she bear
[1:13:56] abraham a son in his old age at the set
[1:14:00] time which God had spoken to him I want
[1:14:08] you to look at this parallel here in the
[1:14:09] scripture it's the parallel the hour in
[1:14:14] which were living it's the same parallel
[1:14:19] when our Lord Jesus was walking here in
[1:14:23] that virgin born body made in the
[1:14:27] likeness of sinful flesh I want to I
[1:14:31] want you to look at these scriptures in
[1:14:34] John 14 verse 16 he tells the disciples
[1:14:38] and I will pray the father and he shall
[1:14:42] give you another comforter that he may
[1:14:44] abide with you forever
[1:14:48] even the Spirit of Truth whom the world
[1:14:53] cannot receive because it seeth him not
[1:14:57] neither knoweth him but you know him for
[1:15:02] he dwelleth with you and shall be in you
[1:15:09] so he was with them he's identifying the
[1:15:14] day of visitation it is the preparation
[1:15:18] for them to be made ready for him to
[1:15:22] come in them and he shall be in you I
[1:15:27] will not look at this I will not leave
[1:15:31] you comfortless I will come to you it
[1:15:37] wasn't a corporal body coming on the day
[1:15:39] of Pentecost but the eye he who was
[1:15:44] speaking here behind the veil the vessel
[1:15:48] that was speaking here the Lord Himself
[1:15:50] said I will come to you hallelujah
[1:15:57] this is the day of visitation yet a
[1:16:01] little while and the world seeth me no
[1:16:04] more but you see me because I live ye
[1:16:09] shall live also out that day your know
[1:16:16] that I am in the father ye and me and I
[1:16:20] in you see these are words seeds that's
[1:16:26] being sown
[1:16:29] you know the Bible with that dwelling on
[1:16:32] it too much here this evening the Bible
[1:16:35] declares there is the Mora that of the
[1:16:39] former rain the sowing then there is
[1:16:42] that of the latter rain which is the
[1:16:44] maturing rain the Bible speaks that now
[1:16:48] that both of those rains will come down
[1:16:50] together is that right and to recognize
[1:16:55] that the same one that does the sowing
[1:16:58] is the same one that brings the material
[1:17:01] it's the same one all the time
[1:17:03] he said I'm the Alpha and the Omega is
[1:17:08] that right now to think about here were
[1:17:11] promises that were sown promises that
[1:17:14] were made through the Church of the
[1:17:16] Living God in that hour you know the
[1:17:18] Bible tells us in Joel chapter 2 verse
[1:17:21] 28
[1:17:22] there was the promise where it says in
[1:17:24] the last days brother man picks it up
[1:17:26] like this and mighty God he said in the
[1:17:28] last days there would be a latter rain
[1:17:30] poured out upon the people in the last
[1:17:32] days he said the Greek word there is
[1:17:34] kenosis which means he emptied his self
[1:17:37] out this is not trickles this is empty
[1:17:44] in the bottle not in the way that we
[1:17:48] would say like something was inside of
[1:17:50] somebody that he emptied how but he
[1:17:53] poured himself out he changed his in
[1:18:00] more faith he changed from what it was
[1:18:03] to what he is he never changes his
[1:18:06] nature but on the day of Pentecost he
[1:18:09] changed himself from being the son of
[1:18:11] man to the son of God he came not with
[1:18:15] the people he came in the people the
[1:18:19] same God to carry his ministry on
[1:18:23] through in this great age it's Christ in
[1:18:29] you the Holy Ghost that packs the
[1:18:31] message
[1:18:34] hello but same god emptying himself out
[1:18:38] you know what he's gonna have vessels
[1:18:40] that are emptied up that's what he was
[1:18:45] doing to Sarah
[1:18:46] he was emptying her up so he could fill
[1:18:49] her up he was casting out unbelief the
[1:18:54] word cast out unbelief the word cast out
[1:18:59] doubt that same word here tonight that
[1:19:03] discerns the very thoughts and intents
[1:19:05] of the heart where God would know your
[1:19:07] need right here tonight even from
[1:19:09] something that could have been studied
[1:19:11] here weeks ago but God knew you would be
[1:19:14] here tonight God knows the needs you
[1:19:16] would have in your life God knows the
[1:19:19] effect that he would have through his
[1:19:21] word in our life you do not get snow
[1:19:23] accident the word is a discerner what's
[1:19:28] he doing he's emptying of Sarah so he
[1:19:31] can pour himself in you see that's why
[1:19:34] you and I are his workmanship well I'm
[1:19:38] gonna clean myself up save your time let
[1:19:42] him clean you up I'm gonna do this save
[1:19:46] your time say Lord I give myself to you
[1:19:49] Lord if you see something there that's
[1:19:52] in your life maybe it's a little bit you
[1:19:54] say Lord wash all down wash all unbelief
[1:19:57] wash out loud I want to be filled out
[1:20:00] with God I want to be filled up with the
[1:20:03] fullness of God in my life every area of
[1:20:07] my life every door of my life every
[1:20:10] avenue of my life I wanted to be filled
[1:20:12] with him because the call is to finish
[1:20:18] the Great Commission
[1:20:24] the profit has come the profit is gone
[1:20:27] the message has been delivered that same
[1:20:32] message is being preached seeds that was
[1:20:38] already sown seeds that we saw come to
[1:20:45] maturity well you know what you do with
[1:20:47] seeds that come to maturity harvest them
[1:20:50] eat them and so back come on somebody
[1:20:54] that's why even looking at the word I
[1:20:57] could know that pull older ones right
[1:20:59] here tonight veterans right throughout
[1:21:01] here brother day different ones you know
[1:21:03] it'll be a different ones throughout
[1:21:04] this congregation and if I asked you the
[1:21:06] question when does this winter the
[1:21:09] message itself does it mean more to you
[1:21:11] now or did it mean more two years ago
[1:21:13] there's no doubt you could sit right
[1:21:15] here and brother Dave and different ones
[1:21:16] that say it was precious to me in the
[1:21:19] hour that I first believed but it's
[1:21:21] become more real and more dear and more
[1:21:24] precious as the time is gone by it's
[1:21:26] become more real things that I thought I
[1:21:28] saw and now seeing a greater life it's
[1:21:31] more personal
[1:21:32] my faith is rising even to a level I've
[1:21:35] never even thought of before why it's
[1:21:38] the work of the word in our midst
[1:21:43] his work in our lives I'll tell you you
[1:21:48] can't take this word in your life and
[1:21:50] remain the same I'll tell you this right
[1:21:54] now you can't feed on this word and
[1:21:56] remain the same I said feed on it you
[1:21:59] can't feed on this word and still remain
[1:22:02] the same what I do keep eating the word
[1:22:07] pray over that word amen as constant
[1:22:11] Lord take out all unbelief wash out all
[1:22:14] trash out of my life Lord God I tell you
[1:22:17] invite him in like that that's what he
[1:22:19] wants out of our lives because it's the
[1:22:22] day of visitation that word has
[1:22:27] transforming power
[1:22:31] hallelujah that's why brother BAM could
[1:22:34] say and who is this Melchizedek he said
[1:22:36] if you have not given yourself to fully
[1:22:38] feed on the world will you do so now
[1:22:41] that you might be able to fly above the
[1:22:43] things of the world and say your don't
