it's not a good time for the world but we're not focused on the world our focus is on him and in him this is where we receive our strength and our comfort you know you think of how that the Lord Jesus said when you begin to see these things take place lift up your head for your Redemption draweth nigh and the Prophet takes that scripture and says that lifting up of our head he said is that drawing out of denominations lift up thy head and no wonder the inspiration David said now is my head lifted up above mine enemies amen God giving a sight beyond that of this world we know we know very soon and very soon amen we're gonna be leaving amen don't you love him tonight well we just want to turn our attention to the word tonight and just ask that the Lord would just have his way we think thank

better and so we just just so thankful to the Lord for that well let's look here in revelations chapter eleven tonight and we'll see how the Lord will take us once you have that let's just we'll just ask his blessing on the word before we go in to read it tonight dear Lord Jesus father we are so so grateful Lord for the hour this time Lord that we were living Lord O God we were thankful father and Lord that you have chosen us Lord you have ordained us and you've equipped us Lord for this moment and father we pray that this evening Lord God that by your divine power Lord if there would be one

you would come Lord made Oh God the Holy Spirit by divine revelation Lord just break forth upon our hearts tonight Lord I ask that you would just guide them let the Lord the words and the lips Lord of my mouth Oh God that father it would speak Lord just Lord what you would desire for us to say tonight Lord may you father cause our understanding to be made fruitful Lord we pray Lord we just give ourselves to you now Lord for your glory and honor we ask it Lord your blessing upon the word in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen revelations 11 verse 3 and I will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days clothed in sackcloth these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth and if any man will hurt them fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth or enemies and if any man will hurt them he must in this manner be killed these have power to shut heaven and it rain not in the days of their prophecy and have power over waters to turn them to blood and to smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will amen may God bless you bless the reading of his word as you're being seated I would also like us if we could turn to revelation 6 and we want to look in Revelation 6 at verse 12 and I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the Sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is taken of a mighty wind I realized tonight I haven't read all of the scriptures tonight that would go and pertain here in revelations 11 in the unfolding of the Ministry of the two witnesses the two olive trees those that God has reserved the two prophets to minister there and bring forth the Feast of Trumpets and call Israel to the the true atonement and make make them ready as a people that he would step forth and make himself known and is in a physical coming to them but I want to draw if we could tonight upon a few points here within this this scripture because when we when we look at it here in the scriptures we we recognize that this of the sixth seal it's a breaking fourth of tribulation but it's a Ministry of the two witnesses to that of Israel it's the time to Israel that of the Gentiles days that's that's finished yet there will be those out of the Gentiles who did not receive the Holy Ghost that you know they will be part as it mentions in Revelations 12 they will be hunted down for the for the testimony that they would hold and you know they would be purged through that time but right now as the bride of Jesus Christ this is where by God's grace that we receive our purging right now through him by the blood of the Lamb were made ready the revelation of Jesus Christ breaks for upon our life the spirit of atonement the holy spirit the token life comes to seal us and baptize us into that body of Jesus Christ and when we look here upon this in this part of it I I want to go into tonight in just to pause a moment here what we're looking at with Israel because you see when we look upon all of these things what God is preparing to do with Israel in just that of as the Scriptures would say that of a day you find that God himself has been doing this work for the Gentiles gathering a people out of the Gentiles for his namesake and making us ready for his literal corporal coming and Israel these two prophets cannot step on the scene under that anointing of the Holy Spirit the power of God as the scripture says in verse three I will give power unto my two witnesses they they cannot step on the scene until the bride is taken our home so we realized that everything itself even to where the Prophet would make the statement in recognizing your day and its message and he would say at that time I cannot see anything left but for the going home of the bride and then the stepping forth of the two witnesses there to call out the 144,000 and I want to draw upon this part here in this look at the thought on the unfolding of his coming and when we think of the unfolding of his coming you look here in the scripture and we see from that of verse three in revelations eleven I will give power unto my two witnesses and then you notice in there in verse 12 of Revelation six and I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal and brother Branham lays lays it out without me reading word-for-word and going through it but this the sixth seal itself is opened by the ministry of these two prophets so it's the power of God that is released as the scripture said the power of God the quickening power of God that is released that then through the Ministry of the two witnesses that the hundred and forty-four thousand they themselves come in to repentance and they are sealed and made ready for the coming of the Lord so in when we look at this the power that is given and this is what I want to draw our attention to as brother brems says they're given power on miheer of God of the word of God to condemn nature nature itself is interrupted as the Scripture speaks of this and I I want you to think of it in this term that when we look at this the whole part of it that when we think of these two witnesses here the two prophets of Moses and Elijah as they receive the power to open the sixth seal which it's a Ministry of the Feast of the trumpets which is a gathering it's a gathering there of the Jews and it this is the same thing what takes place is prepared to take place there with the sixth trumpet to the Jews is the same thing that takes place here with the seventh seal for us as the bride of Jesus Christ and I don't want it so much that you're our thoughts would be caught within terms but I want us to truly to understand that as God has ordained that the sixth seal itself here is power released to the two witnesses who are present to open that sixth seal there to the Jews likewise God himself but promise of his word had a seventh angel messenger on earth that he could release the power in order to bring and open their and unfold the mystery of the coming of the Lord and you see that within that because within this word there is power there is glory that is sealed within it and when it is just written letter in in it in itself is glory but when it is opened then the very power and the that is contained within it is is meant to be opened and there's a people on the earth in whom and that word is open the power of God is poured out in an anointing upon our lives and it anoints us for what God is calling for and that is the rapture of the Church of the Living God because down through the ages now the Holy Spirit has went down through the Gentile ages and he's been calling a people for his name's sake he's been gathering them and they they are those who are born of his spirit and remember there's many that have been laid to sleep down through every age and they have been waiting for the coming of the Lord they have looked with an anticipation for his coming even as Paul would write Paul believed that he would see it even within his day and to think of how that this is made known within this hour that even the very mystery of his coming in itself is a secret it's a secret that the enemy himself cannot pry into though we look at it and we can hear it as far as a word that is gone forth a word that is ministered but the secret that lays within it is that mystery of where Christ himself comes into the life in that token that reality of the new birth and it makes it real to you and I that we are a part of his coming we are a part and the reason of his coming his first coming that he might make us ready then for his second coming so when we think of this but because when you look at it here the seventh angel now listen now those two witnesses they do not have power in themselves the scripture said they were given power you see they had here they are there is power that is to be released and ordained that they themselves can begin to open that sixth seal there then it's the same way with the seventh angel being the seventh star in the right hand of God and the right hand being that of power and authority there is power that is released by Almighty God as the Prophet would say in the eastern sea in the Easter he says the opening of these seals is the releasing of the quickening power to the Church of the Living God to make us ready and he said it depends on your attitude toward it whether or not it will have any effect or do you any good and we want to have the right attitude toward the quickening power of God and to recognize that when you think of it here you know when you look at it just a moment here here they are they will stand even in that time receiving a power to open that sixth seal and God within this hour he has anointed that seventh angel messenger there with the quickening power and notice friends it did not stay there with a seventh angel messenger but remember here the Bible says in Revelations 10 verse 8 through 11 it says go and take the little book that is open in the hand of the angel that standeth on the land and the sea so to recognize this power that has come to open the word for you and I to tie together the entire Bible and release the power of God within that word that makes a people ready for the coming of the Lord because the Lord Jesus himself he said when I return will I find faith that was the question when I return will I find faith so there is a people if God is doing this as he will to the to those of the 144,000 they've got to be gathered together it's got to be their time the power is released to open that seal and their understanding will come and they will come to recognize him as the true atonement then what about that of the opening of the Seventh Seal where the power of God moves down and there's a people on earth that are actually caught in that revelation of the mystery of his going there's got to be a breaking forth and it is that power that makes you and I Oh Evan brother sister it's not just a power of something of knowledge no sir this is a power that is poured out upon the sons and daughters of God it's not just that of the little portion this is the very fullness of Christ himself it is that which is made way for the very person of Jesus Christ to step forth why because he's been making up his body down through the ages little by little he said upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it he's been building his church by himself he's used his used vessels but it's him he gave power to them do you realize who gave power to Peter to preach on the day of pinnacles he did he released power that makes it come into that word and then that word that promise now the power in blessing and glory and honor in that word is poured out upon the people of God and we are not Outsiders but we are brought into him so to think here that this this reality I'll tell you like this if the sixth seal as it says they have power to interrupt nature let me tell you something this reality of the unfolding of the coming of the Lord let me tell you something this word has went forth to interrupt nature in our lives but let me tell you something there is gonna there is an interaction that takes place by the change of the new birth amen and we also are going to be we are part of this to be changed in a moment and at weakling laughs look be to God to be able to to pass from death unto life now think of how brother branham brings it like this in the message contest and he says Lord make us fit servants forgive our past bless our future guide us Oh Lord God with our mighty hand Jehovah blessed these ministers here bless all the laity and all the visitors be thou with us Lord we are your servants and we give ourselves wholly to you for 1963 but the power of your spirit might have more preeminence 'as in our life in an hour be help us God forgive us and help us we pray raise up mighty men raise up mighty warriors of the faith open this year Lord that hidden manna that rocked beneath the rock that we might see the program of God amen the program of God that we might see God's program and tap off the pyramids of our life Lord put the capstone Christ Jesus upon each and every one of us and may his magnificent holy blessings be upon us all may the power of the Holy Ghost come upon us may the power of the resurrection be manifested God how we thank you tonight we are yours and we give ourselves fully to you Lord now when we look here in in the Bible it says in Revelations 8 verse 1 and when he had opened the Seventh Seal There was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour now we realize that down through the ages remember he made a promise that if I go away I will come again and I will receive you unto myself that where I am you may be also so he has made a promise here that he was going to return and to think that how that the ages this has been the longing of the Church of the Living God down through time now remember here in the coming of the Lord even when Jesus was standing there and I speaks I believe it's there in John chapter 20 when he speaks to John the Beloved the disciple says what is it to thee if he tarry till I come and here the Lord Jesus remember the Bible says many that went about a saying you know that he was this disciple was not going to die until the Lord come but you see there was a hidden mystery even within that but here John himself would be set aside into the Isle of Patmos now this was a test this was a trial but you see in the midst of that time right there how that God was able to make himself known to John I believe if all my smell I believe with all my heart God gave sufficient grace for John to be available for God to speak to him what does that say to you and I in the midst of our tests and our trials they don't give me sufficient grace that I can be available that you can speak to me and encouraged me and strengthened me and reveal yourself in the sweetness and the power of your glory because that's exactly what happened here to John you see he unfolded his coming to John and when we look at this and it's in this hour you know that we are living and we we hear it and you know many you know we've heard this over and over now the message of the hour and and the promise of God's Word the opening of these seven seals but to remember here listen to me now I'm not gonna deal so much with this tonight but when we look at that of the seven seals we look so many times on the way that we are looking at things in terms of school like one two three four five six seven but the reality of it is is that there could not be any opening of any other seal if the seventh was not open first the seventh itself had to be opened first in that the seventh remember bill mem says he took the seals off himself he said he is those seals because you see out of that the opening because remember the coming of the word must be revealed in that of where he's coming to receive a people on for his namesake before then he opens and turns to the Jews you see the coming of the Lord making known and bringing the Gentiles unto Him in rapture it is within that seven seal and the actual moving listen to me now even in that where the two witnesses receive power and the sixth seal is opened that also falls under that seven seal and all of those things lead up to but coming and the climax it's all ties together in the coming of the Lord it has its parts within it that the Lord help us we'll deal with that even just a little bit more but to see this opening of where we're living we're living in an hour in a time that in reality he can come in any moment don't be get your hopes on other things in this and that's got to take place it's to live for his coming and I'm gonna tell you tonight it might shake your little bit but when you're living for it's coming you don't have to be made to live for his coming it is within your heart that beats for his coming this is why there must be a coming of the Holy Ghost the life of Jesus Christ in the believer by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that then makes us aware of the day our day its message and where we are well that's grace that's grace to think of it a power to live in overcoming life in this hour so how that you know Villa random will mention this in many terms when we think of him coming in the fullness of his power he will speak of it even in the rising of the Sun as the bride coming out of Christ into where that now dear the bride herself coming now to a fullness said the finishing up now of the mystery of God to where now that church that bride that he's been building now to where that she is coming now into that place to where that he himself is able to move in her in the fullness of the power of the Resurrection I want you to notice this if you know if you haven't noticed that I want you to think of this all throughout the message the Prophet and even as it continues to move in 1965 he said here he is appearing in our flesh in the fullness of his power he did not say in my flesh he said in our flesh because remember he identified himself with the Church of the Living God come on somebody he has to be in order to be four-bed of us so it is Christ himself appearing in the power of his resurrection to make a people ready for his corporal coming not to think of this and how that God would make would make these things real and alive to us and to see that all the way through all the way through the scriptures this becoming of the Lord it's been unfolded there's been one goal that God has had one great achievement everything itself has spoke of this great achievement of his coming I want to look here in the Book of Daniel look at Daniel here in Chapter nine and to see how that here Daniel himself in Daniel 9 verse 1 in the year in the first year of Darius the son of a hey xerus of the seed of the Metis which was made king over the realm of the Chaldees in the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years I want you to catch this even though Daniel had the books he did not understand until this time because when we we look at this we're up notice understood by books the number of the years where of the word of the Lord King to Jeremiah the Prophet so here of how that God would make known to him that he would accomplish 70 years in the desolations of Jerusalem God would open to Daniel then even in this year this even of the 70 years that they were there in Babylon when you read in Jeremiah 29 you see that that in itself was even as they exiled to Babylon was even a type of when they would reject the Messiah and how that Israel would be scattered but remember he said I know the thoughts that I think toward you to give you to bring you to an expected end is that right and he says when you shall begin to seek me with all your heart then I shall be found of you in me wonderful there to know that it's God who stirs our hearts for us to even to seek and desire him it's because he himself is stirring that desire that we would see that to him and they see here is Daniel in this time no matter how Daniel no doubt he laid but it was and then I'll say like this he won the Daniel let the dirt the books collect dust but he was there God had reserved to a certain time and he wasn't that Daniel didn't pour over the word but you see God opens his word in a certain season and God will open and as we see here with Daniel by certain channels and it doesn't matter everything else could be pried into it but you see when God reveals they don't have to be no prying because it is not something that is given by the power of man he said I will give power he opens it now to see how that he said so in verse three I set my face unto the Lord God to seek by prayer and applications and fasting in sack cloth and ashes you see how Daniel is understanding it brings desperation you see then when Daniel his understanding is being made fruitful Daniel begins to repent sackcloth and ashes see the revealing is the revealing of that word it does not bring haughtiness it brings humility when the word is truly being revealed it brings us to a situation even when you look at Isaiah there has to be an initial reality strike our hearts I am undone and when the word is continually being revealed it is not a word that brings us puffed up but it brings us and the reality of the spirit of grace being poured out if we recognize it is God that is given power for this word to be open to us that we might understand it you know what it does it brings humility in our hearts and our lives it doesn't bring a big eye and a little you that's what knowledge does but divine revelation it realizes it puts you and I to the awareness that I am nothing without him though i've looked at this i've studied it I've looked over it but I'm nothing without him and even what he reveals it will take the divine operation of the power of God that's opened it up to come upon my life and that my life will be brought subject to be a reflection of what he has opened by his quickening power glory be to God hallelujah not to think in verse 21 the Bible said while I was speaking in prayer even the man Gabriel Hamas had seen in the vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touch me about the time of the evening oblation and he informed me and talked with me and said Oh Daniel I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding in that wonderful I'm come forth for this reason to give thee skill and understanding hmm I'll tell you right now if then you're wouldn't know if then you wouldn't humbled himself that had never been no visit of Gabriel but you see in order for more to unfold is what how did he respond with what was made known to him oh you see what was opened to Daniel in order for more to be unfolded it would require humility old friends let me tell you a great treasure in this hour is that to be able to where God Himself is brother Ram said he said God has a hard time he gets a man and he said that man sees a little something he said and he gets so inflated in himself and God has to put him on the Shelf because he can't use him no more why because it's not the man studying an ability that has given him that understanding you realize friends we study we give ourselves to the Lord but it has to be God to come down and tie it all together that's the same way where you and I we give ourselves to that Ministry of the word but it takes the power of Almighty God to move down in our lives there in your military as we pray Lord be it unto me according to my word Lord let my life match this word Lord God let what I'm hearing Lord be reflected in my life Lord God Lord I want to just give myself even more help me Lord if there's areas of my life Lord that I need to surrender lord help me to surrender in a deeper way help me to get my eyes off of everything else and let it be focused on you at the beginning of that supplications the commandment came forth and I'm come to show thee for thou art greatly beloved so Daniel was making supplications requests and I'm come to show thee for thou art greatly beloved therefore understand the matter and consider the vision he said seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city to finish the transgression and to make an end of sins and to make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in everlasting righteousness and to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy all of this being unfolded verse twenty-five know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks and threescore and two weeks the street shall be built again and the wall even in trouble sometimes and after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not for himself Daniel by the grace of God can see that what is determined for his people and how that God would break it down within those seven weeks that then when the Messiah would come the Lord Jesus in the midst of the week he would be cut off not for himself they would be rejected he would be crucified what he would offer up his own blood but then when we look at this here that within verse 26 what we what we come to understand that we remember everything itself even when you look at how the disciples would ask the Lord Jesus there in the opening of Acts and they said will you at this time restore the kingdom unto Israel remember that's millennium questions right there will you at this time restore the kingdom unto Israel they're still looking at that because of the promise of where there is to be a restoration for Israel now when you look at this here you know to think of it when we look at the scripture and we take into account blindness you know friends to realize that the blindness itself is even that of where that they would read the Old Testament prophecies and they would even see the things that would be mentioned in there about the Gentiles but yet their understanding would not be opened to it because it wasn't for them it wasn't for them to understand that to realize they read this in the book of Isaiah friends you you understand that as Bible readers it's littered all the way and I I don't let me say littered I mean to say it scattered it's all throughout the whole Old Testament of how that God Himself would deal and take a people out of the Gentiles this wasn't just a few isolated scriptures here and there it was loaded throughout the Old Testament but yet to see how that God would keep back from them and understanding and what they were looking for they ended up missing it because it didn't come according to their understanding and that is God's grace to you and I and that's why I want to look at a little bit because in the unfolding of his coming he come to redeem when you think of this here in verse 26 that in the midst of the three-and-a-half weeks here is where the mystery of the Gentiles comes in I want you to think of this here in Galatians chapter 3 verse 6 even as abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness know you therefore that they which are of faith the same are the children of Abraham and the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto Abraham saying in thee shall all nations be blessed so then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham so God had already preached this mystery it said already notice what Paul was doing you see Paul is giving the unfolding in the mystery of this ministry that let was hidden there within the Lord Jesus Christ in the coming of the Messiah that which was hidden within that of the covenants that was laying there but now how the spirit of understanding would break forth Paul couldn't have done that it took the same power of God to come upon God that Paul could actually see this come on friends Paul had earthly power and he was killing the very Church of the Living God Paul ah persecutest thou me but you see once he got harnessed by the power of God Paul was a part of the Church of the Living God and there was a purpose there was a commission for his life that pertained to the Gentiles so when you look at this here in the scripture we find this unfolding of the coming of the Lord I had trusted simple to us tonight and I trusted he'll make it simple because he's the one that has to do it we recall in the scriptures here when we look back clear in the times of Joseph we see that type of Joseph with that of the Lord Jesus whether youíre lies that Joseph himself he rose to power but Joseph rose to power remember when after that his his brethren had sold him into slavery they rejected him they despised him they sold him into slavery they told a lie him but you see as they went on down into their land remember Joseph himself God had his hand upon Joseph's life Joseph was sold into slavery come on friends God Himself became one of us he was sold into slavery and then - think about it he was raised there raised up there out out of the out of the that the slavery and then we recognize that how that you know he went then into prison and then after prison prison because of a false accusation but then after prison here remember now God supernaturally watch this now it was not anything that Joseph could do in his own accord to bring him into position but there was a supernatural gift a power that was present there that God could move in his life and then what was it it was God providing for himself Oh glory be to God it is God who makes a way that you and I might come into the position that he has ordained for our lives and like brother Adam could say looking back on Joseph he said it was something there a little pride that had to get worked out of his life in order for him to rise but we know there was not know no pride at all in that of the Lord Jesus but he erases the power where there's no one else that's more powerful than that of Pharaoh and he himself rose to the right hand of Pharaoh speaking of that of the Lord Jesus and he was given a Gentile bride I want you to think of this in Genesis 41 44 and pharaoh said unto joseph i am Pharaoh and without these shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt and Pharaoh called Joseph's name zaphenath-paneah the revealer of the secret things and he gave him to wife Inessa the daughter of Potiphar priest of on and Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt so here while is away well they have rejected Joseph here Joseph they don't they're not aware of it they didn't see this but why Joseph was down there he takes a Gentile bride gonna be too drunk they're not even they're not aware of this and then to see remember what Joseph had made known in the taking of this Gentile bride but their God had made known there was a famine now all of this was sealed there in the dream that God had given to Pharaoh there's nobody that could break and open that seal but God Himself gave power and understanding that Joseph might interpret and see that dream what was that when that dream was opened he became a Ministry of life it became a Ministry of preservation it's the same way it was when that impending judgment was upon all the wise men down there at Babylon it was Daniel who in in took his brethren had said that I seek for the mercies of God and what did God do God opened to them he broke the seal of understanding to where that they themselves would be able to stand there before Nebuchadnezzar and make known to him the interpretation of the dream what was that it was a Ministry of life that preserved life when death was impending upon the wise men there was one who stood up in the midst of that time and God granted power there in that hour for seal to be broken now to think of this how the Joseph he goes remember everything itself is laid in place that there would be a stirring up of the grain now you and I realized grain itself is seed and within seed is life right son to think of it how that he himself has preserved that there would be pouring out of seed life upon the seeds that he has planted within each bed of time are you with me it has to be the seed life coming upon the seed of God and his seed life which is the region of the spoken word when that seed life of the water strikes a seed of God they become a son and daughter of God what is it it is called by His mercies that has reserved reserved in the storehouse of his word in the secret of his presence come on somebody the storehouse is not a physical building somewhere the storehouse is not a CD a DVD book or tape to hold somebody but the storehouse itself remember now that storehouse it is a place of safety it is when they came to the storehouse whether they were the storehouse a storehouse be straw house see you know in the world it says that when they went there they were coming as unto Joseph because what was it it was that preservation that had been made in order to preserve life when famine was strike in the earth that life itself would come forth or to think of this hour that God has manifested listen to me now God has manifested in this hour to you and I he said I'll not leave myself without a witness I'm not gonna leave my blood here in Satan's Eden but I've got sufficient store for the hour I have got all that you have need up for this hour and it is him are Joseph the Lord Jesus Christ that is releasing to you and I what we have neither deer else we could have the tapes and yet still not being storehouse now being released grains not being released we can know all the words and yet grains are not being released because remember this is not natural grains this is not about putting grains together come on somebody this is about Joseph himself the Lord Jesus Christ revealing himself to his beloved this is part of the coming of the Lord notice as he reveals himself in through his brethren for glory I'm doing all I can just to stay on this little thing that he gave me tonight Oh glory be to God Genesis 45 7 here he is revealing himself to his brother notice what he makes her known to his brother God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth can we say lord help me to look at my trials that way let me be so refreshed by the Spirit of God that I can stand this way Joseph this listen listen this was a type this was a type but divine love he had given divine love place listen friends as according to the allotment of what could be measured out within that hour because they could not receive the Holy Ghost it could not be poured out in that hour but according to what could be they allowed themselves to be refreshed by the Lord oh god help us and God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance so now it was not that you you that sent me hither but God you sold me but it wasn't you it was God who had me come this way Oh glory be to God see the unfolding is the unfolding in his presence you think Joseph didn't shout when this struck his heart you think it didn't make him joy and that's what my just in these verses here I'm talking about to where that God had made this and known to him it made him rejoice you oughta made him do it made it long for little Benjamin glory be to God Oh hallelujah think of this of how I just want to refer to this a moment you find that hound that even when Joseph would bring his two sons that were born to him there while he was in Egypt Ephraim and Manasseh and I just referred to it because I there's some other things I want to read here found that he would hear ephraim and manasseh being born and hound that when he brought him forth he brought him forth in the seemingly the right order so that even Israel's right hand that you know that it would be upon the rat head and and things but notice how that God moved and God guided the hand and to think of how that bit Jacob I love this scripture in Genesis 48 16 when Jacob went forth and there was a crossing of the hands look at this blessing in Genesis 48 16 the angel which redeemed me from all evil bless the lads you see Jacob realized it was the angel that redeemed me there was the angel of the Lord that released Israel that was a prisoner in Jacob it was the age of the Lord that released you and me amen the age of the Lord that release the blessing as it says for Jacob that he blessed him they're not the ground there Joseph he saw that the right hand was up on Ephraim and it displeased him verse 17 and he held up his father's hands to remove it Joseph said to his father not so my father for this is the first board put my right hand upon he said his father refused and said I know it I know it the crossing of the hands where that the blessing itself would pass upon the Gentiles the blessing of Abraham that belongeth to the firstborn but you see the mystery of it was there was some firstborn of his brethren firstborn there of his wife look at this here in Galatians 3 verse 13 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith Paul said in Romans 11:25 for how we're not brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery lest you should by your wise in your own conceits that the blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in there is a finishing up of the Gentiles and we're in that hour right now not to think of mouths that Paul would go on and lay this out in first Corinthians 2 I'm just moving through these scriptures here how Paul would say howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to nought but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory which none of the princes of this world knew this was very important for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord Gouri if Israel had recognized it they wouldn't have crucified him listen to me now but if they would not have crucified him not only you and I would not have brought in but remember he had to be led as a lamb to the slaughter he had to give his life the cadaval age he had to give his life willingly and God blind to them the princes of this world if they had known it they would not have crucified him this is God's grace notice the Lord Jesus speaks even referring to Isaiah chapter 42 when he wouldn't make known to them after the Pharisees had went out and held a council against him how they might destroy him but when Jesus knew it he would drew himself from fence and a great multitude followed him and He healed them all and he charged them that they should not make him known think of this Jesus is not playing around with words he told he charged him don't make this no you know what I think of I think oh how that when you look at the friends if it if it could have been known it could have changed a lot of things but he charged them don't make this known you look at how that even when many have tried to get over there into the Jews but remember there it will be the Ministry of Moses and Elijah reham personated again the same characteristics of the elijah ministry and moses ministry Rhian personated in the two witnesses that god has ordained i'll tell you right now tonight they can be there right now tonight what are they waiting on they're waiting on us to get out of the way and when we're taken out of the way the power comes to strike them to be able to move in to that ministry for the hundred and forty-four thousand they've got to be in position in a place to receive that necessary power to open that sixth seal what about you and I there's got to be a necessary placement in the Lord Jesus Christ the chosen place of worship like Enoch that we might receive that charge of translation power and be taken from this earth enrapturing redeeming Grace power that's granted remember token of the random brother Ram was ready to go over there stay don't go in there it's not for you it's not their time yet God has everything in time don't he we're glory be to God but there was nothing wrong with the anticipation for wanting to go this is a time for rejoicing with this of what we're seeing rejoice with Israel notice verse 17 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying behold my servant whom I have chosen my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased I will put my spirit upon him and he shall show judgment to the Gentiles he shall not strive nor cry neither shall any man hear his voice in the street a bruised Reed shall he not break and a smoking flax shall he not quenched till he's sin forth judgment unto victory and in his name shall the Gentiles trust our Boaz is not gonna rest until judgment has went forth unto victory Amen our ball has is not resting but we are resting in him you think of this of how that even this was among the Jews you know there were elect use there were those the Bible says it was waiting on the consolation of Israel right Simeon Anna then you find even their of the Apostles Peter James Bartholomew Mark Luke all of those and here they were as Jews but they were elect in that of the Gentile bride they were a part of the bride so much so to wear the very body is built upon the holy prophets and apostles are you is me there is a word that was delivered the the word was given in that hour the truth of the things that you and I are brought back to by the grace of God in this hour it was delivered to them and in this hour it's an hour of restoring now what you think of this when he poured out here his spirit remember when when God you see shows you how how that this was hidden of hound that even when it came to Peter and Peter remember when God had to deal with him and finally has Peter submitted to the voice of God and he went to Cornelius house Cornelius being a Gentile and then how that when they came under the word that was ministered in that hour it was the word in the Ministry of the fulfillment of all of what the prophets had spoken of what the word had called for in that of Jesus Christ the Messiah and then to see how that the Holy Ghost was poured out upon Cornelius and his household now think of this after the Holy Ghost was poured out upon them then remember the scripture said can we forbid these to be baptized seeing that they have received the Holy Ghost such as we had now remember when Peter got back to Jerusalem they were questioning him why did you go among the Gentiles but you see Peter himself he had a vindication that was not a man vindication but it was God giving witness there of a mystery that even Peter and the rest of them could not see in that time because member the ministry to that of the Gentiles was not given to people but God was er was letting it be known that he has accepted Jew and Gentile in the outpouring of the blessing of Abraham in that of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you cannot argue with the baptism of the Holy Ghost because that of the Holy Ghost is the very person of Jesus Christ it's a confirmation a personal witness it is a seal of God himself so they could not reject that so that even had to be open remember remember there was great contention you watch how all this convention followed in the even throughout the the early church you had men that could not cross over fully come on you had men listen to me now you had people who was around and they understood even they had an understanding as far as hearing what Paul and them was saying and what was going on and what was being spoken from that of even in in the book of Acts but remember here they weren't men that were converted because Paul never called them there he said men and many times he said false brethren he called him false workers come on he said men he never called him brethren you see what it was and identified them and what they were trying to do is to take away from the simplicity that was in Jesus Christ you see that's the devil's objective is to try to get people's focus on things that are not the real kernel of the message and if he can get people to focus on things that are not the real kernel they miss what the message is all about and it passes right through the myths and they don't recognize it because just like the Pharisees the Pharisees was caught up with pots and pans and eaten with unwashen hands they were caught up on things that was not the message come on somebody and the message itself is the kernel life the revelation of Jesus Christ the literal life of Jesus Christ that token the fullness of his power Amen no let the devil distract you with frivolous little things but keep your focus on the Lord Jesus Christ for them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation let me just read a few more places and we'll stop you tonight look what if Paul has given testimony in Exodus acts 26 15 and I said who art our Lord and he said I am Jesus whom thou persecutors but rise and stand upon their feet for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen and of the things into which I will appear to thee delivering me from the people and from the Gentiles unto whom now I send thee to open their eyes to turn them from darkness to light from the power of Satan unto God do you see what is saying here God is releasing power his quickening power God is releasing this to where that Paul the ministry would be an opening of eyes and a turning from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God that they may receive forgiveness of sin and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me that is why Paul could say our gospel came out in word only but in power in demonstration to over be to God Paul goes on to say in Romans 15 15 nevertheless brethren I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort as putting you in mind because of the grace that is given to me of God that I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles men during the gospel of God that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable being sanctified by the Holy Ghost Romans 16:25 now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret since the world began but now is made manifest and by the scriptures of the prophets according to the commandment of the everlasting God made known to all nations for the obedience of faith to God only wise be glory through Jesus Christ for ever and ever amen real quick Ephesians 3 3 how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery I want you to think of this Paul was already persecuting the church that God had to make known to him by revelation the mystery of the church and that being that which was hidden in Christ in God from before the foundation of the world and I wrote a for in a few words whereby when you read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men and as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel Titus 2:11 for the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the Great God and our Savior Jesus Christ who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works here's the mystery of Ruth there's the mystery of Rahab this is where Paul would go on in Ephesians 5 and he would say husbands love your wives even as Christ so loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word that he might present unto himself a glorious church without having any spot wrinkle blemish or any such thing and he said this mystery I speak concerning Christ and the church it was a mystery held within him that in the midst of the seven weeks the Messiah he was cut off that the Gentiles that Joseph might take a bride unto himself and to think when he gathers and reveals himself to his brethren let me put it in the words that the Prophet said it in the fifth seal he will make himself known and say what you intended for evil God meant for good don't more no more I have come I have a wife in the palace and I've come for you we're going to be one big family you see patrols 144,000 they are electing God said I can never forget yes really you're engraved on the palms of my hands we are his wife they are his brethren but through the mystery how that God unfolding is coming taking a people out of the Gentiles for his namesake what grace is given to you and I friends to be able to recognize this in this hour what grace what grace and like Daniel to say Lord to understand by the books to wear that the power the quickening power of God to tie these things together it warms our hearts to see this life move in to our life and change us listen that's what means everything is to be a part of is coming right now to be a part of his coming right now to make sure that you are ready behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him and the wise they had oil in their lamps the foolish had some oil but they let it run out you see friends it's important to make sure that the Holy Ghost that the token it is a token there upon the soul because there upon the soul it can never run out amen behold the bridegroom cometh go you out to meet him what an hour that we're living in it's an hour to be sober to be watchful an hour to be ready as the scripture said for in an hour that you think not even so he cometh but I say to you you're not in the dark that the night should overtake you you are children of the day when we have been born of the light we are of the day we who were sometimes darkness now are ye night in the Lord arise and shine for thy light has come and the glory of the lord has risen upon thee gross darkness shall be seen upon the people but the glory of the Lord shall be seen upon thee in the midst of darkness there is light light in Goshen there is light in our life for if thine eye be single then thy whole body shall be full of light the bride is standing on her feet hey man eyes have come the light has entered and the intelligence of Christ the mind of Christ operating in the body of Jesus Christ you love him in the midst of darkness we are lights shadows of lights yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me and if there's a shadow the Prophet said that shows there's light present because without light there's no shadow but there's light to lead us through oh yes we are going to stand on the other side of the Red Sea I said we are going to stand on the other side of the Red Sea we have come through the sanctifying power of God but that red sea also holds the type as the prophet said there is another great Victory Day coming for the Church of the Living God glory be to God his workmanship or be ready be ready if you're not ready make preparations give it give everything though don't let anything stand in your way give everything to him and don't let lonely little thing little focus is here and there little things be focused on him on him he's the object it's like if you had a garden when you have a garden it's not looking at petunias here and all those things he's the object of the garden the center everything points to him don't let nothing get you sidetracked don't let anything take away but
