amen we'll just let you be seated turn around just wave at somebody then we'll let you be seated here just for a moment amen so good to be in the house of the Lord and amen good to uh I I think it's good to greet one another and uh I I think that's a that's a real we come here for the main purpose and that's to see him and to have a meeting with him but I tell you I certainly I love that to be able to come together and to Fellowship around the word of God it's just something special about it that when we can come together you know even when you look at the very Word Church itself when Jesus said Upon This Rock I will build my church The Very Word Church it means those that are called out of their homes and into a public place for Gathering amen so we we just don't have church by ourselves God God set up the order that we we come together the Bible said forsake not to assemble yourselves together is that right that that's those are things that that God won't do for us but we show our faith just you know just that little bit of of just saying Lord I'm going to honor your word regardless of my feelings and I I may not feel like anything at all and you you might feel like well you know all kinds of Gloom but I'll tell you when you stand and you honor God's word you can expect God to come on the scene hallu sir and I want to remind you there were three times in the year that the males in Israel wter were to present themselves amen and we recognize all that we could get into a lot of types that's three dispensations and Son of God Son of Man son of David and but you know the Bible said they weren't to come empty and I think yet God asks you and I this the greatest desire I have is Lord I don't want anything to hinder you from moving here in this service and moving deeper in my life but yet we're not coming empty we're coming with a purpose we're coming with what all that he's revealed to me up to this time I've given myself too and I'm counting and looking on the word to continue to work and move through my life and to accomplish what the word has said it will do so we're not presenting ourselves empty we we're not empty we're not coming with the blank mind we don't come with a blank slate we've come with a clear direction that we know in whom we have believed and we're persuaded that he is able to keep that which I've committed unto him against the day amen and amen so what a privilege it is to gather together with brothers and sisters of like Precious faith and we certainly love you in the Lord and uh I just uh here in just a moment I some things I want to just kind of touch touch on with you uh before we Minister here uh for a few moments this morning and uh I want to if if you could uh Brianna I'd like you to switch over here there's something that we want to bring to you as an assembly and so uh if you're visiting and we appreciate to have our visitors here with us this morning God bless you amen so good to have you and uh good to have each and everyone and so we want to I want to just kind of uh revisit uh some things and as the uh uh the the trustees and myself we've actually been meeting since um well we meet in regular everything's kept up on a lot of things that we do with um uh and so forth but we had some meetings and because there's a another project we're looking at a beginning uh but I want to just I thought it'd be good to take a look at where that we've come from and you know I'll just be honest with you I've just I've I've so appreciated what has been done here that I I actually I kind of kind of forgot what it used to look like and that's the truth I went back and it was some months ago and it was just you know real late in the evening I was trying to relaxed my mind and I saw this file and it was what brother Shane had put together and this is where everything at one point in time had started from and uh uh you know and that was just a couple years ago and uh you know I I'm just so thankful to the Lord and how that kind of got moved along there in June of 2022 and um you know Brooks concrete they had uh we contracted with them they tore all of that out and and we started and there was a lot of pictures here with all of that taken place I I drove down into the driveway I know brother Shane brother Richie they uh were here with it uh probably brother Aaron was it sometime we we just we weren't always here at the at uh together and and brother Richie had to kind of call their hand on a few things so I I just appreciate you know uh not that they were trying to be Shady so I don't want you think that but you know it's good to have somebody to that you going call them there and say hey wait wait wait this is not how we we we we designed it and so um then even when it came to all of this outside here um that in itself too was much uh how that brother Richie when he drew Drew everything up we had a lot that wanted to try to bid the job and do it a certain way and but I'll tell you I I just think it's I'm just I think it's beautiful and you say brother Samuel you you know you say you you really shouldn't talk about a building like that well look I I know that the the important thing is not the building but I also remember the prophet said now that we've made the be the building beautiful we want to make the inside Beautiful by a character and so when God even told Solomon if you really if you get to nailing it down how much if you would try to get everything together of what Solomon's Temple would cost in today's uh Society it was millions of dollars but God said to bring it make it magnifical that's a that's a word is that right some of you already on edge you don't know where I'm going but uh you know it was not to be something that would be that this is where our stock is in but I believe that you know it it expresses what what we think and what we feel and um you know we're not a we're not a big congregation we're just a a small group of people that love the Lord and you know it's just like as if I read it all the way through the message and I've got so many different quotes and as those things come up and you know in different studies and it's up to God how God brings together even an assembly and how God will add brother Bram said it can be from 5 to 12 to hundreds what what however God sees fit to do it but we're after one thing more than bodies we want to see Christ in the people that's that's the objective that's the objective and we want a rallying we don't want a rallying around a Ministry when we want a rallying around the word amen because that's what brings that's what brings Real Results in our life is where hearts and lives are just grabbing a hold of Jesus Christ and so I believe that's the desire of of all of us and so I I want to just very quickly here touch on this um we're looking at um uh we've been exploring this on a parking lot and driveway project this has actually been something that's kind of been on the docket for a long time but you know it just has things just kind of come up and it just kind of pushes its way on back and um but it's something that we've got a few pictures and there's obviously a whole lot more we could take of it that when Services was going on and you can see individuals I don't know what it looks out looks like out here today because we're missing a number of people but I know at times where it's it's been uh clear through there and people have even parked on the other side of that driveway and down the middle and um so even in some of the uh some of the other the pictures and things like that you can kind of uh see that that you know there's spaces even in the one that's the video there's there was some spaces where we probably could have done a little bit better of fitting in there on that particular day um but I'm thankful that at least we do have a place and we have gravel to park on right now um but we know that one of the things that before we could ever talk about this and the reason it would kind of get moved down the road is because um out here you know in the parking lot sometimes you showed up you you didn't know whether do I bring my kayak my canoe or just drive in and um you know in in reality that that's not uh that was not um us but if you look all up and down a lot of times up and down the road and then you go across um in these areas like even when the brothers are mowing grass and things they have to be so mindful but it's it's much lower the the way that the the the Earth and all of that or the way that they've taken it off it lays and it's very very difficult and so the brothers got together and the first thing we had to do is get drainage and then that took place uh was that two years ago now that drainage took place that that line yeah so it's pretty close to about two years ago in the fall and that drainage they they they've got it so that it goes down that property and we still have some things over here uh to do but you had to get the water off otherwise if you put anything down it's going to bust it up so uh we've been able to uh by the grace of God to do that and so this is kind of what we're we're looking at with that the parking lot and driveway project and brother Shane believe it or not when I looked this up on Apple Maps I thought maybe Google would have it right but you know Google doesn't even have our play set in there they don't even have things updated you know I figured Apple probably would you know I really didn't have confidence in Google but that's just a little thing brother Shane and I have but um you know uh at any rate this this here if I can maybe try to uh turn this on here just a moment the the the objective with it with it and what has been bid out we've got a few the brothers have went through and got different bids and they've got bids from black top uh to that of concrete and we looked at that concrete was actually when especially with um the the bid that brother Richie had secured it was actually better than the the black top because with the black top the sealant that we have to do every so often it's very expensive whereas with a concrete um the there is a special uh thing that this gentleman that brother Richie got the bid through and it's actually an Amish gentleman with an Amish crew uh but they do all of your development so they're able to buy the concrete in such bulk but they're the ones who lay the roadways and everything else and so I certainly don't I certainly believe that the Bible that the Bible tells us the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord and how that sometimes our path ways will cross because when brother Richie got this bid um you know we looked at it and honest to goodness uh even he had different ones look at the bid and say there's no way that guy can do it for that and the guy told him said not only will I I'm doing it for I think it's what's 465 $465 a square yard but he says I'm do I'll do it 5 Ines thick he said and I'll put reinforced bar he said and I'm going to he said I'm going to knock things off because you're a church but they're a whole Amish crew so there was an respect Within in that so we appreciate that um but this is the this what I'm going to give you the figures in a minute and what it is it's the parking lot doing the parking lot up to this telephone pole and then we got to kind of restructure this a little bit but then it's both um driveways is't that something that that's actually on the map called Joy [Laughter] a so right in right in here a lot of this extra parking we've you know looked at that we we need this also really kinds that uh needs to really be tidied up and build up too and there's some things that even as we' go on in the future we know there needs to even be some more overflow because when we have guests beyond our regular Services um it's it becomes very very rough and I don't want to have to have somebody pulled out and we've had that in the past where we've had individuals stuck in places so um this is this is uh kind of where that that's where that's at it's the con the parking lot and then the driveways and so this is the total don't don't anybody fall over but for the parking lot this is the total for the parking lot the driveways and then the total cost of the of of just that now the only thing that total cost does not reflect is when we would have to do striping and those some of those things are things we can do a little bit later we do have we would have to do a little bit of work on this driveway right here and the decision whether to break that up and build up on that or to remove that in order to have those driveways in uh the one thing when we met the other night and and talked about it is that it's going to be advantageous for us at first to begin to look at uh doing if the first thing would be parking lot because if we did driveways first the second stage being parking lot when those concrete trucks back over those driveways they're super heavy and so it would just we would be in a mess so the first thing would if if if it is in a manner that we break it up in phases we would the first thing we would want to then tackle is the parking lot and I I just told the brothers I as we were meeting and we were just talking and conferring among these things I said you know we uh we have until uh brother Richie said we could uh with that gentleman he had extended it all through the year he said look I'll I'll hold it for you guys for the and you know the year you just got to let me know and I'll call I'll call send a crew over there and I can have everything done in two days um so you know we've just put it like this the brothers as we were talking I said we're just going to put a fleece before the Lord and then in September we'll meet and then you know based on the decision and where everything has come from uh within the congregation and we'll know God will give us a direction on which way to go uh now I know sometimes that looks a little that that looks a startling but I I want to remind you when some of you don't are not aware of this but when we first come to this building and we started to in the process of getting a loan we only had $30,000 in the building fund and as soon as this building was presented in one month's time it doubled that we were smaller than we are now and you know when you look at it when you look at these things there is nothing impossible with God we believe that friends I'm not talking about being ignorant but I'm talking about at times that there's things that we have to just we step back and look at this and this is something that it is a need I think probably the sisters would probably be pushing for this more than anybody else but um you know uh I think with within it all we've definitely seen that's been something that's kind of been out there as as as a need and we just I want to um just en en encourage you with that that you know there's nothing that's impossible with God this out here this this project that was done out here with it was remember it was in two stages that entire project I I think it probably was roughly maybe close to 30,000 for that project everything that was done right out here that I showed you in the beginning so and that was with some of that was with uh some of the brothers themselves doing the labor like brother Richie doing that out there so this is just a plan of action I I'm not here to tax you or to burden you and we're not I'm not here to say this is exactly what we're going to do and we're going to go we we can't go through anything if there's not a commitment and so that's where we're that's where we're looking at one of the things that even in my own life I don't like debt I don't like debt I'd rather do without than have debt I don't like debt um and I don't we don't want that for the the the the church I like things to be free and clear are you with me I like things to be free and clear I don't like things I don't like things on our mind or that would weigh us down and what we're able to do financially so this is a a plan of action we're going to do it'll be weekly a special offering when the when the tithes and offerings are taken up just right on the envelope special offering if you're giving in that week and I'm not going to do a separate offering we'll do it during that time and we'll keep all of those things um separate like we did with that before and then uh when the brothers are giving the presentations and things like that like next week brother Shane will be giving kind of an update on what goes on uh in on the monthly basis and then through quarterly so you're aware of that and um just that's how we started it'll be just just like you have the regular TI and offering envelope and you can just write special offering on there and um you know and we all we will see that all of that goes towards the project um there's things that we do have in our savings and the brothers are uh we're looking at all those things but remember savings itself you know I'm sure I I would assume everybody in your savings to me is not is not viable income it's things you look at that's for a rainy day when you have situ ations like and I'm thankful to the Lord that a lot of things in the building I I hope this is all right so you understand this that I'm thankful that within the here for the building that we there's a lot of things that's taken care of right now that by God's grace that we we're not having to worry about when it comes to furnaces and AC's and all that all those things have just been replaced a few a few years back and and that's that's really moving forward so sometimes we do have unexpected costs that come up and um you know we always want to be ready for that too but um and then if you have any questions regarding this you can you know see uh See the trustees uh brother Shane brother Aaron Brother Richie and if there's something that's beyond that but I I would prefer if you just uh just um touch base with them first and um and then we'll just kind of and then move from there the last thing I want to just cover here and that is the the real backing behind it it's a it's uh because we you don't just want to say yeah we want a parking lot yeah we want driveways the F the thing that we that that has to be here is a financial commitment I I this is not my favorite thing to talk about I don't like talking about money but we have to talk about it and there are things that uh with a commitment to things that this is generally what our average monthly expenses are this is without anything extra coming in this as far as without any extra thing happening such as uh air conditioner we had to have service or you have to have gravel or something brought in this is just basic the average monthly expenses and that's that that I've taken some things and averaged it out and so within that part of it um one of the things we want to be able to do and I'd like to encourage you to do because it will actually it helps us not only now but would help as a body in the future and that is to really when you're giving in offerings and tithes and I I appreciate um the the commitment and the faithfulness that that has been uh because things that we would not be able to do things that have been done without that um so I want to say that you know God bless you for that but I would like to also to encourage you that when it comes to uh even the offering part of it you know because the church itself the church doesn't run on tithing that's Ministry and that's everything when I'm bringing Ministry in and everything that that's going on but a church all of these average expenses that runs off the offerings that's what that runs off everything that's that's that's done that all of that runs off of that electric and all those things and we appreciate it don't we and I I know one thing I appreciate I appreciate the lights I appreciate having electricity appreciate having water all those things are important and so I just ask you to really to really to take it upon your heart and to pray about when even you're giving in your offerings and um one of the things that I'll share with you that from the very beginning in my walk with the Lord um where I set myself and then us as a family is that for me just as much as with the tithes I don't budge on my offerings so in other words I don't make bills with offering in mind I don't make you say brother Samuel how can that be I I'm not only a witness but I can call other probably other Witnesses throughout the congregation you can't outdo God I'm not preaching a Prosperity Gospel I don't believe in that I'm just saying that you cannot out give God God said ties and offerings in Malachi and he said prove me and I God is faithful to his word how many knows that to be the truth God's faithful yeah there's temptations that come our way but I I'll tell you you watch how God comes on the scene because remember this building this building is not brother Samuel's building this building is our building this is our church God has given us this building and this property that we have and I'm so thankful for it I'm grateful that we've got a place that we don't have to ask CU we had to do that could we have special meetings now could we have service now could we do it on a Friday night I'm so glad that we don't have to do that I'm grateful that God's G you know what I'm thankful God's given us a place that even where we can have some fellowship around those fire pits out there aren't you glad for that I'm so thankful that God has done that for us and i' so I encourage you one of the things that the brothers had mentioned um and had brought to my attention they said look if if we just had to wear that even if in our offerings that every individual just even increasing by at least $10 or or more man the the the extra then that gets put back into savings and the extra that goes into things so that when we come into projects it's further build up so I I just want to encourage you in that manner man you are you all with me [Laughter] it's a shame I've got to preach after this oh my maybe we'll just sing the song give and God will give you more you know like brother Joe Green when they in the camp meeting they would sing that and I'll tell you in those North Carolina camp meeting missionary and I mean back then in those days you would have the the missionaries would come in with needs and I I remember it as just a young boy I would look at those figures and I thought my goodness man that that that amount of money brother Joy you were there some of the years too and you remember how that it would come in by the end of the meeting all those needs would be met thousands upon thousands of dollars needs would be met you know why cuz God is faithful God is faithful and let's just let's just pray about it you be in prayer about it and then I believe God as we just open our hearts and just continuing to move forward God will give us the direction if it's all at once if it's in phases however that God provides because he's Jehovah Gyra and that's where we're just going to look to him and trust him so amen God bless you if you'd like to stand with me now and uh I'd like you if you turn with me to Isaiah chapter 6 for I think I have the right yes I do pardon me there some things got changed on me in the back so um I want to just uh let's go ahead and begin with uh verse one if we could could we just pray before we we we begin and just really commit our our hearts to the Lord I want you just as we bow our heads if you you have a need just invite him to come by where you're at Heavenly Father Lord we are are thankful Lord for these moments that you've given us Lord we know that Lord just as we were looking there on Thursday night Lord and we see God that through every situation that we face that you are the everpresent God sometimes Lord that we were not aware Lord by any of our uh senses Lord of of the Earth or our emotions Lord but you're still there father Lord just as you said when two or three are gathered together in my name there will I be in their midst always also you also Lord spoke and said Lo I'm with you always you said in your word Lord that oh God that is you would be with us even in us to the end of the age and Lord you're you're the one to come and confirm your word in your presence Among Us Lord that our faith Lord might be stirred and raised to receive and accept God what it is that you have already done and appropriated for us now Lord we desire this morning that you would just give us the grace in these few moments Lord to step aside there's no Lord greater desire that we have then that you would come Among Us Lord and grace us with your presence Lord minister to our hearts and our lives oh God by your spirit I pray that Lord that you would God just guide and direct me Lord as your servant Lord I commit myself Lord into your hands in this congregation that God that every single need would be met Lord each heart and life Lord be spoken to God by your voice Lord that when it's all said and done Lord that we are aware that we have been in the presence of God and Lord Our Lives Lord just God being changed Lord in your presence drawn Lord to further Lord surrender and give of ourselves Lord to you may you just bless this congregation Lord I pray watch over us Lord throughout Lord the remaining parts of even the coming days Lord we give you the glory in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen let's read here in Isaiah chapter 6 and verse one in the year that King Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple above it stood the sarapin each one had six wings with Twain he covered his face and with Twain he covered his feet and with Twain he did fly and one Cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the Lord of host the whole earth is full of his glory and the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke glory to God then said I woe is me for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips and dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of host then flew one of the sarapin unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongs from off the Altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said Lo this hath touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin is purged praise the Lord also I heard the L the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and who will go for us then said I here am I send me amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I'd like to just take a little simple thought here this morning on becoming a witness and uh this was certainly not what I had planned to or thought that I was going to speak on here this morning but we're just going to move with him here this morning you know when you the background in this particular setting and we look at it that here you have um Uzziah was a great king one that was used greatly by God there were many victories that were uh won within his first few years of reigning because he put God first in in everything and it was such an it had such an impact upon Isaiah's life you know Isaiah could could look at Uzziah and my he just he marveled at at at you know what he was seeing God do through uzziah's life but you know then it came to a place to where that Uzziah got lifted up and you know any time that a person begins to become and feel um comfortable in their walk with God and I I don't I want you to understand we're not talking about uh being in a sent of unrest the gospel comes to bring rest and stability it's not a false rest remember that it says in this day that when destruction is at hand in the book of Thessalonians it says they will say peace peace and destruction is Swift in The Book of Jeremiah it would say that there was even temporary he heing because the false prophets were saying peace this is not going to happen there's not going to be a carrying away and um you know all of that was to appease the spirit and and the mind of man but it it had nothing for the soul because you see the real peace and the real rest is that that comes to your soul to where that you know the god of the Bible and you have met him in a person way and your life has become settled and there's a rest in your life that no matter the circumstances tests or trials there is a piece that passes all understanding it's a piece that comes that when you yourself don't even know how is it and where is this of such a peace in the midst of this of even to where that you can have an Outlook that looks beyond beyond what you're seeing and but yet you realize there's a source it's a hidden Source remember Faith finds a source that no other sense can find when the woman of sarapa when she came to the Lord Jesus and she said thou son of David and she's she's looking to him Lord Heal or thou son of David heal my daughter she had no claims on him as son of David and even when he said that you know this is not even for you uh your your dogs Gentiles but she said true Lord but we the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from the master's table Faith itself her her own person had a lot of hindrances she could have taken you know the route of that well you spoke against my culture you've spoke against my ethnicity you've uh you've offended me uh this is racist this is she could have taken that because those Spirits were there you say how do you know it because even when Jesus came to The Well of Samaria there wasn't it was something that was there even between the Jews and the Samaritans Satan's always in the business of stirring up stink and dividing because remember this is where this is where he works his strength is to bring division but you see it takes the love of God to bring a real true unity and there's a peace that within the midst of it that this this little lady she said thou son of David you know just to to come and to to touch and to you can make my my uh my daughter well but when she called him Lord that was different she had claims on him as Lord son of David was for the Jews but now here she is the approach is provided you know you've got to have the right approach it's like if you were going in to see the king or you're going in let's say even in this day and age these are simple things but these are things sometimes that's left out you don't go into the bank for the loan with a t-shirt on and flipflops you go in there you're ready you're in there to do business you you look like you're going in for something is that right there's approach there's approach when you come in before a king you just don't walk into a king or or some if you went over to one of the uh uh you know the Patriarchs or matriarchs or of the monarchy in England you just don't walk up to him and say hey buddy how are you doing Charles how you doing buddy you don't walk in like that there's rightful approach and that's the same way it is with God there's an approach to God and and we can't circumvent that approach there's no way there's no shortcut it's it's a clear direct way to the throne of God there's an approach and that approach is through the shed blood of the Lamb he has made a New and Living Way for you and I there's an approach we could not approach God but God came down and became one of us and he made a way through the shedding of the blood that you and I could come to him that the spirit that was within the blood could call you and I to repentance and that same blood that life sanctifying us and bringing us into that place with God in a union he has provided the way of approach he is that way of approach so there's a peace that that an individual can have even when you're going through storms of life it's a peace that is within you know people will spend many many much money and everything to try to find some source of peace and try to find you know some way to get their minds off of it but I'm going to tell you at the end of the day when it comes down to there's no other peace that you will find on this Earth outside of the Lord Jesus Christ it's not an Earthly peace it's not a it's not a a something that is of the just census it's a pieace because that is a characteristic of who he is he is the Prince of Peace that's we can try to find it we can try to you know settle it here and try to settle it there so there's no other place because he is the Prince of Peace he is the word there's no other place of settl and satisfaction outside of the word amen joining a church will never do it it'll never satisfy it because God's God's intention is that that peace we would receive as he said come unto me all your heavy laden and I will give you rest for your souls in other words you will no longer be under a laboring and a striving and and and here you are laboring under a load of sin and laboring under these Desires in your life but come unto me that that's the that's the request he didn't ask you and I make yourself good enough make yourself good enough but he said come unto me and I will give you rest it's the same rest that he spoke of in Isaiah that would take place it took place on the day of Pentecost it gave them a rest from their worldly ways from the world you know Peter never ever had to worry about going back out and acting the way that he used to act because you know why that old life that old man was cut off there was a rest that had come to him that rest that settl that you know that you've met God in a personal way listen friends I'm talking deeper than just knowing doctrines I'm talking deeper than just knowing scriptures I'm talking something more than just knowing quotes all of those things have their place and they're important but if you have all of that and you don't know him and you don't meet Jesus Christ you've missed what it's all about [Applause] and like Isaiah when he come down and Uzziah raises to a place a man got so comfortable till he he stopped worrying about and concerned about his walk with God his walk with God started to just little by little it just started to no I don't know what come into his house I don't know what come into his heart a lot of things could have come in because maybe his prayer life that's where it started letting down CU you know your prayer life is your radar screen Jesus said pray always right praying Paul said that in Ephesians 6 we're to pray always that's part of our Armament it's like a radar screen that you can see of what's coming on because prayer itself is also what directs you in the promises of God when God begins to speak to your heart those are things that all of a sudden out of this service that'll resonate in your heart that maybe nobody else got that point or it was expressed to them like it was to you but it becomes a promise to you that you begin to pray about that's why the prophet said you can always tell how the church is heading and the direction by how they're praying because that's part of the radar screen God drops things on you and I that we would pray because that's the law of the scripture seek and you shall find is that right knock and it shall be open unto you so we find these these principles that are that are here but yet Uzziah had become so comfortable he had let down and no wonder where the prophet of God would tell us like this he said we should always when a man recognizes and I'll say man woman any believer you recognize you have influence there's an influence of God upon your life and through your life we must be ever so careful God let me stay in that place to where there can be the influence of God through my life not my influence that's our that's our battle we don't want we don't want one another's Spirit we don't want one another's ideas right we don't want one another's ideas or this is what the message is and this is what it is and and it begins to swing back and forth like a pendulum and it's B this way now now we're over this way now we're on this we don't want that we we we we come to a place that the word is to bring stability to our lives not to where we're chasing ing after this and chasing after that is to recognize who is in our midst who it is that's speaking to you and I and that God surrender our all to him that's what this message come to do is to introduce us to Jesus Christ This is why one of the closing statements in the message leadership this song that the prophet sings God be with you till we meet again hallelujah hallelujah that's a reality of where it brings and you and I are presented with now I want to say it like this this is where when Uzziah he come to a place and when we're looking at this here that you know he he got to that place what a disappointment this was to Isaiah you know sometimes in becoming a witness and remaining a faithful witness you know when the Bible says in the Book of Revelations chapter 1 he is the faithful witness is that right amen and you know what even as be be being a witness sometimes let me just say like this you might look at the title this morning becoming a witness and think well I already am a witness I have met all of these qualities I have met everything that God has laid out for me to do well the word will allow you and I to examine that but I want to remind you that even when it comes to things in our life that you and I are not in control of as far as when offenses come when things come our way and Satan's objective if he can is to take things and move in your life to where all the channels become so bogged down with stones that's right do you remember the wells that Abraham dug in the Book of Genesis Abraham dug these Wells but the Philistines stopped them up they threw rocks down them a lot of things can accumulate in our life over time one rock well it doesn't matter two rocks three very soon over time and we can't get no water out of it you remember he's the vine we're the branches think this is where that in becoming a witness we never ever leave the foundation of of who we are what God has called us to and Lord I do not want to depart from being a source that others could draw through as well as being a channel that God could use me a channel maybe it isn't for you to speak it isn't for you to lay on hands but it's for somebody to look at your life and say that's a real Christian cuz let me tell you your testimony speaks louder than your words Uzziah had a testimony but he got lifted up he got lifted up with pride right he failed to remember it was God who led you in those battles it was God who overcome it's God who brought you this far he got lift up then he got so lifted up to a place with pride to where he could not even be corrected he came in with the priest to offer incense that was not his position right if God listen God has within it your position my position our calling we can't take somebody else's calling but we're if we're faithful in what God has called you and I to do amen let me tell you the greatest I think I quoted this to you before it's come from you know uh Teddy Roosevelt or whoever you know you look it up and they say a multitude of people said it but anyhow it's still true when you go to compare yourself to somebody else that's the greatest thief of Joy we're never to compare ourselves with one another we compare ourselves with the word amen I'll just tell you right now I'm grateful that I that God did not call me to the ministry of brother ROM right I'm grateful for that but s you wouldn't want it no when I look at the responsibility when I look at how that he himself God ordained him and gifted him to look in that other realm I'm I'm not interested in that when I say I'm not interested in it because God hasn't called me to that the prophet himself did not even want that to where he would come home from a meeting and he would be locked in the bathroom for days battling them Spirits right because the spirits had lost in the in those meetings lost Victory after Victory but how many wanted they thirsted after that all they saw was what was up here people's got a sign here and a sign here oh it's all up here and they sought after it went after it but to realize this ministry that God sent in this last day this was not just a gift this was not a gift of PR prophecy right that was the spirit of God in the form of the son of manise the Lord are you with me because the prophet tells us clearly bringing that distinction he says prophecy is to be judged before it's ever received is that right he also said if something spoke out in the church it's to be wrote down and be judged whether or not it comes to pass come on that's scriptural here now yeah that's right it's holding right to the word of God but he said nobody stands before a prophet cuz a prophet has that with the word of God is that right but here Uzziah had come to a place where he just got he got loose with it he got loose even with his walk what a disappointment it was to Isaiah right he could not you know Uzziah could not be corrected he was taking somebody else's place and and you know moving on beyond that and I could deal with that for a time but that's not what I'm after I I just feel pressed in my heart here this morning that I was Isaiah he was a one that no doubt he was wounded he had there had been a failure that where what he had had such he had placed his stock so high in a man and now he's seen a failure but you see listen you can place this is why the prophet said you can get your stock in man to such a place and God will will allow that man to make a mistake to shake your confidence back to where it needs to be come on Friends everyone is flesh and blood James said Elijah was a man subject unto lack passion such as we are even when they came to Paul and that great miracle was done they raised him up oh the gods have come down against us what did the word do it did the same thing that it did in the Book of Revelations it said stand on your feet do not worship me but worship God only Hallelujah any true Ministry any true man of God any true servant of God any true son and daughter of God will never take praise unto themselves but it's always to Jesus Christ Isaiah's got a he's got a dilemma Isaiah can either sit and stew and be mad at Uzziah and say how in the world could he have let me down that's good how could he have done that that's good he's got a choice let me tell you something friends we've all had people that has let us down and we've let others down maybe we don't know about it but it's all you know why because we're all Flesh and Blood that's not a compromise that's not putting weakness out there but I'm just saying that we need the grace of God you know what you cannot give forgiveness to somebody else in Grace only according to the depth that you know and you've received if you've received that much that's all you can extend to somebody else but when you know him in the power of redemption and forgiveness of his grace then you can extend that unpardonable that that which is not even merited you're able to extend it because there's a Greater Grace on the inside of your life in your heart yes sir Hallelujah so good is that right the Bible said that he has put our our sin oh You' so far removed him as the East is from the West he put him in the sea of forgetfulness now I realize you and I we do not have that ability to have a part within us that we can forget things but by the grace of God there is a healing bomb in Gilead that comes to minister to offenses and give Grace to where there no longer is a sting in our life any longer we might see a person but we see that God's Grace has allowed you and I to have a release in our life that we might be a real witness cuz you're going to be a witness for something you have people come up to you on the job sometimes they're Witnesses of their bitterness towards the boss yeah that's right or they Witnesses of their bitterness between about their husband or their wife or their disappointments in their family and they're Witnesses of that but we are called to be Witnesses of the good news and in order to carry the good news our feet must be shot with the preparation of the Gospel in other words we're no longer standing just in Earthly means or in Earthly birth but we have been raised to Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and that's our standing with almighty God we've got a message to carry that no matter how great your circumstance is no matter how tied up you are no matter what the offense is God's grace is greater yes sir Hallelujah Oh by we want to give that inside man that's who we want to give a chance to then inside man that's that's a place that we we battle with not so much that we battle with the inside man but it's recognizing that in each situation like we were living looking at in one way on Thursday night we can look with our eyes hear with our ears we can feel things we can imagine things and we can get caught in those Realms we can get caught there because those Realms have not yet been redeemed that's why we're waiting on the adoption of the body that's right but once that Soul has been redeemed this is where the scripture said bless the Lord all my soul and forget not all his benefits I'm who the Lord that forgiveth all thine iniquities Health all thine diseases he crowneth thyy life with loving kindness who renth your strength as an eagle Hallelujah I'm talking about not forgetting God's benefits Upon Our Life to where when here we can be in a place where we're all hinged in like Isaiah Isaiah had been disappointed right Isaiah had a choice has it all been wrong is everything wrong that's good do I go back to what God I know God brought me out of certain things in my life do I just say this is all wrong and go back to living that way all of these are going on within you Isaiah it's going on let me tell you Uzziah was a representation of the church down Through the Ages and when God would visit and send his word there would be a people that would rise up a messenger would hear what the spirit said to the church and would that would be released upon that generation and there were lives that were in tune with that word that was to be expressed what was that word the same Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and they would rise to that word but but as that age would go on and even that which God would move where a move of God would go in to a place and to a church to a life even as what was started with there in Luther's Ministry and Wesley's Ministry but after they had passed off the scene just like what happened after the day of Pentecost the very first entry in that Ephesian age in the Book of Revelation is says remember from whence Thou Art Fallen they had already drifted away from Pentecost now let me remind you Pentecost is not shouting jumping dancing and running I believe in all that but that's not what Pentecost is Pentecost is God Pentecost is the sounding of the Jubilee trumpet where you're in inheritance is coming back to you and you are being called back to your land to live as a son and daughter of God and when you hear it you might dance a little bit when you get back to it you might shout a little bit because that's just something that might come out of how you're made up but the importance of what Pentecost is is a real experience with Jesus Christ where it's God tabernacling inside of your life living his own life through you that's what Pentecost is when I saying that word I'm not talking about isusa street that isusa the return of the baptism of the Holy Spirit but remember that only made way for the person of Jesus Christ himself that's according to the word that's right right this is the advancement of the Gospel this is where we're not a people that's rallying around gifts but we are people people that have been rallied around the Vindicated word in this hour and signs and wonders follow them that believe and when God needs to speak through a gift he's got them Lord that's right you know the gifts brother BR said they've been planned to place on the mantle sometimes that quote's been misused right and let me tell you it's been misused when God said he when when the prophet said he been placed on the mantle he talks about their imposition not in storage that's good that's good are you hearing me now sir let's say what a prophet said and the way he said it let's quote the whole quote like I told one brother I said anybody knows a southern boy when you hang up a gun on a wall that gun ain't a something that's just hanging there like the gun over Cracker Barrel they'll take that gun off the wall they'll shoot a psome they'll shoot a raccoon they'll even shoot a deer it's not there for show that's just where they put it they can grab it when they need it Hallelujah and that's the way the Holy Spirit has put the gifts in position in this hour so that it's not a bunch of confusion when my wife and I received our gifts guess what they're not sitting around in boxes we're not tripping over saucepans we're not stumbling over stock pots what happened to them you put them where they belong and there's times when she's cooking some potatoes up or maybe she's cooking up you know some dumplings honey you hear that some dumplings and when she's cooking them up she'll get out of stock pot and she gets the stock pot not a saucer we need a stock pot and she'll get a saucer out when it's time to make gravy she'll get something else out when it's time to make mashed potatoes let me tell you we are under the leadership of the Holy Spirit the gifts are not in stage they have been put in their place and positioned by the word delivered through Mal 4 and God inspires and pulls them out as needed they're not a show they're in use Lord but this Inside Man Inside Man Isaiah see God allowed Isaiah to get to this spot he allowed it God permitted things you know God permits things in your life and the whole thing that God's permitting he all listen Satan's objective is to always take you even in situations and divert your attention from what God's trying to show you they came to the Red Sea all they could do is he is Pharaoh's horses and oh no you brought us out here to kill us oh you did all this and right see Satan was diverting their attention right to the negative right but here God did something in their midst that was for them to build their faith right they didn't not all of them caught that but you see if you can we can recognize it Satan is always trying to divert our attention from what's the most important thing look when the Lord Jesus came many were caught with the Miracles that's they followed him and Jesus what did he tell him you've not followed me because of the word you come because of fishes and Loaves it was all about the Miracles you know what the Miracles were it was all about them chasing after a miracle chasing after a sign chasing after a Wonder a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after such Brother Sam you're saying we not to believe in signs and wonders we sure we believe in signs and wond but never does it say in the word that we seek for signs and wonders they follow amen is that right they follow it's according to needs is that right you and I do not prescribe when it's needed God knows when it's needed that's why we want to be a real effectual witness because God might have you tomorrow regardless of your feelings your toast might be burned tomorrow your coffee is not right and God has called you to pray for somebody else who's in need that's good and you have to lay aside your feelings and the discomforts of the morning and stand there as a son daughter of God to know wait a minute this situation has been presented I'm not here by chance but I'm here to represent the Living God don't let your feelings determine your yielding yield based on who the word has made you amen that's perfect Faith mastering every circumstance we're looking at the ways we're looking at the mountains the greatest circumstances that are to be mastered is our own thinking our own feeling our own abilities and perfect Faith looks beyond that and says God that did it for me the God that I know is God steal for this situation but he always wants to divert Isaiah had a choice Isaiah you can either roll in that hurt let me tell you something hurt's a real thing friends yes it is I've been in meetings sometimes and things I was not even aware of and I get into a meeting and I get there a little bit later and I realize Something's Happened in a certain location and I think oh Lord I wish I didn't even know about that hadn't heard about it because immediately when you hear those things I think about young people and then you got young people that are in that meeting and you know you don't try to reach out what can I do you just you're praying because God's got all that are together there a lot of ministry a lot of but you're burden because sometimes Satan will take a wound and let me tell you if you don't get a wound cleared out it'll canker a wound is a deadly thing let me tell you something you can go to a doctor and you can have a wound out here I've got a I've got a scar right here of where that I cut myself with a Swiss knife trying to do something dumb you know trying to work trying to cut out some cardboard things this was back years ago back when I was 19 and that that I don't know what you call that ATT tendon or ligament or whatever was popping up through there and the guys looked at me and said Browning you need to go to the emergency I it be all right bandaid be all right buddy it'd be all right you know never had stitches in my life but I got a scar there that scar has always remind me of what happened right I don't ever play around with knives like that again but you know if I to let that go and my old my other buddies with football wouldn't have said hey you know you're going man you might Mis practice tonight but you're going threw me in the van and we went and I'm I'm in shock if I don't let that go and and even after they stitched it up you know they put that stuff on there you know the stuff they go in there first of all they start cleaning the wound right that's right right you got to clean it first you can't just start stitching it you got to get in case all the thing anything that could CA that's foreign to that area that could cause an infection man that hurt you know when you go when you have to start a cleansing to take place it hurts dying to self hurts admitting you're wrong I'm wrong well that hurts Come On It Ain't Easy the flesh does not like that but they're cleaning it out then they stitched it up then I had to go back and I had to keep it you know I W in the plastic bag for I don't know days couple days I couldn't get it wet or nothing like that and and then you know then then here they would I had to keep it clean then they would wrap it up and bandage it so I could play I could play ball and it would have to be so protected and so forth but you know when I look at that now there's a scar there but you know what that scar is a sign of that I've been healed there you go that's what it is you see your scars are not something that that is still speaks of wound when there's still a wound that's there it can caner it can affect listen friends no matter what it is you might have had somebody that lets you down you might have had something that come your way but don't let that stay as a wound let it come to the great physician who's able to administer the ointment the bomb that's needed to take that hurt out of your life cuz if I hadn't done that this right here would never have been right and it might eventually led to where that moving on up into the bloodstream wounds are serious and need to be cleaned out you know my dad had a wound it was on under his by his ankle you know one of the ways that they ministered healing to that they dressed it and all that other stuff out of the when he was in a nursing home you know eventually what they did they eventually brought what they called the treatment on that wound in order to regenerate cells they took pieces of a placenta after birth had come that placenta then would go and they would they would you know maintain that because that that placenta has within it properties to regenerate growth I want to to say this to you you see sometimes as I was saying in becoming a witness we can always with things in our life we've got to come back to the simpleness the place where Jesus said except you be uh humbled and become as a child you'll never see the kingdom of God we should never the Bible said be children in Malice but be men in understanding we want to allow God to administer healing in our life no I don't need that I'm a grown boy now I'm a grown girl no I don't need that I didn't name it claim it we need it the prophet himself when he came back off the field in June of 1963 he said I'm going to stay here and maybe preach a few meetings but I need healing in my spirit I've lost something he was wounded that was after the seals were open What a Mighty Ministry but he showed us how does cleansing come Hallelujah you first have to acknowledge it I'm wounded Isaiah what do you say I'm wounded who fault is it Isaiah what you eyes you're still not acknowledging it yet there you go yeah you'll stay there Isaiah that's right but but but but but but but God I didn't do that Uzziah did that but it was your confidence your confidence was in the wrong place right right you know what he's trying to get Isaiah to do he's not trying to shame Isaiah he's what he's wanting to do is make a witness out of Isaiah and the only way you can be a real true Witness is when it all comes home and the responsibility if I've looked at something wrong if I've held somebody in a certain degree if I've looked at this way if this hurt and say Lord forgive me for putting them in a place that you never put them in because never will God lead you to put a man in a place that would be equal to Jesus Christ oh I got to get to this man I got to sit around this man I need to drink coffee with this man oh if I'm around this man maybe this man will see no no God does not share his glory with no man the Bible said no flesh can glory in his presence let me give you a quote 1964 identified Jesus Christ the prophet said not even the Flesh of Jesus could glory in the presence of God for he said it is not I that do these works but my father that dwelleth in me I in myself can do nothing but what the father showeth me those things I do so our flesh cannot Glory he might work through our flesh and he does but it's him we want that inside man to have a chance not the outside we don't want the outside we don't want to look cu the outside will choose Things based on what it sees and what it feels outside we'll look at things and man look at this like brother Ram will talk about he said sometimes he said that outside man he said you know he said you'll have that he said where he said he I was listening to a broadcast the other day he said you had a a young people on there and he said they were talking about oh the most important thing is that he would have blue eyes and that he that she would have brown eyes or that they would do this and do that and that ain't even the most important thing now I want to tell you something when brother I'm he that on the radio it's like I told a young man that was standing in my yard the other day and I witnessed to him there for for quite a quite a long time and I said you know even with these things even among young people I don't blame the young people I don't blame the young people we got to go back to what what's the cause of this because everybody wants to try to fix something when I taught school they wanted to try to give us educational programs that would try to control sit situations that's right that's right give them a green card give them a yellow card give them a red card give him a this and give him a that and give them a this and give them a that for their behavior I don't blame the young people but I look back and I said we got to go deeper how did this get to where it's at that's where things become uncomfortable there you go come on yes sir he's got to go back till he comes back to parent delinquency is that right we want to focus on problem we need to regulate this regulate that but then when we trace it back then from parent delinquency it comes back to Pulpit delinquency men not standing with the word of God where the word of God is not being preached in its power and authority that'll separate a life from sin and bring God present in a daddy's life in a mama's life to where that home comes under the influence and effect of the Holy Ghost where it's God not just in the church but it's God in the home it's God in the husband it's God in the wife it's God in Daddy it's God in mom and they see god with skin on it amen that's what this gospel is all about it came with power and demonstration I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ it's the power of God into salvation am sometimes they'll look for a building in a certain way the prophet said they'll look for one it look so beautiful and everything I'm not against Beauty I'm not against all those things but sometimes God might be leading them watch how brother says this here he says but yet God might be leading them to some little Mission that's I tell you how how blessed you are in your heart if you can say God is leading me amen amen hallelujah when you're not choosing based on your emotions and your feelings right come on if brother Rand had his choice he wouldn't he would he already told us where he would have been he said I'd be out there in bamp come on even when he got hurt wounded a complex he was using that wound in that complex of I'll just go on up here in the mountain then I'll just go on up there when God gives me a word I'll stor him on down something he always wanted to do and when something came along the way that wounded or affected him he went oh but aren't you but look God didn't make the decision for the prophet God let him know it's your choice your choice see God lets Sons and Daughters of God make choices we can preach a whole series on this sometimes the choices we make as a son and daughter of God we if we make the wrong decision we will have to reap the consequences of it but it don't change your sunship or that's you're a daughter of God is that right I tell you I've been outside of the will I I want to being in his perfect will I don't care Lord if even if it's not what I want I want your will more than I want my wants that's what I want more than anything Lord is what you want God didn't make the choice for him he had to make that choice God said but I'll tell you if you go this way your wife's going to leave you this is going to happen this going to happen but your choice your choice right now what if brother brandham had kept that wound kept that woman you know let me tell you something you know how powerful it is as a wife and as husband vice versa as a spouse one to another this is where we come to help one another you know if Ahab had had a real wife she could have told him stop acting like a little boy right stop pouting and stand up and be a leader M come on you know I'm preaching now see he he couldn't get something that he wanted he wanted naboth's Vineyard right he wanted an inheritance that only could be to naboth and his people remember the inheritance could not pass from One Tribe to another and he wanted something that he couldn't have but you know why he was pouting cuz he did that as a little boy that's right that's why he never got healed whatever that was in his life that was there daddy mommy remember his daddy omry and all them no doubt they let him get away with that they catered to him when all that took place that was something in his life that followed through in his marriage right but he married a woman that took advantage of it too she showed him she was strong she said I'll tell you what I'll do I know how to get it for you she knew how to cut and make all the deceptive moves and everything else in order to try to get it but remember the Bible said the the wages of sin is death a woman that liveth in pleasure is dead while she lives that's good she made all of these cuts and Corner let me tell you something the church World itself will make cuts and Corners in order to have members but let me tell you the Bible says if any man makes Cuts or Corners taketh or adth away from this book his part will be taken away from The Book of Life Hallelujah that's the TR but she made these amends in order to try to secure that Vineyard what happened death right right death God fed her to the dogs that's right is that right Ahab died in his charot it it matters what's on the inside in our leading Hallelujah let me just let me bring this here to a point see ah look at look at Isaiah here when he came before the presence of God and Isaiah 6 here he is he comes into the temple and he's come to the temple many times but this time it's different prise God I guarantee you Isaiah never expected to take place in the temple what happened he was discouraged he was wounded yes sir he needed healing but God had allowed all of this to come into place to bring Isaiah in position right because as long as he was leaning upon Uzziah he could never be an effectual witness now let me say this God's not called you or me to be on an island on our own that's right the scripture said we are members of one body amen just as your finger you know the other parts they have their place but we must be in position and in the body and what God has us to be when Isaiah came to that place the Bible says he saw the presence of the Lord the train filled the temple he saw the same thing that John saw on the aisle of patmas same thing that Ezekiel Saw Isaiah saw and when Isaiah hear the post of the temple were moved at the presence of the Lord is't isn't it incredible how God can come down and he could move the post the pillars of the temple this is these were not decorative things these were supports isn't an incredible how that God himself could take a bush and bring it on fire and yet not consume the bush right right the bush is on fire but yet it doesn't burn isn't it incredible how that God can fill a man with the Holy Ghost the fire of God and yet it doesn't consume the man it consumes his nature Hallelujah it changes the man it changes you I we are a new creation in Christ Jesus yes sir the outside man somebody can say hey how you doing so and so and they remember you from what you were years ago but you have met the fire of God and on the inside that fire is is burning this out here you might recognize by the facial features but there's something happened inside here that makes this different here was Isaiah the post was moved and he realizes when he comes in God's presence wo is me I'm undone you see the very first thing that has to happen and I want you just to lock in here just these just a couple minutes the first thing is there has to be a confession that's good that's that's first see God's giving the order of approach his presence remember the Bible said the goodness of God leadth us to repentance the goodness is him he said as a physician he has come not to call the righteous but the sick into repentance the goodness of the Lord is the same goodness Moses saw it leads us leads us not just say hey you go do this leads us when you when you move in Repentance it's him leading you and you follow as a lamb woe is me for I'm undone confession and once all the confession once the repentance and once all of that is is laid out then the scripture says I'm a man of unclean lips now comes a sarapin in verse 6 having a live coal in his hands which he taken from the tongues from off the altar now I want to remind you the same order that God gave Moses in the Tabernacle in the wilderness was the same order that was for Solomon's Temple and that was man never started the fire on the altar right right is that right remember God consumed two men they were priests they had connections in the lineage but they came in there and they offered Strange Fire right right sons of Aaron and God consumed them because it wasn't Holy Fire right right God's the one who started the fire and that fire from the altar would be the same fire that would move to light the seven golden candlesticks one age would be it would be a passing from one age to another that same fire it shows that there is no breaking in the continuity of the fire of God this is why it says in the Book of Romans though some did not believe does it hinder God no God's going to fulfill his word God will find vessels that are ready to be lit by the fire of almighty God and that fire that came through Calvary that fire passed in to the upper room that same fire a sarapin he took a living coal and it touched his lips it cleansed him you say why did it touch his lips CU you got to be able to speak right out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh as a man thinketh in his heart so is he it shows what did it come to do it come not to just orientate out here that we would say the right things but it come to where as it's te touching there that down here on the inside man's heart would be changed you understand God will never rip sin out of your life without confession you've got to confess your sin that's right even if things if you've allowed things to accumulate in your life there's only one way to return back to the joy of the Lord you've got to confess you're wrong Lord I'm I'm I'm undone and say Lord I need I need Lord a refreshing Lord in my spirit listen friends we just don't need to come and to feel good but we need to say Lord is there something that's wrong within my life there's a check up here I'm not saying that there is but if there's things that's unconfessed and it's not right and we make excuses for it we've got to confess it in order for God to move amen and let me just tell you we can allow things can accumulate things can come so easily but this is why the grace of God comes down to speak to our hearts sometimes it isn't I've been looking at this or I've done this or I fall this sometimes I didn't even that sometimes we've just become so gripped with negative things to we're out of our mouth everything is negative and all this and all that listen listen because you're rounded by negativity this birth this first birth is a negative birth but I want to remind you if this is the negative the positive there's a positive you can't get a negative unless there's a positive that positive is there on the other side a picture comes out as a negative but it's taken of a positive hallelujah amen praise God is that's why Peter said we have a body reserved in the heavens Paul said in verse 15 in First Corinthians 15 if this Earthly house Tabernacle be dissolved we have one in the heavens waiting not made with hands live coal and that confession and here comes a cleansing in his life there's no cleansing agent like the fire fire cleanses let me tell you something friends it cleanses so deep it goes into where there's wounds one time on my foot this may not be pretty but it'll work don't worry I'm going to take my shoes off I was running Sprints one day you heard the story I was running Sprints one day day been running on i' been playing been practice the whole day all of a sudden I started hobbling in the middle of Sprints at the end of Pat practice down in Marietta I said Coach man I got to sit down I got a rock in my shoe I ripped that thing off we made our run down there turn it off and then quickly tied it back up and got back in line and got ready to run man I I made a couple steps oh oh something's going on got inside the trainers looked at it and they looked and they said you got a planner warant plannner warant wow planners w i mean I've been practicing on it how long all day and that thing didn't come up overnight so that white- haired doctor you know what he did he told me he said he said I tell you what he said Browning you meet me tomorrow morning he said in our Clinic down here because they taught Sports Medicine okay he said we're we we'll take care of that okay little did I know here he gets a soldering iron out this wasn't back in the days of horse and buggy either this man I mean he gets that thing heated up like what you would solder wires together with that's that's what it is man he had that thing and I'm telling you what it was smoking come but you know what he got rid of it got rid of it it it hurt a little bit for the for the next for the day to walk around the next day but you know what eventually I was clear I'm saying to you this right here there's nothing that'll cleanse your life like the fire of God Amen yes without the fire of God and listen friends in order for that coal to really come Isaiah could have just enjoyed that presence and he would have walked out of there with the same that's right same feelings complaints same habits same life you see what makes the difference I thought it's just being in the presence of the Lord it's recognizing like Isaiah whoa I'm undone I'm a man of unclean lips there's Lord I I need straightening out then cleansing comes once cleansing comes then commissioning follows right and God says who will go for me and he had a confidence to say here am I right send me what brought the confidence confession had opened up it had exposed the enemy cleansing came and removed all the infection it took care of all the desires then the commissioning the infilling of God's presence Hallelujah made him a witness right and I tell you this morning no matter where you set friends you are ordained to be a witness and what you want to make sure of in your life every one of us is that you are a true effective witness we want to be the right kind of a witness we don't want to be a witness for this world we don't want to be a witness for our jobs we don't want we want to be a witness of Jesus Christ we want to be like they talked about them Billboards and remember that little boy came and got that that bartender out of the bar and he said hey come out here he said you're signs down that bartender walked out there he looked up and said what are you talking about my signs still on the building no no he said I'm talking about your best sign best sign that man right there he's full of what you're selling on the inside he's your best advertisement the best advertisement of the Gospel of Jesus Christ the best advertisement for the message of the is to be filled with the Holy Ghost to have a confession in your life Lord I don't want to go out and keep struggling with the same things in my life I said under your presence and why how sweet your presence is but it's a time when God's dealing with you on things that's a time to release it that's a time to confess it because when you confess it then the sarapin will go he get puts them in action and they take the life cold and they go right and they'll touch your lips it'll go down to whatever in your heart maybe it's things you've been saying things you've been looking at things you've been entertaining it'll go deeper to where it's not just something you say here I forgive you but it's something down here where real forgiveness resides is in your heartall and then he can commission you as a witness I think what an opportunity right here this morning amen listen I believe this is for us this morning I told him when I came out I said I've got two thoughts in front of me that's the reason I didn't send the notes CU I don't know which one I'm going to speak and this right here certain things just came together within the last 10 minutes or so before I came out God's mindful friends I said God's mindful amen we want to be sensitive to his leadership oh yeah it's things we've studied and looked at but as far as within it no but God there was something else we're looking at but God has so zeroed in on it right now you want to get somewhere with God it begins first of all with confession amen repent all right you say brother Samuel I've repented now listen if you really repent this is what the prophet said if you've repented and been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you haven't received the Holy Ghost then you make God a liar because he said this is his words he cares do you 1963 he because God said in his word repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost I'm not talking about speaking in tongues that's not the evidence the evidence is when he has come to Spirit of Truth John 16 John 14 John 15 when he is come he will lead and guide you into all truth is that right sometime in your walk you might speak with tongue but one thing for sure the Bible says in Romans 8:11 if that Spirit then raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you it will also Quicken your mortal body John 14:12 said the works that I do shall you do also it'll be the same life inside of you Messiahs living out Hallelujah in your life thank you Lord I say here this morning what about it what's holding you back what's keeping you back what is fear that's comes from the enemy he only wants to hold you back it's a scarecrow I say cast that aside if you can cast that aside there's some good butter beans behind there there's a good there's a good Holy Ghost back behind there there's a good living God behind there there's a good living reality behind there oh you've tried it so many other times I'd say put that aside don't let that scarecrow stand in your way say God I'm here this morning I see the approach it's confession cleansing and then commissioning amen I'm ready to go let's bow our heads now friends I'm telling you I didn't come out here to preach and preach a sermon I'm not here to preach a sermon I'm not here to see how things can be so tied together and how beautiful it can be made there's one thing we we're Desiring is that Jesus Christ is presented before us that our lives are touched and affected and influenced by him now I'll tell you when it's all said and done and his presence has come here in this building to Grace us this morning and the post of this Temple not of this building not of this building the Temple that God is leading you to is your heart because the scripture said know you not you are a temple of the Holy Ghost just like God wanted to lead Isaiah into that place God's wanting to lead you into that place see he had to bring Isaiah in contact with that Temple that was built in that time that was a place where they could come and meet God God would come and meet with them but you see what God does there now God wanted to go inside live through Isaiah's life disappointments hurts wounds yes but here's what happened he let all of that go in the presence of God there was something that was so much more valuable than any hurt any wound any sin anything of this world he found that pearl of great price and he was willing to turn loose of everything else I'm asking you this morning this altar is open I know the altar is in your hearts in your mind but I'm not pulling on anybody but I want you to know it's open but I want to say this to you if you're in a place in your life and first of all you might look and say I'm tired of being an up and down life now pardon me for a minute I'm going to ask you a question are you really tired of it or are you at a place to say Lord I really am I realize I I need I appreciate the presence of the Lord but I I there's things I in my life it's not tallying up when I leave out of here my life is still the same let me just say this to you because we want to expose the enemy right that's not God's fault but his word comes to lead us to show us the right way that we don't have to leave out of here the same way and God would come by his word and help you and I to see it's not just about feeling the presence of the Lord that's important we this presence should be here he said where two or three are gathered together in my name I'll be there also but it's what we do in his presence if all we do is at the end when we come out of it we come out with the same things in our life maybe there's been things that's been built up in your life maybe God has done a full work in your life you can say hey the things of the world has all passed away out of my life my my heart's desire is just for the Lord you've walked through of repentance you've been baptized in the name of Jesus right and you have been born again but maybe there's things that you have allowed to accumulate in your life maybe it's frustration with another brother another sister maybe it's with spouse maybe it's with family maybe it's hurt that's come your way maybe you've placed some upon a pedestal and realized I should never have done that I need to look to God because it's the same God for that individual for that life that I have to I have to have from my own life that same Grace remember what judgment you meet out will be met back to you so you want to make sure you're not meeting out judgment you want to be releas in Grace but here the morning I just I just want to invite you in this moment a place in his presence that you can say I Lord I I don't want to continue in the same pathway coming to a service and then I leave out the same way same old things the Lord Brother Samuel what is it it's a it's got to be a confession friends don't make an excuse for anything be a be a con let it be a confession a real repentance a real cleaning of your heart when you can do that before God as he would lead you and really that that's a way that approach and then will come forth a cleansing he'll bring the cleansing in your life then it'll be followed by commissioning I tell you the altar is open this morning the prince of God is here to minister to our needs I say this to you if you feel like you've got cold in your walk with God maybe you've got like Isaiah or Uzziah was got complacent maybe not really really caring just kind of letting down on your prayer life and walk with God and Things become optional things just be kind of just your life starts to become whole hum and there's certain things you start beginning to allow in your life that at one time you wouldn't have allowed this is not you being as far as mind over matter but it's recognizing the Bible tells us our walk is a walk of Holiness separated unto God I tell you the prince of God God he's here he's here to take desires out of your life if you'll stand with the word and call wrong what God calls wrong I tell you what his presence will come it'll change your wardrobe cuz it'll change your desire on the inside it'll change your life it'll change your nature his presence will come and give you a fresh strength a fresh touch if you've gotten weary in your walk but let's look at it friends let's consider it here this morning becoming a witness I know a very simple thought very simple message but there's a reason God would do it like this hallelujah how many say Lord I that's what I want to be I want to be a real witness I want to be a real witness Hallelujah I tell you the greatest thing we could do right now is to have a moment of consecration a real moment of consecration many times brother Brandon would lead in Services before healing Services later on the next night would take place it would all begin with consecration wanting to see God move in certain ways see God do things it begins with consecration I wonder this morning we wouldn't be willing to act upon that word Lord a fresh consecration a fresh a fresh confession oh brother Samuel repentance is so I I did that years ago repentance should be something that's daily in your life because we fail daily Paul said I Die daily our sins are taken daily before they alter oh God help us don't ever let us get a get beyond that to where we recognize our need from him I know you understand what I'm saying but it's God giving us a real approach in our walk with him now I say this not in a matter to rebuke you but I say it in a way like this that if you're content with where you are I'm not trying to move anybody but I believe I believe you've come here because there's a desire you want to get closer to God you just didn't come to church today to wonder what brother Samuel's going to say to today I wonder what wonder what's going to be said I wonder what songs I I don't believe you came here for that you come here because there's needs in your life I've got needs in my life we've come to have a meeting with God I'm going to pray for you we're going to pray together Heavenly Father Lord God you are so mindful Lord of every need in our lives and our hearts Lord You're mindful lord of the needs Among Us Lord now Lord throughout this building Lord there's nothing Lord that you do by chance or coincidence we're Believers we know footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord now father I pray that God that right here as we have been gathered together in your presence Lord like Isaiah here we are gathered in the presence of the Lord it's not so much to come into this building right here although it is a place you've given us to come and gather but father when we come together it's come Lord in the name of Jesus Christ it's to meet in that provided place of worship that place that gate like you said in the book of Deuteronomy where you would choose to place your name and we know you placed your name there in Christ and Christ is the word that's who you are and Lord God we have here in the place of meeting this morning Lord God no doubt your word Lord as it has touched our hearts and moved Upon Our Lives to call us away from getting our attention on man or any of man's ways but Lord that our attention might be rightfully placed on you when Isaiah Lord come to that that moment this is when he could look as long as he was leaning upon Uzziah he never had this experience but once Uzziah had went his way church had passed off the scene then you called Isaiah right in the midst of that Temple and he said woe is me for I'm a man of unclean lips I'm undone Lord you came on the scene and you met Isaiah in a special way but Lord he never would have come to a place of hearing the word who will go for me you never started with that you never started with that at all but you showed the right approach it's cleansing first or that's why you would send a message in this hour there would not be a message that Lord would be in a continuance of man's ideas but there had to come a cleansing a cleansing a separation oh God where the revelation of Jesus Christ would break forth in its freshness fullness in its power and original Glory oh Lord God where would be revealed when men were tossed about and wondering Lord is it is it of Jewish blood is it how is is it part of that but Lord God how that in this hour you would restore as the scriptures Lord had said it was not the blood Jewish blood but it was the blood as Peter would write of Christ God's Own creative blood cell because Lord there's no all throughout the Earth it was polluted blood but it would only be through and by Lord you creating a blood cell creating a body a temple for yourself to come and dwell in Lord oh Hallelujah Lord God where the blood of bulls and goats how precious it was in the sense that it would allow man to come and still have fellowship with you to the degree of what they could have in that hour until the fullness of time would come but Lord when that time arrived then came forth a blood that was strong enough to take care of every situation Lord to take care of sin to take care of unbelief and Lord God that you would send back your spirit upon your church that you might continue your work through the lives of your redeemed subjects now Lord you have no hands upon this Earth but our hands no feet but our feet you are the vine the Life Source we're the branches now Lord I pray that God throughout this building that Lord you would just Lord God as we would move Lord into a place of consecration Lord God if there's things Lord that has accumulated things Lord that has begin to take place precedence in our life not sometimes Lord how things happen so subtly Lord and you know that but you come Lord to show us how could we know unless you would show us Lord sometimes Lord just one Little Rock going in the well it don't seem like much and then another rock and then another rock and then another rock and pretty soon Lord we're not able to get the same water out of there that we used to get I pray Lord May Lord here this morning there come Lord a fresh renewing and refilling Lord God In Hearts and lives as lives Lord our lives are opened up in a fresh consecration to you Lord a fresh repentance a fresh confession Lord I need you I need you more Lord than I need my food Lord the bread on my table I need you more Lord I need you Lord I need your leadership Lord more than anything Lord oh God when things Lord are set in order then Lord we can expect things to move and to happen Lord according to your working Lord God I pray granted Lord if there's one Lord that hasn't come to that place yet Lord maybe they enjoy your presence I'm glad they do I'm glad they do lord it's a wonderful thing but Lord Jesus I'm also reminded and we must be very careful Lord how the rain itself will fall on the just and unjust we just don't want to be thankful for the rain we want to move with what the rain is drawing us to Leading us us Lord to a place to be a real witness confession cleansing then a commissioning Lord granted I pray Lord this Lord broke up little part Lord but I'm asking you Lord God Have Your Way father Lord I commit the service I commit every life commit every heart Lord into your hand Lord may you move Lord I pray God according to your will Lord in each of Our Lives In The Name of Jesus Christ amen amen you know the scripture says in the Book of Genesis God came in the time of Noah and finally God had come to a place and he says my spirit will not always strive with man you know you live in a time and you remember when you look at things and situations that happen it's always a moment Lord I want to take every moment I want to be found ready God doesn't come to upset you or to upheave you that's not how God works but God comes to draw Upon Our Lives friends we want to be ready we want to be ready we want to move when the spirit of God just like as God was dealing with Israel remember Israel came to a spot when God was dealing with them and God there was even evidence brought back from the land that it was a good land and the 10 spies they chose to look beyond that evidence you know what that evidence was it was that God keeps his word what God Said but they chose to look at all of what they called Giants and there weren't Giants they looked at all their problems they looked at all this they looked at all the ups and downs but God had an Evidence and let me tell you the evidence the evidence that this is a good land is the Holy Ghost it's a presence of God that is greater than every excuse that's greater than every shortcoming it's greater than all your failures it's greater than all your mistakes take your eyes off of you and off of all the other Giants and look at the evidence it's greater the evidence says God is with us the evidence says God keeps his word amen you know if they would have received the evidence in the right way they would have had a worship service instead of a funeral service they would have had a worship service in the camp that night say brother Samuel is that is that scriptural sure the disciples went up to the upper room the Bible says full of joy rejoicing cuz they knew the promise was sure when God makes something known to you it's sure act on it act on it act on it you love him amen let's be obedient to God let's be obedient to the Lord let the spirit of God let him move don't I know it might be like even with time and things but listen friends let me tell you something what's eternity compared to a few moments really what's eternity compared to a few moments I'm not saying that the whole I'm saying that from the reality of is that what is eternity for just a few moments to be sure where our life is at with God you love him am amen if you'd like to stand go ahead opening and was me opening for you you you been hiding I open the door look out it is me it said to you will you want to come out to stay in I'm sh you I'll give you my hand it it it is I I will guide you I will you know the scriptures might be new here the scriptures tells us when they were going to battle it's in the New Testament in the old they didn't know how to approach the battle but then it said one of them of the Levites one that was within that part begin to of the singers stood up and they begin to prophesy now remember God can call out very specific is that right the prophet tells us with things this was wrong in your life go make this right and this right you took from somebody in a garbage truck and this and that but also when God speaks the prophet also tells us that individual will know whom God has speaking to in their life is that right sometimes we hear it where it'll begin with tongues right then it'll come into interpretation and that interpretation is prophecy but within it all where it comes down to is that God himself he's in our midst and he's speaking he has already spoken we want to act upon the word of God that's the greatest compliment that we can do is to act upon the word of God amen hallelujah amen here the Lord of harvest sweetly call who will go and work for for me [Music] today who will bring to me the lost and Dy who will
