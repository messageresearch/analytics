[39:56] Bibles to first John chapter 2 computer
[40:02] is down back there so
[40:05] we just wouldn't ask you just to turn
[40:08] Bibles first John chapter 2 I want to
[40:13] also to make mention the post went out
[40:17] on Facebook there last night we were not
[40:19] able to get an email out but perhaps
[40:23] every one of you have when you pulled in
[40:25] this morning you saw the playground so
[40:28] just in case you didn't know for
[40:30] grown-ups
[40:31] the playgrounds not for you even if your
[40:35] height would allow you to be on it but
[40:41] we I want to say first of all I want to
[40:45] thank brother Richie getting all that
[40:47] together I was quite shocked when I come
[40:54] out of the woods early one morning and
[40:56] come out and after why I went early when
[40:58] I came out of the woods but it was later
[41:01] on in that morning and I looked over
[41:02] there and they were actually putting it
[41:04] all together and brother Richie asked me
[41:07] to make known to you that it is
[41:10] available for the children to be able to
[41:13] play on it today so children and that
[41:17] includes Zachary don't don't be you know
[41:24] if I say just give me a few more moments
[41:25] don't be you know say come on I got to
[41:27] get out on that playground but it is
[41:31] available for you to be out there I
[41:33] think for let me finish this as as the
[41:38] kids when you're when you're going out
[41:40] there there's a little walkway that's
[41:42] over here that'll take you out there
[41:45] because it is a muddy mess all around
[41:47] there too to walk you don't want to get
[41:51] off of that little pathway that goes up
[41:53] to it because it's a mess that that mud
[41:55] you'll you'll sink right down in it all
[41:57] the way around it if you get on there to
[41:58] play stay right in the mulch area and
[42:00] then there's two walkways that come off
[42:03] of there so you just want to stay on
[42:06] those walkways so all the all the
[42:08] kiddies all the kids say a man
[42:15] okay I got one a man get another Amen
[42:19] they got a smiles over here what's will
[42:22] take the smiles but we think it's one of
[42:27] the things that I know that brother
[42:29] Richie is really carried that burden for
[42:31] some time and I thought back you know
[42:33] one of the one of the things that
[42:35] brother Richie had mentioned is so that
[42:36] where the kids would get kind of a focus
[42:39] of probably where they're gonna be so
[42:41] we're not running behind the building
[42:43] and so that we're not running up and
[42:45] down in the parking lot between cars and
[42:49] things like that as well so we just want
[42:52] to make that known to you we're very
[42:54] thankful for that I'm really really
[42:56] thankful for that I think that'll be a
[42:58] great blessing so let's just go on into
[43:04] the word now everybody happy in the Lord
[43:07] Hey well first John chapter 2 verse 1 my
[43:13] little children these things write I
[43:17] unto you that you sin not
[43:21] and if any man sin we have an advocate
[43:25] with the father Jesus Christ the
[43:30] righteous and he is the propitiation for
[43:35] our sins and not for ours only but also
[43:40] for the sins of the whole world amen
[43:48] so we just want to ask the Lord to bless
[43:50] the word you may have your seats and god
[43:54] bless you as you're being seated and so
[43:57] good to have each and every one of you
[44:00] you're with us
[44:04] see some visitors there sister Chris oh
[44:06] god bless you and some other visitors
[44:09] god bless you as well welcome we want I
[44:12] want to look at this a little bit more
[44:14] here this morning on the advocate of the
[44:18] believer I don't have time to go back
[44:21] and and pull up in review but some
[44:24] things will undoubtedly the Holy Spirit
[44:26] will just tie together things that he
[44:29] was ministering to our hearts even last
[44:33] Sunday but to take into account this
[44:36] word of advocate that John would write
[44:40] here where he would say that would write
[44:46] unto us that you sin not and if any man
[44:48] sin we have an advocate with the father
[44:51] Jesus Christ the righteous this word
[44:54] advocate it's the same it's the same
[44:57] exact word that is used when the Lord
[45:01] Jesus would would express that he was
[45:04] going away and he said if I if I go away
[45:08] and he says I I will not leave you
[45:10] comfortless he said but I will I will
[45:14] send the comforter unto you and that's
[45:18] the same word as comforter one who is
[45:20] who is who who has there to minister to
[45:25] our hearts personally the the pardoning
[45:29] of our sins and when we we recognize
[45:34] within this hour we we when we read the
[45:38] scripture and I trust the Holy Spirit
[45:40] word just through the eyes of man we do
[45:44] not fully gather the victory that God
[45:47] has for us but God provides for us by
[45:51] His grace that we might truly be able to
[45:54] look into his word not through the eyes
[45:57] of a man but through God's own eyes and
[46:01] to be able to see the redemptive work of
[46:04] what God has already done for us we see
[46:08] that in every age when we look in the
[46:11] beginning of revelations chapter one of
[46:14] how that in every
[46:16] that God will send one to every age and
[46:21] that one is anointed with a Spirit of
[46:24] God they come to make known to the
[46:27] Church of the Living God of exactly what
[46:31] Jesus Christ has done personally for
[46:34] them as the believer
[46:36] it's a minister the rights that belonged
[46:39] to us as the believer I I love the
[46:42] scripture you know I many things I just
[46:46] almost can't get around it I you know
[46:48] without wanting to just preach all again
[46:50] the pardoning grace of Almighty God but
[46:53] that that's the thing that you'll see
[46:55] today is the is the real part and you
[46:57] know you think about a man who at one
[47:01] time you know the example of where the
[47:06] individual was they ran in the time of
[47:09] war and here they were as a soldier
[47:11] during that time in the Civil War and
[47:13] here was the friend of the man who had
[47:15] run and remember he was going to be
[47:17] killed he was guilty of what he did that
[47:20] was against the law but there was one
[47:23] who knew his friend was in trouble and
[47:28] he went to President Lincoln and he
[47:31] began to plead for his life he began to
[47:35] plead for his life and we we know how
[47:37] the account would go that President
[47:39] Lincoln would actually take just a
[47:42] simple piece of paper and he would write
[47:45] on that paper that the man is pardoned
[47:48] he would write the man is pardoned and
[47:50] he would sign his signature Abraham
[47:54] Lincoln on that paper now the one who
[47:57] went there would actually take that
[48:00] particular message that had the actual
[48:03] pardon within it and that pardon would
[48:06] come right back to that man who was in
[48:09] that cell he was he was guilty he was
[48:13] going to be shot before a firing squad
[48:16] but yet there was one who was coming
[48:18] with a message from the very one who
[48:21] could pardon him and he came with a
[48:24] message to him that you
[48:27] have been pardoned but remember the the
[48:30] account goals that that the the
[48:33] individual he he rejected and in a
[48:36] manner of saying you're only mocking me
[48:39] he was looking at the guilt of which he
[48:42] was ensnared in and and all of this but
[48:46] to understand what he failed to realize
[48:49] is that there was one that was there in
[48:52] his cell that had been in the presence
[48:55] of one who could pardon him and he
[48:59] brought with him you see it would be one
[49:02] thing if he was just coming with a word
[49:04] but he came with a message that was
[49:07] directly from the president when that
[49:11] man could not get there there was one
[49:13] who brought that message personally to
[49:15] him and then we know that the account
[49:17] the man end up dying before a firing
[49:20] squad because he refused to accept the
[49:24] pardon that was issued to him and when
[49:26] they tried it in the court of law they
[49:29] the the Supreme Court made the
[49:31] declaration that a pardon is not a
[49:34] pardon unless it is received and
[49:38] accepted as a party and I want to say
[49:41] this very clearly this morning that the
[49:43] reality of the pardoning power of the
[49:47] Lord Jesus Christ that comes to you and
[49:49] I personally as a believer does not
[49:52] leave a son and daughter of God in
[49:56] bondage or the defilement of sin because
[50:01] the pardoning power we're talking about
[50:03] is the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ
[50:06] it's not human blood Paul would call it
[50:10] the blood of Christ the blood of the
[50:12] Lord the blood of God all the way
[50:14] through the Scriptures because there was
[50:16] no blood that was here present that
[50:20] could take care of the sin question to
[50:23] pay the debt and then release that life
[50:26] back into the worshiper when that comes
[50:29] when that pardoning grace is is is
[50:32] received by the worshiper
[50:35] and the blood has been applied then it
[50:38] is no longer there the life of that
[50:41] believer or the life that previous life
[50:44] that's on display but now they are
[50:46] safely under the blood of the Lord Jesus
[50:49] Christ and it is no longer the person
[50:53] who was but now we are a new creation a
[50:57] new creature in Christ Jesus by the
[51:01] redeeming cleansing pardoning power of
[51:05] the blood of the Lamb you see there was
[51:08] a case that was against us for every
[51:11] person the small it didn't matter if
[51:12] it's church member or whoever they are
[51:15] without of receiving the pardoning gain
[51:18] the grace of God the case is still
[51:20] against us but there had to come what
[51:23] now notice in God himself when we look
[51:27] at the scriptures we as the Holy Spirit
[51:29] just just was moving you know upon our
[51:32] hearts last week and we were looking at
[51:34] these things to understand that it was
[51:36] the very God the very God himself
[51:40] who is the judge he became our attorney
[51:45] and he not only did some attorney he
[51:48] became the jury he became he stood he
[51:53] took his own life and to to see that how
[51:57] there was no way when a man was trying
[51:59] to live according to the law of God
[52:02] Romans 8:1 in May through 8 for man was
[52:05] trying to live according to the law of
[52:07] God but yet but it did not have the
[52:10] power within it to give man the real
[52:14] reality that man could live by the
[52:17] righteousness of God but yet man were
[52:20] trying to live by that but the law
[52:21] remember the law was given in order to
[52:25] point out we were guilty it was given in
[52:28] order to point out you're guilty and
[52:30] there must come one who's able to
[52:33] fulfill that law and the fulfillment of
[52:36] that law is by the life of the righteous
[52:40] one himself when Abraham
[52:42] him on the plains he is he is revealed
[52:45] Paul we picked this up in Hebrews seven
[52:47] I believe he is revealed as Melchizedek
[52:50] he is one who did not have beginning of
[52:53] days nor ending of life he had neither
[52:56] father nor mother and and to think that
[52:59] he is the king of righteousness he is
[53:02] the king of peace not just that he is
[53:05] righteous he is the king of
[53:07] righteousness all true righteousness it
[53:10] comes from the very king of
[53:13] righteousness who is our milk ascetic
[53:15] our high priest the Lord God Almighty
[53:18] who took upon the veil of flesh in the
[53:21] body of Jesus Christ that was made that
[53:25] was there to move on our behalf and
[53:28] stand now as a mediator between us and
[53:32] God hey man we were in need of a
[53:36] mediator and a mediator is one who
[53:39] stands between two parties in order to
[53:42] intervene and to ratify a covenant and
[53:46] God Himself became one of us amen and
[53:51] took he bore he took his our sins upon
[53:54] himself and he paid that sin debt to the
[53:58] worship for the worshiper that then the
[54:00] life coming back the life coming back is
[54:04] a witness as the Holy Spirit deals with
[54:07] the heart it's a witness there is
[54:09] pardoning power in the blood of the Lamb
[54:13] it witnesses to our life there is true
[54:17] Liberty hallelujah you see where the
[54:26] church world falls so short is because
[54:30] they teach it in a manner as though well
[54:33] we've got a perpetuation we've got a
[54:37] sacrifice for sin that is true but there
[54:40] is a life inside of that sacrifice when
[54:45] it comes upon the worshiper it brings
[54:47] you in the blood sale
[54:49] your very nature is changed you no
[54:53] longer desire the things of the world
[54:56] you see it teaches man's idea teaches
[55:02] and brings it brings or it strips from
[55:05] what the rights that belong to us as
[55:08] sons and daughters of God we're in that
[55:11] a life does not live in the victory that
[55:14] it ought to live in but I'm telling you
[55:17] this morning there is victory in the
[55:19] Lord Jesus Christ we have received a
[55:22] message straight from the throne of God
[55:25] and let me tell you something the
[55:26] messenger does not pack the message
[55:29] alone he glory he came with the
[55:32] signature of Abraham Lincoln remember
[55:35] when God manifests his name it is the
[55:38] revealing of his word his presence of
[55:42] companies his messenger are you with me
[55:46] at from Jesus Christ and from the seven
[55:51] spirits better before the throne grace
[55:53] and peace be multiplied unto you Oh
[55:57] glory be to God I tell you friends I
[56:01] just say it very quickly you could not
[56:03] say it very clearly you can people can
[56:05] say whatever they want to say you will
[56:07] not know the pardoning grace of Jesus
[56:09] Christ in this reality had God not sent
[56:12] Malachi 4 you would not see it in the
[56:17] reality would still be under that avail
[56:19] in church ideas but God not the man God
[56:24] has broke the veil he has opened it to
[56:29] you and I that we can walk in and the
[56:32] inside of the veil that is the real
[56:34] revival there's the real revival we're
[56:37] sons and daughters of God are having a
[56:40] revival in the pardoning power of the
[56:43] blood of
[56:45] [Applause]
[56:51] let me just the Advocate is one who
[56:57] pleads who pleads on our behalf he does
[57:02] not a pleading is not one as we said
[57:05] last week who is begging Jesus Christ
[57:09] when he ascended and he took our blood
[57:13] he took his blood to there and he went
[57:15] and sat down on the right hand of the
[57:17] Majesty on high there now a body to
[57:22] occupy the throne he did not go to beg
[57:27] for mercy his life satisfied the
[57:32] requirement that was required so it
[57:35] releases back to us that comfort to know
[57:41] that there is one who is standing for me
[57:45] we know that he's standing for us
[57:48] because he is in us and we are in him
[57:53] now to think of this you know brother
[57:57] Branham would say it like this and I
[57:58] want to just just kind of just take this
[58:00] through that of the of the as he would
[58:04] bring it in in in in the Holy Ghost
[58:06] series here we've been dealing with that
[58:08] part on the on that of the Holy Ghost
[58:11] and to think of how that you know he
[58:14] said like this he says what is the Holy
[58:17] Ghost
[58:17] it's an advocate what what what is an
[58:22] advocator what does it do it makes an
[58:25] advocate it has mercy it stands in your
[58:30] place it does things that you can't do
[58:36] it's a propitiation for your sins
[58:40] it's your righteousness my mama mama no
[58:45] wonder David could say I believe in
[58:47] Psalms three they're like the God of my
[58:50] righteousness
[58:51] I'm not standing on my righteousness
[58:54] it's on his righteousness and that
[58:57] righteousness to be reflected inside of
[59:00] us notice it's your righteousness
[59:03] it's your healing it's your life it's
[59:06] your resurrection it's all that God has
[59:09] for you he's an advocate now remember as
[59:13] we were you know kind of looking at that
[59:15] a little bit last week on the one who is
[59:17] the advocate is one that he is there to
[59:23] stand on our behalf and to make known
[59:27] and to us what our rights are it's one
[59:32] who stands you know as we said last week
[59:34] like sometimes you have a you know a
[59:38] union steward or you have somebody who
[59:41] would represent a student that might
[59:43] have a particular need and there are
[59:46] laws that have rights for that child and
[59:48] so there's one who will set down there
[59:51] in that office they are known as an
[59:54] advocate they are an advocate for that
[59:57] child they are there so that everything
[1:00:00] that is promised in the law that there's
[1:00:03] nobody that overrides that law there's
[1:00:06] nobody that tries to hide anything from
[1:00:08] that child or in that parent of what
[1:00:11] belongs to them but the advocate is
[1:00:13] there to quickly point out you
[1:00:15] overstepped your boundaries here the
[1:00:18] Advocate is also very quickly to point
[1:00:20] out on top mind in terms of school right
[1:00:22] now it's in it's very much there to
[1:00:25] point out even to the parent and to the
[1:00:27] child of what belongs to them now you
[1:00:29] know I've been in those meetings where
[1:00:31] we're a child and the parent and you
[1:00:33] know been through the times where we go
[1:00:35] through the testing and all of those
[1:00:36] things like that I've been sitting there
[1:00:38] where the Advocate comes in and there is
[1:00:41] a packet and packets that are given like
[1:00:43] this I do not believe at least the
[1:00:45] parents that I've worked with I've never
[1:00:47] seen one or ever heard of one that
[1:00:50] actually took those packets and
[1:00:51] memorized those packets they didn't they
[1:00:54] they didn't read it and a lot of it's
[1:00:56] just such you know legal it's such
[1:00:58] sometimes jumbo and they don't maybe
[1:01:00] they wouldn't understand it and you and
[1:01:02] I would be pressed and hard to
[1:01:03] understand some of those writings
[1:01:05] the laws as it is but there is one who
[1:01:08] understands that law and is able to
[1:01:10] break down the writing of what is in
[1:01:12] there and just simply let them know hey
[1:01:15] this is what belongs and it's coming
[1:01:17] right from the law and they give them
[1:01:19] that so that the parent and the child
[1:01:21] they can actually stand on that that if
[1:01:23] somebody would try to infringe upon
[1:01:25] their rights or if there are things that
[1:01:28] they themselves would have need of they
[1:01:31] can actually make that request and say
[1:01:33] hey I was promised that I could have
[1:01:35] extended time on my testing it shows
[1:01:37] because of this this and this it is
[1:01:40] there and there's an advocate that is
[1:01:42] for them how much that's in the temporal
[1:01:44] that's in this life but how much greater
[1:01:47] because in this life an advocate face
[1:01:50] can slip past them an advocate in this
[1:01:53] slide it's not always by your side the
[1:01:55] Union steward well and let me just
[1:01:58] because I may just be good here the
[1:02:00] Union steward but not always by your
[1:02:02] side they don't always know what's going
[1:02:04] on and let's be honest sometimes they
[1:02:07] make deals behind backs with the
[1:02:09] administration well you know I'm trying
[1:02:12] to be good but you know sometimes
[1:02:13] they'll do things like that they are not
[1:02:16] a faithful advocate but let me tell you
[1:02:18] something the Lord Jesus Christ is a
[1:02:21] faithful advocate he don't make deals
[1:02:24] behind your back he has already sealed
[1:02:27] the deal
[1:02:29] and when he releases and seals you into
[1:02:32] the economy of God he is there to
[1:02:35] minister on our behalf and to make sure
[1:02:38] that the devil is not able to infringe
[1:02:41] on our rights and he's there to let you
[1:02:43] know every promise that belongs to you
[1:02:46] as a son and daughter God let me just
[1:02:49] say like there's he's there to encourage
[1:02:51] you to even when you look at it and you
[1:02:53] don't feel worthy he's there by the
[1:02:56] pardoning power to give you strength to
[1:02:59] say I simply accept it I believe Lord
[1:03:03] what you have
[1:03:04] me and he has such a way by his presence
[1:03:11] of just lifting us to a place energizing
[1:03:17] us moving on our hearts to his love
[1:03:21] lifts us oh I'll tell you this that
[1:03:27] quote I just read to you I have I'll
[1:03:29] tell you what I have meditated on that
[1:03:31] for months since God just dropping all
[1:03:35] this down yeah I love it it has some
[1:03:37] mercy its stands in your place it does
[1:03:42] things that you can't do it's all that
[1:03:46] God has for you now in in Romans 8:26
[1:03:51] Paul picks up here in Romans 8:26 I wish
[1:03:57] I could read the whole chapter but we'd
[1:03:58] never get through this Romans 8:1 opens
[1:04:02] up there is therefore now no
[1:04:03] condemnation to those who are in Christ
[1:04:09] Jesus is that right who are not after
[1:04:15] the flesh but they walked after the
[1:04:18] spirit
[1:04:19] how desired there's no condemnation why
[1:04:23] because the blood has been applied but
[1:04:28] case has been dismissed amen when the
[1:04:32] Holy Ghost has come into the life of a
[1:04:36] believer through the news new birth the
[1:04:37] case has been dismissed and you are
[1:04:41] personally aware of that reality and you
[1:04:44] know what a pardon does a pardon
[1:04:46] generates purity
[1:04:50] are you with me it generates purity it's
[1:04:54] like the oil inside the Dove Romans 8:26
[1:05:00] now I think of how Paul you know Paul
[1:05:03] goes through the prayer but there is now
[1:05:06] within our hearts a groaning - - for the
[1:05:10] redemption of the body part of Romans 8
[1:05:13] you know verse 25 it brings us into that
[1:05:16] place - where here we are as the
[1:05:18] children of God we are with a hope a
[1:05:21] hope being an expectation that is
[1:05:24] brought by faith that we are expecting
[1:05:27] to be delivered from this body of
[1:05:30] corruption and then how Paul would drop
[1:05:33] in by the Holy Spirit in verse 26 and
[1:05:36] let us know of Gulbis our infirmities
[1:05:40] for we know not what we should pray for
[1:05:43] as we ought but the Spirit itself maketh
[1:05:48] intercession for us with groanings which
[1:05:51] cannot be uttered I mean this scripture
[1:05:56] we could just go on and on and and
[1:05:58] preach on and on but to recognize that
[1:06:01] for you and I remember when God brought
[1:06:03] Israel into the land I believe it's in
[1:06:05] an industrial of five when he brings
[1:06:08] them into the land God told him he said
[1:06:10] let the ark be such a space ahead of you
[1:06:13] with the priest bearing it and he says
[1:06:16] you are to follow that art because
[1:06:18] you've never passed this way before the
[1:06:21] Bible said we are new we are new
[1:06:24] creatures in Christ Jesus behold all
[1:06:27] things how old things are passed away
[1:06:30] and behold all things are become new and
[1:06:33] taranta see that within that of the life
[1:06:36] it takes the Holy Spirit moving and
[1:06:40] dealing in our life even for you and I
[1:06:42] we would not even know what to pray
[1:06:45] about if it was not for God himself
[1:06:48] letting you and I know this is what I
[1:06:50] want you to pray for you see the Spirit
[1:06:53] of God interceding even as it would
[1:06:56] intercede within us with groanings that
[1:06:58] cannot be uttered now think about this
[1:07:00] with
[1:07:01] in the scripture it isn't just here the
[1:07:03] holy spirit has the scripture lays it
[1:07:05] out
[1:07:06] whereas though that God has just taken
[1:07:08] us and going to pull us through a pipe
[1:07:10] the Bible says that the spirit also
[1:07:13] helpeth our infirmities now I'm not
[1:07:16] going to ask you this morning because
[1:07:17] every one of us would have our hands up
[1:07:20] both hands probably we all have within
[1:07:23] us infirmities and weaknesses we have
[1:07:26] things that were you know inherited and
[1:07:28] whatever and so forth and these things
[1:07:30] that are all down to think even after
[1:07:33] the cleansing power of the blood of the
[1:07:35] Lamb has moved in to actually bring the
[1:07:38] cleansing of the soul to where that the
[1:07:40] Holy Spirit sets down right in the midst
[1:07:43] of our life there is still this body
[1:07:46] that is still under the curse of sin as
[1:07:49] much as we try to take care of it we try
[1:07:52] to you know when we get a headache we
[1:07:53] take an aspirin or whatever we try to do
[1:07:55] we try to do all we can to take care of
[1:07:57] this body but this body is still under
[1:07:59] the curse of sin this body you know that
[1:08:02] way you know here we are we're healed
[1:08:04] one time we'll get sick again there's
[1:08:06] times you know that we go through
[1:08:07] sicknesses and we think my what did what
[1:08:11] was it like to feel well what was it a
[1:08:12] lot enough to have sinus headaches what
[1:08:14] was it like not to have this and then
[1:08:16] here we come through that time and we
[1:08:19] are so thankful to God for His mercy and
[1:08:21] we appreciate health hey listen God's
[1:08:24] desire listen to me now is not that we
[1:08:27] would be in sickness but notice clouds
[1:08:29] word is even in a measure of preventive
[1:08:32] care
[1:08:32] the Bible tells us in third John chapter
[1:08:35] one that God's desire is that we that
[1:08:38] even in our body it would prosper and be
[1:08:41] in health even as our soul does it's
[1:08:44] God's desire that we would be within
[1:08:47] health and you say now why does God
[1:08:49] allow sickness to come all to show you
[1:08:52] and I that he's a healer he wants to
[1:08:55] show you and I his mercy and his
[1:08:57] tenderness God wants to display his
[1:09:00] power through the infirmities and the
[1:09:02] weaknesses that would come around in our
[1:09:05] life to realize that there's witnesses
[1:09:07] that things that you and I would simply
[1:09:09] love to be able to cut
[1:09:11] and be able to say no more I no longer
[1:09:13] have that infirmity about my life and
[1:09:16] there are certain things that God
[1:09:18] actually moves down to do to where it
[1:09:20] actually removes that and to think that
[1:09:23] even so many of the times within our
[1:09:25] human weaknesses the the temperaments
[1:09:28] our human makeup there's things about
[1:09:30] every one of us no doubt you've talked
[1:09:32] to yourself and you've called yourself a
[1:09:35] dummy you've called yourself how in the
[1:09:37] world did you make this mistake how in
[1:09:39] the world did you do this again man if I
[1:09:41] could tie you up to a post come on now
[1:09:43] don't look at me every one of you maybe
[1:09:45] you don't say it out loud but there's
[1:09:47] just those times that there's things
[1:09:49] about you that you wish you could cut
[1:09:52] out and we're no longer bother you but
[1:09:54] remember now the Spirit of God coming to
[1:09:57] help us with our infirmities that's not
[1:10:00] altogether mean that every little
[1:10:02] weakness is cut out on the contrary but
[1:10:06] what it means he causes our eyes to be
[1:10:09] lifted to the one who has already
[1:10:11] overcome all of those things to the one
[1:10:14] that is overcome who has ascended at the
[1:10:17] right hand of God and has sent back the
[1:10:19] Holy Ghost so much that he can tell you
[1:10:22] and I greater is He that is in you than
[1:10:26] he that is in the world it reminds you
[1:10:29] and I that the mighty Conqueror is not
[1:10:32] far off
[1:10:33] he's living inside of you glory be to
[1:10:37] God the same God that rode in in the
[1:10:40] power and the vesture of his word dipped
[1:10:43] in blood and overthrew satan's
[1:10:45] stronghold in your life and is living
[1:10:48] right there in the midst in your life
[1:10:51] yet there's weaknesses all around you
[1:10:53] but as a real child of God can look at
[1:10:56] it and say there might be weaknesses all
[1:10:58] around me but the Lord is my help I am
[1:11:02] trusting in the Lord oh do you want a
[1:11:11] self-help book
[1:11:12] no I need to help her himself
[1:11:14] I don't need self-help I need the helper
[1:11:18] for hallelujah the spirit also helpeth
[1:11:22] our infirmities we know not what we
[1:11:26] should pray for as we ought but the
[1:11:28] Spirit itself maketh intercession for us
[1:11:32] with groanings which cannot be uttered a
[1:11:36] whole glory be to God
[1:11:38] I'll tell you I thank God for his mercy
[1:11:41] that would point things out in our lives
[1:11:44] to those who you know within every one
[1:11:47] of us in human weaknesses and I don't
[1:11:49] want to dwell with this a lot this
[1:11:50] morning but within human weaknesses some
[1:11:53] of us are overreaching we build the
[1:11:56] bridges some of us don't care if there's
[1:11:58] a bridge when we get there or not
[1:12:00] this is sera sera there right and we
[1:12:07] have that and that deals with it's not
[1:12:09] well this one's better than the other no
[1:12:11] it's just as much that a person who over
[1:12:14] reaches and can be in such a manner like
[1:12:16] that can become so vexed sometimes with
[1:12:19] things not being perfect and they become
[1:12:22] so much to where their makeup begins to
[1:12:25] encroach on the actual advocacy of the
[1:12:29] power of God in their life and God will
[1:12:32] have to allow situation to arise to
[1:12:34] where that they realize us that you know
[1:12:37] what I can't deal with this this is not
[1:12:39] me dealing with it all along it's yeah
[1:12:41] it's gonna take the Lord to help me and
[1:12:43] then there's those those of us that
[1:12:45] might look at and say well you know well
[1:12:47] you know whatever it is you know praise
[1:12:49] God we're predestinated we're going to
[1:12:51] make it anyhow and God sometimes has to
[1:12:53] get us kick us in the seat of the pants
[1:12:55] and let us know and say hey look you
[1:12:57] can't or you can't walk this walk in a
[1:12:59] lackadaisical way but you have to reach
[1:13:02] out to Almighty God who ministers to our
[1:13:05] heart that lets us know I'm here to help
[1:13:08] you but I'm not gonna pull you through a
[1:13:12] pipe but I am gonna help you God let him
[1:13:16] know I'm not gonna clear all the
[1:13:18] inhabitants out of the land but I have
[1:13:20] commissioned you wherever every foot
[1:13:24] your foot shall tread I have
[1:13:26] ready giving you that land and God would
[1:13:29] let him know but this is what I want you
[1:13:30] to do do not be in fear do not be afraid
[1:13:33] do not be dismayed but walk with a good
[1:13:36] courage being strong in the Lord
[1:13:39] Oh glory Romans eight twenty seven and
[1:13:43] he that searcheth the hearts knoweth
[1:13:47] what is the mind of the Spirit because
[1:13:50] he maketh intercession for the Saints
[1:13:53] according to the will of God oh my I'm
[1:13:57] glad about that I just happened to
[1:14:00] believe when I come into a meeting I
[1:14:02] believe God's gonna speak to me I
[1:14:04] believe that now I don't I don't try to
[1:14:07] figure out what God's gonna say but I
[1:14:09] just I believe that God's gonna say
[1:14:11] something for me there's something in my
[1:14:14] heart's desire is lord help me to be in
[1:14:17] tune you know because the reality it
[1:14:20] isn't the man you know we don't preach
[1:14:22] what we want to preach there's a lot of
[1:14:24] things that can be studied
[1:14:25] sometimes there stays just like what
[1:14:27] happened me right here there was pages
[1:14:29] but in the things that I'll begin to
[1:14:32] move into and fake my I'm gonna move
[1:14:34] into this this morning and right here as
[1:14:36] I just couldn't even you know get
[1:14:37] settled with it and the Holy Spirit had
[1:14:39] me just removed those thirteen pages and
[1:14:41] say put that over here in a different
[1:14:43] place and I want you to start right here
[1:14:46] but we don't have that do we don't have
[1:14:48] the decision about what we're going to
[1:14:50] preach there are many wonderful things
[1:14:52] within the Word of God that we can
[1:14:54] minister that we all would be rejoicing
[1:14:57] in but God comes to minister personally
[1:15:00] to our needs and the Holy Spirit is
[1:15:03] there to move and to intercede on our
[1:15:06] behalf so in the word itself is coming
[1:15:08] forth I don't know about you but I stand
[1:15:10] in awe every time when I stand here and
[1:15:12] when I'm sitting out there I stand in on
[1:15:15] how the Holy Ghost can take ahold of a
[1:15:17] gift within the word and can begin to go
[1:15:20] right down through that word and
[1:15:21] minister so personally to my need and
[1:15:25] just present such a angle on it then
[1:15:27] maybe I haven't looked at it and then
[1:15:29] many times I know everyone can agree
[1:15:31] with me there are times when the word is
[1:15:33] coming forth we feel so overwhelmed we
[1:15:36] feel like howling the
[1:15:37] girl can I live up to this but God does
[1:15:40] not bring his word to push us down he
[1:15:43] brings his word that you and I might be
[1:15:45] able to see where we're falling short
[1:15:47] and be able to say lord help me Lord
[1:15:50] help me Lord that I can live this out in
[1:15:53] my life what is that that is you and i
[1:15:56] coming in tune with the holy spirit
[1:15:58] here he is living within us brother i
[1:16:01] don't know how to walk this walk but he
[1:16:03] inside of me knows how to lead me and
[1:16:06] guide me until the final moment when i
[1:16:09] stand there in his presence I have a
[1:16:12] faithful guide and you do too
[1:16:17] he maketh intercession for the Saints
[1:16:21] according to the will of God mattel
[1:16:22] powerful this is this said in the
[1:16:25] settings of Scripture here brother
[1:16:28] Graham talks about a man by the name of
[1:16:29] brother egg elphberg and brother
[1:16:32] elphberg was a pilot on a plane and
[1:16:34] brother elphberg
[1:16:36] here he is he he receives an
[1:16:39] announcement that your landing gear will
[1:16:42] not come down you're gonna have to land
[1:16:45] this plane on the grass and that man
[1:16:48] brother Elbert and I'll think of this he
[1:16:50] puts he takes his glasses off for the
[1:16:52] RAM recounts it he takes his glasses off
[1:16:54] and he begins to pray he said Lord bring
[1:16:58] my name before brother Brown bring my
[1:17:03] name before brother Brennan have him
[1:17:06] pray for me Lord brother branham did not
[1:17:08] know what was going on but Bill Graham
[1:17:09] said I was driving in the car he said in
[1:17:12] here come brother Eggbert he said Elbert
[1:17:14] however you say it standing right in
[1:17:16] front of me he said I pulled the car
[1:17:18] over to the side of the road and I begin
[1:17:20] to pray Lord you know what kind of a
[1:17:22] trouble he's in Lord I pray for my
[1:17:24] brother then Lord you will help him in
[1:17:27] this time brother Ram did not know what
[1:17:29] went on here they were in a meeting
[1:17:31] together and brother elphberg is a
[1:17:33] singer and brother Alpert from Sweden
[1:17:35] he's a singer he begins to sing and then
[1:17:37] they meet up and find out that it was
[1:17:39] exactly the very same time when that
[1:17:42] plane should have crashed and here that
[1:17:44] landing gear comes out it was the very
[1:17:47] same time now you're in the
[1:17:49] this kind of stuff this is not things
[1:17:51] that people are just telling
[1:17:52] fly-by-nights like a lot of this stuff
[1:17:54] that goes on nowadays this stuff was
[1:17:56] documented brother Branham actually sent
[1:18:00] a man and said you go find out what time
[1:18:03] it was and go find out everything they
[1:18:05] brought it right back together he was at
[1:18:07] the exact same time Brook man said see
[1:18:09] what it was he said it was the Holy
[1:18:11] Ghost that was interceding for brother
[1:18:15] Egbert let me tell you this right here
[1:18:16] you and I have been brought into that
[1:18:19] that relationship with Jesus Christ has
[1:18:22] sons and daughters of God let me tell
[1:18:24] you when God drops a name on your heart
[1:18:26] don't you just think that's just a
[1:18:28] thought that's fine by but it is God
[1:18:31] that has put that one upon your heart
[1:18:34] we'll listen I don't know what's going
[1:18:35] on you don't need to know what's going
[1:18:37] on all you need to know is call into
[1:18:39] prayer for that son or daughter or that
[1:18:42] family or that Minister whoever it is
[1:18:44] that God puts on your heart you go into
[1:18:47] prayer and you know what you don't need
[1:18:49] to blab it and tell everybody what you
[1:18:51] did just keep it between you and Jesus
[1:18:55] is that right there's sometimes God
[1:18:59] wants us to share things and there's
[1:19:01] other times God tests us and wants to
[1:19:02] know will you tell everything is that
[1:19:06] right so there's times for that be
[1:19:08] intercession brother Samuel you mean he
[1:19:11] God would use his body after all he is
[1:19:14] the vine we are the branches the
[1:19:18] intercession him moving on our behalf
[1:19:23] I'm so glad about that now I'll be
[1:19:27] honest and you can be honest too maybe
[1:19:28] some of y'all may be you know I I'm a
[1:19:30] morning guy but you know sometimes it's
[1:19:32] kind of hard at 2:30 or 3:00 o'clock in
[1:19:35] the morning when the Holy Spirit
[1:19:37] something just wakes me up and I just
[1:19:38] you know I have you know this particular
[1:19:40] name on my heart I'll be honest with you
[1:19:42] my flesh does not feel like praying
[1:19:49] let's hang aren't you looking for the
[1:19:51] pillar fire I'm looking for my pillow
[1:19:55] come on now your flesh is the same way
[1:19:58] but it moves in a place to say lord help
[1:20:02] my brother help my sister
[1:20:05] maybe you maybe you lay down you struck
[1:20:07] through your hand and then you find
[1:20:08] yourself as you're brainless and Friends
[1:20:10] it isn't always about the position of
[1:20:12] our body because you could get right out
[1:20:13] of bed get on your knees and fall asleep
[1:20:16] it ain't about the position of your body
[1:20:18] it's the position of your heart before
[1:20:21] the throne oh ma we'll send you how long
[1:20:25] should I pray pray until there's
[1:20:28] satisfied and we know that all things
[1:20:33] work together for good to them that love
[1:20:36] God to them who are called according to
[1:20:40] his purpose now this good he don't mean
[1:20:44] everything is good but it does mean
[1:20:48] everything becomes useful he teaches us
[1:20:53] in our failures he teaches us he not
[1:21:01] only corrects us but he will instruct us
[1:21:05] and his teaching if we can receive his
[1:21:09] teaching in our lives and submitting to
[1:21:13] that it will actually bring about to
[1:21:15] where our feet there are straight paths
[1:21:17] as the Bible says that are made for our
[1:21:20] feet think about it
[1:21:25] we would look back on men in the
[1:21:28] scriptures men and women alike and we
[1:21:30] would look back on them and where we
[1:21:33] were we hold them and I believe that we
[1:21:35] ought to hold them in all proudly
[1:21:38] respect as our fellow sons and daughters
[1:21:41] of God but to take how you know with
[1:21:45] every one of the you know they were
[1:21:47] tried down through time Daniel himself
[1:21:50] going into the lion's den
[1:21:54] this was not about all the bad King and
[1:21:58] the bad people you don't know what the
[1:22:01] bad King did and the bad people did God
[1:22:05] permitted that there's a lot of things
[1:22:09] that you and I can look at and say well
[1:22:11] this that person and if this person
[1:22:14] hadn't done this and this person had
[1:22:16] said this sometimes we get so focused on
[1:22:18] those things instead of recognizing God
[1:22:23] has permitted for us to be perfected
[1:22:30] this is what brother Ram could say
[1:22:32] Daniel was in the Lions Den and a
[1:22:33] message to Rome he was in there to be
[1:22:36] perfected sometimes we get in our minds
[1:22:40] as though as believers that everything
[1:22:43] ought to be smooth there ought not be
[1:22:46] any suffering everybody that surrounds
[1:22:49] me brother Simon you are you telling me
[1:22:50] then there won't be people around me
[1:22:52] that put me in pressure no I'm not
[1:22:54] telling you about at all
[1:22:55] there'll be people all around through
[1:22:57] there'll be people that will push your
[1:22:58] buttons there'll be people and pressure
[1:23:00] and things that will come your way but
[1:23:02] it all matters on how that you and I
[1:23:05] approach it in the middle of that time
[1:23:07] Oh glory I'm not a very deep but I'm
[1:23:10] gonna preach this he's bringing it many
[1:23:11] times we are praying to get out of
[1:23:13] situations you say brother Samuel my
[1:23:16] flesh just can't take it I agree
[1:23:18] our flesh and our spirit is weak but
[1:23:21] it's not my flesh it's not my spirit
[1:23:23] that's being molded I need my character
[1:23:27] molded and in order for my character to
[1:23:31] be molded
[1:23:32] I don't need cool breezy days I need
[1:23:36] fiery trials my hands are not up for any
[1:23:40] right now you say why because you're
[1:23:46] either in one
[1:23:48] coming out of one or getting ready to go
[1:23:51] in one then this guy I don't like test
[1:23:56] I don't like trials I said this guy this
[1:24:00] guy complains as much as you do right
[1:24:04] but the inside man with his award on the
[1:24:07] inside when we can give him the ride
[1:24:10] away Daniel came at the rest of him no
[1:24:13] matter what the kingdom did Daniel came
[1:24:16] out of there more molded into the image
[1:24:20] of God than what it was before he went
[1:24:22] in there it's the same way with Joseph
[1:24:25] he was molded in that time there's also
[1:24:31] things all things work together for the
[1:24:34] good there's a lot of mistakes we make
[1:24:40] yep there's a lot of wrong decisions we
[1:24:44] make that done we're not making excuses
[1:24:51] we're not making things acceptable but I
[1:24:53] believe as a child of God when we there
[1:24:57] is never a desire within our life to
[1:25:00] make a mistake or to fail in any area if
[1:25:06] there isn't any heart that says well you
[1:25:09] know Jesus just forgives me if I do you
[1:25:12] need to make a trip to Calvary because
[1:25:15] the blood of Jesus Christ is not to be
[1:25:18] trampled on it does not when partners
[1:25:23] come it does not produce loose living
[1:25:28] the love of God is shed abroad in our
[1:25:31] heart by the Holy Ghost and the Bible
[1:25:34] tells us that the love of God constrains
[1:25:36] us and yet there's been times where we
[1:25:44] wish that our tongue would have been
[1:25:46] more constrained
[1:25:51] shouldn't have said this maybe what you
[1:25:53] said was right but your motive and
[1:25:54] objective behind saying it was wrong and
[1:25:57] the Holy Ghost comes and brings
[1:25:59] conviction because of the motive and the
[1:26:02] objective but I'm gladly corrects us as
[1:26:08] many as I love is that the Bible I
[1:26:10] chasing and rebuke glory beats Elias
[1:26:16] therefore and repent and so there's many
[1:26:18] times we have made wrong decisions in
[1:26:21] haste what are you praying about it yeah
[1:26:25] well how do you I feel like well I ain't
[1:26:28] heard nothing about it having not heard
[1:26:30] anything don't mean you got the stamp of
[1:26:32] approval right well you know I've been
[1:26:41] praying that's good that's good what's
[1:26:43] that to keep on praying but it's hang on
[1:26:46] coming don't be anxious say Lord you're
[1:26:50] in the control sometimes three motion
[1:26:57] decisions are made that's why we need
[1:27:02] the Holy Ghost to reign over our
[1:27:05] emotions amen that's why each and every
[1:27:10] day give me give us this day our daily
[1:27:13] bread
[1:27:14] lead us not into temptation but deliver
[1:27:17] us from evil for thine is the kingdom
[1:27:20] and the power and the glory forever amen
[1:27:24] sometimes through reasoning we'll make
[1:27:27] the wrong decision come on somebody we
[1:27:34] reason things out reason out decisions
[1:27:39] you don't mean you're not a child of God
[1:27:42] it means you're gonna get corrected oh
[1:27:45] yeah because his desire notices in verse
[1:27:50] 29 I'm trying to get somewhere for whom
[1:27:53] he did foreknow he also did predestinate
[1:27:55] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:27:58] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:28:00] many
[1:28:01] brethren moreover whom he did
[1:28:04] predestinate then he also called and
[1:28:06] whom he called them he also justified
[1:28:08] and whom he justified them he also
[1:28:10] glorified it is a finished work with him
[1:28:18] yet in our life we don't see ourselves
[1:28:21] as a finished work and it's true we in
[1:28:25] we are a work in progress but he is not
[1:28:29] the author of confusion he knows the end
[1:28:33] from the beginning is that right this is
[1:28:37] why that real discipline this is why
[1:28:42] real true discipline and chastening is
[1:28:46] not random it's not because we got on
[1:28:50] God's nerves but discipline when he
[1:28:54] chastens and rebukes us discipline is
[1:28:58] that he corrects us without admit meant
[1:29:02] our best interest in mind because he
[1:29:06] already knows the future and if we keep
[1:29:09] going this way we'll never make it there
[1:29:13] but he disciplines us with a vision and
[1:29:19] the discipline when as we receive it as
[1:29:23] children it goes with us Oh glory what
[1:29:33] shall we say then to these things if God
[1:29:37] be for us who can be against us he that
[1:29:41] spared not his own son but delivered him
[1:29:44] up for us all how shall he not with him
[1:29:47] also freely give us all things
[1:29:54] glory be to God don't you love the Lord
[1:30:00] this advocate does things for us that we
[1:30:04] cannot do ourselves he freely gives to
[1:30:08] us all things but it does not mean that
[1:30:11] we've got the box of sitting on the
[1:30:12] front porch in order to in order to
[1:30:16] fully possess them he has to fully
[1:30:19] possess us it's us dying to ourselves oh
[1:30:25] yeah listen friends when when you have
[1:30:29] received the Holy Ghost everything you
[1:30:32] have need of is in you right there
[1:30:35] including the rapture but it's us
[1:30:38] pressing outport it and he is calling to
[1:30:41] us
[1:30:42] verse 33 who shall lay anything to the
[1:30:45] charge of God's elect it is God that
[1:30:49] justifies it's God that declares us
[1:30:52] righteous who is he that condemneth it
[1:30:56] is Christ that died yea rather that is
[1:30:59] risen again who is even at the right
[1:31:01] hand of God who also maketh intercession
[1:31:05] for us now what's up Paul has taken this
[1:31:10] from verse 26 brings it to - to verse 34
[1:31:15] and to realize that the Holy Ghost is
[1:31:19] the very Spirit of God it is God is not
[1:31:24] another person it is God the same God
[1:31:28] that was above us with us now in us him
[1:31:34] and so the Holy Ghost listen to me now
[1:31:36] the Holy Ghost dwelling in the body of
[1:31:40] Jesus Christ never was tempted the Bible
[1:31:45] says in James chapter one God cannot be
[1:31:47] tempted but the body was tempted is that
[1:31:54] right
[1:31:54] so God comes down and he takes upon
[1:31:58] flesh and blood that he might be a
[1:32:00] faithful and merciful
[1:32:02] for high priest so here God here within
[1:32:06] the resurrection and then taking the
[1:32:08] body up to the minute Oriole seat
[1:32:10] setting on the throne of God now sending
[1:32:13] back the Holy Ghost
[1:32:14] we have a direct eye to our high priest
[1:32:19] there is not - a born-again believer
[1:32:23] there is not a gap between him and God
[1:32:26] there is no longer a chasm it has been
[1:32:30] done away with because the Holy Ghost
[1:32:32] does away with the breach are you with
[1:32:37] me this is why the important of the
[1:32:39] breach between men of the church ages
[1:32:41] and the seals it does away with the
[1:32:43] chasm it ties us back into the mind of
[1:32:47] God lets us know you are always sons and
[1:32:51] daughters of God and it releases the
[1:32:54] power of the Holy Ghost in our life that
[1:32:57] we recognize that we stand in the very
[1:33:01] righteousness of Almighty God what does
[1:33:04] that produce the love of God produces
[1:33:08] faith faith worketh by love
[1:33:17] hallelujah this is where we're standing
[1:33:20] even these things that were ministering
[1:33:21] were standing in Joshua chapter one when
[1:33:25] God would tell him don't be afraid don't
[1:33:27] be dismayed big was why he's got to have
[1:33:30] a basis for faith and the real basis for
[1:33:34] faith is forgiveness who is he that
[1:33:41] condemneth it is Christ that died rather
[1:33:46] that is risen again who is even at the
[1:33:48] right hand of God who also maketh
[1:33:50] intercession for us hallelujah amen God
[1:33:56] took his understanding back to glory
[1:33:58] with him he understands what it's like
[1:34:03] to be tempted I want to read you this
[1:34:08] here
[1:34:09] all he says mother bream says how we
[1:34:11] could go into details with that about
[1:34:13] the advocate it makes intercession for
[1:34:17] our ignorance sometimes when we got the
[1:34:22] Holy Ghost we ignorantly stagger into
[1:34:26] something the Holy Spirit is there to
[1:34:31] make an advocate for us many of those
[1:34:36] time that whole sitting have done that
[1:34:38] why don't I say that and let's just be
[1:34:42] honest sometimes how it is coming don't
[1:34:45] say that and we go ahead and say it but
[1:34:50] it don't qualify it it just means we're
[1:34:54] going to get corrected and there has to
[1:34:57] be a repentance for it
[1:34:59] is that right we ignorant Lee stagger
[1:35:03] into something the Holy Spirit is there
[1:35:05] to make advocate for us he is our
[1:35:08] advocator he is our attorney he stands
[1:35:12] there and pleads for us we don't plead
[1:35:17] for ourselves because the Holy Spirit in
[1:35:20] us please for us oh I'm glad about that
[1:35:24] the Holy Spirit giving utterance
[1:35:26] sometimes with words you can't
[1:35:29] understand and he makes intercession for
[1:35:32] us that's what the Holy Ghost is when I
[1:35:34] walk into anything I look like a little
[1:35:38] kid you walk like a little fellow we're
[1:35:43] walking in a dark world full of enemies
[1:35:46] full of sin full of traps full of
[1:35:49] everything I'm not attractive I know
[1:35:57] brother Wayne's a traveler Madine here I
[1:35:59] was like I haven't explained it but
[1:36:01] maybe there's some others that have done
[1:36:03] trapping well brother herb did trap them
[1:36:04] before to anything you're going to trap
[1:36:07] you don't put the trap right out in
[1:36:10] plain sight you don't advertise the
[1:36:13] plane the trap you disgust me
[1:36:17] and you don't put a trap in an area that
[1:36:21] trap first of all can only be laid
[1:36:24] whether it's going to be whatever it is
[1:36:26] you're seeking for you've got to know
[1:36:29] they're moving and frequenting that area
[1:36:32] and you've got to be able to put that
[1:36:35] trap down but it cannot have one trace
[1:36:38] of human scent on it it can't many times
[1:36:43] they got a boil them in the water and
[1:36:44] everything else to kill that scent on
[1:36:46] that trap but then there is a lure that
[1:36:50] is put in that trap there's got to be
[1:36:52] something that will lure or that will
[1:36:54] appeal to that animal to get that animal
[1:36:57] to even move over to that trap and there
[1:37:00] as he comes into that trap he's caught
[1:37:02] within that trap but I'm gonna tell you
[1:37:04] here this morning there isn't we have an
[1:37:07] advocate with a father that the devil
[1:37:10] himself he studies every way he studies
[1:37:13] every pathway and every way we go but
[1:37:16] brother he never said there wouldn't be
[1:37:18] traps
[1:37:18] he never said you when you're caught by
[1:37:20] a trap but he also said I'll make a way
[1:37:23] out of that I will come and release that
[1:37:26] trap or that hope that is taken upon
[1:37:29] your life this is what the advocate does
[1:37:34] for us full of enemies foo of everything
[1:37:40] else I walk like a little kid a little
[1:37:44] kid walks into things little kids don't
[1:37:46] even know the danger they're walking
[1:37:47] into we were one of the first times
[1:37:53] they're picking on Zachary now one of
[1:37:54] the first times you know and let him
[1:37:56] pick up the crossbone whatever more you
[1:37:58] know he's wanted to pick up the crossbow
[1:37:59] want to pick up the bows don't realize
[1:38:01] at all man we're dealing with a weapon
[1:38:02] here daddy I want to see your gun I will
[1:38:06] see you 22 I want to see you shotgun no
[1:38:08] no no no no no no no no not right now
[1:38:11] but they look at it don't understand the
[1:38:14] danger that's in it you know how it is
[1:38:16] with our children we got to teach them
[1:38:18] stove is hot it's hot like as though
[1:38:21] that helps
[1:38:23] it's hot but many of them have to find
[1:38:28] out by experience whoo this is Warren
[1:38:31] you know as this sometimes as a parent
[1:38:34] you may get their hand and you bring it
[1:38:35] close to where that fires at as I see
[1:38:37] that's really hot
[1:38:38] that's really warm you're trying to help
[1:38:41] them so that they don't end up with some
[1:38:45] sort of a burn is that right but there
[1:38:48] might be something come along to where
[1:38:50] they're not under hey they're not really
[1:38:52] they're cooking something or they're
[1:38:53] doing something they ought not to be
[1:38:54] doing and they don't have the real
[1:38:56] respect for it that they ought to but
[1:38:58] you're letting experience combine their
[1:39:00] way I'll tell you right quick they'll
[1:39:02] learn how that's hot they'll learn to
[1:39:03] handle it a little bit differently the
[1:39:05] next time say they don't continue on it
[1:39:08] they don't learn we are not children
[1:39:10] that there are just ignorant but God by
[1:39:12] His grace even in the midst of our
[1:39:14] failures he is faithful to intercede for
[1:39:18] us and teach us
[1:39:21] there's not one parent in here that
[1:39:24] would delight in heaven your child fail
[1:39:25] over and over and over but the desire
[1:39:28] that we have is that our children they
[1:39:30] would actually be able to walk and be
[1:39:32] able to benefit from our mistakes and be
[1:39:35] able to climb beyond those things is
[1:39:37] that right we would desire those very
[1:39:39] things think about it if that's how you
[1:39:41] and I feel as a parent how about
[1:39:43] Almighty God God desires to have that
[1:39:46] overcoming power displayed in our life
[1:39:49] he will not leave us in a trap you might
[1:39:52] be in a trap but I'm telling you this
[1:39:54] morning that the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:39:56] has already made a way that that trap is
[1:40:00] strong you don't have to stay there you
[1:40:05] don't have to stay in that condition Oh
[1:40:10] glory be to God look at this brother em
[1:40:14] says you say oh I'm afraid I'm afraid to
[1:40:17] take Christian life I'm afraid to do
[1:40:19] this I'm afraid I'll do this
[1:40:22] I was there I said I was there when God
[1:40:29] first got ahold of my life and dealt
[1:40:32] with my heart you know what you know
[1:40:33] what was holding me back from really
[1:40:35] surrendering the way out where I wanted
[1:40:37] was something within and I knew I need
[1:40:38] to because I was looking at my abilities
[1:40:41] and I knew I cannot live this I've tried
[1:40:46] I've made commitments I tried to do this
[1:40:49] and it held me back but I'm so grateful
[1:40:52] that His grace
[1:40:54] I said His grace yet overrode calling
[1:40:59] myself will it come to a plate so I
[1:41:03] realized it ain't about myself will it's
[1:41:05] what he has already done and what he
[1:41:08] will do through me then when we're
[1:41:14] looking at him in that right way fear
[1:41:17] has to flee brethren would say don't be
[1:41:22] afraid we have an advocate he stands
[1:41:26] bias he's in US and he makes
[1:41:31] intercession for us the Holy Spirit
[1:41:34] constantly constantly I like that making
[1:41:38] an advocate for us all the time he is
[1:41:41] our advocate he's with me through thick
[1:41:47] and thin he said he'd never leave me nor
[1:41:54] forsake me now the death might fly up on
[1:41:57] the branch but I never lose the Holy
[1:42:02] Ghost there's an advocate I have with
[1:42:06] the father let's look at this just a few
[1:42:10] moments here and finishing this up
[1:42:13] brother Branham would say like this
[1:42:15] forgive in prayer forgive our many
[1:42:18] weaknesses and Lord
[1:42:19] we don't intend to do anything wrong
[1:42:22] Lord but through flesh we do make
[1:42:26] mistakes daily so in order to stay alive
[1:42:29] in Christ we have to die to our own
[1:42:34] thoughts so keep us dead to ourselves
[1:42:38] and alive in him I don't know about you
[1:42:42] but that's my prayer
[1:42:44] keep me dead to my thoughts and alive in
[1:42:48] you you know the Bible would tell us
[1:42:50] when we read our scripture here this
[1:42:53] morning it would let us know if we
[1:42:57] confess our sins he is faithful and just
[1:43:01] to forgive us and to cleanse us from all
[1:43:04] unrighteousness the opening scripture we
[1:43:07] read this morning my little children I
[1:43:11] write unto you that you sin not to the
[1:43:15] admonition this is why this is why that
[1:43:20] old Baptist theology it's not of God
[1:43:23] well you've got a sin a little bit every
[1:43:26] day that's a lie
[1:43:28] that's a lie you don't have to do
[1:43:32] nothing a little bit every day whether
[1:43:35] you're looking at it wrong you need to
[1:43:39] look at the pardoning power that there
[1:43:42] is strength in the blood of the Lamb
[1:43:47] God's not calling survivors you're an
[1:43:51] overcomer
[1:43:54] amen you're anointed to overcome in this
[1:43:57] hour but send me or not I fear I'm not
[1:44:01] preaching about how you feel I'm telling
[1:44:03] you who you are
[1:44:04] you're igniter to overcome the word has
[1:44:08] come to lift you in the reality of this
[1:44:11] word and let you know that you sin not
[1:44:17] and if any man sin we have an advocate
[1:44:24] with the father Jesus Christ the
[1:44:27] righteous why would he why would this be
[1:44:31] placed in here
[1:44:32] in this time the same reason God would
[1:44:35] tell Joshua and just with chapter 1 as I
[1:44:38] was with Moses so will I be with you in
[1:44:42] that one statement God let Joshua know
[1:44:44] through all of Moses mistakes and
[1:44:47] failures through all the failures in the
[1:44:50] journey in the wilderness I was with
[1:44:54] Moses not who was with Moses I am with
[1:44:59] you also you see what the pardoning
[1:45:01] power does it don't just stay with the
[1:45:04] messenger who brings it as an example
[1:45:07] but it comes to you and I that we can
[1:45:09] walk with that same boldness and
[1:45:12] authority as sons and daughters of God
[1:45:14] brother Brenton would put it just like
[1:45:16] this he said when Joshua heard those
[1:45:18] words he could walk with the reckless
[1:45:20] faith reckless faith you know what that
[1:45:24] means
[1:45:24] I mean don't know how might make a
[1:45:28] mistake
[1:45:30] well what should I you know what should
[1:45:33] I do first of all calm down I mean
[1:45:36] that's first you have an audience with
[1:45:45] the king you can go to him he said ask
[1:45:51] to father anything in my name it I will
[1:45:53] do it
[1:45:55] Lord I don't know which way to turn
[1:45:56] right here I don't know what to do right
[1:45:58] here
[1:45:59] hi I'm in need of your leadership right
[1:46:01] here Lord this is coming up once I do
[1:46:04] look to him do not be dismayed dismayed
[1:46:10] means to be shattered and fall apart
[1:46:13] like a vase
[1:46:15] there'll be situations oh my I wish I
[1:46:17] could preach on this right now in the
[1:46:19] land there's situations that will arise
[1:46:22] then absolutely fear can come but the
[1:46:26] word of the Lord is there
[1:46:27] perfect love casts out fear we could
[1:46:31] remember that I am with you whether so
[1:46:35] ever thou goest I am with you we have an
[1:46:44] advocate with the father Jesus Christ
[1:46:47] the righteous do the brennaman I just
[1:46:54] want to read these points to you he says
[1:46:59] the Lord I'm praying for them this is
[1:47:00] present stage of my ministry I pray for
[1:47:04] them that they will not any time fail
[1:47:06] and if they do fail make quickly they
[1:47:10] have that advocate with the father which
[1:47:13] I have learned to be such a great thing
[1:47:17] I don't know about you but I've learned
[1:47:20] the same thing the advocate with the
[1:47:22] father is a great thing I've had to
[1:47:26] learn it how by experience Amen father
[1:47:32] that when I make all my mistakes what I
[1:47:34] find that I have an advocate right quick
[1:47:37] with the father through Jesus Christ and
[1:47:39] I'm brought back into grace again the
[1:47:42] loving hand of the Lord wipes away
[1:47:44] there's a bloody sacrifice laying there
[1:47:47] that I confess to be my Savior and if
[1:47:55] you know we need to continually be
[1:47:56] cleansed we need to continue to be
[1:47:59] washed once our soul has been lost from
[1:48:03] the defilement of sin our so no longer
[1:48:06] needs washing but we still need washing
[1:48:09] of water by the word when Peter asked
[1:48:15] the Lord Jesus in John chapter 13 he
[1:48:18] said he said wash all of me and Jesus
[1:48:22] said he that is washed
[1:48:26] needeth not safe to wash his feet but is
[1:48:30] clean every whit and ye are clean but
[1:48:35] not all this whole principle is that the
[1:48:39] cleansing washing of water by the word
[1:48:44] is washing us it's cleansing us it's
[1:48:51] washing that it isn't once that back
[1:48:54] that new birth is coming my soul my soul
[1:48:56] has been washed but I need continual
[1:49:00] wash his brother bran would say before
[1:49:06] the throne he said there on the throne
[1:49:08] is everliving making intercession the
[1:49:11] Christian is kept clean day and night in
[1:49:15] the presence of God it cleanses us
[1:49:18] constantly day and night from all sin we
[1:49:20] are safely tucked in well he said
[1:49:24] there's no more judgement but Christian
[1:49:26] never goes to the judgment Christ went
[1:49:28] for him
[1:49:29] my attorney stood in my place many of
[1:49:38] you remember the interview that brother
[1:49:41] Branham did had with sister Bruce and
[1:49:46] I've told you this I've said this to you
[1:49:48] over and over as it was relayed to me by
[1:49:51] another individual who was there at the
[1:49:53] Tabernacle this was not sister Bruce
[1:49:56] that called this interview brother
[1:49:59] branham called it but the RAM heard what
[1:50:02] she had been saying oh I wish I had what
[1:50:05] you had I wish I had what you had and
[1:50:07] brother Branham called
[1:50:09] the interview with her
[1:50:13] and here his sister Bruce you know she's
[1:50:15] in the midst of a condition that's in
[1:50:17] her body at the time her heart she's
[1:50:20] suffering in her heart and as far as
[1:50:23] gonna have to have a procedure if the
[1:50:25] Lord doesn't intervene on her behalf but
[1:50:29] ranma's talking with her and I just want
[1:50:31] to relay these words he said now he said
[1:50:34] you know I'm gonna pray for you but you
[1:50:36] know I'm not worthy of that he said but
[1:50:39] if I was thinking if Jesus Christ
[1:50:41] himself was here he'd lay his hands on
[1:50:43] you
[1:50:43] he said now my hands you know to think
[1:50:47] of it it's not my hands he said but I'm
[1:50:49] standing in his place I've come to
[1:50:55] represent him he said before God I'm not
[1:51:00] a sinner neither are you
[1:51:04] that's powerful that's something that it
[1:51:08] you need to say Lord let it sink down to
[1:51:11] the fifth rib we got a blood sacrifice
[1:51:17] laying there God don't even see us he
[1:51:21] hears our voice but he sees the blood of
[1:51:23] Christ he sees the blood of his own son
[1:51:26] it's our voice Christ's blood then it's
[1:51:29] Christ that's talking through us to God
[1:51:32] so therefore we're not sinners no more
[1:51:35] we are Christians sister Bruce says you
[1:51:44] can put your name there I make so many
[1:51:46] mistakes and I failed so many times
[1:51:50] that's why Christ had to die so that you
[1:51:55] with your mistakes wouldn't be lauded to
[1:51:58] you he took your mistakes your desire in
[1:52:01] your heart is to serve Him that's what
[1:52:03] he died for so you could serve Him your
[1:52:08] mistakes are not looked or lauded to you
[1:52:11] he is your perpetuation he is your sin
[1:52:16] offering your sins are not knowing
[1:52:19] you're not a sinner before God Christ
[1:52:22] took your sins and became you
[1:52:24] because your desire is to serve Him
[1:52:29] how is that possible brother Samuel I
[1:52:32] now have made mistakes but the desire
[1:52:35] within your heart there's been a change
[1:52:38] in your life and the desire is not to do
[1:52:42] wrong you don't have the things of the
[1:52:47] world the love is to cause the desire as
[1:52:52] I do only those things that please him
[1:52:56] that's where conviction comes in our
[1:52:59] heart even as I said even when the
[1:53:03] motive of something has been wrong
[1:53:07] everybody else you could go to a person
[1:53:09] and say forgive me I shouldn't have said
[1:53:12] that
[1:53:12] maybe I'm the only one that's had to do
[1:53:15] that not just one hand both hands I
[1:53:19] don't have enough fingers let's say no I
[1:53:26] didn't I didn't I didn't catch nothing I
[1:53:28] I mean but what I knew the Holy Ghost
[1:53:31] had smoked my heart your motive your
[1:53:37] attitude within it
[1:53:39] no outside here looks just right now I
[1:53:45] know I'm not preaching angels this
[1:53:46] morning I'm preaching the mortals sons
[1:53:53] and daughters of God who are encompassed
[1:53:55] with infirmities just like I am but we
[1:54:00] can receive it here this morning listen
[1:54:01] to me you don't have to live looking at
[1:54:04] infirmities you look to him who is our
[1:54:08] help and our strength remember it isn't
[1:54:12] holy Lord if I could just get away from
[1:54:14] this where nervousness wants to come
[1:54:16] around me
[1:54:17] God said how about it I got something
[1:54:19] better than that how about I'll let how
[1:54:22] about I drool over that thing in your
[1:54:24] life and I turn it over to you and
[1:54:26] Shaitan wants to make his encroachment
[1:54:29] again because you realize Satan will try
[1:54:32] to make his encroachment but you have
[1:54:34] become
[1:54:35] ruler over that thing and you're an
[1:54:38] overcomer because you recognize that
[1:54:40] thing when it starts to rise and you
[1:54:42] know that greater is He that is in me is
[1:54:44] greater than that and has already
[1:54:47] overcome that thing glory be to God feel
[1:54:54] like she'll hallelujah he's standing he
[1:55:00] is our advocate standing on our behalf
[1:55:03] we are identified in our sacrifice
[1:55:07] oh my I'll tell you I just love that I
[1:55:12] love that so much
[1:55:15] but the RAM talks about that how he says
[1:55:17] Oh God in another place awakening Jesus
[1:55:20] we're going to the throne of God to ask
[1:55:22] for pardoning of our sins because
[1:55:23] knowing day by day we do fail thee every
[1:55:26] hour of our day seldom one passes
[1:55:28] without we have to stop and say Lord
[1:55:30] forgive me I didn't mean to do it just
[1:55:33] that way I should have done it this
[1:55:35] other way then we know Lord that you're
[1:55:38] always so full of mercy and ready to
[1:55:40] forgive your children you listen to
[1:55:43] their famous cry we're so glad that we
[1:55:46] have an advocate
[1:55:56] the Bible is clear the worshipper once
[1:56:00] purged has no more desire for sin he
[1:56:04] don't want to see him he'll do things
[1:56:09] wrong and as soon as he does it he'll
[1:56:12] confess his sins right there sometimes
[1:56:18] you might try to go along and try to
[1:56:20] reason it out well you know I had to do
[1:56:23] this because of this but remember the
[1:56:27] tax case come on somebody when the
[1:56:33] Prophet went to pray for that that child
[1:56:35] the Holy Spirit rebuked him said you
[1:56:38] hypocrite
[1:56:39] is that right but brother Branham knew
[1:56:42] where to go go to his advocate you see
[1:56:46] as it listened to me as the son and
[1:56:48] daughter of God in taking the promises
[1:56:52] of God I want you to understand this to
[1:56:54] have an advocate with the father does
[1:56:58] not mean that we live a haphazard
[1:57:01] compromising life this is for you and I
[1:57:05] to walk with authority that you're not
[1:57:08] sealed one day and unsealed the next day
[1:57:11] you're not a Christian one day and not a
[1:57:14] Christian the next day I'm a son of God
[1:57:16] or a daughter of God today I'm not a son
[1:57:18] or not no you may not feel that one but
[1:57:23] when the Holy Ghost is there within your
[1:57:26] soul by the nature the indwelling of his
[1:57:28] life your status has never changed in
[1:57:33] the presence of God but fellowship must
[1:57:38] be restored and the only way for
[1:57:41] fellowship to be restored is to confess
[1:57:45] your sin and he is faithful and just to
[1:57:51] forgive us
[1:57:53] and then this is where apostle paul
[1:57:56] could tell you and i in order to keep
[1:58:00] possessing the land Paul said I've
[1:58:04] learned to forget those things that are
[1:58:09] behind me how in the world could Paul
[1:58:12] say that well it was a reality that Paul
[1:58:15] had to come to in his life so that it
[1:58:18] came to a place to Paul accepting what
[1:58:23] God had did for him and through his life
[1:58:28] that it wasn't that when Paul got ready
[1:58:30] to go make a move the devil bring this
[1:58:33] back up and said yeah but you failed
[1:58:34] right here yeah but you the devil listen
[1:58:38] to me that same very deep but you're
[1:58:40] walking victory the devil is always
[1:58:43] there to remind you of your failures and
[1:58:46] if you start dueling on those failures
[1:58:48] you start questioning your life you get
[1:58:52] your eyes off of your you get your eyes
[1:58:54] off the sacrifice and you get your eyes
[1:58:56] on yourself when you do that feel it
[1:58:59] starts to come in you are paralyzed
[1:59:01] right there what I have to do keep your
[1:59:05] eyes on the sacrifice have faith in the
[1:59:08] word that if we confess our sins he is
[1:59:11] faithful and just to forgive us and
[1:59:14] cleanse us from all unrighteousness
[1:59:18] the devil trying to hang something over
[1:59:21] ahead to try to do what keep you from
[1:59:24] possessing the ground that God has given
[1:59:27] to you as sons and daughters of God he's
[1:59:32] always there but remember that life
[1:59:36] within you if you give that the right
[1:59:39] away it'll stand for you and you find
[1:59:41] that release in that channel moves right
[1:59:44] now anybody with me this morning
[1:59:51] this is right down with what you put in
[1:59:53] the lunch box tomorrow amen this goes
[1:59:56] with you along with your thermos body
[1:59:59] there's always a regret of the mistakes
[2:00:02] in the past if there's no regret if it's
[2:00:08] as well you know then there's something
[2:00:12] wrong it's not just oh well it's mites
[2:00:18] our heart the Holy Ghost brings
[2:00:21] conviction God's desire is that that
[2:00:27] life would be so preeminent inside of us
[2:00:32] that that pardoning power that cleansing
[2:00:35] power that we live by the advocacy of
[2:00:39] the Lord Jesus Christ having faith in
[2:00:43] that word truly when we've done wrong we
[2:00:46] are condemned but this is why we repent
[2:00:51] this is why we go to him and we ask him
[2:00:54] to forgive us because we believe what he
[2:00:58] said that he would forgive us Jesus does
[2:01:03] not listen to me Jesus does not through
[2:01:05] forgiveness hold something over your
[2:01:07] head
[2:01:08] that ain't forgiveness Jesus don't bring
[2:01:11] it back up that's the devil once it has
[2:01:17] went in the blood it's no more you
[2:01:24] remember it and the devil tries to
[2:01:26] reminds you of it oh my but this is
[2:01:32] where to learn this very principle in
[2:01:36] warfare that in order to take land to
[2:01:39] recognize I've got an advocate with the
[2:01:41] father Jesus Christ the righteous this
[2:01:45] right here will never be perfect in this
[2:01:48] life it's not an excuse but this was God
[2:01:53] get born again just like this got born
[2:01:54] again but this right here on the inside
[2:01:58] this new birth is leading this thing to
[2:02:00] a body change
[2:02:02] if a man the Spirit of God on the inside
[2:02:05] is bringing it in subjection the
[2:02:08] amendment things of Rosa and we're
[2:02:11] falling in traps and other things we've
[2:02:13] sent things wrong but thanks be to God
[2:02:15] not just for forgiveness but thanks be
[2:02:18] to God but we've got a confidence to say
[2:02:20] lord help me Lord God help me to
[2:02:25] recognize that and to overcome I'm
[2:02:33] grateful for the real pardoning power of
[2:02:37] the Advocate of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:02:41] one who stands by me one who stands in
[2:02:47] us and is constantly interceding on our
[2:02:51] behalf aren't you glad for that person
[2:02:54] and amen let's bow our heads Lord Jesus
[2:03:03] Lord every every need every heart you
[2:03:10] know Lord you know in this whole journey
[2:03:17] that Lord the journey that we we are in
[2:03:22] your Lord you knew of every every every
[2:03:28] trap and all that would lay around but
[2:03:31] that was not your focus that was not
[2:03:35] your focus
[2:03:38] Lord neither is it to be our focus we're
[2:03:44] not to walk in fear we're not to walk
[2:03:49] underneath condemnation because you
[2:03:52] can't it's got to be lifted Lord
[2:03:59] we're fellowship has been broken sin
[2:04:03] hinders fellowship Lord you're our
[2:04:11] advocate as John would write we have an
[2:04:16] advocate with the father Jesus Christ
[2:04:20] the righteous years the perpetuation of
[2:04:24] our sins Lord you see father throughout
[2:04:30] this building this morning you see every
[2:04:35] heart Lord in every life lord I believe
[2:04:42] dear God that you've spoken to our
[2:04:45] hearts and a personal way Lord to remind
[2:04:51] us
[2:04:53] to also to teach us
[2:04:56] Lord that our faith because in this
[2:05:00] journey not that we would live under
[2:05:05] Lord the thought of well I could just be
[2:05:10] forgiven
[2:05:11] no how are we we're so thankful Lord for
[2:05:16] your forgiveness we're so thankful for
[2:05:19] your mercy and your grace we're so
[2:05:21] thankful Lord how we have learned what a
[2:05:25] great thing the Advocate is the Lord
[2:05:29] from our hearts it's never our desire to
[2:05:33] do wrong when we have been changed quick
[2:05:39] and Lord in our lives it's never our
[2:05:42] desire to do the desire is to please you
[2:05:46] so Lord we realize that it's like the
[2:05:51] man who went into the Ballard flour
[2:05:56] company and he went in there because he
[2:05:59] wanted a job and the man walked in there
[2:06:03] and he had a pencil but mr. Ballard
[2:06:07] noticed that pencil didn't have an
[2:06:09] eraser on it and he asked that he asked
[2:06:14] that man he said sir why don't why don't
[2:06:18] you have any eraser on your pencil
[2:06:22] he said well symbol I don't make any
[2:06:26] mistakes mr. Ballard quickly endured
[2:06:31] ended the interview he let the man know
[2:06:38] I can't use you then I can't hire you
[2:06:43] the man's reply what do you mean he said
[2:06:47] because a person who doesn't make any
[2:06:51] mistakes is a person who don't do
[2:06:54] anything they don't work at
[2:06:58] [Music]
[2:07:00] Lord Jesus we don't have pencils without
[2:07:04] erasers our pencil hallelujah
[2:07:11] our life Lord God the Spirit of God
[2:07:16] within us Lord it has that pardoning
[2:07:19] power Lord that erasing Lord that lifts
[2:07:26] the strength that we need and when
[2:07:30] fellowship is broken that it can be
[2:07:31] restored as sons and daughters of God
[2:07:34] again that we might rise above that Lord
[2:07:39] that we might belong and possess what
[2:07:44] you are calling us to possess help us
[2:07:49] Lord we stand every day of our lives in
[2:07:53] need of you Lloyd
[2:07:55] or Jesus were overcomers Baba blood of
[2:08:01] the Lamb and the word of our testimony
[2:08:06] or Jesus how we thank you Lord this
[2:08:11] morning
[2:08:12] I pray if there's one Lord that's
[2:08:14] gathered here this morning under the
[2:08:17] sound of my voice then Lord they don't
[2:08:20] know that pardoning power they don't
[2:08:23] know what it is Lord within their heart
[2:08:25] to actually be free from the bondage and
[2:08:28] defilement of sin Lord Jesus may in the
[2:08:33] simpleness of simplicity Lord God as
[2:08:38] their heart would be moved by your
[2:08:40] spirit may they Lord God accept that
[2:08:44] Lord may be Lord accept that inside with
[2:08:49] the word it say Lord I don't want to
[2:08:53] just have a church life I want to have
[2:08:57] your life I want that life to live with
[2:09:01] inside of me where I am made free from
[2:09:06] the law of sin and death the desire of
[2:09:10] the world has fled from my soul
[2:09:16] or God receiving power and life to live
[2:09:21] in victory in this hour as a son and
[2:09:24] daughter of God Granite Lord granted to
[2:09:26] those hearts this morning Lloyd and I
[2:09:29] pray father as we stood here Lord set
[2:09:33] here and we gathered under your presence
[2:09:36] Lord I ask that may God within every one
[2:09:40] of our hearts if there's one that's out
[2:09:43] of fellowship but around here this
[2:09:45] morning the Holy Spirit Lord has food to
[2:09:48] their heart that they would come back
[2:09:50] into fellowship or Jesus and whatever it
[2:09:54] would be Lord that would be hindering
[2:09:56] whatever it is that they've let it go
[2:09:58] unattended Lord if it's something Lord
[2:10:01] that has been said wrong or done if it's
[2:10:03] a trap Lord God I believe this morning
[2:10:05] Lord God that you're present to spring
[2:10:10] that trap
[2:10:11] I believe that Lord I believe you're
[2:10:15] pressing this morning Lord that they can
[2:10:19] walk out of here
[2:10:23] or Jesus that they can walk out of here
[2:10:27] the sporty without Lord God that load or
[2:10:32] that burden an order to respond to the
[2:10:35] conviction of the Holy Spirit and not
[2:10:38] just here but Lord every day of our
[2:10:41] lives we don't want to see how close we
[2:10:43] can live to the world like the man Lord
[2:10:47] who was seeking for a driver and he
[2:10:50] asked these drivers in the ones said I
[2:10:52] can drive real I can drive so close to
[2:10:54] the edge of that mountain then this
[2:10:57] other one said I don't see how close I
[2:10:59] can get to the edge I just stand right
[2:11:02] up tight to the mountain that God said
[2:11:05] that's where that you're the one I want
[2:11:06] to drive me Lord our desire is not to
[2:11:12] see how close to the world that we can
[2:11:15] live our desire is not for the world of
[2:11:19] how much that we could have our desire
[2:11:23] is to please you Lord Jesus
[2:11:25] [Music]
[2:11:26] it's to serve you with all of our hearts
[2:11:31] even in Lord some of the deepest of
[2:11:35] parts in our life with motives objective
[2:11:39] attitudes our thinking Lord God even how
[2:11:45] your prophet would tell us that even if
[2:11:48] we go to thinking the wrong thought and
[2:11:54] he would give us the example like I've
[2:11:55] got a right to get even
[2:11:57] he said just thinking that wrong thought
[2:12:00] or caused the Dove to fly upon the roost
[2:12:05] lord help us help us the Lord God every
[2:12:11] moment of our life traps are all around
[2:12:14] us but we're not to walk in fear but may
[2:12:18] we Lord is your children as the word has
[2:12:20] come forward this morning
[2:12:22] may we pray over it may we take it Lord
[2:12:25] tomorrow morning when we wake up and we
[2:12:27] would start our day Lord may we ask for
[2:12:30] your leadership in the day Lourdes mama
[2:12:33] would get the kids ready to go daddy
[2:12:36] gets ready to go north God may the
[2:12:40] morning begin with the lamb and not God
[2:12:44] in the evening may it end with the lamb
[2:12:49] Lord for we believe there is strength
[2:12:53] strength in you Lord to live above the
[2:12:59] things of the world we want to be more
[2:13:03] like you
[2:13:06] conformed to the image of your dear son
[2:13:11] help us Lord in every test every drop
[2:13:13] help us father we pray in the name of
[2:13:16] Jesus Christ amen
