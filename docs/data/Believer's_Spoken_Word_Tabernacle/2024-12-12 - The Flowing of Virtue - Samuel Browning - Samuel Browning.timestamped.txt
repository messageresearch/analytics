[38:52] that it wouldn't we wouldn't be reminded
[38:54] that we're still in these temporary
[38:56] bodies and God also manifested that
[38:59] attribute of healing we won't need that

[42:59] things Lord For Your Glory in Jesus
[43:02] precious name
[43:05] amen amen and
[43:08] amen amen let's look at Job 26 here
[43:13] tonight
[43:20] and I want to just read back into
[43:25] those verses there there and if the Lord
[43:28] will help us I'd like to get into the
[43:29] second part of that verse of verse
[43:32] number
[43:36] two but job answered verse one of job 26
[43:40] job answered and said how hast thou
[43:43] helped him that is without
[43:47] power how savest thou the arm that hath
[43:53] no
[43:54] strength and that's where I'd like to
[43:56] just draw a little thought from here
[43:59] tonight on that how savest thou the arm
[44:02] that hath no strength amen may God bless
[44:06] you and bless the reading of the word as
[44:07] you're being seated I'd like to just
[44:10] speak here tonight if the Lord would
[44:12] help us go ahead Brandon if the Lord
[44:14] would help us I'd like to deal with that
[44:17] with that thought
[44:19] on uh the
[44:21] flowing of
[44:23] virtue maybe there let's try it again
[44:27] there we go the flowing of virtue and I
[44:31] just just having these thinking upon
[44:35] this in this manner and I want you just
[44:37] to think of of virtue as how that you'll
[44:40] see down through the scriptures in the
[44:42] no in the New Testament where it would
[44:44] be given that a virtue and how that
[44:48] God's Prophet would would go in to
[44:50] express this that this is God's strength
[44:53] it's God's power and it's part of of our
[44:58] uh the attributes or the even the
[45:00] virtues that would be a part of a
[45:03] Believer or to dwell within our lives
[45:05] and so we know that within this that job
[45:09] when he is expressing to these Brethren
[45:12] that came to him and remember as we have
[45:15] been looking at this that uh these
[45:18] Brethren brother brandham refers to him
[45:20] in 1964 Jesus came and called and he
[45:24] said it would be like the deacons of
[45:26] job's Church church and when you think
[45:28] of that you know that a deacon is one
[45:30] that would have to be proven a lot of
[45:32] times even how within that where a man's
[45:35] name could be given or recommended or
[45:37] feel like it and there's a lot of search
[45:39] that's got to be made and prayer within
[45:41] all that so evidently these would be men
[45:44] that would be of Integrity as well there
[45:47] would be a part within their life that
[45:49] would be blameless and and so we
[45:52] recognized that these were not men that
[45:54] had come to job uh and with any wrong
[45:58] intention but they would have been men
[46:00] that would have had great intentions but
[46:03] as we've been looking at that sometimes
[46:05] of the greatest intentions that we can
[46:07] have the discernment can be off and if
[46:11] there's things that we what we need what
[46:13] we need so greatly in this hour is the
[46:16] discernment of the Holy Spirit I think
[46:18] with the truth and all that God has
[46:21] given and what he's restored to us and
[46:23] even with the things that God has
[46:25] revealed in our life sometimes times
[46:27] there's things where we have to stop and
[46:29] we have to pray and then look at Lord
[46:31] how do I apply this it's not it's not
[46:34] hard you know to uh to go through and
[46:36] just to have a quote and we can finish
[46:39] the rest of it there's you know with my
[46:41] mind and memory I wish it was like that
[46:43] and other things a lot of times I can
[46:44] finish that uh maybe a quote that is
[46:47] said and then finish that out but that
[46:48] that's not what it is by the applying of
[46:51] the word of God it's where that when we
[46:53] can see within that and many times it
[46:55] isn't even necessarily where we are
[46:58] quoting a scripture or quoting a quote
[47:01] but it's actually where God is showing
[47:03] us how to approach a situation and it
[47:06] actually is the word of God that's being
[47:08] lived out in our lives and we're giving
[47:10] the right away to it and so one of the
[47:13] things that when we look at it that
[47:15] sometimes we may not feel you know as if
[47:17] it's just as if it's not as spiritual if
[47:19] I don't say a quote or if I don't say a
[47:21] scripture and I believe in all that but
[47:23] there's many times that when we look at
[47:25] it Lord I want to know what how do I
[47:28] approach this situation or how do I do I
[47:31] Minister there to my wife or to my
[47:33] husband or to family or to another
[47:35] brother or sister or someone else along
[47:37] the way and and notice how God when we
[47:39] begin to go before him Lord God will
[47:42] always have a basis and that basis will
[47:45] always be that of his word you you'll
[47:47] always find that there's something
[47:49] that'll move in your heart of a
[47:50] scripture a quote something that will
[47:52] come to you so it'll always be the basis
[47:55] of how that we were actually moving and
[47:58] acting upon him and so when you look
[48:00] here in this part of the scripture when
[48:03] uh when job would ask them the question
[48:05] how savest thou the arm that hath no
[48:08] strength now you and I both know that
[48:11] there's not one of us that can save
[48:13] another person remember how brother
[48:15] brandham was accused of being a Divine
[48:17] healer and he's brother Bram said well
[48:19] that that's that that does that didn't
[48:20] makees sense at all you're not a divine
[48:22] Savior you don't save anybody that's not
[48:25] I I'm not the one who heals anybody but
[48:27] to say that God would use a vessel to
[48:30] operate through in order for someone's
[48:32] Faith to be lifted in order to receive
[48:36] the the work of healing in their bodies
[48:38] of what God has already made available
[48:40] to them that's the same way it is with
[48:43] salvation the preaching of the word it
[48:46] actually brings the faith into the
[48:48] people to recognize the finished work of
[48:52] Calvary and for that reality to break
[48:54] upon a heart that he did it for me
[48:57] and that I'm saved and see that's all a
[48:59] work of God and God has had a channel
[49:02] that he could speak through Express
[49:04] through to bring that to you and I and
[49:06] so I want to just say it in this way
[49:08] when we look at this on the flowing of
[49:10] virtue that it's God's God desires there
[49:15] would be channels that he would operate
[49:17] through and that would be you and I and
[49:19] God would desire that that life would
[49:22] work and flow through the body and I
[49:24] want you to think of this too in order
[49:27] to be saved the scripture would tell us
[49:29] here in Romans 5:6 for when we were yet
[49:33] without Strength In Due Time Christ died
[49:37] for the ungodly so we we were without
[49:40] strength now down through the Old
[49:42] Testament you would find that God would
[49:45] send a word and there was an elect group
[49:48] of people that lived down through the
[49:51] Old Testament is that right and within
[49:54] that there was a measure of the the Holy
[49:57] Spirit they never experience the
[49:59] redeeming work of that of the new birth
[50:02] but they would experience the spirit of
[50:04] God coming upon their life as they would
[50:07] take that word that God would speak
[50:09] through that Prophet the minor Prophet
[50:11] would follow a major prophet calling
[50:13] them back to the word of God and there
[50:15] was an elect of God that would heed to
[50:17] that word and they by receiving that
[50:20] word would receive the strength that
[50:23] they needed at that time to be able to
[50:26] stand faithfully and that's how we read
[50:29] of it in the in Hebrews chap 11 by faith
[50:32] it's that Revelation that they received
[50:34] of God that strength that they received
[50:37] so when we were without Strength In Due
[50:39] Time Christ died for the ungodly so in
[50:42] order for this strength to come to you
[50:44] and I that we had need of in order to
[50:48] save you and I to redeem you and I it
[50:50] required that one would come on our
[50:53] behalf and it couldn't be anybody else
[50:55] but God him himself it was God's desire
[50:59] to bring this same strength his life
[51:02] back into his children once again and so
[51:06] notice when we were without Strength In
[51:09] Due Time Christ died for the ungodly and
[51:12] notice then as as the Lord Jesus would
[51:15] Express this even to Peter I have prayed
[51:18] for thee that thy faith fail not and
[51:21] when thou art converted strengthen thy
[51:25] brethren so prior to conversion Peter
[51:29] did not have the ability to strengthen
[51:31] the Brethren as according to what the
[51:33] Lord Jesus was talking about this would
[51:36] come after P Peter's experience on the
[51:39] day of Pentecost where he would actually
[51:42] receive the strength that he lacked in
[51:45] his life well what strength did he lack
[51:47] he walked with the Lord Jesus he fished
[51:50] with him he fellowshipped with him but
[51:52] when it came time to stand in the midst
[51:55] of adversity remember he denied him
[51:58] three
[51:59] times is that right he turned he didn't
[52:02] have the strength God you know that was
[52:03] all part of Prophecy in scripture Smite
[52:06] the shepherd and the Sheep will be
[52:08] scattered that was all part of it but
[52:09] notice that that within this he is
[52:12] speaking to him that Peter when you are
[52:15] converted in other words when you have
[52:17] become a channel that the Holy Spirit
[52:20] can operate that my strength can flow
[52:24] through you to others and I believe with
[52:27] all my heart that not only has God
[52:30] intended that the strength it is it is
[52:33] it is absolutely to operate through the
[52:35] body that's how life travels that
[52:39] because when you look at the unic when
[52:41] the unic was down there remember he was
[52:43] reading in Isaiah and he's looking there
[52:45] and he's saying uh he doesn't understand
[52:48] in Isaiah 533 who's the prophet speaking
[52:51] of and God transports Phillip from the
[52:54] meeting in Samaria there's no way that
[52:57] he took a normal Transportation it was
[53:00] Supernatural Transportation God brought
[53:03] him there to where there was a need and
[53:06] when he begin to come near he drew near
[53:08] to The Chariot as the spirit led him and
[53:10] he begin to speak to this unic and the
[53:13] unic said and when he asked him how do
[53:15] you understand what you're reading he
[53:16] said how can I except some man should
[53:18] guide me and and Philip began in the
[53:21] scriptures and begin to preach unto him
[53:24] Jesus Christ and notice the the result
[53:27] was is that man he had taken him all the
[53:30] way not only into water baptism but that
[53:33] man was a fit candidate to walk as a Son
[53:36] of God after that why he had received
[53:39] strength he just didn't have knowledge
[53:42] that the atonement has come but that man
[53:45] because Phillip standing there as a
[53:47] vessel the life came through the body
[53:50] and it birthed that man into the body of
[53:53] Jesus Christ God intends there's no
[53:56] other way outside of the body of Jesus
[53:58] Christ and you know what his life does
[54:00] coming through the body it only begot it
[54:03] only brings forth more of his own kind
[54:06] Sons and Daughters of God this is why
[54:08] this message when we look at it it's not
[54:11] something that that would be altogether
[54:14] new but it is that which God is
[54:16] restoring us back to the faith that was
[54:19] once delivered to the Saints to where
[54:21] that in this hour we have been brought
[54:23] to a place to come in contact with Jesus
[54:26] Christ in a personal way to have a real
[54:29] fellowship and a real experience with
[54:32] almighty God to where his life is
[54:34] flowing through you and I and coming to
[54:37] a place to where there's nothing in the
[54:39] word of God that our life our soul would
[54:42] not punctuate with an amen that's the
[54:46] strength of the word of God operating in
[54:48] our life it doesn't matter what we look
[54:50] like on the outside doesn't matter what
[54:52] we feel like it it that that's not it at
[54:55] all it's the strength of God that is
[54:57] operating through the
[55:00] Believers oh my and you know the think
[55:02] of it is even the powerful thing when I
[55:05] think of it as it comes to me right now
[55:07] remember Sister Hatty right as she sat
[55:08] there in her house and you know her
[55:11] simple agreeing with God's word what a
[55:14] respect that she had and with that
[55:16] simple agreeing with God's word you know
[55:19] as I as I talk with some of the
[55:20] different ones that were there and to
[55:22] know about how her house was Sister
[55:24] Hattie's house would not have been a
[55:25] house that that any king or president
[55:27] would have wanted to come to you could
[55:29] see right through the boards to the
[55:31] outside yet it was a place where brother
[55:33] Bram loved to come and fellowship with
[55:35] different ones and we've been right
[55:37] around there to see it where it would be
[55:39] upon the hill and here she is standing
[55:41] there when the word is coming forth and
[55:43] she said that ain't nothing but the
[55:45] truth and notice her agreeance with the
[55:49] word of God from her heart it brought a
[55:52] super anointing into that room the
[55:55] prophet called it a super anointing he
[55:58] said that anointing filled the room and
[56:01] she was and then her request or was
[56:03] given to her ask what you will and she
[56:06] said what should I ask for and brother
[56:08] BR says that that's up to you and he be
[56:11] to lay out different things God would
[56:13] have given her any request of her heart
[56:16] but she asked for the Salvation of her
[56:19] boys and the prophet said right there he
[56:22] said God those boys who were snickering
[56:25] and laughing at the testimonies being
[56:27] told about the squirrels the power of
[56:30] God came in that room it broke that
[56:32] snickering and it brought salvation and
[56:35] filled them with the Holy Ghost what did
[56:38] that simple agreeance and obedience to
[56:41] the word of God let me tell you friends
[56:43] you want to invite the power of God and
[56:45] the strength of God to move down let our
[56:47] hearts let everything within us let it
[56:50] say Amen to the word of God Amen virtue
[56:54] will flow right through the word of God
[56:56] that lays transforming power and notice
[56:59] how the scripture would tell us in
[57:01] Ephesians chapter 6 finally my brethren
[57:04] be strong in the Lord and in the power
[57:07] of His might now over and over you find
[57:10] this theme throughout the Old Testament
[57:13] even into the New Testament even in
[57:15] there in the book of Zechariah where he
[57:17] would look at the candlesticks and say
[57:19] and what is this not by might not by
[57:22] power but by my spirit sayeth the Lord
[57:24] if there's any achievement or any
[57:26] accomplishment in our life it must be by
[57:29] his Spirit but it takes our yielding to
[57:32] God in order for God to do what he wants
[57:35] to do how many to say Lord help me yield
[57:39] help me yield Lord so when we look at
[57:42] this then really the strength that's in
[57:44] the church God in the church becomes its
[57:47] strength because the prophet would tell
[57:49] us like this in the message contest he
[57:52] would say you know the word is God and
[57:55] the word becomes our strength God in the
[57:58] church becomes its strength notice God
[58:03] in the church so when we're talking
[58:05] about the word we're not talking about
[58:07] the letter we're talking about the
[58:10] spirit it's the spirit that gives life
[58:13] the letter we can have all knowledge and
[58:15] listen knowledge is a part of it we need
[58:17] to know what belongs to us but the
[58:20] spirit of God is what actually gives
[58:22] life and brings the word of God into a
[58:25] place in our life to where that word is
[58:27] now operating in strength in our life
[58:30] and we see the strength of God operating
[58:33] in and through our lives we see our
[58:36] desires have changed we see a strength
[58:38] on the inside that's greater than our
[58:40] own reasoning ability because you know
[58:42] why because the very judgment seat of
[58:45] Christ has come into the heart of the
[58:48] believer once you have been born again
[58:51] of the spirit of God and there's a place
[58:53] where your sins are taken daily
[58:57] oh my thank God for that strength on the
[58:59] inside that operates there within our
[59:02] lives so it's God's strength operating
[59:06] within our lives God in the church now
[59:08] let me just read here a few places in
[59:10] the scripture the Bible says in that day
[59:13] shall the Lord of hosts be for a Crown
[59:15] of Glory what day is that that's this
[59:17] day this is the day where the crown is
[59:20] being set upon that of the Bride of
[59:23] Jesus Christ what are we crowned with
[59:25] we're crowned with his own life and
[59:27] eventually Our Lives will be crowned
[59:29] with that theophany body notice the Lord
[59:32] of hosts will be for a Crown of Glory
[59:35] and for a diadem of beauty unto the
[59:37] residue of his people and for a spirit
[59:40] of judgment to him that Seth in judgment
[59:43] brother BR said that's what he does for
[59:45] us at the altar and for strength to them
[59:49] that turn the battle to the gate so
[59:52] where what is the gate the gate is where
[59:54] transactions have taken place
[59:56] the gate is where that the transaction
[59:59] was taking place for Boaz to redeem
[1:00:01] Naomi Jesus suffered without the gate so
[1:00:05] there has been a settling of every
[1:00:07] transaction so where is our strength our
[1:00:10] strength is for everyone that will turn
[1:00:12] the battle to the gate he is my source
[1:00:16] of strength this is why that within
[1:00:18] every dispute and anything the enemy
[1:00:20] wants to bring about I'm coming right
[1:00:22] back to the word I'm coming right back
[1:00:25] to the Lord Jesus Christ no lay aside my
[1:00:27] feelings because if I go by my feelings
[1:00:30] go by my thoughts Then I then I it'll
[1:00:32] never actually judgment will never be
[1:00:35] executed in the right way I'll never
[1:00:37] receive the strength that I need in that
[1:00:41] situation notice in Isaiah 33 verse 5
[1:00:44] and 6 the Lord is exalted for he
[1:00:47] dwelleth on high he hath filled Zion
[1:00:51] with judgment and righteousness and
[1:00:54] wisdom and knowledge shall be the
[1:00:57] stability of thy times and strength of
[1:01:00] Salvation the fear of the Lord is his
[1:01:03] treasure what a powerful scripture what
[1:01:05] that that judgment and righteousness
[1:01:07] discernment and that righteousness of
[1:01:10] God's own life operating together and
[1:01:13] that in itself will bring bring about
[1:01:15] the stability within our lives I I'm
[1:01:19] thankful for the reality of the
[1:01:21] stableness of God's strength that it
[1:01:24] brings within our lives amen aren't you
[1:01:27] notice it's his strength now in in
[1:01:30] Psalms
[1:01:31] 28:7 the Bible says the Lord is my
[1:01:34] strength you'll find David write of this
[1:01:36] many many many many times the Lord is my
[1:01:38] strength and my shield my heart trusted
[1:01:41] in him and I am helped therefore my
[1:01:44] heart greatly rejoiceth and with my song
[1:01:48] will I praise him the Lord is their
[1:01:51] strength and he is the saving strength
[1:01:54] of his anointed
[1:01:56] not only is he your strength my strength
[1:01:59] but even in the midst of those times
[1:02:02] where we need saving and I'm not talking
[1:02:05] about once God has saved you it isn't
[1:02:07] that you need to be saved again but
[1:02:09] there are times that within the midst of
[1:02:11] our life whether it's a mind battle
[1:02:14] whether it's situations we're in a trap
[1:02:16] or something has come along the way but
[1:02:19] he is our the saving strength in other
[1:02:21] words there is delivering power in him
[1:02:25] when we can look to him I I tell you
[1:02:27] don't ever be ashamed to look to him
[1:02:30] well listen we always want to be honest
[1:02:32] with him I don't want to put on no face
[1:02:35] with him I don't want to act like
[1:02:36] everything well Lord everything's all
[1:02:38] right we don't have to act with him we
[1:02:41] can be right honest with him Lord I need
[1:02:44] strength Lord father I need help Lord
[1:02:47] and He is saving strength to his
[1:02:51] anointed oh God help us that's our
[1:02:54] strength that's not our weakness that's
[1:02:57] strength oh glory be to God oh my the
[1:03:01] Bible would talk about how that he gives
[1:03:03] power to the faint and how to them that
[1:03:07] have no might he increaseth strength
[1:03:11] even the youth shall faint and be weary
[1:03:13] and the young man shall utterly fail but
[1:03:16] they that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[1:03:19] their strength and they shall Mount up
[1:03:21] with wings as an eagle they shall run
[1:03:23] and not be weary and they shall walk and
[1:03:26] not
[1:03:27] faint now yet there are times of
[1:03:29] weariness there are times of fainting
[1:03:32] but not in our soul once he's ever
[1:03:35] strengthened that
[1:03:37] Soul that's that's the great the great
[1:03:40] Paradox we have this treasure in earn
[1:03:45] vessels there's times where we might get
[1:03:48] faint where we can get weary but this is
[1:03:50] the different when his strength is
[1:03:52] coming to us I'm not depending on my
[1:03:54] strength like like you young you young
[1:03:56] men that have strength and young that's
[1:03:58] the glory of your youth the glory uh is
[1:04:01] your strength but you know we're not
[1:04:03] depending on our strength you're
[1:04:04] depending on the strength of the Lord
[1:04:06] you're not living this life because my
[1:04:09] goodness I've got this all figured out
[1:04:11] it's not your strength it's God's
[1:04:13] strength inside of you operating his
[1:04:16] word right through your
[1:04:18] life as a Young Man a young lady we
[1:04:21] would
[1:04:22] faint but God gives strength on that
[1:04:27] inside to where it's a
[1:04:29] stability it holds Us in the midst of
[1:04:33] those times oh yeah we we can get weary
[1:04:35] we can get down brother Ram talks about
[1:04:37] it over and over and over and
[1:04:40] notice I want you to think of how of
[1:04:42] this very word this is a word that you
[1:04:46] know I know it's a scriptural word but
[1:04:48] it's a word that I would say that is
[1:04:52] very uh very much in the vocabulary
[1:04:56] of message Believers it's preeminence
[1:04:59] because it's dealing with what God's
[1:05:03] desire is
[1:05:05] for is for preeminence is where that in
[1:05:08] this hour this this is the
[1:05:11] time God could not have full preeminence
[1:05:15] now listen to the words I'm saying full
[1:05:18] preeminence he couldn't have it in the
[1:05:20] days of
[1:05:21] Luther he couldn't have it in the days
[1:05:24] of Wesley he did didn't have it in Aza
[1:05:27] Street
[1:05:28] Pentecost but it is in the evening time
[1:05:32] when there has come a word of
[1:05:35] restoration in the evening time God's
[1:05:38] Own Spirit to bring us back fully to the
[1:05:42] word of God God's Own Life coming in you
[1:05:46] and I and restoring us as Sons and
[1:05:49] Daughters of God they had their part now
[1:05:52] notice Luther lived out and they were to
[1:05:54] live or give preeminence to the just
[1:05:57] shall live by faith and that's all God
[1:05:59] will hold him accountable for Wesley
[1:06:01] gave preeminence to not only
[1:06:03] justification but un sanctification
[1:06:05] that's all God will hold them
[1:06:07] accountable for when the when the gifts
[1:06:09] Begin to Fall there in 1906 at ausa
[1:06:12] Street God they gave themselves to that
[1:06:14] remember they all the way down through
[1:06:16] when God's word more and more of his
[1:06:18] light more of the light more of the word
[1:06:19] would come there would be those that
[1:06:21] would stand up and they would refute it
[1:06:23] they would reject it and you know what
[1:06:24] they were doing they were rejecting
[1:06:27] life that's the danger you know we can
[1:06:30] carry this around but if we reject life
[1:06:33] we reject the very god of the word
[1:06:36] that's there to make that word
[1:06:38] live but here in the evening time God
[1:06:41] promised that he would restore God
[1:06:44] promised there would come a real Union
[1:06:47] back to where between Christ and his
[1:06:50] bride to where the word would have
[1:06:51] preeminence not you know look at look
[1:06:54] look if if we're looking out of
[1:06:55] scripture and man can explain one part
[1:06:59] of this Bible away to where that we can
[1:07:01] look at it and say well I don't have to
[1:07:03] adhere to that then then what about the
[1:07:06] rest of it amen what about I mean what
[1:07:09] what do we believe what what scripture
[1:07:10] is Vindicated and and what do we
[1:07:13] take are you hearing me because then you
[1:07:17] see in this hour this is where the
[1:07:19] message of the hour is not the thoughts
[1:07:22] of men trying to figure out God's
[1:07:25] program it's God's program being
[1:07:28] revealed to you and I and God's program
[1:07:31] is that he might live in the church and
[1:07:35] operate his word through our
[1:07:38] lives that virtue would flow through our
[1:07:42] lives my
[1:07:44] Hallelujah preeminence in other words
[1:07:48] first place to give Chief to see it's
[1:07:52] just as simple as this as God when God
[1:07:54] begins to take a hold of a life listen
[1:07:57] let me tell you you've got a goal but
[1:07:59] you can't get to that goal if you run a
[1:08:01] race you don't get to that goal by all
[1:08:03] of a sudden just hopping there you got
[1:08:05] to come step by step part of the way let
[1:08:08] me tell you it begins with simple just a
[1:08:10] simple part of looking at the word of
[1:08:12] God and saying yes Lord I give myself to
[1:08:15] you Lord and keep reading keep praying
[1:08:18] keep giving yourself to the word of God
[1:08:20] and you'll find things in your life that
[1:08:23] you look at and say that's impossible
[1:08:25] you'll find the strength of God that'll
[1:08:28] operate right through the word of God
[1:08:30] and as you pray you'll find habits begin
[1:08:32] to be broken you'll find strength begin
[1:08:35] to move in your life it's not a mystery
[1:08:38] it's the Simplicity of Jesus Christ
[1:08:40] operating through his
[1:08:42] word hallelujah I say boo
[1:08:46] devil boo
[1:08:48] devil amen reading just simple and
[1:08:51] reading the I don't feel anything
[1:08:53] reading the word of God praying and
[1:08:55] listening to the message and say God be
[1:08:58] unto me according to that word oh my
[1:09:01] there's power in that
[1:09:05] word glory be to God
[1:09:08] preeminence notice how brother BR says
[1:09:11] this in the message the contest I just
[1:09:13] want to read the first little bit and
[1:09:15] skip to the last line he's praying and
[1:09:17] saying God make us fit servants forgive
[1:09:20] our past bless our future guide us oh
[1:09:24] Lord with thy Mighty hand
[1:09:27] Jehovah then he's asking God's blessing
[1:09:29] upon ministers L visitors be with us
[1:09:32] Lord we're servants and we give
[1:09:34] ourselves holy to you for I wonder if we
[1:09:37] couldn't say instead of
[1:09:39] 1963 for Lord
[1:09:44] 2025 what for what that the power of
[1:09:48] your spirit might have more
[1:09:52] pinenes in our life and and in our
[1:09:57] being see it's a constant it's that
[1:10:01] constant reflection that constant
[1:10:02] fellowship with him the drawing from him
[1:10:06] I want that word to have more
[1:10:09] preeminence I want him to have more
[1:10:11] preeminence in my life now
[1:10:14] notice this is where that there comes a
[1:10:17] planting of Courage every time when the
[1:10:20] Bible tells us that the word is a seed
[1:10:23] and as that word would go forth the word
[1:10:24] is actually actually being sewn now when
[1:10:27] you know when a when a seed comes forth
[1:10:30] It's got to find ground to bed in and
[1:10:33] when it ground when it comes into that
[1:10:34] bedding ground it doesn't all of a
[1:10:36] sudden produce something necessarily
[1:10:39] right away there's some trees just like
[1:10:41] what we have out here a lot of them you
[1:10:43] see that are if you walk back there in
[1:10:44] any way a lot of them that's fallen over
[1:10:46] is many of them they're not necessarily
[1:10:48] oak trees but there are other forms of
[1:10:50] trees Beach and things like that that
[1:10:52] don't have a real strong root system and
[1:10:54] then you H them growing out there with
[1:10:56] the rest of them it's not real strong
[1:10:58] but there is a planting of courage and
[1:11:01] that's what God's desire is is that the
[1:11:03] word itself would so find its Mark
[1:11:06] within our lives and then what we do
[1:11:10] with it is what matters you see Satan
[1:11:12] would love nothing more than when we
[1:11:15] walk right out of here if somehow along
[1:11:17] the way he'll try to Spring a trap upon
[1:11:19] us maybe the next day or maybe in the
[1:11:22] evening and he's what he's trying to do
[1:11:24] is take us away from that that point of
[1:11:27] reflection and giving ourselves to that
[1:11:30] word we've received and if he can't do
[1:11:31] that then through a trap what he'll try
[1:11:33] to do is come and condemn you for
[1:11:35] failing in some way but let me just say
[1:11:38] this to you that all along the way when
[1:11:40] we rub shoulders with the world and
[1:11:42] everything else we are going to fail
[1:11:45] from time to time but that is not what
[1:11:47] I'm looking at or fixated on if we fail
[1:11:50] let's come back and say Lord forgive me
[1:11:53] and then take that word that that God
[1:11:55] has sown and he's planted in our hearts
[1:11:58] and begin to water it and how do we
[1:12:01] water it with prayer and
[1:12:04] Thanksgiving that's how we do it Lord I
[1:12:06] Thank you for your
[1:12:08] word I thank you Lord for for
[1:12:11] deliverance I thank you for strength I
[1:12:13] thank you for the Holy Ghost begin to
[1:12:15] thank God you say well how can I thank
[1:12:17] God if I don't already have something
[1:12:19] yet but when you've received that Word
[1:12:22] of Promise into your life there is an
[1:12:24] assurance
[1:12:25] that comes with that that God will make
[1:12:28] good on every promise he's
[1:12:32] given so planting courage this is why
[1:12:35] the prophet would say even in that
[1:12:37] message the contest Lord help me that I
[1:12:40] might say something that would plant
[1:12:43] courage in the heart of thy people you
[1:12:47] see we don't want just something that
[1:12:49] gives us courage just for this moment I
[1:12:52] think there's times for that don't you H
[1:12:54] there's times for that you can see that
[1:12:56] a lot of times you know maybe God will
[1:12:57] take a service it might might might come
[1:12:59] right through the pastor God will use an
[1:13:01] evangelist and somehow it'll be
[1:13:03] something that all of a sudden it'll
[1:13:05] just ignite and right then and there and
[1:13:07] our faith is just spontaneous it's God
[1:13:09] sovereignly working it's not man trying
[1:13:12] to work it up it's God just sovereignly
[1:13:15] moving within that moment now to me I
[1:13:17] don't care whether God wants to do it
[1:13:19] right away or his word it's going to
[1:13:22] come through me praying and praising him
[1:13:25] and thanking him for it irregardless
[1:13:27] it's God that's going to do the work and
[1:13:30] it is just as strong let me tell you
[1:13:32] something a miracle is just as powerful
[1:13:35] if you were standing right here in need
[1:13:37] in your life and you were healed right
[1:13:40] here while the word is coming forth or
[1:13:42] you're prayed for it you know the
[1:13:43] prophet actually said it's a greater
[1:13:46] Miracle to take a promise of God like
[1:13:49] Abraham did and go for 25
[1:13:53] years A lot of times we we don't think
[1:13:55] that way we we think of a miracle
[1:13:57] happening in a certain way but remember
[1:14:00] it's a miracle every day of your life is
[1:14:03] a miracle it's a miracle you're setting
[1:14:05] right here tonight don't let Satan try
[1:14:07] to downplay that you have fought through
[1:14:09] Devils today in order to be here and God
[1:14:13] has given you strength God has let
[1:14:15] singing come your way there's been
[1:14:17] anointed songs scriptures and and cloths
[1:14:20] and things that have been said and has
[1:14:22] given you and I the strength to stand
[1:14:24] right there every moment of the day it's
[1:14:28] a miracle friends and I tell you what
[1:14:30] it's going to be a miracle and we'll
[1:14:32] change one of these
[1:14:33] moments and it'll be worth it all but in
[1:14:37] the meantime he is the very source of
[1:14:39] our strength so we want to receive that
[1:14:41] word into our lives and allow it to be
[1:14:43] planted in us this is why the scripture
[1:14:46] would say if you abide in
[1:14:48] me and my words abide in you then ask
[1:14:52] what you will and it shall shall be done
[1:14:56] that's really incredible because when
[1:14:59] we're really abiding in him and we know
[1:15:01] to abide in him it's to be in him by his
[1:15:05] spirit and yet if a person could
[1:15:08] actually walk and live in Christ and
[1:15:10] Paul said if you live in him walk in him
[1:15:13] also so in other words I I'm thankful
[1:15:16] for what he's done in my life man that's
[1:15:19] I mean that there's a joy but as we
[1:15:21] begin to mature and grow we recognize
[1:15:23] that Lord I I I help me Lord that in
[1:15:26] everything of the word that that I'm
[1:15:29] receiving and help me Lord that that
[1:15:31] just to abide in the word of God there's
[1:15:33] a benefit for dwelling in the presence
[1:15:36] of
[1:15:39] God and his words and my words abide in
[1:15:44] you now notice then you will ask what
[1:15:47] you will and it shall be done no because
[1:15:50] this is all God's mind God's desire
[1:15:54] God's heart
[1:15:55] that is moving within our lives as
[1:15:58] Believers how would you and I even know
[1:16:01] what to even ask for if God didn't speak
[1:16:02] it to our
[1:16:04] hearts see it's God speaking it to our
[1:16:06] hearts and never said you ever leave out
[1:16:08] of a service whether here or somewhere
[1:16:09] else and it's just something has so
[1:16:11] touched your heart in such a way you
[1:16:13] just and it's not like you're trying to
[1:16:14] get it off your mind you just can't get
[1:16:15] it off your mind and here you are you're
[1:16:17] just thinking about that word and begin
[1:16:19] to pray about it it's so touched you
[1:16:20] Lord I I I just I want to just become so
[1:16:23] one with that word I want to see it live
[1:16:26] within my life Lord there's something
[1:16:27] about it Lord God I just how you spoke
[1:16:30] to me and it's things that we begin to
[1:16:32] dwell upon that and meditate upon that
[1:16:34] word and his words are there abiding in
[1:16:37] our life I tell you there's a lot of
[1:16:40] things that try to fill our
[1:16:42] lives lot of things is that right lot of
[1:16:45] things of the world there's a lot of
[1:16:46] things that I know just normal taxing
[1:16:49] business and things like that that once
[1:16:51] sometimes it just gets so much on our
[1:16:52] minds but yet there's always a battle
[1:16:55] for our attention a battle for our
[1:16:57] meditation but you know what there is a
[1:16:59] way that the word is able to abide and
[1:17:02] able also to handle all those other
[1:17:04] things of Life listen don't don't set
[1:17:06] don't set the word on the shelf and try
[1:17:09] to tackle everything of life let the
[1:17:11] word be the first priority in your life
[1:17:12] then the word will give you the strength
[1:17:14] and direction and the discernment you
[1:17:16] need with the task that you're in
[1:17:19] life now notice brother bam is talking
[1:17:22] about this this scripture in the message
[1:17:24] perfect faith and he's talking about how
[1:17:27] that the Lord Jesus that flowing from
[1:17:29] his life that's what we're talking about
[1:17:31] tonight the flowing of virtue and how
[1:17:35] that in his life he he walked in a world
[1:17:38] of perfect Faith a perfect faith in the
[1:17:42] perfect word of God it was a it was a
[1:17:45] place to where it was a complete rest
[1:17:47] and a complete trusting in what God or
[1:17:50] what the word had actually made him
[1:17:52] brother B will say that over and over
[1:17:54] what the word had actually made him and
[1:17:57] then brother Rand will also talk to us
[1:17:59] in the first part of that message and go
[1:18:01] all the way through of how that we've
[1:18:03] got to be in a position to receive this
[1:18:05] perfect Faith now we recognize that in
[1:18:08] order to be be in position it had to be
[1:18:10] the word that's brought us into position
[1:18:13] is that right and there's also those
[1:18:15] times that we realize faith for healing
[1:18:17] in our bodies the word that I I don't
[1:18:19] know how it's going to be I don't know
[1:18:20] if it's going to be operation I don't
[1:18:22] know you know if it's going to be
[1:18:23] through hands are laid on medicine I
[1:18:25] don't know how it's going to come to
[1:18:26] pass but I know that God is the Healer
[1:18:29] of that of that need in my body so when
[1:18:32] we look to God for Faith itself to be
[1:18:35] able to drop down into the bedding
[1:18:37] ground now I can't make that Faith drop
[1:18:39] you or I can't make that Faith drop we
[1:18:41] can stand right on the word of God right
[1:18:43] here tonight as you come up for prayer
[1:18:45] and we'll stand right on that word I
[1:18:47] believe it the shall lay hands on the
[1:18:49] sick and they shall recover anybody else
[1:18:51] believe that I believe that that is the
[1:18:53] word of Almighty God I've witnessed God
[1:18:56] do that right here in these Services
[1:18:59] I've witnessed God touch lives in this
[1:19:02] service I've witness here just two weeks
[1:19:04] ago some of you may have already left
[1:19:06] but sister Maria stood right here she
[1:19:08] came up after many had already left
[1:19:10] there was only a hand fuel standing
[1:19:11] right here and sister Maria came right
[1:19:13] up here and she talked to me about God
[1:19:15] had already moved for her knee he said
[1:19:17] and she's telling me how that her arm
[1:19:19] remember she couldn't even lift her arm
[1:19:21] up and right there in the service the
[1:19:23] spirit of God moved moved right down and
[1:19:25] she was able to lift up her arm and she
[1:19:28] stood right here to testify about it you
[1:19:30] know what it was God moving sovereignly
[1:19:33] by his word he had already given her a
[1:19:36] promise and here it was God came by and
[1:19:38] made good on that
[1:19:41] promise and I'm going to tell you that's
[1:19:43] what the devil's mad about is those
[1:19:45] testimonies that sister Maria's given
[1:19:47] and I'm going to tell you just like I
[1:19:48] told that liar today you're nothing but
[1:19:51] a
[1:19:52] liar God's word is the truth God's word
[1:19:56] stands as a Triumph by his Strife sister
[1:20:00] Maria is
[1:20:02] healed amen I believe that with all my
[1:20:07] heart notice how God's desire is that
[1:20:11] that word that it would so flow in our
[1:20:13] lives I you know I I can't determine you
[1:20:15] can't determine when that's going to
[1:20:17] drop but what you and I are responsible
[1:20:19] for is making sure the channel is
[1:20:23] available amen that it can drop that
[1:20:25] that faith can drop Now watch how
[1:20:28] brother B talks about this virtue
[1:20:29] remember you can read this how the New
[1:20:31] Testament virtue flowing out from him
[1:20:33] they would Touch the Hem of His Garment
[1:20:35] and you know virtue and they would
[1:20:36] receive healing in their body brother
[1:20:38] Brandon would say it like this he says
[1:20:40] now if ye abide in me through him he
[1:20:44] brought the word to you and my words
[1:20:46] abide in you then walk in the same kind
[1:20:49] of a way virtues flowing from you the
[1:20:53] rivers of of God's Fountains of
[1:20:56] blessings just flowing out to the
[1:21:00] people now he goes on to say you're not
[1:21:02] imagining it because that won't do any
[1:21:04] good now you
[1:21:06] know Jesus was not working himself into
[1:21:09] a place like this now I think I think
[1:21:12] it's I think it's something that maybe
[1:21:14] if you're going to pray for somebody or
[1:21:16] pray for a situation sometimes even
[1:21:18] going into certain meetings or prayer
[1:21:19] lines or whatever more there's just
[1:21:21] certain ways and even that even how I
[1:21:23] approach certain with services and
[1:21:24] things like that cuz you never know even
[1:21:26] right here you never know exactly what
[1:21:27] you're going to be dealing with but you
[1:21:29] notice that within this part of it where
[1:21:31] virtues itself would would actually
[1:21:34] would actually flow out to the people it
[1:21:37] was something that was present in his
[1:21:39] life in other words it was kind of like
[1:21:41] you know uh this you know these Outlets
[1:21:43] we got Outlets all along the wall you
[1:21:45] got Outlets electrical outlets right
[1:21:47] there you know those Outlets there's
[1:21:49] power right there in those Outlets all I
[1:21:52] have to do is take something that's a
[1:21:54] able to channel that and plug into it
[1:21:57] now you know I can't use a European plug
[1:21:59] on that I can't use the standards they
[1:22:01] use in in in Australia I've got all
[1:22:04] those different converters that I have
[1:22:05] to use when I go places but you know
[1:22:07] what there's electric that's there what
[1:22:09] I have to do is just tap into it and
[1:22:12] that's the same way it was with the Lord
[1:22:13] Jesus virtue was already there he didn't
[1:22:17] receive virtue to minister to that need
[1:22:20] but virtue was already there and let me
[1:22:22] just say this to you with virtue being
[1:22:25] in your life it isn't altogether many
[1:22:27] times that you necessarily feel
[1:22:30] something at that moment sometimes even
[1:22:33] a word that is actually being spoken
[1:22:35] even sometimes of laying a hand and
[1:22:37] shaking hands with someone else praying
[1:22:40] for someone else many times when here
[1:22:42] after praying for different ones my
[1:22:44] goodness it's just like it'll take it
[1:22:46] right out of you I feel just like a ragd
[1:22:48] doll it's more than sometimes even when
[1:22:51] I would preach it just virtue would
[1:22:52] leave you sometimes even with counseling
[1:22:55] the way that it would just leave in that
[1:22:57] moment and and man I'm just like a ragd
[1:22:59] doll call my wife talk to me talk to me
[1:23:01] talk to me help me get home you're just
[1:23:03] weak it's gone out of you it's virtue
[1:23:06] Why did Why was it me giving out virtue
[1:23:09] no it was needs within the people that
[1:23:13] was actually drawing and drawing upon
[1:23:16] that of the Throne of God it wasn't me
[1:23:19] but my weakness is because of that in my
[1:23:22] human body
[1:23:26] that's Hallelujah but I'm saying it in
[1:23:29] this way that sometimes that virtue it
[1:23:32] can flow we're not determining how it
[1:23:35] will
[1:23:37] flow sometimes I've been in situations
[1:23:40] that even that I wasn't even intending
[1:23:42] to
[1:23:43] go one time I went to sit down and to
[1:23:46] exchange and exchange a brother you know
[1:23:49] and take a brother and I S down and I be
[1:23:51] soon as I I wasn't even attended on
[1:23:53] going I was going to ask brother the
[1:23:54] bill Wen them uh because I was real
[1:23:56] weary I was going to ask them if they
[1:23:58] would if they would help me and and take
[1:24:00] him and when I sat down at that table I
[1:24:02] turned and I just all of a sudden after
[1:24:04] a little bit of talking I looked to that
[1:24:06] brother and I said brother how's
[1:24:08] everything going and as soon as I said
[1:24:10] that all of a sudden at that moment the
[1:24:13] tears just started coming he and his
[1:24:15] wife of some things that had just that
[1:24:17] they had just been going through I had
[1:24:19] no idea and but I realized at that
[1:24:22] moment this is why I'm here this is why
[1:24:25] I felt compelled to come here and you
[1:24:29] know at that moment when I sense that I
[1:24:31] just said Lord help me if it's just to
[1:24:34] listen help me be a good listener if
[1:24:37] there's a word that you want me to say
[1:24:39] Lord God I'm Available to You Lord but I
[1:24:41] realized at that moment it was a moment
[1:24:44] it wasn't that they didn't have strength
[1:24:46] but you know what we receive virtue
[1:24:49] travels through the body is that right
[1:24:52] just like those that we would pray for
[1:24:54] even as the word is being ministered
[1:24:56] it's virtue that's flowing through the
[1:24:58] body so this this is where the secret of
[1:25:02] how that this virtue would flow through
[1:25:04] our lives abide if you abide in me and
[1:25:06] my words abide in you ask what you will
[1:25:09] and it shall be done this is why the
[1:25:11] scripture would tell us that blessed is
[1:25:14] that man that doesn't set in the seat of
[1:25:16] the scornful he doesn't want he doesn't
[1:25:19] stand in the way of Sinners he's not
[1:25:20] there among the ungodly but he Delights
[1:25:23] in the law of the Lord L he meditates in
[1:25:26] it day and
[1:25:28] night and he shall be like a tree the
[1:25:30] Bible
[1:25:32] says amen that's planted By the Waters
[1:25:34] and the waters just flowing through it
[1:25:36] bearing the fruit of God in his season
[1:25:40] notice brother BR says it like this in
[1:25:42] the message the
[1:25:43] token and he just come through before he
[1:25:46] makes this statement and he's talking
[1:25:47] about when the life of God has come into
[1:25:49] your life it's not that of just a human
[1:25:52] being but you become a super super super
[1:25:55] human being because it's God's Own
[1:25:58] Strength operating through you and
[1:26:01] I anybody ever felt incapable yeah
[1:26:04] besides me anybody ever felt in
[1:26:07] incapable and we come into those places
[1:26:09] like that and you know what it's coming
[1:26:11] into a place if we can just realize it
[1:26:13] it's God us yielding to the strength
[1:26:16] that's within us that's strength that
[1:26:19] God has instilled within our lives and
[1:26:22] to and to just draw from that place to
[1:26:24] where you know what I may not know in my
[1:26:26] mind the answer to this right now but I
[1:26:29] know the God I know the god of the Bible
[1:26:31] I know the God of this message and I
[1:26:33] know what he's done in my
[1:26:36] life and that's a strength that's a
[1:26:39] source where we can draw from brother M
[1:26:41] says the life of God just flowing from
[1:26:43] you like Sparks from an anvil as you
[1:26:46] walk full of
[1:26:50] virtue and love and gentleness as the
[1:26:53] holy Holy Spirit moving and
[1:26:56] speaking one of the key things is is
[1:26:59] full
[1:27:00] of how many of you like me you have to
[1:27:04] go and you got to gas up every once in a
[1:27:06] while right I mean you know sometimes
[1:27:09] you could say how many times you got to
[1:27:10] gas up your truck depends depends on
[1:27:13] what depends on how many trips I make
[1:27:15] depends on where I'm
[1:27:17] going it's not an endless
[1:27:20] supply right I mean even with the the
[1:27:23] electric car the Teslas and whatever
[1:27:25] more what is about 430 some miles before
[1:27:28] you have to actually plug them back
[1:27:30] in so it's not endless and let me just
[1:27:34] say this to you or I neither when we
[1:27:37] look at it in our lives can we drift
[1:27:40] away from the presence of God and expect
[1:27:43] to have the virtue that's needed in our
[1:27:47] lives sometimes listen it is I want you
[1:27:49] to understand this you begin to
[1:27:51] recognize this virtue is not altogether
[1:27:53] about about you because this virtue that
[1:27:56] I'm speaking about is a is is that of
[1:27:59] God's strength that operates through our
[1:28:01] lives after we have been born again of
[1:28:04] the spirit of God and you know what it
[1:28:06] doesn't diminish it only grows greater
[1:28:10] in our lives the more that you and I can
[1:28:14] surrender but if we take the approach
[1:28:16] and say well I think you what thank God
[1:28:19] I mean God has done such a work in my
[1:28:21] life man I don't desire sin no more
[1:28:23] there ain't nothing nothing in the word
[1:28:24] of God that I wouldn't say Amen to but
[1:28:27] listen when the when life has come to
[1:28:29] you it not only has brought you to a
[1:28:32] place as a son and daughter of God but
[1:28:35] the prophet would preach the message
[1:28:37] that day on Calvary and he said I
[1:28:39] believe the church and he said brandom
[1:28:41] Tabernacle has forgotten that we are
[1:28:44] Sons and Daughters of God isin't it
[1:28:48] amazing because when Brandon Tabernacle
[1:28:51] first started out how the love of God
[1:28:53] was so thick among them and the prophet
[1:28:55] would talk about that but there was a
[1:28:59] drifting so much to where I heard the
[1:29:01] prophet here the other day he said it
[1:29:03] used to be when somebody would come to
[1:29:04] the altar to get saved he said oh my how
[1:29:07] the mothers would break up they would
[1:29:09] cry he said and now when one comes to
[1:29:11] the altar they sat there and chew chew
[1:29:13] and gum brandom Tabernacle he said
[1:29:16] what's happened they've got a away from
[1:29:18] hearing that still Small Voice you've
[1:29:21] got to stay in that place you see
[1:29:24] reality when this life has come to us it
[1:29:26] brings a burden upon your life to where
[1:29:29] the Lord what can I do for you Lord how
[1:29:32] can I reach others you see listen The
[1:29:35] Life of Christ does not come to edify
[1:29:39] selfishness it does not make us more
[1:29:41] selfish well I don't need nobody else
[1:29:43] I'm saved glory to God and going to the
[1:29:45] Rapture that is not how it's going to
[1:29:48] work it's something within our lives we
[1:29:51] we want to do something for somebody
[1:29:53] there's is a desire that moves in our
[1:29:55] life and yet Satan's desire is to so
[1:29:58] paralyze that part in our life to where
[1:30:01] we hear the preaching on the token and
[1:30:03] that is necessary without the token and
[1:30:06] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you'll
[1:30:08] never make the Rapture but listen when
[1:30:11] the token is come it is Christ that now
[1:30:14] is operating through your life and there
[1:30:17] is a flow of love there's a flow of
[1:30:20] gentleness there's a flow of virtue
[1:30:24] in other words if there's a flow that
[1:30:26] means there's got to be an inlet and an
[1:30:29] outlet God's holy spirit does not
[1:30:33] produce stagnant man-made
[1:30:37] cist is that
[1:30:39] right so he is now the strength of Our
[1:30:43] Lives he's our strength can I have just
[1:30:46] a few more
[1:30:49] moments so we didn't have last Thursday
[1:30:51] so we'll just try to put num just
[1:30:55] but I want you to think of this this
[1:30:57] word
[1:30:59] responsibility every one of us have a
[1:31:04] responsibility I have a responsibility
[1:31:06] to pray give myself to the word of God
[1:31:10] you do too I have it in a manner to to
[1:31:13] study there's responsibilities all that
[1:31:16] that I have but you know what I could do
[1:31:17] all of that but my personal walk with
[1:31:20] God I want you to understand me my
[1:31:22] personal walk with God is Not not all my
[1:31:25] studying all the studying that I do a
[1:31:28] man could study and study and study and
[1:31:30] be
[1:31:32] backsliding because he's not walking
[1:31:34] with a personal relationship with
[1:31:38] God can know so many things with
[1:31:41] scriptures and yet he's got himself so
[1:31:44] isolated away from the spirit of God
[1:31:46] what has God done that no it's where man
[1:31:49] himself failing to get in the presence
[1:31:50] of God but I tell you that that's our
[1:31:53] responsibility
[1:31:54] is to get into his presence and my
[1:31:57] responsibility is not to find something
[1:31:58] to preach I I don't go looking for
[1:32:01] things to preach but it's things that
[1:32:03] you can get into God's presence and all
[1:32:05] of a sudden there'll be something drop
[1:32:06] right here drop right here drop right
[1:32:09] there and God knows how to bring all
[1:32:12] that together even how he knows how to
[1:32:13] give you and I the wisdom and direction
[1:32:15] we need in our lives now watch this
[1:32:17] brother BM says it like this in the in
[1:32:19] the message Moses My Help Cometh From
[1:32:22] Above and I must stay in contact with
[1:32:27] God
[1:32:28] constantly if I expect to help someone
[1:32:34] else but say brother Samuel he was the
[1:32:36] prophet for this age that's true and he
[1:32:39] took that responsibility very seriously
[1:32:43] but you see where it lays before you and
[1:32:46] I I don't want to just do something in
[1:32:49] order to be a help to somebody this but
[1:32:51] it's recognizing the value of that
[1:32:54] relationship and it can be through your
[1:32:57] life that someone else would be touched
[1:33:01] by
[1:33:02] God let me just let me let me skip here
[1:33:05] let me just i' I've got to move ahead
[1:33:07] here to this to this
[1:33:10] point everybody
[1:33:16] okay I want you to think of this
[1:33:21] here and we look at virtue and I'll just
[1:33:24] close with this
[1:33:26] tonight brother Brown would pick this up
[1:33:29] here in the Statue of a perfect man and
[1:33:32] this virtue and how that it would go out
[1:33:37] flow out of the life of the Lord
[1:33:39] Jesus and you remember that within that
[1:33:42] statue of a perfect
[1:33:44] man here we have faith its virtue its
[1:33:49] knowledge its Temperance on up to the
[1:33:52] very Capstone himself
[1:33:54] this is this is what we're called to in
[1:33:57] this
[1:33:58] hour but yet it all begins with the new
[1:34:02] birth the prophet said without being
[1:34:05] born again it's just us trying to put
[1:34:07] in peacock feathers to a blackbird so it
[1:34:11] has to be him that does the adding our
[1:34:15] faith grows virtue grows but if you'll
[1:34:18] notice every one of those I wish I wish
[1:34:21] I would have put that up here tonight
[1:34:22] but every one of those those those
[1:34:24] points they don't grow
[1:34:27] independently it's all connected and
[1:34:30] based on
[1:34:33] faith It's all where faith and what is
[1:34:36] Faith it's
[1:34:37] Revelation faith is where there's its
[1:34:39] Revelation it's strength that's coming
[1:34:41] in to to to to that of the Church of the
[1:34:44] Living God it comes into that virtue and
[1:34:47] knowledge and all those things it works
[1:34:48] out in our life so it's not separate
[1:34:50] things that say I'm going to work on
[1:34:52] faith once I get Faith then I'm going to
[1:34:53] work on virtue and once I get virtue
[1:34:55] then I'm going to work on knowledge no
[1:34:57] no that's not how it is at all it's God
[1:34:59] working and bringing to pass all the way
[1:35:02] through your life because it's a
[1:35:05] continual growing in your life your
[1:35:08] patience
[1:35:10] grows your knowledge of God's word Grows
[1:35:15] Right Temperance which is self-control
[1:35:19] grows is that right brother Bram says it
[1:35:22] like this when he's talking about the
[1:35:23] the statue of perfect man and we look
[1:35:25] right here and we can see that that Lily
[1:35:28] that's over there and man how that Lily
[1:35:30] has had to struggle It Came from Beneath
[1:35:34] the
[1:35:35] pond what was it doing it was making its
[1:35:37] way up towards the light What drew it
[1:35:40] from the bottom of the pond what Drew
[1:35:42] you from beneath the muck and the gum
[1:35:45] everything that was around us it was the
[1:35:48] light and as we keep drawing going to
[1:35:50] the light what is it the light is
[1:35:52] quickening quickening quickening
[1:35:53] quickening until
[1:35:55] eventually we've
[1:35:57] overcome we're
[1:36:00] above that muck that we was born in and
[1:36:03] then as we come above that then here
[1:36:05] comes that Lily and what was the whole
[1:36:09] purpose of that Lily remember the the
[1:36:11] the scriptures would tell us consider
[1:36:13] the Lily and how that Solomon and His
[1:36:15] glory was not AR raid like one but
[1:36:19] notice it's it it speaks of that life
[1:36:22] that has come forth and then when that
[1:36:25] life has come forth look now there is a
[1:36:29] source for those bees butterflies others
[1:36:33] to draw from Brother Bram says I wonder
[1:36:36] he said what if that bee would come
[1:36:38] around to that Lily and the Lily would
[1:36:41] say insufficient
[1:36:43] funds brother BR said what if it would
[1:36:45] when some would come to us and he said
[1:36:48] they want to draw upon
[1:36:50] virtue and it comes back insufficient
[1:36:52] funds
[1:36:54] there's got to be virtue and brother BR
[1:36:57] says with that virtue he says he had
[1:37:00] virtue talking about the Lord Jesus to
[1:37:02] give to the people so it wasn't just he
[1:37:04] was just you know getting a warehouse
[1:37:06] and he was a walking Warehouse of virtue
[1:37:09] that's not why virtue was present in the
[1:37:13] Son of
[1:37:14] God that virtue was to be given out the
[1:37:19] purpose of that Lily is to give forth
[1:37:22] its life it's not for everybody to come
[1:37:25] around and say man what a beautiful
[1:37:27] thing yet we do we look at that my how
[1:37:29] beautiful that is but that's not the
[1:37:31] purpose the purpose is that it would
[1:37:34] have
[1:37:35] virtue in order to be able to give out
[1:37:37] to
[1:37:38] others brother Bram would say it like
[1:37:40] this he says
[1:37:41] look if he had virtue to give to the
[1:37:45] people he expects us to have virtue to
[1:37:50] give to the people if he had virtue he
[1:37:54] expects us to have virtue to give to the
[1:37:58] people is that right Bible said not only
[1:38:01] they shall lay hands on the sick they
[1:38:02] shall recover but sometimes it's even
[1:38:06] the words that would be
[1:38:08] spoken sometimes it's through things as
[1:38:10] we've been looking at friends when we
[1:38:13] talk about the word being made
[1:38:17] manifest sometimes there's things that
[1:38:19] get lost in that what does that mean
[1:38:22] when the word is made manifest well sure
[1:38:24] it's God's life on display but God has
[1:38:27] so many different avenues that that word
[1:38:30] will work right through and you know
[1:38:33] think about it when you look at how that
[1:38:35] in job's life job was a man who was a
[1:38:38] man of the word right he he read the
[1:38:41] Bible the Bible in the heavens he didn't
[1:38:43] have a written bible but he had that
[1:38:45] which was wrote in the heavens but he
[1:38:46] had Revelation from God and he was
[1:38:49] standing on his burnt offering is that
[1:38:52] right yeah amen but that which was
[1:38:55] working in job's life it was not
[1:38:58] something that was just kept for
[1:39:01] himself job was a man that virtue
[1:39:06] traveled through his life not just when
[1:39:08] he was in the pull pit not just when he
[1:39:11] was under that anointing as the prophet
[1:39:14] of God and receive that
[1:39:17] inspiration but through his life there
[1:39:19] was virtue that was given to others look
[1:39:23] at this
[1:39:24] scripture in job 29: 11 when the ear
[1:39:29] heard me this is job
[1:39:32] recalling these events in his life then
[1:39:35] it blessed me when the eyes saw me it
[1:39:38] gave witness to me because I delivered
[1:39:41] the poor that cried and the fatherless
[1:39:44] joob how did you deliver them how did
[1:39:47] you do that it wasn't me but I was
[1:39:51] available and there was one
[1:39:53] that was crying that was in need maybe
[1:39:56] they were in villages far away maybe God
[1:39:59] revealed what they were praying he was a
[1:40:01] prophet but then again maybe he didn't
[1:40:04] and it could be that job was just in the
[1:40:06] right place under the leading of the
[1:40:09] Holy Spirit and he would speak right
[1:40:11] there at that moment or that expression
[1:40:14] that would be given at that time and it
[1:40:16] would be God answering prayer you know
[1:40:17] what would be important it's not only
[1:40:19] for
[1:40:21] job to be yielded to God
[1:40:24] but how important it would be for that
[1:40:26] one that was in need be able to
[1:40:29] recognize when God was speaking to
[1:40:32] him you know friends one of the things
[1:40:34] that to me I Marvel many different times
[1:40:36] and we need God's grace in this CU
[1:40:39] sometimes sometimes it can be like
[1:40:42] throwing a life raft or throwing a lifes
[1:40:45] saer to
[1:40:46] somebody God's throwing throwing
[1:40:48] throwing throwing throwing and instead
[1:40:51] they just keep rejecting it no I don't
[1:40:54] want that I don't want that and yet and
[1:40:57] yet it's God reaching
[1:40:59] out listen don't look at vessels look at
[1:41:03] what God's speaking look at what God's
[1:41:06] given to you don't reject his help don't
[1:41:09] reject strength when it's coming to
[1:41:11] actually bring us from situations and
[1:41:14] and give us strength within our lives
[1:41:16] listen when I think of this this part
[1:41:18] right here of virtue I don't just look
[1:41:20] at this as a pastor I look at this as a
[1:41:22] husband I look at it as a father God did
[1:41:25] not Place me where he's placed me by
[1:41:27] accident but God helped me to be a
[1:41:30] channel that's available for virtue to
[1:41:32] travel through Let There Be virtue that
[1:41:35] would travel through to my brothers to
[1:41:37] my sisters whatever need there might be
[1:41:39] if it's something that arises in the
[1:41:41] home another brother another sister Lord
[1:41:43] let my life be that we're like them bees
[1:41:48] on that before where those bees can come
[1:41:50] and
[1:41:50] draw and can receive something
[1:41:53] from
[1:41:55] god let's
[1:41:58] stand let me read this last last
[1:42:02] part and him that had none to help him
[1:42:06] the blessing of him that was ready to
[1:42:09] perish Came Upon me and I caused the
[1:42:15] Widow's
[1:42:16] heart to sing for
[1:42:19] Joy job how did you do that well it
[1:42:23] wasn't
[1:42:24] me but it was God through
[1:42:29] me that's what that is that's a
[1:42:31] testimony of virtue flowing so when you
[1:42:35] think about this scripture that we've
[1:42:37] read here tonight how savest
[1:42:40] thou him that hath no
[1:42:44] strength well there's not one of us that
[1:42:46] has the ability to save someone else but
[1:42:51] there is a strength and there is a
[1:42:52] source that God has given us Grace to be
[1:42:55] tapped into and let me say friends if
[1:42:58] you're not tapped into it tonight
[1:43:00] there's no greater time to get tapped
[1:43:02] into it and it's to recognize Lord I
[1:43:06] need your strength I need your strength
[1:43:08] in my own life I need that strength of
[1:43:11] the word to be living in my life and
[1:43:13] just take the leadership that God has
[1:43:15] given right now through his word
[1:43:18] tonight brother bam talked about that
[1:43:20] Lily in that last little part he said
[1:43:22] that that Lily he said it must be
[1:43:26] drawing every minute of the
[1:43:31] day every minute of the day now what
[1:43:34] does that mean does that mean that every
[1:43:36] minute of the day you have to be on your
[1:43:37] knees does that mean that every minute
[1:43:40] of the day that you have to have a tape
[1:43:42] plan does that mean every minute of the
[1:43:45] day you have to be reading the word of
[1:43:47] God no but you give yourself to it and
[1:43:49] let me just say this whatever we give
[1:43:51] ourselves to it actually to create an
[1:43:55] atmosphere around our
[1:43:57] lives if you're not careful you get on
[1:44:00] too much of a string of YouTube videos
[1:44:02] it creates the atmosphere around your
[1:44:04] life there's things that all of a sudden
[1:44:06] it goes from watching this to this to
[1:44:08] this to this and all of a sudden it
[1:44:10] everything that we take in creates an
[1:44:14] atmosphere sometimes even just if you
[1:44:16] get into looking at the news very much
[1:44:18] and looking at this and this and I mean
[1:44:20] you're looking at this happen and this
[1:44:21] happened and you wonder sh can I go
[1:44:24] anywhere I mean is it safe to go to the
[1:44:27] mailbox sometimes the atmospheres it's
[1:44:30] by what we take
[1:44:32] in that's what's really important in our
[1:44:35] life is that
[1:44:37] atmosphere I say Lord let us be full of
[1:44:43] virtue but I don't want to be a I don't
[1:44:45] want to be a storage I want that virtue
[1:44:47] I want an inlet and an outlet and so
[1:44:51] every moment of the day when we're
[1:44:52] walking
[1:44:54] daily daily praying reading giving
[1:44:58] ourselves to the message things that
[1:45:00] even right here tonight after a service
[1:45:02] like this where God has planted courage
[1:45:04] in our hearts to take that word and
[1:45:07] water it with Thanksgiving with
[1:45:10] prayer let's
[1:45:12] pray Heavenly
[1:45:16] Father Lord
[1:45:20] Jesus that part Lord
[1:45:24] of yourself Lord that
[1:45:26] you
[1:45:29] desire that that life Lord would flow
[1:45:32] through our lives to
[1:45:36] others I than Lord
[1:45:39] just sometimes Lord we're so un we're
[1:45:41] we're
[1:45:42] unaware sometimes it's the things that
[1:45:44] are
[1:45:46] said sometimes Lord It's the
[1:45:50] expression I wonder
[1:45:53] when job said he caused the Widow's
[1:45:58] heart to be with
[1:46:00] joy you know the Bible tells us in the
[1:46:03] Book of
[1:46:04] James to visit the
[1:46:08] widows I wonder why it would say it like
[1:46:11] that Lord why would James why why would
[1:46:13] you allow that to be included Timothy
[1:46:17] Titus many of them is like James
[1:46:19] pastoral letters
[1:46:24] and to think Lord God that when someone
[1:46:26] would
[1:46:28] lose their companion their best
[1:46:30] [Music]
[1:46:32] friend one that they've walked with Lord
[1:46:34] for years through
[1:46:36] life and that one Lord has went ahead of
[1:46:38] them to the other
[1:46:41] side oh there's comfort in knowing where
[1:46:45] they're
[1:46:46] at they can pull from those
[1:46:49] memories that they have
[1:46:54] but there's
[1:46:55] times where they don't have someone to
[1:46:57] sit down with and have coffee
[1:47:01] with to sit down after maybe a time of
[1:47:05] an
[1:47:06] evening where where the convenience was
[1:47:08] there to sit right down maybe maybe she
[1:47:12] was sitting over on the chair or he was
[1:47:13] sitting on the chair she was on the
[1:47:15] couch whatever but they would have that
[1:47:17] Fellowship
[1:47:20] together Lord Jesus
[1:47:25] help us
[1:47:27] Lord help us to be sensitive
[1:47:31] Lord I'm asking you Lord for once again
[1:47:34] help us Lord not to get so caught up in
[1:47:37] our own little
[1:47:40] [Music]
[1:47:43] world help us
[1:47:45] Lord each Lord each of us press face
[1:47:49] pressures
[1:47:53] greater now than than it's been and it
[1:47:56] won't get any lesson any
[1:47:59] easier but Lord I believe the things
[1:48:01] that you're encouraging
[1:48:04] us is not only to pray for one
[1:48:07] another but to realize Lord
[1:48:10] Jesus of that virtue
[1:48:13] that you Lord God have placed in our
[1:48:17] lives and that we would be drawing from
[1:48:21] you surely Lord there's got to be an
[1:48:25] outlet there's got to be an outlet
[1:48:28] Lord
[1:48:30] father may we not be like a switch on
[1:48:33] the wall that has a short in
[1:48:35] it may we not be Lord God like an outlet
[1:48:39] on one of these walls that maybe Lord
[1:48:42] God some wire has been Jarred
[1:48:45] loose but I pray
[1:48:48] father may we lord be available
[1:48:51] [Music]
[1:48:53] and ready if I can say it this way
[1:48:57] welcoming reaching out Lord
[1:49:02] God lord
[1:49:04] Jesus I think as you stood there in John
[1:49:07] 6 I've always marveled at that
[1:49:09] [Music]
[1:49:12] scripture for Lord God As you stood
[1:49:14] there speaking to that woman at the
[1:49:18] well when the disciples returned back
[1:49:23] they had went to get as your Prophet
[1:49:25] called it viddles food to eat and when
[1:49:28] they came
[1:49:31] back they
[1:49:33] found what had taken
[1:49:36] place and they offered you meat to eat
[1:49:41] it wasn't that the natural man was not
[1:49:44] hungry but you spoke at that
[1:49:48] moment I have meat
[1:49:53] to eat of that you know not of and my
[1:49:57] meat is to do the
[1:50:00] will of my
[1:50:04] father Lord
[1:50:08] sometimes where the word is put in
[1:50:10] action in our
[1:50:13] lives it's not just us taking in taking
[1:50:16] in taking in that's all very important
[1:50:20] Lord we must give ourselves to you
[1:50:24] but father that other part of the will
[1:50:28] is to do the will of
[1:50:30] God help us
[1:50:31] [Music]
[1:50:35] Lord help us Lord to remember our
[1:50:39] purpose and our
[1:50:41] calling we don't have to try Lord in
[1:50:44] some way to save somebody whe they're
[1:50:46] going through the depth of trial or the
[1:50:48] hardness of trial but Lord sometimes
[1:50:51] it's just to be a good l
[1:50:53] Len sometimes it's just to be right
[1:50:55] there and say I'm praying for
[1:50:58] you Lord I look across this congregation
[1:51:01] tonight there's a number of brothers and
[1:51:05] sisters that normally they'd be sitting
[1:51:07] right here tonight
[1:51:10] Lord but father for whatever
[1:51:13] reason
[1:51:15] sickness maybe some discouragement I
[1:51:18] don't
[1:51:19] know but father I'm asking Lord God that
[1:51:22] not Not only would you touch
[1:51:24] them but may you touch
[1:51:26] them through our lives
[1:51:29] Lord whether it's
[1:51:31] text card call whatever it might be Lord
[1:51:37] as your
[1:51:38] body May the virtue of almighty
[1:51:43] God may we lord God give the right away
[1:51:47] may we draw from that virtue
[1:51:49] Lord may we draw from you that's that's
[1:51:52] the only thing that we can give to
[1:51:53] anybody Lord that would be of any
[1:51:58] value help us Lord I
[1:52:01] pray may we not neglect our
[1:52:04] responsibility our post of Duty Lord but
[1:52:07] help us Lord as Sons and Daughters of
[1:52:10] God help us
[1:52:13] Lord help us to receive Lord from
[1:52:16] [Music]
[1:52:17] you help us Lord I pray help us Lord to
[1:52:21] be able to receive
[1:52:23] from one
[1:52:26] another Lord God like your Prophet would
[1:52:28] talk
[1:52:29] about if there was certain amount of
[1:52:31] money that was
[1:52:32] offered he said you wouldn't pay no
[1:52:35] attention to the man that was given it
[1:52:39] you would simply look at what he had to
[1:52:42] offer and he would tell us don't look at
[1:52:45] the man standing in the pull pit he
[1:52:47] would speak of
[1:52:49] himself but look look to him who I'm
[1:52:52] trying to point you
[1:52:53] to Lord
[1:52:55] God grant it Lord may your presence just
[1:52:58] sweep right down
