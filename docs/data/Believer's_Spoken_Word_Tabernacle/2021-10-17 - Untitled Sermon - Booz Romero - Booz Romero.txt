heavenly father as we lift up our hands to you lord this morning just want to give you thanks for this time this opportunity lord that we have to be in your house lord thank you for your children that have made the effort to be here lord and as we always say father it is not to hear the man that is ascending before them but is to hear the god that is going to be speaking through that man that is before them father father help me to stay step out of the way and may you bless your children by the preaching of the word lord and if there is any need if somebody feels rejected somebody feels depressed somebody feels anxious about things father made through the preaching of of the word lord as that centurion said lord just speak the word and my servant is gonna be made whole father so that's our desire that if it is just one word coming from you lord we are gonna be okay this morning we love you and give you thanks for this time of fellowship lord bless our brother samuel laura as he's preaching bless him lord use him for your glory lord and as we're here lord as uh mortals like doing an effort lord but you you are the one that gives the strength father we love and give you thanks we commend our lives in your hands in the reading of your word lord we know that your word is already blessed so now just help us to say the right thing help us to be used by you father that's my desire that's my purpose that's my goal to be here this morning we love and give you thanks in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen god bless you this morning is certainly a privilege to be in the house of the lord if you have your bibles thank you musicians if you have your bibles we can go to the book of ephesians uh chap the first chapter verse 7 and verse 8 and also the book of book of 2nd corinthians chapter 4 verse 7 and through 9. so if you have it you can say amen so the word of god says in whom we have redemption through his blood and the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he had abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence now in the book of second corinthians chapter four and it read reads like this but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellent excellency of the power of the power may be of god and not of pops and then it says we are trouble on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair we are persecuted but not forsaken we are cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus that the life as of jesus might be made manifest in our body amen you may have your seeds uh i greet you all in the lovely name of the lord jesus christ this is it's a privilege to be once again here i think last time i was here was in 2019 so it's a little bit kind of quite the time you know but we are so um it is i always consider this a privilege to speak to you and consider your pastor as a good friend of mine and i remember since i met him back in 2000 i was it was 2012. wow it's crazy back in 2012 when i was i first met him and i first just moved to the states and i didn't know where to go what church to go and everything and your pastor was i i remember i came to visit and with brother i don't know where brother bill is uh brother bill sister mary they were always very welcoming so and i'm so grateful that that friendship like throughout the years there's still that confidence that we can come and speak to you even though he's not here but he's he knows that we're going to say the right thing or he and as i was saying in my prayer is not even the guy that is or the or the minister that is in front of the congregation but we have to just step out of the way and let the lord have his way amen so i'm grateful to be here and also grateful that my wife is here with me this morning and uh we're just uh blessed you know we are a blessed people as we're reading here you know we are distressing in all ways we are we are perplexed but we are we're not on despair you know you you may you maybe as the song says you may be you you can always be brought down but net or like low but will never be brought down amen because that's his promise you know you can go through the greatest temptation through the greatest tribulation in your life but everything is for a purpose in your life and at the end of the day is gonna be for his glory amen so this morning by god's grace you know i kind of like this week in a couple of weeks ago when your pastor texts me i was like well you know i know what i'm gonna i'm gonna be speaking but then my pastor also texts me hey can you take a service so i took one serve like this wednesday past wednesday at our church and then on friday night we had the youth meeting and now we're here but like you know when when you study then you're like okay i'm gonna be speaking about this yes lord i'm following your leadership but uh even yesterday night i was like yeah this is this is gonna be what we're gonna be talking but then all of a sudden like uh yesterday night and this morning the lord like you know that's kind of gonna be the topic but maybe you're gonna bring it in a different way so i just pray that if uh not native but this is the lord and i just trust that we are going to be blessed by the preaching of his word amen so we're just so as i said is it's good to be here amen and when you know as always i always said it as david said it i was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the lord so i'm hoping that you are glad to be in the house of the lord you know after so many things restrictions and the spirit of the hour and everything that we still have this privilege to be in his house amen and you know there are other places where they don't have this this opportunity as we have this morning but we can still rejoice that we have this for sure you know the time will come when the doors will have to be closed down and everything but in the meantime in this time we can say you know what i'm i'm glad to be here so with that mindset with that desire in our heart this morning let's have church this morning amen amen so also in the book of leviticus chapter 25 uh verse 54 sorry and and and he here is talking and if and if he is not redeemed during these years and by these means then he shall go free in the year of jubilee and he and his children with him amen so uh before we we kind of enter into business here uh the prophet of god says if if you can believe now to achieve anything you have to set a goal and say this i believe and tie yourself to that and keep drawing from that keep moving moving up to or closer to it knowing that there is a goal knowing that there is something where you want to go amen and that there there is out there is something that that that you are coming to amen and then i like this he he's talking about this little guy that there was uh these men that came and asked him so what are you holding son and he's like i'm holding my kite and then he says well i don't see nothing but a string and he said well there is a kite on the end of it and his the men look at him and say i don't see the kite i don't see no kite and the little was saying neither do i but he says well how do you know you got a kite and he says because i can feel it talking at the end at the end amen so well that's the way faith that's the way faith is faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things that you cannot see and as long as you set your faith on those things and then anchor anchor yourself to those things then you're gonna come to it so if i can tell you this morning sometimes you cannot see some things clearly but if there is something that is pulling in your heart then then if somebody asks you well i don't see a change in your life but then you can say but there is something in my life that is changing there is something at the end on the other side that is pulling i'm hearing from my theophany this morning i'm hearing from my theophany every day amen no matter if you can't see it or not you know they it is there anyhow it is pulling you every day that's why you're in church this morning that's when you come to church every day that that there is an opportunity to be in church why because there is a pulling inside of you because there is if there is a negative which we are the negative there is the positive that is hey is saying hey go to church hey fellowship you are gonna be around the right fellowship that's right that's right amen amen and any man that's ever done anything worldwide he has set a goal and and then he's persistent about and he about it he's persev perseverant about it and then that becomes a great man and if we think about a great man this morning that was our lord and savior jesus christ when he came he had a goal he had a purpose and the purpose was that he wanted to be and that or the purpose that he was sent to was because he was gonna give his life for us that this morning we can be partakers of that divine nature that this morning we can we can be by partakers or beneficiaries of that redemption we can be beneficiaries of that restoration in our lives how many this morning could testify and say i am a fruit of that that i was deep in sin and in in transpasses and everything in shortcomings and everything but he reached down his hand for me and set me free and brought me to his house and he set his table before me and his banner over me is still love amen amen hey that's good sorry you know you need to start and i don't like to do this but i will have to take off my coat i always say it it's like the uniform you know you go there and just like go like this like a soldier you don't want to move you don't want to lose your posture post posture or whatever how you say it but anyway may everything be for his glory and you know many times we have heard and and this is what i would like to i would like to title this morning the greatest work god's greatest greatest work in this last day and as we have read already there about redemption so we let's talk about the work of redemption this morning and uh if you go to the book of leviticus chapter 25 verse from verse 23 through 2055 through verse 55 there you're going to see all the different types of or like all the the the laws of redemption for the children of israel amen in in in verse 49 it says or his uncle or his uncle's son they may redeem him or anyone who is near or of kin to him in his falling in his family may redeem him or if he's stable he may redeem himself but those he shall reckon with him who bought him the price of his release shall be according to the number of years from the year that he was sold to him until the year of you believe it shall be according to the time of a higher servant for him and then verse 54 it says and i really when i was reading this scripture i was like well this is just great because if he is not reading during these years and by these means then he shall go free in the year of juventu so even though that person could be still still a slave to until the year of uvali it wouldn't really matter at the end of the day he was going to be set free anyways but then he was he had to come to the year of you believe but also he and his children with him so the work of god is not just like you know god jehovah is a god that loves his family so when we're seeing this is like when he does a pr when he has a purpose or redemption for his children he's not just redeeming the father he's not just redeeming the mom but he's like that's what he here he is telling us when they are with him this is redeemed the father and his children with him so if tonight if this morning you have someone in your heart that is not following the lord guess what there is a promise here that says that you and your children can be redeemed that you and your children can go to the year of your belief and let me tell you one thing we are not waiting for that year of you believe we are in that year of you believe what is that year of you believe is a year of freedom when the word was sent to us when you receive our lord and savior jesus christ what did that do to your life it set you free amen i'm not i'm not i'm no longer as we're seeing as a slave of uh to sin i am a child of god and when i became a child of god that was my year of you believe amen and if you have not experienced that year we believe this morning i invite you this morning to say lord where is my 50 years of jubilee you cannot be living under bondage anymore you cannot live you cannot be living on under your past sins you cannot be living on their depression you cannot be living again still under anxiety or under lost or under pornography or under whatever desires where in the past you can't if you have come into the year of you believe amen because that's his promise you go free in the year of you believe you go free in the year you believe if you're not free this morning i invite you to to say lord where's my jubilee the kinsman redeemer the word uh it comes from from a word it's called goel and it's used to indicate both the redemption and needs to do free by paying something and the redeemer the one who pays who was doing this work our lord amen and what is redemption is it is the act of buying something or paying a price to return something to its original possession or its original position that's what the word of god is doing with the children of god this day when you have received his word it is bringing you back to your inheritance it is bringing you back and and placing you as children and daughters as sons and daughters of god that's what this is that's what the greatest work in these days is happening and the bible says that it will be so simple that if i will tell you about it you wouldn't believe it that's why people can see your life and say you you i say yes me because it is a simple word i was listening brother and i was talking about god hiding himself in simplicity he's talking he's like and people will kind of they they cannot see it because it is so simple that's what when they see your life and they were like well you used to do the hat you used to be a drunkard you used to hit your wife you used to kiss your husband too and then when the change comes that's what people is like i don't believe well as nathaniel said philip nathaniel come and see come and see and now you can tell people come and see the greatest work in these last days the greatest work in this lifestyle see is not a it's not a building it is a group of people that is coming and that is walking according to the word of god and that is being set free every day how many can experience that or have experienced that that sometimes in the morning you may wake up with such burden in your heart and you don't know why and all of a sudden you just pray and say lord i don't know what is this but please help me and set me free and what is the lord doing he comes and set you free that is the greatest work he is the greatest the greatest emancipator that has come and has set us free amen and we remember about you know a when when when it was a time for of the emancipation and and and the younger guys the younger kids they went up to the mountain right the younger ones went up to the mountain and then the older ones to stay here below and then the the women and the children stay in the middle and then when they say that when they saw the sun they say we are free and then they told them the mothers and the children we are free and then they were telling the ones the the older ones we are free what can you say this morning when the son of righteousness have come to your life that you can say this morning i am free i am free from all sin from all transparencies from all my past from all my future because now it belongs to him amen amen sorry i may be excited what is redemption it is the act of buying something or paying a price to return something to its original possession and position i don't know if somebody here have experienced that you know like you bought a house and all of a sudden there is a foreclosure and then you're you're kind of kicked out of your house but then all of a sudden someone said you know what your family maybe a family member say hey you know what i can pay that for you and then you pay me later and then guess what you are restored to your original possession but with christ we don't have to pay later he paid the price and as we as we know is he was paid he paid the price and he was up he paid him full he paid that price like the entire the the total price amen amen so now redemption is also a releasing is a releasing effect by payment of a ransom is a redemption is deliverance is liberation procured by the payment of ransom amen so and also when we're talking about redemption we can refer to three uh greek words that they refer always to redemption because redemption at the end of the day is is you know it could be uh the payment of of like for for the purchase of a land but also it could be the payment for for the releasing of a slave amen and also it could be a a a change in in in in locations amen so we're going to talk about it this morning the first one is the meaning to purchase is it is to purchase in the marketplace in ancient times it often referred to the act of buying a slave amen and in the word the greek word that we're referring to is is the work the word agoras is to purchase in the marketplace so if we just think a little bit about it it's like what what is the purchase in the marketplace you know and if you go back to the book of hosea in the book of hosea jose was given the the instruction and we will hear things like that these days we will be like uh that guy is kind of i think he's missing uh something there you know because hosea when he comes to them he and the lord told him go in in in in mary uh uh a person and and they were like really it was like the lord is telling me to do that and then he married her and then he had children with her and and it was just from the lord to show them that that is the house of israel how they were worshiping the the idols how they were worshipping bail and all of that but then out of that then he says but now you know they're she's gonna go back because you can marry her you like if somebody is not making a clear-cut decision before the lord that person can be when they good in church and then the next day they can be out in the world amen so what happened what happened with his wife and it says uh here in the book of hosea chapter uh second chapter verse 23 in it and it says and i will sow her unto me in the earth and and this is he the lord is talking through uh to hosea and it says and i will have i will have mercy upon her and that that had not obtained mercy and i will say to them which where not my people thou art my people and they shall say thou art my god amen that's us amen so he here who said hosea is representing that but then in hosea chapter 3 then it says then said the lord to me go yet love a woman beloved her friend yet an adulteress according to the love of the of the lord toward the children of israel we look to other gods and love flagons of wine but listen so i bought her to me four fifteen pieces of silver and for an armor a homer of barley and a half homer of barley and i said unto her thou shall have hide for me many days and thou shall not play the harlot and thou shall not be for another man so will i also be for thee what was happening here so now he goes back again and buys her but now he's paying a full price because at first it was just a marriage but now the second part here now he's paying silver for her so if you know the medals in the bible silver it it represents redemption so he's paying redemption for for her that's why when our lord was was was sold by judas he was sold by silver because he was a representation that he was paying for our redemption joseph was happened the same thing with joseph he was sold by by 15 or or 20 pieces of silver and it was also a representation of of the of of the greatest work of god on earth redemption amen so the beauty or or how i love this is despite all what she had done despite all the way she was living the lord still said i will have mercy upon you and i will go back and and and by you at the market amen and if we go to the book of romans chapter 7 the last verse it says but i see another law verse 23 it says i see another law in my members worrying against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members oh paul is expressing here wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death in other words now who can buy me who can pay the price for me because there is no one my thoughts every day every morning every night they are persec they are persecuting me wherever i go i cannot have a clear thought because i haven't been purchased but then he says and i love you know when you go and read your bible it's always placing the people in judgment but then if you read at the end it always brings deliverance to the people that's why you have to read the entire book because that's why a lot of people live under defeat because they like you know what this is what it says and then that's it you know i'm a wretched man but read the next verse it says oh but i thank god through jesus christ our lord so then with the mind i myself serve the law of god but with the flesh the law of sin but then it goes to romans eight chapter one and it in and it is it is gonna say here there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus in other words the ones that have been accepted the ransom for them the ones that have been received or have been a price has been paid for them who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit why because your body and your spirit still need redemption but your soul had already been redeemed in other words you are already reading amen but now we have to make our minds now we have to make our body to obey that redemption amen because that's how the lord works it's like it is not because a lot of people will say you know what they can receive the holy spirit the holy ghost in their spirit but then they go back and leave th the same unclean way but once they receive the holy spirit in their soul then even though their spirit will start will still try to go back and do the wrong things there is a greater law in their heart there is a superior something in their lives that they they will say no that is not right i'm gonna take the other direction amen what is that it's because they have been still in their lives until the day of their redemption what is the day of redemption we are living under that day this morning amen how many love him this morning now i love another one here and i was preaching canada a few a few weeks ago and i was preaching this and i just love this how the lord works you know genesis 38 and here speaks about talmud it speaks about judah you know what happened here if you read verse 38 37 of genesis and verse 39 of genesis it is speaking about joseph but there is a parenthesis there there is an interruption in time for someone to come here and and play some play a role here and that is that is tamar you know there was judah that he had three children he got two children and those children they didn't want to have seed of this woman and then she was sent back to her parents because it was like well we don't have any other children here any other the kind of that that could be your age meant but then what what what happened there then she was like well she just went up went back to her household but then all of a sudden she was told hey your your father-in-law's coming and she was like well if he's coming then he's going to bring my next husband the third one but what happened he didn't he didn't bring him because he was like he was not of age yet but then she what did she do here the same thing as happened with jose's wife she just kind of took all uh took off the the the her harlot i mean uh her her uh widow garments and then she put on on on on on the garments of a harlot amen and and then it says here and she and she cover her with a veil and grab herself and start in an open place which is by the way of tifna for she saw that shella was grown and she was not given unto him for wife she wanted to to to bring a seed uh through the through the uh for for judah amen but she like she couldn't do it by herself and that is what happened with our lives many times you know we want to bring the life of christ but it is not by ourselves there has to be there has to be the seed of god that has to come into our hearts so in order for us to be able to produce something amen and then when judah saw her he thought her to be a harlot because she had covered her face amen so then she was like you know what maybe we can be together no you know just talking in in between the lines we can be together and and and and and and then we should be okay because judah had her as a harlot right but she says that you know what before you do that uh judah i want something and she was like well i can send you a you know a goat or i can say you a kid from from the flock and she was like no give me a pledge and he says what flesh shall i give thee and she said thy sagnet by signet by bracelets and thy stuff that is in thy hand and he gave it to her and came in onto her and she conceived by him what was happening here she wanted to bring forth life there was the one that was the carrier of life of the same seed that she was supposed to conceive from and and that that is the way it happened but then there was a shout that came in the days of the voice of the seventh angel a shout that came with judgment against who i can stammer because they say she is pregnant she she has she she because she has not been faithful to her covenant but then when they come against her she says wait a second wait a second she says whoever is the owner of this staff whoever is the owner whoever has the authority whoever has the sickness who has have also the authority as well i am with child and what happened here judah was like well who's the owner of that that's me so what happened there there was a a redemption happening there because she could have gone to a to death or she could have died but she had a seed inside of her that jew that couldn't destroy why because it was the the seed of judah and it is the same thing we use we can make a play the role of a harlot many times but guess what inside of you there is a seat of the lion of the drive of judah and who is that is our mighty the mighty warrior our lord jesus christ when you were in in line to be killed what happened somebody else took your place amen they say that in russia they were killing those christians and and when they were all of them there is like they they were they were because they were confessing that they were christians and what happened there was all of a sudden one soldier that said you know what there was one that said i'm not gonna die i reject christ but there was one that took the the the the place of that one and say i'm gonna die with them that was our savior jesus christ as well when we were on death row he came and he took our place why because he loved us because he wanted to show us how more how much he love us amen and how beautiful is this that she didn't die and if you go through the bible this is the greatest work of redemption in the bible every single woman every single man how the lord was able or the lord forgave them from all of their trespasses all of their deceit he's saying he healed them from all of their diseases yes why because if we wouldn't be here then he couldn't be god why because god is so it's a word it's an object of worship and and if you wanted to be jehovah which is yahweh but with his the guy that the god that dwells with his family he needed to have a family but not just any any type of family a man she needed to have a family that has been ransomed a family that he has paid the price for them he has paid the price of redemption for them amen so that's why you know this parenthesis is beautiful how the lord works how many lives we have how many times we have had parentheses in our lives and all of a sudden you we you are going one way but the lord turns you another way and then you are like wow amen amen now the other word other word when we're talking about redemption it is always going it always say involves going from something to something else or going from one place to another place in this case it is christ freeing us from the bondage of the law to freedom in the spirit and to enjoy new life in him amen because you were deaf in death in sins and trespasses and then now you are living you are being seated as the book of ephesians says in heavenly places with christ jesus you can either be on one side or can be on the other side you cannot be in between amen that's the word is is called in greek exagoras and then the prophet of god says it is redemption that has two parts and redemption anywhere is out of something and into something and that's what makes redemption and then moses represented the law which brought them out of what out of egypt and joshua represented grace that took them into the promised land amen that's what we we have heard so many times preachers that say that joshua is the holy spirit that is positioning the believer in their position in christ amen we are you're being brought out of something into something another way is that the law and grace were two different aspects of gasp of god's command you know because people may say or may take you know the old testament was for for you know for the people of the old testament and now we just have to believe the new testament but that's not that's not true because it's law and grace they are always together amen you know the lord brought them out moses but joshua took them in you know now this is you know uh so we have we have in in our day we have come out of the world or out of the out of egypt out of the chaos and we are on our road to the promised land that's our time this morning amen out of something into something amen and when we talk about the law the law is is the one that brings us to recognize that we are wrong amen but it is that it is grace that forgives us amen the law has no hope of redemption amen when you are going to be just judged by the law there is no redemption just with the law there has to come grace because you know grace is greater than the law but they have to be together because one is going to say you are committing a fall you're making a mistake here but grace is going to bring you to the right path amen the law it doesn't have grace in it because law only points that you are a sinner but grace tells you how you can get out of it in other words the law is a policeman that put you in prison but redemption is the one who come or who can't that have come and had paid your price of have paid your fine amen now the only way back there you know is the law was added in in this i was studying about law and grace and one of the things that the prophet of god says that law was added to bring reconciliation to the people in other words to bring them uh at peace with god because now they could come every year and ask for the forgiveness of their sins and and then go in worship and then they come back can go back uh come justified but that was it it was justification there was no sanctification there was not a holy spirit but now we are living in the greatest work that is not just justification it is not just sanctification but now you're getting even more than that you're getting the law and you're also receiving grace because every day you know the enemy is going to come and bring a bad thought but what what is grace going to do in the name of jesus christ i rebuke you that is the grace of god amen you know if there wouldn't be the prophet of god says that there wouldn't be law if you will have you know the the where you have the the traffic lights and then if you didn't have a traffic light that would be a mess that would be a you know like traffic all the time why because everybody will try to do whatever they want but the the law was sent so that they that you could obey the red and the green and so on and so forth amen and so the brawl the the law it brought sin into your view you know because before that nobody knew what was wrong or was right because there was not sin because there was no law to say that there was sin because when looking came on love was added until the perfection came because they were under the law for so many years but then perfection came and then what was that it was freedom that's what when jesus came it was freedom and he he was like they were con you know you read the scriptures like they were condemning him for everything every single thing he was doing whether he he was eating eating with his disciples on on the sabbath day or whether he was they were they weren't they were not washing their hands uh or or he was healing in the sabbath day they everything was about the law everything was about the law but they were not seeing the fruits that he was bringing they were not saying that that men with with with the with the dry hand he was healed they were not seeing that that guy at the bethesda pool he he was healed he was walking they could they care more about about the law but what about the children of god how you see people when they come to christ are you still gonna see them through the law and they're still gonna see their their mistakes or are you gonna rejoice with them because now they have been received in the kingdom of god amen lord was sent to magnified sin and all his ordinance is just might magnify sin but yet that law didn't take away sin lord didn't take away sin it only brought a man to know that it what what that that he was living in sin can you imagine somebody telling you hey you're wrong but not telling you how to get out of your mistake that would be frustrating but by god's grace romans chapter 5 verse 20 it says but then law came in i'm reading from the amplified version to expand and increase the trespass imagine you say a lie law was coming to expand it and say it is a big lie making it more a apparent and exciting opposition but how blessed blessed be the name of the lord this is because where sin increased sin increased and abounded god's grace has surpassed it and increased the more and super abound when sin abounded grace was abounded more isn't that beautiful that when you had made a mistake and then grace came and it covered because that the super abundance of the lord it was grace were abounded more amen now we find that love keeps sleeping into the into the picture to point the vast extent of our sins but what what is happening here sin is shown to be white and deep but thank god his grace is wider and deeper still amen if you can take something out of this service this morning take that romans 5 20 when sin abounded gries up grace abounded more lord you paid the price for me lord you forgave my sins lord now i can walk in heavenly places in christ jesus amen the whole outlook changes sin used to be the master of man and in the end handed them over to death but now grace is a ruling factor with righteousness and as its purpose and its end is to bring in men to the eternal life because law was death grace is life how do we come through through to the father jesus says you cannot come to me if it is not true the father amen and that is only bringing us to what to eternal life to live amen and the scripture says that the law was having a shadow of the things to come you know it was it was bringing something but then you know you read hebrews chapter 11 and it speaks about daniel and if you think about it what daniel was able to do under the law what enoch was able to do under the law what moses was was able to do under the law how much more the prophet of god says if he was only living in the shadow of the atonement what would the christian church do today with the reality of the resurrection of the lord jesus christ where are we standing tonight friends you know if moses if abraham if all of them drew the law they were able to be witnesses of god how much more you that you are living under a magnified grace how we ought to live this morning amen it will make you to put on the full armor of god and the prophet of god says and be sure to bring the breastplate and the helmet and the shield and all those things why because paul was likening us to a soldier going to battle because you will still have to fight for every inch of your possession but guess what now is not under the law now it is something greater than the law the prophet of god says if law could produce that if law could could produce a daniel that would pray he regardless the the conditions of the day if loku produced an enoch that was changed his athens were changed how much more the grace of god in the christian today how to produce this morning what what is the reality of the blood of jesus christ should be producing in us this morning and if we can say this when we're not that letter we'll do that or at that letter we'll do that and then letter will produce that how much more the living christ that we have in our hearts how much more the resurrection strength and power and spirit of the lord jesus christ can produce in our lives when i was studying that was just rejoicing just to think about all the the the you know the gallery of those the heroes of the faith all what they were able to do but then in the book of heroes now paul is saying but like we have encompassed all that a cloud of witnesses but now he's talking about us what are we doing what are you doing with the grace that you have received this morning are you taking it as a disgrace or are you really taking advantage of it and are you really appreciating the greatest work that the lord is doing in our days amen amen in the other the other part of redemption it was also the the to obtain release by the payment of a price so if you if you read the book of jeremiah chapter 32. jeremiah he he is there chapter 32 verse 8. so he has he had a vision before this happened and he and he's waiting for that vision to come to pass and in that vision if he was told jeremiah your uncle uh son or your cousin is gonna come and he's gonna ask you to buy a field and you're gonna buy it because this this this this is for a purpose amen so in jeremiah chapter 32 verse eight it says so hannah mail my uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the lord and he said unto me by my field i pray thee that is in anatoth which is in the country of benjamin for the right of inheritance is thine that's when we were reading in leviticus chapter 25 it says that the uncle's son you can buy that um that that that that inheritance because that's why he says here and that because the redemption design buy it for thyself then i knew that it was the word of the lord and then what happened here and then i bought the field of hannah mail my uncle's son that was in anathat and weighed him the money even listen what he paid he paid 17 shackles of silver again redemption taking place here right but then a knight subscribed the evidence and sealed it and took witnesses and weighed him the money in the balances so then he says so i took the evidence of the purchase both that which was sealed according to the law and custom and that with was which was open so i want you to notice something here there was a pull a public copy in a silk copy of the contract amen and what we can say is like that that was an exact copy of his thoughts that were sealed so one was open and one was sealed amen but now if we bring this as our inheritance it tells us that the seals needed to be open so that we could see what was in the purchase contract it had to be sealed for an appointed time until an appointed time because what's in those seals when the prophet was sent to open those seals what was in those seals that was a redemption for us that's why when the after the seals were open it became a new book the bible became a new book because now when the seals open they reveal what was inside of there they revealed that what was inside of the contract they revealed what was in god's mind this is the appointed time this is the day that the lord has made let us be glad and rejoice in it amen this is the appointed time the lord opened the seals for us he and this this is what is happening with with jeremiah because this this was the time before he was going to go into captivity and the lord was preparing him to say by the time you come back you're gonna have a purchase you're gonna have a property here and you won't be without an inheritance and that's what the lord did with us you know when the seals were open now they were just revealing that we have an inheritance that we have at the authentic body that we can that we're gonna go back to a place where we were before the foundation of the world isn't that beautiful how the lord is hiding all these things here he's paying the price and if you see that's why when people say you know we're not living under the law anymore no we are fulfilling the law jesus said i have come to fulfill not just to fulfill the law but to magnify the law but even more than that when there was when seen abounded grace abounded more amen [Music] prophet of god says hanamel he wasn't his neck skin so that he know that the the enemy will hold the papers and support of this place but he knew that god will never forsake his people he knew that god will never leave you without an inheritance so when they come back and he might have a he had a right the right the rightful ownership for the inheritance amen that's how the lord prepared everything for us because we found ourselves without an inheritance but once you realize who you are now you realize that you are a child of the king you know as that is slave the prophet of god speaks when they brought him from africa he was in that plantation and i may have said this before but i love it what happened with this guy he came in and then and then he was eating the same he he was being treated the same the exact same way and then the the the the purchaser came in and he was like oh hey can you sell this guy he was like no do you feed him the same he's like yes do you give him beans in water yes and and that's it no more no fruit no no no no not nothing now we're very specific right gluten-free just i'll give you just a cup with water with ice that's free of everything and what happened with this guy he's like well is he gluten-free no he's not gluten-free he's not like the eggs have to be cage-free and pasture-raised and all of that he's like no no he it's exact same as the others so what makes him so so different than the others he's like well let me tell you something i had the same question but there was one time that i asked him so what makes you so different he said well let me tell you something i know that you brought him you brought me here as a slave but let me tell you something the place where i come from i am a child of a king [Music] what can you say this morning when the enemy is coming against you every day with every every device that he can what can you say but i'm still gonna be rejoicing and celebrating the victory that he's already given me and i'm still gonna say the place where i come from i am a child of a king and i am not a child of just a king i am a child of the king amen amen that's why when when when jeremiah is giving this this promise he's he's resting in that now he's like you know what now i can rest in this because when my people when they come back they will be able to go back and have an inheritance and what happened they he gave the evidence of the purchase onto baruch the son of neriah the son of messiah and the side of uh in the sight of hannah mel my uncle's son and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase before all all the hebrews in in that sat in the court of the prison and what does hannah mail mean the name of hamel it means the grace that comes from god it means the gift of god he's buying the gift of god and now he's telling the lord is now telling us come and buy freely without money we we without without nothing just come and buy freely amen prophet of god says glory to god sorry verse 14 of jeremiah 32 and this evidence which is open and put them in an earthen vessel that they may continue many days why in an earthen vessel prophet of god says glory to god i hope you will you could catch it do you see what god did he never revealed it to the highest and prudent so they could fuss about it all the time but he put it in an earthly vessel and he created himself his own son christ jesus so what was happening in the book of jeremiah it was just a type that there was one that had the seven seals that needed to be opened and that was an earth earthen vessel a simple one that people were like you are the son of joseph and mary how can you be called yourself the son of god but inside of him it was the lord it was god [Music] the prophet of god says in this last day now he's opening the seals and showing it to his church and he keep it in an earthly vessel so it would not kind of just rust hallelujah i mean he's like i know you think that i'm a holy roller but i just can't imagine how he will feel when the lord was opening the seals when the lord was showing them that it was christ the hope of glory now being among the people he this is this has been kept and wrapped in the vessel of the earth that was redeemed out of the earth amen so what happened in jeremiah's time when they go back they can claim their inheritance in your time in your day right now you can claim your inheritance because he hid all of this from the wise and prudent and he revealed it to the little ones and he's like yes because it was my pleasure to reveal it to them amen second corinthians chapter four verse seven through nine is what we read but we have this treasure in earth and earth and vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and although not of us that's what we were when you see the the third when you see clay it's very simple that's how the lord wants to keep things keep them simple the opening of the seven seals when we talk about the first pull second pull third pull all of those things are simple things that only his children are going to be able to get them because this is a simple a simple gospel amen now another example that you can look in the bible is is uh ruth amen so ruth she also went through a process of redemption she she also went through the greatest uh work on on her day amen and she was able to you know she renounced to her family she left everything that she had and and she came to a point where she was willing to be changed because she was like i want to receive that that you're talking naomi like it is it is not just like i just don't want to listen to sermons naomi i want to see who that boas is and she was converted she made a decision and and when you come to christ you have to make a decision you have to take your choice you want to go back to the things of the world or you want to go on with god but if you want to take the way with the lord's despise few hold on to god's unchanging hand amen amen what do we need this morning the prophet of god says we need real clean cut decisions god wants clean cut decisions out of his church he doesn't want you to be a wishy-washy well today i am redeemed yesterday i am not tomorrow i don't know no no no no he wants you to make up your mind and say i am redeemed this morning by the blood of the lamb he's already paid the price for me and i'm going forward with christ and as we said if drew is if under the law they were able to produce all those things how much more under this new new new gospel that we have received this bible this new book that we have received what we ought to produce this morning and you don't say lord if you bless me and do this for me or so or no no that's not a decision you don't come to christ with a condition you say god i don't care what you do with me i'll go anyhow if i die i will die that's what that's what ruth said wherever you go i will go your god will be my god your people will be my people where you worship i will worship where you submit yourself i will submit yourself where where you go to church i will go to church where you like to to your do you do yourself i want to die my to myself as well that was a clean cut decision and let me tell you i want to finish with this he's interested in you is interested in me and he is interested to see his word made manifest but in order for his word to be made manifest he is depending on us to do it because we are his agents nothing in ourselves it is him yielding ourselves and walking with him that's what he wants yield yield let yourself let your word be born in dementia of my life lord not not more of me lord as john the baptist says it is needed that i may decrease and he increase so he has to be it has to be the same position that we have to have this morning we have to die to ourselves every day you have to surrender to your own will to your own idea and you have to surrender it to the will and idea of the almighty god and that's finished let me just finish this one sorry you know you say i'm finishing and finishing but that somebody says that's when preachers are lying but let me just find this one this is what i wanted when a man has done something wrong his master sold him to slavery actually unto death and he is in the market he is a slave but a man comes along and a worthy man that is able to do it and find this man and find finds grace in his side he redeems this slave and that takes him from the slave marking market and takes him out of the out to himself but notice and that is slave slave once redeemed he can never be sold in the market again [Applause] amen he can never be sold again because now he has been marked and if he was thought enough of one time to be redeemed no one no one can ever sell him again for a slave so what does it say about this to us that once you were purchased by the blood of christ you cannot be sell sold in the market again because now you have been marked by the blood of jesus christ the prophet of god says thanks be to god that when a man has once come to christ and has been redeemed by the precious blood the devil can never make you a slave again how many are free this morning how many can say lord this morning i declare myself that i am free [Applause] now you are secure in the blood of jesus christ until the day of your redemption we we were talking there needed to be that there we needed to have a kinsmen redeemer he was our kinsmen redeemer he became me that i may become him by grace so he became a king with me that i may become one of his that's the greatest work that is happening this day how many can say i am redeemed by the blood of the lamb amen if the musicians can come and we can sing i am redeemed i am bought with a prize jesus has paid the whole price if anybody asked me just who i am just told them i am redeemed [Music] and now we can say there is no as we read in romans 8 there is no longer condemnation for them that walk according to god's desire they that are not walking anymore on the under the flesh or they are living in their sinful ways but now they are living a different life amen he has paid the price if this morning you feel that you haven't been redeemed or that you're still doubting that i invite you to build an altar in your heart and say lord if there are these questions these doubts in my heart i just want to bring them before you because i know that when you do a work you do a a complete work lord this is not a half way through work this is a full complete redemption work if we use our heads and we just want to stand up this morning use our heads heavenly father thank you for your word thank you for the greatest work that you have done in our day lord jesus as we said if people will will the scripture says that if people will ask or people it will be hard for them to understand that you are doing a simple work in our day lord and we are the beneficiaries of that work we're so grateful for you we're lord grateful for each of one of your children that we're uh able to make it this morning lord in that we're so uh supporting your word what you have for them this morning jesus we love you and we give you thanks father we just give you thanks for that redemption of our lives lord the greatest love story lord being unfold in front of our eyes lord the god of all eternity that he took everything that he was he everything that the father was came into jesus christ and now everything that jesus christ was now christ in us is now christ in us the hope of glory father thank you because

the marriages lord if he brings the loved ones that are not serving you it brings them back father [Music] we love you this morning we thank you father thank you for this time of fellowship in your
