========================================

couldn't fill moses's shoes that spot had already been filled but he was to carry the word over he was to be the one that would take the ministry of moses and reach the promised land with it right now there's so many so many things we can stop here but we want to want to get down to the end but when joshua realized he was walking in perfect harmony with god's word brother bam said he became fearless in his testimony when he was positionally placed and he realized i'm joshua this is my fulfillment this is the direction i'm going this is what i'm ordained to do brother ram said he became absolutely fearless in his testimony now now now when they came up to the to the river jordan there they we know the story and i mean i don't think anybody preaches on the old testament more thoroughly than brother samuel so i'm not going to tell you anything anything new but when they came up to the river jordan and they and they looked over there now 10 of them just saw giants but joshua and caleb saw something past the giants they were able to see past those giants and and and the other ones stopped there and all they could see was the wall of problems but but joshua and caleb were able to look over those giants and say there's a promised land over there there's there's a victory over there that's where we're supposed to be there's something pulling me over there to that promised land now for the other ten they couldn't help that they didn't have the vision of faith to see past the giants but joshua and caleb were ordained before the foundation of the world tens of millions of years before there were ever giants in the land they were ordained to overcome them it wasn't just it wasn't just i need to get over there but something was pulling them it was home it was where we need to be and i don't care how big the giant is that's where i belong over there you might as well just get out of the way now devil because i don't care how big you may look but i have eyes of faith to see past how tall you are and see that i'm supposed to be over there there is a promised land and i'm gonna receive the promise i can't speak for the other ten but for me i'm gonna receive the promise of that land over there by the ability to see through giants amen glory oh my what is that to a son of god absolutely fearless in his testimony didn't even question if we could overcome it didn't question how big they were amen joshua think about it he he worked in egypt building bricks and there the murmurs were in the wilderness well we should have just went back to egypt well they must not have worked very hard there oh it smells like garlic and onions i want to go back there and joshua said no no no no i've made too many bricks for the wrong pharaoh i've made too many walls for the wrong kingdom i'm not going to work for the wrong kingdom anymore but there's a kingdom over there that's mine where i am at home where i can build something where he has prepared a place for me to come and dwell that's where i belong now now joshua didn't question when they get across the river he didn't question how big the walls of jericho were now he's a brick builder he's a wall builder he knows the structural integrity of the wall and they could have chariot races on this wall and he thought my out of all the walls we built in egypt we never built one like that right oh my you think everybody around them thinking oh look that's never going to come down joshua didn't even question whether the wall would come down why because he was positionally placed to do it to perform the work that god had placed him there for amen joshua knew he was joshua so much so that he would draw his sword against the captain of the lord of the host and say are you for us or against us because if you're against us i'm going to cut you down right i know who i am and i know where my feet are planted i know whom i have believed in joshua was fearless in his testimony no question in joshua's life we're going over we're going over i'm not going back for onions i've tasted grapes the evidence has already come back we've already tasted of the land amen my god when you get positionally placed now maybe for some of our testimonies it comes a different way we might come along like brother gideon we might just be working in the field one day just frustrations rising up on every side and man i'm sick and tired of this i'm just tired of this job i'm tired of working i'm tired of slaving away i'm just they come and they steal it and they take it i'm tired of this sickness attacking my body i'm tired of my family wandering off i'm tired of of me always having to be the one to pull them back i'm just tired of this and you got to the moment of frustration brother graham said desperation produces a miracle and he got to that moment in his life he said if god before us then whereby are the miracles yeah and i can't tell you how many times i've been asked that question in the last couple years well if the message is true then where we are the miracles and i just love it when somebody asks me that because they don't know my testimony they don't know me or where i came from and how i used to just sit here on the front view like this brother and i was just a good hypocrite i could just sit here and yeah amen i knew right when to say it i knew exactly when i mean i grew up in church my dad was a pastor i just grew up and i would say amen hey man yeah once a while stand up and man everybody probably thought i was just the real deal but i knew on the inside there wasn't anything happening there was no life behind that i would go home and i would i know i lay down at night and i would know i didn't have what it would take if god would come tomorrow the real miracle is overcoming that spirit is overcoming this layout to see is overcoming what what we think is just church and some form of tradition or some ecclesiastical approach to this this is not a theology no man taught me this and and i had to go back and rewash everything that i thought i knew about the message about the bible when i really met the one who wrote it it all became a different book to me when i really met the jesus christ who produced the message then it all became something different to me it wasn't just a man came and he said these things and if you don't believe he's a prophet then you're you know and this and this you know how we do but when i met the christ that wrote the message that spoke through william branham that gave him the inspiration then it became something real in my life then there was an anchor there that would hold me down and then when i laid down at night i knew i would have the goods when the time came but there's that is a miracle that's taking place in this time yes don't let the enemy come in and say well where if god before us then where be all his miracles my friends we could go by and pass the mic one we won't but one by one testimony after testimony after testimony and you might feel discouraged in yourself but there's something about a victory that needs to be waived [Music] something about a victory that needs to be waved high it might just be a small testimony in your life but it could mean the world to somebody else that might have just been david had already david had already killed goliath but it was when he picked up his head and waved it then it rallied the troops that was the real testimony there if we could just look at what god is doing in our life not what he's done years past and we met him 30 years ago but today what is he doing today in our life he's the same god today producing signs wonders and miracles to be fearless in our testimony that nobody could stand in front of us right we could go down through the bible story after story and just take heroes of faith that were built for their position that were built for their time david was built for his time he was he was thought of by god before there ever was a kingdom for him to to to rule over before there ever was a heart for him to play right he was thought of by god to fill that spot brother braham says the same exact thing about david when david recognized his position he became fearless that's right absolutely fearless now we we look at that and we think well that's that's wonderful for a warrior but how does that affect me imagine what we could do if we could overcome every fear every fear every anxiety every pressure every opposition if we could get positionally placed in the body of christ we could become fearless the same promise i believe the bride is is there i believe she's rising up to that position where she's recognizing the devil ain't got enough that's right he doesn't have enough power he doesn't have enough force and he he's come at me with everything he's he can come against me with but he doesn't have enough to do it because i've been commissioned to overcome him in this age we could take paul the apostle and all the all the discouragements he had to overcome and and having to go back and rewrite his entire life when he finally met the one it was just i mean nobody could teach moses like paul nobody could teach abraham like paul he knew it in and out he knew the books and that was his whole life was spent studying it but he didn't know the one that's right who wrote the book he didn't know the one who was there on earth but when he met him on that road everything changed for paul everything became new for paul he was positionally placed and then look at paul's character being placed there nobody could shake paul from his place not even other apostles that walked and talked with him and ate with them they would come against paul paul said nobody can take this from me because i met the one i met him on the road he came to me when i wasn't looking for him i was persecuting his church i was killing his people and he came to me that's the god we serve when he's ready for us when he does the choosing he will meet us where we're at it doesn't matter how weak in faith we are it doesn't matter how discouraged we are it doesn't matter what we did yesterday when it's time for him to meet us he'll come to us and paul recognized that something greater than words on a page something greater than just these scrolls i've been pouring my life into i met the living person of jesus christ am i to think that paul's correct courageous spirit after that yeah you could lock him up you could put him in prison you could put a cease and desist order on his church you could tell him he couldn't have service there anymore you could tell them that they're coming to they're coming to kill you paul and he would still have church might think to preach like paul would preach and to preach with with such power and demonstration of the gospel not even not even knowing human body but he met the person amen martin luther was built for his age came into his time to oppose the greatest force on earth at that time amen built for it he was built to overcome that he was built to resist the catholic church he was built to resist it and they put a cease and desist letter now brother samuel if you show up to church and there's a cease and desist letter i mean if it were me i'm like well i don't know i don't know what i'll do but martin luther was built for that exact position to tear the letter off said we're having church i don't know if anybody else is going to come but we're going to have church he was built for that position we cannot take his place he was built for that place john wesley was built for his position i believe john wesley uh traveled over 250 000 miles in his lifetime preaching the gospel and this was before cars this was on foot or on horseback or by wagon 250 000 miles he went to preach the gospel he preached i think over 40 000 sermons in his lifetime amazing man of faith he was built for that right i can't have john wesley's spot but he can't have my spot either amen he was built to be a forerunner of this gospel he was created for that purpose peter cartwright was created for his purpose to come into a town and say i'm going to hold a revival in that town and no matter who comes against me i'm gonna have church in this town there will be souls won and and there will be people one to christ in this town you know peter cartwright we read that one story but in his lifetime he baptized over 12 000 people in the united states of america 12 000 people came to christ under peter cartwright's ministry he was built for that position now what are we built for now we're down to our time all right now we're down to our age we went through these other ages and and through the church ages god has placed men so perfectly so but now we're in the final age so what's our commission going to be it's going to be to win it it's going to be to fulfill all that those ages had promised would come there will be a fulfillment of those things and them which have been sawn asunder which have been pulled apart which have been burned at the stake which have been fed to the lions which have been which have been hung across which have been boiled in oil all those people that we can testify about cannot be made perfect without you this morning cannot be made perfect without this church this morning it's not just testimonies of men past but they're looking at you this morning saying finish the work which we started finish that gospel which we started run with this message that was preached that before time god saw us finishing this word [Music] you know brother brahm said we're given a greater responsibility than abraham than even enoch we're given a greater opportunity this morning we realize how perfectly orchestrated this is this morning he built us for this purpose ephesians 1 said blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated unto the adoption of the children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself my if there's a scripture that defines us it's that one right there what are we to do we are to fulfill the word we are to manifest the promises that before the foundation of the world i know we say that phrase all the time but we can just think about it and we can just think about the billions of light years that have gone on before us that have happened before he said let there be let there be we were already here and if we were already here then we already overcame it and we're over there if we could just look at this as just a little hickey of time but we're coming out of that hickey we're swinging out of that loop of time back into eternity where we came from amen i believe job recognized who he was i believe joe had a moment in his life where he had to look back and think well who am i anyway all right what is this all about why am i here who who who am i he recognized i was built on this rock and job had to think back past his spiritual amnesia and get back to the beginning i was there i was there when the sons of god shouted for joy that's where i was nobody can take my place because i saw myself over there i was there when they shouted for joy i know it because i see myself over there why when job got the revelation he was made for that moment what moment are we made for this morning i was there oh when we recognize who it is in front of us when we recognize what we've been presented with in this day it's not just tapes and books it's not just letters on a page it's not just powerful sermons it's not just it's not just men trying to trying to do something but it's god it's christ it's christ and his people in his body bringing forth the finish line amen amen i don't know i don't know how everybody else believes but i believe we're we're called to a higher age i'm not part of this laodicea i don't desire to be part of this leo to see i'm not i don't desire to be wishy-washy or lukewarm or cold or just maybe in church or maybe out of church or just to fill a seed i don't desire any of that but i desire to be on fire for god i desire to have a fresh fire with god every day that i know i know i know where i'm going when this is all over i know that in a moment in the twinkling of an eye when the last trump shall sound i will be caught up i will be caught up i will not taste to death because i know i've been positionally placed into the body of christ there are some standing here which shall not taste of death i believe that with all my heart it's not just a word on the paper but there are some in this building that shall not taste of death that no other church age could fulfill that paul could not fulfill that peter cartwright could not fulfill that john wesley cannot fulfill but there are some standing here that will never taste of death because we recognize our position in the body of christ there's not enough demons in hell that can stop that from coming forth coming into place recognizing your day and its message then if jesus defeated satan upon the faith of knowing who he was he was a predestinated creature are you ready what about the predestinated bride of jesus christ now you believe the bride is predestinated the predestinated bride of christ now the church the word seed with everything that god promised to put in the church in it right now it's in it now everything is in order the holy spirit has been given the seed has been sowed the evening lights has been shining the sign of sodom that jesus promised is here and malachi 4 a predestinated church and then he says oh devil oh devil the church of the living god here and on tape 2 do you know where you stand do you know that you were called of god that the holy ghost reigns in your heart and every word of god is real to you oh brother how is satan going to stand against that how is he going to stop that from growing how is he going to keep them signs from following it while you could throw them in jail they if you could i don't care what you do they done tried it they rotted in jails they was fed to lines they were sawed asunder they were jerk to pieces you can't kill it you can't kill this a church that's predestinated those who he foreknew like he did jesus he was called those who he called he has justified and those who he had justified he has already glorified predestinated you can't kill this move of god you cannot kill this church you cannot kill this message from going out you can come against it with every demon in hell but you cannot kill the influence of this message in this hour because it's predestinated to reach that last one and we will be caught up and changed even our mortal bodies changed to immortality in the moment of a twinkling of an eye you cannot kill it [Applause] you can throw me in jail you can ship me to another country you can lock the doors you cannot kill what god has spoken amen when we recognize what we are really encountering in this life it's not just uh it's not just god said in prophet but why did he send him what is he saying amen what was his message what what do you think he what think he yeah of this message right right what is it to you is it just something that you were born into and your parents believed it and it was good ethics and good morals and so but what is it to you amen what thank you peter that's good whom say ye that i am yeah and watch peter's life in one in one verse he says who who think he that i am peter who what do you say well some say some say the message is you know it's a false prophet and he missed it there you know he he caught up there and some say he was god and we worship him and we baptize in his name some say this and some say that but what do you say peter where do you stand amen and right there peter experiences a supernatural change i say that thou art the christ the son of the living god flesh and blood hath not revealed this unto you but my father which is in heaven hath revealed this to you and i say unto you upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it now look in the beginning of that verse he says simon barjona flesh and blood had not revealed this to you no school hath revealed this to you no no man hath revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven hath revealed this unto you and i say unto you thou art peter watch the change from one verse to the next he's simon barjona in this verse and then when he recognizes that he's standing in front of christ the son of the living god he becomes peter in the next verse and i say unto you that thou art peter and he got a name change just like saul did to paul when he realized he recognized this is christ in our midst this is not a man this is not some cheap legit magician's trick but this is christ and when he recognized it was christ he became peter and upon that revelation i will build my church when we can recognize that our name has changed from whatever we were born with whatever name we're called in this life it has changed to mrs jesus christ when we recognize it's him he's here it's not just a man but it's christ living touchable feelable walking amongst us he's here when we can recognize that we we change from simon barjona to peter and it's that revelation that i will build my church upon yeah to recognize we're not just in this walk to fulfill 70 years or no 60 years but we're set here in an eternal purpose and until god has completed that purpose there is no demon in hell there's no sickness there's no depression there's no suicidal spirit there is nothing that will stop that purpose from coming to pass because it was already thought of in god's mind now we're look we're talking about the eternal god yes sir the one who who he doesn't forget he doesn't forget his thoughts he's not he's not forgetful he doesn't think oh where did i where did i leave that thought where was that thought supposed to go but we're talking about an eternal god that created the heavens and the earth and he thought of you he knows right where you're at this morning he knows right what you're going through this morning because he's already thought of it before there ever was a trial to go through he already thought of this moment in time and he thought you an overcomer my i need a people that will go when that when the age is so dark when there's trials on every hand where there's sodom and gomorrah all around where there's depression all around when the gates of hell have lifted off the earth and their spiritual attacks on every corner i need somebody who will go and fulfill my word here am i lord here am i i'm unworthy woe is me but here am i lord send me send me let me fulfill that part of your word amen you can go oh my to think that god had confidence in us to send us to an age where nobody else could fulfill it but god hath perfectly ordained you to overcome in this age and they overcame it that's me yes sir and they me overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of my testimony i overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of my testimony i know where we're standing you can't stop it right you can't kill it you can lock me up i'll still preach the gospel yes i don't know there's an attack coming against the church or you know what's happened is his ministry has let down the bars and they've let the goats in the church and then now they want to blame it on the messenger and they want to blame it on the people and say you're not living like you're supposed to you let down the bars you stop preaching holiness you stop preaching the holy ghost and you've let the goats in the church and now you want to blame it on the message oh don't blame don't blame your lack of ministry on the message of the hour for it's the vindicated truth what vindications does your ministry have behind it none but this message has been vindicated time after time after time it is the unadulterated word of god in this hour i know whom i have believed in i did not meet a man or a prophet or a kentuckian i met jesus christ through his message when we recognize that name change is taking place yes sir it's god's thoughts he can't change his thoughts he can't change you to be a little bit different or i wish i was just different i wish i could do this he made you thus intricately perfectly to fulfill this hour with abraham says look god through his prophet isaiah a man who had his ups and downs like we do had his mistakes like we do but god that man so yielded by being a prophet that his words god's thoughts hallelujah god's thoughts expressed through those mortal lifts of isaiah a man with sin and things i have with his ups and downs like i have and like you have but a yielded vessel to god express the thought god's thought through word and no matter what they done isaiah's words had to be fulfilled for it was god's thought expressed through isaiah no matter what you could do you cannot stop the promise of god from coming to pass you can't stop it right right i could try to try you can't stop it you might be able to kill me you can shoot me if god's done with my purpose it might be my time to go but you can't stop this promise from coming to pass you cannot stop that there will be a body change you cannot stop that god will come down one more time and catch his bride away you cannot stop that because it's already been promised to happen by a greater authority than any power on earth by a greater authority than the president of the united states the greater authority than satan and all his demons but god who is rich in mercy said there will be a people that will overcome every trial that will overcome every demon that will overcome every affliction and they will overcome that age and be caught up i believe that's me excuse me if i get a little excited but i put my name there i put my face right there next to that because god saw me he called me he played i didn't i wasn't looking for him i was just wearing out a seat i was just wearing that a pew brother i'm just going to be honest okay i was just wearing it i was a good old message pharisee i could finish your quotes it didn't do me one looking good until i actually came in contact with him until i met the one who produced the message until i met the one that actually spoke the words until i recognized that he is here amen then everything changed oh my then it wasn't just me trying it was god pulling it wasn't just me like trying to force my way through but god was picking me up god was pulling me along because there was something in there that woke up something in there was activated by the presence of god and i knew i'm more than just this few years on this earth where were you job where were you i was there where were you brother brian i was there when the sons of god shouted for joy something in me recognized my position in this time we're there prophet said there you are hallelujah oh god upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it oh my when the world is no more heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away why he was expressing in word the thought of the almighty god my that's powerful and when we by faith can accept that word it's got to become material oh how it thrills my heart to think thy word forever in heaven lord is confirmed what god's thoughts is he expresses them in words and here is the living word of god amen in our midst yes you yes you that struggled to get ready for church today yes you that that war with what color street you had to be wearing that colored shirt brother because it was already thought of in the mind of god you might have had trouble and spilt something on the other one but you're wearing that one because it was in god's mind before the foundation of the world yes you who are unsure about why this guy's up here screaming but yes you god hath called you and placed you and chosen you to be an overcomer in this age nobody else can take your spot i cannot have your spot brother branham cannot have your spot paul cannot have your spot but god called you in all your inadequacies and all your failures and all your disappointments god called you to manifest his very word amen my if we could recognize like brother branham says it's god's thoughts not my thoughts not brother branham's thoughts god's thoughts thoughts jesus said he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me half everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but has passed from death into life hallelujah not he that goes to church not he that puts his name on the book not he that professes not he that shouts not he that heals the sick not he that opens the blinded eyes not he that speak of the tongues not he that prophesies but he that heareth my words [Applause] what's our what's our position now we're not looking we don't need to have some great calling from from outer space that we can just see a vision happening we could no but he that heareth my words he that believeth him that sent me it is not a just a man but it's god in our time preaching his thoughts that's right we are his thoughts he didn't lost me he didn't forget me he didn't just lose me under that cloud over there he's not he doesn't have short-term memory he's god amen oh brother let that faith anchor one time in that heart tell them words will be true before god then heavens and earth will shake and go away but that eternal word that thought that's in your heart that's expressed by god can no more fail than isaiah's words could fail behold a virgin shall conceive do we believe it happened 800 years you know how many doubters came in those 800 years it's not going to happen it's not going to happen but they could not stop it it was already spoken of god amen this is my thought and no man can hinder it god can't misplace it no he didn't put it in the wrong time didn't put in the wrong age i wasn't made to wear cowboy boots and spurs i was made for this age i wasn't made to walk around in a night suit or or to walk in ropes with the apostles but i was made for this age and you realize that we have a greater responsibility this is where we're made you know they say that a champion is made in the times of trial we when i played football in high school it was always the winner always wants the ball when that quarterback had a winning spirit on me say give me the ball give me the ball i'll win this thing why because he was a champion because he knew where he stood he said this game rests on my shoulders well can i say can i say to you this morning that this word rests on your shoulders it's not by your inability it's not by your weakness but the god that's within you has placed that word there and he will bring it to pass he's using our body he's using our lips he's using our feet he's using our hands and by that he will bring it to pass champions want the ball who wants the ball this morning who wants to say lord here am i lord here am i i know it's a tough time i know there's gross darkness all around i know that there's their spiritual warfare happening every time i i look every time i blink there's some other spirit coming at me there's sicknesses on the body there's afflictions on the church there's financial issues in my life but lord give me the ball i was made for this moment i was made for this moment this is the super bowl touchdown moment you were made for it buddy you were made to throw the ball you were made to speak the word we have been given a commission in this hour that is greater than anybody else's commission in the history of time even you oh my we're always putting pointing out how wicked the world is getting but you fail to see how powerful the church is getting at the same time she is rising up standing on the field oh she's a little but flock but brother god is with her and she is going to triumph just as certain as christ rose from the dead god's church shall never fail the gates of hell shall not prevail against it showed they would be against it but they cannot prevail the church is going to triumph through the blood of jesus christ through a victory march i'm positive of this one thing that god will have a church without spot wrinkle or blemish amen i'm so happy about that he says i am positive of this one thing i believe it's us i believe they without us cannot be made perfect he's speaking to us this morning he can't be made perfect without you he made you for that spot he whittled you down he shaved you down he took the time to carve you out so you could fit right in this spot i won't fit in your spot moses won't fit in your spot joshua won't fit in your spot right but the same elements that were in those men are in you together we make the body of christ but they those great heroes of faith if time if time could go on we would we would we would tell of the stories of the heroes of faith but they without you amen cannot be made perfect things are already set in motion there's nothing that can change it there's nothing that can stop it there is a bride coming to age in this time and it doesn't matter how many spirits come against her it doesn't matter how many doctrines sweep through the church it doesn't matter how many people fall away it doesn't matter how many people lose faith but there is a pride that is coming to age she is at the age where she's she's recognizing who she is she's recognizing the authority that she's been given she's recognizing that he had poured himself into her and when he says if you say under this mountain be that movement it's not by her power but it's by his power she's speaking on behalf of her bridegroom i believe that's us i believe we're fulfilling that i believe we are built for that somebody's going to fulfill this word why not me somebody's going to fulfill it it's me god made me for that position god made me to perform it god made me and fashioned me and molded me in all my inconsistencies in all my failures and all my misunderstandings and my slothfulness towards him and how i haven't i haven't really lived my life the way i should towards him and how i just kind of put him on the back burner but one day he's going to call and wake up that seed in you wake it up and say it's time it's time to come to age it's time to come up on a little higher oh you might not even be looking for him but he's looking for you he knows right where you're at he knows your frame he knows exactly what you're thinking he put the thoughts in there before the foundation of the world that would bring you to overcome he's not shocked by covid he's not scared by this he's not thrown off his you know his plan because we think changing things up but no it was even the government that put pressure on mary and joseph to bring bring jesus to bethlehem because it had to be bethlehem so all things work together according to the to the good of those that love the lord and are called according to his purpose it was the government that put the pressure on him right this hasn't thrown that it hasn't thrown god off no not at all but it's to it's to get our attention is to focus it's to get us down and really realize what are we doing here i believe we know that's right amen i believe we know we were fashioned to overcome the greatest adversary that there ever has been in time amen defeated so many before us he's he's the champion of this world he's defeated time after time after time he's taken him by cancer he's taken him by depression he's taken him by diabetes he's taken him by congestive heart failure he's taking them off of your time after time after time he took him on the cross but we yes we were fashioned to overcome the greatest adversary that time has ever known amen not by our our will not by our weakness but by his strength he said if we could just yield he can declare his character through your yielding amen god's character declared through our yielding he said empty up church there's more of god to have that's me that's my prayer lord i know that there's more of you out there to have lord i know you i i have the holy ghost i have an experience with you but lord there's more of you to have lord let me empty out everything that i am let me empty out every thought let me empty out every question lord every every inability let me empty it out because there's more of you to come and fill me let your character be manifest in my life oh god help us we have a greater opportunity we are the masterpiece of god yes sir you might look at disappear say who buddy but you are the masterpiece it took it took michelangelo's whole life he saw it in a vision when he was just a boy it took him his whole life to craft it god has taken billions of years to make you yeah and you might think well you know i'm just not able or i'm just too weak in faith but god took billions of years to make you for this moment this moment in time and he and he built the statue so perfectly and it looked so amazing and he just thought it should be real he thought it should speak he thought it should have a commission he thought it should have something to do and so he we know the story he struck it with his with his hammer and said speak speak what are we commissioned to do in this hour speak yes and under her messenger she will be the final voice to the final age you've been commissioned to speak it's not just a maybe she'll speak or she's going to get to the point where she's going to speak but it's the confession of god's word and his thought that she will speak she will be the one she will overcome under their messenger he will hear only from god and he will have thus saith the lord and speak for god he will be god's mouthpiece and he as it is declared in malachi 4 6 will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers he will bring back the elect to the last day and they will hear a vindicated prophet give the exact truth that they is us they will hear as it was with paul he will restore the truth as they had it and those elect with him in that day will be the ones who truly manifest the lord and be his body and be his voice and perform his works hallelujah do you see it god sent luther with the word the lutheran spoke for god at that time but they organized and again the pure word was lost for organization tends towards dogma and creeds and not simple word thank god they could no longer speak for god then god sent wesley and he was the voice with the word in his day the people who took his revelation for god became living epistles read and known of all men for their generation when the methodist failed god raised up others and so it has gone through the years until this last day now i know we probably know that quote and we can recite it but it's talking about us until this last day there is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of god it is its own mouthpiece so god is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the bride of god will be in her yes it is for it says in the last chapter of revelations verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come once more the world will hear direct from god as in pentecost but of course that word bride will be repudiated as it is in the first stage now he has cried out to this last age you have the word you have more bibles than ever but you're not doing anything about the word except dividing and hacking it into pieces taking what you want and leaving out what you don't want you are not interested in living it but debating it i would sooner you were cold or hot if you were cold and rejected i would stand that if you would get a white hot and know it's the truth and live it i would praise you for that but when you simply take my word and don't honor it i in return must refuse to honor you i will spew you out for you nauseate me those are heavy words that does not apply to me now anybody knows that it is a lukewarm water that makes you sick at the stomach if you need a nemetic lukewarm water is about the best thing to drink you want healing get hot a lukewarm church has made god sick and he has declared he will spew it out reminds us of how he felt just before the flood doesn't it oh my as we look at the church around in this age oh would to god that the church were cold or hot best of all she would be fervent hot sentence has been passed she is no longer god's voice to the world she will maintain that she is but god says not that's pretty dark but i like this last sentence here oh god still has a voice for the people of the world even as he has given a voice to the bride amen it's our commission to speak it's our position to speak we're not presuming we're not venturing outside our ability but we were put here to speak we were put here to be a repeater we were put here to be to be a a lips of living flesh that could preach this gospel that could that could speak this word into existence now we don't have need of squirrels i personally don't have need of squirrels but i have the same authority within me that produce those squirrels i have the same authority within me to bring to pass whatever i have need of in my life if you say unto this mountain and do not doubt in your heart it shall be removed you have yet been given the same authority that has been handed down from the almighty god you may not need squirrels you may not need a pocket knife you may not need a lamp to shake but you've been given an authority to speak over your mountain this morning amen oh if we could just look past the giant that giant is nothing before god oh what is that mountain before you zerubbabel right it's nothing before a son or daughter of god because you've been given authority not by man not by a pastor not by even a prophet but by god almighty has said you have i chosen to speak my word yes amen and move forward satan's done everything he could at us brother everything he could look at everything he's thrown at the church in this age tough trials we've been through some mighty battles some tough trials and we don't know each other's testimony probably that well but i know that you've been through some trials i know that you've been tested i know that you've been tried and and you've been tried in the fire but you're here that's how i know you're an overcomer right because we're still here you're still here this morning i know you've been tried just as hard as i've been tried and i i rejoice in the fact i'm still here even though he came at me with every kind of a foggy idea every kind of indecision every kind of question i'm still here even though he attacks your body with cancer even though he attacks your body with diabetes or whatever sickness you're still here this morning why because you've been made to be an overcomer in this age you weren't just made to fill a seat you weren't just made to sing in perfect harmony you were made to fulfill the promised word of the hour and speak speak we've been tried we've been shaped we've been formed you know brother bam said that that that when the three hebrew children went into the fire they sent the mightiest soldiers they had to bind them how stupid is the devil are you stupid he sent the mightiest soldiers he had to guard them them three boys from going to the fire he said turn it up seven times hotter i'm gonna send my best men in there how stupid is he they couldn't stand the heat come on brother they couldn't stand the heat brother baron said the only thing that it did that only thing the fire did was loose the bands the only thing it did was let it praise the only thing it did was let them raise their hands and kick their feet glory to god they watched every enemy that they had melt under the pressure of this age but they were made to overcome the fire they had another one with them it wasn't their own flesh it wasn't their body but there was another one inside there was a fourth man there's a fourth light in this age that's coming forth and it will bring us through there's no demon there's no weapon there's nothing that can stop it because it's ordained of god it's only going to lose your bands church that trial you're going through is only going to lose your bands they shall overcome by the blood of the lamb and the words of their testimony one time satan had me bound all but thank god jesus set me free [Applause] [Applause] here am i send me that devil might think he's got you bound he might have the hardest oppressive spirit on you that there ever has been on earth but they can't stand the heat [Applause] church we've been elected to overcome this thing yes sir after all the discouragement that paul went through after all the trials he fought after all the thorns in his flesh and after all the spiritual oppression he was under after after being seemingly the only one with the truth paul said this one thing i know glory that god is for me and if god before me who can't stand against me who can prevail against it though the gates of hell will come against it they shall not prevail and michael ward and the dragon ward and the dragon prevail not though the gates of hell are against us they will not prevail because it's been promised by the almighty father that you will be an overcomer in this age it's not for anybody else it's for you oh we could claim that in our heart this morning it's me it's me it's about me this is us yes hallelujah it's nobody else's position it's our position and after all that paul said there's one thing that has to be done let us run let us run church there's nobody else that's going to do it let us run there's nobody else going to fulfill it we're standing here we have feet we have arms let us run the race you know in a relay race the fourth runner is always the fastest they always save the last the last runner for the fastest guy yeah i was always the first guy they always say the fastest runner for last place because they can make up lost time come on you're fast you might not think you're fast but god thought you were fast you might not think you're able but god thought you were able you might think that you're never going to pull through but god knew you would pull through god placed you here he gave you the feet to walk he lighted your path amen oh my church we're not just here to fill a seat but god saw us and put us here to be the last runner of the race to finish it there is no more we're not waiting for anything else to be fulfilled but this word's got to come forth it's pulling us home there's something on the other side of those giants it's pulling us home there's something on the inside of me that's pulling me there lord i can't do it it's pulling me there lord i can't go up he's pulling me there somehow i'm back here in church somehow i'm back here serving the lord it's pulling me there it's pulling me there oh let us

whole plan of god has come down right here speak speak it and go forward oh it's pressing us it's pressing us i've been overtaken by this message i'm possessed with it why because it's god in my age

swept away the sands of laodicea he just swept down past that lukewarm water he just swept down past until he hit a firm foundation he said he saw a vision of that bridge standing there and it would overcome he said he he believed it so much so that when he was the first one to get on the bridge i believe there's a bridge been gapped in our age i believed everybody thought it couldn't be done and not this little church in sheffield there's no way she'll stand but god saw a vision god saw something different and he said she'll stand she'll stand the test of time let me just anchor her down in the sherock let me anchor her down in the firm foundation past all the shifting sands and pass this theology and past this man's opinion and he led the charge the very engineer that designed the bridge said let me walk on it first let me go first and like the prophet said there's jesus coming down to us waving his bloody jacket first here i come church here i come she'll stand she'll stand
