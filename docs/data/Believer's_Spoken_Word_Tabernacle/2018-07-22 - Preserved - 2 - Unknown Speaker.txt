one of you I mean good to have Caroline and sister Anita back gone way too long you all don't have to have a visa for Costa Rica do you we're gonna put one in well let's look into the word verse 25 if we could as he say it's also in Hosea I will call them my people which were not my people and her beloved which was not beloved and it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them ye are not my people there shall they be called the children of the Living God Isaiah's also can cry at concerning Israel though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea a remnant shall be saved for he will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth and as Isaiah said before except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed we had been as sodom and been made like unto Gomorrha Amen may God bless the reading of his word bless you for being seated I want to the Lord will help us just continuing on this thought we began just looking at last week and that's on the thought of preserved and I went through and kind of gave a little bit of a background on this from last week where the thought and you know I I don't usually do that but just in the terms of where we had had been upon our vacation we had went to Gettysburg and around the nose and we in though in that area and it spent multiple days there just touring different museums that are their battlefields many historical sites and yet when I was there before going there the thought that just kept moving on my heart and sometimes you know myself I don't know when God would have me to bring something I the inspiration comes many times I write things down sometimes there's things that I've studied and just continued to had to for years and then all of a sudden the Holy Spirit will say now is the time and so we we always want to be led of him you know brother venom tells us in multiple places in the scripture or in the message and I think of one place but there's many places but Feast of the trumpets and he speaks of how that when he was intending to come back to to Jeffersonville and to minister on those seven trumpets those seven last vials and the Holy Spirit pressing upon his heart and you recall it was something where he talked about how himself his stomach was upset in the condition and and he said that the Lord spoke to him and said you these have already been preached supernaturally under those six seals and when we we look at that you he brother bream goes on to say he said what many would call Jew of a Nile he said but yet he said what we look at is the leading of the Holy Spirit that's something that truly is a mystery to the world and it is a mystery for one who does not know the Lord in that way that God he does lead us that's his promise that the Spirit the sons of God are led by the Spirit of God and I believe that that same God that's one thing that I believe that when God has brought the message to us it brings Christ back to the center of all things in our lives and the word that it is Christ who is the leader of the Church of the Living God I believe that with all my heart it brings to the reality of our need and our dependency upon him and I begin to think of those that term preserved and just looking at what it means to be preserved and how is it that God how is it that God preserves his outworking in the fulfillment of his message because when I look around that battlefield I look around in those places and they are all marked with memorials and inscriptions and you can go to other places and yet those things you can read up you can read them you can look at them and truly there are things that are wrote there that are preserved there are monuments and different things they erect upon certain sites but yet when we look at the the preservation of what God would desire for our lives it's not that we would be a lifeless Idol or image but that we would be a living image of the Living God and this is only something this is God's working that he desires that it would be his image that would be reflected through our lives and I think of it you know when we look back upon this the thought that we have been dealing with here on preserved and I took you I'm just going to review just a few moments before we move on just a little further we come into a place that you know for many and I think within schools and III really wouldn't know right now if it's still where it's at with in history books even within schools I really don't know I can't tell you what what depth or what is pointed out in there but as I mentioned to you last week that when the battle itself and everything had commenced there was a man by the name of David wills who was given the the appointment to set up the itinerary and and the creation of a cemetery for all of those who had fallen in the Civil War he was a lawyer he was a prominent man there in Gettysburg and here in setting that up and bringing the the complete layout of the dedication of that Cemetery for lives that had fallen from the north and the south they they call upon a man that in in in all honesty I've never heard of this man before I never read of the man's name I really I would not even known his name I don't even recall anything that was ever mentioned that I can remember in school or anything of what he had to say but yet here this man is known as Edward Everett and he was a very prominent figure within that time and he was a great orator one who could speak and people anticipated that he would speak at least two hours in the dedication of this Cemetery and the last little thing that they had had mentioned when they were setting up the program was that they wanted President Lincoln to be able to come and make a few appropriate remarks now you think of this man this man Edward Edward he he took and he gave an oration or speech that was well over two hours and he was just putting this with this and this battle of antiquity with this and with that and President Lincoln he gets up and he has what we know is the Gettysburg Address and he speaks just a little over two minutes they could not even get a picture of him speaking because they couldn't get the shutter open in time from the time he walked up there to the time that he finished delivering the speech it was entirely over and it was finished and yet this is why I draw back to this point that we were I was looking at is that no one really remembers outside of history buffs if you can say it knowing about the other man but nobody remembers or recalls that part what everything when you think of the term Gettysburg or anything you'll think of maybe the Gettysburg Address and you know that you know you know well there's a that's a battle and I hope you know you know you would know it was in a Civil War and not think what was that the Vietnam War or you know and and and things like that and I know we we would laugh at that and that sounds funny but in reality there's so many that even here that walk upon this land that don't know the first thing about this nation that's the truth they don't know the first thing about and I'm talking about people that was even born here and whatever more but I'm I thing what I was drawn to is how that would the inspiration is how that Abraham Lincoln when he he started in this address he he makes mention in his very opening statements that four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation conceived in Liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal I want you to notice this is something I was just drawn to is how that what had taken place and what was going on within the nation at that time as we were alluding to that last week he went back to the founding fathers and he went back to not just to the founding fathers but he refers back to inspiration that they themselves when they wrote not the Constitution these words all men are created equal is what was wrote in the Declaration of Independence there's amendment now those things that are within the Constitution but what I want you to see is that hehe went back to the inspiration and that's that's very important he just did not refer these are not just words was going on within that time where the Civil War itself evolved you have that you know we know there was an issue there are issues that were very much at the forefront and yet this is the thing I refer to these places and I want to pick this up here in just a little bit but when President Lincoln he's ending this this whole thought on the Gettysburg Address the last few statements is that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth and I think that's a very good thought but yet we you and I we recognized as we looked at it last week brother Branham is in prayer and he's speaking of 1956 and I was 55 I believe I was quoting from and he was thinking God for being able to live within this nation and his prayer was his Lord we thank you for the right to be able to read these scriptures read this Bible in that of freedom of religion and he says long may this be preserved and I will definitely assert clearly that if we can I believe that we can agree that every nation that has ever been under the face of this earth that has ever rose and then has ever fallen it's rising was because of God's sovereignty either in that it was a tool to bring judgment or it was that of a nation where God would allow the rising in order for his word as his word would move through there but then when those men we're after those who were original we could say of founding fathers once they would pass off of the scene and then you had many on down through the time that drifted from the original inspiration then you find where corruption begins to set in and corruption itself you know even within the body when you have a wound or you have a something you have to take care of that you you got to take care of it if you don't corruption can set in and I think of just a young man that I knew some years ago he had had an accident just had a scrape on his leg as a matter of fact around his knee a young boy you cannot pick at this because if you pick at this cab what you're gonna do is bring an infection and you know develop into mersa which then you may end up losing your leg so there's appropriate way even for healing and how corruption corruption does not something that comes in all of a sudden it's something that little by little by little it wants to overtake and so when I they have taken this very speech this very thought that was given and I don't believe I just personally don't believe that President Lincoln was standing there on a stump speech that's my opinion but I believe when I look at it and he right there as I stood in that room that night that he slept in and where isn't the inspiration dropped for this I believe it was a capturing of what took place at that time and then to think it's been such pain taking steps taken in order to preserve the original documents men have research erosion of these documents or decay but they want to see them preserve and we know that there are preservation different places where they are and once such I'm Lincoln his self and yet you can look at that document and you can say that's the original document that it's really preserved but yet my question then arises is is that really true preservation is that what true preservation really is of that Gettysburg Address because there is at it if we look at it the document itself can be preserved by glass where people can walk by how many people maybe today I don't know if it's all I don't know if the Library of Congress is open on a Sunday I don't know that but how many people let's just say yesterday how many people have walked by that document within just the last day or the last week and they've looked at a preserved document of the Gettysburg Address but yet I would ask this that unless and I would say this that unless the meaning of the words expressed in that address or that writing are preserved in the hearts of the people it's not a true preservation we only have the only thing we have then is a historical document a memorial of a historical speech given at a historical event by historical figure or president whereby we have no connection we have no and we have no no true understanding of its meaning to our life in other words what he was expressing there of what the trueness of what the inspiration that the father the founding fathers were speaking of of America so a person can look upon that and yet truly does not know what it means to be an American they can read it listen we could have tapes of him giving this address that's not preservation you could have his voice recorded and here Lincoln's voice but yet it's not true preservation you realize that we you know brother Bram said they said if we they could come to that technology they can pick up the very words of the Lord Jesus that was spoke years ago he said because those words continue on do you realize that we could have even if we had the cassette tapes or whatever you want to say mp3s or whatever more of the Lord Jesus Christ speaking it still is not the true preservation you could have all of that and yet it not be preserved it's just like this Bible to have yet all of the words but yet if these words are not inscripted upon the heart and life of the believer then it's not preserved now we understand there's no man Canon script these words on our heart no sir it takes a work of God himself this is where that Peter would draw the inspiration James would also speak of receiving the engrafted word in meekness Peter would speak it up and say to be born of the incorruptible Word of God it's to where that word now it has it has a preeminence within our heart it wouldn't matter what would happen as I said there sweet they could take this and they could do whatever that they wanted to do with it but listen when God's time is finished and that word itself it has been wrote upon our hearts do you might destroy this but you'll never get this out of here you can put them in boiling oil you can't separate them from the love of God they tried to get it out of John they tried to get it out of men and women down through the ages that pledge their allegiance to the Lamb of God to all of those William Tyndale and different ones who gave their life they tried to get it out but you might be able to take it out of their hand but you cannot take it out of their hearts that's true preservation that kind of preservation closes men and women to stand in the face of adversity hallelujah glory be to God so then the question last few moments that we were there that last day I stood there I was actually there standing by myself Paul had went down a little bit further and my wife and my mom and Zachary and Ben had went to another part there of that National Cemetery you know when I walked in they have a place where you could take a picture they've got Lincoln's you know his face and bust or what happened right there and you can take a picture in front of this place and and I began reading on this plaque and they said this is where Lincoln gave the Gettysburg Address so I you know me just simple just take anything so it was must have been right here was it right here that he gave it and so I just looking and I'm thinking well there's some incredible places maybe he was standing right there and so after coming around a little bit and Here I am standing and this park ranger is giving this Horatian they're in the cemetery you know I I just listened I stopped and listened and you know he's speaking in many parts and I asked oh I didn't ask but here he he he mentions at the end he said you know one of the pressing questions that's always before the people is where did Lincoln stand when he gave the address and he says you know and he's point syria's we're standing in the National Cemetery and you know the the fence of evergreen cemetery which is where he gave the speech act is that is it was right in there and the young man pointed out and he said what it is he said it's somewhere he said between this Monument and that row of trees to the south which is about a 20 yard space he said somewhere along in there he said he stood and gave that speech now this is what struck my horn as I stood there I said oh god it wouldn't matter if you had the spot marks with an axe show me where Lincoln stood because you could be standing where he stood and yet not standing where he stood that says that's what struck my heart you could stand where he stood and yet you're not standing where he stood because you can stand right there and say I'm right here where he gave the Gettysburg Address but yet you're not standing in the thought and inspiration that he gave it in so it's not we think you know you know those are wonderful things memorials but there are our Testaments in our lives now move to the spiritual side of it there are Testaments there are things were in lies where people can stand we're great men of God have stood listen friends even in the visitation that God has brought with the messenger in this hour you can stand where he stood and yet not stand where he stood for you with me the Pharisee stood were Moses stood but they didn't stand where he stood they didn't they had the head of preservation they they believe this is a spot don't touch this spot that but that's not preservation preservation is to recognize what was done here and to see it that there is a continuation because if it doesn't continue then all we have is a historical marker how many times brother Brannon over and over he tells us I don't want a big memorial built to me when I'm gone is that true that's what's what's was prayer over and over throughout the message said but I want him to know one thing that Jesus Christ is alive I want that to be the effect he said it over and over you know he says not for one moment do I bring a message that people would follow me but that there would be a true uniting between the believer and the Lord Jesus Christ because you see he realized people could follow him but yet not follow him they could stand where he stood and yet not stand where he stood oh my this is very this is very pertinent to our lives my heart was just so moved within within thinking of this here because when we look at the continuity of how that God's desire when God would send a revival to the earth and and a revival let me just say it very clearly a revival is not an emotional gathering it's not an emotional work of it's not a feel-good session a revival is a cleaning out of trash and if it's got to clean out trash it takes the pure reality and substance of God that's able to identify what trash and be able to cut it away and it rises from our heart in repentance it washes from in our hearts to the very shores of our lips and says Lord forgive me Lord a revival is where that life is brought present how many times here we see the pattern down through the ages where the Prophet would even speak to how that he says people don't usually heed God's warning but he says after that revival fire has been built upon the sacred word I want you listen to these words build upon the sacred word it's so wonderful and the manifestation of the Spirit is so blessed that a little fear creeps in and a whisper in the heart says how can we protect this truth we have what can we do to see this revival goes on well you can put it in a case you can create a museum out of it but that will preserve it I mean listen I think you know when I've been out in the different places and I've come across things when you know brother ray you took me out there to that place of where Charles Finney was buried and we stood around there and gave thanks for his life I thank God for his life and and I realize I'm walking over some of the ground perhaps that Charles Finney walked over but I when I when I looked at it I realized it was not with the intent of a museum and just to have an inscription of his name or a museum does not mean that what he stood for has been preserved but its sacredness of a revival and listen it's very clear a revival my true revival is built on the sacred word it's got to come back to the original document are you with me it wasn't the Constitution France it was a declaration of independence it was declaring live tea that's why there's got to be a ring and a declare of Liberty and Jubilee from your heart and then when that is declared then comes the Constitution where the Holy Spirit comes down and begins to write upon the tablets of your heart [Applause] hallelujah and our conduct is just like where the Prophet will give that story of the young man they didn't understand why is he acting different what are you doing are you treating him any different no his treatment was the same but what was different about him than the others the difference was he knew who he was he knew what belonged to him though eyes there was nothing that where someone could say prove you're a king son he could not as far as be able to bring his father physically there but it was there within his heart what was in his genes what's in his heart and it moved him even though he was distance and miles away what his father was and ears was preserved in his heart and he knew who he was it's built upon the sacred Word of God but then and how God manifests the spirit but then how that a little fear will prevent how we're going to keep this how are we going to preserve this as I said to you last week it's God who sins the messenger it's God who sins the message and the God who did the sending is the God who does the backing up and the God who does the backing up is the God who sees that it continues on not in the way that where it would be looked at listen friends in reality if brother Branham was still here today we probably wouldn't be here we'd all be gathered down in Jeffersonville but you see God's continuity is not always a call to man's thinking of it man wants to relish in the past but recognize what God did there it was a reality and it was God being manifest to us in this generation that our lives might be overtaken by the leadership of the Holy Ghost and the Christ might have the preeminence in our lives because I tell you without the Holy Ghost and without being born again this message is not preserved in your life and you are not preserved by it it's got to be the author of the word who gave the word the inspiration come down and you come one with him then it's preserved then the message is not just something that's talked about but you yourself are the very manifestation of this message fear creeps in fear God does not maintain his word by fear the fear of the Lord is clean is that true there is fear reverential fear but not fear like this Butler Bram says when that happens that's when the antichrist spirit comes in and whispers look you have the truth now see that it doesn't get lost organize and set up your creed of what you believe put it all in a church manual I asked you when they wrote the Gettysburg Address it's sealed away in the Library of Congress but I ask you has it been preserved they set it up you don't don't don't dance worth it don't don't no no yeah I tell you what I'd be Dara Singh you would be Dara Singh to even try to make one step towards that but yet it's not preserved that's not how its preserved you could have it all set up and it comes down into a manual that's not what the working of the Holy Ghost is about that's not the leading of the Lord to where where lives are just well it's just looking at print no it's got to take inspiration of the Holy Ghost Alleluia this is not a movement of man this is a move of God if it's a move of man it will cease every doctrine that has originated within the thoughts of man if it hasn't run aground it will run aground because he cannot endure but that original inspiration of the Holy Ghost the one one man's taken off the scene another is taken home or whatever but that same inspiration will go on because it is God behind it God preserving his word and God don't want his word preserved to where it's something where we got to come to a glass to look at it but we are to be his display case where his word is on display in our lives not just what we could quote but what our life pulls out those are lifes amen to the Word of God how can we put it in a church manual I'll tell you right now there is inerrant listen there are people and I know there's been many versions of the Bible there's been versions just like when every messages went there ends up being multiple versions come on because there's men that are not taught by the same Holy Ghost who brought it through that messenger are you with me they're not taught by that light it is where a light it runs the ground but it doesn't continue on but look at this a person could have this and I say you know that the King James Version of the Bible they can have all of the words and you would sit there and they were defending you I'm a King James only you're not going to take one word out of here but when you begin to move down through the pages of the word then you begin to bring them across do you believe that he's the same today do you believe that he still feels what the Holy Ghost do you believe in a genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost do you believe better than a woman should be in subjection and a man ought to be in subjection under God do you believe those things well huh I don't know about that but yet they would not allow you to take one word out of this right here but let me tell you something when they have failed to give their heart to it there has already been word taken from them although they think they have it so preserved you can have this locked up and tight lock and key and yet it not preserved there's only one thing that preserves the working of the Word of God and that's the security of the seal of the Holy Ghost hallelujah and that seal lets me know this is authenticated by the author himself this is an official document and it lets it be know there are thoroughbred papers that are lay within this lot true genuine see and my spirit has brought it to life my seal says they are mine you'll have to be sprayed like hotbed plants promise positions and everything else but ruggedness of Gaillard men gallant soldiers of Almighty God to see without that revelation and understanding what a David say in the Book of Psalms I think it's Psalm 73 he said our fathers understood not the miracles they and they they benefited from they ate from the manna they aid they drape from the rock they ate the quail they pay they experience the heel there in the brazen serpent all of those things on and on we can go but yet they did not understand what it was all about but yet they received a call to come out but you see Redemption is two parts you have to come out and you've got to go in are you listening you see you got to know to know what it's all about and he's the only one that can do that and when we look at this here of how that this Antichrist spirit he had already entered and I'm not going to dwell on that so much here this morning but the Antichrist spirit John picks it up of how that this Antichrist spirit had already entered in you see Satan can't he can't get past the Holy Ghost brother Graham said in the first seal he said that Antichrist is a sharp smart shrewd fellow he said hey nobody can outdo him but the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost can outdo him aren't you glad that the Holy Ghost that even when the enemy would want to make you feel like you've got a right to feel this way and all those things but yet he cannot I'll do the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit can call it out and say but you're a son of God you're a daughter of God and you rise up and say get behind me Satan I might have a right to feel this way or this I might have a right but my rights I thought fit that his rights might be advanced hallelujah so that that advancement of that Antichrist spirit John makes it very clear where he says that it denies what is that Antichrist spirit every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God every spirit that confesseth he has come is of God and let me just say it like this that's not just looking back 2000 years ago his coming made way for his sacrifice and the sacrifice itself made way for the resurrection and the resurrection made way for the ascension and the Ascension made way for the coming of the Holy Ghost that same spirit that was in that body he tore apart that of the contract he took the body up there and he sent the Holy goes back the Holy Ghost coming was his coming not his literal corporal coming it was the coming of his presence the coming of the Spirit of God back down into the hearts of the people of the elect of this earth and Satan sought to assail against this kingdom but you cannot move the kingdom of God no no well what's that person had been born of the Spirit of God then they begin to see the program of God then they began to see or understand the kingdom of God it's an unfolding of God's program in our lives why we've got the original inspiration see we're not just looking at and we're not looking at a book and saying oh I shouldn't do this oh no I shouldn't do that you know what listen this can make good moral people men said to you like this do you realize why public schools was first brought in the creation of public schools was so that young people kids might be able to read the scriptures the first thing that they were taught that's the whole thing that's a bill that's not me making that up you can search that out that's the phone that's the purpose of it but look at where it's got to now entirely contrary to what the inspiration that was given as a matter of fact many times in those institutions it's taken and it goes completely opposite of what the original inspiration was this is why we needed the Holy Ghost in this hour thank God for eyes that have come in this hour thank God that where Satan's cover has been taken off that trail of the serpent has been exposed Alleluia I'm telling who exposed it the mighty God himself come down amen and took the cover off of Satan hallelujah that Antichrist spirit is always opposing his coming he is working let me move on here here it speaks of even how that where Paul would would mention that mystery of iniquity in 2nd Thessalonians 2:7 the mystery of iniquity doth already work Paulo aren't you worried no he's got it all in control you see Paul like if you go back and you know you read in in in the first part I believe it's acts 4 after they were filled with the Holy Ghost here they came together after the persecution and when they prayed they said Lord look God Almighty thou art / heavens and earth you know if they recognize that though this persecution and what has a rose there is nothing can stem the heíd of god's program until his program is accomplished and this is what Paul by inspiration is picking up only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way who is the who is who is allowing who is permitting the Holy Spirit is allowing but until he the Holy Spirit where in the bright form be taken out of the way you see this is the mystery his coming is a going there looking for him to step out on clouds but they recognize they fail to recognize his coming in by the Holy Spirit for his word is what makes us a part of the second coming so as each one down through the age have been sealed away under that message coming to fruition in their life to full maturity then has it moves into this time his coming is a going it's a secret sudden going away now think of this here my-my-my think of this here let me just try to move through this brother branham talks about how the message investments he talks about men like John Smith Calvin Knox Finney moody he says after their death they organized and they got a bunch of the good college graduates around there they put their own interpretation to it making an organization there where they died right there Sammy they shouldn't have put their own interpretation to it I agree I agree but why did they why did they do that when the Holy Spirit is not welcome then you don't have the author the inspiration of him who gave it so you are left to your own reasonings and to your own intellect it comes down to what it says in the book of judges because they knew not God in all these works then they themselves every man did what was right in his own right there they died right there right there when the interpretation was off right there death sets in life travels by way of the word death also travels by word life and death that's where Joshua here he is standing before them they had not taken all of the land but notice where he brings them to I set before you this day life and death choose you this day we're living in the town choose you this day it's between life and death so it's not men schooled by men that's not God's mind at all that God has an ordained school you'll never get a certificate or a paper well where's it at will he meet you the same place he's met everyone hears it all the mountain sometimes is it in a valley sometimes is it in a plane sometimes he'll meet you right there in your heart it might be on a mountain it might be beside a rock you you understand that's what God it's not there's not so much the place it is the place where God meets you in your heart and conviction is brought right there there's a training that God brings by his spirit now brother Matt makes this statement here he says from the Roman Catholic Church the first Roman Catholic Church before it become a Roman Church it was a Catholic Church at Pentecost some nearly three hundred years later at nazia Rome it changed from the Apostolic Catholic Church to the Roman Catholic Church that injected men's ideas the little Roman pagan superstitions into the scripture and since then she has never done nothing but lay there dead with members now our text that we open without a Romans 9 Paul is referring back to what was spoken by the Holy Spirit by the mouth of Isaiah in Chapter 1 of Isaiah you're not fine let me say this you'll not find what would be perceived at that time a more holier nation a group of people who had the prophets visit them but yet Isaiah cries by the Spirit of God he says what has happened to Jerusalem how have you become a harlot have you become like Sodom and like Amara no he wasn't that they were not conducting the feasts they weren't conducting the feast right at the right time everything they were by the letter but you see the Spirit of God called out among them and said but you're not preserving the real reality you're bringing me offerings you're doing this but it's a stink in my nostril and if it was not as Isaiah goes forth if there wasn't that there was a seed a promise that God would visit Israel and God would bring a restoration if there wasn't a promise of that he would like them all out you say Jerusalem a people whereby the God delivered a people whereby that God said if you want separate from every other nation you'll be under me a peculiar treasure but remember God will always abandon that which no longer serves his purpose and he front brought this down to think about it friends in this hour the hour that you and I live in had there not been a promise that was reserved for our lives in this hour of which we were tied to that promise identified in that promise but God comes and he makes that promise alive and real to this generation upon multitudes of people it has had no effect but upon your life it was something that though you could not describe that it fit your life like a glove it it was actually the unfolding of the mystery of your life whereby Jerusalem in the natural rejected Melchizedek but mechanic came to Abraham as the evening light and they let Abraham know thou art Abram of the Most High God glory be to God confirming Abram to his elect seed you are of this city hallelujah it changed it changed you look at the second Timothy 3 and I'm not going to read through this we're living there in the last days perilous times shall come let me just say this to you I've mentioned this before by his inspiration the next words in verse 2 does not say men will become shooters with guns that those are heinous things but this is what I look at what all of these things all of these things where do we see it for men shall be lovers of their own selves that's the root of it men are lovers of their own selves I said to you before you'd be pressed to find a dictionary in previous years now the term selfie is in the dictionary don't go into something oh yeah don't take a selfie or whatever more if you are worshiping yourself and posting all sorts of pictures of yourself and everything else then I say yes you need to repent of that it does not mean you're looking down this does not mean or I look down on myself I'm walking in such humility I'm such an ugly person that ain't humility that's called condemnation don't let the devil fill you fool you that's pride just as much as on the other line it's just as much pride humility is not thinking less of yourself it's thinking of yourself less lovers of themselves it's all about that about me about my me my me man you see what this is I'm not gonna do it dwell within it this comes into the inspiration within this our people's rights I'm not going to continue to dwell on that one this morning we're living in this time we're living in manifestations of seeds that have been sown and coming to fruition how that God would go forth and think of this how the these men when the word would become open and God would come by his mercy and open the word to that generation a seal being open God opening his word because as the Prophet put it like this he says Zion Zion you know as the church the Church of the Living God he said they get all settled down in Zion then God will send a word to stir him up because why is it they get all settled down there and brother man will use this this statement he said there's fossils and it's their thoughts we've got it all made we've got it all made we don't have it all made we need him we need him every day we need him every moment we need him every hour where do we go by the way of the grave or evil to the moment as the changing of our bodies we need the RAM we need the Rev Jehovah Jireh what the ages have looked for they've come to this place but how Abraham walked there and fake showing the maturity of the faith that would come to the Abrahamic seed walking where to this place he said this is where he would meet me and we will come and worship here and we will return again it's hard not to continue on those points hallelujah and he good we get it all made to get all settled down and then God will send a word I'm glad that God doesn't allow us to get settled down listen friends let me just be very very very frank with you the Bible is true God knows that we are but flesh but that's not an excuse but this is where the Holy Spirit will come right down and he'll deal right in our lives Oh Lord why how did I get settled down what the main thing is is that he comes and he stirs you up and let me tell you something don't you put one confidence in your flesh well I've got it made I'm moving forward I listen to a message every day this week I read my Bible read those are all wonderful those are all things to where God is able to move but listen have no confidence in your efforts have confidence in God that's where our confidence is I believe in laying in this word you oughta lay in this word if you can realize what God has sent to us in this generation you ought to give your all to him these are all examples more that we could go in through we have no continuing City I stood out there in the house it was a house of Charles Finney out there in Oberlin it was with them it was after we were out there that time with brother Timothy is xiong and I took him out the next day and they didn't give us a full tour a matter of fact it was actually closed at that day but the man opened it and it began to talk to us and said well he said I'll make an exception here as a brother he said from from here he said in Africa he said I'll make an exception and he said we'll uh I'll talk a little bit and take you through different parts and the things that he spoke about at that time it just it from that from that moment it spoke of how that you look at even the town of Oberlin itself you know it was a settlement that was I I can't go through the list but it was just completely against any attributes of sin no tobacco no no no nothing it goes down through a whole list there was nothing allowed in there like that charles finney harry becomes a leader of that college but I ask you when you look at it now and considering this is now when we're talking now okay when I was a little boy Oberlin was known as a place where the gays went homosexuals and everything else it was you could drag down Overland see him holding hands I'm not talking about just last year until my when I was the age of some of the young young people here and trows Finney stood there you see even though they've got monuments of him they've got places where he spoke they can have all kinds of copies of what he said but it's not preserved it's only a memorial of which those that would be around have no connection yet if you would ask them we are Overland we are Overland College sounds like Jeremiah chapter 7 where the Spirit of God deals with Israel and over in just that one verse I believe it's verse three of verse five over and over he says the people say the temple of God the temple of God the temple of God the temple of God and yet they could look at the temple of God and yet it was not preserved their lives the Spirit of God was pointing out by Jeremiah look at your life your life is not reflective but yet what you're holding to is the temple of God the temple of God the temple of God there is an absolute need for the token on display it's not enough to say the message of the hour the message of the hour the message of the hour but it must be that of Christ Himself making it real within your heart and your life that I am the reason this message came this light came that I might see in find my way he came with me in mind it didn't come to make where we had to end up making a a great settlement no it came to bring unity between God and His people because there is a promise of a rapture and the head must be united with the body many other examples that we could give that shows that the true reality that every Kingdom must give way the RAM you know he referred over and over you'll speak about how it was mentioned by one of the Lords in England of how the democracy is all sales and no anchor now this is where in the very beginning where he's looking at what this is being established and he says it's all sales in no inker now you find brother Ram begins to go through all of this and I won't continue to read but it is very clear that every nation and every Kingdom not myself has failed brother memo said in one place he says churches has failed human beings have failed kings have failed kingdoms have fell because you see our hope is not in this nation oh one day they're going to elect a man and this man is going to make this place great again my point without dwelling on this this morning we are people that would be under that inspiration of God that we are not to be caught up in the things of this earth let me say it clear as the Prophet said it and I stand right where he stood as well he said I'm neither Republican or Democrat I'm a Christian very simple very straight why you say why would it be blue Samuel you're saying we're not to be involved in politics I'm gonna tell you if your life is so intertwined with that you are sure to miss the rapture because your focus is on trying to turn things around let me tell you something don't you look for the government to institute things to protect your children you have been given access to the baptism of the holy ghost a true message of this hour with the visitation of the Living God and that's what you want to see instituted in your homes and in your lives God's not going to rapture the documents of the Library of Congress but he's come to rapture his word that has been made flesh for the sin you it's an evil it's a wicked day but God's promise is true when the enemy comes in like a flood the Spirit of God who raised a standard against it and he's done that and that standard is not a doctrine that standard is the living person of Jesus Christ we're not rallying around a historical marker we're not looking back to say oh well if Martin Luther could just come and was they could only come if William Seymore could only come here brother Branham could only come no those men were all sent by God and the God who sent them declared himself them calling the people to that word and those who caught what was going on and submitted to it Oh glory our lives are walking memorials of God's grace you might never see certain things you might never see Spring Street you might never see 8th and pen but you are the reason God visited in this generation yo the real memorial when the god when the rapture comes the brand of Tabernacle will remain there but the tabernacle of the Living God dwelling there in the hearts of man that's what will be raptured character will be taken back with him by people that's preserved in him oh my I think God for him for historical markers but I believe we need to understand the inspiration this is a continuity of God's program can have a humor moments the brem said it like this he said you saw about the days of the Joan of Arc Issus the message the Great coming revival the outpouring of the Holy Spirit he said they needed a revolution revolution married to straighten things up then after they had a revolutionary they ought to had a counter revolutionary to straighten up things that they had he said we was fighting recently just for democracy dictatorship were democracy he's talking about Vietnam well democracy Warner democracy is right I believe in democracy and I and and and and and if I didn't believe in it I wouldn't live here but I live here and I love it I think democracy's right but what we need today is an old-fashioned revival in the White House to straighten up some of the things that's called democracy - now I'm getting down to a point that all men were created equal this statement is made in 1954 what's what he says the next statement we need a counter revolutionary we need a counter war now among ourselves straighten out this thing and stop some of this ungodliness men walking on the street drunk give him enough whiskey to make him drunk then arrest him because he is drunk do you think that's right that's absolutely wrong what is it missing the original inspiration all men were created equal I believe that every one of us it ought to be something that rings in your heart no matter background as far as color and nationality but all sin is not equal this is not the legalization of sin come on somebody this is where they veer off the inspiration and they want to grant equality under the terms of Rights but it's okay for a man to want to marry a man a woman a woman and to live like that that is not the inspiration of the founding fathers that is not the inspiration but what has done that schools have changed it let me tell you something even in the deciding votes on those things some years ago when they passed that same-sex marriage there in the Supreme Court that won all Democrats there's conservative judges that were right on there that sided right with it you know what that shows friends that's why it comes back to it it ought to be a ring of declaration in your heart that here we have no continuing City I am a pilgrim and a stranger because there's nothing that can stand every nation can be shaken this shall be shaken it'll fall it'll crumble I don't care how stalwart that a person might be then they'll under these spirits this is not humanity on humanity we are not fighting human battles these are demonic forces but these demon spirits that are present and are influencing and have the right away from the government on down there is a match for them you and I are not a match but the Holy Ghost is more than a match that's a mighty angel that descendant in Revelations 10 yes the same one here he's watching over his bride he got one foot on the land one foot on the sea there ain't gonna be one thing that'll rise until I get my people the book has been opened the opening of that book the inspiration has returned the inspiration to come upon the original writing of the book amen this is a time of gross darkness and people don't know right from wrong remember when the Lord Jesus come they had Moses writings they had Moses writings if you were to make any move towards those writings they might kill you but yet when he who the writings was of come they wanted to kill him so I ask you were they preserving the writings the letter but the letter killeth the spirit giveth life he told them searched the preserved documents searched the scriptures in them you think you have eternal life he told him he said you you think I'm accusing you but I ain't Moses is accusing you he said you don't believe his writings oh my we preserve the law he said you don't believe him because you don't believe my words you see what they could not recognize is the continuity of God they knew listen they knew the history of Moses if you no doubt would ask them they could have took you on a tour of Moses Moses was right here when Moses stood right here what they tell us he stood right here he said this Moses was right here when Moses threw down the but the commandments all of those things it was all preserved but yet when what was in the writings began to be expressed oh no no this man takes away from Moses this man's a blasphemer in that amazing the writings and the words were one in the same but yet this man was accused as a blasphemer and yet all Jesus was doing is saying what he said but he's accused as a blasphemer you see it's a lack of understanding think of this now when we consider those words of that Gettysburg Address you know I didn't ask him but I stood there when that I was thinking on that what began to come to my heart was is that you might know all these things about Lincoln and there's some men and friends.i that I've had that I talked with that I mean they knew about Lincoln matter of fact they had the the guys come into the classroom that were using all over the nation that looked just like E and would recite these guy means I'm telling you if you didn't know any better you think Lincoln and resurrected I'm dead serious right next door to me and they would come in and recite and whatever more and I thought my goodness I begin to think back on that but what it was is that even though Lincoln could come back to that the founding fathers themselves remember they left a chair open at the table for the Lord they pray do you realize that members of Congress every year got a brand new Bible and what they did they went through that Bible and they wrote within the pages they wrote on the corners they wrote all through it and then they would give that Bible to their children then on January 1st they would get a new Bible and they would start all over again I'd venture to say that those who only know two Corinthians have not read the Bible you with me how that many quotes look look how many quotes of things were men want to get things past and they'll quote things out of the scripture how many quotes were how many things were quoted out of the scripture in regards to the health care that was passed well there's a multitude but they're all out of context every one of them is out of the original inspiration I'm not here friends as I said before this is not a political stump speech I'm showing looking at this in the in the spiritual what was struck my heart is that they didn't recognize the one who inspired Lincoln where the Prophet to talk about George Washington and Abraham Lincoln he said these are men who trusted God he said they were men who he said your character is molded by the things you read hello parents the things you read brother Samuel they're just children they're just kids you better be mindful of what they're reading I don't care if it come out of school there's many committees I said right on at school and they would laugh me to scorn because I told him I will not permit that book in my classroom they could have fined me but I told him I said the content that is suggested in it and the curse words that's in it and you try to tell me everybody cusses I said I don't cuss my family doesn't cuss that is not right you better be mindful we need to be mindful all of us need to be mindful God has given us her brother Samuel I read a daily devotional from where why do you need more to read God has given us his word and that daily devotional what inspiration is could even be behind that you ought to look at many of them many of the daily devotions and inspirations on the Christian bookstore shelves it's not men and listen even if it was men it's got to come by the original inspiration but it's women whoa whoa oh no one's with the scratching right now we're just scratching you see it's getting it's getting down into it God he has an order but now these thoughts of all men are created equal there's only one thing that will give that gives the woman her right place that's the Lord Jesus Christ we as the Church of the Living God are looked upon as a woman is that right look what the greatness of God did he came down and gave himself his life for us he didn't come down and say you give me your heart right now you give me no no no he gave his life and he deals with your heart that he might win his rightful place in our hearts that's the kingdom of God that's his kingdom they don't know that influence that was upon Lincoln's life reading all of the foxes Book of Martyrs and all those things they don't realize that stand with me remember as we said before here stood the Pharisees they hold the law but when the Lord Jesus came they themselves the Lord Jesus told him he said you don't even know you don't know what it means you don't even understand the law you don't you're not in tune with the original inspiration you don't know what love and mercy you don't know that this is the heart of it for centuries you know for centuries they've argued about words does this word have a certain meaning does this word have a certain meaning and yet it's not it's not about that I I when God will that lets me to look up a meaning I look it up but what it is is that the Holy Spirit that he would come and reveal his word he is the one that comes to bring conviction in our hearts in our lives what Lincoln mentioned at the end of that speech after that battle and yet the war wasn't finished but he says that from here would come a new birth of freedom and as we said last week the only truth freedom there really is is the new birth of the Holy Spirit that's when you have truly been made free indeed by the son himself I wonder if Lincoln or different ones I wonder if they walked into the halls of the government Congress or other places I wonder if they'd recognize it here many times where the brand talks about John Wesley Luthor he speaks of them and he says if they were to come back he said and they would see and know what was going on he said they would turn over in their graves so he's saying that standing here speaking this word the city has to come on down even to where we're at even into our lives there's no Kingdom no Kingdom can stand outside of the kingdom of God and that begins in the heart of man it begins there he writes this is too loud brother is is this dead or something I don't know I just just turn it down a little bit please there is just that Kingdom to begin with in our hearts it leads us into the change that we're looking for it's a witness in our life we don't have no continuing City you see without there being a change in our hearts it's it's like there can be an administration listen to me one administration can come be a lot of things done under this administration but another administration enters those are the things that are done in countermeasures but if that administration of the Messiah the Holy Ghost the person of Jesus Christ it enters into your life then no matter how much time changes no matter how many other things you wrote no matter how your health may deteriorate everything else may roll erode and give way but that kingdom that has been established in your heart by the Holy Ghost there is nothing can take that away nothing this is where his kingdom begins and remember his kingdom the kingdom of God does not come with observation he moves in and he takes over but he's a gentleman he rides in deals with our life in our heart maybe you're here this morning and you have not surrendered your heart to him fully you say I struggle with this right struggle with that I I don't know how be able to do this or I don't know how be able to live this focus on him you're focusing on the wrong thing of what you can do or what you can't do that's the wrong focus you have to focus on the king himself because when the king himself moves into your life the attributes of the kingdom they come forth it moves out in your life the dying what he what he does is he takes your life to what it is you're longing to be there's no way you can have that longing you he didn't place it there you couldn't have that desire unless he already had placed that desire there but he's the only one that can make that desire come from just a desire to a reality you're loving this morning oh lord I want to give you my all I want to give you my all this preserved it's his keeping power it's his life it's him guiding it's him directing said this to you last week and I can't get away from it where we stand right here I'm not talking about these grounds although there were many sacrificed for these grounds even that we stand on but I look what we even what we enjoy and I'm not just in the natural but what we enjoy with what God has given to us this morning that we could rejoice with in this word it's been because of lives that have been yielded to his voice I'm not just talking about Ministers I'm talking about sons and daughters of God I'm talking about dads until my mama's I'm tell my grandma's and Grandma grandpas I'm told my lives that's been dedicated for the purpose of the kingdom of God that has lived this life faithfully their life their life has been lived as stepping-stones of God's grace as the Prophet said it when he stood there in that prayer breakfast out there in Phoenix and he looked around he's seen the older Minister setting there he said I think God he said for every one of them see her brother Samuel maybe there's many of them at that time they weren't seeing the light but they've seen the light that they were ordained to see and they walked faithfully in it let me tell you something we'll have a greater account if we don't walk fully in the light that God has given to us they they lived their life they ran their part of the race that baton was handed to them and they were in it faithfully they took it and they ran it this gospel was moved on this this message where you and I stand it just didn't it didn't stop and hop from 1965 to 2018 there are lives that were yielded under the training of the Holy Ghost but back no not many years a lot of bumps in the road and a lot of things but you know what God is faithful the preserving of his outworking is him he sends the messenger it is his message and he is the one that fulfills it because as the prophet pointed us over and over he said the true messenger the true prophet of the out not that he wasn't a true prophet he's pointing us to the prophet he said is the Holy Ghost he's the working you see this is not a stopping leveling off it's a continuation what was spoken as Paul himself could say a dispensation of the gospel has been given to me for you that you might fulfill I say when we look back we count those lives that's going on before I ask each of us I ask us to really think deeply here this morning what is our lives paving a way for what is our lives paving the way for it I want to be found paving away for his coming that's why I want to be found the brand was very clear it wasn't laying a platform for another man to come on to see another man that would rise up in all the people and wrought rally around no no no and this is God's already sent his messenger and the messenger calls us to rally around Jesus Christ you with me so he laid a platform for who who was the platform laid for the platform was laid for the Lord Jesus Christ that he might work in his body I say Lord I don't know how many years I don't know how much time say brother Sam you're a young man thank you I still don't have a promise of tomorrow and neither do you but every moment every day let our lives be a heist you think of your homes think of your families think of the coming of the Lord if there is another generation I'm not saying there is but are you but if there is a tomorrow may our lives people way Oh Lord Jesus we stand here Oh God a sacred ground Lord holy Lord Jesus were your presence where you had come and you would speak to our life this ground is just like any other ground but Lord as it was there spoken you made yourself known upon that holy mountain or God as your prophet drew our attention that he said it was and then the mountain was holy it was a holy God upon that mountain Oh Lord God I pray for each life in every heart Lord O God I pray that the words that I've been expressed this morning the Lord maybe find their way Lord in our hearts I pray God if there would be any heart or any life Lord that living below that standard of where that you have called and ordained for them to live Lord I pray God this morning that they would yield Lord to your hand Lord and from their heart they would Lord make that prayer say Lord take me O God to where the longing of my heart Lord is and that is to be by your side Oh God Lord Jesus how we see it so clear how many historical documents how many words how many monuments how many memorials Lord all around us through Oh God we want to be Lord that living memorial life a living image Lord where your word is preserved in our hearts then no matter where Lord God no matter where we are we thank you Lord that life within us Lord it's not I live but Christ that liveth in me as you said the works that I do shall you do also and greater works than these shall you do for I go unto my father all Lord Jesus grant the needs I pray of your children this morning Lord inspiration the Lord that has been given Lord that same Holy Spirit Lord here this morning Lord God to rule our hearts Lord to you Lord these things Lord from our heart Lord sometimes things seems so harsh and sometimes can seem rude and cutting but Oh God the heart behind it Lord God is the desire or God that our lives Lord would walk free and clear let us not be overcome Lord with a drunkenness lord of this age in this life Lord but may we walk Oh God intoxicated with your presence inspiration of the Holy Spirit Lord knowing that these things that we see and we hear taking place around us or God we've been given direction to lift up our head for our Redemption draweth nigh Oh God our eyes it's fixed upon you Lord Jesus Lord God we see everything the Lord everything Lord around us crumbling crumbling well god there's they've reached for band-aids and gods and all sorts of teeth to try to put things together but God there's nothing can put it back together but there's got to come a complete renovation as your prophet declared it Lord when he stood there Lord and he said if there's one funeral that I want to preach it's a funeral to this world that that new heavens and earth would come forth it shall be a millennium Alleluia a time immemorial Lord thousand years honeymoon a gathering Lord God of your children Lord rapture Lord God we will sit down at the wedding supper veterans will set across from veterans soldiers Oh God and you will come by and you will wipe the tears from my eyes I can't say Lord that I can explain it because I can't how that we will have memories of your works here in this earth but yet you will not leave us in sorrow and sadness part of our I don't understand it Lord but I just believe it how that our memory those things will be so illuminated and so changed in that time we will not have the same memory that we have now we'll remember Lord you're working but we will not remember any Lord that hasn't made it the Lord our focus in this hour because you know them that are yours no matter what the situation might look like no matter how bleak Lord Lord God you are still God no matter Lord Jesus if they win astray you are still God and Lord Jesus we hold that token Lord with unwavering faith our confidence Lord God is in you Lord Jesus but the same warlord had brought that same experience a transformation in our life you're the same God to do it Lord God in the lives of our loved one's children Lord we got a good question your heart went let's you just make it known to the Lord maybe there's a loved one maybe there's someone it's on your heart right now what God we lift him in prayer we all have loved ones we have different ones thought friends different ones Lord that we've worked with or went to school with or neighbors Lord there's not war Lord God even those Lord that would maybe so disagree with the slaughter despise us but our desire Lord we know goddess for that soul I pray Heavenly Father Oh God by your mercy Lord God as Abraham stood there Lord when lot had went ahead and made his choice but yet Abraham stood there as an intercessor and he interceded when Locke did not realize what he was under but yet Abraham stood there Lord Oh God granted this morning Lord for every heart Lord that's behind those hands you know Lord what's upon their heart I ask it Lord in the name of Jesus Christ the Lord it might be through their lives through the living testimony of a trophy of grace not one that somebody has to travel to a battlefield and see a description but they witness God's grace and inscription upon that life granite Lord God I pray father Lord God we give everyone I commit this assembly I commit every heart Lord into your hands Lord father those in need the Lord God of the Holy Ghost I pray father that god they'll open up their heart Lord God and the Lord recognize Lord that it's your desire your desire is more to give it Lord than it is for them to receive it lord I pray that god in the name of Jesus Christ then Lord may they let go of everything right now Lord as the Holy Spirit Lord would move down upon their life Lord may everything be turned loose Lord may you be the center of their thoughts Lord and the focused Lord all of their lives
