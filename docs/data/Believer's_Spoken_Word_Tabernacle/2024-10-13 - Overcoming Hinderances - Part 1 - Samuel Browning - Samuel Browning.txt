testimony I hope encourages someone maybe myself as well um at work uh there's gentleman named Tony Castro we usually have a round table with the bosses sometime I work I've had many blessings with this little company I believe the Lord has me there for a reason other than just working so one of the round tables Tony was there and I were in the meeting and uh as we gave a little background of Who We Are we were on the horn and then got to Tony Tony said he found a renewed uh interest for his faith and it struck me I listened to him it intrigued me so I said okay so then um he Liv He Works near pretty close where I am in the vicinity of of the warehouse where we're at and so then um when I got to share with him a little bit my faith I said I said I invited him I said you go look at the uh the website you examine everything you want and he raised his eyebrows at me I said you go look at anything and everything and you come talk to me about it and then um when uh uh over time I've been sharing parts of the message with him but I never got I was ever able to express or convey brother Braham to him just yet so I said there's going to come a time I'm going to share with you I said in time and um in this uh past Friday said in time I'm going to withdraw from you I said you examine I said what you do with this truth is up to you that's your part and so then uh before I left I gave him our website I said go ahead look at it I said I gave him to the um also the voice of God Recordings so I said you I said what God is doing in this day and I and I was trying to parallel between the two what's going on and what's happening and so I would just share with something they just sit there kind of asound I'm not trying to be a Mystic I said but I'm just try to show him what God is doing in this day in this hour what we have and so I Shar with so he was grateful that I gave him the websites it's kind of a rare thing when you can talk to somebody about the Lord and even more when you can share me bits and parts of the message I said we're trying to just not convince people that we're right we that God's right and we're trying to share with them that this is what the Lord has done and not us I said and it's such a blessing when you're you can sit there 5 10 minutes and it's just flowing and said God you're in here I know it and so with him is now I said um I asked him if he doesn't belong to any church I said well okay well maybe it's not not indoctrinated or maybe uh something else to measure or compete or compare to so but now he's almost like a a new child said well he can examine judge for yourself so now I want you to just pray for him his name name is Tony Castro that uh that God would deal with him if he's part of the truth he may be one of the last ones we're looking for so by God's grace that um I I want to live a testimony before him and I said there I said there'll be times you may come with questions and then there'll be times go you don't

bless you it's good to have you here with us amen and uh there's somebody else I'll just say any visitors amen that are here I I don't see uh too many others but uh it's good to have everyone here um I think it's kind of self-explanatory I don't we're not going to be able to have that fire pit uh Fellowship here tonight and um sometime or another we I think we're just going to have to do it like tou and go I know brother Shane's been looking at the weather I've been looking at the weather and sometimes we have our best intentions to plan things and I know I know we have to plan it because sometimes it's just for different ones making uh the sacrifice and taking off work in order to be for the fellowship uh but uh uh when Lord willing we'll try to just stay on that and try to arrange something here that uh if it can come up at some time whether it's on a Sunday or a Friday evening or something just so we can have some time together I believe Fellowship is important that's why those things like that that I have on my heart uh I think that's one of the things that even with h before covid came along but that's one of the areas that Satan wanted to attack was fellowship and he he hates Fellowship um you know he would like to cause Unity on the wrong things but we want to unify around the word of God and I think if the prophet of God could stand there in the message shalom and he was so moved by seeing that people had brought lunches to eat together and how moved he was to see that Fellowship I tell you to me this is not like the workplace you know you you appreciate I appreciate different ones that I worked with when I taught school but when 3:00 came that relationship ended but we're a body of Believers am that's different we're part of the family of God and it's just something we just we love the fellowship amen around the word of God and with one another so maybe the Lord just praying that God will just make a way for us I'd like to look in the scriptures here I just have one scripture the that we'll read and that's out of First Kings 18:21 thank you musicians amen and First Kings 18 and verse 21 and Elijah came unto all the people and said how long halt ye between two opinions if the Lord be God follow him but if bail then follow him and the people answered him not a word I want you to think of this this was a God saw the need that was in the heart of Israel and remember there were 7,000 that was reserved unto the Lord and they needed a courage to be able to stand now they had the word of the Lord but how the circumstances and things of Life had just uh things had come in but there were some real Believers remember God told Elijah after this incident Elijah ran is that right and God told him I've got 7,000 that's not bowed a knee to Bow and the prophet told us he said what it was is they needed to see the Living God and once they saw the Living God it would give the 7,000 the courage to step out on the word of God and that's that's that's what God has done in this hour we're we're not walking under a theology we're not walking under a this makes sense and I can prove this that's not how we're walking even though the word scripture must compare with scripture is that right and all all the all the all of the word of God is given by inspiration it's profitable we could go through all of those things but the way that we serve God Is Knowing him by divine revelation that's where divine revelation has prevailing power power it gives us authority over the enemy amen you love him amen God bless you as you're being seated this morning I'd like to also read uh from Romans chapter 8 if we could and um Romans chapter 8 and verse 1 the Bible says there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemn sin in the flesh that the righteous of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit now notice here in verse five this same theme for they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you and so when we look here all the way through this portion of scripture that we even would read here in Romans 8 I I think when that reality strikes it's more than a word but it strikes where there's no condemnation when we have we have passed from Death unto life where there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus he he has made a way for you and I to live in a full Victory uh to where the devil has no hold Upon Our Life to where there is there is an authority that within our lives and there's nothing let me just say it like this there's nothing as great as the Liberty that the Holy Spirit brings by the new birth there's nothing as liberating as that you know and so when we're looking at these things I knowing what God has called us to and the purpose that he would have within our lives um there's a something that I would like to just speak on or at least begin to deal with here just a moment and uh that we'll look at here for just maybe a few services but I want to deal with this if you're go and switch it for me Brianna I want to go ahead and I want to deal with this overcoming hindrances and so and so when we're looking at things you know of hindrances there's sometimes you can see where a hindrance itself is something that provides resistance it's a delay it's an obstruction to someone or something and you know you can see here within the pictures you've got two of them right here the where that here you have an obstacle here's a mountain that stands before them here you have a tree that's Fallen within the road those are things that uh it's circumstances and things and hindrances of life that come up just like when the scripture says if you say to this mountain be thou moved that mountain can be sickness that mountain can be all sorts of um situations it might be something on the JW but then there is also things that can be hindrances that is holding us back from what God is is calling us to these are things that we want to be able to look at because I believe that this is our desire we we want we rejoice in the word of God but the thing that God's desire and God's Delight is by making his word so plain and so real to us is to where that we begin to see our own selves in the word it that takes on a total different light when you begin to see yourself in the word of God it's one thing to to see brother brandham it's one thing to see your pastor it's one thing to see a Dad or Mom or somebody else but God's desire is that you would see yourself in the vision when you see yourself in the vision that changes everything and so this is God's desire this is why listen this is why the preaching of the Gospel Goes Forth even in this hour this is why God his prayer would be buy of me gold that's tried in the fire that and and that you would also uh come and receive of that garment that would clothe that thy nakedness would not appear and that your eyes would be Anointed with isav God's this is an hour of seeing this is an hour where that we we are not in no longer in the mouth age we are in the time of the seeing age and from the seeing now comes in to the very intelligence of God's own mind coming in to the body of Jesus Christ so to think where we are are living in this hour God's desire remember is to see his word being made manifest through our lives now you know when we look at this all before our lives when we the scriptures that we read here uh regarding that there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ and we can see how that you know even with that aspect within Christ that we're always going to have before us there's going to be choices there's going to be decisions that we have to make we're not and this is why that Satan battles in the mind because it is in the mind is where decisions are made this is why that he he'll try to hinder and try to move and try to make you know come within that Spirit realm he'll want to distract you Satan now let me just say this just as much as God is coming by his word to influence us into his word to move into him Satan also comes to want to influence by trying to show us all of the impossibilities the prophet said he wants to show you all the defects he wants to try to put all of this picture here of even what God has promised in regarding our lives he wants to try to hinder us he would like to try to cool us down the prophet said when Satan he says here it is Satan will even try to get ahead of a meeting to block the oncoming visitation that God has for you so Satan he he realizes that the word of God is is more powerful it will always overthrow him but it overthrows Satan when the word is received into a channel that is open and available and then the word expresses itself for what it is in the very power and authority to perform itself amen I want you to think of this here we are not walking and you know it's very to me I always love that in Romans 8 because the scripture was very clear we're not walking after the flesh yet what a what an incredible thing here you and I I'm looking and I'm seeing all the way through here flesh bodies we are still in the flesh but what Paul is writing in is that our uh our tie we are no longer tied to this Earth this is not this is not my home this is not what I'm tied to my first birth I'm not tied to this is where that we are no longer in the flesh but we are in the spirit and other words we become like a a a two-fold being here we are in contact with Heavenly places and yet here walking upon Earth and then others in the carnal mind will look at the spiritual mind and wonder why the approach I mean what how did it make sense for Israel when they needed water to speak to a rock the carnal mind would say that's the driest thing to go after right see God God Specializes in showing himself and it's so contrary to the carnal mind I mean what how how would it make sense for a man to walk around Jericho seven times and on the seventh day seven times the carnal mind would say that's foolishness but the spiritual mind says this is God's word and this is the spiritual mind is that when the spirit of God has so anchored in the depth of that soul and there's come forth a new birth that even there's nothing within the word that that Soul could not punctuate with an amen amen that's a real evidence of this Holy Spirit in a life listen friends anointing is not an Evidence gifts are not an Evidence nothing outside of the word being punctuated within our life because gifts will fade all of those other things do we believe in them we do but they are not above the word the word is above everything amen it is the word that brings and puts the gifts in the order it is not the gift that we're resting upon we are resting in the word because that is the only place that is certain right we we're not falling back on oh God led me to do this and God showed me to do this it's we are the Bride of Jesus Christ and it must line up with the word of God when it comes down to everything in our life it's B it's got to be based upon God's word is that right that's what God is coming back for is for a word bride so this is what the Holy Spirit I hope you're with with me now this is what the Holy Spirit has come to produce in this hour this is why the bride message is more than just the baptism of the Holy Ghost are you hearing me the baptism of the Holy Ghost makes way for the word himself are you hear me Pentecostals had the baptism of the Holy Spirit but now the word of God is to come and that word by the baptism of the Holy Ghost in our life is to produce a word bride a life that becomes a prisoner of the word not just an anointing upon our spirit not just with gifts but with a life that falls back on the word every single time that the word is above everything including my own ideas and that's where it brings us to choices no doubt every one of us have felt this way we've come to these places in our life and I want you to think about this what the effect of redemption has upon our life I love how brother BR says this in the message the breach when we are redeemed we no more want our own choice right but we want his choice me say let me say this to you if if you find the word of God Grievous if you find the things hard let me just say to you like just say God let that full Redemption strike my soul because listen the price was paid at Calvary but full Redemption is where the Holy Ghost claims that Soul it's where it ties you back in to that reality of what God did for you amen and this is where that it comes down to that there's nothing that God could ask of you or I that we can that we would look at and say Lord no I'm not going to do that or I can't do that this is an effect of redemption it's not listen to me now it's not that there are not things that don't come our way that we have to die to oursel the Lord Jesus when it came time for that word to be fulfilled he prayed three times if it's possible let this cup pass from me but because he was redeemed Hallelujah you say redeemed the prophet said at the River Jordan Future home he said here the spirit of of God came down and he claimed that body that he himself had created that's the same way that the Holy Spirit you see he was the prototype of what the Holy Spirit would do to you and I as a Believer what is the Holy Ghost doing it's coming to claim what belongs to him we were always Sons and Daughters of God and it's the holy spirit that leads us into full obedience so now to think of this Redemption and to claim back he he was claiming that body that belongs to him that's what the Holy Spirit comes to claim back back every son and daughter of God comes to make known to you and I who we really are and now with that Redemption know the effect of it we we want his choice I I want to know Lord what do you think about this that's what I want to know when a man has been redeemed he don't care anymore for scholarship he don't care for any more of the things of the world the wisdom of the world he don't want no choice at all Christ has been his choice and that's all of it he is redeemed he's just no more wants to lead himself he don't want nobody to talk him into where to go and what to do he just Waits and finds out the choice of his maker then he goes in the name of his maker then when the maker tells him where to go hallah that's walking in Authority that's recognizing that you know that I I'm not my own I belong to him I'm not come to do my my own will I'm I'm not this is this walk is not about me it's about him right my whole life or whatever your span of life was or maybe even here before a full surrender it's always been about you but when the Holy Spirit has come it now our life becomes about him listen we're not waiting to go and look at some nativity scene your own life becomes the scene of why he came why God himself descended and was born right here Among Us he came that he might be born inside of our lives and it's it's not a nativity scene out here but it's Christ himself in Simplicity that now is born inside of our life and how fitting it is that there was no place for him no room for him in the end but he was born in a stinking stable where where it was just a smell in the stench how fitting it was that he himself South would come down and through the new birth he would be born in lives in Tabernacle whereby sin had so entrenched and filled our life but the grace of God comes down and cleanses our life and now it's Christ himself he is the focal point of our life like the prophet said that centerpiece of the garden is where all Paths of the garden lead into it becomes the focal point and that's the things that in our life where Christ becomes the focal point then everything is pointing to that everything our decisions that that's what we want our decisions our choices that it reflects Christ Lord I don't want my decision I don't want my choice it's God's going to let me choose but I want his choice amen amen that's what I want I want I want what he wants I I that to me is what I care about more than anything else is what he wants what his will is this is why when the script says we look not at things which are seen cuz they're temporal they'll fade away you can look at we can see that things will fade and pass but we look to the Unseen to the Eternal that's where we have to be fixed and our lies and our lives fixed on this is why the scripture say we do not walk by faith but by sight even with Moses the Bible said by faith he forsook Egypt and and he not fearing the Wrath of the king he endured as being him who is invisible I want you to think of this Moses himself remember he was born the prophet tells us with this great quality of faith in him but he needed to come into the presence of God and for that Faith to move from just an intellectual to a supernatural faith it needed to become anointed by God by the word is that right and notice you know when when when all of this here he had a faith within his life and you know when you consider it the prophet tells us like this he said he said when God begins to deal with your life if you start looking around at others and say well they can do this and they can do that and this person claims to be a Christian and and this person claims to be he said you'll only end up paralyzing your faith don't get your eyes on nobody else I believe there ought to be real examples in the house of God but don't you ever settle for just an example of a mortal human being always let your example be Jesus Christ and he's the word so if our example is the word it doesn't matter who who who fails here or who fails there it doesn't matter our eyes are upon the word oh my and this is where if we'll keep our eyes on him listen as the prophet said your faith as he said the world will either paralyze your faith or your faith will paralyze the world Amen it's one or the other oh God let our faith paralyze the world when the world wants to try to move and act upon our life and draw Us in into circumstances of compromise and other let our faith by looking unto Jesus who's the author and finisher of our faith it will paralyze the effects of the world coming in in our life oh my this is why we want above everything the will of God Amen God's will is what is esteemed above everything in our life and his will is his word is that right this is why that you know God will never lead us outside of his word is that true it'll never he'll never lead us outside of it he'll always lead us within his word that's the promise when the spirit of Truth has come he'll lead and guide us into all truth notice in in the book of Ephesians chap 1 and verse 7 it says in whom we have Redemption through his blood notice in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace he's never run out of Grace he's never had a he's never had a bad stop day on Grace amen but Grace itself brother is unsearchable riches wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence that word Prudence means a love of God's will having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself I to me when you can see God's grace there in verse n it was God who made known the mystery of his will for our life I know there's a lot of things as we look at through life and we have decisions that we have to make throughout life but even with all of that in mind you know there's things where we're looking and God what is your will concerning this Lord what is your will I know what my thoughts might be but what are your what is your will because you know what the longer that you serve God the greater you value and esteem being in his will you recognize it's like things as we grow and we value we value things now that our parents told us there that we looked at and we said well they really don't know what they're talking about and and they don't you know and and and sometimes we just did things you know because that's what they wanted us to do and we honored them and obeyed them but as you get older you begin to see the value of what you're doing and you see that's one sign even a maturity is maturity is valuing I want God's input above everything else it's the value of I I've seen where it leads where I go on Impressions I don't want to on Impressions I want to be led by the Holy Spirit I I want to be in a place that God can lead me not not to where there's a hindrance in my life I want to move Beyond hindrances amen finding God's will this is a very familiar quote Even in our even with finding God's will very familiar very familiar brother Bram says he's asked the question how do you feel is the best way to find the Lord's will in some important matters he said the best way to find the will of God is post a survey on Facebook the best way to find the will of God in some important matters is prayer now let me just say it like this just because you haven't got a no don't mean you've got a yes are you hearing me amen we we want to know we listen we're let me say we're living in an hour you can't take presuming I'm I'm just I'm just saying it from my heart don't you can't walk by presuming we can't walk by well I I think this would be best or I feel this would be best God is calling every one of Abraham's seed to separate from see taste feel smell hear reasoning conscience imagination God is calling Abraham seed to a complete walk with him alone this is the time of rapture and the Bible said Enoch walked with God Amen a time of Walking with God separate from all of these from these other things so notice how do we find what's the best way prayer he says I take it before the Lord and it's always been my strength I wait upon the Lord and see what he says and I just let myself neutral to it and don't take either side that right there that word neutral can be a big word I should have bolded I should have capitalized that word because staying neutral can be the battle right you can have all kinds of influences you can have everything else that can come your way but remember staying neutral that's the key is so you say how should I be prayed God let everything about me be neutral it's not Lord I want this and I want that but God help me heart to be neutral why cuz if I'm neutral then I'm open to him hear from him amen and sometimes we've got to remove other voices and sometimes it means don't confer with others amen amen now let me just clarify that that doesn't mean you know if you've got something on your heart just sit down with the pastor but I I will tell you those that have experienced this already there will be questions that will come that I'm not looking for answers to but it's questions that you must take as God would give it and pray over it and consider it am because every decision we make in life is very very crucial friends it's very crucial sometimes there's things that we can look at in a manner and think well this does this is a no-brainer this doesn't need to be prayed over everything needs to be prayed over let me give you an example just be like a man who has a gift as a pastor and here's a church that's wide open and needs a pastor it does not mean that's a no-brainer what it means is it means he's got to find God's will because it doesn't matter if he is a pastor and that church is without a pastor if it's not God's will it'll never work so this is why I'm saying we don't make presumptions we don't even make assumptions the message of the hour never led us away from seeking after the things of God for the Bible said that the sons of God are led by the spirit of [Music] God oh my I'm trying to get somewhere brother BR says I would just wait upon it and say Lord now you show me what's the decision to makeen amen you got to be open to being disappointed for what you want what I want but see once we've been redeemed we no longer want our own choice true amen we want we want his choice right and then the way you feel led to do it just wait a little bit and wait a little while longer and see which way which side you lean towards which way the spirit now father say it like this you know it doesn't matter but I want you to know what I want I want to know what you want to do about it now you can't just say that now you don't don't you know it don't matter and down deep on the inside it matters right it's got to come to a spot it doesn't matter this is where when we have been redeemed we can come to the place to realize his NOS are just as good as his yeses right amen that's the way I do about meetings sometimes I kind of feel to go this way or that way then I'll follow that day and that's the way to do it in prayer and then you're doing the best you can now how many remember when you know Paul brother Bram refers to this how that with Paul and them they were going on a missionary journey and they were at a Crossroads Paul they were looking at where where do we go do we go into Maia or do we go into Asia where where where do where do we go do we uh go into Macedonia which way do we go we don't know which way to go now let me just say this to you Paul and them did not go and sit down somewhere alongside the road and just say well I'm just going to wait on an answer to drop here now be very careful now but how how was approached the Bible said in verse 7 that they were come to myasia they assayed that means they tested to go into bethenia but the spirit suffered them not this is what I want you to catch it'd be like you know for um a young person going into school and they maybe don't know exactly what what direction to go do I go this way or do I go that way well let me just tell you there's General electives that'll take care of about your first two years and then then you have these roads setting before you and you know what you can begin to test it taking a certain class right here and you know what but always always be open to the Holy Spirit to say no this is not the way I want you to go always be open this is what Paul was saying let me just say it like this you always we always want to be open for our plans to be interrupted is that right I Lord God you know as much as my plans or something might be s but it's always open to Divine Interruption my and they passing by Masia came to troas and a vision appeared to Paul in the night and there stood a man of Macedonia and prayed him saying come over into Macedonia and help us and after he had seen the vision immediately we endeavored to go into Macedonia assuredly Gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the go goel unto them and this is where the Prophet said I believe if you are making a decision for God and you do it the best you can I believe God will correct you and see that you don't go wrong I believe God will do it see this is a rest but it's always within everything I want to be open to him amen I mean you know I and look at I like even when sisters and many many more time any more with brothers too my Lord you know you go into clothing racks too I mean you know you got sissies brothers that are designing your clothes a lot of times you know they they like them so good on themselves they want to see them on you so you got to really pray about what you're what you're and even just as much as the sisters and things you got to pray because there's spirits that are there on those racks and things that would want to get you to compromise a little bit and compromise a little bit and compromise a little bit I I think this is where we have to have the strength of the holy spirit in our life and say God if there is a question about it the prophet made it clear if it's a question about it don't do it don't do what this nation does one thing that's different about our nation they'll let stuff come in commer and then prove that it's bad to get it taken off they don't do that in other nations right true it's true I'm not making anything up it's that's true that's why when you go to Mexico you can go from this side to that side and when you go down there you can I could buy a bag of chips in Texas and buy the same bag of chips in Mexico and in Mexico they will not allow all that stuff to come in there's only like two or three ingredients I'm not making this stuff up and it's another na but you see what it is this is why we don't want to walk by that way of just well you know I got a question about if you got a question the prophet said don't do it that's one way of overcoming any hindrance in your life amen amen if it's all right you know what God will bring it around and show you it's all right but I don't want to presume that it's all right and then my life become entangled and hindered amen I would rather do without and be walking with him than have and be hindered in my walk with God this was let me just drop a few things here of where I'm where I'm going this is why we don't want our own opinions he's he's the one like the prophet said we've got to let him be the supreme ruler in our life this is what the Holy Ghost comes to do you know when God comes into your life you you accept the Lord as your lord and savior you repent of your sins this is where he's come in to the welcome mat of our home but there's doors all throughout our Liv life and those doors is every compartment in every area of our life that God wants to go into yes now he can he'll stand there as our savior right there on the welcome mat but we've still not been fully redeemed we still got a carnal mind right but you see the way what we must do is is let him go to every single door you know the very first door that he'll come to deal with is the door of Pride cuz the door of pride is what started it all in the beginning that's where the fall came right in heaven was because Satan desired a more beautiful kingdom is that right Satan preached a rebellion in Kingdom he it was a church split that took place is that right he drew a third part of the Stars after him and those Stars remember the same thing that we look at and recognize that the angels of God are ministering Spirits let me tell you those demons were one time regarded as angels of God and they still have their Angelic hierarchy when they fail they didn't lose their position right is that right when that was a Prince of Persia that one had always been an overseer that withstood Daniel the Prophet when that was taking place and that Maniac in Oregon came up there and he made his way to the platform and remember the Holy Spirit accepted his challenge you know what Satan's desire was to do was to put a hindrance in that meeting but one man Hallelujah one man let me let me preach now all it takes is one vessel Hallelujah that's right brother ra said you give me one man that's on fire for God it'll do more than 10 days of Revival all it takes is a surrendered vessel and a surrendered vessel is yes Lord yes Lord yes Lord yes to your will yes to your word Lord amen and the spirit of God came in there and accepted the challenge and that demon that was anointing that man that demon that he worshiped remember he wasn't delivered because he worshiped it right right right but that demon was the chief over that tribe of demons where people were in CS and they were bound here and bound there but when they saw that Chief demon defeated the sickness and diseases this is why sickness and diseases it's Devils it's demons Satan brings diseases but God's Army is commissioned to cast them out let me tell you the the chief has already been defeated amen we're not worshiping uh uh a Jesus of 2,000 years ago he is standing in plain view as the mighty conqueror who rent The Veil and to he's come down to manifest his word manifest his promise he's here to meet the challenge of the enemy amen amen oh glory be to God we want him to be the sueme ru supreme ruler he him be over our opinions over our emotions over our ideas control every fiber of our thinking Hallelujah I want everything turned over to him amen hallelujah I tell you what just invite him into every room maybe maybe you're sitting here this morning a and you just accepted him in as Savior why don't you invite him and say Lord go through every door of my life Lord go through the door of Pride go through the door of Faith Lord go through every door listen friends I don't believe that God is just here to make a a One-Stop tour but God himself he comes to live and dwell in his children Lord I want you to feel every fiber of my being Lord walk through every door of my life Lord if my Faith's a little weak Let It Be operated on by the power of the Holy Ghost if my pride needs put in check Lord let it be put in check you know God assisted Paul with Divine assistance lest I should be lifted up is that right now I want you to think about this this is why when for hindrances one of the things with a hindrance and how that when you look at it when Elijah came to the offering in the evening time He restored the altar he rebuilt repaired the Bible says the altar right that word repair is Jehovah Rea our healer he repaired the altar healing was brought back and then everything the wood that was laid upon the altar the sacrifice and just to let them know there is no hidden trick here right there isn't a private thing in my ear and somebody telling me about somebody on the platform let's pour water over the whole thing 12 barrels full it wasn't no man-made fire but there came down a fire from God and consumed the sacrifice and I want you to hang on to this now and I'll get to this in a moment but this is what Elijah said when he prayed he came near The Altar and he says Lord God of Abraham Isaac and Israel notice not Jacob not shyer there was a Clarity there was a confidence there was no condemnation he knew where he was standing on God's word everything was in order and of Israel and let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel and I am thy servant and that I have done all these things at Thy word we want to be doers of the word don't we amen I've done it all at your word Lord just exactly what it was called for you know when we look at this in being of a doer of the word of God it you know it requires let me let me just say it like this as we were referring to Jesus in the Garden of Eden it isn't that everything is simple and it's easy but it but what it is it's us being submissive to the voice of God Amen I I want you to think of this right here that within the sacrifice and and the laying down constantly the laying down of our own will you know the Bible said it like this in Revelations 10:8 it said go and take that book and he said I went and I took the book that was open in the hand of the angel that little book and I ate it and in my mouth it was what sweet as honey but in my belly it was bitter once it got once it made its way down oh it was sweet and oh how wonderful but you see the word in order for the word to live it's got to come down on the inside and when the word gets down on the inside there's a power there to break that word down and make it live in our life it has within it the nutrients and the vitamins and the power to live a Victorious Life let me tell you something friends I don't care what you're dealing with today if you give yourself to feed fully on the word of God don't mince around like an ODB tray but feed on the word of God it'll change your appetites it'll change your life it'll change Styles it'll break habits that's the power of this word if you feed on it it'll give you strength to fly yes always presenting ourselves our bodies as a Living Sacrifice not my will thine will be done Lord that your will is what I want because in our text halting when Elijah asked the question why halt you between two opinions and I tell you friends before God come on the scene that's all they had was opinions that's right but when God comes on the scene we're no longer looking at opinions we're seeing the very thoughts of God are you hearing me this message that God has sent us is not the opinion of a man this message let me just say how the prophet said it he said oh to than tonight the message of the hour the express thoughts of Jehovah Hallelujah it was straight coming from God's mind that's what a prophet is a prophet's not just a preacher even though in the New Testament a modern day Prophet or prophesy one who is a preacher but God made a promise that before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord he would send Elijah the prophet and a prophet is a Seer a prophet is a Divine interpreter of the word of God brotherr when God took a hold of this word through Malachi 4 they were selling this word like nobody's business and we don't need this anymore and God really don't mean that and this don't mean that but God came down Hallelujah and in the ministry of Malachi 4 Luke 17 and 30 Revelations 10:7 God walked and he took the word he took the seals off of it and he begin to take the bow of the word of the predestinated promises and plan of almighty God and he saw brought to you and I the value of the word has not diminished but Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever I am God and I change not we have been delivered from the schools of man's [Applause] opinions Hallelujah and we're not going back just like where I firmly stand someone says this is Brother bram's opinion where does that end all you're doing is troubling your congregation where does that end where does that end then what happens that man becomes the absolute of the people and God never intended that to be the word is always to be the [Applause] absolute but halting sometimes sometimes we we can be guilty of halting it's okay if you get quiet on me it's all right we're we're here to minister and help right okay I'm right in here with you sometimes on halting there's things that God can be moving and dealing with and and yet sometimes we'll halt on it and kind of hold back on it and moving on it you know you get out from underneath God's presence and I tell you the enemy already starts to attack yeah he already starts to attack your mind starts to attack things and he Satan always wants to try to tear down or get you away from what God is wanting to do in your life now you know when we are halting within this let me give you just a few examples here brother Ram talks about a man who was a member of brother Bosworth's church and this brother had a radio program and on this radio program you know he reaching many people doing a wonderful work for the Lord but you know he he had come into a place to where there was a sickness that be to strike his body and when that sickness was striking his body he you know he was thinking that it was tubercular but brother BR said what it actually is it's puracy pains in your side and he says now he said the doctor couldn't tell you that he said but there he said now or the doctor could you know he could no doubt speak that to you but here's something the doctor can't tell you you're halting between two opinions you think that you're serving God and want to do it by keeping this broadcast like this but you've got a call and you want to go in the ministry I said the thing that I would advise you to do was forget about the broadcast and get out there on the Harvest field see what a word come to do it come now Discerning that of what God's dealing with in his life to break that halting between opinions I this is why I'm so thankful for the living word of God then when you and I can come and sit right here and we can be between two opinions and you know here we are sitting here and then you know what God might bring in somebody that you don't even know or where the devil can't even get in your mind that oh brother Samuel said this or he might have told him this or he might have told him this I mean you know you you many of you you brought people here to church some of you I know one time you know and there was a family that came here one of the many times they got to looking at one another and then looking at their son who brought him here and thought who told him all this stuff about our life nobody it was God that was Discerning their hearts have no idea of those things but it's God that's Discerning our hearts and let me tell you something God doesn't do that to shame us he's letting us know that the I am the allseeing eye is right here Among Us is to recognize him and oh give everything give our life surrender all to him amen let me just say it like this deals are in hindrance when Rebecca elzer came to get Rebecca she watered the camels nobody had to tell her this she matched the vision of what Abraham had been asked to pray for what Abraham told of elzer elzer prayed according to what Abraham said see elra didn't have to tell her hey I think you look good for Isaac do this if it's God's choice God will always make known his choice God was David's choice and David didn't have to go around posting about it right nobody knew about it it was David's secret it was a secret coming David's character was being molded by that secret coming of that anointing it was molding him for the throne now yes that's right when Rebecca here it comes time to this moment remember her her brother her mother said hey why don't you all just stay here for at least till the tribulation 10 days that's right why don't you just stay here I mean it's it's all right I mean everything's good right here I mean look we've got gifts operating he gave them gifts right and they were happy with the gifts they were happy with gifts Pentecost was happy with gifts is that right Pentecost didn't want the word when the word begin to come across they didn't want the word but it wasn't the promis that we were going to stay in a shf and the promise was is that the seed would not be air with the shf [Applause] amen and so here it was you know uh you know elaser spoke up and said don't hinder me right sometimes you've got to you have to that's a one way of overcoming hindrances is when things are put our way is I'm not hinder me God has made my way prosperous God has confirmed this all along God opened up this door right where I'm standing right now don't hinder me hallelujah amen sometimes friends that hindrance has to be of us saying no to things that take us away from God's program are you with me it all it comes down don't hinder me don't hinder this this is why within everything the word must have first place in our life the words got to be first place brother Bron deals with here a lady let me just read this to you there's a lady he says oh you've got a trouble and it's nervousness you're upset a mental distress you're fating between two opinions and what you must do in life yours is not a sickness you have a child don't you it's a boy and you're having family trouble at home and you don't want to divorce in your family you don't want to do it and you're not from the city you come from Michigan he says there's only one thing that you can do that's believe on the Lord I'd advise you one thing to do go receive the baptism of the spirit live for God all your life and everything will work just right now watch this he says Lord as he prays be merciful to this woman God may she receive the Holy Spirit and may all of her troubles leave and I bless her for this purpose in Jesus Christ's name that the baby may be raised in a Christian atmosphere both father and mother filled with the spirit now her husband's not there he said now your husband isn't with you but when you go home I trust to God that you'll find it different are you ready to believe you will now just just as you believe I I know he does I know he's not knowing un believe but I say when you go home you're going to believe you're going to find things better he's going to receive you and things you believe that as you have believed that's just the way it'll be right now let me say it like this these are things that even advice and counsel that even that I've you know had to had to give and I I'll just say it like this you know my aunt my Aunt Linda who went on home to be with Lord when she first come here and you know God dealing with her heart and her life and God had really just done a further work in her life by the Holy Ghost and you know that the very desire within her heart is that there would not become a divorce within that home and there were times where you know here after preaching on a family service her and I would have a meeting in the office and she's not here and this is he's all he's already he's not here either but I I'm just saying this to you so you can relate to this a little bit you know how the enemy he would just so upon her mind and she said am I failing am I am I just throwing in the towel and and frankly to tell you the truth I can't even go into the things that the way things were done for over the years of such abuse and mistreat and everything else and I I I believe that my uncle at least when I went to that funeral that he that that they had for him and at the church that they said he had given his life to the Lord and I just said God thank you I trust that you know that he he come to accept you as his Lord and Savior I don't know whether he did or not but I I know this where I'm saying it in this way is that it come to a spot that she could no longer stay there in those conditions the way they were and God did not falter there's scripture for that but in this situation this is why God is Sovereign in all of his ways it's not us taking the word and I'm going to will the word to be this way that's not Faith amen we don't will the word to happen a certain way faith is a divine revelation of God's will is that right and so with this notice just just just receive the Holy Ghost and everything else will come in place I tell you if there if that isn't a real true uh uh direction for our lives just put God first in everything and everything else will come right into place friends listen this is where the church has got off and I'm not throwing off on churches I I'm not throwing you understand what I'm saying when they got away from the program that God sent down and that was repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost this is why the churches have got to have so many self-help programs because they've rejected the Holy Ghost but it'll never be man helping man not by might not by power but by my spirit says the Lord we don't need more education we need more of the Holy Ghost it's the holy ghost that come Among Us it's the Holy Ghost that's the answer and he is the word yes amen oh glory be to God hallelujah man I just got to move on that's why we want to act upon the word I'm trying to get to a point here bless Lord when Phillip was taken away from that meeting in Samaria and was told to join himself to that Chariot where that where that unic was at of Candice the queen he was reading in Isaiah 53 but he didn't understand what he was reading Philip asked him said do you understand what you're reading he said how can I except some man should guide me and Philip began on that particular scripture begin to preach unto him Jesus and as they're coming along the unit looks and sees water it w Philip that was persuading him to be baptized the unit saw water and said hey hey hey hey here's water what does hinder what's hindering so acting upon the word is an overcoming of hindrances Amen just act upon God's word let me tell you how you begin to act on God's word you know how many knows how the prophet tolds Us in the message the token full obedience to the word of God entitles you to the token right there's no way you can fully obey this before the Holy Ghost has come he goes on to tell you what that means full obedience is acts 238 repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah that's full obedience to the word of God and all these other things will be added unto you act upon God's word don't wrestle with it act upon God's word when God is dealing with with your heart when he's speaking to our lives friends listen don't don't draw back on it but act upon the word Lord what what what's hindering me the things he's dealing with me you don't even have to wait till the end of the service amen I believe in alter calls I believe in coming to the altar but friends I'm what I'm trying to say is as the word is coming forth you don't have to wait right there if there's something that strikes Your Heart Right There make it right am Surrender Your on right there Lord I lay it down right here Lord God act upon the word what's hindering me what an atmosphere you're standing in an atmosphere to be able to move upon God's word let me just deal with this point before I come to a close here I'm coming but remember and I want to just draw your attention to this the purpose of God becoming one of us was for Redemption and Redemption means to bring back what was lost the Reason God through Redemption is God was making known the purpose was that he might be manifested through our lives this is what why he had to be the perfect lamb this is why he went to Calvary this is why his blood that was shed could not be that which was mixed with blood that was already here he was not of Mary was not of Joseph God created that blood cell amen cuz every other blood was contaminated that's right God come down to to pay the ultimate price but through that price being being paid he displayed to you and I what God intended us to be this is why just even the law could never display it the law all of it even though he took on his own laws but the law itself could not display him right but when he came he who was the word he displayed all that he was and all that you and I as a son and daughter of God are to be God listen in the end time God brought a message in the end time which is the fullness of the word right here Among Us the Living God to do what display himself of what he has called Sons and Daughters of God to be God didn't leave it to some figment that's why the prophet said in Rising of the sun he said it was going to take more than just pictures of an eagle right it took a living Eagle to fly amen it took the eagle took Jehovah eagle flying over and when he flew over he showed that he was Jehovah of the old is Jesus of the new he showed I'm the same yesterday today and forever and you know what he did with his wings he has bore us unto himself we have been lifted out of sin lifted out of Doubt lifted out of condemnation thank you this is where it brings us to to act upon God's word and that can never be lost Satan's desire was to break that reality right and always just put it back to where we're looking just back to the Cross but without the substance of what the cross made a way for us to have the calvary made a way for us so that we might be born again in Calvary made a way so that that same God might come in and dwell within our life that it might be God displaying himself through our lives are you with me amen now with that hindrance there just stay with me just a minute here God's desire is to deal with hindrances sometimes we've come in this life and Satan has wanted to try to jam up every channel and every way to stop the expression of a seed but let me just tell you this it didn't matter all this concrete they've poured out there if there's a seed that's underneath there it's going to come right is that right I don't care what you put over it if there's a seed there it's going to come how many how many of you remember Georgie Carter brother Ram talks about that well Georgie Carter here she was in bed and she was she was dealing with uh I believe it was tuberculosis but you know how she got that onset here her uncle was taking her to piano lessons and her uncle molested her and when that happened brother Bram tells that and when that happened one place in the message he goes into it and when he when what happened within that now here she is there's a hindrance there that Satan has wanted to put in her life now come on friends we're living with things that are real yes true and notice here she was but there was a seed down there on the inside she had heard what had happened to the nail girl brother Howard Nail's daughter over there how she had been healed and got up out of the bed and she got a hold of that little track and she be to believe and she heard there was going to be a baptism there and remember it was the spirit of God that brought that attention to the prophet where he heard that little call of that lamb calling come to M Town that little lamb was caught in the Briars she was caught in that which had happened to her as just doing just some months a few years back she was caught in doctrine that said God don't heal the sick no more she was caught in all kinds of Bramble Hallelujah but God rich in Mercy he found [Applause] her even when her mother was against brother brandham she was hearing brother brandham was in town and her mother was all upset here she is getting in my daughter all upset and looking at this going on and all of a sudden she's directed to look at that shadow on the wall and what she sees as a shadow is the shadow of the Lord Jesus and it says who's coming there and about that time she sees brother brandom's profile Hallelujah and here as a she goes to tell to her daughter here brother brandom comes walking in at the same time God works everything out just on time Hey listen friends don't let that stumble you he has no hands but your hands he has no feet but your feet he is divine we are the branches is that right and he comes in there and brother Bram says oh I know he says as it struck me at that moment and I said Georgie carner the Lord Jesus has healed you brother Ram said why I said it even not even thinking about it but as it came out and that was spoken he said all of a sudden here she came up out of that bed Hallelujah her mother fainted now listen to this Hallelujah the first thing she did was go outside and begin to kiss the ground and after kissing the ground she went over and got on the piano normally anybody that's had a tragic experience like that wouldn't want to go near a piano come on because of what happened to her has a little girl but I wish listen to me now I'm not telling you this dig up old stories I'm telling you this because the power of God is so great it's able to break the Tormentor hold upon your life yeah it's able to break and Destroy hindrances where the enemy has wanted to put hindrances in your life you're not some trotting down something you are Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah she went and sat down and began to play the sour phenician woman she had a lot of hindrances when she came right lot of hindrances Jesus said it's not me for me to take the bread and cast it under dogs right even the disciples tried to stop her when she finally came through see I wonder what if what if what if it had been you and I he called me a dog but you see what faith will always admit the word is right right amen you don't want to wear your faith on your shoulders you want Faith you want God's faith in your heart you don't want to walk around with a chip on your shoulder you want you want Faith to be in the right place come on friends because when what he said what he said was true she said Lord what you're saying is true but the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from the master's table she got beneath the word she had a lot of hindrances right but Faith didn't have any right now let me come to my point here and I'm going to close there's a difference between hindrances where Satan is trying to hinder because Paul wrote of this in other places how Satan wanted to hinder them from coming and you know what Satan can't hinder anything from taking place unless God permits it right amen cuz sometimes go what God's revealed it's for a set and purposed time is that right now to think there's a difference between where Satan is trying to hinder and things that are spiritually preventing further movement this is where I'm now I'm starting to just zero in here and I'm only going to deal with this one point here just just a moment but this is where that when we look in our lives the scripture would talk to us about a perfect walk and I want you to think of this this this this phrase on a perfect walk with God the Bible tells us in Mark 11 verse 23 whatsoever you shall say unto this mountain this hindrance be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he say this is God's promise for our life but the key is is no doubt within our heart that's the key no doubt within our heart now I want you to think about this when Israel came into the land the prophet says it like this he says and now after you're in talking about being in the promised land into that of the Holy Ghost into that of God's word in that don't mean that you're out free from war you still have to fight for every inch of ground to stand on Canaan did not represent the great Heaven because it's war and troubles and killings and fightings and so forth but it did represent this that it must be a perfect walk right brother Bram says this this is where the church is failing today on that walk did you know that even your own behavior cannot somebody else out of getting healed your misbehavior of unconfessed Sins Of You Believers can cause this church to bitterly fail and at the day of judgment you'll be responsible for every bit of it oh you say now wait a minute brother R well that's a truth so where Satan would want to hinder is here when it comes on unconfessed sin right and when you think of it but I want you to think with me just a moment I'm I'm coming down but how could that dwell there how could unconfessed sin dwell you know brother BR he brings he takes a whole message on and showing us why the word it is here it ought to be working in a certain way right but one of the reasons he said and the main reason is not is because a lack of an honest confession a true repentance he said now what if I did something to my wife wife and he said I walked up to my wife and said hey girl brother says it like this hey girl you know hey how you doing you know I didn't mean to you know I I didn't mean brother Bram said she wouldn't know whether I was joking or I was serious he said we've got to be sincere in our confession repentance is a matter of the heart it's a condition of the heart it's not just it's not just sorry I I I believe I listen I believe in saying sorry but repentance has got to be a condition of the heart and when it comes from the heart it'll show itself in humility it because it's humble because the humility has been humble to the word of God on the inside we don't want to hold you don't want to hinder God from working in your life remember remember when brother BR came around the Pentecostals and brother BR says here they are he said and they're wearing shorts and doing this and doing that and he says and then they speak in tongues he said you try to tell them they don't got the Holy Ghost why they were basing their experience on gifts instead of the word gifts are a part of the word but gifts are never to be the basis of our acceptance before God a man listen man standing right here I we just get it right at home they right setting right in here men that many have known even preach camp meetings could preach like a house on fire right and then end up being all sorts of things whether it was that and brother BR seeing the man remember that one here was speaking in tongues and the other interpreting one was genuine and one was false right you see this is why friends this is why we are brought to a word experience and a word experience don't reject the gifts but a word experience never puts experiences above the word amen amen is that right the prophet tells us he said the reason for all the confusion is because we have placed experiences above the word it doesn't mean that you you and I are not to have a supernatural experience it doesn't mean that there aren't experiences but never should that ever be the measuring line it's the word the plum line is that right that's the difference with the bride of Jesus Christ she's a word bride through and through and with that how could how could something come in that way you know because when things have to be confessed if you did something on your husband or your wife you can say well I made that right to God but like brother Bram took it he says you didn't sin against God you sinned against your marriage vow remember the woman who was a Sunday school teacher her husband was a deacon she came to brother brandham and she couldn't figure out why is my anxiety and all this like this my all this stuff all tore up why am I why am I mess brother BR said when the angel of the Lord comes I'm going to send for you he showed up and he sent mey go get her brought her in brought her to the house and they sat down in the den room in the office and the angel of the Lord revealed I see you was out with a gentleman and it was was in this color of a car and you were out as she screamed you know why brother BR said that's because that was hidden way down there in that subconscious what caused that to be hidden there minimizing it oh my minimizing it when Satan came to Eve what did he do he minimized it yay that God said You shall not surely die let me tell you friends you can't control sin sin will take you further away from God it'll take Christ right out of your life it'll affect your home it affects your walk with God come on now I want you I want us to thank about these things because the word is meant to work in every one of our lives and this is one of the hindrances that can be ever so present is unconfessed sin yes amen the Bible said if I regard iniquity in my heart God won't even hear my prayer aen this is what brother B's referring to aen buried the gold in his tent he buried the Babylonian garment yes he kept it hidden he kept it around this is why listen with everything Lord I don't want and we don't want to live a different life outside of here than what than what the word is calling for let me tell you there is a power to give you Liberty and victory amen is anybody with me on this there's a power to overcome on of these hindrances sir but oh how unconfessed sin how Satan wants to just get that in there and minimize it minimize it minimize it oh it ain't that bad it ain't that bad oh just a little bit here just a little bit there little bit here and finally all the little bits add up and everything begins to just pile and move around how many remember when brother brandham came under that pressure of the tax case remember that yes brother Bram said he had got all weary he was he was tired he was worn and they called the house and he ran out the door there and said tell him I'm not here is that right brother Bram then his wife when he come back in she said bill was that right he said sure it was I wasn't in here he said yet I knew knew I was wrong brother BR goes on to tell us he says see you've got to get everything out and live above everything because if not the Holy Spirit cannot work in our lives it becomes like like I was talking when I was showing you them pictures of something that's holding us back from going on where we need to go it's but it's to live clear it's to live free it's to live clear here if they're saying listen don't don't let things go by even in your home let everything be settled out in your home let everything let everything in your life if there's whatever the Holy Spirit would be dealing with your life don't let anything go hidden there's no such thing as a white lie they're all lies come on there's no such thing as a as a as a as well this this business deals okay everything has got to be up and up for that of a Believer why because we want to be a channel that faith can fall into this is an hour where for Faith to move within our lives and this is where we overcome hindrances is bring and expose the enemy when there's things that have come in and if there's things that's come in or that's been accumulated within your life listen friend this is where we need an honest examination right this is why the prophet says don't examine and judge your life by all the gifts he said but judge it by the fruits of the spirit that's what we judge it by Lord I want my life to hit in all cylinders but Sam if there's things that you've had to make right Absolutely I'll tell you right now let me just share this with you standing right here I wouldn't want to I wouldn't even stand right here if I knew there was something between my wife and myself I wouldn't do it I don't want anything between me and my boys between me and my wife this needs to be a Harmony if I'm going to speak to God's people I don't just do it because I'm speaking to God's people whether I was a pastor or not I don't like I don't like those things you know why I'm a Believer aren't you a Believer don't you as a Christian you like peace don't you I love peace I like peace within the home that that's that that's what my desire is is is peace but there's got to be that even among us as Believers Lord I don't want anything to hinder I don't want anything to hinder remember when Israel I close here remember when Israel went into the battle they lost that battle at AI right and they lost it because of unconfessed sin God never forsook his promise but Israel got away from God and that's one of the things within our lives Lord continue within our lives let it just be something in our hearts Lord I want to stay in that place of an honest and open confession with you let it be clear because then God can continue to deal and work in our lives and the word comes into manifestation through our lives that's the victory that's overcoming hindrances do you love him let's stand let me read this scripture to you here powerful he that coverthe and forsaketh them Shall Have Mercy that's what I want I want Mercy hallelujah amen each day of Our Lives it's dying daily yes to self Lord keep me Sanctified am keep me Sanctified Lord keep my life clear if you feel something's just not something's just not right just just wait on that just just say Lord I'm just going to wait on you Lord notice confesses and forsaketh turns complet completely away from what a promise we have if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us I wish I had a whole service on this part and I say that because that's what the word comes to work with and deal with in our lives it comes to break holds it comes to break things sometimes that are just there are some of those hindrances and sometimes those things can get right in there and it's things we can start minimizing and if you minimize it friends it'll just grow and it'll hinder right things will start working and start moving and say God let me just say it like this this is where we just want to just let it be right here Lord I give myself to a be a fully examined by you I don't want to take my thoughts I want to take your word Lord when you go you go into an MRI I've went into an MRI you know what all you can do is lay there and they scans you all the way through is that right and there's things when they go in there to scan you like when they went in to scan over a year ago when I had to they thought it was a kidney stone but they wanted to make sure that's what it was on the on the write up and the report it didn't only talk about kidney stones but it talked about if they found anything with a bone here or there and the lumbar and they found other things that were also was around that area that's how we want the word to do don't we lord I want you to search me if there's something that's not right if there's something that I'm if there's something that I'm holding in my life show it to me Lord amen if there's something that that I need to make right show it to me Lord I Want to Be Right I want to be available I want to be Rapture Ready I want to be ready to go in a twinkling of an eye I want to be ready when that Faith drops for that moment I want to be ready I want to be in position Lord take all unbelief Lord anything Lord that's unlike you Lord cleanse out completely Lord hallelujah is that your prayer amen could we just go to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father Lord how we are depending upon you Lord there our scriptures Lord that you Lord Jesus we opened with here this morning to read we don't want to Lord halt we see Lord even how you would take examples where the Prophet would speak to different ones that even as believers they were halting between certain things to do one wanted Lord to just stay in that broadcast but you was calling him to Ministry another sister Lord that she needed help Lord God how Satan was attacking her nerves through that domestic trouble but you Lord you minister to her and let her know first things first for her life to be filled with the spirit of God and then you would give direction in her life Lord you would work things out according to your own counsel Lord Jesus we've been there Lord in those times sometimes Lord speaking right here we can be right in the middle of decisions like Lord we're looking at two paths which path do I take what I pray here this [Music] morning that father if there is choices which there are set here I pray that God that may you come Lord as you're here and move Lord upon hearts that they can see not just what's in front of them at the initial part of that choice but what the reward is or the wages at the end of that choice I pray father right here this morning Lord as we looked at Georgie Carter there for a little bit sometimes Lord there's lives that can be bruised hurt wounded scarred disappointed but father in this great great bag of your word you're still the Lord that Health all our diseases Lord I pray this morning may we not Lord God May their eyes not look at Lord what Satan has tried to maybe put across their path way but may you come Lord I pray God and renew their eyes this morning renew the vision like you did for Moses Lord Lord Jesus may they see that God you've never failed to keep your word and your promises Lord Lord Jesus granted Lord I pray May Lord God you bring healing Lord to those lives Lord in need of healing Lord whether it be physically spiritually emotionally Lord God I pray Heavenly Father may you Lord Jesus you bring down every hindrance Lord father search us here this morning Lord don't leave my heart out Lord Lord Jesus one man when aen put that wedge of goat under his tent he hid it Lord God it cost it cost Lord many men their lives it cost many of their lives Lord I pray when we when we come here together and not just when we're here but Lord when we're on our jobs when we're among our families when we're everywhere our purpose Lord the purpose of redemption is to manifest you Lord Lord that this word this character would so mold Our Lives to match your own glorious character that Lord Jesus just our life and our conduct our stand where we stand with conviction without compromise upon the word of God it becomes Lord a real testimony it becomes a life Lord that can be followed Lord we don't know we we don't we don't get to choose who we influence Lord but father I pray Lord may your spirit Lord God May the spirit of God just Lord Jesus search US Lord even after this this service is over lord May the same Holy Spirit Lord continue to search us out Lord if there's anything Lord that's unlike you if there's something that needs to be made right Lord with someone if there's something Lord God that's out of line Lord Jesus as your Prophet would tell us over and over when we know that we're wrong we automatically put ourselves out as Sinners but we want to live where there's no condemnation if our heart condemn us the Bible said you're greater than our heart but if our heart does not condemn us then we can have [Music] confidence oh Jesus this is where real faith is born Lord help us Lord as your children God I believe that I'm one of them I believe I'm speaking to Sons and Daughters of god father I [Music] pray May Lord Jesus anything Lord that's been minimized May Lord I pray it be shown for what it is Lord because it's your desire to reflect yourself through our lives Lord Lord I I don't want you just to reflect because it's just Lord to be a preacher that's that's not it Lord that's not it my calling is as a Son of God lord Jesus that to be of a Preacher a minister you put the gift Lord within me it's what you would use Lord as an instrument but the whole thing with the gift is been able to get ourselves out of the way but Lord that gift is not my walk with you my preaching is not my walk with you my pastoring pastoring it's not my walk with you my walk with you is a personal walk and then through that personal walk then then it will affect the ministry it'll affect Lord that of Pastor oh God help us help us Lord every one of us Lord that are in here Lord help us Lord as husbands as Fathers as grandfathers Lord gifts that would be among us Lord help us Lord to realize even more clearly Lord that our first calling above everything else is to walk as a son and daughter of God everything else is secondarily through that walk is what has an effect helps us to be sensitive as a husband as a father as a grandfather as a factory worker as a deacon as a trustee is any gifted special singer on and on he goes Lord Jesus help us Lord I pray I believe God that's what you're [Music] doing I thank you for your mercies Lord thank you Lord for leading us helping us Lord for as your children we want to overcome these hindrances Lord we don't want to make any deals we want to act upon the word of God grant it Lord I pray help us Lord may you Minister now Lord continue to every heart we love you amen don't you love him amen hallelujah go ahead lead us we have had enough of getting
