[23:58] since breakfast that day and I was kind
[24:00] of fainting and we waited and
[24:05] we was there one of the people that the
[24:09] hospital come and got us and said the
[24:11] doctor wants to see you and so we you
[24:15] know they put you in this little room
[24:16] where they can talk to you privately
[24:18] and there's the the doctor the
[24:21] anesthesiologist I think come out and he
[24:24] he can tell he was really upset and
[24:28] really nervous and he was saying you
[24:31] know they're working on her to get that
[24:32] out of her lungs he said that we don't
[24:36] he said it's so rare it happens but when
[24:39] when they started putting that back you
[24:42] know she lost her food so it went in her
[24:45] lungs and they was trying that you know
[24:50] I I really feel they was trying to save
[24:53] her life they bout we bout lost her
[24:55] there and you could tell by he he just
[24:58] went over things again and he was nurse
[25:00] so we were waiting and David his tummy

[25:11] finally said death I'm sorry I gotta go
[25:13] and I seen he was flush you know that so
[25:17] then then when they call me in and how
[25:22] wouldn't expecting that and here was my

[25:38] she couldn't no they didn't want to pull
[25:40] that out and she was unconscious of
[25:45] course that she was trying I guess your
[25:47] body you're trying to fight that you're
[25:49] trying to breathe on your own and get
[25:51] out of that and she was trying to pull
[25:53] up and all those machines was going off
[25:56] and all the noises as Megan and I was
[25:58] saved God faint my heart when you're
[26:02] someone and you come that close and 52
[26:05] years you become as one and I was just
[26:11] trying to pray and and I don't know
[26:14] everything but the phone rang
[26:16] all right and I it was brother Samuel
[26:19] and he said you're in there brother Dave
[26:21] and that's it yeah he said before you
[26:23] can put your hands on her and I said
[26:25] yeah I can't he said we're afraid you
[26:28] know God uses a body he can use any of
[26:31] his children and in time of trouble he
[26:34] knows what he's doing
[26:35] can I put my hands over it and the peace
[26:39] of God move in the room and I said no
[26:43] he's here it's gonna be okay
[26:47] and what a comfort to know in those
[26:51] times you can go to him and I'll tell
[26:54] you brothers try to you know you kind of
[26:58] take things for granted
[26:59] they're there for you they're there with
[27:02] you but when it comes something close
[27:04] like that you see you know you might
[27:08] lose that treasure and I know you'll see
[27:11] them again but it's just that it's hard
[27:16] to let them go and I went home and I was
[27:19] praying with all my heart
[27:20] I'm trying us I know we can't tell what
[27:23] God what to do but we can ask him he
[27:26] told us to ask and I was pleading as
[27:28] Lord you know how I need her prettiest
[27:32] pair cuz when I left they told me you
[27:35] can't stay in the in the you know all
[27:37] night indeed I see you they don't like
[27:41] for you to do that so that's okay I
[27:43] respect them and went home but I believe
[27:48] God answered prayer and I know she's not
[27:50] out of it yet but I know he C is true
[27:54] and you know we don't know what time
[27:56] he's gonna call on his home so this I

[44:56] [Music]
[45:14] [Music]
[45:36] we just thank God for His mercy this
[45:39] morning you know I couldn't help but I
[45:42] sit back there and I was listening to
[45:44] the testimonies that were being given
[45:48] and I thought of the testimony that my
[45:53] brother gave here on Thursday night and
[45:56] I called him brother Joshua because
[45:57] sometimes I get his name wrong and
[45:59] pronouncing it didn't you hadn't have to
[46:02] forgive me brother Joshua amen I love
[46:05] you I just I the testimony that our
[46:08] brother gained with right here that
[46:11] night and I just I want us as it has an
[46:13] assembly let us be mindful of what God
[46:17] is trying to tell him because you know
[46:20] sometimes when I'm going through and I'm
[46:22] studying things and I got studies
[46:23] sometimes just a vast number of and it
[46:26] just of looking at scriptures and quotes
[46:28] and they're just looking look and saying
[46:30] God what do you want I came across a
[46:33] quote which you are very familiar with
[46:35] and the Holy Spirit brought it back to
[46:36] my attention when you were giving these
[46:39] testimonies and when brother Joey made
[46:41] the statement here at the latter part of
[46:44] his testimony of how that by all laws
[46:49] that call should not have went through
[46:52] that call should not have went through
[46:54] you you could you can you can talk about
[46:57] it you can try to it should not have
[46:59] went through and my meeting in my heart
[47:01] went back to the testimony I was reading
[47:04] and brother Branham he he tells of this
[47:06] in the in the demonology series when
[47:08] he's preaching demonology part one then
[47:10] he comes around and he mentions it again
[47:12] in another message that he preaches in
[47:14] demonology and you remember the the man
[47:16] who had brought the baby and I just want
[47:19] you to see the sovereignty of how God
[47:21] will move sometimes the man had brought
[47:23] the baby with the brain condition and
[47:25] that and it it needed a touch from God
[47:28] and the man and his wife had sold things
[47:30] and they had done all that they could do
[47:32] in order to bring him to the the meeting
[47:35] to be prayed for and when they got him
[47:38] there here he comes upon the platform
[47:40] and the
[47:40] spirit of God begins to speak concerning
[47:43] the condition that is within this baby's
[47:46] life and as the Spirit of the Lord is
[47:48] speaking it says there is a doctor who
[47:51] can perform this surgery now you would
[47:55] look at that now how many times that God
[47:57] has moved and just miraculously healed
[48:01] the the lives of many that were bound
[48:05] with things but it's important to the
[48:06] details that the Prophet lays on before
[48:09] and afterwards as he goes through each
[48:11] time he tells it and what it was Mayo
[48:14] Clinic had told now Mayo Clinic it would
[48:17] be like I guess the equivalency of what
[48:19] brother John maybe Cleveland Clinic or
[48:21] or these other ones down in Maryland or
[48:23] wherever these other hospitals are that
[48:25] would be the equivalency so here God has
[48:28] it known that Mayo Clinic has said
[48:30] there's no way there's no operation that
[48:33] can be done on this baby
[48:36] no operation but the Spirit of God says
[48:39] there can be and the man walks off
[48:43] they're disappointed cuz brother Graham
[48:44] says I know you're not gonna I know
[48:45] you're not gonna like this see sometimes
[48:49] things happen and we don't like the way
[48:51] they're happening because it's not
[48:53] according to our expectations right but
[48:56] here God is showing that he's God
[48:59] regardless of the opinions and
[49:02] statements of man can make of all that
[49:05] they know and hear but the man is
[49:09] walking down the street brother Branham
[49:11] the Spirit of God let him know this
[49:13] would be this would be the color and
[49:14] this is the color of the man's hair
[49:16] black headed man the doctor and so forth
[49:17] so he's walking down the street and this
[49:19] woman you know she catches it and so
[49:21] forth and and here the woman comes up -
[49:23] oh what's wrong with the baby and
[49:24] everything and and so then the lady says
[49:27] oh she says I by the way she said
[49:29] there's a doctor it's out here in this
[49:31] country that right over here out in the
[49:33] country that performs that that surgery
[49:35] the man was not even catching and all of
[49:37] a sudden as the conversation goes on
[49:39] brother brems says then he caught it
[49:40] wait a minute what did you just say to
[49:46] me that's the greatness of God
[49:50] you see God is showing to us God not
[49:53] only has did it has declared himself to
[49:55] this generation that he's the faithful
[49:57] God but God is declaring himself over
[50:01] and over to you and I and I'll tell you
[50:02] this right now this is what I would do
[50:05] just like the Prophet said in in in in
[50:07] spiritual food in due season he says
[50:09] that we would accumulate these things
[50:11] into our life for that faith I would
[50:14] take these testimonies and whatever that
[50:17] might be that you might be facing or
[50:19] going through and I would begin to look
[50:20] at this and say God you are letting me
[50:23] know that even though the laws of the
[50:26] land and the laws of way things work
[50:28] with communication and everything like
[50:30] that but you're letting me know that
[50:32] nothing is beyond I believe that with
[50:37] all my heart and I and not just for me
[50:40] I'll speak that not just you know for as
[50:43] this assembly but I'll speak that for
[50:46] for myself as well I'm just setting back
[50:49] there and the Holy Spirit just really
[50:50] quick and then I thought you know Lord
[50:52] you didn't have me read back at cross
[50:54] because you know sometimes as I'm study
[50:55] and I have all sorts of thing all this
[50:57] will go in this study and outline things
[50:58] I may not touch to you know sometime
[51:01] later in things and that just that'd be
[51:02] one of those studies one of those quotes
[51:04] that I have that goes along with doctors
[51:06] medicines and surgeries of which I have
[51:07] a very large file and I'll just put it
[51:10] right you know I have two oh no I went
[51:12] to look oh no it's already in there but
[51:14] God knows you know friends that is no
[51:19] less glorious of what took place there
[51:22] and that little baby going through that
[51:24] surgery then for God to move right here
[51:28] there's not one that's greater than the
[51:30] other it's all God it's how we look at
[51:37] it sometimes that determines remember
[51:38] what we looked at on Thursday how you
[51:40] look at things sometimes will determine
[51:41] how you walk yeah is that right well we
[51:48] could probably just close up and say
[51:49] good to be here
[51:51] but I can't do that because there's no
[51:53] way I can hold this this Christmas
[51:58] wrapping may not look like much but I
[52:00] can't hold dinner amen let's look into
[52:06] the word of the Lord this morning it's
[52:08] so good to be here amen good to see I
[52:11] have visitors that are here god bless
[52:13] you see you in Ephesians chapter 2 verse
[52:19] 1
[52:36] and you hath he quickened who were dead
[52:40] in trespasses and sin where in times
[52:46] past you walked according to the course
[52:47] of this world according to the Prince of
[52:50] the power of the air the spirit that now
[52:53] worketh in the children of disobedience
[52:55] among whom also we had our conversation
[52:58] in pilots our conduct in times past in
[53:02] the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the
[53:04] desires of the flesh and of the mind and
[53:06] were by nature the children of Wrath
[53:09] even as others that would have continued
[53:13] but verse 4 but God who is rich in mercy
[53:18] for his great love wherewith he loved us
[53:22] even when we were dead in sins hath
[53:25] quickened us together with Christ by
[53:28] grace are you saved and hath raised us
[53:32] up together and made us sit together in
[53:34] heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in
[53:38] the ages to come he might show the
[53:40] exceeding riches of His grace in his
[53:44] kindness toward us through Christ Jesus
[53:48] for by grace are you saved through faith
[53:50] and that not of yourselves it is the
[53:53] gift of God not of works lest any man
[53:56] should boast
[53:57] for we are his workmanship created in
[54:00] Christ Jesus unto good works which God
[54:03] hath before ordained that we should walk
[54:06] in their delicious barns in a word of
[54:09] Prayer Heavenly Father we want to say
[54:13] Lord thank you this morning thank you
[54:16] God once again Lord for your mercy in
[54:19] your grace this day Lord Father we thank
[54:22] you that Lord God that in the face Lord
[54:25] of where we stand in this moment Lord
[54:28] where the world Lord would be
[54:31] celebrating Lord as it were Lord a
[54:34] Christmas Lord but father to us Lord
[54:37] even though we recognize Lord that this
[54:41] was not the time of your birth but yet
[54:43] Lord we are so thankful Lord that you
[54:46] said to us Lord
[54:48] gave to us the greatest gift Lord God
[54:51] that could ever be given Lord God and
[54:54] Father for this Lord we are so grateful
[54:56] Lord for truly Lord the peace of God
[54:59] Lord it passes all understanding Lord
[55:03] and we love you and we praise you this
[55:05] morning we just pray that God that you
[55:07] come Lord the great author of the book
[55:09] and would you come by our way Lord this
[55:12] morning each and every heart that's
[55:14] gathered here Lord and speak to us Lord
[55:16] God in Lord a very personal way we pray
[55:20] Lord we give ourselves to you now in the
[55:23] name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
[55:25] god bless you being seated I want to
[55:29] read you a hero out of the quote where I
[55:34] started last week and go into and go
[55:38] into a little part here this morning
[55:41] where the RAM says it like this and the
[55:43] God who is rich in mercy he said you
[55:45] once in times past were dead in that
[55:49] amazing we thought we were alive and yet
[55:52] there was a part that we were alive we
[55:54] were alive to those things of the world
[55:56] but yet as far as in we're in serving
[55:59] the Lord in really who we are we were
[56:02] dead you were dead even many here
[56:06] tonight one time can look back and know
[56:08] that you were dead but now why aren't
[56:10] you did tonight as you were then you
[56:14] deserve to be that way because she was a
[56:17] sinner but God who is rich in mercy and
[56:20] we looked at that last week we we don't
[56:22] deserve anything of all the great and
[56:27] wonderful so-called things that we could
[56:29] do still we do not deserve his favor but
[56:36] God who is rich in mercy and that's the
[56:38] thing God who was rich all these things
[56:41] that were but God that made the change
[56:45] right their God who is rich in mercy now
[56:47] this is where I want to draw from and
[56:49] I'm so glad for that that he being rich
[56:52] in mercy if he was just rich in money if
[56:55] he was just rich in materials which he
[56:59] is but yet the great
[57:01] thing is being rich in mercy all what a
[57:05] great word that is how that we once we
[57:09] were once dead that's what I want to
[57:13] look at here this morning just to start
[57:15] into this on the great richness of his
[57:20] mercy because when you think of this
[57:23] here the the word I just began to look
[57:27] at the word a richness and we know that
[57:29] the word rich that we read it means to
[57:31] be great and abounding and plenteous and
[57:34] richness itself is the state of existing
[57:37] in or containing plentiful quantities of
[57:41] something that is desirable in the air
[57:44] in david and this scripture i just i
[57:47] love the scripture the scripture is
[57:48] generally a part of when i'm praying it
[57:50] just comes out but the Spirit of God
[57:51] last Sunday morn and really begin to
[57:53] quicken this scripture to me it was I
[57:55] was in prayer and early in the morning
[57:57] and here David is saying it like this he
[58:00] says when this is when David was in the
[58:01] wilderness of Judah Oh God
[58:04] thou art my god David's letting it be
[58:08] known that in the face of every other
[58:10] god that is out there that others call
[58:13] god you are my god David said I know you
[58:17] and you are mine early will I seek thee
[58:23] he's the priority of my life my soul
[58:28] first is for thee my flesh longeth for
[58:31] thee in a dry and thirsty land where no
[58:34] water is isn't it true that when when
[58:39] and that connection in all things within
[58:42] our life is not right or when it would
[58:44] be hindered everything about our life is
[58:48] affected david is declaring this so
[58:52] notice where david david here he has
[58:55] faith to believe to see it this is where
[58:58] i am to see that power and thy glory so
[59:01] as i have seen thee in the sanctuary
[59:03] david is declaring that not only are you
[59:07] the god in the sanctuary but where where
[59:10] i am
[59:11] you are also caught David knew he's got
[59:15] there in the tabernacle but he's also
[59:17] God to me where I am in my need in my
[59:21] situation you believe that this morning
[59:24] that God is drawn to your need you
[59:26] believe that God when you have a need
[59:28] you have a request even what is not
[59:30] audible out of your lips but God the
[59:33] Bible says in Romans 8 that the spirit
[59:35] maketh intercession for our infirmities
[59:38] and maketh intercession with groanings
[59:40] that cannot be heard so to understand
[59:43] that how that God is drawn to even where
[59:47] our needs are weakness and that he might
[59:49] make himself known in verse 3 here
[59:51] here's where this is this I love this
[59:53] verse of scripture from there to us
[59:55] because thy loving-kindness is better
[59:59] than life my lips shall praise thee so
[1:00:02] my loving-kindness is better than life
[1:00:06] thus will I bless thee while I live I
[1:00:10] will lift up my hands in thy name this
[1:00:14] word as I was drawn to it you know I was
[1:00:16] in prayer early last Sunday morning and
[1:00:18] as I was praying the Holy Spirit just
[1:00:20] began to press on my heart and and you
[1:00:22] know that word loving-kindness and I
[1:00:25] thought man just never really thought of
[1:00:27] it now no doubt I probably clicked on it
[1:00:29] searched it out before but you know God
[1:00:31] has a way of making things amplifying it
[1:00:34] at the right time and the right season
[1:00:36] so when we look at this so this this
[1:00:38] word loving-kindness it's the word so we
[1:00:41] would call it maybe we would look at it
[1:00:43] and say it just said but it's actually
[1:00:44] said which means goodness kindness and
[1:00:48] faithfulness now I want to try to by no
[1:00:50] means a scholar within theirs but a much
[1:00:52] of the research of things that when I
[1:00:54] was looking at this particular word and
[1:00:56] looking at the very mercy of God because
[1:00:59] that is indeed where this word pertains
[1:01:01] to and when you look at God's mercy we
[1:01:04] know that when we we think of it of how
[1:01:06] that the very mercy of God and many
[1:01:08] times the view that is set forth within
[1:01:11] God's mercy of which we all need we all
[1:01:14] want God's mercy don't we
[1:01:15] I don't want God's justice I could never
[1:01:17] stand before his justice but yet God's
[1:01:20] mercy is not a
[1:01:21] powerless to wear that it's something to
[1:01:24] wear it's just one who looks at me and
[1:01:26] says you know what you're sorry you're
[1:01:28] no count you'll never be any good you'll
[1:01:30] never be better that's not the mercy of
[1:01:32] God but God's mercy is there that holds
[1:01:35] for me and is able to provide holding
[1:01:38] for me and provide what is needed that I
[1:01:41] might come into the reflection of what
[1:01:44] he is calling for in his heart is that
[1:01:46] Alright
[1:01:47] so when we look at this I was I was
[1:01:49] looking at some of the things that in
[1:01:51] regards to how that even with the new
[1:01:53] Hebrew the letters and the things that
[1:01:54] are regarded with this particular word
[1:01:57] and we know that one of the things that
[1:01:59] in the writings of where they'll go with
[1:02:00] this is how that God himself in the
[1:02:03] midst of it all gave precedence to the
[1:02:05] rule of mercy but yet in giving
[1:02:07] precedence to the rule of mercy God
[1:02:09] joined it with justice and with think of
[1:02:11] this of how the Lord Jesus was standing
[1:02:14] there when he came before the Pharisees
[1:02:16] remember they were so adamant about
[1:02:18] paint as on mint and cumin and anise and
[1:02:21] they were they were so adamant about
[1:02:23] certain things but Jesus was able to
[1:02:25] look down and tell him wait a minute
[1:02:27] you are omitting the lady or matters of
[1:02:31] the law so he was able to look and see
[1:02:35] that though that they were I'm doing
[1:02:37] this I'm doing this I'm doing this but
[1:02:39] yet they were limited in their ability
[1:02:41] to actually understand first of all not
[1:02:45] just the law we know they couldn't
[1:02:46] understand it without it really dwelling
[1:02:48] on the inside of them but yet they were
[1:02:50] so limited within it by just doing this
[1:02:53] doing this doing this they did not
[1:02:55] understand it in terms of who it was
[1:02:58] that the law him came from it came from
[1:03:02] God himself now we notice within this
[1:03:05] when we I want you to think of this for
[1:03:07] a moment that when you know the end the
[1:03:09] English of where that the words that
[1:03:12] will be used here in in the scriptures
[1:03:14] many times the words that will be used
[1:03:16] to try to convey God's mercy are the
[1:03:19] words of loving-kindness and you'll see
[1:03:21] mercies and merciful and faithful and
[1:03:24] all of these things that are used but
[1:03:26] yet knowing that God has a desire for
[1:03:29] righteousness does he not God has a
[1:03:31] desire just like you are
[1:03:33] with our children you have a desire and
[1:03:35] intended outcome for their life and in
[1:03:37] order for that outcome to come to pass
[1:03:39] there is going to require mercy but yet
[1:03:42] mercy itself is not without instruction
[1:03:45] mercy itself is without is not without
[1:03:48] correction but mercy itself noticed
[1:03:51] God's desire that his word would be
[1:03:53] lived by was so great his passion for
[1:03:56] righteousness is so great but to think
[1:03:58] of it that how that God's passion for
[1:04:01] righteousness was so great yet God's
[1:04:03] intent and passion for mercy was so much
[1:04:06] greater and because that was so much
[1:04:08] greater by his mercy then he can bring
[1:04:11] to pass what he desires and that his
[1:04:13] righteousness to come forth from your
[1:04:16] eye so it shows within us what a great
[1:04:18] thing that we can continue to look at of
[1:04:21] how that God has so coupled this
[1:04:23] together because when you think of it
[1:04:25] that even in as the writers would say it
[1:04:27] like this if there is even a remnant
[1:04:29] that's to be preserved God has to have
[1:04:32] had show mercy more than anything else
[1:04:35] and to think of how that within it you
[1:04:38] know when we look in the scriptures here
[1:04:40] and AD speaks in Hebrews 15 verse 13
[1:04:44] David or Moses said it like this
[1:04:47] thou in thy mercy hath led forth the
[1:04:52] people which thou hast redeemed thou
[1:04:55] hast guided them in thy strength and
[1:04:57] unto the holy habitation that promised
[1:05:01] that was laying there was a promise that
[1:05:03] had been laying there for for hundreds
[1:05:06] of years is that right then I'll visit
[1:05:10] them with a strong and mighty hand that
[1:05:12] promise in itself was the mercy of God
[1:05:15] and when God moves on the scene to
[1:05:17] fulfill that that is God stepping
[1:05:20] forward as it describes in the book of
[1:05:22] Luke chapter one that God is stepping
[1:05:24] forward to perform the mercy that he had
[1:05:28] promised to the father's this is God
[1:05:31] stepping forward in the very fulfillment
[1:05:35] of his word to fulfill his promise I
[1:05:38] tell you when the word is made flesh and
[1:05:40] the word is coming to pass
[1:05:42] that's God's mercy upon earth that's
[1:05:44] God's mercy because that murder
[1:05:46] see it's coming not because you and I
[1:05:49] deserve it but it's God that is common
[1:05:52] to fulfill his word and when God comes
[1:05:55] to fulfill that word he's come to
[1:05:57] perform it and there is a people that
[1:06:00] are intended to receive that word and by
[1:06:03] receiving that word then you and I
[1:06:05] become the vessels of God's mercy now in
[1:06:11] that mercy notice how he would describe
[1:06:14] that thou in thy mercy
[1:06:16] has led forth the people without which
[1:06:18] thou has redeemed so within mercy itself
[1:06:21] noticed this as we'll pick it up as we
[1:06:23] go along mercy itself is not just
[1:06:25] something that is given and where it's
[1:06:27] in a manner to where and you can do
[1:06:30] whatever you want but mercy itself is
[1:06:32] coupled with the desired intended
[1:06:35] outcome and it must be provided or
[1:06:37] leadership must be provided in mercy and
[1:06:40] it is OMA now notice this how that God
[1:06:45] would reveal himself to Moses in Exodus
[1:06:48] 34 and I'm so thankful to God when we
[1:06:51] look at this here of how this is such a
[1:06:53] parallel of what God will do and does do
[1:06:56] in each of our lives as we've looked at
[1:06:58] this I've made mention this passage of
[1:06:59] Scripture many times how God reveals
[1:07:02] himself to Moses here
[1:07:03] God did not have to reveal himself one
[1:07:06] more time to Moses for Moses to be
[1:07:08] convinced that that was the promise of
[1:07:10] the hour are you with me he didn't have
[1:07:12] to reveal himself one more time to Moses
[1:07:14] for Moses to say yep I'm the one yep I
[1:07:16] know I'm included in the promise he
[1:07:18] didn't have to do that he don't have to
[1:07:20] do that to you and I but he does it and
[1:07:23] he enjoys doing it what is that his
[1:07:26] mercy but he'll take down a word and
[1:07:29] he'll continue to show you his mercy his
[1:07:32] faithfulness
[1:07:33] he'll show you who you are again and
[1:07:35] again and again it is not for naught but
[1:07:38] as he is doing that in his bringing
[1:07:40] forth and closing faith and strength to
[1:07:43] build within your life to where you're
[1:07:45] actually able to stand there knowing who
[1:07:48] you are
[1:07:49] not by knowledge but by real faith
[1:07:51] because this is what he has said whole
[1:07:55] glory so God doesn't have to do this but
[1:07:58] God does this after Israel if we can say
[1:08:01] it like this has fallen short and you
[1:08:04] know I would say it like this when we
[1:08:05] look at it God even down through the
[1:08:08] ages the church ages of how God has
[1:08:10] dealt with the Gentiles calling out a
[1:08:12] people for his namesake of how that God
[1:08:15] would send a word and then the people
[1:08:16] would fall away from that word and then
[1:08:18] God then and then another age would come
[1:08:20] about it was all the very mercy of God
[1:08:23] sending his word to each generation for
[1:08:26] what for for those people who were
[1:08:28] ordained within that bed of time that
[1:08:31] they would be able to come forth that's
[1:08:32] the same thing in this hour as well
[1:08:35] except in this hour there is not another
[1:08:37] something to come about as far as
[1:08:39] another messenger we have received the
[1:08:42] last message this is time to go home so
[1:08:48] to see how God will visit Moses here in
[1:08:51] the midst of this and reveal himself to
[1:08:54] Moses now only want you to watch this
[1:08:56] here in verse five because he's going to
[1:08:58] proclaim the name of the Lord you see
[1:09:00] the name of the Lord is more than just
[1:09:02] just saying the Lord Jesus Christ well I
[1:09:04] believe in the Lord Jesus Christ there
[1:09:06] are attributes that are attached to that
[1:09:08] name it's more than jibun somebody
[1:09:10] saying I'm a Christian there are
[1:09:12] attributes that are attached to what is
[1:09:14] a Christian so notice in verse 5 here
[1:09:18] the Lord begins to reveal these
[1:09:20] attributes and the Lord descended in the
[1:09:22] cloud and stood with him there and
[1:09:25] proclaimed the name of the Lord and the
[1:09:28] Lord passed by before him and proclaimed
[1:09:31] the Lord the Lord God merciful and
[1:09:35] gracious long-suffering and abundant in
[1:09:39] goodness and truth keeping mercy for
[1:09:44] thousands forgiving iniquity and
[1:09:46] transgression and sin and that by that
[1:09:49] will by no means clear the guilty
[1:09:50] visiting the iniquity of the father's
[1:09:53] upon the children and upon the
[1:09:55] children's children under the third
[1:09:57] enter
[1:09:57] fourth-generation so God's mercy in
[1:10:01] itself is also given for that space of
[1:10:05] time we find that even where than in the
[1:10:08] Old Testament where the blood was put
[1:10:11] upon the mercy seat once a year is that
[1:10:13] right
[1:10:14] but then when that blood came off in
[1:10:16] that same seat that was a seat of mercy
[1:10:19] then it became a seat of judgment and
[1:10:22] there was a need for mercy or blood for
[1:10:25] an atonement to come forth once again in
[1:10:28] order to cover the judgment seat turning
[1:10:31] the judgment seat to that from judgment
[1:10:33] to mercy is that right so to walk in
[1:10:36] that period of time and to receive of
[1:10:38] the mercy of God to will come under that
[1:10:41] mercy and not be a part of the judgment
[1:10:43] that's the same way in this hour as well
[1:10:45] but notice these words of the words that
[1:10:47] are used in here the words in verse 6
[1:10:50] the Lord God merciful and the word as
[1:10:52] whereas I'm saying these words are not
[1:10:54] all the same words but yet they describe
[1:10:56] a depth of the very mercy of Almighty
[1:10:58] God the very word merciful that's used
[1:11:01] here there is the word that is raccoon
[1:11:03] which is compassionate always of God
[1:11:06] with one possible exception now you
[1:11:10] would look at this and you would think
[1:11:11] well don't we just need that of his set
[1:11:13] we do need his set we do meet his
[1:11:15] goodness we do need his faithfulness but
[1:11:17] yet we also need his wrath whom his
[1:11:20] compassion which is one of a possible
[1:11:23] exception see this is part of the
[1:11:25] richness the plenteous all of these
[1:11:27] parts that are composed within the very
[1:11:30] mercy of Almighty God because God
[1:11:32] remember the scripture said keeping his
[1:11:34] sin or keeping mercy and he's kept mercy
[1:11:38] for thousands so the Covenant is waiting
[1:11:40] there the Covenant he's keeping the
[1:11:42] Covenant he's not moving from the
[1:11:43] Covenant but we need the compassion of
[1:11:46] God to move on the scene in order to
[1:11:50] fulfill what mercy is calling for and
[1:11:53] it's all the great mercy of Almighty God
[1:11:55] you and I need compassion this morning
[1:11:58] you and I'm grateful to God aren't you
[1:12:00] I'm grateful to God you know how it is
[1:12:02] you can be aiming for the barn and as
[1:12:04] your
[1:12:05] for the barn you've got it all sided up
[1:12:07] and all of a sudden here you you fire a
[1:12:10] shot well that's like the equivalency of
[1:12:12] Brett Scott you go out of the service
[1:12:14] man everything seemed lined up and here
[1:12:16] you fire the shot and you end up not
[1:12:17] hitting your barn you hit the neighbors
[1:12:18] barn you need one of compassion you need
[1:12:23] one of the possible exception one that's
[1:12:26] able to stand there and not just say my
[1:12:29] goodness I thought you had it I but you
[1:12:31] need one who's hands on one with mercy
[1:12:35] who can have compassion hands on that
[1:12:38] mercy taking form and that mercy
[1:12:41] beginning to minister what is actually
[1:12:45] being called for to where what the mercy
[1:12:47] is in the Covenant then becomes
[1:12:50] reflected in our lives so we need that
[1:12:53] mercy of Almighty God and remember you
[1:12:55] and I cannot provide this we do not
[1:12:57] provide the the compassion of God we do
[1:13:00] not provide the mercy of God the only
[1:13:02] thing that you and I can do is
[1:13:03] reciprocate it that means we receive it
[1:13:06] and then it is given right back to him
[1:13:08] in the same measure that he has given it
[1:13:10] to you and I Oh Lord how many of you
[1:13:14] want God to be compassionate how many of
[1:13:16] you want God to be one with exception
[1:13:19] then say lord I won't stop my fall to my
[1:13:22] my foot again if you don't answer my
[1:13:23] prayer according to my need or the way I
[1:13:26] want it
[1:13:27] you see it's reciprocated back to him
[1:13:30] there right there so notice within this
[1:13:33] so think of how that God within himself
[1:13:35] he made a covenant with Israel he made
[1:13:40] this covenant with his father's as a
[1:13:41] matter of fact he told Abraham all the
[1:13:44] land where you see this land have I
[1:13:46] given to the enter thy seed afterwards
[1:13:48] God made it this shall be an inheritance
[1:13:52] for your see now it's God it's totally
[1:13:55] in God's hands to be able to bring the
[1:13:58] people from where they are to where they
[1:14:00] need to be
[1:14:01] that's reconciliation reconciliation is
[1:14:04] not just coming out of Egypt but full
[1:14:06] reconciliation is coming in to the
[1:14:08] promised land
[1:14:09] so reconciliation is actually the coming
[1:14:12] back and restoring a former harmony that
[1:14:15] once
[1:14:16] so when we see this of how that he is
[1:14:18] indeed Jehovah Jireh one who provides
[1:14:21] for himself how God would make a
[1:14:23] covenant with Israel as a whole nation
[1:14:26] and yet as we're reading this about
[1:14:28] Israel God would keep and have that
[1:14:30] covenant of mercy that mercy itself
[1:14:33] would be the faithfulness the goodness
[1:14:35] that which is there to ensure that that
[1:14:37] covenant remains intact and yet God
[1:14:40] knows that out of all of it there was
[1:14:42] only going to be a few that was actually
[1:14:45] out of the hole that he brought out of
[1:14:47] Egypt a few that would actually cross
[1:14:50] into the land but yet God said if it's
[1:14:52] only tell my mercy I will keep it for
[1:14:55] them very many if it's only two I show
[1:14:58] compassion to a law that I am
[1:15:00] controlling my compassion in order to
[1:15:02] bring about that which is there
[1:15:05] glory be to God sometimes it seems like
[1:15:08] let me tell you friends our compassion
[1:15:10] the mercy that is extending it has shown
[1:15:12] sometimes it seems like what's the use
[1:15:15] it seems like sometimes things are spit
[1:15:17] right back in your face you say what's
[1:15:18] the years leave that in the hands of God
[1:15:20] you never know friends the very action
[1:15:23] and the way that things have been taken
[1:15:25] that that can serve to minister to an
[1:15:27] individual what's how that that David
[1:15:32] would describe this David describes this
[1:15:34] so many different times in Psalm 78
[1:15:37] verse 37 he says for their heart was not
[1:15:40] right with him neither were they
[1:15:43] steadfast in his covenant but he being
[1:15:47] full of compassion forgave their
[1:15:51] iniquity how many of you want to be full
[1:15:54] of compassion right notice the very next
[1:15:58] word he being full of compassion it
[1:16:01] wasn't just something he's just got it
[1:16:02] all bundled up with whom he has a bunch
[1:16:05] of compassion it's just waiting there no
[1:16:07] no no no no no he's not just holding
[1:16:10] compassion but remember with his
[1:16:12] compassion because mercy like their
[1:16:14] Hebrew authors and different ones that
[1:16:16] I've studied what they read and you know
[1:16:18] Hebrew itself it is something that's not
[1:16:20] just words that's given by mine but it
[1:16:22] is active words it's actions it's things
[1:16:25] that depict
[1:16:26] pictures it's things that depict action
[1:16:28] and one of the things that the Hebrew
[1:16:30] authors and many of the rabbis that I've
[1:16:32] read and studied here that they would
[1:16:33] say is that the word itself has said
[1:16:35] that Wow but that is even set forth as
[1:16:38] the mercy of God it is not something
[1:16:40] that's just steadfast because that in
[1:16:42] itself would seem absent of love but it
[1:16:45] is not just steadfast it is the
[1:16:47] steadfast love of God there was nothing
[1:16:50] that Israel could do that could change
[1:16:52] God's love there is nothing that you and
[1:16:55] I can do that will change God's love
[1:16:58] even when you disappoint it even when
[1:17:00] you let him down but yet his love is
[1:17:03] steadfast he is faithful to his word
[1:17:07] glory be to God think of this think of
[1:17:10] this now being full of compassion he
[1:17:13] noticed the action forgave forgave but
[1:17:21] saying I'm full of compassion and you
[1:17:23] can't forgive you can't be full of
[1:17:27] compassion and not forgiving are you
[1:17:31] with me you see friends you got to make
[1:17:34] a choice whether you're gonna forgive or
[1:17:35] not forget forgiveness it's more than
[1:17:37] just you saying oh you know what I
[1:17:39] forgive you and I'll tell you what it's
[1:17:41] more than words it is an action that
[1:17:43] demonstrates itself toward you how many
[1:17:51] are glad that God demonstrates
[1:17:53] forgiveness toward us are you glad about
[1:17:55] that aren't you glad that when you go to
[1:17:57] pray the next time he don't say he's a
[1:17:59] little bit hesitant you see that's you
[1:18:02] and me
[1:18:03] that's not even today's message but
[1:18:06] that's you and me our memory but God's
[1:18:09] memory is the seat of forgetfulness
[1:18:13] but he being full of compassion forgave
[1:18:16] their iniquity and destroyed them not
[1:18:18] yay many a time turned he his anger away
[1:18:22] and did not stir up his wrath Wow full
[1:18:25] of compassion means self-control My Lord
[1:18:30] Jesus so being full of compassion by the
[1:18:33] senior that's the Old Testament
[1:18:34] Philippians chapter 2 verse 1 brethren I
[1:18:37] love that you would be what feel with
[1:18:39] what bowels of Mercy filled up with
[1:18:44] mercy not just having a little bit if we
[1:18:47] are his children and he is rich in mercy
[1:18:51] don't tell me that we're just barely
[1:18:53] making it don't tell me that we've got
[1:18:55] Scott about you know when it comes down
[1:18:57] to it when it comes down the mercy of
[1:18:59] God well God's got this much mercy but
[1:19:01] this is all I've got
[1:19:02] ha don't see that I don't see that if
[1:19:07] this is what's given to me then that
[1:19:09] ought to be what's reflected because I
[1:19:12] can only reflect what I am sure if God's
[1:19:19] faithful to his covenant to see it
[1:19:22] performed then when that mercy is
[1:19:24] received as divine compassion comes down
[1:19:27] upon my life then I will not be living a
[1:19:30] halfway life I will live according to
[1:19:32] the compassion that has come to minister
[1:19:35] his steadfast love to my life I will
[1:19:38] reflect back to him so I'm not
[1:19:43] reflecting another name
[1:19:47] I'm not reflecting another Jesus I'm
[1:19:50] reflecting the same Jesus are you with
[1:19:54] me my glory be to God for he remembered
[1:19:59] oh my Wow for he remembered that they
[1:20:05] were but flesh a wind that passeth away
[1:20:08] and cometh not again glory so he knows
[1:20:13] with his word now this is when we
[1:20:15] understand of where everything is that
[1:20:17] with Israel at this point that they have
[1:20:20] not make there's no way that they can
[1:20:22] receive what you and I now are made
[1:20:24] partakers of the the atonement the true
[1:20:27] Lamb of God has not come whereby that
[1:20:29] the blood being shed the sin debt put
[1:20:31] away and thereby his life can come upon
[1:20:34] us as the worshiper and raise us up into
[1:20:37] heavenly places by no means is this word
[1:20:40] or the scripture giving allowances for
[1:20:43] any behavior that is less or unbecoming
[1:20:46] to better the Christian well brother say
[1:20:50] no I just can't help it yes you can't
[1:20:51] help it what Allah saying I just don't
[1:20:54] yes you can you can say Lord Here I am
[1:20:57] weak but thou art strong Lord God Lord
[1:21:00] you can help me Lord and you know I'm
[1:21:02] the classical member you want him to
[1:21:04] remember who your flesh remember he's
[1:21:07] your God remember he's greater than
[1:21:10] every situation he's greater he is all
[1:21:13] that you have need of glory being a
[1:21:17] garden David picks it up again in Psalms
[1:21:19] 86 verse 15 but Thou O Lord art god full
[1:21:23] of compassion and gracious
[1:21:26] long-suffering and plenteous in mercy
[1:21:29] and truth
[1:21:32] oma so to think of this of how that God
[1:21:36] would even display this it's it's wrote
[1:21:40] of this even in Exodus 20 it's wrote of
[1:21:42] it you know even in a Deuteronomy here
[1:21:45] where it would speak of how that God the
[1:21:47] the requirements that God would lay down
[1:21:50] in his law in verse 9 and how that God
[1:21:52] is a jealous God and then in verse 10 it
[1:21:55] would speak of how that he shows mercy
[1:21:57] unto thousands of them
[1:21:59] love me and keep my Commandments so we
[1:22:03] understand that when we're looking at
[1:22:05] this you know a lot of times where it
[1:22:07] seems like in this age this is an age
[1:22:09] that doesn't want any responsibility is
[1:22:12] that right this is an age that you know
[1:22:14] if I'm robbing the store it's the
[1:22:15] policeman's fault for being there and
[1:22:17] catching me when I was robbing it
[1:22:18] you understand it did so in other words
[1:22:21] it's who can I find to blame for me in
[1:22:24] my condition I'll tell your friends
[1:22:27] that's a very damnable situation to be
[1:22:29] in yes it is because there must be that
[1:22:32] which we will take account for our own
[1:22:34] actions and for where that we are at and
[1:22:37] taking full responsibility for it
[1:22:40] now when we look at this of how this is
[1:22:42] set forth God never did away with the
[1:22:44] law it was not the doing away and saying
[1:22:46] no the law wasn't any good that's not
[1:22:48] true as Paul would say that the law is
[1:22:50] holy the law is spiritual the law is
[1:22:52] good but the problem of it was was not
[1:22:55] below itself
[1:22:56] the problem was is the grace of God and
[1:22:59] not calm to actually be able to bring
[1:23:01] what God had allowed to be inscribed
[1:23:04] there in stone to actually come and
[1:23:07] bring that to an inscription in the
[1:23:09] heart and the life of a believer to wear
[1:23:11] that it's not us trying to walk
[1:23:13] according to external things of do we do
[1:23:15] this should we not do that do we do this
[1:23:17] should we not do that but it actually
[1:23:19] comes by a relationship to where that
[1:23:21] God Himself comes down and actually in
[1:23:24] scripts his very life his nature his
[1:23:27] character in our life that is God's
[1:23:29] showing mercy and we love him for that
[1:23:32] mercy even that God would come down and
[1:23:35] rebuke us and correct us that's the
[1:23:37] mercy of God that God would come down
[1:23:39] and then after repentance has come but
[1:23:42] God would come and minister to us just
[1:23:44] what we have nita so he's not just one
[1:23:47] that's holding around just steadfast
[1:23:49] love but with compassion God calmed him
[1:23:51] since to actually bring his mercy that
[1:23:55] is in the Covenant to a reality within
[1:23:58] our lives aren't you glad about that
[1:24:02] showing mercy so this is not a dog that
[1:24:05] you and I could look at and say well I
[1:24:07] don't know if he's merciful or not where
[1:24:10] you can look at your husband your wife
[1:24:11] is I don't know if
[1:24:12] merciful a matter of fact I don't I
[1:24:13] don't know I mean there it's kind of
[1:24:16] tell it like it is well Sam I don't
[1:24:18] think this is a family service oh this
[1:24:20] is plumb full of family plumb full
[1:24:23] family this is a this is the family book
[1:24:25] we are his family every service is a
[1:24:27] family service I tell you right now the
[1:24:33] more Lord that I look at this the more
[1:24:34] that I've studied it of how that even
[1:24:37] when you look at it has said these very
[1:24:39] things are the very priority and
[1:24:41] foundation of a marriage covenant yes
[1:24:45] they are it is that which we look our
[1:24:47] our words which we try to use that would
[1:24:50] be the best of what we can do in the
[1:24:52] English for better for worse in sickness
[1:24:56] and in health all of those words our
[1:24:58] words look at the amount of words that
[1:24:59] we have laid out within the vows
[1:25:01] themselves and yet there's one word in
[1:25:03] the Hebrew that will encompass at all
[1:25:05] he said one word that will encompass at
[1:25:08] all because there is a steadfastness of
[1:25:10] love that's needed but not just needed
[1:25:15] there must be compassionate to minister
[1:25:20] that so another part of that mercy to be
[1:25:24] able to minister how say lord help me
[1:25:26] help me I'm not ashamed to ask for help
[1:25:29] lord help me I want to be more like him
[1:25:32] I want to be more like him the more and
[1:25:34] more the regardless of how many times
[1:25:36] that I've looked at something studied
[1:25:37] over it
[1:25:38] maybe preached from this or that but you
[1:25:40] know what when God comes by and speaks
[1:25:42] to our hearts I'm not just preaching to
[1:25:44] you but I am myself reading I am being
[1:25:47] transformed and I'm being changed by
[1:25:48] this word think of it sometimes weeks
[1:25:50] months beforehand I ever stand here to
[1:25:53] bring it but yet in the midst of it then
[1:25:55] when he brings it it's still challenging
[1:25:57] my life has this presence comes down and
[1:26:00] begins to break things open you know
[1:26:02] what that is God could give us his word
[1:26:03] that's out giving you my word but his
[1:26:06] wrath on his compassion will move down
[1:26:08] upon our life to do what instruct us in
[1:26:12] His mercy is that right
[1:26:15] Oh glory be to God notice this in
[1:26:19] numbers 14 17 I know this is this is in
[1:26:22] regarding how God's journey but you and
[1:26:24] I are in our
[1:26:25] own journey as well notice this in verse
[1:26:28] 17 I'll find this to be very fitting now
[1:26:31] how that they have remembered now at
[1:26:32] this point in time here once again they
[1:26:35] went over into the land they've spied
[1:26:36] out the land and there's been an evil
[1:26:38] report that's been brought up there was
[1:26:40] you know in the camp all of the oh ma
[1:26:42] everybody was wailing and crying and and
[1:26:45] everything was going on but yet now it
[1:26:48] comes time in order for them to move
[1:26:50] forward just as God revealed himself to
[1:26:53] Moses back there in Exodus 34 God
[1:26:55] Himself will must manifest himself to
[1:26:58] the Israel once again if God does not do
[1:27:01] that Israel will stay right where they
[1:27:03] are
[1:27:03] yet staying right where they are God is
[1:27:05] a God of mercy steadfast love but it's
[1:27:08] going to take more than the
[1:27:09] manifestation of that steadfast love
[1:27:11] where in that God will display his
[1:27:13] compassion that will actually move to
[1:27:16] atone for the circumstance they're in to
[1:27:18] be able to move him from here to where
[1:27:20] he's calling for so it's going to
[1:27:23] require action on his part well what's
[1:27:26] the require on our part receiving
[1:27:28] receiving and now I beseech thee here's
[1:27:32] Moses one who is standing failing this
[1:27:37] promise Christ is veiled in the promise
[1:27:40] the word that he's given to Moses in
[1:27:43] this hour the hope blood should be the
[1:27:45] name of the Lord
[1:27:46] notice and now here's Moses speaking to
[1:27:50] God and now I beseech thee let the power
[1:27:53] of my Lord be great according as Dallas
[1:27:57] spoken saying look at him he's bringing
[1:28:00] his word back up to him as thou has
[1:28:03] saying the Lord is long-suffering and of
[1:28:07] great mercy
[1:28:10] she said forgiving iniquity and
[1:28:13] transgression and by no means clearing
[1:28:15] the guilty visiting the iniquity of the
[1:28:17] father's upon the children under the
[1:28:19] third and fourth generation pardon I
[1:28:21] beseech thee the iniquity of this people
[1:28:24] according unto the greatness of thy
[1:28:27] mercy and as thou has forgiven de speak
[1:28:30] from Egypt even until now so here is the
[1:28:34] very spirit of Christ standing in Moses
[1:28:37] when God could have wiped every one of
[1:28:39] them out God was ready to wipe him out
[1:28:42] but what turned away his anger what
[1:28:44] turned away his wrath
[1:28:46] it wasn't the words of a man it was his
[1:28:48] words that had taken preeminence in the
[1:28:51] words of a vessel a man and that man
[1:28:54] could speak with divine authority and
[1:28:56] move right back in the presence of God
[1:28:58] and God would recognize his word that
[1:29:01] he's given for that generation God
[1:29:06] recognizes the word that he has given
[1:29:09] for this generation with you and I come
[1:29:12] before his presence when you and I come
[1:29:14] there Christ being veiled in our life he
[1:29:17] recognizes his promise that has been
[1:29:20] given for this generation according to
[1:29:26] the greatness of I said as thou has
[1:29:30] forgiven this people from Egypt even
[1:29:33] until now what's this and the Lord said
[1:29:36] I have pardoned only he could
[1:29:43] I have pardon according to thy word so
[1:29:51] the messengers word is God's word
[1:29:55] because the messenger is holding God's
[1:29:57] message is that right and so God's
[1:30:01] desire is that that message would be
[1:30:03] spoken back to him that rehearse not
[1:30:05] just read not just you know something
[1:30:07] where it's just rehearsed and said and
[1:30:09] said now though God wants it set back by
[1:30:11] a life that's live God wants that set
[1:30:14] back and declared from our lives Moses
[1:30:20] couldn't pardon them that God could but
[1:30:24] you take Moses out and let's let's just
[1:30:26] cut and Moses out of here right now all
[1:30:27] right let's just cut him out what court
[1:30:29] and date the one to do dead the people
[1:30:32] are dead they go nowhere but there's one
[1:30:35] standing with a word of promise and the
[1:30:38] word of promise was not starting an
[1:30:40] organization the word of promise was not
[1:30:41] starting another another denomination
[1:30:43] under the church and that was not the
[1:30:45] word the word was a promise that was
[1:30:47] given that I will visit my people and
[1:30:50] bring them out with a strong hand and
[1:30:52] will put them in the land of promise
[1:30:54] remember God himself and look look look
[1:30:57] the mercy of God is so cold and it shows
[1:31:00] the greatness of it where it was pulled
[1:31:02] so many times to wrath and anger where
[1:31:05] God would say step out of the way I'll
[1:31:07] destroy them all but the promise Christ
[1:31:11] standing there the very raccoon the very
[1:31:14] compassion of God standing right there
[1:31:17] reminds him your mercy your mercy let me
[1:31:26] tell you something Sarah we would have
[1:31:30] been destroyed a long time ago if we
[1:31:33] were not part of Abraham
[1:31:35] if we were not United with him in the
[1:31:39] Covenant
[1:31:40] but even though God were united in the
[1:31:43] Covenant it doesn't mean that God just
[1:31:45] says I'll pretend I didn't see that lion
[1:31:47] I'll pretend I didn't know no God calls
[1:31:49] it out that's the mercy of the Covenant
[1:31:52] why she had to be able to come to a
[1:31:55] place to receive the faith as it has
[1:31:57] been delivered and in order to receive
[1:31:59] that flame faith she cannot have
[1:32:01] anything clouded in her life whole glory
[1:32:04] be to God that is the mercy of God that
[1:32:06] God would deal with every little bit
[1:32:08] eleventh in our life that is the very
[1:32:10] mercy of God that God would say I don't
[1:32:12] want anything that's going to cloud up
[1:32:15] the promise of bringing forth the
[1:32:17] promised son glory be to God I don't
[1:32:24] think I'm the only one having a good
[1:32:25] time but if I am I am lord have mercy
[1:32:31] and the Lord said I have pardoned
[1:32:34] according to that word wow you need to
[1:32:38] have a promise word you need to have a
[1:32:40] representation that's able to take that
[1:32:42] word that is revealed and given and then
[1:32:44] God recognizes his own words and I
[1:32:46] pardoned
[1:32:46] according to that word you note that
[1:32:49] means stay in the line of duty if we're
[1:32:51] walking in the path of duty we're
[1:32:53] walking in what God has said
[1:32:54] you say brother saying I might stumble
[1:32:56] on my fault that's sure you have
[1:32:57] stumbled you have fallen but get back up
[1:33:00] in the path of duty as long as you're
[1:33:02] walking in the path of duty then God
[1:33:04] does not a lot your mistakes to you you
[1:33:08] know that's a direct quote as I was with
[1:33:10] Moses now watch this here's the
[1:33:17] steadfast mercy of God but as truly as I
[1:33:23] live all the earth shall be filled with
[1:33:28] the glory of the Lord
[1:33:30] when God spoke this right here he
[1:33:33] already saw me in you before he ever
[1:33:37] spoken but God right here spoke this
[1:33:39] again all the earth shall be filled not
[1:33:43] just this day not just this time in this
[1:33:45] is a necessary part unnecessary
[1:33:47] increment within it but even after the
[1:33:50] Gentiles up here that's drawn this time
[1:33:52] of dispensation dealing with the Gentile
[1:33:54] Telangana people for his namesake and he
[1:33:56] moves then taking the bride away in
[1:33:59] rapture and begins to deal with 144,000
[1:34:02] that is God working to fulfill this
[1:34:04] promise that he has given in his word
[1:34:07] [Music]
[1:34:09] this word right here is even where God
[1:34:12] sees himself seated bare whom the throne
[1:34:15] of the son of David there in the
[1:34:17] Millennium dis promise encompasses even
[1:34:20] the future Hall where that home itself
[1:34:22] sets down upon this earth that's been
[1:34:25] cleansed all glory they covered God knew
[1:34:28] when he made this statement all the
[1:34:30] wonderings all the backslidings all the
[1:34:32] failures he knew he knew of even the
[1:34:34] mess that you and I would be in but
[1:34:36] still that did not keep from prophesy
[1:34:39] according to his steadfast love surely
[1:34:44] all the earth as truly as I live and he
[1:34:48] ever liveth all the earth shall be
[1:34:55] filled with the glory of the Lord I say
[1:34:58] that we are part of the testimony of
[1:35:00] God's faithfulness right here in this
[1:35:02] word I'm looking up and said right now
[1:35:06] this morning I'm looking up at his said
[1:35:09] that has been ministered by the raccoon
[1:35:11] of the compassion of Almighty God what
[1:35:13] shall Nehemiah picks these very things
[1:35:15] up right here in Nehemiah chapter 9 I'm
[1:35:17] trying to come down here notice this how
[1:35:20] Nehemiah picks us up again I think it's
[1:35:22] been fitting that we look at these these
[1:35:23] these words here but they notice in
[1:35:26] verse 16 they and our fathers dealt
[1:35:28] proudly and harden their necks and
[1:35:30] hearken not to thy Commandments you know
[1:35:32] one thing that I find that is very very
[1:35:34] very important that God would have
[1:35:37] Israel before they go in the land he
[1:35:40] takes a whole book of Deuteronomy
[1:35:42] Deuteronomy is not just an instruction
[1:35:43] book about don't do this don't do that
[1:35:45] but God reminds him in there where
[1:35:48] you've come from and he reminds him who
[1:35:51] brought you out he reminds him the
[1:35:53] condition they were found in and he also
[1:35:55] lets them know this is the character the
[1:35:57] character life that I desire to see and
[1:36:00] will bring forth in your life same thing
[1:36:04] now notice here each and every time its
[1:36:06] to visit when God is sending this word
[1:36:08] here is Nehemiah standing remember Ezra
[1:36:11] has already been there and here is
[1:36:12] Nehemiah standing at this time in his
[1:36:14] visitation to me it's absolutely
[1:36:15] phenomenal how and Ezra 9 he deals with
[1:36:18] the repentance of God in Nehemiah
[1:36:20] chapter 9 he also comes with repentance
[1:36:22] as well and even though neither one of
[1:36:24] these guys if you could say you could
[1:36:26] put a finger and say you're part of the
[1:36:27] problem man
[1:36:28] you're front no they just happens to be
[1:36:30] that they were under it but yet they
[1:36:32] recognize the Lord no matter if it's
[1:36:34] daddy did it mama did it right here I
[1:36:36] need forgiveness because I can't lay it
[1:36:38] on them I stand in me God can deal with
[1:36:43] hearts like that you know God ain't a
[1:36:47] shovel kind of God either well let me go
[1:36:50] on here it's important to look back and
[1:36:54] recognize where God has brought you from
[1:36:56] and here this would be remembered think
[1:36:59] of the message that God has sent to us
[1:37:01] in this hour think of how that the
[1:37:02] Prophet would drop here and there at
[1:37:04] different times and be mindful of to
[1:37:06] remember where God himself has brought
[1:37:09] you and I even when he would speak of
[1:37:10] their early Pentecostal movement of
[1:37:12] those things that were going on he would
[1:37:14] speak of how that they had drifted from
[1:37:16] those things this is exactly where
[1:37:18] Nehemiah is picking up of the very mercy
[1:37:21] of God that had been extended to Israel
[1:37:23] in verse in verse 17 he said and they
[1:37:25] refused to obey
[1:37:27] neither were mindful of thy wonders that
[1:37:29] thou didst among them but hardened their
[1:37:32] necks and in their rebellion appointed a
[1:37:35] captain to return in their bondage but
[1:37:37] thou art a God ready to party gracious
[1:37:41] and merciful slow to anger and of great
[1:37:45] kindness and forsook us them not those
[1:37:48] two words are encompassed right there
[1:37:50] has said and as well as that of rock
[1:37:52] whom the compassion of God
[1:37:53] now notice yeah
[1:37:54] when they had made a molten calf and
[1:37:56] said this my God has brought thee out up
[1:37:59] out of Egypt and had wrought great
[1:38:02] provocations remember this is where God
[1:38:04] said step aside I'll kill every one of
[1:38:06] them and I'll raise a new nation up with
[1:38:08] you but the Spirit of Christ and Moses
[1:38:11] stood like the cross how could it how
[1:38:21] could he turn God from it because he had
[1:38:23] God's Word what terms the very wrath of
[1:38:28] God because God's Word is on earth one
[1:38:32] day the blood will be lifted one day his
[1:38:35] day of mercy wouldn't be finished and
[1:38:38] there will be no more mercy it will be
[1:38:41] judgment how about dogs a merciful God
[1:38:46] that's why he sends his word that's my
[1:38:49] calls to you and I because he does not
[1:38:51] remember he's not willing it's not his
[1:38:55] desire that any should perish but that
[1:38:59] all should come to repentance had you
[1:39:03] seen the steadfast love of Almighty God
[1:39:06] wherein that God so loved the world that
[1:39:08] He gave His only begotten Son that
[1:39:10] whosoever believeth in him should not
[1:39:11] perish he paid for the entire world
[1:39:14] because forget that elect that remnant
[1:39:17] and yet his mercy will also grant
[1:39:22] salvation to others who will call on him
[1:39:31] aren't you glad it's held for you I'm
[1:39:35] glad not sure am notice yeah hey now I
[1:39:40] want to get to this word here I'm gonna
[1:39:42] get to this one will just try to close
[1:39:43] somewhere
[1:39:44] yeah thou in thy manifold mercies this
[1:39:47] is a different word we're going to look
[1:39:48] at here yet thou in thy manifold notice
[1:39:52] manifold mercies forsook us them not in
[1:39:55] the wilderness well these were tough
[1:40:00] times don't you say
[1:40:02] God could have maybe just filed for
[1:40:04] divorce right there
[1:40:05] bridge brother Samuel I am I'm preaching
[1:40:09] justice he's giving it to me
[1:40:10] these were tough times because what God
[1:40:15] was seeing was not at all what he
[1:40:17] brought out over the senior didn't he
[1:40:21] know it when he brought him out but if
[1:40:23] God would have been focused on that when
[1:40:25] he brought him out he never would have
[1:40:26] brought him out are you with me but God
[1:40:31] had a desire he had a fulfillment to his
[1:40:34] word his promise God desires to see his
[1:40:38] word come to pass in our lives and let
[1:40:42] me tell you something God is so
[1:40:43] determined to bring that word to pass
[1:40:45] that he supplies plentiful mercy in
[1:40:49] order to bring it to pass in our life
[1:40:52] [Applause]
[1:40:54] glory be to God hallelujah for suckers
[1:40:57] they're not in the wilderness there's
[1:40:59] many times he could have walked away and
[1:41:01] said I'm tired I'm no longer dealing
[1:41:04] with you Samuel I've told you 500 times
[1:41:06] I've told you a hundred times maybe for
[1:41:09] some of y'all thousand it depends on
[1:41:12] what it is they're right once he got to
[1:41:14] preach so many parts I don't know about
[1:41:21] you but I'm kind of liking this yeah I'm
[1:41:25] kind of liking it
[1:41:25] oh it's ten in my heart too but I'm
[1:41:28] liking it when times got hard almighty
[1:41:32] could have just forsook it
[1:41:34] but he's faithful to his word let me
[1:41:41] tell you something God knew what he was
[1:41:43] getting into when he got in you
[1:41:48] he knew what he was getting into he knew
[1:41:52] and you know what it wasn't that that he
[1:41:56] was looking at he was looking at the
[1:41:58] effect of his word met by his compassion
[1:42:01] his compassion will bring forth what his
[1:42:04] mercy is calling for glory be to God so
[1:42:10] God says not just saying hey I got mercy
[1:42:12] I got mercy God said I'm gonna show
[1:42:19] gonna have about two more hours I got
[1:42:28] going here this morning I said let me
[1:42:32] work with this scripture here yet down
[1:42:35] in that manifold mercies for sickest am
[1:42:37] not in the wilderness the pillar of the
[1:42:39] cloud departed not from them by day to
[1:42:41] lead them in the way neither the pillar
[1:42:44] fire by light to show them light and the
[1:42:47] way wherein they should go now gave us
[1:42:50] also by good spirit to instruct them and
[1:42:53] was held if not my manna from the
[1:42:55] mountain gave them water for their
[1:42:57] search a faithful father kept path but
[1:43:06] yet he said I'm still gonna feed you I'm
[1:43:09] still gonna water you you're my children
[1:43:12] I'm gonna care for you and it's not just
[1:43:15] God just giving in but his mercy comes
[1:43:17] with leadership and the pillar of fire
[1:43:20] sent forth to instruct his children in
[1:43:24] the midst of that time the great angel
[1:43:26] of the Lord the angel of the Covenant
[1:43:31] present to instruct
[1:43:37] really I thought you said Moses was the
[1:43:41] one carrying the message he was but he
[1:43:43] was getting his message from
[1:43:44] headquarters and headquarters was not
[1:43:48] down in Egypt headquarters was the logos
[1:43:51] does God change his mind
[1:43:53] the Prophet tells us Moses while the
[1:43:55] rest of was getting their information
[1:43:56] from other things
[1:43:57] Moses was getting his information from
[1:43:59] the logos of God the pillar fire let me
[1:44:03] tell you something friends that's the
[1:44:04] headquarters of the bride of Jesus
[1:44:05] Christ in this hour it's not some
[1:44:07] physical location somewhere that we
[1:44:10] would somehow pay homage to I respect
[1:44:12] things that God has done within the life
[1:44:14] of the Prophet in those various things
[1:44:16] but that is not my headquarters my
[1:44:18] headquarters is in heaven my
[1:44:20] headquarters is the divine by divine
[1:44:23] presence of Almighty God that pillar of
[1:44:26] fire so I don't have to call nobody and
[1:44:31] ask him one message shuttle listen to
[1:44:32] this week I got direct contact oh yes
[1:44:38] sir
[1:44:39] I got direct contact with Almighty God
[1:44:41] I'm not saying that in Pride I'm saying
[1:44:43] that because that's exactly where God
[1:44:45] has brought you in I - God has not
[1:44:47] brought us down to another
[1:44:48] denominational appointment this message
[1:44:51] never came to appoint us to man this
[1:44:53] message came to bring a relationship
[1:44:55] between God and His people Amen with a
[1:44:59] pillar fire this pressure upon the
[1:45:02] children of the Living God no matter
[1:45:05] what's he doing he's here to instruct us
[1:45:08] he's here to minister to you and I'm
[1:45:10] with you and I've polished or will we
[1:45:12] need strength where you need the Holy
[1:45:14] Ghost when you need deliverance he's
[1:45:16] here to minister healing
[1:45:18] to you and a high that is the
[1:45:20] faithfulness of Almighty God if he has
[1:45:28] mercy I won't obtain it don't you
[1:45:30] well I'm gonna need help I can't obtain
[1:45:32] it on my own strength
[1:45:34] I need leadership I don't know if I'm
[1:45:50] get this word or not therefore thou
[1:45:55] delivers them into the hand of their
[1:45:58] enemies who vex them and in the time of
[1:46:03] their trouble when they cried unto thee
[1:46:07] thou hurt us them from heaven send me I
[1:46:10] don't sound like mercy okay let's just
[1:46:13] look at it like this let's say that your
[1:46:15] child is constantly misbehaving let's
[1:46:19] say they're constantly disrespectful to
[1:46:21] adults let's say that it's constantly
[1:46:23] things that's going on at school and
[1:46:25] other places like that now you can look
[1:46:26] at that and say I'm going to be one of
[1:46:28] compassion that's wonderful
[1:46:29] compassion itself steps forward with
[1:46:31] understanding but if that compassion
[1:46:33] itself if it moves to a place to say
[1:46:36] well they're just a child well they're
[1:46:38] just a kid
[1:46:39] but yet knowing that the things that you
[1:46:40] see now if that's let go now where
[1:46:43] they'll be later on know they so they
[1:46:45] want now they throw themselves in the
[1:46:47] floor in a temper and tantrum
[1:46:48] god help the person that they would try
[1:46:50] to marry because they'll do other means
[1:46:52] to try to get their way why the
[1:46:56] character that's molded or allowed to be
[1:46:58] will actually reflect itself in a latter
[1:47:01] time so in order the mercy real mercy is
[1:47:05] not I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that
[1:47:06] oh I love you so much even though you're
[1:47:08] rotten you're a devil you're this and
[1:47:10] that I love that's not the mercy of God
[1:47:11] that is called pure ignorance but the
[1:47:16] mercy of God steps forward to instruct
[1:47:19] us God never let Israel buy with that
[1:47:22] sin but his mercy that steadfastness of
[1:47:25] his covenant he corrected what was wrong
[1:47:29] he ministered the compassion that was
[1:47:32] needed
[1:47:34] sometimes my dad ministered compassion
[1:47:36] with his arm around me another times he
[1:47:38] ministered compassion with his hand on
[1:47:39] the belt strap
[1:47:41] other times he ministered and when I sat
[1:47:43] in the corner I hated taking naps I
[1:47:45] loved the things now if I can get him
[1:47:47] that was worse brother Joe he'd whooped
[1:47:49] me and didn't make me go lay down in the
[1:47:50] bed he did naked naps I was gonna miss
[1:47:54] something in today
[1:47:55] I like daylight you know what I'm saying
[1:47:57] then that was worse than the belt but I
[1:47:59] thank God I needed every one am I needed
[1:48:01] a whole lot more weapons than what I got
[1:48:02] I probably needed one to start today
[1:48:04] with come on downstairs boy for you
[1:48:06] breakfast let's warm you up good he not
[1:48:08] second right down with as well y'all
[1:48:11] remember that when you get home today go
[1:48:13] ahead
[1:48:13] [Laughter]
[1:48:19] bet it comes the correction we need
[1:48:22] correction normally the Bible says it
[1:48:24] right here that invent a child that's
[1:48:25] left to itself bring up its mother shame
[1:48:28] God said what I will not leave you
[1:48:30] comfortless as orphans but he comes to
[1:48:34] God and direct us and lead us and guide
[1:48:35] us it's God's mercy that would come down
[1:48:37] and correct you and I but remember God's
[1:48:40] mercy to correct you and I isn't that
[1:48:41] God walks out of services path what then
[1:48:43] I got him crying today oh I got him
[1:48:46] crying whew
[1:48:47] I'm today that ain't God's desire listen
[1:48:51] you're done he want a broken heart and a
[1:48:52] contrite spirit yes but look what a
[1:48:54] broken what a brokenness and contrite
[1:48:56] means it means to the foolishness that
[1:48:58] has had you bound in for who you really
[1:49:00] are that the grace of God has come and
[1:49:02] liberated you and now you are ready to
[1:49:05] be instructed so you don't come into
[1:49:07] that same condition so brother
[1:49:09] brokenness and contract nurses and that
[1:49:11] you walk out of here where your lip you
[1:49:13] have to say let me pick my lip up so I
[1:49:15] can walk out here in the parking lot but
[1:49:18] it's to do what it brings you and I to a
[1:49:20] place to where that God can then
[1:49:22] instruct you and I whoa my honey was
[1:49:29] going into this word or not
[1:49:36] according to thy manifold mercies thou
[1:49:41] has given them saviors who saved them
[1:49:47] out of the hand of their enemies I've
[1:49:52] given them manifold mercies and what did
[1:49:57] the manifold mercy supply saviors not
[1:50:01] capital S lowercase vessels that were
[1:50:07] set apart by God to receive from God a
[1:50:11] direct ministering of the Covenant of
[1:50:14] his mercy and then through that
[1:50:18] ministering of that covenant of Mercy
[1:50:19] that Savior that messenger would
[1:50:22] actually take that message forth and it
[1:50:24] was God's compassion reaching to the
[1:50:26] hearts of the people let's just stop I
[1:50:33] don't want you to lose this thought but
[1:50:35] this word that we would look at here in
[1:50:37] Mercy's it's another word that speaks of
[1:50:41] the very mercy of God which is that of a
[1:50:45] wound and compassion to think of how
[1:50:50] that God Himself likens his care for us
[1:50:54] in the world that he watches over us to
[1:51:00] supply
[1:51:06] with great care he watches over our
[1:51:10] lives aren't you glad all of these
[1:51:15] things all the richness all of this we
[1:51:17] need we need his care and watching over
[1:51:19] our lives is that right to think of this
[1:51:22] how that in Psalms 145 verse 8 the Lord
[1:51:25] is gracious and full of compassion slow
[1:51:27] to anger and of great mercy the Lord is
[1:51:32] good to all and his tender mercies this
[1:51:36] is that word our overall work so right
[1:51:38] there in those two verses here the very
[1:51:40] richness of God's mercy steadfast love
[1:51:43] his compassion and also that of one who
[1:51:46] was there holding you and I like that in
[1:51:49] the womb in protection I told you I saw
[1:51:57] close
[1:52:06] over and over when you find David in the
[1:52:09] scriptures David would speak of the
[1:52:14] tender mercies of God and when you see
[1:52:16] that phrase tender mercies that's the
[1:52:19] very word that David speaking out how
[1:52:21] God is keeping him close God's watching
[1:52:25] over him
[1:52:26] God will call us to come forth what is
[1:52:30] there within David's life it's God it's
[1:52:35] his mercy no wonder the Prophet could
[1:52:37] say the greatness is him being rich I
[1:52:43] say he is rich in mercy I say Lord that
[1:52:54] mean be a full reflection of their mercy
[1:52:59] I'd only want my solo fool you know
[1:53:02] plumb full of it I believe I'm sealed
[1:53:05] with his spirit but I want every ounce
[1:53:07] of my being to be so under the influence
[1:53:11] of God's mercy
[1:53:13] I want my thinking or my attitude I want
[1:53:17] my objectives I want it all to be
[1:53:21] encompassed with his mercy because
[1:53:23] remember his mercy is that which he's
[1:53:26] looking for the fulfillment of his word
[1:53:28] I want to see that word becoming
[1:53:31] material in me and in order for that it
[1:53:36] will take the compassion of God it will
[1:53:38] take me within my life and even as
[1:53:40] you're sitting right here you you might
[1:53:42] be sitting you're listening so intent
[1:53:43] but yet within you it's drawing on God
[1:53:46] it's just like that woman with the issue
[1:53:48] of blood she said if I can but touch the
[1:53:52] hem of His garment I shall be made whole
[1:53:56] what was she needed she was needing the
[1:53:59] God of compassion to minister his
[1:54:02] covenant of mercy and God came forth and
[1:54:06] ministered to her so his mercy
[1:54:09] you don't leave things the way it found
[1:54:11] it when it steps forward we can never be
[1:54:15] the same
[1:54:16] but I say lord help me in my home right
[1:54:21] here with the church right here between
[1:54:23] each and between husband and wife Lord
[1:54:26] God let me be full of compassion now you
[1:54:31] might say bro send me I can't forget I
[1:54:33] understand that we're serving a God who
[1:54:36] has given us the grace and we'll give
[1:54:39] the grace to be able to pull out the
[1:54:41] stinger that wall that prevents that's
[1:54:47] the kind of God we serve
[1:54:51] that's the kind of God we serve let's
[1:54:58] just anyone want to be remembered in
[1:55:01] prayer
[1:55:06] or Jesus
[1:55:10] I know Lord in a service like this
[1:55:12] sometimes Mona I get real nervous
[1:55:16] and I get to look at Nordic words
[1:55:18] keeping up with some of these things
[1:55:20] more but I believe God that there's a
[1:55:23] fault that's pretty simple and I hope
[1:55:26] Lord God I trust that's been
[1:55:30] communicated this morning I know that
[1:55:33] Lord just my words Lord God it would
[1:55:37] fail but father Lord the fall behind
[1:55:40] Lord that you gave and directed and more
[1:55:43] this morning or Jesus I pray that Lord
[1:55:47] you'll put it together
[1:55:49] in all of our lives and what we're
[1:55:53] asking right now that you would help us
[1:55:55] that you would put us in that place in
[1:56:00] what you have for our lives Lord your
[1:56:04] God our hands are up Lord you know the
[1:56:07] needs that are behind those sayings Lord
[1:56:10] father I pray that God that you
[1:56:12] administer Lord to each one according
[1:56:15] Lord to the Covenant of your mercy your
[1:56:20] God by your divine nature Lord your
[1:56:23] great compassion that you would move
[1:56:25] down Lord and father you would move Lord
[1:56:29] God on that heart Lord and just speaking
[1:56:33] personally Lord to them Lord to let them
[1:56:36] know it is I Lord Jesus we need you Lord
[1:56:44] father this is our desire that in our
[1:56:47] lives we want Lord to be real
[1:56:50] reflections of your mercy Lord
[1:56:53] help us Lord if this is just if this
[1:56:58] stays just as doctrine if it stays just
[1:57:00] as something Lord God where is your
[1:57:03] mercy Lord being displayed to us and it
[1:57:06] stops right there we miss it but Lord
[1:57:10] God let it be known Lord God that even
[1:57:12] right here this morning that is your
[1:57:15] mercy has been displayed and ministered
[1:57:18] right here to where the Lord if there is
[1:57:21] one that doesn't know you Lord maybe God
[1:57:24] has never repented of their sins your
[1:57:26] mercy holds for them and calls out to
[1:57:30] them Lord God that father that as they
[1:57:33] would relinquish Lord and say I no
[1:57:35] longer want to walk this way that I'm
[1:57:37] walking Lord then father they themselves
[1:57:39] are receiving Lord a direct ministry of
[1:57:43] that covenant of mercy Lord that father
[1:57:46] would speak to their hearts taught to
[1:57:48] turn their heart to you Lord and then
[1:57:51] Lord God even as they would walk out
[1:57:53] Lord even from this place Lord God there
[1:57:56] would begin to reflect Lord God a change
[1:57:59] that has taken place maybe not a
[1:58:01] something Lord that would be so fully or
[1:58:03] drastically recognized at that moment
[1:58:05] Lord but father as they would walk with
[1:58:08] you Lord and submitting to your word
[1:58:10] Lord God they would come into a place
[1:58:13] Lord of complete reflection of the very
[1:58:16] one himself who ministers the covenant
[1:58:19] of mercy and Lord God where we stand
[1:58:22] here this morning this afternoon Lord
[1:58:26] when we think of it in our homes our
[1:58:28] marriages our children Lord right here
[1:58:30] in this church Lord God among our
[1:58:33] co-workers even Lord Father we realize
[1:58:37] Lord Jesus that God we need that
[1:58:42] reflection in our life
[1:58:46] we need that Lord Lord it's easy well
[1:58:50] it's easy to do it Lord to someone Lord
[1:58:52] God that seems like our temperament make
[1:58:55] up whatever is compatible with the Lord
[1:58:59] God we needed for all help us Lord Jesus

[1:59:06] Lord I pray the lord help him lord help
[1:59:10] us the Lord God in realizing well god
[1:59:15] what a responsibility Lord sometimes
[1:59:18] Lord when phase themselves Lord it looks

[1:59:26] not fail to hold that word of promise
[1:59:30] you what we want that word of promise
[1:59:34] knowing Lord God that it's sent there to
[1:59:36] direct our conduct oh god help us Lord
[1:59:41] in our marriages Lord God oh my
[1:59:45] what God is I have mentioned to him Lord
[1:59:48] when I was studying this Lord God I came
[1:59:50] across many of the Hebrew writers Lord
[1:59:52] and father Lord many of them Lord God
[1:59:54] Hanuman Lord they would draw out Lord
[1:59:56] God this in the Covenant of marriage
[1:59:58] Lord because that's what it is
[2:00:00] it's your covenant of union with our
[2:00:02] lives or not pray
[2:00:06] knowing that Lord God it is true one of
[2:00:12] the greatest gifts outside of salvation
[2:00:14] norther the spouse that you've given us
[2:00:18] but God hallowed in a marriage oh my
[2:00:22] the vows are said right here but the
[2:00:27] vows are lived in days years and months

[2:00:39] God that you would help us I pray that
[2:00:41] you administer personally Lord to every
[2:00:43] need Lord God let there not be one that
[2:00:46] would sit here Lord God Lord God your
[2:00:49] intent is not for somebody just said
[2:00:50] here Lord God under a cloud of
[2:00:52] condemnation but Lord God we want to
[2:00:54] look into your word and realizing Lord
[2:00:56] Jesus that it takes compassion we can
[2:01:00] look and say I have mercy but Lord it

[2:01:51] David can say Lord even in Psalms 119 he
[2:01:54] crown us my life with tender mercies oh
[2:01:59] Jesus Lord how we love you this
