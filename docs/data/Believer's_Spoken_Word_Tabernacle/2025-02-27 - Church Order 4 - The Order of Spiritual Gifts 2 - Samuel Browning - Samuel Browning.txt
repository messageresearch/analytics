to be gathered together good to have brother Malachi with us amen and uh and all the rest of you has been strangers be so good on Sunday the services the lord gave us here on Sunday and uh you know it was an expectation we we come with and um also was very good to see different ones on Sunday that hadn't been able to be in church for a while and so that was very that was very refreshing as well um and just to see just the just the sweet atmosphere of the Holy Spirit just coming in such such a wonderful way and then there in the night service after the questions and answers and just so many uh different needs and just being prayed for and and ministered to I certainly expect great testimonies to come from that it was such a wonderful atmosphere wasn't it just a wonderful presence of the Lord and and you know that's something that the word of the Lord will bring that and where Believers are gathered and where our hearts are in that in that desire and looking for him we can come to church for a lot of things uh but the main thing that we come to church for is to see him and to be able to see where our our weak places are and you know that takes real sons and daughters of God to be able to look in the face of the word and say God show me where my shortcomings are because the reality of it is is that we until the very change of the body we continually need to be growing and we need his leadership in every part of our life so we're not just here left and spinning our wheels and but but God is working in our lives and so we we know that you know no matter what everything else is going on in the world and all of those other things you know the thing of it is is that that those things that are taking place we can see things here and there but you know it's not for us to try to infer or figure everything out even when you look at the the ministry of the prophet in this hour when he would speak about going into to minister the church ages it wasn't until that things be to press on him that he saw the hour we're in and he said I must give this to the church at this time so a lot of things around us but God let me keep my sight let me keep my mind let me keep my heart centered on the coming of the Lord amen because that's what's more important than anything um I want to uh mention there there was there's an order form that's out there there's four samples books uh I don't know if we there was there was four out there and so if we got the I I left the four of them out there two um in English and Spanish in each of the seven Church age book as well as the sealed book and um uh brother George had went through that here on uh Saturday evening and so um those are some things that I want to be able to put um an order in uh for that and so if you are wanting um any of those books I tell you I would really love for you to have those books uh especially when you get into the uh the church ages because brother Brenham put so much what what what took place after the seals were open this is why you find that there were so many things that the Holy Spirit had him to put into the church age messages after that he had already spoke and so that's what's something that's so important and I say this very openly because there's things that's been said and taught and mentioned in the past it's false and regarding and surrounding that book and so those are things that I'm very adamant about that um and so those are things that I wanted to be very clear because you know I know that maybe even some of you that are here you haven't read that book but I can tell you that book is one where brother Ram says I put the doctrine in it and that on the seven Church age book you'll find such Clarity when it gets into the baptism of the Holy Ghost all the doctrine it's laid out so clearly in that church age book and so you know it's like um brother George didn't um go over this the other night but we were we were talking and you can look it up at home but if you look up Romans 16:22 if I were to ask you you know brother Aaron who wrote the book of Romans you would say well that's Paul Paul wrote that book and if you look in Romans 16:22 it says I tortilis wrote this epistle so what was it Paul he took down Paul's words right and that's how that most of the letters when we say oh that's Paul's letter well most of them outside of a few were actually taken down by other people so sometimes you know it's things that when we look at all of that that I know that for the most part that's not been uh an issue and things like that here and I know that um you know there's been a lot of other things that have been kind of ironed out in other places as well too and uh but sometimes things can just be uh you know taught and he gets caught in a certain way and people get scarecrows and uh but it's like what brother George says he said show me one place show me one person that that that book's ever hurt and so and it's that those are the things that if to me in you know uh with the young people and things like that brother Malachi brother Shane you remember that I took a period of time with just the young people and they each had a copy of the church age book and I just spent time and I went through uh a meeting after meeting we had with the young people just trying to go through it and it's very challenging for me not to dive into things and just to hit and skip over it but you know because it's it's just filled and I'll tell you if you say well I'm looking for a devotional book save your money at the Christian bookstore $5 right there that that very thing will get will it'll be a very very benefit to your life absolutely and uh and I just say it in this way if if anyone would be you know maybe you're you're not able to do it at this time and and uh you need some help well just just see me just see me because I want it in your hands I certainly want it and if it's in Spanish and or English and however we need it I also contacted brother Barry and asked him I said hey because I asked brother George do you have any in French uh because uh we we we have a French population here now and so I said do you have any in French so brother Barry said let me check brother George said he didn't have any so uh they're working on that for me right now to try to get that in place so uh we really want to um try to do that as well and you know there's just only so many services you have I told my wife I said I'd love to have just a service where I can deal just with the church ages and just to have maybe a Friday night we can come together but we all have all kinds of schedules and uh so you know we realize we can't do that and so may God help us to use the utilize the time but I I really enjoy those things I believe you'll be benefited and blessed as well and and I'll tell you one thing that I've done with the church age book is that I've done it like brother George was saying uh I actually um it was one of the times he was speaking to our young people and I just took it uh what he was saying because you know you've comb through it you you you read through it many times and other times I'm in studying in certain places but I just made it a part of the devotional so you know you read a page page and a half a day and and believe me it's it's like a concentrate you know what I'm talking about but but you get through it you you you get through it and it's it's good it's digestible and uh it's really good so uh but so I just that order form is out there and um and so uh we just you can check off what you want and obviously if you don't speak Spanish then you probably don't want one in Spanish uh but the seal book and the the thing with that book that's out there now as I explained and brother George went through brother George went through and redid both of yes you guys can God bless you thank you uh he went through and he put out new uh he he did a nice job on the paragraphs and I was was showing brother Gomez the other night of how that those of you remember the old church age book everything was run together he took the scriptures and it just separated them so it's very easy read um with how that's done so um you know they do have leather bound ones I have a leatherbound seven seal book and a Le leatherbound Church age book but those are about3 $35 a piece and and I've had people that's gifted those to me but if you want those you can I'll get you the website you can order them but I'd like to try to put something together and get an order in here for us on these books so I didn't want to I apologize for taking that time but I thought I would just say that for what's out there um as we stand tonight and we just prepare to open the word of the Lord um I want to uh ask you to continue remember um Sister Sarah Lewis they're just waiting to get her uh transferred um she you know there was a stroke that she suffered here just about a week and a half ago and so it's just was a uh she's been there in the Cleveland Clinic and so they um you know with therapy and everything that is going on so uh they're just looking for then a facility to transfer her to so we want to continue to keep her in prayer and um also uh brother and sister Crest I spoke with them today and and they're not uh feeling well at all and brother Dave bless his heart he said brother Samu I wanted to be there tonight He said you know me I want to be there I said I know you do I said he said but I'll be praying for the service I said I I appreciate that but he just you know the congestion cold and things like that so let's remember him in prayer also brother Dave Jr a lot of train lot of changes at work that are taking place and so he's uh he said he was texting me and writing me about all those things too that's going on it's really trying it's really tying him up there so let's just remember them in prayer and I know we already lifted prayer request and perhaps is there any other unspoken request maybe you have something on your heart to say Lord you know my need maybe it's in your family maybe it's job whatever the situation God is mindful amen let's just can we just go to him in prayer Heavenly Father Lord how we thank you for your mercies once again this evening thank you Lord for uh giving us Lord a a nice warm day Lord a time that Lord even in the midst of this winter and Lord even looking at how the parking lot was cleared that we could walk in without even the consideration Lord Of Ice And we thank you for those things father we ask that Lord that for each one of these requests Lord that have been written out and read earlier along with these Lord that I've mentioned and every uplifted hand father you know the needs of your children and you are mindful Lord to minister to every one of our needs now we just ask that Lord May the Holy Spirit just Lord moving for each one of the written and the uplifted hands oh God that you would just Lord Minister Lord and father move on behalf of these needs for Lord we can do nothing without you lord father you are our help you are our strength you are our stay you are our everything Lord now may you just have complete control guide and direct Lord the words of my mouth Lord just speak to our hearts tonight in a special way we pray in Jesus precious name amen amen let's look here in First Corinthians chapter 14 uh number two I want to I want to go back into this and I'm just going to try to move to some places here tonight uh with the spiritual gifts just a little bit and um verse one follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts but rather that you may prophesy for he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men but unto God for no man understandeth him how be it in the spirit he speaketh Mysteries but he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification and exhortation and comfort he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself but he that prophesieth edifieth the church now I want you to draw your attention back to verse three and that's I'm going to come through that a little bit tonight he that prophet prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification exhortation and comfort amen may God bless the reading of the word as you're being seated Paul goes on to say I would that you all spake with tongues but rather that you prophesied for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues except he interpret that the church may receive edifying now now notice Paul continues to move with this on the that of the spiritual gifts and I think that no matter if we're dealing with tongues interpretation we're dealing with a song special we're dealing with ministering of the word it should all be about edification of the church because see we could leave that just for the gifts but it actually applies to all that is all that is to be done is for the benefit of the church yeah you see a minister could actually Minister based on the revelation of what he is studying at that particular time and it can be it can be right up here but if it's up there and the people it's not that the people are would be lower but if that's not where we're at and that's not where the needs are at then it only becomes a display of what one knows in the ministry this is why that there's really two terms that I like to use there's a difference between preaching and ministering uh preaching you know uh where it can really get in and it's really preaching preaching of the word and yet really the real preaching should be ministering and that's serving and that is where you don't get to determine what it is that you're going to speak there's sometimes there's things that you think you know and I'm just giving you a little insight that I might think even sometimes when I'm going into a meeting in other places and I think you know sometimes there's been things that have dropped on my heart heart that uh this I think this is I I feel like I'm feeling pressed to go in this direction and then when you get there things all together change and here you are it's almost like you God's just given you from here and you're pulling from here and pulling from there pulling from here pulling from there but you know God knows what he's doing and so I tell you when I first started to Ministry it made me a nervous wreck now it doesn't still don't make it's not that it don't make you nervous but you just what it is it's you come to a place to really you're realizing to rely more upon him and so God knows you know you studied and all those things and it's kind of like brother George Smith what he always tells me he said you prepare the bread ahead of time you get it he said all you got to do when you get there is just slice it so you know and and that part of it comes of just just laying you know just laying in the word and just waiting on God and sometimes God will bring a collection of things together from maybe a series that we've ministered here or other things but at any rate it it everything that we do should be for the edifying whether it's singing and uh playing and everything anything like that it's for the edifying of the body of Believers and that really is the heart of Christ because remember the whole uh purpose and Redemption was not about self-serving it came in order to minister on our behalf to pay the price for you and I so that same heart of redemption that same part is what actually is to work and operate through every part within the body no matter if it is a gift that is listed here in 1 Corinthians 12 or even in 13 it it really doesn't matter if you look and say well I don't know if I can find the the gift or whatever in there but you know there are sometimes where individuals really have a gift to be able to witness and there are times that where that there are things that God will call us to do if I don't mean to take a sidebar but brother Branda would tell us even when he deals with Peter and John and he would deal all of us know that Divine love must is an essential in our life to be expressed but the phet would tell us in the message that John would be called to display that on a level that Peter was not called to so to think that John the Beloved would be called to express love maybe there was other Brethren that maybe they had ministries of Miracles and gift of faith and gift of healing and all those things and John would say what about me and yet what God had called John to do was to be a display of the love of God and then that same thing with Peter and others so sometimes it's you know God doesn't want us try trying to press and try to obtain something whatever he has for us just we want to make ourselves available to him and God will see to it that it comes out in its time because every part is vital in this great Symphony every part is vital whether it whether you you may not even be somebody who's even vocal who even knows you're around you may not be a person who's spitting out quotes and scriptures or whatever more but your love and your fervency your dedication and service to God is a testimony and it's a vital part within the Assembly of God so when we look at this Paul goes on to say Brethren I come to you I if I come unto you speaking with tongues what shall what shall I profit you except I shall speak to you either by Revelation by knowledge by prophesying or by Doctrine so if none of these fit what good would me speaking in Tong Tong if I can come in speaking all these tongues and you're not edified in one of these ways so that's the part that when we walk and we leave from here and you know and sometimes the the the the the the way the gift that God might have and I'm talking about the ministerial gift might be ever so different from maybe what we're used to uh and how that we're looking at things but if we can just say Lord help me just to see you God will speak to our hearts he'll minister to us just according that we have need of and so that's something that even I mean you look look at look at Sunday what look how with brother George brother George was taking it in a manner it was almost like we're sitting around a fire and he's just going through the scriptures in that way why that's brother George's gift if brother George I couldn't speak like brother George brother George couldn't speak like me it's the gift that's in his life and so every man God so fixed that that a man has a way of a certain approach every ministerial gift he has an approach to the word of God and so God does that that's that's the great uh uh uh uh I can't think of the word out of the Ephesians but it it is a diversity it's a that God has among uh the gifts and forgive me the word doesn't come to me right now but it's out of Ephesians 4 but but Paul speaks of that so I want to deal with this a little bit more on the order of spiritual gifts and uh I really want to hone in tonight on a part here when we're looking at interpretation and looking at prophecy and I I'm going to to move into that just a little bit more tonight but then I'm going to move into a different angle of it to show how when the prophet is speaking of things about a direct message and the things that he's saying within that uh because there there is there is another angle to it it's not something that's off but we want to see what the prophet is saying as well as what it says within the scriptures as well so Paul said when he's dealing with you know with tongues he said I think my God I speak with tongues more than you all now Paul was not talking about the different languages he knew he actually spoke in tongues but this would have been in his prayer closet maybe at home or why he's out he so you know this is what he was dealing with and so yet in the church once again I had rather speak five words with my understanding that by my voice I might teach others also than 10,000 words in an unknown tongue notice it's about others so it's not about even where Paul was dealing in another place of the scripture how be it Brethren when you come together one has a song one has a this one has a that one has a that I as I said before I do not believe that those those individuals they were doing things to be wrong I believe that they felt like I must do something I I must do something within this service I must do that and because of that because the prophet tells us he he goes very very clear he says You must remember he says when we're looking at things is it the gift or is it the Holy Spirit he said because the gift always wants to work but is it the Holy Spirit leading that gift so it's you see what's happening think about the time we're living in we're living in the adoption of the Sons and Daughters of God the gifts and things returned at isua street but there was a great mixture in there and then you find it traveling over coming to a place to where when the message of the hour strikes and the word begins to come forth now remember for the prophet when he first seen it operating he didn't know what was taking place and then it was really confusing when he saw one man who was genuine and another man who himself as a vessel was false yet it was the genuine Holy Spirit speaking through him giving a genuine interpretation and remember the prophet was he he didn't understand that but you see God revealed that to him out of the book of Hebrews chapter 6 the rain falls on the just and unjust right I mean you don't go out in your garden and say hey weeds don't receive any water just for the flowers all receive it right all receive that and then we come over to Matthew 24 false Christ so we have all of these things and God God gave us a word in this hour not when he gave the word it was to bring BR us into rest it was to speak peace to our lives because if God has placed anything in the church we do not have to be scared about it we do not have to be intimidated about it we don't even have to lock it up we just need the order of the Holy Spirit by the word to put it in the order that he gave it and when it's like that then we can rest we can have peace and we can look to God so remember one word that the prophet will use over and over with among the Pentecostal people and with the gifts he says You must reverence those gifts and he says in another place he says I believe it's in the message of all things he said you have taken genuine articles of God and made a tradition out of it how did they do that you think how can you make a tradition out of speaking in tongues out of interpretation out of all these other things because when it becomes a necessity of having to be done when the prophet said that every one of these nine spiritual gifts are in every local assembly yet yet the only one that as far as you know in in in where we're at that you would see or hear would be of tongues and prophecy and yet like the gift of faith when Brothers have come I think like brother Daryl Ward other brothers that that have such a gift of faith I think like brother Ron Spencer when I mean God is that their Ministries nobody else you can't parallel that and say well I'm going to be like brother r or I'm going to be like brother no no they God God put gift in their life and they're so geared in a way that you can say well I I want I want brother Ron's I'm just pick on him but but you know just to say well I want brother Ron to preach like brother Tim or or or he would preach like brother Harold hildbrand he's not that man but God has put a gift in his life that's right are you with me I'm not elevating I'm just trying to say you know those of you that youve heard brother Ron it really is a word that's building faith is that right you've catched that so sometimes there's there's things I'm not elevating any man I'm just trying to get you to see that these gifts they are also they're working in many different ways through the body like that gift of healing for the young for the mother who was setting behind that one that had the baby and it was pressed on her heart go pray go pray for him she no no no I'm not going to go I'm not going to go and finally she just got him ask the mother she said if you don't mind I got to get this off my heart would you mind if I pray for your baby and and she said after I pray for him I want you to keep your prayer card and I want you to go on up there in line but can I do you mind if I get this off my heart she said sir go ahead and she prayed for and when when the mother came up with the child that night in the prayer line the Holy Spirit called it out and said ma'am your your baby was suffering with this and this but it was healed before the service when that mother prayed for your baby and brother brandom Ties That in see nobody would have known that nobody would have known that it was something that was just taking place throughout the body yes [Music] right and I always I've always admired this part of the quote too I've always admired the humility to where that lady she said now you going on up in the prayer line and you let brother Brandon pray for him she never said bless God I've got the thus sayith the Lord the word of the Lord I it would to those are little things like that that just stands out to me that always has over the years just watching the the approach the humility within that but see we would have you nobody would have ever known that and and and like the prophet said he said God he said that mother would have more compassion being a mother than what I would even have in my prayer so so you know this is why remember always Lord I'm always I want to be available to you and so that's where the availability how do I stay available just keep things out of your life sure we're going to have offenses come we're going to have things that come our way we're going to have misund under we're going to have that we're going to disappoint things are going to happen but listen this the whole thing is Lord don't let me become clogged up let me be free at any time that you can use me that's how we want to live is that right we want to live in that way so notice Paul you know he's placing the proper usage of tongues and I want to just drop this in here a little bit he says in verse 13 let him that prayeth in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret so if he's speaking in an unknown tongue uh Paul said pray that he may interpret why because if he's speaking in an unknown tongue now I want you to listen very carefully to where that it raises to be heard and known pray that he may interpret are you with me let me go to another scripture here in in verse 27 and 28 and hopefully this will give some understanding with things if any man speak in an unknown tongue Let It Be by two or three and that by course and let one interpret that's out in the congregation okay but if there be no interpreter let him keep silence in the church and let him speak to himself and to God now notice let him keep silent in the church now though you've heard it on tape you've heard it here youve heard where it raises and it's to be heard and yet there's there's a there's a pastor right now that I could call out and I've been to minister and to preach and if you get close and here he is he set right on the end of the Pew and I tell you what he gets to enjoy in the word so well you don't hear it but I can look over and you can to see here he is there's tongues that's coming out but you don't hear it as far as like where it's you understand what I'm saying where it's taking over that's why like in a service in a meeting the glory of God can fall but it will not be where where you know where just tongues are in such a loud place like that there can be that part where this little one this little here this little over there because that that can happen in that way so that's what Paul is talking about when he's saying keep silence in the church in other words it's not raising to the volume where everything shuts down right and we're listening for it that's good so here we come into tongues and interpretations and I want to just say it in this way this is not I love how the prophet lays this out it's not a person's thoughts I want you to listen to me very carefully it's not an impression it's not even a feeling it's not even a person that maybe they're observing something in the assembly and they think oh man and they just get so burdened and all of a sudden it just no that's flesh that's carnal you you I hope you understand let me just let me bring it to the other side on the ministering side brother Bram will say where he sees he said the ministers they they see the weak places and they begin in study on there but do you realize that even as a minister there are things that as the pastor here that it's not just looking at things and all of a sudden I'm trying to correct everything from the platform I can I can only go as God is bringing things by inspiration there has been many times where things that even at times where I've studied out and I've shared this with you at times and all of a sudden I I just can't feel the the leeway to bring maybe we're right in the middle of a series I can't even feel the leeway to bring it I'm thinking here it is 400 p.m. I mean I was I was you know I was everything was just I was just building up and everything and all of a sudden God changes things why it's because of the needs it's the needs but it's not about oh we need to do this and we need to correct that when in that way that would be very in for even a minister that's a fleshly way that's good right I never forget my father-in-law he tells me a story that uh there was a man that was down there he came in a minister and he came in he was preaching to brother mccormix in Mansfield man he was just preaching and all of a sudden brother brother McCormick got up after me he said brother the brother sat down he said I know whose house she was at [Music] yesterday see that one discernment of the Holy Spirit he was at somebody's house in the congregation and so he was just going [Laughter] to God bless brother McCormick but it's true you know sometimes there's things that got to be said like that that it'll set the Sheep at ease right because how many how many times we've come in here whether it be with a guest minister or maybe in you're in another uh a special meeting somewhere but or or God will bring in a minister or maybe it's right here right right right through this channel right here and there's things you're sitting there and you're like dear Lord he doesn't even know the conversation he doesn't even know this and is right I don't know it but God knows it or whoever the vessel that God would use it's God Discerning and God declaring himself to you or I yes sir Now watch how this with tongue's interpretation so it's it's God's thoughts brother brah says a word is a thought expressed first it must be a thought and then it becomes a word because you do not speak your words without a thought when we speak in tongues we have no thought it's God taking the thoughts it's God's thought using our lips we don't think or know what you're saying when you're speaking in tongues if it's inspired speaking when you interpret you don't know what you're saying you just say it now let me I'm going to work with this a little bit that's all that's God and prophesying you're not using your own thoughts it's because it's God you you say things that you ordinarily wouldn't think about saying so when you look at this with with interpreting and I think this is a a very key thing to point out uh interpreting if you look at the bottom part it's to unfold the meaning of what is said to explain or to expound upon something to ex to unfold what is being said now how does that interpretation come now well it comes it comes by divine inspiration because whether it's the same individual who speaking in tongues that then it changes over to interpretation or there is interpretation that gift that Spirit working in conjunction with that of the tongues and the prophet would say it over and over he's he says he tells us what's the rise and fall here and it must match the rise and fall here so in other words it cannot be a message this long in tongues and the interpretation is this long something's wrong and then he's talking about even the rise and the fall he said in the nouns and the pronouns and and all those other things and that that to me is beyond my pay grade when you get to looking at languages but you know how does interpretation come I think this is I so thank God for the message of the hour because you know what the message of the hour did the revealed word it it it brings back it brings it back to the written word right to where the word of God is the absolute of the believer amen amen so notice he said and God being misunderstood if you haven't listened to this message in a while questions and answers God being misunderstood man it's really good within these things that we're covering brother B says in the interpretation of tongues many people interpret tongues by an extraordinary expression of them feeling to say such a thing that's not interpretation so notice catch what he's divining that out the there see said many interpret based on what they're feeling that's an extraordinary expression that's not interpretation interpretation is when you are speaking in an unknown tongue you are hearing them in English or whatever your native language is I know some of you speak both but you know however God will work with that and just repeating over what they're saying so you're hearing it in the person who's doing the interpreting is actually hearing it being spoken in their own native language so let's say for example it might be you know brother Aaron he's speaking in Africans and the spirit of God Falls and he's speaking in in Africans I don't know africant but the spirit of God the same Spirit of inspiration that would cause him to speak in an unknown another tongue is the same holy spirit that would help me and give me the understanding of what's being said in English yes sir so you see it's not oh I don't know africon that's not what it is that's not what interpretation is that and brother Ram goes into that here in this message question question and answers God being misunderstood it's not like when Brother Carlos stands up here when we did that funeral here for his father-in-law he heard me in English He interpreted to them in Spanish he heard me in English He interpreted Spanish because he knows English and he knows Spanish that's not what it is it's there is a tongue that's going out and then the person in whom the inspiration of interpretation falls on hears it in their native language and I'm G to show you we good some scriptures here in just a moment this is why brother Ram says I do not believe that The Interpreter is interpreting the language of the person I do not believe that I believe that the spirit is present and The Interpreter is prophesying and he goes on to say he says now he says and if you are speaking in an unknown tongue and interpreting you are hearing in the language that you were born in because that's the only way you can interpret what what what they're saying the Holy Spirit has interpreted it to you and you're just speaking for the holy spirit so once again it's like if if you know if uh if if brother brother Aaron maybe brother Aaron is speaking in French I don't know French but if he's but the Holy Spirit here drops and there is now a tongues that goes forth how am I going to hear it I don't I don't understand French if God if that Spirit of interpretation Falls On Me Maybe it falls on Brother Richard he's going to hear it in his native language that's right right that that's that that's scripture now let's look at a few scriptures here acts 2:4 remember brother brandham if you listen to the message debate on tongues brother Bram goes right into this he says and how they came out the Bible says coming out of the upper room they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance see this is why that remember the Pentecostals like to go and say well the evidence is is speaking in tongues but it's unknown tongues well that's not the scripture everybody understood what they were saying there was a message are you hearing me there was a message and that message was of the resurrection and the atonement what has been promised has come and you know what it didn't call out any names but it hit the target and hearts were pricked they knew who they were that's the kind of direct message I'm going to talk about tonight they knew their names were not called out of that multitude but they knew who who was they knew they were being spoken to out of a whole multitude it was as though their name was being called because their heart was being convicted that's so good that's so good so that's one of the ways with direct message I want to deal with tonight here a little bit notice acts 278 and they were all amazed and marveled saying one to another behold are not all these which speak galileans and how hear we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born isn't God marvelous this Feast remember brother George was kind of going into this the other day the Feast of Pentecost because three times a year all the males were to appear before the Lord and how God had it so fixed to where they would be gathered from other countries you know why because they needed to hear this message and take it back to their countries that's why brother Ram says when Phillip went to the unic the unic he said had been there at Pentecost and was on his way back and that's why he was asking the questions he was asking so good oh my so good hallelujah oh brother and sister what a privileged people we are I say thank you God for your mercy amen amen so interpretation is is prophecy we can go into you know in cornelius's house the same thing and so prophecy itself let me just read that uh capitalized portion it is a discourse emanating from divine inspiration and declaring the purposes of God now watch this whether by reproving admonishing the wicked or comforting The Afflicted or revealing things hidden so there's one part of it that deals with uncovering hindrances in a person's life what might be hindering them from obtaining their healing you see that example I gave you of that Sunday school teacher where she had that hidden in her subconscious of an act that she had committed while her husband was away she was so anxious so tense and and she had been asking God Lord forgive me she repented but brother Bram tell said you didn't sin against God you sinned against your marriage vow and once that was broken and this is just a little Sidetrack you know her husband was the Deacon and at the church down there and brother BR said well no wonder what's wrong with brother Johnson's Church down there and the man came in and he said I'm going to resign brother said oh no no no no no you you you all don't have to do that get right with God and then go on and serve God see see sometimes you understand what I'm saying sometimes the focus becomes uh just like of the resigning and I'm not saying there aren't there aren't times for things to step aside that to me is just a part in humility is that okay that's just a part in humility it would be like you know somebody singing specials and things like that and all of a sudden you know they get caught up in the world and other things like that I think it would show humility and fruits and build back confidence for them just to sit down for a while whether it's Ministry and on and on why that's humility so so what the prophet is dealing with right there is he the the main thing is about let's not focus on the wrong things it's just like a person said I got to get this music out of my room I got to get this you're focusing on the wrong thing say God get it out of my heart amen get it out of my heart amen see it's got to focus on the heart the devil is always there to try to point our attention in so many other ways why he's a deceiver he's settle he does not want to be uncovered but when we can look at it and say God I want to really deal with the source of the issue then the Holy Spirit can come and move down on our behalf the Lord oh my now notice this is where the scripture let me I want to read this just for our background we've we've read read this many times and brother br says how that or this Paul says therefore the whole church be come together into one place all speak with tongues there come in those that are unlearned unbelievers they will say you're on mad so if there's just speaking in tongues and people just going around people say what is this right and and the the the the very serious thing about that and this is why one of the times this is why one of the burdens that the prophet it never happened again in the Tabernacle but his desire was was to get the gifts into a room once they had accumulated and come to a place it never it never came back to to a fruition in that way but the reason that he even in doing that is because he said the unlearned are among us and he was seeing things where people would be chewing gum he was seeing things where people wouldn't bow their head where people and he was so what it was it was a concern for those people let me just say this while we're on a side note there's many times if there's a real uh and not every need is important but sometimes if there's a real serious need this would have behooved to every for parents for for young people for all of us is not a time to be looking around there are spirits that are being dealt with that's right it's a time to Bow our heads in prayer and if it's called hey let's bow our heads in prayer here's here's a need that's right here you don't have to know what the need is many times those needs are so serious but if that's a time when those happen that's a time that we don't want to be we don't want to be irest towards things we want to enter right in and pray alongside with so that goes right along with this as well Lord but if all prophesy and there come in one that believeth not or one unlearned so if there's a prophecy he is convinced of all he's judged of all that word judge is like a forensic sight right right and what's a forensic like they have the forensic psychologist right whe what a job I mean to go look at a crime scene and they have to be able to the bullets there the gloves there and they're looking at this they're looking at that what are they trying to do they're trying to piece together the evidence and that's what Paul the word that's used judged it's like a forensic it's like a investigating where the spirit of God has come down for what purpose not embarrassment are are you hearing me it's not embarrassment it's a about there's a need brother BR says maybe they come up for prayer and there's something and saying brother do you believe in Divine Healing I do I do believe in Divine Healing brother what you know is there anything that's wrong I don't know and so the brothers come up and maybe one that has a you know they're praying and brother BR says the how God will work to bring that release in that person's life because let me just say this to you the holy spirit will never bless over unconfessed sin it's got to be according to the correct Channel that's why the prophet would tell us he he cares do you care and throughout the message the comfort and other places he said we know what the Cure is but we got to find the cause so good if you don't find the cause it won't do no good right and we we've been through some of those things with that I I want to keep moving into this thought here watch how watch this he is convinced of all he's judged of all and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest so falling down on his face he will worship God and Report that God is in you of a truth that's what a Believer will do maybe they walk in unlearned but here God speaks to their heart and right there they they'll respond to it but someone else could say I don't not me I'm not it well we can't we can't do anything about that they they go on brother BR says if you speak with tongues in the adoption series it can't be just some repeating of scripture cuz God said don't use vain repetition it's a message directly to somebody Now watch how he PR pairs this with prophecy ask me one time put your finger on one time that the Holy Spirit ever under the discernment he's talking about on the platform told somebody repeated a scripture over and over you see what he's doing he's paralleling it as the same now now remember the same thing that was taking place here through the prophet's Ministry was not a gift of Prophecy yet it was the Same Spirit of Prophecy but it was through a Prophet this that we're speaking of one of the nine spiritual gifts is the gift of Prophecy and the prophet would go over and over all the way through the message and says no one judges a prophet but a prophecy that is given must be judged that's why all all the way all the way through the message Rapture all all the way down through he's constantly he's dividing that out between a gift of Prophecy yet it's the same Spirit working to uncover to make known hidden things to help to minister right remember the lady who was had her heart was all worked up it was affecting things in her church deep called to deep remember she comes up there and my heart always goes to that lady she stands right there she's you could just you could just sense she's tore up and the Holy Spirit comes and he reveals to her oh he says that there was a man who professed divine healing and and he said you was a witch and he did he said sister that's nothing but a lie that that whole that whole lie has got your your heart all worked up right there what was it that was not something uncovering something hidden in her life it was the Comfort to The Afflicted Hallelujah so prophecy is also Comfort to The Afflicted to dispel doubts let me tell you something he works even while the word is being preached Spirits are broken hearts are deserted because it is the holy spirit that is among us we have been taught as children of God that I don't have to wait to a certain time of a service to get my answer God knows my need it might come through a song special it might come while worships going on it might come right while the preaching of the word it might come at the end but God has my answer amen hallelujah Hallelujah the days of teing are over Hallelujah watch brother R says notice he said it always told him something that was wrong with them something they had done something they must do and something had happened or something like that so is speaking in tongues and interpretation and he gives an example let brother Neville raise up and another brother give interpretation tell this man yesterday he went out there done something wrong you done the doctor told him today he had cancer go make that thing right come back here and get right with God see that's that's one angle and watch this Gabriel's instructions to Daniel brother brandom will you have any more healing services in the Tabernacle with discernments no no 1961 the discernments will be given by our other board we have brother Neville here now who has a gift of Prophecy that prophesies over the sick and makes known to them the things that they have need of knowing right wow I go into this in a different service but that was happening right at the altar but it got to be to a place that people were so depending on wanting and and they were pulling things out of brother Neville to where brother brandham had to go to him because the people said hey there's things being spoken that's not happening and brother Bram had to correcting brother B tells it very plainly here but see that's now that was happening that's not out there that's also prophecy it can be right there in a prayer line and you know what that's judged right away if a person says that ain't me that's good then you know what the right thing to say for the person doing it believe me I know would be to say God forgive me instead of saying no you know you had it I'll leave that alone but see there's things right now that when we're standing in the midst of these things right here you see just because something this is where one of the nine spiritual gifts I don't care if it's hit every time in the past 10 out of 10 if it's a gift of Prophecy it's got to be judged every single time that's good you understand we're not going on a track record we're going on at that particular time and if somebody comes through the line and says no that ain't me that ain't me oh there's things I could tell you about it notice brother bam says concerning brother Neville did I read the rest of that oh yeah I did what a relief that is for me at home look brother brandom coming home he's like what a relief this is Brother Neville has this gift what a relief it is for me at home why is it a relief for you at home brother because I can rest that discernment on the prophetic side just tears me down and God has sent me some relief for that through prophecy speaking in tongues interpretation which is prophecy which prophecy is to speak in tongues so he so notice God sent me some relief and the prophet was thankful what he saw that man this is because it's in the same messages where he's saying oh he said we're beginning to see things just hitting right on the line you know Out Among the congregation oh as the gifts keep accumulating then we want to come here to a place and really set them even further in order now let's look at this part because this is where we even as assembly because like I said uh if if you don't have it depends on you know if it gets to a place to where we have a a real collection of gifts and and we see how things how things are uh within it then that's when you know if God uh directs us to make that change because I believe the prophet he had wisdom in what he was speaking about wanting to put it in a room but let me just say this to you I'm not anxious about putting it in a room that doesn't mean that I'm against the room right because I've heard some kind of some snide comments about those things which I I really don't think should be made but I look at it in this way is that these are things that you know what if God if that God God will take us to where we need to be and he'll give us the unction at the right time that is so good so you know because everything it we stand up on the word God will give the unction we need at the time it's rest so notice when we noticed in the after service which is the after the ministering of the word even even at times after the altar call if an alter call has been given or thing and then the Holy Spirit and brother Brown would commend different ones on how that everything was so uh done so orderly and you remember the scripture said the spirit of the prophets is subject to the prophets and the prophet said after the service was over and the blessing of God would come down upon the congregation then they would begin to speak then they begin to magnify God and every time it was a direct message to somebody now now watch this that direct message he said you have to watch it it just isn't something fleshly it'll be a message to somebody for somebody to do something or something to edify the Church it'll be something to glorify the church so it's not vain repetition but it is a message either to directly to someone maybe uh don't go to the job tomorrow and this and this and that and that's it's you know it's got to be judged uh or you know uh something comes and it's you know a person it's uncovering something there in their life well I'll tell you that's judged right there you know what I mean you you know that's judged right there the person knows whether or not they have anything in their life you see you see what I'm saying that's why the things like when brother BR was pointing and hopefully I can get to that not tonight but you know even as it's coming through when God was using Brother Neville right there in the Tabernacle for those things and uh just to look at it in this way it'll be something to edify the church or to glorify the church so this is another angle of Prophecy and when I say another angle I'm not talking about another another teaching I'm talking about another side of it because it's not just the side of judging convicting there is a part that was within that but brother Bram goes into this and the scripture says here in verse 31 for all may prophesy one for one by one that all may learn and may be comforted the prophet said it's got to be exact not some repeating Jesus said don't use vain repetitions watch this words it's got to be something directly to somebody or to help the church or or to help the cause so sometimes and you see in just a few of the places that I'll get to tonight when the Holy Spirit brother Bram is going in maybe I'll just go and refer to the one one of the places uh in questions and answers on the Holy Ghost the prophet refers back to the previous night which um that tape they don't have uh you know on an Evidence they don't have that tape that recording it's only what is the Holy Ghost what's it given for and then it goes into question answers but the prophet refers back to that in that statement and questions and answers on the Holy Ghost and he's talking about how that you know if I was able to be here Pastor long enough and stay around here and not have to travel this is how I'd set the church in order and he's talking about getting the gifts to meet before service and all these things that he's talking about and then he goes in and references to the people what took place just the previous night am I going too quick everybody with me he refer first what was going on the previous night he says if you'll notice those they said those uh two confirming things that happened in the meeting he said the tongues and the prophecy was given and he said and notice how the one when is speaking out blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord and he said at that time he said it caught me and I said in other words blessed is he that has come in this and brother Bram said as soon as that was said and open he said if you remember the Holy Spirit fell in the building and he said the reason what was happening is Satan was sitting on people's shoulders and the devil was telling them you don't have to receive the Holy Ghost now you don't need to have it right now you don't need to do it right now he said but the Holy Spirit came back around in Vindication to the message and brother brandom listen now listen I'm just going to drop this in for free brother bram's own sister said brother uh brother Bill Bill when all those people then when the Holy Spirit fell and everybody started screaming and started worshiping I had the most awful feeling come over me and I didn't like feeling that way brother Bram said that's the time you should have worshiped hallelujah hallelujah Satan was only trying to cool you down Hallelujah you see how the devil does he was telling some people don't respond don't do this and then this is instruction when you feel that cooling down it's not the Holy G that's cooling you down that's the time to press through Hallelujah I say boo devil boo devil you're not worthy you're not this no I'm going to press through hlah let me tell you the devil has never held the mystery to your life he doesn't know you his statements don't Define you your life is defined by the word of almighty God your life is not even defined by your failures it's not even defined by your successes it's not even defined by your feelings your word your life is defined by the word of [Music] [Applause] God hallelujah that is so good Hallelujah can you turn with Me 2 Chronicles chapter 20 oh my oh my Hallelujah somebody say thank you Jesus amen now I'm not going to read this whole thing you can read it when you get home but brother Brown refer to this account over and over when he talks about the spirit of God falling in the congregation when there was a need now you can read in here when you get home it was a need because there was an Army that was invading Judah and that was Moab Moab was coming against them Jehoshaphat and Judah gathers to have prayer and they begin to pray and Jehoshaphat begins to talk to the Lord and just speak to the Lord as as fathers wives children everybody's gathered together and they're talking to the Lord now I want you to even notice the order here after he had finished talking in verse 13 and the Bible said and all Judah stood before the Lord with their little ones their wives and their children verse 14 then upon jeziel the son of Zachariah the son of beniah the son of Jil the son of matiah a levite of the sons of Asaf came the spirit of the Lord in the midst of the congregation he said hearken ye all Judah ye inhabitants of Jerusalem Thou King of Jehoshaphat thus sayith the Lord unto you be Not Afraid nor dismayed by the reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but God's tomorrow go you down against them behold they'll come up by the cliff I could read the rest of it but he goes on to tell him you're not going to need to fight stand still you're going to see the salvation of the Lord and after it's all said and done the Bible tells us Jehoshaphat in verse 18 he bowed his head and began to worship see they were well you know what they were looking for brother Gomez they wanted to know Moab is invading us Lord what do we do so they came together and they begin to seek God I mean that's that's what we do even when we come to the house of God that's right right there's decision some times that we lord I I need answers to now God has different ways we all know this as Believers God answers in many different ways don't he sometimes the answer is always so simple it might be something we've walked by forever and God says hey go pick up that Jawbone of an ass right now and start start T start tearing up these Philistines right like like shamgar with an Oxo God all of a sudden anoints him oh this a it's been there all the whole time see God God answers in many ways so we're not we're not going to confine God to where that I've got to come through a prayer line God works through I listen I believe in prayer lines this is one preacher that believes in them I believe we need all the resources that God gives and how to God to minister to his children I believe in all everything that God has you're not taking one thing from me everything that God has this message never put nothing in a closet never locked it up but it's put everything in its rightful place and given it access and put it into the hands of Sons and Daughters of God so with that being said notice how they came out in the ible tells us they came out and begin to sing Oh My My My My in verse 21 when he had consulted with the people he appointed singers unto the Lord that should praise the beauty of Holiness as they went before the Army and to say praise the Lord for his Mercy endure forever that day they begin to worship God before they ever saw the sign of Victory see the word had already declared and gave the direction the spirit of God fa gave Direction it was settled in their hearts and they begin to worship you know that scripture right there you think there's not power right in singing of songs oh yes I mean I we ain't just singing lyrics we know but it's things that mean something personal to our heart we're singing to the beauty of his Holiness oh my I wonder sometimes if when we feel a little Gloom after we're prayed for if we just start breaking into a sing a song and just start begin to worship and push that Gloom away listen friends things are not going to be put in our lap and handed to us you'll have to fight for every Divine promise of God but let me tell you if God be for us who can be against us amen glory be to God I feel good now brother Bram addresses this in question and answers on the seals I I I just can't I I I wish I could read all those quotes I can just send them to you and uh but notice we've all been here here here's in church order brother Bram says now if you ask me should I be baptized he said that's in the Bible but he says if you say brother brandom what must I do I've got a decision here I've got to make whether I should take this church or go to another church something like that or should I do this or that now that have to come from God see see God will have to tell us that but that would come through another Ministry because the word don't say let Armen Neville leave brandom Tabernacle and go to the Fort Wayne Gospel Tabernacle he don't say that in the word here that that's what these gifts are for so if you somebody is praying about that and Lord I'm praying about this or that there's also a word of caution don't go looking to some man and say I need an answer that can be a Gifted Man but you might pull something out if if the man's not really in tune and really with understanding you might pull something out that may not it has nothing to do with a man I mean I'm talking about what happened to brother Neville so you know what it is however God wants to answer Lord I know you got my answer you got my answer if you've got to have somebody you think God can't give your phone number to somebody come on friends we're talking about the Living God who actually worked through Samuel to tell Saul where the mules were at listen if God's going to get you just have faith in God the message will get to you righten your answer will come however just be looking for his answer and don't put it in a certain frame of a man or a woman or something or or a gift but just put it just say settled on the word of God Lord I'm looking to you cuz you said if two or three agree as touching any one thing it shall be done you said I ask the father anything in my name shall be done Lord I'm standing on your word hallelujah my my my notice in the message why everybody all right amen afraid to say something if you're not huh what I told you about questions and answers on the holy ghost or the service that was preached before where the spirit of God come down and encouraged and broke that away from the people same thing happened in the message the token in treport and it was right where it should be too the spirit of God I wanted to play some of these here for you tonight but I I'm just not going to be able to because I wanted you to hear it and uh maybe I maybe I'll start out next service with just that part and then go from there but you hear it come and it is coming right according to the word and it's moving in in that place to to encourage the people of God in the promise of God now watch uh you know uh brother Bram will say it in in in this place here in the message why he's talking now I want remember this thing I'm talking about on direct message and how it comes in that way brother Bram says a tongue's interpretation has gone forth and he says now he commends the people he said now holy spirit is present he said that's exactly right in order as it should be he's at Phoenix right now and he says now what watch this now somebody in here feels the effect of that message this is just one of many places somebody in here feels the effect of that message and he says now you just wait just wait for a moment I know it's right I do believe in altar calls we're coming up and confessing things and so forth like that but in the scripture as many as believed you said it might be somebody in here that's been halfway seeking the Holy Spirit he says you run around or some sinner that doesn't know God just maybe maybe three or four trials and and just kindly unconcerned that message is sinking right down in their heart right now ever who it is this would be the hour for you now my father-in-law is sitting back there God began to deal with his life I'm sure he don't even know how in the world he ended back up in church I don't want to say he's stubborn or anything like that but but many of you remember that that that that that old building we used that other building we used to rent he was sitting right right up right right out in there now this comes back to me even more his his sister Norma had just given her life to the Lord she was sent I'm going to tell this on him too she was sitting right there in this chair and God just struck her heart in the service here she comes running I I don't know if it's I don't know if it's a month before two months I I don't remember that part of it but he comes and sits down in you know he has to sit out there in the foyer because want no room inside the congregation the funny thing he sat down in the same chair she was at as if the chair you know he turns around he all of a sudden gets up goes and sits in another chair it wasn't the chair that did anything must have thought man that's a zero hitting spot pow I don't want now I didn't see him do that there was musicians that saw him do it matter of fact it was my mom right there sge saw him do that and so but here's the thing that happened in that service that day I never forget brother Browning got up and he took his text out of Ezekiel and talking about how the how how the prophet among the people of God before they went into Exile that the message they weren't taken real serious and it says Thou Art nothing but a lovely song in other words something that's just Pleasant that's all they were taking the message as just something that's Pleasant and lovely and not really getting into it and this is why they were in Babylon and the spirit of God went right down through in that service and I never forget the Holy Spirit struck and it spoke right out in that service right after that message came forth I'm telling you it was it didn't matter what chair he was sitting in he was at the altar right he knew it was for him if he could stand up here and tell you right now he said I knew at that time that was for me that was my last opportunity you understand what I'm saying you say well shouldn't that be judged it was judged you see it's just like when the prophet tells us in question and answers when he's talking about brother Neville being up here he says right then and there that's judged right there you see what I'm saying and this is where like is I never forget Brian you know man you think it don't mean a lot were you serving the lord your kids Brian I remember Brian when he realized that his dad was standing at the altar he rean ran up there and he grabbed his feet I don't know if he's afraid he's going to run away or what but he grabbed his feet I tell you he had so many people around him that day there ain't no way he'd got out of there that is so good and watch how the prophet says this I I I I know you all don't believe me anymore when I say I'm closing but let me read this let me read this last quote and then can I do something I'll Lord willing next next time we're together here on next Thursday I I'll start out with this and then we'll move on from there CU I want you to hear this one but I'm just I'm not going to play it tonight but just listen to this end time evangelism brother Bram says those messages because something spoke right out in that service of end time evangelism and brother Bram says now notice he said he said these messages sometimes speak someone we don't know who they are sometimes they tell who they are but just someone in here that maybe just started to move away without it in other words coming back to God or what how the message was going within time evangelism and when you do remember that's the Holy Spirit speaking to a language that it just takes some inspiration the same that spoke it the same to interpret it now that's no mystery to us because how the holy spirit will come even through the preaching of the word and it's like our lives have been com combed over sometimes it comes to correct us is that right then there's other times it comes to comfort us and it's direct right it's direct you you you can you can just you can pick it up and we're always at the point of making that decision but even how the prophet was bringing this here that there is times and I have I have witnessed that I witnessed that even here in the assembly a brother was praying for a job and he was between jobs and I never forget it was during I don't know if it was during a prayer meeting or a midweek service I think it might it might have been a midweek service and the Holy Spirit just just just it spoke in that time and uh you know I'll be honest with you my my in my part of it and this is just you know how how we grow I was looking at it and I thought well it don't seem exactly exact but the Holy Spirit spoke in such a way speaking peace to that person and to that individual I'm not making anything up they it's spoke to them just be of a good cheer and be at peace with God God knows your need it went right down through the line now you see here I am standing I I'm listening for everything and you know what happened was it was exactly that brother right after the service he said you know what that was for me it was it was just that that direct you see what I'm saying that was judged right there now if things within that manner would continue and if we would see things where it's not then that's where there's some things that God would give us Grace to step in are you are you hearing me so it isn't just things that's just left open just loose but I you understand what I'm saying it's things that I've got I could read much more quotes to you but it's just to show you there's also another angle to it isn't isn't always uncovering sin sometimes there's things where God comes to bring comfort and you know what the person who's being spoke to in a direct message God can call their name and sometimes God calls in and it's as though they're the only one setting that's how you feel sometimes when the preaching of the word it's almost like turn that screen off my whole life's up there and the songs you've sung and the service and this who's done that the same Holy Spirit through a different Channel but it's the same God and you know why you know why God's doing that that's his love the prophet said it like this he said he said here's God he said he said if it was me he said I gave you my word that should be enough he said' now that's me that'd be enough he said but not God he said God loves you so much that he put five ministerial gifts to tell you what he said in here already and he said you know what if you still don't get it his love for you reaches out because he's placed nine spiritual gifts because he wants you to get what he said about you Hallelujah I feel like singing that song if that isn't love if that is in love don't you love it tonight amen I I trust I haven't been just you know just speaking from my heart and as things are coming but I trust there's some things I trust it maybe made sense and I um I also told you know with the I mentioned um with the brothers we were I was talking the other day and I said you know and it was before brother George had come and I just I this is what I I plan on doing is I get a little further here a little bit more with uh with church order and just just stay some things in that I feel like the Lord would be bringing us to I'm sure there'll be questions and so I I'd like to have times on questions and answers just to with things just pertaining to that and because maybe there's some things you thought I think I heard it this way and maybe it's this way it just allows us to polish it up okay so if if we're talking about questions on the church order please don't ask me questions on pajamas the reason I say that because brother Bram got them questions and questions and answers on the seals but but I'll say it in this way if you've got a if you've got a question we want to try to keep it around that subject but we we'll let you know that in ahead of time and if You' got question I'll say it like this if there's something that that that that I've said and you got a question about it that's been brought from here look anytime you can have my notes I I don't I don't have nothing to hide I don't have no certain quotes to hide and I keep other quotes if there's a quote I ain't seen give it to me I'll put it with the rest I I just I want all the word of God if there's something you don't let me just say it like this I'm not interested in being right I just want to be correct yes and so with that in mind there's many times I've had to say forgive me I'm wrong oh my oh I see this a little bit more and I'll tell you I have been enjoying just even going through and studying on this and how the Lord just man I've just been having such a wonderful time going through it and and uh well you know it's kind of like the cook that maybe thinks they made a good and I didn't bake anything good this is my doing but man I just love to be able to share it and I trust that God gets it across to us amen help me to get out of the way Lord so it can get across to his people amen so we Lord willing we'll do that at some time and and have that you know uh uh that that time after we've come to place with with that but I I just so thank the Lord for his Mercy don't you yes sir amen amen I tell you if there's some I believe there's things that God has spoke personally to our hearts tonight even out of a teaching message that God has spoken very clearly and you know may maybe you're the one that got the part about breaking through hey when the gloomy Spirit comes around break through that thing don't let that thing get on there well everybody else is shouting everybody else having a good time break right through that don't let that thing lay on you bust right through that thing now that don't mean making a show of your it just means you know what don't let that cooling thing hang around you You're Made To Worship the Lord that's right you might start out like this the prophet said start out waving that pinky all of a sudden now it's going like this then it's like this Hallelujah you know what this moving this right here it's a sign the rest of the hands going to be moving my arms going to be moving then eventually my torso everything else is going to be moving I'm pressing on through because God's got something for me amen amen hallelujah musicians if you come tonight amen and I know we had some different ones and brother Bill would wanted wanted prayer tonight so we want to just also just offer prayer just pray with our brother tonight for a need and let's just let's just go to the Lord here in prayer heavenly father thank you for your mercies Lord once again tonight father it's just been a wonderful it's been wonderful Lord to have been here and I believe Lord that you not only have broken the bread to us Lord and and speaking and teaching our hearts Lord to bring Lord Us in in a place Lord where our lives are edified there's a growth there's an understanding and we're not we're not walking with fear we're not walking Lord in intimidation we know that God that you you place the gifts in the church and Lord we know that sometimes Lord man and I don't believe men and people Lord for the most part all the way I'll say down through down through time I don't believe people Lord have meant to do things that's been wrong but Lord how we thank you for your leadership because you want everything Lord to be held in a manner of reverence that it that it would work effectually it's just like Lord in a life that there's so much out of a life that can be testified and spoken maybe a person that goes to school they go to their job Lord they maybe haven't said a word but their life speaks volumes and Lord Jesus we thank you for your mercies I pray tonight Lord for every one of us that's gathered here those that are streaming those that Lord would listen to this Lord I pray that if there's something that was said Lord maybe in a someone from another congregation or something I I didn't mean that I didn't mean anything for anybody else it's just Lord what I feel on my heart for here but Lord I I've not cut any angles I've not cut certain quotes and taken things out we believe it all Lord we believe this message that you've sent to us and father to give us you've given us Grace to be able to look in and see father the full counsel of God Lord I'm sure that I don't see everything the way I need to see it but I'm asking you for Grace Lord father the great wonderful things that you've given us Lord from your word and the greatest thing you could ever give us Lord is your word yourself then from there Lord every part and everything that is unpacked and unfolded Lord from every gift oh God it's because of you Lord if if there wasn't a if there wasn't a gift or even as we we had a question would you rather have some gift or may make you a great person or would you rather have the love of God In Your Heart Lord I than every one of us us could say safely I'd rather have the love of God because it's real Divine love that gives value to every gift it it it it gives the real density to that gift lord it's like we can take Lord two different balls that maybe a little ball like they have in them grocery stores at times they're so light you throw up in the air if it's a wind it'd blow it away you could get a bowling ball that's the same size but the difference is it might look the same size but the difference is the density and father it's the love of God in our life that makes the difference that's what makes a difference and that love of God that's you that's the word of God that's the Holy Spirit that's that honey of almighty God pouring down through our lives Lord help us we just love you Lord we want to be a benefit to the body we're not here Lord to chase after gifts they're in the body we just want to be available and we want Lord ask you to forgive us of our shortcomings forgive us Lord of things that dear God of anything is in our heart if there's anything Lord that is a channel that we need to empty up Lord then father we want to be available to you at all times most importantly Lord we're looking forward to that Rapture morning for you I Ram has come in view on this Mount Mariah the same one that went to Calvary in Genesis 15 is the same lamb that we see in Genesis 22 a security that Lord Jesus our life our Redemption is secure the book has been taken Lord and our life is being unfolded now I pray father Comfort your children minister to each life those different needs Among Us be with us Lord even as we would go our separate ways after
