[38:08] refill every one of us lord we pray we
[38:11] just ask these things
[38:12] lord for your glory in the name of jesus
[38:15] christ
[38:16] amen amen if you'll turn with me to
[38:20] matthew 11 once again matthew 11 verse
[38:23] 28
[38:25] amen we want to go right right back here
[38:28] into the scripture
[38:36] just trying to pick up some of the
[38:38] things that from
[38:40] some time that the lord just really
[38:42] pressed when
[38:43] when the inspiration itself was really
[38:47] dropping here and i want to if we could
[38:50] just
[38:50] look at this three verses of scripture
[38:53] here
[38:55] and the lord jesus as he says come unto
[38:58] me
[38:59] all ye that labor and our and our heavy
[39:02] laden
[39:04] and i will give you rest take my
[39:07] yoke upon you and learn of me
[39:11] for i am meek and lowly in heart
[39:14] and ye shall find rest unto your souls
[39:18] for my yoke is easy and my
[39:22] burden is light amen may god bless you
[39:25] and bless the reading of the word as
[39:27] you're being seated
[39:29] i want to just look at the the thought
[39:32] here tonight
[39:34] on being yoked with christ
[39:38] and we find that here in the scripture
[39:41] that
[39:42] the lord jesus he's giving an invitation
[39:46] and i think that's the most glorious
[39:48] glorious thing that god would give to us
[39:51] is an invitation and you know
[39:54] the invitation is very very personal of
[39:57] how that he
[39:58] would invite us that our lives could be
[40:01] changed and then molded to match his own
[40:04] character
[40:05] and he's the one that's given the
[40:07] invitation
[40:08] he's inviting us that that we might
[40:12] uh yield that he might do what only
[40:15] he can do and
[40:18] when we think of this here the lord
[40:21] jesus as he's bringing
[40:22] this together here when we look at it
[40:24] he's tying together
[40:27] this of of the rest of god and that also
[40:31] of the yoke and showing that his
[40:34] his rest it is where it is
[40:37] that where it is a complete finished
[40:41] work and it's him that
[40:44] is performing what he
[40:47] has already spoken in his word what he
[40:50] already saw
[40:51] concerning you or i and so within that
[40:55] rest
[40:55] we we recognize that this rest israel
[40:58] was given a rest
[40:59] as far as a day that they were to uh to
[41:03] keep
[41:03] in memorial to uh the the finished works
[41:06] of god
[41:07] and we recognize that this this rest
[41:10] itself
[41:11] is where god would pour out of his own
[41:14] life
[41:14] and where that the very burden of sin
[41:18] would be lifted from the life because
[41:22] there's there's no way that a person can
[41:25] actually serve god under the lord of sin
[41:29] so there has to be a relieving
[41:32] of that burden and of that load of sin
[41:35] and we recognize
[41:37] that god there's no one and no one could
[41:39] do this
[41:40] but god came down and he became flesh
[41:44] and he himself became our burden
[41:47] bearer he he took our sins there in
[41:50] gethsemane
[41:52] were there where the decision was made
[41:54] when every all the
[41:55] demons of hell were gathered around and
[41:58] there
[41:59] in the garden of gethsemane the decision
[42:01] was made
[42:02] the battle was won the overcoming
[42:06] was set forth there in gethsemane
[42:08] nevertheless
[42:09] not my will thy will be done
[42:13] we recognize that the scripture would
[42:16] tell us that
[42:17] jesus endured the cross despising the
[42:20] shame of it
[42:21] for the joy that was set before him so
[42:24] the cross he he endured the cross
[42:27] despising the shame because it was
[42:30] what was set before him that joy and
[42:33] that is
[42:34] that his own life the achievement
[42:37] of his life coming to bring you and i
[42:41] loosening the very burden of sin from
[42:44] our life
[42:45] that we might be united with him
[42:48] let me just say it like this that burden
[42:50] of sin
[42:52] you understand that there's been times
[42:54] that in
[42:55] your life and so forth where maybe
[42:57] you've had a disagreement with someone
[42:59] or
[42:59] or something has come up maybe there's
[43:01] been something that's been done
[43:03] maybe you've been wrong and yet it
[43:05] sometimes can be
[43:07] uh hard to maybe look at that person or
[43:10] to see that person or you feel
[43:12] funny of how am i going to respond to
[43:14] them or maybe
[43:15] you did something that you know i
[43:17] shouldn't have done that's a
[43:18] condemnation
[43:20] you're feeling and you're not feeling a
[43:22] liberty and that
[43:23] that is on a very natural level but how
[43:26] much greater
[43:27] on a spiritual level to where that the
[43:30] where that the enemy the one who has
[43:33] laid the traps the one who has ensnared
[43:35] it
[43:36] and because of that first nature then he
[43:38] would come
[43:39] and want to bring condemnation and say
[43:42] well
[43:42] there's no hope for you you can't go on
[43:45] or
[43:46] and and look at your life but it's to
[43:48] recognize
[43:49] that god never expects you nor
[43:52] requires you to serve him under
[43:54] condemnation
[43:56] but quite the contrary he comes to lift
[43:59] and remove that condemnation so that you
[44:02] can serve him
[44:04] freely so you're not serving him
[44:08] under a burden of sin and the real
[44:10] burden of sin
[44:12] is not all the sins that's been
[44:14] committed it's
[44:15] the nature on the inside that is
[44:18] contrary to the word and that's why paul
[44:21] said that the
[44:22] carnal mind is enmity
[44:25] against god because the carnal mind is
[44:28] always about
[44:29] what it can do and i can do this and i
[44:32] can do that
[44:33] the carnal mind is enmity to god but it
[44:36] is the spiritual mind
[44:38] and the only way that we can have a
[44:40] spiritual mind is the holy spirit
[44:42] begins to awaken us to his presence to
[44:45] his reality
[44:46] that there's one here that's greater
[44:49] than me
[44:50] or as jesus could say there's one in the
[44:52] temple
[44:53] that's greater than the temple there's
[44:55] one greater than our own will
[44:57] greater than our own a morality greater
[45:01] than our own strength
[45:02] there's one who is greater
[45:06] and this is why that that when we look
[45:09] at the rest of god and
[45:11] jesus his invitation is come unto me
[45:15] and you will find rest for your souls
[45:19] that rest that where the labor cease
[45:23] and jesus brings us together and he
[45:26] brings it in a manner that would be very
[45:28] familiar
[45:29] the rest the the the hebrews knew about
[45:32] the rest the jews knew about the rest
[45:34] but now he brings it even into a place
[45:37] that they would understand
[45:38] that his rest that entering into that
[45:41] rest is to become
[45:43] yoked with him now when you think of a
[45:46] yoke we know that
[45:48] uh a yoke itself as jesus is placing
[45:50] here
[45:51] we we recognize that that is that is
[45:54] what goes
[45:55] upon that of oxen or beast of burden or
[45:59] bullocks
[46:00] and and there's a wagon where there's a
[46:01] plow there's there's a service to be
[46:04] performed now
[46:05] in this country here uh you'd be kind of
[46:08] hard-pressed to find
[46:10] uh the bullock and the oxen and them
[46:12] pulling the carts but
[46:14] you know when i was in the philippines
[46:16] that was nothing to see that
[46:18] it was nothing to go by uh the rice
[46:20] fields and see
[46:21] the water buffalo uh the that of the the
[46:24] oxen of the bullet and here it is
[46:26] it's it's harnessed to a plow and maybe
[46:29] there's a little boy behind it or
[46:30] or you find one that's pulling a carton
[46:33] a cart of maybe a produce that's going
[46:36] into
[46:37] the area the even though the the
[46:40] the ox itself it has power
[46:44] and the ox itself is built to be able to
[46:47] pull
[46:47] that wagon with the produce or the plow
[46:50] or whatever
[46:50] but there's got to come that which will
[46:54] tie together
[46:55] that oxen to the load to the burden
[46:58] to the plow to the wagon and there's
[47:01] only one thing
[47:02] that can do that and that's a yoking
[47:04] together
[47:06] and the yoke itself is that which which
[47:09] brings uh the uniting together and this
[47:12] is where jesus could say
[47:14] and he brings together the yoke of the
[47:16] word and the rest of the holy spirit
[47:19] because within the yoke if we just
[47:21] simply put it in this manner
[47:22] the yoke is the word amen
[47:26] it's the word but in order
[47:30] to be you in order to be really
[47:33] yoked when he's saying take upon take my
[47:36] yoke
[47:36] upon you he's this is an invitation you
[47:40] take
[47:40] my yoke upon you but the only way that
[47:43] yoke can be taken
[47:44] is it is necessary that the spirit of
[47:48] god
[47:48] is the one who brings the harnessing to
[47:51] the world
[47:53] you see we can carry the bible we can
[47:55] carry the message
[47:56] we can know it we can quote it but
[47:59] that's not
[48:00] being harnessed to it to be harnessed to
[48:03] the word
[48:04] to actually take the yoke upon is where
[48:07] our life actually reflects the life of
[48:11] the word
[48:11] and we've been united by the holy ghost
[48:14] that's not a work of man
[48:16] that's not a work of man you could have
[48:18] every man in the world pray for you
[48:20] a man can't give you the holy ghost it
[48:23] takes god to give you the holy ghost
[48:26] but god never overrides our sovereign
[48:29] will
[48:32] many times we want to see things change
[48:34] or we want to see
[48:35] this life change and listen we ought to
[48:37] pray and what we're praying for
[48:39] we're looking to the god of what he has
[48:42] done in our life
[48:43] he's the same god that brings the change
[48:46] in other lives
[48:49] is that right the word the word will
[48:51] never override our will
[48:54] it will not do it it must be a
[48:56] surrendering of our will
[48:58] nevertheless not my will thy will be
[49:01] done
[49:02] amen is that right
[49:06] so now think back to the to the services
[49:10] we were looking at on thursday and on
[49:12] sunday
[49:13] and when jesus here he is standing and
[49:16] he reveals himself
[49:17] as the lord of the sabbath what
[49:20] was that given as a rest of the memorial
[49:24] of a finished work here the lord jesus
[49:27] stands within that moment and he speaks
[49:30] to the man
[49:31] with a withered hand he speaks to the
[49:34] man that has
[49:35] an infirmity he speaks remember to the
[49:38] one
[49:38] who does not have any eyes he spits upon
[49:41] the ground
[49:42] makes clay puts it on him and now the
[49:44] man receives his sight
[49:46] we find on and on that many
[49:49] of the miracles and creation and
[49:51] restoring of life
[49:53] but i want you to understand this the
[49:55] withered hand
[49:56] did not come and be made whole
[50:00] because simply the word was spoken
[50:03] then the man did not get up off of the
[50:05] clock simply because the word was spoken
[50:08] the eyes did not come about simply
[50:11] because the word
[50:12] was spoken there had to be a belief
[50:16] in him who was speaking and
[50:19] obeyed now the man could not was not had
[50:23] his eyes
[50:24] he himself did not put that a clay upon
[50:27] his life
[50:28] but obedience is citing in
[50:31] in unison and confession to what the
[50:34] word
[50:35] is saying
[50:40] so this is it's very important the word
[50:42] it will never
[50:43] override our own will
[50:47] and jesus would set it forth in the uh
[50:50] set forth in the gospels we can go back
[50:52] in the old testament
[50:54] james will pick it up and we find on and
[50:56] on that no man can serve
[50:58] two masters he's either going to love
[51:00] one
[51:01] and hate the other it's impossible to
[51:04] serve
[51:04] two masters and so when we
[51:08] when we think of this i want to just
[51:10] take this example that
[51:12] uh that the lord through this this
[51:14] message the
[51:15] ever-present water from the rock and i
[51:18] want you to look how we
[51:19] as we're going through this tonight this
[51:21] is just what stood out to me some weeks
[51:23] ago
[51:23] when looking at this thought on what
[51:25] burden and
[51:27] looking at god's working
[51:30] with israel to bring israel out of egypt
[51:34] that was all god and i don't think
[51:36] there's anybody here
[51:37] that would dispute that israel got in a
[51:41] place
[51:41] hey they were comfortable in egypt for a
[51:43] long time
[51:44] but eventually things started to tighten
[51:47] down
[51:48] there's things that started to become
[51:50] personal to them
[51:51] they started to cry out they were
[51:53] praying but now their prayers
[51:55] the changing of the prayers remember god
[51:57] doesn't hear it's not
[51:59] in our prayer that the words that god
[52:01] hears that's not what god hears
[52:03] god hears the motive and objective of
[52:06] our heart
[52:08] it's what's behind the heart that's why
[52:10] you know
[52:11] you know when we're praying that's why
[52:13] brother brown talked about the little
[52:15] boy
[52:15] that just said the abcs he said because
[52:18] i don't know what words to say
[52:19] but he said and brother branson after
[52:21] all it's not our words that he's
[52:23] listening to
[52:24] it is the motives and objectives of our
[52:26] heart
[52:29] now i want you to think of this journey
[52:32] here was
[52:33] israel down in egypt god was working on
[52:36] their heart
[52:37] and the same time that god is working on
[52:39] their heart he's also working
[52:41] on moses heart it's god working
[52:44] to bring this together
[52:48] now brother bran said now when israel
[52:50] was over in goshen just having a
[52:52] glorious time
[52:53] the sun never went down the plagues
[52:56] never struck them
[52:57] while they were just having a glorious
[52:59] time just like
[53:00] you did when you first got saved
[53:05] everything the birds sang different
[53:07] everybody was sweet oh my
[53:09] everything was dandy when you first got
[53:12] saved he's talking about when your life
[53:16] you you you've repented and you you come
[53:18] to that place to say
[53:20] lord forgive me of my sins and you take
[53:23] him
[53:24] as your savior you know sometimes we get
[53:26] so far out that we forget the simplicity
[53:29] that we still have access to that that
[53:33] the
[53:33] unloading and and the removing of
[53:36] hindrances in our life still
[53:38] operates with that simple same principle
[53:42] and that is to confess which is to
[53:44] repent
[53:45] and say lord forgive me
[53:50] and it's a release of a burden but here
[53:53] notice as he says the birds sing
[53:55] different everybody was sweet
[53:57] oh everything was just dandy when you
[53:59] first got saved
[54:00] then come the trying time
[54:04] the chastening sanctifying time
[54:06] sanctifying yourself
[54:08] from the things of the world laying
[54:10] aside the weights
[54:12] that does so easily beset you you a man
[54:15] you had to stop your smoking stop your
[54:18] drinking
[54:18] stop you're going to the pool room your
[54:20] all night card parties
[54:22] all those things you had to sanctify
[54:24] yourself from them
[54:26] by the faith in the blood of jesus
[54:29] christ
[54:29] sanctifying yourself now i want you to
[54:31] catch this very simple
[54:33] but how is that sanctifying how is it
[54:35] sanctified
[54:36] it's faith in the blood of jesus christ
[54:40] it's faith in that not faith in yourself
[54:43] you're not looking
[54:44] at yourself of what you can do or can i
[54:47] read this
[54:47] or can i quit this and you know ten days
[54:50] without cigarettes and
[54:51] five days without looking at that on the
[54:52] internet this is not this
[54:54] is not self-reformation people with
[54:57] strong constitutions
[54:59] brotherhood tells the cis and the
[55:00] message perfection sometimes there's
[55:02] people
[55:03] with strong morale constitutions
[55:06] they can quit doing those things but
[55:08] that is not
[55:09] what we're talking about we're talking
[55:12] about the sanctifying
[55:14] power in the blood to look to the lord
[55:17] and say
[55:18] i've got this in my life lord but i'm
[55:20] asking you lord
[55:22] to cleanse that lord and i know that in
[55:25] that one all-sufficient offering there
[55:28] lays authority and power and cleansing
[55:31] to set me free
[55:34] it's applying the blood
[55:38] are you with me you women he says you
[55:41] had to let your hair grow out
[55:42] lengthen your dresses and act like
[55:45] different than you was
[55:46] it's sanctifying time many times they'd
[55:49] rebel and go back
[55:50] well that's not a child of god a child
[55:53] of god looks straight to calvary
[55:55] and knows that it's for his good what
[55:58] jesus endured for what the joy that was
[56:01] sent before him amen
[56:04] and brethren goes on he says now then
[56:06] that process of time
[56:08] there's where the great falling away
[56:09] come in israel when the great crowding
[56:12] in time
[56:12] people begin to fall away from one side
[56:15] to the other
[56:16] then in their chatting when we wish we
[56:18] were back down in egypt
[56:20] ourselves loathe this light bread in
[56:23] other words
[56:24] if i could take it historically now
[56:26] that's what they said
[56:27] now in the modern day it would be oh
[56:30] every wednesday night prayer meeting
[56:32] every sunday morning
[56:34] back to church what do we hear the same
[56:36] thing
[56:37] the preacher stands up and preached and
[56:39] songs and gone back
[56:41] see then you're just going as a line of
[56:43] duty
[56:44] you're not a worshiper a worshiper goes
[56:48] there
[56:48] to worship to express his self
[56:51] before his god to praise god for his
[56:54] goodness
[56:55] to every word he hangs on to it
[56:58] let me just preach and speak to speak a
[57:02] few moments here
[57:03] sometimes i'll say it like this you know
[57:06] it's just like maybe
[57:07] i heard brother brian tonight i thought
[57:09] it was i thought it was wisdom
[57:10] of what was spoken as i was sitting back
[57:12] there that sometimes there's things you
[57:14] can pick that up
[57:15] then maybe there's things that people
[57:17] are kind of heavy
[57:18] in a congregation but i thought it was
[57:20] wisdom to say
[57:22] hey let's look to calvary because you
[57:24] know what
[57:25] every one of us come in heavy times
[57:29] every one of us come in times that we're
[57:31] down but you know there's a place that
[57:33] we can look to
[57:34] there's sometimes when you started the
[57:36] morning you maybe were not planning on
[57:38] this evening
[57:39] that you felt down or you felt this but
[57:41] let me just say to you like this
[57:43] this is where real overcoming and
[57:45] victory takes place
[57:46] it's even when you don't feel like
[57:48] worshiping there's something in your
[57:50] heart
[57:50] that says he is worthy
[57:54] it's not something that the song leader
[57:56] has to do i think that was wisdom
[57:58] of what brother brother brian did he
[58:00] took and he pointed your hearts to
[58:02] calvary to show you that victory
[58:04] to encourage you
[58:06] [Music]
[58:07] i mean you know if you're not doing it
[58:09] you already know you're not doing it but
[58:11] you need encouraged in it
[58:13] once you do it it's encouraging you to
[58:15] overcome
[58:17] amen and i know that's not something
[58:21] that
[58:22] well it's not real deep but it's
[58:24] something that's very practical
[58:27] it's things that we must do it's we're
[58:29] living in a time
[58:30] where we must override our feelings
[58:36] we're living in a time where we cannot
[58:38] you can't walk by your feelings
[58:40] we've got to walk by faith
[58:45] well the atmosphere don't feel right
[58:47] we'll be part and create the right
[58:49] atmosphere
[58:52] let it be a challenge that where the
[58:55] challenge was at and hear the lord and
[58:57] man this is rough you know brother
[58:59] brian's out of key he got this one too
[59:01] high or this one or one even more and
[59:03] we've all been there and we've all done
[59:05] that
[59:05] it's just your voice ain't up here
[59:06] behind this
[59:08] perhaps some aren't the on key at any
[59:10] time but you understand what i'm talking
[59:12] about
[59:14] every one of us you have we have in
[59:16] those times but
[59:17] this right here we're not coming here as
[59:20] a line of duty
[59:23] i'm not here because i'm admonished by
[59:26] the scripture
[59:26] or admonished by brother branham i'm
[59:28] coming here because
[59:30] i love the lord amen
[59:34] [Applause]
[59:36] it's just like a love affair he says if
[59:39] you was going with the girl because you
[59:41] knew it was duty
[59:42] or you go with the boy but you know mama
[59:44] wants me to go with this guy but i just
[59:46] can't stand him
[59:47] you don't get nothing of him coming to
[59:49] see you
[59:50] or it's the same way about the girl the
[59:52] boy the boy to the girl
[59:54] you go with her she bores you mama wants
[59:56] you to go with her because
[59:57] she's the type of girl that mama likes
[1:00:00] see it bores you
[1:00:01] there's no love affair but you don't
[1:00:04] care
[1:00:05] you don't want to clean up you don't
[1:00:06] want to go see her oh boy
[1:00:08] well that's a horrible thing when he's
[1:00:11] coming to see
[1:00:12] you you just wish he'd hurry on and go
[1:00:14] home
[1:00:15] he said that's the way it is why does he
[1:00:18] preach so long
[1:00:19] what about all this stuff and everything
[1:00:22] see you're not
[1:00:23] in love brother sister this is the real
[1:00:26] culprit
[1:00:27] this is the reason of falling away this
[1:00:31] is the reason where lives are up and
[1:00:33] down and in and out they're not in love
[1:00:36] with jesus christ
[1:00:39] if you ever fall in love with him that's
[1:00:42] it amen
[1:00:49] if you're just in love with an emotion
[1:00:51] there'll be times you don't feel
[1:00:53] emotional
[1:00:54] there'll be services that maybe aren't
[1:00:56] swinging from the chandeliers
[1:00:58] i like all of that but there's going to
[1:01:00] be times when that word is coming
[1:01:02] and god is breaking some things and then
[1:01:05] it's a real test not of
[1:01:07] wow you know i wonder what the service
[1:01:09] was like today i wonder why it wasn't
[1:01:10] like this
[1:01:11] god's not interested in in in in
[1:01:15] duplicating a previous service or this
[1:01:17] service
[1:01:18] the whole thing in every service he
[1:01:20] wants to be
[1:01:22] worshipped
[1:01:25] powerful things took place on the
[1:01:27] sabbath
[1:01:29] stretch out by hand it's simple
[1:01:32] obedience to the word
[1:01:34] amen how many times were lives
[1:01:37] then even after the word has gone forth
[1:01:39] it's the effect of the word
[1:01:41] that has been believed and obeyed and
[1:01:44] remember
[1:01:45] the angel of the lord still visits
[1:01:48] neighborhoods of believers
[1:01:53] oh my it's a difference between a love
[1:01:55] affair and a law
[1:01:57] and you know he says but when you really
[1:01:59] begin to hang on to every word
[1:02:01] the spirit gave you he said as a warning
[1:02:03] this morning hanging on to every word
[1:02:05] that might be what he was talking about
[1:02:08] holding on
[1:02:09] its eternal life every word of god
[1:02:13] it's a joy to go to church under any
[1:02:16] circumstance mask
[1:02:20] or no mask
[1:02:27] you see friends a lot of things even
[1:02:29] itself it shows up
[1:02:30] it shows up a lot of the childness the
[1:02:33] immaturity
[1:02:34] i might be spanking but it shows up
[1:02:36] these things well i don't feel this way
[1:02:38] i think this way and i don't think this
[1:02:39] way that's childishness
[1:02:42] it's a joy to go to the house of god
[1:02:45] under any circumstances
[1:02:52] at least that's what my holy ghost did
[1:02:54] for me
[1:02:55] i mean your druggist may have altered
[1:02:57] the prescription on you
[1:03:00] but i got the full intoxicating portion
[1:03:03] [Applause]
[1:03:05] whether it's hot usually is here
[1:03:08] cold indifferent whether the people are
[1:03:12] fussing
[1:03:13] oh lord growling
[1:03:17] not here lord whatever they're doing
[1:03:21] it's still a joy to hear the word of the
[1:03:24] lord
[1:03:25] it just depends on what your focus is
[1:03:29] you're in love then with the pastor no
[1:03:33] don't say that then you're in love with
[1:03:35] brother brown don't say that
[1:03:37] then you're in love with the bible don't
[1:03:38] say that it says then you're in love
[1:03:41] with christ you love to go to church
[1:03:45] [Applause]
[1:03:47] the king being in love with christ
[1:03:51] well honey you know here sunday morning
[1:03:52] again i i guess we have to wash up the
[1:03:55] youngins and get down there
[1:03:56] my it's boresome see you're not in love
[1:03:59] but if you're really in love
[1:04:01] you can't wait till sunday morning comes
[1:04:03] you've just got to get down there with
[1:04:05] them
[1:04:05] and the people of god they don't bore
[1:04:08] you they're
[1:04:09] brothers and sisters
[1:04:16] well brother samuel i don't see no
[1:04:18] movement
[1:04:20] i don't see this well you know what
[1:04:22] there is a cure for that criticalness
[1:04:26] it's called the holy ghost and if you've
[1:04:29] got a little dry in a little part
[1:04:30] where your leaves have turned into
[1:04:32] stickers there is a
[1:04:34] fountain that is open in the house of
[1:04:36] david
[1:04:38] come on friends criticalness does not
[1:04:41] produce
[1:04:42] growth it does not invite the holy ghost
[1:04:45] in the service to work with the lives of
[1:04:48] people
[1:04:48] criticalness is not an attribute of
[1:04:51] being yoked with the holy ghost
[1:04:54] man where'd this come from
[1:05:03] somebody must stuck something on my
[1:05:05] notes here
[1:05:08] but notice how with israel remember
[1:05:12] israel god was feeding them manna from
[1:05:15] hannah
[1:05:16] hannah and hope from heaven
[1:05:19] and it became burdensome to him
[1:05:24] this bread it become brother brown goes
[1:05:27] on to say
[1:05:27] it became burdensome this old light
[1:05:30] bread
[1:05:31] well what do we care about this old
[1:05:32] light bread our souls load this stuff
[1:05:34] everything's wrong this old manner that
[1:05:36] falls every night we'd rather have some
[1:05:38] garlic and leek
[1:05:39] out of egypt let me just tell you
[1:05:41] something i can say this and i believe i
[1:05:44] can speak to hearts
[1:05:45] that have also crossed over i can speak
[1:05:47] to life that's on the way
[1:05:49] even when i was in journey into the
[1:05:52] promise
[1:05:52] i didn't want to go back to garlic and
[1:05:54] leaks i didn't want to go back to the
[1:05:56] things of the world
[1:05:58] i have been relieved of those burdens
[1:06:01] i didn't want to go back there no more
[1:06:04] so what do we do
[1:06:05] go on amen take the manner that's
[1:06:08] falling to death
[1:06:09] go out and get it you receive strength
[1:06:12] and go on what is the manner it's a type
[1:06:15] of the bread of life it's a time of the
[1:06:17] holy ghost
[1:06:18] calling with the holy ghost as he's
[1:06:20] falling in the service
[1:06:21] go out and get it
[1:06:25] go out and get it say thank you lord
[1:06:27] jesus
[1:06:28] take it into your life there's a
[1:06:30] refilling of the holy spirit
[1:06:35] said see their hearts wasn't ready for
[1:06:36] the journey when
[1:06:38] one man or woman begins to complain
[1:06:40] about going to church
[1:06:42] and they get so tired of going to church
[1:06:44] they're not ready for the journey
[1:06:46] there's something wrong somewhere
[1:06:49] he says you're getting ready for the
[1:06:50] journey and i want you to watch how he
[1:06:52] brings us down here
[1:06:54] he says you're getting ready for the
[1:06:55] journey you're ready to go in the
[1:06:56] promised land the testing time
[1:06:59] and but there is the danger ground
[1:07:02] the wilderness the testing times
[1:07:05] israel in their testing time they got
[1:07:08] the quarreling
[1:07:09] and fussing and loathing over the bread
[1:07:12] they wanted to go back to egypt they
[1:07:14] started complaining
[1:07:15] brother brown goes into that they're
[1:07:17] complaining about moses and you know
[1:07:19] is he leading us right and so forth and
[1:07:21] he goes on to say
[1:07:22] that but if you at the very end of that
[1:07:25] but if you're really determined to stay
[1:07:27] on the road
[1:07:28] stay right with this leader of the holy
[1:07:30] spirit stay
[1:07:31] right with the word if you stay with the
[1:07:33] spirit it'll keep you
[1:07:35] in the word it'll take you right down
[1:07:37] along the line the path of the word
[1:07:39] don't be afraid of it it won't hurt
[1:07:41] nothing it'll just help you
[1:07:43] if you are hurt it heals all the hurts
[1:07:45] the holy spirit will
[1:07:48] you can't have two different yokes at
[1:07:51] the same time
[1:07:54] you can't be yoked to god and yoke to
[1:07:56] the world
[1:07:57] matter of fact god you can't god will
[1:08:00] not
[1:08:00] even place the yoke upon you when you're
[1:08:03] still yoked with the world
[1:08:05] but it is god's desire to bring us it's
[1:08:08] a
[1:08:08] sovereign work of the holy spirit you
[1:08:11] see that never
[1:08:12] leaves our lives it's god sovereignly
[1:08:15] working in our life just as he would say
[1:08:18] uh you know when he would speak there
[1:08:21] through paul
[1:08:21] to the corinthian church and he would
[1:08:23] say be
[1:08:24] you not unequally yoked with unbelievers
[1:08:29] in all through that scripture what
[1:08:31] fellowship has the temple of god
[1:08:34] with that of of the children of belong
[1:08:36] the very the simple part is is that
[1:08:39] when god is working in your life and i
[1:08:42] don't even care
[1:08:42] if you're a person you know maybe you
[1:08:44] say well i've crossed on over
[1:08:46] into the promised land but remember when
[1:08:49] it is in an
[1:08:50] atmosphere where your faith is stirred
[1:08:53] to take a promise
[1:08:54] and believe it but remember words create
[1:08:57] atmospheres there's things out there
[1:09:00] that you can become wrapped up in
[1:09:02] that creates an atmosphere within
[1:09:06] you that instead of that seed word
[1:09:09] coming to past in your life it takes
[1:09:11] away
[1:09:12] it diminishes what god has called you to
[1:09:16] remember that's why
[1:09:20] i don't think anybody here i i you know
[1:09:23] i can always remember i mean
[1:09:24] it's even now not just when i was
[1:09:26] working there's times here i come out of
[1:09:27] the office
[1:09:28] and you know it might be a time where
[1:09:31] the inspiration of god has just come
[1:09:33] down and it's one of those
[1:09:34] times where it's just the floods are
[1:09:36] open and they're just trying to capture
[1:09:37] i don't want to go nowhere even after
[1:09:41] capturing it
[1:09:42] hours later walking out i don't want to
[1:09:44] go nowhere i just don't want to go i
[1:09:45] don't want to go
[1:09:47] and see all those sights and see all
[1:09:49] those things and be around and those
[1:09:51] other
[1:09:51] i just don't want to do it sometimes we
[1:09:53] have to do that there's things where
[1:09:55] you get up tomorrow morning and here you
[1:09:57] know after a service
[1:09:58] you don't you don't necessarily want to
[1:10:00] maybe go into a certain environment
[1:10:02] you don't know what that environment is
[1:10:03] going to be why because
[1:10:06] you sense that and when you go into it
[1:10:08] it's not something you're willfully
[1:10:10] doing
[1:10:10] but you recognize say god let the word
[1:10:13] that i have received lord i don't want
[1:10:15] it taken out of my life
[1:10:17] you see it's not the same as if you
[1:10:20] leave out of here
[1:10:21] and you go right back with worldly
[1:10:23] friends
[1:10:24] or you go over to you know the aunt and
[1:10:26] uncle's house that every other word it's
[1:10:28] a swear word
[1:10:31] and you know one thing starts from
[1:10:32] running down the boss then they start
[1:10:34] running down
[1:10:35] their uncle then they start running down
[1:10:37] the hat then when you leave they run you
[1:10:38] down
[1:10:39] and then you know that spirit gets on
[1:10:41] you and you want to start running
[1:10:42] everybody else down
[1:10:44] very simple but you see the simplicity
[1:10:47] we're wanting god to do
[1:10:48] things but yet god asks of us
[1:10:53] how serious are you
[1:10:56] and he says come out from among them
[1:11:01] oh god take me out from among them god
[1:11:04] said you come out from among them
[1:11:06] what is it it's faith in his word
[1:11:14] and this is his promise he says and
[1:11:17] touch
[1:11:17] not the unclean faith you know what's
[1:11:20] unclean
[1:11:20] you know what you need to separate from
[1:11:23] how do i do that
[1:11:24] by faith in the blood of jesus christ
[1:11:29] and the promise is i will be a father
[1:11:31] unto you
[1:11:32] you will be my son you'll be my daughter
[1:11:35] i will walk in you
[1:11:37] that's his promise yes jesus also spoke
[1:11:41] of this yoke when he said
[1:11:44] that any man that will follow me
[1:11:48] let him deny himself take up
[1:11:51] his cross and follow me
[1:11:56] now when we think of a yoke
[1:12:02] you know a yoke probably most of you
[1:12:06] have an image in your mind you've
[1:12:08] probably seen it whether it's
[1:12:10] children's books or whatever more
[1:12:12] sometimes it's
[1:12:13] wooden and you know like i said for us
[1:12:16] we don't
[1:12:17] see a lot of this when we go out you
[1:12:19] know
[1:12:20] you know within the uh communities and
[1:12:22] things like that that were around even
[1:12:24] among the amish when we would go down
[1:12:26] there i don't see
[1:12:27] uh much oxen around at all i see like
[1:12:29] the big draft horses
[1:12:31] that they'll have out there pooling the
[1:12:33] plow and things like that
[1:12:34] and they're harnessed up but a yoke
[1:12:37] itself when a yoke would be
[1:12:39] placed upon this uh this
[1:12:42] oxen in order for that yolk because of
[1:12:46] being wood and
[1:12:47] and so forth the the it is so built to
[1:12:50] where when the oxen will begin to go
[1:12:52] forward that the that it will actually
[1:12:56] move right into position but between
[1:12:59] that of the ox and that of the yoke
[1:13:03] there is a lining that goes in there
[1:13:07] and that lining is what is known as
[1:13:10] swaddling cloth
[1:13:12] it's that which actually it works to
[1:13:14] protect
[1:13:16] the oxen and to uh
[1:13:19] make it so that the yoke itself
[1:13:22] that it is uh you know harnessed
[1:13:25] by that the yoke itself it doesn't
[1:13:29] chafe it or you know bring a disturbance
[1:13:33] upon its neck or you know and and hinder
[1:13:36] it
[1:13:36] from accomplishing what it needs to
[1:13:38] accomplish
[1:13:40] let me just say it like this the burden
[1:13:44] you bear is to do the burden
[1:13:47] you of he god is building you to bear
[1:13:51] his burden and that's the changing of
[1:13:53] your nature
[1:13:58] it's actually it's actually it's not
[1:14:01] listen to me now it's very simple it's
[1:14:04] not just
[1:14:05] lord we forgive me of this you confess
[1:14:08] all your sin
[1:14:09] but it's not just removing sin
[1:14:12] he's relieving the burden of the nature
[1:14:17] that is in opposition that's
[1:14:20] where forgiveness comes to a greater
[1:14:24] depth are you with me
[1:14:27] because a person can be forgiven but yet
[1:14:30] what was in them that made them do those
[1:14:34] things
[1:14:34] is still there but god's desire
[1:14:38] is to remove what made
[1:14:42] those attributes or those things
[1:14:45] god wants to remove that
[1:14:51] no person can do that
[1:14:55] i'm gonna try this in my life it's faith
[1:14:57] you see
[1:14:58] who's the one who's lifted up he's the
[1:15:00] one who's lifted up
[1:15:02] it's not what i stopped i hope you
[1:15:04] understand what i'm saying
[1:15:05] when i say it's not what i stop what you
[1:15:07] stop it doesn't mean that we sent around
[1:15:09] and you know here it was we were just
[1:15:11] like this and said
[1:15:12] well you know lord you just go ahead and
[1:15:13] take it lord i'm just waiting i'm just
[1:15:15] yielded that's not yielded
[1:15:17] no amen he said come unto me
[1:15:20] he said take my yoke upon you
[1:15:24] he's offering it we have to take it
[1:15:28] amen but you see what
[1:15:32] faith does faith is eyesight faith is
[1:15:35] vision
[1:15:36] faith sees victory faith says you know
[1:15:38] what he rose
[1:15:39] he triumphed over principalities over
[1:15:42] every power
[1:15:43] the grave couldn't hold him think about
[1:15:45] it the greatest paradox
[1:15:47] took place on that easter morning and he
[1:15:50] demonstrated to you and i this is the
[1:15:53] power
[1:15:54] of my resurrection it's the power
[1:15:57] that i paid the price so i could come
[1:16:00] and release
[1:16:01] that back into your life
[1:16:07] hallelujah god
[1:16:10] is not coming and he hasn't come to
[1:16:13] repair
[1:16:14] our fallen character he comes to do away
[1:16:18] with that
[1:16:22] so somebody can look at you and say oh
[1:16:24] yeah oh you're so-and-so but that's how
[1:16:26] i remember when you did this in high
[1:16:28] school
[1:16:28] oh yeah i remember when you did this but
[1:16:30] what they fail to recognize is
[1:16:32] that which was on the inside that nature
[1:16:35] that life that was there that is
[1:16:38] no longer there
[1:16:44] god didn't come in and beat it out of us
[1:16:46] or you know
[1:16:48] pull on us or yank us remember it's
[1:16:51] sovereign love working in our life
[1:16:54] by his divine power then our will might
[1:16:57] be surrendered to him
[1:17:06] the bible says and i want to just
[1:17:09] just move in these last few points here
[1:17:13] from this
[1:17:16] i tell you brother and sister
[1:17:21] we in this age and in this time
[1:17:24] we were in a mess
[1:17:29] i just say it like this i i recognize
[1:17:32] more and more every day as
[1:17:35] i just thank god god and you see
[1:17:38] the reality the purpose of the message
[1:17:42] we were in a mess we were in confusion
[1:17:46] you know what babylon is
[1:17:47] confusion you know what confusion is you
[1:17:51] don't know where you're standing
[1:18:00] you can i can talk to some that would be
[1:18:03] of distant of a kin
[1:18:06] and the confusion that they would have
[1:18:08] is they look
[1:18:09] and they see lives that have left the
[1:18:12] church i'm talking about in their
[1:18:13] organizations they left the church
[1:18:15] and and they're looking at their lives
[1:18:16] and saying but
[1:18:18] but so-and-so spoke in tongues i know
[1:18:21] they had the holy ghost
[1:18:22] and they spoke in tongues so and so
[1:18:24] prophesy let me just tell you something
[1:18:26] my heart i rejoice for the truth that
[1:18:29] god's brought because
[1:18:30] it has brought such clarity
[1:18:34] you recognize brother and sister the
[1:18:36] holy ghost
[1:18:37] is the spirit of truth
[1:18:41] he bears record of the truth
[1:18:44] he said i am the truth the life and the
[1:18:46] way.
[1:18:48] truth is not an idea truth is
[1:18:51] a person and the confusion is is well i
[1:18:56] sing
[1:18:56] i seem to speak in tongues or i sing
[1:18:58] this or i've seen so and so preaching i
[1:19:01] don't understand
[1:19:01] what happened to their life or what
[1:19:03] became of their life you see god
[1:19:05] had to bring clarity in this hour
[1:19:09] that our faith would be based and
[1:19:12] built upon the world for rapture amen
[1:19:15] [Applause]
[1:19:17] god committed listen to me god
[1:19:20] committed himself when he makes a
[1:19:22] promise in his word
[1:19:24] he said behold i will send elijah unto
[1:19:27] you
[1:19:29] god made a promise in his word in
[1:19:31] revelations 10
[1:19:32] 7 that he himself would descend
[1:19:37] he would take the sails off the book
[1:19:40] where man had sealed up the presence of
[1:19:43] god
[1:19:44] and the real baptism of the holy ghost
[1:19:46] god said i will come
[1:19:49] when god gives his word he is wrapped
[1:19:52] and
[1:19:52] tied and obligated to that word
[1:19:56] [Applause]
[1:19:58] hallelujah we didn't open our eyes
[1:20:02] god has opened our eyes
[1:20:07] and the opening of our eyes it stings at
[1:20:10] first
[1:20:12] it's got to bring conviction are you
[1:20:14] with me
[1:20:15] you don't get nowhere without confession
[1:20:20] confession is true repentance
[1:20:24] the word says this is wrong you say
[1:20:27] that's wrong lord i want to be lying
[1:20:29] with your word
[1:20:30] that's true repentance
[1:20:35] lord i'm weak in this hair in my life
[1:20:37] come on let's balance it in the word
[1:20:39] let the weak say i am strong
[1:20:46] let him who feels down say i can do all
[1:20:49] things
[1:20:50] through christ who strengtheneth me amen
[1:20:53] are you with me tonight these are
[1:20:56] promises
[1:20:56] you have access to even before being
[1:21:00] filled with the holy ghost
[1:21:01] you've got to have a promise and a word
[1:21:04] to stand on
[1:21:05] to approach the holy ghost the holy
[1:21:08] ghost is a person
[1:21:10] it takes the word to build faith in the
[1:21:14] person of the word himself
[1:21:21] let me just try to bring this together
[1:21:22] here
[1:21:24] this god brings this to you and i
[1:21:29] and the prophet would take multiple
[1:21:32] services
[1:21:34] and preach from ezekiel 36 impersonation
[1:21:37] of christianity
[1:21:38] if you ever listen that message it'd be
[1:21:40] good
[1:21:41] why is it some christians find it so
[1:21:43] hard to live a christian life
[1:21:45] this is the titles of the message but
[1:21:47] he's bringing this from this scripture
[1:21:50] you see listen to me now god does not go
[1:21:53] up and send a message
[1:21:54] to condemn amen
[1:21:58] that's not why the preaching of the word
[1:21:59] it doesn't come to condemn
[1:22:01] if you took even the first part of the
[1:22:03] message and said oh my
[1:22:05] he's preaching on me remember no no
[1:22:07] don't take it that way
[1:22:08] recognize and say god that's what i want
[1:22:11] to be
[1:22:12] i want to be lined up like that
[1:22:15] god sent not his son into the world to
[1:22:18] condemn
[1:22:19] the world condemnation
[1:22:22] comes when those reject it
[1:22:26] but for those who receive it liberty
[1:22:28] comes
[1:22:31] notice here ezekiel 36
[1:22:34] this is the whole journey of the birth
[1:22:36] it's god working in your life
[1:22:38] to justify you justify you are
[1:22:42] free you are clear in believing
[1:22:45] amen he rose for your justification
[1:22:50] notice in verse 26 if i don't read it we
[1:22:53] won't get to it
[1:22:55] a new heart also will i give you
[1:22:59] this is a work of the holy ghost
[1:23:03] this is why paul says we are his
[1:23:06] workmanship
[1:23:08] you're not here the the the uh edition
[1:23:11] of a church it's his working right
[1:23:14] he said i'll give you a new heart i'll
[1:23:17] give you a new spirit
[1:23:19] a a new spirit will i put within you now
[1:23:22] you might say well ezekiel's a prophet
[1:23:24] he's preaching to israel when they're an
[1:23:26] exile remember a prophet is an eagle
[1:23:29] as we took a little pause here on a
[1:23:31] couple weeks here
[1:23:32] in the midst of that series we're
[1:23:33] looking at remember a prophet
[1:23:35] is one who is picked up ezekiel was not
[1:23:38] seeing the day he was living in
[1:23:41] ezekiel was seeing our day
[1:23:47] when hearts would be hardened amen
[1:23:54] you'll see as we read through this and i
[1:23:56] will take away so he says i'll give you
[1:23:59] a a new heart also will i give you and a
[1:24:01] new spirit will i
[1:24:02] put within you
[1:24:06] why do i need a new spirit because you
[1:24:07] couldn't even get along with yourself
[1:24:10] see what it is remember he's not wanting
[1:24:12] to work a contrary to you
[1:24:14] he's wanting you remember it's our will
[1:24:19] surrendering to his will so he said
[1:24:22] i'll give you a new spirit i'll give you
[1:24:25] a new heart a new heart is a new way of
[1:24:27] thinking
[1:24:28] amen before the word just passed you
[1:24:31] right by
[1:24:32] a new way of thinking is things that now
[1:24:35] you look at and say
[1:24:36] why did i see it before why didn't i say
[1:24:38] this or when it is what is it new heart
[1:24:42] who gave you that new heart god did it
[1:24:46] what's he doing he's preparing to yoke
[1:24:49] you up it's all a preparation amen
[1:24:59] just like those amish guys that are down
[1:25:01] there and um
[1:25:03] is it mount hope i think it's mount hope
[1:25:07] on fridays when they do the
[1:25:09] they bring those race horses in there
[1:25:10] you know and oh bessie went from
[1:25:13] eating oats and running the track to
[1:25:15] she's going to be pulling some things
[1:25:19] and they're watching these horses
[1:25:21] they're studying them
[1:25:23] right they don't just take the horse and
[1:25:25] all of a sudden put it on a buggy
[1:25:27] they'll tie it behind the buggy and take
[1:25:29] it back to their house
[1:25:31] they want to see how it's going to
[1:25:32] respond
[1:25:34] but there's a reason they bought it they
[1:25:37] believe there's qualities in it
[1:25:39] those qualities might not all the way be
[1:25:41] coming out but you take one who knows
[1:25:43] that horse you or i could say my that's
[1:25:45] a pretty one
[1:25:46] wow that's a nice one whoa that's real
[1:25:47] shiny and that guy says who in the world
[1:25:49] is this
[1:25:50] that's not how you choose a horse you
[1:25:53] don't choose a church
[1:25:54] based on how beautiful it is
[1:25:57] does everybody in the church have are
[1:25:59] they all astounding everybody got their
[1:26:00] teeth and everything
[1:26:01] that's not how you choose a church you
[1:26:04] choose a church back
[1:26:05] is the holy ghost present leading us
[1:26:08] in the way of this hour
[1:26:10] [Applause]
[1:26:15] god said i'll take away the stony heart
[1:26:19] out of your flesh think about it you
[1:26:21] ever try to sow seed on stone
[1:26:25] you can't do it remember when we had
[1:26:28] we built our other other house and we
[1:26:30] had to go through and take all the
[1:26:31] stones
[1:26:32] out of the yard right guess your job
[1:26:35] that was
[1:26:39] and then one you know there was great
[1:26:41] big ones i would have loved if there was
[1:26:42] great big ones
[1:26:43] i thought my you know we're going to get
[1:26:45] the rock hound over here with you know
[1:26:46] the bobcat and get it out
[1:26:48] and the one guy came over and he said
[1:26:49] those are 57s you have to rake those out
[1:26:52] rick i said are you sure
[1:26:53] i don't want to rake that whole yard
[1:26:57] but i had to rank them i tried to get
[1:27:00] every one of them out but i could
[1:27:02] you know why because when you go to sow
[1:27:05] seed
[1:27:06] seed will not grow on top of those
[1:27:09] stones
[1:27:10] it's got to find ground where it can
[1:27:13] bury
[1:27:13] and die and bring forth and that's where
[1:27:16] god himself changes your stony heart
[1:27:19] where at one point you'd say i really
[1:27:21] want to go to church or a new spirit
[1:27:23] says ah
[1:27:24] i really want to go to church but god
[1:27:26] comes in and he changes your heart
[1:27:28] he changes your way of thinking he
[1:27:30] changes your spirit
[1:27:32] where you're not contrary but he changes
[1:27:34] that what's he doing
[1:27:36] he's preparing to yoke us to him
[1:27:47] look at this verse 27.
[1:27:52] see many people stop at a new heart in a
[1:27:54] new spirit
[1:27:57] this is why the up and down
[1:28:01] the in and out all over the board
[1:28:05] friends i'm not saying that to be
[1:28:06] critical i'm not saying that in regards
[1:28:09] to people here
[1:28:11] i'm saying in regards to all throughout
[1:28:13] even this
[1:28:14] church this is what i'm responsible for
[1:28:17] right but so many times this is where
[1:28:21] we need to go on in verse 27 and i
[1:28:24] will put my spirit within you
[1:28:28] and cause you to walk in my statutes and
[1:28:31] you shall keep my judgments
[1:28:33] and do them
[1:28:36] so the lining that we must have the
[1:28:40] swaddling cloth is that of the holy
[1:28:42] ghost
[1:28:45] that's when the word itself we can
[1:28:48] really be harnessed
[1:28:50] anybody ever had
[1:28:53] experienced you know any chafing or
[1:28:57] hey you know you had chafing on your
[1:28:59] skin or other things like that
[1:29:01] maybe chapped lips or maybe you're in
[1:29:03] the cold when things come up and you
[1:29:05] you got to keep all that lip balm and
[1:29:07] everything else or your hands in the
[1:29:09] winter time
[1:29:10] you know you're washing what they think
[1:29:12] about this year what's coming on
[1:29:14] i mean between the soap and the and the
[1:29:16] antibacterial stuff or whatever more you
[1:29:18] might as well just create a bubble and
[1:29:19] walk around and live in if
[1:29:20] you do what they say right
[1:29:24] but what happens with your hands
[1:29:27] you keep washing them right it's good to
[1:29:29] have washed hands
[1:29:30] but after some period of time they start
[1:29:32] cracking
[1:29:33] right and you wonder if you're shaking
[1:29:37] is that flesh i'm shaking brother or is
[1:29:39] that a leather glove
[1:29:42] and that's chafing it hurts after a
[1:29:44] while
[1:29:45] right shaping sometimes it can hurt
[1:29:47] maybe there's been sometimes maybe you
[1:29:49] had a shoe
[1:29:50] and you know you wanted to be in style
[1:29:51] don't wear no socks and you get that
[1:29:53] little blister on your heel
[1:29:57] it's okay you that doesn't regard
[1:29:59] whether you're spiritual or not
[1:30:00] but it's just what god will give me to
[1:30:02] get a point to you
[1:30:04] and when after that you're like oh i
[1:30:06] just sit down while you all go shop
[1:30:08] i'll sit down while you do this see it's
[1:30:11] chafing
[1:30:13] what does chafing do it eventually hurts
[1:30:16] it stops you from doing what you plan to
[1:30:19] do
[1:30:21] a new heart and a new spirit is a
[1:30:23] wonderful thing
[1:30:25] but then when the testing time comes and
[1:30:28] somebody
[1:30:28] expressed you and say hey i heard that
[1:30:31] you're making a start for god or i heard
[1:30:34] you were doing this sir i heard that you
[1:30:36] were going to this church
[1:30:37] i heard this right here what did you say
[1:30:41] well i went up there you know because
[1:30:43] you know my husband my mom and them
[1:30:45] invited me and
[1:30:46] and this and that you say a new heart a
[1:30:48] new spirit yeah
[1:30:50] what happens is it's not been fully
[1:30:54] yoked and the thought
[1:30:57] of having to answer somebody else
[1:31:00] i'm just don't you understand this they
[1:31:02] may not benefit the rest of you
[1:31:04] but this is from a few weeks ago it's
[1:31:05] been laying here
[1:31:12] a chafing where it
[1:31:15] hurts after a period of time
[1:31:19] this is this this is let me just say it
[1:31:21] like this
[1:31:22] bringing these points together this is
[1:31:25] why we need the holy spirit
[1:31:28] god himself to bring the lining
[1:31:31] to the yoke we need the new heart
[1:31:34] we need the new spirit but we
[1:31:38] in all of that is preparation for the
[1:31:40] fullness of the lining of the holy
[1:31:42] spirit let me just say what the lining
[1:31:44] isn't the lining isn't i'm just going to
[1:31:47] take a summation of quotes here
[1:31:49] the lining isn't the new heart in the
[1:31:51] new spirit
[1:31:52] that'll only last so long new way of
[1:31:55] thinking about the word
[1:31:57] a new feeling wow just just feels so
[1:32:00] good
[1:32:01] why did god do that so that you could
[1:32:04] walk
[1:32:05] up and receive what he has for you
[1:32:09] that's the holy ghost because you can't
[1:32:13] go to him if you know you got
[1:32:16] condemnation on your life
[1:32:21] the lining isn't emotional
[1:32:26] that's not what lines it but i'm saying
[1:32:28] many times people come and they get
[1:32:30] emotional
[1:32:31] and then after a period of time they
[1:32:32] start chafing
[1:32:35] it starts going away when pressures come
[1:32:38] hey why are you letting your hair grow
[1:32:40] out now well um
[1:32:42] you know um dr um you know dr youtube
[1:32:46] said that it's the minerals and the
[1:32:48] nutrients and it is this and is it that
[1:32:50] i'll tell you what just say it like this
[1:32:54] god's dealing with my heart right
[1:32:58] what's happening there faith muscles are
[1:33:01] growing yes
[1:33:09] neither is it just the line the lining
[1:33:11] is in experiences
[1:33:16] you understand well i'm getting we're
[1:33:19] playing music up here
[1:33:22] but it's not just experiences i want you
[1:33:25] to listen to me now
[1:33:28] you could take the onrious person or
[1:33:30] maybe not an ordinary person
[1:33:32] and they come and set in a service and
[1:33:35] the holy ghost starts falling
[1:33:38] maybe as the songs are being played may
[1:33:41] they just come under and say
[1:33:42] praise god thank you lord and this and
[1:33:45] that and
[1:33:46] and going on and my goodness and the
[1:33:48] holy spirit falls on
[1:33:50] them but you see if they
[1:33:54] don't surrender it's only been an
[1:33:57] experience
[1:33:59] without a change and that can bring
[1:34:02] confusion to a life because they can
[1:34:04] think
[1:34:04] i had this experience i had this great
[1:34:07] feeling
[1:34:08] i had this great emotion or a person
[1:34:10] could say maya
[1:34:11] shouted i don't understand it but you
[1:34:13] see when the word comes
[1:34:15] it it does away with confusion and gives
[1:34:18] clear direction so you recognize
[1:34:21] it's wonderful to shout we believe in
[1:34:23] something we believe in entering in
[1:34:26] but remember it's about a surrendered
[1:34:28] will amen
[1:34:32] it's surrendering of our will
[1:34:38] it's not our works either but that
[1:34:40] doesn't mean like you see me sitting up
[1:34:42] here a while ago that my hands are just
[1:34:44] crossed inside
[1:34:45] take it from me lord amen dear lord
[1:34:49] right he's not going to come and wrestle
[1:34:51] it away
[1:34:58] the wrestling between jacob and the
[1:34:59] angel lasted as long as jacob's will
[1:35:04] when jacob finally released his will
[1:35:07] then god touched him there
[1:35:12] there his will
[1:35:15] his strength finally diminished
[1:35:19] so the lining isn't the new heart and
[1:35:22] the new spirit
[1:35:23] it's not emotion it's not experiences
[1:35:25] it's not your works
[1:35:28] we believe in all that right are you
[1:35:30] with me we believe in all that you
[1:35:32] understand
[1:35:34] but the lining is this is what the
[1:35:36] lining is
[1:35:38] it's feathers of love is the words of
[1:35:41] the prophet
[1:35:42] it's the love of god in our heart
[1:35:46] it's not us doing it out of a fear
[1:35:50] amen it's the love of god it's not us
[1:35:54] trying to say well i know i need to stop
[1:35:55] cutting my hair i know i need to
[1:35:57] you know i need i need to stop wearing
[1:35:59] my shorts or i need something
[1:36:01] all of that is part of the new heart and
[1:36:03] the new spirit
[1:36:04] and you're looking to god but remember
[1:36:06] don't just rest in yourself you rest
[1:36:09] in him and say lord i take what you've
[1:36:12] said in your word
[1:36:14] i accept this and i walk forward lord
[1:36:17] with this
[1:36:21] so the lining is the love of god it is
[1:36:24] joy it's peace and it's sweetness in the
[1:36:27] holy ghost
[1:36:34] it is the power of god in you
[1:36:38] performing amen
[1:36:43] it's where we cease that's what the rest
[1:36:45] of god is it's where we cease
[1:36:48] and god steps in
[1:36:52] and it also is to be filled
[1:36:55] with hallelujahs the yoke
[1:36:59] brother brown would say like this let me
[1:37:00] just move through this here
[1:37:05] what used to chafe what used to chafe
[1:37:10] no longer chafes
[1:37:13] people can say whatever they want to say
[1:37:15] about you
[1:37:22] remember the bible says when you became
[1:37:26] companions as paul would said
[1:37:29] with those who are so used those as you
[1:37:31] begin walking in the way you endured a
[1:37:33] great flight
[1:37:34] a great flight of afflictions
[1:37:37] reproach comes your way what is that
[1:37:41] testing time now listen to me
[1:37:45] you see i don't believe i'm speaking to
[1:37:47] people tonight i'm just going to take
[1:37:48] this and i believe this
[1:37:50] i'm not speaking to people tonight and
[1:37:52] if anything the holy spirit would warn
[1:37:54] if anybody has been here for years and
[1:37:56] you're living in that condition
[1:37:57] don't keep going that way
[1:38:02] because just having a cleaned up life
[1:38:04] doesn't mean you're full of the holy
[1:38:05] ghost
[1:38:06] the holy ghost is the love of god in
[1:38:08] your life
[1:38:10] and if you've got to tell somebody
[1:38:12] you're a christian if you've got to
[1:38:14] announce it
[1:38:15] then you don't have the speaker on the
[1:38:17] inside
[1:38:18] it ought to be the love of god in your
[1:38:20] life that there's no question
[1:38:23] who's first in your life
[1:38:26] if there's going to be a question you
[1:38:28] might say well samuel you mean at times
[1:38:30] we don't get down or
[1:38:31] times we do this sometimes i think we're
[1:38:33] calling things
[1:38:34] in the wrong way we're looking at things
[1:38:36] saying well i just get down or i just do
[1:38:38] this a little bit or i just do this a
[1:38:40] little bit
[1:38:40] friends we've got to be honest with
[1:38:42] ourselves we're at the door
[1:38:44] between time and eternity we cannot keep
[1:38:46] playing around we can't keep looking at
[1:38:48] it
[1:38:49] and making excuses for a lackluster life
[1:38:51] we've got to say god
[1:38:53] fill me with the holy ghost
[1:38:56] let the love of god come into my life
[1:39:00] amen where it's a love affair it's not
[1:39:03] something you're doing
[1:39:04] out of a duty or if i don't do this
[1:39:07] god's gonna get me
[1:39:08] if i don't do this you're living in a
[1:39:10] slave mentality that's a state of fear
[1:39:13] perfect love cast out fear
[1:39:17] that's what the lining of the holy ghost
[1:39:20] does
[1:39:24] it's the internal part
[1:39:28] that keeps everything on time
[1:39:31] like the great wheels you know watch
[1:39:36] he said i'll put my spirit in you it's
[1:39:38] no longer what you have to do
[1:39:42] it's the love of god at one time you did
[1:39:45] what you did
[1:39:46] because i'm supposed to do this and this
[1:39:49] is what i want to do and i want to say
[1:39:50] it like this
[1:39:52] it's wonderful to have the new heart and
[1:39:53] new spirit and to have that where you're
[1:39:55] saying lord i want to line up with your
[1:39:57] word what do i keep doing
[1:39:58] take the admonition of the holy spirit
[1:40:00] he's admonish you
[1:40:01] keep walking keep yielding and keep
[1:40:04] applying that word
[1:40:05] with the objective lord i want my life
[1:40:08] to be
[1:40:08] filled with you i want to be yoked with
[1:40:12] the word i don't want to just carry it
[1:40:14] under my arm but i want to be united
[1:40:17] with you lord where it's the love of god
[1:40:20] on the inside you're not
[1:40:21] doing it because it's a law but his own
[1:40:24] nature
[1:40:25] has wrote his word in your life it's not
[1:40:28] you struggling it's not you doing it
[1:40:30] you're trying to bring it to pass but
[1:40:32] it's good inside of you
[1:40:37] let me just tell you he's with you
[1:40:40] hallelujah
[1:40:41] you take the word and you apply it in
[1:40:43] your life
[1:40:46] and when something comes by your way oh
[1:40:48] oh
[1:40:50] you're looking like an old grandma or
[1:40:52] you're this or you're that
[1:40:54] oh you think now let me just tell you
[1:40:55] something if you're thinking that oh
[1:40:57] brother samuel i've got the holy ghost
[1:40:59] you're just preaching to people that
[1:41:01] don't have the holy ghost
[1:41:02] you're missing a great part of this
[1:41:03] service because it still takes the same
[1:41:06] application of the word it takes us to
[1:41:09] recognize
[1:41:10] that we need our we need him every step
[1:41:13] of the way
[1:41:14] it's just like this when you take a
[1:41:16] promise of god you're
[1:41:18] born again filled with the spirit of god
[1:41:20] and you take a promise of god
[1:41:22] maybe god has spoken to you and said
[1:41:24] i've healed you
[1:41:25] and you stand upon that word and
[1:41:27] somebody else maybe a next of kin can
[1:41:29] say
[1:41:30] really why are you still coughing that
[1:41:32] way why are you still feeling that way
[1:41:34] why is this still going on but you see
[1:41:36] you're not taking their word
[1:41:38] it's not based on your emotions it's
[1:41:40] based on thus saith the lord
[1:41:56] he puts the feathers on the cross
[1:42:06] somebody can say something about you
[1:42:10] something can happen
[1:42:14] in the church
[1:42:19] people in the job or whatever
[1:42:22] but you'll pack that burden to calvary
[1:42:28] he said my yoke is easy
[1:42:33] my yoke is easy
[1:42:38] my yoke is easy and my burden is light
[1:42:44] before his spirit comes in
[1:42:49] the burden can seem very great you'll
[1:42:51] feel the pressures
[1:42:53] that can come around you
[1:42:57] but when his life has come it doesn't
[1:43:01] mean that you don't feel the burden
[1:43:03] it doesn't mean that at times that if
[1:43:06] family or others come around and they
[1:43:08] say something it doesn't mean that there
[1:43:10] won't come
[1:43:11] a heaviness or things around you
[1:43:15] but the difference is you've got a place
[1:43:17] to take it to
[1:43:21] you've got a place where you can take
[1:43:23] the burdens
[1:43:25] and that's the calvary
[1:43:29] brother brown would always use this in
[1:43:30] every one of these parts where he deals
[1:43:32] with this
[1:43:34] where i've just referenced here in the
[1:43:36] last few moments
[1:43:38] and you always tie it right back in
[1:43:41] to samson
[1:43:44] you know
[1:43:48] brother branham would zero us in because
[1:43:52] you know
[1:43:54] children's bibles and whatever more they
[1:43:57] got sampson being some
[1:43:59] like arnold schwarzenegger just some big
[1:44:03] muscular guy and just
[1:44:09] and the prophet of god would come
[1:44:15] and say regarding samson
[1:44:17] [Music]
[1:44:18] he was a curly-headed little shrimp
[1:44:22] mama's boy
[1:44:25] i don't feel bad now no i ain't shrimp
[1:44:29] i've never been a shrimp but
[1:44:33] he said brother samuel why why would
[1:44:35] that be important
[1:44:36] to put out there because
[1:44:39] it was not the natural
[1:44:42] strength
[1:44:45] [Music]
[1:44:47] as a matter of fact if you look even
[1:44:49] somebody who would have natural strength
[1:44:51] that's still a paradox to be able to
[1:44:56] smite that many philistines that's still
[1:44:59] a paradox
[1:45:01] but then you take a curly-headed little
[1:45:03] shrimp
[1:45:05] [Music]
[1:45:09] it really becomes even more of a paradox
[1:45:12] because
[1:45:13] you can look at that and say that guy
[1:45:16] don't have anything
[1:45:17] naturally that you could look like he
[1:45:18] could whoop one philistine
[1:45:22] but you see the scripture tells us
[1:45:26] what samson's strength was
[1:45:30] the bible says the spirit
[1:45:33] of the lord came upon him
[1:45:37] [Music]
[1:45:39] that's the strength of israel that's the
[1:45:43] strength
[1:45:44] of our life that's the strength
[1:45:47] of the church is the holy ghost
[1:45:52] [Music]
[1:45:53] that's where samson brother brown would
[1:45:56] take this example and
[1:45:58] say it's like samson
[1:46:01] when they tried to gate him in there
[1:46:04] in in gaza he
[1:46:07] packed up the gates of that city
[1:46:12] and took the gates and carried them off
[1:46:18] this is what when things come your way
[1:46:21] tests come your way this is the
[1:46:24] blessedness
[1:46:25] this is where is no it's not a thought
[1:46:28] about
[1:46:29] deserting it's not a thought about oh my
[1:46:32] what have i gotten into oh no so-and-so
[1:46:35] is going to say this
[1:46:36] oh no what i'm trying to say to you
[1:46:39] there's witnesses all around
[1:46:42] not just me but there's witnesses all
[1:46:43] around here
[1:46:46] and you're going to be a witness too of
[1:46:48] what it is
[1:46:50] to say i know his burden is light
[1:46:54] [Music]
[1:46:55] to where when they would come to you
[1:46:57] brother brown would say they'll come
[1:46:59] and they would say hey how come you're
[1:47:01] not smoking no more
[1:47:03] how come you're not doing this no more
[1:47:05] you see when god
[1:47:07] is so dealing and so moving in their
[1:47:09] life having the right of way
[1:47:11] it's come to a place to be able to set
[1:47:13] down in that life
[1:47:15] then their answer comes i found a
[1:47:18] treasure
[1:47:20] not about not talking about what you
[1:47:22] gave up or what went out of your life
[1:47:24] but you talk about the treasure that you
[1:47:27] found
[1:47:29] because that's what it's been about
[1:47:30] that's who it is that's who our life
[1:47:32] that's what it's about
[1:47:33] it's about him
[1:47:36] this is what it really is to be yoked
[1:47:39] with christ because the truth
[1:47:42] of the matter is the surrendering of our
[1:47:46] will
[1:47:47] makes way for him to come in
[1:47:51] and live his life
[1:47:55] through us who's doing this
[1:47:59] he is he is
[1:48:06] i don't just believe that i know he's
[1:48:07] here
[1:48:09] i know he's here
[1:48:12] and i say this tonight and as we
[1:48:17] but go into prayer think of what the
[1:48:20] blood
[1:48:22] of what the blood of jesus has done
[1:48:26] on your behalf
[1:48:27] [Music]
[1:48:30] it paid the sin debt
[1:48:34] as long as the blood was sealed up in
[1:48:35] that body
[1:48:37] guilt was still over
[1:48:40] the human race nobody could go free
[1:48:45] in the right way but when that blood
[1:48:48] cell
[1:48:48] was broken
[1:48:52] there was a voice
[1:48:55] that came forth out of that blood
[1:48:57] [Music]
[1:48:59] to proclaim liberty
[1:49:04] and our lord jesus went to the cross and
[1:49:07] he said
[1:49:08] the final words three words
[1:49:12] it is finished
[1:49:15] [Music]
[1:49:19] this is what he comes to do
[1:49:24] finish what he started
[1:49:28] you never gave yourself i never gave
[1:49:30] myself a new heart a new spirit
[1:49:32] we didn't do that but he did
[1:49:36] we yielded and god began to work in our
[1:49:39] life
[1:49:40] so they're saying i feel different i
[1:49:41] feel lighter i feel you know even the
[1:49:43] word
[1:49:44] i don't i can't say i understand
[1:49:45] everything what do i do keep
[1:49:49] walking with god when i say walking with
[1:49:53] god
[1:49:54] walk with that vision and that purpose
[1:49:57] to know
[1:49:58] that the god who tapped you on the
[1:50:00] shoulder
[1:50:02] the god who's dealt and removed a stony
[1:50:04] heart and put in a heart of flesh
[1:50:06] gave you a new spirit that is all so
[1:50:09] that he might
[1:50:10] put his spirit in you
[1:50:16] that's the objective then you become
[1:50:18] yoked
[1:50:19] with christ let's pray
[1:50:30] anybody like to be remembered in prayer
[1:50:32] tonight
[1:50:34] amen as we go to the lord in prayer god
[1:50:36] bless you god bless your hands
[1:50:38] heavenly father lord jesus
[1:50:43] this is the greatest greatest desire
[1:50:47] it's the greatest delight of our life
[1:50:50] it's what real joy is
[1:50:53] is being yoked with you lord
[1:50:58] lord through the foolishness of
[1:51:01] preaching
[1:51:03] you chose to save lord
[1:51:06] your god to take and to speak to our
[1:51:09] hearts in such a personal way
[1:51:12] lord i know tonight i'm not only
[1:51:15] speaking to hearts that lord is your
[1:51:19] you're wooing to their hearts lord into

[1:51:38] hearts

[1:51:42] whether here over the internet

[1:51:48] maybe they've been around church for
[1:51:50] years good people fine people

[1:52:02] your goodness to them

[1:52:12] sealed
[1:52:13] been yoked with you
[1:52:16] lord sometimes there's been things
[1:52:20] lord we need a refilling of the holy
[1:52:23] ghost
[1:52:26] jude would admonish us by the spirit of
[1:52:28] god
[1:52:29] say keep yourself in the love of god
[1:52:33] praying in the holy ghost your prophet
[1:52:36] would
[1:52:37] speak to his lord and say when you begin
[1:52:39] to feel like your armor is sagging a
[1:52:41] little bit
[1:52:42] reach down and tug on the bear on the on
[1:52:44] the girdle
[1:52:46] and say lord give me a refilling of the
[1:52:47] holy ghost
[1:52:49] he said when it feels like that maybe
[1:52:51] your lamp is getting
[1:52:53] smoked up
[1:52:56] maybe lord instead of trimming it
[1:52:59] there's been other things that's
[1:53:00] distracted
