wonderful to have you all it's wonderful to have i see other visitors here as well just may god richly bless you it's amen distrust that we just want to receive from him this morning amen so just as you're if you just have your seats just for a moment brother dave pressed he wanted a testimony he'd like to share upon his heart and his brother dave is coming i i'd like to say happy birthday to paul benjamin can you get this okay thank you son god bless you there's something on my heart and i know the only way to get it off my heart i want to i want to give a little testimony but i'm i'm going to be real quick so i'll quite a hurry i'll just back up a little bit i was kind of raised in pentecost and my daddy was a pentecostal preacher and a good one but he backslid and got away from god but i never was converted under pentecost but when i heard this word i knew this message it was god and when i first heard it i had tried to quit drinking and smoking i couldn't i was an alcoholic when i first heard it god took that from me i had tried to quit and couldn't but he took it from me so i i just in there when i when i after i received the holy ghost then some i just want to share just something here with you i was this is i'm going back now 1969 and just a young christian and i was reading malachi 4 and i was sitting in my chair and i was reading us and i was thinking to myself you know i i know brother branham fulfill this but i said to myself i don't see how he could fulfill both of this i know we understand that now to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the children to the fathers but i didn't understand that then and he and he spoke to me in here then and it truly said theo paul voice and it's so tender and he said read what john did i didn't know where that was that in the scripture but i turned right over to luke he led me and started reading or where the angel was talking to john's father that he would go in the power and spiritualizes to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children disobedient to the just and then he spoke to me and he said john fulfill that first part he said brother branham fulfilled the second part and you know when he did all this you could hardly when he was doing it i could hardly realize what was going on but when he did that and i seen it my heart burned deep within me i've never had it burn like that before or since but i know how they feel on the road to him as because he's the same yesterday today and forever and not just wanted a couple other things when my when my mother was dying and i loved my mom she stuck with us when daddy was gone and she was dying and i was over standing by her bed and that the nurse was there you know they knew she was dying and but her heart was you know she was unconscious but her she was you know her body was convulsion and stuff and it just was really hurting me and i was standing there and and he spoke to me and he said she'll be leaving at 5 55 and every time he spoke to me i knew it was never wrong it's always perfect and i leaned over the bed a little bit and i said mommy hang on honey because i looked at my watch and she had a little time i said you'll be leaving pretty soon hang on you know i said you'll be leaving at 5 55. and at 5 55 she went home and even the nurse had put it on her report that's when she went and then another thing that's happened to me if i went through and i won't tell you all lies or anything of time of nervousness and this was a different nervousness than like what i'm feeling now just just a little nervous it was a nervousness that was out of control and even though you knew you were saved it just feels like your mind was going to snap but i knew i was saved that would be okay but it was like i don't know how to describe it you were in a tunnel and you couldn't find the end and that went on like that for six years and i was going to work this is years ago and i stopped at this light and that was bothering me and and i didn't know it then but i stopped there where years later we live right on that road bogut road but god knows what he's doing but while i was there waiting on the light he spoke to me and he said this isn't going to bother you anymore and it went away and i'm driving down the road and i'm trying to see and the tears are streaming for six years of that i can't explain to you you know all but i just but during these meetings god spoke to me and i don't want to say this he hasn't spoke to me that in a long that way in a long time he don't have to he's sovereign he knows what he's doing he knows when to speak and when to be quiet leave me leave it little so but i find that in prayer god still has gifts for us and he speaks to us through the ministry as many a time i've prayed and and here and the brother brother samuel come to poop but he didn't know he don't know what god does and and he speaks to you that way and that's helped me so much but during the special meetings i had some things happen to me and i like i told brother samuel i just felt so betrayed and you know it's took me years i would pray for others forgiveness and we all do it took me years to really mean that from my heart because god's looking right here it took me years and so i i thank god i can but there still was hurt i couldn't get rid of hurt i asked the lord to help me it it wasn't i didn't feel it was something bad i just couldn't get rid when someone you really love and trust if it was an enemy i think i could have handled it better but we know this now i understand it's spirits this spirits that cause people to do things if it wasn't for that they wouldn't do some of the things they do if you would be the holy spirit there they sure wouldn't do some things they could do so so anyway in that like saturday night and the brother was preaching and that and that soul helped me and helped take a lot of that hurt away and that's one thing i was rejoicing but but i know that in a deadly understanding he was asking a question after service there and i did i'd forgot my hearing aids and i thought he said something and he says i must he had to say something different because when i raised my hand he looked at me real stains and i said oh but please understand we human we even make mistakes but anyway i i wanted to say that he so help me another thing i want to share with you i i wear a hairpiece and i'll tell you why i have really bad trouble with sinuses but i wanted to tell you i don't want anything i'm kind of conscious self-conscious of that but i don't want nothing to be in my way or hinder my i want everyone to make it if we can we know they all won't but in your heart you love to see people come to god but even i had to wear a hat when i'm not wearing this and even to bed my sweetheart makes me a little hat that thing that i can put on and i wear them out and she makes me another one so i wanted to share that with you too because i just did and one years ago this sister gave me a little caption like a little cartoon and there was these two eagles in the nest and one of them had on like a hairpiece you could tell it was a hairpiece and the other eagle was telling him so why don't you just admit it you're a bald eagle so brothers do this ball you're just of all eagles god bless you so appreciate that don't you so good to be so good to hear the testimonies of the lord and i know there's more testimonies from these from these meetings of what of what god has done amen and i'm glad that god he's still moving he's still moving and you know sometimes we we don't always maybe have a moment or you know and if things that god does for you sometimes i'll get it by text or i'll get a call from somebody after a service or after this but it's really important to give your testimony amen that testimony just it spreads it's like fire you know within the church david said i will talk of all of his duties david said i won't worry about is it too small or what it is but i'm going to talk of all his doings amen i just i thank god for his mercy amen look we just want to turn our attention here to the word of the lord this morning and maybe could we sing that song you are great you do miracles so great there is no one like you if you like to stand and just rest your legs for a moment [Music] i lift my hands to worship and i bless your holy name you deserve the glory lord i lift my hands to worship and bless your holy name for you are [Applause] [Music] oh there is a new like you [Music] oh there is no [Music] that you are great [Music] is thank you [Music] oh hallelujah let's just go to him in a word of prayer if you have a need on your heart you just want to let it be known to the lord with an uplifted hand lord i have need lord jesus we're not ashamed to say we're a needy people it's true we need you your god beneath the hands of your children that are raised there's many different needs many needs that lord whether it be physical or spiritual even different levels but dear god above every need you are your god above every need in every situation now lord we just invite you this morning lord that you

congregation oh god just just do your work lord do your work in every life to every fight granted lord we pray in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you we want to turn in our bibles to genesis chapter 1. so good to see brother richie great to see you mr angela braden i've been praying you got you've got paula you're just right even with your mom now yeah good to see each and every one of you good to have sister michelle back with us i know the enemy's certainly been battling you know what god is greater amen god is great well let's look here in the scripture verse 11 and god said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so and the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his time and god saw that it was good you'll turn me to colossians chapter one i want to read there as well just a few verses of scripture that we want to read there in verse 18 and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him i say whether they be things in earth or things in heaven and you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight if you continue in the faith grounded settled and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel which you have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven whereof i paul and made a minister who now rejoices sufferings for you and philip that which is behind of the afflictions of christ in my flesh for his body sake which is the church whereof i am made a minister i want you just to lock in on this verse whereof i am made a minister according to the dispensation of god which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of god even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations but is now made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in christ jesus whereunto i also labor striving according to his working which worketh in me my god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated sorry for such a long scripture reading but i just want to draw from these these parts and these thoughts within here and speak just what was just burning on my heart and we were not able to even get into these these avenues before the meeting but i want to speak of i want to speak to you this morning on fulfilling god's desire so often and perhaps as we'll come into this here this morning we we so often speak or express of things that we can say well i'm expecting god to do this i'm expecting god to do that and i'm expecting god to do this but what i began to just drop in my heart just weeks ago god's got an expectation for us so many times we because in order god has a way in a channel that he fulfills his word and he doesn't do it any other way god never changes it god always works through the instrumentality of man and we're not talking about our flesh but we're talking about that part of that lays within our life as that seed that lays there and god himself comes down to move through that channel that he's already reserved for himself and so when we look at this in the very opening of the scripture you find that here you know we we find that of the earth void and darkness and so forth but how that is spoken here the spoken word of god would go out and god would say let the earth bring forth grass and yet the seed was already there in the earth god had already planted that seed within the earth his word had planted it there so when his word was spoken there now remember before it was before a word is spoken it's a thought so when god planted that seed it already had within it the thought or what god desired to be expressed or manifest when he said let there be grass you see when he spoke it it could be left up to a lot of interpretations before you see it but once you see it then there's no other interpretation you see this is what grass is it's the same thing when it comes to the word of god there's a lot of things that as it's spoken but yet when you see the manifestation of it and to know that the manifestation is god god vindicates it with himself his own nature soul it is now when god speaks his word it's god declaring this is the season for the life that is there in the seed that it would come forth so when the word is being expressed the word is expressing the desire that god has for that hour and there's a seed on earth that actually is the corresponding part to what god is expressing to actually be the manifestation of what god is speaking so to recognize that then as paul would lay this out here in colossians 1 and paul would declare of that the very uh purpose that god how god brought him into the ministry that this being a minister he's a minister of the light and of that of the redemption of where god himself coming to bring back and establish a preeminence in his church in the lives of his children and paul would say this is my purpose and remember paul had a lot of other ambitions paul had a lot of other goals paul was not a lazy guy he had ambitions about things but you see when he met god on the road to damascus when he met god face to face right then and there he lost sight of every ambition because he realized the paths and the directions that that was going even though he thought that was right remember the bible says there is a way that seemeth right unto man but wind thereof are the waves of death you see that's why we do not walk by feelings we have to walk by side and that is to look at and say if this is where something is now where will it be on down the road you know how it is some of you that shoot guns or bows or whatever more if you're off at five yards you're definitely going to be off at 100 yards it don't automatically you know what i'm talking about brother joy you know automatically all of a sudden you don't get in there in a prayer and a hope and it's going to hit it at 100 yards it now becomes further off that's why at the very beginning it must be started right and zeroed in on the right target because if it's zeroed on the right target now later down the line it'll be hitting the target right on is that right so you see this is god's desire how god would express this and paul would express that there is the dispensation that god had committed to paul that was that was for the children of god let me just say this to you this scripture in verse 25 right here paul believed that he was going to see the very rapture and the transformation of the body of believers he believed that he would see them but you see god did not let them know that there's going to be seven ages is that right god didn't need to let them know that in order for them to live victorious they only had to receive the light and the message for their time and their day and it would bring forth an overcoming life because that's the kind of seed that god has planted on the earth is seeds of overcomers because god himself is an overcomer god has never been defeated his word has never been defeated it never will be defeated it cannot be defeated and you and i are a part of that word you can't be defeated hallelujah paul said i'm given this dispensation because god himself had reserved that that he would have a body a bride a wife one that he himself that would be able to reflect and receive his seed life and he would actually be able to reflect his life through his church remember the moon itself reflects the light of the sun is that right and to see that even how the scripture would say that the glory of the man is the woman is that right because whatever is is to be reflected you see this is why god does not want the seed of any other man in the church god don't want people god does not want the church sowed with thoughts of other men you know why it produces deadness it produces a deadness where life leaves the church of the living god i don't care if it's quotes being read i don't care if the scripture is being read once it becomes under a man's idea then it becomes a place of death are you hearing me you see where there must be that where the word is there is life there is liberty there it brings forth sons and daughters of god that reflect what god was choosing god does not want his bride bearing the image of any other man and you see it isn't man that's tried to do it but it is satan's desire to always get in there are you with me so this is why that you know when it comes down to it we i'll just flatly say it like this i don't need any other man's interpretation of this message they can keep it and dump it in the trash can i'll say it point blank god has sent to us the perfect interpretation and revelation in this hour and the same mighty angel that inspired the prophet and stood there night after night and opened the seals and revealed the word that's the same mighty angel that we're living under the inspiration and the pulsation of that life we're not bringing forth the image of a man we're bringing forth the image of jesus christ hallelujah so when we look at this this this element paul he would express it was to fulfill god has committed this to me he would feel the urgency that this would be to fulfill that's given to me for you to fulfill that word means complete the word of god we're living in the hour of the completion paul would write it like this the ends of the world are come upon us we're not coming to it we've arrived this is why brother branham would say it like this in invisible union he said now he says to the church the body of christ we're trying to lead to deeper thoughts and higher objectives believing that the coming of the lord jesus is at hand now let me tell you let me just drop this in here when you think of these two thoughts deeper thoughts and higher objectives there there is a place that when it talks about has as it was even uh in the days of lot in the days of noah the bible says they build it they sold and they married were given in marriage and all these other things that they were going going through and doing but you see they had objectives but it's just their objectives were misplaced are you hearing me it's it's wonderful and i'll speak this to the young people or anybody else you should have an objective in life but don't let there be any other objective ahead of jesus christ you can't put nothing ahead of him and expect it to come out right he must be first so here as the prophet would speak and express of this this is deeper than just our natural objectives in life this is when he would speak of this deeper thoughts and higher objectives that's what we're trying to lead the body of christ into and he would speak and say we're looking for the coming of the lord in our generation he said i'm not looking for a revival on our generation i'm looking for the coming of the lord in our generation brother brown would go on to say this now at the end the of that same message invisible union and he would speak of a sister he said there's a sister out of a denomination and she said brother brown i belong to a denomination so we don't have to call that the name of it but she said brother branham i want to get out to the truth i want something deeper than that he said let me quote this blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled you see god has not called us the deep and the deeper thoughts and higher objectives we we recognize it's deeper than just coming to a church it's deeper than just being associated with the message it's deeper than that it's deeper than knowing that god sent a prophet it's deeper than knowing the scriptures it's deeper than knowing the message it deeper it comes into the very depth of jesus christ to where he is the innermost one in our life a higher objective objective that is based on him not on what i can accumulate what i can amount to or what can i what can i rise to but the objective is jesus christ you see these are these are our results these are our desires we want we want something deeper some what we are living for is a higher objective david would write it like this in psalms 42 1 as the heart paneth after the water blows so panteth my soul after the oh god you can satisfy flesh you can satisfy your spirit but your soul is what cries out for the living god because you are made to thirst and there's only one that can satisfy that thirst man can go for many years in their life trying to satisfy that thirst but only one can do it you were put here to fulfill a purpose of god and you must come to it sooner or later [Applause] my soul david said bursteth for god for the living god he didn't say i'm thirsting for church i'm thirsting for god for the living god when shall i come and appear before god in verse seven deep calleth unto the deep at the noise of thy waters pout how many glad when his waters pout you hear them come on the voice of many waters you hear the stirring of the water you see the same angel of the lord that comes down upon the water of his word and begins to trouble that word and he begins to deal with your heart everybody else can look around you can be sitting right next to somebody else they don't there to them it's just passing right through them but to you there's reverberations of the ways of the holy ghost how brother it's more than an emotion it's more than a feeling it might make you emotional but it's something that's reaching down to the depths of your being and you're hearing personally from god it's drawing something out of you deep call it to the deep at the noise of thy water spouts all thy waves all thy billows are gone over me yet the lord will command his lovingkindness in the daytime and in the night his songs shall be with me and my prayer unto the god of my life branham here in the message he takes this and he speaks of how refer to a few places he said there's something he said that he says i know now of the lord that i didn't know a week ago. and he said and that is i know he has a channel ye are the branches we're the one that bears the fruit he's the vine that furnishes the energy but the branches bear the fruit in my name you shall cast out devils nothing shall harm you by no means then we're wrapped in the bundle of life god every believer and he goes on to say how that what god has given to us as believers is a checkbook when we receive the holy ghost god's own life has been deposited inside of you you have received a checkbook he don't need to put his name on it his name's already on it might be pretty simple but let me bring the example if you had a chat or you got it those of you that got checks you know there's one thing about it you would never write a check and put your name on it and just hand it out to somebody right when's the last time you did that for a birthday you put a certain amount on it don't you you just don't put a name on a check and just say well here you go because you know if your name's on that check right there they can write it out paid to the order of whoever and they can write out whatever amount of money is that right are you hearing me but you see jesus christ himself has given this to the believer because he knows that the very desires on the inside of a believer are only godly desires and he's the one that the noise of his water spouts that begins to stir up desires and you say that's what i have need of he said you got the checkbook son go ahead and write it out there is plenty in the bank there is no insufficient funds there is no lacking he still is powerful he still heals the he still delivers he's still cast out devils he still feels with the holy ghost you've got a checkbook and it don't do no good to write it out and put in your pocket either tell a little story i had somebody one time one time that i know of they gave me a check for my birthday they know i like ice cream so they wrote me a check and put in a burner birthday card and they said bro samuel go have ice cream on us well guess what that check i found it two years later you know you know i'm kind of a organized person i'm not a nut in it but i mean you understand i i i i don't know all i got to look at i thought well my lord how did that escape me here it was in that card all i could think about is that laid there for two years and i missed out on triple scoops at mitchell's i missed out on on you know on wild berry cobbler and all those things like that because i i forgot that that was in there are you with me he was there the whole time is that right but i had it tucked away you see that's the same way when you make out the check and the devil says it'll never happen rebuke that devil and go ahead and send it in there's a clearing clearinghouse there's a god who's inspiring you he'll make good on that promise hallelujah amen every redemptive blessing belongs to you look at the situations arise things that arise in our lives instead of looking at the situations of how am i going to get out of this look at it as an opportunity for god to manifest himself are you with me it's an opportunity for god to manifest himself brother brown would say it like this in fundamental foundation of faith what did christ redeem us for he said you ever think about it he said why didn't god just say well i just put his name on the book and you know the atonement and i'll just there's no need of giving him any deep powers and no need in making this man a son of god there's no need in doing that i'll just ask him to believe it and write his name in the book of heaven and that'll settle it but he gave us these redeemed blessings that he that we might operate the work of god by the energy of the holy spirit you see when it's just write your name on a book and just believe it he still is not glorified to be glorified he wants to be manifest through his body through your life hey listen there's no greater testimonies like brother dave was standing right here i could testify right with it he stood right here he spoke about this is the kind of life that it was before life came to me and then the reality is is that the message itself it brought life to him are you with me here on life that tried to get free of drinking tried to get free of that right there but the spirit of god it moves down and it energizes that seed on the inside it wasn't something he had to give up he wanted ten steps to quit it's the power of god that comes down and changes the desire you don't need a patch on your arm to stop smoking cigarettes you just need to meet jesus christ you need more than a patch for your life you need a meeting with jesus christ he won't just patch you up he'll make you a new man he'll make you a new woman on the inside hallelujah that's god's desire that's why you can't get away from it [Applause] hallelujah oh my he said but the fruit now he says it's got to be brought forth from a vine or the fruit can't be brought forth from a vine it has to have the branch to bear the fruit the vine with all of its energy cannot produce anything unless the branch is willing to receive the energy it's a big statement here you ready god is depending on you as a member of his body to bear fruit of his spirit god is depending on you as a member of his body to bear fruit of his spirit now don't forget what he just said above that the vine cannot bear the fruit but it's the branches but the branches must be in the vine and then the life which energizes the branch is what brings forth the fruit so in other words all god wants is channels that have been redeemed that are open and that are available and yielded to him oh glory be to god i'll think of this brother if he's depending on you let's open up our channels let the holy spirit come in tonight and energize us and free us from all these fears and doubt oh i like this too i got to keep reading this he said god healed the sick in every age and will continue to do it in every age where people and churches are willing to let loose and let the holy spirit take control of their being and then they say lord take control take control jesus you see he would go on and i'm just really trying to lay these things in here on god's purpose fulfilling god's desire brother branham would take it here in the same message and he would say as he's praying he said god help the people to recognize from the message this morning and that's what he was preaching on being being channels of god he says that their purpose is not to go to work come in at night eat the meals go to bed read the paper the next morning go back to work again day in and day out neither is it to go to church on sunday morning listen to the sermon go home go to work father we're here to be instruments of yours you redeem them back to their right estate man in his right mind believes god for all things hallelujah just as simple as i made it here i think it was on that friday night the microphone this microphone i've got or this one right here it's no more than just an instrument these glasses that i have they are no more than just an instrument they want they will not they will not do me no good unless they're on my face they are an instrument that helps me see the print and see some of y'all better that's one thing it does but it's an instrument just the way these glasses are i pick them up and i lay them down they're not fighting with me i don't have to chase them around the table i'm not chasing them i don't they're right there what they are they're right where i have them all i got to do is reach down and pick them up the power as it motivates from my mind to reach down and put my hand upon them and pick them up then they'll they do they don't fight against it they yield so the only thing god is asking you and i to do he's not asking you and i to figure it out to try to explain it all he wants us to do is just yield to his hand amen hallelujah we are instruments amen of him glory hallelujah now look at this let me come back into this point now let's come into this colossians 1 25 whereof paul said i am made a minister according to the dispensation of god which is given to me for you to fulfill or complete the word of god every age god has had a purpose you see it even from genesis 1 every day of creation god had a purpose now you know how it feels sometimes where you have maybe as a person you've laid on a lot of things that you needed to get done we're going to do this we're going to do this we're going to do this we're going to do this on memorial day weekend and you realize i barely got this let alone that that that that that that right because there's there's only you have to recognize there's only so much that you can get done but god what god has done he designates so much of his word for a season for a time for an age and yet that word here the promises have been laying over the ages men have probed at them because there have been something burning and longing in the heart of the believer to see the fulfillment of the word let me just tell you something right now if luther was right here in sheffield this morning luther wouldn't be out of lutheran church he'd be right here shouting if wesley come on now if wesley was here right here he wouldn't be at a methodist church i don't care if it's next door if brother bosworth was here or william seymour from out there in los angeles they wouldn't be at the local pentecostal church they'd be sitting right here this morning if you could keep them sitting why because they were moved by the purpose of god in their day they were living to see this word fulfilled luther would look back at that and say that ain't the inspiration of god wesley will look at the methodist church and say that ain't the inspiration of god about dr basworth would stand there and say back to pentecost that ain't the inspiration of god but they would stand here just like peter walking in the back door paul walking in the back door stephen walking in the back door they would rally in this moment [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] every age there's a purpose now let's bring it down home to the lunchbox every age there's a purpose every church there's a purpose every home there's a purpose every individual life it's a purpose it all works down in the great economy and divine order of almighty god you see it will be god in in as it was in every age as when here remember zechariah standing there and the the angel of the lord began to show him the the candelabras and things and he asked him what is it he said i don't know what is it and he began to to show him uh a symbol a picture of of the church of the living god and how that zechariah was looking at it you know it's one thing to see a symbol but to recognize god himself is the interpreter of these symbols just like uh when he said i'm the vine you're the branches god use something that is there even in nature to describe his children or his people and there within that part of the candelabra we realize that here as an instrument there are wicks that go down in there there is oil down beneath and the oil that is beneath is now brought to light because when they light that wick the wick itself is down in the oil and there's fire on top and he was looking at the symbol and how god spoke to him and let him know that this is not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts he was announcing to zechariah right there that spoke of the hour that you and i are living in that has spoke of the seven church ages it speaks of god's working even when he turns to visit the jews it will be an operation of the holy spirit revealing jesus christ as the true atonement and make them ready for their joseph are you with me it's all god's working at hand and to see that even within all of this this is what god is saying that god achieves his purpose amen by placing his spirit inside of your life and my life and he uses his spirit in our life to accomplish his work all he needs is for you and i to surrender more that surrendering never stops does it it's continuing it's continuous surrendering you see so often times and coming into the point oftentimes we we express that you know we're expecting god to come and fulfill his word well you know i i'm just waiting on god to fulfill his word and i'm waiting on god to fulfill his word but god does always fulfill his word there's not one word that god leaves unfulfilled over and over we can run it in the scripture i'm god i change not and though the word that's gone on my lips i will not alter on and on we could go with that god said my word won't return unto me void is that right you see there's living witnesses right here this morning that have received a promise of god into your heart of that of the holy ghost which is the word himself in your life and you can stand right here there might be needs it's pressing in your life but you realize as a believer that what i have i have everything that i have need of is that right everything that i have need of god has already provided it glory be to god god gave you the strength when he gave you the holy ghost he gave you the strength in your life to live a victorious life he put not a fear but the love of god where you find the things of the world fleeing from your life the things that you once loved the things you once cared about the things you once desired that would be natural and normal according to your first birth but you no longer desire them why because a greater one has come into your life and the love of god is reigning there oh i wish i was twice my size right now i feel good god he takes and he fulfills his word through his predestinated channels in his predestinated season now you know this as believers with thee with promises laying out now these are promises remember we're talking about purposes not just for the age the purpose for the age purpose for the church purpose for your life purpose for home there are promises that lay that have laid down through time and you know how satan works satan's objective even with a promise that's been made known is he wants to try to remove patience god is not an impatient god that's never been one of his characteristics the spirit of god does not make a life impatient as a matter of fact the spirit of god i'm trying i'm preaching to somebody this morning i'm telling you where you've got grounds that you can stand and you can back that devil right up you don't got to make him a little side shack on your house you can back him right up the bible says be careful for nothing that means be anxious for nothing when that old thing wants to kind of come around you like you feel like i got to do this and i got to do this and time's running out here and this or that you just stand right in the face and you rebuke that devil because you are not a creature of time you're a creature of eternity you're a child of god that waits on god to fulfill his word you you become a vessel that is available when god says now is the time here you are like the glasses patiently waiting patient doesn't mean we're laying around and well we forget about it that ain't patience patience means we're laying in the promise of god with a steadfastness to say lord i'm expecting on you to fulfill your word and here i am lord as a channel we are keeping ourselves built up in the holy ghost available ready sensitive [Music] don't you want to stay sensitive i want to stay sensitive to him now let me just try to work here on this look how it says in psalms 44 1. now this is talking about when israel came into the land it says now to the chief musician for the sons of cora i wish i could preach on that a little bit more there were some sons that realized they had a great greater representation than their rebellious daddy they refused to be identified with his uprising against the message come on somebody the seed gene on the inside was greater than anything their daddy or their natural family tree could ever do it was greater than any curse that was there it was the blessing of god that was resting there upon the seed of god that was in their life brother they won rotten side songs you don't hear hound dogs in the background of these boys when they wrote they wrote songs of praise oh i had such a bad childhood oh this was done and out this was done and that was done that's true there's a lot of things of things of baggage and stuff that we can have but there's not one person here and i'll say it like this there's not a devil that can say that any of that is greater or that god can't take care of it god can take care of your past the god he knew about you before any of those things ever happened that same god can minister healing to your life maybe where trust was exploited in your life you have a living god who is present that lets you know i can restore trust in your heart hallelujah we have heard with our ears oh god our fathers have told us what work thou didst in their days in the times of old how thou didst drive out the heathen with a hand and plantest them how thou did is to flick the people and cast them out they talk about when they came in the land for they got not the land in possession by their own sword neither did their own arm save them but thy right hand and thine arm and the light of thy countenance because thou had us a favor unto them god made a promise before any of them were ever manifest god already had a promise before there was adam stardust or molly when he spoke to moses and let him know where they would be down in the land for 400 years but he said i'm going to visit them down there is that right i'm going to bring them up out of there and bring them into a landfill of milk and honey so god will always he fulfills his word through his believers now just just just a look at this here in the message proving his word brother brahman says you know he said it's only by the believers that he can prove his word he says no matter how much a person claims oh i believe it brother i believe it brother but he says it's by true believers that he proves his word not by those who say they believe but those who really believe it's by his believing children that he proves his word now he goes in to speak about the time of the ten spies and joshua and caleb he says now he had the believers the old crop had died off the unbelievers who said we can't take it he let every one of them perish every one of them but the believers who was left moses had been taken to glory and the unbelievers had perished in the wilderness and this was their children there were only two that crossed over and that was the believers joshua and caleb they was the believers they was the one who crossed over now listen the statement it's the only way god can do it is by his believing children god does not fulfill his word outside of his believing children so then what does that make his believing children if his word is a promise that has been given and designated for a generation then his believing children to receive that word and ignite something in their life and now it becomes an expression of the thought that was behind the word is that right let there be he said that's the only way god can do it is by his believing children his believers was the one that done it he used them to cross over with god used joshua and caleb to cross over with amen now you might look at joshua and caleb let me just tell you something god specializes in using lives that are flawed and faulty just read it here again this morning brother graham says there are many many more that are faulty and flawed than are perfect he even said the messengers the seven stars that are in the right hand he said even to the human mind they might seem disqualified but god does not do it based on our thinking about things if you and i were choosing somebody to go stand before pharaoh's court we'd never chose somebody with a speaking issue we'd never put somebody with a stuttering problem with a slow tongue you had a one to find somebody to speak but god didn't need somebody to speak elegant words he needed a channel that would let god come on the scene and that's all god needs in your life it's a channel he don't need you to know everything perfectly well i gotta know how this fits here i got to know how this fits here that's not the purpose the purpose is that he might be manifest it seems like i can't remember this and i don't know how to put this together god's not interested in that there's people that can put all kinds of things together but yet they can't yield and hear the voice of god i'm talking about scripture you've got to be able to yield and hear the voice of god y'all hear what i'm saying it's one thing a person can listen to the message day in and day out they can read the scripture day in and day out and you cannot recognizing god coming down and speaking through vessels you know what it is they need a dose with a burning bush i'm gonna say it flat they need to meet the characteristic of god come on friends amen is to recognize god's voice is still speaking god is still sounding forth in it a paradox you don't have to convince nobody those that hear it do not convince them and you're not going to disprove it to them either they know the settlements down here they know his voice as it's speaking to him are you with me glory be to god so see that's what this message this message it came to reveal jesus christ it come that you might recognize him that you might be united with him to where when he would show up it may not be verbatim a quote but you would recognize because you identify the characteristic that he has been revealed to me and you recognize him are you hearing me that's that's where the life of god and the quickening power comes down oh my you know what i'm talking about i've heard people put you know coffee table quotes and these patched up stuff and i've heard them yeah well so-and-so said this and brother brown said this over here now look i don't know every quote in the message but i've got different brothers and different ones will say brother samuel uh this particular quote uh you know maybe they're in a meeting somewhere hey brother samuel this particular quote you you remember can you send me that quote right now i'll go back through it and general pulling it up from my mind and so forth i wish i could remember a whole lot more but it ain't about what you can remember but what i'm getting to is this right here brother joy there's things sometimes you hear and i look at and say that don't jive with the rest of the character somewhere along the line somebody said this to this to this to this to this to this and what you got is an ugly boogie man you don't have christ being revealed you've got somebody's little tweet and then touch here cut off here and cut off there but that is not what the bride of jesus christ is looking for brother you can't feed her on that nonsense the bride of jesus christ is built in the food of the hour brother it illuminates to our heart it's strength into our souls it builds faith muscles in our lives [Music] hey what is it that's kept you throughout this whole time what is it that's put a boldness in your life come on friends i'm talking about in this hour what is it that's put of hair brother we are not where we were a year ago the church has moved up higher there's a greater boldness in the church of the living god there's a greater trust that's come in the church of the living god that god keeps every promise [Music] [Applause] hallelujah i feel glory flowing right now hallelujah he does it the same in every age the same method he has to take believers so in order to have believers just think of this to meet that word he's got to predestinate it to that age he's got to predestinate this thing to be there to meet the challenge of the age he said that's what we see happening today malachi 4 was a promise that laid within the scripture different ones tried to tap into it alexander dowie and everything else all it did was brought a group of people together design illinois and they all come together and they're looking for elijah looking for this and looking for that but you see when god fulfills his word he doesn't need man's help if there's anything we can get driven out of our mind right now being an instrument this pair of glasses don't jump off the desk and say here samuel let me help you it's right here i've never had a screwdriver brother brian jump out of the box and say you need me right here god don't use people that say you need me amen are you with me that's a sure sign god is not going to use you you understand what i'm talking about so many people i want to be a preacher or i want to be of this and i want that's contrary that's contrary because everything that god has called you to do look you and i were looking look even in our own individual walk with god you and i were all about right out there in the world or maybe you might have been sitting in a church dead as a doornail but here you were going about your own way but there was something about it in the season and an hour of time that god knows the better time god knows the moment and there was things that you wonder why can't my life just go on like it was why is this bothering me because this is an hour that god is desiring for you to come forth hallelujah there's nothing no the critics could never stop malachi 4 from being fulfilled and god did it not within not with an intellectual educational man let me just say this to you intellectual doesn't altogether mean dry and everything else intellectual remember that's tied into even emotion are you with me but you see god didn't need intellects to do it god didn't god only god needed is a man that could surrender himself to him brother brown would stand there on the platform night after night and here were men behind him with doctor's degrees men that could explain scriptures men that could explain the word of god men that could sit that you sat down and they said we're going to have a bible study man they could take it back and forth back and forth back and forth and everything else god wasn't interested in that that will never serve the purpose of god unless that life has been yielded to god god had a man by the name of paul but paul said i had to get untied from every pain that i ever knew that is a very paradox of god where god can take a man that maybe god will bring that man out of pentecost or out of the baptist there's got to be such a uniting with god to where the only living of his thinking and his teaching is burnt from his life hey listen now there's many of us even in our lives to wear the spirit of almighty god even after it's burnt in your life you still deal with laying down things that you were taught in a baptist church or a pentecostal church or maybe even in a message church where things were taught in a certain way and you battle with that sometimes in your mind but let me tell you there's a liberating power of the holy ghost that sets you free and brings you right in there till you realize i don't have to do nothing all i've got to do is yield to him i have been accepted into beloved god don't need you walking around with a cat of nine tails he needs you to take that cat of nine tails and start whooping that devil stop beating yourself to death well i failed here i made a mistake there recognize god's grace that's given you grace to rise back up you're under a blood covenant and the blood works the blood speaks if you only let it speak to your life it'll drive away guilt it'll release pardoning power to your life hallelujah glory be to god but look what god's done in your life [Music] you need to have a shamgar moment right now one little scripture in the bible shamgar but out that one little scripture brother aaron there was a mighty man who came to a point the spirit of god anointing his life it's enough not today shamgar could say you're at the wrong time wrong place and you picked with the wrong person come on now you need to let that devil know you're picking with the wrong person he might be bigger than your flesh but he's not bigger than the god inside of you god is greater than your problem god is greater than your circumstance god is bigger than the opposition say unto that mountain be thou moved plopped up and cast into your undersea hallelujah a channel that god is expressing his word through hallelujah whether you know it or not we're the mop-up crew our husband started it right there satan was kicked out from heaven down here on earth he was defeated at calvary our husband went down into the grave he took every sin that that rascal had ever inspired and he deposited it where it needs to go don't you let that liar put that on you that wasn't the real you hallelujah let it be where it is in the bleach of almighty god amen and he rose up on that easter morning triumphant over death hell and the grave he ascended back on high and sent back the same holy ghost and he sent it what into his body that he had redeemed what did he do he redeemed brother greg channels back to himself life this is what you and i were always we were always brother richie sons and daughters of god sister barb we were always that we didn't know it but god knew about it we couldn't even see it in ourselves but god saw it and the deep called to the deep at the knowledge of that waterspouts get drawn upon your life you're my channel you're my daughter you're my son you always belong to me hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah god's depending on us hallelujah hallelujah i don't know whether to go on or just stop reading god if you tell me to go on and then you leave me high and dry then you're gonna get it again amen i want you to look at this here just for a moment let me just try to move to some places here remember god's desire in psalms 80 verse 8 here david is speaking thou speaking to the lord thou hast brought a vine out of egypt thou hast cast out the heathen now remember what we read before in psalms 44 thou didst cast him out thou did his plan but how did he do it through believers how did god do it for believers is that right notice thou has cast out the heathen and planted it thou preparest room before it and did cause it to take deep root and fill and it filled the land the hills were covered with shadow of it the bulls thereof were like goodly cedars and she sent out her bows into the sea and her branches unto the river speaking of israel israel was a vine that was down in egypt and god came down and brought them out of egypt when they were in egypt they were a vine but they could not reflect what they really were you see they weren't in the homeland they weren't in the choice ground they were always of high you were always the son and daughter of god but here here here here is here is here is this this part of the planting of almighty god and notice that it had to be brought into the ordained place because there is fruit predestinated fruit that is to be born by that predestinated vine now i want you just to look at this here just for a moment god speaks in isaiah 5 of how the planning of this vineyard now in isaiah 5 1 now will i sing to my beloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard my beloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill so it is positioned very well and he fenced it what what is the what is the protection of the church of the living god the word is that right he fenced it and gathered out the stones thereof see god's a gardener the very first thing you ever read planted is the bible says god planted a garden god is a gardener one of the things that he uses and he he took out the stones why hindrances he removes hindrances in your life are you with me and he planted it with the choicest vine and built a tower in the midst of it and also made a wine press no what's a tower it's a place that can be watched where there are things that can be see what's approaching you see when god planted this vine he took great care to place it in the right place he also took good care to fence it around bring the protection that was needed he took out all the stones all the hindrances he what's he doing he's opening up the channels that all of that that is there within the ground because you know a plant if there's rocks underneath the soil and some of you probably did this before but you know sometimes when you go to plant grass there was a place where we had built that other house i planted grass and every time when brother when there was a drought like coming up right there in that one particular patch i'd forget about it when fall come but right there that grass would die and you know what you'd see you'd see a rock laying right there right faintly underneath it the grass would burn back off of it because the root can go but eventually it hits a rock and the rock is not meant for the root to bed in and so god himself he takes out he removes all the stones you see what god does god places you and i into a place where we are able to fully enjoy ourselves and yield and bring forth what god is intending for us to do hallelujah and he builds a tower that we that it might be in the midst of and also a wine press because they're going to be fruit are you with me this isn't just one batch of fruit just one batch of grapes don't produce this kind of drunkenness this is why the bible said in revelations 10 8-11 and thou must prophesy again all right to many people's kindreds nations and tongues you see god the very characteristic of god is still speaking and the word again means a cycle it means that very word right there it means a cycle where you plant a crop it you crop you harvest the crop but out of that crop you sow that what's happening it is not a decrease we're not living in a decrease we're living in the hour where the floors are filled with the oil and the wine and the fats of god we're not living in a time of famine for the believer this is a time brother where we are fat as calves at a stall glory be to god we're not deprived we're not waiting on the next sunday school pamphlet to drop in we're not waiting on somebody to send down a notification of what tape we're supposed to listen to we are legals of god hallelujah amen oh my we know in whom we have believed and we're persuaded that he is able to keep that which we've committed against today now think of this here israel was in a natural land given by god this is part we're looking at it very much it types into the part where you and i are are out in this in this time in this hour you and i were in a place that was a away away from god where we needed to be but israel being in a natural land all this was laid out in types that god indeed himself would bring down not a vine from earth but a vine from glory and that vine from glory will be revealed in a glorious branch but israel by being in a natural land they would come under a place that they would come to a spot where god as we read here in psalms 80 where david is is crying out to god that god would return and that he would look down from heaven behold and visit them they had come to a spot to where here they were they were removed from their natural land or we'll say it like this they were still dwelling in israel but yet it was as if they were back in egypt are you with me now amen all because of one thing they failed to listen and obey the voice of god let me just let me just read this this scripture here to you i don't know how much longer it will be i'm not going to keep you all day don't worry but hosea 10 1. israel look what god speaks of then israel is an empty vine he bringeth forth fruit unto himself he was a vine a channel but he's not bringing forth fruit unto god this is fruit unto himself according to the multitude of his fruit he has increased the altars according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images their heart is divided so now god is identifying why that fruit is not coming forth their heart is divided now shall they be found faulty he shall break down their altars and he shall spoil their image let me just let me just let me just say mention this here when we look at their heart being divided just a little bit of a pastoral mode here very much so you realize that in your life you can't live between two desires you can't live you have a desire to serve god but there's desires out here in this flesh you can't live between them you've got to let the desire of god have the right you have to let that come to the right away let god come and raise up what is just a potential and let it be a reality and after god has done that feed that desire because remember you got because after that has come it's white dog black dog are you with me you can't live between two desires you've got to feed the right desire is that right sometimes feeding feeding the wrong desire is simply neglecting to feed the right stay with me the other part it can't be halting between two opinions is this right or is it not right you see god specializes he didn't ask you to resolve that but you invite god like elijah invited invited god on mount carmel at his word remember what what elijah did he said i've done this at thy word god has given us his word he said ask the father anything in my name and i will do it he said seek and you shall find ask and it shall be given to you knock and it shall be open he said he'll give the holy ghost to those who ask him for it you see god has provided a way so you don't have to be between two opinions so you don't have to wonder am i a child of god or am i not a child of god come on now god has a way of of resolving that so that and there can't be a life that's halfway right you can't be a halfway life a part-time christian and this god don't god don't use part-time people i mean the jobs nowadays they'd be happy to get a one-hour person to work right i mean people are making more money staying home than they are working hey these are things that i go into the stores and people are telling me but you see god can't use anything that's part time god will use what you give him you'll use what you're giving but don't you want him don't you want to give him everything amen well lord i'll really serve you when i let me tell you something sometimes you hear people say well when i retire i'll really serve god you're lying you won't do it if you can't do it right now in a time in your busiest time you won't do it then it's about priority it's priorities and things come on friends this is a reality i'm not here to try to hurt your feelings but maybe they do need to be heard god don't want lip service brother samuel that was such an uplifting message it's still an uplifting message because it's a spirit of god trying to minister to our lives to make sure that everything is cut away amen amen israel was in a choice place very nothing you could say with the church they were in i mean where they were positioned in that fruitful hill didn't say nothing well lord i would i would be i would be lord if you if i was under so and so if they were my pastor lord or if i was under servants over here if i was under so and so over there or if i was over here oh lord if i that sounds like the same thing where people said if i was back in the days of noah if you can't recognize god here you wouldn't recognize god back there the same way you respond to right now or lack of you'd have done the same thing then come on somebody you'd have been the same person that would show up to the ark and say wow y'all got a lot done while i was gone preach brother samuel come on now you see it's to be laboring it's to be yielding to god remember there's a purpose for every age the church is not going to carry it on their back daddy ain't going to carry it on his back every life has a purpose that the life of jesus christ might be reflected in an overcoming life amen is that right hey listen there's a devil there's not going to be one devil when the bride is taken from off of this earth there will not be one devil that will be able to raise its head and say you didn't overcome me right through a mini-membered body the spirit of god right through lies lives to where society says you're born like this this can never be changed in your life you let them meet jesus christ one time you don't change them and make a real man out of them it'll make a real lady out of them it'll change their desire it'll change their nature it'll take a man who's an adulterer and a whoremonger a drunk and everything else and it will so change that man on the inside what does that not a church a church can't do that putting your name on a book can't do that but when you meet jesus christ the pillar fire he will change your life [Applause] double-mindedness double-minded the bible says don't let a man if he asks god for anything be it he's double-minded about it don't let him think you'll get be certain of it how could i be certain of it because god said it and the god who said it is the god inspiring you to speak it hallelujah you talking about backup brother i was going down the road the other night going home they pulled somebody over i don't know what was going on fire truck and everything was out here on that one road that goes by i don't remember whatever anyhow that that road i mean there was like about six cop cars behind there i thought man a lot of it must be a real big fire there and we got by and my wife said you see that guy they were putting him in handcuffs i said no i didn't see cause i had to watch the road the curve was right here but then man they had like six or seven people of course you can't blame them nowadays but they had like six or seven cops pulled out there on cars let me tell you something brother and sister you have the reinforcements from heaven all heaven is behind this message all heaven is behind this word brother the holy spirit is the enforcer that is on the job of duty right now to back that word up and to make it come to pass in your life he's there to back up every fear and every doubt to rent it out of your life to where you can stand there and say i don't know how but i know that i know that i know that i know i know this is god's promise for me [Applause] god would speak to david i'm gonna close here don't say amen on that one god would speak to david and how many times you read in the psalms look it up on your bible app on your phone with my whole heart oh god with my whole heart over with my whole heart oh god sometimes things can even get built up in our heart now i'm talking about even after our heart has been completely turned and surrendered to god sometimes there's things that can be kind of heavy things can build up even even fear can set in doubt and other things like that i can't get into all that today but things can try to set up right there in the heart i just thought about that brother andrew touched on this on on friday night things can start to set up within those channels and i think he brought it back to talking about arteries if i'm not mistaken arteries in the in the body what a good thing how to describe that just how brother brandon went through that part of it of a pulsation sometimes you see the bible says as a man thinking and his heart's so easy you know it's hard for you to it's hard for you to go into a fight and thinking you're unable to do it you go into a fighter you go into a let me say i'm not a fighter i know some of you better you may not put on boxing gloves whoo but you can't go into a match with doubt you talk to him then them guys some of them guys are boxers and things like that muhammad ali when he would go into a fight he never walked into a fight with the doubt matter of fact he told him what was going to happen i'm going to knock you out is that right and he got right in their ear and told them some people bit ears but he told them in their ear is that right there was a part about it they did not go in there thinking i might not come out a winner they went in there knowing i'm a winner right now when they stood in the fiery furnace they let the king know i'm on the winning side right now just because you're putting me through just because i'm in this test i'm in this trial that ain't no sign i'm defeated that ain't no sign god's against me i'm on the winning side i'm more than a conqueror you can look that devil in the face and say you already defeated hallelujah i'm on the winning side oh my the spirit of god begins to move through the channels of almighty god hallelujah jeremiah said it like this when israel would come back into the homeland he said god said through jeremiah when you seek me with your whole heart i'll be found of you then hallelujah amen a little sister stood right here last week it came to that place within her life nothing else matters just surrendering it all to god and god came down and met her right here ain't that right sister rebecca god came down and met her right here hallelujah this travel the battle the war is over the victory is pulsating in that heart in life hallelujah come on friends we serving a puny god [Applause] [Music] we ain't serving a god that where you got to pump the people up it's the word of god that has an effect in our life there's one desire we have and that's to see him glorified he said when you seek me with all your heart then i'll bring you back that's an expected end as we come through this land what did he tell joshua stay right with the law of moses see what god gave right there god said i'm not going to alter it this is why when we read malachi 4 we do not just start with a fifth verse we start with verse four remember ye the law of moses what god has started where he would bring a people out and bring them fully in are you with me what was the type there now the antitype where the believer is coming fully into christ where the bride body she's not in the feet she's not in the shins not in the thighs not in the body not in the neck here the head has come to the body the eyes have come to that body and the intelligence the mind of christ has set down in the body now we are the sons and daughters of god amen hallelujah glory be to god you love him planted them in a choice place a choice place choice place god provided all they had needed all they had to do was bear fruit you see it brings us to this this place is that when brother branham makes a statement and you remember he preaches the message how can i overcome and he's looking at he goes back to a tree that he seen laying across a stream of water brother brown went to you know jump onto that tree and when he jumped on it a chunk of the tree fell off and brother brahma he takes the inspiration god inspires him to look at that and recognize he said that's the way that many christians watch what he says christians have become he said they've been dead in sin and trespasses so long though they cannot bear any way or any pressure and you remember as brother ramble bring that message he deals with lives that make us start but there's there must be a going on into full perfection is that right so i want you to think of this jesus said if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it shall be done this tree it's a tree god's liking you and me to trees it was a tree brother brian it was in the right source it was in water but it was positioned wrong it it water it needs water but it was laying down in it instead of abiding in it god's intended every life maybe there's a life here this morning and you don't know him but god's intended maybe it's laid around church for years but god's intended for your life to be upright to be an upright to be planted by him god just don't want you laying in the water god just don't want you around the message amen listen it's all good because the message will it'll give life but you've got to receive it and allow allow the spirit of god to plant you you've got to welcome god and say well you know i've been here all these years and nothing's taken place and i but listen cast that aside cast what has been and let it be a has been and let the spirit of god take a hold right here this morning and he can take where you're laying down and here you are laying in the water he can take your life and he can plant you right here this morning he can plant you in a choice ground you say brother samuel i believe that then why don't you just reach out and make it yours this morning why don't you just make it your own and say lord i don't want to lay down in the stream no more i want to be planted lord i i look around and i i see the fruit of god being made manifest and there's a desire within my life you see god don't want you trying to satisfy that desire with all the pleasures of the world because it leaves you empty drains your bank account puts stress on your life that's not what god desires for you there's only one place of satisfaction and that is in jesus christ a church will never do it you can come to church here for months and months and years and years and still never be satisfied but if you'll ever let go and finally say i cast aside all of my religious garments all of my knowledge all of this and lord i'm asking that you plant me lord oh he will plant you in choice ground where the nutrients are at in christ brother there is no lacking in this ground this ground is not bad soil that's lacking a certain ph this god this gospel this soil it has every vitamin every nutrient that's needed for this hour that every what the seeds of god the vine of god needs in this hour to live in overcoming life it's in jesus christ and those that are tapped in all you got to do is drink from it you're tapped into it you're into the choice place but some of you don't know this problem i'm going through why don't you turn around and say god this is a platform that i'm inviting you to this is an opportunity that i'm inviting you to lord god amen hallelujah let's invite him this morning let's pray heavenly father lord you have spoken so personally and so tenderly to our lives to minister to every heart that's gathered here lord in a very personal personal meeting as if it was just you and them you've come right to their pew better than that you've come right to their heart and you've spoken you spoke to each other each of us and i include myself in that father lord you know the needs of hearts that are setting i pray this morning lord that lord in his spirit of doubt fear lord we resist that spirit we rebuke the enemy the lord would want to make a life afraid what's what's going to happen to me what will i do or any doubt that would arise well that's not for you lord under the authority of the shed blood by the holy ghost the angel of the lord that is standing right here lord god i rebuke that spirit lord that would want to hold a life in bondage i pray lord god may write the lord here this morning lord lies that maybe they've been laying in the water oh they've enjoyed the water but lord it's like over time chunk after chunk after chunk of their life that it wasn't meant for chunks of their life to be missed they were meant lord god to be a tree that's bringing forth his fruit in his seat they were meant not to be laying by or in the water of life but to be planted by the rivers of living water lord god i pray this morning in the sweetness and tenderness of the holy spirit dear god to hearts that are longing in their desire there's a real consecration now in their heart right now i'm going to speak to you lay everything aside every doubt lay it aside and just invite the lord right down into your life and say lord plant my life lord i want to be planted in you i don't want to be lame where the blessings are i want to be planted to where the blessings are flowing through my life granting lord granted for those lives granted lord for those hands here this morning say lord with all everything that's within me i want every channel opened up lord i want to lay aside every offense that's come my way lay aside lord god just lord a real cleansing if there's any bitterness that's there lay it aside lord god oh lord the things lord god of the world cares of this world things that maybe have got in the way but lord right here this morning lord god they're just a desire to say lord as brother samuel used those glasses of his on that desk they were laying there he didn't have to fight him lord he didn't have to chase him down they were ready at any moment for him to use it lord jesus that's how i want to be lord god i want to be there lord jesus at any moment sometimes lord with things of life circumstances that could come or this is where we die daily this is where it times the lord as you will take the branch and you will purge it with tests trials lord jesus we want to be yielded to you lord help us lord we realize lord that yielding to you it's more than what we could just say but lord it's even how we walk daily call us lord help us in our lives lord jesus it listen lord for many lord of your children as they're sitting here lord it isn't dear god that they don't love you it isn't lord that they don't take time to spend with you and spend in your word but sometimes lord just the very simple things that could be designated as harmless but then it becomes harmful it begins to take away begins to get in the way lord jesus help us help us not to look at things help us not to go by feelings but help us lord god help us to try because the bible said trivia spirit help us lord to try everything help us lord not to think about things as though we can handle this and i can take care of this and i'm doing pretty good but lord god may we as paul said work out your own salvation with fear and trembling [Music] lord that word trembling means to distrust one's own ability may we lord god just so rest in you help us lord for every need that's gathered here this morning lord may your children lord may they just continue to take the promises lord as you've inspired them maybe there's promises you've inspired right now to their hearts right here this morning may they take those promises lord no lord god and father as they've wrote out that check they've not wrote out a check to put in their pocket that check lord is sent to be cashed go through the clearing house and the funds received granted lord i pray granted lord for your glory in jesus precious oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah don't you just love him oh i just appreciate him oh my just just bask in his life just take in of that life just say oh lord jesus just washing me lord just wash him he's been washing us with the water of the word lord just continue lord i just want to see more and more and more and more of you lord i want more of him i want to see more of him i desire more of him in my life there's more there's more of him i want and i know what that means is there's got to be less of samuel there's got to be less of samuel and you know what for the great god allows things to come my way allows things to come your way and god gives us opportunities brother carlos so that we can die to ourselves god knows we need to die more to ourselves so god brings us to those place this is why tests and trials come tested trials are not our enemy but he said we are killed all the day long for thy sake we are led to the slaughter that the life of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal body aren't you glad for intestine trials it might be one of the first services you've ever said glory to god for testing trials because you recognize its tests and trials it's the very aid of almighty god to come to you and i to help us to die more to ourselves we come into places where we realize i can't solve this problem i can't make this go away i can't move within this right here and all the while what god is desiring to do is mold more and more of his very character in our life hallelujah oh my let me just tell you something the trial never came to bind you i mean i'm trying to stop preaching the trial never came to bind you the test never came to bind you but remember the tests and trials are only there as the fire was on the ropes that held the hands of the hebrew children the test and the trial is only fire that's meant to lose what god has there inside of your life it didn't come to destroy you it come to remove what was hindering your life hallelujah it's more precious than gold hallelujah glory be to god in the highest amen hallelujah let's stand amen if you're if you if you're able to stand or comfortable is there if you want to sit that's fine too amen let's just let's enter in you need prayer this morning you're more than welcome to come at this time if you need prayer i believe god has met i believe god has met hearts and lives right there in the sea i believe that this morning god meets us right where we're at amen but i'll tell you what if i needed help i've got a promise in the word the bible says one shall chase a thousand is that right you put two together brother it don't just double it just leaps out there in thousands if i needed reinforcement this morning i'd say god i need some reinforcement because after all you're going for your mountain are you with me you're going for what belongs to you amen any good brother joey amen he's good and he brother richard little davey's good isn't he brother saying he's good ain't he amen sister barbie is good isn't he god's faithful amen we are more than conquerors brother greg brother eastside we're not barely going to make it we've already made it we've already made it we're pressing out to it come on now we're not wondering we're pressing out to it but you find you keep poking holes keep poking holes the devil wants to push push back he wants to push push right back is that right push
