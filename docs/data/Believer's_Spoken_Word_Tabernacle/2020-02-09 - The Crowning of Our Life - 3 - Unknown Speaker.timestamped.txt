[48:08] armed with bows and could use both the
[48:13] right hand and the left
[48:15] they were balanced people they could use
[48:19] both the right hand and the left in
[48:21] hurling stones and shooting arrows out
[48:24] of a bow even of Saul's brethren of
[48:27] Benjamin verse 8 and of the gadites who
[48:32] they're separated themselves unto David
[48:35] into the hole to the wilderness men of
[48:38] might men of war fit for the battle that
[48:43] could handle shield and buckler whose
[48:46] faces were like the faces of lions
[48:50] this was the anointing that was a poner
[48:54] it was fixing to transition from lamb to
[48:58] lion whose faces were like the faces of
[49:01] Lions Lions King right and were swift as
[49:06] the Rose upon the mountains they could
[49:11] move they weren't tied down they could
[49:16] move they could be led a man verse 23
[49:22] and these are the numbers of the bands
[49:25] that were ready armed to the war and
[49:28] came to David to Hebron to turn the
[49:32] kingdom of Saul to him according to the
[49:36] word of the Lord verse 28
[49:38] I love how God just puts these things in
[49:41] here verse 28 and Zadok a young man
[49:45] mighty of Valor
[49:47] so as young people you don't have to
[49:50] wait til you're all of a sudden of a
[49:52] certain age to be a mighty man of Valor
[49:53] remember a mighty man of Valor is not
[49:56] somebody who is older aged
[49:58] chronologically it's just to have the
[50:01] mighty God in you amen you're a mighty
[50:05] man of Valor with him in you and of his
[50:10] father's house 20 and two captains verse
[50:12] 32 and of the children of Issachar watch
[50:17] what look where this is at which were
[50:20] men that had understanding of the times
[50:24] to know what Israel ought to do the
[50:29] heads of them were two hundred and all
[50:31] their brethren were at their commandment
[50:34] of Zebulun such as went forth to battle
[50:37] expert in war with all instruments of
[50:41] war fifty thousand which could keep rank
[50:45] they were not of double heart verse 37
[50:51] and on the other side of Jordan of the
[50:53] Reuben nights and the gadites and of the
[50:55] half tribe of manasseh and all manner of
[50:57] instruments with all manner of
[50:59] instruments of war for the battle one
[51:02] hundred and twenty thousand and these
[51:04] men of war that could keep rank came
[51:08] with a perfect heart to Hebron to make
[51:12] David king over all Israel and all the
[51:16] rest also of Israel were of one heart to
[51:20] make David King
[51:24] amen god bless you bless the reading of
[51:27] the word as you're being seated I think
[51:33] it is so astounding many times and
[51:36] perhaps as certain as a Bible reader
[51:39] this morning you have looked over this
[51:42] passage of Scripture in Chronicles and
[51:46] also in the book of Samuel and to see
[51:52] the characteristics of those men that
[51:58] would join themselves unto David
[52:01] remember that each one when we could
[52:04] read through portions here in the in the
[52:06] chapter even when they would come and
[52:09] desire to join themselves to David you
[52:13] realize this was something it was not
[52:15] something like and bear with me for
[52:19] saying it this way this was not a club
[52:21] this was not something of just a group
[52:24] of people getting together they were
[52:28] moved to come to Hebron because they
[52:31] recognized God is with David and David
[52:36] has been anointed king now there with
[52:42] all of them who come remember Saul had
[52:45] been and was the people's choice he had
[52:48] been anointed and he was the people's
[52:51] choice yet God because of Saul's
[52:54] self-will and his disobedience God
[52:58] removed the kingdom from Saul and as we
[53:01] were looking at that last week that the
[53:03] kingdom itself is the person of Almighty
[53:07] God when he read that kingdom he said
[53:10] I've rented and I given it to to thy
[53:13] neighbor to one that is close to thee
[53:15] notice it never was announced out
[53:18] publicly who it was that had been
[53:22] anointed king as a matter of fact the
[53:25] prophet Samuel when you read in the
[53:26] scripture he was concerned when God told
[53:29] him to go and who to anoint and yet
[53:34] remember he had just had said of the
[53:36] house of Jesse I have chosen
[53:38] unto me 1 and here you know Samuel asked
[53:42] he said how how am I gonna get to be
[53:46] able to go there and to do this I'm
[53:49] paraphrasing and he says how am I gonna
[53:51] be able to do this remember what God how
[53:54] he hid the coming of the anointing he
[53:57] hid the coming of the anointing in a
[53:59] sacrifice he said go there to that of
[54:02] the house of Jesse and when it is asked
[54:04] why are you going you tell them you are
[54:06] going to offer sacrifice and we
[54:09] recognize that there's no other way that
[54:11] the true anointing had come then by the
[54:14] true sacrifice it took the true
[54:16] sacrifice of Almighty God becoming one
[54:20] of us that then and through that time
[54:22] barnicle that he himself had had had
[54:25] purposed and had created then that he
[54:28] might be able to shed his blood and pay
[54:31] the price for you and I that that same
[54:33] life could come back upon you and I has
[54:36] as worshipers and bring us into his
[54:39] victory and yet remember it was all
[54:42] something that even as brother Brennan
[54:44] would dramatize it Satan himself could
[54:47] not even understand what was going on
[54:49] when he was watching him walk up the
[54:51] hill of Calvary and taking the the the
[54:54] cross he couldn't figure out what was
[54:56] going on remember every one of them that
[55:00] had even been of a witness or having
[55:02] that of a witness before Abel and on
[55:05] down remember they were awaiting in
[55:07] paradise they had been stung with the
[55:10] sting of death and they had raised
[55:12] naught but this one was different this
[55:15] this one itself this was here God coming
[55:19] down and coming to redeem you and I this
[55:23] was one who was able to take that sting
[55:26] of death and to be able to overcome to
[55:30] take the sin debt to pay that to raise
[55:33] again and to bring you and I into that
[55:37] place in his victory where we can live a
[55:40] triumphant life Oh mine too now to think
[55:44] of this these examples of
[55:46] characteristics as I was saying moments
[55:49] ago when you look at the characteristics
[55:51] that
[55:51] laid here in the scriptures many times
[55:53] I've just looked over these things
[55:55] within the years and perhaps you are to
[55:57] to see how God would identify the
[56:00] characteristics of these individuals
[56:02] they were they were ready to war they
[56:05] were expert in war they could shoot and
[56:08] hurl stones with left and with right and
[56:10] there are certain characteristics that
[56:13] God would would would point out that was
[56:15] within their hearts and let me just say
[56:17] this to you I believe with in all my
[56:20] heart that it was not of their natural
[56:22] abilities but I believe that it was what
[56:26] they had yielded themselves to recognize
[56:30] what God was doing presently in that
[56:33] hour when they came together they came
[56:36] together as the scripture said right
[56:38] here for one heart
[56:40] there was one purpose they were coming
[56:43] together and that was to land that was
[56:46] to burn the kingdom of Saul to David it
[56:49] was for that there was one purpose
[56:51] throughout at all and that was indeed to
[56:54] make David King and to think of how that
[56:57] within it their scriptures that would
[57:00] point out how that they were able to
[57:02] keep rank that that that is mentioned a
[57:04] couple of times in here and it speaks of
[57:07] how that within being able to keep rank
[57:10] or within a battle line you realize that
[57:12] maybe perhaps you don't but yet having
[57:15] having and being a Bey able to keep rank
[57:18] as a very important thing there are
[57:20] things that even as I stood on the
[57:22] battlefield there in Gettysburg a few
[57:24] years ago I stood and stood in certain
[57:26] places heard it told over and over in
[57:28] our days that were there of how that
[57:31] because there were some who begin to in
[57:34] their mind begin to think they could go
[57:36] ahead and advance without having
[57:38] everything in line on the Union front
[57:40] they almost the war was almost lost
[57:43] right there but when we we recognized it
[57:47] was all because the battle line or that
[57:50] which was not a rank was not holding its
[57:52] rank that's one of the greatest things
[57:54] that we can do is to hold our ranks and
[57:57] Army has ranks now I know some of you
[58:00] been in military and things like that
[58:02] before
[58:02] but could you imagine if
[58:04] was as such a thing has an army without
[58:07] any ranks you know there's such a
[58:09] statement that you know but you know we
[58:11] sometimes can say too many cooks in the
[58:14] kitchen you get too many cooks in the
[58:17] kitchen one says a little bit more salt
[58:18] then one said no no no no no you need a
[58:21] little bit more Cayenne this one no no
[58:22] no no no you need a little bit more this
[58:23] and you know the common phrase we mean
[58:26] there's too many cooks in the kitchen it
[58:28] means there's got to be somebody who is
[58:30] the cook in the kitchen and you see God
[58:33] is a God of water and it's something
[58:36] that is a longing within our hearts has
[58:39] his children that is to be in order
[58:42] we even see the earth today the Bible
[58:45] says in the book of Romans chapter a
[58:46] that the earth is groaning and
[58:49] travailing it is longing for the
[58:51] manifestation of the sons of God even
[58:53] how God has put everything when we we
[58:56] find even when we look at juvenile
[58:58] delinquency juvenile delinquency is
[59:00] actually the call of that of what has
[59:03] been forsaken by the parents it's
[59:06] parental delinquency that comes down
[59:08] there is always a desire within a life
[59:11] and a heart for rank and the desire in
[59:14] the hearts and lives of a child of God
[59:17] is I want to be under the Word of God I
[59:21] want to be under his leadership in every
[59:24] part of my life I don't want to I don't
[59:27] want to try to just take my way about
[59:29] things or what I think I want to know
[59:31] for sure Lord is this your direction is
[59:34] this your will because sometimes his
[59:36] will is not exactly what our flesh our
[59:39] spirit wants but our soul desires to be
[59:43] in his will so it's always a tremendous
[59:45] thing to be able to to keep rank and
[59:48] there are ranks within that army and we
[59:51] you know to think of it there are
[59:53] rankings even when we look even among
[59:55] the Angels to think of it when those
[59:57] angels themselves even the angels that
[1:00:00] are there and the angels that fell even
[1:00:02] those that fell and believe Lucifer's
[1:00:05] lie they never fell from the rain they
[1:00:07] still have their rank remember even when
[1:00:10] Daniel was praying in the Book of Daniel
[1:00:12] he prayed for 21 days and there was that
[1:00:15] of the Prince of Persia
[1:00:17] and then here you had that that prints
[1:00:18] there were other demons brother BAM
[1:00:20] we'll call him imps that were under them
[1:00:22] remember even as he stood in Oregon and
[1:00:25] that here brother Benson when that man
[1:00:27] came across it wasn't a man that was
[1:00:29] challenging that the presence of God it
[1:00:32] was the chief of that tribe of demons
[1:00:35] that was there and brother Bramson when
[1:00:37] they solved that their chief what had
[1:00:38] been defeated then he said people begin
[1:00:41] to get out of wheelchairs and off of
[1:00:43] cots
[1:00:44] he said because they saw that that chief
[1:00:46] demon of that area had been defeated oh
[1:00:49] I'll tell you what if we look how the
[1:00:52] Prophet within even the middle of that
[1:00:54] battle the Prophet himself he was drawn
[1:00:56] to come out in the flesh but remember
[1:00:59] now he said he recognized the Spirit of
[1:01:01] God that this is not a flesh and blood
[1:01:04] affair he even held back the policeman
[1:01:06] you see what was happening in the midst
[1:01:08] of the time he was tested to come out in
[1:01:11] the flesh but instead he submitted
[1:01:14] himself to the word of the Lord and God
[1:01:17] took over because it was God that was
[1:01:20] going to fight this battle Oh may God
[1:01:25] help us to recognize and discern over
[1:01:29] and over again we're not finding a
[1:01:30] flesh-and-blood affair no this is
[1:01:35] spiritual wickedness in high places
[1:01:36] these are these are demons that are
[1:01:39] around recognize sometimes is it so
[1:01:42] important to say God help me to have
[1:01:44] that discernment and and go and remember
[1:01:47] it's a spirit it's not that person and
[1:01:50] to recognize greater is He that is in
[1:01:55] you than he that's in the world I've
[1:01:58] said like this when we look at David's
[1:02:00] and then the Ministry here this is a
[1:02:02] body ministry where they came together
[1:02:06] and assembled there with the desire to
[1:02:08] make David King there is a burning
[1:02:10] within our heart we're in that Christ
[1:02:14] Himself has revealed himself to you and
[1:02:17] I and in us and through us that indeed
[1:02:20] he is our king we have been made as the
[1:02:24] Bible says in Revelations 1 he hath made
[1:02:27] us kings and priests
[1:02:29] unto our God and we shall reign on the
[1:02:32] earth we're not just gonna reign there
[1:02:34] in the Millennium but the reigning
[1:02:36] begins now by the reigning of his life
[1:02:40] inside of us he indeed is the king of
[1:02:43] saints there has been a crowning of our
[1:02:46] life like it would speak in the book of
[1:02:48] Isaiah we have been crowned with that
[1:02:50] diadem of beauty of God's own life this
[1:02:54] is a body ministry look at how this
[1:02:57] would even be expressed in the Song of
[1:02:59] Solomon Song of Solomon chapter 6 verse
[1:03:02] 4 thou art beautiful all my love as
[1:03:05] tearsa comely as Jerusalem terrible as
[1:03:09] an army with banners in verse 10 who is
[1:03:13] she that looketh forth as the morning
[1:03:15] fair as the moon clear as the Sun and
[1:03:18] terrible as an army with banners this
[1:03:21] what it what it would seem it was such a
[1:03:23] contrast it's speaking of the beauty
[1:03:27] that is about the bride but yet she is
[1:03:30] she is beautiful she is death in his
[1:03:34] splendor in his glory but when it comes
[1:03:37] time to fight brother she is ready to
[1:03:40] fight and stand upon that word
[1:03:43] she has within her her in an alien
[1:03:45] rights god-given rights that were given
[1:03:48] to her and it's the Spirit of God that
[1:03:50] raises up in her when the enemy would
[1:03:53] want to try to take something through to
[1:03:55] see it is the Spirit of God that raises
[1:03:58] up within her she is an army with
[1:04:01] banners with standard she is moved by
[1:04:04] the unction and the characteristic of
[1:04:07] the Holy Ghost of the word within this
[1:04:09] hour this is why brother Branham would
[1:04:13] make the statement in putting on the
[1:04:15] home of God he would see would speak to
[1:04:18] us in this manner and I love this he
[1:04:20] said God he fortified his army and he
[1:04:24] said how did he fortify himself he did
[1:04:27] it in the form of prophets apostles
[1:04:29] teachers and pastors they said now these
[1:04:33] are all officers of the church it's
[1:04:35] God's dress his inside dress notice blue
[1:04:40] grama would say God's dress he
[1:04:42] in sad dress because others can look and
[1:04:46] say all profit Oh pastor Oh apostle all
[1:04:49] the teacher all evangelists but you see
[1:04:52] sometimes that's all that a person will
[1:04:54] see but the inside dress is where the
[1:04:57] individual recognize that's not the man
[1:05:00] God is using that office but it is the
[1:05:03] word of the Lord that is coming through
[1:05:06] that office that's what's very important
[1:05:08] is not that we are identifying so much
[1:05:12] the office or the flesh but to identify
[1:05:14] that it's a living God that is speaking
[1:05:17] to us
[1:05:18] that's his inside dress it's God brother
[1:05:21] Ram would say like this he said it's God
[1:05:23] dressed up in his church it's God's
[1:05:26] dress where God's presence God's Spirit
[1:05:28] working through men aren't you glad that
[1:05:31] God still dressed up remember that every
[1:05:35] one of these officers it's not outside
[1:05:37] of the body it's in the body the
[1:05:40] ministry in this hour that we have
[1:05:42] received that we have come under in this
[1:05:44] hour he was not outside of the body it
[1:05:47] is in the body it was for the body and
[1:05:51] any office any office that denies the
[1:05:55] word very simple it's a wolf in sheep's
[1:05:59] clothing that's very simple so I tell
[1:06:05] you right now if I was linked up with
[1:06:06] any any anybody I don't care what their
[1:06:08] office I don't care what their title I
[1:06:10] don't care what their previous title was
[1:06:12] it comes down in this in this measure if
[1:06:14] you're not going to walk with this word
[1:06:16] we have nothing to fellowship about
[1:06:20] there's nothing to fellowship about I
[1:06:22] don't hate you I love you but if we have
[1:06:24] nothing to fellowship about this is my
[1:06:27] life this is what I'm looking forward to
[1:06:31] this is who I am
[1:06:34] so when we see it you know brother
[1:06:37] Brandon would say I love how he makes
[1:06:38] this statement here he said you know he
[1:06:41] said when this battle would be we would
[1:06:43] come on God said it like this he said
[1:06:45] now wait a minute I'm going to come and
[1:06:48] be in it my church myself I'm going to
[1:06:52] meet my
[1:06:53] enemy in my church I'm going to beat him
[1:06:57] on his own grounds God declares his
[1:07:02] victory through you and I he declares
[1:07:07] out that he had tried him over every
[1:07:11] every every spirit he has triumphed over
[1:07:14] everything he comes to vindicate that
[1:07:18] and brother Ram goes on to say he has
[1:07:20] said I will be with my army not only
[1:07:23] that but I'm going in my army our great
[1:07:27] warrior great triumphs were general in
[1:07:30] us the word who was made flesh and
[1:07:34] triumphed over every devil every
[1:07:36] sickness even death hell and the grave
[1:07:38] that same general is in us with us not
[1:07:43] outside of the body he is in his body
[1:07:47] his body is under the word general the
[1:07:51] word warrior himself how long till the
[1:07:55] end of the battle Oh think of it but one
[1:07:58] that's leading the battle hallelujah
[1:08:02] think about when Joshua came there that
[1:08:05] day remember
[1:08:06] here comes Joshua it's certain then the
[1:08:10] victory is certain there is no question
[1:08:14] are we going to be able to take Jericho
[1:08:16] victory was certain I hope you with me
[1:08:19] now Joshua one praying Lord if it's your
[1:08:23] will if we take Jericho lord if it be
[1:08:25] thy will if we take Jericho he was not
[1:08:28] praying that but he was saying Lord what
[1:08:31] is your will on how were to tear down
[1:08:33] Jericho what is the direction it was not
[1:08:37] about if it's his will we it is not we
[1:08:40] don't pray if it's God's will to tear
[1:08:42] Satan's Kingdom down that's always the
[1:08:44] will of God but it's asking Lord how
[1:08:47] should this be now remember when Joshua
[1:08:50] came into that place here is Joshua you
[1:08:53] know standing there in the scripture he
[1:08:55] goes out to play he goes out to pray and
[1:08:57] remember the same angel of the Lord that
[1:09:01] God promised there in Exodus the same
[1:09:04] one he spoke in Exodus 29 at
[1:09:06] 23 and he said he shall go before thee
[1:09:09] he shall keep thee in the way and bring
[1:09:12] thee into the place that I have prepared
[1:09:14] for thee that same ange of the Lord made
[1:09:17] himself known in that time notice he
[1:09:20] changed his form and when Joshua saw him
[1:09:22] he saw him and he saw a man and when
[1:09:25] Joshua saw the man he pulled his sword
[1:09:28] out he said are you forests or you
[1:09:30] against us and here's what he did he
[1:09:34] identified himself by the word as
[1:09:38] captain of the Lord's hose am I now come
[1:09:41] and Joshua recognized the ranking
[1:09:45] officer it was right there he knew his
[1:09:48] rank and he said what would you have
[1:09:49] died servant do glory be to god the word
[1:09:55] lets us know our rank aren't you glad
[1:09:59] thank the Lord every power of the
[1:10:02] enemies defeated when he was here on
[1:10:04] earth he took the word triumphed over
[1:10:06] everything Satan had he triumphed over
[1:10:08] death over hail over the grave and he
[1:10:10] rose up the third day he's come back and
[1:10:13] now living in his church this great word
[1:10:16] warrior the warrior that was the word
[1:10:19] and that same warrior that is the word
[1:10:21] in us living himself punctuating every
[1:10:25] sign of his resurrection and his coming
[1:10:28] the great warrior Christ already trialed
[1:10:32] listen to this statement and we'll pick
[1:10:35] this up ain't a thing good English in it
[1:10:38] I like ain't I ain't never stop using me
[1:10:41] and I ain't going to ain't a fate you
[1:10:48] know I was told two kids at school said
[1:10:50] now listen I said this was B you can
[1:10:51] have buddy language but when we go to
[1:10:53] write papers we got to have that kind of
[1:10:55] a language you know that is professional
[1:10:56] you don't want somebody coming in for
[1:10:58] sore so right now we want to have the
[1:11:00] real language right now it ain't a thing
[1:11:03] for me to do in a Fame for me to do just
[1:11:07] follow just follow every Power has
[1:11:14] already been defeated now remember with
[1:11:17] David here these these men
[1:11:19] that we read about when David comes into
[1:11:21] power recognize that David those who had
[1:11:25] served david faithfully while david was
[1:11:29] regarded as an outcast and David wasn't
[1:11:32] hold Saul was seeking for his life
[1:11:34] trying to kill him and and there were
[1:11:36] battles that was going on all around but
[1:11:39] every one of them that stood faithful to
[1:11:42] David every one of those men they
[1:11:44] received their part their position when
[1:11:47] David came into power now there wasn't I
[1:11:51] don't believe with all my heart I don't
[1:11:52] believe this that they were serving
[1:11:54] David like that because of maybe he'll
[1:11:56] make me this maybe he'll make me this
[1:11:58] URI let me just say this to you there's
[1:12:01] a lot of things we could preach on
[1:12:03] crowns maybe God will let me do that
[1:12:04] someday but to realize of all the
[1:12:07] rewards and we're not living what we're
[1:12:09] doing here because well I'm going to
[1:12:11] have this or I'm gonna have this our
[1:12:13] desire is to be where he is and not just
[1:12:19] there but right now we want to please
[1:12:21] him that's how heart's desire you know
[1:12:25] it's like those like that for the Rebbe
[1:12:26] said the black brother when he said you
[1:12:28] know in a dramatizing the angel came to
[1:12:30] him and said get ready for your robe and
[1:12:32] Crown he said the old black brother said
[1:12:34] don't you talk to me about no robe and
[1:12:36] Crown I just want to see the face of my
[1:12:39] Jesus I want to see the face of the one
[1:12:43] who saved me and redeemed me and tell me
[1:12:46] with the spirit and has given me
[1:12:48] strength all along if there's any crowns
[1:12:51] to be given any rewards it's because he
[1:12:54] has given me the strength that I needed
[1:12:57] in order to stand in this moment so
[1:13:04] within that remember as we were looking
[1:13:06] last week in revelations chapter 3 verse
[1:13:10] 11 the admonition is given to the
[1:13:13] Philadelphian age behold I come quickly
[1:13:16] when the brand would pick it up and say
[1:13:18] there's not he said really anything we
[1:13:20] need to discuss on that he said we know
[1:13:22] that he's coming quickly it's very very
[1:13:25] quick hold that fast which thou has
[1:13:32] if you have to hold it it means
[1:13:34] something's trying to take it from you
[1:13:37] that no man take my crown now we're not
[1:13:43] talking about the crown here where the
[1:13:46] Spirit of God would come and Crown our
[1:13:48] lives you know it would almost seem like
[1:13:51] it in a statement like this you would
[1:13:53] say well if we've been crowned by the
[1:13:55] Spirit of God in our soul surely we will
[1:13:58] be crowned with the new body and that is
[1:14:00] true but you'll notice how the
[1:14:01] admonition of the Holy Spirit is to
[1:14:04] every believer down through the ages the
[1:14:06] Spirit of God and the word moving in the
[1:14:08] heart of the believer it does not
[1:14:10] produce laxness slothfulness that's
[1:14:14] where sometimes were the ones that get
[1:14:16] away and thus lawfulness the slackness
[1:14:20] and things comes up but the word of god
[1:14:23] is always that because in the heart of
[1:14:26] the believer the desire is to please the
[1:14:28] Lord the desire is I want to be there
[1:14:31] where he is we're not we're not living
[1:14:34] today for tomorrow we are living for
[1:14:37] eternity so we're at the end of the last
[1:14:41] days and we certainly don't think that
[1:14:43] we need anybody when we need you know to
[1:14:46] be able to look around and say we're not
[1:14:48] in the last days we've arrived this is a
[1:14:51] time of trouble that was spoken of we
[1:14:54] see the identification scripturally and
[1:14:56] we see the promises that were made as it
[1:14:59] was in the days of Noah as it was in the
[1:15:01] days of Sodom we see the conditions of
[1:15:04] the world those are conditions you know
[1:15:07] I think it was like a you know it nursed
[1:15:08] one time when my wife was in the
[1:15:10] hospital he came into the room and never
[1:15:13] had people asked you questions and they
[1:15:14] really don't want to know no answer they
[1:15:21] came in the room you know and it was
[1:15:23] after of some shooting at her at a
[1:15:24] nightclub and things had taken place
[1:15:26] down south and you know he him he was
[1:15:28] waiting on my wife and he came in to
[1:15:30] talk to me and you know he got into this
[1:15:32] place and he said well you know he said
[1:15:34] as a pastor he said what do you think
[1:15:35] about this and I said well and so I
[1:15:37] started going through the signs of how
[1:15:40] that scripture it points to the
[1:15:42] conditions of the world and what
[1:15:44] would be in this time trouble sometimes
[1:15:46] perilous times it speaks of how the
[1:15:48] condition would be if Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:15:51] I went into all those parts of it and
[1:15:52] you know as I was going into it it stops
[1:15:55] me right in the middle the point I
[1:15:56] wanted to finish my point it ain't about
[1:16:02] me finishing my part I was I'm telling
[1:16:04] you the Word of God was so rich but I
[1:16:06] was trying to he had I thought he has a
[1:16:08] question I want to let him see there is
[1:16:11] a scriptural identification of this hour
[1:16:15] and if there's a scripture
[1:16:16] identification then there is a message
[1:16:19] that is to be heralded and declared in
[1:16:23] this hour there is a message to come
[1:16:25] into the safety under the blood of Jesus
[1:16:29] Christ amen so when there's going to be
[1:16:34] crowns that are given out back crowns
[1:16:37] that spoke up in this scripture is that
[1:16:39] crown of a new body this is the
[1:16:42] admonition I want to I want to read this
[1:16:44] here very quickly the Prophet here at
[1:16:47] the latter part in the Philadelphia
[1:16:49] church age would write in that scripture
[1:16:51] he said it is hold fast persevere don't
[1:16:55] give up put on the whole armor of God
[1:16:58] use every weapon he has given us use
[1:17:02] every gift at our disposal and look
[1:17:06] ahead with joy because we are going to
[1:17:09] be crowned by him who is the king of
[1:17:12] kings and Lord of lords I'll tell you
[1:17:15] what right now we're now looking for the
[1:17:17] greatest battle ever fought to come
[1:17:20] we're living in it right now we're
[1:17:23] living in it right now but things be to
[1:17:26] God there's been a preparation God
[1:17:29] prepared for himself what would be
[1:17:32] needed in this hour he is to hold Ajara
[1:17:35] he put the unction listen it wasn't God
[1:17:39] God who's the one who made the promise
[1:17:41] for the hour it's God who raised us and
[1:17:43] those are part of that promise it's
[1:17:45] caught who brings that into the promise
[1:17:48] it was God who dealt with the prophets
[1:17:50] heart it is God who brought all that
[1:17:52] forth even think of it friends the
[1:17:54] confidence
[1:17:55] prophet himself will be able to stand
[1:17:57] there and be able to declare that word
[1:18:00] in this generation do you realize that
[1:18:02] took a courage that was greater than the
[1:18:05] courage of man that took the courage of
[1:18:08] Almighty God and let me say this to you
[1:18:10] that same courage is in the hearts of
[1:18:14] the believer that have received this
[1:18:16] same revelation for this revelation
[1:18:19] holds prevail a power you can't close it
[1:18:25] up you can't shake it up we're gonna be
[1:18:27] taken up
[1:18:30] he keeps catching us away catching us
[1:18:33] away the great battle were in right now
[1:18:39] this is one on the admonition put on the
[1:18:43] harm of God in Ephesians 6 verse 10
[1:18:49] finally my brethren be strong in the
[1:18:53] Lord and in the power of his might put
[1:18:56] on the whole armour of God that you may
[1:19:01] be able to stand against the wiles of
[1:19:06] the devil for we wrestle not against
[1:19:11] flesh and blood but against
[1:19:13] principalities against powers against
[1:19:16] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[1:19:18] against spiritual wickedness in high
[1:19:22] places
[1:19:24] wherefore take unto you the whole armour
[1:19:28] of God that you may be able to withstand
[1:19:30] in the evil day and having done all to
[1:19:36] stand put on the whole armour of God
[1:19:43] God's whole armor is his word it's his
[1:19:49] life
[1:19:50] it's himself amen
[1:19:57] it's not it's not being able to quote it
[1:20:00] there's times to quote but it's to have
[1:20:03] that same life giver the word himself
[1:20:08] living behind your flesh living in the
[1:20:14] depth of our heart
[1:20:16] that's the armor if it's just in our
[1:20:20] mind Satan can overthrow it if it's just
[1:20:23] in our spirit Satan can overthrow it
[1:20:25] in a small message called the contest
[1:20:29] preached at the end of 1962 lebron tells
[1:20:33] us how that satan will come and he'll
[1:20:36] test to see where that word is at in our
[1:20:40] life he comes to test that and in the
[1:20:45] fake of it it in itself reasoning won't
[1:20:48] do
[1:20:50] you know reasoning is a gate of judgment
[1:20:53] but I want you to think when the Prophet
[1:20:56] himself was standing there look look
[1:20:58] what Eve many many miraculous things
[1:21:00] that were already taking place within
[1:21:02] his ministry but he stood right here
[1:21:04] right next to where when his his is his
[1:21:08] child was being taken his wife was being
[1:21:13] taken and Satan came right up next to
[1:21:17] him
[1:21:18] and begin to whisper to him and let it
[1:21:22] be known and begin to lay things out
[1:21:24] well you did this you went and when you
[1:21:26] didn't feel like going and you know and
[1:21:27] every time you know you you prayed for
[1:21:29] the sick you healed him I like how the
[1:21:31] things were spoken with in there brother
[1:21:33] Branham calls it right on he said wait a
[1:21:35] minute I didn't hear one of them God
[1:21:38] healed him but all this was coming as a
[1:21:42] barrage right at the Prophet now
[1:21:45] remember he says he swept right around
[1:21:48] there and my reasonings and he said I
[1:21:50] was about ready to say if that's the way
[1:21:53] he's going to be I was about ready to
[1:21:57] say it but there the armor of God
[1:22:04] this isn't highlighting brother Branham
[1:22:07] it's showing you and out what's
[1:22:09] available to you and I there is an armor
[1:22:12] and to let you know there is the
[1:22:14] strength of the armor of God in the
[1:22:16] midst of battle in the midst of tests
[1:22:21] with you and feel I giving up you can't
[1:22:24] give up there is a greater hold on the
[1:22:29] inside of you mutants started
[1:22:34] you ain't finishing it the seal of God
[1:22:39] standeth sure let me just encourage you
[1:22:44] a moment you might feel weak sometimes
[1:22:47] but that ain't your soul you might get
[1:22:51] down sometimes but that's not your soul
[1:22:54] sometimes you might even in the midst
[1:22:57] coming out of your mouth you might
[1:22:59] complain a little bit you might say why
[1:23:03] let me tell you something that's not
[1:23:05] your soul that's that two parts of
[1:23:07] humanity that is steel around that seems
[1:23:11] her and to show you the deity of God and
[1:23:15] the armor of God is greater than any
[1:23:17] reason or any hold of a devil there is
[1:23:20] no weapon formed against you shall
[1:23:23] prosper the armor of God
[1:23:27] steadfast you maybe not even will have
[1:23:35] an answer sometimes to give somebody you
[1:23:39] maybe don't even have the answer and the
[1:23:41] devil would want to try to shame you
[1:23:43] because well if you really this or
[1:23:45] really that you'd have the answer but
[1:23:47] you realize that the answer himself if I
[1:23:51] don't have it right then I do have the
[1:23:53] answer inside of me that's why when the
[1:23:55] prophet has he stood in god of this evil
[1:23:57] age he's remember here he has already
[1:23:59] breached the Serpent's seed and here a
[1:24:01] man comes to him on the street and he
[1:24:03] said brother Branham if that's what
[1:24:05] you're saying about the Serpent's seed
[1:24:06] he said well where is this serpent at
[1:24:08] where is this at brother Brent said hi
[1:24:11] he said you know I don't even know what
[1:24:12] to say at the time he said but then it
[1:24:14] came out it's here this is what I'm
[1:24:19] saying
[1:24:20] but God in you is the answer to every
[1:24:24] question whether I'm sitting in and
[1:24:32] while we're on this room Oz will put
[1:24:33] this devil in a headdress brother
[1:24:35] Branham was sent in and a doctor's
[1:24:37] office getting a physical and one of the
[1:24:39] doctors raised the question about the
[1:24:41] virgin birth and raised some other
[1:24:43] question brother Graham said I just did
[1:24:45] he said I wasn't able to you know to go
[1:24:47] through it at that moment he said I
[1:24:48] thought Lord well what am I going to do
[1:24:50] how am I going to answer this man
[1:24:52] brother man talks about how he prayed
[1:24:54] months later the Spirit of God moved
[1:24:57] down and all of a sudden they answer
[1:24:59] opened for him he said God make a way
[1:25:02] that I can go back to that doctor and
[1:25:04] there was a door that opened he was able
[1:25:06] to go back and see the doctor said
[1:25:08] doctor he said you remember that
[1:25:10] question the other time when I was in
[1:25:11] here he said God gave me the answer to
[1:25:13] it and took him through
[1:25:20] you ought to just put that devil in the
[1:25:22] headlock right now and don't give him no
[1:25:26] noogie you wear him out the answer is in
[1:25:32] you the Bible is this word that's
[1:25:38] already in our hearts when we have need
[1:25:44] of it the answer will come jesus said
[1:25:47] take no thought what you'll say when
[1:25:50] you're brought before tribunal boards
[1:25:52] and everything else
[1:25:53] what's he letting you and I know don't
[1:25:55] live your life in fear that's what he
[1:26:00] told you Joshua don't be afraid be
[1:26:03] strong and of a good courage this wasn't
[1:26:06] one man speaking to another this is
[1:26:09] Almighty God speaking to us as his
[1:26:13] children Paul would go on in one place
[1:26:21] and call it the armor of light how that
[1:26:25] even when we look at as I told you on
[1:26:27] Thursday night when we look at this
[1:26:28] virtuous woman it's in Proverbs 31 but
[1:26:31] the whole you can preach the whole
[1:26:32] gospel right there out of that that
[1:26:34] woman this is a type of the bride of
[1:26:36] Jesus Christ and it speaks even in verse
[1:26:39] 25 of that chapter and says strength and
[1:26:42] honor are her clothing and she shall
[1:26:45] rejoice in time to come your clothing is
[1:26:49] strength and honor
[1:26:52] amen it is the full armor of God now
[1:26:55] remember you can be looking right at me
[1:26:57] this morning and look at somebody else
[1:26:59] and say brother Samuel you look as wimpy
[1:27:01] as I don't know what but you don't know
[1:27:03] what's on the inside of me same gods on
[1:27:08] the inside of me that spoke this world
[1:27:11] into existence same gods inside of me
[1:27:14] that met Daniel in the lion's den same
[1:27:17] God inside of me here's the same one
[1:27:19] that spoke through David and said to the
[1:27:22] Philistine this day your heads coming
[1:27:24] off the same God that lives in me
[1:27:26] in you that's the same gun that brought
[1:27:28] the walls of Jericho down throw me in
[1:27:39] one way I wish I was twice my size right
[1:27:42] now
[1:27:43] David this is very important as we come
[1:27:46] into this here I want to look just a
[1:27:48] little bit more there's some things that
[1:27:49] the Holy Spirit just begin to quicken in
[1:27:51] my heart here even at the beginning of
[1:27:52] the week and this armor remember we are
[1:27:54] to put on the harm of God we are to use
[1:27:57] every weapon he has given us use every
[1:28:01] gift that is at our disposal and look up
[1:28:08] we've already like Abraham received the
[1:28:11] promised message we're looking up we see
[1:28:15] Moriah we see Mount Moriah we see the
[1:28:18] place where Jehovah Jireh will come
[1:28:20] sweep us away come on now glory be to
[1:28:24] God we see we see it on that mountain
[1:28:27] peak on that seven peak we see that
[1:28:28] sweeping away come on somebody think
[1:28:31] about this now David I want you to catch
[1:28:33] this now in this whole armor of God it
[1:28:36] is God coming inside of you and I and
[1:28:40] arming us as his children and David
[1:28:43] think of how David would express it in
[1:28:45] First Samuel 17 when David went out
[1:28:48] there after saw or not saw but Goliath
[1:28:51] and ran his mouth and tried to belittle
[1:28:53] him and tried to rattle his cage when
[1:28:55] David walked out there one of the things
[1:28:57] that David said he recognized this
[1:28:59] battle is not mine
[1:29:02] this battle is the Lord's that's key
[1:29:07] right there it is also remember the
[1:29:11] Prophet over and over in the message he
[1:29:13] would tell you and I he said if you're
[1:29:15] gonna fight your battle God can't fight
[1:29:17] it
[1:29:19] now I'm not going to ask you to raise
[1:29:21] your hands even though I got both of
[1:29:22] mine out there's times where we were
[1:29:24] fighting their own battles but as long
[1:29:27] as we find them God can't find them is
[1:29:30] that right many times we've approached
[1:29:33] the thought of the armor of God the home
[1:29:35] of God when we look at all these parts
[1:29:37] sometimes our thing
[1:29:38] King is in a manner as though that it's
[1:29:40] something of our strength doing it it's
[1:29:42] not our strength
[1:29:43] it's our surrender to his word to him
[1:29:48] who is already within you and I it's
[1:29:51] giving ourselves over to him every one
[1:29:55] of these parts right here that we begin
[1:29:57] to go through in the armament every
[1:29:59] weapon is about us surrendering to the
[1:30:02] word that is only inside of us this is
[1:30:05] why Zechariah would say when he would
[1:30:08] look at that mountain not by power not
[1:30:11] by might but by my spirit saith the Lord
[1:30:15] this mountain shall be removed in the
[1:30:22] Ephesians 6:14 standing against the
[1:30:26] wiles of the devil stand therefore now I
[1:30:30] know we covered a little bit of this but
[1:30:31] you know what I got obeying my boss he
[1:30:33] just picked me up and turned me around
[1:30:34] on Sunday morning I got to thinking
[1:30:36] about a few things and it just the
[1:30:38] inspiration just started flowing in
[1:30:40] verse 14 stand there for this is our to
[1:30:42] stand having your loins Girt about with
[1:30:47] truth and having on the breastplate of
[1:30:49] righteousness to have our loins Girt
[1:30:51] this is where that it would be the
[1:30:53] fastening where the robes that would
[1:30:55] remember as we said the robes that hang
[1:30:57] down you could not walk the movement was
[1:30:59] not easy with those robes so in order to
[1:31:02] move you actually had to gird yourself
[1:31:05] and obviously this would be a movement
[1:31:06] that would be in haste or where you are
[1:31:09] ready to move quickly now to think of it
[1:31:13] you know brother Brandon would bring us
[1:31:14] out and even Ty know once you notice how
[1:31:16] that my inspiration the Holy Spirit Paul
[1:31:19] when he would write this letter you know
[1:31:21] this letter would be one of the letters
[1:31:22] I believe that would be sent back with
[1:31:23] onesimus he would carry Ephesus
[1:31:25] Colossians that the letter to Philemon
[1:31:27] these different letters and Paul there's
[1:31:30] many different leans to the gospel and
[1:31:32] Paul would write of this in a manner
[1:31:34] after being able to look at all the
[1:31:36] armaments that would be upon that of the
[1:31:39] Roman soldier and power Paul would
[1:31:41] notice under the direction of the Spirit
[1:31:43] of God of how that that armament had was
[1:31:45] all assembled together and the parts
[1:31:48] that were together notice he
[1:31:50] here stand therefore having your loins
[1:31:52] Girt about with truth having on the
[1:31:54] breastplate of righteousness that word
[1:31:56] is truth the breastplate of
[1:31:59] righteousness brother Graham said that's
[1:32:00] having the word inside of you and doing
[1:32:03] what is right now when we look at this
[1:32:07] this breastplate of righteousness you
[1:32:08] see how that this is just so intricately
[1:32:10] woven here with this of the belt but
[1:32:13] notice on the breastplate of
[1:32:15] righteousness when it deals with it I
[1:32:17] like how it says that let me read it
[1:32:18] when it speaks of the Messiah and Isaiah
[1:32:20] 59 16 and he saw that there was no man
[1:32:23] and wondered that there was no
[1:32:25] intercessor therefore his arm brought
[1:32:27] salvation unto him and His righteousness
[1:32:30] it sustained him for he put on
[1:32:33] righteousness as a breastplate and a
[1:32:38] helmet of salvation upon his head and he
[1:32:41] put on the garments of vengeance for
[1:32:42] clothing and was clad with zeal as a
[1:32:45] cloak notice even how this will pertain
[1:32:47] even to the second coming of the Lord
[1:32:49] but notice he put this or I want to draw
[1:32:51] your attention he put on righteousness
[1:32:53] as a breastplate
[1:32:55] now when the Lord Jesus was here he did
[1:32:58] not walk around and have the armor meant
[1:33:00] that we would see upon the Roman
[1:33:02] soldiers but yet he was fully armored he
[1:33:06] had with on him remember he had within
[1:33:09] his heart it was not like David David
[1:33:11] said I've heard I have hidden that word
[1:33:13] in my heart that I may not sin against
[1:33:15] you but here the Lord Jesus in the Book
[1:33:17] of Psalms I believe it Psalms 40 we
[1:33:19] talked about I have not hidden by
[1:33:21] righteousness in my heart but I have
[1:33:23] declared it I have made known that
[1:33:26] righteousness time mercy the salvation
[1:33:28] by loving-kindness you see the
[1:33:30] righteousness of God's own life inside
[1:33:33] of that body that we know as the Lord
[1:33:36] Jesus it was a life where works
[1:33:39] themselves according to the word was not
[1:33:41] something that Jesus was struggling to
[1:33:44] do it was the word that was lived out
[1:33:47] through his life so righteousness and
[1:33:49] let me just shorten this here the
[1:33:51] righteousness the breastplate of
[1:33:53] righteousness
[1:33:54] remember it's not we are not righteous
[1:33:56] because we do righteously we do
[1:33:59] righteously because we're righteous
[1:34:02] they I understand that hey we're not
[1:34:05] made righteous by our works but our
[1:34:08] works declare our righteousness and that
[1:34:10] our righteousness is not our own our
[1:34:13] righteousness is through the Lord Jesus
[1:34:15] Christ so what is the true righteousness
[1:34:17] I'm not looking at myself
[1:34:20] I am looking at the lamb my focus is not
[1:34:23] on me my focus is on him so the
[1:34:27] breastplate of righteousness that
[1:34:29] armament that protection is about you
[1:34:32] and me dwelling in the righteousness of
[1:34:34] Almighty God it is dwelling in his
[1:34:37] presence under his word
[1:34:40] it is him inside of you and me
[1:34:42] performing his word doing what's right
[1:34:49] now I'm not gonna ask how many's made
[1:34:52] mistakes that's not the focus I'm
[1:34:53] talking about here but for doing what's
[1:34:55] right is because the desire within our
[1:34:57] heart I do only those things that please
[1:34:58] him that's the desire that's
[1:35:00] righteousness brother Samuel means
[1:35:03] seeking the will of God about something
[1:35:05] that's the breastplate of righteousness
[1:35:07] yeah it's not about us standing up there
[1:35:11] unless god I've got the breastplate no
[1:35:13] the breastplate of righteousness
[1:35:14] remember this is not of man this is
[1:35:17] God's breastplate remember that same
[1:35:20] breastplate brother Branham picks it up
[1:35:21] the very first time that word is
[1:35:23] mentioned breastplate it's not mentioned
[1:35:25] in a sense of battle but yet we know
[1:35:27] it's used in battle remember when it
[1:35:29] came time for Joshua to know which way
[1:35:31] shall I go shall I take this way shall I
[1:35:33] take that way remember what God had
[1:35:35] spoke through Moses and told Joshua us
[1:35:37] as spiritual Joshua's he said when you
[1:35:40] get ready to go in the battle you shall
[1:35:41] come before Eleazar the high priest and
[1:35:44] he shall come before the Urim Thummim
[1:35:47] that your employment was the breastplate
[1:35:49] program said that's the breastplate of
[1:35:51] the word that the believer is fortified
[1:35:54] by what is it when something there that
[1:35:56] comes up we want to know does every
[1:35:59] light shine upon it Lord is this your
[1:36:01] will helm in Lord Jesus help us Lord
[1:36:08] every thought that every thought every
[1:36:11] objective could be in line with him now
[1:36:13] let's look at this bill to be gird about
[1:36:16] our loins Girt about with truth really
[1:36:19] brave had a lot to say about this the
[1:36:21] scripture don't say a whole lot about it
[1:36:22] but the but but brother Ram says quite a
[1:36:24] bit about it you find different parts in
[1:36:25] the scripture we'll pull up here but
[1:36:27] brother Ram would draw us in because how
[1:36:29] that the Roman soldier was made up they
[1:36:31] would wear that that tunic like the
[1:36:33] white and linen that would be underneath
[1:36:35] the garment when they put the
[1:36:36] breastplate on the breastplate itself
[1:36:38] would be that which would cover that of
[1:36:40] that of that of the upper body it would
[1:36:42] be a part in the front and a part in the
[1:36:44] back and right at the bottom of that
[1:36:46] breastplate would be that of a belt that
[1:36:48] would have with on it those brass
[1:36:50] buttons that were seated on leather and
[1:36:53] what would take place is to wear that
[1:36:55] belt was that they would actually
[1:36:57] tighten that belt on and that belt being
[1:37:00] tightened would actually hold the sword
[1:37:02] tight it would hold the breastplate in
[1:37:05] place it made it easy then for the
[1:37:08] soldier to be ready for combat and be
[1:37:10] ready to travel it's kind of hard when
[1:37:12] your belt gets loose and your sword goes
[1:37:14] to dragon you can't actually be as
[1:37:17] effective as you need to be this is why
[1:37:20] that our loins need to be gird about
[1:37:22] with truth
[1:37:22] so here brother bran would pick that up
[1:37:25] and he would say then he says that belt
[1:37:27] you know it holds the rest of it
[1:37:28] together you know he says women people
[1:37:31] will come in question and say what about
[1:37:33] this and what about that he said you're
[1:37:35] able to reach back and you're able to
[1:37:37] know where that you are standing that
[1:37:40] when the enemy comes against you all
[1:37:42] Devils in Hell cannot upset you so that
[1:37:45] being established in present truth
[1:37:48] you've got the buck you've got the
[1:37:50] buckle tightened up you are established
[1:37:53] in the Word of God when someone could
[1:37:54] come to you seems like out of the blue
[1:37:56] but that's just a lot of times out Satan
[1:37:58] will launch his attacks and he will want
[1:38:00] to make his attack he'll say some news
[1:38:02] story or whatever more and say can you
[1:38:04] believe these people they actually could
[1:38:05] believe this can you believe that
[1:38:07] parents would be praying for their
[1:38:09] children and you can look at it and say
[1:38:10] you know what I don't know the whole
[1:38:11] part of that situation but let me tell
[1:38:13] you what I do know I do know that he
[1:38:16] steel is a healer I do know that he
[1:38:19] still heals the sick I do know that he
[1:38:21] does for for miracles well how in the
[1:38:23] world are you able to live a victorious
[1:38:25] life all good you asked the question
[1:38:27] your
[1:38:28] your buckle is all packed up and you're
[1:38:30] able to stand there and say you know the
[1:38:32] promise is that he said if I go away
[1:38:35] I'll prepare a place for you you know he
[1:38:37] said that the promise of the Spirit of
[1:38:40] Truth that that same life he would come
[1:38:42] back inside of us well I've had the
[1:38:44] experience and that same life the
[1:38:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost is true what
[1:38:50] are you doing you're standing there with
[1:38:52] your belt tightened up David would say
[1:38:59] in Psalms 1832 it is God that Gerdes me
[1:39:02] with strength and maketh my way perfect
[1:39:06] verse 39 for thou hast girded me with
[1:39:09] strength unto the battle Psalm 27:1
[1:39:13] the Lord is my light and my salvation
[1:39:15] whom shall I fear the Lord is the
[1:39:19] strength of my life of whom shall I be
[1:39:23] afraid of brother Brennan would admonish
[1:39:26] just pull up the since she said tighten
[1:39:28] up that buckle tighten yourself up a
[1:39:30] little bit and get ready for it cause
[1:39:33] it's coming don't you worry
[1:39:36] you're gonna have plenty of trouble but
[1:39:41] remember greater is He that's in you
[1:39:47] than he that's in the world see you
[1:39:50] gotta you gotta tighten that up greater
[1:39:51] is He that is in me than he that's in
[1:39:54] the world
[1:39:54] you gotta tighten that up that's why we
[1:39:56] come even to the house of God we come to
[1:39:59] the house of God for inspection
[1:40:01] sometimes so make sure the shoes are
[1:40:09] shined right let me look inside then let
[1:40:14] me look inside there that that weapon
[1:40:16] right there huh aren't you glad you got
[1:40:19] somebody who is an inspector what you
[1:40:21] glad you got somebody who doesn't look
[1:40:24] at a respected person he comes right
[1:40:26] down in our lives and said hey your feet
[1:40:28] ain't shot like they ought to be hey
[1:40:30] your bill yourself hey your belt it's
[1:40:32] all slagging down there come on now
[1:40:34] lighten up your walk a little bit
[1:40:35] tighten up your life a little bit I'm
[1:40:39] grateful for that he says now think of
[1:40:43] this in Luke chapter 12 verse 35 let
[1:40:45] your loins be girded about and your
[1:40:48] nights be burning and you yourselves
[1:40:52] like unto men that wait for their Lord
[1:40:55] when he will return from the wedding
[1:40:57] that when he cometh and knocketh they
[1:40:59] may open unto him immediately so within
[1:41:02] that inspection of the Holy Ghost
[1:41:04] it comes sometimes because remember this
[1:41:06] this belt right here when you read about
[1:41:08] it that belt in brother bramble pointed
[1:41:10] out that belt is the foundation on which
[1:41:12] other things sit if the belt is slack
[1:41:15] that the sword is dragging the ground
[1:41:16] and and it weight as things are waiting
[1:41:19] you down so you've got a tightening up
[1:41:21] every once in a while you got to make
[1:41:23] sure it's tight
[1:41:24] no brother man look how even bring this
[1:41:26] I'll tell you what it would take the
[1:41:27] inspiration of God at this hour
[1:41:29] he said now usually in these old
[1:41:31] soldiers when they would put these
[1:41:32] ornaments of war they had a big belt
[1:41:35] they had buckled it together holding
[1:41:37] over their lone loins these shields to
[1:41:39] keep the enemy Spears off what a lesson
[1:41:41] that is to us and when the line began to
[1:41:45] get weak and hang them the shield they
[1:41:51] would tighten up on their belt and bring
[1:41:54] them up tight
[1:41:56] again when belonging would get weak
[1:42:05] eurowings
[1:42:06] and my loins it gets weak this is why
[1:42:11] Paul would admonish us stand but stand
[1:42:13] having the belt tightened up because on
[1:42:16] the belts tighten up the breastplate
[1:42:17] ain't flopping around but Brenda sorts
[1:42:20] not just dragging on the ground but
[1:42:22] everything is in position in you and
[1:42:26] ready to be used
[1:42:30] how often again and again and again
[1:42:35] watch over the RAM will take this he
[1:42:37] said what a picture what a perfect
[1:42:39] picture today when you begin to feel
[1:42:42] like you're slacking
[1:42:45] or the devil says it's no use reach down
[1:42:51] and tighten up the belt a little bit
[1:42:55] pull the sword a little tighter in the
[1:42:59] hand and go forward when you feel like
[1:43:03] you're slacking I'm going to ask you to
[1:43:07] raise your hands but we've all been
[1:43:08] there when you feel like you're slacking
[1:43:13] well what do I do
[1:43:14] don't get down on yourself that's just
[1:43:16] what the enemy wants you to do what
[1:43:18] should I do
[1:43:19] paint reach down and say Lord I'm gonna
[1:43:22] tighten up the buckle maybe I got a
[1:43:26] little loose in my prayer life a little
[1:43:28] loose and giving myself to the Lord I've
[1:43:30] got a little loose on coming to church
[1:43:32] but Lord forgive me I'm ready to tighten
[1:43:35] up the buckle Lord maybe got a little
[1:43:40] loose and words little loose and things
[1:43:42] being said Lord I'm ready to tighten up
[1:43:45] the buckle the other part of that is
[1:43:54] when the devil tells you it's no use
[1:43:57] what should I do
[1:44:00] tighten up the truth that's the redeemed
[1:44:04] of the Lord say so I am redeemed
[1:44:06] I am the apple of his eye come on
[1:44:11] somebody
[1:44:11] I haven't the apple of his eye I am
[1:44:14] redeemed
[1:44:15] I am bought with a price I am going in a
[1:44:20] rapture I am born again
[1:44:23] I have God's strength within me
[1:44:30] hallelujah go hurry when the devil says
[1:44:33] it's no you see it's tighten up the
[1:44:36] truth around you so I'll tell you what
[1:44:43] right now you just send that send that
[1:44:46] devil away he's trying to wear on you
[1:44:48] about where your belt got a little slack
[1:44:50] you know right here as a soldier brother
[1:44:53] Carlos you were in it and some other
[1:44:54] brothers whose the rest of them that
[1:44:56] we're in the military here ok brother
[1:44:57] Chris and brother
[1:44:59] gomez you know how was they inspected
[1:45:00] you all I don't care what you passed the
[1:45:03] last inspection I don't care what you
[1:45:06] wear on Thursday night this is Sunday
[1:45:07] morning I don't care what you were a
[1:45:12] year ago it's having a fresh experience
[1:45:15] today
[1:45:17] Oh mah Psalms 31 17 she guardeth her
[1:45:25] loins with strength and strengtheneth
[1:45:28] her arms I love this verse 18 she
[1:45:30] perceive a--the she's inspecting
[1:45:32] examining that her merchandise is good
[1:45:35] her candle goeth not out by night the
[1:45:41] bride is accounting of her life
[1:45:44] how is she examining her life she's
[1:45:46] looking into the perfect law of Liberty
[1:45:48] I need to tighten this up in my life
[1:45:53] right now disarmament ain't fitten just
[1:45:56] right on me come on we all like mirrors
[1:46:00] that make us look skinnier unless you
[1:46:02] are skinnier we like mirrors that maybe
[1:46:09] you know seem to like show good things
[1:46:11] about us but you know as a believer
[1:46:12] we're looking the Lord forgive me help
[1:46:18] me I need to work in that air in my life
[1:46:21] that working in the area of the life is
[1:46:23] not me per se taking my hands its
[1:46:26] surrendering to him you see the
[1:46:28] tightening of a tightener is about
[1:46:30] surrendering to you
[1:46:33] we need a continual refilling of the
[1:46:36] Holy Ghost we do we need a continuing
[1:46:40] feeling here
[1:46:41] we need our wicks trimmed because
[1:46:45] sometimes our wicks get they get that
[1:46:47] carbon on them no problem with the oil
[1:46:49] on the inside come on now there no
[1:46:52] problem with the oil the wick is down
[1:46:54] there in that oil it's drawing that it's
[1:46:56] drawing that from that reservoir but
[1:46:59] what happens is the wick itself it gets
[1:47:02] carbon buildup on it it needs to be
[1:47:04] trimmed this is the a love that
[1:47:07] screaming time we want our loins to be
[1:47:10] girded and our lights burning that our
[1:47:14] witness lights that are burning it's a
[1:47:17] witness I am living for the coming of
[1:47:20] the Lord inspection to make sure we're
[1:47:28] holding that armor correctly he has to
[1:47:32] inspect to make sure that that's
[1:47:34] tightened up then we're not got loose
[1:47:36] about some things but the brem says that
[1:47:39] the message token how loosely are we
[1:47:41] getting we need to tighten up the armor
[1:47:44] let certain things in in the home and
[1:47:47] other things never would have let in
[1:47:48] before or we let little things slide and
[1:47:53] little things and making excuses for it
[1:47:55] now sometimes friends it's not not even
[1:47:58] on that level but remember it's still
[1:48:00] with things in our life am i living a
[1:48:03] life that is tightened to the word this
[1:48:08] armor
[1:48:09] it'll never keep the devil off of you
[1:48:10] with excuses when the devil comes to you
[1:48:13] you're not going to say that devil you
[1:48:16] have to take it easy now because Jesus
[1:48:18] understands why I mean why am really
[1:48:19] haven't been praying I've been down and
[1:48:21] you're going to take it easy on me now
[1:48:23] he ain't gonna take it easy on you he's
[1:48:25] gonna mop you from one end to the other
[1:48:28] that guy is merciless you wanna know how
[1:48:31] merciless he is he'd attack a baby
[1:48:35] that's how merciless and how ruthless he
[1:48:37] is I'm telling you that right now is
[1:48:41] because you need to make sure say the
[1:48:42] Lord helped me to be girded out you had
[1:48:45] the resources we have everything that we
[1:48:47] have needed to be tightened up Oh huh
[1:48:54] that's why brother Brad let's say Lord

[1:49:01] I'm glad I need that I need that I need
[1:49:04] for him to come to help us to tighten up
[1:49:06] the armor because sometimes you brothers

[1:49:13] think you're aren't your your your rifle

[1:49:32] around and checking and you know and and
[1:49:34] so forth all of that is preparing for
[1:49:38] the battle because if they're slack and

[1:50:17] our strength comes from the lord and po
[1:50:19] would say I can do all things through
[1:50:22] Christ which strengthens me now watch
[1:50:27] this look at this
[1:50:28] girding up to go fight for the bill to
[1:50:30] go fight in this battle to be able to
[1:50:33] have the foundation and all of that
[1:50:34] girded properly
[1:50:36] watch how brother branham would take
[1:50:37] this up in another message he would talk
[1:50:40] about how he said to think of the ship
[1:50:42] that we are in right now this ship of
[1:50:45] the Lord Jesus in the body of Jesus
[1:50:47] Christ to think of it there's many
[1:50:49] storms that will come there's many
[1:50:51] things that will come against it but he
[1:50:53] says we will safely make it to the other
[1:50:56] Shore and he says when I think of that
[1:51:02] when I think of what making it to the
[1:51:05] other Shore when I think of that it
[1:51:09] takes all the scare away it takes all
[1:51:12] the fuss away takes all the malice away
[1:51:16] makes that fellow who mistreated you
[1:51:18] look like your brother again so let's
[1:51:22] get him by the hand
[1:51:23] now don't get quiet on me now oh my here
[1:51:27] she's done me wrong why what difference
[1:51:29] what difference does it make notice here
[1:51:31] she's done me wrong what difference does
[1:51:34] it make
[1:51:34] I did to you see if listen friends if
[1:51:39] things the way to valuate it is it going
[1:51:41] matter on the other side when we stand
[1:51:44] there that day or we stood up let me see
[1:51:46] where where's brother Joliet huh well
[1:51:48] Joe you remember that they wanted to be
[1:51:50] nothing like that nothing like that so
[1:51:54] it's not going to be that way over there
[1:51:56] I'll keep it here this thing brother Sam
[1:52:05] you're putting things together let me
[1:52:07] read on now here she's done me wrong why
[1:52:09] what difference does it make I did too
[1:52:12] let me put my arm around them and say
[1:52:15] come on brother let's move up a little
[1:52:17] further now tighten up the old he said
[1:52:20] you know Paul talks about this buckler
[1:52:22] do you realize the buckler's the main
[1:52:25] part
[1:52:25] not very much said about it in the Bible
[1:52:28] but that's a real part the buckler's
[1:52:32] what holds the breeches of the harness
[1:52:34] together so I got the helmet of all
[1:52:36] these different pieces on the
[1:52:37] breastplate but don't forget but buckler
[1:52:40] that buckles it up it tightens it up get
[1:52:43] a good tight hold and move on again
[1:52:48] marriage another place here in the
[1:52:50] scripture or in the message where
[1:52:53] brother brand will take that same point
[1:52:54] and I in in in here Christ in the
[1:52:57] mystery of God revealed
[1:52:59] he admonishes the church you just wax
[1:53:02] that much closer together
[1:53:03] take the buckle as the brother testified
[1:53:06] here the other night about having a
[1:53:08] buckle and seeing it in a vision just
[1:53:10] that buckle it buckles on the whole
[1:53:13] armour of God just pull her on tighten
[1:53:18] up move right up close to one another
[1:53:21] love one another anyhow talk nice about
[1:53:25] one another say nice things about one
[1:53:28] another and then God will bless you when
[1:53:34] I have more and more than I've looked at
[1:53:36] this over how the Lord has had me to
[1:53:37] look at this you realize that our
[1:53:39] armament and we're talking about more
[1:53:41] I'm gonna tighten that belt tighten that
[1:53:43] belt he's askin in Lord Lord God help me
[1:53:47] over slackness and the other part of
[1:53:50] tightening the belt is loving one
[1:53:53] another preferring one another edifying
[1:53:57] one another interesting in the scripture
[1:53:59] when you look at all of the one and
[1:54:00] others in the New Testament comfort one
[1:54:04] another all of the one another's what is
[1:54:06] it so part of my victory part of the
[1:54:09] girding up of my loins with truth is
[1:54:12] love
[1:54:14] being able to tighten it up you know the
[1:54:18] only way like brother Graham said right
[1:54:20] here to tighten it up is to be able to
[1:54:21] let things go
[1:54:27] what about in her homes
[1:54:32] well the Bible said that the man is to
[1:54:38] cleave unto his wife is that right how
[1:54:43] can you be victorious without your home
[1:54:47] being victorious you see you've got a
[1:54:50] head you've got to have the right kind
[1:54:52] of a relationship even as husband and
[1:54:54] wife there's times where you have to
[1:54:56] reach down and tighten up the buckle
[1:54:58] tighten up the buckle is a straightening
[1:54:59] everybody else out it's loving one
[1:55:02] another loving one another isn't just so
[1:55:05] much of pretending things or I'll
[1:55:06] pretend this is and there but it's
[1:55:08] recognizing like brother Graham said
[1:55:10] with some of these things right here
[1:55:11] it's recognized yes they maybe have
[1:55:13] mistreated you yes maybe something was
[1:55:15] said wrong but there's the part in the
[1:55:17] word forgive one another even for as
[1:55:20] Christ for God's sake for God has for
[1:55:22] Christ's sake has forgiven us let it go
[1:55:27] Omaha oh ma look at this here in the
[1:55:31] scripture let's go on to this next one
[1:55:34] here in Ephesians 6:15 and your feet
[1:55:40] shod with the preparation of the gospel
[1:55:44] of peace this preparation being prepared
[1:55:51] brother branham would take the example
[1:55:54] and he would take a statement that
[1:55:57] Abraham Lincoln made that in the time of
[1:56:01] peace prepare for war
[1:56:05] brother Brown would tell the people he
[1:56:08] said now in the time while everything is
[1:56:10] running smooth
[1:56:12] you better get ready how many likes
[1:56:15] smooth times I know you do I do too
[1:56:20] but in the smooth times you better get
[1:56:23] ready it's not to scare you look all
[1:56:26] this part right here of the armament
[1:56:28] it's about our surrender it's our
[1:56:32] relationship with the Lord
[1:56:34] and with one another it's running smooth
[1:56:39] you better get ready because Satan ain't
[1:56:40] gonna let it run smooth very long really
[1:56:43] bream said here you are said in this
[1:56:44] convention you know and mom and here we
[1:56:46] are in the service MA you know just
[1:56:48] rejoicing
[1:56:52] the devil may not even wake till you get
[1:56:54] out the door but them said he'll come
[1:56:58] and attack me here - pulpit he said
[1:57:00] he'll attack you while you're sitting
[1:57:01] there in the pew come on now you know
[1:57:04] I'm talking about
[1:57:05] he said he'll tack you tomorrow he said
[1:57:07] you know nowhere he's gonna come he said
[1:57:09] it might come when you're in the store
[1:57:10] he say you know win win he's gonna come
[1:57:13] he said but here's the point be ready be
[1:57:18] ready for win that he does come now
[1:57:20] notice God already knows real trevor we
[1:57:25] don't have to fret and think I wonder
[1:57:26] how the enemy is gonna come toward the
[1:57:29] enemy he might be attacking me he might
[1:57:31] be coming oh he's coming after you but
[1:57:35] don't be looking at him your confidence
[1:57:37] is in the armor that you have remember
[1:57:40] the breastplate of righteousness you're
[1:57:45] looking to the Lord God already knows
[1:57:52] what's coming he already knows think of
[1:57:55] it God already knows even the message
[1:57:58] that he has sent in this hour it's come
[1:58:00] right out of the Bible the promises that
[1:58:03] he made God already knew what would be
[1:58:06] here in this hour he made a promise when
[1:58:09] the enemy comes in like a flood the
[1:58:11] Spirit of the Lord will raise a standard
[1:58:14] against it he makes it real more real
[1:58:17] and more sure
[1:58:24] he's preparing you with his word for
[1:58:32] what you will face whether it's in the
[1:58:35] near or the distant future we don't know
[1:58:38] how or when Satan will attack but we
[1:58:40] want to stay prepared we want to feed on
[1:58:44] the Word of God not just come to church
[1:58:46] we come to feed on the Word of God we
[1:58:50] come to be focused and said Lord speak
[1:58:53] to me take that gift Lord that you would
[1:58:57] fortify the army that I may speak to me
[1:59:00] Lord you know what I have need of Lord I
[1:59:04] need to hear from you this morning Lord
[1:59:06] you know what I'm going through or you
[1:59:08] know what's going to face but it all I'm
[1:59:10] not gonna fear I'm trusting in you
[1:59:13] there's a lot of accusations could come
[1:59:16] but like David said and even he took the
[1:59:19] admonition from the book of Deuteronomy
[1:59:20] when you look at the enemy and you are
[1:59:23] afraid remember I am with you David said
[1:59:27] what time I am afraid I will trust in
[1:59:31] you so where are we at right now the
[1:59:38] preparation the gospel peace you've got
[1:59:40] to train for knockout punches the gospel
[1:59:47] this is not altogether the gospel the
[1:59:52] gospel is the word in power and
[1:59:57] demonstration is that right Paul would
[2:00:01] mention of that it's the word of power
[2:00:02] and demonstration now once you look at
[2:00:04] this armament isn't this tremendous this
[2:00:06] part of the armament and how that it
[2:00:08] would be descripted that our feet would
[2:00:11] be shod with the preparation of the
[2:00:13] gospel of peace to recognize of how that
[2:00:18] we are positioned in Christ when we have
[2:00:21] been brought under the blood of Jesus
[2:00:23] Christ when we have been brought under
[2:00:25] the blood by that of the baptism of the
[2:00:27] Holy Ghost here we are positioned in
[2:00:30] Christ our feet are then shot
[2:00:33] with the preparation of the gospel let
[2:00:35] me tell you about this shouting
[2:00:39] you know they don't hardly make shoes
[2:00:41] anymore that you've got a you can go put
[2:00:43] new new soles on them there's a few a
[2:00:46] few shoes you can get that they'll put
[2:00:47] new there's a cobbler I think an Avon or
[2:00:49] whatever there's not many cobblers
[2:00:51] around let me tell you something when
[2:00:54] God shot Israel when they left Egypt
[2:00:56] they didn't need a cobbler their shoes
[2:01:00] didn't wear out come on somebody that's
[2:01:05] shouting lasted I don't care what
[2:01:09] opposition came I don't care who
[2:01:12] questioned the messenger who questioned
[2:01:15] the message the shouting never wore out
[2:01:21] they were shot walking through the Red
[2:01:24] Sea they were shot when they stood right
[2:01:27] there as a testimony and said if God be
[2:01:30] with us we are more than able to take
[2:01:33] the land they were shot with the
[2:01:35] preparation of the gospel of peace Caleb
[2:01:39] was Joshua so shot that when the Giants
[2:01:42] they came out they weren't even looking
[2:01:44] at the size of the Giants they said my
[2:01:47] lord it's time to come into our
[2:01:49] inheritance
[2:01:50] they were shod with the preparation the
[2:01:54] gospel of peace but the rest of them
[2:01:56] came up and seen those Johnson said Lord
[2:02:00] we're like grasshoppers
[2:02:06] the confession of your mouth you either
[2:02:10] lift you or sink you come on now over a
[2:02:17] beat of God it's a preparation of the
[2:02:19] gospel of peace think about this and
[2:02:21] Isaiah 52 Paul would pick this up in in
[2:02:23] the book of Romans but I love this and
[2:02:24] Isaiah 52 7 how beautiful upon the
[2:02:27] mountains are the feet of him that
[2:02:29] bringeth good tidings that publishes
[2:02:32] peace that bringeth good tidings of good
[2:02:34] and publishes salvation that saith unto
[2:02:37] Zion thy God reigneth that's what the
[2:02:44] gospel is all about he doesn't come to
[2:02:46] present to you and I a puny weak Christ
[2:02:49] it reveals him to be the mighty
[2:02:52] Conqueror that's what's happened in the
[2:02:57] end time here that which was lost now
[2:03:00] who do we see come forth we see the lab
[2:03:03] that has come forth to take the book he
[2:03:05] sent it down to his seventh angel
[2:03:07] messenger and the message that has been
[2:03:10] heralded and proclaimed it does not
[2:03:12] proclaim a defeated life well you're
[2:03:15] gonna have to go to this rehab you'll
[2:03:17] have to do this but you'll never be able
[2:03:18] to get over this here's a self-help book
[2:03:20] no sir it proclaims him as the mighty
[2:03:23] Conqueror he is the triumphant one and
[2:03:29] you in him every devil is under your
[2:03:33] seat you've been shod with the
[2:03:39] preparation of the gospel of peace
[2:03:47] this gospel says to Zion thy God
[2:03:51] reigneth you say brother Samuel that's
[2:03:59] the ministry how beautiful are the feet
[2:04:02] of them that carry the gospel of feet
[2:04:04] and a feet peace that is in the body
[2:04:07] every gift is in the body and you are in
[2:04:11] the body so your feet in my feet are
[2:04:15] shod with the preparation you may not be
[2:04:21] called to preach here with that gift in
[2:04:24] your life but your life preaches you
[2:04:26] preach in many places that our Minister
[2:04:29] the gospel will never be able to get to
[2:04:31] but your life preaches because the life
[2:04:35] of this blood speaker better things
[2:04:39] gonna have a few more minutes
[2:04:41] oh that's about 71% of you Song of
[2:04:50] Solomon chapter 1 7 verse warning how
[2:04:54] beautiful
[2:04:56] are thy feet with shoes I will tell you
[2:05:02] my feet look better with shoes one thing
[2:05:08] I like to know you know that but I want
[2:05:09] they all like about this time of year I
[2:05:10] don't like wearing socks but I thank God
[2:05:13] that spiritually we're not barefoot when
[2:05:20] the product will come home that was one
[2:05:22] of the requirements of the father put
[2:05:24] shoes on his feet our feet have shoes Oh
[2:05:33] princess daughter I want you to think of
[2:05:36] what this is of the Lord laid at my
[2:05:38] heart it's the peace of God the Living
[2:05:41] Word of God in you in action through you
[2:05:45] between you and the world
[2:05:50] here's your life here's the gospel
[2:05:53] here's the light of God's Word it's a
[2:05:56] separation between you and the world the
[2:06:02] testimony of the true witness in your
[2:06:06] life think of it heat read the
[2:06:08] fierceness of the wrath of God he bore
[2:06:10] our judgment he made a way that we might
[2:06:15] walk by the power of his word in us
[2:06:20] so much so that it would be brought to
[2:06:22] our attention go anywhere any place any
[2:06:26] time having your feet shot with the
[2:06:29] gospel
[2:06:35] how old can only be a card let me just
[2:06:38] tell you little bride you're running
[2:06:39] with the testimony the message from the
[2:06:43] throne of God it's the witness of the
[2:06:45] resurrection and you and you have access
[2:06:47] to the throne like Esther let me just
[2:06:52] say this to you not all who remember
[2:06:55] what Jesus told him they would go into a
[2:06:57] village they would preach he said if
[2:07:00] they don't receive it he said then you
[2:07:02] take off your shoes your sandals shake
[2:07:05] off the dust put them back on and go on
[2:07:11] shake off the dust shake off the dust
[2:07:15] has been some disappointment some things
[2:07:17] didn't go the way that maybe you thought
[2:07:19] it was going to go maybe here in your
[2:07:21] life there's been witness and things
[2:07:23] that's gone forth you said it don't seem
[2:07:25] like it's going that way what should I
[2:07:26] do
[2:07:26] shake off the dust and keep running with
[2:07:29] the message don't just get stuck keep
[2:07:33] running with the message amen because
[2:07:36] it's not your words that word that you
[2:07:39] delivered my brother and sister
[2:07:40] it isn't your voice it's God's voice and
[2:07:44] that word itself when it's went forth
[2:07:47] you may not even see it when it comes to
[2:07:50] pass but it is God's word and if there
[2:07:52] is a seed there to bring forth life it
[2:07:55] will be God to do it the same as he did
[2:07:57] it in you this is the encouragement
[2:08:05] every place in Deuteronomy 1124 same
[2:08:09] thing he said to Joshua every place
[2:08:11] we're on the soles of your feet shall
[2:08:12] tread shall be yours every promise you
[2:08:17] can put your foot on that's yours
[2:08:20] every partial the ground is going to be
[2:08:22] contested but be prepared
[2:08:25] be prepared and he's preparing you and I
[2:08:28] aren't you glad for that verse 25 there
[2:08:31] shall no man be able to stand before you
[2:08:33] for the Lord your God shall lay the fear
[2:08:36] of you and the dread of you upon all the
[2:08:38] land that ye shall tread upon as he hath
[2:08:41] said unto you
[2:08:43] Deuteronomy 33 29 happy art Thou O
[2:08:47] Israel who is like unto thee O people
[2:08:51] saved by the Lord the shield of the help
[2:08:54] who is the sword of the excellency
[2:08:56] then enemies shall be found Liars unto
[2:09:00] thee and thou shalt tread upon their
[2:09:04] high places and in Romans 16:20 and the
[2:09:09] God of peace shall bruise Satan under
[2:09:11] your feet sure we are shod with the
[2:09:20] preparation of the gospel of peace this
[2:09:24] is a body ministry it is God working
[2:09:27] through his body he already knows what's
[2:09:33] coming
[2:09:33] God already had eyes in this age already
[2:09:36] seen what's coming that word right here
[2:09:38] is left for you and I to discern it's
[2:09:43] spiritual discernment it's a body
[2:09:46] ministry this is the ministry of the
[2:09:50] bride of Jesus Christ it is a word that
[2:09:53] is going forth in action a word that's
[2:09:57] being reflected in our lives oh my it's
[2:10:06] an inside dress
[2:10:09] and inside dress others can look at and
[2:10:13] say Oh what's he saying
[2:10:16] an inside dress oh but the difference is
[2:10:21] brother Brent said this is the secret
[2:10:23] food he embodies himself he said in the
[2:10:27] gift in my life and he said he gives you
[2:10:29] gifts and he embodies himself and he
[2:10:32] said you're receiving from this word
[2:10:34] that's the secret food it's God
[2:10:39] unfolding to you and I we don't know
[2:10:41] what tomorrow holds but we know who
[2:10:43] holds the future and you know what
[2:10:47] there's times like this having our feet
[2:10:48] shod with the preparation of the gospel
[2:10:50] it comes upon us just like it did when
[2:10:54] Israel returned from Babylon and let me
[2:10:56] close with this remember and every one
[2:10:59] of these parts you can pull use every
[2:11:02] gift at our disposal
[2:11:05] there was accusations when they came
[2:11:08] from Babylon and they begin to come back
[2:11:10] in Atlanta they came under the authority
[2:11:12] of the word to build the temple but
[2:11:16] immediately the enemy came after him he
[2:11:20] kept coming he tried the Bible says he
[2:11:23] wanted to frustrate the work of their
[2:11:25] hands that word frustrate means to break
[2:11:27] the purpose
[2:11:29] the enemy came with accusation after
[2:11:33] accusation the work was shut down for 15
[2:11:37] years they didn't do anything they had
[2:11:41] been commissioned commissioned by God it
[2:11:46] was prophecy that had already been laid
[2:11:48] out all the way in Jeremiah all the way
[2:11:50] in Isaiah but accusation day after day
[2:11:55] and the attacks of the enemy and the
[2:11:57] accusations eventually the work ceased
[2:12:01] but when you read and Hagee out chapter
[2:12:03] 1 maybe this week when you're at home
[2:12:06] you realize at this time and it speaks
[2:12:09] of an in Ezra - here come Hagee I the
[2:12:13] Bible says the Lord's messenger spake in
[2:12:18] the Lord's message saying I am with you
[2:12:22] they begin to call to their attention
[2:12:25] how that they'd kind of just let things
[2:12:27] go but in let them know this is the time
[2:12:34] you let him know this is the time think
[2:12:37] of it the accusations and even we eat it
[2:12:40] that had been come down and said don't
[2:12:42] you build no more this edict that came
[2:12:45] down by one who did not know the
[2:12:47] commission of the word but there was
[2:12:50] Haggai he spoke by the inspiration of
[2:12:54] the Holy Spirit a ministering spirit
[2:12:57] brother Aaron to speak to their hearts
[2:12:59] in that moment
[2:13:02] I am with you saith the Lord the Bible
[2:13:05] says that the elders of the Jews rose up
[2:13:08] and they begin to build they started to
[2:13:13] work and the same men that were bringing
[2:13:15] accusation kept an eye on all the rest
[2:13:17] of them they came to him and they said
[2:13:19] who told you you could build who told
[2:13:21] you you could do this who said you could
[2:13:23] be doing this who said you could do that
[2:13:25] but here's what they did
[2:13:26] they answered them not you don't have to
[2:13:30] answer the devil you've been given
[2:13:32] authority by the Word of God your answer
[2:13:37] is stay focused stay in the purpose
[2:13:43] Alleluia glory be to God the Bible said
[2:13:47] the high of their God was upon them so
[2:13:50] they could not cause them to cease they
[2:13:54] kept building all these things they
[2:13:59] wanted to keep saying who gave you this
[2:14:01] authority who told you could do this who
[2:14:02] took excuse me can you hand me that
[2:14:07] brick right there thank you oh excuse me
[2:14:09] all the time running their mouths their
[2:14:13] oneness steal come at him what they're
[2:14:16] trying to do they're trying to bring
[2:14:17] fear but there was a word that had come
[2:14:21] and they received that word it cast out
[2:14:23] fear
[2:14:24] it should child their feet with the
[2:14:26] preparation of the gospel where the
[2:14:29] girdle where it had been slack it was
[2:14:31] tightened up and what did they do they
[2:14:36] kept building kept building kept
[2:14:40] building and eventually the word came
[2:14:43] back from the throne don't you touch
[2:14:45] these men you leave him alone matter of
[2:14:50] fact if I see it anybody hinders them
[2:14:53] that their house be torn down and let
[2:14:55] them be hanged you might be waiting on
[2:14:58] an answer but keep on movin keep on
[2:15:02] moving you've stood on the word and the
[2:15:05] word is said fast because God is
[2:15:07] faithful who made the promise
[2:15:14] it's a ministering spirit that comes to
[2:15:16] encourage you for deliverance a
[2:15:19] ministering spirit that comes to
[2:15:21] encourage you and say salvation is for
[2:15:23] you a ministering spirit that comes to
[2:15:26] encourage you you said it look like a
[2:15:27] brother branham I heard him the other
[2:15:28] day said brother Branham I've been
[2:15:30] seeking the Holy Ghost for 10 years he
[2:15:31] said why you ain't knowledge
[2:15:33] it's a promise it's given to you take it
[2:15:35] a ministering spirit to encourage you
[2:15:39] this is what belongs to you one man can
[2:15:44] say it to another man it'll never have
[2:15:46] the same effect as God saying it to your
[2:15:49] heart and as the son of God you
[2:15:51] recognize the authority that belongs to
[2:15:54] you a ministering spirit that comes
[2:15:57] forth that says get ready get ready your
[2:16:03] healing the evidence the manifestation
[2:16:06] it's coming we're in a battle but we're
[2:16:15] not in dread why because this armor of
[2:16:20] the Lord it's not like the armor of the
[2:16:22] world this is the armor a love affair
[2:16:27] the breastplate of his righteousness
[2:16:31] being gird up with truth but the same if
[2:16:35] how is that going to calls the sword to
[2:16:37] come up on my life you talking about by
[2:16:38] me just letting things go and say the

[2:20:49] been through many many halls and snares
[2:20:53] many battles battle scarred and how many
[2:20:57] times war God that they would testify to
[2:21:00] us and say I've had to tighten that

[2:21:37] the gospel of peace or when the test the
[2:21:40] trial when Satan would launch his attack
[2:21:43] this is not our focus our focus is not
[2:21:47] upon the attack that's coming where
[2:21:49] we're waiting and saying where's it
[2:21:50] going to come from I wonder which way no

[2:22:16] be facing in the near or distant future
[2:22:18] but this is not our worry your prophet
[2:22:22] told us Lord worry is of Satan's Kingdom
[2:22:26] were of your kingdom Lord and worry
[2:22:29] doesn't belong in this kingdom
[2:22:33] help us Lord I pray that Lord if there's
[2:22:37] one here in Lord this morning always
[2:22:42] Lord God my heart's desire that they
[2:22:44] wouldn't have on that armor of God or
[2:22:48] they'll never be able to stand against
[2:22:51] the wiles of the devil having a
[2:22:53] knowledge of the message knowing that
[2:22:56] God sent a prophet
[2:22:58] knowing Scriptures knowing all of that
[2:23:01] they'll never be able to stand
[2:23:03] Peter was pretty good with the sword he
[2:23:08] could stand there and he could duel with
[2:23:10] the high priest soldiers but when it
[2:23:13] came to really standing with courage and
[2:23:15] he was out there he was away from your
[2:23:19] presence it is out there at school out
[2:23:23] there on the job out there among family
[2:23:26] out in different places all of a sudden
[2:23:29] there's things that started to come
[2:23:31] about
[2:23:32] he didn't have that real spiritual
[2:23:35] courage to stand there in that moment
[2:23:38] the father you sent a personal
[2:23:43] invitation to him hallelujah Peter
[2:23:49] didn't even have the courage to raise
[2:23:51] his own head but you said don't tell my
[2:23:54] disciples and tell Peter I go before him
[2:24:03] Lord when Peter went up there with the
[2:24:06] rest of them in that Upper Room he had
[2:24:12] been able to receive the word from you
[2:24:15] to where he could stand as a spokesman
[2:24:19] and say men and brethren this promise
[2:24:23] that was spoken must needs be fulfilled
[2:24:26] he could have never even spoken he had a
[2:24:29] courage to even wait Oh God
[2:24:33] if there's one Lord John right here this
[2:24:36] morning the Lord without that filling of
[2:24:38] the Holy Ghost may they take them Lord
[2:24:41] God in the call of the Holy Spirit Lord
[2:24:43] to impersonally Lord God and take
[2:24:46] courage you are God say Lord Jesus I
[2:24:50] receive that personal invitation and
[2:24:54] unction for the armor of God in my life
[2:24:58] may they cast aside Lord God every doubt
[2:25:02] every thought may Lord the presence of
[2:25:05] God Lord that's here right now this
[2:25:07] morning Lord speaking to our hearts
[2:25:09] dealing with our lives Lord God may it
[2:25:12] so far
[2:25:12] override Lord and cast out Lord every
[2:25:15] Lord unclean far Lord every thought of
[2:25:18] doubt and unbelief Lord God may its
[2:25:20] override Satan in the name of Jesus
[2:25:23] Christ I rebuke you you have no part
[2:25:26] here where a child of God a daughter of
[2:25:29] God desires to walk in Liberty you are
[2:25:32] defeated you can't hold on no long
[2:25:36] Norden may they walk in that courage up
[2:25:39] to the promise of God and say Lord I
[2:25:42] want that same courage that Peter when
[2:25:46] he came out of the upper room that same
[2:25:51] word that was in flesh that he walked
[2:25:53] with he ate with fellows shift with
[2:25:56] prayed with now that same word was
[2:26:01] trailing on the inside of him Pentecost
[2:26:04] brought a difference in his life
[2:26:06] now the word was made flesh in Peters
[2:26:10] life Peter now had a strength to hold
[2:26:15] that word when opposition would come
[2:26:18] he had the armor of God boeing's were
[2:26:23] gird about with truth feet shod with the
[2:26:25] preparation of the gospel of peace
[2:26:27] having on that breastplate of
[2:26:29] righteousness and the shield of faith
[2:26:34] helmet of salvation sword of a spirit
[2:26:38] praying with all perseverance Lord
[2:26:42] granted this morning
[2:26:47] but I don't know what the needs are but
[2:26:49] I know we're needy people but I'm glad
[2:26:52] Lord

[2:27:00] will granted this morning Lord for every
[2:27:05] life that's here may fear Lord be
