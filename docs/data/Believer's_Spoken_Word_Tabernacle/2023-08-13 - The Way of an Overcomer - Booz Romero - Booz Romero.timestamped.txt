[30:12] glory in Jesus name we pray amen
[30:16] amen God bless you all this morning is
[30:18] it's a privilege to be in the house of
[30:20] the Lord how many can say I'm happy to
[30:21] be in the house of the Lord can you tell
[30:24] that the person next to you I'm happy to
[30:26] be in the house of the Lord amen so
[30:30] and somebody says like and you know you
[30:33] got to tell your face
[30:34] that you're happy to be in the house of
[30:36] the Lord amen you can put a smile in
[30:38] your face and say you know it's good to
[30:40] be in the house of the Lord amen if you
[30:43] have your Bibles let's uh go straight to
[30:45] the word of the Lord and we're so
[30:47] grateful to be here once again and it's
[30:49] been a little while but you know I was
[30:52] thinking you know when we go to
[30:54] different places is not how much you can
[30:57] say but it's like is what the church
[30:59] needs
[31:01] so I hope that I am fulfilling that
[31:04] purpose from the Lord that whatever word
[31:07] we say it is what what you need you know
[31:10] it is not what you what you want to hear
[31:12] you know because we want to hear you
[31:14] know good things or we want to receive
[31:16] all the good things from the Lord but
[31:17] sometimes it is Lord the Lord says you
[31:19] know I want to give you certain things
[31:21] and everybody's not what you want is is
[31:24] what you need
[31:25] amen so this morning let's uh let's see
[31:29] what the Lord has for us and we're gonna
[31:31] go from there amen so if we if you have
[31:33] your Bibles in the Book of Genesis
[31:34] chapter the 22nd and then we're gonna
[31:38] read in the book of Hebrews chapter five
[31:41] so Genesis 20 uh 22
[31:44] verse 17
[31:48] and when you have it you can say Amen
[31:51] sometimes you have it on the screen but
[31:53] it's good to hear the the sound of the
[31:55] of the pages of your Bible say man
[31:58] so Genesis 27 22 verse 17 it says that
[32:02] in blessing I Will Bless thee and in
[32:05] multiplying I will multiply thy seed as
[32:08] the stars of the heaven and as the sand
[32:11] which is upon the seashore and thy seed
[32:15] shall possess the Gate of his enemies
[32:20] amen and now in the book of Hebrews
[32:22] chapter 5 verse 7 through verse 9 it
[32:27] says when you when you have you can say
[32:29] Amen
[32:31] Hebrews chapter 5 verse 7.
[32:40] it says who in the days of his flesh
[32:42] when he had offered of prayers and
[32:45] supplications with strong crying in
[32:48] tears unto him that was able to save him
[32:51] from death and was was heard in that he
[32:55] feared though he he wear a son yet learn
[32:59] he obedience by the things we which he
[33:02] suffered and being made perfect he
[33:05] became the author of Eternal salvation
[33:08] unto all of them that obey him amen you
[33:12] may have your seat so he's as I said
[33:14] it's good to be here amen
[33:17] so I was thinking today you know about
[33:19] what what does it mean to be a sacrifice
[33:22] to the Lord and you know the scripture
[33:24] says like that we have to present
[33:26] ourselves as living sacrifices
[33:30] and then I was listening to a tape and
[33:31] brother random says a priest is to make
[33:35] sacrifices amen and we give to God the
[33:39] sacrifice of our lips giving praise to
[33:42] his name say I don't feel like it how
[33:45] many sometimes come to church and you're
[33:46] like you don't feel like lifting your
[33:48] hands or you don't feel like singing But
[33:51] the prophet of God says do it anyhow
[33:53] and he says that's the sacrifice
[33:56] and then when you feel tired on a
[33:58] Thursday night you have service here on
[34:00] Thursday night but when you're feeling
[34:02] tired on a Thursday night but you're
[34:04] still calm that's the sacrifice
[34:07] Hallelujah he says I'll feel too tired
[34:10] the devil will tell you that till he
[34:12] takes you to hell that's right you're to
[34:15] make a spiritual sacrifice the fruits of
[34:18] our lips giving praise to his name
[34:20] priests and Kings unto God the Bible
[34:23] said we wear he made us priests and
[34:26] Kings unto God so then if we talk about
[34:29] our sacrifice what is to be a sacrifices
[34:31] Lord I don't feel like doing I don't
[34:34] feel like coming I don't feel like
[34:35] praising but I will still gonna make it
[34:38] I will still gonna wake up on a Sunday
[34:40] more on a Sunday morning and it's kind
[34:43] of funny because like through the rest
[34:44] of your week you can wake up early and
[34:46] you don't have an issue even Saturday
[34:48] mornings you can like seven seven in the
[34:51] morning seven o'clock you're already up
[34:53] but on Sundays when you know especially
[34:55] in the time the winter time you know
[34:58] those uh the the the the code like you
[35:00] know the uh the the sheets and
[35:02] everything it feels so good but that's a
[35:04] real sacrifice that you can say you know
[35:06] what I'm gonna I'm going to be an
[35:08] overcomer this morning and I'm gonna
[35:10] make it to church amen so this morning
[35:13] by God's grace I would like to speak to
[35:16] you the way of an overcomer the way of
[35:20] an overcomer
[35:22] the way of an overcomer amen and then
[35:25] the prophet of God says he over again
[35:28] talking about Jesus
[35:30] he says he overcame the personal
[35:32] Temptations of Satan by the word and by
[35:35] the word only
[35:37] and we can leave right now and say
[35:39] what's the way of an overcomer by the
[35:41] word amen in each of the three major
[35:44] trials that corresponded exactly to The
[35:46] Temptations in those corresponded
[35:49] exactly to The Temptations in the Garden
[35:51] of Eden so now the prophet of God I was
[35:54] kind of studying this and he's now going
[35:57] to bring his and he's gonna connect
[35:58] Genesis 3 to look for
[36:02] and when you start seeing those
[36:04] scriptures It's like because in Genesis
[36:06] 3 if you read Genesis 3 it is the
[36:08] serpent coming to Eve and if we if you
[36:11] have read that is scripture the serpent
[36:14] was coming to Eve it was it was not when
[36:17] when he started tempting her but it was
[36:19] a a communication they've been having
[36:21] for we can say for months or they were
[36:25] they were in eternity so but the serpent
[36:26] was there constantly with Eve you know
[36:29] and and that's sometimes the enemy is
[36:31] coming against you like constantly until
[36:33] you give up
[36:35] amen so but here it then if if you go to
[36:39] the Book of Genesis it is talking and
[36:41] then when when it comes to specifics and
[36:44] it says you know but God said and she
[36:46] says but God told us not to partake of
[36:48] the tree but God told us but he's like
[36:51] but God knows because the serpent was
[36:53] quoting the scriptures amen and the
[36:56] prophet of God says the lust of the
[36:58] flesh the Lost of the eyes and the pride
[37:01] of life was what Eve was defeated amen
[37:04] those three things will be always coming
[37:07] against you amen but when Jesus came he
[37:10] was a different story because the same
[37:14] word that he that the devil was using
[37:16] with Eve was the same word that he came
[37:18] and was using with Jesus because he he
[37:21] needed to know he wanted to know who he
[37:23] was
[37:24] amen and Jesus but but the prophet of
[37:28] God says Jesus overcame by the word
[37:31] amen the Eve in Genesis 3 verse 1
[37:34] through 6 through 6 it says she fell to
[37:37] the personal Temptation Of Satan by
[37:40] failing to use the word because she had
[37:43] the word she she was created by the word
[37:46] but she didn't know how to use the word
[37:48] or she was not in church enough
[37:53] but right now let me say that this is
[37:56] the only way to be an overcomer and
[37:59] that's why it says like this is the way
[38:00] of an overcomer and it is only the way
[38:03] that you can know if you're overcoming
[38:05] because the word of God cannot fail
[38:10] are you happy tonight that today that we
[38:13] have an absolute something that will not
[38:16] fail and that's the word of God
[38:19] that's the only way that you can be an
[38:21] overcomer this morning by the word of
[38:24] God
[38:25] and then the prophet of God it says and
[38:27] I was asking myself what is to be to be
[38:30] to overcome and then the prophet of God
[38:32] says it means to recognize the devil at
[38:35] every one of his tricks
[38:38] that is when you're gonna be an
[38:39] overcomer when you're able to recognize
[38:41] your enemy amen because you know when
[38:44] there is going to be a fight you know a
[38:46] boxer or something they are stunning
[38:48] their opponent
[38:49] and the enemy is very good at studying
[38:52] you and know where are your weak spots
[38:56] he knows you more than you know yourself
[38:58] but greater is he that is seeing you
[39:01] then than the one that's in the world
[39:03] amen and then you know and then the
[39:06] prophet of God says a lot of people say
[39:08] that there is no devil why because they
[39:10] don't want to recognize that there is
[39:12] something wrong with them
[39:14] but when you recognize who you are and
[39:16] then then you're gonna be an overcomer
[39:18] because now now you're you can enter
[39:20] into that word and you can recognize
[39:23] your need and say Lord I need you this
[39:25] morning I need you in my marriage I need
[39:27] you in my home I need you to how to deal
[39:30] with my children
[39:32] you know I've seen some examples on how
[39:34] parents they are they are so blind with
[39:37] their kids and they're like oh you know
[39:38] he's an angel she is an angel but then
[39:41] you see the life of those kids and like
[39:43] no those Not Angels
[39:45] but until the parents recognize that
[39:47] those kids need the Holy Spirit
[39:50] then they will be like well my son or my
[39:53] daughter is not an angel they need the
[39:55] Lord
[39:56] because then they are blaming everybody
[39:58] else for the mistakes of your children
[40:03] amen that's not in my notes amen
[40:07] it's always good to be here
[40:12] I was thinking you know maybe I will
[40:14] preach in Spanish
[40:18] you have a lot of Spanish-speaking
[40:20] people here and then maybe we have a
[40:21] translator here but then like like no
[40:23] bill let's just keep her whole her peace
[40:25] amen
[40:27] and but the prophet of God says now he
[40:29] says and you must recognize him real who
[40:32] do you have to recognize as real your
[40:34] your enemy
[40:36] he knows you he knows you you know he
[40:39] knows you when you wake up in the
[40:40] morning he knows okay you know now this
[40:42] is coming but you know the prophet of
[40:44] God says you give me a person that when
[40:47] that person kind of wakes up or kind of
[40:50] opens his eyes or her eyes in the
[40:52] morning that the enemy's gonna be like
[40:54] oh no this is per this person is coming
[40:56] again
[40:58] wouldn't you like to live that life that
[41:01] the enemy is not pleased when you wake
[41:03] up in the morning because why you're
[41:05] gonna be making war against his against
[41:07] his kingdom
[41:09] amen
[41:11] you must know he's the devil and the
[41:14] same time that you recognize him and
[41:16] know that he's the devil that he is
[41:18] against you then then
[41:20] to overcome your rep you must recognize
[41:23] that the god in you is greater and
[41:26] mightier than the devil that is fighting
[41:29] against you
[41:30] that is the one that is so that you have
[41:34] already that already overcame for you
[41:37] and by his grace you're more than a
[41:39] match for him why you know sometimes you
[41:42] know you can uh
[41:44] paint a picture you know you you see the
[41:47] little the the the child of a lion you
[41:50] know is there and and then there's the
[41:51] enemy coming you know they pray trying
[41:53] to make him a prey and then he starts
[41:55] you know just train to her but it's just
[41:58] like a little a little a little little
[41:59] lion you know but then his dad is behind
[42:03] him
[42:05] then the enemy is like ah you know the
[42:07] enemy gets a scare and and he thinks
[42:10] that and then that little one he thinks
[42:12] that he's he's the one that overcame
[42:14] that enemy
[42:16] but then there was someone behind him
[42:18] that was overcoming that enemy and then
[42:21] sometimes that's that's the way we see
[42:23] ourselves you know we we we can see
[42:25] ourselves as very small but there is
[42:27] someone behind us
[42:29] amen there is someone that is kind of
[42:31] watching for you that when the enemy
[42:34] that's as the Bible says when the enemy
[42:35] comes against you like a flood the
[42:38] spirit of God will raise up a standard
[42:41] and what is that is that is the god that
[42:43] is living in you because as we say here
[42:46] greater is he that is seeing you than he
[42:49] that's in the world can you recognize
[42:51] that this morning that you're going
[42:53] through sickness you're going through
[42:54] family situations but you can say Lord
[42:57] greater you are that is living in me
[43:00] that no matter my circumstance you are
[43:03] the god that gave the promise you are
[43:05] the god that says you I am the god that
[43:08] healeth all your diseases
[43:12] can we recognize the promise because the
[43:15] god of your the sir the god of the
[43:17] promise is greater that the
[43:18] circumstances you may be facing this
[43:20] morning
[43:22] what can you be facing this morning that
[43:25] he God already he doesn't know it he
[43:28] knows everything
[43:30] and that's where the Christian Life is
[43:33] rest because now you can rest and you
[43:35] can say Lord You're greater I Surrender
[43:38] that's what we sung this morning I
[43:40] surrender all I surrender all my life
[43:42] Lord
[43:43] or who I am this morning I Surrender it
[43:46] to you
[43:47] amen
[43:49] then the prophet of God he's talking and
[43:52] I was reading listening reading a little
[43:54] bit of quote one of these quotes in the
[43:56] message how can I over hike how can I
[43:58] overcome and he's talking about that
[44:01] little one and again always that's why
[44:03] the Bible says that he has to be you
[44:04] have to be like a child to enter into
[44:06] the kingdom of God because sometimes
[44:08] he's like that little one he's trying to
[44:11] put on his coat and he's trying to make
[44:14] all the efforts to put on the code and
[44:16] then Mama comes and it's like let me
[44:18] help you he's like no I don't want you
[44:19] to help me because I want to put on the
[44:21] code and then he puts one one is live on
[44:23] one side and then it's all twists all
[44:25] all twisted or or not in the right place
[44:29] but then the mom is like if you just if
[44:32] you your surrender
[44:35] and then you'll know that that code is
[44:37] is faded for you
[44:39] and then I was like how do you surrender
[44:41] it's like when you just lift up your
[44:43] hands and say Lord put your the code of
[44:45] your word in my life amen and then as
[44:48] soon as that kid recognizes that that
[44:51] Mama or daddy is the one that is putting
[44:53] the clothes on him then he's gonna be
[44:55] able to lift up his hands remember
[44:57] lifting your hands is a sign of
[44:59] surrender so as soon as he recognizes
[45:02] that he needs to surrender then he just
[45:04] raises up his hands and then the code
[45:06] comes very easy
[45:09] and then the prophet of God says that's
[45:11] the victory that's overcoming the thing
[45:15] you have to overcome is yourself
[45:18] because we make many times oh you know
[45:20] my enemies here my enemies there the
[45:22] prophet of God says your greatest enemy
[45:25] is yourself
[45:27] it's this that is always fighting
[45:29] against what God has placed in your
[45:31] heart he says you have to overcome
[45:33] yourself you have to overcome your ideas
[45:35] you have to overcome your things and
[45:38] surrender yourself to Kim
[45:40] he overcame for you he knows the way we
[45:43] don't know the way that's why he says I
[45:46] am the truth I am the way I am the life
[45:49] if you recognize who is your opponent
[45:52] but also you recognize who your God is
[45:54] now you have life now you now you have
[45:57] the way and now you have the truth
[46:00] isn't that beautiful
[46:01] that you go and read the word and he's
[46:03] like Lord thank you for your word when I
[46:05] am in my lowest you can bring me for
[46:07] from from my lowest mountain in my
[46:10] lowest Valley Lord you can bring me from
[46:12] there and we were kind of hearing in
[46:15] church and I was meditating on this and
[46:18] it's not on my Note but let me tell you
[46:20] you know when you are going through a
[46:21] valley in your life many times we wanna
[46:24] you just want to have the Mountaintop
[46:26] experiences but you don't want to be in
[46:28] the valley
[46:30] why because in the valley is when it is
[46:32] your greatest trial it is your greater
[46:35] tribulation it is your greatest uh you
[46:37] know sometimes we get defeated in the
[46:40] valley but let me tell you something
[46:41] that it is only in the valley when
[46:44] you're able to produce the fruits
[46:46] you cannot produce the fruit up in the
[46:49] mountain that's what the prophet of God
[46:50] says you cannot produce the fruit in the
[46:52] mountain but why because in the mountain
[46:54] the fruit will freeze
[46:58] where do you have to produce the fruit
[47:00] when you are going through the valley
[47:01] but the Bible says even though I go
[47:04] through the valley of the shadow of
[47:06] death I will fear no evil
[47:08] why because you will be by my side you
[47:11] will be in front of me you will be
[47:13] behind me you will be protecting me Lord
[47:15] as I go through the valley
[47:18] amen isn't that good
[47:20] David was preaching was reading was
[47:23] writing about it he's like I'm going to
[47:25] ram Valley but it doesn't matter if I go
[47:27] through a valley because you will be
[47:29] with me
[47:30] and and now we have come to a different
[47:32] dispensation in in this last last age
[47:36] that is not God working with us now is
[47:39] God in you and that's why Paul writes in
[47:42] the people and he says Christ in you the
[47:45] hope of glory
[47:48] that's the need that's the reason why
[47:50] you're going through your Valley you say
[47:52] Lord if you're the hope of glory if you
[47:54] are the god of my salvation help me to
[47:57] go through my through my loss to to the
[48:00] loss of my child the loss of my wife the
[48:02] loss of my husband or the loss of my job
[48:05] or my marriage problems Lord help me to
[48:08] go through that Valley
[48:10] and he will help you
[48:12] because that's his promise I will never
[48:15] leave you I will not forsake you
[48:18] can we just think about it I will never
[48:20] leave you I will not forsake you if you
[48:24] feel forsaken don't feel forsaken no
[48:27] more because he says I will not leave
[48:29] him I will not forsake you
[48:32] amen
[48:34] but let me tell you something the
[48:36] prophet of God also tells you that the
[48:37] devil has a right to a final punch
[48:42] he says that in the message Christ is
[48:43] revealing his own word he says I was
[48:46] just he's giving an example he's like I
[48:48] was just talking to a young Minister and
[48:50] his wife in the room just a few moments
[48:52] ago and wolf both of them were them are
[48:56] nervous just like the rest of the world
[48:58] isn't that the conditions of the day
[49:00] everybody's nervous everybody's that
[49:02] they don't know where to go or like then
[49:04] they come to church or they don't come
[49:06] to church then they deny the existence
[49:09] of God and then when they are dying
[49:10] they're like oh I I need God
[49:13] everybody's nervous you know the rest of
[49:17] the human being on Earth he says I
[49:19] remember Satan the prophet of God says I
[49:21] remember now remember Satan got a Punch
[49:25] coming at you
[49:28] I don't care who you are
[49:30] I don't care if you're the most popular
[49:32] preacher in the message I don't care
[49:36] Satan has a right to get a punch at you
[49:41] but he he is he's the prophet of God
[49:43] says he's got a right to that one punch
[49:45] but which had you rather be that that
[49:48] punch be blind or be in in a tritic
[49:52] sitting in a chair or be nervous
[49:55] see the prophet of God says he got no
[49:58] he's gotten somewhere he can punch you
[50:03] he has a right for just one
[50:07] he he's got a right to that open place
[50:10] but then the prophet God that is he says
[50:13] that's the spot that you have to keep
[50:16] cover all the time that's the that's the
[50:19] spot that you have to be praying Lord
[50:20] these little thing here that that you
[50:23] know the as Paul says you know I have
[50:25] prayed for I have asked you Lord for
[50:27] three times to remove these these Thorn
[50:29] from My Flesh and the Lord says my grace
[50:32] is sufficient
[50:34] you see how can we overcome how what is
[50:37] the way of another corner by the word
[50:40] my grace is sufficient
[50:44] you know you have to be covered all the
[50:46] time
[50:47] and and then the prophet of God says you
[50:49] you you're gonna see a a an age that is
[50:52] always nervous about things and that's
[50:54] how the enemy you know a lot of people
[50:56] they have nervous or like breakdowns or
[50:59] they get burnt out why because it is a
[51:03] condition so those are the conditions of
[51:05] the day
[51:06] but guess what that's why you have to be
[51:08] praying you know the Bible that's why
[51:09] the Bible says that you have to be
[51:11] praying you have to be fast and you have
[51:12] to be reading your word you have to be
[51:14] coming to church you have to be around
[51:16] the correct the right Fellowship why
[51:18] because in in that way you're protecting
[51:20] yourself
[51:22] against the punch of the enemy because I
[51:25] said because your enemy knows you way
[51:28] better than you know yourself
[51:30] but God knows you better than that
[51:34] amen
[51:40] I can tell you the greater the weight
[51:43] the greater the trial the greater the
[51:46] victory
[51:48] how many can say Amen to that Lord I'm
[51:50] going through this but I'm being patient
[51:52] and I am praying and and the Lord says
[51:55] yeah because the greater the trial the
[51:57] greater the testimony is going to be the
[52:00] greater sorry the greater the trial the
[52:03] testimony is going to be even greater
[52:06] have you asked something to the Lord he
[52:08] hasn't given to you I I have asked
[52:10] something to the Lord he hasn't given it
[52:12] to us talking about my wife and I but we
[52:15] know we have a promise and let me tell
[52:17] you something the god that gave the
[52:19] promise he is faithful to fulfill his
[52:22] promise
[52:23] it doesn't matter how much you have to
[52:25] wait you know it doesn't matter how much
[52:27] you you have to pray he already gave the
[52:30] promise
[52:31] and if he gave the if he gave the
[52:33] promise he has to fulfill his promise
[52:37] because the Bible says that his promises
[52:40] are Jay and amen
[52:42] that's why when you read the scriptures
[52:44] read it with a different mindset that
[52:47] you say these are the promises every
[52:49] promise in the book is mine how many can
[52:52] say every promise in this book those
[52:56] promises are mine this morning Lord
[52:58] you are my peace you are my joy you are
[53:01] the the strength Giver Lord this morning
[53:04] if I feel weak you're gonna give me
[53:06] strength but also Paul says let the weak
[53:09] say I am strong let the poor say I am
[53:13] rich
[53:16] lay let the defeated said I am an
[53:19] overcomer this morning
[53:22] amen because we are coming to the
[53:24] congregation as the Bible Peter is
[53:26] writing he's like we're coming to the
[53:28] congregation of the firstborns
[53:31] and if you think about a firstborn what
[53:34] is a firstborn he's the one that has two
[53:37] the right to things the the firstborn
[53:39] the birthright and and to and to be the
[53:43] heir of everything as the firstborn
[53:45] and that's what the why Peter is saying
[53:48] we have come to the congregation of the
[53:50] firstborn the the the the the the the
[53:52] the the congregation of the ones that
[53:55] are Overcomers
[53:58] who are those this morning I am one of
[54:00] them
[54:08] and then in Luke chapter 4
[54:13] look at the first thing when when Jesus
[54:15] is coming here Luke Luke chapter 4 and
[54:18] then it says and Jesus being filled full
[54:20] of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan
[54:22] and was led by the spirit unto the
[54:24] Wilderness now look
[54:27] Jesus
[54:29] was baptized right and then the spirit
[54:32] the spirit of God left him
[54:35] to the wilderness
[54:38] and that's you know in in Denver it's
[54:40] second Luke chapter 4 the second verse
[54:43] it says and being 40 days tempted of the
[54:46] devil just think about 40 days
[54:50] being tempted
[54:52] of the devil
[54:54] and in those days he did eat nothing and
[54:57] when they were ended he afterwards
[54:59] hunger
[55:02] so if you think about this script
[55:04] scripture Jesus was tempted for 40 days
[55:06] until these three specific challenges
[55:10] and it makes us think many times that
[55:14] when we are tempted once and we can
[55:16] hardly overcome Temptation when you ever
[55:18] come just once when you are kind of
[55:20] tempted once and you're not able to
[55:22] overcome now think about Jesus 40 days
[55:26] from the time he will wake up until the
[55:28] time that we he will go to sleep or even
[55:32] even in in his sleep the enemy was
[55:34] tempting him
[55:36] was kind of with all sort of you know
[55:38] what you are going through right now he
[55:40] went through that
[55:41] and and if you're if you if you think
[55:43] about and the number 40 in the numeral
[55:46] in the numerology of God it is a number
[55:49] of judgment
[55:51] so in other words all your Temptations
[55:55] everything that you may be going through
[55:57] right now it is already judged
[56:00] in Christ
[56:03] amen that's why he had to go 40 days why
[56:07] because he wanted to prove everything
[56:09] needed to be perfect according to the
[56:11] scriptures because where is this number
[56:13] coming from remember when uh
[56:16] um during the flood it was 40 days and
[56:19] 40 nights that that kind of the rain was
[56:22] coming right because during that time
[56:24] then after that they have to stay in the
[56:27] art for I think was like 300 like for a
[56:29] year in the ark but rain was coming for
[56:31] those 40 days if I'm not mistaken so
[56:34] that's where this number 40 is coming
[56:37] why because God was judging the Earth
[56:40] in the Old Testament and then Christ was
[56:43] a fulfillment of all the scriptures and
[56:46] guess who Jesus was maybe we can say
[56:48] during those 40 days he was going
[56:51] through through that flood but then
[56:53] after that he was able to be judged and
[56:55] he was the ark
[56:58] wasn't Jesus the ark yes
[57:01] amen
[57:03] amen
[57:05] but we can say you know that we're glad
[57:08] that he was tempted in no ways but yet
[57:11] without sin
[57:14] they they but now now think about this
[57:16] the enemy will always come and challenge
[57:18] you or temp you tempt you in areas of
[57:21] your life when you are tired
[57:25] when you are hungry when you feel
[57:27] defeated when you are sad
[57:30] why because that's where the enemy can
[57:33] deal with your emotions
[57:35] amen
[57:37] how many people have we heard that said
[57:39] that you know that when they were sad or
[57:41] when they were angry they just pull out
[57:43] the gun and either they committed a
[57:45] murder or they committed suicide
[57:48] why because their emotions were so high
[57:51] amen
[57:53] and in ways that it is because they gave
[57:55] their enemy an opportunity to work
[57:57] through them
[57:59] amen
[58:00] but look before Jesus was tempted and
[58:03] this is the key
[58:05] he was filled
[58:07] with the Holy Ghost
[58:09] and that was the only way he could
[58:12] overcome his enemy
[58:14] amen Jesus was a man yet he was a God
[58:17] but he needed to be adopted after he was
[58:21] baptized he needed to be adopted and
[58:23] that's why when uh John said I saw a
[58:26] spirit like a dove coming in and going
[58:30] to him that was that was his adoption so
[58:32] he needed to receive the holy spirit so
[58:34] then that he could go to the Wilderness
[58:36] and then be tempted in the wilderness
[58:39] and he was going to be an overcomer in
[58:40] the wilderness
[58:42] so that's why that's why the pastors the
[58:46] ministers is always stressing the
[58:48] importance of receiving the Holy Spirit
[58:52] same thing for you and me you have to be
[58:54] filled with the Holy Spirit to be able
[58:57] to overcome the enemy
[58:59] as Paul says you know Paul he's writing
[59:02] you know I Die daily in other words he's
[59:05] like Lord I ask for you refilling every
[59:09] single day
[59:10] you know you have to have that oil in
[59:13] your life if not you're gonna perish
[59:16] amen you have to be filled with the Holy
[59:18] Spirit and then you just think about
[59:20] your body your soul and your spirit God
[59:22] made us try and uh beings amen he made
[59:26] her body he made our spirit he made our
[59:29] soul
[59:30] and all of that all of these they have
[59:33] senses in your life but all of them they
[59:36] have to be controlled by the Holy Spirit
[59:39] amen and it is worthy because without
[59:43] the holy spirit is then the enemies when
[59:46] he gets a hell of us and he makes us
[59:48] fall
[59:49] or we choose to fall
[59:53] because the Lord gives us that
[59:54] opportunity you you are given the
[59:56] opportunity to choose whether or not you
[59:59] want to be in church whether whether or
[1:00:01] not you you will not serve the Lord you
[1:00:03] know that's the the free moral agency
[1:00:05] amen
[1:00:12] I'm trying to build something so please
[1:00:14] bear with me here for a few minutes
[1:00:17] and it says our body has five senses you
[1:00:20] know your sight your hearing your smell
[1:00:23] your taste and what you thought
[1:00:26] your spirit has five senses your memory
[1:00:29] your imagination your conscience your
[1:00:32] affections and your reasoning
[1:00:35] and then your soul has either one or the
[1:00:37] other it either has Faith or the Holy
[1:00:40] Spirit living in there or it has doubt
[1:00:43] amen
[1:00:44] but you just think about this when we
[1:00:46] thought when we when we speak about the
[1:00:48] spirit you know the imaginations memory
[1:00:51] how many times you know if you were in
[1:00:53] the world or then you gave your your
[1:00:56] life to the Lord then how many times is
[1:00:59] the enemy coming and trying to attack
[1:01:02] and bring to memory the things that
[1:01:05] happening in the past
[1:01:08] how many times why is that because he
[1:01:11] knows you know remember the testimony
[1:01:13] that brother random says about sister
[1:01:15] Nellie Sanders you know she had received
[1:01:18] from something from the Lord but then
[1:01:20] she started reasoning With the Enemy
[1:01:22] that's what we're talking about one of
[1:01:24] those Spirit spiritual senses is
[1:01:27] reasoning she started reasoning With the
[1:01:29] Enemy when she was passing by the
[1:01:30] ballroom and she was like you know what
[1:01:32] ah I may just go in and I'm just gonna
[1:01:36] hear the music I'm not gonna do anything
[1:01:39] that was the greatest mistake why
[1:01:41] because she started reasoning this
[1:01:43] Spirit hero Spirit was reasoning to
[1:01:45] something that she had already been
[1:01:47] delivered from
[1:01:48] or that was hidden in her life that near
[1:01:51] needed Deliverance
[1:01:54] so then she goes there and then she
[1:01:56] finds him she finds herself in the
[1:01:58] middle of the ballroom listening to the
[1:02:01] music and then she started she started
[1:02:02] dancing there and then she comes running
[1:02:04] to the prophet and says you know I don't
[1:02:07] know what happened then I can say maybe
[1:02:09] the prophet didn't say it but I can say
[1:02:11] it it's because you started reasoning
[1:02:12] with something that you were dealing
[1:02:15] with
[1:02:16] or because or maybe
[1:02:18] perhaps you were doing something or you
[1:02:23] should have confessed something that
[1:02:24] that you that you haven't confessed
[1:02:27] and that's why that thing was kind of
[1:02:28] following after you
[1:02:30] and then but you know the prophet of God
[1:02:32] pray for her and then she was delivered
[1:02:34] right but what is this we need the Holy
[1:02:38] Spirit In Our Lives to be able to
[1:02:40] control our bodies our souls in our
[1:02:44] experience to be able to control your
[1:02:46] memory your imaginations your conscious
[1:02:48] your affections and your reasoning
[1:02:51] but now look in this first challenge
[1:02:55] the enemy and and that's why you know
[1:02:57] the Bible says also in the book of
[1:02:59] Hebrews he says that he was tempted in
[1:03:01] all things yet without sin
[1:03:04] that's our promise amen it says in the
[1:03:06] in the first challenge the enemy came in
[1:03:09] in
[1:03:09] you know the Bible when the Bible is
[1:03:13] written is very specific so you can
[1:03:16] um
[1:03:20] the Bible is very specific so you you
[1:03:22] can kind of uh how do you say like um
[1:03:25] I forgot the word anyway so that you can
[1:03:27] uh
[1:03:29] familiar no not familiarize but like
[1:03:32] that you can
[1:03:33] um I don't know I don't even have to
[1:03:35] wear any Spanish
[1:03:39] we're getting old I guess
[1:03:45] you know
[1:03:47] the Bible is written in I'm just gonna
[1:03:49] go ahead okay but you know when when
[1:03:52] we're really here the Bible tells us
[1:03:54] that he was hungry why because the Bible
[1:03:57] is specific so that we can refer back
[1:03:59] and say you know what if Jesus was
[1:04:00] hungry was hungry I can be hungry as
[1:04:02] well you know and if Jesus was sad when
[1:04:06] he cried then I can cry
[1:04:08] amen because sometimes we hear you know
[1:04:10] and that's why when brother Branham will
[1:04:12] preach to the Pentecostal congregations
[1:04:14] he will tell them you know it's good to
[1:04:16] be always you know on fire but also you
[1:04:18] have to recognize where you find
[1:04:20] yourself so then you can be delivered
[1:04:22] from that
[1:04:24] amen because you if you think about many
[1:04:26] of of the preachers at the time when
[1:04:28] brother random was around a a Alan like
[1:04:31] all of them were fire preachers but how
[1:04:34] they end it is because there were things
[1:04:36] that were never fixed
[1:04:40] so now
[1:04:42] God or Jesus being in a human form he
[1:04:46] was hungry
[1:04:47] just think about it without eating for
[1:04:50] 40 days
[1:04:52] if you're if you don't need one day then
[1:04:54] then you feel hungry just think about
[1:04:55] now for 40 days and then every single
[1:04:59] day the enemy will come with one thing
[1:05:00] then the enemy will come with another
[1:05:02] thing
[1:05:06] but the that was and then there was a
[1:05:09] time for him to eat but not when the
[1:05:11] enemy wanted Kim to it
[1:05:13] right because the enemy came in the
[1:05:15] exact time when the scripture says and
[1:05:18] after 40 days he was hungry right but
[1:05:21] when he he wanted to and you know and
[1:05:24] one thing that we can say you have been
[1:05:26] you have to you have been called today
[1:05:29] to control things
[1:05:32] through the Holy Spirit you have been
[1:05:34] called to control things and you are not
[1:05:36] called to letting things control you
[1:05:39] and that's what Jesus was doing here he
[1:05:42] was not gonna yield to the enemy and say
[1:05:44] yeah I'm hungry yeah I can turn this
[1:05:47] these these stones into bread no he was
[1:05:50] like not not and he's in the the the
[1:05:53] devil said unto him if thou be the Son
[1:05:56] of God command this stone that either
[1:05:58] Made bread and Jesus answered him saying
[1:06:00] it is written that men shall not live by
[1:06:03] bread alone but by every word of God
[1:06:08] in other words there was something
[1:06:10] greater than a physical food there was
[1:06:13] something greater that was living in
[1:06:15] Jesus that could overcome the enemy and
[1:06:19] that was the word
[1:06:20] that's the answer when the enemy is
[1:06:23] coming against you that's how you have
[1:06:25] to respond certainly you have to
[1:06:27] recognize your condition in order for
[1:06:30] you to be the leader from something
[1:06:32] because if you don't recognize your
[1:06:34] condition then you're gonna be in the
[1:06:36] second same condition you can be praying
[1:06:38] over and over and over and over again
[1:06:40] but if you don't want to let go of that
[1:06:43] condition because the the prophet of God
[1:06:45] also told us that there is power in
[1:06:48] confession
[1:06:51] and if the arrival the Bible also says
[1:06:54] that we have to confess our faults one
[1:06:56] to another what does that mean when you
[1:06:58] confess you're exposing your enemy
[1:07:01] I have done that it works
[1:07:05] amen God has always equipped equipped us
[1:07:09] with something that will always defeat
[1:07:11] the enemy and that is God's word
[1:07:14] how many be left out this morning it is
[1:07:16] the word of God that is going to defeat
[1:07:19] the enemy amen the prophet of God says
[1:07:21] never use any power at all talking about
[1:07:24] Jesus bringing every divine blessing
[1:07:27] down to the reach of the homeless and
[1:07:29] weakest of Christians as long as you
[1:07:32] believe that's the word of God
[1:07:35] and it says it is written the word of
[1:07:37] God will defeat Satan anywhere
[1:07:41] anytime and on any condition or under
[1:07:45] any circumstances that is the word of
[1:07:49] God
[1:07:52] that is the only thing that can overcome
[1:07:54] the enemy that is the word of God
[1:07:57] if you can take something out of this
[1:08:00] sermon this morning is the word of God
[1:08:02] will defeat the enemy under any time
[1:08:04] under any circumstances Lord because
[1:08:07] your word will never fail the word of a
[1:08:11] man will fail certainly we are humans
[1:08:13] amen but the word of God will never fail
[1:08:19] and now coming back to this thought that
[1:08:22] you have been called to control things
[1:08:24] you have been called to master all
[1:08:27] circumstances why the prophet of God
[1:08:29] also tells us that Faith Masters all the
[1:08:32] circumstances but we are not gonna We're
[1:08:35] not gonna let our circumstances to
[1:08:37] master us why because as I was saying
[1:08:40] God is greater than my circumstance
[1:08:44] and now the prophet of God says here now
[1:08:47] listen listen to this closely I love
[1:08:49] when the prophet of God says closely
[1:08:52] what does that mean pay attention
[1:08:55] because I'm going to say something that
[1:08:56] may help you
[1:08:58] then he says any Divine promise of God
[1:09:02] it says the right mental attitude
[1:09:05] towards any Divine promise of God will
[1:09:09] bring it to pass
[1:09:12] if you can look at it right and believe
[1:09:15] it in that way that it is written God
[1:09:18] said God and you say God it is your word
[1:09:21] and take the right mental attitude
[1:09:24] towards that Divine promise he will
[1:09:26] bring it to pass because there is not
[1:09:29] defeat
[1:09:31] faith cannot be defeated
[1:09:34] amen there there is no defeat to Faith
[1:09:37] watch the ministry of our Lord he did
[1:09:40] not claim to be a great person he come
[1:09:43] by the way of a stable door he went out
[1:09:46] the way of capital punishment but he
[1:09:48] owned about one maybe one garment in his
[1:09:51] lifetime he never have a place to lay
[1:09:53] his hand he never went very far he
[1:09:56] traveled along uh humbly live among the
[1:09:59] peasants
[1:10:00] he spoke a very common language he was
[1:10:03] not a great person or claimed to be but
[1:10:05] the Bible says he took on himself of no
[1:10:08] reputation he made himself of not a
[1:10:10] reputation
[1:10:12] in other words he was bringing
[1:10:14] everything to pass through his attitude
[1:10:18] he always was saying always was saying
[1:10:20] you know I do nothing until I hear or I
[1:10:24] see the father to tell me to do
[1:10:26] something
[1:10:27] and that was the same the same with the
[1:10:29] ministry of the Prophet you know he will
[1:10:31] I need to wait for a vision I need to
[1:10:34] wait for Dasa the Lord so then I can say
[1:10:36] something
[1:10:37] and that's the same for us today until
[1:10:39] you hear from the Lord just keep praying
[1:10:42] keep pressing and as we read here keep
[1:10:44] having the right mental attitude towards
[1:10:47] the word of God
[1:10:49] because that's what happened with a lot
[1:10:51] of people that they get discouraged
[1:10:52] because you know they pray once or they
[1:10:54] made a five-minute prayer and they think
[1:10:57] that the Lord is going to answer their
[1:10:58] prayer
[1:10:59] no you have to yield you have to
[1:11:01] surrender you have to say Lord I
[1:11:04] surrender all I surrender my my thought
[1:11:07] life I Surrender my my body to you Lord
[1:11:12] use me help me
[1:11:14] but it has to be a real surrender
[1:11:17] a right attitude the right because why
[1:11:20] is brother when I'm saying mental
[1:11:21] attitude
[1:11:23] he's not talking about your soul
[1:11:25] he's talking about your spirit that you
[1:11:28] have to have the right mental attitude
[1:11:32] I've been thinking you know seeing some
[1:11:34] people that serve the Lord and then they
[1:11:37] come to church and then they leave and
[1:11:38] then they come back you know why why
[1:11:40] what is that it is because it is a
[1:11:44] choice
[1:11:45] it is a choice that you make as as we
[1:11:48] when we started this this this morning
[1:11:50] as I said it is a choice when you come
[1:11:52] here you bring a Living Sacrifice why
[1:11:55] because you are having the right mental
[1:11:57] attitude towards the word of God and you
[1:12:00] want and you want the Lord to uh to
[1:12:02] speak to you this morning and then
[1:12:04] you're coming with your little fire and
[1:12:07] then you're saying Lord I'm bringing my
[1:12:09] little fire and then the other per the
[1:12:10] other your brother your sister is
[1:12:12] bringing the same thing you're having
[1:12:13] the right attitude because when you have
[1:12:16] the right attitude the word of God will
[1:12:18] bring you to pass whatever your need is
[1:12:21] this morning he will bring the answer to
[1:12:24] you
[1:12:25] and sometimes you know like we are like
[1:12:28] but we I am asking Lord for these that
[1:12:30] and the other but let me tell you is
[1:12:32] better when you come with the right
[1:12:33] mental attitude to God that he even
[1:12:36] tells you no and you're gonna be happy
[1:12:41] isn't that the truth
[1:12:46] all or I want this better house where I
[1:12:49] want this other car or I want this other
[1:12:52] job but then he's like what are you
[1:12:54] going to be using that for
[1:12:56] had the right mental attitude where you
[1:12:59] can say Lord if you give it to me praise
[1:13:00] the Lord I'm gonna I'm gonna use it for
[1:13:02] your kingdom
[1:13:03] but having the right attitude is a
[1:13:07] choice
[1:13:08] you are given a choice remember Calum
[1:13:11] Adam in in
[1:13:13] um sorry Cain and Abel they had a choice
[1:13:18] Cain was even given the option you know
[1:13:20] he was seeing how his brother was
[1:13:22] offering a sacrifice and he was given
[1:13:25] the same option you know you can bring
[1:13:28] the same sacrifice that it is not
[1:13:30] through a fruit of the Earth but he's
[1:13:32] through the blood that you can be that
[1:13:34] you can be redeemed he was given the
[1:13:36] same option
[1:13:38] he didn't want to take it but Abel took
[1:13:41] the right the right approach to the word
[1:13:43] of God it was a choice
[1:13:45] so it is your choice today to be an
[1:13:47] overcomer or to live a defeated life
[1:13:52] that was the first challenge it was
[1:13:54] coming through the lust of the flesh you
[1:13:57] know Jesus was hungry in in in Denver he
[1:14:00] replied with the word amen now the
[1:14:02] Second Challenge it was the last of the
[1:14:05] eye and he goes in Luke chapter 4 verse
[1:14:07] 5 and it says the devil taking him up to
[1:14:10] taking him up to into high mountains so
[1:14:14] he look how the enemy is coming first is
[1:14:16] it comes through the wilderness
[1:14:18] and then he now is bringing him to a
[1:14:20] high mountain
[1:14:22] why because your Temptations as your
[1:14:25] yielding and as you're surrendering your
[1:14:27] life to him to Christ the enemy is going
[1:14:30] to bring a higher one but guess what the
[1:14:33] word of God is greater than that
[1:14:36] so first brought him to the Wilderness
[1:14:39] and now he's bringing Jesus to a high
[1:14:41] mountain
[1:14:42] and he shows unto him all the kingdoms
[1:14:45] of the world in a moment of time and the
[1:14:48] devil said unto him all this power will
[1:14:51] I give thee and the glory of them for
[1:14:54] that is deliver unto me and to whosoever
[1:14:56] I will give it
[1:14:59] if thou therefore will worship me
[1:15:01] that sounds beautiful
[1:15:04] and remember why because
[1:15:06] Satan was the one that was leading
[1:15:09] Worship in heaven
[1:15:11] you guys remember that and now he was
[1:15:14] trying to bring the same worship down in
[1:15:16] Earth with Jesus and he was like you
[1:15:17] know what if you worship me he if you
[1:15:20] sing to me I will give you the kingdoms
[1:15:22] of the Earth
[1:15:24] in Jesus answer and said unto him get
[1:15:27] thee behind me Satan for it is written
[1:15:29] Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and
[1:15:32] him only shall thou serve
[1:15:35] the first was not not only the men shall
[1:15:39] not live by bread alone but by every
[1:15:41] word that comes from the mouth of God
[1:15:44] and now it's it's saying like thou shall
[1:15:46] Worship the Lord thy God in other words
[1:15:48] he's even destroying the doctrine of
[1:15:50] Trinity here he's like there is only one
[1:15:52] God and you have to worship that one guy
[1:15:56] what was the Second Challenge it was
[1:15:58] about power
[1:15:59] it was about Authority because it was
[1:16:03] about worshiping something
[1:16:05] and we know about the scriptures if you
[1:16:08] think about the word worship we always
[1:16:10] think that is raising our hands or
[1:16:12] singing or uh you know having a worse
[1:16:16] like a regular song service but we can
[1:16:20] say that that is the result of worship
[1:16:23] what is worship worship is about
[1:16:25] submission
[1:16:28] what is this as the enemy is telling
[1:16:30] Jesus I can give them to you but you
[1:16:33] have to worship me or submit yourself
[1:16:37] to me
[1:16:39] the first one was about bread the second
[1:16:41] one was about worship was about
[1:16:43] submission you submit yourself to me and
[1:16:46] I will give you the kingdoms of the
[1:16:48] Earth
[1:16:50] and that's what the enemy wants from us
[1:16:53] every day I can give you more popularity
[1:16:56] I can give you more more money more more
[1:16:59] more things that you get busy with that
[1:17:01] you don't have time to read your Bible
[1:17:03] that you don't have time to come to
[1:17:05] church I can give you all of that if you
[1:17:07] just worship me
[1:17:10] he wants you to submit yourself to
[1:17:13] Satan's bondage because that what that
[1:17:16] is the results of his worship amen he
[1:17:20] gives depression God does God is not the
[1:17:22] author of depression he gives anxiety he
[1:17:25] gains loneliness sadness bitterness
[1:17:28] those are the fruits of the flesh
[1:17:30] amen but if you read in the book of
[1:17:32] Galatians it is just think about it the
[1:17:36] fruits of the spirit
[1:17:37] is Joy love amen Temperance all of that
[1:17:42] those are the fruits of the spirit
[1:17:44] not the fruits of the flesh
[1:17:46] but when we submit ourselves to the
[1:17:49] right Kingdom as Jesus said that there
[1:17:51] was a kingdom coming and you know
[1:17:54] because when the enemy was coming
[1:17:56] against Jesus
[1:17:57] he he didn't know even who Jesus was
[1:18:01] do you do you know that he didn't know
[1:18:03] who Jesus was because he was kind of
[1:18:05] testing he was testing and see what he
[1:18:08] was going to be responding to because
[1:18:10] then if thou be the Son of God you know
[1:18:13] commend these stones and and and and or
[1:18:16] even at the cross if you're the Son of
[1:18:18] God now the uh called your Angels or
[1:18:21] like he didn't know until after he died
[1:18:26] because when he died he thought that he
[1:18:28] already uh defeated God's Kingdom
[1:18:31] but but it was what a great mistake he
[1:18:34] made
[1:18:35] because that's why the prophet God we
[1:18:37] were we were saying here he came in such
[1:18:40] a humble way that he was God hiding
[1:18:43] himself in Simplicity he was God hiding
[1:18:46] himself and then when he comes and now
[1:18:49] we we see here he's like I will give you
[1:18:51] all the kingdoms what Jesus knew all the
[1:18:54] kingdoms of the earth they are mine but
[1:18:57] it's not the time yet
[1:18:59] amen
[1:19:01] and he was then Jesus was saying you
[1:19:04] know there was a kingdom that is coming
[1:19:06] and he also said that there is like the
[1:19:08] kingdom of God is Among Us
[1:19:11] what was he referring to he was
[1:19:12] referring about the holy spirit that was
[1:19:14] among them and who was that the horse
[1:19:16] Jesus walking among them
[1:19:18] because those in the Bible says in the
[1:19:20] beginning the spirit of God was moving
[1:19:22] upon the waters and then when they were
[1:19:26] kind of afraid in there in in the little
[1:19:29] boat who was moving upon the waters
[1:19:33] it was Jesus moving upon the waters so
[1:19:35] it was the spirit of God moving among
[1:19:38] them there was the kingdom of God moving
[1:19:40] among them
[1:19:43] amen and he was referring about the holy
[1:19:46] spirit that can live in the heart of a
[1:19:49] person that they control that Holy
[1:19:51] Spirit had controlled power that can
[1:19:54] control your body your spirit in your
[1:19:56] soul
[1:19:57] that when you make a mistake you made a
[1:19:59] right right away there's conviction in
[1:20:02] your heart there is no condemnation that
[1:20:03] as the Bible says that those that are
[1:20:05] walking according to the spirit not
[1:20:06] according to the flesh
[1:20:08] there is not condemnation for you this
[1:20:10] morning there is conviction in your
[1:20:12] heart when you do something wrong or
[1:20:13] even like a a an evil thought come
[1:20:15] through your mind you're like Lord I
[1:20:18] Repent what is that because the holy
[1:20:20] spirit is bringing conviction to your
[1:20:22] life
[1:20:22] and this is something that the enemy
[1:20:25] wanted to take away from you
[1:20:27] because what if Jesus would have yield
[1:20:29] to this we will be here maybe but we
[1:20:32] wouldn't be Overcomers
[1:20:35] or we may not be here
[1:20:38] amen
[1:20:40] what can submission bring it will it
[1:20:44] will always bring good things because
[1:20:46] even when we pray and we don't get what
[1:20:48] we desire but as we are submitted to him
[1:20:50] we will be content with their results
[1:20:54] and you say Amen to that
[1:21:02] would you like to give God control
[1:21:06] everything would you like to even
[1:21:08] control in your life of everything that
[1:21:10] you are disappointing would like to say
[1:21:12] Lord
[1:21:13] I surrender as we said but in this
[1:21:16] mountain that he was going he remember
[1:21:19] Wilderness and now the high mountain
[1:21:22] but now there is a third challenge
[1:21:25] and it is the pride of life
[1:21:28] the verse 9 of Luke chapter four it says
[1:21:32] and he brought him to Jerusalem and he
[1:21:35] set him on a pinnacle of the Temple
[1:21:38] now
[1:21:39] it was the Wilderness now the mountain
[1:21:42] now he brings him to a religious
[1:21:44] atmosphere
[1:21:47] and it said unto him if thou be the Son
[1:21:50] of God cast thyself down from hands and
[1:21:53] then he's gonna quote the word
[1:21:55] for it is written he shall give his
[1:21:58] angels charge over thee to keep thee
[1:22:01] and in their hands they shall bear thee
[1:22:03] up list lest at any time that thou Dash
[1:22:07] thy foot against a stone in other words
[1:22:10] he's quoting the word
[1:22:12] go back and think what happened in
[1:22:14] Genesis 3 it was the same thing the
[1:22:18] enemy quoting the word to Eve and then
[1:22:21] he says Thou shalt not Thou shalt not
[1:22:23] die but God knows that you will know how
[1:22:26] to uh discern from Good and Evil
[1:22:30] and she partook of that fruit
[1:22:33] but Jesus
[1:22:36] he didn't partake of that fruit and let
[1:22:39] me tell you something if the first Adam
[1:22:41] and the first Eve they fail there was a
[1:22:45] second Adam that was coming and there
[1:22:47] was a second Eve that was coming
[1:22:50] the first Adam the first Eve failed but
[1:22:53] the second Adam couldn't fail
[1:22:56] and then if you've seen this scripture
[1:22:58] it says now he he brings him to the
[1:23:02] temple and he's bringing the word and
[1:23:04] he's with that same word that he
[1:23:06] overcame the enemy and and he said look
[1:23:09] when and when the enemy cannot get you
[1:23:12] through your feelings you know because
[1:23:13] he started with the feelings how you
[1:23:15] feel you feel hungry you eat
[1:23:17] turn these stones to bread and you're
[1:23:19] gonna eat
[1:23:20] and if he cannot get you to your
[1:23:22] submission
[1:23:23] through your worship
[1:23:25] he will try to get you by using God's
[1:23:29] word
[1:23:31] but he won't use the fullness of the god
[1:23:33] of God's word
[1:23:35] he will use God's word partially so that
[1:23:39] he can bring confusion to your life
[1:23:42] because that's what happened in the
[1:23:43] beginning and that is he was testing and
[1:23:46] see if he can try to do the same thing
[1:23:49] with Jesus he's here what he quoted and
[1:23:52] now and now look he he here what he
[1:23:55] quoted sounded very good you know that
[1:23:59] he will send his angels and then if you
[1:24:01] fall you're in the angels are gonna pick
[1:24:03] you up and it's beautiful
[1:24:06] but then it says but he didn't he he did
[1:24:10] in this third challenge
[1:24:13] he's quoting a scripture from Psalms 91
[1:24:16] right Psalms 91 chapter 11 chapter 12.
[1:24:20] verse 11 and verse 12 but the enemy
[1:24:24] didn't quote the rest of the chapter
[1:24:27] why because he was already pronouncing
[1:24:29] his judgment
[1:24:31] why because in Psalms 91 13 in the
[1:24:34] Amplified version it says you shall
[1:24:36] tread upon the lion in The utter the
[1:24:39] Young Lion and the serpent shall you
[1:24:40] trample under your foot
[1:24:43] so in other words the Judgment was in
[1:24:46] the next verse but he didn't want to
[1:24:48] quote it because he was just saying the
[1:24:49] angels are going to come and get you but
[1:24:51] then in Psalms 91 that's the protection
[1:24:53] for the believer that when the enemy is
[1:24:55] coming against you he you're gonna be
[1:24:57] able to stand and you're going to be
[1:24:59] able to trample over your fears over
[1:25:02] your your your your family family
[1:25:04] history amen you're gonna be able to
[1:25:06] stand on that
[1:25:09] and when people is doubting that it will
[1:25:11] always be because they cannot see God's
[1:25:13] word because the the word of God he
[1:25:16] always bring guidance to our lives amen
[1:25:18] so now in this third challenge it was a
[1:25:21] religious confusion he was Now using the
[1:25:24] word of God
[1:25:25] to say you know what he was quoting the
[1:25:28] scripture
[1:25:29] in Jesus verse 12 it says in Jesus
[1:25:32] answering and said unto him it is said
[1:25:34] it is said Thou shalt not them the Lord
[1:25:36] thy God now he's opening a different
[1:25:38] dispensation to tell him I am God
[1:25:42] look what it says thou shall not tempt
[1:25:45] the Lord thy God and when the the devil
[1:25:48] had ended all the Temptation it says oh
[1:25:53] all the Temptation he departed from him
[1:25:57] for a season
[1:26:00] 40 days plus three days 43 43 days there
[1:26:04] day and night and he was able to defeat
[1:26:08] the enemy with the word
[1:26:11] in Jesus return but look after what
[1:26:14] happened after here he returned in the
[1:26:16] power of the spirit into Galilee in
[1:26:20] other words after you overcome
[1:26:22] Temptation after all the challenges he
[1:26:24] faced there was a victory as you can see
[1:26:27] there was power of the spirit that
[1:26:29] brought him to Galilee after which we
[1:26:31] Face challenges in our lives when the
[1:26:35] challenge is over and we won through
[1:26:37] Jesus Christ we get more power of the
[1:26:39] spirit
[1:26:40] isn't it something after you go through
[1:26:42] a trial that then now you look back and
[1:26:45] you say Lord all through this time you
[1:26:47] were with me and I'm rejoicing and then
[1:26:50] there is more power that you you get it
[1:26:52] stronger and it's stronger why because
[1:26:54] you were able to overcome your trial
[1:26:57] your Temptation amen
[1:27:00] every service we attend every time we
[1:27:02] come to church the Lord is preparing us
[1:27:05] as we read in the as we as we can read
[1:27:07] in descriptions in the scripture sorry
[1:27:09] the Bible says that we are not ignorant
[1:27:12] of the devil's devices of his devices
[1:27:15] the enemy can take advantage of us if we
[1:27:19] are ignorant amen but we can be grateful
[1:27:21] that the Lord has not ignorant anymore
[1:27:24] because we know the enemy's devices we
[1:27:27] know that's what I'm saying we know that
[1:27:30] the enemy if he cannot attack me through
[1:27:32] my feelings he's going to attack me
[1:27:34] through my worship to the Lord if not
[1:27:36] he's gonna try to bring confusion using
[1:27:38] the word of God
[1:27:40] now we are no longer ignorance of the
[1:27:44] devil's devices now we can be over
[1:27:46] commerce by the word and now that's what
[1:27:49] you have to be immerse yourself in the
[1:27:52] word so that when the enemy is coming
[1:27:54] against you now you can quote back the
[1:27:56] word
[1:27:57] amen you can say you you know he is my
[1:28:00] God you are a defeated devil I know the
[1:28:02] end of the book and in the end at the
[1:28:04] end of the book it says that I am an
[1:28:06] overcomer and he says that you that
[1:28:08] there is a hell and that is prepared for
[1:28:10] you and your angels and after that there
[1:28:13] is no there is no more life for you
[1:28:16] but you have to read the book you have
[1:28:18] to be in you have to go there in the
[1:28:20] book amen
[1:28:22] and now you know
[1:28:23] laughs
[1:28:26] and as we are dead in Christ and we are
[1:28:29] Abraham's seed and we are more than
[1:28:30] conquerors through him who conquer
[1:28:33] everything for us Jesus conquer
[1:28:36] everything for us no reason for us to
[1:28:38] have to overcome anything because it is
[1:28:40] already conquered
[1:28:42] everything is already conquered that's
[1:28:44] what I'm saying that's what he was
[1:28:46] saying that he was sent to All The
[1:28:48] Temptations where Jesus went through all
[1:28:50] of those Temptations so that if you can
[1:28:53] go through something like that he cannot
[1:28:55] be he he's the high priest that can be
[1:28:58] touched by the feeling of our
[1:29:00] infirmities because he already went
[1:29:02] through all of them
[1:29:04] but he was not defeated
[1:29:06] so if you go through something today you
[1:29:09] won't be defeated and if even if you
[1:29:11] have to die there is a greater Victory
[1:29:13] because remember that death is only the
[1:29:16] the the vehicle that is taking you to
[1:29:19] the other side
[1:29:21] who is the victor
[1:29:24] who is the victim the enemy is the
[1:29:26] victim and we are the victors tonight
[1:29:28] today amen the prophet of God says The
[1:29:31] Last Enemy sickness death temptation all
[1:29:34] things are put under your feet how many
[1:29:37] can say oh my Temptations everything is
[1:29:39] put under my feet
[1:29:42] and we are the Seed of Abraham being
[1:29:44] dead in Christ we are Abraham's seed
[1:29:46] marching onto Victory to Victory to
[1:29:49] Victory to Victory
[1:29:50] how many can say this morning I have the
[1:29:53] victory Jesus Christ
[1:29:55] I am holding God's promise out before me
[1:29:58] and I am marching on I am not marching
[1:30:01] backwards you know like that little guy
[1:30:02] that was pla that was sounding the
[1:30:04] trumpet when they when they when they
[1:30:06] when that Army was fighting he was like
[1:30:09] when when they they asked him please
[1:30:11] play the song to go back and he just
[1:30:13] play was playing the song to go forward
[1:30:15] go forward until they were able to
[1:30:17] defeat the enemy and then after that
[1:30:19] they ask him how or why you didn't they
[1:30:22] played you didn't you didn't sound it or
[1:30:24] play the song to go backwards he's like
[1:30:26] because I didn't know it
[1:30:29] amen so what can we say today you know I
[1:30:33] don't know the song to go backwards I am
[1:30:35] not I am not a person that is going to
[1:30:37] be leaving this building defeated I am a
[1:30:40] person that is going to be living this
[1:30:41] field building Victorious because I know
[1:30:44] that he already defeated my enemies for
[1:30:47] me
[1:30:48] and the only song I know is I'm going
[1:30:51] forward I'm going all the way with the
[1:30:54] Lord amen
[1:30:55] your seed will possess the gates of your
[1:30:58] enemy it is not an option when as we
[1:31:00] read at the beginning
[1:31:02] Abraham was given a promise and it was
[1:31:04] said it said your your seed will possess
[1:31:08] what does this mean your seed will
[1:31:10] possess it is not a it is not an option

[1:32:36] picked it up in the sky and changes the
[1:32:38] Battleground

[1:32:41] and then it releases the snake into the
[1:32:44] sky

[1:32:52] it is useless it is weak and is
[1:32:54] vulnerable unlike onto the ground when
[1:32:57] where it is powerful wise and deadly
