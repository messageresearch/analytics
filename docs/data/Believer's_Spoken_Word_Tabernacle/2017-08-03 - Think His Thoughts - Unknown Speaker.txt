Souls that came to the Lord and just you seem one of one of the one of the individuals just a young man that was there and been there for a while and in the midst of that service how the Lord just turned everything and he became locked in and focused on what was being said and as he was being he locked in on that and just how the Lord took that service and and ministered to him and all of a sudden you started seeing him right in the midst when I started praying for people his hands was up like this and then I started to speak to him I went down and began to pray with him and I said do you want to accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your lord and savior he said yes I do [Applause] glory be to God amen amen I tell you what you know it doesn't matter what the situation is sometimes we can

we pray and the Bride of Jesus Christ says amen amen you may be seated Saints thank you I really feel uh very comfortable and feel very uh you know easy and you know like uh you know uh it's good you know every time when I come here and uh Brother Sam is like a good friend of mine you know he's good friend to me you know and uh you know he sent me some prayer requests I send them some prayer requests and we have a communication and you know contacts and we'll keep in touch you know you know we love the Lord amen we love this message I would like to title this evening time the the sermon this message when you begin to think his thoughts when you begin to think his thoughts I would like to take this back my brothers and sisters most of my English I have learned by listening to brother Branham tapes so I've got a little accent and my words maybe sometime I speak a little Kentuckian accent because you know I went to you know message of the hour you know school you know [Laughter] praise the Lord you know see the burning desire the Zeal for the word of God made me to speak this much English and to speak and to read and to to to you know to do something for the Lord you know but uh you know when I was uh you know when I was started preaching I just uh you know uh was very nervous but even though every time at my home church I feel nervous I get nervous you know but uh when we submit ourselves into the mighty hands of almighty God then he will come on the scene you know because he said without him without him we can't do nothing you know we can't do nothing so praise the name of the Lord you love the word amen when you begin to think his thoughts like uh you know we think every person every man every woman every country you know in in this world we have different uh types of people different religions different denominations so everybody has got their own way of thinking they won't they got their own thinking so sometimes the cultures makes your mindset you know the the cultures the Customs the Traditions you know but uh you know we brother Branham said we are strangers and uh uh pilgrims our conversation is not from here our citizenship is in heaven We Came From Heaven and going back to heaven we came from God and we are going back to God we came from his mind amen he is mindful of us and someone said his mind is full of us he is mindful of us and his mind is full of us so we are here Express thought of almighty God and we are his eternal thoughts amen we are his eternal thoughts and expressed we we just came into existence by his grace we came here by his love by his Redemption plan he redeemed us from the sin of this world and he brought us together to Fellowship in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen praise the name of the Lord when you begin to think East thoughts that means his way of thinking when it comes into us we will be like a god we will be like a a deity brother Branham said we are not worshiping Christ in manger but we are worshiping Christ in US he just came to us he just is living in US amen when we begin to think his thoughts amen and uh here I would like to read what brother Branham said here uh about the thoughts he said his thoughts is what he was that's you too what's your thoughts are is what you are praise the Lord watch your thoughts are that is what you are no matter what you try to live by something else your thoughts is what you are amen whatever we are thinking whatever we are just having in our mind in our heart we are just expressing their things it is coming from us you know it is hidden in our mind it was hid in in our heart it's in inside of us something in there so that is coming inside so tonight you are here that something inside of you made you or made you to think to come to church the fellowship around God's people so that you expressed and you're living whatever you have inside of you that making you to express and you're working on that see before we do something or we do something that comes into your mind into our heart then we begin to do something by Deeds or works so here when we begin to think his thoughts see Indian people think in Indian way African people American people everybody's got their own way of thinking but you know what brother sister when we begin to think his thoughts then we will be like a god a deity that means we are a supernatural being inside not outside maybe the outside things are falling for outside world but inside Thinking Inside Man is pulling for inside the Unseen World Glory amen and amen hallelujah you might go along he said here brother random said and every believer that comes to Christ must come to the same cross of self-denial so Jesus said you got to take up your cross he then said I'll give you my cross and just carry that and follow me he then said that he said you've got to cry you got to carry your cross your problems your reproach for the word Hallelujah your physical problems mental problems spiritual problems whatever the problems you know the cross always you know shows like our trials hardships you know you know this kind of situations we are going through so we are carrying a burden and we are carrying something and following him by his grace here he said every believer that comes to Christ must come to the same Cross of self-denial and die there with the lamp love Jesus Christ Hallelujah with Islam die out to your own thoughts if something inside of you with a brand of preached a message called I stand at the door and knock and in that message brother Branham was talking about he was telling a story about an artist a artist a painter artist he drew a nice picture Jesus was standing right there at the door and knocking is that right so he was knocking the door and uh you know the picture was so beautiful the people made a good comments and some of the people made a different comments like they came and they looked all the things and they said where is the knob where is the knob where is the thing you know and the painter said you know what the knob the door was locked out inside so if the knob if the door was locked you know Jesus have no problem he can he can turn that and he'd go inside and brother Branham said the knob or the bolt or what the whatever you call it was locked inside of the Ark door you are the responsible person to open that knob or unlock the door to the Jesus Christ to come in right so my brothers and sisters here the brother Graham said die out to your own thoughts die out to your own mental thinking just take what the holy spirit says holy spirit says in your heart then live for Christ one time a brother asked me what's on your my brother Samson I said my mind is a Battlefield say Satan comes there and the Holy Spirit comes there it's a battle ground and you know lots going on in your mind Lord's coming and Lord's going and you know it's a it's a it's a mess it's a mess see but here brother Branham said just submit yourselves into the hands of God he said just take what the holy spirit says in your heart then live for Christ Hallelujah Christ the anointed word of this hour and here we people you know we are you know just uh you know human beings we think like this brother Brandon said here in uh you know I would like to read this course up in the message law 1955 he said like this let your testimony always and your thirst your thoughts everything never permit a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it he said when it starts that don't entertain it don't entertain your thoughts when something comes negative right he said well you say I can't help the thoughts from coming see we all have that kind of problems you know Satan wants to come and you know show you something and tell you something trying to put something in your mind see and we can't help that these thoughts are coming into our mind see here here brother random said you know I can't help the thoughts from coming well that will be like the farmers say that said he could stop the birds from flying over his place but he could sure stop them from roosting I like that amen so that's a good thing you see you can't help the thoughts when they come but don't entertain them whatever the Satan is coming whenever the Satan comes and tells you about something about the message or about your life about your about about your church about your ministry about your about your family about your personal life don't entertain them we are not supposed to entertain them right we are not here to entertain them we are not here to get that satanic mind in US let the mind of Christ be in here the word amen the word is God when you begin to take his thoughts then you whatever you speak it will be removed you can speak brother Brandon said you can create right we have that Authority the power amen we have the right to speak the word because the word comes into your mouth in our mouth before we speak it will be in our mind in our heart we will think amen praise the Lord here brother don't entertain them just pass it on no sir Jesus Is My Savior All Things Are Mine by God and I am going to keep them I'm going to testify of them I'm going to preach the word I'm going to testify I'm going to do something for the Lord I'm going to testify about this message I I Proclaim my healing I speak for a Deliverance I speak for a victory because I am in his mind praise the Lord hallelujah brothers and sisters here brother Branham said and now a word is a thought expressed first it must be a thought and then it becomes a word because you do not speak your words without a thought we can't speak because whatever we are thinking whatever in our heart whatever is in our mind so then we speak we express that words by our mouth by our lips see so that means we got to receive something inside Jesus knocking our door and we are the responsible people to open to unlock the door and invite our Lord Jesus Christ which is the word amen and let the word come in the scripture says let the word of Christ dwell in you in all in in all wisdom and richly when we receive Christ like Prophet said when you receive the word you will become the word amen when we've received the word see that means before he comes before he enter before he comes into your heart before he enter into our heart then something has to go out from us that means we have to die of our own thinking we have to take out all the garbage all the trash whatever inside of us we got to remove all these things and clean the house and let the Holy Spirit come inside and give him a preeminence in our life put God fast amen oh I feel so happy amen glory to God here brother Abraham said then when the human elements goes out and the spirit of God fills the vacancy praise God Hallelujah where you empty yourself amen then we'll be when the church in its power of the resurrection of Lord Jesus will walk in his steps in his power in his thoughts glory to God oh the resurrection brother Branham said there is something in you the Rapture is in you the healing is in you the resurrection power is in you amen amen one of these days we are not going to stay in this you know wrong body and wrong Garden we are living in wrong body and wrong Garden hallelujah praise the Lord here brother Branham said in his being in his moving you see what I mean then your thought will become words and words we come become will become material that's when the church in its power that's the power what is the power of the church the power of the church is the word of God the power the power of the church is the message of the hour the power of the church is the Holy Spirit the power is overcoming the power amen the new verse oh glorious praise the name of the Lord amen praise the Lord my brothers and sisters tonight here brother Branham said he changed my soul changed my thoughts and then my thoughts become so real till they become worse in my lips the word becomes so real whenever you speak something like brother Branham said just confess that brother John Ryan just confess I'm Healed I'm Healed I'm delivered I've redeemed I got the victory in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen when you Proclaim when you speak uh a word a positive word then it will come into pass and we'll see the reality of God and the manifestation of that healing manifestation of the power manifestation of the something Supernatural you can see God in front of you hey man Glory he changed my soul no one can change our souls no one can change our minds no one can change our hearts but God himself change your change or change your past change your beings Changing Life Hallelujah like Brother Sam said this evening about that little young brother praise the Lord the word changed him the ministry under the Holy Spirit changed his soul changing his heart life changing his heart changing him what changing him the transformation Power in the Blood in the world oh Gloria he changed my soul he changed my thoughts and then my thoughts become so real till they become worse in my lips and they materialize and they materialize and now I am a Christian now I am a Christian it made me a different person Hallelujah changing lives when you begin to think his thoughts you'll see the change you see the reality you'll see the resurrection power of God you there is something working in you you see the something Supernatural comes into you before it comes into our heart we have to do something it has to go something out when we clean up then something comes in and then that makes a change glory to God aren't you glad they're for Saints amen amen hallelujah and he said I it made me a different person that's what made you see he said so if you speak one thing here you got to you know we got to be very careful about these things here brother random said uh he said you know facil you know and also the absolute the word became flesh India trip report wisdom versus Faith Christ all this message I'm reading all these quotes from these prophet's messages he said so if you speak one thing and think another you better stop that we got to stop that way of doing things like that you know it's totally you know contrary like uh it's like nothing but like a hypocrisy hypocrite you know see if you speak one thing and think another you better stop that get your thoughts on God see see I my personal experience here tonight I was thinking about my wife about my family about my church thoughts on my mind thoughts on my heart not only under my mind on not only on my heart it's in my soul it's in my spirit because there belongs to me I love them I I think about my wife day and night and she was thinking about me day and night see that means if you have something on your heart if God is our spiritual husband if God is our lover of our soul then if we are a bride of Jesus Christ an elected lady or Mrs Jesus Christ then we think about him all the day all the night every moment every day every hour we think about him we want to we want to think about him we would like to think about him we think about him all the day all the night amen because it is on our heart in our heart in our mind amen so here he said you better stop that get your thoughts on God what is God God is the word when you begin to think about God's word about God then you are you know manifesting your thoughts and whenever you see something come to come to you and negative a thing like a a illness or sickness or mental problem a spiritual problem a church problem or a family problem a financial problem a poverty or whatever you know then when you think about God when you have the thoughts when you're filled with the Holy Spirit when when you have that word in you then you speak to that circumstances by positive attitude by God's word proclaiming that saying that this is me I am a possessor of death of his enemy I am a conqueror I am an overcomer I am healed because the scripture says the word is very close to you the word is nighty the word is in your mouth and the word is in your heart the word which we preach the word of faith amen Hallelujah keep them pure and stay right there with it and speak the same thing all the time if the Devil comes and tells you oh this word this scripture is not like this and this this this message is not right no no you should not entertain their thoughts under any circumstances see when my uncle he offered me he said son just come out from William Branham Doctrine I will send you for Bachelor of divinity and doctor of divinity and you will be having a nice mansion and we will appoint you as a coordinator in the missions department and you will be having a nice car and your children will be going to nice school he's a multi-millionaire hundreds and hundreds of acres of land and paying thousands of rupees and money to the people those who are working for him National director of the Baptist missions he offered me if I would have compromise with him see brother sister never compromise for money never compromise for material Hallelujah never compromise for worldly pleasure amen because we are egos we are we are supernatural beings we have that revelation we have that world inside we are answered to the world we have anchored to the message of the hour Christ the anointed word of this hour nothing can shake you nothing can pull you out nothing can move you because you are ordained for that purpose Laura blessed be the name of the Lord Hallelujah how could I how could I deny my you know Birthright before he offered me before he spoke to me about few things like that God already filled me with the word you know my heart was filled with the message of the hour and my heart was anchored to Christ brother Bill my soul was anchored amen my heart my soul anchored and God filled my my empty cup with the anointing of the Holy Spirit he anointed he filled my heart with the word and he opened my spiritual sight to see the revelation of Jesus Christ amen and God Jesus said my sheep here my voice and they will follow me no one can plot them out from my father's hand Hallelujah God keeping you and me in his hands praise the name of the Lord my brothers and sisters speak the same thing all the time I have never compromised I said keep on saying like

unusual things it manifests in front of you it comes say my brothers and sister this is for the glory of God amen praise the Lord and this Brother Gary Walker from Australia he visited Us in in 2012. see in the daytime it was even though it was our winter season but you know what uh we had a meetings our opener because we could not afford our uh space in our church we we can't put all these people in the church it is a little small church but we have an open ground and we set up all the tents and all this stuff like that you know and this brother was preaching and I was interpreting for him he was here and interpreting and the people in the congregation the church all the Believers and the ministers they were so much rejoicing and worshiping God and and enjoying the word and feast on the word and and and some of the ministers there's pointing like this up up up I don't understand what they're saying even Brother Gary he didn't understand what they're saying maybe they are praising the Lord I thought you know but you know what all of a sudden their atmosphere it was so hot it was so hot this brother is getting red you know in in in those countries you know when the weather you know it's like a hundred degrees and 70 80 degrees 90 degrees you know when you stand outside you'll become red you know sweating out you know so this brother was preaching and and and and all of a sudden a cold breeze cool air coming from right sides I feel that horse feels so good and then and then this brother is also preaching good and uh these brothers are pointing up right after the service what happened you know the people the Believers and the ministers they told me brother Samson you know what happened I said what I said yeah somebody is pointing like that what that mean uh what what what what what what they want to say and these people told me everywhere it's very hot and sunshine except our meeting place was covered by the cloud glory to God when you begin to think his thoughts God will come upon the same it's not only one day the next day also same continuation same thing repeated again haha another Cloud I mean the same Cloud maybe the supernatural Cloud amen amen we are people here following the supernatural Cloud Supernatural uh a pillar of Fire amen when you begin to think his Source my brothers and sisters I can tell you hundreds and hundreds of testimonies because sometimes we are human beings but uh don't uh give up don't feel bad don't worry the new birth is like a process every natural birth it's totally you know type to the Natural birth the new birth and the and the spiritual birth is a it's a type you know even though you know my children you know they're born to me they are my children my cell of faith my Susan Elizabeth my Samuel you know they born to me but you know what they do mistakes they did mistakes they do all kinds of wrongs and mistakes you know well they're you know you know when they start walking they will fall down when they speak in the beginning you know in the first time you know they they may they make mistakes but we are not taking that as an excuse or you know we understand as our as a parents we understand as a father have that that experience so when they are doing something mistake or wrong or something then I understand them very well and I'll help them I try to help them I tried to do something the same way I don't I don't want to deny them I don't want to uh you know say oh you doing all these mistakes oh you you're not born to me you're not my children you're not my my son you're not my I can't say that even they have borne to me even I'm a father to them they do mistakes every every you know children have their thing but what I'm trying to say is when we are born again when we are we got a new birth God gave God beget us the scripture says James 1 18 he began Us by his word so he begat Us by his word so when he begat us when we are born to him the scripture says they are not by the they were not born by the blood or will of man or will of Flesh you know they're born to God how God began them God began them by his spoken word so the spoken word see it is inside that gave us the new verse a supernatural verse a new verse a baptism of the Holy Spirit even though we have that even though we are coming to church we are praying we are reading we are having Services sometimes we do some mistakes we are falling down we are coming in something wrong but you know what brother sister he is our father amen but we are not entertaining that negative thoughts but accidentally we are making some mistake or falling down did some wrong the following mistake you doing something but God what is doing you know he is taking care of his own family God is taking care of his own his mind is full he is mindful of us and his mind is full of us amen I like that amen and amen praise the Lord hallelujah and uh here my brothers and sisters I don't know how it's 8 30. but anyway last quote I read last quote and I turned the service to the man of God I don't want to put you long I know your people trying to you know go to your home and uh you know I know you know but my brothers and sisters it's a a privilege to be here amen but I would like to read a last quote and I give it to turn the service to the man of God here brother Branham said you will um it said uh now but when a man will do he will hear a little something and keep moving his papers well now you will never find Christ moving your papers and and he said you have to move your thoughts and he said you have to move your thinking and get away from reason and move your thoughts from your own way of thinking to what God thinks let the mind that was in Christ Jesus be in you and then when you begin see what here brother Graham said and then when you begin to think he starts you will begin to leave his life that's the main thing when you begin to think his thoughts you will begin to live his life and do the things that he did see what I mean now because it is not you it's Christ when we begin to think his thoughts we possess the gates of the enemy we we speak the word we profess he confess a good confession amen he think the kind of thoughts he would think through you amen so my dear precious brothers and sisters this evening time I really really appreciate your time and you know your prayers
