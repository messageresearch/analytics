[45:01] the lord willing
[45:03] will have his graduation party to be
[45:04] just like a fellowship dinner
[45:07] so he wanted to make you aware of that
[45:10] also i understand that the
[45:13] young people maybe not all
[45:15] they had a wonderful time on the water
[45:17] yesterday
[45:18] canoeing was a canoeing brother shane
[45:21] kayaking okay
[45:24] if i would have been there i had to look
[45:25] for a boat with a motor
[45:29] no i i enjoy the boats and paddles i uh
[45:32] finley park has a nice little thing out
[45:34] there too sometimes you can rent some of
[45:35] the
[45:36] uh i don't think it cost you anything
[45:38] does it at finley park i think you
[45:40] you're able to do that but they they had
[45:42] a good time going up the
[45:44] black river there for a little bit and
[45:46] i know had a good time of fellowship the
[45:48] the boys were certainly talking about it
[45:50] when they got home and
[45:51] uh so we
[45:53] i know whatever goes on there it stays
[45:56] there so
[45:57] so i know there's some pictures that
[46:00] probably will be posted there on the
[46:02] facebook page and things like that but
[46:04] let's just turn to the to well you're
[46:06] already there in leviticus 25 and let's
[46:08] just read here a few verses of scripture
[46:13] and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of
[46:15] years unto thee seven times
[46:18] seven years and the space of the seven
[46:21] sabbaths of years shall be unto thee
[46:24] forty and nine years
[46:26] then thou shalt cause the trumpet of the
[46:29] jubilee to sound on the tenth day
[46:32] of the seventh month in the day of
[46:34] atonement shall you make the trumpet
[46:37] sound throughout all your land
[46:39] you shall hallow the 50th year
[46:42] and proclaim liberty throughout all the
[46:44] land unto all the inhabitants thereof
[46:48] it shall be a jubilee unto you
[46:50] and you shall return every man unto his
[46:52] possession
[46:53] and ye shall return every man unto his
[46:56] family
[46:58] and a jubilee shall that fiftieth year
[47:01] be unto you
[47:02] ye shall not sow neither reap that which
[47:05] groweth of itself in it nor gather the
[47:08] grapes in it of divine undress
[47:10] for it is the jubilee it shall be holy
[47:13] unto you
[47:14] you shall eat the increase thereof out
[47:16] of the land
[47:17] in the year of this jubilee ye shall
[47:19] return every man
[47:21] unto his possession amen may god bless
[47:25] you bless the reading of the word as
[47:26] you're being seated
[47:30] just
[47:33] just drawn to this thought and we've
[47:35] been looking at this for a few services
[47:38] and there's a place we're trying to get
[47:40] to
[47:42] within it and
[47:44] but i want to continue to speak on that
[47:46] thought
[47:47] you have a voice
[47:50] because when you see here in the
[47:52] scripture
[47:53] god has given
[47:55] a direction
[47:56] that you shall cause the trumpet of the
[48:00] jubilee
[48:01] to sound and that then it's given a
[48:04] designated time of when that trumpet is
[48:07] to sound
[48:09] and i believe that if we could just move
[48:11] ahead just a few moments and just where
[48:13] we're going to work where we're working
[48:15] towards
[48:16] is the reality of us having a voice is
[48:20] where it's not just our voice as far as
[48:24] my voice that you would hear here or
[48:26] your voice or sound of it and somebody
[48:28] recognizes our voice
[48:30] but it's the voice of god's own life
[48:33] that sounds through our lives
[48:36] and that's that's where we're working to
[48:38] you have a voice because
[48:41] this liberty is not a liberty that is
[48:44] alone proclaimed
[48:47] in at a at a church or at the church
[48:51] though it is a place that we gather it's
[48:53] a place that the word of god is preached
[48:56] and it goes forth
[48:58] but your lives just like mine and
[49:00] everybody else is to be a life that
[49:02] proclaims that the liberty of jesus
[49:06] christ is here right now
[49:09] and true there's things that many can
[49:11] ask you and look at your life and
[49:13] sometimes you get questions such as
[49:16] where do you go to church or what do you
[49:18] believe or this or that and what they're
[49:20] asking about is the expression of the
[49:24] life that's being lived out
[49:26] and remember it's not altogether our
[49:29] words that actually have the greatest
[49:32] impact it's the life that speaks so much
[49:35] louder than the words
[49:37] because many times it's our life it's
[49:40] the things that we
[49:41] will will how we conduct ourselves in
[49:44] our life that draws the attention and
[49:47] it's actually drawing the attention to
[49:49] the right thing and that's to the lord
[49:51] jesus christ
[49:52] and these are things that you know when
[49:55] you think of the slave who was in the
[49:57] field and remember they came the one who
[49:59] wanted to purchase a slave they came by
[50:02] and they were looking there and they
[50:03] wanted to buy a certain one because they
[50:05] noticed that there were things about him
[50:08] that was standing out differently from
[50:10] others now it wasn't his color it wasn't
[50:13] his stature it wasn't his height it was
[50:15] his conduct that separated him from the
[50:18] rest of the slaves and so that conduct
[50:21] is the character of life that was being
[50:23] expressed and that's exactly the voice
[50:26] that god has called us to it's not our
[50:29] character that's on display it's the
[50:32] character of jesus christ that is moving
[50:35] and molding and shaping our character to
[50:38] announce that there is a liberty that is
[50:42] present upon earth right now
[50:45] that anyone who wants to be free can
[50:48] indeed go free
[50:50] now we know that everyone will not
[50:51] receive it everyone will not hear it
[50:53] even people who come and
[50:56] uh inquire of the things that sometimes
[50:58] are in our life sometimes it isn't right
[51:01] then and there that it that it they
[51:03] respond to it sometimes it's a period of
[51:05] time later but what's important is the
[51:07] seed itself that whatever the expression
[51:10] and what's going out of our life that it
[51:12] is seed and it's a seed of god because
[51:15] when seed when that seed of god of the
[51:18] word of character is sown
[51:20] then it invites a channel for the
[51:22] supernatural to move because whenever
[51:25] you know you get away from a person and
[51:27] whatever more
[51:28] and what they can go back and remember
[51:31] they may not altogether remember the
[51:32] words that you say but they remember the
[51:35] impression of the life and the spirit
[51:37] that is around your life and that's what
[51:40] has an impact on people's lives
[51:43] and so we recognize that in this time
[51:47] we do have a voice and i want to just
[51:49] lay some of these things in and just see
[51:51] how the lord will will take us and i
[51:53] don't want to go
[51:54] so quickly on this because there's
[51:56] directions there's things i want to move
[51:57] into here if the lord terry's even in to
[52:00] some coming services
[52:03] but to understand that as god places it
[52:06] here
[52:07] in leviticus 25 that there's an allotted
[52:10] portion
[52:12] that is given
[52:13] uh for every son and daughter of god
[52:16] that even when they were down there in
[52:19] egypt and here they were they were they
[52:22] were awaiting a promise of god to come
[52:24] their way israel was waiting then
[52:27] and there had to be a way that where
[52:30] they would be brought out of that
[52:31] bondage and god said i'll do it by a
[52:33] mighty hand
[52:34] and we recognize that then them coming
[52:37] into the land because god said i will
[52:40] come there and i will bring my people up
[52:43] out of the land of egypt and into the
[52:46] land of promise
[52:48] now we realize that redemption itself
[52:51] has two parts
[52:52] it's a coming out of
[52:54] and are going into
[52:56] and so it all is a work of god
[52:59] it's god working to draw us out
[53:03] and bring us in
[53:05] because as long as we're still closed
[53:08] off we can never be brought in
[53:10] so the word it comes to first of all
[53:14] it's proclaiming a liberty it's
[53:16] proclaiming a freedom and that begins to
[53:18] rise within a life to have faith in the
[53:21] word that we are hearing that we might
[53:24] come into
[53:26] this land and the land itself that we're
[53:28] speaking of i have a visual but i didn't
[53:31] send that to him we'll probably get to
[53:32] this but the land itself that we're
[53:35] referring to when you think of israel
[53:38] israel here is a little uh just a little
[53:41] speck of land if i can say it that way
[53:43] it doesn't look it doesn't look really
[53:45] big in in comparison to other land mass
[53:48] but god was so interested in that part
[53:52] and to see that within all that that
[53:55] part of the land of israel it was a type
[53:58] of our inheritance that's in
[54:02] jesus christ
[54:05] and he is the word and within that
[54:08] within that land of of israel
[54:11] each one of them were to have their
[54:13] parts
[54:14] that would be divided remember god told
[54:18] joshua that you're to divide uh the
[54:21] inheritance among the children of israel
[54:24] how would that inheritance be divided
[54:27] god didn't leave it to just joshua to
[54:29] try to figure it out it was divided by
[54:33] inspiration
[54:34] but it was not inspiration that was a
[54:36] apart from the word it was inspiration
[54:40] that was by the word
[54:42] remember when god lays all of this out
[54:45] in the book of numbers as he's coming
[54:46] through there that joshua and it says it
[54:49] just like this that that that joshua
[54:52] elias are the the high priest and the
[54:54] urim thummim this these shall divide to
[54:58] you the inheritance of the lamb because
[55:01] our inheritance
[55:03] it comes to us
[55:05] by the holy spirit which is also our
[55:09] great high priest
[55:11] and what is he ministering to you and i
[55:14] not a creed not a dogma not a false hope
[55:17] not a sensation he's ministering to you
[55:20] and i the true spiritual blessings that
[55:24] belong to us
[55:26] in christ jesus he's ministering to us
[55:29] the word so
[55:31] the inheritance of our inheritance does
[55:34] not come any other way but by the word
[55:37] of god this is why brother branham when
[55:39] he takes in the adoption series and
[55:41] you'll hear him come into places and say
[55:43] the mystery of god and when you hear
[55:45] that phrase the mystery of god it's
[55:48] speaking of the baptism of the holy
[55:50] ghost our inheritance the seal of the
[55:53] holy ghost it's speaking of all those
[55:56] things that are the same and he says the
[55:58] mystery of god cannot be taught or
[56:01] learned in a seminary
[56:04] the mystery of god is the sovereignty
[56:07] and the grace of god that is revealed to
[56:10] you and i
[56:11] and god reveals it in such a simple way
[56:15] that it bypasses the intellect of man
[56:18] but it comes to a generation that we
[56:21] might come into our position in christ
[56:25] so that when it's all said and done
[56:27] there's not one of us can take glory in
[56:29] ourselves we can say it's all god
[56:35] it's all god
[56:37] so it's an allotted portion that we are
[56:40] we are called to
[56:42] this is an inheritance
[56:44] that as a free-born
[56:47] son of israel he had an inheritance
[56:50] let's say that his family was judah
[56:53] within that allotted portion that was
[56:55] given to judah in the land of israel
[56:59] every family had their place in
[57:02] that family of judah or if they were out
[57:05] of the family of issachar they had their
[57:08] place in that portion of the land this
[57:12] is why no one can take your place
[57:16] and it is wide that it's so imperative
[57:19] that we come into our position
[57:22] because it all works the body of jesus
[57:25] christ let me say it in this way the
[57:28] body of jesus christ the members of the
[57:31] body of jesus christ do not operate
[57:34] independent from one another but rather
[57:37] it is an
[57:38] interdependent working of a sovereign
[57:41] work of the holy spirit in every
[57:44] individual life that places us in the
[57:47] body so that the hands are with the arm
[57:50] the arm is with the rest of you you
[57:52] understand what i'm saying so that it
[57:54] brings the entire body and the body
[57:57] itself is the word
[58:01] so this is how
[58:02] god is be and so with the body just like
[58:05] your hand or my hand or nose or whatever
[58:07] every part
[58:08] of our body it is to serve a function
[58:12] is that right even the parts that you're
[58:14] standing up here right now you don't see
[58:16] my heart
[58:17] i mean maybe unless i'm really you know
[58:19] a little nervous you might say man the
[58:21] tie's moving or whatever you don't see
[58:23] it but you know did you know it's
[58:24] operating
[58:26] i'm still standing here is that right
[58:27] respiratory system you know that it's
[58:30] working and operating because i've still
[58:32] got breath to preach right you don't see
[58:34] that but everything is working in a
[58:37] necessary manner to serve a purpose
[58:43] so that's a little bit of a vision of
[58:45] where we're going here
[58:47] this jubilee is to bring it's a liberty
[58:50] so the day of atonement
[58:53] when we look at this of how the trumpet
[58:56] was just the trumpet of the jubilee was
[58:58] to sound and was to proclaim that 50th
[59:02] year it was a proclaiming of liberty
[59:05] when it would be sounded but the day of
[59:07] atonement
[59:09] was
[59:10] every year at the appointed time
[59:15] are you with me
[59:16] the day of atonement there has been a
[59:19] ministry down through the ages
[59:22] that has continued to speak and declare
[59:27] that the lord jesus christ is our
[59:30] all-sufficiency are you with me
[59:33] but they can only declare according to
[59:36] the light that is revealed to them
[59:39] there was word when it started out on
[59:41] the day of pentecost it was a complete
[59:43] sounding it was a jubilee
[59:46] that was being sounded out at that time
[59:49] that was calling the sons and daughters
[59:51] of god
[59:52] to the promise that god had declared and
[59:56] made real in that hour this was this was
[59:58] the true pentecost but you're aware that
[1:00:01] here after you know uh 33 years and or
[1:00:04] after you know that that period of time
[1:00:06] then it goes into we enter into that
[1:00:08] first church age of that ephesian age
[1:00:11] and when it enters into there there's
[1:00:13] already been those parts where god
[1:00:15] remember as he said in the ephesian age
[1:00:18] i have somewhat against thee
[1:00:20] you see it's one of those things that we
[1:00:22] don't even want god to have one speck
[1:00:24] against us
[1:00:26] is that right we don't even want him to
[1:00:29] have somewhat because that somewhat she
[1:00:31] was already fallen
[1:00:33] why was she fallen because satan had
[1:00:35] come in to tamper
[1:00:37] with the real true experience of the
[1:00:42] depth of the life of jesus christ coming
[1:00:45] into a life how did satan tamper with
[1:00:48] that life by tampering with the
[1:00:50] prescription
[1:00:51] with the word
[1:00:53] is that right he began to just tamper
[1:00:55] with that a little bit because remember
[1:00:57] our inheritance comes by the word that
[1:01:01] this is why brother and sister that the
[1:01:03] holy ghost does not come outside of the
[1:01:06] revealed word of the hour
[1:01:08] a person can truly receive the holy
[1:01:10] spirit on their flesh and on their
[1:01:12] spirit justification sanctification but
[1:01:14] remember what jesus said he will send
[1:01:17] the promise of the spirit in my
[1:01:21] name
[1:01:22] and his name is his character
[1:01:26] is his word
[1:01:29] is that right
[1:01:31] this is how the holy spirit comes it
[1:01:33] comes through the word because the holy
[1:01:36] spirit is that
[1:01:38] earnest deposit of your inheritance and
[1:01:42] it comes to you through the word and so
[1:01:46] how by you hearing the word you're
[1:01:49] hearing the holy spirit speak to you
[1:01:52] this is your inheritance
[1:01:57] so even though the day of atonement
[1:02:00] every year
[1:02:01] there in the month of october or or you
[1:02:03] know the day when the month of october
[1:02:05] forgive me i i just let me just move
[1:02:07] with this a moment but the day of
[1:02:09] atonement would be proclaimed every year
[1:02:12] there and yet now god would have a
[1:02:14] special a lot of time
[1:02:16] that after seven sabbaths or after seven
[1:02:20] church ages there would come a sounding
[1:02:24] because the bible tells us in
[1:02:26] revelations 10 verse 7 that when he
[1:02:30] shall begin to sound
[1:02:33] the mystery of god
[1:02:36] should be finished
[1:02:38] so it was the finishing of the entire
[1:02:41] body every part coming into its position
[1:02:45] in the body and it is god
[1:02:48] his voice that sounds through and the
[1:02:51] finishing of the mystery of god which is
[1:02:54] our inheritance the baptism of the holy
[1:02:56] ghost the seal of the living god our
[1:02:59] position in christ as adopted sons and
[1:03:03] daughters of god
[1:03:06] so
[1:03:07] you you see that there is a reconciling
[1:03:12] that takes place and brother brown would
[1:03:14] always he he he says in uh
[1:03:17] christ a mystery he reads out of first
[1:03:19] colossians there and he's dealing with
[1:03:22] that reconciliation and he says i want
[1:03:24] you to know
[1:03:25] watch where this reconciliation went see
[1:03:28] the reconciliation just doesn't stop in
[1:03:31] us being reconciled to christ in this
[1:03:34] life but that reconciliation here we are
[1:03:37] to go into my father's house are many
[1:03:41] mansions
[1:03:43] see it's a calling
[1:03:45] from not only called us from a life of
[1:03:47] sin
[1:03:48] from under bondage into a liberty where
[1:03:51] we've received the spirit of that land
[1:03:54] which is an earnest of our inheritance
[1:03:57] but it's calling us into a full
[1:04:00] reconciliation to where not only our
[1:04:02] souls have been reconciled
[1:04:04] but to where that in our spirit which we
[1:04:08] receive the theophany in place of the
[1:04:09] human spirit and this body receiving a
[1:04:12] glorified body it's a time of
[1:04:15] reconciliation
[1:04:17] it's the word itself that has come to
[1:04:20] bring us back into our rightful position
[1:04:24] so brother branham would say it like
[1:04:26] this in the jubilee year and i'm just
[1:04:28] going to maybe skip down to the second
[1:04:30] paragraph i have there
[1:04:31] and he says when this jubilee year come
[1:04:34] by
[1:04:35] then the priest rode the land sounding
[1:04:38] the trumpet
[1:04:40] that's very important he just could not
[1:04:42] blow it in jerusalem because those out
[1:04:44] there in other places couldn't hear it
[1:04:48] you have a voice
[1:04:50] that voice of liberty reaches out to
[1:04:52] places my voice could never reach
[1:04:55] because it's not my voice anyhow
[1:04:58] it's not brother branham's voice it's
[1:05:00] the voice of god that was sealed within
[1:05:03] that voice and it's the same voice of
[1:05:05] god in the bride of jesus christ right
[1:05:08] now
[1:05:10] but samuel i can't put it all together
[1:05:13] it's not about that you can put it all
[1:05:15] together
[1:05:16] it's about is there a life that is lived
[1:05:19] in harmony with the word
[1:05:21] that is a voice that speaks louder
[1:05:26] than any placing together of scriptures
[1:05:28] and quotes and every other thing it's a
[1:05:30] life that's lived
[1:05:34] oh glory be to god this is our
[1:05:36] inheritance when this jubilee year come
[1:05:38] by then the priest rode the land
[1:05:40] sounding the trumpet and every slave
[1:05:43] that had been bought with a price and
[1:05:45] become a servant was given the privilege
[1:05:48] to be made free
[1:05:50] go back home again back to his loved
[1:05:53] ones he was redeemed back by grace he
[1:05:56] didn't have to pay anything his loved
[1:05:59] ones didn't have to pay anything it was
[1:06:01] an act of god oh what a beautiful
[1:06:03] illustration
[1:06:04] today that men and women in our country
[1:06:07] and everywhere else has sold their self
[1:06:09] out to sin drinking gambling carousing
[1:06:11] doing things that they ought not to do
[1:06:13] and become slaves to the devil
[1:06:16] so the priest would ride throughout the
[1:06:18] land now remember in the type as we were
[1:06:20] looking at and we read from the
[1:06:22] scripture that there is to be a
[1:06:24] fulfillment of the type in the antitype
[1:06:27] this priest could would sound he would
[1:06:30] ride throughout the land what was he
[1:06:32] proclaiming when he blew
[1:06:34] that trumpet it was announcing that the
[1:06:38] day of atonement that there had had been
[1:06:41] uh not only the blood of the heifer had
[1:06:44] been offered up you know for for his
[1:06:46] sins because this priest also had to
[1:06:49] offer it for his sins because he was
[1:06:51] born uh of a woman is that right this
[1:06:54] priest he was born of so he had to offer
[1:06:57] blood for his own sin then he would
[1:07:00] offer up then the a live goat for that
[1:07:02] of the of the people and then from the
[1:07:04] light goat he would put his hands upon
[1:07:06] the scapegoat we've heard of scapegoats
[1:07:09] right maybe you were used used as one at
[1:07:11] work or something but you've heard
[1:07:12] escape goats and this is where all the
[1:07:15] iniquities and the sins were cast upon
[1:07:18] that scapegoat and a fit man the bible
[1:07:20] says is to take that scapegoat not just
[1:07:23] to let the scape go like go out here in
[1:07:25] the parking lot no you take it to a land
[1:07:28] uninhabited because that scapegoat it
[1:07:31] bore the iniquities and the sins it bore
[1:07:35] everything from that year and that
[1:07:38] scapegoat would never come back into the
[1:07:40] camp of israel again out there in an
[1:07:42] uninhabited land you would never come
[1:07:45] back again no doubt there would be that
[1:07:47] of an animal a wild animal that would
[1:07:49] take it what did that represent that
[1:07:51] when a life has been made free by the
[1:07:53] blood of jesus christ there is a blood
[1:07:56] that's able to pack away every sin and
[1:07:59] change the nature so that you're never
[1:08:01] haunted anymore there's come such a
[1:08:04] separation down in the depths of your
[1:08:06] soul that you know i'm not the same man
[1:08:08] or same woman than i used to be my
[1:08:11] desires have been changed and it's
[1:08:13] christ he's everything he's the only
[1:08:16] thing i care about he's the only one i
[1:08:18] want to please he's my desire what is
[1:08:20] that that is then evidence that there
[1:08:23] has been a reconciling in that life
[1:08:29] so the priest himself would ride
[1:08:32] throughout the land and his blowing was
[1:08:35] announcing what the others couldn't see
[1:08:38] somebody in another place because they
[1:08:40] weren't privileged to go into the
[1:08:41] tabernacle they were not privileged to
[1:08:44] look and see all of this being offered
[1:08:46] up they couldn't see that
[1:08:48] but this sound
[1:08:50] let them know the blood's been shed the
[1:08:53] atonement all has been made there's a
[1:08:55] reconciling and you have been reconciled
[1:08:59] with it
[1:09:00] so the sound was actually the
[1:09:03] declaration the blood has been spilled
[1:09:07] and accepted and you have been accepted
[1:09:10] in by the blood you're free
[1:09:15] so the sound had a voice had
[1:09:17] significance it spoke that the blood had
[1:09:20] been shed and that you can go free but
[1:09:23] you realize that this was a type there
[1:09:25] must come that anatype and there had to
[1:09:27] come one who was free from the sexual
[1:09:30] birth
[1:09:32] it could not because you know man here
[1:09:35] he was man it had come to place to where
[1:09:38] there's no one was worthy no one could
[1:09:42] bring that really restoration no one no
[1:09:45] even though all of the holy prophets
[1:09:47] they were they were men that spoke as
[1:09:50] the spirit of christ would move upon
[1:09:52] them but it was still in the negative
[1:09:55] it can only come into the positive when
[1:09:58] the very spirit of christ that moved
[1:10:00] upon them in portion after portion after
[1:10:03] portion remember the people would fall
[1:10:05] they would call them back people would
[1:10:07] fall away they would call them back
[1:10:09] people would fall away they would call
[1:10:10] them back it only spoke that there was
[1:10:13] coming a real true jubilee to where god
[1:10:18] by his sovereign grace could bring his
[1:10:21] children into a place that's impossible
[1:10:23] to fall from he could bring him into a
[1:10:26] place of such divine security by the
[1:10:29] grace of god coming and being manifested
[1:10:32] in their life god was announcing that
[1:10:34] there is coming a time that this indeed
[1:10:38] will no longer be just a type but it
[1:10:40] will become a place of security
[1:10:46] so there had to come one who was free
[1:10:48] from sexual birth they had to come one
[1:10:50] that had the blood that had a power to
[1:10:52] loosen
[1:10:54] and to think you know
[1:10:55] when god made the first man
[1:10:58] he made him a son
[1:11:00] is that right
[1:11:02] adam was his created son
[1:11:04] but adam
[1:11:07] fell
[1:11:08] by disobedience
[1:11:10] is that right the bible says in timothy
[1:11:12] eve was deceived
[1:11:15] adam fell in disobedience
[1:11:17] adam was not ignorant of what was taking
[1:11:19] place he he was it was right out there
[1:11:23] disobedient and he went out there to
[1:11:25] take uh that place so that that it that
[1:11:29] that his wife would not be consumed now
[1:11:33] think of this here
[1:11:34] brother batman will lay this out in the
[1:11:35] message the token
[1:11:37] and he says therefore he says i don't
[1:11:39] have this i don't believe up there but
[1:11:42] he says therefore he says the whole
[1:11:44] human race that was born was in sin
[1:11:47] there was no way to come out
[1:11:51] every one of us
[1:11:52] were born in sin shaped in iniquity we
[1:11:55] come to the world speaking life
[1:11:57] there was no way oh brother samuel my
[1:11:59] parents were message believers you still
[1:12:00] came you still came with no way out
[1:12:05] as parents we
[1:12:07] we do what god has instructed and given
[1:12:09] us to do remember with with parenting
[1:12:12] and things there's all there's the part
[1:12:14] there's the two parts the moses and
[1:12:15] joshua moses statutes and judgments and
[1:12:18] commandments right
[1:12:20] boundaries
[1:12:22] are you with me
[1:12:24] but moses never took him into the land
[1:12:26] [Music]
[1:12:27] joshua takes him in
[1:12:29] the same joshua the same holy ghost that
[1:12:32] brought you in
[1:12:33] but you see when they came into the land
[1:12:35] what were they doing the fulfillment of
[1:12:37] the word that had been given to moses
[1:12:40] this is why it's important to lay in the
[1:12:42] word or lay the word in as parents not
[1:12:44] just speaking it but living it
[1:12:48] setting standards setting standards and
[1:12:49] it's not always about chapters and
[1:12:51] verses but even the standards of the
[1:12:53] word that's given and are everything we
[1:12:55] do our discipline and everything it
[1:12:57] should be centered upon the word because
[1:13:00] real true discipline is not about
[1:13:03] irritation at the moment true discipline
[1:13:05] brother bram tells us in the seventh
[1:13:07] church age discipline is with a vision
[1:13:10] in mind god is seeing our future and
[1:13:13] he's knowing if we don't get it
[1:13:15] corrected here when we get way on down
[1:13:17] the line it'll really be off
[1:13:19] so when god disciplines it's just like
[1:13:21] you know brother bram will bring it in
[1:13:22] other places you know you find the boy
[1:13:24] who's laying down on the floor throwing
[1:13:26] a temper tantrum in the you know in the
[1:13:29] in the store if that never gets
[1:13:31] corrected he may not lay in the floor
[1:13:33] with his wife and throw a temper tantrum
[1:13:36] but he'll actually have ways of getting
[1:13:38] his own way
[1:13:42] how can that be well you see there's
[1:13:43] certain things that are inherent of that
[1:13:46] first nature
[1:13:47] this is why the bible says that with the
[1:13:50] rod foolishness is driven out of the
[1:13:55] heart of the child
[1:13:57] god brings his word to do what drive out
[1:14:00] the foolishness of our heart because god
[1:14:02] realizes the actions the behaviors why
[1:14:05] it is the way it is is because
[1:14:07] foolishness is bound up in the heart but
[1:14:09] if it can ever it can get that
[1:14:11] foolishness driven out of the way this
[1:14:13] is why he that cometh to god must be
[1:14:16] must be first tried and chastened and
[1:14:18] the chastening never ends in our life
[1:14:21] but it's god working and bringing
[1:14:23] correction in our life and remember a
[1:14:25] person that refuses correction from the
[1:14:29] word is not a son but it's an
[1:14:31] illegitimate bastard-born one
[1:14:34] is that right that's scripture that's
[1:14:36] plain this is why it's a blessing to
[1:14:39] even be corrected and be able to be
[1:14:42] corrected
[1:14:43] because that's what sons and daughters
[1:14:45] do they receive the correction of the
[1:14:48] word
[1:14:50] oh my so you see it's god working in in
[1:14:52] such a
[1:14:54] divine way to bring us into this place
[1:14:57] brother brahman says now he says what
[1:14:58] happened is god came down
[1:15:01] and there's only one way to get him back
[1:15:04] that's to get him back a son again
[1:15:08] because there's no
[1:15:10] no one that was up on earth you had
[1:15:12] elijah you had a moses you had jeremiah
[1:15:15] you had all them but none of them
[1:15:17] could actually
[1:15:19] sufficiently pay the price
[1:15:22] for you or me
[1:15:25] because that was a polluted blood
[1:15:29] are you with me it was a polluted blood
[1:15:31] underneath that blood was still all
[1:15:34] condemnation there could never be be a
[1:15:37] loosening or freedom come
[1:15:39] so god had to get him back a son again
[1:15:42] so what god had to do was become a part
[1:15:47] of his own creation
[1:15:50] it was a fallen creation but god himself
[1:15:54] now steps forward and in fulfillment of
[1:15:57] his word that he said back there in eden
[1:15:59] i will make a way back for you he was
[1:16:04] announcing that your inheritance oh my
[1:16:07] will not be gone forever
[1:16:10] but i'm gonna bring you back to your
[1:16:12] inheritance
[1:16:14] i'll make a way back and when the lord
[1:16:17] jesus stood here he said i am the way
[1:16:20] the truth and the life
[1:16:22] so the way back is the very person of
[1:16:26] god himself come down there in the form
[1:16:29] of jesus christ god getting himself a
[1:16:31] son back again where the blood itself
[1:16:34] the creative blood of almighty god god
[1:16:37] spoke the word remember to mary and mary
[1:16:40] said how shall this be seeing i know not
[1:16:42] a man and he said the holy ghost shall
[1:16:44] overshadow thee so the very the very
[1:16:48] word of god has spoken the holy spirit
[1:16:51] came and brought the creation according
[1:16:54] to the word it was a body that was not
[1:16:57] linked or a part of that of mary or
[1:17:01] joseph are you with me it was not part
[1:17:04] of the polluted bloodstream that was
[1:17:06] here upon this earth but it was already
[1:17:09] under the freedom and liberty of the
[1:17:12] word oh my mama
[1:17:14] the word already had been spoken now god
[1:17:17] getting himself a son back and brother
[1:17:20] brahm said how can he do it when his own
[1:17:22] law stood there and said he's condemned
[1:17:25] we were all condemned
[1:17:26] is that right condemned
[1:17:28] there wasn't anybody can anybody stand
[1:17:30] up is anybody worthy can anybody do this
[1:17:33] can any can anybody take the book is
[1:17:35] anybody worthy nobody
[1:17:38] i mean brother branham steps back there
[1:17:40] in the message of breach and he lets us
[1:17:41] know the expanse you know we could have
[1:17:44] looked and said elijah he's a pretty
[1:17:45] good man jeremiah he's a pretty good man
[1:17:48] all of them were good men but not one of
[1:17:50] them qualified to be the kinsmen
[1:17:53] redeemer
[1:17:55] but the one who sent jeremiah
[1:17:59] the one who anointed jeremiah
[1:18:02] the one who spoke through jeremiah
[1:18:04] that same one wrapped up and gathered
[1:18:07] everything that he had spoke to jeremiah
[1:18:10] through abraham through noah through
[1:18:11] elijah three lashes through all of us he
[1:18:14] gathered all the loose ends and gathered
[1:18:16] them unto himself to reveal himself that
[1:18:20] indeed he's the same god all the way on
[1:18:22] down not a part of the rainbow but now
[1:18:25] the full covenant son is on the scene
[1:18:29] he gathers the word unto himself and
[1:18:32] what is revealed he reveals himself
[1:18:35] i was there in jeremiah was there an
[1:18:37] elijah i was there in moses everything
[1:18:41] identifies him
[1:18:43] so brother braham says then the father
[1:18:45] himself become one of us
[1:18:47] that's the real lamb jesus wasn't a
[1:18:49] second person
[1:18:51] if jesus is anything different from god
[1:18:53] we're still in our sins
[1:18:56] are you with me
[1:18:58] that that's not that we're still
[1:18:59] condemned
[1:19:02] you see then the father himself become
[1:19:05] one of us
[1:19:06] that's the real lamb
[1:19:08] that's his purpose he had in the mind
[1:19:10] and brother braham goes through of how
[1:19:12] that it's always been the lamb from the
[1:19:14] very uh onset right there in the garden
[1:19:16] of eden
[1:19:17] not to think of it
[1:19:19] that the first man the bible tells us in
[1:19:21] first corinthians 15 that the first man
[1:19:23] adam was made a living soul
[1:19:26] but the second
[1:19:28] adam
[1:19:31] was the quickening spirit
[1:19:33] the lord from heaven
[1:19:36] is that right almighty god come down you
[1:19:38] see
[1:19:39] it had to be god come down
[1:19:42] in the
[1:19:43] by his spirit the quickening power and
[1:19:45] he comes to the tabernacle that he has
[1:19:49] prepared
[1:19:50] according to his word you see this is
[1:19:52] why when you reach back to moses and
[1:19:54] moses is given a pattern on how to make
[1:19:57] the tabernacle it wasn't his idea it was
[1:20:00] god's idea
[1:20:02] so when god came on the scene and filled
[1:20:05] that tabernacle that was god saying now
[1:20:08] what was in my mind that has been spoken
[1:20:11] is now become manifested god is
[1:20:14] vindicating the revelation that was
[1:20:17] revealed to moses so it wasn't moses
[1:20:20] pattern
[1:20:21] it was god's pattern
[1:20:25] but we could preach it right down in our
[1:20:26] homes marriages everything else if you
[1:20:28] want god to come you operate according
[1:20:31] to his pattern
[1:20:34] godly god is moved when he sees his word
[1:20:38] that you see why the bride will be taken
[1:20:40] away in rapturing glory is because he's
[1:20:43] coming to what his word where the bride
[1:20:45] has come into the pattern of the word of
[1:20:48] that same pattern of the word that was
[1:20:50] delivered there on the day of pentecost
[1:20:52] and the same spirit of god that calls
[1:20:55] back the dew the dove calling who who
[1:20:58] who and brother rem says it becomes to
[1:21:00] that place to welcome back the lord
[1:21:03] jesus christ to take us from here in
[1:21:05] rapturing grace
[1:21:07] who has made us he has made us
[1:21:10] we're his workmanship we haven't put
[1:21:12] ourselves this way but it's yielding to
[1:21:15] the pattern of his word by his spirit
[1:21:18] that brings us in position like it did
[1:21:20] for elijah and the fire came down it's
[1:21:23] the same way for rapturing grace in our
[1:21:25] life what do i have to do brother samuel
[1:21:27] just keep yielding to the pattern
[1:21:30] amen
[1:21:32] the vision is sure i know it sure
[1:21:35] just as sure as the brown bear was there
[1:21:37] right the bam tells us that in the
[1:21:39] message countdown it was sure but you
[1:21:41] but it but he missed it because he
[1:21:44] wasn't where god told him to be
[1:21:47] that was an example for you and i you
[1:21:49] know i read that to you some thursdays
[1:21:50] ago
[1:21:51] this god that's why the rapture is a
[1:21:54] sure thing
[1:21:57] what must i do be in the place that god
[1:21:59] has us to be
[1:22:01] where is that in christ
[1:22:03] in christ
[1:22:06] amen so the greatest event that would
[1:22:08] take place would happen
[1:22:11] down at the river jordan
[1:22:14] here where the tabernacle here where the
[1:22:16] the vessel
[1:22:17] is surrendered and and and the spirit of
[1:22:20] god
[1:22:21] drawing
[1:22:22] upon the lamb of god remember it was the
[1:22:25] spirit of god that sought him out is
[1:22:28] that right
[1:22:30] brahman said it sought him out in
[1:22:31] perfect obedience it was the same
[1:22:33] quickening spirit that began to seek him
[1:22:35] out it began to draw him into this time
[1:22:39] into this place why it's time it's time
[1:22:42] for a further stepping in to that place
[1:22:45] of the word that's to be fulfilled and
[1:22:47] to be served in that hour there had
[1:22:49] already been the fulfillment of a virgin
[1:22:52] shall conceive is that right
[1:22:54] mary was as a seed of abraham a royal
[1:22:57] seed she believed what the angel said
[1:23:00] and just simply stood there upon the
[1:23:02] word that was spoken to her and god
[1:23:05] brought the word to pass in her life
[1:23:07] is that right then we find that here
[1:23:09] here stands the lord jesus and now here
[1:23:12] he is and the place of that of the word
[1:23:15] that's to be fulfilled the purpose of
[1:23:17] his coming now how the holy spirit has
[1:23:20] drawn him into this place and he walks
[1:23:22] down to the river jordan to be baptized
[1:23:25] of john
[1:23:27] why because he's to be the sacrificial
[1:23:30] lamb
[1:23:32] the lamb's got to be washed before it
[1:23:33] can ever be
[1:23:34] offered he didn't come to be baptized
[1:23:37] like you and i because he had to repent
[1:23:39] no he didn't have to repent
[1:23:41] he was the virgin-born son of the living
[1:23:43] god
[1:23:45] is that right he also came there because
[1:23:48] before the high priest can ever enter in
[1:23:50] to his service he's got to be washed and
[1:23:53] anointed by the prophet
[1:23:55] is that right so all of these things you
[1:23:58] see this isn't man's doing it's god
[1:24:01] arranging it what was a word
[1:24:04] that was then a vision now is becoming
[1:24:08] material and the places for where the
[1:24:10] glasses and the handkerchief and all
[1:24:12] those parts are to be god is
[1:24:14] orchestrating it all into its place
[1:24:19] what did the lord jesus have to do he
[1:24:20] just yielded
[1:24:22] amen
[1:24:23] don't worry this doesn't mean i'm going
[1:24:24] to be much longer the engine just got a
[1:24:26] little warm
[1:24:29] it felt a little good to me there for a
[1:24:30] while and
[1:24:33] but you know the greatest event that
[1:24:34] that took place
[1:24:36] i want you to listen to this
[1:24:38] in the message breach the breach brother
[1:24:41] brown sounds the sound he says
[1:24:43] there was a required a kinsmen redeemer
[1:24:47] and the kinsmen redeemer must be born of
[1:24:50] the human race
[1:24:52] here that leaves us on a limb
[1:24:56] why because nobody was worthy
[1:25:00] watch what he says but let me
[1:25:02] sound the trumpet to you
[1:25:06] this is not a church trumpet
[1:25:09] a church trumpet calls you to a church
[1:25:12] calls you to a man calls you to an idea
[1:25:16] this is not a church trumpet
[1:25:19] but sound the trumpet oh my
[1:25:23] and when the trumpet sounds it brings
[1:25:25] disturbance
[1:25:27] it brings war
[1:25:29] it brings interruption
[1:25:31] but to the believer oh my there's
[1:25:34] something greater than even all of the
[1:25:36] requirements that it's calling for to
[1:25:38] separate from father mother sister
[1:25:40] brother everything else there's a
[1:25:42] greater call that's going on and to the
[1:25:45] bride of jesus christ as a son and
[1:25:47] daughter of god what they are hearing is
[1:25:49] this is exactly what i've been longing
[1:25:52] for my whole life
[1:25:55] why because you are a part of the word
[1:25:59] that have been sounded in this hour
[1:26:02] because this word holds the very
[1:26:05] manifestation of the character and
[1:26:08] position in christ of who you really are
[1:26:13] that's why you can't get enough of the
[1:26:15] word
[1:26:16] sure we look at the word sometimes and
[1:26:18] say god help me lord help me to live in
[1:26:21] lord we look at it but you see there's a
[1:26:24] yearning there's a drawing on your life
[1:26:26] this word means more to you than
[1:26:29] anything else it means more than any
[1:26:32] relationship any friendship it comes to
[1:26:35] a place that anything that rises against
[1:26:38] the sounding of this trumpet you forsake
[1:26:41] it
[1:26:43] why this is your inheritance
[1:26:45] [Applause]
[1:26:47] oh
[1:26:48] my you don't go from slavery into
[1:26:51] slavery
[1:26:52] jubilee is not forcing you and beating
[1:26:55] you and
[1:26:56] this
[1:26:56] that's not the jubilee it's simply the
[1:26:59] sounding
[1:27:00] of the trumpet that it resonates down in
[1:27:03] the depths of the believer
[1:27:09] remember the example
[1:27:11] and i don't remember who it was but
[1:27:13] they gave the
[1:27:15] a book to the person they worked with
[1:27:19] and the person read the book and said
[1:27:22] that man called me a crow
[1:27:27] and the other the brother said it's
[1:27:29] funny when i read it call me an eagle
[1:27:33] [Applause]
[1:27:37] but samuel for some reason sometimes i
[1:27:39] hear a i hear about a crow
[1:27:41] but what's your heart say
[1:27:44] come on now let's pin this devil down
[1:27:46] amen
[1:27:48] brother samuel he tells me that that
[1:27:50] ain't god telling you that
[1:27:52] what must i do go by the desire that's
[1:27:55] in your heart
[1:27:57] the desire that's in your heart let you
[1:27:59] know
[1:28:00] that you are not a crow
[1:28:02] but you are an ego of the living god
[1:28:07] you've got a desire on the inside to
[1:28:10] serve god
[1:28:15] let me sound the trumpet to you the
[1:28:17] virgin birth produced the product
[1:28:20] the virgin birth produced our kinsmen
[1:28:23] redeemer
[1:28:24] none other but the almighty god become
[1:28:27] emmanuel one of us emmanuel the kinsman
[1:28:30] redeemer was met so you see how god
[1:28:34] makes a requirement and there's nothing
[1:28:37] we can do
[1:28:39] but then grace steps in and overshadows
[1:28:41] that law and produces the product
[1:28:47] i might just jump ahead just for a
[1:28:48] little bit so that i can so i identify
[1:28:51] even this what we just read
[1:28:53] you might look at it or anybody else
[1:28:55] could say well it's been preached down
[1:28:57] through time that jesus is the kinsman
[1:28:59] redeemer that's been preached and that's
[1:29:01] been preached and it has been preached
[1:29:04] there's continually been a sounding out
[1:29:06] oh this is the day of atonement the lord
[1:29:08] jesus christ paid the debt for our sins
[1:29:11] he paid the debt but you see there must
[1:29:13] come a sounding of jubilee that's not
[1:29:17] just causing us to look back in in a
[1:29:20] sense of where then we come into a
[1:29:23] church idea where a person can repent
[1:29:26] but never going on any further to a
[1:29:28] place of where they experience real true
[1:29:32] liberty and become yoked with the word
[1:29:34] of god so there had to come a sounding
[1:29:37] of the trumpet in this hour that was not
[1:29:40] tied to denominational theories of man
[1:29:45] this is why god could not open up the
[1:29:49] seven seals inside of a denomination
[1:29:53] he had to open them outside are you with
[1:29:56] me
[1:29:57] this is why coming out going in god
[1:30:00] could not open the seven seals in that
[1:30:03] of a denomination he had to open it
[1:30:05] outside
[1:30:06] and outside of the nomination outside of
[1:30:09] their theories outside of their thoughts
[1:30:11] god sounded forth his word and no there
[1:30:14] were many people who stood right around
[1:30:17] it set right behind it on the platform
[1:30:19] but it never had a meaning to their life
[1:30:22] i'm just going to tell something as it's
[1:30:24] coming to me right now
[1:30:27] one of the brothers when i was in
[1:30:29] arizona reminded me of this and i
[1:30:30] thought you know i forgot a little bit
[1:30:32] about that
[1:30:33] but you're aware when brother branham
[1:30:35] when he preaches what house will you
[1:30:37] build me
[1:30:38] and he preaches it at brother perry
[1:30:40] green's dedication brother brother brown
[1:30:42] gets up you know he's exhorting the
[1:30:43] people and and where we're at to me it's
[1:30:45] a very i to me it's a very prophetic
[1:30:47] message because it's a it's calling to
[1:30:49] us as children of god what house will
[1:30:51] you build me
[1:30:53] right he wasn't only dealing with uh uh
[1:30:56] uh uh the full
[1:30:58] uh
[1:30:59] working as a body in the local body yet
[1:31:00] brother branham speaks about that but
[1:31:02] he's dealing with that our lives must
[1:31:05] bear the flame of the hour
[1:31:07] then brother adam makes a statement and
[1:31:09] he says now i'm going to jack morris but
[1:31:11] he said you know brother jack doesn't
[1:31:12] see this message
[1:31:14] he said but i'm going to go down there
[1:31:16] he said i'm not going to preach doctrine
[1:31:17] he said but however he said
[1:31:19] if god leads me to do something i'll go
[1:31:22] ahead and do it now you're aware of
[1:31:23] those messages in 1965 in november
[1:31:27] on the wings of a snow white dove
[1:31:29] invisible union of the bride of christ
[1:31:31] i've heard but now i see i i know i'm
[1:31:33] forgetting one in there
[1:31:37] now
[1:31:38] you hear brother branham on one of those
[1:31:39] messages it might be on the wings of a
[1:31:41] snow white dove i can't remember exactly
[1:31:42] but you hear brother brown talking about
[1:31:44] how
[1:31:45] brother jack moore came to his room and
[1:31:46] brother branham wasn't in the room and
[1:31:48] brother jack moore got the wrong room
[1:31:49] and he's like my what what's going on
[1:31:51] you know what what's going on here you
[1:31:53] know and he's not even in the right room
[1:31:54] and and so they don't end up meeting and
[1:31:57] brother bram stands on the platform he
[1:31:58] said well brother jack you can you can
[1:32:00] take me out for a steak dinner another
[1:32:01] time the reason
[1:32:03] brother jack moore was coming is because
[1:32:05] they weren't going to let him preach no
[1:32:06] more
[1:32:09] but god had other plans
[1:32:13] [Applause]
[1:32:14] god had other plans
[1:32:18] amen you see even though others and look
[1:32:21] we don't look down on anybody because
[1:32:23] they can't see it
[1:32:25] because if there's no inheritance that's
[1:32:27] calling to them
[1:32:29] then there's nowhere to go
[1:32:31] but this this causes you see this is why
[1:32:34] this word doesn't call us to a station
[1:32:37] it calls us to our inheritance there's
[1:32:39] no stopping for you and i you might say
[1:32:41] brother samuel i just seem like that
[1:32:43] then i can't get content well you're
[1:32:45] content in that christ himself has
[1:32:48] changed your life but there's something
[1:32:50] moving within you that desires to be
[1:32:53] closer to be closer to be more like him
[1:32:56] and the word comes to you and it stirs
[1:32:58] up your life what is it you are being
[1:33:00] called by the spirit of god through the
[1:33:03] word to that other land you can't stop
[1:33:10] hallelujah you can't stop
[1:33:17] hallelujah
[1:33:20] so where are we now
[1:33:22] as we think of this here where are we
[1:33:24] now
[1:33:27] in luke 4 i'm going to read from here
[1:33:29] and
[1:33:31] try to bring this down to a place
[1:33:35] you see the scriptures
[1:33:39] brother brown would say it over and over
[1:33:40] when he preaches birth pains and this
[1:33:42] day this scripture is fulfilled you've
[1:33:44] heard him say it in other places every
[1:33:46] scripture has a compound
[1:33:48] meaning is that right
[1:33:52] so brother brown picks this up and he's
[1:33:54] reading this here in luke chapter 4
[1:33:57] verse 14.
[1:34:00] jesus returned in the power of the
[1:34:02] spirit into galilee and there went out
[1:34:04] of fame of him throughout all the region
[1:34:05] round about
[1:34:06] and he taught in their synagogues being
[1:34:08] glorified of all when he came to
[1:34:11] nazareth where he had been brought up
[1:34:13] and as his custom was he went into the
[1:34:16] synagogue on the sabbath day and stood
[1:34:19] up for to read
[1:34:20] so jesus he was the word made flesh
[1:34:23] is that right and he went to church
[1:34:26] there was delivered unto him
[1:34:29] the book of the prophet isaiah i'm sorry
[1:34:32] i don't believe that this was by
[1:34:34] coincidence
[1:34:37] the priest might have said well i was
[1:34:39] going to read out of jeremiah but i was
[1:34:41] pulled to isaiah
[1:34:43] even though the priest couldn't
[1:34:44] understand what was taking place it was
[1:34:47] god directing it at that moment
[1:34:52] are you missing me
[1:34:53] and that was delivered unto him the book
[1:34:56] of prophet the prophet isaiah notice he
[1:34:58] didn't go get it it was delivered to him
[1:35:01] remember when brother branham stood
[1:35:02] there in the message birth pains
[1:35:04] looking through the scripture
[1:35:07] brother graham was asking and why
[1:35:10] that don't sound right that's that's not
[1:35:12] the right verse and he's trying to read
[1:35:13] that out of there and
[1:35:15] no brother jack what verse is that was
[1:35:17] how are they telling him 16 luke 6 you
[1:35:19] know john 16 21 well yeah certainly
[1:35:21] that's exactly right and brother brown
[1:35:23] turns and he's looking well then brother
[1:35:25] brown goes right well that's not it i
[1:35:27] tell you he said i don't know what's
[1:35:28] going on he said there's been a misprint
[1:35:30] in this bible yep sure the world there's
[1:35:32] been a misprint
[1:35:34] and here comes bishop stanley
[1:35:39] representing
[1:35:40] the church the church had held the word
[1:35:44] all that time
[1:35:46] and he takes his bible and he tells
[1:35:50] the prophet
[1:35:51] just be be still my son
[1:35:54] god will show you something here
[1:35:57] you see what's happening it's a repeat
[1:36:00] of luke 4.
[1:36:02] but luke 4
[1:36:03] jesus when he read this he stopped right
[1:36:06] in the middle of isaiah 61 he stopped in
[1:36:09] the place before it read of the second
[1:36:12] coming or judgment why that was not the
[1:36:15] position in the first coming to be
[1:36:17] fulfilled
[1:36:19] but in this hour
[1:36:21] amen it's calling to jubilee
[1:36:24] and judgment is here
[1:36:26] judgment is coming
[1:36:28] let me finish reading here he found the
[1:36:31] place
[1:36:32] where it was written
[1:36:34] the spirit of the lord is upon can you
[1:36:36] you imagine this he's reading the word
[1:36:40] but it's not just reading it
[1:36:42] it's happening
[1:36:44] the spirit of the lord is upon me he's
[1:36:47] declaring
[1:36:49] what has been prophesied
[1:36:52] is now
[1:36:53] taking place
[1:36:54] [Music]
[1:36:56] what was something to come now is
[1:37:01] the spirit of the lord is upon me you
[1:37:04] see how he could declare his position in
[1:37:07] the word almighty when the spirit of god
[1:37:09] it comes upon you this is what it brings
[1:37:12] you can declare yourself in the word and
[1:37:14] say i know
[1:37:16] that my life it lines up with the word
[1:37:18] my desire on the inside it's jesus
[1:37:21] christ this is this is life to me this
[1:37:24] hasn't just been something that's given
[1:37:26] me good morality he is my life i am his
[1:37:31] son i am his daughter the spirit
[1:37:34] of the lord is upon me who's to me the
[1:37:38] me is the son and daughter of god on the
[1:37:42] inside
[1:37:45] because he
[1:37:47] hath anointed me
[1:37:50] to preach the gospel to the poor
[1:37:52] he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[1:37:56] to preach deliverance to the captives
[1:38:00] and recovering of sight to the blind
[1:38:03] to senate liberty them
[1:38:06] that are bruised
[1:38:07] to preach the acceptable year
[1:38:10] of the lord
[1:38:13] and he closed the book
[1:38:15] gave it again to the minister and sat
[1:38:17] down
[1:38:18] and the eyes of all them were in the
[1:38:19] synagogue were fastened on him and he
[1:38:21] began to say unto them this day
[1:38:24] is this scripture fulfilled
[1:38:27] in your
[1:38:28] ears what was it the trumpet was
[1:38:32] sounding
[1:38:35] what was the trumpet it was the word
[1:38:38] delivered by the spirit of god that was
[1:38:41] quick in there in that moment and it was
[1:38:43] declaring what you have heard you now
[1:38:47] see it is standing right here before you
[1:38:50] this scripture that was word is now
[1:38:53] standing in flesh before you what was he
[1:38:56] declaring it was a transition from law
[1:39:00] to grace because the law can never make
[1:39:02] the word flesh but grace makes the word
[1:39:05] flesh
[1:39:07] that's why you and i are trophies of
[1:39:10] grace
[1:39:15] everything was met and satisfied in our
[1:39:18] passover the lord jesus christ
[1:39:20] he is that true atonement you see the
[1:39:22] sounding as we said moments ago when
[1:39:24] brother remember said let me sound that
[1:39:26] true trumpet to you remember
[1:39:28] i know i'm covering some ground here but
[1:39:31] in leviticus 16 where it speaks of the
[1:39:33] feast of the lord the passover is
[1:39:36] offered it's the passover lamb
[1:39:39] that is offered in that time it's the
[1:39:41] offering of that lamb that invites and
[1:39:43] makes way for the holy ghost to come
[1:39:46] the day of atonement when you read it in
[1:39:49] leviticus 23 it is not speaking of the
[1:39:53] fresh killing of the lamb but it
[1:39:55] actually the day of atonement is
[1:39:57] pointing back to that passover lamb that
[1:40:00] was already killed you see that's why
[1:40:03] the word the message that you and i have
[1:40:05] received it's not a new message this is
[1:40:07] why the opening of the seven seals is
[1:40:10] not something outside of the book it is
[1:40:12] what is inside of the book to where that
[1:40:15] satan has wanted to sew up that life and
[1:40:18] a real true experience with the lord
[1:40:20] jesus christ but god himself reserved a
[1:40:24] life and a vessel according to the word
[1:40:26] in this hour to sound out to you and i
[1:40:29] that's what the real gospel message is
[1:40:32] it is a message of loosening a message
[1:40:36] that calls us back to the true atonement
[1:40:39] we're not called to a church we're not
[1:40:41] gathered around a personality
[1:40:45] no sir the sounding of this word does
[1:40:48] not lift up a man the sounding of this
[1:40:51] word exalts jesus christ for he said if
[1:40:54] i be lifted up i will draw i will cause
[1:40:57] an inward impelling draw o men unto
[1:41:02] me
[1:41:05] men binds men to men
[1:41:09] under the spirit of fear
[1:41:13] amen but the love of god don't bind us
[1:41:15] it sets us free
[1:41:17] and love it don't bind us it unites us
[1:41:24] oh my how accurate the scripture is
[1:41:26] brother branham would say i don't i
[1:41:28] don't have this on there
[1:41:31] how the lord jesus stopped at that point
[1:41:33] in isaiah 61.
[1:41:38] he stopped right before
[1:41:40] that part of announcing of judgment
[1:41:42] there was a part that had to be
[1:41:44] fulfilled you see it was declaring at
[1:41:46] that time
[1:41:47] that the acceptable year the jubilee is
[1:41:50] on and the blood had not even been shed
[1:41:52] yet
[1:41:54] but you see what was taking place
[1:41:56] it was a manifestation
[1:41:58] the second adam was manifesting to the
[1:42:01] sons and daughters of god what they fell
[1:42:03] from
[1:42:04] they weren't back in there to see what
[1:42:06] took place in eden they weren't there
[1:42:08] when adam stood there and controlled the
[1:42:10] elements and said when stopping and this
[1:42:13] and that they weren't there to see it
[1:42:15] but god came down the inheritance of his
[1:42:18] own life of what belonged to a son and
[1:42:21] daughter of god you see it wasn't a
[1:42:23] position in a natural land it was life
[1:42:26] god's own life that we fell from and
[1:42:30] that life came down in an earthen vessel
[1:42:34] what was it doing it was declaring the
[1:42:37] time of jubilee is at hand
[1:42:45] that's what god
[1:42:46] did and is doing in this hour
[1:42:49] through the ministry of malachi 4.
[1:42:52] luke 17 and 30 revelations 10 7 it was
[1:42:56] the declaring the evidence of life
[1:42:58] brother ram stands there in this day the
[1:43:00] scriptures fulfilled he said it's not me
[1:43:01] that's doing this it's god performing
[1:43:04] his own word that he promised
[1:43:08] so what is our faith building you know
[1:43:10] how it is if somebody you know you've
[1:43:11] seen people heard of people that oh so
[1:43:13] and so pray for me they'll follow that
[1:43:14] person to the ends of the earth it won a
[1:43:17] bit more that person that healed you
[1:43:18] than nothing
[1:43:20] it's faith
[1:43:23] are you with me so in order to have real
[1:43:26] faith it takes a living god to come on
[1:43:29] the scene because we'll not make it by
[1:43:31] our own faith a church faith it's got to
[1:43:34] be the faith of the son of god who loved
[1:43:36] me and gave himself for me it must be
[1:43:39] that faith that comes into the church of
[1:43:41] the living god
[1:43:43] is that right
[1:43:45] oh glory brethren said think of it the
[1:43:47] messiah
[1:43:48] standing in the platform to identify
[1:43:51] himself with the word of promise for
[1:43:53] that age
[1:43:55] how strange the messiah standing up
[1:43:57] before the church and precious words
[1:43:59] went out of his mouth to preach the
[1:44:01] acceptable year of the lord
[1:44:04] he was the word made flesh to represent
[1:44:07] the jubilee was on
[1:44:12] i'm telling you you don't ever read
[1:44:13] about demon manifestation until the
[1:44:15] word's been made flesh
[1:44:18] when the word was made flesh what did it
[1:44:20] do it roused up demon manifestation you
[1:44:22] have legion you have the rest of them
[1:44:24] but you know what it is is the word is
[1:44:26] there to proclaim jubilee and there's a
[1:44:29] there's a heart that even though with
[1:44:31] legion being so far away but there was
[1:44:33] what he heard the woman with the issue
[1:44:35] of blood she heard blind bartimaeus he
[1:44:38] heard he was had was blinded what was it
[1:44:41] faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[1:44:43] the word of god they heard about it it
[1:44:46] stirred something in there that was
[1:44:48] greater that was greater than all the
[1:44:50] demons that had legion that and that
[1:44:52] which was when the heart of that woman
[1:44:54] it was greater than her issue of blood
[1:44:56] that which the blindness of blind blind
[1:44:58] bartimaeus hit with the stirring in his
[1:45:00] heart was greater than all the blindness
[1:45:03] that was about his life
[1:45:05] god was present
[1:45:07] to loosen
[1:45:11] liberty
[1:45:13] had come
[1:45:15] and let me say
[1:45:16] liberty
[1:45:17] has come
[1:45:20] freedom
[1:45:21] is here amen
[1:45:24] and let me just say not only here
[1:45:27] but here
[1:45:31] amen let me just bring it down now
[1:45:34] it was calling man that was under the
[1:45:35] first representation
[1:45:38] of the first adam
[1:45:40] that was condemnation but he was the
[1:45:42] second adam
[1:45:43] calling them to life
[1:45:46] now there was many religious men in that
[1:45:48] day
[1:45:49] when they heard it
[1:45:51] beelzebub
[1:45:53] ah fortune teller
[1:45:55] oh
[1:45:56] he's taking away our crowds
[1:46:01] now
[1:46:02] they could say they were seeds of
[1:46:04] abraham naturally speaking they were
[1:46:06] right
[1:46:08] they could say we've got inheritance
[1:46:10] right here some levites you know levites
[1:46:12] didn't have any inheritance they only
[1:46:13] were given the cities and things like
[1:46:14] that
[1:46:15] they could go through all that
[1:46:17] but they couldn't hear the true
[1:46:20] inheritance
[1:46:24] they couldn't hear it
[1:46:25] they called it every foul name
[1:46:29] is that right
[1:46:30] but then you take a woman
[1:46:34] that nobody wanted nothing to do with
[1:46:35] her that's right
[1:46:37] she had to go to the well it wasn't a
[1:46:39] convenient time i'd imagine
[1:46:41] it wasn't a choice time to be going to
[1:46:43] the well if you know what i mean
[1:46:45] you wouldn't want to be a one even if
[1:46:46] you were in desperate need at that time
[1:46:48] and maybe you were a woman it was
[1:46:49] virtuous you'd say i ain't going to well
[1:46:51] at that time because i don't want
[1:46:52] nothing to be thought about me
[1:46:57] but jesus said i've got need
[1:47:01] amen
[1:47:03] i got neat amen
[1:47:06] jesus came down to the well on a time
[1:47:08] that
[1:47:09] was not the most choice time by that of
[1:47:11] the world
[1:47:14] but it was in
[1:47:15] god's time amen
[1:47:18] everything was lining up we could say
[1:47:20] like this the stars were lining up
[1:47:22] everything was just lining up and he
[1:47:24] begins to come down there and they begin
[1:47:26] to speak and begins to talk to her and
[1:47:28] she begins to rehearse
[1:47:30] certain promises that she's known
[1:47:34] she has questions
[1:47:37] here stands the answer
[1:47:39] to every question
[1:47:41] here stands the satisfier to every
[1:47:43] longing
[1:47:46] little did she know
[1:47:48] she was going to go to that well that
[1:47:50] day
[1:47:52] and when she left
[1:47:53] she'd never be the same
[1:47:57] amazing
[1:47:58] she was all covered up with sin where
[1:47:59] nobody would have touched her they
[1:48:01] wouldn't have invited her didn't want to
[1:48:02] be seen around her
[1:48:06] but jesus came
[1:48:09] what happened to her when he said i am
[1:48:12] he that speaketh unto thee
[1:48:17] all the scriptures and all the promises
[1:48:19] she had
[1:48:20] and he came like the laundry ticket and
[1:48:22] gave her an experience according to the
[1:48:24] word
[1:48:25] she just didn't have the word anymore
[1:48:26] she had an experience that was matched
[1:48:29] in the word
[1:48:30] she left there and she began to proclaim
[1:48:33] come see a man
[1:48:36] that hath told me
[1:48:38] everything i ever done
[1:48:43] the rest of the religious at that day
[1:48:46] what did they do
[1:48:47] they crucified him
[1:48:50] they didn't want nothing to do with him
[1:48:52] we're talking about the people who knew
[1:48:53] the scriptures i'm talking about the
[1:48:55] people that on sunday schools charts
[1:48:57] charts had every gold sticker are you
[1:49:00] hearing me
[1:49:01] it's not to know the word is life
[1:49:05] it's not to know the testimonies of the
[1:49:07] prophetess life
[1:49:09] it's not to know the message as far as
[1:49:10] just knowing the quotes that's not it
[1:49:12] right it's to know him
[1:49:15] because when you know him then you've
[1:49:17] got everything amen
[1:49:19] he revealed he's right there to break
[1:49:22] off little by little by little as we
[1:49:24] have need of it
[1:49:26] lord i i don't understand this and here
[1:49:28] he is oh
[1:49:30] they're asking for revelation
[1:49:34] well who's the only one who can reveal
[1:49:36] only he can
[1:49:38] so when you're asking him lord
[1:49:39] would you reveal yourself more to me
[1:49:43] oh that draws him near
[1:49:45] he loves to come
[1:49:47] and reveal
[1:49:48] himself and his word and he just keeps
[1:49:51] breaking off
[1:49:52] peace after peace
[1:49:54] after peace after peace
[1:49:59] amen let's close
[1:50:06] there was a decision brother branham
[1:50:08] says that in this this day the
[1:50:10] scripture's fulfilled he ties us into
[1:50:11] that jubilee
[1:50:13] he says
[1:50:16] when the gospel is preached
[1:50:19] the acceptable time the time of jubilee
[1:50:21] anybody no matter who you are what color
[1:50:23] you are what denomination you belong to
[1:50:25] how far you've stooped in sin or what's
[1:50:27] wrong with you you can go free when you
[1:50:29] hear
[1:50:30] the gospel trumpets sound out
[1:50:33] you
[1:50:34] are
[1:50:35] free
[1:50:36] see the word isn't calling
[1:50:38] and saying you can be
[1:50:40] it's declaring
[1:50:42] you're free
[1:50:43] why the blood has already
[1:50:46] been shed
[1:50:48] the price for liberty has already been
[1:50:51] paid
[1:50:52] then then what must i do have faith
[1:50:55] in what he speaks
[1:50:58] unto you
[1:51:00] remember
[1:51:01] you come to heal up heal the
[1:51:03] brokenhearted
[1:51:04] bind him up he came to heal
[1:51:07] came to man minister healing
[1:51:10] to our lives
[1:51:12] so
[1:51:14] you can have the healing in our soul
[1:51:16] which is the greatest healing of all
[1:51:17] because you the soul then can never be
[1:51:19] sick again
[1:51:20] but some but you get sick in your body
[1:51:23] sometimes you get weary in your mind
[1:51:28] sometimes you get you get you get down
[1:51:29] you can get discouraged
[1:51:31] but remember part of this jubilee
[1:51:34] is you've got a right
[1:51:36] to healing
[1:51:38] you've got a right
[1:51:40] to joy
[1:51:41] that's right
[1:51:42] the bible says happy
[1:51:45] are the people who know the lord is that
[1:51:48] right
[1:51:51] a merry spirit
[1:51:54] it's like medicine
[1:51:55] that's the book of proverbs right
[1:51:58] but it talked about
[1:52:01] i don't remember the exact words but how
[1:52:03] you know
[1:52:04] a spirit that
[1:52:06] uh i don't remember the words forgive me
[1:52:09] but it's that which is the opposite that
[1:52:11] of mary it driveth the bones
[1:52:18] see this says exactly
[1:52:20] to think this is this is why
[1:52:23] god's desire through his word he god
[1:52:25] don't put us up somewhere and we're just
[1:52:29] but the word itself even as it's being
[1:52:31] spoken
[1:52:33] our hearts are being lifted
[1:52:35] are being stirred
[1:52:37] is being encouraged
[1:52:40] any darkness or doubt that's tried to
[1:52:42] encroach in upon your life it's being
[1:52:44] dispelled
[1:52:46] how is that happening
[1:52:48] faith rises
[1:52:50] to believe what he is saying concerning
[1:52:54] you
[1:52:55] it's god letting us know
[1:52:58] our inheritance
[1:53:00] he's letting us know this is what
[1:53:02] belongs to you you see there's there's
[1:53:04] nothing that that you have to
[1:53:07] settle for there's nothing short of full
[1:53:10] deliverance there's nothing short of
[1:53:12] full healing
[1:53:13] everything that god has for you the
[1:53:15] maturing in our life every part
[1:53:18] that pertains to us
[1:53:21] in our inheritance that god has brought
[1:53:23] us to
[1:53:24] we are to occupy and we
[1:53:28] shall occupy every part that he's called
[1:53:32] us to
[1:53:35] so what must i do
[1:53:37] get your eyes off of yourself
[1:53:40] don't put your eyes on yourself the
[1:53:42] sounding of the trumpet is to put such
[1:53:45] an awareness in our heart
[1:53:47] that he
[1:53:49] has become all things
[1:53:51] to us
[1:53:53] he has freely
[1:53:55] given us all things
[1:53:58] this is why that a person that's in need
[1:54:00] of the holy ghost
[1:54:02] you're not asking god for something that
[1:54:04] don't belong to you
[1:54:06] you're asking god for what belongs to
[1:54:09] you
[1:54:12] you're not in a stranger's house i mean
[1:54:13] if you came in my house probably you
[1:54:15] know you'd be polite and say bro sam i'd
[1:54:17] like to have a little bit of peanut
[1:54:18] butter i got a lot of that brother
[1:54:20] vivian i like peanut butter you could
[1:54:22] say brother sammy i'd like to have some
[1:54:23] peanut butter see
[1:54:24] you can ask me about that but what's
[1:54:26] different is is that when you know
[1:54:28] you're in a place you can go and get
[1:54:30] that peanut butter
[1:54:33] you're in a place
[1:54:35] where you can go
[1:54:36] not as a beggar
[1:54:38] not as a stranger
[1:54:40] brother samuel i really need healing you
[1:54:41] don't got to beg him for it that's right
[1:54:44] you know how much we pound it ain't how
[1:54:47] much we yell and then
[1:54:49] it's do we believe
[1:54:52] do we
[1:54:53] believe
[1:54:54] and if we believe we shall
[1:54:56] receive
[1:54:58] amen we've been called back to we've
[1:55:00] been called to an inheritance to possess
[1:55:03] all things that have been given to us as
[1:55:06] a believer
[1:55:07] in jesus christ
[1:55:10] so no matter what it is that if the
[1:55:12] enemy is trying to remember it you know
[1:55:14] this you've heard this not only it's
[1:55:16] been said across this platform whether
[1:55:17] it's been me or whatever other many
[1:55:20] other brothers has come across you and
[1:55:21] you've heard it other places too
[1:55:24] if you say the devil's telling me he's a
[1:55:25] liar
[1:55:26] just stop listening to him
[1:55:29] he might sound like he has a valid
[1:55:31] argument but he's a liar
[1:55:33] there's a greater voice
[1:55:35] than his voice
[1:55:38] he's a liar
[1:55:40] the blood
[1:55:42] proclaims
[1:55:43] freedom
[1:55:46] it proclaims liberty you've got a right
[1:55:49] to walk every day in your life with joy
[1:55:53] what do i do turn down
[1:55:56] turn his voice down and listen to god's
[1:55:59] voice have faith in what he has said
[1:56:02] concerning you
[1:56:04] and you'll find
[1:56:06] things that could trouble
[1:56:08] they'll be released
[1:56:10] they'll be released they'll be released
[1:56:12] be let go
[1:56:13] brother ram talks about that blood being
[1:56:15] shed and he said you know
[1:56:17] you're already free
[1:56:19] he said but many times he said people
[1:56:21] are still
[1:56:23] bound by creeds
[1:56:25] by what they think
[1:56:28] now i know throughout this building and
[1:56:30] no matter who will be streaming or any
[1:56:31] of us
[1:56:32] maybe you sat in the denominational
[1:56:33] church and maybe you didn't
[1:56:37] but god still works
[1:56:39] to break us free from our own thinking
[1:56:43] because where many times do we limit is
[1:56:46] in our own thoughts
[1:56:49] is that right
[1:56:50] but the word keeps proclaiming
[1:56:53] you're free
[1:56:55] you're free
[1:56:57] you're free
[1:56:58] is that right
[1:57:00] and it keeps proclaiming that to do what
[1:57:03] it's god moving
[1:57:05] to take
[1:57:07] our thinking we have to give that to him
[1:57:09] is that right we have to give that
[1:57:11] thinking to him because remember as we
[1:57:13] said here i think it was on thursday god
[1:57:15] don't bypass
[1:57:17] the mind and then go to the soul
[1:57:20] spoke the words original seed brother
[1:57:21] ram says you first
[1:57:23] agree with that word and you must accept
[1:57:25] it
[1:57:26] in the womb of your mind
[1:57:29] and it's the word that has life and he
[1:57:31] said then he said the word comes down
[1:57:34] into the soul and that brings new birth
[1:57:39] it's a word birth
[1:57:41] that's a real experience with god
[1:57:44] because a word birth it changes us from
[1:57:45] death unto life
[1:57:48] it brings about a life that now is lived
[1:57:51] by the word to where when the word comes
[1:57:53] across our pathway
[1:57:55] the desire within our life is
[1:57:58] when we're corrected
[1:57:59] be an unto me lord
[1:58:01] forgive me lord
[1:58:02] what is it
[1:58:04] it's that on the inside a desire to line
[1:58:07] up with the word
[1:58:10] amen let's pray
[1:58:12] heavenly father
[1:58:15] lord jesus
[1:58:19] you're you are the ever-present god
[1:58:23] lord declaring
[1:58:25] declaring to us the time the seas and
[1:58:28] the hour
[1:58:29] that we're living
[1:58:32] lord to rehearse it in our hearts
[1:58:35] and to declare to us lord god
[1:58:38] reminding us once again and lord perhaps
[1:58:41] there's some here this morning that
[1:58:44] lord they haven't heard that sound but
[1:58:47] there's a sounding of freedom that goes
[1:58:49] out to their life that lets them know
[1:58:52] that calls them to a place of surrender
[1:58:54] the holy spirit going with
[1:58:56] conviction lord to convict them of their
[1:58:58] wrong
[1:58:59] and to let them know
[1:59:02] there's a better way
[1:59:03] there's a better way
[1:59:05] there's a true way there's a right way
[1:59:09] life is present
[1:59:11] to release them lord
[1:59:14] i pray god if there would be one under
[1:59:15] the sound of my voice
[1:59:18] granted lord may they respond to that
[1:59:20] conviction
[1:59:21] of the holy spirit may they repent may
[1:59:23] they lay their life down
[1:59:25] like that slave that would
[1:59:28] be there in the field and he'd have to
[1:59:30] be working and working and working and
[1:59:32] he was under the voice
[1:59:34] of a master
[1:59:36] that master said do this he had to do it
[1:59:38] do this he had to do it do this even
[1:59:40] things he didn't want to do but the
[1:59:41] master was still making him do it
[1:59:45] but one day
[1:59:48] when they heard that sound
[1:59:52] they could lay down
[1:59:54] whatever tool whatever instrument
[1:59:56] whatever it was in their hand
[1:59:58] and they could walk
[2:00:00] from where they were
[2:00:02] and walk right back home
[2:00:06] what i pray this morning
[2:00:07] if there's one here or
[2:00:11] one streaming lord one that even might
[2:00:13] archive this
[2:00:15] i pray that god that
[2:00:18] it's you

[2:04:04] oh hallelujah
[2:04:06] oh hallelujah
[2:04:08] glory be to god
[2:04:11] oh my i tell you
[2:04:13] just to realize where we're standing
[2:04:14] there there's nothing
[2:04:16] nothing too big for god that's just not
[2:04:19] a statement that's a reality
[2:04:21] there's no circumstance that's too great
[2:04:23] for god
[2:04:25] but just remember this every
[2:04:27] circumstance
[2:04:29] every situation
[2:04:31] is an opportunity
[2:04:33] for god
[2:04:35] to move
[2:04:38] the red sea
[2:04:39] wasn't great enough to stop
[2:04:43] jordan wasn't deep enough or flooded
[2:04:46] enough
[2:04:46] to stop him
[2:04:48] the lions
[2:04:50] weren't great enough to eat daniel
[2:04:53] the fire wasn't great enough to consume
[2:04:55] the hebrew children why
[2:04:58] because of
[2:04:59] god
[2:05:00] because of him
[2:05:02] so there's no circumstance even a
[2:05:04] circumstance that
[2:05:06] we know if thrown in the lion's den hey
[2:05:10] you're gone
[2:05:11] fire
[2:05:12] the man who threw him in the fire were
[2:05:14] consumed
[2:05:16] it was a situation that was greater than
[2:05:19] mortality could stand
[2:05:22] [Music]
[2:05:24] but god showed
[2:05:26] that there's no circumstance
[2:05:28] no situation
[2:05:30] no test
[2:05:31] no trial no obstacle
[2:05:34] that's too great
[2:05:36] for him
[2:05:36] [Music]
[2:05:38] so no matter what it is no matter what
[2:05:40] that need is
[2:05:42] i've given you scripture and we can go
[2:05:43] more and more and more
[2:05:45] but there's no obstacle
[2:05:47] nothing
[2:05:48] that's greater
[2:05:50] than god
[2:05:53] but samia i've got a need in my life
[2:05:55] right now
[2:05:57] why don't you go ahead and speak to that

[2:15:25] something with you uh
[2:15:27] just
[2:15:28] the message of restoration and we heard
[2:15:30] come so
[2:15:32] clear over the pulpit i just wanted to
[2:15:35] share something with you that
[2:15:37] yesterday was a very special
[2:15:39] day for me
[2:15:42] we was able to
[2:15:44] take my mom out fishing yesterday out on
[2:15:47] the lake
[2:15:48] and uh you might say dave that's just a
[2:15:52] a little fishing trip
[2:15:55] but i was trying to remember i think
[2:15:57] it's been five or six years since she's
[2:15:59] been able to go out
[2:16:02] in that time i'm pretty sure there i
[2:16:04] might not get all the facts correct but
[2:16:07] i think we had
[2:16:08] six hip surgeries
[2:16:10] two
[2:16:11] hip total total hip replacements
[2:16:15] two back surgeries that i can remember
[2:16:18] i think she had surgery on her sinuses
[2:16:20] and such
[2:16:24] we had
[2:16:25] two times she was in the hospital with
[2:16:27] kidney failure and chemical imbalance
[2:16:29] and suspend i think
[2:16:32] maybe like two weeks two to three weeks
[2:16:34] in the hospital with with that
[2:16:37] and uh
[2:16:39] one time in
[2:16:40] in icu with the aspiration pneumonia
[2:16:44] was uh was dead on the table and and
[2:16:46] they brought her back
[2:16:48] so was it just
[2:16:50] another fishing trip
[2:16:52] no it was for me it was
[2:16:56] just
[2:16:56] living proof
[2:16:58] we serve
[2:16:59] a god of restoration
[2:17:01] we serve a god of miracles
