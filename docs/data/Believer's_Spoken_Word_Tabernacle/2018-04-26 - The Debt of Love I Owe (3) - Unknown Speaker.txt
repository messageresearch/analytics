========================================

but I'm just trying to try to listen to you know cousin so-and-so because you know I know they're really going through something what you end up finding is it's really not helping them and you can become weary in well-doing anybody ever been weary you know it's Satan's desire and objective the Bible says in the Book of Daniel that that spirit it seeks to wear down the power of the holy people when the windy enemy comes I'll tell you this is why your ear it'd be good to have spiritually spiritually hearing aids yeah when people want to come and say this and say that you just say you turn it off I don't think you're listening to me you got it you got it I don't think you're hearing what I'm saying you got it for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day you know this is Paul's not even talking this about as far as even in the perfection of his own life yet it is but Paul is all of this is about for the body for the body for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory look at this focus while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal and they say lord help me to look beyond help me help me I got both of my hands up my hearts up help me help me because when I see I can see a lot of things before me but but Paul said we're looking to those things which are eternal so he's looking able to look beyond first Corinthians 4:7 for who maketh thee to differ from another and what has thou that thou did it's not receive now if thou didst receive it why does thou glory as if thou has not received it there's nothing we can glory in we have not done anything to receive or merit His grace we glory in him now look at this ye are full now you are rich I was not talking about materially he's speaking of spiritually now ye are full now you are rich I want you to watch this watch this this is the Corinthian church which sometimes people get caught in the in the end in the point of just saying a whole the Corinthian church was a weak church they all had their weak points but Paul if you read carefully in the book of Corinth Paul points out also growth that's taking place in their life by the time it gets to second Corinthians Paul can acknowledge them before others growth look at this my four I think oh wait a minute let me go back you have reigned as kings without us and I would to God you did reign that we may also reign with you you have reigned as kings what God what's he speaking of as Kings or brother Samuel they had all kinds of service no spiritual kings the wire the ministry of the blood of Jesus Christ which has loosened us from our sins he filled us with his spirit and made us to be kings and priests unto a god you are Shh you have a rain now in your life you're raining have spiritual kings you've got a kingdom you've got a domain you've been raised up as sons and daughters of God you're no longer in bondage and we're reigning with you we're not dwelling in your body but the word that was in our hearts is now moving in your life your soul you're rich you'll reigned as kings and we are glad we're glad the dead of love I or for I think that God hath set forth us the Apostles last as it were appointed to death for we are made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to men that's not necessarily a good thing as far as the way the world would look at it it's not necessarily a welcoming thing so much to our flesh to be made a spectacle in other words to be this word means it's like a theater where a theater they would hold plays and when you hold a play in a theater there's acts that are done they're scripts that are handed out you have a certain line and there's a certain way that you have to go and act out this line you're part of the plan and program of God you've got a script to act out it's not just here you act it out out there you act it out among one another act it out and our families act it out in our communities in our life acting out everywhere we go our desire is they may not know my name but let it be that they know a Christian has been here a believer has been here something different about that man or that woman something's never I don't know their name something's different about their you know what that is that's making yourself of no reputation or made of spectacle and that's something not just to the world but brother joy to the Angels the angels are beholding this angels who do not know what redemption is but the Angels are beholding and seeing the glory of God being displayed through mortality to where that the angels think of it when they were getting ready to be cast in the fiery furnace remember the dramatization the Prophet would give and say wormwood said then he go down and I'll drowned it out right the angels are beholding what are they beholding his coming in you and me did you catch that the angels are beholding the coming of the Lord in your life in my life not as corporal body the spiritual the word the black coming Christ the mystery their whole their beholding that coming in you as we're delivered unto death what is it the coming of the Lord surging out were made a spectacle ain't gonna be made no spectacle but when we see this we're made a spectacle unto the world and if the Angels themselves hushed revelations 8:1 the Bible says and when he had opened the Seventh Seal There was silence of this mystery they were so taken back were made a spectacle the world says their foolish their crazy why in the world don't you denounce why don't you how in the world what in the world makes you tick but the Angels this brings the reality of the seals right down in our lives the coming of the Lord and two men we are fools for Christ's sake we not made ourselves odd we don't go out and make ourselves odd we are fools for his sake but ye are wise in Christ we are weak but you are strong ye are honorable but we are despised you're honorable we're despised we're a weak but you're strong it'll seem like an equal trade off ah it just depends on how we're looking at it the dead of love ow I'm weak so you're strong you're weak so I can be strong hey wait up me it's not about you even unto this present hour think about this think about this prophet of God writing this but the joy I don't know if this one he wrote this one it was with big letters cuz you know he talked about that enrolments how i've wrote to you in big letters because his eyes were the same we're always affected after the pillar of fire you would come and go and come and go I don't know but I do know this condition even under this present hour we both hunger and thirst and our naked are buffered and then half no certain dwelling place this Paul is not making this statement known with a 1-800 number below are you with me Paul did not make this statement on a telecast with a 1-800 number sow seed faith money I never forget brother Donnie had told me one he said I remember in Pentecost he said when taking up offerings he told dad and I this is one time he said there was a man he said would get out there he said as a preacher and he'd wear a certain shoes when it was time to take up offering and he would got there glory to God hallelujah and he said in the bottom and that's you it had a bigger hole go to god out of loo why to make the people oh man this guy really needs a good offering sad to say he'll give an account for that if he hadn't already made it a right you know but here's what Paul's not Paul's not saying these things - for somebody to feel sorry for him are you with me friends sometimes this is where we got a dessert that even with situations that there might be things presented to you and I that you or me in our compassion could feel sorry but you've got to discern it by the word don't be drawn away by sympathy or compassion standing upon the word Paul is not trying to play upon their sympathy you see that's one of the things you're going to always say why are you telling me this why are you telling me this you trying to draw me to your side y'all got quiet why are you telling me this everybody's got to assert their point their argument and labor working with our own hands what a what a statement Wow I thought to be in full-time ministry you had to be fully dependent no I already knew that many years ago men told me before so oh you're not full-time yet if I went full-time tell me what I was you see no matter what anybody had ever told me or what anybody ever thought I don't care what people think I don't make decisions based on somebody says I've got a feeling that you know I talked to God just as you talk to God if he has something for me to know tell me over the same out and labor working with our own hands think about this Paul was not grumbling or complaining about this are you it wasn't easy Paul said I work with my own hands being reviled we bless being persecuted we suffer it being defamed we announce it on Facebook you see some folks will never ever say it to your face which they shouldn't do that anyhow but they'll do it on Facebook or all these other things I'm telling you it shows what kind of spirit if people or listen if you love those kind of things and you delight in busyness and all kinds of things you need to be born again that's absolutely what the prophet has said and it's a truth if you delight in that you still love the world can I finish this I only got brother Doug I only got 10 more pages I love brother Doug he always teases me so good to see you tonight brother Doug good to see you I really am well let me just let me just finish this part I mean just someone skip Paul's talking about his bonds in Philippians 1 and in verse 12 brother Brian go right there and then I'm gonna skip a little bit I would you would understand brethren I would you would understand didn't they're wonderful I would you would understand you you need to know what's taking place that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel I wonder how that they were praying there at that time maybe they were praying o God get Paul out of there Lord no doubt they were praying for Paul's deliverance but Paul was letting him know brother and I want you to understand something that this has fallen out to the furtherance of the gospel so that my bonds in Christ wasn't he and bonds in jail yeah but Paul has already put there's a greater bonds bonds in Christ I am where I am because God has ordained me for this hour manifest in all the palace and in all other places I tell you what if their manifest in all the palace and all the other places it surely wasn't because Paul was screaming out get these bonds off of me somebody get me out of here no that wouldn't have been the bonds of Christ that would have been the bonds of complaining of which he could have because in this place was not a nice comfortable place but in the midst of a place to where that even when you look at some of the prisons where Paul himself would dwell to where that he's not even it was not even if I could say it like the prisons and things they have today which would be extreme luxury report could go from one side of the cell to the other to use the bathroom he couldn't even do that he's chained up there was nothing delightful about this but Paul chose to write to you and I the Barnes I'm in is the bonds and many of the Brethren in the Lord waxing confident by my bonds see if Paul would have been complaining how could others have waxed confident by his bonds are much more bold to speak the word without fear verse 18 what then notwithstanding every way whether in pretence or in truth Christ is preached and I therein do rejoice yay and will rejoice for I know that this shall turn into my salvation through your prayer and the supply of the spirit of Jesus Christ according to my earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing shall I be ashamed that with all boldness as always so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body the same body that's always bearing about the dying of the Lord Jesus Christ shall be magnified in my body whether it be by life or by death for to me to live is Christ and to die is gain Philippians 2:14 I am coming down here let me brother Brian moved to verse 25 I just skip a little bit yeah he says I supposed it necessary to send you yep Aphrodite's my brother and companion in labor and fellow soldier but your messenger I thought Paul was the messenger Paul was the messenger of the age but epaphroditus was their messenger he was the local angel to the church who glory be to God see he was a under messenger and he that ministered noticed this and he that ministered to my wants so here is a papri Titus and here Paul is pointing out he ministered to my wants for he longed after you all and was full of heaviness because that ye had heard that he had been sick so notice they had heard the congregation had heard he was sick and then when he heard that they what they had heard concerning his sickness which he almost died he was within heaviness to return to them I asked you who put this in a pepra deines did Paul teach this in him or was this what God said in Jeremiah that I will give you pastors according to my own heart that will teach you in knowledge and understanding with honor just no knowledge we want to have understanding for he longed after you and was full of heaviness because that she had heard that he had been sick for indeed he was sick nigh unto death but God had mercy on him what's what commendation Paul puts here and not on him only but on me also lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow Paul said to lose this man would have brought sorrow Paul can you how can you say that it had to have been you remember they interviewed the brother Graham had with sister Bruce remember that right before the masterpiece remember sister Bruce asked him the question you know she wants to know that she's had an experience she's been filled with the Holy Ghost and brother Bama makes so many mistakes on and on and on she goes and brother Bram she and at the end of it she's remember brother but she's out of heart condition or she's feeling as though she does and she feels like that maybe she's gonna die and brother brems says no sister sister you're you're not gonna die if that's your nerves right but then he prays in prayer and the prayer that brother Branham prays he said God please don't take her she's such an asset to this church what a thing to be said she's such an asset to this church that's what said right here about app aphrodite's he's an asset to what is it because that app afroditi says you know brought Paul this and Rob no no and papri Dittus is operating under the same burden and heart's desire that paul has and that's to see that all men would come to the knowledge and revelation of this mystery I sent him look at this in verse 28 I sent him there for them more carefully that when you see him again no I sent him more carefully I wonder if Paul said if afroditi us it's a five days journey but I want you to take ten to get there but I want to see him but I want you to take ten because be not weary in well-doing you need to be able to do something for him when you get there I sent him the more carefully that when you see him again you may rejoice and that I may be the less sorrowful receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness and holds such in reputation because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death now because Paul had not because the pepero dadís had taken a bunch of overtime but same as going in on a positive note it is he was not 9 to death because he had bit off more than he could chew in order to advance himself this was not about advancing a kingdom of Epaphroditus this was for the work of Christ and Paul could see it that the heart of God that same heart that had moved within Paul's heart was also in epaphroditus for the work of Christ he was mounted it the work of Christ is preaching laboring but remember he was ministering to Paul's wants not regarding his life to supply your lack of service toward me nepal's not putting him down Paul's letting him know you all back there were not able to do for me what he could do but I want to let you know what your messenger I want to let you know what you're a local angel I want to let you know of how he ministered to me and he was nigh unto death I want you to think of this don't get caught on just a Pat Forde itis but to think that same image and that same character if it was caught into the heart of epaphroditus was not that same heart and character caught in the heart of the Philippian believers where they themselves would willingly give themselves for the work of Christ among one another in their local parts and what they could do were things that a Patra Dittus could not do but that's why it's a body the debt of love our less will just stop your tonight the debt of love oh the sufferings as Paul said as we begin the sufferings for you I said god help me help us sometimes we're so occupied with talking about sufferings of our own self and we don't rejoice in them much less rejoice when suffering for others but I believe that that same life is within me and you I believe that with all my heart and I believe that same God that ministers to us tonight you know what this is it's His grace calling out of us his life and were made a spectacle unto the world unto men unto angels your loving tonight the debt of love I owe jesus paid it all all to him I owe sin had lost the crimson stain he purchased and lost and made me fall for the Brian do you mind coming brother musicians will you come amen hallelujah oh my let's just bow our heads anybody want to be remembered in prayer tonight we think about the word that spoke to our heart say Lord remember me lord god bless you god bless you remember me would you my hands up remember me as you play some softly let's let's just pray Heavenly Father Lord Jesus your word it's so touched our hearts and our lives tonight Lord it's touch deep Lord deep there's no way that Lord that we could ever to be able to fully grasp it but I pray Lord from our hearts we want to fully submit we want to fully fully surrender because it's true it's we want to give ourselves unto you more fully Lord maybe there's one here tonight that hasn't even made that step to give themselves to you lord I pray tonight your God is your presence when they can see that the gospel is about Lord your love reaching down on their behalf to bring them into a place and a union with you oh god I pray tonight free every hand that's been lifted every heart behind that hand lord help us Lord in our lives we ask that you would forgive us Lord as we have lived and lived for self there's been many times Lord and I know that we've repented of that we've made those things Lord but you know hearts were just in this tender moment Lord we just realize all God in this tenderness where you bring us to this place Lord you made us we who were unlovable you made us love the outpouring of your life and father tonight there's a lot of things that we can busy ourselves with where we can look at and get focused on but may Lord we be and have the testimony like if afroditi swear Paul as the messenger the age could point out and say this man was mined to death he was a blessing he ministered to my needs and his heart was for you O God may our heart not be filled with the things of this life may our heart not be filled Lord I'm a collection of feelings and every but God let our lives be filled with you Lord may that be the testimony for the work of Christ see Lord we can do a lot of things we can work we could work and work maybe we could sweep off the gravel off of the sidewalk out of here I believe that be a blessing Lord God to the people Lord but if we're doing that Lord in just a manner of just works and it's not something that we would do is unto the Lord it's fine as your prophet said that's fine but it's much deeper than that it's living for others we're in that it requires life Lord how that we want to be in our lives we know that even as a pepper Edyta see he busied himself there were needs that had to be met Lord we know that in this even in this local assembly there's there's a needs or there's burdens Lord there's things that have to be attended to how I thank you for the musicians lord I thank you Lord God that many that are not even up here tonight playing but Lord yet they themselves surrendering their gifts and their talents that you've given them Lord but not doing it out of law I thank you dear God for the song leaders Lord I think your father for every deacon every trustee I thank you dear God for Lord Jesus each and every one Lord running Lord in the different booths and making these things come about they're not doing it to advance their cause I thank you Lord for every brother and sister here Lord because they may not run in the video booth or the audio booth maybe they don't have that burden but Lord God they've got a burden Lord for this work Lord they've got a burden Lord God they want to see you glorified it's not to lift up Samuel Browning it's not to lift up believers we're tabernacle but it's a lift up Jesus Christ and they operate with that burden Lord no doubt God sitting right here brothers and sisters Lord that tucked away in their prayer closet on the job when they've been driving and Lord they're praying say God speak to brother Samuel heart speak or God to the heart Lord God and my brother you know what we need Lord has a church and Lord tonight even if there's something Lord where it seems like I only get a crumb out of this message and my brother gets a whole loaf I'm gonna rejoice because the Lord Jesus I want to see that help because if my brother gets a loaf if my sister gets a loaf and I have a crumb Lord you will allow me to have that crumb to see what kind of an attitude that even I will take because if my brother gets a loaf he's part of the body but I'm a part of he might need that loaf and as he needs that lo I'm gonna be so thankful I'm gonna be happy because he might be my little finger but he's part of me he might be my heart but he's part of me I'm part of him Lord Jesus now we
