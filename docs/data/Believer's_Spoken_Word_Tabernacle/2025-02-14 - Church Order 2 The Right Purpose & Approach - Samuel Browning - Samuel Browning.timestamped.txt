[38:15] amen amen
[38:18] amen amen it's good to be in the house
[38:20] of the Lord
[38:21] tonight and
[38:24] U we want to go right into the
[38:26] scriptures and and
[38:28] uh I want
[38:30] to uh say it's good to see everybody
[38:34] we've got different ones back some of
[38:37] the as the young
[38:39] people they were
[38:41] um down in a banquet there last weekend
[38:45] and so I know they had a good time and
[38:48] uh we sure missed you all so good to
[38:52] it's good to have
[38:53] everyone together and I told you a few
[38:56] times I think there's only been a few
[38:58] times since November that we've actually
[39:00] had most of everybody together you know
[39:03] with sickness and everything else but
[39:05] I'm so glad the promise is still is
[39:08] still the same aren't you I'm so
[39:10] grateful for that so glad for God's
[39:11] mercy and just want to say appreciate
[39:14] you all and uh and it's a a cold night
[39:18] I'm glad we were able to get all that
[39:19] cleared off out of there because on this
[39:21] side of the building it was still just
[39:24] even after last night when I left out
[39:26] here last night it was I mean everything
[39:28] the whole thing was was basically ice
[39:30] but this part over here because the sun
[39:31] don't really get to it and so um just
[39:35] thankful to the Lord that that's all
[39:37] been cleared so not everybody was
[39:39] slipping and and things like that you
[39:41] know that's one thing we didn't have to
[39:42] worry about before with the gravel you
[39:45] know there's so I I kept telling my wife
[39:47] I said my goodness we're in a different
[39:49] season you know but uh you know just um
[39:53] the things right now I just wanted to
[39:54] mention this to you that you know we're
[39:56] trying the things that we're putting
[39:57] down out there and what's recommended in
[40:00] order to try to save us in the long run
[40:02] so that um uh we can eventually in a few
[40:05] years be able to put down some uh like
[40:08] ice melt and things like that but you
[40:09] put down salt um brother Richie put salt
[40:13] up on the sidewalk and up on here
[40:15] because that's that surface is three
[40:17] years old but the other surface right
[40:19] now it just just can't do that so we try
[40:21] to do the best we can and um I don't
[40:24] know maybe I'm just more attentive to
[40:26] ice now than we that we got this parking
[40:29] lot than I had before I don't know but I
[40:31] told my wife I said I feel like we got
[40:33] more ice than anything
[40:35] now and uh so I know you do probably at
[40:38] your houses too we we've got the same
[40:40] thing but anyhow it's good to be
[40:42] together ain't it amen sir so let's
[40:44] let's go right in here in the scripture
[40:46] and uh Brianna I'll go ahead and take it
[40:48] from the beginning in U in 1 Corinthians
[40:52] 14 I want to move back into something I
[40:56] um I just felt kind of break it up a
[40:58] little bit more here tonight I actually
[40:59] had a a little thought within this I
[41:02] wanted to deal with but I want to break
[41:03] it up a little bit more and and really
[41:05] the purpose of a lot of it I with even
[41:08] labeling it as Church order and then the
[41:10] things there these are going to be
[41:11] messages I believe that even as others
[41:14] come back in or if there's a question
[41:15] that arises we can go back to it I have
[41:19] no problem giving my notes my slides to
[41:21] anybody I have nothing to hide from
[41:23] anybody uh the problem is if I give you
[41:25] my outline you'll probably say Lord Lord
[41:27] have
[41:28] mercy uh because we I just want to I
[41:31] like to cover everything and uh but if
[41:33] you if you want that I'd be happy to
[41:35] send it to you but we just want it to be
[41:37] a reference point so I just you know I'm
[41:40] just taking it in a manner of just just
[41:42] ground level with things so 1
[41:44] Corinthians 14 and verse 32 notice how
[41:48] Paul writes this and the spirits of the
[41:50] prophets are subject to the prophets for
[41:55] God is not the author of confusion but
[41:59] of peace and as in all churches of the
[42:02] Saints now that word confusion it just
[42:04] simply means of instability and a state
[42:07] of
[42:08] disorder God is a god of order he's a
[42:12] god of order it everything we we covered
[42:15] that last week showing that a little bit
[42:17] and the blessing of entering into that
[42:19] now 1 Corinthians 1436 right below
[42:23] there notice how Paul the the asserting
[42:27] here of what God has given him as the
[42:31] first church age messenger what came the
[42:34] word of God out from you or came it unto
[42:38] you only if any man think himself to be
[42:42] a prophet or spiritual that would be
[42:45] Spirit-filled let him acknowledge that
[42:49] the things that I write unto you are the
[42:52] Commandments of the Lord but if any man
[42:55] be ignorant let him be ignorant this is
[42:58] Paul remember he would talk about we're
[43:00] not going to be contentious in other
[43:02] words we're not arguing about things
[43:05] this is how it is and this is where Paul
[43:08] said if they choose to be ignorant of
[43:10] well I'm just going to do it my way Paul
[43:12] said let them be ignorant because
[43:14] remember like Abraham when Abraham gave
[43:17] lot a choice and he saw when something
[43:20] arose and he said what which way do you
[43:22] want to choose and lot said I'll choose
[43:24] this and Abraham said well then I'll go
[43:26] the other way way and So within this
[43:29] this is where what Paul is writing If
[43:31] any man be ignorant let him be ignorant
[43:34] now Paul's not saying he doesn't care
[43:35] about a person or individuals but he's
[43:37] saying if a choice is made we're we're
[43:39] not here to debate or we're not here to
[43:41] try to put points and try to convince
[43:43] somebody that's not what we're here to
[43:45] do verse 39 wherefore Brethren covet to
[43:49] prophesy and forbid not to speak with
[43:52] tongues let all things be done decently
[43:57] and in order amen and let me read this
[44:00] quote before I let you be seated in
[44:02] church order brethen brother Bram says
[44:04] Brethren we've called this meeting
[44:06] together here tonight for the purpose of
[44:08] knowing how that to operate the Church
[44:11] of the Living God which we believe to be
[44:14] part of this church amen may God bless
[44:18] you and bless the reading of the word as
[44:20] you're being
[44:21] seated and so with this in mind this is
[44:25] where that even when I I think was
[44:28] very very um uh astute and and zoned in
[44:33] on this part of it that um we understand
[44:37] that even when we look upon this and God
[44:40] gave us an opportunity to where that
[44:44] this particular thought Church order
[44:47] brother Brandon would deal with this in
[44:49] 1958 and he would deal with it in 1958
[44:52] after he come through a meeting one
[44:55] after another he started with why we're
[44:58] not a denomination laid in the doctrine
[45:00] and everything then he then he he
[45:02] preaches in 1958 Church order and then
[45:04] he comes around in
[45:06] 1963 and it's at a time that remember
[45:09] after the after the Tabernacle had been
[45:12] rededicated after the the addition the
[45:15] prophet was wanting to come and to and
[45:18] to uh work with some of these things a
[45:21] little bit and there was a need there
[45:23] was needs that was in the church now you
[45:26] one thing you will find and I didn't
[45:27] feel so bad after last week but you know
[45:30] it it really didn't matter to me but you
[45:32] know when I hear Brother brandom as I
[45:34] continue to go over these things where
[45:36] brother Brandon will say this is how it
[45:38] should be and he'd say well now the
[45:40] reason this is now it's my fault and so
[45:43] I didn't feel so bad but you know at any
[45:45] rate when I say feel so bad it's not
[45:47] that I left with my hand hanging down uh
[45:50] I I just want I to me you know what I
[45:52] have nothing to hide I just want to be
[45:54] transparent there's certain things that
[45:56] you real that we can do we all sometimes
[45:59] have been in a place that even within
[46:01] our Humanity sometimes maybe our
[46:04] Compassion or ways that we've got and
[46:06] we've had the best intentions with some
[46:08] things and then some things some of the
[46:10] best intentions it it things can just
[46:12] keep going and then it it doesn't stay
[46:15] wholesome with how it should be and so
[46:18] these are certain things that we want to
[46:19] just by the grace of God just holding to
[46:22] these things within order and the reason
[46:24] I say it within that manner is that I I
[46:27] don't believe that the prophet he
[46:28] brought it in a manner I don't find it
[46:30] in here where he brought it to be rigid
[46:33] but the thing that brother Brandon would
[46:34] would actually say multiple times within
[46:37] it is trying to give us a direction and
[46:40] say that when we would come together the
[46:43] whole thing that we're to do is remember
[46:45] to conserve your time and he would make
[46:49] mention you know how there's some people
[46:51] take a whole lot to fill up other people
[46:53] take just a little bit to fill up and
[46:55] that may never ever change
[46:57] that's brother Bram never came around in
[46:59] that quote and said well but once they
[47:01] get more of God in their life they'll be
[47:02] able to take more no that that's just
[47:05] not just not how it is it was just
[47:07] brother B said you always got to find
[47:08] that happy medium and so you're finding
[47:11] things that even that a lot of the
[47:13] things even the way that a service will
[47:15] go it's not a service you'll find some
[47:17] of these things here tonight you've
[47:19] heard me say it but I want to go into
[47:20] some things here tonight that it's not
[47:23] something a preacher does not pack the
[47:25] service in his briefcase
[47:27] so it is not that the preacher that
[47:29] actually makes the service sometimes I
[47:31] know we we get into thinking that way
[47:33] and sometimes we have you know our
[47:35] favorite preachers and things like that
[47:36] and we can get in such a expectation
[47:39] because it's our favorite preacher and
[47:42] and really what it is it it really is
[47:44] not our favorite preacher it's the
[47:46] expectation that we've had to hear from
[47:50] God that's made a difference it's it's
[47:52] what's actually changed everything so if
[47:54] we could just say Lord help me to be
[47:56] able to to hear and be able to have the
[47:59] right expectation at all times because
[48:02] God will speak to us through many
[48:04] different ways through every part of the
[48:06] service God desires to be able to
[48:09] minister to our lives even when it comes
[48:12] to special songs and things like that
[48:14] and I'm not going to deal with that
[48:15] tonight but even through that God has a
[48:18] way of ministering and it's a very
[48:20] important thing of ministering to needs
[48:23] within our lives and so God has this all
[48:26] together you know it isn't one thing
[48:28] that we can look at it that when the
[48:29] prophet would deal with this on
[48:31] confusion he would tell us certain
[48:33] things when you think of that word
[48:35] because a lot of times when we sometimes
[48:37] just thinking of the term confusion we
[48:39] just think man it's just like Mayhem but
[48:42] that's not that's not exactly what
[48:44] confusion is there can be a confusion
[48:46] itself is where there's a state of
[48:49] disorder there's where that where we we
[48:51] don't know the boundaries of where we're
[48:53] actually in at that time brother BR
[48:56] would it in this way he would talk to us
[48:58] about you know because some of the
[49:00] questions that were coming up in here
[49:02] was how that he said brother brandham
[49:05] there are into people that just are not
[49:07] able to stay the whole time and they're
[49:09] having to leave halfway through the
[49:11] preaching not because brother brand was
[49:13] preaching long this is when brother
[49:14] Neville was ministering and most of the
[49:16] time brother brandom said brother
[49:18] Neville was 30 to 45 minutes that's a
[49:20] goal of
[49:23] mine but you know he would brother BR
[49:26] would tell us punch it in there pretty
[49:27] quick and and going through that and you
[49:29] know there's you you learn ways and when
[49:31] times as I told you share with you last
[49:33] week when to break things up and look at
[49:35] certain things and so forth but he would
[49:37] tell us within confusion he said
[49:39] sometimes he said he said now if you
[49:42] find in your in your Tabernacle he said
[49:44] where you go to church he said if
[49:46] everything's okay with everybody just
[49:48] having he said a long testimony service
[49:50] he said that's fine if it goes good for
[49:52] you he said but here at the brand of
[49:54] Tabernacle we found that it brings
[49:58] confusion and then that's where he went
[50:00] in to state if a testimony is given let
[50:03] it be given in the pre-service or the
[50:06] preliminary or you can write it down and
[50:09] the song leader can re read it when he
[50:11] does the prayer request for what purpose
[50:14] to conserve time brother Bram goes on to
[50:17] talk about he says now as song leaders
[50:19] he said don't call everybody up around
[50:20] the Altar and you're going to have
[50:22] prayer and then you know you're asking
[50:23] who's who's got a request he said
[50:25] sometimes he said you get you'll give
[50:27] that mic away and it'll be 30 minutes
[50:29] before you get it back because somebody
[50:31] gets into the glory to God let me and
[50:33] brother Bram goes through that and so
[50:35] what he's dealing with this is that
[50:36] conserve the time because the main thing
[50:40] is the word so all everything itself
[50:43] it's like when brother Bram would tell
[50:45] us of a garden you he said like a statue
[50:48] set seated in a garden everything is to
[50:51] point and highlight that focal piece
[50:54] because it the word itself God speaking
[50:57] and ministering to our needs so all of
[50:58] these things working together should
[51:01] actually come within that Harmony this
[51:03] is why I'm so thankful that as we will
[51:06] look to God and pray as we're coming
[51:09] together as a body of Believers I
[51:11] believe that the same God that will
[51:13] inspire my heart or another Minister's
[51:15] heart to stand here is the same God that
[51:17] can Inspire Hearts to actually be able
[51:21] to say there's a special that has
[51:22] dropped in their heart there's something
[51:24] to Be Sung and then and then how this
[51:27] even the songs that a song leader would
[51:29] choose you know a song leader does not
[51:32] choose his favorite songs because if he
[51:35] choose his favorite songs he becomes
[51:39] predictable you see God God is God
[51:41] that's not work in that way he wants to
[51:43] keep us in a time of expectation this is
[51:46] why that even man I'm all I'm I'm
[51:48] actually in a different part right now
[51:49] but this is I'll just go with it as it's
[51:51] coming you see within a song Ser this is
[51:54] why that within for songs and and
[51:56] choosing of songs this is why as a song
[51:58] leader would pray trying to find the
[52:00] mind of God for that part of the service
[52:03] that he is going to be responsible for
[52:07] in leading in worship and and this is
[52:09] why even when we we look at and and you
[52:12] know at times in introducing new songs
[52:14] and and things like that and even the
[52:16] song leaders know I've told them those
[52:18] that lead right here after the service
[52:20] I've told him I said don't be
[52:22] introducing a new song at the end of
[52:24] service when I'm praying for people when
[52:26] when I at the end of the service I want
[52:28] the songs to be in such a place to where
[52:31] the people don't even have to look up
[52:32] here to see the words they're able to be
[52:35] in worship and when I'm praying for
[52:37] somebody do not stop a song you keep
[52:40] singing I don't care if it's 30 minutes
[52:42] long because there's sensitive needs
[52:45] that are being requested right here so
[52:48] there's just things that you know these
[52:49] are things that for me that as I learn
[52:51] as I go along through it and and I'll
[52:53] pass it and I and you know I want to
[52:55] help you know with the song leaders and
[52:57] things like that I'd want somebody to to
[52:58] help me and I know that they want to be
[53:00] of a real help and a blessing and they
[53:02] sure are and so I certainly appreciate
[53:05] the approach that they take you know in
[53:07] in in everything in in getting ready for
[53:09] the for the service but I want to deal
[53:11] with one thing here tonight actually
[53:13] it's kind of two parts but it deals with
[53:15] the the preliminary and the pre-service
[53:17] Really the part of it and I want to deal
[53:19] with the right purpose and
[53:22] approach I know that some of this can be
[53:24] seemingly very Elementary and yet
[53:26] sometimes it's the elementary things
[53:28] that we get a little bit off and notice
[53:31] in the Scriptures it says God is a
[53:34] spirit and they that worship Him must
[53:36] worship Him in spirit and in truth so it
[53:40] so it's together we understand that the
[53:43] Holy Spirit and the word are not two
[53:46] separate beings but the word and the
[53:48] Holy Spirit are one in the same and so
[53:52] that when a person themselves is endowed
[53:55] with the Holy Spirit through and by the
[53:57] baptism of the Holy Ghost upon their
[53:59] soul it is actually that part of the
[54:03] word that is dwelling within them it is
[54:06] God's word then on display in their life
[54:09] and so this is how that we worship the
[54:12] Lord we understand that worship is not
[54:14] just something that's confined to us
[54:16] raising our hands to us singing songs
[54:19] but actually every part of our life is
[54:21] to be a worship unto God the prophet
[54:24] tells us in the Hebrew series than even
[54:27] when we speak to somebody in the store
[54:29] and say hasn't the Lord given us a
[54:31] beautiful day might be hard hard press
[54:34] to find one of those days but if you
[54:36] look even the sun when it breaks through
[54:38] and brother Bram says when you do that
[54:39] he said you're actually worshiping the
[54:42] Lord so even the way that we live and we
[54:45] conduct Our Lives now notice these are
[54:48] familiar scriptures to us of Psalms 100:
[54:51] 4 and 5 David said enter into his gates
[54:56] with with Thanksgiving and into his
[54:58] courts with praise be thankful unto him
[55:02] and bless his name for the Lord is good
[55:05] his Mercy is Everlasting and his truth
[55:08] endureth to all generations in Psalms
[55:12] 122:1 I was glad when they said unto me
[55:16] let us go into the house of the
[55:20] Lord in Hebrews chapter 10 familiar
[55:23] place let us hold fast the profession of
[55:25] our faith faith without wavering for he
[55:28] is faithful that promised let us
[55:30] consider one another to provoke unto
[55:33] love and to Good Works not forsaking the
[55:36] assembling of ourselves together as the
[55:38] manner of some is but exhorting one
[55:41] another and so much more the so much the
[55:44] more as you see the day approaching so
[55:49] there is the right purpose there's the
[55:53] right purpose that we want to look at
[55:55] why do we come to the house of
[55:57] God this is it's it's so it's so crucial
[56:01] of why that we come to the house of God
[56:04] now no once again this can seem very
[56:07] Elementary but sometimes it helps us to
[56:10] revisit certain things and I believe if
[56:12] the Lord would place it upon our heart
[56:14] in this way then I believe it would be
[56:16] be it would behoove us just to say Lord
[56:19] help me to see what you want me to see
[56:21] so why do we come to the house of God
[56:23] brother Ram says we should come into
[56:25] church with a heart full of
[56:29] reverence not
[56:31] indifference that's good not unconfessed
[56:34] sins that's good we should come with a
[56:37] heart full of
[56:41] reverence church is not a social
[56:45] Gathering some sort of Arena somewhere
[56:48] to talk about what you've done through
[56:50] the day it's a place to worship and
[56:53] we've made it a house of havoc now
[56:56] brother BS just went through earlier
[56:58] Parts on this quote and he's talking
[57:00] about the conduct among the people and
[57:04] he's dealing with sunship dealing with
[57:06] coming into adoption dealing with many
[57:08] times you know brother Brandon would
[57:10] speak and let us know that what was
[57:12] holding up the adoption was behavior and
[57:16] conduct he would speak to us and help us
[57:19] to see that you know that God's desire
[57:22] and that's what this end time message is
[57:23] to do is to produce bring bring forth
[57:27] adopted Sons and Daughters of God not
[57:30] just spirit filled Sons and Daughters of
[57:32] God but the spirit of the of adoption
[57:36] that will lead us to full adoption and
[57:40] like we've been covering that the the
[57:42] new birth and the adoption are not the
[57:44] same thing but the new birth is that of
[57:47] the spirit that will lead us to the
[57:51] adoption but the adoption itself it's
[57:53] based on our conduct it's based on on
[57:56] our Behavior it's based on it's all of
[57:58] that even ascending up of the stature of
[58:01] a perfect man it's it's that of God
[58:03] working and molding and shaping and
[58:06] moving within our lives and there's
[58:08] things that God brings us to and we've
[58:10] got choices on what we're going to make
[58:12] within that hour and the prophet is
[58:14] speaking about things that's been given
[58:16] to the church such as spiritual gifts
[58:18] and all of these things and he said but
[58:20] the way that we're acting with them the
[58:22] way that we're conducting ourselves with
[58:25] them and this is why he leads to this
[58:27] statement of saying when we come to the
[58:30] house of God we should come with a heart
[58:32] full of reverence now watch he goes on
[58:36] to say in church order the church is not
[58:39] a general meeting house for Fellowship
[58:42] friendship and frolic the church is a
[58:45] sanctuary of God now I don't know if
[58:48] some of you have never seen this maybe
[58:50] before brother Bram they had brother BR
[58:52] put this in order there at the
[58:53] Tabernacle but it used to be sometimes I
[58:55] I've been I've been sometimes you know
[58:57] to Church of God and things like that
[58:59] with family and other places too and it
[59:01] is absolutely nothing if some of you
[59:03] been in places like that it's absolutely
[59:05] nothing you walk in the back door and
[59:07] you come into the sanctuary and people
[59:08] are just walking around leaning over
[59:10] pews asking hey have you seen so and so
[59:13] hey did you see what they did down the
[59:15] road the other day did you hear the road
[59:17] did man do you see that construction
[59:19] work it's just
[59:21] everything is being talked about right
[59:24] in here
[59:26] and so you see and and so when we
[59:28] recognize that the prophet is helping us
[59:31] to see that even our approach of our
[59:34] attitude and our heart within things
[59:37] that is a very important thing so in
[59:39] other words we can come here like a
[59:41] shell of a person where it doesn't
[59:44] matter what I've got in my heart it
[59:45] doesn't matter if I've got something
[59:47] against somebody it doesn't matter what
[59:49] I've done it doesn't matter but as a
[59:51] Believer this is now you get somebody
[59:53] right off the street they don't know no
[59:55] better
[59:56] but we know better that come here and
[59:59] there is such such a a coming together
[1:00:02] of such a mindfulness of how we're to
[1:00:05] come together that within this it's not
[1:00:08] a place of for a social gathering for
[1:00:11] friendship and Frolic and the church it
[1:00:14] is a sanctuary of God now brother B says
[1:00:16] if we want to meet one another let us
[1:00:18] come to the house come to my house or go
[1:00:20] into one another's house and meet one
[1:00:22] another but just to frolic around the
[1:00:25] church and talk walking and things like
[1:00:26] that it's not right brethren we come
[1:00:29] here we get the whole thing off of our
[1:00:32] mind so even when we enter in here we
[1:00:36] want to be able to even this would be an
[1:00:39] atmosphere in here that would that would
[1:00:41] help us get our minds off of the things
[1:00:45] of the world because all of us know you
[1:00:47] know it would be nice to be able to say
[1:00:49] that you know what I I leave everything
[1:00:52] of the cares of the world I leave them
[1:00:54] right there on the passeng your seat of
[1:00:56] the car but that's not true many times
[1:00:59] we are carrying needs and we've got
[1:01:02] we've got needs to hear from God we when
[1:01:04] there's Direction in our life Lord I've
[1:01:06] got decisions that I know about and you
[1:01:09] even know about decisions I've got
[1:01:11] before me that I don't know about I I I
[1:01:13] need your leadership but help me Lord in
[1:01:16] my mind to be able to lay that
[1:01:21] aside so within this this is why we even
[1:01:24] want an atmosphere here that would help
[1:01:27] us to be beneficial to ke help our minds
[1:01:30] to be able to lay that to the side Now
[1:01:33] watch how brother br will say it in God
[1:01:35] hiding and revealing in Simplicity he
[1:01:36] says now this may seem a little rude but
[1:01:39] it's not a place to visit it's a place
[1:01:42] of worship we should never murmur a word
[1:01:47] inside of here outside of worship to one
[1:01:50] another unless it's absolutely necessary
[1:01:56] amen everybody with me now now let's
[1:01:58] look at that phrase a little bit unless
[1:02:01] it's absolutely
[1:02:05] necessary there's sometimes there's
[1:02:07] things that can be maybe let's say here
[1:02:09] someone comes up to sing a song and they
[1:02:12] have to whisper in the ear or or say uh
[1:02:14] mention something to one of the you know
[1:02:16] somebody playing that would be
[1:02:20] necessary but you know to look at
[1:02:22] somebody and say hey we're going to LA
[1:02:26] horn after this or you know make it out
[1:02:28] you know draw it out that that that that
[1:02:30] that goes that that don't belong in
[1:02:33] here there's necessary things like let's
[1:02:35] say for example that all of a sudden
[1:02:38] something goes wrong you know a cable
[1:02:39] comes out of the drum kit or you know a
[1:02:41] cable over here well maybe brother Tommy
[1:02:44] or maybe you know Zachary they've got to
[1:02:46] go back and figure out and and say
[1:02:48] something's going on but I've also told
[1:02:50] all of them before I don't want new
[1:02:53] things introduced up here during a
[1:02:56] service if equipment fails let it
[1:03:00] fail everybody with me now I mean we
[1:03:02] want to try to find things if if you got
[1:03:04] a question about it you can ask me about
[1:03:06] it but I don't want commotion of things
[1:03:08] going on of things within the service I
[1:03:11] mean if we just got to plug this in
[1:03:12] that's fine but even in the prior
[1:03:15] service I I've seen times right in here
[1:03:17] where there's been things take place
[1:03:19] while people are reading and praying
[1:03:22] that could be very disturbing
[1:03:25] yeah that's good everybody with me now I
[1:03:29] don't see no tomatoes coming my
[1:03:31] way if you do just make sure I get a
[1:03:33] good basket cuz I like macaroni and
[1:03:36] tomatoes but this is what we're trying
[1:03:38] to do unless it's absolutely
[1:03:41] necessary something that would be
[1:03:44] because there's certain things that are
[1:03:45] not necessary we've got the foyer the
[1:03:48] vestibule that's out there you see
[1:03:50] sometimes it's little things oh brother
[1:03:52] Samuel that's so insignificant remember
[1:03:54] it's the little
[1:03:57] foxes that spoil the vine brother BR
[1:03:59] said it ain't the big things we leave
[1:04:01] undone it's the little things he said
[1:04:04] such as he said we wonder where the
[1:04:05] blessings of God at and we haven't even
[1:04:08] been thanking God for the food we've
[1:04:09] been receiving he said sometimes just
[1:04:12] simple things like that so absolutely
[1:04:15] unless it's absolutely necessary now
[1:04:18] like I said I understand sometimes if a
[1:04:20] cable comes out and whatever more but
[1:04:22] sometimes this is where even within that
[1:04:24] of brothers and I I get it sometimes we
[1:04:27] have to they'll have to make a cable but
[1:04:28] within our minds with everything that we
[1:04:31] do we want to do everything so that
[1:04:33] where it's not a disturbance and I know
[1:04:36] sometimes that even when we've had
[1:04:37] Brothers up here and I try to make sure
[1:04:39] they know how to work the microphone
[1:04:41] I'll try to make sure it's turned on I
[1:04:43] try to make sure all of those things
[1:04:45] like that why because I don't like
[1:04:46] running back and forth and tell so I try
[1:04:49] to tell talk to him back there in the
[1:04:51] office and you know if anything at all
[1:04:52] get it go ahead and turn it on because
[1:04:54] we can mute them out here is everybody
[1:04:56] all
[1:04:56] right okay so I don't want to I'm don't
[1:04:59] want to be overreaching with that at the
[1:05:01] same time either to where but I but I
[1:05:03] also think that we need to be mindful
[1:05:05] it's like for brother Brian here brother
[1:05:07] Brian you know is one he's works with
[1:05:08] our Tech and things like that and
[1:05:10] sometimes there's things that just it it
[1:05:12] you know it takes place and it happens
[1:05:14] and it's just totally unpredictable and
[1:05:16] he has to he has to work with it but yet
[1:05:18] there's sometimes even with things when
[1:05:20] we've talked about it and just said you
[1:05:22] know what it has to wait until the next
[1:05:24] service not during service time so if we
[1:05:28] miss this we miss that but yet we're
[1:05:30] trying to get the services down we're
[1:05:32] trying to do things so when we talk
[1:05:34] about absolutely necessary I think we
[1:05:36] can understand there are things that are
[1:05:38] necessary and things that aren't brother
[1:05:41] B says if we want to visit with one
[1:05:43] another there's places that we may visit
[1:05:45] because we do not come into the
[1:05:47] sanctuary of the Lord to meet each other
[1:05:49] we come here to worship God then go to
[1:05:51] our homes this Sanctuary is dedicated
[1:05:56] to worship and he says now when we we
[1:05:59] can stand outside and talk anything you
[1:06:01] wish to as long as it's right and holy
[1:06:04] now notice how he said this even where
[1:06:06] at times stand outside and talk anything
[1:06:09] you want to as long as it's right and
[1:06:16] holy I wonder how many times that we've
[1:06:19] come here and we've missed blessings or
[1:06:21] call somebody else possibly because of
[1:06:25] how that we came oh brother Samuel I
[1:06:28] just love to see people this is now can
[1:06:31] lead me to a different subject are you a
[1:06:34] Hermit during the week and don't see
[1:06:37] nobody or do you make effort to get out
[1:06:40] and have friends outside of
[1:06:42] church oh we got quiet on that one this
[1:06:45] is the first time I see somebody they
[1:06:47] first time they let me out of my
[1:06:49] cave you see sometimes that's a whole
[1:06:52] separate thing sometimes listen the very
[1:06:54] thing brother R is speaking right here
[1:06:56] remember the the scriptures and the
[1:06:58] message is not saying that we don't come
[1:07:00] together to Fellowship we come in here
[1:07:02] to Fellowship around the word of God not
[1:07:05] with one another and I need you you need
[1:07:08] me we come together so it isn't just
[1:07:11] something I don't need nobody else no
[1:07:13] forsake not to assemble ourselves
[1:07:16] together we all have a part a
[1:07:19] contributing part within this service
[1:07:22] you might say well because I'm not the
[1:07:24] hand but remember the hand itself you
[1:07:26] could cut my hand off and I'll live but
[1:07:29] there's Parts within me that you don't
[1:07:31] even see right now if you mess with them
[1:07:34] I'll die but every part is just as vital
[1:07:39] and as
[1:07:41] important is that right so some of the
[1:07:44] times when we look at certain things
[1:07:46] like this as long as it's right and it's
[1:07:48] holy I believe we should I believe we
[1:07:50] should want to see one another I believe
[1:07:52] we should want to talk to one another
[1:07:53] but with this jurisdiction as long as
[1:07:56] it's right and holy shouldn't be even
[1:07:59] outside of there it shouldn't be talking
[1:08:01] about the latest
[1:08:04] politics woo we got
[1:08:06] quiet those are things that should be
[1:08:09] posted and the deacons are right on that
[1:08:12] to keep that in order I thank God for
[1:08:14] real Godly deacons I thank God for
[1:08:17] deacons that even that when my boys were
[1:08:19] little that they could speak to myself
[1:08:22] and my wife and speak to us about our
[1:08:26] boys when there were certain things they
[1:08:28] were doing in church I thank God for
[1:08:31] that I tell you it must have took a lot
[1:08:32] of Grace for them but you know what I'm
[1:08:34] so glad that they didn't look at the
[1:08:35] office of a pastor and say that's my
[1:08:37] pastor they also know that's my pastor
[1:08:40] but my pastor holds me with the
[1:08:41] responsibility to act like a deacon and
[1:08:44] I'm a policeman there are things that
[1:08:46] need to be served right when the order
[1:08:48] is placed within the house of God I'm
[1:08:50] thankful for men like that aren't you
[1:08:52] I'm grateful to God for that I don't
[1:08:54] look at that and than oh they're just
[1:08:55] you know they're mean no they are
[1:08:57] policemen they they must they must be
[1:09:00] able to stand on what's right whether
[1:09:02] it's their best friend or whoever it is
[1:09:05] they've got to be able to stand for what
[1:09:07] is the truth
[1:09:09] right my my my how do we get here as
[1:09:13] long as it's right and holy so I think
[1:09:16] we there are things we should know and I
[1:09:18] as once again when I say and listen
[1:09:20] friends I I think it's so it ought to be
[1:09:22] such a wonderful thing we come together
[1:09:24] to see one another man I I I love being
[1:09:27] able to come and see you all I love
[1:09:29] being able to come whether I'm preaching
[1:09:30] or not I love to be able to come and be
[1:09:33] able to see you I love the times we have
[1:09:35] the fellowship dinners but the
[1:09:37] fellowship dinners are the right time
[1:09:40] for us to
[1:09:42] Fellowship is that right see sometimes
[1:09:45] we it's almost like when if we're not
[1:09:47] careful we treat those doors like a
[1:09:49] light
[1:09:50] switch that all of a sudden when I open
[1:09:52] them doors
[1:09:56] you've been watching too much Star Trek
[1:09:57] or science fiction you don't come
[1:10:00] through those doors and all of a sudden
[1:10:01] it's a light
[1:10:03] switch it it's it preparing for service
[1:10:07] begins before we even get
[1:10:11] here it it begins before we even get
[1:10:13] here and I know we come on Thursday
[1:10:15] nights from jobs and everything else
[1:10:17] some of you come straight from your job
[1:10:19] God bless you I remember those times
[1:10:22] when I had to come straight from
[1:10:23] teaching school and step right in the
[1:10:24] pull pit I say God bless you because I
[1:10:28] know you don't have necessarily the all
[1:10:30] the preparation that you would normally
[1:10:32] have in another time but you know what
[1:10:34] God knows your heart it's a lot
[1:10:36] different from somebody who does have
[1:10:38] time for Preparation and they're not
[1:10:40] utilizing
[1:10:44] it we can go to one another's home so
[1:10:46] the prophet is about fellowshipping and
[1:10:48] I I think you know it's some things that
[1:10:50] we may have to step back and maybe I
[1:10:52] just need to take one of the young
[1:10:54] people messages and preach it here on
[1:10:57] how to make
[1:10:58] friends you know to where we have
[1:11:00] friends beyond the house of God to where
[1:11:04] what I mean is not people out there
[1:11:05] necessarily but be able to get together
[1:11:07] with one another it shouldn't just be
[1:11:09] that when we're right here in the house
[1:11:11] of God right it should be able to get
[1:11:14] together with one my good I got to keep
[1:11:17] moving here otherwise I'm going to be
[1:11:19] spending my wheels but when you enter
[1:11:21] that door be quiet he's talking about
[1:11:23] that door right there you come here to
[1:11:24] talk to him and let him talk back to you
[1:11:27] the trouble of it is we do too much
[1:11:29] talking and don't listen enough of
[1:11:31] course I know nobody has that problem
[1:11:33] here then we come in here wait on him
[1:11:37] now let me just deal with this a little
[1:11:39] bit more on the flow of service you can
[1:11:40] kind of see where I'm pulling from on
[1:11:42] this right here when we're entering in
[1:11:44] on the flow of a service brother brandom
[1:11:47] when he's dealing with pre-service
[1:11:49] preliminary these are really the three
[1:11:51] three ways he breaks it down and one of
[1:11:53] the things right now we we we dealt with
[1:11:55] that last week about even with things
[1:11:57] within you know testimonies the right
[1:11:59] times and all of those things within
[1:12:01] that like spiritual leadings and we
[1:12:03] actually went beyond that with gifts and
[1:12:05] other things like that and then you know
[1:12:07] even with this time right here when
[1:12:09] gifted individuals to meet I'm I'm not
[1:12:11] going to teach on that tonight but it
[1:12:13] but within it I want to look at this
[1:12:15] other part of it because even when you
[1:12:17] look at was Sunday school then you look
[1:12:20] at it with silent prayer meditation and
[1:12:22] reading of the word of God there's a
[1:12:25] approach to the things that we do
[1:12:28] because you know if right here if if the
[1:12:30] pre-service itself I know sometimes we
[1:12:33] years ago we you know sometimes you had
[1:12:35] people say I tell you the most important
[1:12:37] thing is the word of God now they could
[1:12:41] have a quote where brother Bram says the
[1:12:42] main thing is the word that's true but
[1:12:45] that's out of context yeah that's good
[1:12:48] everything leads up to that all of these
[1:12:51] parts coming together lead up to that
[1:12:56] then then everything is with a flow and
[1:12:58] I want you to think of it when we think
[1:13:00] of that of a flow of a service I want
[1:13:02] you to think of it everybody ever
[1:13:04] everybody seen a train before right so
[1:13:07] you know a train it it takes it takes a
[1:13:09] little bit for it to get going it's you
[1:13:13] know that's how a service is now I'm not
[1:13:17] saying when I say that that a train
[1:13:19] getting going that man it's just going
[1:13:21] to be a you know you know just a man a
[1:13:24] light swinging from that's not what I'm
[1:13:25] saying I'm talking about how the flow of
[1:13:28] the service that it keeps moving it's
[1:13:32] not all of a sudden stopping and then
[1:13:35] starting back up stopping starting it's
[1:13:38] it keeps moving God's got a direction
[1:13:41] for the service so the right approach
[1:13:43] why or what should I do when I enter the
[1:13:46] house of God what should I do now
[1:13:49] brother BR says they should come
[1:13:51] together first slip up in silent prayer
[1:13:55] perhaps at the altar for a few minutes
[1:13:58] no loud praying you'll interrupt someone
[1:14:00] else silent prayer you are in worship
[1:14:03] and let that soak in he says you're
[1:14:06] worshiping in your spirit then return to
[1:14:08] your seat or you don't even have to go
[1:14:10] to the altar just go in get a seat sit
[1:14:12] down Listen To The Music close your eyes
[1:14:14] bow your head and being silent and
[1:14:17] worshiping God all
[1:14:20] along so when we come in either we can
[1:14:24] come up here and we pray or we just get
[1:14:26] our seats and you know we're praying
[1:14:28] silently we're talking to the Lord this
[1:14:30] is the this is the purpose and the now
[1:14:33] the approach of how we're coming we're
[1:14:35] approaching the Lord this is first
[1:14:37] priority these are things when we come
[1:14:39] here this is our mind and where
[1:14:41] everything is set now brother BR says
[1:14:43] here in church order he goes on to say
[1:14:45] we want you to come and worship not like
[1:14:48] not make noise but we want you to listen
[1:14:50] to music get your seat sit down be
[1:14:51] reverent pray or read the Bible this is
[1:14:55] a sanctuary here where the Lord dwells
[1:14:56] and we want everybody to be real
[1:14:58] reverent and worship not to be running
[1:15:01] around talking before services but
[1:15:03] congregate yourselves and you come in
[1:15:06] here to talk to the Lord either be in
[1:15:08] silent prayer or read your
[1:15:11] Bible now let me ask you this right here
[1:15:14] when you go through these things and
[1:15:16] this will be things that I'll continue
[1:15:18] to bring before you there should be
[1:15:20] within this a question of why not in why
[1:15:24] in resistance but why would the prophet
[1:15:27] be so deliberate deliberate within three
[1:15:30] messages out of church order and then
[1:15:33] God hiding in Simplicity before and the
[1:15:36] dedication of of the sa the the the
[1:15:38] church before he ever goes in to preach
[1:15:40] the seals why would he be so deliberate
[1:15:43] with these
[1:15:45] things why why would the prophet deal
[1:15:49] with this about us coming in and having
[1:15:51] a time of Silent prayer just getting our
[1:15:54] minds just a a time just to be able to
[1:15:57] you know just get before God why would
[1:15:59] the prophet speak of that and admonish
[1:16:01] us not as a rule but why would he
[1:16:05] admonish us about getting here in 30
[1:16:07] minutes and other things before why
[1:16:09] would he do
[1:16:11] that
[1:16:13] why because there's a
[1:16:16] value in getting here and getting into
[1:16:20] the channel and beginning to
[1:16:23] pray because then the prophet will take
[1:16:27] us in different places here not not
[1:16:28] tonight I won't get to it but how that
[1:16:30] all of that working together with all of
[1:16:33] these parts of the pre-service it makes
[1:16:36] it then when the song leader steps up
[1:16:38] the song leader in syn then it makes it
[1:16:41] easy for the word to come forth cu the
[1:16:44] channel has already been
[1:16:48] created so it's all a part of what's
[1:16:51] going on you see that very thing of us
[1:16:55] coming in here sometimes like I said the
[1:16:57] little things that we do or don't do is
[1:17:00] the very things that we ends up being
[1:17:02] the greatest blessing now I like I said
[1:17:04] Thursday nights uh Thursday nights a lot
[1:17:07] of times this is this is where
[1:17:09] ruggedness comes out and I'm not saying
[1:17:11] anything disparaging to others I've got
[1:17:13] others streaming there's people
[1:17:14] streaming right now in Connecticut and
[1:17:16] other places too I'm not saying anything
[1:17:18] disparaging about that but I I'm trying
[1:17:20] to say is that you know when it comes
[1:17:22] like to midweek service you've got off
[1:17:24] work you're tired school it's weary
[1:17:27] you're in a battle some of you you're
[1:17:28] stand you're here just like myself
[1:17:30] you're you know here you are you're in a
[1:17:33] place you're waiting to eat when you get
[1:17:34] out of here you've come in here and and
[1:17:36] all of it you're doing your best to get
[1:17:38] to the house of God but as we come in
[1:17:41] all that we can do I believe if we can
[1:17:44] look at it and say God I want to do my
[1:17:48] part I want to do my part I don't want
[1:17:52] to just just slip in I want to do my
[1:17:56] part now there's there's been some
[1:17:58] things and I'll just kind of be a little
[1:17:59] bit trans some some of the reasons for
[1:18:01] myself some of you have seen me come in
[1:18:02] a little bit later because there's
[1:18:04] things I don't I don't like getting
[1:18:06] caught back there I'm just going to be
[1:18:08] honest with you because my mind my when
[1:18:11] my wife we ride to if she rides with me
[1:18:13] to church together I'm one I'm focused I
[1:18:16] don't want to talk about
[1:18:18] nothing you might wonder why is because
[1:18:20] there's many times you can ask her I've
[1:18:22] told her text me this text me this
[1:18:25] there's there's amendments being made
[1:18:27] even to the notes while things are going
[1:18:29] on and we all have phones right except
[1:18:33] brother Gomez he's got a can with a
[1:18:37] string he does brother Gomez is still on
[1:18:39] moris
[1:18:46] code oh my all those cans you picking up
[1:18:50] at the flea market there I'm just PE
[1:18:52] teasing you but we had we have things
[1:18:55] and I don't say that because you know as
[1:18:57] I've told you I love I I love I love you
[1:19:00] I love you but I also realize that when
[1:19:02] I come in here within this time I don't
[1:19:05] want to I don't want to talk about
[1:19:06] anything I just want to I want to focus
[1:19:08] because there's things sometimes that
[1:19:09] some of you know sometimes when there's
[1:19:11] been maybe someone has come back and
[1:19:13] I've been in a days because my mind is
[1:19:15] on what I'm looking at and preparing for
[1:19:18] and sometimes I'm waiting for that last
[1:19:20] little bit I'm waiting for that last key
[1:19:22] I'm waiting for that last little thing
[1:19:24] to get get there and I want to I want to
[1:19:27] do my
[1:19:28] best because you know why he gave his
[1:19:31] best that's right for
[1:19:33] you he gave his best he gave his blood
[1:19:36] for us to me that's how when I look I
[1:19:38] don't prepare any different for Thursday
[1:19:40] than I do Sunday I give my
[1:19:45] all and I say that because he's worthy
[1:19:47] and because you are the Bride of Jesus
[1:19:51] Christ and I I want to just say it like
[1:19:53] this brother BR says
[1:19:56] he says now he's talking about you know
[1:19:59] sometimes you go places and you see good
[1:20:01] things you can see good
[1:20:03] things I've been in a few different
[1:20:05] places where I think brother Brandon
[1:20:07] when he's talking about this here he's
[1:20:09] pulling this example that I'm getting
[1:20:11] ready to read to you from the marble
[1:20:13] Church where Norman Vincent Peele was
[1:20:15] the great psychologist and teacher and
[1:20:18] brother Bram got in there and he's just
[1:20:20] looking how everything is so orderly the
[1:20:23] deacons are standing by the door there's
[1:20:26] people I mean people are are greeted as
[1:20:28] they're coming in there things that's
[1:20:29] very attentive and what's taking place
[1:20:31] it's not just letting people come into
[1:20:33] the building and just kind of wander
[1:20:35] around but everything is so attentive
[1:20:36] and what's taking place and what's going
[1:20:38] on I I realize we don't have to have
[1:20:40] ushers seating people in our church I I
[1:20:44] understand that we're not jammed in here
[1:20:46] but I still think that's a part of it to
[1:20:48] where when you know what it's like when
[1:20:50] you walk
[1:20:51] in you know when you walked in and when
[1:20:55] anybody comes in whether a visitor they
[1:20:58] know they've they've been
[1:21:00] noticed and also they've been greeted
[1:21:03] they've been welcomed but brother Bram
[1:21:04] heard this one what it is is he heard
[1:21:06] and I've I've been to a few I've been to
[1:21:08] a few churches and when I've been out
[1:21:10] and ministered and things like that I
[1:21:12] just kind of just watch things at at
[1:21:14] different times and just kind of observe
[1:21:15] it and brother Bram talked about how in
[1:21:18] this church he said you could have heard
[1:21:19] a pin drop anywhere in that church
[1:21:21] everybody was in prayer for at least 30
[1:21:23] minutes before the first note ever hit
[1:21:26] the organ the Prelude everybody was in
[1:21:28] prayer and I thought how wonderful it is
[1:21:32] it was an
[1:21:33] atmosphere now you know we can brother
[1:21:36] Brown never come out and said well you
[1:21:37] know he was a great teacher he was a
[1:21:39] great psychologist teacher and then but
[1:21:41] watch he was able to glean he was able
[1:21:44] to glean and say this is what I would
[1:21:46] like to see in the Tabernacle now when
[1:21:49] you let me just pause with that you'll
[1:21:51] find that these were things that the
[1:21:54] prophet had to continue to revisit at
[1:21:58] the
[1:21:59] Tabernacle it was not something he put
[1:22:01] in place just like when he had the
[1:22:03] gifted people meet brother Bram tells us
[1:22:05] clear back in the early 50s he said I
[1:22:07] did that when I was a Baptist pastor in
[1:22:09] the Baptist Tabernacle brother Braham
[1:22:11] says if I did it and it worked there
[1:22:13] surely you Pentecostals it could work
[1:22:15] among you so brother brah was showing us
[1:22:18] that there was order but see you can
[1:22:19] find over and over it's coming back to
[1:22:22] certain things why not because we as
[1:22:25] individuals say I'm going to Rebel I'm
[1:22:27] It's just sometimes there's little
[1:22:28] there's little things that just kind of
[1:22:31] get in there you know you you kind of
[1:22:32] let you know if you let someone sing a
[1:22:34] special you know after you know at at
[1:22:36] the end of the service then somebody
[1:22:38] else can maybe not they're no one's
[1:22:39] meaning and wrong but somebody else now
[1:22:41] wants to sing and then it just now then
[1:22:43] then it becomes
[1:22:45] practice are you with me this is one of
[1:22:48] the things when I took School law and
[1:22:49] one of the things when they told us they
[1:22:51] said your practice will supersede policy
[1:22:53] if you ever go to Court your policy
[1:22:56] won't stand if your
[1:22:57] practice is against it your practice is
[1:23:01] what you'll be held
[1:23:02] for no matter what's on the books and
[1:23:04] what's written it's your practice and so
[1:23:07] sometimes in in in like I said in good
[1:23:09] intentions but things we can get to a
[1:23:12] place and thank God for his grace to
[1:23:14] bring us back on track I thank God for
[1:23:17] his Mercy don't you brother M said it
[1:23:19] like this he says I I think they played
[1:23:21] one prelude for about 3 to five minutes
[1:23:23] how great art or something like that and
[1:23:26] then when they did everybody stopped
[1:23:28] praying and was listening to the Prelude
[1:23:30] so now they're coming to the end of the
[1:23:33] pre-service and he says it give a change
[1:23:35] from prayer to the Prelude so it it
[1:23:38] changed from whatever whether brother
[1:23:40] Ram will say at times where where you
[1:23:42] have he says The Pianist organist that's
[1:23:45] playing the soft music that's beforehand
[1:23:48] so that that it creates an atmosphere of
[1:23:51] of that of worship this is you know with
[1:23:53] all of those things that that that that
[1:23:55] would be taking place within that time
[1:23:57] and then there's a change that comes
[1:24:01] right before as we're transitioning into
[1:24:04] the song service where the Prelude like
[1:24:06] you heard tonight you've heard it other
[1:24:08] times where all of a sudden brother
[1:24:10] Brian or brother Paul comes up here and
[1:24:12] they've already in the back they pray
[1:24:15] with me back there all of the song
[1:24:18] leaders and the musicians they've done
[1:24:20] that for years they come out here and
[1:24:22] from there and the time they get out
[1:24:25] here it's about 5 till and when they
[1:24:27] come out here then you'll find brother
[1:24:28] Brian or brother Paul as they're coming
[1:24:31] around then Ben they've got it going and
[1:24:33] all of a sudden they're moving into the
[1:24:35] song that's going to be the startup and
[1:24:37] that song and it's it it lets the
[1:24:39] congregation know there's a change
[1:24:42] coming see it's it's changing at that
[1:24:45] time there's a transition it's now
[1:24:48] getting ready to change from the
[1:24:50] pre-service the preliminary now coming
[1:24:52] into the song service and so notice when
[1:24:55] brother Brown would speak of the
[1:24:56] blessing of this right here within it he
[1:24:59] says when a minister walks into a
[1:25:02] congregation where people are praying
[1:25:05] and the anointing of the spirit you are
[1:25:08] bound to hear from Heaven there's no way
[1:25:12] to keep from it but if you walk into
[1:25:16] confusion you're so confused and the
[1:25:19] spirit is grieved and we don't want
[1:25:22] that and as I said I I don't want to get
[1:25:25] off on song services but brother brah
[1:25:28] even said that sometimes he said we can
[1:25:30] drag that out too long and it kills
[1:25:33] it I've I I've set in in actual camp
[1:25:36] meetings where all of a sudden it was
[1:25:39] special after special after
[1:25:41] special and uh I never
[1:25:44] forget when uh brother Harold
[1:25:47] hilderbrandt he came out he was the
[1:25:50] speaker it had been the service had went
[1:25:53] I I'm not exaggerating I think an hour
[1:25:54] and a half we were tired you're sitting
[1:25:57] out in the heat open air and brother
[1:25:59] Harold hilderbrand steps out this was
[1:26:01] wisdom brother Harold at that time I
[1:26:03] don't know how old he would have been
[1:26:04] but you know um some of you know brother
[1:26:06] Harold he steps out and he looks over
[1:26:08] Brother Bruce jakowski and he says
[1:26:10] Brother Bruce come here he had Brother
[1:26:12] Bruce step up there and he says with his
[1:26:14] trumpet he said just play only believe
[1:26:17] he said I don't want you to sing I want
[1:26:19] you just to listen and Brother Bruce
[1:26:22] began to play only leave with the
[1:26:24] trumpet and I'm telling you there came
[1:26:27] such a refreshing of the Holy Spirit
[1:26:30] came right in
[1:26:32] there but you see what wisdom was
[1:26:34] because the main thing was the
[1:26:37] word and so he reached over he could
[1:26:40] have tried to come to the pull pit at
[1:26:41] that time he would have been a
[1:26:43] flop but he reached over and at that
[1:26:46] moment is to try to kind of recalibrate
[1:26:48] some of those things you know and so
[1:26:51] those are things sometimes we learn we
[1:26:53] we come into that we learn as we go
[1:26:55] brother brandom even told us when he's
[1:26:56] dealing with this in church or he said
[1:26:58] look he said I've been he said preaching
[1:27:00] he said for 33 years he said there's
[1:27:02] some things I've learned he said that I
[1:27:04] just want to you know be able to pass on
[1:27:06] so let me just try to let me just try to
[1:27:09] tie this up here tonight and really in
[1:27:12] this way with when we come
[1:27:15] together the scripture tells us that
[1:27:20] what a what a privilege it is blessed be
[1:27:22] the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[1:27:24] Christ who ha blessed us with all
[1:27:26] spiritual blessings in Heavenly places
[1:27:28] now I'm not going to put this on the
[1:27:30] screen but brother Brown I just want you
[1:27:31] to listen what he says here in the
[1:27:33] adoption part one and he says here we
[1:27:35] are positioned in Heavenly places in
[1:27:37] Heavenly it means the position of the
[1:27:40] believer he says that is if I'm prayed
[1:27:43] up you're prayed up the church has
[1:27:45] prayed up we're ready for the message
[1:27:47] we've assembled ourselves together as
[1:27:49] Saints called out baptized with the Holy
[1:27:52] Ghost filled with God's blessings called
[1:27:54] elected set together in Heavenly places
[1:27:56] we're heavenlies in our souls and our
[1:27:59] Spirits has brought us into a Heavenly
[1:28:01] atmosphere oh he said what could happen
[1:28:04] tonight if sitting in this heavenly
[1:28:06] atmosphere where the Holy Spirit moving
[1:28:08] over every heart that's been regenerated
[1:28:11] and become a new creature in Christ
[1:28:12] Jesus all sins under the blood in
[1:28:16] perfect worship with our hands up to God
[1:28:19] and our hearts lifted setting in
[1:28:22] Heavenly places bless blessing us with
[1:28:24] what Divine Healing forn knowledge
[1:28:26] Revelation Visions Powers tongues
[1:28:28] interpretations wisdom knowledge all the
[1:28:30] Heavenly blessings and joy and speakable
[1:28:32] and full of Glory every heart filled
[1:28:34] with the spirit walking together setting
[1:28:38] together in Heavenly places not one evil
[1:28:41] thought Among Us not one cigarette smoke
[1:28:44] not one short dress not one this that or
[1:28:46] not one evil thought nobody got anything
[1:28:48] against one another everybody's speaking
[1:28:50] in love and harmony everybody with one
[1:28:52] Accord and one a place and suddenly
[1:28:55] there came from Heaven a sound of a
[1:28:57] Russian Mighty Wind brother B said oh
[1:28:59] it's not telling what the holy spirit
[1:29:01] will do in that meeting so sometimes
[1:29:04] even within as our per as the purpose we
[1:29:07] come we come here to meet God we've got
[1:29:13] there are there there are serious needs
[1:29:16] and it's not just us who are
[1:29:18] coming but sometimes you have
[1:29:20] individuals once in a while sometimes
[1:29:23] you can have you know not even you're
[1:29:24] not even expecting like here on Sunday
[1:29:26] we had brother Joy's um son one of his
[1:29:29] sons visit and I didn't I didn't know
[1:29:32] that was taking place and you know just
[1:29:34] pray for them there you know his desire
[1:29:36] is to is to to be back and and so to you
[1:29:40] know to come to the house of God and but
[1:29:42] these are these are things are
[1:29:44] individuals that here when they come in
[1:29:46] Among Us there's certain things that
[1:29:47] they don't know there's certain things
[1:29:49] that they you know haven't heard they
[1:29:51] they have they don't understand all
[1:29:52] these things like this but this is is
[1:29:54] where that for us coming in with the
[1:29:56] right purpose and the right approach it
[1:29:58] creates the right
[1:30:00] atmosphere for what God might do this is
[1:30:04] like why one of the reasons where
[1:30:06] brother Ram would say it over and over
[1:30:08] why he wanted the meeting of the gifted
[1:30:10] one separate he said because if it's
[1:30:12] done here in the congregation you can
[1:30:14] have individuals that don't even know
[1:30:16] what that's about and they can say
[1:30:18] things against
[1:30:20] it so this is when so you find Within
[1:30:24] certain things why once again why would
[1:30:26] brother Bram go into these certain
[1:30:28] things why would he say that and you
[1:30:30] know and and everything like this and
[1:30:32] and certainly you know brother bradam
[1:30:33] was not talking about locking things up
[1:30:35] in a in a door some in a in a in a back
[1:30:37] room because the real reality friends
[1:30:41] when we think of this with even the
[1:30:43] gifts within the church the prophet said
[1:30:45] there ought to be the nine spiritual
[1:30:47] gifts in every
[1:30:49] assembly and as I've told you before
[1:30:51] I've had that quoted to me and I've
[1:30:53] heard it quoted to others many many
[1:30:54] times but really one of the things you
[1:30:57] find that that that what people are
[1:30:59] looking for is the only thing that could
[1:31:01] actually be noticeable is tongues and
[1:31:06] interpretation all of the other gifts
[1:31:08] gifts of healing wisdom knowledge
[1:31:13] discernment all of those are higher than
[1:31:18] tongues tongues is the
[1:31:20] least that's right that's that's the
[1:31:23] least yes but see this is why that the
[1:31:26] prophet was helping us to see it's not
[1:31:28] things that we're we're we're not it's
[1:31:30] not seeking after gifts seek after The
[1:31:35] Giver it's after the
[1:31:37] giver and this is why that when we look
[1:31:41] at these at these parts and let me just
[1:31:42] maybe just kind of give you a little bit
[1:31:44] of a a little little foretaste of where
[1:31:46] I'm going to out end up going here the
[1:31:49] first priority for our walk in our lives
[1:31:54] and where we come into the house of God
[1:31:57] let me just let me just read read this
[1:31:59] little part and then I'm just going to
[1:32:01] fade away here brother Bram says I think
[1:32:04] first that every member every worshipper
[1:32:07] of the brandham Tabernacle should be so
[1:32:10] much in Divine love with each other
[1:32:13] their hearts would long for each other
[1:32:16] when they have to go away to leave each
[1:32:19] other at the service at night I am a
[1:32:22] True Believer in Divine
[1:32:25] love that's one of the things where the
[1:32:28] Prophet starts
[1:32:31] first this is why that brother BR would
[1:32:33] say it over and over he says if God
[1:32:35] asked
[1:32:36] me I'll make you a great person I'll
[1:32:39] give you every single gift or I'll give
[1:32:44] you divine love brother Bram said I
[1:32:47] wouldn't even have to think about it
[1:32:49] I'll take Divine
[1:32:52] love because event
[1:32:54] eventually all the gifts will
[1:32:57] cease when I get to when we get to the
[1:32:59] other side I'll never have to study for
[1:33:01] another message I'll never have to pray
[1:33:03] and be down and and sweat and which way
[1:33:05] do I go on this you know what it would
[1:33:08] have been done it was it was done it was
[1:33:10] reserved within time it was needed but
[1:33:12] when we get to the other side all of
[1:33:14] these things it'll be worth it and you
[1:33:17] know what just to think of it if it'll
[1:33:18] be worth it then what about every
[1:33:20] service now just a little bit you you
[1:33:24] know you think about it and remember the
[1:33:25] times brother and you remember that when
[1:33:27] the Lord brought you and sister Amanda
[1:33:28] back Among Us you remember that when the
[1:33:30] lord gave us a little bit of a direction
[1:33:32] was a little different for me and I sent
[1:33:34] out an email to everybody about how to
[1:33:36] prepare for those services and we had
[1:33:38] those Services come in here God did some
[1:33:41] marvelous things among us wasn't because
[1:33:43] of the preacher it was because of the
[1:33:46] expectation some of you understand what
[1:33:48] I'm saying it was because the
[1:33:49] expectation among the people where where
[1:33:51] habits were broke things lives and and
[1:33:54] things like that were change because
[1:33:55] it's the word that holds transforming
[1:33:57] power and to think of what God did
[1:33:59] within that that time what God will do
[1:34:03] when we come with an expectation the
[1:34:06] just the right purpose the right
[1:34:07] approach I say God help
[1:34:10] us help me Lord help me to lay aside
[1:34:13] help me to anything that anything that
[1:34:15] needs to be cleared out anything laid
[1:34:16] aside I want I want to be sure when I
[1:34:18] enter in here that I'm ready as a vessel
[1:34:22] to be used
[1:34:24] whether I'm used within ministering may
[1:34:26] not even stand behind this desk but I'm
[1:34:27] going to be part of pulling on the gift
[1:34:30] of God I'm going to be part of praying
[1:34:33] that there might be somebody else's need
[1:34:36] that gets met in that service and just
[1:34:38] our little just our little bit of time
[1:34:40] of coming together getting our minds set
[1:34:42] right and getting the attitude and
[1:34:43] getting everything just set right all of
[1:34:45] those things right there my it's hard
[1:34:47] telling what God will do like the
[1:34:50] prophet said when you take a minister
[1:34:51] That'll Walk into a congregation where
[1:34:53] that's taking
[1:34:54] place it's unlimited of what God will do
[1:34:59] you love
[1:35:00] him let's just
[1:35:03] pray Heavenly
[1:35:07] Father Lord
[1:35:11] Jesus I know Lord these are
[1:35:13] very simple principles Lord that you
[1:35:16] would take us
[1:35:18] on even of what I had down lord and
[1:35:21] looking at things and you help me to see
[1:35:25] that this is where Lord I had to move
[1:35:28] some things aside and move it to another
[1:35:32] time but Lord we I believe within this
[1:35:35] of looking at it I'm I'm speaking Lord
[1:35:37] to brothers and sisters those that are
[1:35:39] here those that are
[1:35:42] streaming but help us Lord to be Lord
[1:35:45] when we look upon these
[1:35:48] things Lord that we would esteem it and
[1:35:52] forgive us Lord where we've
[1:35:54] in our shortcomings Lord dear God we're
[1:35:57] in sometimes it's just habits lord it's
[1:36:01] things that we can so easily get into
[1:36:04] Lord and before we know it Lord it just
[1:36:08] becomes a way of
[1:36:10] life but father would you help us
[1:36:13] Lord if the prophet would tell
[1:36:17] us at the beginning of the new year of
[1:36:20] how to make reading our Bibles and he
[1:36:22] would say it this way a
[1:36:25] habit even of Prayer of how to make it a
[1:36:33] habit Lord help
[1:36:35] us I believe Lord we've
[1:36:39] experienced many of us in many different
[1:36:41] ways the
[1:36:43] value of these things Lord I've Just
[1:36:45] Seen just the little things that it's
[1:36:47] not even
[1:36:50] noticeable it's not even something where
[1:36:52] anyone's even standing on the pulpit at
[1:36:55] that
[1:36:56] time it's just Lord even the frame of
[1:36:59] mind that we come in
[1:37:02] with our hearts
[1:37:04] cleaned now
[1:37:06] Lord I don't believe that you were
[1:37:09] telling anybody
[1:37:11] tonight if they have unconfessed sin or
[1:37:14] they have something in their life to
[1:37:15] stay away from the house of God or if
[1:37:18] they have something against somebody
[1:37:20] else but I believe that what you were
[1:37:22] telling us
[1:37:24] is Lord we need to be
[1:37:27] ready to
[1:37:29] go at the moment of a twinkling in an
[1:37:33] eye the Rapture is not going to leave
[1:37:36] time for things to be made
[1:37:41] right help us
[1:37:44] Lord help us Lord in seeing the
[1:37:47] value of these
[1:37:50] things help us Lord give us the strength
[1:37:55] as I said Lord I believe we've seen all
[1:37:57] through this building we've we could all
[1:38:00] Testify the value of it of when we've
[1:38:02] been able to give ourselves to you but
[1:38:05] help us Lord I know many of us Lord as
[1:38:07] your children here they they come Lord
[1:38:10] straight from their jobs in other places
[1:38:13] and here they come
[1:38:14] together in a midweek service Lord to
[1:38:17] hear from
[1:38:19] you father I believe that this approach
[1:38:22] it won't just only work at the house of
[1:38:24] God I believe it'll work Lord in our
[1:38:27] daily
[1:38:28] life help us Lord help us not to get so
[1:38:34] busy
[1:38:35] Lord help us not to get so taken Lord
[1:38:38] within our
[1:38:40] minds sometimes Lord we within ourselves
[1:38:43] depending on how we're
[1:38:45] made we can actually get to a place Lord
[1:38:47] where we just so overc commit
[1:38:50] ourselves and we have no time to just
[1:38:53] just even
[1:38:55] meditate help us Lord would you teach us
[1:38:58] father Lord God we are we're not here
[1:39:02] these are things that you're speaking to
[1:39:05] us ministering to our lives not Lord
[1:39:08] because we've had the wrong intentions
[1:39:10] many of these things Lord even among the
[1:39:12] Corinthian Church they had the right
[1:39:15] intentions but Lord may you just help us
[1:39:18] Lord I
[1:39:20] pray I pray that God that even in these
[1:39:23] all things of the purpose and the
[1:39:26] approach Lord being able to just really
[1:39:29] make it a part of our lives that not
[1:39:32] just trying to slip into
[1:39:35] service 7705
[1:39:38] 715 or getting in at 11:10 sometimes
[1:39:41] Lord I know that Thursdays is a little
[1:39:43] bit more difficult but may we lord I
[1:39:47] pray with the time that we're
[1:39:51] allotted may we invest
[1:39:54] in the right things Lord help us father
[1:39:58] I
[1:39:58] pray dear God we've seen it Lord we've
[1:40:01] seen the value of it may you help us
[1:40:04] Lord as your children may you Minister
[1:40:07] Lord to those that are in need Lord
[1:40:09] those that might be sick in their body

[1:49:09] family of of
[1:49:14] God don't you love the
[1:49:17] Lorden so appreciate his Mercy once
[1:49:19] again
[1:49:21] tonight amen so so thankful for God's
[1:49:24] grace I trust everything was
[1:49:28] clear and I certainly believe to me with
[1:49:31] all my heart thatall I believe God wants
[1:49:34] to take us a step
[1:49:36] higher and I want to go
[1:49:38] higher and as I told you I would look
[1:49:40] back and I I'm always comforted I see
[1:49:42] brother brandham had to had to visit
[1:49:44] many things over and over and he would
[1:49:46] refer
[1:49:48] back he would refer back to a certain
[1:49:51] year where he had things in order and
[1:49:54] then he would say you know we had it in
[1:49:56] order back here and then we had it in
[1:49:57] order back there there's times that had
[1:49:59] to be Revisited and you
[1:50:01] know I think sometimes even as a family
[1:50:04] I'm talking about in our natural family
[1:50:06] sometimes there's things that have to be
[1:50:07] Revisited just in our homes sometimes we
[1:50:10] can get going through some of just the
[1:50:12] cares of life and sometimes you just
[1:50:14] have to revisit certain things you know
[1:50:17] what when you revisit it you don't
[1:50:18] revisit it in a manner
[1:50:21] of oh
[1:50:23] why do we have to do this again but you
[1:50:25] revisit it God always he gives to us
[1:50:29] even as a family it's a reconnecting and
[1:50:31] then God does it right here within a
[1:50:33] within a body I'm just I'm just telling
[1:50:36] you as as a minister as a pastor your
[1:50:38] pastor I don't begrudge ministering
[1:50:40] things like this I don't look at it that
[1:50:42] oh I want to speak this or I want to
[1:50:44] speak that God knows things that he's
[1:50:47] other studies he has me on there's are
[1:50:49] for certain times but God knows what
[1:50:52] he's doing every little thing we want to
[1:50:53] go higher and you know what the whole
[1:50:56] thing is just even in a few moments as
[1:50:58] we dismiss right here you've got an
[1:51:01] opportunity to shake hands with one
[1:51:03] another greet one another in Christian
[1:51:05] love ain't that wonderful amen so
[1:51:09] everything within it the prophet never
[1:51:11] took away from fellowship but it's just
[1:51:13] the right purpose for the right things
[1:51:15] at the right time amen I love the Lord
[1:51:18] don't you amen amen Hall let's just bow
[1:51:23] our heads in a word of prayer father we
[1:51:26] want to say thank you Lord thank you for
[1:51:29] your mercies Lord once
[1:51:31] again I pray that God that you would
[1:51:34] just help us
[1:51:36] now help us as we go forward Lord from
[1:51:39] this place as brothers and sisters
[1:51:41] deacons trustees on and on throughout
[1:51:44] this assembly Lord help us father I pray
[1:51:48] we lord all of our hearts we want to
[1:51:50] serve you the
[1:51:53] best we want to serve you we want to be
[1:51:55] a better servant Lord so help us Lord I
[1:52:00] pray that you'd Grant to every one of us
[1:52:02] Lord a fresh refilling of the Holy
[1:52:06] Spirit Grant it Lord I need more of you
[1:52:09] I want more of the love of God in my
