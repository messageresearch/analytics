real relationship is with you Lord it's not confined to a day of the week it's not confined Lord to a building but we are your Tabernacle Lord We Are The Dwelling Place the Lord we are that house of prayer Lord that place oh God where there is communion in you Lord you are dwelling in us and we in you it's a relationship Lord how wonderful Lord that we can testify of your presence coming to us Lord when we're driving coming to us Lord in most peculiar times Lord be the Lord how that you come and your presence it means everything to us Lord as David could say even though Lord that the enemies are all gathered around but yet you've prepared for us a table and it's in your presence that there's a fullness of joy divine it's in your presence Lord that God our identity is revealed where we are strengthened Lord where we are encouraged it's in your presence the Lord father we just Lord openly declare we would rather have your presence than anything else in this life Lord we love you tonight Lord for every need Lord that's gathered invisible and then the invisible audience Lord may you come and minister to our hearts minister to our needs Lord you know just what we have need of Lord May virtue Lord just go forth Lord to minister to our hearts Lord we just give ourselves to you Lord in the remaining part of this service for the glory of God in Jesus precious name Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord amen you loving tonight it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen we want to look here in the scriptures I'd like to go to job chapter 20. tonight if the Lord will help us and they were just going to just to let you know I just had just a little reference note that I was just going to hit with this chapter we'll look at tonight and just keep rolling to another chapter but I just couldn't get Beyond and the Holy Spirit kept dealing with my heart on on Friday of last week so that's why we're here where we're at because I I certainly believe that in the midst of of a test or a trial it's the things that really matter most is what is declared and that's what I'd like to speak to you about just for a few moments I probably won't get finished with it tonight vote I just want to speak on a little thought what really matters what really matters and that's what the Holy Spirit just pressed on my heart so if we could I want to read in Job chapter 20 and this is so far this is the response that is being given after job has come out of job 19 where that glorious Revelation has been given and I want you to understand this that when that Revelation has been given in job 19 and I want you to keep this in mind and the Holy Spirit will see fit later on whatever God reveals he never takes away from it he only adds to it God just makes it more glorious so what God revealed in job 19 by the time you get to job 42 it's more glorious so God continues to unfold his promise to you and I and the Assurance you think of it in this hour we're living in we have even a greater Assurance than what Martin Luther had we have a greater Assurance than what Pentecost had in 1906 we have a greater Assurance see God doesn't take away he only adds he only unfolds more of his grace to you and I so here is Job chapter 20 here is so far that is answering to this and so far as answering in verse two he says therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer and for this I make haste I have heard the check of my reproach and the spirit of my understanding calls with me to answer so he's saying this is why I've been prompted I've heard what you've said but I'm prompted to answer now notice thou not this of old since man was placed upon Earth that the triumphing of the wicked is short and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment may God bless the reading of the word as you're being seated remember job has he's continued to in the opening part of job 19 where we pulled from job has continued to make it very clear of the surroundings and the circumstance that he's in it's a we know it's a very dire circumstance and the conditions that are around it but I just want to just straw draw from this as we begin to lay for this thought on what really matters you know we think of the song and I know we know it very well I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold I I'd rather have Jesus than rich as Untold and we know that we're always there's always a test that's out to remember when Daniel stood in Babylon and Daniel made the Declaration along with the other um Hebrew Brethren that they were not going to take of the king's meat and when they did that brother Brown picks that up and he says when you have purposed in your heart to make a stand for God he said Satan is going to make you prove it and so Satan made him prove it and to think they did not have of the king's meat but yet at the end of the time when they had enough when they had nothing but Paulson so forth that you or I would have said is not very there's no way this is going to be sustained them but you see it wasn't the pulse that really was sustaining them it was they were in the will of God and when we're in the will of God God takes the things that is beyond that of the natural mind and God sustains his children with things that are thought to be impossible when they came and looked at the Hebrew children at the end they were more Fuller they were plumper they were you know they they look like boy they've been eating good and yet the rest of the of the people in that particular area they had been eating let's just say the filet mignon they had been you know eating all of the fine Delicacies but they didn't look like Daniel and the rest of them you know what the difference was is because Daniel and them made a stand for God and when you make a stand for God don't be afraid of what the enemy will do because when you make a stand for God Jesus said remember if you're ashamed of me and my words in this generation then I'll be ashamed of you but if we'll stand for him then we've got all Heaven backing us up and God will make his word come to pass and so I say that with that song I'd Rather Have Jesus and I just want to read a few statements here before I proceed on with Job chapter 20. and brother Brown's beginning to talk about how I would rather have favor with God and be called a Holy Roller be called a fanatic whatever they want to call me I would rather have favor with God and to know that he's standing right here this afternoon then all the wealth that's in Chicago he said I'd rather to me this is a powerful statement I'd rather be standing right here now holding this picture he's talking about the picture from the Houston Coliseum with the pillar of fire I'd rather be standing here holding this picture and telling you what this is and knowing that he's standing right here within five feet of where I'm standing now I'd rather have this feeling and consolation that I have right now than to be king over all the Earth for a million years he goes on he talks about how you know he's driving a backslidden Chevy pickup truck that's six years old and a Pontiac that's three years old and you know they have the clothes what they have they have on and they have some back at the home and he said but I'd rather live like that and have favor with God than have the best movie star home there is setting on Hollywood Hill over here I'd rather feel in my heart the presence of Christ that I feel now than to have the riches of this world I love him and it's wonderful how many can testify that I'd rather have his presence in my life I don't care I may not have my even my wants but as long as I've got Jesus then I've got everything I've got something that satisfies me when the flesh isn't satisfied I've got something that gives me joy when there's no me to give me joy I've got something that's greater than the circumstances around me because why I've got Jesus I'd rather have fill in my heart the presence of Christ that I feel now it goes on in another place he says oh he says if I got what I deserved I'd be walking I'd ride a bicycle or something that's I mean it from a heart I'd rather have favor with God than to have the best beautiful home you got in Chicago and be out of commission of God my main thing is to be in favor with God in another place brother bam is just coming up from speaking on a preceding quote where David has been criticized by uh his wife Michael for you know dancing when the ark was returning you know and and the rejoicing into Jerusalem and remember God closed her womb up because she was uh making fun of that and she was so ashamed of David but God has said David was a man after his own heart and brother Brandman goes on he says I'd rather have that than have all the popularity of women men or whoever it was on this Earth I'd rather have favor with God that God could say I got a servant I can put my finger on and he will believe me and he will trust me yeah how about you tonight I'd rather have that the world can have all they want I would rather have that than anything amen so when we look at this with with zofar here's one of you know the friends of Joe that has come and I tell you has these guys as it went on you begin to find that you know from that first seven days when they sat there and could not recognize job you begin to find as they go on it seems like they become more emboldened to speak and to say things and to try to interpret to job what's going on see job's got a question on his heart and job has a question and we want to look just a little bit more at that because remember job has spoke all the way through from earlier chapters old that there is one that could put his hand oh that there's one that could stand there although what's job longing for job's longing for someone to span the breach is there somebody that can bring about that place to where that I can hear from God I I just want to get in his presence that's all I is to get in his presence and here is so far you know this is all testing that's going on you know you would think that the testing itself was just that his children were taken and livestock and all the economy and the but but it's also job is affected in the social realm as well so far notice in verse 23 and I only read this to build a background here and again as you're grasping a hold of what these men are looking at and what these men really value when he is about to fill his belly this so far is talking about the wicked manner who's the hypocrite when he's about to fill his belly God shall pass the fury of his wrath upon him and shall reign in upon him while he's eating he shall flee from the iron weapon and the bow of steel shall strike him through it is drawn and cometh out of the body he ate the glittering sword cometh out of his Gall and Terrors are upon him all Darkness shall be hid in his secret places a fire not blown shall consume him and it shall go ill with him that is left in his Tabernacle the heavens shall reveal his iniquity and the Earth shall rise up against him the increase of his house shall depart and his Goods shall Flow Away in the day of his wrath hmm I wonder who they're trying to apply this to hmm you know they just they're just floating these Colts out there floating these scriptures out there hey they know exactly what they're trying to do with them you see this is something we don't want to be guilty of of listening to the word to debate it are you hearing me brother Brahm takes it up in the sardines I just feel to say it as it comes to me right here brother Branham takes it up in the sardisian age which is the age where we know the restoration uh through justification and brother Brown talks about the amount of truth that was released in that age he said it would it would have just started such a great thing and my what it would have turned into he said but men begin to study it not with the intent that it might become an outworking in their life but they gave themselves to it in order to debate it see the word of God is Not Meant to study that well I tell you when so-and-so comes with me I'm gonna no no no you that's wrong the word of God is what we give ourselves to yeah because the reality is is that God's never called you and I to debate as a matter of fact we've seen that in the prophet's life even he when brother Bosworth said let me go down there brother Brahm said no you're not going to do that and then finally when things were promised and we know what took place and how that brother Bosworth was able to stand there but I want you to understand that when when everything came about it was not within I I I believe this on my heart it was not with an intent to prove anything but I believe it was God in his grace that came and look how God showed up there in that particular meeting so if we want to look at what what's the results of it you know because there's things that I don't know about you but you know if God's God can you know we always want to be in this way that if there's something that we have to offer to somebody we want to be available if God secured it should choose to use us but remember brother Brandon would stand there at different times and remember brother Branham standing there and they were talking about you know the the man was talking about the missing link and brother Brahman 1965 standing outside the store and they looked at brother Branham and the man said well brother Brandon where's it at prove it where's it at where's it at brother Brown said I will stand there I was just thinking you know now think about it here's a man the prophet of God God who's preached the serpency he knows these things by the scripture right but now notice what the inspiration of the Holy Spirit tells him he said tell him it's right here and that's all he said it's right here and the man said oh now I see it so you realize it wasn't brother random sitting down with the Bible study that opened that man's understanding it was the inspiration of the holy spirit that was given by the favor of God that opened that man's understanding and that's what we're after is the favor of God well that was free verse 29 this is the portion of a wicked man from God and the Heritage appointed unto him by God these guys are so uplifting it's just unbearable I want you to notice in all of this we could keep on reading we could read the verses that go between it I want you to notice throughout everything that we have read even thus far from any of his friends nothing in itself focuses on the spiritual relationship between man and God everything that they have focused on is surface relationship everything they have focused on is temporal for the things of this world will pass away now if I can go ahead and make a statement brother Branham would let us know why they were approaching it that way is because they didn't know God any deeper than that they only knew God in a temporal way they didn't know him by that way of the revelation of the sacrifice so their focus everything the only thing they can see and focus upon is job your family's gone job the possessions are gone oh my job you know the signification you know that job you you evidently all of this is happening around you you're a hypocrite you're a wicked man no wonder joke could probably tell him tell me something else that's going to encourage me I mean my goodness with friends like you who needs friends right but job is being tested through these leveling of false accusations it's got right down to the nitty-gritty to his best buddies are accusing him the trial is getting right up very close and job has responded I want you to catch this with every one of these accusations that's been leveled they're they're wrongful applications he's responded yet they are they're undeterred these guys are unrelenting because they are accusing him of being a secret Sinner and God is permitting every accusation now why didn't God show up right now just like he did for Elijah on Mount Carmel Lord come visit Lord Lord come vindicate me God God ain't vindicating me God vindicates his word amen and God had already Vindicated his word now God could have showed up right there God could have spoked him but it's all part of the testing God is permitting all of that you know it it brings it brings this to a reality to every one of our hearts and we see this as we look at this with job it this is why it is important and we hear the Holy Spirit ring out through every service through every message it is important to know where we stand with God because test and trials are going to come but it's important to know before they get here where you stand with God that's where it's very important even in the hour that we are living in it's very important because the trial only declares what is real gold if it was gold before the trial it's gold during the trial and it'll be gold on the out on the after it comes out of it in other words gold does not start out gold and become Fool's Gold neither does fool's Golds turn out fool's gold and become real gold but whatever it is the trial itself only declares what's really there so you think about Abraham and lot brother Ram would give this example you know here was was you know lot with Abraham and knowing that that you know Abraham it should have been a complete separation there were some things that was really difficult for Abraham to separate from Abraham love lot he loved his daddy and no doubt his daddy would have still been there but remember his daddy passed away but God allowed a situation after they came out of Egypt that God allowed something to arise then Abraham knew there's got to be a separation let me just say this to you we recognize and God knows within our life that there are appointed moments that God knows that we must be brought to and he knows the choice that we will make he knows that choice and he brings us to that place like he brought Abraham where Abraham gave to lot and lot said I'm going to go down this way and Abraham said well you go that way I'll just go this way whichever way you want to go I'll go the opposite way why this is a Barren ground it wasn't a plenteous place as far as for their flocks remember there was contention among those who were keeping the herds and the flocks and that contention it brought about a time it's a time of decision because God could no longer deal any further with Abraham if he was still holding on to lot and see God God knows what he's doing and you know I think our brother Branham says that as you study it through the message that wasn't something that was easy upon Abraham that was his nephew that burdened him that he had to make the decision to go on without him but you see there was something within Abraham's life that he didn't put there there was a call in Abraham's life he didn't put there it was a God calling upon his life and God drawing upon his heart and Abraham stayed in the will of God and Abraham took the poor of the land while lot went down to where it was more Lush the Bible says that when he looked towards Sodom it said it looked as the Garden of Eden you know it just seemed like it's got to be right I mean it looks like Eden looks like and is is two different things and we understand what happened with the lot but I want to just read how brother Branham would say it in this manner brother Brian was talking about how that we want we want to be true to the word of God because when we think about of everything that so far and the others are saying they're putting it out as though that man I tell you if these things get taken from you know the Wickers only for a little bit and why they got their spoon in their mouth they're taking and everything else and job is looking at it and job is recognizing that ain't true that ain't true being America serving God isn't that everything's going to go my way serving God we've not been invited to a picnic that's not why we serve God we don't serve God because well if I serve God he's going to give me a good husband he's going to give me a good wife he's going to give me a good job he's going to give me your serving God for the wrong reason we don't serve God for what he can do for us we serve God because I want to surrender my life that what you might do through me oh God I don't want my way I don't want my will I don't want my own reasonings I don't want my own self any longer because it's me that has got me in the mess that I'm in right now come on Friends it'd been nobody else it's our own thinking our own doing and our own choices but God doesn't promise a flower bed of Eden don't falsify a Christian don't falsify the message by telling them everything's going to be all right there's going nothing's going to harm you there ain't gonna be no trials or nothing that's wrong a poet said must I be carried home to heaven on a flowery bed of ease While others fought to win the prize and sail through bloody Seas no sir God don't promise ease and prosperity but he promises Grace to endure in every trial it's the grace that we look to glory be to God that's what over think about what overwhelmed our hearts in the beginning was him it was him you don't look at home if I if you know am I first when you used to when God begins to deal with the heart and you think about oh what's my friends going to say maybe what's my husband or what's my wife or what's my associates well you might look at that and that and Satan can play upon that and bring fear towards you but if you just keep looking away to Jesus there's a strength that comes into your life I'm a witness of this I know what I'm talking about anybody else will witness you keep on looking to Jesus you find a strength because it's him that we are attracted to and we begin to realize all the rest of this stuff that is all around me this doesn't mean anything compared to serving the lord Jesus I want to give my life I want to surrender my all to him and we're recognizing he means more than everything I'm glad about that aren't you so what really matters what really matters I'll tell you what really matters it's a spiritual relationship and fellowship with the Lord that's what matters I'd rather have that than than anything in this world I'd rather have that those quotes that I read to you there from before brother Branham is referencing where he had been now this was back in the 1940s a man that is they they offered him a check worth a million and a half and brother Ben said I don't want that I don't want that he said I don't need that if I he said I'll tell you the truth he said God has supplied all my needs and when God sees that I have another need God Will Supply my needs you see it's not being tied to anything help me now help me now the enemy can try to set a track to try to get us tied to Earthly things but Earthly things will fade away just as our health Fades away just as our you know our youthfulness will fade away and we can be found giving our lives and spending our lives then all of a sudden we realize what in the world have I given my life to what have I been chasing and to think if you'd only Just Surrender God's Grace has been chasing you all along what really matters what really matters here you know in job 21 let's look here in in this first part of job 21. just for a few moments now job's going to answer this out of job 20 you know of what so far is saying and job answers and says here diligently my speech and let this be your consolations or your comforts suffer me that I may speak and after that I have spoken mock on as for me is my complaint to man in other words is my my meditations or my troubling is that with man if it were so why should not my spirit be troubled but but my my troubles are not with man or my complaint or my mind or my musings are not with man who's it with God not with man because you can you can dialogue with man right job remember job is Desiring to speak to God that's what he's been longing for hey if I can just get to him this will all be straightened out I understand how why doesn't God just give in why don't God just give in and say oh my goodness why why doesn't because God is bringing forth the qualities of a believer patience is coming out in the midst of this time you know the Bible says in James how many remember and James just says let patience have her perfect work notice not he is her perfect work so what is it it's submitting to the will of God just staying submitted to the word of Lord I don't know what all is going on but just staying submitted to him in the midst of all that time and as we're submitting to him what's happening let patience have her perfect work in our life God knows what he's doing is that right I mean let's just go on Mark me and be astonished and lay your hand upon your mouth even when I remember I am afraid and trembling taketh hold on my flesh now job he had heard God's voice speak to him job did not have an imaginary walk with God job had heard God's voice and so he had a real concern because he wasn't hearing from God and that that bothered him he wasn't hearing from him at all and this is why you know when Joe could say my complaint is not with man you see brother Brown would take us here and I have heard but now I see and he speaks of how that job was used to being a prophet of God he was used to receiving Divine communication from God brother Brian would place that as inspiration so when there were situations and things that would arise job had a contact with God and God would speak to him and job knew this is very important job note he had done all the mechanics in other words there was nothing in job's life that was out of order he was sure of that he knowed he knew he had done everything that God had called him to do but Samuel what are you saying I'm saying job knew where he was standing so when the accusations came Joe knew hey wait a minute I'm not out of God's plan I've done everything that he's asked me to do I have done the mechanics you know what the mechanics are That's The Written Letter if we can't do what's written the Dynamics will never come because the Dynamics come to make the mechanics alive the Dynamics do not come without the mechanics the Dynamics come to make the world live and sometimes when we have received the word or the mechanics and we've received the promise and said I I know that buying Stripes I'm Healed and here we are standing there and the report is even worse from the doctor what do I do keep standing there because the same inspiration that dropped in your heart that you are saved you are mine God will drop that same inspiration through the same Divine Channel you're healed Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I tell you that just makes me just oh it just does something to me Joe knew where he was standing see job when they came to him job would say I don't know you're right oh my goodness you're right the wicked you're right see they couldn't move him this isn't glorifying job understand this was not glorifying job Joe knew where he was standing with God that's why it's important we must know where we stand with God the Bible said we're in an evil day we need to stand in an evil day it's a time of standing and thank God God has provided the Revelation that is given to you and I of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that we can stand as our Christ is standing but the RAM talks about how he was such an honest Prophet before God the how everybody had such a confidence in him and we read that in few further chapters and but job lacked inspiration of what this was all about and God let it happen and didn't tell him hi anybody else ever been in that you don't know what's going on I don't know about you but I've been there I don't know what's going on the first guy I started looking at is this guy right here now you know even though I can look at myself I cannot overthrow the experience of God you can't overthrow it because listen the devil cannot overthrow it he can't break that seal are you with me you and I can look at ourselves and we should evaluate Our Lives remember the whole uh uh Bank of messages brother random preaches be certain of God he's spoken a number of times and he speaks to you and I be certain and once you're certain you know where you're standing then you can be certain of God because you know where you're standing with him oh glory be to God Hallelujah I don't know where I'm standing well it's a good time to get it fixed up it's a good time to settle it it ain't it ain't something to see how long you can make it go on it's God is here to bring about a real stand in our life notice as everybody think about it in this manner so when they want to think about it everybody he said as long as you can help them well all right then but when they want to disagree with you that's when trouble comes in you know I find it interesting brother Brian's preaching this in this series and this how I've heard by now see preaches invisible Union the bride of Christ on the wings of a snow white dove and I've heard this over and over had different Brothers even from brother brother Tim prude will tell it that even standing right there in that set of meetings you know that after brother Brandon preached the first first service there that brother Branham in that meeting they tried to come to his hotel you'll hear Brother am tell about it on tape of how that oh they're going to take me out for a steak today and you know what brother Jack just couldn't he seemed like he couldn't find my room and they went to the wrong room what it was they they were showing up to tell him we don't want you preaching no more in these meetings but God arranged it they could not find his hotel room and they never met up until brother Branham stood on the platform that night and the services went out now think about it now you have a background when you listen to works is Faith Express later on after this happens just you know a day or so and brother Bradham looks around on the platform that night he said well brother Brown and he begins to ident brother Jack remember them good old days old how it's precious to have real dear friends remember you're saying he knows what's all been going on he knows what's taking place you know what you said by the same man why do you say that I find it so fitty that right here in the midst of it that there is accusations that's going on they don't want to hear the message they don't want nothing to do with it it would like to shut brother ran him out but God knows these messages had to get out to you and I glory be to God and if God would see fit like that how much more right here tonight God knows the message that needs to get to you and I what are you saying nothing can defeat the purpose of God devil oh he said they want to disagree with you when trouble comes in but he alone knew he was right his pulsation of Faith he had heard God speak to him he knew it was a truth he knew God's voice nobody could fool him on it for he knew it he didn't know what was taking place around him but I know I heard God's voice and I know where I'm standing and I ain't no secret sinner I ain't no hypocrite I ain't a wicked man I know I know where I'm standing with God I know I have met God's requirements Bram says everything something was wrong he said job he couldn't get inspiration I wonder if job was probably like us he couldn't get inspiration oh John was praying he was going on and looking Lord I just need inspiration I Lord I need to hear from you and maybe you know he'd walk out a little bit or walk over here I don't know but he was doing whatever if I can just get in contact with him what your brother Brown says this he says he couldn't get inspiration on him and it was worrying him I think that's a good thing I think it's a good thing if we haven't heard from God in a while it ought to worry us right it ought not be all he'll be there when I when I feel like picking up his call when I feel like going there and hearing from him he'll be there be careful be careful because if it don't mean no more to you than that then the Rapture itself doesn't mean anything to you the Rapture does not change our appetite the Rapture is not something something to be around no the way you are here right now this moment is how you would be over there are you hearing me death does not change us and it should worry us it should bother us if we haven't heard from God in a while had a brother when I was ministering and said where was that but I was ministering and one of the ministers pulled me off a side after I'd spread them speaking some of the some of the messages so I'd like to speak to him again to you know speak about some things you know and it was kind of like in this manner you know in their life and begin to talk and I'm just waiting on the Lord and looking to it and one of the things that brother shared with me and I've heard others repeat it to me as where before the brother random somebody came to brother random and the one time and and you know they were talking about and brother Graham was asking you know when they had been praying and brother Branham you know said to him and said that's wonderful he says if next time you talk to him tell him I love him because it's been a month it's been a while since I've heard from him well it got quiet didn't it now I don't have that on a quote and I'm not preaching an idea that to me is something that's so hard for me to even fathom it's hard to even think of it in that way because I know that brother Branham heard from God now however long of that time it was they're still trying times that comes our way and in our life sometimes to where God remains silent and you realize God was silent when it came to the Hebrew children he waited until they got in the furnace and then God answered the same way he always answers and that's by showing up sometimes God remains silent to just test our reaction to how things are going to be oh glory be to God I just think it's just an example to place in with this notice it was worrying him and when you get in that kind of a fix then every enemy moves into every friend nearly that you've got and they begin to accuse him oh it must have been a miserable thing for him to know his friends had accused him my friends his friends were accusing him who was that Satan joined himself with the Enemy Satan had come in and said let me have him I'll make him curse you to his face I'll make him deny his message I'll make him curse you I'll make him go back and say it was all wrong then he tried with everything he could to to all the great men and the friends that he used to have but I like this but job stood flat-footed for he knew he had heard God's voice glory be to God I know I've heard God's voice I may not know what's going on right now but I know I heard his voice and I know what he's revealed this far if I walk in the lattice he's in the light then more light will unfold and so far I am walking in the light that he has opened to me job had that confidence like Enoch where Enoch could say I am walking in all that God has made known to me you understand if you're not walking in all that God is open then don't expect anything more from God are you hearing me now oh Lord Jesus I'm really one the Holy Ghost you got to walk you got to walk towards God you got to yield to his drawing Lord I really want I really want more of you do you if you really want more of God yield to him obey him you don't Bane obeying is the simplest and greatest thing that we you and I can do and in order for us to obey it requires death to ourself that's the truth oh my we want God to move we've got to the Bible says draw nigh unto God and He will draw nigh unto you look at this in job 21 7. wherefore do the wicked Live Now watch how job's answering this question because remember they're talking about the wicked and how they are and everything's wiped and wiped off in verse 7 wherefore do the wicked live become old yea and are Mighty in power wow this is blowing away their concept whatsoever because if they're Wicked and their Mighty God just strips everything right away from them right here and job says no God will let the wicked go ahead and continue to increase increase increase increase increase in contrast to what zofar has said in verse 10. here's what zofar says his children shall seek to please the poor and His Hands shall restore their goods in other words what he has done through deceit and deception his children will be servants to the poor his bones are full of the sin of his youth which shall lie down with him in the dust and what did job say to that wherefore do the wicked live become old yea our Mighty in power as a matter of fact they might have less arthritis than what the righteous do they might have a better bill of health than what the righteous do everything is so much better than the righteous are you with me job he's presenting you know a question of Truth he's asking them you know when God asks the question it's for us to think about for a moment like when Jesus said who do you say that I am he didn't want they didn't need to tell him as though he didn't know he's asking a question to cause them to think this is an important moment of reflection notice when he goes on to say in verse 8 and 21 verse 8 this is job their seed is established in their sight with them and their offspring Before Their Eyes in other words their seed line it continues to prosper and go on and propagate and continue to move forth this is what the mighty in power does this is what the wicked does but you see in the minds of zofar in them they're looking at just things in the natural that the natural man all he who's Wicked and a hypocrite this man that is so rich and his Wicked his offspring is just killed off God said through job no it's quite the contrary matter of fact the wicked seed they flourish they propagate they're established throughout the Earth right hello but look at this in contrast here's contrast to bill down Bill Dad actually in job 18 had actually said some things as well this is building not so far sorry he shall have neither speaking of the wicked or the rich man he shall have neither son nor nephew among his people nor any remaining in his dwellings let's say what is this all about if job didn't know where he was standing but job knew where he was standing because job did not live a life even though job had wealth job had cattle job had that but job stock was not in that job was not resting in that job was not looking at his cattle and his houses and his Retreat and his business and his this is praise God glory to God look at all this God is blessing me job never rested on temporal things because you know why they can flee as quick as they come job is letting him know what you're looking at and the confidence that you would have in your own cells the confidence you would have well I'm a righteous guy I'm doing pretty good everything's good with me so man my house is going to stay in order and this and that and that job's letting them know let this be for your consolations he's helping them to see that this in itself what you are thinking that is a wicked man a hypocrite his richest flea that's not true verse 9. job's response remember this is about the mighty and power their houses are safe from Fear think about it they're not they're not they're not they're not trembling it's amazing David writes of this in his homes I can't get to it tonight but David writes of this of how that there are people not even serving God but are not even fearful whatsoever no trembling whatsoever and there's things here and you and I are down on our needs Lord in this storm let the electric stay on Lord right I'm not ashamed to admit it their houses are safe from Fear neither is the rod of God upon them wow so what job is letting us know they're without chastisement they're without correction he's talking about the wicked and Power they get no correction Mighty and power they they everything's at ease there's no fear in their household their seeds is propagating through the Earth and they're not just getting wiped out oh they're Wicked in that case they'd have to wipe out all Congress all Senate they'd have to wipe out Washington DC have to wipe out the world is that right yeah yeah that's true they'd have to wipe out I'll tell you what it'd be pretty scarce right it'd be easy to get home tonight on the way home you wouldn't have to worry about traffic but God allows it to go on God allows it to go on he allows the wicked to go on their seed to be established oh my think about this but neither is the rod of God upon them let me just descend on this point what a blessing it is that God would deal with us as sons and daughters I'm glad that the rod of God is upon us I'm glad he corrects us as a faithful father I'm glad about that I'm grateful for that I'd rather have his correcting hand upon my life you know why because he loves me he chastens me he reproves me he rebukes me because he loves me you see God knows what he's placed inside of you and I can I read this real quick out of Hebrews 12. I'm just going to skip it but I feel just to read it have you forgotten the exhortation with speakers to you as unto children my son despise now not the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him now remember job's not being chastened job's not being rebuked job's being approved by God who some are proving isn't it he's not being chased but job is letting him know that the wicked they don't have no correction coming their way I mean unless they belong to God but on the contrary it just looks like man they're getting by with this getting by with that getting by with this man they can get by with this they can get by with that but for me the least little thing I'm corrected thank you Lord you know the difference they're being prepared for fire you're being prepared in the fire for Glory Hebrews 12 6 for whom the Lord loveth chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth if ye endure chastening God dealing with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if you be without chastisement whereof all our partakers then you are bastards and not Sons furthermore we've had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure I know sometimes it seemed like eternity but anyhow just for a few days but he for our Prophet that we might be partakers of his holiness now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but Grievous anybody ever enjoyed getting a weapon I I don't enjoy getting whipping I never did you know I made sure I tell my dad and all that I'll never do it again I promise Daddy I promise that I know I know you're gonna make sure that I hold that promise I'd have something to help me in memory that I'd remember that promise that I made and then the thing that my daddy made me do after he gave me a whipping everything I hated the most was more than a whip and I hated taking a nap oh I was going to miss out on the day I hated taking a nap that was probably the worst thing nevertheless afterward it yielded the peaceful fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees and make straight paths for your feet less which is lame should be turned out of the way and let it be healed think about how brother random places this and I'm I'm closing just on this point God out of the same lump of humanity because all Humanity's taken out of the same lump but yet out of that lump God has chosen vessels unto honor vessels that he would show his Mercy because God already knows what he's placed remember you know I'm referring to Romans chapter 9 God already knows who is his that's what Redemption is all about he's come to get what rightfully belongs to him and so out of this lump of clay God will take and have vessels remember Pharaoh is a vessel Of Dishonor Moses was a vessel of Honor and God molds him out of that lump of clay and brother Branham makes this statement he said then those chosen ones born of his spirit will be trained to conform to his image in their walk aren't you glad for that training I'm glad for that molding I'm glad for that shaping oh brother Samuel oh the the wicked have it so easy but they won't they won't right now it's a blessing that God would correct me it's a blessing that God would speak to my heart and remember how correction comes correction isn't always with you know where there's you know blessed contact sometimes correction itself is where it stood up and it's just spoken you know next time you approach this don't don't do it this way do it like that but you know sometimes some of us we just had to test it out and we didn't remember what we were admonished in the correction on what we were supposed to do with the sink and so forth and so we didn't correct ourselves and so Grace came yeah to correct us oh yeah Daddy meant what he said Mama meant what he said and so then the next time we come to the sink or whatever it is what do we do we make straight paths for our feet what do we do we heed to that correction that was given now think about how we're trained brother Brown said he reproves with all long-suffering gentleness and mercy he chastens with nail scarred hands and sometimes this Potter must take the vessel he's working on and thoroughly break it down in order that he may rebuild it just exactly as he desires it I think about their song I'm so glad He Didn't Throw the Clay Away I'm glad when there's times that in my life that there's had to be some remoulding I'm glad that he didn't throw it all away I'm glad that he just I'm right there on the wheel and you know we're on the potter's wheel you know what you got to have in order when you look at him working with that clay and things like that they got to keep dipping their hand in water the Holy Spirit keeps drawing nine in his hands is working in our life and what's it doing it's all bringing forth a very image of Jesus Christ in our life we're on the potter's wheel he's molding us with male scarred hands what he purchased for you and I that that purchase that was made that our lives might be conformed to his image think about this think about the grace of God that's provided through the word of God that the Holy Spirit would come and would take upon the spirit of man which is a candle of the Lord and the Holy Spirit would take a hold of that that candle and begin to shine it through our lives when there's things that we've looked at or maybe we've made excuses for things that God's dealt with our hearts are but how the holy spirit will take that candle of our spirit and shine through our lives oh and what's he doing it's Grace provided to you and I that we might want that our lives would be corrected and lined up with him you see God's Got Confidence in his word there's things that we might look at and say oh I don't think that's really that important then God just gets a hold of and begins to shine right through our life and we say oh that really does matter doesn't it it really matters asparagus I believe that's what job is letting us know here the blessedness of the rod of God because it's a scepter of authority we're Guided by it and we passed under it that's why the Bible says for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world I want you to think of this as our heads are bowed thank god brother Brown would make this statement he said the only thing I want to have when I die is favor with God that's all I want I've brought nothing into the world and it's certain we can take nothing out so what we get from the line of God is the only thing we can take with us so if you ever want to pray for me it's not to have money not to have big homes or to be popular but just pray that I can stay in the hands of Christ that he'll mold the clay that he can mold me and use me any way that he sees fit to do I'm going to say Lord that's my prayer I'm not after the things of this Earth Lord that decision has been made Lord You've drawn my heart I just want to be molded more and more Lord to reflect you let me stay in a place Lord that you can use me a place Lord that you can speak Lord to my heart God bless your hands my hand is up Lord that's my prayer let me stay in that place Lord let me stay there what a contrast to what so far and those on the surface level have looked at just surface level things there's not one thing they have brought up about the relationship and fellowship with God and for job all those things it troubled him it hurt it hurt that family and everything but What mattered most to job more than anything was his Fellowship with God got to hear from him so while they were looking at the Natural Things of Life job his Focus was on the spiritual I want to talk to him that's what matters most to me let's pray Heavenly Father Lord Jesus tonight we thank you Lord for your grace Lord Lord I think of job's life and Lord where he's at over and over it continues to declare itself the Lord Jesus job by the grace of God he knew where he was standing this was not his mind it was not his natural mind but Lord it was that Revelation in his heart it shows and declares just how prevailing the power is of divine revelation Lord father I pray Lord that if there's one Lord that doesn't have that Assurance tonight Lord may they move to that place with you Lord may they yield to your drawing your desire to bring a real stand a real Joy a real Fellowship a real Assurance in their life Lord God I pray father Grant it Lord if there's things the Lord that have if there's things that's God in the way and now Lord through father has the word would speak to our hearts and we realize this is what really matters Lord we can give ourselves to all the things of this Earth we can expend ourselves Lord God so greatly and at the end of the day Lord God though we might Lord have more but where is our walk with you Lord Lord when everything comes down to it when it comes down to it what really matters Lord now Lord that's only a question that every one of us Lord has to personally be able to take and to be able to answer and to reflect upon Lord we appreciate we enjoy those things that God that you have allowed us to be able to have but by no means are those the things Lord God that bring us Joy we enjoy them but Lord without you what good would it be what good would it be Lord God for us to have a house or a car if we didn't have the peace of God I wouldn't want it I don't care what it is Lord if I don't have the peace of God within it Lord I don't want it because the whole part that allows me to enjoy those things or any of us is because of the Peace of almighty God Lord Jesus it's your fellowship that's what really matters that's what matters more to us than anything Lord I pray tonight Lord God may you just Lord Minister Lord and strengthen as you have been through the service Lord that God is we can think of that I would rather have the Divine favor of God I would rather have Lord the walk with you I would rather have that Joy I would rather have that Comfort Lord than to have all the Comforts of this Earth Lord I would rather have that more than anything else because the Lord all of those things like James says they will become moth eaten that kind of gold will corrupt all of those things like that can flee away so quickly God help us Lord help us Lord that our lives would be invested in what really matters for it what really matters is Lord God you what really matters Lord May Our Lives Lord be dedicated to you father so fully Lord forgive us Lord if the things Lord that we've allowed to get in the way Lord Jesus help us Lord maybe it's an opinion about something we've allowed to get in the way of a relationship between us and somebody else what really matters our opinion or a relationship what really matters oh God help us Lord search us I pray Lord God Lord how we thank you Father for the molding and the shaping that you bring Lord our way Lord we know we have a confidence we are not being prepared for the Lake of Fire oh no oh no we are being prepared we are being shaped we are being molded Lord right here in this moment that Lord God for the glory that shall be revealed in US Lord help us Lord to ever remain true and faithful Lord help us Lord God to remain in your favor Lord I pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen and listen if you'd like to stand amen don't you love him just appreciate him tonight oh thank you Lord have Jesus then silver or gold I'd rather than [Music] to have richest [Music] am I Jesus [Music] I'd rather be like led by his name piercing that should be the king of the vast soul mate or to be here is [Music] my Jesus [Music] this world affords today [Music] hands of Love Yes Lord I'd rather be faithful to his dear cause [Music] [Music] oh I'd rather I'd rather be true too thless [Music] of the best way [Music] oh I'd rather am I jesus than any thing for this world can't afford to death and to be the king than to be [Music] foreign [Music] can't afford today [Music] aren't you glad that he just don't let us get by with anything you know for us as as Believers when we look at things we don't look at God as being nitpicky but as for a believer I think our brother Brandon would say it in another place in the message he said I would rather be in favor with God that I can be an instrument he said that's what I'm trying to be it's an instrument that he can use I'd rather be in favor with God I don't want anything between that relationship between he and I it just don't it's it's something that don't set right how many know what I'm talking about there's something that just don't set right it might be something that maybe maybe you said the right words but maybe it was just the motive behind it or the tenor that you know in here and it's just something about it how blessed that is how blessed that there's that which Rises up the wicked can go on the hypocrite can go on but there's something inside of your heart that rises up why is that because of the love of God [Music] the desire I desire him more than anything I desire his favor well I'll tell you tonight you're blessed tonight brother Samuel should I not have Ambitions for this no that's not what it was saying at all but what it's saying is you know what sometimes sometimes people can become Soul Our Lives can become to where we become focused on the wrong things you realize Israel you know how Israel got into a place where they were serving the sun god they started doing all that brother Brahm tells us in Christianity versus idolatry they got away from God little by little by little by little by little by little and then they couldn't figure out why were crops drying up why didn't everything turning out like God promised in Deuteronomy 28 man everything's failing you know what we need to do we need to find the god of fertility and that's why they went and started worshiping bowel you know what it is Satan slowly puts a trap and it can drift drift drift drift why aren't things turning out the way they should that's where we have to stop and say Lord am I lined up with you because if we're lined up with him this is what he promised if you'll seek me first in my kingdom than all the other things shall be added to you what you have need of I'll see to it it's in your disposal why God knows what he can entrust even you and I with and he'll entrust it in due time because you know why that our Focus still doesn't change our Focus still looks to Lord You're My Everything you're my everything You're My All In All you're the desire You're the Reason you're the reason I live if you've given me life you're more than life to me this this Joy like Paul I think you were singing This Joy that I have the world didn't give it to me that Joy I'd rather have that joy to know that the same question has been answered I'd rather have that joy to know that I'll pass from Death unto life I would rather have that Joy then all that of the world I would rather have that joy that God working and molding and making and molding in my life has our walk been perfect no has our walk been mistake free no but there has been sufficient Grace all along that when we have failed God does not just pick us up and beat us to death but God comes and he guides us directs us corrects us and you know what God does it according to our age in him God doesn't take a you know a little a little one a little baby that don't know nothing about him say I'm gonna whoop no God doesn't do that God Waits until there's a moment where they can even understand where that would correspond in the right way God does that in our lives aren't you glad for that oh I love him I love him I'm glad for the times when he's told me no I didn't like it out in my flesh didn't like it I'm glad of the times that he's corrected I'm grateful for that where would I be I'm grateful for the times that even God has spoke to my heart and maybe that I didn't attend to it and God said this is important I'm not gonna lose you I'm not going to lose one the Bible said if we would judge ourselves then we should not be judged God is faithful glory be to God oh I'm so thankful as far as in this world's riches or we're not rich but oh I'd rather be rich in him I'd rather be rich in his presence I would rather be rich in the joy of the Lord these are true riches these are the unsearchable riches that we can know who we are as Sons and Daughters of God that when accusations fly I know in whom I have believed I know where I'm standing by this grace and I know that there is sufficient Grace that if there's something that's wrong there's Grace to say hey come on let's get it right let's get it right let's get it under the blood there's Grace glory be to God how thankful I am that's what job was talking about in job 21 he was letting them know this is what's the most important is the relationship with God if my contention was with man why would I be so impatient why would I be troubled but I'm not I need to speak to him to him I need to hear from him glory be to God hallelujah oh I love him and he's so good can we just take this moment just take this moment just in a personal way just tell the Lord I love you I appreciate you thank you Lord for coming by my place thank you Lord oh Jesus thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord thank you for your mercy Lord thank you Lord for the nail scarred hands Lord thank you Lord for working in our lives Lord thank you Lord Jesus oh God thank you Father thank you Lord thank you for the molding and the shaping thank you for the grace Lord that you give Lord thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord oh we love you Lord Jesus Lord we want to say here tonight we love you we would rather have your favor Lord we would rather have your favor Lord we would rather Lord Jesus have your favor and have the favor of the most important man in the land we would rather have your favor Lord than to have the bosses favor Lord not that we despise that but Lord we know that God that when our walk Lord is lined up with you then God the Bible says you'll even make our enemies to be at peace with us Lord help us Lord in the meantime as we're looking to that scripture Lord We Trust You Lord our lives are yielded to you given to you Lord God oh thank you Lord for your mercy Lord Jesus for you make all things the Lord work together for our good to them Lord that are the called lord
