[33:07] of god
[33:08] jesus precious name amen
[33:13] good man as you would turn with me to
[33:14] john jeremiah chapter 29
[33:19] i want to remind you of the upcoming the
[33:21] meetings here this coming weekend
[33:23] there will be no service on thursday for
[33:25] the bill made that
[33:26] announcement
[33:29] friday night will be at seven saturday
[33:32] at
[33:32] 6 00 p.m and sunday will be the normal
[33:36] time
[33:36] i just want you just to be continue to
[33:39] be very much in prayer
[33:41] and just think of a word a word that
[33:44] just
[33:45] really just been pondering on my heart
[33:48] and it's with everything with god and
[33:50] its investment
[33:53] investment you know
[33:57] we're we're living in a time in an hour
[33:59] where it seems like
[34:01] where things are just being given and
[34:02] handed out and everything left and right
[34:04] without any investment
[34:07] and just like when i i spoke to
[34:11] an individual the other day i was there
[34:13] at the store
[34:14] i was talking to them they happened to
[34:16] be a supervisor or manager and they said
[34:18] you'd be surprised they said of the
[34:21] sometimes the young people that come in
[34:23] here and when we start giving them
[34:24] directions
[34:26] on things to do he said they're shocked
[34:28] you're asking me to work
[34:31] and this isn't this is a time you see
[34:33] it's let me just say it to you
[34:35] it's not the dna of people it's a spirit
[34:39] of the age we're fighting
[34:42] against spirits
[34:46] fighting against spirits but i i believe
[34:48] that there's nothing that you or i can
[34:51] do
[34:52] of our investments of just giving our
[34:54] time
[34:55] prayer meditation being in the house of
[34:59] god
[34:59] those those are the things that god
[35:01] would ask of us to believe his word
[35:04] and then to watch the dividends that's
[35:07] reaped from that i
[35:08] i don't know about you but i believe i
[35:10] do speak for you
[35:11] i want more of god i want more of him
[35:17] amen from the time that i met him
[35:20] he's more than life to me he did
[35:23] something for me
[35:24] that nothing in this world could do
[35:28] and i love him i want more of him
[35:32] don't you let's just
[35:36] let's look into the word here this
[35:37] morning
[35:39] jeremiah 29 and verse 8
[35:42] for thus saith the lord of hosts the god
[35:46] of israel
[35:48] let not your prophets
[35:51] and your diviners that be in the midst
[35:54] of you
[35:55] deceive you neither hearken to your
[35:58] dreams which ye cause to be dreamed
[36:03] for they prophesy falsely unto you
[36:06] in my name i have not sent them
[36:10] saith the lord for thus saith the lord
[36:14] that after 70 years be accomplished at
[36:16] babylon
[36:18] i will visit you
[36:21] and perform my good word toward you
[36:25] i want you to look at these next few
[36:27] words it's very important
[36:29] in causing you to return
[36:33] to this place this is what god's
[36:36] visitation
[36:38] what it does as he's performing because
[36:40] his visit
[36:41] he when his visits he performs his word
[36:44] the effect
[36:46] it causes you to return to this place
[36:50] for i know the thoughts that i think
[36:53] toward you saith the lord
[36:55] thoughts of peace and not of evil
[36:58] to give you an expected end
[37:02] then shall ye call upon me
[37:06] and you shall go and pray unto me
[37:10] and i will hearken unto you and you
[37:13] shall seek
[37:14] me and find me
[37:17] you shall search for me with all
[37:21] your heart notice one thing that's
[37:24] common within all this
[37:26] him him
[37:30] and i will be found of you saith the
[37:32] lord
[37:34] and i will turn away your captivity and
[37:37] i will gather you from
[37:38] all the nations and from all the places
[37:42] whether i have driven you saith the lord
[37:46] and i will bring you again into the
[37:48] place whence i
[37:50] caused you to be carried away
[37:53] captive now this what we just read
[37:58] would not only be a prophecy that would
[38:00] speak of israel
[38:02] being brought back into their land after
[38:05] 70 years
[38:07] it would also speak of the regathering
[38:10] of israel
[38:11] and god's visit to the 144 000
[38:15] and how many know they're waiting on
[38:17] their two prophets to appear
[38:21] that takes place when the bride is taken
[38:24] home
[38:26] so god the angel of the lord brother
[38:28] brown tells us
[38:29] in in 1949 1951 he said the angel of the
[38:33] lord is on earth tonight
[38:35] getting israel back into her homeland
[38:38] and it's getting the bride
[38:40] ready for rapture this is a work
[38:44] of the angel of the lord this is the
[38:45] lord's doing
[38:48] god moving upon his hearts of his people
[38:50] fulfilling his word
[38:52] and that it puts a pull
[38:55] upon our lives it causes us to return
[38:59] to that place and this also
[39:02] this also is a prophecy
[39:06] that was given where the church would go
[39:09] away
[39:10] from what god's original
[39:14] purpose that he had there at pentecost
[39:17] when god
[39:18] had a bride standing in his fullness
[39:23] and he said i will restore
[39:28] god would take us back not back to the
[39:30] ephesian age
[39:31] they were already a fallen woman but
[39:33] back
[39:34] to that of pentecost where it was the
[39:37] son of man
[39:38] made manifest in a bride body
[39:42] this was god's promise amen may god
[39:46] bless you
[39:46] bless the reading of this word as you're
[39:48] being seated i want to just speak to you
[39:50] this morning
[39:52] on this thought it's just so pressing on
[39:54] my heart
[39:56] an expected end back to him
[40:01] you see israel as we read and we
[40:05] you know from that in jeremiah and other
[40:07] places
[40:09] israel would go through seasons and
[40:13] times and
[40:14] you know they would be very fervent and
[40:18] serving the lord then they would cool
[40:21] off
[40:22] and a lot of things would take place and
[40:24] then they would cry out to god
[40:27] god would god would move god would send
[40:30] a judge
[40:31] god would send someone that he could get
[40:34] into his hand that would
[40:35] be able to just bring the realization of
[40:40] god back into their midst but
[40:41] before that could ever happen they would
[40:43] have to call out to god
[40:46] so israel was in a they were in a place
[40:49] under the rod of judgment they were in
[40:52] captivity
[40:53] because they had gotten away from the
[40:55] lord
[40:57] they had forsaken him the bible would
[40:59] say it like this
[41:01] but brian turn that based on down that's
[41:03] the one thank you
[41:05] the bible tells us in the book of of uh
[41:08] jeremiah when it speaks of how that
[41:11] israel
[41:12] they had committed two evils and it said
[41:15] they forsaken me the fountain of living
[41:18] water
[41:19] and they hewed to themselves cisterns
[41:23] see the reality is if they had not
[41:24] forsaken him
[41:26] they would have no need to try to hew
[41:28] their own sister
[41:30] but you see the the first part when we
[41:33] we look at this i want you just to take
[41:35] this in mind because
[41:37] in our lives as believers we
[41:40] are alive as believers is built that it
[41:43] would
[41:43] operate by a real spiritual discernment
[41:47] because
[41:48] things are not always what they seem to
[41:51] be or what you can see
[41:52] out here in the natural eyes or feel
[41:56] but it requires a real discernment by
[41:59] the holy spirit
[42:01] to look at how that god would record
[42:03] this in the book of isaiah regarding
[42:05] israel
[42:06] he says the harp the vile the tabret the
[42:09] pipe and wine
[42:10] are in their feast but they regard
[42:13] not the work of the lord neither
[42:16] consider
[42:17] the operation of his hands therefore my
[42:21] people are gone into captivity because
[42:23] they have no knowledge this word
[42:25] discernment here
[42:27] and their honorable men are famished and
[42:29] their multitude
[42:31] dried up with thirst now let me just
[42:33] drop deal with this just a moment here
[42:36] we we look at the term of discernment
[42:38] and there's things that i
[42:40] i believe sometimes that we we
[42:43] don't apply it to the depth that it
[42:45] needs to be applied to
[42:47] when we look at discernment it's it's
[42:49] more than just saying well
[42:51] um this is wrong or this is right in
[42:54] terms of
[42:55] well you know that's not scriptural or
[42:57] this is scriptural
[42:59] but discernment itself it requires
[43:01] something
[43:02] it goes deeper than what you or i can
[43:04] even see
[43:05] or read it gets down into our lives of
[43:08] where we really have to discern
[43:10] and value things that are put before us
[43:14] there's things that that we cannot allow
[43:17] reasoning to guide us we cannot even
[43:20] take reasoning and look at somebody else
[43:22] and say
[43:22] well somebody else is doing this so it
[43:24] must be all right you never base your
[43:26] life
[43:27] based on what somebody else is doing you
[43:30] you have to base your life
[43:32] on as you are giving yourself to the god
[43:35] and praying over everything because let
[43:37] me say it like this
[43:38] in some instances things that might be
[43:41] okay for somebody else
[43:42] may not be okay for you you see god
[43:45] knows even the weaknesses in our life
[43:47] and we've got to be honest about that
[43:50] that there's weaknesses about us there's
[43:52] things that can become
[43:54] easily ensnared in and trapped this is
[43:57] why god
[43:58] told them when you go in the land tear
[44:00] down their pictures
[44:02] tear down their altars god said i want
[44:04] you to remove
[44:05] everything why lest you build it
[44:09] back i don't want those things built
[44:12] back
[44:12] this is where we're standing in this
[44:15] hour i think as parents
[44:16] i think on and on and on we do not want
[44:19] to see all
[44:20] that things are built back that god tore
[44:23] out of our life
[44:24] we want to make sure that the things of
[44:26] what god has brought for our life what
[44:28] god has delivered us from
[44:30] that our lives are a clear expression
[44:32] and it just goes forth in liberty
[44:35] let me just tell you something right now
[44:37] you're never you're
[44:38] there's not such a thing as well we're
[44:40] just gonna deprive
[44:41] them there's no depriving them with
[44:43] putting god first
[44:44] and god being the priority that is not
[44:47] what i call depriving
[44:49] that's what i call if they're inheriting
[44:52] the promise so we
[44:53] we need a discernment we need that
[44:55] discernment here god was
[44:57] right here among them things that they
[45:00] were not even taken into account
[45:02] in their life and yet god was right
[45:05] there
[45:05] and they continued their feast they
[45:07] continued the new moons
[45:09] they continued to go now you know when
[45:11] it's time for the feast of the passover
[45:13] we need to offer this up and offer that
[45:16] up you see
[45:17] everything itself they were doing it but
[45:19] they were just going through the motions
[45:21] it got to a place to where their heart
[45:24] wasn't even in it no more
[45:26] it's such a place to where god could
[45:28] look at it and say
[45:30] your feasts have become a stink
[45:33] in my nostrils you see when god gave his
[45:36] word
[45:36] god's given his word in a way that it's
[45:39] to be
[45:40] kept god doesn't want formality he
[45:42] doesn't want us to wear
[45:43] we just come into a place and we're
[45:45] serving him and it's just without
[45:47] thinking
[45:48] there's a beauty in things becoming a
[45:51] subconscious reaction in our life
[45:53] we understand that faith itself is a
[45:56] subconscious moving
[45:57] there's many times where you have faith
[45:59] you may not even think you have faith
[46:01] that's necessary for healing but god
[46:04] sees that you do
[46:05] have it and it comes to pass in your
[46:07] life and here you are
[46:09] standing with thinking of the first
[46:11] conscience like
[46:12] wow how did this happen i didn't even
[46:14] think but
[46:15] god himself recognizes not our thinking
[46:18] about it
[46:19] but god recognizes what's moving right
[46:21] there in our heart
[46:23] it shows you when we look at these
[46:25] things
[46:26] in this manner god does not desire
[46:29] a people that just become formal and you
[46:31] know things become well
[46:33] we this is just how it's going to be and
[46:35] it's just everything going through the
[46:37] cares of life
[46:38] that's a challenge that's something you
[46:40] and i have to fight against
[46:42] it's things because all around us
[46:44] there's parts of things
[46:45] that can become so common and this is
[46:48] where
[46:48] it's the the challenge in our lives of
[46:51] where our discernment would stay
[46:53] sharpened israel got to a place to where
[46:57] the very thing that they were missing
[46:59] was the very
[47:00] important thing and that's to be the
[47:02] center of all their lives
[47:04] and that was him once their hearts and
[47:07] their eyes
[47:08] got off of him and it started getting on
[47:11] other things
[47:12] then the promises that god made them
[47:16] god had told them you won't have to
[47:18] worry about rain
[47:19] god told them this land you don't have
[47:21] to tote the water
[47:22] like you did in egypt with buckets this
[47:25] is a land
[47:26] that my eyes are upon it my eyes care
[47:29] for it
[47:29] i'm the one who's provided the grain for
[47:31] you to sow i'm the one who's provided
[47:33] the cattle
[47:34] i've provided all of that you see god
[47:37] provided
[47:38] the things that was necessary so that
[47:41] they
[47:42] would be without distraction and their
[47:45] eyes and their hearts would be upon him
[47:48] god's got a purpose
[47:49] all of these things of life are temporal
[47:52] they will
[47:52] pass away and you'll find that how
[47:56] when they begin to drift from that then
[47:58] you find them turning
[48:00] to you other cisterns or cisterns that
[48:03] can hold no water
[48:04] cisterns that just have stagnation
[48:07] cisterns that depend on
[48:09] local revivals that every once in a
[48:11] while rain will come down
[48:12] and rain will fill it up but there's
[48:14] wiggle tails in that
[48:16] there's no type of a lasting experience
[48:19] and power and authority within that but
[48:22] there is
[48:22] in the fountain of life where god said
[48:25] i'll be your protection
[48:27] i'll be i'll be on your side i'll fight
[48:30] your battles for you
[48:32] i will cause there the storehouse to
[48:34] increase
[48:35] i will take care of everything you won't
[48:37] have to focus on those things
[48:39] if you just focus on me
[48:44] it's when eyes are taken off of him
[48:48] then then you have to start trying to
[48:50] meet and do things on your own strength
[48:53] well i gotta
[48:54] make this happen and i gotta make this
[48:56] happen but if it's operated according to
[48:58] the word
[48:59] then god relieves you and i of a worry
[49:02] our
[49:02] focus is no longer upon the cares of
[49:05] this
[49:06] life this is a scriptural principle
[49:09] seek ye first the kingdom of god
[49:12] and his righteousness let me just say
[49:14] this to you
[49:15] seeking is more than saying
[49:20] seeking is an action it's an expression
[49:24] it's from our heart you know wherever a
[49:26] man's heart is
[49:27] that's where his treasure will be also
[49:30] god knows what you and i have need of
[49:32] he knows all of that and all god is
[49:35] asking is
[49:36] let me be the very center of your life
[49:39] i'll take care of all the other needs
[49:41] i'll take care of everything
[49:43] that needs to be taken care of you don't
[49:45] have to do it
[49:46] all you have to do is let me be the
[49:49] center of your life
[49:51] let me just make a point here that's why
[49:53] the devil
[49:54] battles at you and me that's why the
[49:56] devil comes at that place
[49:58] he wants to try to remove our focus and
[50:01] our attention
[50:02] from christ being the center and as when
[50:05] our focus gets away from that
[50:07] then we're left to try to do things on
[50:09] our own
[50:10] and we begin to look at the word as
[50:12] though it's our responsibility
[50:13] to bring it to pass it's not our
[50:16] responsibility
[50:17] to bring it to pass it's god but god
[50:19] wants us
[50:20] looking to him and believing him and
[50:22] then he will come
[50:24] and fulfill and do what he can do
[50:27] he's the power of the church of the
[50:29] living god
[50:31] the power of the church is not its
[50:33] theology
[50:34] or how how well versed it is in the
[50:37] scripture
[50:37] or that's not the power of the church
[50:41] the power of the church is the holy
[50:43] ghost
[50:44] it's god's own life in the church of the
[50:47] living god
[50:47] it's the strength of god it's the word
[50:50] of god because the holy ghost and the
[50:52] word are not two separate people
[50:54] they are one and when the holy ghost is
[50:57] in the church
[50:58] it's the word of the church it's the
[51:00] strength of god
[51:01] that's in the church of the living god
[51:04] this is why paul could say
[51:05] for for to me to live is christ that
[51:09] should be
[51:09] the very testimony put it on the front
[51:12] of the refrigerator
[51:13] for to me is live is to live as christ
[51:17] and to die is gain when christ who
[51:20] is our life shall appear then shall you
[51:23] also appear
[51:24] with him in glory it ought to be such a
[51:27] condition
[51:28] about our life to where when people
[51:30] leave from around
[51:31] our lives it ain't something we put on
[51:33] but there's something of an
[51:35] atmosphere and what is the theme of our
[51:38] conversation
[51:39] sure we might go and talk about hunting
[51:41] sure we might go and talk about flowers
[51:43] but it always winds right back to him to
[51:46] when it's all said and done
[51:48] a person said i'll tell you one thing
[51:50] that's a christian
[51:52] he is the theme of their life they love
[51:55] him
[51:55] this is when it's getting back to him
[52:02] it's the word in him
[52:06] this is where all the blessings lay
[52:09] he's to be the very theme of our life
[52:12] i don't know about you you ever read a
[52:14] book or something like that and you get
[52:15] to read in the book and i'm not
[52:16] i you know i'm not much of a reader i
[52:20] didn't really start reading a whole lot
[52:21] till god got a hold of my life
[52:24] i just skimmed and everything else i had
[52:26] but when you start
[52:27] looking at these things there's
[52:29] sometimes where there's been books you
[52:30] scratch your head and say
[52:31] what in the world's the theme of this
[52:33] book
[52:34] whoever the author is drop them a note
[52:36] and tell them go on back to your daytime
[52:39] job
[52:40] because there's not a theme you're
[52:42] trying to follow a theme and there ain't
[52:44] no theme there
[52:45] let me just tell you something with
[52:46] christ in the midst of the church of the
[52:48] living god
[52:49] it's not a question who the theme is
[52:52] jesus christ
[52:53] is the theme of our life he's the center
[52:56] of our life
[52:58] hallelujah
[53:01] notice this i wouldn't read all these to
[53:03] you but i'm not going to you can read
[53:05] them at home
[53:06] but notice what god let him let him
[53:08] notice here in deuteronomy 28 1
[53:10] it shall come to pass if thou shalt
[53:13] hearken diligently
[53:14] unto the voice of the lord thy god to
[53:17] observe
[53:18] and to do all his commandments which i
[53:21] command thee this day
[53:23] that the lord thy god will set thee on
[53:26] high
[53:27] above all the nations of the earth it
[53:30] lets you and i know
[53:31] that a position even though israel was
[53:34] chosen
[53:35] and ordained by god god set his love
[53:38] upon them god had made a promise to the
[53:41] fathers god
[53:42] brought him out of egypt but god let him
[53:44] know your position
[53:45] is not something that's just handed to
[53:48] you
[53:48] but your position of authority comes
[53:52] through the word and as you will just
[53:54] hearken to the word hear it
[53:56] hearken to it obey it then the word
[53:58] itself it puts you
[54:00] in position because there is no ruling
[54:04] outside of the word there is no
[54:06] overcoming
[54:07] outside of the word so it's the word
[54:10] that puts the people of god
[54:12] into position deuteronomy 2
[54:17] oh i love this and all these blessings
[54:20] shall come on thee
[54:24] and over take thee they'll come
[54:27] to you and they will lay hold on you
[54:30] oh my i would love rest i could preach
[54:32] right now on that
[54:34] you know when god when the word itself
[54:36] sometimes it might seem a little foggy
[54:38] to you
[54:39] but that word is coming to you here you
[54:41] are standing there
[54:43] on the word of the living god and now
[54:45] the word
[54:46] has its coming to you overtaking you and
[54:48] god's laying claim on your life
[54:51] he's laying claiming things in your life
[54:53] that you can't see in yourself
[54:55] but god doesn't need you to see it with
[54:57] these eyes he just wants us to believe
[55:00] him
[55:00] he knows what's in you he knows what
[55:02] he's sowed in there
[55:04] and it comes on yet to overtake you
[55:08] to where it becomes part of your prayer
[55:11] life
[55:12] let it be in me lord let it be in me
[55:14] lord
[55:15] let it be in me lord god granted lord in
[55:19] my life
[55:22] look at this if thou shalt hearken
[55:26] unto the voice of the lord thy god
[55:30] the blessing blessings as you can read
[55:33] all the way through
[55:34] down through verse 14 the blessings are
[55:37] certain these are things
[55:38] god let them know i got everything
[55:40] covered
[55:42] enemy will come against you you'll flee
[55:44] seven ways
[55:46] god let them know i've got everything
[55:48] about
[55:49] your life covered
[55:54] but there's a condition it must be in
[55:57] the word
[55:59] the blessing itself it's sure there's no
[56:01] there's no question about the blessing
[56:04] but it's reserved for those who will
[56:06] hear and
[56:07] diligently hearken and dwell in the
[56:09] place
[56:10] of which god has ordained let me just
[56:12] give a little bit of a disclosure
[56:14] i'm not this is not preaching to people
[56:17] that just want to come
[56:18] to church and then just walk out of
[56:20] church and they'd fulfill a duty
[56:21] this doesn't pertain to you but this
[56:24] pertains to people
[56:25] and lives who desire more of god
[56:28] who desire the living god in their lives
[56:31] who want
[56:32] more of him when that word comes across
[56:35] their pathway
[56:36] it's not just something they come to
[56:38] church and then they just forget about
[56:40] it but it becomes a part
[56:41] of their prayer life it becomes a part
[56:43] of their meditation
[56:45] there's something about it that god has
[56:47] stirred
[56:48] something up let me just drop this for a
[56:51] simple example
[56:52] you know our youngest son zachary there
[56:55] my there's certain things that i know
[56:57] better
[56:57] when to say it or not say it because if
[57:00] i say it
[57:00] he ain't never gonna let me forget it
[57:03] he'll keep on bringing it up
[57:04] even if i say daddy do you think we
[57:06] might be able to have a fire tonight
[57:08] well maybe we'll see maybe means persist
[57:12] keep being persistent keep being
[57:14] persistent keep being
[57:16] all the way to 12 midnight or whenever
[57:18] more why
[57:19] he's not going to give up he really
[57:21] wants that and he's got a maybe
[57:23] out of daddy let me tell you something
[57:25] there's no maybes in god
[57:27] god never made a promise with a navy
[57:30] every
[57:31] promise is yea and amen in him
[57:35] amen the gospel that we preach is not a
[57:38] maybe
[57:38] or a hoaxer or a mic it's our no soul
[57:42] it's a reality of a living god
[57:46] and every promise is crowned with amen
[57:50] [Applause]
[57:52] hallelujah
[57:55] he's persistent
[58:00] israel was given this natural land of
[58:04] canaan
[58:05] this was a type it was a land of promise
[58:09] it was a place that god made a promise
[58:12] that he would
[58:13] reveal himself he would
[58:17] make himself known he would come as the
[58:20] messiah
[58:22] to save his people from their sins
[58:28] so when we look at this we understand
[58:32] that that of for israel the land of
[58:35] canaan
[58:36] is a natural land of promised land but
[58:39] there's an anatype
[58:41] of that land of promise and the antitype
[58:44] which is what
[58:45] is really the real land of promise
[58:48] is that of the holy ghost let me just
[58:50] say this
[58:51] israel could be in the land but remember
[58:54] they would go out of the land
[58:56] they would come into the land go out of
[58:58] the land
[59:00] there would be times where they would
[59:02] fall and they would
[59:03] falter but you see in this land which
[59:06] is the real land of promise
[59:10] you can't fall from this land of promise
[59:13] this land of promise is known as the
[59:16] real rest of god it's known as the
[59:19] seal of god it is the holy ghost it is
[59:23] god's own life it is god's word
[59:26] is that right so this antitype here
[59:30] it would be that god himself where the
[59:33] word he would be that of the holy ghost
[59:35] where the word is being made manifest
[59:38] because
[59:38] once again you can't separate the word
[59:41] and the holy ghost
[59:42] god in christ they're one is that right
[59:46] so there would be a call to come back to
[59:48] the word a promise the place of
[59:51] revealing
[59:51] where god would make himself known in
[59:54] his church
[59:55] in his fullness now outside of that land
[59:58] there's no blessings
[1:00:00] only cursings no blessings
[1:00:04] outside of that land brother brahm said
[1:00:06] it just simply like that
[1:00:07] there's no blessings there's just
[1:00:09] sensations
[1:00:10] but inside of this land you say what
[1:00:13] land are you talking
[1:00:14] about ephesians 1 3 blessed be the god
[1:00:17] and father
[1:00:17] of our lord jesus christ who hath
[1:00:20] blessed us
[1:00:21] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[1:00:24] places
[1:00:25] in christ this is already
[1:00:28] what we are ordained too
[1:00:31] are you with me this is the the expected
[1:00:35] end
[1:00:35] of where the god the position that god
[1:00:39] would have
[1:00:39] for you and i to dwell in notice
[1:00:41] according as he had chosen us
[1:00:43] in him before the foundation of the
[1:00:46] world
[1:00:46] that we should be holy and without blame
[1:00:49] before him
[1:00:51] in love having predestinated us unto the
[1:00:53] adoption of children
[1:00:55] by jesus christ to himself according to
[1:00:57] the good pleasure of his will
[1:00:59] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[1:01:02] wherein he hath made us accepted
[1:01:06] in the beloved now
[1:01:10] god deals with an individual where he
[1:01:13] finds them
[1:01:14] and let me just say this to you
[1:01:17] this is not a new statement to you as
[1:01:19] far as believers
[1:01:22] we think god for the real
[1:01:26] truth of predestination in this hour
[1:01:31] it brings it brings us certainty we we
[1:01:34] see
[1:01:34] that position in the word we know where
[1:01:37] we've come from so if you know
[1:01:39] where you come from you know where
[1:01:41] you're going
[1:01:42] jesus said i come from god and i go back
[1:01:44] to god
[1:01:46] now we we agree that indeed the church
[1:01:49] is predestinated
[1:01:50] the church shall not fall the church is
[1:01:53] ordained
[1:01:53] and anointed do not fall but the
[1:01:55] question that has to be resolved and has
[1:01:58] to be answered us
[1:01:59] are you in that church
[1:02:02] see that's the question because it's not
[1:02:04] there won't be at the time of the
[1:02:06] rapture
[1:02:07] god will not be laying hands upon people
[1:02:09] and saying hey
[1:02:10] i predestinated you but you were just
[1:02:12] too sorry to accept it so i'm just going
[1:02:14] to pull you on in anyhow that is not
[1:02:16] what god's going to do
[1:02:17] that will not bring glory praise to the
[1:02:20] glory
[1:02:20] of his name but god works by his word
[1:02:23] in performing the word and as the word
[1:02:26] itself
[1:02:27] is actually being opened in that moment
[1:02:30] by the visitation of almighty god
[1:02:32] then he causes that heart to return to
[1:02:35] him
[1:02:36] think of when god stood there before
[1:02:38] abraham and sarah's tent door
[1:02:40] that was a visitation that was necessary
[1:02:44] not for abraham that visitation was
[1:02:47] necessary
[1:02:48] for sarah her name had already been
[1:02:51] changed
[1:02:52] but she was still living out as serious
[1:02:55] but it would take the visitation of the
[1:02:58] same one glory
[1:03:00] that abraham met and that same god now
[1:03:03] stepping down in morphine in human flesh
[1:03:06] and we begin to speak and unveil the
[1:03:09] very thoughts
[1:03:10] of sarah's heart you know what he's
[1:03:12] doing he's uncovering the doubts
[1:03:14] because he's got to get the doubt out of
[1:03:17] the way so the word
[1:03:18] can go to work and the word perform what
[1:03:21] the word is promised that it will do
[1:03:24] and god there's only one way it can't be
[1:03:26] taught into us
[1:03:27] it can't be schooled into us it takes a
[1:03:30] visitation
[1:03:31] from god himself
[1:03:35] well i'm so glad that dr jesus still
[1:03:37] makes house calls aren't you
[1:03:40] boy i'm so glad about that i'm glad that
[1:03:42] he's willing to walk down in whatever
[1:03:44] the state that we were in
[1:03:45] and he'll make a house call on our life
[1:03:48] you see it's a visitation
[1:03:49] where sarah didn't even realize what was
[1:03:52] going on
[1:03:53] but what was actually happening in that
[1:03:55] hour is doubt was being dissolved
[1:03:58] why because the one who made the promise
[1:04:01] the one who had spoke to abraham the one
[1:04:04] that had been leading
[1:04:05] her husband that same one right now
[1:04:08] was now there to visit her the one that
[1:04:12] dissolved doubts in the messenger is the
[1:04:14] same one
[1:04:15] that was standing present to dissolve
[1:04:17] the doubts
[1:04:19] in that of his pride
[1:04:26] something happens from that visitation
[1:04:29] because sarah is recorded as judging
[1:04:33] him faithful who made
[1:04:37] the promise thereby
[1:04:40] she received strength to conceive
[1:04:46] hallelujah what happened god god moved
[1:04:49] her beyond her
[1:04:50] limitations that she had of the word
[1:04:53] in her life and god helped her to see
[1:04:56] the word
[1:04:57] is unlimited in power the word doesn't
[1:05:00] know
[1:05:00] how old you got a golden buckeye card or
[1:05:02] you're drawing social security or the
[1:05:04] word don't their word does not work like
[1:05:06] that
[1:05:06] the word is unlimited in power
[1:05:17] see god will deal with the individual
[1:05:20] in where he finds him like where he
[1:05:22] found the prodigal son
[1:05:24] where did he deal with him down in the
[1:05:25] pigpen that's where he started dealing
[1:05:27] with him
[1:05:29] you see the spirit of god going out and
[1:05:31] working now
[1:05:32] think of this here let me make a few
[1:05:33] references when
[1:05:35] israel was down in egypt and remember
[1:05:38] they would be down there for 400 years
[1:05:41] actually and end up being 440 years but
[1:05:44] god said after 400 years
[1:05:46] but you see then it got to a spot into a
[1:05:49] place
[1:05:50] to where israel started groaning
[1:05:53] and crying but israel wasn't groaning
[1:05:56] and crying
[1:05:58] you know it just wasn't something that
[1:05:59] all of a sudden an inspiration hit them
[1:06:02] the taskmasters and everything around
[1:06:06] begin to cause this groaning
[1:06:09] this sign and israel themselves
[1:06:12] begin to pray in such a manner that the
[1:06:15] bible says
[1:06:16] god had respect to their prayers
[1:06:20] i wonder if before that time if you know
[1:06:23] the angels could have asked god hey
[1:06:25] hey they're down there praying but god
[1:06:26] could hear that's just they're just
[1:06:28] going through it you know it's just part
[1:06:29] of a promise they know and
[1:06:30] i'm coming to visit them i'm going to
[1:06:32] deliver them i'm going to walk them out
[1:06:33] but everything's real good for them
[1:06:34] right now
[1:06:35] but god knew it would be a condition
[1:06:37] that would come about
[1:06:38] that when that condition would come
[1:06:40] about it would actually cause within
[1:06:43] them
[1:06:43] a desire to get back to the homeland
[1:06:47] they would begin to see the land that
[1:06:48] they were in bondage this land is not
[1:06:51] too good
[1:06:51] this land is not our home they would
[1:06:53] begin to have a desire
[1:06:55] to be free and go back home
[1:07:00] now brother branham would say it like
[1:07:01] this in i'm just going to refer to this
[1:07:03] in the third exodus and brother bram
[1:07:05] says what it is he's talking about now
[1:07:07] israel in the natural israel being
[1:07:09] gathered back you know
[1:07:10] back into their homeland and other
[1:07:11] things like that and brother brown says
[1:07:13] what it is he says you'll find with
[1:07:15] these things
[1:07:16] that where there's people that's not
[1:07:18] inspired
[1:07:19] and god will use the natural laws of the
[1:07:22] land
[1:07:22] to get him back into position he'll
[1:07:26] cause
[1:07:26] things to be done brother and brings
[1:07:28] that up you know there was in the rose
[1:07:29] of a pharaoh who knew not joseph
[1:07:31] and he says you know here they are
[1:07:33] they're living by these laws and
[1:07:35] and going about them but all of a sudden
[1:07:37] when the laws himself
[1:07:38] start changing then there comes a
[1:07:41] pressure
[1:07:42] that comes upon them now this is
[1:07:43] something that it just so resonated in
[1:07:45] my heart here
[1:07:46] when i begin to look at this the spirit
[1:07:48] of god just spoke to my heart as i was
[1:07:50] looking at this
[1:07:51] he said if you'll notice the children of
[1:07:53] israel
[1:07:54] did not become hardened against pharaoh
[1:07:57] but it was pharaoh's heart
[1:07:58] that was being hardened but the children
[1:08:01] of god
[1:08:02] they begin to become tender they begin
[1:08:04] to become more
[1:08:05] tender to the very things of almighty
[1:08:08] god
[1:08:08] oh lord jesus i believe that's the hour
[1:08:11] that you and i
[1:08:12] are living in it's not a time to get
[1:08:14] caught up with this world
[1:08:16] this world is falling apart there's only
[1:08:19] one banner that i want to hold high
[1:08:21] and that's the bloodstained banner of
[1:08:23] the old rugged cross
[1:08:25] and to announce to every soul and every
[1:08:28] life
[1:08:28] there is a holy ghost that is just
[1:08:31] genuine and real and will transform your
[1:08:34] life
[1:08:36] that's what really matters
[1:08:39] amen we do not want to be caught up with
[1:08:42] the things of this world
[1:08:43] because you know what it don't just
[1:08:45] harden you against the things of the
[1:08:46] world
[1:08:46] it'll harden you against the moving of
[1:08:49] god
[1:08:51] i speak that in the name of the lord
[1:08:54] this is why we must have a tender life
[1:08:57] hallelujah i'm not against you looking
[1:09:00] at this or seeing this or
[1:09:01] what's going on here but just remember
[1:09:03] make sure that you are more of a word
[1:09:06] junkie than a news junkie because it
[1:09:09] ain't news no more it ain't opinion no
[1:09:11] more
[1:09:11] it's propaganda that's how it's been
[1:09:15] come on now that ain't just been from
[1:09:16] the past few years some of the own
[1:09:18] people
[1:09:18] they're the ones that call those things
[1:09:20] you and i both know that
[1:09:22] but let's not be caught up with these
[1:09:24] things you know what does it do
[1:09:26] you find where people find they feed on
[1:09:28] things of conspiracy theories and
[1:09:30] whatever more
[1:09:31] what does it do it doesn't stop right
[1:09:33] there on that website
[1:09:34] it'll bring it right in you'll hold your
[1:09:36] pastor under conspiracy
[1:09:37] you'll hold everything under conspiracy
[1:09:40] that same
[1:09:40] devil has worked even throughout these
[1:09:43] websites
[1:09:44] around the message it's the same
[1:09:46] critical
[1:09:47] devil you cannot partake
[1:09:50] of the world and remain neutral
[1:09:53] [Applause]
[1:09:57] but the spiritual mind brother will keep
[1:09:59] doing this spiritual mind
[1:10:01] just type in that phrase on your on your
[1:10:04] table out there
[1:10:05] in third exodus how many times brother
[1:10:07] rama keep bringing it up the spiritual
[1:10:08] mind the spiritual mind the spiritual
[1:10:10] mind the spiritual mind
[1:10:11] because why the spiritual mind lives
[1:10:14] under divine inspiration you see we are
[1:10:17] not walking
[1:10:18] by our own devices god has opened his
[1:10:22] word
[1:10:22] in this hour the promise that he has
[1:10:25] made
[1:10:25] and divine inspiration through the
[1:10:28] opening of those seven seals
[1:10:30] his very life being poured into the
[1:10:33] church
[1:10:33] of the living god it's taken the very
[1:10:36] hide and cover
[1:10:36] off of satan is exposed to him as a
[1:10:39] defeated devil
[1:10:40] it exposed him as a blood and it reveals
[1:10:43] the church
[1:10:44] of the living god as a triumphant church
[1:10:47] where the mighty conqueror
[1:10:49] is standing in our midst where we are
[1:10:51] adorned with the same
[1:10:53] baptism of the holy ghost as sons and
[1:10:55] daughters of god
[1:10:57] hey we're under inspiration
[1:11:00] [Applause]
[1:11:03] hallelujah but this inspiration
[1:11:06] and ain't going to give you a hangover
[1:11:07] like or will you come out and say
[1:11:09] wow what dumb thing did i just do no no
[1:11:11] this inspiration will pack you to glory
[1:11:14] this inspiration leads you to an
[1:11:16] overcoming life
[1:11:19] hallelujah now notice this difference
[1:11:21] because
[1:11:22] you see it's natural forces that puts it
[1:11:24] in put israel back in her homeland
[1:11:27] god used all those he worked all of that
[1:11:29] he put israel back in her homeland
[1:11:31] natural
[1:11:31] forces did that but it takes the spirit
[1:11:34] of god it's been the holy spirit
[1:11:36] that's been drawing that's been moving
[1:11:39] upon the hearts of the bride down
[1:11:41] through time
[1:11:42] to actually put the bride back in her
[1:11:44] homeland
[1:11:45] you see it's in this hour that the
[1:11:47] church of the living god
[1:11:49] has been looking forward to in this time
[1:11:51] do you realize the prophets of the old
[1:11:53] testament
[1:11:54] have been waiting and looking for this
[1:11:56] time they were waiting and knowing that
[1:11:58] this time
[1:11:59] of redemption would come that's why the
[1:12:01] taking of the book
[1:12:02] in revelations 5 with such a sublime
[1:12:04] event
[1:12:05] it is the initiating or the announcement
[1:12:08] that the
[1:12:08] end is here it's a time of the finishing
[1:12:12] up of the gentiles the final sealing of
[1:12:14] the holy ghost
[1:12:16] where the mystery's been finished and
[1:12:17] it's time to go in rapture
[1:12:19] it's time to turn to the jews it's time
[1:12:21] for the millennium
[1:12:26] so in other words you might want to
[1:12:27] pinch yourself
[1:12:30] you're in the vision
[1:12:33] think of this now when all this began to
[1:12:37] take place
[1:12:39] you find daniel a prophet of god
[1:12:43] he's right down there in babylon
[1:12:46] when daniel was down there let me just
[1:12:48] read here
[1:12:49] in first in daniel 9 1 in the first year
[1:12:51] of darius the son of a hazarist
[1:12:53] of the seed of the medes which was made
[1:12:55] king over the realm of the chaldeans
[1:12:57] in the first year of his reign i daniel
[1:13:00] understood by books the number of the
[1:13:03] years oh my
[1:13:04] aren't you glad for books yes
[1:13:07] whereof the word of the lord came to
[1:13:09] jeremiah the prophet
[1:13:11] that he would accomplish 70 years
[1:13:14] in the desolations of jerusalem now
[1:13:17] notice
[1:13:17] when he understood notice where his
[1:13:19] understanding that this is the hour
[1:13:22] this is the time notice what it led to
[1:13:25] and i set my face unto the lord god
[1:13:28] to seek by prayer and supplications
[1:13:32] with fasting and sackcloth and ashes and
[1:13:34] you can read the rest of that prayer
[1:13:36] but daniel himself when this inspiration
[1:13:39] is unfolding
[1:13:40] that this is the season of the word to
[1:13:43] be fulfilled
[1:13:44] what did it do when that word is even
[1:13:46] announced there
[1:13:47] and daniel begins to understand it first
[1:13:50] of all takes daniel as a messenger
[1:13:52] and begins to so move upon his life to
[1:13:55] where daniel moves
[1:13:57] in repentance you see when the word
[1:13:59] comes forth
[1:14:00] the word comes with mercy because
[1:14:02] knowing that it's not just all the bad
[1:14:04] need mercy no
[1:14:05] the good need mercy some of the very
[1:14:08] true need
[1:14:09] mercy they believe things wrong thought
[1:14:12] things wrong
[1:14:13] they need the mercy of god but what is
[1:14:15] repentance it's turning from
[1:14:17] and turning to so when god reveals his
[1:14:20] word here
[1:14:21] to daniel daniel himself begins to go
[1:14:24] into prayer and begins to seek the face
[1:14:27] or
[1:14:27] the presence or the person of almighty
[1:14:30] god knowing
[1:14:31] that god has made a promise that he will
[1:14:35] visit israel right there in babylon
[1:14:39] think about it if god hasn't visited you
[1:14:41] or me
[1:14:42] where we were there would have been
[1:14:43] nothing that could have stirred us
[1:14:45] or motivated us to even rise up
[1:14:48] and move toward him but it is god
[1:14:51] coming and dealing with an individual
[1:14:54] right where he finds us
[1:14:55] he might have found you on a bar stool
[1:14:58] but he didn't come because you were in a
[1:14:59] bar
[1:15:00] he came because you belonged to him it
[1:15:02] was time
[1:15:04] [Applause]
[1:15:09] hallelujah it would be in effect
[1:15:13] think of this here is naomi out of the
[1:15:16] land
[1:15:18] naomi's out of the land her
[1:15:21] they went out of the land you know bad
[1:15:24] times our famine came up
[1:15:27] so they went out of the land but they
[1:15:29] got out of the land her husband dies
[1:15:32] her sons die and her she has her two
[1:15:35] daughter-in-laws
[1:15:36] ruth and orpha but naomi
[1:15:40] hears something
[1:15:43] that the lord has visited his people
[1:15:48] in the giving of bread now you know what
[1:15:50] bread is
[1:15:51] it's a staff of life are you with me
[1:15:54] bread is the staff of life remember they
[1:15:56] had man in the wilderness but jesus
[1:15:58] could announce
[1:15:59] i am the bread that coming down from out
[1:16:02] of heaven
[1:16:02] i'm not a slice of it i'm not a crumb of
[1:16:05] it i am
[1:16:06] the loaf i am the all of it i
[1:16:09] am the bread i am your sustainer i am
[1:16:11] your
[1:16:12] all in all bread is the life giver it's
[1:16:16] the staff
[1:16:17] of life and this she hears
[1:16:21] god had visited his people in giving
[1:16:24] them
[1:16:25] bread it was during the time
[1:16:28] of the barley season barley speaks of
[1:16:31] resurrection
[1:16:32] power where she begins to be stirred by
[1:16:35] hearing that
[1:16:36] god is moving there amongst his people
[1:16:39] brother whereas they were out in that
[1:16:41] land and god allowed everything else
[1:16:44] to fall apart it seemed no doubt that
[1:16:46] naomi could look at it and say
[1:16:48] my goodness all this was falling apart
[1:16:50] but she knew
[1:16:51] as a real jew that god will never blast
[1:16:54] outside of the land god can never put
[1:16:56] his blessings
[1:16:57] on outside of the land you realize even
[1:17:00] any actions or behavior thought or
[1:17:02] anything else
[1:17:03] god can never put a blessing on god can
[1:17:05] never lead you and i
[1:17:07] in the way that we're supposed to be led
[1:17:09] if we're outside of the land
[1:17:11] of the holy ghost are you hearing me
[1:17:14] god can't do it in that way so god draws
[1:17:17] or
[1:17:17] draws ruth or draws naomi back and when
[1:17:20] naomi comes back
[1:17:22] she's coming back home
[1:17:25] now i'm honest to say it like this this
[1:17:28] is here a type of
[1:17:30] even how that where not only israel
[1:17:33] but where the church of the living god
[1:17:36] would be called
[1:17:37] back into a place where the bread has
[1:17:40] been given
[1:17:42] be called back into a place of bethlehem
[1:17:45] being called back into a place where
[1:17:47] there were his resurrection power
[1:17:49] where rumors had been handed down
[1:17:51] through the ages
[1:17:52] is he the same is he not the same but
[1:17:55] now it's calling him back to a place
[1:17:57] to dissolve all doubts to settle the
[1:18:00] rumors
[1:18:00] to answer questions it's to bring them
[1:18:03] back into this place
[1:18:04] you see for naomi it wasn't good enough
[1:18:07] just to hear about god
[1:18:09] visiting his people with bread there
[1:18:11] began to be something stir
[1:18:13] in her heart i've got to get back home
[1:18:15] i've got to get back home
[1:18:16] i've got to get back home and orphan
[1:18:18] ruth said we're going to go with you
[1:18:20] but here the word comes and it presents
[1:18:23] there
[1:18:24] i have nothing to give you there's no
[1:18:26] husbands would you wait
[1:18:27] long enough for them to get old and just
[1:18:29] when she begins to present it
[1:18:31] in that way orpha looks at it but
[1:18:34] orpha's view is such a temporal view
[1:18:36] orpha does not have any vision it's not
[1:18:39] any spiritual inspiration
[1:18:41] or for only sees good lord what is this
[1:18:43] in here for me you see
[1:18:45] orpha's not being moved in the right
[1:18:47] direction she kisses
[1:18:49] her mother-in-law and goes right back
[1:18:51] into the idolatry
[1:18:52] that she had come out of so-called and
[1:18:55] what do you find with ruth
[1:18:56] ruth herself she doesn't know what's
[1:18:58] going to befall her
[1:19:00] but what she does know is that where you
[1:19:02] go
[1:19:03] i'm going where you sleep i'm sleeping
[1:19:05] your god
[1:19:06] is going to be my god
[1:19:10] she didn't have a promise over there
[1:19:13] she's a moabite oh preach with me now
[1:19:17] as a matter of fact among that of israel
[1:19:20] god had said don't even let
[1:19:21] a moabite come into the congregation for
[1:19:23] 400 generations
[1:19:25] is that right they're not even to come
[1:19:27] in here 440 but you understand what i'm
[1:19:30] saying
[1:19:30] how that there was not even anything
[1:19:32] that she could look and say
[1:19:34] my this is a promise she didn't have a
[1:19:36] promise
[1:19:37] but there was a spiritual inspiration
[1:19:40] that was moving in her heart she just
[1:19:43] knew that there was something there for
[1:19:46] her she didn't know
[1:19:48] that she was gonna be married to the
[1:19:50] lord of the harvest
[1:19:51] she didn't know she would end up
[1:19:53] receiving
[1:19:54] handfuls of grain in his field she did
[1:19:57] not know
[1:19:58] that it would be through her life that
[1:20:00] would actually
[1:20:01] bear forth a child that would be the
[1:20:04] nourisher
[1:20:05] of strength to naomi she didn't know
[1:20:08] that
[1:20:11] but spiritual inspiration
[1:20:15] caught her heart
[1:20:19] you see it just shows there's nothing
[1:20:22] that comes easy
[1:20:24] nothing it's not about our works
[1:20:28] but nothing comes easy
[1:20:33] the bible says that we press into it
[1:20:39] opposition was against ruth
[1:20:42] there might not have been people
[1:20:43] standing there with spears but she had
[1:20:45] every type of thing trying to shoot
[1:20:47] through her mind
[1:20:48] and tell her why she wasn't worthy tell
[1:20:51] her what kind of a race she was of
[1:20:53] but there was something beneath that
[1:20:55] that was not a moabite
[1:20:57] it was a gene of god on the inside
[1:21:00] under that inspiration that gene of god
[1:21:02] was responding to the voice of god
[1:21:05] as it went on it began to identify more
[1:21:07] and more i'm a daughter of god i'm a
[1:21:09] daughter of god is that right
[1:21:10] so much to where naomi would eventually
[1:21:12] ask her and when it comes to a place
[1:21:14] after visitations
[1:21:15] with with boaz and as she comes back
[1:21:17] with the six handfuls of grain
[1:21:19] she asked her what is your name naomi
[1:21:22] knows it
[1:21:23] naomi knows her name she said i am ruth
[1:21:27] she was able to identify herself i
[1:21:30] am his beloved
[1:21:36] oh my back to him back to pentecost
[1:21:43] see pentecost is not an organization
[1:21:47] sometimes you know there's been where
[1:21:49] you hear quotes and things that are used
[1:21:51] well i'm pentecostal from the crown of
[1:21:53] my head to the souls of my feet but if
[1:21:54] you can't live the word you're not
[1:21:56] pentecostal
[1:21:57] you might be pentecostal by a name or an
[1:21:59] organization or a few quotes that's been
[1:22:01] patched together and everything else
[1:22:03] pentecostal is not an emotion
[1:22:06] pentecost simply put in the prophet's
[1:22:08] word spoken words original seed
[1:22:10] pentecost is god it's where
[1:22:13] deity comes down on the inside
[1:22:16] they have been keeping pentecost after
[1:22:18] pentecost after pentacles but one day
[1:22:21] pentecost fully yeah
[1:22:25] this was no longer the type this was the
[1:22:27] antitype
[1:22:29] now came back to the place to give you
[1:22:31] back the land that really belongs to you
[1:22:33] this was a place where satan had robbed
[1:22:35] you of the privilege of being a son and
[1:22:37] daughter of god
[1:22:38] now the real sounding on the day of
[1:22:40] pentecost and the outpouring of the holy
[1:22:42] ghost what would it do
[1:22:43] it would bring back the children of god
[1:22:45] into the rightful position
[1:22:47] in jesus christ by the baptism of the
[1:22:51] holy ghost
[1:22:51] you see we can never come back into
[1:22:54] position
[1:22:55] outside of the world and the spirit
[1:22:58] and you can't separate the two they go
[1:23:01] together
[1:23:03] i want you to think of this here just
[1:23:04] for a moment i realize i'm not going to
[1:23:06] get to where i wanted to get to today
[1:23:08] but
[1:23:12] you know in the scriptures it speaks of
[1:23:15] how
[1:23:16] jesus gives this parable that there was
[1:23:18] a great supper
[1:23:20] that was made a great meal he calls it
[1:23:22] in the book of matthew he says it was a
[1:23:25] a great supper for his
[1:23:28] son a certain man
[1:23:31] and he gave out this invitation and when
[1:23:34] he gave out this invitation
[1:23:37] they will immediately begin to now think
[1:23:39] of it
[1:23:40] everything's already provided for you
[1:23:44] i'm going to say something not very
[1:23:45] spiritual but it'll help you understand
[1:23:47] it i mean hey
[1:23:48] i like the grilled food that i don't
[1:23:50] have to grill i don't mind growing
[1:23:52] i know my wife well she she enjoys when
[1:23:54] i take her out to eat or
[1:23:55] maybe i you know cook dinner or
[1:23:56] something like that put things together
[1:23:58] and be able to do that and help out and
[1:24:00] so forth i might be getting you brothers
[1:24:01] in some hot water but
[1:24:03] it's okay you could stick with your
[1:24:04] hamburger helper
[1:24:06] but you see who wouldn't want anything
[1:24:08] that's provided for you
[1:24:10] right right it's it's not a meal that
[1:24:12] you show up and say
[1:24:13] man you know this you don't want to top
[1:24:14] this off if you had garlic rolls on the
[1:24:16] side no
[1:24:17] he's got it all prepared
[1:24:21] everything that you
[1:24:24] need
[1:24:29] and so he sent out his servants and he
[1:24:32] said go tell him
[1:24:34] come it's ready
[1:24:38] and they went out amongst the people
[1:24:40] come
[1:24:41] the supper's made ready
[1:24:44] the bible says they all with one
[1:24:47] consent begin to make
[1:24:51] excuses
[1:24:56] one said i've got an oxen i got to break
[1:24:58] in
[1:25:00] um i just bought a piece of land i need
[1:25:02] to go plow that
[1:25:03] i just married a wife and on and on
[1:25:06] begin to be
[1:25:08] excuses
[1:25:11] let me just pause here for a minute as
[1:25:12] he brings something to me
[1:25:14] you recall in the scriptures where
[1:25:16] elijah come to elisha
[1:25:18] he didn't tell elisha this is what god
[1:25:20] told me you're to stand in my room after
[1:25:22] i go
[1:25:23] he didn't tell him that but he just
[1:25:25] simply passed by
[1:25:27] and he put the mantle right and took it
[1:25:29] off and elisha said
[1:25:31] i'm going going where
[1:25:35] i didn't say nothing to you you didn't
[1:25:37] have to
[1:25:38] his presence let me know that i'm done
[1:25:42] with plowing my plowing days
[1:25:45] glory are finished the mantle let him
[1:25:49] know
[1:25:50] and here's what he asked him let me
[1:25:54] let me take care of this let me just you
[1:25:56] know
[1:25:57] kill the oxen let me just burn
[1:25:58] everything up and elijah said
[1:26:01] go ahead go ahead and do it what do they
[1:26:04] have to do with me
[1:26:06] so he took care of all of that then you
[1:26:08] find him
[1:26:09] pursuing elijah he never lost sight of
[1:26:12] elijah now move to the new testament you
[1:26:16] remember in the new testament
[1:26:17] when the lord jesus made a call upon a
[1:26:19] person
[1:26:20] and they said lord i'll follow you but
[1:26:23] let me go tell my daddy
[1:26:24] and my mama and i got somebody to bury
[1:26:27] then they go dad let me go do that and
[1:26:29] jesus said
[1:26:31] no for whoever does that's
[1:26:34] not worthy to follow me you see what the
[1:26:37] word was showing you and i
[1:26:38] it discerns what is first priority
[1:26:43] it was in elijah's heart to clear
[1:26:45] everything out of the way
[1:26:47] i don't want nothing holding me back
[1:26:51] from following you fully
[1:26:54] i want to burn every bridge i don't want
[1:26:56] nothing that's left behind because i
[1:26:59] am going to receive a double portion
[1:27:02] of that spirit
[1:27:05] they begin to make excuses i mean think
[1:27:07] of it the excuses they made
[1:27:10] this was not just an ordinary dinner
[1:27:12] this was the evening time meal
[1:27:15] of the prophecy of the messiah
[1:27:19] what they had been waiting on expecting
[1:27:22] waiting for this to come they had been
[1:27:24] taking passover after passover they had
[1:27:26] been going through all the feasts
[1:27:28] here was the real real
[1:27:32] feast what was this speaking of
[1:27:35] of him the true atonement
[1:27:38] of him who's the supreme sacrifice
[1:27:42] of his own life the outpouring of his
[1:27:45] spirit at pentecost
[1:27:47] but instead they rejected it
[1:27:51] now they had excuses they had excuses
[1:27:55] but see those excuses
[1:27:58] it calls then the man who made the
[1:28:01] supper
[1:28:02] he said i want you to go out into the
[1:28:05] highways
[1:28:06] and byways i want you to compel
[1:28:11] lives to my supper
[1:28:15] showing that the jews they rejected that
[1:28:18] there
[1:28:19] they rejected that they will get their
[1:28:22] pentecost 144 000 will
[1:28:26] we're living in the time of that once
[1:28:29] again
[1:28:29] in this hour it's a great supper it
[1:28:32] didn't say it was a great
[1:28:33] breakfast it didn't say it was a great
[1:28:35] lunch it's a
[1:28:36] supper an evening time meal
[1:28:41] it was in the evening time when god
[1:28:44] came to abraham it was in the evening
[1:28:47] time
[1:28:47] where he met abram after the battle was
[1:28:50] over
[1:28:51] and gave him red and white it was in the
[1:28:53] evening time
[1:28:55] what jesus said except you eat the flesh
[1:28:57] of the son of man
[1:28:58] and drink his blood you have no life in
[1:29:01] you
[1:29:03] it was an evening time prophecy
[1:29:08] to come and be a partaker of it just
[1:29:10] don't be around it
[1:29:12] god didn't call you to be a server here
[1:29:14] he called you to be a partaker
[1:29:17] god called you to eat of this bread of
[1:29:19] life
[1:29:20] god called you to drink of this wine he
[1:29:23] calls you to be a partaker
[1:29:28] hallelujah and even you ruth
[1:29:31] rahab when you didn't feel worthy but
[1:29:34] the holy spirit
[1:29:35] drew you it compelled you beyond your
[1:29:39] doubts
[1:29:40] beyond your unbelief the holy spirit has
[1:29:43] dealt
[1:29:43] with your life to bring you to a point
[1:29:46] to say
[1:29:46] yes lord it's you that i must have
[1:29:53] an expected end back to him
[1:30:01] let me just end on this here
[1:30:12] but braham says it like this and proving
[1:30:13] his word
[1:30:19] he's talking about praying for the sick
[1:30:22] he's getting ready to preach that
[1:30:23] message
[1:30:24] proving his word and he said before we
[1:30:27] pray for the sick
[1:30:30] we've got to get the people in that
[1:30:31] attitude it's the attitude that always
[1:30:34] brings the results
[1:30:37] it's the attitude that you take towards
[1:30:38] god
[1:30:41] here's a woman touched his garment she
[1:30:44] was healed
[1:30:45] with a blood issue a soldier spit in his
[1:30:48] face
[1:30:49] and put a crown of thorns on his head
[1:30:52] and felt no virtue at all
[1:30:55] it's your approach the attitude is what
[1:30:59] it takes
[1:31:00] that's what it is tonight dear friend it
[1:31:02] takes the attitude
[1:31:04] we are and believe that we are in the
[1:31:07] presence of jesus christ do we believe
[1:31:08] that
[1:31:10] we're in the presence of jesus christ
[1:31:14] but it's your attitude that brings the
[1:31:16] results
[1:31:18] the mechanics is here so is the dynamics
[1:31:22] if you can just get started
[1:31:26] god will do the rest
[1:31:34] if you can just get started
[1:31:37] god will do the rest
[1:31:41] how do i get started believing
[1:31:46] believing not just not just something we
[1:31:49] just say well i just believe you lord
[1:31:51] but
[1:31:52] really if there's anything at all you
[1:31:55] can say from your heart lord
[1:31:56] clear out all unbelief lord unbelief
[1:31:59] sometimes you look unbelief say well i
[1:32:01] don't smoke i don't drink i don't no no
[1:32:03] unbelief is doubt unbelief is things
[1:32:06] that we can even say god
[1:32:08] clear out my mind lord lord forgive me
[1:32:11] for even
[1:32:12] entertaining thoughts of doubt
[1:32:16] it's not doubt about his word but you
[1:32:17] would entertain thoughts or entertain
[1:32:19] thoughts where the
[1:32:20] enemy trying to poke something down and
[1:32:21] say lord forgive me lord jesus what is
[1:32:26] it doing
[1:32:26] it's dismissing unbelief you see
[1:32:28] remember when daniel
[1:32:30] understood what did understanding do
[1:32:33] it brought repentance what did that do
[1:32:36] that made a way remember when john the
[1:32:38] baptist come he had to make a way
[1:32:40] for the king to come you see the word is
[1:32:43] not only what brings us in position
[1:32:45] but it's the same word that makes a way
[1:32:49] for the king to come it's the word that
[1:32:52] deals with our heart
[1:32:54] it's the word that calls us back to him
[1:32:56] it's
[1:32:57] it's the word as he deals with
[1:33:00] our lives to bring us into that place i
[1:33:03] think that's very powerful
[1:33:05] if we can just get started god will do
[1:33:07] the rest
[1:33:10] now think about that here this morning
[1:33:13] we can just get started
[1:33:15] he's here why how do i start just
[1:33:18] just get in him just kidding in him he
[1:33:20] said well brother samuel
[1:33:21] i believe i am in him as a born-again
[1:33:24] child of god but just get in the spirit
[1:33:25] that's right here right now
[1:33:27] just just enter right into that and say
[1:33:29] yes lord
[1:33:30] be it unto me if you found that maybe
[1:33:33] maybe there's things that
[1:33:34] you didn't mean to but it just kind of
[1:33:36] taken even your focus off things you've
[1:33:38] let other things crowd in on your life
[1:33:40] or
[1:33:40] things maybe it's hardened you well
[1:33:42] whatever it is god's dealt with you
[1:33:44] personally you don't need me to call
[1:33:45] that out
[1:33:46] god can do that but you know that very
[1:33:48] person the presence of god
[1:33:50] is right before your tent door he's
[1:33:53] right before your heart
[1:33:55] and all it takes is just simply let
[1:33:58] letting god have his way say lord
[1:34:00] forgive me lord jesus
[1:34:02] lord i want to abide in the in the land
[1:34:05] where the blessings are
[1:34:06] we're the real blessings of god not
[1:34:08] sensations where there's
[1:34:09] real blessings in our life where the
[1:34:12] fruit of the word
[1:34:13] comes to pass in our life where the word
[1:34:15] is brought to pass i
[1:34:16] i want to dwell there lord back to you
[1:34:18] where it's
[1:34:19] my eyes off of myself
[1:34:23] oh i'm not that bear i'm not that good
[1:34:25] of a christian forsake that kind of a
[1:34:27] thought
[1:34:27] that's not what god come to do but god
[1:34:30] comes to bring a reflection in our life
[1:34:32] and for us to look at where he's calling
[1:34:33] us to not to waller
[1:34:35] just simply stand in your heart and say
[1:34:37] god forgive me lord i want to rise
[1:34:40] beyond this
[1:34:41] i want to press beyond this maybe you're
[1:34:44] in a place of a stalemate god i'm gonna
[1:34:46] press beyond this
[1:34:48] how do you what about the samuel how can
[1:34:49] you say that because it's about
[1:34:52] him lord i want the holy ghost more than
[1:34:56] anything lord because it's about him
[1:35:01] i want deliverance lord because it's
[1:35:04] about
[1:35:05] him maybe it should be setting sin
[1:35:09] in your life lord i want more of you

[1:35:37] already in his heart are you with me
[1:35:39] daniel was standing there as a believer
[1:35:41] and there was inspiration that fell on
[1:35:44] the children of god in that hour
[1:35:46] did they have opposition brother aaron
[1:35:48] they had all kinds of opposition
[1:35:50] they had opposition of bandits that were
[1:35:52] waiting to take the treasuries
[1:35:54] that was headed after they had already
[1:35:56] uh you know uh
[1:35:58] laid the foundation and gonna build the

[1:36:02] how we're gonna get this treasure that's
[1:36:04] been given to us

[1:36:25] wall a fox could run through it
[1:36:27] there were all sorts of things to try to

[1:36:31] discouragement but let me tell you
[1:36:33] something faithful
[1:36:34] is he who called you who also
[1:36:37] will do it

[1:49:30] [Music]
[1:49:41] i jesus want to
[1:49:44] see
[1:49:48] as you keep playing that song i think
[1:49:50] about brother branham
[1:49:51] as he stood there in the message images
[1:49:53] of christ
[1:49:55] the brahman preaches as he goes through
[1:49:56] that message the tabernacle is getting
[1:49:58] ready to have a revival start into
[1:50:00] revival services
[1:50:02] brother bran says i intend
[1:50:05] while this tabernacle is having a
[1:50:07] revival i want to have one myself
[1:50:11] he said i want more of the holy ghost
[1:50:14] to take over more of william branham
[1:50:17] he said that's the biggest enemy i've
[1:50:19] got the brother band will come at the
[1:50:21] end
[1:50:22] of that service he says i want more of
[1:50:24] the holy ghost
[1:50:26] to make me more of a servant
[1:50:29] like he was i want more
[1:50:32] of him i find brother branham at the end
[1:50:35] of recognizing its day and its message
[1:50:37] he would say god create in me
[1:50:41] a revival create in me lord
[1:50:45] what's needed where i lack
[1:50:48] create in me
[1:50:52] oh glory be to god this is our desire i
[1:50:55] want more
[1:50:57] i want more of him i want more i want
[1:51:01] more of him
[1:51:02] more of his life think of how things
[1:51:05] within brother brown's ministry here
[1:51:08] think about it after the opening of the
[1:51:11] seals
[1:51:13] one of the greatest events
[1:51:16] throughout history and brother branham
[1:51:19] is at the point
[1:51:21] of saying i'm going off the field he's
[1:51:25] discouraged
[1:51:27] he says it seems like when i preach
[1:51:30] people continue to do the same things
[1:51:32] well brother friends come into town pin
[1:51:34] your hair up so you don't want to preach
[1:51:35] on short hair and hold on
[1:51:37] you know what brother brandon told us he
[1:51:39] said i've developed
[1:51:40] a complex
[1:51:43] [Music]
[1:51:45] how what was that complex
[1:51:48] [Music]
[1:51:50] but then goes in to explain it over and
[1:51:52] over as he walks through he says because
[1:51:53] i have wanted to see this operate
[1:51:55] in such perfection but it wasn't
[1:51:59] up to him to operate it in perfection
[1:52:02] it was god who was perfect
[1:52:07] to me i'm so thankful for these examples
[1:52:10] in the message it gives me
[1:52:13] it gives me great encouragement because
[1:52:16] you see the battles you see
[1:52:17] the things that can come up things that
[1:52:19] all of a sudden where
[1:52:21] it can move him or it's not christ
[1:52:24] it's being the center within it but then
[1:52:26] how god can bring it right back around
[1:52:27] and say
[1:52:30] you want to make that decision you want
[1:52:32] to go off that way your wife will leave
[1:52:34] you
[1:52:34] this will take place and that will take
[1:52:36] but it's your choice
[1:52:38] but he came back to a place
[1:52:41] god turned it around
[1:52:45] god didn't come down and the complex
[1:52:47] lifted from me just like that
[1:52:49] it didn't happen that way but i'm going
[1:52:51] to stay right here
[1:52:52] and preach and just let god work it out
[1:52:55] in my life
[1:52:57] but you see what's powerful is when a
[1:52:59] person first recognizes
[1:53:01] this is a problem or this is a hindrance
[1:53:05] or it's in the way and then recognizing
[1:53:08] and begin to submit it to god
[1:53:10] and let god dissolve it god ain't
[1:53:13] looking down on you saying
[1:53:14] my goodness how could you get that
[1:53:15] complex how could that have happened how
[1:53:17] could you have gotten weary
[1:53:18] how could no his desire is
[1:53:21] he wants his word to come to pass in our
[1:53:24] life
[1:53:24] but he won't force himself god doesn't
[1:53:27] come down and
[1:53:28] force it no he needs us to yield
[1:53:33] so he'll come down and he draws deals
[1:53:35] with our life
[1:53:36] into that place where he's the focus of
[1:53:40] it
[1:53:41] he's the focus i'm glad about that
[1:53:44] aren't you
[1:53:45] i want more of that and brother braham
[1:53:48] says god
[1:53:49] create in me that what i lack what i
[1:53:51] need create
[1:53:53] stir it up in me to ask for it
[1:54:09] oh yes it's jesus
