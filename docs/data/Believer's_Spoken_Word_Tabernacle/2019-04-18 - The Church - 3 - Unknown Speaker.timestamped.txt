[35:50] thankful for the fellowship a man of one

[35:57] verse 13 and we'd like to begin just a
[36:00] few verses of Scripture now the god of
[36:03] Hope fill you with all joy and peace in
[36:06] believing that you may abound in Hope
[36:09] through the power of the Holy Ghost and
[36:11] I myself also am persuaded of you my
[36:15] brethren that ye also are full of
[36:17] goodness filled with all knowledge able
[36:20] also to admonish one another
[36:23] nevertheless brethren I have written the
[36:26] more boldly unto you in some sort as
[36:29] putting you in mind because of the grace
[36:31] that is given to me of God
[36:34] that I should be the minister of Jesus
[36:37] Christ to the Gentiles ministering the
[36:40] gospel of God that the offering up of
[36:43] the Gentiles might be acceptable being
[36:47] sanctified by the Holy Ghost amen may
[36:51] God bless you and bless His Word as
[36:53] you're being seated
[36:57] we we've been looking at this aspect
[37:00] throughout or this part throughout the
[37:04] past Thursdays and dealing with how that
[37:08] God would make known the the mystery of
[37:14] his will and calling out a Gentile bride
[37:17] and where we've been looking at that is
[37:21] looking there within the seventy weeks
[37:24] of Daniel and then looking at the last
[37:26] week knowing in that last week of how
[37:29] that Christ the Lord Jesus Christ he
[37:32] came and in the midst of that week he
[37:34] was cut off was three-and-a-half years
[37:37] of his ministry was cut off and then
[37:40] there's to be a resuming of that week
[37:42] within Israel but in the midst of the
[37:45] week here where he's been cut off we
[37:48] understand that all of that that the
[37:50] Jews they were blinded for our sake they
[37:54] they knew they knew the covenants they
[37:57] knew the promises they knew what was
[38:00] wrote there within the scriptures and to
[38:02] think about it that hound that if you
[38:04] would if we could look at it like this
[38:06] they knew the Scriptures and things so
[38:08] well that they probably could quote the
[38:11] one that you were quoting the before and
[38:13] afterwards but you begin to see that
[38:16] within all of this that was hidden
[38:18] within within the scriptures and how all
[38:20] of this would come out it would have it
[38:23] would be God that would reveal this when
[38:25] it was time for this mystery to be made
[38:28] known and when a mystery is made known
[38:30] we realised that God just doesn't unveil
[38:33] or unfold his word without there being a
[38:36] people who would be the match piece to
[38:38] that word that's being ministered or to
[38:41] be the expression of that word and we
[38:44] see how that Paul would make mention
[38:46] here by the unction of the Holy Spirit
[38:49] and Paul as we were looking at that in
[38:51] the scriptures I know many of these
[38:52] places that are familiar to us but Paul
[38:55] would write and say how that this
[38:57] revelation of that mystery that was
[39:00] hidden in God was made known to me by
[39:03] revelation and that that grace the grace
[39:06] of God that that might be minister
[39:09] among the Gentiles and to see that how
[39:12] that with with this where you and I were
[39:15] at of how that God would move upon Paul
[39:18] within that hour and the unction of the
[39:20] Holy Spirit as Paul would be able to
[39:23] declare as what we're reading here I'm a
[39:25] minister of Jesus Christ unto the
[39:28] Gentiles Paul administer the redeeming
[39:31] grace that that revelation would be so
[39:33] clear with that of Paul and has it would
[39:35] be ministered it would be more than just
[39:37] Paul's words and it's more than just
[39:40] what Paul was saying we know that what
[39:42] Paul was saying it was an unction by the
[39:44] Spirit of God and even though within
[39:47] that time to think about it Paul would
[39:49] be out there and he would be ministering
[39:51] among the Gentiles entombed who he was
[39:54] sent and without them even having a
[39:56] prior knowledge or any prior
[39:58] understanding of any covenants but yet
[40:00] the Holy Spirit would be able to so move
[40:03] upon the hearts of those who were
[40:05] actually ordained in that hour that when
[40:07] the Spirit of God would move upon their
[40:09] hearts through the preaching of the word
[40:11] it would it would cause faith to rise
[40:13] within their hearts within that word and
[40:16] there would be an understanding that
[40:18] would break upon their hearts and that's
[40:20] the same way that it is with you and I'm
[40:22] when the Spirit of God takes the word
[40:24] and he begins to break that word to our
[40:27] heart there's an understanding that
[40:28] breaks over our life that an
[40:31] understanding that man himself could
[40:33] never give to us but it's an
[40:34] understanding by an unction of the Holy
[40:36] Spirit taking that word and it says
[40:39] though that the word that we have read
[40:41] now it becomes an open to us or you take
[40:44] somebody who doesn't even know the
[40:46] scriptures whatsoever but yet they're
[40:48] ordained as a part of the body of Jesus
[40:51] Christ there will be something about the
[40:53] gospel that will sound and ring within
[40:56] their heart and something that they
[40:58] themselves cannot explain they can't get
[41:00] away from it but there is that that part
[41:03] that is ordained to live that is down
[41:05] there within them that when they hear
[41:07] the gospel trumpet it's something that
[41:10] raises within them to recognize that
[41:13] corresponding call I'm thankful for the
[41:16] grace of God tonight that we can truly
[41:18] look at that and see that in our own
[41:21] life
[41:21] it's the sovereignty of God it's beyond
[41:24] I it's blood it is beyond it has been
[41:27] and it will be beyond our ability in
[41:29] ourselves to understand it's simply the
[41:33] work of the Holy Spirit moving upon what
[41:36] he has already for ordained and placed
[41:39] in our lives so Paul would be moved by
[41:42] the Spirit of God to think of this how
[41:44] that Paul would be moved to go back
[41:46] clear through the Old Testament and
[41:48] under the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[41:50] he would begin to bring forth these
[41:53] things as God would make known to him
[41:56] concerning that of a taking of a Gentile
[41:59] bride and Paul look how Paul would take
[42:02] this out and he would minister this
[42:04] because we know that he was unto Abraham
[42:07] and his seed where the promises made
[42:09] what's how Paul let me just read a few
[42:12] places here in Galatians 3 verse 7
[42:15] Paul said know you therefore that they
[42:17] which are of faith the same are the
[42:20] children of Abraham and the scripture
[42:22] foreseeing that God would justify the
[42:26] heathen through faith preached before
[42:29] the gospel unto Abraham saying in thee
[42:32] shall all nations be blessed so then
[42:36] they which be of faith are blessed with
[42:38] faithful Abraham notice the scriptures
[42:41] foreseen and how that the Holy Spirit
[42:44] would take and open that of the
[42:46] scriptures because remember it was no
[42:49] mystery that the Gentiles would be saved
[42:52] that was not a mystery that was wrote
[42:54] within the Old Testament that was wrote
[42:57] in many places all through that of the
[42:59] prophets down all the way through
[43:01] through the minor prophets so many
[43:02] places are put within there that was not
[43:05] a mystery even to think of how that when
[43:08] James would when there in acts 15 when
[43:11] he would talk and Peter you know they
[43:12] were giving witness where the Holy Ghost
[43:14] had fallen upon the house of Cornelius
[43:16] remember even James was saying how that
[43:20] in that time that Peter had testified
[43:22] that by the coming of the Holy Ghost
[43:24] there in the house of Cornelius it was
[43:27] God witnessing that he was going to take
[43:29] a people out of the Gentiles for his
[43:32] namesake but yet that understanding
[43:34] and that mystery as far as that of a
[43:37] bride of a wife that was not something
[43:39] that was given to Peter and to James at
[43:42] that time but that was given to Paul
[43:45] within that hour not to think about this
[43:47] let's just look at that scripture for a
[43:49] moment that the pouring out of the Holy
[43:51] Ghost and the giving of that of those
[43:54] seed that was gathered there within the
[43:56] house of Cornelius there a Gentile the
[43:59] pouring out of the Spirit of God is that
[44:01] where Peter could say that God was
[44:04] identifying he was taking a people out
[44:07] of the Gentiles for his name's sake
[44:09] because we realize that God's name is
[44:12] that of his life that in his nature that
[44:15] of his character he's pouring out of
[44:17] that life of that name of the Holy Ghost
[44:20] upon the believer so then it would and
[44:23] identifies then us as believers not with
[44:26] that of our first birth but now we have
[44:28] been lifted by the new birth and are
[44:30] identified in the name of the Lord Jesus
[44:33] Christ so now when we look at this
[44:36] notice how Paul is looking at the
[44:38] scripture this is why the Bible itself
[44:40] to a believer is not a book of history
[44:42] altogether but it is actually a book of
[44:45] prophecy and how to see that the one the
[44:49] very same Holy Spirit that moved upon
[44:51] the prophets the same one that there
[44:53] would be expressing this to Abraham Paul
[44:56] would pick it up and say the Scriptures
[44:58] foreseeing that God would justify the
[45:02] heathen by faith or through faith he
[45:05] preached the gospel unto Abraham now
[45:08] notice in Galatians three gone down
[45:10] there verse thirteen Christ hath
[45:12] redeemed us from the curse of the law
[45:14] being made a curse for us where it is
[45:17] written cursed is every one that hangeth
[45:19] on a tree that the blessing of Abraham
[45:22] might come on the Gentiles through Jesus
[45:26] Christ that we might receive the promise
[45:28] of the Spirit through faith so the
[45:33] promise and remember how Paul and he's
[45:35] dealing with this here with this among
[45:37] the Galatians because remember there
[45:39] were those of false brethren who had
[45:41] crept in and were trying to take the
[45:43] people away from the work of redeeming
[45:46] Grace and begin to try to put the people
[45:48] back on the dependency of works of the
[45:51] flesh and Paul AE lays it out here that
[45:54] this promise itself it was made before
[45:57] the law ever came into existence it is a
[46:00] promise that was made that man could
[46:02] never keep but God made the promise when
[46:05] he made it to Abraham and this is why
[46:08] the covenant to Abraham is not a
[46:10] conditional covenant but it's an
[46:12] unconditional covenant because God made
[46:15] it Abraham and said I will bless you I
[46:19] will do this I have already you see it
[46:23] was already an unconditioned because it
[46:25] was not based upon man's ability to keep
[46:28] it or man's ability to bring it forth
[46:31] I'm telling you tonight this is exactly
[46:33] where we are as the seed of Abraham we
[46:37] are under that unconditional covenant
[46:39] where it's not us it's not our strivings
[46:42] it's not everything that we can do it's
[46:45] what God has already done it's his
[46:48] working our yielding he's already done
[46:52] it that's why the preaching of the
[46:54] gospel it's all in that of a finished
[46:57] work that our faith might be come to a
[46:59] place that we can recognize that and
[47:02] rest in that finished work we realized
[47:04] that he's already healed us
[47:07] he's already healed us
[47:09] he's already provided all that we have
[47:12] need of it is necessary that our faith
[47:14] would raise in will finished work notice
[47:20] how Paul would go on to say in verse 16
[47:22] and to Abraham and his seed where the
[47:25] promises made and he saith not and to
[47:28] seeds as of many but as of one and to
[47:32] thy seed which is Christ suppose laying
[47:38] it down bees are where the promises lay
[47:40] for the believer the promises that
[47:43] belong to the believer to Abraham's seed
[47:46] is in Christ this is our place of
[47:51] promise this is where all the promises
[47:54] are met this is where all the promises
[47:57] are fulfilled
[47:58] this is where we receive and have our
[48:01] promises in Christ in him for ye notice
[48:08] he goes on to say for ye are all the
[48:11] children of God by faith in Christ Jesus
[48:16] Lord be to God for as many as you have
[48:20] been baptized into Christ have put on
[48:23] Christ remembrance we looked at that it
[48:27] was not something that you and I gave
[48:29] ourself estate but it's God that deposit
[48:32] in that faith a measure of faith was
[48:34] given to you and I is that right for it
[48:37] is by grace through faith that we are
[48:39] saved it was God that would place that
[48:41] faith within you and I at the hearing of
[48:44] that word that faith would rise within
[48:47] that word in then this time and how that
[48:50] God would draw you and I unto himself to
[48:53] a place of complete submission that's
[48:56] what it is to be baptized in Christ have
[48:59] put on Christ it's where our will has
[49:02] become so lost in his will
[49:04] just like they lay you down in the tank
[49:06] down there it's the same way that God
[49:08] Himself baptizes you and me into the
[49:12] body of Jesus Christ it's not our
[49:14] struggle
[49:15] it's our arrest there is neither look
[49:21] how look how this is brought forth there
[49:24] is neither Jew nor Greek there is
[49:26] neither bond nor free there is neither
[49:29] male nor female for ye are all one in
[49:33] Christ Jesus
[49:35] and if you be Christ's then are ye
[49:38] Abraham's seed and heirs according to
[49:42] the promise so if you are in Christ you
[49:46] are heirs of every promise and if the
[49:51] Holy Spirit is dealing with your life
[49:53] and he's calling you to that place let
[49:56] me tell you something the promise of the
[49:58] Holy Ghost is for you
[50:00] amen this promise is something that
[50:03] raises up that this promise of life this
[50:06] blessing of Abraham it's for me there's
[50:09] a longing a desire beyond
[50:11] just this life I'll tell you that's a
[50:15] blessing you realize that blessed are
[50:17] they that do hunger and thirst for
[50:18] righteousness for you shall be filled
[50:20] it's a blessing to even desire the Holy
[50:23] Ghost hallelujah now to think of this I
[50:29] want you just to think of this here for
[50:31] a moment of how that when we recognize
[50:36] how in the very beginning when God would
[50:39] lay things down in the book of Genesis
[50:41] that every seed was to bring forth of
[50:44] its own kind that a pine tree would
[50:47] produced the pine and so forth we could
[50:49] go on and on and it was to stay within
[50:52] that stay within that line of which God
[50:55] had made it so there would be that of a
[50:58] species that would be that which would
[51:00] be to continue and within that seed it
[51:03] would have within and let's say that of
[51:05] you know the the seed that would be
[51:07] within an orange tree it has within it
[51:09] there that that power to become
[51:11] whatsoever that God has spoken
[51:14] whatever God spoke that is what lays
[51:16] within that seed but all it takes is the
[51:19] right atmosphere it takes the right
[51:22] light takes the right moisture and then
[51:24] what has been spoken now becomes a
[51:27] manifestation so there within it how
[51:31] that we would find in the scriptures at
[51:34] one time you and I were not a people we
[51:40] were not a people but to think of how
[51:44] that God how that the Lord would look
[51:47] that wearing when we were not a people
[51:51] yet now in him we become a people one
[51:57] unit one body in him
[52:03] your fees - let's look at this for a
[52:06] moment
[52:07] Ephesians - Paul picks this up wherefore
[52:12] remember that ye being in time past
[52:15] Gentiles in the flesh who are called
[52:19] uncircumcision by that which is called
[52:21] the circumcision in the flesh made by
[52:24] hands that at that time ye were without
[52:27] Christ being aliens from the
[52:31] Commonwealth of Israel and strangers
[52:33] from the covenants of promise having no
[52:36] hope and without God in the world but
[52:41] now in Christ Jesus you sometimes were
[52:46] far off are made nigh by the blood of
[52:49] Christ for he is our peace who hath made
[52:53] both one and has broken down the middle
[52:55] wall of partition between us who did
[53:01] this he did it
[53:04] we didn't know nothing about it but he
[53:07] knew us we knew nothing about the
[53:11] covenants nothing about the Commonwealth
[53:13] of Israel but he knew us glory be to God
[53:21] hallelujah having abolished in his flesh
[53:25] the enmity even the law of Commandments
[53:29] contained in ordinances for to make
[53:31] himself of Twain one new man so making
[53:35] peace and that he might reconcile both
[53:39] unto God in one body by the cross having
[53:42] slain the enmity thereby and came and
[53:46] preached peace to you which were afar
[53:48] off and to them that were not you see
[53:51] God has no other way of getting out his
[53:54] message than by preaching it the opening
[53:58] what we read in Galatians 3 God preached
[54:01] the gospel to Abraham knew with me he
[54:06] never never turned it over to just the
[54:09] writings that they would read the
[54:11] writings there that would be given by
[54:13] Moses that in itself it would it would
[54:16] be God coming behind and preaching that
[54:19] word ministering those promises you
[54:21] realize that even when things themselves
[54:23] got under a burden when they were there
[54:26] building the tabernacle or the temple
[54:28] after they returned from Babylon you
[54:30] recognize the unction of the Holy Spirit
[54:32] that moves down and it picks up and
[54:35] begins to deal with the purpose among
[54:38] the people of God that they had slipped
[54:40] away from and the unction of the Holy
[54:42] Spirit begins to stir up what God has
[54:45] ordained for them to do so it's God
[54:48] communicated their the promises and
[54:50] preached this here under abraham notice
[54:53] how Paul would say and came and preached
[54:55] peace to you which were afar off and to
[54:58] them that were nigh so both to Gentiles
[55:00] and to Jews for through him we both have
[55:04] access by one spirit unto the Father is
[55:09] that right there were Jews there on the
[55:12] day of Pentecost that were born into the
[55:15] kingdom of God is that right
[55:17] then we find that how that that was open
[55:19] then we find with the house of Cornelius
[55:21] here is the key the Peter takes the key
[55:24] and that is open there in the house of
[55:26] Cornelius and the Holy Spirit is poured
[55:28] out upon the Gentiles remember the
[55:30] promise on the day of Pentecost was that
[55:33] as many as the Lord our God shall call
[55:36] even to them that are afar off that was
[55:39] speaking to you and I as the Gentiles no
[55:43] glory be to God but God was going to
[55:46] bring you and I not a man we would be
[55:50] brought nigh by the blood of Jesus
[55:52] Christ amen through that offering that
[55:55] was shared wearing back the Jews were
[55:57] blinded but yet through that offering
[56:00] there of the Holy Spirit now being
[56:02] released now through the offering of
[56:04] that blood you and I would be brought
[56:06] nigh and we're not just around the
[56:08] covenants but brother we have been
[56:10] brought into the covenant by the baptism
[56:13] of the holy ghost girl repeater God
[56:16] we're not just hanging around we're in
[56:19] Christ we're not just associated around
[56:24] something we're in Christ glory be to
[56:29] God think of it every time look when you
[56:33] look at Rahab's life Rahab could not
[56:37] just come into Israel
[56:39] so had to be a union a marriage that
[56:44] would bring her in is that right it had
[56:48] to be by that of a marriage and how that
[56:51] here she was outside of the camp but as
[56:53] she was outside of the camp it was some
[56:55] loaned them that would bring her in in
[56:58] through marriage so now here she is she
[57:01] comes in through him by the man it's not
[57:05] the woman that brings us into the
[57:07] covenants come on somebody it ain't
[57:10] about being a part of the church
[57:12] it's about being born of a man Christ
[57:14] Jesus he is the one that brings you and
[57:17] I into the covenants that's how it was
[57:21] with Ruth it was not Ruth bringing
[57:23] herself in but Ruth was a stranger is
[57:27] that right and they owe me herself even
[57:31] in the midst of herself where she said
[57:33] call me Mara call me that of bitter
[57:35] because of how that God has dealt with
[57:37] me remember here Ruth comes in in that
[57:40] time that says your God will be my god
[57:44] explain that to me you can't explain
[57:47] that the only thing that can be said is
[57:50] what the Prophet says in the Holy Ghost
[57:52] series where he said when a when Ruth
[57:54] forsook her land it was because Ruth had
[57:57] a vision what kind of a vision did she
[58:01] have it was something within her heart
[58:03] that was pulsating wherein Orpha was
[58:06] able to kiss the cheek of her mother and
[58:09] turned back but not Ruth Ruth herself
[58:12] said where you go I'm gonna go where you
[58:15] rest
[58:15] that's where Angela rest and your people
[58:18] will be my people they met your God will
[58:21] be my god I ask you what gave Ruth the
[58:25] love like that for Naomi it was ordained
[58:29] by God I ask you what is it that is
[58:34] given you and I beloved for one another
[58:36] it's ordained by God what is it that has
[58:40] put that the love and the desire to pray
[58:43] for the peace in Jerusalem for God to
[58:45] fulfill his word it's because Ruth
[58:48] Naomi Helen oh yeah we love Naomi
[58:55] because we realize that our time is
[59:00] ending she's gonna get her time we have
[59:10] access by one spirit unto the Father now
[59:16] therefore ye are no more strangers and
[59:20] foreigners but fellow-citizens with the
[59:28] Saints and of the household of God and
[59:32] are built upon the foundation of the
[59:34] apostles and prophets Jesus Christ
[59:36] Himself being the chief Cornerstone
[59:42] and one time we were strangers no longer
[59:47] are we strangers amen a stranger meaning
[59:52] one who lives in a place without the
[59:55] rights of citizenship they live in this
[59:59] place but they don't have rights that
[1:00:00] citizens have you and I did not have
[1:00:05] rights within that of the Covenant but
[1:00:08] through Jesus Christ by the Spirit he
[1:00:13] made known to you and I this is your
[1:00:15] rights through union with me we are
[1:00:23] fellow citizens amen we possess the same
[1:00:29] citizenship with others you realize what
[1:00:34] it means to have citizenship in heaven
[1:00:39] you've got citizenship and let me say
[1:00:43] this to you it wasn't something that you
[1:00:46] married it it wasn't something that you
[1:00:49] earned you were always a part of it but
[1:00:54] the Holy Spirit came and sought you out
[1:00:57] and he makes what now would be your
[1:01:01] you're a stranger he unfolds himself to
[1:01:04] you
[1:01:05] and he brings you and I into him and we
[1:01:08] are therefore fellow citizens we have
[1:01:10] the rights as a citizen Tory that's why
[1:01:17] Paul was letting it be known whether you
[1:01:19] Jew whether you're Gentile whether
[1:01:21] you're Vince whether you're that but in
[1:01:23] Christ we are one because it's not a
[1:01:28] nationality that God is highlighting but
[1:01:32] God is highlighting himself in the life
[1:01:35] of the believer and that's what the
[1:01:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost does when we
[1:01:40] are brought into Christ it highlights
[1:01:42] our citizenship in him you realize what
[1:01:46] I'm talking about you off time you want
[1:01:49] many times there's places you come into
[1:01:51] and you sometimes you can even tell by
[1:01:53] the way people walk
[1:01:55] by the way they talk by the way they act
[1:01:58] you you begin to say hey you're not from
[1:02:00] this country are you you understand you
[1:02:07] know there was a time and I know I
[1:02:08] mentioned this tree before there's many
[1:02:10] times where they would say people would
[1:02:11] say I can tell you're American how
[1:02:13] because the way you walk I don't even
[1:02:16] know I walked round but that's what they
[1:02:18] said but we can tell you America without
[1:02:22] me even saying anything you understand
[1:02:26] but you see here's the reality when we
[1:02:30] look at this it is not something where
[1:02:32] you and I have to make ourselves
[1:02:34] something but the citizenship of heaven
[1:02:37] becomes reflected in our life because
[1:02:40] what our lives our lives reflect that
[1:02:43] country from which we have been birthed
[1:02:45] by the spirit of that land by the new
[1:02:48] birth and we reflect the citizenship of
[1:02:51] that heavenly country that's why that
[1:02:53] our sisters don't cut their hair it's
[1:02:55] because they're reflecting the
[1:02:57] citizenship of that country that's why
[1:02:59] we don't wear makeup because we're
[1:03:01] reflecting the citizenship of that
[1:03:03] country that's why we don't drink and
[1:03:05] lie and run around and over because
[1:03:08] we're reflecting the citizenship of that
[1:03:10] country hallelujah we've been born of
[1:03:15] that life we are citizens we are
[1:03:18] strangers here but were not strangers in
[1:03:21] him every promise belongs to you and I
[1:03:27] as believers pearl repeater God Amen
[1:03:34] fellow citizens with the Saints
[1:03:38] and of the household of God amen
[1:03:42] household belonging it's dealing with
[1:03:45] will you know with the household you've
[1:03:46] got your household I've got my household
[1:03:50] but this household we're talking about
[1:03:52] is the household of God amen the Church
[1:03:57] of the Living God amen Paul he goes on
[1:04:00] to describing in verse 21 in whom all
[1:04:03] the building in whom all the building
[1:04:06] fitly framed together groweth unto a
[1:04:09] holy temple in the Lord in whom ye also
[1:04:11] are builded together for in habitation
[1:04:14] of God through the spirit God assembling
[1:04:19] assembling each one where we were
[1:04:24] strangers but now through him by the
[1:04:25] blood of Jesus Christ we who were far
[1:04:28] off are made nigh
[1:04:34] for God to come and dwell remember this
[1:04:38] we're looking at that we were not a
[1:04:39] people remember how God would talk to
[1:04:43] Israel God would mention the Israel in
[1:04:46] Exodus 19 also in the book of
[1:04:48] Deuteronomy if you obey my voice
[1:04:52] you'll heed my Commandments then you'll
[1:04:55] be unto me a peculiar treasure above all
[1:05:00] the people of the world of this earth is
[1:05:04] that right so what is it that would
[1:05:07] separate the people from Israel from the
[1:05:10] rest of the nations what wasn't it would
[1:05:15] be the Living God as they would take the
[1:05:19] word and live by the word then it would
[1:05:22] actually separate them from the rest of
[1:05:25] the nations we understand that it was
[1:05:27] more than just them taking the word but
[1:05:30] remember if they had a heart listen to
[1:05:32] me now if they had a heart that was
[1:05:34] submissive to the word then the presence
[1:05:36] of God was able to come behind that word
[1:05:39] and he would be as a living presence of
[1:05:42] God there in the midst of Israel and
[1:05:44] that is what made the difference
[1:05:46] they had different they had different
[1:05:49] statutes and judgments and Commandments
[1:05:51] oh that's true but there had to be the
[1:05:53] presence of the one who gave it to be
[1:05:56] present there
[1:05:57] is that right but you see how that none
[1:06:00] of that in itself it was only speaking
[1:06:02] that there would come a perfection
[1:06:05] whereby that God himself through the
[1:06:07] unconditional covenant would actually
[1:06:10] assemble our people and even out of that
[1:06:12] which is coming out of the Jews in the
[1:06:14] 144,000 but yet how that God would
[1:06:17] assemble a group and a body of believers
[1:06:20] that they would give themselves to the
[1:06:22] word and the word would be reflected in
[1:06:25] their life by the living presence of the
[1:06:28] Living God and through that word moving
[1:06:31] within our life it brings an assembling
[1:06:33] together you understand it's just like
[1:06:37] when you think about when we're
[1:06:38] recovering that in Ezekiel 37 when you
[1:06:41] look upon the valley of dry bones
[1:06:43] what is it that told this bone to unite
[1:06:46] with this bone you didn't have a leg
[1:06:49] bone down here in a hip socket come on
[1:06:53] somebody you didn't have a stall where a
[1:06:55] foot belong
[1:06:57] everything itself was in its proper
[1:07:00] place and order what was it it was the
[1:07:04] time of the prophecy that was going
[1:07:07] forth as that prophecy was being spoken
[1:07:09] it held within it that intelligence of
[1:07:12] God that would direct every one of those
[1:07:15] bones right to where they belonged in
[1:07:18] the body because all of those bones
[1:07:20] represented the house of Israel that's
[1:07:22] the same way that it's been down through
[1:07:24] the ages where when the prophecy of the
[1:07:27] word is being made known it assembles
[1:07:29] that which is a part of the body in that
[1:07:32] hour and it brings you and I into
[1:07:34] position it's not us bringing ourselves
[1:07:36] in position it is Christ himself through
[1:07:40] the revealing obvious word it brings you
[1:07:43] an eye into position Oh glory glory be
[1:07:47] to God that's why Peter could say but ye
[1:07:51] are a chosen generation a royal
[1:07:53] priesthood an holy nation a peculiar
[1:07:57] people that you should show forth the
[1:08:00] praises of him who hath called you out
[1:08:02] of darkness into his marvelous light
[1:08:04] which in time past were not a people
[1:08:07] watch how he picks this up from the book
[1:08:09] of Hosea in times past we were not a
[1:08:12] people but are now the people of God
[1:08:15] which had not obtained mercy but now
[1:08:18] have obtained mercy this word people
[1:08:22] here means it means that of those who
[1:08:26] are of the same stock and language
[1:08:30] we were not a people come on now we were
[1:08:36] all spread out throughout all nations
[1:08:40] but to think of how that the word itself
[1:08:43] how that God you can see how that God
[1:08:45] would direct so that the word would find
[1:08:47] and he will not in the renowned will not
[1:08:49] be one of his elect that are a part of
[1:08:52] that bride that will miss it that word
[1:08:54] will find everyone there will not be one
[1:08:56] of the bride body that will miss it that
[1:08:59] is God's word for God to see to it
[1:09:02] though you and I did not know we were of
[1:09:05] this stock but God knew like the woman
[1:09:10] at the word you might have been all
[1:09:11] covered over with all sorts of things
[1:09:13] but down beneath that there was that
[1:09:17] stop that was of the Tree of Life a lot
[1:09:21] of strains from the first birth but now
[1:09:23] through the new birth you receive that
[1:09:25] strain of predestination that was always
[1:09:29] ordained there and as the seed of life
[1:09:31] comes upon it it releases it a language
[1:09:37] think about it you and I were strangers
[1:09:39] we did not know this language
[1:09:44] come on somebody we didn't know this
[1:09:47] language you know what they tell you
[1:09:50] they tell you it's better if when you're
[1:09:54] one of your children is going to learn a
[1:09:55] language it's better that they learn it
[1:09:57] when they're baby coming up as a toddler
[1:10:01] this is why with the new birth there are
[1:10:04] companies a change of language Amen you
[1:10:07] aren't buying that the language of God
[1:10:09] where the church gets away from you
[1:10:12] understand what I'm talking about
[1:10:13] the language of God is the Holy Ghost if
[1:10:16] not talking about just Prince I'm not
[1:10:18] talking about just words I'm talking
[1:10:20] about the language and unction of the
[1:10:22] Holy Ghost
[1:10:24] hey man but we then are led by the
[1:10:28] Spirit of God oh my look how but you and
[1:10:32] I as Paul would say in another place he
[1:10:34] says that we are bound to give thanks
[1:10:36] only to God in 2nd Thessalonians 4 you
[1:10:39] brethren beloved of the Lord because God
[1:10:42] hath from the beginning chosen you to
[1:10:45] salvation through sanctification of the
[1:10:48] Spirit and belief of the truth well - he
[1:10:52] called you by our gospel to the
[1:10:55] obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus
[1:10:57] Christ you were chosen to salvation come
[1:11:03] on somebody and you were chosen to
[1:11:06] sanctification of the Spirit choosing
[1:11:10] God as he makes known his word what does
[1:11:13] it do it's a love affair it is that
[1:11:16] where his word comes forth and it brings
[1:11:19] a yielding in our life you see friends
[1:11:22] this is why many times people don't go
[1:11:24] any further because they stopped
[1:11:26] yielding you've got to keep yielding
[1:11:30] it's yielding its yielding even in that
[1:11:34] of the very change of the body
[1:11:36] it's yielding
[1:11:42] sometimes a person gets up and will huh
[1:11:45] I gotta quit this and I gotta stop that
[1:11:47] and I gotta do all that all of those
[1:11:49] things you're mindful of that but you
[1:11:52] need to remember you have been chosen
[1:11:55] under sanctification of the Spirit
[1:11:57] say Lord release more of the power that
[1:12:00] moved upon my life Lord and let there
[1:12:02] come the flow of sanctification by the
[1:12:05] spirit where it's able to release that
[1:12:08] cleansing and separate and remove all of
[1:12:11] those habits from the world you are
[1:12:14] ordained to receive that sanctification
[1:12:19] ordained of God to receive the Holy
[1:12:22] Ghost
[1:12:23] you are deigned of God that your vessel
[1:12:26] would stay clean and clear and pure
[1:12:28] before him aren't you glad my let me
[1:12:35] move here just a little bit I'm just
[1:12:36] gonna skip a few things Paul would go on
[1:12:41] and he would talk about even that of the
[1:12:43] household of faith look in Hebrews 11:7
[1:12:46] here you find that the Scripture speaks
[1:12:48] of how that Noah
[1:12:50] he was warned of God of things not seen
[1:12:54] as yet
[1:12:58] that which was spoken was not yet come
[1:13:04] there right but no event would deliver a
[1:13:07] message here's the mercy of God that God
[1:13:10] would send a message of impending
[1:13:12] judgment but if God sending a message of
[1:13:15] impending judgment remember with that
[1:13:17] message comes mercy and grace for those
[1:13:22] who will heed to the warning of that
[1:13:24] message that's coming just like when
[1:13:27] Jonah went down the Nineveh you asked me
[1:13:31] that Merton that message was taken there
[1:13:34] and those inhabitants of Nineveh were
[1:13:37] moved with repentance and God Himself
[1:13:41] removed from destruction is that right
[1:13:45] because they repented it turned away the
[1:13:48] wrath of Almighty God now the thing
[1:13:50] removed with fear prepared an ark to the
[1:13:53] saving of his house by the which he
[1:13:56] condemned the world and became heir of
[1:13:58] the righteousness which is by faith I
[1:14:01] just want to look at that just there for
[1:14:02] just a few moments when we look at that
[1:14:04] of Noah's house we recognize this is
[1:14:06] more than just when we look at it in the
[1:14:09] scripture of just Noah's natural house
[1:14:12] but Noah's house would have been that
[1:14:15] which would be under that message that
[1:14:18] he had given in that hour there were
[1:14:21] many who came around it scoffs added
[1:14:24] didn't understand it but yet there were
[1:14:26] those who are ordained of which God knew
[1:14:29] just how much room to prepare you
[1:14:33] understand they didn't have any extra
[1:14:35] rooms or we got adjoining rooms y'all
[1:14:37] can just take those chickens in you know
[1:14:39] we just we over planned no it was just
[1:14:42] what was needed but God ministered the
[1:14:48] word through Noah as though everybody
[1:14:52] could be saved is that right and there
[1:14:58] was a place of safety within that of the
[1:15:02] ark so it was that of the household
[1:15:04] those who would actually be birthed by
[1:15:06] that revelation that Noah had
[1:15:08] receive from God that place of safety
[1:15:10] now let me just keep skipping along here
[1:15:13] you realize that within the scripture
[1:15:15] how that God had even referred to
[1:15:17] Abraham when in Genesis 18 where he
[1:15:20] would reveal himself to Abraham and God
[1:15:22] would make known that Abraham himself he
[1:15:26] says I I can't hide from Abraham what
[1:15:29] I'm about to do seeing that with Abraham
[1:15:32] that she shall surely become a great and
[1:15:34] mighty nation and all the nations of the
[1:15:37] earth shall be blessed in him that was
[1:15:39] speaking about you and I is that right
[1:15:42] but to think how that that word that
[1:15:45] revelation would come forward and God
[1:15:47] had confidence in the revelation working
[1:15:51] through the elect seed of God that would
[1:15:53] come down there not everybody that can
[1:15:56] look back and say Abraham is my
[1:15:58] great-great-grandfather water not
[1:15:59] everybody was actually ordained and a
[1:16:02] part of that but there was some elect
[1:16:05] that were a part of the household of
[1:16:08] Abraham it was that which was a part of
[1:16:12] that promise that God had made to
[1:16:14] Abraham and to his seed you with me
[1:16:20] there were those that were looking for
[1:16:23] him
[1:16:24] there was inlet that we're looking for
[1:16:27] him is that right God would continue to
[1:16:31] open his word in his path down through
[1:16:33] there
[1:16:34] I got a hurry so we know and understand
[1:16:36] not to think of this the mystery of
[1:16:38] Abraham's household this is what I
[1:16:40] really want to just hone into just for a
[1:16:41] few moments that mystery of Abraham's
[1:16:43] household remember the Jews themselves
[1:16:45] you know even when it came you know to
[1:16:48] that of coming into the upper room
[1:16:51] remember they asked the Lord Jesus will
[1:16:53] at that time will that will thou at this
[1:16:55] time restore the kingdom unto Israel
[1:17:00] what they're asking him these are things
[1:17:02] that pertain to the Millennium when the
[1:17:05] kingdom will be set up on earth are you
[1:17:08] with me you see they didn't this this
[1:17:10] was not known but you see there was a
[1:17:12] household of Abraham and within the
[1:17:15] household it would be that that there
[1:17:17] would be that of the elect would be down
[1:17:20] through time that had been offering up
[1:17:22] the lamb in the place where God had
[1:17:26] chosen to place his name they would be
[1:17:29] offering the lamb now think of it they
[1:17:31] didn't see everything but it was by
[1:17:33] revelation let me just put it to you
[1:17:35] like this
[1:17:35] it's just how how it is to you and I got
[1:17:39] the revelation of Jesus Christ in this
[1:17:41] hour to our hearts it's the dearest
[1:17:43] thing that we have in this life is the
[1:17:45] revelation of Jesus Christ it's where we
[1:17:48] draw strength day by day it's the very
[1:17:50] thing that causes us to rise up in the
[1:17:53] morning that when all sorts of
[1:17:55] discouragement and everything will come
[1:17:57] away even in the midst of tests and
[1:17:59] trials what is it it's the revelation of
[1:18:01] Jesus Christ that has struck our hearts
[1:18:04] in that great Redemption there by the
[1:18:06] Holy Ghost and lets you and I know we
[1:18:09] are part of him and then this is the
[1:18:12] dearest part and dearest thing in our
[1:18:14] life that's why they were called
[1:18:17] pilgrims and strangers that revelation
[1:18:21] of the offering of the Lamb was not
[1:18:24] among the let has just something that
[1:18:27] was done it was an unction there was
[1:18:30] something inspired to their hearts just
[1:18:37] the way this word is inspired to you and
[1:18:40] I where others can look at it you don't
[1:18:44] have that same inspiration he doesn't
[1:18:47] have the same meaning but to you and I
[1:18:49] it's dear to our hearts hallelujah that
[1:18:54] is a separating Lord right there so to
[1:18:57] see this household of Abraham it would
[1:19:00] be that where the elect was offering
[1:19:02] down through time then you find here at
[1:19:04] the pouring out of the Holy Ghost you
[1:19:06] found that of Jews remember there was a
[1:19:08] remnant that was waiting on the coming
[1:19:11] of the Messiah
[1:19:12] right it was a small little group Semyon
[1:19:16] and a few others were waiting he's
[1:19:18] alright Jesus Church wasn't very big
[1:19:21] come on somebody it was a small church
[1:19:24] but you know what it was what identified
[1:19:26] that it was his he's because they were
[1:19:29] waiting on the promise hey man there was
[1:19:34] some who were looking right in the face
[1:19:36] of the word and said God can't lie they
[1:19:41] were waiting on the promise even to wear
[1:19:43] the same holy goes that spoke back down
[1:19:46] through time it moved upon Simeon it
[1:19:49] said you're not gonna adapt till you see
[1:19:51] the Lord's Christ and the same one that
[1:19:53] told him that is the same one that
[1:19:55] promised that Simeon Hill I wonder how
[1:19:57] family sometimes he got sick doctor said
[1:20:00] Simeon you don't have many more days you
[1:20:02] don't have many more hours but he said I
[1:20:04] can't go because he already told me I'm
[1:20:07] not gonna die till I see the Lord's
[1:20:09] Christ you know what it was it was that
[1:20:12] which was revealed to him glory be to
[1:20:14] God that gave him power and mastered
[1:20:18] these circumstances that would come his
[1:20:20] life think about how many said you're
[1:20:22] crazy look at this time this guy hears
[1:20:25] things from God oh my goodness what a
[1:20:27] juvenile thing what a funny-looking
[1:20:29] little guy look at him he must be off
[1:20:32] his rocker no he was actually moved by
[1:20:35] the Spirit of God so much to where he
[1:20:38] was sitting in his office the Holy
[1:20:40] Spirit can move down and say Samia get
[1:20:42] up from the chair you see he was in tune
[1:20:45] with God so much till God could speak
[1:20:49] plainly get up from your chair move on
[1:20:54] out here come on down here tell me what
[1:21:00] quotes he had to tell him to push back
[1:21:02] his chair Donegan quiet on me are you
[1:21:06] tell me what quotes he had to tell him
[1:21:09] how to go down the aisle you see what it
[1:21:13] was he had to know more than quotes he
[1:21:15] has to know the God who had inspired
[1:21:17] those prophets and when it came time for
[1:21:20] that word to be fulfilled he was a part
[1:21:23] of the house
[1:21:24] hold of Abraham and God would see to it
[1:21:27] that what he spoke to him he would
[1:21:29] confirm it
[1:21:30] [Music]
[1:21:32] the understand what I'm saying remember
[1:21:34] the Pharisees they knew that of all the
[1:21:38] history of Moses they could quote the
[1:21:40] quotes and everything else but they did
[1:21:42] not know that God who gave the message
[1:21:45] they did know the holy ghost who spoken
[1:21:49] by a divine unction they were absent of
[1:21:51] discernment what a dangerous hour in a
[1:21:58] dangerous time Abraham's household is
[1:22:03] comprised of the real Jews that remnant
[1:22:08] that was awaiting the Messiah
[1:22:11] and they recognized him his household
[1:22:15] he is also comprised of the elect among
[1:22:18] the Gentiles here with me think of this
[1:22:23] with Joseph now Joseph is off the scene
[1:22:26] and when he's away he is given a wife
[1:22:31] and his life is in his household but
[1:22:37] when his brethren come they were his
[1:22:41] brethren but not his wife but they were
[1:22:44] out that household and brother Graham
[1:22:47] said what Joseph was saying there is
[1:22:50] what he'll be saying at that time when
[1:22:52] he reveals himself to the brethren I
[1:22:54] have taken a Gentile bride you come home
[1:22:57] with me we're all gonna be one big
[1:22:59] family Wow because the name will also be
[1:23:04] revealed to them their glory be to God
[1:23:09] you see this is that same house of God
[1:23:13] that even that that Jacob my my my time
[1:23:16] just it don't stand still for nobody
[1:23:18] don't in this house of God remember
[1:23:21] we're here was was Jacob standing in
[1:23:23] Bethel remember when God made himself
[1:23:25] known to Jacob in Bethel and how that
[1:23:27] the angels of God the presence of God
[1:23:29] come down and Jacob would say in Genesis
[1:23:32] 28 this is none other than the house of
[1:23:34] God the gate to heaven we realized that
[1:23:37] it wasn't the natural place but it was
[1:23:39] God Himself expressing that he himself
[1:23:42] would provide for himself a house there
[1:23:47] right because God don't dwell outside of
[1:23:49] the house God dwells in a body and I
[1:23:52] write and what God revealed there to
[1:23:55] Jacob he made known his presence there
[1:23:58] at Bethel so much that Jacob then could
[1:24:00] take a rock and he would set the rock up
[1:24:03] in tight and said that when I return
[1:24:05] he said if God will bring me back to
[1:24:07] this place in safety here he said this
[1:24:10] stone which I set for a pillar shall be
[1:24:13] God's house
[1:24:16] when Israel comes and comes back into
[1:24:20] the true atonement they'll recognize the
[1:24:24] house of God because this house of God
[1:24:28] how fitting here it is in Bethel which
[1:24:31] would be man in Bethlehem as I write and
[1:24:34] to think of how that this house that it
[1:24:37] would be said an attack it would be that
[1:24:39] of a rock but to recognize that within
[1:24:41] this that the stone which would be the
[1:24:44] foundation and the dwelling place of the
[1:24:46] Lord which we would understand as the
[1:24:48] Lord Jesus Christ he is the foundation
[1:24:51] stone he is the building which the Lord
[1:24:56] built and through him and his spirit we
[1:25:01] have access and are brought into God's
[1:25:03] house or the house of God the Lord Jesus
[1:25:05] Christ because every true Christian is
[1:25:09] born in Bethlehem it's all right it's a
[1:25:15] house of God's bread what is bread bread
[1:25:17] is the staff of life they have man in
[1:25:20] the winner's but jesus said I am that
[1:25:22] true bread that coming down from heaven
[1:25:25] what's his speaking of that life that is
[1:25:27] given that you might have life he is
[1:25:30] that bread of life amen
[1:25:35] glory be to God think of how that even
[1:25:38] when Solomon you know he would he would
[1:25:40] make the statement Solomon was moved as
[1:25:44] David was moved think of this God never
[1:25:46] even asked David to build him a house
[1:25:49] first Chronicles 17 you think of that
[1:25:52] God never asked David to build him a
[1:25:53] house
[1:25:55] when did that inspiration come from
[1:25:57] David was in tune with God he was
[1:26:01] walking with God and that inspiration
[1:26:03] would strike his heart there needs to be
[1:26:06] a house for him to dwell there you see
[1:26:09] it was God's desire because it would be
[1:26:11] calm provide a house for himself a man
[1:26:15] it wouldn't be David that would do it
[1:26:17] yet David would lay up all the store the
[1:26:19] silver the gold and all those things but
[1:26:21] it would be Solomon that man of rest
[1:26:23] that would come about and he would
[1:26:25] actually build a house for God to come
[1:26:28] and dwell in there right three room
[1:26:32] house now think of him even how that it
[1:26:34] would be spoken there by Solomon Stephen
[1:26:37] would pick it up over here in the book
[1:26:39] of Acts that howbeit the Most High
[1:26:43] dwelleth not in a house made by hands
[1:26:46] that was only a tack pointing to that
[1:26:49] perfect house of God it was only showing
[1:26:54] and shadowing that what the desire was
[1:26:57] worth in David it would be Solomon to
[1:26:59] bring it forth it showed the longing
[1:27:02] desire that was there in God it would be
[1:27:05] through Jesus Christ that he would bring
[1:27:07] forth that house into manifestation that
[1:27:14] house no wonder David could say except
[1:27:20] the Lord build the house David labor
[1:27:23] labor in vain the right mama
[1:27:28] I'm just trying to I'm just trying to
[1:27:30] move on here
[1:27:32] this house this body remember here comes
[1:27:39] the Tabernacle walking there into the
[1:27:40] river Jordan comes down at the at the at
[1:27:46] the right time and as he comes down
[1:27:48] there in the river Jordan the heavens
[1:27:50] are open he's baptized up out of the
[1:27:52] water the heavens are open and here
[1:27:54] comes the dove coming down God was
[1:27:58] identifying that now through this
[1:28:00] obedient son the son of God the Lamb of
[1:28:05] God that same spirit would now come upon
[1:28:11] the sons of God and the dollars of God
[1:28:15] the same Holy Spirit that sought glory
[1:28:18] be to God that sought him out and told
[1:28:21] him go down to the river today's the day
[1:28:25] come on somebody in the Easter seal 1965
[1:28:28] Milgram said the Spirit of God sought
[1:28:30] him out in perfect obedience and he came
[1:28:34] down there and he was washed there
[1:28:36] within the water is that right he came
[1:28:40] there and then what happened the Spirit
[1:28:42] of God come upon him and he said this is
[1:28:45] my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased
[1:28:48] to dwell
[1:28:48] what is the outpouring of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:51] it's identifying the sons and daughters
[1:28:54] of God it identifies those that are of
[1:28:57] the household of Abraham it identifies
[1:29:00] those that were chosen in God before the
[1:29:03] foundation of the world and the Holy
[1:29:05] Ghost is the outpouring of his name and
[1:29:08] remember it is now his name being
[1:29:12] reflected in the family of God that
[1:29:15] which is in heaven and that which is in
[1:29:17] earth his life on display is that right
[1:29:23] only one place is one place for safety
[1:29:26] that's in Christ Jesus amen this is why
[1:29:30] the question that would be proposed how
[1:29:32] do we get into that church how do we get
[1:29:35] into that body how do we get into that
[1:29:37] house
[1:29:38] well you know he wouldn't be very
[1:29:40] thoughtful if you didn't have a house
[1:29:42] that had a door on it windows are nice
[1:29:46] but windows aren't made for you to come
[1:29:48] in through there is a prescribed
[1:29:52] entranceway or glory a Manor door itself
[1:29:56] it shows you don't have to look around
[1:29:58] the house when you go to look at around
[1:29:59] not one of you walk up to somebody's
[1:30:01] house and go to their window if you
[1:30:03] start going up through a window to come
[1:30:04] in their house you're gonna find
[1:30:05] yourself in the back of a police car
[1:30:07] because you know why they're gonna
[1:30:09] regard you by the way that you're
[1:30:10] approaching it and going in you're
[1:30:12] either a thief or a robber come on
[1:30:15] somebody but there is a door that is
[1:30:17] provided and there's no way that you and
[1:30:20] I could get into the sheepfold although
[1:30:22] we were ordained as the sheep of God but
[1:30:25] he the great Shepherd came down and
[1:30:28] became the door for you and I a man that
[1:30:31] you had asked to come into this
[1:30:33] sheepfold into this household this is a
[1:30:36] house that we were made for this is a
[1:30:41] house that we were made for we were made
[1:30:44] to live in this house we were made to
[1:30:46] live in this presence
[1:30:47] no wonder David could say in the Book of
[1:30:50] Psalms blessed is that man that is
[1:30:52] planted in the courts of the Lord he
[1:30:54] shall flourish glory be to God by one
[1:31:01] spirit by one spirit are we baptized
[1:31:05] into one body one body that mystical
[1:31:10] body of the Lord Jesus Christ let me
[1:31:14] just say it like this I don't have time
[1:31:15] to quote it but the Prophet tells us
[1:31:17] like this I believe it's in five
[1:31:19] identifications of the church he said
[1:31:21] that when you have responded to that
[1:31:23] call of the Holy Ghost into the mystical
[1:31:25] body of Jesus Christ and you have been
[1:31:28] baptized by the Holy Ghost into the body
[1:31:30] of Jesus Christ you are a full member
[1:31:34] right then you understand that you're a
[1:31:39] full member we're still growing but you
[1:31:43] have full access
[1:31:46] hey men you have a right and an access
[1:31:49] to every redemptive blessings o my house
[1:31:53] like the Prophet said if I was somewhere
[1:31:55] he said and there might be on this shelf
[1:31:57] it's too high for me to see what's up
[1:31:59] there I'm gonna get a ladder and climb
[1:32:02] up there now remember the way up is down
[1:32:05] and down is up so how do I get up there
[1:32:09] pray prayer takes you to places because
[1:32:14] remember prayer brings you and I into
[1:32:17] that desire through a submission Lord
[1:32:19] let thy will be done in earth even as it
[1:32:22] is in heaven
[1:32:23] a man is two working of that citizenship
[1:32:27] in our life for by one spirit are we
[1:32:29] baptized into one body this house that
[1:32:33] were ordained for go repeated God like
[1:32:38] the prodigal son he was down there in
[1:32:41] the Pigpen but he got to thinking about
[1:32:42] the father's house are you with me the
[1:32:47] age of the Lord began to work on his
[1:32:49] heart he began to think about his
[1:32:51] father's house he knew where he was at
[1:32:54] he knew the house that he was in that
[1:32:56] was not his father's house he knew in my
[1:32:59] father's house the servants are treated
[1:33:02] better than this he got a longing to
[1:33:05] come back home

[1:33:12] come home and what was it the same
[1:33:14] longing that stirred up it is hard to

[1:33:19] return and his father when he saw him

[1:33:27] running for you and I he came after you

[1:33:32] get back so he came and said I am your
[1:33:35] way back I will take your blame
[1:33:37] I will take your reproach and I will
[1:33:40] bring you back home

[1:34:49] household of God but the life we live
[1:34:53] did not reflect that household that we
[1:34:55] were really off we reflected that of our

[1:38:33] the joy of his salvation you've got a
[1:38:36] lot tonight to ask for the joy of the
[1:38:38] Lord to return because the joy of the
[1:38:41] Lord it belongs in the house of God and
[1:38:45] you and I have been assembled and
[1:38:48] brought into the body of Jesus Christ
[1:38:51] and tonight I'm looking at lively stones
[1:38:55] that had been assembled together by the
[1:38:59] divine architect of Almighty God and the
[1:39:04] Holy Spirit moving upon our lives like
[1:39:06] he moved upon the bones there in the
[1:39:09] house of Israel to come together to
[1:39:11] unite for what that he himself inhabits
[1:39:15] this house of God so then his body his
[1:39:22] body his broad body
[1:39:24] this is the house of God it's the house
[1:39:28] of God this is where his children are
[1:39:31] his children that are born of his genes
[1:39:34] inside of this house is where the
[1:39:37] quickening power is you remember as I
[1:39:40] said in the book of Haggai but here when
[1:39:42] they built remember the first the first
[1:39:43] temple they built and then when they
[1:39:45] built that second temple that temple in
[1:39:47] itself the way that it looked it had as
[1:39:49] far as it looks
[1:39:50] had no glory compared to the first one
[1:39:52] but it wasn't a natural glory it would
[1:39:54] be the glory of the latter house would
[1:39:57] see would sit would would that of I
[1:39:59] don't want to say the word it would be
[1:40:01] greater than that of the first house why
[1:40:03] because was that right there have God it
[1:40:06] led by unction and to think within that
[1:40:08] house the very God Himself the Lord
[1:40:11] Jesus Christ would come to stand in that
[1:40:13] temple
[1:40:15] he would spend in that temple and say
[1:40:17] there is one that is greater than the
[1:40:21] temple I'm telling you in your life and
[1:40:24] in my life there's one greater than the
[1:40:26] temple hey man is that is the glory of
[1:40:30] the latter house it is the glory of God
[1:40:33] that is poured out on the house of God
[1:40:36] hallelujah
[1:40:38] he's been assembling he's been building
[1:40:40] the foundation has been laid and he
[1:40:43] comes down in the hour that we're living
[1:40:46] the headstone comes to cap off a
[1:40:52] finished work the mystery of God down
[1:40:57] through the ages that mystery of his
[1:41:00] riches in the lives of you and me Christ
[1:41:03] in us the hope of glory I say it like
[1:41:08] this tonight by Joshua as for me and my
[1:41:14] house we will serve the Lord
[1:41:19] as for me and my house we will serve the
[1:41:22] Lord
[1:41:24] amen that's what the Holy Spirit that's
[1:41:27] what the Lord Jesus Christ is declaring
[1:41:29] as for me and my house we're going to
[1:41:33] live by the word a man we're gonna
[1:41:38] reflect the glory of God not by our will
[1:41:42] but by his will amen let's stand tonight
[1:41:48] one body one body the church the church
[1:41:57] the house of God Peter would refer to it
[1:42:02] a spiritual house Paul unfolds it even
[1:42:08] more of that of Christ and the bride
[1:42:15] husband and wife a great mystery of the
[1:42:20] church
[1:42:26] to think
[1:42:29] what he's done in our lives here's the
[1:42:34] other promise in my father's house are
[1:42:38] many mansions
[1:42:42] the earnest of the Holy Spirit in our
[1:42:46] hearts as believers it gives us the
[1:42:51] assurance
[1:42:53] as Paul when I read in the opening
[1:42:54] scripture he gives us power authority
[1:42:59] gives us joy it gives us hope
[1:43:03] because we know that if this earthly
[1:43:07] tabernacle be dissolved we've got one
[1:43:11] waiting
[1:43:16] hallelujah
[1:43:18] in that great household of God how did
[1:43:22] we get in there by him by him
[1:43:28] by him him touching our hearts him
[1:43:31] dealing with our life it's the same way
[1:43:33] tonight if you don't know the Lord in
[1:43:34] that way it's the same Holy Spirit the
[1:43:36] same one that deals with your life that
[1:43:39] is whispered to your heart is the same
[1:43:40] morning you say brother Samuel what what
[1:43:43] does he want
[1:43:44] he just wants surrender he wants
[1:43:48] surrender that's the same thing in each
[1:43:53] of our lives that have been baptized
[1:43:57] into this body
[1:44:00] this household of God
[1:44:03] the reflection of that name reflection
[1:44:05] of that life here's a here we are living
[1:44:08] in a closing moment closing time it's a
[1:44:14] time where all this is everything's
[1:44:16] being finished up these things God
[1:44:18] making it so clear to you and I it's
[1:44:21] time but I want you to remember I think
[1:44:26] over and over tonight the Holy Spirit is
[1:44:28] made it clear
[1:44:31] in the house of God you have an access
[1:44:40] god don't want you acting like a beggar
[1:44:43] even tonight if there's a longing and
[1:44:46] he's letting you know you need to come
[1:44:47] into the house you know maybe let me
[1:44:49] bring you in remember you're not a
[1:44:50] beggar
[1:44:51] this promises to you and then even once
[1:44:54] you're in there every promise is to you
[1:44:56] you're not a beggar your sons and
[1:44:59] daughters have gone whatever the
[1:45:02] promises that's upon your heart you take
[1:45:04] that before the throne of God and let
[1:45:06] the Holy Spirit who gave the promise and
[1:45:08] laid it upon your heart you let him come
[1:45:11] and enforce that promise
[1:45:14] let's just pray your Lord Jesus
[1:45:19] lord I pray that the words Lord that has
[1:45:25] been given tonight
[1:45:27] Lord broken up but I pray that God that
[1:45:32] the unction of the Holy Spirit has taken
[1:45:34] it into every heart ward
[1:45:37] [Music]
[1:45:38] Lord Jesus may there not be one that's
[1:45:41] gathered here tonight live under under
[1:45:45] the privileges Lord God if there's one
[1:45:49] that's been robbed of the privilege of
[1:45:51] being a son and daughter of God
[1:45:53] may they take the promise tonight and
[1:45:55] say Lord that's my promise you made that
[1:45:58] promise you're the one who's given me
[1:46:00] that hunger now Lord I'm asking that you
[1:46:03] would satisfy Lord God take everything
