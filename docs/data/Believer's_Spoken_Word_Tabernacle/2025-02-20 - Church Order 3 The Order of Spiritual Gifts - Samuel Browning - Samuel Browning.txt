thank you Lord Jesus how true that is isn't it if not for the grace of God where would we be amen we want to um [Music] the different requests I know that were mentioned and uh want to say it's good to have well my father-in-law and mother-in-law they we didn't have church on Sunday so you didn't you didn't miss them but they wouldn't have been here if we'd had church and uh so they just everything kind of just suddenly hit them but U they've their many days removed but um this just there's a lot there's so many different things that are it's going on I just was in contact with brother Brian um Brian Hannah and um he's just it's really been difficult he's he's just getting over whatever it is Sister Barb seemed like she's got over it and then it's kind of went kind of seemed like it's kind of come back so and it's just you know we've had things like that kind of different you know it's just I don't even know how many different strains of the flu there are out there or whatever more when we can call every one of those Devils names but um it's just so much that is around but I I just uh certainly want to encourage you just to have prayer and I know you are but just as we can get it out when requ requests come in during the week we try to get it out and and I tell you if you know if I'm in need I I I want to get it out to the body um that to me is not being selfish I I've Got Confidence in your prayers and uh I so appre appreciate that and so we we certainly pray pray for one another and hold one another up in prayer and I know there's there like I said there's many that are dealing with it sometimes even some that won't uh they they don't come because maybe they've been exposed in the work and they're just kind of looking at things so let's just keep one another in prayer and really just you know just make it a matter of prayer the Lord will just just move for us in a special way we we really need a real touch from the Lord and um I want to also uh ask a prayer request I didn't get a chance to have this wrote down but um it's from Brother Sam rice from the Believers up there in Connecticut and um he'd asked that I remember um his uh friend in prayer Mike Gambier he has a a form of cancer and the Lord just really moved through that to um witness to that uh to that individual and he's been coming he was there uh when I was there and I got a chance to talk with him and his son uh after the service that day and kind of ran out there and tracked them down so I could talk with them and um they just asking that we would keep them in prayer as well because uh they're really looking at water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus that's up in Connecticut and so um just remember them in prayer I know they're they're tuning in here right now um also brother Homer he asked me to greet you tonight in prayer so we sure love brother Homer don't we amen amen if you ever want to retire brother Homer you can you can come up north well we sure love brother Homer and U but we want to just just take our time and come into the word of the Lord just for a little bit here this evening and um so thank you musicians amen God bless you just such a wonderful atmosphere and um so let's just go ahead and stand and um we get ready to go right on into the word so appreciate seeing each and every one of you that're able to come out and you made it out and you walk through the snow and uh hey some through the water some through the flood some through the snow but uh we so thankful for you on the it's a cold night and uh but I so appreciate you being here and being able to Fellowship around the world of the Lord and just um just trusting the Lord will just just really speak to our hearts and and help us here tonight amen let's let's go here to Romans chapter 12 and I I wanted to read verses 1 through three but I just going to cut straight to verse four and Paul says for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in Christ and everyone members one of another having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the prop proportion of Faith or Ministry let us wait on our ministry now this isn't that particular phrase there brother Bram will use that throughout and he'll use it in the question and answers on the Holy Ghost Church order 63 and he's dealing with that within each of our lives especially if there's those that would be um I want to say prone to be gifted uh in how that God has moved upon their lives and brother Braham he uses that term let us wait on our ministry we always want to be not just when it comes to gifts but we always want to be available to God let me just give you an example like this it would just be like for example if this coming weekend you know here brother George I he comes in the back office on Sunday morning he or calls me I can't talk now I pray that don't happen but you know there's there's got to be something to where and Paul would speak to us even as ministers to be in season and out of season but we I just say it in this way we always want to be ready you ever been in situations where you just don't feel ready and sometimes sometimes there's things that will come up that it just totally takes us you know we might you might be on the job or something comes up maybe they the way the morning has went or the day has went all of a sudden you get a call from your wife or somebody and you realize my I've really got to go to prayer about this well don't get defeated about because of what however the morning went just look to the Lord at that moment and say Lord forgive me if there's anything that I've I've said or done I make myself available to you Lord so don't just don't don't don't get caught up in the oh you know I wish I would have been more ready but just because sometimes things take us they take us unawares is that right but then there's other times when we know when we're coming to the house of God I want to be ready I want to be ready for what God has for me I don't know what God has but I I know I know he has something for me it might be to encourage me it may not be exactly the answer that I'm looking for I I just want to be ready I want to be available and that's where brother Bram and Paul was writing this let us wait on our ministry so for he that teacheth on teaching or he that exhorteth on exhortation let's just bow our heads in word of prayer Heavenly Father Lord we just want to say thank you for this evening thank you for my brothers and sisters Lord as the sacrifice that they Lord have made to be here father Lord this evening and Lord I know that God that you look upon that Lord and you see that and I pray that you would so bless each and everyone Lord from the youngest to the oldest Lord may you speak to our hearts and help us to understand Lord according to the ability that God that you have given us to understand and I ask that Lord that you would just help me Lord give me the grace that I could just get out of the way that you could speak to our hearts and just speak and minister to our lives according to what we have need of Lord I pray for each and every one Lord those different requests Lord from Lord for that of what Brother Sam rice Lord had given Lord and that Lord Jesus for each and every one through the assembly Lord there's spoken there's unspoken Lord there's those that's on the text thread Lord God I pray father Lord as your children Lord just dealing with sicknesses Lord I'm asking you Lord that you would move Lord for each one of these needes in a special way father Lord as we unite our faith together Lord to rebuke Satan in the name of Jesus Christ father May the healing virtue Lord move Lord to every life Lord to every home to every heart right now Lord give strength I pray and deliverance to your children Lord we ask it father For Your Glory in Jesus precious name amen amen God bless you as you're being seated I want to I want to just pick up something here before I move forward in the subject here this evening and I want to I've I've kind of modified and had to add a few things to this on the flow of the service and I want you to as we've been dealing with some of these things on Church order these are just some things that as we said we just just as the Lord would lead us and just to minister upon these things these are things some of these things I know there are things that we know but I'll tell you even as I go back through things as God would lead us there's things that I just begin to see more clearly and uh things that I believe that as God just inspires to our hearts to help us as an assembly there's some things even tonight that I'll Minister on tonight that that really and I there's no way I'm going to get finished with it but I want to be able to lay certain things out and be able to start into it on what would even be a a Target and a direction for our lives and we talked about last week with on our approach and how that we when we come together and you know I I don't want you to be on pins and needles when you come together um you know I've been in situations like that too where you don't even know where to move or whatever more you have a some of you some of you communicated things to me where you've actually been in places in churches where you've got it's almost like uh the gastle is walking up and down the aisles you know and it's it's it's you know but that but I want to just say it like this every church is Sovereign but sovereignty I want to just I I don't want to deal with this so much tonight but sovereignty does not exempt us from the doctrine of the word sovereignty is sister Carmen God bless you good to see you sovereignty is like when brother bam talked about they did the penny March you dropped in like 25 pennies if you're 25 years old that's sovereignty that's not a doctrinal issue so it's not something of well that's a right or that's a wrong there's certain things there's certain things within sovereignty within the guidelines but one thing that is not really in question or that could be said well we're not going to believe this part of the message we're going to believe that part of the message that that's not sovereignty that's that's just called not going with the word but there are sometimes little peculiarities of certain things that might be a little different just like when we go visit another assembly you go to another assembly and but just go therefore with that purpose that Lord I've come here to receive from you it might do things a little bit different it's just like when when people come here and I certainly appreciate the respect or whatever more because if anyone did pull me toide I would just have to say you have to mind your own business this is this is an assembly and this is sovereignly this is what God has given us here and so even in in speaking this and I don't say that to be crude I'm just saying that you know cuz I understand sometimes I know that there you know can get up sometimes a person and they feel like they need to go and correct everybody and and they have it the best way but you know God knows even when you look at when I've been to places around the world they' been you know into Africa been the Philippines there things can be run and moved a little differently within there and even when you go into services but you'll find one thing that the spirit of God is the same sometimes the way things will will be done but you know what that you just you just get right in it you get right in the groove and I remember I was sitting in the Philippines the one time and brother roel leaned over to me and I was I was due to come and speak you know and and he leaned over to me and he said he said I'm sorry he said all the the specials that are going I said that's all right we'll just roll with it we're we're here let's just roll with it you know because I'm not going to get upset I don't want to I don't want to become a constricted Channel let's just roll with it we'll just see what God will do and I think that's the same thing that within our lives sometimes when we come to the house of God Satan is always in in in a way to want to try to distract us he knows what's coming he knows the word he knows what'll be ministered and he knows that even though it is something that uh that can be said that would be a great benefit to our lives and a help to us he knows just how to distract us you know he knows how to all of a sudden just drop a little thought in or maybe a certain song or maybe a piece of equipment or a sound or or something and just remember that he's always busy to try to get in and try to distract and this is why that when we're looking at reverence and I I want to if God would help me not tonight but another time looking at that on a broader Spectrum with reverence and respect and how that we look at things even deeper in the house of God with with things but to understand that there are there are things that when we like brother BR says when we come in out there I I don't know how many times and I want to just say this here when I'm back there many times in my office sometimes I'll have my my earbuds in and listening to music other times I'm not I'm just so focused and all of a sudden I hope that's okay brother Carlos all of a sudden I'll hear Brother Carlos's voice you know he's got like a booming voice you know he's he's about like this tall but he's got a booming voice like it's it's it's big and I'll hear that I'll hear them kind of chuckle a little bit and I hear Brother Bill and you know what it so warms my heart when I when I hear them out here and I hear the people some sometimes sister Stephanie's gathering in and they're out there just sitting right out there fellowshipping and I'm one I want my best to come out and greet him but I know that I I need to just there's a lot of things in front of me but what I'm saying is out there where brother BR says in here in the sanctuary this is where it's we we want to be reverent and only talking when absolutely necessary and as I said there are certain things that are absolutely necessary for the sound guys and Tech Guys and other things like that there's certain things that are necessary but like brother B says if there's something you have to say you can tap someone and we can greet One another out there in the foyer and I don't want it to be to where I mean obviously we're not it's not like we're having a fellowship dinner out there but also when we're in the foyer it's something that I I I don't want you to be where it's coldness it's never been that we we should greet one another because I've been places where you don't get greeted and then I've been at places where soon as you come to the door there's somebody right there and they're moving you all the way they're moving you through but there's a it's just greeting one another we I I think one way there's one thing of we look back even what Co did covid was one of those things that worked to destroy Fellowship things that we had worked so diligently on to bring people together but it it so worked against that and I think if there's one thing at all I don't have a problem with someone saying God bless you it's good to see you it's wonderful to see you and just you know and and but I think we understand and I hope those things were clear if it wasn't you can you can ask me but I think those are things are very are very clear we don't want people walking in here like robots and other things like that that's that's not how I want the the order of things to be I want it to be because listen as even it's been right now there is there's different ones that have come here sometimes they visit a couple times throughout the year and and I've heard others that come as strangers I never asked them this but they would tell me other pastors that would come and visit what a wonderful atmosphere and a freedom of worship there is and it would make the statement I just just had it made here just a there's just some some months ago what a what an atmosphere of of divine love I never asked him that and I I realized that that's not something that this building did that's something that moves from our hearts and that's what we always want to be I mean we always want that to be an emanating from our hearts we want it to be because first of all where does that come from it comes from God's love deposited in our life and we love him and then as we love him in that expression then there's a love for one another we love to see one another so in this flow of the service I also wanted to mention that you know there's times that if you you know even in needing uh to see me or anything like that just if you let the deacons know or you can text me or call me and say brother Samy do you mind after the service or something like that I I'm always available I'm available if there's something that I can't do or I see we need more time I'll always let you know on that but I just wanted to to set that forth I'm here we're always available and I want to touch this just a little bit before I dive into the subject here tonight on the flow of service and I've kind of broke this up more into like four parts here because that's really what it is and and that with the pre-service the one thing that I want to start here uh tonight and really kind of work with to bring to bring understanding in this because we've heard these things sometimes I've mentioned it a few times and we've talked about it but I want to deal with this part right here where gifted individuals meet and just to say it in this way we're not there yet but to understand how the prophet is placing it in the things that he's saying because sometimes it's been said well when they get completely mature but I I can see quotes that where the Prophet and go through these things and I'm not get through it all tonight but to show where all of this is at and to where that things can can actually be able to get to because with this here I I've also included this here cuz the financial report and that not something that is very spiritual but I'll say this if we don't get the bills paid we won't have no place together and so these are things that even injecting that there I we used to have I used to have it where they would put it in you know maybe before I came out or whatever more but you know brother Shane he had mentioned it kind of it brought it to my attention and after the first service and I appreciated that and I said yeah that's something I've been thinking about to try to get it down here as soon as we can and that's prior to the start of service if you have a even a testimony that's to be given that's when Sunday school would start but the financial report this Sunday uh the brothers are going to to give that very very quick just a few minutes that's all it is and it'll be before the service starts but we have to work that in and that's something only quarterly that we'll do I don't want and it's also things that I really don't want that out and over the Internet waves I don't want that out that's that's just inside housekeeping and there's no other place to really to fit that in so I trust that that is okay and then you know we I want to work here just a little bit and you're going to see this you're going to see what I have down here with messages and what I'm dealing with down here on this because I'm working to bring these two things here together where brother Bram says gifted individuals are to meet and you'll see how brother bradam is dealing with this as I get into this tonight but then also before everything could get it to where brother Brown him he had it like that before but before he could get it back to the back to this place where they met an hour 45 minutes beforehand we have it right here and after the ministering of the word where if it was tongues or interpretations or anything of that nature was to be given is that clear I just want to take my time and kind of drag my feet a little bit and just lay these things in so I want to just deal with tonight the order of spiritual gifts at least to start on this and and this is is a it's a great subject and I want to pull from where we are reading in the book of uh Romans and then let me just start in here on first 1 Corinthians 12 and Paul said there are diversities of gifts but the Same Spirit there are differences of administration but the same lord and there are diversities of operations but it's the same God which worketh all in all but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all to in other words it what God has dispensed or given it's to profit or to edify the body it's all about the body now he says for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit to another Faith by The Same Spirit to another the gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to another the working of Miracles to another prophecy to another Discerning of spirits and to another diverse kinds of tongues and to another the interpretation of tongues but all these worketh that one and the self-same spirit dividing to every man severally as he will Paul goes on to say for as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that body being many are one body so also is Christ for by one Spirit are are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit for the body is not one member but many now you're familiar with this as script as Bible readers where Paul he he lays these things in with with the Corinthian Church where where he's letting them know that every member of the body it has its place and I I you know there are many things within the body we you know we Paul describe things in there that we see being used hands ears nose eyes but there's a lot of parts of the body uh there's many systems within the body and those systems work together if you didn't have systems that were in such as you know that of the circulatory system and resp system and brother Joshua you could help me out here all of those different systems are working together yet some of them are unseen yet they're unseen to the eye but you're seeing the effect of it right now you know that my heart is working because you can see the evidence it's kind of like you you've never seen the wind but you see the effects of the wind right you see the the leaves blow and that's the same thing that even throughout the body there are many different parts and you know it's one of those things that like remember when brother bradam uh those that were young men brother Bram would talk about they you know they were so enthused they were they were zous and and they said brother Ram should we go should we go seek for gifts brother Ram said no no no no no no he said you only become a stuff sh he said just he said just give yourself to the Lord just just continue to yield to the Lord take that Zeal and channel it in that way of a surrender so every one of us has a part there's things that's not even mentioned in here as far as singing and and so many parts within the body uh where God has given each of us a Ministry I could just take a time on this and and preach on this on just on how God has so sat within the whole body yet each one has an individual Ministry and God doesn't want us chasing after this or chasing after that remember the prophet takes the time during the adoption series and said that's the problem he said Ephraim is wanting to raise corn in manasseh's corner but God has has called us individually yet it's part of a body to work together for one purpose and that's the edification of the body of Jesus Christ and so when we look at all of these parts coming together I I think of these two words what an entrustment when I read those scriptures and what a responsibility because every every one of us that have been baptized into the body of Jesus Christ with his Spirit we have that order by God let us wait on our ministry we have we've been entrusted those gifts are right here in the body because you understand when we when we have been baptized into the body of Jesus Christ those gifts are already there in the body body Now watch how brother Brandon would would bring this around and and he and he says it in this way in the angel and his commission he says in the body of Christ through all these nine spiritual gifts any group of people any Gathering of Holiness people that believe in Christ has the right to have the nine spiritual gifts it circles through the body it's in the body it's not a Praying individual it'll be on this one here night and that one the next night and maybe over here another time so notice it's in the body it's circling through the body and yet you'll find brother Brandon mentioned things like just reading here in Gabriel's uh the the 70 weeks of Daniel and brother Bram he'll say things such as like with brother higin botam he usually has the gift of tongues and brother B will speak to that in that well you know it usually or or because because why these are in individuals where that maybe it's been it's been that of tongues or prophecy has seeming to be prominently moving through them but the prophet said it's here in the body it's circling through the body so that that is different than five ministerial gifts the five ministri of gifts those are gifts that you are born with that gift in you you're born with that whether it's a a pastor a you know teacher evangelist Prophet you're born with that gift within you it is not something that that comes in you even those that are a songwriter those who sing specials gifts and callings are without repentance meaning the gift was in you before you ever repented this is why that the many of the songwriters that have yielded their talents to writing songs that have led young people and led others astray they'll have to answer for that never forget when I sat there in a music class that I was in uh for going through Elementary teaching and and this my my teacher was there I guess he liked the Beatles or something because he was overhead after overhead displaying all these songs that he wrote and only I could think of is is when he's talking about all these songs that they wrote and especially that of the one I don't want to call his name oh I can think of his oh God thousands of songs that's nothing to brag on that's sentences because of while they've yielded a talent that God gave them but yielded it in the wrong direction yeah oh God be merciful notice brother Bron says the this person can pray the prayer of faith tonight and maybe it's on this one over here the next night it's a gift that's in the body working around to you all Milling through the body body nine spiritual gifts this one might prophesy tonight and he says this is where we get in trouble you'll find brother ROM we'll continue to bring this point up over and over this is where we get in trouble one might prophesy and tell the truth that doesn't make you a prophet it might never come to you again it may never it may never move through that person again but you see brother brandom is bringing the difference prophecy does not make something one a prophet prophets are born are born of God the gift was within them but prophecy and then this can become the danger that when something has been spoken through a life and let's say that it is indeed has been judged and proven to be true it does not mean that from henceforth everything that comes out of their mouth is thus sayith the Lord every time it's got to be checked when it's prophecy that's where it gets in trouble that's what the prophet would say and he's bringing let me just let me continue to lay this in here in the message expectation the prophet says these gifts and callings are without repentance there is Spirits that's in the church that's true such as gifts of Prophecy healing and so forth so it's a spirit of God but he's Diversified so it can move through within that of Prophecy or tongues or or healing but they're in the entire body they may fall upon one person tonight A Prophecy it may not never fall on that person again it might be somewhere else in the body and those Spirits are supposed to be judged let one speak and two or three judge said Paul brother BR says now those are the spirits of the gifts that's in the church but the only person that has a right to say thus sayith the Lord is a Vindicated Prophet you never seen anybody judging Isaiah Jeremiah or those people they were prophets for ordained and born in the world to be prophets and they foresaw The Thing by a vision and then said thus sayith the Lord for the Lord had already said it now why when brother Bram would go into this he's going into this for a certain reason first of all he is the Church age messenger and furthermore has being the church age messenger God himself had promised to restore us back to the faith of the fathers because restoration of the gifts never produced a bride it was a part A further part of here the supernal being declared among the people now remember brother Ram tells us that even Martin lther Luther he spoke in tongues but he said I won't teach it in my church because he said if I do there'll be people chasing after that instead of after The Giver himself remember even brother Ram talks about even how when Dwight Moody he was preaching and he broke into speaking in tongues he was in such an inspiration and he he asked God Lord please forgive me for for for speaking that and and you know these are men it wasn't their season or their hour but I'll say the things that they said are still applicable to this day because you see friends this is where that even within when we look at these spiritual gifts it's very very very crucial because the prophet will say it in multiple places questions and answers on the Holy Ghost is one place he said you he said everywhere the children of God congregate the devil congregates as well Spirits are because remember when God in job called the sons of God together Satan walked right up in that Gathering so we're not ignorant of that and it's not to scare us but if we're just reverent to God and looking to the Lord and realizing whenever he wants if he however God wants to use me I don't need to do anything not one thing to make myself more pleasing to him his blood has already did all that was necessary huah but if he should see fit if there's something or some way that he can use me Lord I want to be available I don't want to have to say Lord sorry you can't use me today you'll have to get somebody else I want to be available it's kind of like your favorite coffee cup and somebody has got in your house and used it and drink their favorite Coke beverage out of it and here you go to get your mug that is a it's just it's just that's what makes the coffee taste good and you go and look in the sink and somebody has used it and it's not available this is why within our lives we always want to be available and not just in the house of God but how do you know a life that we might not come across out here tomorrow Lord I always want to be available I want to be available to you this is where the Prophet when he speaking of it he goes on to say intested faith produces goods CU he keeps on bringing this whole thing up and he says he calls some of us to preach some of us to teach some of us with different spirits of operation there's nine nine spiritual gifts in the local body there's a gift of Prophecy that could be on any person in here tonight and may be never on them again that just comes and goes I'll tell you what that understand in does for me is it can get the devil off of your back because when you get to look and say well I maybe I haven't been used like this in a way in a while maybe God has only used you in a certain way for a certain time right I mean even with John the Baptist for he went went for how many years and he was only used for six months the Lord Jesus and his ministry 30 years but he was only used three and 1/2 years yeah is that right it's kind of like this forgive me I know I'm very very simple I could have put a picture up there but I thought no I'm just going to do this and bring out my little little little bag of things that I have in my office back here I want you to notice every one of these things I've got in here I've got a carpenter's knife sometimes I need that for things I have to open I don't use this for counseling only when it has blades and I'm just eing I got scissors I got a stapler I have the Post-it notes which Lord knows I need those all the time almost remember to read your Post-It note you have to make a post- notee for you posted notes I got a pen these are all instruments it's like gifts they're right there in my office if if I take a notion and something comes up and I I I need to trim something out or I have to cut something I know where to go I've got the scissors they're already in a position they're not just you know laying around these aren't just in a bag like I have them here like when I go to brother Shane's house I don't take the bag and say Hey Brother Shane let me show you what I've got in here let me show you all these gifts I don't do that the gifts have come they're in position in my office you see that you see what I'm saying putting them in that way and so when I have need of my pen it's there I don't need my pen all the time I don't go into a day when I come here on on on the six days out of the week I do not come in here and say today I got to use my pen if I don't use my pen it's not been a successful day in the office I don't know that day might be mainly just on the computer which that's generally of all the hours it's here within that and you know I've got other markers in there that I use and you know what this thing I I think I use this today for one thing but that's the first time today this stapler has been used in a long time you with me but it's things that it just so in other words I I don't I you know the stapler or I'm not saying oh I I didn't have a day in the office because I wasn't able to use the stapler today it's there and when I need to use it it's for a purpose I don't just walk through the office just clicking away and Staples going everywhere all over the floor see I I did that once when I was a kid but I'm no longer a child I know when to use it uh you know I'm not I'm not enamored with it like oh I've got a stapler yeah first I mean you know especially some of the nicer staplers and things you can have and you know then when you become a teacher and you get one like this and it opens you're like oh man wow that's a neat man there's more I can use it to make bulletin boards which I never was good at I can do all of that right there but you know after a while I I I don't come in and study this no more it's there when I need it I use it and that's the same way that God through these gifts God uses it as he needs it it might be once twice a year in some of these that I'm going to speak about tonight so it isn't something that it it has to be it's as needed so this is where it comes down the our rest is in the Lord Jesus Christ if I never had another good day I'm saved brother R said if I never preached again I'm going to heaven so I'm I'm not resting on a gift I'm not resting on a feeling I'm resting on I have met the that that's that saving redeeming work and it's here in my heart I love him he's the love of my life his word is what I desire to [Applause] follow is that all right it just comes and goes it's as he sees fit it's not us determining it oh if it doesn't go this way it's it's not been a good service no when he comes and he comes through so many different ways this is why brother BR you know when he talked about teaching sometimes I know man I'm kind of getting off here a little bit I need to stay a little more focused but sometimes you know teaching has taken such a bad rap sometimes and the reality of it is the prophet tells us he takes us in the scripture and he says many don't understand what the anointing is he said the anointing is not running all over the building which I'm not against running but he said anointing is knowing how and when to act and he said the Lord Jesus he said here he did he stood up read a scripture and sat down and wonderful words proceeded from his mouth I'm wondering how many of our meetings if someone sat down on the platform and preached you see sometimes where God brings us to because sometimes we want to be careful we're not getting caught up in somebody else's Spirit we're getting in the spirit because somebody else's spirit will never heal me it'll never touch me it'll never deliver me but if I can get in his Spirit enter into the spirit of the word you understand what I'm saying because when the word is meant to have an effect upon our lives right we can leave out and say it's a good service but the real results of it being a good service is that the word it has become good it has changed our lives it's working it's outworking in our lives that's the purpose when we come to the house of God and that the word might have an outlet to work through we want to be available I want to be available available to God can we say that available available I that's what I want to be I want to be available brother brah is talking about these gifts and he says it you know in the one place in questions and answers on the Holy Ghost he says it like this he says you know he said sometimes see brother Bram was seing so many things of how that when the gifts were being done and he's seeing it throughout all in not just in the Tabernacle but he's seeing it throughout all other churches you said brother Samuel I thought that you said sovereignty was for the local church for for every pastor but I'm talking about a prophet as a pastor I don't go correct another Pastor that's their Church that'd be like me coming into your home and correcting your children that's wrong right it'd be like me coming coming to you as a husband and stripping you down in front of your wife that's wrong you're the leader of that home I don't ever want that image to be tarnished are you with me there's a way we work but we're dealing with a prophet a prophet is sent to bring and place the church in order and we're not talking about in this ministry and Ephesians 4 Prophet we're talking about a prophet like that of Moses we're talking about an end time Prophet that God declared I will send unto you Elijah the prophet and Elijah came on the mountain by the word he had a vision of the word and that's what a Prophet has a prophet the prophet says goes beyond the emotion of the people he goes beyond the music he climbs up into the Realms of God and he hears what has already been said and Echoes it to the Church of the Living God that's the gift of a prophet he's a Seer he's an eagle and he brings it down into the church and now what is in Heavenly becomes displayed through the Earthly in an orderly way this is why even on the mountain Elijah never brought his own stones but what was there it was assembled back together God led him what to do so this is why when the prophet would say it in this way he says in questions and answers on the Holy Ghost and I don't I I didn't I just want to reference to this this this particular statement on being available brother Bram says when that comes into the congregation and he says that tongues he said you be reverent and he said because you might be the one that gives the interpretation you be reverent because it's because I don't want to I can't dive into those parts tonight it's so hard not to get into all these other parts as you but all of those things it's not things of what we're even thinking even when it's spoken in tongues it's not our thoughts about things even the interpretation interpretation is not what is not our Impressions interpretation is where we hear it in our native language and speak it out that's interpretation it's not feeling of what I feel like the church I feel like no no it's clarity now look how brother brandham brings this here bringing all these things together as Paul would say concerning spiritual gift Brethren I would not have you ignorant I'm thankful for that aren't you you know it's evident when Paul would be dealing with the Corinthian Church and bringing this correction and guidance now he admonished him the very the chapter one when he opened up he said the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you you are you have not come behind in any gift yeah all utterance they they had the gifts among them now I want just I want to just ask you this question here I know brother Brad will say this over and over he says how that you know Paul never had to speak to the Ephesian church about the gifts and he never had to speak to this church but I look at it this way if this hadn't been an issue what what what what leadership would we have had you see God takes things that that can become that that we look at oh this shouldn't be and this this issue no no God takes it and solves it out right he solves things out for you and I he brings that because in reality every Church Ephesus included had its weaknesses and its strengths galatia thessalonica it's it's right there I I don't have time for that but each one had their strengths and weaknesses just like you and I as individuals have our own strengths and weaknesses just like a husband and a wife we all have our strengths and weaknesses in other words we're all flowed human beings in need of God's divine grace and God takes things that sometimes you and I say oh it shouldn't be this way and we revisit it and we and God comes in and he speak to our hearts so personally in our lives listen You'll Find as I go through some of these years in here you'll find where the Prophet is going through and having to revisit these things again and again and you'll find that it's not just at the time Tabernacle but he's speaking in many different locations because he's the prophet to the age if you can understand this there's places that when I when I would go in to minister as a as a guest Minister I don't go in as a pastor yet that's the gift in my life that a lot of that will will come forth even in the approach to the word but I'm not there to Pastor those people there's certain places I won't even Venture I won't even go into because I'm not their Pastor there's certain places and things that we stand that to me is the reverence for the pulpit are you with me I'm I it's there as God would lead to edify to encourage the people and that's and this is where we're at so notice we want I want to be thankful for the correction that God had given and notice Paul says this follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts but rather that you may prophesy so he's telling them what to put first go after charity and then desire spiritual gifts but rather that you may prophesy even so for as much as you are zealous of spiritual gifts seek that you may excel to the edifying of the church now I want to look at this this word of pro prophecy or to prophesy and this is what Paul is referring to this is where it is it's a discourse emanating from divine inspiration and declaring the purposes of God now tongues and the interpretation of T is prophecy okay so this is what true prophecy is its discourse emanating from divine inspiration declaring the purposes of God and here's the way it goes by reproving and admonishing the wicked comforting The Afflicted and revealing things hidden this is why God has placed this in the church now brother bradam will take this very thing right here with prophecy and who better to disclose or to discuss this than a prophet because he says the way that it does here on the platform he said you've never seen it repeat scriptures it's a direct message that's the same way that prophecy as a spiritual gift will work through the body is that all right so I thank God for that I thank God for that the prophet lyans are like this he said he said take for example he says you've got someone here and they're coming for prayer and they they Lord I I brother BR I don't know or brother Neville I don't know what's going on you know and so he says God has one has a gift in the body and if that that gift is there to go down maybe there's something in that life they've got to make right and God will use that I tell you that's not to embarrass people that's to help God's children think about that little lady who was a Sunday school teacher her husband was a deacon across town and both of them have been guilty of adultery and she had so said well I asked God to forgive me she couldn't figure out what was going on in her life she was such a nervous wreck and everything else about her life and finally when the angel of the Lord came the one day the prophets told meeting go get her and bring her to the office here at the house and when she came in the spirit of God uncovered where her problem was you know when I read that story I say God thank you for your mercy it was God freeing that little lady she wanted to be free she did what she thought and there was also a fear if I disclose this said she had pressed it down there so far but God had that of a prophet that he used in that moment to go down there and remove what was hindering her that's the same way one of the channels that prophecy as one of the nine spiritual gifts will be used brother Bram goes through that in different ones now watch in Hebrews chapter 7 brother Bram says when you go into to a meeting and you know you go in there and there's a bunch of tongues and interpretations and somebody raises up and keeps quoting the scripture that's carnal now one thing you're not going to find I want don't want to dwell on this tonight but just things that I've just you know you Ponder on you look at I've never found brother brandham un christianized one person who was out of line some weeks ago I just woke up early in the morning it just began to come back asz I was just looking at that I thought even how brother brandham when I can show I if God gives us opportunities later on to show you even times after he said certain statements he'll be out preaching somewhere else and somebody will interrupt but he'll never say anything negative about that he'll say oh he says let's be reverenced because evidently the Holy Spirit wanted to say something because he broke in on the message that was out of order right but look how the prophet handled that he never called it of the devil right I want you to watch that to me I watch the character I watch his approach I watch I watch all of these things as it comes and watch he said that's that's carnal God said for us not to use vain reputations what about him if he wrote it here once you believe it he don't have to say it again tongues and interpretations is right but it's to be a direct message to the church and to somebody not just carnal and things like that so it's not like brother says somebody asked brother BR should I be baptized he said that's wrote in the word the Lord is coming that's in the word that's I'm right on for a preacher to be saying that but not for that to be called prophecy because that's not prophecy Now watch how Paul writes this in 1 Corinthians 14:23 I'm trying to move Paul said if therefore the whole church be come together into one place and all speak with tongues and there come in those that are unlearned or unbelievers will they not say that you are mad but if all prophesy and there come in one that believeth not or one unlearned he is convinced of all he is judged of all and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest so falling down on his face he will worship God and report that God is in in you of a truth so when we look at this no one this is remember now let me just let me move a little bit this is one of the parts of Prophecy because it's also used to comfort The Afflicted but here to convince it's to tell one's fault which is what I was just talking about right here if there's something that's laying in a life God has a way of doing that and I can't read it here to you tonight but brother brandham was so thankful when he returned home and he saw that gift of Prophecy working in brother Neville's life and brother Brown says it like this God has sent me some relief some help here at home so when I'm home I can rest there had also come correction brother Neville that's a different story but the main thing is that here in the here in the word even judged to be judged see it has to be judged everything to investigate to examine to inquire in a forensic sense you know in a forensic sense it's going down and examining it so when something is just said it comes right out and says uh brother Shane do not go to your job tomorrow this and this will be you don't receive that it's got to be judged first that's scripture you saying well it called it right out by name it must be judged that that's the scripture two two out of the three must judge it see this is why for more gifts gifts is not just tongues interpretation there's got to be that of discernment among us to be able to discern it it doesn't matter how clear it is or how this it's went so so that that that's a part of it where it's got to be judged that's God's protection don't you thank God for his protection I thank God for his protection that he gives us as a body his word never comes to take anything away from us it's protection for our lives can't you see friends why it behooves us you see this is why and even for these things in this manner you can't you see why it behooves us that the love of God has to be preent in our life can you imagine what if what if the gift of discernments in your life and somebody raises and speaks in tongues and prophecy comes out but you've got something against that person can you see this listen is not even about what if there even is no if there's not even any of the nine spiritual gifts we don't want anything in our heart because the Rapture is greater than anything when we stand there on that day we're not going to be thinking about differences right that's true that's why it's important this was just a little side note but just like when the time zone I've worked with the song leaders and musicians and and others I said look every time when you come and you're here make sure your spirit is clean I've Got Confidence in your walk with God but you make sure your spirit is clean don't don't bring anything within your spirit let it be cleaned out let things be settled out let everything be settled out because why if not that can taint it can twist things that's in my life as a pastor as a minister but I don't believe it's just for me I believe it's for all of us I say God let us not live below our privileges let Lord let me go deeper in the love of God that it'll dis places those things it isn't me trying to tear them out of my life it's more of the love of God displaces it the secrets those things which are hidden in the life that are brought to light and this is why when Paul would say it in this way and Paul would write If any man speak in an unknown tongue Let It Be by two or three at the most and that by course and let one interpret so Paul is letting it be known right here that even if it's I think I said this the a couple weeks before maybe it's a fourth one or fifth one no no two or three Let It Be by course by course meaning if it's tongue and Paul's dealing dealing with tongues and interpretation here it comes here's the interpretation here's the tongues interpretation tongues interpretation and that's it that's the word isn't it but if there be no interpreter let them keep silent in the church and let him speak to himself and to God and let the prophet speak two or three and let the other judge this is the thing let the other judge and if anything be revealed to another that Seth by let the first hold his peace for ye may all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be comforted and the spirit of the prophets are subject to the prophets sorry now notice Paul would write this here and I've always when I Ponder this and look at this here Paul would say Brethren covet to prophesy in other words desire not not as though that chasing after but why because prophecy is what edifies the church it it it it either goes down and and makes known what is what's hinder ing or it can comfort and I want to just say this to you I've seen this I've witnessed it in our assembly at times spot on the money this building that we're in right now on this property some of you don't remember you weren't attending here at the time but on a Wednesday service and there was there was times of things that there there was a little bit of contention about oh I don't think we can do this I don't think we can not not among all but just things that was just kind of not not among the majority of the congregation but there were just some things and the spirit of God at the end of the service moved down there and spoke right out called my dad by name and laid everything out just has it would be that we would come into this property how many of you remember that we're there not many many people I do it was a Wednesday night you remember it it was a Wednesday night never forget it in my life it was spot right on the money it happened exactly because us standing here in this property it was a miracle you know this is why that you know businessmen go to a certain place and we come to a certain extent but when we're dealing with things of God and sometimes there's things I'm not talking about making bad decisions but I'm talking about when God gives a vision we follow the vision oh God was so I'm so glad for that aren't you notice this brother BR no he's going into this and I want to just I'm not going to read every one of these quotes here but I want to go through one quote here tonight and then I'll just try to I'm just going to pull off brother Bram keeps on laying this in remember when I I told you about in the flow of the service brother Brown keeps speaking of how that he had at one point in time the church church was in order in the terms of where the gifted people were meeting in the pre-service so it wasn't something that brother bam never had he experienced it he saw he saw the benefit of that he saw that now notice as he's he's he's speaking of this he speaks of it clear back here in 56 he's going in other earlier parts of the message and he's talking about how that they would come in for their Ministry and they would sit in the church and be quiet and maybe there'd be message that would be received and two or three with the spirit of discernment would discern it to be right or would say no it's not of God but brother Bram picks this up in a second-handed robe and I've have included this here for you Brooklyn New York this wasn't the Tabernacle but he's speaking in Brooklyn New York and I say this because for for individuals that would just say Well church order and what brother R said about the gifts was only for brandom Tabernacle many of these quotes and throughout brother bram's preaching around the United States because he's the prophet of the hour set the set it in order brother BR goes on to talk about that which I said before there's a quite quite a vast difference between a gift of Prophecy and a prophet I I've covered that let me jump to the next part of that he says in our Tabernacle at home when I first in our Baptist Church when I received the bapt AP ISM of the spirit and was called into the ministry we tried to seek out God for the spiritual gifts we had all the people that come who were gifted people maybe an hour before the service ever started now you couldn't do that unless you had people that were gifted and that was sought out and made known now when brother brandom was talking about seeking them out he's not talking about taking questionnaires right you know what this is where for for us us even in our lives we don't have to make anything happen the prophet tells us they're right here in the body the only thing we have to say is is Lord I want to be available I want to be available Lord to how whatever you want to use me and I'll just say it in this way if there's one thing that Paul stressed that we should seek after more than anything that's more of the love of God because when we brother BR says when we've got perfect love then you'll have perect perfect gifts so notice brother Bram goes on and I want to just kind of read through this here he says and the gifts of the Spirit is one would speak in unknown tongues and another give interpretation it could not be just a quoting of scripture because God don't use vain repetition yay I the Lord am coming yay I the Lord I'm coming I know that right that's not a direct message to the church it's got to be direct you say what what kind of direct this you got an example the prophet over and over I've got multiple quotes just exactly he says as the angel of the Lord was here on the platform that direct like brother brandham when he put that out there over and over he said oh brother brandham oh brother R you're putting us on the spot and the prophet said ain't I on the spot every night See's he's dealing with the sincerity and the reverence of those gifts right now notice he goes on and he saying now he says it must be some direct message to the church and then if it was to the church before it could be received in the church they had to at least three spiritual gifts there that was to call them like judges to judge and then three people with the gift of discernment in the Bible it's called and one would raise up and say it's of the Lord another one raised up it's of the Lord now brother br's talking about when he had them they were gathering prior to service he had a there was a place a room that was reserved you'd have them in there and one would raise up that's of the Lord what was said that's of God another one raises up it's of the Lord so two out of three declares it's of the lord it's wrote down it's put here on the pulpit watch he says so then the messages was taken down and then placed placed on my desk it couldn't be now like Jesus is coming soon we know that we know that it would be something like this watch's this example tell thus sayith the Lord tell brother Jones to get away from that place where he lives for it's near a railroad track for tomorrow at 2:00 there's going to be a wreck there and his house will be destroyed that's a direct message but before brother Jones can receive it it's got to be judged oh brother Samuel this is just killing everything I say it like this if there's anything the word kills then it needs to be killed buried and forgotten about God never came to kill the message never came to kill the gifts it came to put him in order because we're not rallying around gifts we're rallying around the gift of the Holy Ghost the person of Jesus Christ or tell brother brandham that tonight there'll be some someone come in here from a certain place that's got a certain disease be dressed in a certain way and he shall go to them they'll be brought in tonight by ambulance and tell them that this thing that's against them thus sayith the Lord if those messages were taken down the witnesses witness that it was the Holy Spirit it was then laid on the pulpit and then the church began gather and all the gifts would have done their part in the meeting there was nothing taking place then but the singing of hymn so now brother Bram is laying this in that went from the pre-service now into the song service brother Bram says and when I came out to speak which when I was in the room they'd press a button a red light would come on I'd been in there maybe all afternoon praying and walking with the message of the Lord on my heart and before I made the message or preached from the platform on the pull pit these these messages I read them off then went on with the message and then after the message the altar call if these things that were written on there came to pass we thank the Lord and praised him for it if it didn't come to pass they had a cleaning up time there was an evil spirit among them cuz God don't tell lies brother BR says and that's the way the gift should be operated and then all this stuff that goes on in the name of the gifts would be called out and no one wants an evil spirit on there to lie and to do those things they want the real there's a real Spirit you don't have to have that kind of a spirit God's got a real spirit for you so you don't want them things that the devil would give and that's the way the gifts should be operated I don't know why I got double slides in there and if that was wrong then all those people repented and prayed and did I say that one already they prayed and fasted and went before the Lord till that Spirit got off of them and all of them and the witnesses and the ones who discerned it so not only the person who who the interpretation but everyone that discerned it all of them it's an evil spirit this is why you know when you we this is why the the carefulness within things let me just say this to you you think evil spirits won't try to give me inspiration that's why everything when I when I receive something let me just tell you something it isn't something you say oh oh I felt that inspiration that was of the devil you can try to psych people out but that ain't the truth you have to take it all back to the word I want to see it from Genesis to Revelation when I can see it all the way through but if there's one hang up on that inspiration that didn't come from God right and I can say thank you Lord get that out of here you say oh how could that be well let's look at the prophet of God how many times the angel of the Lord visited him he had more visitations than what anybody's had but yet here he is over in Cairo Egypt and he's getting ready to go to Israel and the spirit of the Lord is speaking to him but he don't know it's the spirit of the Lord he's asking Lord is that you telling me not to go right is that right he asked him three times that he stepped over in the hanger yeah not the coat hanger you know where the airplanes come out he stepped over there took his hat off and he says Lord is that you talking to me you see this is why I I love I love that transparency it just goes to show us we don't base anything on a feeling it might feel exactly like when the spirit of God has spoke to us but judge even in your own life judge everything not by how it feels you judge it by the word amen and if you're not sure wait until you're sure because God's not going to fault you for wanting to be sure is that all right brother BR says they were if it wasn't they were all wrong and we had to get the thing cleaned up that's the way the gifts should be operated in the church to my opinion now I know people might say well that's his opinion I'll take his opinion we got a Vindicated Prophet I'll take his opinion that's the way it worked wonderful in our Tabernacle at home watch this if that would work in a Baptist Church it surely ought to work in a Pentecostal Church certainly ought to it's just the sincerity you must respect those gifts and give them a place and everything where they should be brother BR said it's the Bible the Bible's the blueprint just how it should be put together how they should operate then you'll have no trouble at all nowhere everything will move just exactly in the will of the Lord look at that statement if he wants anything said he will speak it and give the interpretation of it and set it out and it'll happen just exactly to the minute the way God said it would God wants to use the scissors he'll do it if he wants to use the stap for tonight he'll do it if he don't need to use any of them tonight he don't have to use any of them tonight is that right true brother Bram says it like this I let me just have just a few more moments here I want to just tie I want to bring this down to a certain point and then and then I'm off brother BR he goes on once again here in Southern Pines North Carolina on that same thing that I've just went through and read to you but at the end of this quote he says put your church in that kind of order and watch what Pentecost Rises to that's the way Paul had it done that's the way it's done in the scripture and he goes on of how things you know are not just people just standing up just in the middle because brother Bram seen that people standing up in the middle of preaching and everything else and it was actually that's what was taking place even there at home in the Tabernacle and brother Bram goes on in in different places there within the scripture uh within the message but I want to just this word here and I let me just wrap this up tonight brother Bram uses this term accumulating he's he's he's speaking in in Daniel 70 weeks and I'll read it to you Lord willing next week he said we're beginning to see the gifts accumulating Among Us he said and we see them to where that things are actually they're being wrote down and it's coming to pass and so brother brandham is getting he's longing that it can actually come back to a place to where they can be able to meet before service cuz he's he's admonishing them all the way through all all the way through 64 this is your part in the body it's a needed Ministry but you see this is what I want to say in the meantime the order still applies in that if one speaks in tongues pray that he may prophesy or interpret right if there's no interpreter which would be prophecy then don't speak at all but if it's prophecy it's got to be a direct message and it comes in its rightful time so it' be just like what we would have right here we're we're not in the place right now to have have get a side you know and designate a room perhaps God will bring that about before the the Rapture that's a Target but right now just like when brother bram's talking about the Tabernacle there's got to be an accumulating of gifts because if you have someone speaking in tongues you also have to have someone interpret right and if you have that you also have to have that which is able Gifts of discernment so that has to has to work together but in the meantime they're still here in the body and it isn't that God is you know God's put out but at the same time we don't want to be racing or trying to chase after gifts I'll tell you this if we just fall more in love with him then if if he wants to use us for something he'll make that known to us let let let him bring these things around let him bringing around in his own time just like in a service in its rightful time because let me tell you it's necessary these are necessary Parts because we God would never put them in the body if they are not needed in some way look how brother Bram he says this concerning his sister let me read this one to you is this all right I told you I I I really mean it I'm going to read this quote and I'm done let me just let me just show you this what brother bram's dealing with right here and showing you that right now where it's at it would it would take place after the ministering of the word after the word has been ministering the spirit of the prophets is subject unto the prophets watch how brother Ram says this he's just come out to the platform and and he says now he says now that at first he was just getting ready to speak to the people and this sister broke into speaking in tongues he said did you notice the interpretation didn't come to the word our sister was anointed with the Holy Spirit no doubt watch brother BR didn't un christianize her right she in the brandom time this she was out of order but he didn't UNC christianize her watch how he does this our sister was anointed with the with the spirit no doubt but she had given the message after the word had come in brother bam had just come to the pl the platform he was just praying and getting ready to come in it's just a little bit from the order of the thing now that was all right sister dear ever who you are watch out brother br brother BR is a gentleman because you know why the holy spirit's a gentleman he he just he just let it be known right there I thank God for this example he says now he said that's a holy spirit upon you he says it's hard to hold it like that I know or when you're be saying something and it's all right but you probably felt it even before that we started you know before we started to preach but that's the reason it comes back when the spirit's working the spirits of the prophesied the prophets you see that's you maybe the Holy Spirit anoints you again I hope he does just after the service is over talking about after the ministering of the word the prophet said I hope he anoints you again you watch the interpretation come because it could could be straight in order then but we're just approaching the word here now that was really God it really was I believe it and I feel it with all my heart because I felt the back come to it you see but it wasn't time and it's got a message to the sister for the church but here's where he's working his message now you see he won't confuse himself he puts all things in order don't you love him so there's a Target there's some things that I want to God will help us You' like to stand I want to just wanted to continue to work with that just a little bit as the Lord and just pressing on my heart and just dealing with this on the order of spiritual gifts because I tell you friends whatever God put in the church it's still in the church God never intended for it to be taken away I know I know you know I've I've heard it said where when you get sometimes to things like this and you start really things start having to be you know put in order in a way and you go into that then it's you know sometimes you'll have things where people say oh you're you're just trying to stifle the move of God anybody any real son or daughter of God don't want to stifle the move of God but there God has an order he has a timing he has a place and we want we want we want whatever is needed we want we want God to work in his own way in his own time and like i' I've said to you right here my wife and I were we were just it was I think it was last night I I think it was last night or maybe the night night before we were sitting there in a living room and she had had on a message and after we got out out of dinner and and I was sitting there and I was just studying and she was she had on this she had on the message he cares do you care and and I'm just just continuing looking over um the quotes and things you know after supper i' left here and I just I wanted to continue to look over things and all of a sudden I said I looked at her I said did you hear what the prophet just said on there you know it just seemed like it caught me and what it was there was a sister who had come up to be prayed for but she had a burden for somebody else in the congregation and the prophet said did you see that how that went when she went back and laid her hands on that other sister she went by there I stopped at I told my wife I said you see what that was I said that was one of the gifts working in the body right there God moving and placing that in somebody's heart in here they went by they had a burden somebody else had a need and it was so moved upon their hearts you see the things that we're covering we're looking at here here with tongues and interpretation look this is one of the things that Paul dealt with the most within the book of Corinthians I don't know but I would say that probably that they would look at tongues and Ma you see the supernatural it would be a very Supernatural occurrence but I want to just say to you every one of those gifts are Supernatural and tongues itself is the least wisdom is what is the top because because without wisdom we don't know how to operate anything wisdom knowledge on down but don't you thank God for his mercy God knows what we have need of he knows how to speak to our hearts I I thank God for for his Mercy let's just bow our heads on a word of prayer Heavenly Father Lord I so thank you Lord for your mercy I thank you Father for your leadership and your gu guidance Lord in our lives in this hour thank you Father for the [Music] clarity Lord Jesus sometimes Lord were these things that we we revisit Lord as you would lead us I find the propit Lord throughout the number of years within the message not just throughout the country and different places as he would speak but even right there Lord at his home Church things would be Revisited Lord even to where it would come down to a a time to where when the word would after the gifts had been accumulated you come down to a real testing time whether they would heed to the correction and Leadership of the world word or they would just go their own way Lord Jesus I feel like Lord that the prophet said he said anything I need to be corrected in I want to be corrected he said the Holy Spirit within my life that puts me in that place I want to be when I'm wrong I want to be right I want to be corrected Lord I thank you Father for speaking to our hearts taking us I want to say Lord I Thank you for even just within this time just as you've been leading me Lord and combing back through certain things even things that I've put before you Lord you know in prayer and I've asked you Lord I need understanding father you've not failed Lord in your time in your time Lord You've spoken you've given us the leadership that we need Lord Jesus help us I pray if there's one thing Lord that we want if there's one thing Lord that we could set our sights on as a body of Believers those that are gathered here those on the internet Lord that are streaming those Lord that would tune into to this service if there's one thing that we can set our sights on May It Be the love of God because Lord without Divine love these gifts have no value there's no it's divine love that gives value to the gift no matter how that a man could preach that's not what a value is it's not a value how he could put together scriptures and quotes that's not the value the value is the love of God this is why Lord even when it comes to a home as a husband wife how that Lord here within the church it's to be governed by love Lord we're not seeking for gifts we're seeking for more of you and Lord just like those little little utensils I brought out of my office I use them from time to time sometimes Lord I've went my office I had no idea that I was going to use that particular utensil I went in there today Lord there something I had to print out and then I wanted to staple it and put it in a file I had no idea did not even go into my office in there and print that out with a mind I'm going to staple this Lord neither neither do you want us that we would be focused on anything but you lord it's you that we want more of Lord I need more of you I need more of the love of God you know Papa I've told you that I I want more of it Lord I want more of the love of God I don't want more Lord I'm not interested in being a better preacher I'm interested Lord I want more of the love of God to have more longsuffering more patience I want more of the holy spirit that I could be more of a servant Lord to your people I want more of the love of God lord being able to look at differences and have Lord such a a love for one another oh God help us help us Lord help us through our families through this church Lord God for lord it's that's what it's going to take your Prophet never never received a word from the other [Music] side that it's going to take nine spiritual gifts to get here although they're in the body but he said it will take perfect love Lord Jesus I've Got Confidence Lord you're leading us to that Lord that Perfection we want to press on more and more so help us Lord while we're here in this journey God I pray father right Among Us I've seen you I've seen you operate I've seen things Lord where you've been Soul where things Lord God have been right in line with like what I spoke right here tonight help us Lord as a People Help Us Lord recognizing that you've never taken anything from us the word of God has never come to quench the spirit but Lord Jesus may it bring a rest a relaxing in you that's what Lord this time is your Prophet called under that seven seal it's a relaxing time it's the rest
