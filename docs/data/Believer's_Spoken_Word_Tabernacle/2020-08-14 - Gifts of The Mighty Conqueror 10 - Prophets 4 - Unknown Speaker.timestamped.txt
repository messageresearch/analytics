[35:50] lord we love you and we thank you
[35:52] tonight
[35:53] in the precious name of the lord jesus
[35:56] christ amen amen
[35:59] amen let's look in the word of the lord
[36:02] here tonight i
[36:03] want to read back in ephesians 4
[36:07] we're just going to read one verse of
[36:10] scripture
[36:11] verse 11 and then we'll let you have
[36:13] your seeds
[36:21] there are the gifts of the mighty
[36:23] conqueror and i'd like to
[36:25] just look at that in verse 11 of
[36:27] ephesians 4
[36:30] and he gave some apostles
[36:34] and some prophets some evangelists
[36:37] some pastors and teachers
[36:41] whatever god provides is because we have
[36:44] needham
[36:45] god just doesn't um he just doesn't send
[36:48] things or
[36:49] or give things just to be given but it's
[36:52] for
[36:53] it's our for our provision so
[36:56] we want to look at that a little bit
[36:58] tonight a little bit more on that of
[37:00] prophets and just ask the lord that he
[37:02] will just have his way
[37:03] and move among us in a special way
[37:05] tonight amen may god bless you
[37:08] the manager of being seated
[37:23] this right here when we look at this i
[37:28] know we've already been speaking
[37:30] multiple services on this
[37:32] and there's going to be multiple more
[37:35] because every time i keep going and
[37:37] trying to cut away at a little bit more
[37:41] there's just things that just continue
[37:45] to further stand out and
[37:48] just to even get it to a place to where
[37:51] we're looking at it for our day uh
[37:54] i know that we have young ones we have
[37:57] as far as young people
[37:58] there's uh some that are new to the lord
[38:01] as well too and
[38:02] and i just trust that not only for them
[38:05] but it'll be a benefit to all of our
[38:07] lives because
[38:08] um even as i've been going through this
[38:10] as the lord's been opening it
[38:12] no i've just been having a jubilee
[38:14] myself
[38:16] and you know that's how the word of the
[38:17] lord is it's not something that if
[38:20] you're
[38:20] if you're still looking at the word and
[38:22] you know it's not that we see something
[38:24] different
[38:24] it's that there's more depth to it that
[38:27] you begin to see
[38:28] more to it and that's the word of god
[38:31] that's the
[38:32] promise that jesus said is that you
[38:34] begin to bring out of that treasure
[38:35] things both old and new
[38:37] and the word of god it makes us rejoice
[38:39] because we are seeing something that we
[38:42] are a part of
[38:43] and to recognize what god has done and
[38:45] that our eyes would be open
[38:47] and our lives have been changed that is
[38:50] that is something that's just so
[38:51] precious
[38:52] to our hearts so when we look at this
[38:54] with a prophet as we
[38:56] have been looking here in the scriptures
[38:59] we know many
[39:00] times that you you we come into people
[39:02] that will say well
[39:04] you know god doesn't have prophets
[39:05] anymore and yet we
[39:07] see that in the new testament as we
[39:09] looked at it that indeed
[39:11] uh god did and does have prophets
[39:14] and we recognize that how the spirit of
[39:17] god would come
[39:19] even in this hour and begin to restore
[39:22] these things to you and i so that we
[39:24] could see
[39:26] brother brannon would make it clear he
[39:27] says that every preacher
[39:29] is a prophet now what he's what he was
[39:32] dealing with is the spirit of god he
[39:34] says when he comes and anoints that man
[39:36] and that man is speaking
[39:38] under divine inspiration of god and he's
[39:41] forth telling the word is is
[39:44] is being ministered but yet we recognize
[39:47] that there are indeed as every prophet
[39:50] is
[39:51] is um every preacher is a prophet but
[39:54] and that scripture would apply even with
[39:56] that and we think of agabus and
[39:58] we think of others but what we have
[40:00] begun to look at here i don't know maybe
[40:02] it's
[40:02] been the past couple services but
[40:04] looking at when
[40:05] god would send a major a prophet
[40:09] and this is not just a an ordinary
[40:11] preacher
[40:12] but it is a man that is specially built
[40:14] with a gift in his life
[40:16] and to be able to recognize what that
[40:18] means and i think of it
[40:20] as young people and many that could sit
[40:22] around
[40:23] sometimes the terminology in these
[40:26] things and i i trust that it's not
[40:28] terminology
[40:29] but to understand that sometimes we hear
[40:31] these words
[40:32] and we can just begin to take it for
[40:34] granted and not just young people
[40:36] but some of you maybe that have sat here
[40:38] and been around
[40:39] the word for many years and yet to you
[40:43] it's still a mystery on what it what is
[40:45] this about
[40:46] a prophet and and what is you know with
[40:48] brother branham as we
[40:50] look at that and recognize that to be
[40:52] god's promise in his word that he would
[40:54] send
[40:55] a prophet in this hour to take us back
[40:58] bring us back to the faith uh the
[41:01] original faith
[41:02] that was given there by god himself on
[41:05] the day of pentecost
[41:06] these are not things that we are to take
[41:09] lightly but
[41:10] is to recognize that with all of this
[41:13] that when we
[41:14] we think of it a prophet is also one
[41:17] who is a seer and one who is seer
[41:21] meaning that
[41:22] that god gives that man sight that goes
[41:26] beyond his
[41:26] natural sight uh there are things that
[41:29] you and i
[41:30] can you and you could take your bible
[41:33] open your bible
[41:34] and read your bible and you could see
[41:37] god said this
[41:38] he said this he said not to do this and
[41:40] not to do that
[41:41] and in reality we ought to be giving
[41:44] ourselves
[41:45] to that because there are things that
[41:48] god has laid out in his word
[41:50] that you don't need anybody to come and
[41:53] reveal it to you
[41:55] paul let me give you an example paul
[41:57] would say regarding your sanctification
[42:00] in your walk with god he said concerning
[42:03] that
[42:03] this is the will of god and you know
[42:06] what god's will is
[42:07] you see there are things that god has
[42:10] laid out
[42:11] in his word that it doesn't take
[42:14] something breaking forth for us to be
[42:16] able to
[42:17] do uh to say oh my but it does
[42:20] take the inspiration of the spirit of
[42:24] god
[42:24] to actually make that word real to us
[42:29] and that our hearts would become a place
[42:32] of betting ground that that word that
[42:35] we're reading
[42:36] can be find its place in fertile ground
[42:40] and be moved from just a seed to an
[42:43] actual manifestation of that word
[42:48] and that's all god's working because it
[42:50] takes god
[42:51] to come on the scene and to break up the
[42:54] stony ground the stony heart
[42:56] it takes god to come on the scene and to
[42:58] give you
[42:59] a new spirit because your old spirit you
[43:02] couldn't even get along with yourself
[43:04] and then it takes him what is he doing
[43:06] preparing
[43:07] his dwelling place in your life that he
[43:11] might come and set down in the midst of
[43:14] your life
[43:15] it's god preparing his own way he's
[43:17] jehovah jireh
[43:19] so when we see this as a prophet is one
[43:22] who is
[43:23] a seer a divine interpreter of the word
[43:27] they're a sign so it is it is where
[43:30] where where uh men have gotten
[43:33] off and the teachings and they just get
[43:36] off on teachings it would be just like
[43:38] you going on a roadway on a trip and
[43:40] then you get off of the pathway
[43:43] or the route and yet you think well i'm
[43:45] heading to this destination
[43:47] you would tell everybody we're going to
[43:49] this destination
[43:50] but you know how it is if you get off
[43:52] the route you're not going to that
[43:54] destination
[43:56] tell a little story about myself here
[43:58] just happened i hate bypasses
[44:01] i hate them because bypasses my mind
[44:05] they're always playing with my mind
[44:07] do i go south on it do i go north on it
[44:09] do i go east on it
[44:10] do i go west on it how am i going to
[44:12] connect with it i've always hated
[44:13] bypasses
[44:15] well this time when we were we took just
[44:17] a few days
[44:18] at the end of last week and here you
[44:21] know we're just driving along you know
[44:22] and
[44:23] i'm listening you know we're listening
[44:24] to the supernatural series you know
[44:26] brother branham we're just going along
[44:28] and i'm just meditating on that and
[44:30] meditating on things i've been studying
[44:32] and
[44:32] just going along and i said why am i
[44:35] seeing signs that are talking about
[44:36] zanesville jamesville ain't towards
[44:40] jeffersonville
[44:41] zainswell here's another is going the
[44:43] direction towards cambridge
[44:46] so what did i have to do i had to come
[44:48] to the next place
[44:50] and turn around and go back and come
[44:52] back a little bit on 70 get
[44:54] back on 270 and then come back around
[44:57] after that
[44:59] really didn't change my mind about
[45:01] bypasses either it won the bypasses
[45:03] fault
[45:04] it was my fault my point within all that
[45:07] is that do we there is a desired
[45:10] destination if you would talk to all
[45:13] christendom you would ask them there
[45:16] would be those that would say
[45:17] yes we're looking for the coming of the
[45:19] lord yes we're believing on the lord to
[45:21] return
[45:22] but remember you've got to be following
[45:25] the right
[45:25] pathway there's not many
[45:28] ways there is one way
[45:33] jesus said i am notice the way it's not
[45:36] a doctrine
[45:36] it's not a teaching the way is the
[45:39] person of jesus christ i am
[45:43] the way the truth and the lies
[45:46] without the truth you don't have the way
[45:50] without the life you're not in the way
[45:52] and the truth is not in you
[45:56] all of this comes together it's not
[45:57] multiple paths now i know
[45:59] if you were going to go to cleveland you
[46:01] could take six along the lake and
[46:03] everything else or you could get out
[46:04] here on route two and go in or you could
[46:06] take turnpike get off 480
[46:08] and go in over there i understand
[46:09] there's many different ways to get there
[46:11] but i think you get to my point that
[46:14] there is not many different ways
[46:16] to get unto god no man coming to the
[46:19] father
[46:20] but by me there is one mediator
[46:23] between god and man and that's the man
[46:25] christ jesus
[46:28] so there must be sight that'll connect
[46:31] us into that
[46:32] because just to believe on him will
[46:34] never
[46:35] bring a change of life but when you get
[46:38] connected into that life
[46:40] then it is his life flowing through you
[46:44] to what others cannot see him but they
[46:46] can see
[46:47] what a real christian is and they can
[46:49] see that indeed
[46:51] he is seated in power because it is
[46:54] manifested in your life
[46:56] there's a greater power inside of you
[46:58] greater is he that's in you
[47:04] so a seer this is what it would be
[47:07] called in the old testament
[47:09] a seer
[47:13] to recognize in the new testament
[47:21] paul and i'm not going to even get close
[47:23] to that tonight
[47:24] paul was that first major prophet
[47:28] in the new testament because there had
[47:32] to be
[47:32] a separating of law and grace
[47:37] paul was chosen he didn't choose himself
[47:39] god chose him
[47:41] said i have chosen you to bear my name
[47:45] before the gentiles to be a light
[47:48] to deliver them from satan's hold
[47:52] he would minister to them the hidden
[47:55] mystery
[47:56] that lay there in the old testament
[48:00] that which lay in christ that all the
[48:02] rest of them they didn't understand it
[48:04] remember
[48:05] even the the the the the apostles
[48:08] asked him will at this time you restored
[48:11] the kingdom to israel
[48:15] they didn't see that
[48:18] peter did not see that but god
[48:22] gave that revelation to whom it was
[48:25] intended to be the spokesman of that
[48:28] revelation
[48:30] god had peter for the work of the
[48:32] circumcision and paul said he wrought
[48:34] mightily that work in peter
[48:36] just as he had wrought mightily the work
[48:38] in my
[48:39] in me toward the uncircumcision but in
[48:42] this day
[48:44] god promised by his word and i'm not
[48:47] getting into this
[48:48] either but god promised by his word that
[48:50] he would
[48:51] send another a prophet in this
[48:54] hour at the ending of those seven church
[48:57] ages
[48:58] the reality of that prophet coming was
[49:01] because the church
[49:02] had gotten off track
[49:05] they were headed in the wrong direction
[49:09] but god made a promise in his word
[49:12] that he would send elijah the prophet
[49:17] not elijah the man but the
[49:20] characteristic
[49:21] of elijah one who would stand on the
[49:24] word of god
[49:25] when there was all kinds of odds against
[49:28] him
[49:29] when the nation was stacked against him
[49:31] when all
[49:32] things were against him but god said he
[49:34] would send elijah the prophet to do what
[49:37] call us back to the original faith
[49:41] [Applause]
[49:43] not church rituals not church traditions
[49:46] but to call us
[49:47] back to a living god
[49:53] what do you call that previews
[49:58] but you said i i say that because when
[50:01] we are living
[50:03] there is one there's only here in the
[50:05] new testament
[50:06] two major prophets the gentiles then are
[50:08] gone and then those two witnesses those
[50:11] two prophets
[50:12] there stepped forth to israel and the
[50:15] gentile days are done
[50:19] so remembering that when god sends this
[50:22] word
[50:23] he interprets that word through the
[50:25] man's life
[50:27] the man is speaking the word and god is
[50:30] interpreting
[50:31] that promise so it is not the man
[50:34] claiming oh i'm this or i'm that
[50:36] no because remember the bible says it
[50:38] like this
[50:39] that the spirit of truth he will not
[50:42] glorify himself meaning that the vessel
[50:46] will never
[50:47] glorify itself but the spirit of truth
[50:50] working through that individual it
[50:52] brings that individual to the
[50:54] realization
[50:55] it must be caught doing it it is god
[50:57] doing it that's the same way in your
[50:59] life
[51:00] it's god doing it not i deliver it but
[51:02] christ who
[51:03] liveth in me
[51:06] is that right so to find
[51:09] that that that how god would send and
[51:13] interpret that word
[51:14] and god makes his word positive
[51:20] let that settle god makes his word
[51:22] prospect positive
[51:24] that's when god brings a prophet on the
[51:27] scene
[51:29] and when god brings that prophet on the
[51:31] scene there's a word
[51:32] to be spoken it's a manifestation of the
[51:35] living god
[51:36] for that the people's faith would be
[51:39] built in the word because remember
[51:41] the prophet is sent there anointed with
[51:44] the word
[51:45] to speak to the people that they might
[51:47] rise
[51:48] and take their inheritance
[51:53] oh glory i love this scripture hosea 12
[51:57] 13.
[52:00] by prophet the lord brought israel
[52:03] out of egypt and by prophet
[52:06] was he preserved mightiest nation in the
[52:09] world
[52:11] god didn't sit down and get another
[52:13] superior power
[52:18] doesn't need the efforts of man it's
[52:20] only a yielded vessel
[52:22] deliverance comes by yielded vessels
[52:29] and by a prophet the lord brought israel
[52:31] out of egypt no
[52:32] god wasn't interested in turning egypt
[52:34] around he was interested in bringing
[52:37] out of egypt israel
[52:40] who is israel my firstborn
[52:43] god's interested in bringing out your
[52:46] sons and his daughters
[52:47] that's what the word comes it comes to
[52:50] call you out
[52:51] it comes to call you out as a daughter
[52:53] of god and
[52:54] that's why you couldn't fit in with the
[52:56] world it takes the revealed word
[52:59] of the lord by the presence of jesus
[53:02] christ
[53:02] so that you begin to recognize wait a
[53:05] minute this
[53:06] is what i've been longing for and i
[53:08] can't even explain
[53:10] what it is
[53:11] [Applause]
[53:13] but it's just something that it just
[53:15] fits your hand like a glove
[53:17] [Applause]
[53:21] he brought israel out of egypt oh my
[53:24] and by a prophet was he preserved
[53:30] israel when they came out they come to
[53:34] the red sea
[53:35] pharaoh is going to try to impersonate
[53:39] but god told the prophet speak
[53:42] it was a spoken word that opened up the
[53:44] way
[53:47] it opened up the path through the blood
[53:50] are you with me
[53:51] the word brings us in contact with the
[53:54] blood
[53:55] it opened up the way and pharaoh tried
[53:58] to
[53:59] impersonate it and he was overtaken
[54:02] well was it israel was preserved
[54:06] by a prophet when it came time
[54:10] judgment was coming upon egypt impending
[54:13] judgment
[54:14] was coming remember god had told moses
[54:18] when he gets moses out there before the
[54:20] burning bush he said hey
[54:21] he says i have heard i have heard
[54:25] the cries of my people moses was busy
[54:28] being moses are you with me now i'll
[54:30] come to that later in a moment
[54:31] moses was just busy with just moses
[54:34] he was caught up with moses he was
[54:37] caught up
[54:37] with this this sheeper that sheep and
[54:40] this
[54:40] you know he was caught up with moses
[54:44] he had forgot he had forgotten
[54:47] the promise you see how natural things
[54:50] of life
[54:51] can invade and cause us to forget
[54:54] the promise it isn't that we forget
[54:57] it but yet what happens is we're not
[55:00] living according to it
[55:01] in a rare realm of expectation
[55:06] but god in his mercy calls his prophet
[55:10] calls him there over into that place and
[55:13] he says
[55:13] i have come down
[55:16] i've come down to bring him out of egypt
[55:20] so it was god remember what is a prophet
[55:23] is a sign
[55:24] the word of the lord comes to the
[55:25] prophet they were not listen to me
[55:28] israel had no chance of getting out of
[55:30] egypt
[55:31] without god sending his word
[55:35] and god's sending his word his word is
[55:37] not
[55:38] separate from him he is the word
[55:42] he came down himself brother you might
[55:45] look at that and say
[55:46] moses said the same thing lord when i
[55:48] say this
[55:49] what are they going to say but moses
[55:51] what he failed to recognize
[55:52] it isn't how forceful you can speak it
[55:55] isn't how this
[55:55] no it's that faith in your heart that
[55:58] can take that word
[56:00] and you may not even have an audible
[56:01] voice you may have such a hoarse throat
[56:04] you can only get it out with your lips
[56:06] moving but
[56:07] god he inspires that heart and the devil
[56:10] has to obey that faith in the living god
[56:18] hallelujah
[56:19] [Applause]
[56:28] i've come down to deliver them
[56:31] now come i'm sending you
[56:35] god sent it down right i think of how
[56:38] brother branham
[56:39] when he's you you he says this over and
[56:42] over
[56:43] god hiding in simplicity and and he says
[56:46] it over and over when god does something
[56:48] it's in such humility such humble
[56:51] he don't come to the big you know
[56:54] highfalutin and everything else
[56:56] that's what man thinks you see that's
[57:00] worldly thinking
[57:02] but god comes in humility
[57:06] my my my i got to stay on here because
[57:08] i'll go to preaching on
[57:09] hattie writing the rest of them but i
[57:10] got to stay right here tonight
[57:14] but notice when moses the bible remember
[57:16] what the bible said
[57:18] how be it not all came out by moses
[57:23] and yet you're looking you would say
[57:24] moses at the forefront
[57:26] they're all marching one and one right
[57:28] behind moses
[57:30] but not all of them came out under that
[57:32] revelation
[57:34] the wilderness was a testing ground
[57:40] are you with me it was a testing ground
[57:43] the wilderness did not take god by
[57:45] surprise
[57:47] god was ready to wipe all of them out is
[57:50] that right
[57:51] but god's mercy remember what the word
[57:54] has done
[57:55] in this hour if not for the word in this
[57:58] hour
[57:58] there would be no one to make up the
[58:00] breach
[58:02] but god and god threw his word in the
[58:04] heart of that prophet
[58:06] it stands in the breach brother
[58:09] amen and when god would have wiped it
[58:11] all out yet
[58:12] standing in the breach here is the mercy
[58:15] of god
[58:15] that's calling out why because there's a
[58:18] joshua in there
[58:19] there's a caleb in there come on
[58:22] somebody
[58:23] god would have wiped out all the
[58:24] moabites but there was a roof
[58:26] that had to come out of there
[58:31] oh there's a lot of things about our
[58:33] family tree
[58:34] it's not worth bragging on but god who
[58:37] is rich in mercy
[58:40] it's a paradox of what
[58:43] god has done he makes known his power
[58:53] yeah the bible goes on paul said they
[58:55] were all baptized unto moses
[58:59] meaning what you've seen it you're
[59:01] responsible
[59:03] god parted them you were baptized by the
[59:06] cloud
[59:06] by the pillar fly the red sea they were
[59:09] baptized
[59:10] god has opened the way
[59:16] tell your friends this is how serious it
[59:18] is you're responsible
[59:21] that's not to scare you but at the same
[59:23] time if you're not where you ought to be
[59:25] last call let god take you there where
[59:28] you need to be
[59:30] quit wrestling with hold my heart oh my
[59:32] just say god
[59:33] come and deal with my stony heart break
[59:37] up this fallow ground
[59:40] you can't plant seed on hard ground you
[59:43] got to break it up
[59:47] you know how it is when you go to break
[59:49] up ground you don't necessarily go out
[59:51] there with a shovel
[59:51] you'll take a pitchfork it's got some
[59:54] points on it
[59:55] you're going down deep and you're moving
[59:57] it around and moving around
[59:59] chunks are coming up you're loosening up
[1:00:00] that soil because you have intentions
[1:00:03] to plant
[1:00:09] they were preserved by a prophet
[1:00:12] when moses said you know when joshua and
[1:00:15] candle came back
[1:00:16] the rest of them come back and say uh-uh
[1:00:19] you ain't going to be able to do that
[1:00:22] right
[1:00:23] no no no but joshua and camp were
[1:00:26] preserved
[1:00:28] you know why they had received this word
[1:00:32] not as the word of a man
[1:00:35] they had a revelation of who moses was
[1:00:38] he was god's representative
[1:00:40] it was god's sign it was god's power
[1:00:43] that was made known to egypt and that
[1:00:45] was a sign to them
[1:00:46] that as i stand with this word and this
[1:00:49] word in me then god's
[1:00:50] power is with me to possess
[1:00:54] all that god has said belongs to me
[1:01:00] oh hallelujah moses was ordained by god
[1:01:04] you know brother brown was saying like
[1:01:07] this
[1:01:08] he moses was it was a sign
[1:01:12] he was a sign a prophet is a sign of
[1:01:16] judgment when you see a prophet
[1:01:17] come upon there's judgment coming
[1:01:21] when moses comes it was a sign
[1:01:25] i like how brother brahman says it like
[1:01:27] this that god
[1:01:29] prepared for israel
[1:01:33] now god's preparation was not just that
[1:01:37] he spoke it
[1:01:38] to abraham but remember
[1:01:41] before the foundation of the world
[1:01:44] god his plan of redemption was all
[1:01:48] laid out
[1:01:51] abraham was caught up into what god
[1:01:54] had already said
[1:01:57] and what god had already said gave him
[1:02:00] comfort
[1:02:01] to face the future oh
[1:02:04] don't you recognize this is what the
[1:02:06] revealed word of the hour
[1:02:08] does it mean by showing you and i into
[1:02:11] what
[1:02:12] god has already set
[1:02:15] it's finished it's a finished work
[1:02:19] then it gives us comfort to face the
[1:02:22] future
[1:02:28] hallelujah i said hallelujah
[1:02:33] glory be to god
[1:02:42] god prepared a sign for them so not only
[1:02:45] what was spoken
[1:02:46] but there at the burning bush god was
[1:02:49] preparing that sign
[1:02:53] hallelujah and you know when he came
[1:02:56] down there
[1:02:58] as we said not all recognize it you see
[1:03:02] moses knew who he was now listen to me
[1:03:05] now
[1:03:06] as a prophet he knew who he was
[1:03:09] he knew his position he knew
[1:03:12] what god had called him to do are you
[1:03:15] with me
[1:03:16] because god had told him that he's seen
[1:03:20] that
[1:03:20] identified but he could not tell that to
[1:03:24] the people
[1:03:27] i was going to let that drop he could
[1:03:29] not tell that to the people
[1:03:31] god sent him down there remember moses
[1:03:33] asked the question
[1:03:34] what am i going to tell them they're
[1:03:36] going to ask me what your name is
[1:03:38] because every time god comes in
[1:03:40] deliverance he reveals
[1:03:42] his name what am i going to tell them
[1:03:45] god tells them you say i am that i am i
[1:03:48] am the god
[1:03:49] of abraham i am the god of isaac
[1:03:53] [Music]
[1:03:56] i'm not the god of saying second-handed
[1:03:58] experiences i'm the god of a first-hand
[1:04:00] experience
[1:04:02] i'm the god of the first porn
[1:04:07] hallelujah so as he came in there
[1:04:09] remember
[1:04:10] brother brown would say just like this
[1:04:12] he said you know moses could not go in
[1:04:14] there and tell him hey
[1:04:15] hey look look i i'm the one hey hey i'm
[1:04:17] the one i'm him
[1:04:19] god don't work that way
[1:04:22] you get a guy that's trying to say i'm
[1:04:24] this and i'm that and i'm this and then
[1:04:26] that
[1:04:26] that's a billboard big as can be
[1:04:30] that he's not the one
[1:04:33] now i can do this and i can deacon and i
[1:04:36] can do this that's a billboard
[1:04:38] that man is not the man
[1:04:42] are you with me because moses comes into
[1:04:44] god's presence
[1:04:45] and he begins to spill all of his
[1:04:48] weaknesses
[1:04:50] what does that bring it brings him into
[1:04:51] a place of complete dependency on the
[1:04:54] power of god
[1:04:55] to perform the promise you see it took
[1:04:58] him beyond the written word the written
[1:05:00] word
[1:05:00] did not in itself have power to release
[1:05:02] him but when god who gave the word
[1:05:04] was revealed it took him into the spirit
[1:05:07] that's why
[1:05:08] the bible said the letter kill it but
[1:05:10] the spirit
[1:05:11] giveth life it makes the word alive
[1:05:14] inside of you
[1:05:17] hallelujah he couldn't tell him who he
[1:05:20] was
[1:05:22] but the elect caught it amen
[1:05:25] the elect caught it they didn't have to
[1:05:27] have it taught and
[1:05:28] taught and broke down to him they caught
[1:05:30] it it was just something about it
[1:05:32] that was just ringing to them
[1:05:36] think of it israel got two signs
[1:05:41] egypt egypt only got the one national
[1:05:44] sign
[1:05:46] took the water poured it out became
[1:05:48] blood that was a national sign
[1:05:50] judgment but the two signs think of what
[1:05:53] israel received oh my we could just
[1:05:55] preach a month of sundays on this
[1:05:57] they received that sign of where throw
[1:06:00] down that stick
[1:06:01] and there would be impersonators come
[1:06:03] but that stick remember what that stick
[1:06:06] represented in the hand of moses it
[1:06:08] represented the deity of jesus christ
[1:06:11] the name of jesus christ that is given
[1:06:14] into the hands
[1:06:15] of the church of the living god is that
[1:06:18] right
[1:06:19] and when then satan wanted to rise up as
[1:06:22] an impersonation
[1:06:23] and they threw down their sticks and
[1:06:25] their sticks became serpents
[1:06:27] but remember moses was rely upon what
[1:06:30] god had said
[1:06:31] and god had revealed his power and it
[1:06:34] was there in the midst of that test
[1:06:37] that the power of god overcame satan
[1:06:40] and all of those serpents that were
[1:06:42] there brother that's the same way
[1:06:45] sister in your life
[1:06:48] amen with the name of jesus christ there
[1:06:51] might be
[1:06:52] many things that are thrown down and
[1:06:54] tests and things that you can't explain
[1:06:56] but if you'll just yield to the power of
[1:06:59] god
[1:07:00] that's inside of you he will consume
[1:07:03] every one of those serpents you might
[1:07:05] stand there and say
[1:07:06] i don't know what to do let me tell you
[1:07:08] what to do stand still
[1:07:10] and see the salvation of god
[1:07:15] what's god consume that cancer watch god
[1:07:18] consume that depression
[1:07:19] what's god consume that anxiety once god
[1:07:22] consumed that situation
[1:07:24] [Applause]
[1:07:26] hallelujah
[1:07:29] every devil has to bow at the name of
[1:07:32] jesus christ
[1:07:44] put his hand in his bosom brought it out
[1:07:47] it was leprous
[1:07:49] showing that the heart of man is leprous
[1:07:53] it's from a lack of a proper diet what's
[1:07:55] a proper diet the bread of life
[1:08:00] he brought it out showing that the heart
[1:08:02] of man is consumed with leprosy
[1:08:04] if it's a life that just fades away the
[1:08:07] first birth
[1:08:08] will fade away but then he said take
[1:08:10] your hand
[1:08:11] and put it back into your bosom and pull
[1:08:13] it out and his hand
[1:08:14] oh my i think the bible says now it
[1:08:16] comes to my mind the bible says somebody
[1:08:18] was fresh
[1:08:19] his hand was so fresh you know the the
[1:08:21] skin i don't
[1:08:23] i don't have it in front of me but he
[1:08:24] just come to me of how that moses skin
[1:08:26] was
[1:08:27] when he pulled it out you know what it
[1:08:28] was it showed
[1:08:30] what god does in the heart of a believer
[1:08:33] brother he changes your life from a
[1:08:35] leprous condition
[1:08:37] where you're isolated from the presence
[1:08:39] of god
[1:08:40] you might want to be a christian but the
[1:08:43] leprosy in your heart
[1:08:44] you say what do i do let the hand of god
[1:08:47] touch you
[1:08:49] let the hand of god touch your soul
[1:08:52] and when he touches your life he'll
[1:08:55] change it from a leprous condition
[1:08:59] to a fresh life this is what a prophet's
[1:09:03] message does
[1:09:06] it come to call them out of where they
[1:09:08] were
[1:09:10] slaving going along into their
[1:09:13] inheritance
[1:09:19] you see the rest the rest of the world
[1:09:22] the rest of the world you and me
[1:09:25] included
[1:09:26] let me just bring it right down here
[1:09:28] even as a young person when i said
[1:09:30] and heard the message and go about my
[1:09:33] own life and maybe
[1:09:34] even as you're sitting here you
[1:09:36] recognize that
[1:09:37] if not for god coming by his word
[1:09:40] let me just put it to you just as simple
[1:09:42] as brother brown says it if not for god
[1:09:44] coming through the prophet and it being
[1:09:46] revealed to you
[1:09:47] you go right on living just like you
[1:09:49] always did
[1:09:51] got to build a new home this year got to
[1:09:53] get a better car than the jones
[1:09:54] got to do this he said so much on this
[1:09:56] and we and he said now those things are
[1:09:58] all right
[1:09:58] but you must realize brother all this
[1:10:00] stuff will perish you see what happens
[1:10:02] when that of a prophet comes it reveals
[1:10:05] when that's revealed to you it changes
[1:10:08] the priorities of your life
[1:10:11] your priority then becomes on the
[1:10:14] promise
[1:10:14] that god has manifested in that
[1:10:17] generation
[1:10:18] and the manifestation did not stop with
[1:10:20] the prophet
[1:10:21] that was only to identify the word
[1:10:24] that's promised
[1:10:25] to this generation and call us into that
[1:10:28] place
[1:10:29] that god might manifest his word through
[1:10:31] us
[1:10:36] you see to receive go outside
[1:10:40] by divine revelation and this i just say
[1:10:42] this very plainly and i i encourage you
[1:10:45] as your pastor
[1:10:46] these are things i've said and i've
[1:10:48] talked sometimes with people
[1:10:50] and you know i just say it this simple
[1:10:54] pray and ask god to reveal himself to
[1:10:59] you
[1:11:01] if you're content with where you're at
[1:11:03] and you say well you know i'm just
[1:11:04] saying you know i just like this church
[1:11:06] i like coming here some mighty fine
[1:11:07] people here i agree with you
[1:11:09] but it's more than just a good church
[1:11:10] and mighty fine people
[1:11:13] you want to get into that atmosphere
[1:11:15] that keeps touching your life
[1:11:17] because that atmosphere is not meant to
[1:11:19] just be at church
[1:11:21] he's letting you know when he's touching
[1:11:22] your life it's not by accident it's not
[1:11:25] just whoops i just happen to be here no
[1:11:26] no no
[1:11:27] god is letting you know that he's
[1:11:29] inviting you into that place
[1:11:31] to where whether you're here or you're
[1:11:34] out there on monday you're out there on
[1:11:35] tuesday
[1:11:36] you're no longer living just as one
[1:11:39] of this world where your priorities and
[1:11:41] ambitions
[1:11:42] and vision are on the things of life you
[1:11:45] have to take care of those things
[1:11:46] but it lifts you up
[1:11:50] into a place that you don't got to tell
[1:11:53] nobody
[1:11:55] if you got to tell somebody that you
[1:11:57] love god and your life don't show it you
[1:12:00] need to
[1:12:00] check your experience
[1:12:04] i'll show me and preach on if you've got
[1:12:07] to tell somebody
[1:12:08] what i believe the message and your life
[1:12:11] don't say it
[1:12:12] you need an experience with god
[1:12:17] if you say i believe that jesus christ
[1:12:20] is the son of god
[1:12:21] and your life don't declare it you need
[1:12:24] an experience
[1:12:25] with jesus christ
[1:12:29] i'm talking about a vision
[1:12:36] a vision of the word that gives you a
[1:12:38] sight that goes beyond this world
[1:12:41] where the word it'll take priority in
[1:12:42] your life because we're living in the
[1:12:43] time
[1:12:47] as it was in the days of lots as it was
[1:12:50] in the days of knowing
[1:12:52] people were occupied with themselves
[1:12:56] men are lovers of themselves that's
[1:12:58] peerless times
[1:13:02] they don't care who they destroy they
[1:13:04] don't care what they tear up they don't
[1:13:05] care what they do this they don't care
[1:13:07] what they don't care
[1:13:14] you see a lot of the things we wouldn't
[1:13:16] have them tearing down statues if there
[1:13:17] hadn't been god torn down in pulpits
[1:13:20] preached brother samuel they tore down
[1:13:23] god and look what it's produced
[1:13:24] [Applause]
[1:13:26] a bunch of marxists and anarchists and
[1:13:28] everything else this is what it's
[1:13:30] produced why they tore down god
[1:13:34] they tore down a genuine experience of
[1:13:36] the holy ghost
[1:13:37] where god comes and dwells in them
[1:13:42] let me get back on here that's reality
[1:13:45] though
[1:13:46] i said that's reality you can't have the
[1:13:48] message going on out there
[1:13:50] and not be connected back in with church
[1:13:55] let me just tell you something you can
[1:13:57] have religion
[1:13:58] but religion will never save you
[1:14:02] religion don't match the challenge of
[1:14:03] the hour
[1:14:05] you can know everything about this
[1:14:07] message and it's all religion
[1:14:09] you've got to have the power of god who
[1:14:12] sent this word in this generation
[1:14:16] [Applause]
[1:14:23] i pray to god whether you're streaming
[1:14:25] or you're here if that's not anchored in
[1:14:26] your soul
[1:14:27] i pray that god won't let you sleep i
[1:14:29] pray he'll deprive you
[1:14:31] of every ounce of peace i pray he'll
[1:14:33] shake your soul
[1:14:34] until you recognize i need an experience
[1:14:38] with jesus christ to recognize
[1:14:41] that's available
[1:14:44] [Applause]
[1:14:54] the vision the vision will declare
[1:14:57] itself
[1:15:00] it reveals when god is revealed when the
[1:15:02] vision of the word is revealed
[1:15:06] you don't have to wonder
[1:15:09] are people really serving the lord
[1:15:13] that's right that's right they're living
[1:15:15] for god whether they're in
[1:15:16] in church on sunday or or thursday then
[1:15:18] it's monday tuesday when he's their life
[1:15:25] and i just say a point blank for people
[1:15:27] who want to stay out of church for every
[1:15:29] little excuse i'm not talking about
[1:15:30] it
[1:15:34] but for every little excuse and got
[1:15:36] every little thing in the world i'm
[1:15:37] trying to speak
[1:15:38] deep to your soul you need a real
[1:15:41] checkup with god
[1:15:43] because you're not going to bypass this
[1:15:45] this is a sign
[1:15:46] that's been put right before you
[1:15:54] man why can't i preach happy things
[1:16:00] but it's the truth i said it's the truth
[1:16:06] i don't want a church life yeah i don't
[1:16:09] want a church of life
[1:16:12] so god through the ministry
[1:16:16] of a prophet oh how much is brought let
[1:16:19] me let me just
[1:16:20] let me just skip a few things here i'm
[1:16:22] going to ohio
[1:16:23] hosea chapter 12 verse 10 i have also
[1:16:27] spoken
[1:16:28] by the prophets and i have multiplied
[1:16:32] visions and used similitudes
[1:16:35] he's not just talking about their person
[1:16:39] as far as god stepping down in that
[1:16:41] prophet because remember a prophet is a
[1:16:43] sign
[1:16:46] when john came on the scene it was a
[1:16:48] sign the messiah
[1:16:50] is at hand when ezekiel was a sign
[1:16:54] of judgment all right jeremiah
[1:16:58] isaiah these were signs when moses came
[1:17:01] it was a sign of judgment
[1:17:03] on egypt
[1:17:07] but these similitudes was not just god
[1:17:09] coming down
[1:17:11] and moving behind those vessels remember
[1:17:15] these prophets god would have
[1:17:19] ezekiel to lay on his side for what was
[1:17:22] it 430 days
[1:17:23] on on the one side and then
[1:17:27] on the other then then lay on his other
[1:17:29] side
[1:17:30] for i think 90 days
[1:17:35] i can't even lay on my side probably
[1:17:38] when i sleep for an hour
[1:17:42] are you with me what i'm trying to say
[1:17:44] is is that
[1:17:45] you look at that and brother branham
[1:17:46] would say this in the message
[1:17:48] a true sign overlooked he said you know
[1:17:50] you would wonder in your mind
[1:17:52] why does this have to be done i want you
[1:17:55] to think about it
[1:17:56] brother brown said many of these
[1:17:57] prophets were thought by the people
[1:18:00] to be mentally disturbed
[1:18:04] in reality they were the most sane
[1:18:06] people
[1:18:06] [Applause]
[1:18:09] they think we're nuts but we're in our
[1:18:11] right mind
[1:18:17] i'm not out in strange they're the
[1:18:19] strange birds
[1:18:21] they don't have a they don't have an
[1:18:22] identity but we're eagles
[1:18:25] the bible says out there they are full
[1:18:27] of every
[1:18:28] unclean and hateful bird we're not
[1:18:32] birds we're eagles
[1:18:34] [Applause]
[1:18:36] we're not in a cage we're in liberty in
[1:18:39] jesus christ
[1:18:44] we're not strange when they think you're
[1:18:47] i don't care when people think i'm out i
[1:18:49] don't care
[1:18:50] you don't do this or that you know just
[1:18:52] like i told her one time
[1:18:54] i just started working and here come
[1:18:56] this older
[1:18:57] lady was an age she was you know 72
[1:18:59] years old or whatever and
[1:19:01] she was like like almost like a spring
[1:19:02] chicken and and uh
[1:19:05] mom she didn't get around as good as you
[1:19:10] had to put that in for good measure
[1:19:14] oh happy hour's coming she came by the
[1:19:18] room
[1:19:18] sam happy hour tonight said she said
[1:19:21] you're going to be
[1:19:22] there i said no betty why not i said
[1:19:24] because i'm a christian
[1:19:28] well i am too i don't know because what
[1:19:31] i got
[1:19:32] he took that drink out of me he took
[1:19:35] that out of me
[1:19:37] i didn't have to lay it down he took it
[1:19:38] out
[1:19:40] so if it was all right i figured he'd
[1:19:42] let it alone
[1:19:46] glory
[1:19:49] oh my and you similar to god use those
[1:19:52] things
[1:19:52] laying on the side here and laying on
[1:19:55] the side all of these things
[1:19:57] like one walking around naked what was
[1:19:59] it showing you know why god did that
[1:20:01] because they would not read the word
[1:20:05] brother braham said they got to a place
[1:20:07] that the bible was boresome to them
[1:20:10] they won't read the word
[1:20:14] they get to a place they don't even pray
[1:20:16] this is what brother i'm saying
[1:20:18] it's true it just becomes religion but
[1:20:21] this is what we're a part of
[1:20:22] this is what we do
[1:20:27] christianity is not a
[1:20:31] that's lifestyle it's the life of jesus
[1:20:34] christ on display
[1:20:40] darmish have lifestyle we're not
[1:20:43] lifestyle
[1:20:45] it'll change your life oh my let me go
[1:20:48] and use similitudes by the ministry of
[1:20:50] the prophets
[1:20:51] now every gift that god gives it's sent
[1:20:53] with a for a divine purpose
[1:20:55] let me let me move here first samuel 3
[1:20:57] 1.
[1:20:59] and here comes samuel that's how this is
[1:21:00] ministered he ministered unto the lord
[1:21:03] before eli
[1:21:04] and the word of the lord was precious in
[1:21:06] those days
[1:21:07] there was no open vision
[1:21:12] the word of the lord was precious but
[1:21:14] there wasn't an open vision
[1:21:16] there wasn't no prophet there you see to
[1:21:20] open up into the thoughts of god
[1:21:26] and remember in genesis 15 1 the word of
[1:21:29] the lord came
[1:21:30] unto abraham in a vision
[1:21:33] saying fear not abraham i am thy shield
[1:21:37] and by exceeding great reward vision
[1:21:40] is divine revelation
[1:21:43] your eyes become anointed they become
[1:21:47] open
[1:21:48] and you're seeing things reading in the
[1:21:50] word
[1:21:51] but you're saying not just letters
[1:21:54] but it's becoming real to you it becomes
[1:21:58] a
[1:21:58] pathway it becomes places for you to put
[1:22:01] your feet
[1:22:05] verse 19 the first samuel 3 and samuel
[1:22:07] grew and the lord was with him
[1:22:09] and didn't let none of his words fall to
[1:22:11] the ground
[1:22:12] and then none of his words see god it's
[1:22:14] god's word and he gave it to samuel
[1:22:17] and samuel was was committed to god
[1:22:20] to speak his word
[1:22:24] he had to speak things straight to eli
[1:22:27] that wasn't comfortable
[1:22:28] sleeping there in the house of the lord
[1:22:30] and here's eli the priest and then have
[1:22:32] to come him and say
[1:22:33] judgments come into your house but he
[1:22:36] have the word of the lord
[1:22:38] right and verse 20 and all israel from
[1:22:40] dan even to beersheba
[1:22:42] knew that samuel was established to be a
[1:22:46] prophet
[1:22:46] of the lord they knew it they knew it
[1:22:50] did it mean they obeyed it no but they
[1:22:52] knew it
[1:22:54] you see it this is why it's not enough
[1:22:56] to know brother brahms a prophet
[1:23:00] you gotta have the holy ghost
[1:23:04] get under the blood
[1:23:10] and the lord appeared again in shiloh
[1:23:13] for the lord look at this says the lord
[1:23:16] revealed himself to samuel
[1:23:18] in shiloh what's it say
[1:23:23] by the word of the lord how does god
[1:23:26] reveal
[1:23:27] himself by his word
[1:23:34] think of this as he revealed himself to
[1:23:37] samuel remember what remember what was
[1:23:39] going on in the judges
[1:23:41] when you read in the book of judges it
[1:23:43] says it in
[1:23:44] in multiple places and you see it every
[1:23:47] man
[1:23:48] did according to what was right in his
[1:23:51] own eyes
[1:23:53] this is why we must have a seer
[1:23:57] eyes that god will open
[1:24:00] and then that anointing comes upon our
[1:24:02] eyes
[1:24:03] not not these but the eyes down here
[1:24:13] because these eyes right here will tell
[1:24:14] you ah things are coming back in
[1:24:16] things are getting good and this but
[1:24:18] these guys down here say
[1:24:21] look away lift up your head
[1:24:24] your redemption is drawing nine these
[1:24:27] eyes will say
[1:24:28] you'll never make it this eye says he
[1:24:30] already made it for me
[1:24:32] [Applause]
[1:24:34] these eyes will pick up things that
[1:24:36] bring reasoning and imagination
[1:24:38] but these eyes down here on the inside
[1:24:40] they catch a hold
[1:24:41] of from that of the unseen realm
[1:24:44] and it stabilizes us
[1:24:50] that's why god has called us to walk by
[1:24:52] faith
[1:24:54] by revelation by the eyes of the lord
[1:24:58] you know it's impossible to please god
[1:24:59] without faith
[1:25:02] you see brother branham are not not
[1:25:04] brother brand but here the lord jesus
[1:25:05] in john 10. can i have just a few more
[1:25:08] moments
[1:25:09] let me just try to bring this down into
[1:25:11] a place in john 10
[1:25:13] i don't have it i don't think i included
[1:25:14] it but i've got it here
[1:25:16] when jesus you remember they
[1:25:19] the pharisees can't figure out what's
[1:25:20] going on here he is standing in front of
[1:25:23] them
[1:25:24] and they're asking him show us a sign
[1:25:26] show us a sign
[1:25:27] show us a sign and remember jesus said a
[1:25:31] wicked and adulterous generation seeketh
[1:25:33] after a sign
[1:25:34] i think what they were asking for they
[1:25:36] were there they were asking for a sign
[1:25:38] and brother brown takes that in the
[1:25:40] message true
[1:25:41] sign a true sign overlooked and he said
[1:25:43] they were actually asking for
[1:25:45] an emotion he said because you can look
[1:25:48] at the sunset and get emotional and cry
[1:25:50] or the sun rise and cry they were asking
[1:25:52] for a sign on here
[1:25:54] something that would give emotion
[1:25:58] but you see the promise was not that
[1:26:02] but the promise was the resurrection
[1:26:06] what they didn't recognize they claimed
[1:26:09] that we are the children of abraham
[1:26:11] we have you know the prophets and this
[1:26:13] and that and jesus
[1:26:14] identifies the spirit in them and says
[1:26:17] this is the same spirit
[1:26:19] that put those prophets in the toe
[1:26:22] come on now when stephen preached that
[1:26:24] day they took it they took his head off
[1:26:27] where they stoned him right because when
[1:26:31] when he came the religious they had the
[1:26:34] word
[1:26:35] but they couldn't recognize god's sign
[1:26:40] his word the same god that had been all
[1:26:42] along and yet here you had
[1:26:44] ignorant listen to me ignorant unlearned
[1:26:47] men i like how brother brandon throws us
[1:26:50] in there and includes it
[1:26:51] peter couldn't recognize his name if it
[1:26:53] was wrote on the side of a boxcar
[1:26:55] you know what that means even if he had
[1:26:57] poor eyesight and it was wrote on a
[1:26:59] billboard
[1:27:00] he wouldn't be able to recognize his
[1:27:01] name
[1:27:03] it sure god doesn't need the smarts
[1:27:06] and the intuition and the intellect it's
[1:27:09] not about our mind
[1:27:10] figuring it out it's god revealing
[1:27:14] himself in his word by his power
[1:27:18] hallelujah
[1:27:22] and they were asking for this sign show
[1:27:24] us this and show us that
[1:27:25] and here you have those
[1:27:28] where the word comes to them seeks them
[1:27:31] out
[1:27:32] and they receive it like the young man
[1:27:36] whose eyes were healed of blind
[1:27:37] lord who is he that i may worship him
[1:27:43] but jesus when he was speaking to them
[1:27:46] in john 10 34 he said it's written in
[1:27:49] your law that you're god's
[1:27:51] and if he called them gods unto whom the
[1:27:53] word of god came
[1:27:54] remember gods they were speaking
[1:27:57] the word that had come to them
[1:28:01] so it was god's word they didn't make
[1:28:04] the word
[1:28:04] up god gave it to him
[1:28:09] and when that word was received the same
[1:28:11] anointing
[1:28:12] that opened that word to the prophet
[1:28:14] came with that word
[1:28:16] and where the word finds a place the
[1:28:18] anointing comes with the word
[1:28:22] oh i feel like preaching a little bit
[1:28:26] say ye of him whom the father has
[1:28:28] sanctified sent into the world
[1:28:29] thou blaspheme is because i said i'm the
[1:28:31] son of god if i do not the works of my
[1:28:33] father
[1:28:34] believe me not but if i do though you
[1:28:36] believe me not believe
[1:28:37] though you do not believe me believe the
[1:28:39] works that you may know and believe that
[1:28:41] the father is in me
[1:28:42] and i in him he's tying it together when
[1:28:44] the word of god
[1:28:46] is come into your life
[1:28:50] what will that do it brings forth the
[1:28:53] works of god
[1:28:56] it brings forth the works of god though
[1:28:58] a person
[1:29:00] can look at you here here jesus jesus is
[1:29:03] the god prophet
[1:29:04] and he's letting him know if you can't
[1:29:06] believe me believe the works
[1:29:09] the works notice what's the works it's
[1:29:11] the word being interpreted
[1:29:15] believe the works that the father is in
[1:29:18] me
[1:29:19] and i am in him
[1:29:28] let's just stop there i don't want to
[1:29:29] lose this
[1:29:37] so god brings this he brings it together
[1:29:41] let me just let me just stop there like
[1:29:43] i close it and the way i don't keep
[1:29:44] going
[1:29:49] maybe we can come back to church
[1:29:50] tomorrow night
[1:29:53] saturday night
[1:29:57] i agree
[1:30:02] but you recognize within this i say god
[1:30:05] you see how it it
[1:30:06] the the parallel god's mercy
[1:30:10] god sends a prophet that prophet comes
[1:30:12] with the word of the lord
[1:30:15] he's not coming with his word
[1:30:19] it's god's word and god
[1:30:22] has given him that word to declare
[1:30:27] once you think of this many of the
[1:30:30] prophets
[1:30:32] the inspiration the bible tells us that
[1:30:35] holy men
[1:30:38] with god
[1:30:41] they spake as they were moved by the
[1:30:44] holy ghost
[1:30:49] you can read it in the scripture at
[1:30:51] times where daniel
[1:30:53] he would receive a visitation from god
[1:30:57] he didn't understand it but he wrote
[1:31:00] down
[1:31:01] what came to him
[1:31:04] brother rem said many of the prophets
[1:31:06] picked up daniel picked up many
[1:31:07] they didn't understand
[1:31:11] but they wrote it down because it was
[1:31:12] coming under inspiration
[1:31:16] you see they didn't have to understand
[1:31:18] it
[1:31:19] inspiration gave it inspiration will
[1:31:23] come
[1:31:24] in due season to anoint the word to be
[1:31:27] sounded out
[1:31:29] and the inspiration will come
[1:31:32] to bring that word into manifestation
[1:31:36] but simon what does that mean don't try
[1:31:38] to figure it all out
[1:31:41] just say be it unto me according to thy
[1:31:44] word
[1:31:45] just be simple the inspirations coming
[1:31:48] don't try to don't try to figure it out
[1:31:50] let it just fall into your life let it
[1:31:53] fall into your heart say god
[1:31:55] i want my heart to be a betting ground
[1:31:57] if there's things that
[1:31:58] i said earlier there's things in your
[1:32:00] life you see there's a hardness
[1:32:01] ask god say lord dissolve that hardness
[1:32:06] i prayed with an individual here not too
[1:32:09] many months ago
[1:32:11] talked to him on the phone and
[1:32:14] as i talked to him on the phone and
[1:32:16] began to talk about did we begin to talk
[1:32:18] about some different things and
[1:32:20] you know brother samuel you don't
[1:32:22] understand there's a you know
[1:32:24] these problems and these problems and
[1:32:26] these demons and things like that
[1:32:29] i said listen
[1:32:32] god he takes care of every one of those
[1:32:38] things i said
[1:32:40] god the same god that loosened my life
[1:32:43] is the same god it will set you free
[1:32:50] i began to speak to him as god was
[1:32:51] giving me word about their heart
[1:32:54] so i went to pray for him i said now
[1:32:57] do you do you may want me to pray in
[1:33:00] that manner
[1:33:01] i said no i want you to pray and this is
[1:33:04] what the individual said
[1:33:05] i want you to pray that god will soften
[1:33:08] my heart let me tell you something
[1:33:11] he's the same god
[1:33:15] he's softening that heart too
[1:33:20] he's the same god you see when a heart
[1:33:22] that's why brother braham says
[1:33:23] when a heart has a desire to see god
[1:33:27] there ain't nothing can hold them back
[1:33:31] let me tell you something you didn't
[1:33:33] give yourself that desire
[1:33:34] god gave you that desire put that on the
[1:33:38] inside of you
[1:33:39] it's god that come by and stirred it out
[1:33:42] that's why you couldn't be satisfied
[1:33:45] anywhere else you might have had your
[1:33:46] start in this church or
[1:33:48] start here and start there but there's
[1:33:50] something about it you
[1:33:51] just it seemed like this isn't home and
[1:33:54] you couldn't even explain it
[1:33:56] what was it you were born and ordained
[1:34:01] to live in his presence
[1:34:07] that your eyes might be anointed you go
[1:34:10] to school but you're not like the rest
[1:34:11] of the school kids
[1:34:13] you're not making yourself different
[1:34:16] it's god
[1:34:18] even even even when a person is not even
[1:34:22] living right
[1:34:22] has not even been changed it's a
[1:34:24] struggle for him to do
[1:34:26] those things you know why there's a
[1:34:30] convicting power
[1:34:34] and it's something you recognize you
[1:34:36] can't flow into it
[1:34:39] the rest of the world can go along with
[1:34:41] it it doesn't bother them
[1:34:44] but there's something different what is
[1:34:46] that that's a seed
[1:34:47] that's got to come to life and there's
[1:34:50] only one one
[1:34:51] one place he can come to life and that's
[1:34:54] bad
[1:34:54] the water of life himself
[1:35:01] thank god for eyes if not for eyes you'd
[1:35:05] be like i was
[1:35:06] oh praise god oh my i can't wait to get
[1:35:09] down there and
[1:35:10] you know see one of the places i was
