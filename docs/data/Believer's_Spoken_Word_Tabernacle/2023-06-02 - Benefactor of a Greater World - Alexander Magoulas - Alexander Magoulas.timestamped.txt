[33:21] Nehemiah the fifth chapter of course
[33:23] I've been speaking out of the book of
[33:24] Nehemiah the last few times I'd like to
[33:26] look here in verse 5
[33:28] I'm sorry chapter 5 verse 14 this
[33:31] evening and we'll read it on the 19th
[33:33] verse of course remember your pastor in
[33:35] prayer as well as he's traveling he he
[33:37] messaged me earlier that he's preaching
[33:38] tonight so uh of course they have a time
[33:40] difference so hopefully I'll be done by
[33:42] the time he starts but uh anyway
[33:44] Nehemiah the uh fifth chapter no I'm in
[33:47] the fourth chapter just saying here the
[33:49] fifth chapter verse 14. Nehemiah says
[33:51] this moreover from the time that I was
[33:53] appointed to be their governor in the
[33:55] land of Judah from the 20th year even
[33:57] into the two and thirtieth year of
[33:59] Archer Xerxes the king that is 12 years
[34:02] I and my brother have not eaten the
[34:04] bread of the governor but the former
[34:06] governors that had been before me were
[34:08] chargeable unto the people and had taken
[34:10] of them bred and wine beside 40 SEC
[34:13] shekels of silver yeah even their
[34:15] servants bear rule over the people but
[34:18] so did not I because of the fear of God
[34:22] now just keep that in your mind because
[34:23] of the fear of God so you say what's
[34:25] this God do with anything well I'm
[34:26] getting somewhere so verse 16 he says
[34:29] yea also I continued in the work of this
[34:31] wall neither brought bought we any land
[34:34] and all my servants were gathered
[34:36] thither unto the work moreover there
[34:38] were at my table and 150 of the Jews and
[34:41] rulers besides beside those that came
[34:44] unto us from among the Heathen that are
[34:46] about us now that which was prepared for
[34:48] me daily was one ox and six Choice sheep
[34:51] all so fouls were prepared for me once
[34:53] in 10 days store of all sorts of wine
[34:56] yet for all this required not I the
[34:58] bread of the governor because the
[35:00] bondage was Heavy upon this people and
[35:03] then verse 19 says think upon me my God
[35:06] for good according to all that I have
[35:09] done for this people may the Lord bless
[35:11] the reading his word you may be seated
[35:12] this evening
[35:14] for my thoughts it kind of you're like
[35:17] well that's really nice that he did that
[35:18] but what's what's where's this going
[35:19] tonight my thought tonight is of course
[35:21] we're speaking about the Lord as tonight
[35:24] the benefactor of a greater world Amen
[35:27] and so uh I was uh I was motivated here
[35:30] recently to look up the uh the net worth
[35:34] of our elected officials in Washington
[35:36] D.C and it's really enlightening as you
[35:40] should check it out sometime it's
[35:41] enlightening when you realize that the
[35:43] mean or average income of the or I'm
[35:44] sorry the the net worth rather of a of a
[35:47] congress member the average is a million
[35:49] dollars they're each that's by average
[35:51] they're a millionaires some are
[35:52] multi-millionaires and then to be fair
[35:54] some of them have made money from other
[35:56] Ventures or they married into money but
[35:58] many of these people they've made tens
[36:00] of millions of dollars while they're in
[36:03] office and of course they don't get paid
[36:04] tens of millions of dollars a year but
[36:06] somewhere they made tens of millions of
[36:08] dollars and so I was reminded of the
[36:10] words of Harry Truman He says show me a
[36:11] man that gets Rich by being a politician
[36:14] I'll show you a crook
[36:17] so we realize there's a lot that goes on
[36:19] in the realm of politics and it's not
[36:21] just politics in America but especially
[36:22] in America we realize it's true and so a
[36:25] lot of people they enter a public office
[36:27] or or let me just bring it home a little
[36:29] bit sometimes they enter a Ministry or
[36:30] whatever they enter it not for the
[36:33] benefit of other people but for their
[36:35] own benefit amen they enter a public
[36:37] office they're a public servant and yet
[36:38] they're the ones that are making out
[36:40] like a bandit but this was not so with
[36:43] the character of Nehemiah and why I read
[36:44] this scripture tonight we read this and
[36:46] we see that Nehemiah he was he was he
[36:49] was entitled to certain things based on
[36:51] his position but for for for because of
[36:53] the need and because of the things in
[36:55] his life he turns it down we know of
[36:57] course the second chapter Nehemiah he's
[36:59] spoken to the king he's got a letter
[37:00] from the King to go get timber for these
[37:02] building projects and the King gives it
[37:04] the Bible says because of the good hand
[37:06] of God that was upon Nehemiah and it's
[37:08] remarkable to me he's anybody has
[37:10] anybody here ever read uh the testimony
[37:12] of George Mueller anybody who George
[37:13] Mueller is okay maybe one or two but you
[37:16] really well I won't go there then
[37:18] you don't have to eat you know he was he
[37:21] was uh he was he was um famous for
[37:23] having an orphanage and he I don't
[37:24] remember the thousands of different
[37:25] orphans he raised but he was a man of
[37:27] faith and he took in these orphans and
[37:29] there'd be times he'd be praying for
[37:30] something that didn't have enough food
[37:31] to feed the people the the children that
[37:33] they had there for the day and he prayed
[37:35] the Lord would provide him with
[37:36] something and you know this farm would
[37:37] be going down the road and said hey I
[37:38] broke a wag uh an axle on my wagon and
[37:41] you know here's here's 50 pounds of this
[37:43] and uh 20 pounds of this and stuff and
[37:45] and God was just supernaturally provide
[37:47] for him and we see it through the Bible
[37:48] as well and through different
[37:49] testimonies of of different ones like
[37:51] Nehemiah that you know God has a way of
[37:54] making Provisions for people amen
[37:56] and even in this case we look at King
[37:58] archers Xerxes God can take a heathen a
[38:01] man that's not even a believer not even
[38:02] in Covenant with God and he'll make that
[38:04] person bless you with their substance
[38:06] because at the end of the day no matter
[38:08] what you're doing in this life it's hard
[38:09] to do it without money and then if you
[38:11] drove here tonight you had to pay gas to
[38:13] get here it pays it takes money to put
[38:15] these lights on it takes money to do
[38:17] just about anything unfortunately amen
[38:19] and the reason I'm saying this is that
[38:20] no matter what you're doing we we
[38:22] probably we all get bills we all know
[38:24] what I'm talking about tonight amen but
[38:26] when God wants to accomplish something
[38:28] in your life he has a way of moving
[38:30] provision around to the right place and
[38:33] then like he did with Nehemiah he he put
[38:35] He took this Heathen Kingdom this
[38:36] Heathen King but he used to rebuild the
[38:39] walls of Jerusalem and use it the Bless
[38:41] the people of God Amen so we understand
[38:44] God is able to provide like that but
[38:46] what I really want to look at tonight
[38:47] with our scripture is not just the idea
[38:50] of provision but there's a certain kind
[38:52] of provision that can only come through
[38:54] somebody making a sacrifice to give it
[38:57] to you amen
[38:58] we see in the book of Nehemiah the
[39:00] seventh chapter you don't have to turn
[39:01] there but but uh the Bible talks about
[39:03] how the tishatha says he gave The
[39:06] Treasure of a thousand drams of gold and
[39:07] 50 basins and 530 priests garments that
[39:11] Nehemiah of course is the tear shatha
[39:12] he's the governor he's giving of his own
[39:15] substance in this book and we see it
[39:16] time and time again and the reason I'm
[39:18] bringing this up tonight is Nehemiah is
[39:20] not required to offer his portion to the
[39:24] people but of his own free will because
[39:26] that the bondage because it was heavy on
[39:29] the people because they were in a great
[39:30] need he forfeits what he's entitled to
[39:33] in order to get help for the cause that
[39:37] lies before him why well I mentioned a
[39:39] few moments ago because he fears God
[39:41] because he cares about the people
[39:43] because he believes in the work that is
[39:45] taking place and so in order to make
[39:48] this provision for this work he's being
[39:50] caught on to make sacrifices in his life
[39:53] amen he's giving up what he's entitled
[39:56] to with no expectation of ever seeing it
[40:00] again in this life amen
[40:02] but if he was hoping it would be a help
[40:03] to the people his Hope was that God
[40:06] would remember the sacrifice that he was
[40:09] making
[40:10] so this wasn't something that made his
[40:12] life more comfortable amen it wasn't
[40:13] something to make his life were
[40:15] convenient he didn't enter politics just
[40:17] to make money or to benefit from it
[40:19] personally but he had to build a better
[40:21] future for his people he wanted to see
[40:23] the god of his father's glorified amen
[40:25] so when we talk about making a sacrifice
[40:28] tonight we're not just talking about
[40:29] making an investment because when you
[40:31] make an investment you're looking to get
[40:33] a return on what you invested but when
[40:35] we talk about a sacrifice sure you're
[40:37] laying down or giving up something with
[40:39] no expectation that you'll see the same
[40:41] thing or even possibly a reward in this
[40:44] life at all
[40:46] amen but he's giving it up for a cause
[40:49] and then as a minister and I'm just
[40:51] using myself as an example you know
[40:53] sometimes I have to sacrifice my time or
[40:56] things that I had planned for the
[40:57] ministry amen I've had to honor
[40:59] commitments I made can I just be real
[41:00] transparent for a moment tonight amen
[41:02] sometimes you you you get asked to go
[41:05] somewhere and you make a commitment you
[41:06] pray about it and then you get asked to
[41:07] go somewhere else in the natural man
[41:09] would say well maybe this place would be
[41:10] more beneficial than this place but you
[41:13] honor the commitment you made because
[41:14] you felt led to go there because you
[41:15] committed unto God because it's not a
[41:17] business it's a Ministry
[41:20] and so you make sacrifices and you you
[41:22] you you stay true to your word and
[41:24] sometimes you offend people even but why
[41:27] do you do it you're doing it because you
[41:29] believe that the cause is greater so you
[41:31] want to lay down things and listen it's
[41:33] not restricted tonight I'm not saying it
[41:34] for my own sake it's not restricted to
[41:36] the ministry each one of us here can
[41:39] probably be a witness that you made
[41:40] sacrifices in your life somewhere amen
[41:43] and why did I make the sacrifice to make
[41:45] because I Fear God because I care about
[41:47] the people of God and you've made
[41:49] sacrifices let's everyone here if
[41:51] they're any sort of an age at all you've
[41:53] made sacrifices in your life whether you
[41:54] realize it or not
[41:56] amen some people sacrifice their career
[41:58] for a family and some people sacrifice
[42:00] their family for a career
[42:03] amen if you go to college and you want
[42:06] to do well you got to sacrifice some of
[42:08] your time of of being friends and being
[42:10] social just studying to apply yourself
[42:12] and if you don't care about that you'll
[42:14] sacrifice your future uh career or
[42:16] whatever to go have a party and have a
[42:18] good time amen
[42:19] so no matter what you're doing you're
[42:21] making a sacrifice amen we looking we
[42:24] just had a we just observed Memorial Day
[42:26] this week listen men sacrifice their
[42:29] lives for you and I to be here tonight
[42:31] and have the Liberty to preach this
[42:34] gospel and to preach this message and to
[42:36] believe that men made sacrifices with no
[42:38] expert listen they didn't go and say
[42:39] well it's going to work out for me they
[42:41] were laying their lives down for the
[42:44] cause that they were fighting for for
[42:45] their generations to come for you and I
[42:48] tonight that made a sacrifice for the
[42:50] greater good
[42:51] amen so we tonight we are we are here
[42:54] because they've secured Liberties for us
[42:56] through their sacrifice amen
[42:59] listen if God has called you to do
[43:01] something you've got to make sacrifices
[43:03] sometimes let me just say this sometimes
[43:06] you say well listen well I can't do that
[43:07] I'm not able to make that sacrifice make
[43:10] no mistake you're still making a
[43:12] sacrifice
[43:13] and remember what you've done is you've
[43:14] sacrificed your relationship or you're
[43:17] standing with God for ease or for
[43:19] comfort
[43:20] so no matter what you're doing you're
[43:22] making a sacrifice amen
[43:24] The Book of Malachi talks about all
[43:26] these sacrifices the priests brought and
[43:28] they bring these sacrifices to God he
[43:30] said listen if you offer this to the
[43:33] governor if you offer this to your word
[43:34] your boss at work or your daddy he
[43:37] wouldn't want it and you think it's
[43:38] acceptable to me to offer the lame and
[43:41] the heart and the blind these sacrifices
[43:43] of these animals it's a stink in my
[43:45] nostrils he said
[43:47] amen we see with the Elijah and the
[43:49] prophets about listen the prophets of
[43:51] Baal made sacrifices hey they cut
[43:54] themselves and they worshiped and they
[43:55] did things but it was for the wrong
[43:57] purpose
[43:59] and we as Christians were called to make
[44:00] sacrifices sometimes we sacrifice our
[44:03] time our money even our happiness or our
[44:06] comfort because we are called the Bible
[44:08] says to present our bodies a Living
[44:11] Sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God
[44:14] which is our reasonable service
[44:17] amen we're called to make the Bible says
[44:20] spiritual sacrifice with the fruit of
[44:23] our lips giving Thanksgiving unto God
[44:24] Amen so no matter what you're doing
[44:26] we're making sacrifices and I hope I'm
[44:29] not I hope I'm not wearing that word out
[44:30] too much but this is what I'm talking
[44:31] about tonight amen
[44:33] so listen if we're gonna make a
[44:34] sacrifice what I'm saying tonight is we
[44:36] want to make the right kind of sacrifice
[44:38] if you're gonna make a sacrifice make it
[44:42] a meaningful one don't make it empty
[44:44] don't make it vain amen and listen if
[44:46] we're not prepared to make them it's
[44:48] only going to invite ruin into our own
[44:50] lives listen if we say we want to serve
[44:53] the Lord and we're going to set out
[44:54] Jesus said you make sure you count the
[44:56] cost first because it's gonna cost you
[44:58] something somewhere it might cost you a
[45:01] friend it might cost you a job it might
[45:03] cost you are you standing with your
[45:04] family whatever it is there is a cost
[45:07] associated with taking up your cross and
[45:10] following Jesus Christ amen so there's
[45:13] always a cost involved and if we're not
[45:14] ready for that we've invited we've
[45:16] invited ruin into our lives amen
[45:19] just like Kane
[45:21] in the butt listen Kane nabel both had
[45:23] sacrifices and Cain I I think about it
[45:26] sometimes King probably labored harder
[45:28] for his sacrifice but it wasn't by
[45:30] Revelation it wasn't what God wanted he
[45:32] could say look how hard it worked look
[45:34] what I've done but it was empty and
[45:37] Jesus said the same thing to the Jews he
[45:39] said listen in vain you worship me
[45:41] teaching for Doctrine you teach the com
[45:44] the the traditions of men and so the
[45:46] Commandments of God
[45:47] so if we're gonna make a sacrifice we
[45:49] don't want to be like Cain who made all
[45:51] of his work and his effort it was for
[45:53] nothing
[45:54] we look at the we look at King Saul in
[45:57] the Bible listen King Saul was told to
[45:59] go down and utterly Smite now I should
[46:01] have put it in here who it was I think
[46:02] it was the amalekite say man
[46:05] listen he was told to go uh is that word
[46:07] well praise the Lord you say well this
[46:09] is some preacher here amen
[46:11] should have put listen King songs he was
[46:13] called to to go and utterly Smite that
[46:15] nation and when he didn't do that amen
[46:18] the prophet Samuel comes and what does
[46:20] he really rebuke some and and I I love
[46:23] that well I don't love it I actually
[46:24] dislike but it's it's telling how he he
[46:27] justifies his behavior said listen I've
[46:30] collected all these goats and I
[46:31] collected all these sheep it's to be a
[46:33] sacrifice for God and Samuel said but
[46:36] listen it's better to obey than to
[46:39] sacrifice it doesn't do any good to
[46:41] sacrifice if you can't obey the Lord
[46:43] he's not looking just for you to say
[46:45] listen I gave this up for God and I gave
[46:47] that up are you obeying what he said
[46:50] if I do a lot and I cut up a hundred
[46:52] chickens and I cut their heads off and I
[46:54] burn them on a pie that doesn't mean
[46:55] anything to God
[46:57] amen so it's not what I want it's not my
[47:00] will or your will it's the will of the
[47:03] Lord
[47:04] amen
[47:05] praise the Lord
[47:07] so listen sacrifice to help you get this
[47:10] this what I'm trying to get at tonight
[47:11] our sacrifices are not optional because
[47:14] we're always going to be sacrificing
[47:15] something but what kind of sacrifice we
[47:18] offer it shows our priorities and it
[47:21] shows what kind of value we place in
[47:22] those priorities so there's no way
[47:24] around it we might as well make the
[47:25] right meaningful kind of choices amen
[47:27] and listen we are here tonight because
[47:30] like I said people have made sacrifices
[47:32] men and women have made sacrifices
[47:34] throughout the ages for us to be here
[47:36] but what greater sacrifice tonight do we
[47:39] have but what God give us when he
[47:41] offered us on Jesus Christ for us and
[47:43] offering for your sins and your
[47:46] trespasses amen listen we are not making
[47:48] sacrifices tonight to be found righteous
[47:51] we are making them because we have
[47:53] already been found righteous amen
[47:56] because of what God has done because
[47:58] he's made a way I mean we're not trying
[48:00] to attain some some sort of a
[48:02] righteousness tonight by our own ability
[48:05] but we do it because we have responded
[48:07] to what he's done for us
[48:10] so he's sitting he's trying to evaluate
[48:12] what your sacrifice looks like what did
[48:14] his look like
[48:15] amen
[48:17] praise the Lord
[48:19] he made a sacrifice for you and I
[48:21] tonight to be here listen not just for
[48:24] the world that we're in listen we are
[48:25] beneficiaries today of what he's done
[48:27] for us amen we are beneficiaries tonight
[48:30] of his power to heal the sick we're a
[48:33] beneficiary tonight of his power to
[48:35] raise the dead to make righteous not
[48:37] which is corrupted and dead and sins and
[48:40] trespasses we are beneficiary tonight of
[48:42] everything he paid for when he made the
[48:44] sacrifice of Calvary and tonight we
[48:46] don't have to wait we have received the
[48:49] earnest of our inheritance in our hearts
[48:51] by the Holy Ghost
[48:53] so if you've got the Holy Ghost tonight
[48:55] you've got a reason to Rejoice because
[48:57] the sacrifice was enough for you the
[48:59] sacrifice is enough for me what he paid
[49:01] for what he made a way for it's enough
[49:04] for us tonight
[49:05] and he didn't just sacrifice for this
[49:07] life that we're living now but for the
[49:09] world to come a greater world this is
[49:12] just the beginning we barely scratched
[49:15] the surface of what God's gonna do in
[49:18] the lives of his people he has gone to
[49:20] prepare a place for us that where you
[49:22] are he would be there also
[49:26] of this Earthly House of a tabernacle be
[49:29] destroyed we haven't house waiting
[49:33] that's been laid up and listen it's
[49:36] already paid for there's no lien there's
[49:39] no mortgage there's nothing you've got
[49:40] to do it's been paid for through the
[49:43] sacrifice that Jesus Christ made for you
[49:45] and I tonight
[49:46] so we talk about what he has paid for
[49:48] what he's paid for you're not supposed
[49:51] to pay for
[49:52] because sometimes people get this
[49:54] attitude they they approach the Lord and
[49:55] maybe let's say they're sick and body
[49:57] they come say well Lord I'll do this and
[49:59] I'll do that and if I do this will you
[50:01] heal me but listen he already said I did
[50:03] this with my stripes you're already
[50:06] healed
[50:07] so don't make the mistake tonight of
[50:09] trying to pay for something he's already
[50:12] paid for it and he's much more qualified
[50:15] to pay for it than you and I tonight
[50:17] so we all make sacrifices but God made a
[50:20] sacrifice
[50:22] God pay the price amen
[50:25] let me say this tonight he didn't just
[50:27] provide for it he made a sacrifice to
[50:30] pay for it you say well listen God owns
[50:32] the cattle in a thousand hills he he's
[50:34] making a place where the streets are
[50:36] made of gold it's not like God lacks for
[50:39] material amen
[50:41] listen money is no object to God Amen
[50:44] well praise the Lord listen if it's
[50:46] simply a matter of supply and demand
[50:48] well well can God can God provide this
[50:50] listen he can make Manna he can make
[50:52] Quail he can make anything he makes
[50:54] streets of gold he can multiply loads of
[50:55] fishes amen he can make squirrels from
[50:58] nothing it's not a problem
[51:01] listen if it was just a matter of what I
[51:02] can make another thin air our Federal
[51:04] Reserve does that that's why your
[51:06] dollars aren't worth anything anymore
[51:09] we're not pray if I'm getting political
[51:10] tonight
[51:11] hey man listen they print billions and
[51:13] trillions of dollars all the time they
[51:14] didn't bring it anymore they just type
[51:16] in a number well yeah we've got this
[51:18] much money out there that's why it's not
[51:20] worth anything
[51:21] if you just conjured up by itself
[51:23] there's no value attached to it but God
[51:26] isn't just Conjuring up things amen your
[51:28] salvation this future home this future
[51:32] world that you're going to live in a
[51:34] sacrifice was necessary
[51:37] listen there's some things that can't be
[51:39] paid unless a sacrifice is made because
[51:41] that attaches value to what is being
[51:43] offered
[51:45] I mean one thing I've got to send your
[51:46] sins are forgiven but that wasn't
[51:48] possible the price was too great
[51:51] the wages of sin was death somebody had
[51:54] to pay your price
[51:56] it's not enough to say God I'm sorry I
[51:58] didn't mean to do it will you forgive me
[52:00] but somebody still had to pay for every
[52:02] sin for every short coming for every
[52:05] wrong thought everything you've ever
[52:06] been through
[52:07] but somebody paid for it amen hallelujah
[52:10] unless it's paid for tonight it's paid
[52:12] for by the blood of the Lamb that was
[52:14] slanted Calvary and listen he didn't
[52:16] make a down payment he paid the whole
[52:19] thing if you paid the whole thing
[52:22] tonight you don't have to pay one minute
[52:25] oh Hallelujah
[52:28] so God has provided a sacrifice for the
[52:32] world to come amen it would be one thing
[52:35] if he was like some Heathen Idol or some
[52:36] Heathen god well you've got to make me
[52:38] sacrifices and you've got to do this and
[52:40] you've got to do that it's rules for me
[52:42] but not for thee it'd be one thing if
[52:44] God required us to make a sacrifice and
[52:46] he just sat on a cloud in heaven and he
[52:48] destroyed the Psalms and he was he was
[52:50] he was uh he was uh indifferent to the
[52:52] plight of man but God said I require
[52:54] sacrifice but I'm also willing to make a
[52:57] sacrifice I'm not going to require you
[52:59] to do something that I myself would be
[53:02] unwilling to do
[53:04] you hear me tonight God did not put you
[53:06] in we say listen what I've been through
[53:08] listen what I've given up look at my
[53:10] struggles look at what he gave up for
[53:12] you look at what he went to for you and
[53:14] I tonight we're not the only ones that
[53:17] have ever struggled our Lord come down
[53:20] from Glory he come from the ramparts of
[53:23] Glory he come from a multitude of angels
[53:25] he come from that place into this
[53:27] Dimension and he humbled himself and he
[53:30] suffered he became perfectly learned
[53:32] through obedience through the things he
[53:35] suffered and he humbled himself even
[53:37] unto death
[53:40] my my
[53:43] God's letting us know listen I've made
[53:45] sacrifices too
[53:46] when you sit there and you begin to feel
[53:48] sorry for yourself man I've lost this
[53:50] and I've given up that and I've gone
[53:52] through this remember he went through
[53:53] things too he is naughty he's not
[53:56] ignorant he is able to be touched with
[53:59] the feeling of our property he was
[54:01] tempted just like we were yet without
[54:04] sin
[54:05] it's not just you and I tonight well
[54:07] look what I've done for God look what
[54:09] he's done for you and I
[54:12] that's why we get discouraged we forget
[54:14] what it costs sometimes we don't really
[54:16] value it the way we ought to amen listen
[54:18] I know it costs a lot of you a lot to be
[54:20] here tonight a lot of you've given up a
[54:22] lot to be here and to serve the Lord and
[54:24] have a conscience void of offense before
[54:26] God but it cost him too
[54:29] he didn't just consign you to do he said
[54:31] I will also pay the price I will also
[54:34] lay my life down
[54:36] Hallelujah
[54:39] we all know the story of Abraham
[54:41] Abraham and Isaac God calls upon Abraham
[54:43] I want you to go and offer your son
[54:45] Isaac as a sacrifice and God is
[54:48] requiring the most precious thing he
[54:51] could require from Abraham
[54:53] hey man this is not just his offspring
[54:55] this is his miracle baby this is the
[54:58] heir of all things it was promised that
[55:00] God promised him this one specifics and
[55:03] I'll name him for you I'll tell you what
[55:05] he's gonna be like I'll tell you he's
[55:06] going to come according to the time of
[55:07] life God perfectly laid up this one and
[55:10] then God says that's the one I want
[55:12] I want the one that you put all your
[55:14] hopes and dreams in I want the one that
[55:15] you placed all you've invested yourself
[55:17] into
[55:19] amen
[55:21] it's in this desperate time Abraham's
[55:23] prepared amen unless in the Bible tells
[55:26] us Abraham encounter that God could
[55:28] raise it up because listen he said I'm
[55:30] gonna go up on the mountain I am the lad
[55:31] we're going to go up and we're gonna
[55:33] come back why because God didn't promise
[55:36] him another seed he said this one and
[55:40] Isaac shall I see be called
[55:43] God sent this one and not another one so
[55:45] when he goes up there to make that
[55:47] sacrifice he realizes God's gonna have
[55:50] to make a way for me because what God is
[55:52] requiring for me I am not able to give
[55:54] him
[55:55] hello help me out somebody you ever been
[55:58] there I've got I can't give you what you
[56:00] need that's why God says I will provide
[56:02] for me
[56:03] will provide a sacrifice listen there's
[56:06] times you get in your website I don't
[56:07] know how I'm going to make it through
[56:08] you're going to make it through because
[56:10] he already made it through for you
[56:12] God can do things he can provide things
[56:15] you can't provide for yourself amen
[56:18] and as he begins to do that God says
[56:19] listen I shall provide I love this he
[56:22] says I shall provide for myself
[56:25] I'm the one that required it but I'm the
[56:27] one that's gonna pay it I shall provide
[56:30] for myself and sacrifice
[56:34] amen
[56:36] amen listen God has already made his
[56:37] Covenant with Abraham he said I swore by
[56:41] himself then in Abraham I would bless
[56:43] the Nations and then God said listen I
[56:46] already promised to take care of it I
[56:48] can't put that back on him now I already
[56:51] promised it I already made a commitment
[56:53] now it's up to me to make the sacrifice
[56:55] amen
[56:57] so he has made promises to Abraham of
[56:59] his own will and now he's going to keep
[57:01] his word amen
[57:02] in other words I require a sacrifice
[57:04] like this one but you don't have what it
[57:07] takes to pay it so I'm gonna pay it
[57:10] amen
[57:12] the Bible says in Abraham called the
[57:14] name of the Lord Jehovah Jireh as it is
[57:18] said to this day in the Mount of the
[57:20] Lord it shall be seen and I like that he
[57:23] sees it amen we talk about Jehovah Jireh
[57:26] and we talk about you know it means the
[57:27] Lord provides it actually has a compound
[57:29] meaning it's more than just how he
[57:31] provides he does provide we believe that
[57:34] tonight but this word Jehovah Jireh
[57:36] means that he sees it as well in other
[57:38] words he sees the need and then he sees
[57:40] two the need
[57:42] amen he's not ignorant of it and you
[57:44] walk up to the man I didn't see that
[57:45] coming he saw the need before you
[57:48] encountered the need and he made a way
[57:50] for you and he paid for that before you
[57:52] even got there
[57:53] so God who's required it is willing to
[57:56] pay it himself
[57:57] he's not some Buddha up on a mountain
[57:59] telling you well this is how you're
[58:01] going to overcome he said I will show
[58:03] you I will lay down my life so you know
[58:06] how to overcome amen
[58:08] listen that realm and thinking that was
[58:10] just a ram and a ticket but what was he
[58:12] telling Abraham I'm gonna provide a
[58:15] sacrifice I'm gonna send a lamb one day
[58:17] he'll be caught in his humanity and that
[58:20] Lamb of God he will pay the price he'll
[58:22] make the sacrifice
[58:25] listen brother Ben said he had a choice
[58:29] he had a choice he could have lived a
[58:32] normal life he could have went and had a
[58:34] family he could have did whatever he
[58:35] wanted but he saw the value and what he
[58:38] was going to pay for he despised the
[58:40] cross he endured the shame for the joy
[58:43] that was set before him listen that Joy
[58:46] wasn't just set before him at Calvary it
[58:48] was set before the foundation of the
[58:50] world that's why when he prayed for you
[58:52] he said father I pray that they would
[58:54] share the glory that I had with you in
[58:56] the beginning
[58:57] listen any sorrow you come from he knew
[58:59] where you were going that's why he paid
[59:01] the price
[59:03] he didn't just go and put money on a
[59:05] desk or write a check out he laid down
[59:08] his life because of you you were the joy
[59:13] that set before him
[59:16] amen
[59:17] you're the one he saw your need and he
[59:20] saw to it
[59:23] amen for God to provide a sacrifice like
[59:26] I said a moment ago he said I'll provide
[59:28] for myself to provide for Abraham was to
[59:31] provide for himself
[59:33] because he was in come with Abraham amen
[59:35] listen when God tonight when he has
[59:37] provided for you he's provided for
[59:39] himself your bone of his bone your
[59:42] flatulous flesh your spirit of his
[59:44] Spirit your power is power let me say
[59:46] this way without this bride she is him
[59:49] listen the Bible says no man ever hated
[59:52] his own flesh but he nourishes it and he
[59:55] challenges it so should a husband lay
[59:58] down his life he should he shouldn't he
[1:00:00] should he should cherish his wife amen
[1:00:03] how does a husband care biblically
[1:00:05] speaking how does the husband care for
[1:00:07] his wife it's not just by Senator Macy's
[1:00:10] or letting it on Amazon he lays down his
[1:00:13] life for his family he makes sacrifices
[1:00:16] to make sure they're taken care of and
[1:00:18] God made a sacrifice for you because
[1:00:20] you're his bride
[1:00:22] he didn't choose him he chose you and he
[1:00:24] took that Veil and he placed it on his
[1:00:26] shoulder and said you're my
[1:00:28] responsibility now
[1:00:30] I will pay the price for you
[1:00:33] amen
[1:00:35] Paul says he nourishes a man nourishes
[1:00:37] his own flesh he cherishes it even as
[1:00:40] the Lord does the church
[1:00:44] amen
[1:00:46] praise the Lord let me say it this way
[1:00:48] tonight his our need that is his need
[1:00:50] say does God need anything God in you
[1:00:52] does
[1:00:53] brother you need things amen listen when
[1:00:56] God was going to go wipe out Sam Gamora
[1:00:58] he says shall I hide from Abraham the
[1:01:00] thing I'm gonna do listen Abraham I'm
[1:01:02] gonna go down to these cities I'm going
[1:01:03] to wipe him out and amen says listen
[1:01:05] I've got a need down there I've got a
[1:01:07] I've got a man by the name a lot I got
[1:01:08] family down there
[1:01:09] till this time I'm gonna see God if
[1:01:11] there's 50 or Isis will you spam yeah
[1:01:13] I'll spare him for your sake
[1:01:15] listen he wasn't spamming for their own
[1:01:17] sake he did it because God would not
[1:01:19] judge the righteous with the unrighteous
[1:01:21] and even when he can't find ten
[1:01:24] righteous God sends two angels and he
[1:01:27] pulls lot out of Sodom why because
[1:01:29] Abraham's need is God's need
[1:01:32] your knee tonight it is God's need
[1:01:35] and listen if you would take care of
[1:01:37] yourself if you want to nourish your own
[1:01:39] flesh how much more
[1:01:42] don't tell me God's not a provider's
[1:01:44] name he's still a provider he's still
[1:01:46] Jehovah Jireh he still does the things
[1:01:48] he said he would do he still makes a way
[1:01:50] when there is no way
[1:01:52] hey man
[1:01:53] friends there's a lot of things that you
[1:01:55] and I we could sacrifice and devote Our
[1:01:57] Lives to and give up things for amen
[1:02:01] but there's only one thing that God made
[1:02:03] a sacrifice for
[1:02:05] you and I
[1:02:06] if he was willing to make that for us
[1:02:08] how can you and I not give everything to
[1:02:10] him

[1:02:14] proved it amen this future home this

[1:02:44] was talking about how will I know the
[1:02:46] message of the hour God proves what he

[1:08:33] brother Bosworth he challenged him on
[1:08:34] the idea that God is still a Healer God
[1:08:36] doesn't do those things anymore he's
[1:08:37] he's different and and brother Bosworth
[1:08:40] gets up there and listen this was this
[1:08:42] was a smart man he knew the Bible he
[1:08:44] understood Divine Healing and brothers
[1:08:46] he just did one little thing that was
[1:08:47] too much for Dr best to handle he goes
[1:08:50] up there and he asks him the question he
[1:08:51] said I've got one question for you he
[1:08:53] says to the seven Redemptive names of
[1:08:55] Jehovah pertain to Jesus
[1:08:58] amen because if they don't then he's a
[1:09:00] different person it's some different God
[1:09:01] but if he's the same God then he does
[1:09:04] the same things if he was Jehovah Rapha
[1:09:06] then he's Jehovah Rapha now it was
[1:09:09] Jehovah Jireh then and he's Jesus today
[1:09:11] he's still Jehovah Jireh today amen
[1:09:14] if he was Jehovah Jireh before he's
[1:09:17] still Jehovah Jireh and I want you to
[1:09:19] think about this because here's Dr best
[1:09:20] this is an educated man he's got
[1:09:22] Seminary teaching he's got degrees he's
[1:09:25] educated he knows all this stuff but
[1:09:27] that man was all of his seminar
[1:09:29] experience and his timely Pulpit
[1:09:31] couldn't answer one question
[1:09:33] he couldn't answer it because he knew
[1:09:35] the answer would condemn him
[1:09:37] let me say this the answer might condemn
[1:09:39] him but it don't condemn me that's what
[1:09:42] saves me
[1:09:43] that name was everything he learned and
[1:09:45] everything he understood he couldn't
[1:09:47] answer the question it's just like when
[1:09:49] the chief priests and the scribes and
[1:09:51] the elders they questioned Jesus he said
[1:09:53] let me ask you a question John's baptism
[1:09:55] was it from God or was it from Men
[1:09:59] let's sat there man how are we going to
[1:10:01] answer that if we say it was for men
[1:10:03] amen but the people who are John's a
[1:10:06] prophet man they'll take up arms against
[1:10:08] us they all know he was sent by God and
[1:10:10] if John's baptisms from God
[1:10:13] then they'll say why didn't you believe
[1:10:14] him
[1:10:17] I may ask you about the ministry of this
[1:10:19] day this this Elijah that we had was it
[1:10:22] a man or God it was man then how did it
[1:10:24] do the things that City would do and if
[1:10:26] it's a God why didn't you believe him
[1:10:30] so he's educated scholarly men these
[1:10:33] scribes in Paris he's just like Dr best
[1:10:35] said well listen I'm going to sit here
[1:10:36] and make fun I'll crucify you but I
[1:10:38] can't answer the question because the
[1:10:40] answer condemns me no matter what
[1:10:43] we cannot answer and Jesus said well I'm
[1:10:45] not going to answer you either
[1:10:47] praise the Lord somebody
[1:10:49] listen friends don't you ever have a
[1:10:51] life where you can't answer that
[1:10:52] question because it'll condemn you like
[1:10:54] it did them amen but praise God
[1:10:56] hallelujah I love it because that man he
[1:10:59] couldn't answer that question that
[1:11:01] scholarly preacher he was afraid to face
[1:11:03] the answer but you've got a little poor
[1:11:05] woman by the name of Hattie Wright and
[1:11:07] then she never never was educated in a
[1:11:09] seminar not some big Theologian just a
[1:11:12] simple woman about as poor as could be
[1:11:14] amen but when brother Branham when the
[1:11:16] lord gave brother Ram them squirrels out
[1:11:17] there in the woods listen he couldn't
[1:11:19] explain the science behind it he
[1:11:21] couldn't explain the materials and how
[1:11:22] it all come together he knew it was a
[1:11:24] bit it wasn't a vision he knew that much
[1:11:26] amen but he didn't even know how they
[1:11:28] got there
[1:11:29] he thought about that story and he began
[1:11:31] to think about that Ram that Abraham saw
[1:11:33] him to think and he thought about that
[1:11:34] very same thing he said well all I can
[1:11:36] say is he's still Jehovah Jireh and that
[1:11:40] little woman she didn't argue she didn't
[1:11:42] fuss she didn't try to explain it she
[1:11:44] said brother Branham that's nothing but
[1:11:46] the truth
[1:11:47] and when she said that Hallelujah she
[1:11:50] said the right thing and then sometimes
[1:11:52] you just got to say Amen to the word of
[1:11:54] God quit trying to explain it quit
[1:11:56] trying to educate yourself India just
[1:11:58] take the word believe the word and say
[1:12:00] Amen
[1:12:01] I don't believe he sold Jehovah Jireh
[1:12:03] and the bride says amen
[1:12:06] I believe he's still a Healer today and
[1:12:08] we say amen I don't know how he does it
[1:12:11] but I know that he does it I know he
[1:12:13] paid for it and the same God that
[1:12:15] changed my life the same girl that
[1:12:16] changed your life he's the same God that
[1:12:18] does he sing tonight
[1:12:20] we say Amen listen you got something
[1:12:23] better than the Seminary experience
[1:12:25] you got something better than Dr mascot
[1:12:27] you've got the earnest
[1:12:30] Hallelujah
[1:12:33] that's nothing but the truth that's what
[1:12:36] it takes tonight not trying to argue or
[1:12:39] disprove she believed in the benefactor
[1:12:42] so she became a beneficiary
[1:12:44] When You Believe in the benefactor that
[1:12:46] makes you a beneficiary hey man how many
[1:12:49] beneficiaries we got here tonight when
[1:12:51] you believe the testimony of Jesus
[1:12:53] Christ you overcome by the blood of the
[1:12:55] lamb and the word of your testimony
[1:12:56] because his testimony becomes your
[1:12:59] testimony you didn't bring yourself here
[1:13:01] tonight you didn't do this on your own
[1:13:03] you're a beneficiary of the of the
[1:13:06] finished work of Calvary tonight
[1:13:09] Hallelujah
[1:13:11] he's still a provider tonight
[1:13:14] because the sacrifice that he painted
[1:13:16] Calvary is even enough today

[1:13:23] he's still Jehovah Rapha in 2023 he's
[1:13:26] still Jehovah in 2023 we are his
[1:13:29] beneficiaries because he laid it up for
[1:13:32] us

[1:13:37] amen he didn't just pay for our
[1:13:39] Redemption he sacrificed
[1:13:41] forward amen
[1:13:43] we look at the scripture I talked about
[1:13:44] in the beginning
[1:13:45] Nehemiah was a benefactor of the work
[1:13:48] there in Jerusalem and he entreats the
[1:13:50] god I read that 19th verse he treats the
[1:13:53] Lord he says think upon me God
[1:13:55] for the good that I've done
[1:13:57] for these people
[1:14:01] like I said here a while back we just
[1:14:02] had a memorial day this week and
[1:14:05] we remember
[1:14:07] the sacrifices
[1:14:09] that people made we we take time to
[1:14:11] observe what they did you take a certain
[1:14:13] man or you take a philanthropist and
[1:14:15] they they donate money to build a
[1:14:17] hospital or or some cause they'll make a
[1:14:19] memorial form in honor of their
[1:14:21] sacrifice so they'll get them a plaque
[1:14:23] or a tile or something to make him a
[1:14:25] statue if it was a lot of money I don't

[1:14:51] and there's Thomas he says he says
[1:14:54] Thomas said I won't believe except I can
[1:14:55] thrust my hand and decide and feel the
[1:14:58] scars where he's at and Jesus he comes
[1:15:00] and he appears to Thomas and it appears
[1:15:02] to the disciples he says reach hither
[1:15:03] thy finger and behold my hands reach
[1:15:06] hither thy hand and thrust into my side
[1:15:08] be not faithless but believing

[1:15:47] he could have nail pierced hands he
[1:15:49] could try to look like Jesus and that
[1:15:51] would just be a man doing it he's not
[1:15:52] identified that way today he's
[1:15:55] identified right now by his word and his
[1:15:58] spirit amen
[1:16:00] they've been record from Heaven who he
[1:16:01] is but in a greater world the benefactor
[1:16:04] of that world the one that paid for it
[1:16:06] amen

[1:16:10] don't know how you feel about it tonight

[1:16:12] believe the Bible and what the prophet
[1:16:13] says about it amen listen when you and I

[1:16:25] to be there each and every one of us
[1:16:27] that's resurrected in that lightness
[1:16:29] there's not gonna be one spot or blemish
[1:16:31] not one burn mark But the rim says it'll
[1:16:32] be perfect you're not gonna be chopping
[1:16:34] pieces or whatever there's a picture
[1:16:35] that's on file amen this negative of
[1:16:39] what you look like it wasn't just taken
[1:16:41] at your best when you were 18 or 20 or
[1:16:43] 22 it was taken before the world began
[1:16:47] there's a picture on file and listen
[1:16:49] when you come up in the resurrection
[1:16:50] there's not going to be one indicator
[1:16:53] physically in your body of what you went
[1:16:55] through in this life
[1:17:00] hey man no wrinkled hands
[1:17:02] no broke down tissues but the best
[1:17:04] that's all the mark of the Fall
[1:17:06] another man sitting the resurrection one
[1:17:08] mark of sin
[1:17:11] and yet here is Christ's scarred
[1:17:15] amen

[1:17:20] he Bears it in his own body
[1:17:23] this Memorial
[1:17:25] hey man when you look at him you'll be
[1:17:27] like that was the price
[1:17:29] that was a pain I can still look at it
[1:17:31] even in the new heavens
[1:17:32] and a new Earth
[1:17:34] there's those scars that held him to the
[1:17:37] Cross there's the stripes that bore my
[1:17:40] healing in them
[1:17:41] it's all been paid for it can never be
[1:17:44] forgotten amen
[1:17:46] I heard a man say one time the scars
[1:17:48] that Jesus has they're the only man-made
[1:17:50] thing in heaven
[1:17:52] and everything else that God made but
[1:17:54] there's one thing there that man made
[1:17:55] the scars
[1:17:57] on Jesus body
[1:17:59] hey man
[1:18:01] you know brother Ben tells the story
[1:18:03] about Fanny Crosby some some secular
[1:18:05] music producers they come to her one
[1:18:06] time of course she was blind and they
[1:18:09] asked her to write these worldly songs
[1:18:11] she refused
[1:18:13] he said God called me to write songs for
[1:18:15] him now listen she could have made money
[1:18:18] she could have been even more famous but
[1:18:20] she she Sanctified that gift to God she
[1:18:22] sacrificed her own advancement she
[1:18:24] sacrificed what she could have done in
[1:18:26] this world he said God called me to
[1:18:28] write songs for him and then infidels
[1:18:30] they mocked her and they made fun of her
[1:18:33] and said listen you're blind you've
[1:18:34] never seen him before when you get to
[1:18:36] heaven how are you even gonna recognize
[1:18:38] him well first of all they were ignorant
[1:18:39] she's not gonna be blind there
[1:18:41] are you gonna recognize him how you
[1:18:43] gonna know you say you believe in this
[1:18:45] Jesus he did all these things for you
[1:18:46] how are you going to recognize him and
[1:18:48] she began to write that song she said I
[1:18:50] shall know him I shall know him and
[1:18:53] Redeemed by his side I shall stand I
[1:18:56] shall know him I shall know him
[1:18:59] by the prince of the nails
[1:19:01] in his hands
[1:19:05] I think every day should be Memorial Day
[1:19:07] for us
[1:19:08] to our Lord Jesus Christ when we take
[1:19:10] the communion we we drink the wine we
[1:19:13] break the bread we do it in remembrance
[1:19:15] of him it's a memorial unto him
[1:19:18] the only Memorial we're gonna have there
[1:19:20] the memorial what he did for us the
[1:19:22] greatest Memorial that's ever been there
[1:19:24] might not be one in this world
[1:19:26] and the one to come it's the greatest
[1:19:27] Memorial
[1:19:28] amen
[1:19:30] listen
[1:19:32] sometimes like Fanny Crosby we have to
[1:19:34] choose a hard path
[1:19:35] brother Brandon chose a hard path but
[1:19:37] you know what that's why there's a great
[1:19:39] reward waiting for him
[1:19:41] hey man listen we we are gifted many
[1:19:43] things by his sacrifice but when we make
[1:19:45] sacrifices there's a reward for your
[1:19:47] service like Nehemiah was gonna have
[1:19:50] Fanny Crosby she made sacrifices but
[1:19:53] there's a crown that's waiting for her
[1:19:54] because she she did not suck her she did
[1:19:57] not sell out her gift that God gave her
[1:19:59] to the world Amen and all I want you to
[1:20:01] understand tonight brother Bram chose a
[1:20:03] hard path and sometimes you and I we
[1:20:04] choose a hard path but I want you to
[1:20:07] remember tonight your sacrifice is never
[1:20:10] in vain
[1:20:11] the Bible says he's not forgetful
[1:20:14] of your labor of love you believe that
[1:20:16] tonight amen it's not in Maine because
[1:20:18] he made a sacrifice for you and I amen
[1:20:21] he made a sacrifice that one day we
[1:20:23] could sit at a table and he would wipe
[1:20:25] away every tear from our eyes and he
[1:20:26] would tell us well done
[1:20:30] you fought battles you went through
[1:20:33] things you paid prices you made
[1:20:36] sacrifices but I'm gonna reward you
[1:20:39] well done
[1:20:41] I made a sacrifice but you made one and
[1:20:44] I'll remember yours too
[1:20:47] well done
[1:20:50] good and faithful servant
[1:20:52] hey man when he when he made a sacrifice
[1:20:55] for the joy you tonight it was worth it
[1:20:57] to him
[1:20:59] and he didn't get bamboozled you were
[1:21:01] worth the sacrifice to him amen when you
[1:21:04] when you give up something for the cause
[1:21:06] of Christ would you will delay something
[1:21:07] it's worth it every time don't forget
[1:21:10] tonight it's always worth it to give it
[1:21:13] unto God
[1:21:15] amen
[1:21:16] isn't he wonderful friends we listen
[1:21:18] tonight we can have the same kind of
[1:21:20] confidence that Nehemiah had God will
[1:21:24] remember us as well
[1:21:26] maybe tonight
[1:21:27] God's calling some of us to maybe even
[1:21:29] make some sort of a sacrifice tonight
[1:21:31] maybe at our job or a family situation
[1:21:33] whatever it is he's always worth it
[1:21:35] friends
[1:21:37] hey man perhaps this year you'll have to
[1:21:39] make a sacrifice he never had to make
[1:21:41] before
[1:21:42] hey man but let me Testify the same God
[1:21:45] that was faithful to Abraham he's
[1:21:47] faithful to you and I he's a rewarder do
[1:21:49] you believe that tonight
[1:21:50] you know the Bible says in Hebrews 11 6
[1:21:52] without faith it is impossible to please
[1:21:55] God for he that comes to God must
[1:21:57] believe that he is
[1:21:59] and we forget about the second part I
[1:22:01] think a lot and he's a rewarder of them
[1:22:04] that diligently seek him
[1:22:07] and let's not just say well I believe
[1:22:09] that he is he wants you to have the same
[1:22:11] faith that he is a rewarder
[1:22:14] now listen it's it's always been
[1:22:16] interesting to me because it's like well
[1:22:18] God doesn't have to do it that way but
[1:22:20] God chose to do it that way
[1:22:21] God wants to reward you
[1:22:24] amen not not reward you salvation or
[1:22:27] something like that he paid for that but
[1:22:28] he went he wants to reward you when you
[1:22:30] make the right choice when you honor him
[1:22:32] and you obey him amen he wants listen
[1:22:35] it's his idea he wants to do it I think
[1:22:38] we act like we're robbing god well
[1:22:40] listen I don't you know I don't want to
[1:22:41] do this and this and that and stuff and
[1:22:43] I don't expect anything listen you
[1:22:44] should expect it on the pretense that
[1:22:46] God is a rewarder he wants us to think
[1:22:49] listen he's not well this is politically
[1:22:52] correct I guess it's not some sort of an
[1:22:54] Indian giver or something or he's
[1:22:56] faithful he wants us to believe that
[1:22:58] he's a rewarder amen of them listen how
[1:23:01] many believes that please leave that for
[1:23:03] your own life listen we're not here
[1:23:05] tonight to build hay and wooden stubble
[1:23:07] we we've built our lives up on this word
[1:23:10] of God with gold and silver and precious
[1:23:13] stones why because there's a reward in
[1:23:16] it he wants that listen he wants it for
[1:23:18] you that's why that's why God Brother
[1:23:21] Brad at one point in his life said why
[1:23:23] do I have to push you into everything
[1:23:25] where's your reward
[1:23:28] is that all right
[1:23:30] listen he wants to give you
[1:23:31] beneficiaries of what he's paid for but
[1:23:34] he also wants you to prove the same
[1:23:36] character in your life
[1:23:38] I mean sometimes you're gonna make a
[1:23:39] sacrifice for your family
[1:23:42] for your church for peace whatever it is
[1:23:44] amen
[1:23:45] when you take God's way it's not an easy
[1:23:47] it's the hard way
[1:23:49] listen if it was easy everybody would do
[1:23:51] it
[1:23:52] but we do type because we believe that
[1:23:54] the price
[1:23:56] is outweighed by the benefit
[1:23:59] Nehemiah could have lived an opulent
[1:24:01] Life as a governor he could have had all
[1:24:03] this money but he said you know what I'm
[1:24:04] going to give that up
[1:24:06] for the cause of God
[1:24:08] for God's people
[1:24:10] you believe that tonight let's stand to
