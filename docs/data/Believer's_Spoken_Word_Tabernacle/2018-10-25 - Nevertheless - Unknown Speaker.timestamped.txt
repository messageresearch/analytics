[30:27] didn't still have the same issues that
[30:28] we have now so there's got to be more
[30:31] than just a body change but a body
[30:32] change whereby that we come back to
[30:35] really what God had in mind for us
[30:37] everything will be perfect amen not only

[30:44] everybody
[30:44] oh my personalities and everything else
[30:49] will just so come together in such a
[30:51] harmony I'm glad that's what the love of
[30:54] God is doing right now in our lives and
[30:58] I just think about we're singing this
[30:59] course right here retrieve brother
[31:01] Timothy today and we're on their way
[31:04] back and brother Timothy was just
[31:05] looking around the fields he's looking
[31:06] around the corn and Tim's they said man
[31:09] he said you know just the amount he said
[31:11] of corn that you have here and he's
[31:12] looking all the crops and I just got to
[31:15] think and I was looking at some of those
[31:16] combines as it was in the field and
[31:17] shooting out and something just struck
[31:19] me you know it I said you know here was
[31:22] somebody that planted that seed and the
[31:23] power within that seed let it up through
[31:26] all of those different stages and now I
[31:28] said here comes another power to move
[31:30] upon it and bring it into a place of
[31:32] harvest of where it needs to be it's God
[31:35] himself the whole time he who planted
[31:38] our life he who's maturing our life onto
[31:41] a full stature and then finally he says
[31:43] it's time to come home isn't that
[31:46] wonderful he knows exactly when to send
[31:49] the combine right by and so I believe
[31:52] we're living in the time of the right
[31:55] I believe that with all my heart water
[31:58] glorious expectation amen that's broken
[32:01] our hearts amen you know you heard the
[32:06] statement my wife had made mentioned to
[32:08] me while I was away
[32:10] regarding with sister Mary Ferguson and
[32:12] some of you know her no doubt many of
[32:15] you knew her and you know her and you
[32:17] also knew brother Karl and I just can't
[32:19] help but think about it I we don't know
[32:21] when her crossing will be but to think
[32:24] about it brother n tells us God sends
[32:26] our loved ones down to meet us she's not
[32:28] only gonna meet the love of her life
[32:30] she's gonna meet the love of her life
[32:32] amen the Lord Jesus Christ it's been the
[32:35] love of her life and also brother Karl
[32:37] she's gonna be united back together
[32:40] again amen
[32:42] certainly we will miss you know our
[32:44] sister on on this side no doubt brother
[32:46] Randy and then they'll miss they'll miss
[32:47] her the Saints over there but you know
[32:50] we know soon and very soon we're gonna
[32:53] be seeing them again amen
[32:55] I'm so glad that we don't sorrow as
[32:57] others we sorrow we grieve we missed the
[33:00] presence of one another but we're not
[33:02] sorrowing without hope we know we shall
[33:05] meet again amen so we just want to
[33:09] invite brother Timothy as shown in where
[33:11] the Timothy has been a few years since
[33:13] brother Timothy had been here and of
[33:15] course it's been a lot less time that
[33:17] he's since his last time since I was in
[33:20] Ghana and he reminded me of that today
[33:22] so we just want to invite brother
[33:25] Timothy shown and ask that you just the
[33:27] Lord I just just take our brother and
[33:29] you see also I want you to keep in
[33:31] prayer brother Giovanna Prakash he had
[33:34] sent Pat he asked me to greet you and to
[33:37] thank you for the offering that was sent
[33:40] his way by God's grace we were able to
[33:43] send I think was close to 2500 dollars
[33:45] in support there of everything with
[33:48] brother brother gia von / cash and you
[33:52] some of you don't know this but brother
[33:53] Giovanni he had come here he's come here
[33:56] year after year but over the past few
[33:58] years he had taken and applied for a
[34:01] green card and when he applied for a
[34:03] green card the reason he did it is
[34:04] because
[34:06] or maybe it was a visa green card or
[34:08] visa one of those my mind freaked me it
[34:10] just gets all scrupled with that but he
[34:13] every time when he was going through
[34:14] customs he said I just he said of just
[34:16] like harassment every time and he said
[34:18] brother Samuel he said I don't need to
[34:20] tell you what kind of people those
[34:21] people are in those places like that and
[34:25] he said you know he said it's just not
[34:27] he said something he said that I went to
[34:29] do to be able to try to obtain that but
[34:32] he says Here I am waiting and I'm
[34:34] waiting and I'm waiting on it he and he
[34:36] was when he was here with us we were
[34:38] sitting around the fire than one night
[34:40] and he said his heart each time he
[34:42] talked about it he just he just wept he
[34:44] said I feel like I'm trapped and he said
[34:46] would you pray with me said God will
[34:48] make a way back for me to get back home
[34:50] so with in the meantime with him he left
[34:52] here on October 25th and he's went back
[34:55] to India and right now who knows if
[34:58] he'll ever gain and be able to have
[35:00] entry back into the states again because
[35:03] with that since that process was
[35:04] lingering him leaving like that he
[35:06] forfeited it so let's just pray for our
[35:09] brother and let's pray for him he is his
[35:12] whole heart he said I don't want to stay
[35:13] here he said my heart is back in India I
[35:16] want to be there on the ground and
[35:17] working and and so let's just would you
[35:20] pray for brother Giovanni you know I
[35:21] know you've kept him in prayer before
[35:23] but please keep him in prayer and God
[35:25] knows the Lord knows how to supply all
[35:28] of our needs when you have situations
[35:30] like that you wonder and say well that
[35:31] just seems impossible but remember we
[35:33] serve of God of impossibilities so God
[35:36] knows and we just want to pray that God
[35:38] would just God brother giovanna's he's
[35:40] over there in order just be with him in
[35:42] a very special way amen and the work
[35:45] that's going on there as brother Timothy
[35:47] comes brother Timothy as he comes to us

[36:00] the Togo in the different places that
[36:02] around burkina faso all of the
[36:04] difference in rounding countries and
[36:05] right now brother brother Timothy was
[36:07] shared with me because of such the
[36:09] increase that is happening in Ghana he
[36:11] said it's like the Philippines he said
[36:13] it's just so hard where do we begin it's
[36:15] just hard keeping up with everything and
[36:17] you know within the midst of it we also
[36:20] want to pray for our brother and all of
[36:22] the brothers who are there that God will
[36:23] just continue to richly just direct them

[42:49] scriptures and the message that has been
[42:52] given to us ii sandwich of the 5
[43:03] let's read verse six and seven and the
[43:15] King and his men went to Jerusalem unto
[43:24] the Jebusites
[43:26] the habitants of the land which spake
[43:33] unto David saying except now take away
[43:38] the blind and the lame
[43:42] - I know cam in either Eden thinking
[43:49] David cannot come in either nevertheless
[43:55] David took the stronghold of Zion the
[43:59] same is the City of David may the Lord
[44:04] bless the reading of his word shall
[44:07] please be seated
[44:10] so as the scripture admonishes us to do
[44:16] to keep encouraging our search as Peter
[44:21] said as long as I am in this flesh I
[44:27] wish to stir up your pure Minds and the
[44:31] Bible says let us hold fast hold it fast
[44:38] the face that we are fed so that it will
[44:43] not slip out of our hands
[44:45] so not that we don't know but we are
[44:50] reminding ourselves because Jesus Christ
[44:56] is the same yesterday today and forever
[45:01] the unchangeable God with unchanging
[45:05] ways Alleluia and so just be God

[45:38] yeah maybe some issues or problems or
[45:42] challenges and I said never nevertheless
[45:47] or maybe this agreement somewhere but

[45:53] but nevertheless nonetheless despite
[46:07] despite yeah despite all that all that
[46:14] was said odd rhythmically all these
[46:20] coffins nevertheless though there was
[46:28] issue no no it was a challenge
[46:33] nevertheless he just like when Elijah
[46:42] was to leave a lecture and he said ask
[46:47] what you win what do you want me to do
[46:49] for you and then Elijah said I want
[46:53] double portion of your spirit like I
[46:57] said you have acts something that is had
[47:02] Nevada less so when there is an issue
[47:10] there's a problem there's a challenge

[47:18] nonetheless nonetheless a you are never
[47:22] delicious
[47:25] nonetheless you are not Elise you can
[47:30] make it hallelujah
[47:37] and so we thank God for the main that we
[47:44] read about and the screeches have told
[47:48] us this things are written for our
[47:51] example for our lineage and the
[47:56] scripture also made us to know will we
[48:00] hear about David and we hear about
[48:03] Elijah and we hear about Abraham and
[48:08] women like Sarah and like Ruth and the
[48:12] SS in the scriptures and the knowledge
[48:15] they were people of like passion as we
[48:22] are they were not a Jewish there were
[48:29] people of like passions people of
[48:34] challenges people of Phyllis people of
[48:39] witnesses just as we are nevertheless
[48:51] they were just like us you talk about
[48:58] Elijah was a man like us Abraham was a
[49:03] man like us oh those that are written in
[49:08] the scriptures there were men and women
[49:11] like us nevertheless resolute
[49:26] they had the service but that has
[49:32] nothing to do with what God has done for
[49:37] me that he foreknew in predestination
[49:41] and as we have been touched and though
[49:46] that he previously that he called and
[49:49] though that is God he justified and not
[49:54] only does before he gratified he did
[49:59] that for them and he has done the same
[50:01] thing for us mean of like passions oh
[50:16] praise the Lord you talk about our
[50:21] father Abraham I will love him with
[50:24] Franco so much for him yet he was a my
[50:27] luggage he has his fears in his worries

[50:51] your husband just telling that I am your
[50:55] brother he said it was Jerry that they

[51:14] promise of God
[51:15] [Applause]
[51:21] God and that took for him God routes it
[51:29] is settled
[51:33] the accuser might have turned to accuse
[51:36] him but God change the password so
[51:44] certain had no assets again resolute the

[52:05] can assess us and you do this and you do
[52:07] that and do this and push in there but

[52:58] Strother he doesn't rule as number he
[53:03] doesn't contrast another he cannot push
[53:08] us here and pushes that number praise be
[53:14] to our God

[53:26] the Bible tells us that when it came it
[53:29] became clean oh praise the Lord you know
[53:35] the enemy fought so much against him
[53:39] becoming a team because of the plan that
[53:47] God had for him the enemy fought him so
[53:52] much
[53:53] nevertheless he tried everything he
[53:58] tried to kill him everything to
[54:01] discourage it here and there

[59:27] stretch
[59:29] a measure of suffering you have a
[59:35] measure you cannot run from it I cannot
[59:41] run from it no one can run for me

[1:02:43] what challenges and fish come and we
[1:02:50] hear people say this and people say that
[1:02:52] you have a choice to make of what to
[1:02:57] listen to because this this my voice is
[1:03:05] there remember there is the black dog
[1:03:11] and a white dog backyard it's world
[1:03:16] world world war what he said which one
[1:03:18] of them wins the battle he said the one
[1:03:21] you are listening to more the one you
[1:03:24] listen to more they want you feed more
[1:03:26] the one you attend tomorrow so what are
[1:03:33] you listening to
[1:03:37] you go what you listen you have such
[1:03:40] your life it is your life but David did
[1:03:50] something in his life he ignore all that
[1:03:54] will be spoken against him
[1:04:00] you can choose to listen to what they
[1:04:03] say or look at the things before I say
[1:04:06] about you or people laughed at me and
[1:04:09] all those things you have a free choice
[1:04:18] you can focus on your purposes or you
[1:04:23] can focus on your problems it's a choice
[1:04:32] everybody has problem so in the person
[1:04:38] where you focus which one are you
[1:04:46] feeding because when David came and he
[1:04:54] is the Jebusites
[1:04:56] then they hold Jerusalem it was this
[1:05:01] place go give to Israel and this size
[1:05:05] were on the land they were world like
[1:05:11] people fighters solo many touch they
[1:05:18] don't have anything to do with them but
[1:05:22] where they are was part of the Promised
[1:05:25] Land but God is giving you have been
[1:05:29] given a possession
[1:05:31] oh the Prophet said God could have
[1:05:38] driven the hardest Amalekites and drove
[1:05:43] them out of that place and put his right
[1:05:45] there but he didn't do it that way
[1:05:49] the promise set is chemic buses through
[1:05:52] a pipeline and pick you there and say
[1:05:57] you are a nova , what did you overcame
[1:06:02] you got something to fight for the
[1:06:09] promise said is not easy to go to hell
[1:06:14] instead to go to hell you have to fight
[1:06:19] they said if it's not easy you don't go
[1:06:22] to an easily you've got to fight so
[1:06:25] where to go that you suggest like
[1:06:29] somebody driving on the road and then
[1:06:31] and Donna and though you break the
[1:06:34] traffic rules when the lysis stop you
[1:06:38] don't stop he said what is it you are
[1:06:40] fighting your way to this it's in the
[1:06:44] same way God give the pasta go give the
[1:06:47] prophet god sings the songs he said
[1:06:49] their aims is in the word we preach and
[1:06:52] you bypass all you ignore all he said
[1:06:57] what you are doing you are fighting your
[1:06:59] way to hell if you gotta fight to go to
[1:07:05] here what am I going to have you must I
[1:07:10] be coming to heaven or framily
[1:07:14] better peace this I must fight if I must
[1:07:19] rain increase my courage Lord so here
[1:07:29] then he came to Jerusalem he has been
[1:07:31] another killing
[1:07:33] and he just look at that lesson in
[1:07:36] success
[1:07:37] no this is part of the promise of God
[1:07:40] and he set his eye towards Jerusalem the
[1:07:46] Jebusites where day but when God gave
[1:07:50] the promise he gave the land to do with
[1:07:52] everything that is that it is your
[1:07:54] possession
[1:07:56] it is for us and one listen listen and
[1:08:01] Jerusalem it was under here and you know
[1:08:10] somebody on the hill yes advantage and
[1:08:16] so did you precise said the lead and the
[1:08:20] cripples
[1:08:21] these have much confidence they had the
[1:08:25] lead and the creeper said you cannot
[1:08:28] give it to me you can come here don't
[1:08:33] waste the time minutes tried and they
[1:08:36] failed many have tried and they failed
[1:08:39] and so what are you coming to do you
[1:08:42] cannot make it but remember this also
[1:08:47] the weapons of our warfare are not Anna
[1:08:51] they are mighty through God to the
[1:08:55] pulling down of strongholds whatever as
[1:09:02] a street in your family in your life you
[1:09:04] can pull it down and so Lord is a place
[1:09:10] that is fortified it's a power base but
[1:09:16] we have been given a weapon to fight and
[1:09:19] break it down the project of God said go
[1:09:28] give us this weapon Capri
[1:09:31] and he said Prada is more powerful than
[1:09:35] the atomic bomb you believe that is
[1:09:43] essential whether you believe it or you
[1:09:47] don't believe it he said prayer is more
[1:09:50] powerful than the atomic bomb so he gave
[1:09:55] us each word he gave us a weapon the
[1:10:01] Prophet taught us and he said in the
[1:10:03] beginning when God knew there'll be an
[1:10:06] enemy he equipped his people with the
[1:10:09] best weapon you don't need to improve
[1:10:14] upon that weapon the weapon that was
[1:10:16] given to Adam in the beginning is the
[1:10:19] same weapon that have been given to us
[1:10:20] so does love the Belfort discovered you
[1:10:28] and destroy your confidence in the word
[1:10:32] of the Lord
[1:10:33] [Music]
[1:10:42] and so then it came to Jerusalem and and
[1:10:46] and and the jebusites were there and
[1:10:50] they say hey don't ride the cripples and
[1:10:56] the lives and don't ride you commit it
[1:11:01] thinking that then it could not come
[1:11:04] either nevertheless nevertheless get me
[1:11:11] to destroy hold them in person again
[1:11:16] Devon fought against them he found a way
[1:11:20] he told his soldiers if you cannot come
[1:11:27] up you go through the gutters find a way
[1:11:32] find a way to overcome the problem must
[1:11:37] be solved there is no mounting that we
[1:11:46] cannot lie
[1:11:49] that is not enemy that we cannot defeat
[1:11:55] that is not temptation that we cannot
[1:11:57] imagine the professor said no Joe Lewis
[1:12:05] can stand the church no power love us so
[1:12:10] we must know who we are because our
[1:12:16] power lies in recognizing in opposition
