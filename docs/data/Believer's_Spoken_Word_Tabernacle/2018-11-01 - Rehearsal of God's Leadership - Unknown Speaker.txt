redeemed we no longer want our own choice but yet how many times have we made our own choices but you see God comes back and he looks around when that soul has been redeemed and that want to has been changed to want to please him then he doesn't look at the mistakes he looks at the want when we are redeemed we no longer want our own choice we want his choice we want what he wants amen sometimes the choice that God has for us and for our lives it's going to look impossible to our natural mortal being but God didn't call us because that we were capable he called us because we belong to him and all that we have to do the greatest thing we have to do is if we can get ourselves out of the way then the Holy Spirit moves upon the word that he's already sown in our hearts and he performs it amen don't you just love the Lord Amen I tell you what we really had some some really really good services here I'll tell you I just thank God so much Amen for his his visitation and his mindfulness of our needs I don't know about you I've always believed that we need the fivefold ministry we just don't need the office of a pastor we need that as individuals to be in our own assemblies God does have that direction through a pastor but that alone is not enough it's God working through every office of his ministry aren't you glad aren't you glad you can recognize that to recognize his voice I tell you God just come by our way and I'm just so thankful to the Lord I'm just looking forward to what the Lord has for us here this coming weekend amen let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer

move Lord deeper and deeper Lord in our lives we love you Lord we praise you tonight the name of Jesus Christ amen amen if you will turn with me to the book of Deuteronomy and just Deuteronomy chapter 1 is where I'd like to begin verse 1 of Deuteronomy 1 these be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side of Jordan in the wilderness in the plain over against the Red Sea between paronto fell Laban has arose and dition there are 11 days journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir on to Kadesh Barnea and it came to pass in the fortieth year in the eleventh month on the first day of the month that Moses spake unto the children of Israel according unto all that the Lord had given him in commandment unto them after he had slain Sion the king of the amorite switch dwelt in heshbon and AAG the king of Bashan which dwelt in Astaroth in a dream on this side of Jordan in the land of Moab began Moses to declare this law say the Lord our God spake unto us in Horeb saying he have dwelt long enough in this mouth turn you and take your journey and go to the Mount of the amorite and unto the places not there unto in the plain and in the hills and in the Vale and in the south and by the seaside for the land of the canaanites and unto lebanon unto the great river the river Euphrates behold I have set the land before you go in and possess the land which the Lord swear unto your father's Abraham Isaac and Jacob to give unto them and to their seed after them may God bless his word as you're being seated I'd like to keep on reading if we could there in verse 18 of the same chapter and I commanded you at the time all the things which you should do and when we departed from Horeb we went through all the great and terrible wilderness which you saw by the way of the mountain of the amorite s-- as the Lord our God commanded us and we came to Kadesh Barnea and I said unto you ye are come into unto the mountain of the hammerites which the Lord our God doth give unto us behold the LORD hath set the land before thee go up and possess it as the Lord God of Our Fathers hath said unto thee fear not neither be discouraged I'd like to just take a thought here tonight in that time of turning northward how that God has spoke through Moses to the people and I'd really like to focus on just a thought of this here and you never recognize within this of the book of Deuteronomy in these opening chapters God is rehearsing to Israel his faithfulness and his leadership and that's what I'd like to speak to you tonight on rehearsal of God's leadership because we're that Israel was standing here at this time they were not in the promise of which God had made Israel was dwelling in the wilderness but the wilderness was not the goal the goal was not even to come out of Egypt that was only a part of the full equation but the full goal was that they would come out of Egypt and then they would go in to the promised land and yet God would bring this around to them here Moses being moved by the Spirit of God to rehearse to the children of Israel in this time it's a tie it's a crucial time it's a time where 40 years has expired according what God has spoken regarding the generation that rejected God's leadership they rejected his leadership and failed to move in now Moses in bringing them back to this place to speak to them that it's time to move and take our journey and go northward God is moving and speaking to them to let them know that if there is to be mindful of his leadership in all things I want you to think about this of how that God when we look at it of how that God had met Moses there before God ever sent Moses down to the to deliver the children of Israel God made himself known to Moses and God when he speaks to Moses he lets him know in Exodus chapter 3 that that I'm gonna send you and it's certainly in verse 12 I'm gonna be with you and this shall be a token unto thee that I've sinned 'they when thou hast brought the people out of Egypt ye shall serve God upon this mountain and we see how that God he goes on to let emotion oh here in verse 16 he reveals himself as the same God as the Living God to Moses now remember up to this time Moses has only heard about God he's never met God he's never heard personally from God so within this time God is setting the pattern of not only how that he's going to deal with the messenger of that of an the spokesman of that hour but this is exactly how that God will deal with the elect children of that hour it's the same way that he dealt with Abraham it's the same way that he dealt with Jacob it's the same way that he dealt with Isaac God never dealt with his people in a manner of just a second handed experience because there's no power in a second hand that experience it's only living off the knowledge of what someone else has come to know and experience but God's desire is for a complete personal experience with him that literally changes a person's life and it lifts us out of just where we are confined to this natural realm but we become in tune with the supernatural God just as God ministers and cares about every need within our life God knows all along the journey he knows what he set out and here God is making known to the people as he's rehearsing his leadership of how that he brought them to this time and how that God spoke to Moses and he let Moses know that I will bring the people up out of the out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites the Hittites the amorite the parasites and the Hivites and the Jebusites unto a land flowing with milk and honey and I I will say that tonight because that is the focus and that is the goal you see God in the first Exodus was taking a people out of a natural Egypt to a natural land but then notice here the pillar fire comes on the scene again after the crucifixion and the burial death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ here it comes on the scene and here Paul himself meets him face to face and remember it was taking a people from that of just Judea forms Judaism and taking them and placing them in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost as sons and daughters of God and then God moves along once again here it has been down through the church ages and the pillar of fire makes his appearance once again in this hour to bring the Church of the Living God from the baptism of the Holy Ghost of where that we are dwelling to that promise of in my father's house are many mansions the goal is not just to dwell around here just to you know thank God for bringing us out of Egypt but there's a lot more to it than God just bringing us out of Egypt there is a promise that is twofold that God has made he would not only bring us out of the land but he would take us into the land until we come into that land we do not receive the real spiritual blessings of God as a matter of fact the Prophet said outside of the land is sensations but inside of the land his real spiritual blessings because once in the land in the mystery of the birthright of the name within our lives becomes expressed when we are in position in Christ so you see this is God's desire it was God who made this promise unto Abraham it was not Abraham who made it but it was God who made the promise known to Abraham and I want you to think of this of how that God knows and he's mindful of each and every one of us you see God's desire when he sends his word it's not that a word would come to you and I and a man would have such great intellects and abilities being able to produce persons pronounce this word say this word and be able somehow by just words to convince somebody that's not God's Way of the gospel whatsoever but when God is interested in moving and he moves it is God coming by his word just like it said in there in the scriptures with the Apostles that the Lord was with them confirming the word with signs and wonders following you see signs and wonders must accompany a word and a word is that of a voice so it must work harmony in hand and handed to see how that God's desire is that you and I would have such an assurance within his word now you look at it you and I could come to a place and say well this is God's Word you know and God could look to you and I'd say but you just you just believe it but you see God has a way of where he raises the word so that it's not just when it word that we're looking at that we somehow just take in here and are able to sand and position ourselves but God wants to make it so real to where when you don't know how to position yourself the word has positioned you and you cannot be moved that's what God is interested in doing he's interested in being the anchor when you can't explain what's going on so to see how that brother branham makes a statement here a double confirmation I love this he sucks about how that God he said the Covenant was given unconditionally Israel to see natural exchanged it and lost it in Exodus 19 when they made that rational mistake to take away the Grace and accepted law in its place what a rational mistake that Israel made there well watch what he says look God after he made the covenant with Abraham Grace had provided a prophet deliver for them in Egypt to carry out the word of Abraham nor glory you see he couldn't know against Abraham's word being a true prophet it would be the fulfillment and continuity of the word that's already been spoken that's why I truly don't understand when we have people and people's who say we don't need the Old Testament I don't understand that because out if you have not the old you do not have the new because it's out of the old that the new comes forward there had to be a fulfillment the old being a type of a man and the New Testament being a type of the married woman Christ's bride but he would project his life in so all of this is showing a great picture of God's great redemptive story notice he says remember Moses under the bush God said I've heard the cries of my people and I remember my promise before there was any law grace provided it Grace had provided a sacrifice for their guilt a lamb Grace had provided a covenant circumcision was already been provided before law grace had provided a pillar fire to lead them following a profit age security that the Prophet had told them the truth do you catch this the pillar fire is a security what is the pillar fire it's the angel of the covenant none other than the person of Jesus Christ I'll tell you what we just don't need the truth we must have him who vindicates the truth we must have that same pillar of fire remember friends millions have the truth they have this Bible but it takes the Holy Ghost to come upon it and make it live that's why the Prophet would say over and over he said the Bible itself is not altogether the gospel he said the word itself is not altogether the gospel but the gospel is the word in power and demonstration that is the real gospel of Jesus Christ that brings a change in a person's life that leads you from a life of sin that leads you into a place where you can walk in victory and you can actually manifest and reflect the glory of God in your life who does that that law brace provides hallelujah it is a security I'll tell you what is the pastor of this church it is a security that the Holy Ghost is present it is the security to me that I hear from him and he'll whisper to my heart sometimes it might just be a word of the times it's a phrase when there's things I don't know what to do I do not and I refuse to take my mind and my thoughts regarding you I want to know what does father say what does he want right now sometimes I think we get things wrong we take the message as a tool the message is not a tool the message is to be and lead us to a life that is Christ reflecting himself through these instruments we are his tools we are the we are the branches of the vine how is this going to happen God will bring it to past oh my a security that the Prophet had told them the truth it was the word that he was talking about notice the word that he was pointing them to they know that God promised it and here was the pillar of fire confirming it what a double security Grace had done that I don't know about you but I just don't need it back there I need it right now I need that same Holy Ghost right now I believe with all my heart that same pillar of fire is right here tonight I believe that same one has gotten us let me tell you friends there's different one sitting right here in this congregation that has witnessed that pillar fire moved right through the building but if your eyes could not see it you say I'd seen it but you know it's not a man that deals with your heart it's not a man that puts your heartstrings it's not a man that knows the thoughts that goes through your heart but it is the Lord God Himself that knows exactly what you are I have need of that same pillar of fire totally to God to God be the glory but notice brother ben says they wanted something for themselves that they could do have their own creeds and denominations and whatever more and make pharisees and sadducees something they could do their self man is always trying to save himself you can't do it God has already done it you just have to accept it and believe it a pillar of fire to lead them listen this a pillar fire to lead them and guide them to lead them in a way a power Grace had provided a power to condemn their enemy and to make them free the power had already been they didn't know how they were gonna live Egypt they were not gonna leave it under the intellection man but it was the redemptive power of God moving down through his word and God laid claim and he laid hold upon his children and they walked out of Egypt there they came there to the Red Sea and when they got there to the Red Sea they didn't know what they were gonna do and Moses was reminded reminded of the commission I've given you you shall bring them to this land there might be an obstacle in front of you tonight but I'm telling you the promises I will bring you into their land there might be all sorts of things that seem to be in your way but remember all of those things are mere opportunities that God himself might make known his glory and build your faith in a personal testimony because you need that personal testimony when it comes time to with the Giants no repeater God the Bible says that the angel of the Lord led them out of there they didn't have a great machine to pump out the Red Sea how a like our brother Graham said it he said they say huh yeah you know they just the Red Sea was you know ankle-deep at that time what's the response to the prophet the prophet said glory to God he said that's even more of a miracle God took like an ankle deep water and drowned it off a Pharaoh's soldiers I'm telling you you know why because Pharaoh's soldiers the Bible says in Exodus 14 they sought to follow the children of Israel but let me tell you something they did not have the unction and the power and the authority that had been given to the children of Israel what give the children of Israel that power and authority the grace of God had provided the power of god that was needed in order to take them across into their land the Egyptians only followed presumptuously all thanks be to God we are not following planning devised fables of men we are not following and wandering but we are moving under the authority of Almighty God not my power not by my by my spirit saith the Lord this mountain shall be removed Grace provided a power that drowned all of Egypt's army they crossed the Red Sea they had smote Pharaoh they done all these things with grace they done all these things with grease we need to be reminded of God's leadership the work that God began he began it by grease not because that we were worthy grace provided it and that saying what God is calling for it requires His grace to be able to move to provide for what he's calling for yeah amen they've done all these things with grace and then they exchanged grace for a law and that had nothing to do with the royal seed of Abraham brother Ram makes another statement here and I'm just gonna just kind of glance through some of this here it's out of the unveiling of God and it begins to me he's speaking to us and letting us know when he had come to Moses he was a pillar fire he was veiled in the pillar fire there at the bush but here before the people God vindicated him by the same pillar of fire amen they goes on he says now how God had appeared to Moses and he said now but this time he visibly scientifically appeared and vindicated Moses ministry to be the same God that spoke to him because he had appeared in the form of the pillar fire and set the mountain on fire so notice how brother Branham was moving here in this message he moves right here into this time to where here they are here up on the Mount and God moves down and he's vindicating Moses with that pillar of fire now what's all of this he said God first appeared to Moses in the burning bush Vail before the people got veiled again and vindicated Moses by the veil veiling himself with the same fire and same fire came down from Vienna notice God coming down there on the mountain his presence settling down and God talking to Moses now remember he says from then so they could only hear God's Word just the word they heard his voice for Moses was to them the living word Swissy God had so proven that word by Moses now what's what God is doing God is coming by his personal presence and now that the people have been called out of Egypt here where it comes to that of the Mount God is going to be it start speaking a commandment and giving there of the direction in the order of the host he's going to be giving there and putting lives in place and in order things that they themselves will actually do even when they come into that land of promise how many recognize that the land of promise when God brings us into this of the baptism of the Holy Ghost it is not something to wear it's just a slothfulness it's a laziness or lettuce nothing to do but we recognize it's something that moves upon our heart and the desire itself is to please him and to serve his will and his purpose so in order for us to serve his will and his purpose God must make known his will his word to our lives so here is God confirming the word the pillar fire being visible before the people to conform the word that's being spoken by Moses now what is it it was there to vindicate Moses that they should hear the word that's coming forth but the pillar fire coming there and vindicating that was not to keep the people's focus confined to Moses but it was to place their faith in the God who was speaking the word and the word he was speaking was a word that had already been given is that right now notice when we see this where the RAM says he goes on in the same message and he says he was a prophet and God had vindicated his word now he'd went down there and seen signs and wonders and then he says he this people got separated unto themselves a church see a church means called out as long as Israel was in Egypt now watch this you see this is where that the Bible itself is not just is not on just a book of history it's not a chronicling of events but it's a prophecy just exactly what God did with natural Israel is the type of what God has done and is doing with spiritual Israel when natural Israel came out and they failed to go into the promised come on now they couldn't go right on into the promise they rejected that is that right then you have a time of 40 years in the midst of that 40 years you have Balaam arising come on now you have been even when they come into that place you have that prophetess Jezebel rising up hello now in these church ages of the Israel all of those things were rising up but it does not it cannot it will not stop God's program what God has said he will fulfill sometimes that ain't turning as fast as we think it off to and we think we got to help God get pieces in order I'm telling you what we don't have to have help God get no pieces in order the piece that we need to take care of is our own self we need to be in prayer and getting ourselves so surrendered before God before we ever get eyes or one another and if we've got our eyes on one another in Auto beat on one another's heart where we're playing all God make us one Lord bind us together or God in the unity of the promise cause as far as failures you don't need to look any further you don't even need to look outside of this pulpit and I don't need to look any further than these pews right here but you know what I'm not looking at your failures God is not looking at my failures but like Moses and we are looking we might look through the same window but we are recognizing I am preaching to people of whom that I am one with and we have a promise we shall be changed I don't know glory be to God I don't care how black it looks I don't care how hot I don't care if all be Saints God said so and what God has said it's up to God to produce it whoo glory this people notice they got separated unto themselves a church while they were in Egypt they were not a church but a church means are called out look after after they was called out of the world and became a people then God let herself be known that he was that pillar fire he proved Moses message after they came out he proved Moses message the signs the wonders all of those were absolutely necessary you say all that was for those people down in Egypt no no that was for the believers because they knew the promise of God mutation they walk by the bones of Joseph every day but when it came time for God to fulfill the promise God was on the scene God was right there making himself known by fans and wonders let me tell you something a person that says all we need is the word and we don't need signs and wonders I'm telling you that's an unbeliever we need signs and wonders the Bible says signs and wonders follow them that believe right here God over and over to his children he didn't have to provide the pillar fire he did it for a security you know I God comes in our midst and heals the sick and musical needs and opens doors and jobs and all these things you know why he does it because he can and he loves you and I huh and what's he doing he's increasing our faith in His Word you ought to want to see God bless people ain't talking about bigger homes and bigger cars and whatever more I'm talking about you are the desire to see God move perfect faith brother brems says oh how in my heart I desire to see those apostolic times again but sometimes in some people's Bible I wonder what kind of translation they got they've done just a word only God I don't want to dead God I believe in a Living God I didn't meet a letter I knew this message by letter I knew scriptures in the Bible but I needed to meet God personally I didn't need to just hear about him I needed to meet him personally to where he would literally change my life and birth himself into my life that's what I needed and that's what the Church of the Living God needs huh after they was called out of the world now watch this God proving that the message was right message was at hand everything was they was going to be exodus then veiled his prophet to his exodus people here is God think of this another time I know this is very simple he says it goes on to say this in this message how that God the word was first coming to Moses and then he said the word had to be given out to the people and the word itself now once it's given out to the people it would be that same word that would later become veiled behind badger skins I'm looking tonight at badger skins that are veiling the very word of God confirmed by the pillar fire that very word living inside of your life it was written there in your DNA upon your gene but the pillar of fire coming by our way it raises up what he has already sober in your life and what is it it's veiling they hailing God Moses my question how did he lead him how did Moses know when to lead how did he know now's the time to go I mean did he just but you know what I'm tired of this I mean after all preached fifty parts on this right here let's just go how did he know when to go if somebody would have been watching this from the outside what would they have seen they would have seen in witnessed here there was a pillar fire by night and a cloud by day they would watch how that these people would set in one place maybe they would sit there for a day two days months and then all of a sudden they would be up and moving what is it that was triggering them to move now no doubt there were people there in those states think of this friends people there in those days I don't know if there were others of that they could see that pillar fire that cloud that's not my point right now but might be even to recognize it would be something of how that these people would be so orchestrated to be led in this time that you know you would think that he would get the attention of the people you know that was surrounding but you know what it didn't the only thing that it did is cause hatred to rise in the hearts of the people whose lands they were passing through why did those people hate them because they were people of a promise it was not those people it was demonic spirits that were there in the wilderness that were sent forth to try to turn him back preacher admit now it was spirits that had never crossed over the Jordan there they were bound that the river Euphrates but them spirits themselves who are trying to turn away the Covenant people of God but it was not the people of God that had brought themselves out of Egypt it was the grace of God and the same grace of God wouldn't move for them had backed them across the Jordan that same grace of God he gives you an avid dominion over all these ecclesiastic spirits that would want to try to turn back the real believer but there is a land across the river and my soul has already been birthed into that land Barry as they call from the other side how long do we stay here it depends on how long Papa wants us here turn with me in the Bible to Exodus 40 would you do that Oh Gloria you love the Lord look at this verse 36 and when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys but if the cloud were not taken up then they journeyed not till the day that he was taken up you weren't gonna move him if the cloud weren't moving if the pillar file1 moving they weren't moving you can call him cloud followers all you want to call him that cloud was not a natural cloud that cloud was a supernatural cloud there wasn't rockets that made this cloud it was God himself by his promise you could call him all you want to but they were there locked in and they knew when it's time to move it's time to move you see they realize that it's not for us wherever I'm camping out now I'm not always going to be here in this spot I'm going to be moving your mouse I realize it right now well you wear your hat now you ain't that always going to be there you're gonna be moving on you're moving on with God and God desiring us to move on I believe as the Holy Spirit spoke so expressly on Sunday not to keep going around in the same cycle but be cycle breakers by faith cycle breaking or glory being a god notice for the cloud of the Lord upon the tabernacle body and fire was on it by night in the night of all the house of Israel throughout all their journeys let me tell you something you can read this over numbers 9 I'm not even going to have time to read it but over numbers 9 you even find where God speaks of it there in numbers 9 of how that Israel was watching that cloud in that pillar of fire you see and you realize that as we go over here go to and go to numbers chapter 10 with me you look over in numbers chapter 10 after after we've been in numbers 9 you go down there in numbers 10 glory be to God in verse 11 the Bible says and it came to pass on the 20th day of the second month in the second year that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle the testimony and the children of Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of sanneya and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran and they first took their journey according to the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses Moses was interpreting that to them the pillar flower is lifting up the cloud is lifting up remember it didn't matter what time of the day it was sometimes it could be a very convenient time you know it'd be a very convenient time if you're already awake last morning time 10 o'clock to pack your bags right but then what if I came to your house and woke you up at 3 o'clock in the morning right you'd be lucky to try to get up but then I tell you hey pack your bags we're going right now but you see Israel knew that at any moment they could be gone I mean they could be moving they knew at any moment they had to be ready on a moment's notice Wow because where they were dwelling Old Glory bit a dog where they would selling was not their final resting place I'll tell you as a believer we have a resting place in Christ but while we are in this life this life is not my final resting place this tabernacle of humiliation is not my inheritance it's my possession but in my father's house are many mansions that is my inheritance a body that will match my soul so Moses in our opening chapter has told them turn you and let's take our journey the opening of chapter 2 the Lord spake unto Moses at this time it said take your journey northward you see Moses is rehearsing the leadership of the Holy Spirit that the people themselves here is a new generation remember here is a generation that watched the older generation die they watched those who had rejected the promise of God they watched them die they watched there were those who had seen even the 10 men that brought up the evil report died right there that day immediately for the plague before the Lord and then you see the effect of the discouragement that came in the hearts and how that the people went along with it but God will not be defeated God has made a promise and God noticed while at the same time there was a group of people that God was killing off there was another group of people God was raised enough it was a people that God himself would take across not that they were going to be better more worthy nothing like that at all it was simply our people that would come to know the keeping power of God the grace of God the privation of God and the power of God you see it would be a new generation that would not just talk about testimonies and not have any connection of that but it would be a new generation who would see the mighty acts of God and would recognize the mighty acts of God even in their generation as God would whip some Kings like Sion and Lashon and all the rest of them that would build their faith before going into the land that they would know that God is still God what was God doing Grace was providing the faith that they had need of as their right it is by grace that you are saved not by works it is not my faith your faith that God has supplied the faith to each and every one of us may God always keep us humble and if we get away from that bring us back to that place Lord to recognize that ain't us when we get to that point we need a deflation but I'm glad he seemed to deflate us whenever we need to you see Moses I want you to think of this you know sometimes you could look at a situation you know where maybe with your children or other things like this and you could look at it and say I'm tired of being where I'm at this is awful I don't want to be here no more come on grow up come on get with it that's out of frustration that don't help nobody that'll do nobody any good you don't even do you no good did you see Moses was not saying this out of frustration let's take our journey onward he was rehearsing God's leadership to them to let them know that this word that I'm speaking that it's time to go northward this is God speaking you see he wasn't even allowing their faith to rest on it's 40 years 40 years of past we must go out and do it that's the same thing Moses did in the beginning Moses thought now is the time it disobey the right time it is the right time but you know what in the right time God will move it's got to be God to move and then you know it's the right time and when God moves we want to move with God so you'd better see that pillar of fire itself they were just following the fire see it was Martin Luther think of this Martin Luther followed the fire right out of the Catholic Church Wesley followed the fire right out of where the Lutheran had can't down how did the Lutheran's get camp down they didn't see the fire there were many who came around and they heard Luther's message but they really didn't feed on Luther's message they only heard it to debate it and put other people down and do this or that they weren't feeders they were here's there's a difference between being a feeder and a hear you can hear it but if you feed it you become one with it and if you become one with it you got the same nature of him who is the word inside of you and that nature whole mile we could run through the attributes so we want not to be just hearers and listeners we want to be feeders on the word you see there were those who were acquainted with a pillar fire and they moved on when God moved with that pillar fire now think about this here how that Moses himself like we said Moses he had heard about God but he never had talked to God before the Bible says in every age to this to the seven churches he that half an ear let him hear what the Spirit say it to the churches the Lord Jesus picks it up in Matthew 13 speaking of the parables that are there of the kingdom and he said he that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit have to say the church let me tell you something you and I did not give ourselves ears to hear we did not make ourself have ears to hear that is the grace of Almighty God this word what God is doing in this generation it what a passed over our head a million miles listen friends we would have just been fellowship around miracles and around testimonies and this of what God has done would have been no more than another movement of what God did through another man of God but we recognize that this right here has a move of God it was not taking us to a station this is moving us into eternity there was that where Martin Luther he brought the church to a station just shall live by faith Wesley bought him to another station to that of sanctification it was there Pinnacle's brought him to another station of their the restoration of gives of the baptism of the Holy Ghost but we're not going to another station there is not a sitting down we are going to Eternity that eighth day has moved inside our souls this is not another station we've done left the station we are seated in the astronaut and our countdown did not begin with our worldly number 10 is a worldly number they began with one two three four five six seven and we are seated in the astronaut himself in the Lord Jesus Christ buckled in sealed in baptized in fool of the quickening power of Almighty God glory be to God that same God had got ahold of Moses you see brother am says it like this he said God had never talked to him before he had just learned it out of a book so God talked to him that's the reason no one knows what he was talking about God talked to him that's how he knowed he heard it from God aren't you glad to hear from God aren't you glad you could hear from God you see I just don't hear from God when I'm listening to a tape I don't just hear to hear from God when I'm reading a book I don't just hear from God even when I'm sitting in the house of God I hear from God even when I'm outside [Applause] because you see if I can only hear God in a certain way then I might want to question am I really hearing God or is it just something I think I'm hearing because if I'm hearing God that's his voice I'm hearing I'm not you're not here my natural voice you might when you listen to the tape you can hear brother branham's voice but let me tell you something if you don't hear the voice inside of that voice you miss it you must hear the voice inside of that voice God never sent the seventh angel for his natural voice to be idolized but he said God sent His Word to bring you and I in contact with himself the pillar of fire moving down like it did upon Moses was to vindicate the Lord to the people when a man hears the voice of God personally he hears the Word of God now you can hear it he said will you saved well God God has to come meet me yes sir I could sit here listen now I could sit here and preach till I fell dead in the pulpit ten twenty thirty fifty years from now you never hear it until God reveals the word to you you know one way to know when God's revealing the word to you and makes you act like God you don't cause you to get puffed up and look down or this or that that's not revelation that's called head knowledge that's of puffing up come on friends you see real revelation does not lead you away from the body of Jesus Christ it brings you to the body Oh glory be to God notice you'd never hear it until God reveals the word to you you can sit right in your seat all of this you don't have to be by a burning bush maybe you're closer than you think you are just sit there and let God speak to you in the word I've gotta quit this kind of life I'm living I gotta be right that's God God in his word making himself known to you how to make my life right with God that's God that's God certain I've got to die someday certainly you're gonna die I've got a hamster at the judgement certainly you're gonna answer at the judgement what is it it's God speaking through his word to us the matter of fact my friend goes on to say it again he said God's got a burning bush right by every seat here tonight he's got an angel that can set your heart afire right here tonight Oh glory be to God let me say this in her let's bring this let's bring it down I want you to think of this here's 40 years they went around at kadish Moses knew by experience what it was like to be a failure for 40 years he knew what it was all he listened Moses was preaching by an experience he knew for 40 years he had been out there in the wilderness he knew that out there in the 40 years of the winters he had got so occupied on sheep racing he knew all about the different kinds of sheep he had sheep he had sheep raisin magazine coming in he was on sheep rigging raising blog posts he was on their Facebook pages he was on their Twitter accounts he was all wrapped up in sheep raising he was wrapped up did this look like the same guy who believed that this was a people of promise did this look like the same guy who at one time it started out with such zeal it didn't at all he would have been in that state and he would have continued in that state except the grace of God one day as he was out there raising sheep God said now is the time now is the time Moses thought he knew the time God said I know the time I've got the time that's in my hands and if God attracts him away from the Sheep racing he attracts him away from what he was an expert upon and God attracts him and speaks to him out of a burning bush you see it wasn't that of he s you in but it was the som that was burning inside of that bush it was Christ that same one who stood there in front of the Pharisees when they said thou are not a man more than fifty years old and you said you had seen Abraham he said before Abraham was I am he was letting them know beasts people think friends the Pharisees the Sadducees they knew the law of Moses they knew the commandments what were those commandments it was the words that the pillar of fire had come to vindicate as God's Word and that word must come forth and here were people that had the word but they couldn't recognize the pillar fire standing in their midst that had brought the word off the page Oh God help us not to be in that condition help us not to be people that are trapped in the past help us to be people Lord better moving on into the promises of God you see Moses he forgot the promise but God never forgot it Moses had lost listen the Prophet said had lost the vision of victory and freedom you might be sitting here tonight and you might have asked God for a promise over and over maybe you're sitting out here and you've asked God for the Holy Ghost over and over again maybe there's a need in your life maybe there's a need in your body let me tell you something you let God restore the vision you let God birth that into your heart tonight he's then not the pillar of fire right there to your seat say Lord Jesus I'm available to not Lord God I'm available for you to come and make yourself known you said this a Thursday night I'm telling you we're dealing with an eternal being he does not know and is not bound by the boundaries of time but he works according to his word and when the heart is made open he will come and make himself known hello that same pillar fire that'll give you a vision it'll renew within your heart where everything has been blotted out where everything looks so dark it looks so bleak it looks so impossible but the pillar of fire moving right there and moving right across your life all of a sudden that begins to be something glory hopefully that moves up in your heart I'm the Lord that healeth all my diseases I'm the Lord that giveth the Holy Ghost I am your deliverer I am your comfort I am your provider he moves right down upon your heart and begins to West by his word what should I do take that word and confess it he is my comfort he is my deliverer the Holy Ghost is mine he is my healer Wow because that is a moral word that's a word that the Spirit of God has picked up and Viet is speaking and when he moves upon your life you speak that word with authority and what's the same God come on the scene with the more and ladder together and bring that word to pass god knows what he's doing his timing is always perfect think about this and closing Elijah he went up to Mount Carmel he said I'm doing this at thy word Lord let it be known that thou art God and I'm your servant and these are your people you with me you see what that words doing it's bringing people together I hope you understand it's not a man-made bringing together this is not a man-made unity it's God uniting his people with himself if we're just united together as a bunch of people were in trouble but if we are assembled by God look out devil watch out devil well let me give the words the Prophet said in wisdom versus faith be careful devil because why it ain't us it's the power of God behind us Korah be to God it's not us that cast out Devils it's God in His people that cast out Devils it ain't us that heels a sec it's God who heals the sick it ain't us who delivers it's God who delivers it ain't us who fills it with the Holy Ghost it's God who feels with the Holy Ghost could over it be to God think about it the Lord Jesus look at this here he is on the scene they're telling him in the house of Lazarus hey there's a man down here baptizing on the name of Jordan in Jordan the mother name of John they told him that but then the Bible says there in Matthew chapter 3 here when John begin to announce that there's one among you whose shoes I am not even worthy to lose the Scriptures emphatic Lee state then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John to be baptized of him why didn't he come to John right away it wasn't time but when it was time he was led by the Spirit of God into the water think about it here when he come a man who was at the Pool of Bethesda there were many who were sick lame at that pool they were waiting what were they waiting on they were waiting on the angel to come in trouble the water I'm gonna tell you couldn't got those people away from there if you had a trial Emmett said I wonder if somebody had their palette right here you try to pull out their rug from her you might have had a fight a couple dukes in a Christian way why because they knew I've got to be here because right here is where the angels gonna come and I've got a need in my life and I want to be here when he comes you could not move them from that spot they knew God would visit it let me tell you something as a believer a believer recognizes God will always visit according to his word that he has promised the Holy Spirit the angel of the Lord comes on the scene to stir in trouble the water that's the time to move into the water when he's troubling the water that's the time to move on and the Lord Jesus moved right down in there he skipped over this one stepped over that one excuse me here excuse me there he moved all till they got to that one why did he go to that one because that's the one that he was shown he went right through that one and may tell you something that man could have never got there to the pool he said they keep on beating me there but the same God that sent glory be to God the same God that sent the angel was the same God who was on the scene and the same God who sent the angels seven stars in his right hand is the same God who came on the scene in the end time he's the same God hello where did he visit the house of mercy Jesus Lazarus your buddy he's sick unto death and Jesus in a frantic latekka I don't know oh Jesus all bowed there two more days how could he be so calm because this is listen to me now carefully he was reserved I do nothing of myself what's he doing restoring the leadership that was in the garden in the beginning when the second Adam walked here it was a rehearsal of God's a leadership back there I'd do nothing but what I see the father doing that doeth the son likewise you think he wasn't pulled to go he was pulled to go the one whom thou lovest his gate of affection was rattling come on somebody but he possessed the date of his enemy hallelujah why did he do that for you and me but you and I can look and say greater is He that is in me Satan might try to rattle your gate of reasoning he might try to rattle your gate of imagination he might try to rattle your gate of affection he might try to rattle your memory gates but remember the seed shall possess the gates of thine enemy and when he told the disciples come on now it's time to go away classes they fought something's wrong with him but you know what it was what he said was the truth it's just they didn't understand what he was saying he had to bring up and update their understanding of what he was talking about I love him don't you Acts chapter 18 when Paul was getting ready the heat was on in Corinth they were putting it on Paul Paul was ready to run Paul was ready to move out of there but God appeared to him at night the Lord spoke to Paul in the night my vision be not afraid but speak and hold not bad peace for I am with thee and no man shall set on me to hurt thee for I have much people in the city why was that that Paul had to remain in Corinth because there was much people that were God's people they were already God's people they didn't know they were God's people Oh hallelujah and he continued there a year in six months teaching the Word of God among them who was it that kept Paul there the pillar five the angel of the Covenant the cloud by day he pillar fire by night Paul stayed there under the leading of the Holy Spirit think about this in closing now here's Paul they've loosed from Crete Paul's on his way to see Caesar they shouldn't have never loose from Crete Paul tells him you shouldn't have done this Oh God how many times there's things were the Holy Spirit we could look in our lives and say yeah I've been there there's times I've loosed from Crete and I shouldn't l always lost loose from Crete you know what it brings you to with experiences in our life you can either do one or two things you can either take experiences and say well I want to forget those things that are behind me that is a truth but don't just take them and not make them lessons in your life let the Holy Spirit teach you to be more sensitive in your life because as a believer that's one thing that we want to be is more sensitive to God we've all had our loosening from Crete experiences are you with me Omaha but how Paul stood up in the midst of him and said I exhort you to be a good cheer for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you but of the ship for there stood by me this night the angel of God sure you let him know this is not my thinking this is not my doing but the angel of God has stood by me this night who's I am and whom I serve aren't you glad that you can say that the angel of the Lord whose I am and whose servant I am saying fear not Paul thou must be brought before Caesar there's not a storm that can sink the ship you are too gonna stand before Caesar you know why he wasn't so much about Caesar it was for some elect in Caesars house hallelujah there was some Electra net were there and lo God hath given thee all to them sail with thee wherefore sirs be of good cheer for I believe God that it shall be even as it was told me howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island we've had our Islands we have Islands tests and trials but it has not stopped the Word of God there are certain predestinated pre-planned experiences of God's divine grace that has the bride of Jesus Christ I trust it becomes more real to you tonight but here is the secret for she has the mind of Christ she has thus saith the Lord no one can make her do otherwise she waits on him she looks to him that pillar fire let's tan the Rebbe says we today are God's spiritual church with a spiritual law written on the tables of our hearts LED in a spiritual form now they looked up to see where the pillar fire was the angel the Lord but we don't look today there's just something happens that we know he's there but just something happens that we know is there so this rehearsal of God's leadership Moses is speaking to him it's time to turn northward it's time to quit going around in all of these circles it's time to move over into the promised land he's rehearsing to them God's leadership but this is not my thinking this is not my frustration although it's a longing of mine to go into that land but this is thus saith the Lord it's God's Word to God's people let's turn northward let's go across that land let's go into the promises oh my tonight if you're not there he's here to take you there and if you're there he's there to take us all the rest of the way home grace has led me safe thus far and His grace will take me home let's pray Lord Jesus our confidence the Lord not in ourselves not in our abilities and Lord God it's in your sovereign grace the very power of God moving down Lord God moving in our lives it's true Lord not here in our midst you can make yourself visible at st. pillar fire you've not only done it here you've done it Lord God in many places where the believers are gathered together as our red Lord just today for your profits speaking regarding how you had your picture taken with us he said he did not come because of me it's because of you Oh Lord Jesus Lord we stand hearing a very great time a very great hour I pray Heavenly Father the Lord through the simplicity of your word tonight may our hearts just say Lord simply just leave me I want to just follow your leadership I don't have to figure it out I don't I don't have to know because that's not faith the Lord to trust you Moses when he went down there Lord as your prophet put it when he went down there among the children of Israel you never kept all of the trials and tests from him as a matter of fact he was faced with Jennie's and Jambres and every sort of unbelief so many things Lord stood against him but bran put it like this you came to bluffing came to knock at him but Moses stood because there was one standing on the inside of him he didn't know how he just knew you were going to do it that's the simplicity Lord when you reveal yourself to an individual to our lives no wonder Lord as your prophet would tell us over and over how it's so important that a person must have their personal experience meeting you on the sacred sands of God's grace and how that in our life we must pray we ought to pray for revelations Lord God we see tonight revelation it leads us Lord leads us greater humility leads us the Lord God to be more like you or God all the signs all the wonders all the miracles all the healings everything Lord that's been done right here just right in our little assembly that you've come by your grace and performed Lord God you've never done it for it you never did it for a show you never did it to highlight any person you did it to confirm your word and that our faith would raise in you Lord God Oh Lord Jesus granted us this evening may our hearts Lord may every heart in here may every life if there's one that's lost that vision may it be a renewal tonight Lord may their vision of victory and freedom be renewed in their hearts Lord tonight father we commit every life to You Lord God may that same Holy Ghost Lord God that brought us here tonight Lord that father moved Lord God to speak this word tonight in a spoke to our hearts many you Lord God moved Lord God drawing every heart Lord God to you Lord may you move behind badger skins tonight Lord God move Lord God into the depths Lord God of our hearts in our lives we love you Lord Jesus we bless your name Father there is a land beyond the river Lord it echoes it whispers it calls in our hearts but right now Lord that
