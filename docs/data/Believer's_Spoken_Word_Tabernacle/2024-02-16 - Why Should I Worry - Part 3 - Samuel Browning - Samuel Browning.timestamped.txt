[34:34] amen
[34:38] hallelujah isn't it tremendous we have
[34:41] everything in the world to look forward
[34:43] to and the world in itself is just we we
[34:48] see the reality it's it is exactly how
[34:51] the prophet announced it when he was
[34:53] here this world is falling apart and
[34:56] I've often many times and you've
[34:58] probably heard me say this I've often
[35:00] marveled at how brother Brandon would
[35:02] take a text like that and I wondered
[35:04] what those people thought at that time
[35:07] because you see even though there's
[35:08] things that brother Bram could see in
[35:11] certain things is manifestation then but
[35:14] a prophet sees the seeds and a prophet
[35:17] sees if these seeds get swn what kind of
[35:20] crop it'll
[35:21] produce and so you know within this time
[35:24] that we're living in we're we're seeing
[35:26] what the prophet saw and we're seeing
[35:29] what not only the prophet that God gave
[35:31] us in this hour because it was a
[35:32] scriptural Prophet it was a promise that
[35:34] God fulfilled and it was exactly what
[35:37] God had said in his word the condition
[35:39] and how that it would be in this hour
[35:41] but I am thankful for reality in our
[35:45] lives that even in the darkest and the
[35:48] bleakest of hour that we're in we are
[35:50] filled with the joy of the
[35:53] Lord our future just like the angel of
[35:57] the Lord told the prophet when God
[35:58] healed him of that amoeba he saw that
[36:01] typewriter he saw it typed out there and
[36:04] he saw the the paper pulled out and
[36:06] thrown in the air and he said your
[36:09] future is
[36:11] clear I'm telling you that to me is an
[36:15] announcement that the lamb has brought
[36:18] to us in this hour amen our future is
[36:22] clear amen there's a clear way pathway
[36:25] back home and I'm going up
[36:28] yonder I am so thankful to the Lord amen
[36:33] you know as I mentioned to I was talking
[36:36] with
[36:38] someone last week and on the phone and I
[36:40] said you know sometimes I said you you
[36:43] you hear things I said where it's always
[36:46] like putting it far out and and we've
[36:48] got to reach out for this and this is
[36:49] coming and this is coming and the
[36:51] bride's Revival and I said I don't know
[36:53] what we're looking for but I am so happy
[36:56] with what God is doing right
[36:59] now I I'm I'm not that that's a the the
[37:02] the trick of the enemy is to reach and
[37:04] push something way out say looked what
[37:07] it was and failed to see what God is
[37:09] doing now but the work that God is doing
[37:12] now is just exactly like the prophet
[37:14] preached when the opening of the seals
[37:17] God hiding in Simplicity and revealing
[37:20] himself in the
[37:22] same I tell you God is so good isn't he
[37:27] you
[37:28] know amen and amen well we I won't won't
[37:32] keep you we could sing we keep on
[37:33] singing not that we can sing but we just
[37:36] sing but uh we just could talk to you we
[37:39] love you it's so good to be it's good to
[37:42] be back home and I got a chance to
[37:44] listen to the service when I was coming

[38:17] the mold when he did he got brother
[38:20] Steven I can say that I got some room to
[38:22] get back at him

[38:31] [Laughter]

[38:39] tell you I was rejoicing in the car and
[38:41] you know and uh I tell you you you you
[38:44] catch uh the Holy Spirit many things
[38:47] were said but I looked at my wife
[38:49] sitting in the car I said that's
[38:50] backtack Services where the Holy Spirit
[38:52] has taken a man of God and told a person
[38:55] you don't have to go in the world world
[38:56] to have a testimony backtack Services of
[39:00] two
[39:01] individuals that they they know one
[39:03] another but didn't know that one
[39:04] another's here and it just goes to show
[39:07] that you know you might look in your
[39:09] life and say I didn't go out and do this
[39:10] and do that or even as a young person
[39:12] whatever more but how much greater is
[39:14] the grace of God to keep you and you
[39:17] look to the Lord and trust the Lord all
[39:18] the way and it's God who has his hand
[39:20] upon you to bring you to every
[39:22] experience that he's predestinated and
[39:24] just to trust him amen that that's
[39:26] powerful that's a powerful
[39:29] testimony amen and I mean that with all
[39:32] my heart it's a powerful testimony I
[39:34] rejoice when you see that young people
[39:36] that have not gone out in the world and
[39:38] even through their Journey while coming
[39:39] to the Holy Ghost even I rejoice in that
[39:42] you know why there's a lot of scars they
[39:44] don't have a lot of scars they don't
[39:47] have and I look and say That's The Power
[39:49] of Jesus Christ to keep and hold on to a
[39:52] young person I'm thankful to the Lord
[39:54] for that amen and that's what we want to
[39:57] just with all of our hearts amen just to
[40:00] see
[40:01] that uh want to as we stand if we could
[40:04] thank you musicians and uh just want to
[40:07] say we had just a a wonderful time there
[40:09] with brother Barry coffee and the Saints
[40:11] we did on Saturday night did a a coup's
[40:15] banquet that they had there uh and um
[40:18] then on Sunday morning
[40:20] ministered and uh just had just a a
[40:23] wonderful time in the presence of the
[40:25] Lord so we certainly thank you for your
[40:27] prayers uh coming and going and so we
[40:32] want to begin here in verse 13 of job 23
[40:35] and uh I I want to continue here with
[40:38] our thought here this
[40:41] evening uh also as you're turning I want
[40:43] to remind you of that the fellowship
[40:44] dinner and looking over the email with
[40:47] the details that are in it uh for this
[40:49] coming Sunday uh afternoon or right
[40:53] after service and uh I think some have
[40:56] asked things about you know what do we
[40:58] bring well it's it's a fellowship dinner
[41:00] it's not
[41:01] a maybe the confusion has been because
[41:04] May when we do that event in May that's
[41:06] kind of a planned menu but uh a
[41:09] fellowship dinner you just I think uh
[41:12] it's posted what did did you post that
[41:13] the other day about a main entree and a
[41:17] side dish a drink a dessert and if you
[41:20] have if you don't know what to bring
[41:22] just ask
[41:23] me I pretty much know everybody's
[41:25] specialty I
[41:28] if you need if you're not feeling LED
[41:30] I'll lead
[41:32] you but I just to me I just to be able
[41:35] for us to get together as a I may have
[41:38] certain things I like in foods but just
[41:40] to be able to get together and just to
[41:41] have Fellowship that's to me is what I
[41:43] love and so let's just look to the word
[41:46] of the Lord here in verse 13
[41:49] and the Bible says job said but he is in
[41:53] one mind and who can turn him and what
[41:57] his soul desireth even that he doeth for
[42:01] he performeth the thing that is
[42:03] appointed for me and many such things
[42:07] are with him therefore am I troubled at
[42:10] his presence and when I consider I am
[42:14] afraid of him for God maketh my heart
[42:18] soft and the almighty troubleth me
[42:22] because I was not cut off before the
[42:24] darkness neither have he covered the
[42:27] darkness from my face let me just read
[42:31] this quote while I have you standing
[42:33] here out of the message I have heard but
[42:35] now I see brother Braham said job had
[42:37] something wrong with him but he couldn't
[42:40] get the inspiration on him and it was
[42:43] worrying him and when you get in that
[42:45] kind of a fix that's when the enemy
[42:48] moves into every friend nearly you got
[42:54] and we want to just ask the Lord to
[42:56] bless the word if we could just go to
[42:58] him in a word of prayer Heavenly Father
[43:02] Lord the songs of Zion have been sung
[43:05] Lord how thankful we are for your mercy
[43:08] Lord Lord we thank you Lord for the
[43:11] Assurance as Lord as song after song
[43:14] that we have heard and we have sung lord
[43:17] of the promise Lord that we are walking
[43:20] in and for any moment Lord that God to
[43:23] see our loved ones appear before us Lord
[43:26] and father the assurances you give to us
[43:29] and yet within every step that we made
[43:31] Lord like the special was sung tonight
[43:34] Lord I need you Lord You Are My all
[43:37] sufficiency Lord You're what we have
[43:39] need of Lord from moment to moment Lord
[43:43] we need you father Lord you are our
[43:45] strength you're are the light of our
[43:48] life and we just love you and we
[43:50] appreciate you Lord we always want with
[43:53] every moment Lord to invite you into
[43:55] every moment of our life oh God through
[43:58] every situation Lord we want you to be
[44:01] present Lord we want your leadership
[44:03] Lord we value Lord what you have to say
[44:07] Lord we just ask that you'll come Lord
[44:10] tonight once again and help us as
[44:12] speaker and hearer just Lord to move
[44:15] together as one yielded unit Lord that
[44:17] you might just speak Lord the things
[44:19] that we have need of and help us to hear
[44:22] it Lord as we should hear it father we
[44:24] pray may you heal the that are sick
[44:26] among us Lord in the visible and
[44:28] invisible audience Lord and we thank you
[44:30] for every wonderful report that we've
[44:33] received lord of the needs that we're
[44:34] praying for Lord and just seeing you
[44:36] moving Lord we want to say thank you
[44:39] Lord Jesus we just love you and we
[44:41] praise you now in the name of Jesus
[44:43] Christ amen amen God bless you as you're
[44:46] being seated I want to just continue to
[44:49] take that that thought here tonight and
[44:52] on on why why should I work
[44:57] and when that the question we understand
[45:01] as we were looking at that uh uh some
[45:05] some weeks here we've been a few weeks
[45:06] and looking at this and how that job uh
[45:10] was looking at the situation and he did
[45:13] not have any explanation as to what was
[45:16] taking place and when we find that
[45:19] sometimes if we allow we allow our mind
[45:22] to go then our mind itself we can start
[45:26] to deliberate and think on things and
[45:28] depending on how we're made up it can
[45:29] take you into a place that well we just
[45:32] need the rescue of the Holy Spirit to
[45:34] bring us back onto the right place and
[45:36] looking at things the right way and when
[45:39] we see that within worry I want to read
[45:42] this definition again and I just kept
[45:44] meditating on this throughout the the
[45:46] time since our last service and then
[45:48] even over the weekend here and just
[45:51] looking at this thought on what worry is
[45:53] it's giveway to anxiety or unease it's
[45:58] to allow one's mind to dwell on
[46:01] difficulty or troubles cause annoyance
[46:04] to and cause to feel anxiety or concern
[46:07] and I I want you to notice there's some
[46:09] Key Parts within here is that worry is a
[46:12] giving way to anxiety and to also look
[46:17] at allowing one's mind to dwell on
[46:20] difficulties or troubles and that in
[46:23] itself that that in that's said
[46:26] sometimes depending on our makeup and
[46:27] how things are that in itself can be a
[46:30] challenge but I want you to know that
[46:32] God knows just exactly how each one of
[46:35] us are made up and God already knew that
[46:38] and there's in in your life and my life
[46:41] it's challenging for us but it's not too
[46:43] much of a challenge for God and God is
[46:46] the one who equips us he could come down
[46:49] and there's certain things about you and
[46:51] I that he could completely just change
[46:54] like he did with a new birth but yet the
[46:56] new birth is about the soul the new
[46:59] birth is not about our spirit realm not
[47:01] about that of of the flesh which
[47:03] comprises within there as well but it's
[47:06] to give you and I the strength and the
[47:08] Dominion that we need to be able to rule
[47:11] and reign in our life and bring
[47:13] everything else in order in our life by
[47:16] the spirit of God dwelling within us
[47:19] that's why the Bible could say he that
[47:21] ruleth his spirit is greater greater
[47:24] than he that taketh the City because
[47:27] being able to rule it and to watch over
[47:30] it and so when you look at it worry
[47:32] begins with with a concern now there's
[47:35] things that maybe you have tonight on
[47:37] your heart and have and will you'll have
[47:39] a concern but you know a concern is not
[47:42] a worry but it's when it gives way to
[47:45] anxiety that's when it becomes worry
[47:48] because every one of us like I I
[47:50] referred to you the last time where
[47:51] brother brandham in the message the
[47:53] prodical he says any Godly parent has a
[47:56] Godly worry for their children talking
[47:58] about a concern everyone and brother Bam
[48:01] could say you know even in his own self
[48:02] he said I've got to a place that I've
[48:04] almost had he said two or three
[48:06] breakdowns because of worrying about the
[48:08] condition that I see the church in and
[48:10] seeing the world in he said but I I've
[48:12] had to realize and just get away and
[48:15] commit it all in God's hand that all I
[48:17] can do is my part delivering the word is
[48:20] there a concern yes but it's not
[48:22] something that could should should so
[48:24] bring us to a place of a mental
[48:26] breakdown and that's where we need the
[48:28] help of the Lord is that right within
[48:31] every part of our life and we know that
[48:34] sometimes within these things as it
[48:36] comes down to it in 2 Timothy 1 uh chap
[48:39] 1: 7 I want to come back to the
[48:41] scripture just to remind us for God ha
[48:44] not given us the spirit of fear so
[48:46] anytime there comes a place that's
[48:48] giving over to anxiety that never come
[48:50] from God that never it all begins simple
[48:54] discernment but it's toing remember that
[48:56] never come from God it it's not it's not
[49:00] it's not of God that would bring a fear
[49:02] like that of a torment God hath not
[49:05] given us the spirit of fear but of power
[49:08] and of love and of a sound mind and this
[49:11] is why we we need the discernment of the
[49:13] Holy Spirit by the word of God because
[49:17] like the example we looked at here a few
[49:19] weeks ago when I was ministering on this
[49:21] that like our life itself being a glass
[49:24] filled with water and if I come with a
[49:27] whole handful of ice cubes and I dump it
[49:30] in that water and it's filled to the
[49:32] very top that ice cube is going to cause
[49:35] the water to be displaced and that's
[49:38] exactly what the love of God coming into
[49:40] our life it displaces fears it displaces
[49:45] all of these things because perfect love
[49:47] cast out all fear so it's it's more and
[49:50] the more of God the more of God's love
[49:53] the more of his life it displaces
[49:56] everything else of the world it doesn't
[49:59] have a room in our life and so when we
[50:03] consider it I want you to think how the
[50:05] prophet says it in fundamental
[50:07] foundation for Faith just listen to
[50:09] these statements he says Satan by the
[50:12] laws of sin and death makes everything
[50:14] that sin and death bought operate to
[50:18] Satan sins a cancer the man recognized
[50:21] it and received it Satan sends hard
[50:26] we recognize it and receive it now when
[50:29] he's talking about recognize it brother
[50:31] Brandon was not talking about when a
[50:33] doctor's report or something comes and
[50:35] says well you have uh you have this and
[50:38] we say well no I don't have it no it's
[50:40] like brother bam says and how can I
[50:41] overcome he says this is a direct quote
[50:44] brother Bram you know the doctor said uh
[50:46] they say I got cancer and he said but I
[50:47] say I don't brother Bram said no you do
[50:49] he said but you've got to recognize
[50:51] greater is he that is in you than he
[50:54] that's in the world you say brother
[50:56] Samuel well well isn't that like
[50:58] claiming the box of rattlesnakes not at
[51:00] all I am not going to submit my life to
[51:04] the cancer or submit my life to this
[51:07] this might be something that's in the
[51:09] outer realm but I'm a Believer and I
[51:11] have promises that God has given me as
[51:15] one of his children and I take that
[51:18] promise of a better report above the
[51:21] doctor's
[51:23] report that's where we we can see it but
[51:27] I'm not going to receive it I'm not
[51:29] going to receive it is that right now
[51:32] watch how he goes on it says this this
[51:34] is my I love this message the
[51:36] fundamental foundation for Faith he says
[51:38] if Satan by his power can make his laws
[51:42] work in man how much more ought god with
[51:45] his power make his laws work in man if
[51:49] Satan can make his laws be sure and US
[51:53] recognize it how much more ought God to
[51:56] his children to make his laws be
[51:58] recognized among his people of Divine
[52:01] Healing Revelation power gifts
[52:05] manifestations of the Spirit so Satan
[52:08] has has that of by the laws of sin and
[52:10] death where diseases can come sickness
[52:14] can come fears can come worries can come
[52:17] and we can recognize it and receive it
[52:19] and if that can be the case how Satan
[52:21] can bring it how much greater is it for
[52:25] us to recognize what God is sending and
[52:28] be able to receive that and as we'll
[52:31] receive that it displaces everything
[52:35] that's not of God praise God think about
[52:38] it you know when we look at that of
[52:39] recognizing and receiving I you know
[52:42] it's just simple that you know if
[52:44] somebody seemed a little fishy or a
[52:46] little funny you wouldn't let them in
[52:48] your
[52:49] house come on friends you know how it is
[52:52] sometimes when maybe you pull up to a
[52:54] gas station or or you pull up to I
[52:56] sometimes I've been out and traveling I
[52:58] pull up into a place and you know maybe
[53:00] this is a little Southern for you but
[53:02] when I feel like something's a little
[53:03] shady I'm not getting
[53:06] out I'm aware of my surroundings and it
[53:08] don't matter if you're in the city or
[53:09] you're in the country there's been stuff
[53:11] that's taking place right out here in
[53:13] one of the Cities that's not even right
[53:15] next door not even in Cleveland or any
[53:17] other bigger city you always got to
[53:19] watch your surroundings and know where
[53:20] you're at that's just common
[53:23] sense is that all right right now when
[53:26] I'm saying it in this manner that you
[53:28] would not allow certain things in your
[53:30] house or allow certain things you would
[53:33] quickly dismiss it and that's the same
[53:35] way that when things when Satan wants to
[53:38] bring things to us and that a concern he
[53:42] would like to take a concern that maybe
[53:44] you have on your heart that is a good
[53:46] concern but then he would like to take
[53:49] it and he move it to a place of worry
[53:53] where it robbed you of rest
[53:55] it robs you of sleep and you don't have
[53:58] to be you know a prophet to discern that
[54:01] when sometimes people are you know
[54:03] cranky and upset and you say you didn't
[54:05] get enough sleep either that or those or
[54:08] they'll say you're hangry right you know
[54:11] all of those things come along the way
[54:13] now you you can't sit like angels I I I
[54:15] know better than that but if it doesn't
[54:18] this is what I'm saying is that if
[54:19] things don't pass the test and and and
[54:22] it just is not right then you then we
[54:25] want to be able to say it's not coming
[54:28] according to the word this is not of God
[54:31] and I'm not going to receive it that's
[54:34] right sometimes we we we can be guilty
[54:37] of we ex feel things we experience
[54:40] things and and it's a spirit that wants
[54:42] to come around let me tell you a thought
[54:43] is not just a thought but a thought is a
[54:46] spirit a spirit is trying to give you a
[54:49] thought and if we will entertain it like
[54:51] why did that come to me you happen to be
[54:54] standing there right you happen to be
[54:57] right there and the enemy also knows
[54:59] what God has for you what's coming your
[55:02] way he wants to always try to bring
[55:05] trouble and disturb you of your rest in
[55:09] Christ that's his objective let me just
[55:12] make a side note here this is why when
[55:15] Nehemiah came back there to Israel he
[55:18] never changed the placements of the
[55:20] gates he repaired the gates when gave
[55:25] you the Holy Ghost he never did away
[55:27] with the Gate of imagination the Gate of
[55:29] reasoning but he simply brought them
[55:32] under the rightful control of a son and
[55:35] daughter of God and like Nehemiah could
[55:38] tell those who were coming in and
[55:40] selling fish and other things on the
[55:43] Sabbath day and they were coming in and
[55:45] then when they locked the gates they
[55:47] still stayed outside the gates with
[55:49] their fish carts and everything else and
[55:52] Nehemiah told him you can read this in
[55:53] the scripture he said if you don't get
[55:55] away from the walls I've closed the door
[55:58] but if you don't get away from these
[55:59] walls we're coming after
[56:02] you it's not just enough I've shut him
[56:05] out but there's a moment where we have
[56:07] authority I don't have to sit here and
[56:09] smell fish outside right I don't have to
[56:13] be bothered with that I can there there
[56:15] is there is a God there is an
[56:16] enforcement to make him leave let me
[56:20] tell you something you begin to Worship
[56:22] the Lord you begin to pray sometimes we
[56:25] do we we abandon the things as part of
[56:28] Victory right you begin to worship put
[56:31] on some instrument Oh Brother Sam I'm
[56:32] just so tore up well then does your way
[56:36] work does it work has it work for you
[56:40] but if you're all tore up I'll tell you
[56:42] what it's time to do maybe yeah you do
[56:44] maybe need to get by yourself but put on
[56:46] some instrumental music and just begin
[56:48] to say the Lord is my health the Lord is
[56:51] my strength the Lord is my shield come
[56:54] on now we go to battle there's battles
[56:56] all around us we do not always get to
[56:59] choose where the battle is happening but
[57:01] oh let us be ready when the battle comes
[57:04] to stand there and take the devil to
[57:08] task hallelu Hallelujah brother Samuel I
[57:12] can't sing you're not in the talent show
[57:16] anyhow watch this if Satan's body can be
[57:19] operated by unbelief and doubts and
[57:21] fears will produce what the scripture
[57:24] says it will it'll produce sickness
[57:26] it'll produce disaster it'll produce all
[57:29] those things then people by unbelieving
[57:32] produce that watch this shouldn't people
[57:35] believing with the power of God harness
[57:38] these things and bring them back to
[57:42] correction who's the people to harness
[57:44] these things I'm looking at
[57:46] them and bring them back to correction
[57:49] I'm not talking so much out there I'm
[57:51] talking about right here in our life to
[57:53] be able to harness the the power of God
[57:55] and bringing things back to correction
[57:57] in our own
[57:59] life
[58:01] hallu God is depending on you as a
[58:03] member of his body to bear fruit of his
[58:05] Spirit if he's depending on you let's
[58:08] open up our channels and let the Holy
[58:10] Spirit come in tonight and energize us
[58:12] and free us from all these fears and
[58:16] doubts Revival has come in Romans 8 ver1
[58:21] there is therefore now no condemnation
[58:23] to them which are in Christ Jesus who
[58:25] walk not after the flesh but after the
[58:29] spirit why your desires have been
[58:32] changed there's no longer a desire for
[58:34] the flesh for the world the love of the
[58:36] world is gone your desire is to please
[58:39] him
[58:40] amen for the law of the spirit of life
[58:43] in Christ Jesus hath made me free from
[58:47] the law of sin and death it's a powerful
[58:50] what a powerful reality the same freedom
[58:53] and liberty that that has come to your
[58:55] soul to separate you from doubt and
[58:59] unbelief in God's word and bring a
[59:02] living faith bring a real peace on the
[59:04] inside that same freedom and reality is
[59:09] what you go to battle with when the
[59:11] enemy wants to come against you with
[59:13] fear and
[59:15] worry I'm
[59:18] free I'm
[59:20] free and he who the son has made free
[59:24] set free made free is free indeed you
[59:29] are a new creation in Christ
[59:33] Jesus you've been
[59:35] ordained created unto good works you're
[59:39] ordained for that moment now notice it's
[59:43] just here just for simp simpleness of it
[59:45] out of Acts of the Holy Spirit brother
[59:47] Bram says they desire spiritual things
[59:49] they don't care about the fleshly things
[59:52] my flesh says I'm too tired my spirit
[59:55] says you're not I'm your boss follow me
[59:59] see a case out there and the doctor says
[1:00:02] you know that case can't get well that
[1:00:04] case is gone I look at her and I say
[1:00:06] that's right the case is gone but the
[1:00:09] Holy Ghost comes and gives a vision and
[1:00:12] said it's going to get well then I say
[1:00:16] thus sayith the Lord the man will live
[1:00:19] do you catch what he's saying the doctor
[1:00:21] is saying this case is is is is gone and
[1:00:25] brother BR says well the doctor's saying
[1:00:27] that because that's what they can see
[1:00:29] they can say well I I see what you're
[1:00:31] saying but when the Holy Spirit comes
[1:00:34] when the word is spoken the word is
[1:00:37] above every other
[1:00:41] word and so when the word is spoken we
[1:00:44] no longer walk by the flesh we walk by
[1:00:48] the spirit what God has said is true
[1:00:51] what are we doing recognizing and reing
[1:00:54] in God's
[1:00:56] word and it works to loosen us from fear
[1:00:59] and worry then I say thus sayith the
[1:01:02] Lord the man will live and we don't walk
[1:01:04] after the things of the flesh no more we
[1:01:07] walk after the things of the spirit 1959
[1:01:10] questions and answers brother brm says
[1:01:12] with my mind he's referring to Romans 7
[1:01:14] I have the mind of Christ I serve God
[1:01:17] with my mind but with my flesh he says
[1:01:20] how did he word it but with the flesh
[1:01:22] the law of sin what is it my flesh says
[1:01:25] tonight you're too tired your throat is
[1:01:27] too sore you've been out in the wind
[1:01:29] today you shall not go to church Lord
[1:01:31] have
[1:01:33] mercy don't really sound like that my
[1:01:36] flesh is my
[1:01:38] buddy I give it a nice haircut for all
[1:01:42] five hairs I got I feed it good I rested
[1:01:45] good put a good mattress I have a good
[1:01:47] chair to set in but it ain't against me
[1:01:50] I mean it ain't for
[1:01:52] me almost was against me there
[1:01:55] you've been out in the wind today you
[1:01:57] shall not go to church tonight that's
[1:01:59] the law of the flesh you just might as
[1:02:02] well tell brother Neville send the
[1:02:04] questions down and tell him on the
[1:02:06] inside the holy spirit said you keep
[1:02:08] your promise but the flesh said you're
[1:02:11] too tired what do we got a
[1:02:14] war it depends whether we're going to
[1:02:17] recognize it and receive it right that
[1:02:20] right I think what a what a victory that
[1:02:24] that that has sometimes we underestimate
[1:02:26] the victories of how just pressing over
[1:02:28] and Beyond the flesh to be in the house
[1:02:30] of God to press beyond the victory even
[1:02:33] when we we don't feel like praying and
[1:02:35] we press beyond that and say Lord Here I
[1:02:39] Am Lord you're worthy and you are my
[1:02:41] lover you're are my husband you're
[1:02:43] everything to me Lord you're worthy Lord
[1:02:46] I don't feel like it but you're
[1:02:51] worthy it's just it's little things like
[1:02:54] that
[1:02:55] little things putting that flesh in
[1:02:58] subjection time and time again your
[1:03:01] flesh will never be a cheerleader for
[1:03:05] you I'm telling you if there's one guy
[1:03:08] you don't want with you in a fight you
[1:03:09] don't want that flesh don't ever side up
[1:03:12] with him and take him in a fight he'll
[1:03:14] side with the devil as quicker than
[1:03:18] quick hallu watch it he says my flesh
[1:03:23] wants to yield to that and your flesh
[1:03:25] does
[1:03:26] too wow but the law of the spirit of God
[1:03:30] in the heart overcomes the Flesh and
[1:03:33] makes the body obey what the heart says
[1:03:36] do brother B said if it'll do it for a
[1:03:39] sinner then won't that work for sickness
[1:03:41] too the law of the spirit of God in the
[1:03:44] heart that knows by his stripes we were
[1:03:47] healed they stand with their power to
[1:03:49] make that sickness in that body obey
[1:03:52] them because it's a devil like our
[1:03:54] brother say it say woo that's got cream
[1:03:56] on it that
[1:04:01] deep oh I like that notice he said the
[1:04:05] law of sin and death works in your flesh
[1:04:08] but the law of the spirit of Life Works
[1:04:10] in your heart so your heart your spirit
[1:04:13] and your heart will make your body obey
[1:04:16] what it says do and that's what Paul
[1:04:19] said always the flesh says I'm too tired
[1:04:21] I'm unable I'm not sufficient I can not
[1:04:24] do
[1:04:25] it this is why it's it it takes it's
[1:04:29] more than a mind over matter it takes
[1:04:32] the Holy Spirit coming into your heart
[1:04:34] by way of a new birth to give you
[1:04:38] overcoming
[1:04:39] power it brings a discernment to your
[1:04:43] life that you're recognizing I'm not the
[1:04:46] same person I used to be I am a son I am
[1:04:50] a daughter of God and you can stand
[1:04:52] there with all authority of Heaven
[1:04:55] behind you remember brother Bram said
[1:04:58] that old little policeman he said he
[1:05:00] couldn't stop a runaway Pony but he said
[1:05:03] on that badge that badge itself it says
[1:05:07] that he is a deputy or policeman of a
[1:05:10] certain city and he's got all of that
[1:05:12] City behind him when listen when you
[1:05:15] have God in the midst of your life all
[1:05:18] Heaven is behind
[1:05:21] [Applause]
[1:05:22] you Hallelujah amen this is why in
[1:05:26] Romans 8:15 I love the
[1:05:28] scripture we have not received the
[1:05:31] spirit of bondage again to fear but you
[1:05:35] have received the spirit of adoption
[1:05:39] whereby we cry Abba Father now we don't
[1:05:44] start out with receiving the spirit of
[1:05:46] adoption is the Holy Ghost by the new
[1:05:49] birth but we're not fully matured Sons
[1:05:51] and Daughters of God the moment we're
[1:05:53] born right
[1:05:55] amen are you hearing me now that there
[1:05:58] that's why there is a
[1:06:00] growing it's growing and maturing all
[1:06:03] the way up to the Capstone it's a
[1:06:06] maturing to where it comes to the
[1:06:08] victory in love divine there's a
[1:06:11] maturing in our lives as Sons and
[1:06:14] Daughters of God now I can't preach and
[1:06:16] dwell on that tonight but I just want to
[1:06:18] say it in this way that we understand
[1:06:21] that with that with that understanding
[1:06:23] of the spirit of adoption that's what
[1:06:25] the Holy Ghost is we are placed as Sons
[1:06:27] and Daughters of God we're not going to
[1:06:29] be Sons and Daughters of God we are
[1:06:32] now is that right and we're growing
[1:06:35] we're maturing as the spirit of God
[1:06:37] working in our life we come to
[1:06:39] situations we come to things in our life
[1:06:42] just like test and just like trials no
[1:06:44] other way for our character to be molded
[1:06:46] in our life and any test we fail we have
[1:06:50] to come back and take it
[1:06:52] again because God said said my word
[1:06:55] Can't
[1:06:56] Fail any test that we fail have to come
[1:07:00] back and take it so it's it's a maturing
[1:07:03] in our life maturing and this is why
[1:07:07] that within our lives and our hearts
[1:07:09] this is in the message the prodal the
[1:07:11] prophet says that's what the church
[1:07:13] needs to do today is come to themselves
[1:07:16] to realize who is your father for
[1:07:18] sometimes we act as though we have no
[1:07:21] Heavenly Father for all the goodness of
[1:07:24] Heaven belongs to the church Divine
[1:07:26] Healing salvation freedom from worry or
[1:07:29] anything all belongs to the church Jesus
[1:07:33] died we inherit all that God has through
[1:07:36] him Heirs of the Kingdom we're
[1:07:40] rich so I believe that according to the
[1:07:43] word of God according to the message of
[1:07:45] the hour that we can live free from
[1:07:49] worry praise the Lord does it mean that
[1:07:52] we're never going to experience it
[1:07:53] that's not not what I said but it's
[1:07:55] recognizing who we are as Sons and
[1:07:58] Daughters of God you might say brother
[1:08:00] Samuel I am a newly born baby in Christ
[1:08:03] but you have authority in you that as
[1:08:06] there are things that God brings across
[1:08:08] your life and you recognize wait a
[1:08:11] minute I'm sensing a spirit I'm sensing
[1:08:14] something come in a way and it's not the
[1:08:17] spirit of Christ you have authority as
[1:08:20] you come to that to bring it in the
[1:08:22] presence of your Heavenly Father don't
[1:08:25] try to conquer it on your own bring that
[1:08:27] devil in the presence of the heavenly
[1:08:30] father be like Esther and says come here
[1:08:33] hymon we're going to get you in the
[1:08:35] presence of my king
[1:08:38] hallu glory be to
[1:08:41] God my my my my my my my thank you Lord
[1:08:46] think about this now in the message
[1:08:48] expectation let me just read a few
[1:08:51] places here brother Ram talking about a
[1:08:54] person then is having stomach trouble he
[1:08:56] said go away it won't bother anymore you
[1:08:58] believe that the next part of that he
[1:09:00] says then go and do as I tell you quit
[1:09:05] worrying you're a deep thinker you're
[1:09:07] always taking other people's troubles to
[1:09:10] yourself and Crossing Bridges before you
[1:09:13] get to it you're always planning
[1:09:16] something that never happens quit
[1:09:19] thinking like that be happy and rejoice
[1:09:24] now notice what he said he's went
[1:09:26] through quit worrying now he's getting
[1:09:28] into the problem you're a deep thinker
[1:09:31] you're always taking other people's
[1:09:32] troubles to yourself and Crossing
[1:09:34] Bridges well there's brother Samuel
[1:09:36] what's wrong with that I thought we're a
[1:09:37] body if one suffers we're all to suffer
[1:09:40] if one rejoices we all rejoices that is
[1:09:42] true but what's happening is taking
[1:09:45] other people's problems as though that
[1:09:48] person can solve them when there is a
[1:09:50] problem the greatest thing we can do is
[1:09:53] take it to the Lord in
[1:09:56] prayer and if somebody is in a state of
[1:09:59] worry it's not for us to get become so
[1:10:03] perplexed as trying to change that
[1:10:06] condition right there at that moment but
[1:10:09] let's go to God in prayer and say Lord
[1:10:12] you know where my brother's at you know
[1:10:14] where my sisters at and you know this is
[1:10:16] so real Lord that this is around them
[1:10:19] and they're dwelling on it but Lord May
[1:10:21] the angel of Mercy go right now Lord and
[1:10:24] free them Lord break that veil of worry
[1:10:28] like you did on that Easter morning Lord
[1:10:31] you broke that veil of
[1:10:39] worry he's dealing with the thinking
[1:10:42] quit worrying so he's telling this is
[1:10:45] there's a lot of instruction that's
[1:10:46] being given here you're a deep thinker
[1:10:49] now it isn't alog together that this
[1:10:51] person's going to stop as far as maybe
[1:10:54] being a deep thinker but they've got to
[1:10:56] recognize what they're thinking
[1:10:59] on are you hearing me they got to
[1:11:01] recognize what they're thinking
[1:11:03] on and quit thinking notice quit
[1:11:06] thinking like that be happy and
[1:11:09] rejoice he says it's a peptic ulcer you
[1:11:11] can't help it it makes your food sour
[1:11:13] and everything else in your stomach and
[1:11:15] it cramps you it won't it won't it won't
[1:11:18] it won't hurt you no more go on and eat
[1:11:20] and be happy and rejoice and serve Jesus
[1:11:23] Christ
[1:11:24] in the message the mighty conqueror this
[1:11:26] all
[1:11:27] right in the message the mighty
[1:11:29] conqueror I I just love these places all
[1:11:31] the way through the message here's a
[1:11:33] lady supposedly this is the first time
[1:11:35] we've ever met in life he said now uh he
[1:11:38] says don't be scared quit worrying it'll
[1:11:41] be all right now I want you to watch
[1:11:43] this it'll be all right now you're
[1:11:45] afraid something's going to come up and
[1:11:47] you know what I'm talking about lady I
[1:11:49] won't mention it here but you're scared
[1:11:52] but don't be afraid
[1:11:54] it'll be all right and that which is at
[1:11:56] stake don't worry it'll come out all
[1:11:59] right now brother bham let me go on to
[1:12:01] the second paragraph here he says the
[1:12:03] Lord God Of Heaven revealed to me what
[1:12:05] you're what you're what you're there for
[1:12:07] and what you're praying for will you
[1:12:09] accept it I see that you suffer with a
[1:12:11] lady's trouble it's a female disorder
[1:12:13] and he says I see you cuffed with a
[1:12:15] white sheep they've had an operation for
[1:12:18] the same trouble it just won't heal up
[1:12:20] and that's what you're here for and I
[1:12:22] see it around your arm right now thing
[1:12:23] and you've got low bre blood pressure
[1:12:25] and you're extremely nervous and he said
[1:12:27] you come from this city to this city to
[1:12:29] be prayed for you you've come to be
[1:12:31] prayed that you'd be brought into the
[1:12:32] prayer line in a room near a bed uh in a
[1:12:35] room near a bed that's thus sayith the
[1:12:37] Lord and I see you live leave the city
[1:12:38] Rockford Illinois go back and believe
[1:12:41] and you'll get well God be merciful now
[1:12:44] I want I want you to take your back Bri
[1:12:45] would you go to that first paragraph
[1:12:47] that I read there uh and I want you to
[1:12:49] catch this right here here she is she's
[1:12:53] she is worrying about something that is
[1:12:57] coming up there is a trouble that's
[1:12:59] going on she's had an operation and with
[1:13:02] that operation and and and and it just
[1:13:04] hadn't healed
[1:13:07] ight now I know right here sitting here
[1:13:11] tonight there's been different ones
[1:13:13] that's had operations and procedures and
[1:13:16] things don't always
[1:13:17] go as it was
[1:13:20] planned and I know that I know that from
[1:13:23] just
[1:13:24] just just these things and sometimes
[1:13:26] when things don't go as and the doctors
[1:13:29] can only give what they lay out we pray
[1:13:31] and we're praying and looking to the
[1:13:33] Lord and you know with everything within
[1:13:35] healing but sometimes when things don't
[1:13:37] go just exactly how it is never forget
[1:13:40] my wife and they put a stin in her for a
[1:13:42] kidney stone that was right after my
[1:13:44] father went home to be with the Lord a
[1:13:45] couple weeks and uh they you know she
[1:13:48] had some kidney stones in there and I
[1:13:50] always said if you know if we were had
[1:13:51] them for all the kidney Stones she had
[1:13:53] were diamonds we'd be very rich and uh
[1:13:56] they had kidney stones that they they
[1:13:58] could there's no way you weren't going
[1:13:59] to blast them or get them out or do
[1:14:00] anything else and so they had to go up
[1:14:02] in there you know and they put a stint
[1:14:04] in and sometimes with those stints some
[1:14:06] people do pretty good and sometimes they
[1:14:07] don't and she I never forget you know
[1:14:10] has he come into a place and man she had
[1:14:12] a reaction to that stin now she's
[1:14:14] already experienced a relief from those
[1:14:16] kidney stones coming out and being know
[1:14:18] and having that relief from you know the
[1:14:20] pain and things that she was in but then
[1:14:23] when things itself she was longer in the
[1:14:26] hospital recovering from that stint
[1:14:28] being put in than it was because she had
[1:14:30] a reaction not everybody does but she
[1:14:32] had a reaction it was she was longer in
[1:14:34] the hospital than she was on the other
[1:14:37] and sometimes when things don't go
[1:14:38] exactly how we thought they should go
[1:14:41] there can be a tendency to become very
[1:14:45] concerned is that right brother Samuel
[1:14:48] what does that mean you're
[1:14:51] human that's what it means it means
[1:14:53] means you're still walking in a human
[1:14:55] Temple that's what it means it don't
[1:14:57] mean that you've got weakness of faith
[1:14:59] it means you're still here in a body but
[1:15:02] you see we can't we can't stop even
[1:15:04] within those things and how that that
[1:15:06] may be coming but we can take it to the
[1:15:09] Lord in prayer we have a place that we
[1:15:13] can go as we said the last time and let
[1:15:15] off the pressure we have a place in him
[1:15:19] and this is what the prophet I want you
[1:15:20] to catch this last statement he said
[1:15:22] don't be scared don't you're scared but
[1:15:25] don't be afraid it'll be all right and
[1:15:27] that which is at stake don't worry it'll
[1:15:30] come out all right now what's he telling
[1:15:32] her he he didn't you know with what what
[1:15:34] has been said she she is in worry and
[1:15:37] the concern that you know is there
[1:15:39] within her body and that by the doctor
[1:15:41] and you know the nervousness and all the
[1:15:44] possibilities that it could be when is
[1:15:46] this going to be over and I've had the
[1:15:48] surgery I've had the operation I had all
[1:15:50] this but notice don't be worried at what
[1:15:53] what's at stake it's going to come out
[1:15:55] all right you see it's it's come a word
[1:15:59] and let me just tell you this right now
[1:16:01] you and I these quotes that I'm reading
[1:16:03] and some others I'll read tonight this
[1:16:05] is an example you might say brother
[1:16:07] brandom's not here but the same Angel of
[1:16:09] the Lord that directed The Prophet and
[1:16:12] showed that he cared it was God took a
[1:16:15] vessel a vessel of clay to show you that
[1:16:18] he's just as much God and he cares about
[1:16:21] your situation where the enemy thinks
[1:16:24] he's going to take you to a place of
[1:16:26] worry and fret and fear and anxiety
[1:16:29] there is still the angel of the Lord to
[1:16:33] come between you and those Egyptians
[1:16:36] that are trying to overtake
[1:16:38] you
[1:16:40] Hallelujah he's still the same almighty
[1:16:43] God the prophet's Ministry was to
[1:16:45] declare he is here to introduce us to
[1:16:49] Jesus Christ to unite us to the Living
[1:16:51] God in a real true Union with him and I
[1:16:55] can tell you though the prophet has left
[1:16:57] the scene he fulfilled exactly what God
[1:16:59] asked him to do and we are united with
[1:17:02] Christ
[1:17:05] himself we're not
[1:17:08] deficient I say it like this the
[1:17:10] prophecy is no longer prophecy it's
[1:17:13] being
[1:17:16] manifest Hallelujah you think the
[1:17:18] prophet him looking over I believe God
[1:17:20] lets him look over the banner of time
[1:17:23] the prophet told us how even a mama can
[1:17:25] look over the banner of time when her
[1:17:26] boys are being baptized to see them
[1:17:28] answers of prayer I wonder if the
[1:17:30] prophet looking over the banner of time
[1:17:31] and seeing no it's no longer prophecy
[1:17:34] this word is no longer laying on tapes
[1:17:37] and books it's no longer just contained
[1:17:40] within letter but it's become flesh
[1:17:43] there's a people who know their
[1:17:47] God hallelujah I don't know what kind of
[1:17:50] spell he has over there right now I
[1:17:52] don't know but
[1:17:54] I know what it does to me what I see in
[1:17:56] my own life and see it taking place in
[1:17:58] the lives of others I know what it
[1:18:00] does now let me read out of the
[1:18:02] Amplified at Philippians 4 let's look at
[1:18:04] a little bit of here of application and
[1:18:08] I just the reason I'm reading on
[1:18:09] Amplified so I don't have to Define
[1:18:10] every word as I just kind of pair it and
[1:18:12] look at that notice in verse six
[1:18:15] remember the Bible says be careful for
[1:18:17] nothing how many remember that that's
[1:18:18] the scripture that word be careful for
[1:18:20] nothing means don't be anxious about
[1:18:22] anything right that's one of the things
[1:18:25] even when I've I've talked with others
[1:18:26] and talked with our boys I said let me
[1:18:28] tell you if you begin to feel anxious
[1:18:29] about a decision
[1:18:31] stop stop because the spirit of God the
[1:18:34] spirit of truth will never bring
[1:18:36] anxiousness upon
[1:18:38] you never it won't work that way even
[1:18:40] when it comes to altar calls that's not
[1:18:42] how he works because that's fear that's
[1:18:44] torment the spirit of God draws you in
[1:18:47] love it bring conviction it lets you see
[1:18:49] where you're standing but it'll let you
[1:18:50] see that there is a God who is present
[1:18:53] to take care of your need and your
[1:18:55] situation is that right my how do we get
[1:18:59] there Philippians 4:6 do not fret I like
[1:19:03] that or have anxiety about anything but
[1:19:06] in every circumstance this is what's
[1:19:08] important in every circumstance and in
[1:19:11] everything by prayer and petition
[1:19:14] definite request with Thanksgiving you
[1:19:17] notice in the scripture when you read
[1:19:19] about prayer it'll talk
[1:19:21] about praying and it'll talk about
[1:19:25] supplication supplication it those words
[1:19:28] go right together you know before Isaac
[1:19:31] ever asked God about intreating Rebecca
[1:19:34] for a child he began just to worship him
[1:19:37] in prayer hallu see prayer starts with a
[1:19:39] worship right it's worshiping and as you
[1:19:43] come into His presence then you begin to
[1:19:44] make your petitions the request you have
[1:19:47] on your heart the things that you are
[1:19:50] experiencing now I'm just going to say
[1:19:51] this to you in this way way I I believe
[1:19:53] that there is an openness of us making
[1:19:56] our petition known to the Lord but let
[1:19:57] me just many of you probably already
[1:19:59] applied this but let me just tell you a
[1:20:01] little secret here that Satan if he
[1:20:04] knows that he's wearing you out and
[1:20:06] getting to
[1:20:07] you and you begin to talk to the Lord
[1:20:09] Lord I'm just being worn out and Satan
[1:20:11] is knocking me left and right then Satan
[1:20:13] knows he's getting to you but you know
[1:20:16] what you can go to him and just say Lord
[1:20:18] I love you and remember it's not the
[1:20:21] words out here that is hearing right
[1:20:23] here your
[1:20:25] heart and there's a channel between you
[1:20:27] and God that Satan can't put his dirty
[1:20:29] feet in he can't tap in wir tap he can't
[1:20:33] break it amen right the DIA like the CIA
[1:20:37] the devil investigating agency cannot
[1:20:39] break into that channel cannot wir
[1:20:43] tap Hallelujah no
[1:20:45] sir you see this is why this is why the
[1:20:48] prophet said in the seven seal he said
[1:20:50] if I have it in my heart Satan can't get
[1:20:52] it
[1:20:53] amen because he said when I let it out
[1:20:55] you know how it is if and yes there's
[1:20:57] times Brother s I'm feeling down well
[1:20:59] trip him up a little bit and you say
[1:21:01] Lord thank you for today Lord thank you
[1:21:05] for your mercies Lord that takes some
[1:21:07] overcoming I I said that takes some
[1:21:09] overcoming Amen Brother Sam that takes
[1:21:11] some overcome Amen Brother Sam that
[1:21:13] takes some
[1:21:15] overcoming sometimes we're walking
[1:21:17] around the devil said good Lord I
[1:21:18] thought her had her all worried and
[1:21:20] wearied and down and everything else and
[1:21:23] what in the world you walking around and
[1:21:24] saying thank you Jesus thank you Lord
[1:21:26] for your mercy today thank you Lord for
[1:21:28] your grace that's kept me in my right
[1:21:32] mind well the devil ain't going to stay
[1:21:34] around no praise and worship I'll tell
[1:21:35] you that
[1:21:37] much but you know you can make your
[1:21:39] petitions known to him from your heart
[1:21:42] he hears your heart you can be sitting
[1:21:44] right in class and talking to the Lord
[1:21:46] in your heart and God hears your heart
[1:21:49] sitting there taking a test say Lord
[1:21:51] give me Grace right now in this moment
[1:21:53] and the Holy Spirit is right there to
[1:21:55] guide you ain't that right absolutely
[1:21:58] it's a it's a connection between us and
[1:22:00] God when the prophet when his wife was
[1:22:02] all tore up in her house brother Brown
[1:22:04] never prayed out loud he just put the
[1:22:06] apron on and in his heart he prayed Lord
[1:22:09] quieten my wife Lord quieten this home
[1:22:11] Lord do this and just praying in his
[1:22:14] heart for her while talking about the
[1:22:16] dress down the street while talking
[1:22:18] about maybe going out for supper and
[1:22:20] talking about all of that he was praying
[1:22:22] in her heart to change the
[1:22:27] atmosphere you can just say Sorry Devil
[1:22:31] you're blocked from this
[1:22:35] conversation so I maybe that maybe some
[1:22:38] of youve already done that but I I'm
[1:22:40] just telling you sometimes when we start
[1:22:41] we let things out then the devil knows
[1:22:43] how to get up on us and start pouring it
[1:22:45] on
[1:22:46] us Oh Brother Sam I'm just TR you're
[1:22:48] telling me to act when I I feel down
[1:22:50] you're just telling me to be an actor
[1:22:51] Hey listen there there ain't nothing
[1:22:53] wrong with the joy in your soul
[1:22:54] sometimes we get weary in our spirit and
[1:22:56] in our mind but that don't have nothing
[1:22:57] to do with your soul you have a joy that
[1:23:00] the world didn't give and the world
[1:23:02] can't take it away you've got a joy that
[1:23:04] brings a real worship and your feet may
[1:23:07] not be gone you may not be running but
[1:23:09] you've got to worship because you know
[1:23:11] I'm free I'm free there is no holds on
[1:23:14] me and then every once in a while them
[1:23:17] feet will get to going depending on how
[1:23:18] you're made
[1:23:20] up sometimes you may have to get down an
[1:23:22] aisle that nobody goes in
[1:23:26] woo oh my continue to make your wants
[1:23:30] known to God and look at this in verse 7
[1:23:32] and God's peace shall be yours that
[1:23:35] tranquil state of a soul assured of its
[1:23:38] salvation through Christ and so fearing
[1:23:40] nothing from God and being content with
[1:23:43] its Earthly lot of whatever sort that is
[1:23:46] that peace which transcends all
[1:23:50] understanding shall Garrison you know
[1:23:52] what a Garrison
[1:23:54] is ah I like putting you on the
[1:23:58] spot it's sharp guy Garrison it's a
[1:24:03] fortress when when you take your
[1:24:05] petitions and you put them to the Lord
[1:24:07] in prayer then as you've committed that
[1:24:10] to God In Prayer then there comes a
[1:24:11] Garrison Hallelujah around your life it
[1:24:16] there's a
[1:24:16] protection that when the enemy though
[1:24:20] you haven't received the answer and the
[1:24:22] enemy wants to Buffet you and come
[1:24:25] against you and try to take concern over
[1:24:28] into worry you've got a Garrison that
[1:24:31] holds you and Is Watching Over
[1:24:34] You Lord It's garrisoned with prayer
[1:24:37] notice Garrison and mount guard over
[1:24:40] your hearts and Minds in Christ Jesus
[1:24:43] praise the Lord I would read Philippians
[1:24:45] 4:8 let me just move on here for a
[1:24:48] moment think of this Christ himself is
[1:24:51] our way
[1:24:53] worry itself is the opposite of faith is
[1:24:57] that right worry said this is what worry
[1:25:00] is saying that I'm responsible for
[1:25:03] controlling the events in my
[1:25:06] life Bud I tell you brother Aron I don't
[1:25:08] want that man when you start looking at
[1:25:10] it that way worry says that I'm
[1:25:12] responsible for controlling the events
[1:25:14] of my life Lord have
[1:25:16] mercy we're doing good to take the roast
[1:25:18] out of the oven at the right
[1:25:21] time the those that are real and those
[1:25:23] that are conjured up in our mind worry I
[1:25:26] like this does not give a place for God
[1:25:31] in the
[1:25:33] equation that's what worry does it says
[1:25:37] it's trying it's all this is the bridge
[1:25:39] has been built and man we're it's like
[1:25:41] we're the ones that's in control of our
[1:25:42] destiny we're not the ones we didn't
[1:25:44] even find
[1:25:46] ourselves God came and found
[1:25:49] us we were alienated we were in enemies
[1:25:53] in our
[1:25:54] mind but he came to us and found
[1:25:59] us hallelujah if we would have been in
[1:26:02] control of our destiny think of it look
[1:26:04] at the mess that we made just in a
[1:26:06] little bit of time we had but now my
[1:26:10] life is not in my hands my life your
[1:26:13] life is in God's
[1:26:15] [Applause]
[1:26:17] hands and you know what with every
[1:26:20] situation I don't know about you I'm not
[1:26:22] a sharp guy when it comes to math and
[1:26:24] all those other things but I do know
[1:26:26] this when you put God in the equation
[1:26:28] amen look
[1:26:30] out look out because you know what God
[1:26:34] putting God in the equation will do
[1:26:35] it'll take out and isolate other
[1:26:38] variables it'll begin to isolate other
[1:26:41] things in there when you put God in the
[1:26:44] equation and realize I'm not the one who
[1:26:46] controls the future my life is in his
[1:26:49] hands is that right you know so it's
[1:26:52] it's us looking to the Lord cuz worry
[1:26:55] you know worry itself is like a place
[1:26:57] where you just all you do is look for
[1:26:59] trouble look for shard you know like
[1:27:02] shards of jagged edged dreams falling to
[1:27:04] the ground and but God don't see you
[1:27:07] like that God said I I I know the
[1:27:10] thoughts I got concerning you thoughts
[1:27:12] of peace to bring you to an expected end
[1:27:15] I know the plans that I have concerning
[1:27:17] your
[1:27:17] life and worry is not a part of
[1:27:21] it
[1:27:26] hallelujah oh my don't you love him I
[1:27:29] tell you man I love these things oh I
[1:27:32] love them I love them Bria go to that
[1:27:33] message the resurrection of Jesus
[1:27:36] 1956 notice what brother Brown says he
[1:27:38] says when you're discouraged that's when
[1:27:40] the devil can really pour it on you
[1:27:42] that's when he gets you if you come to
[1:27:43] search and say I don't know I don't know
[1:27:45] whether I ever get any better or not
[1:27:47] I've been prayed for twice you might as
[1:27:49] well go home that's all but when you can
[1:27:51] cast that side now I want to to stop
[1:27:53] here a minute if that has come to you
[1:27:55] here's the authority he didn't say go
[1:27:58] ahead and get back in your car but if
[1:28:00] you're going to let that attitude
[1:28:02] remain then you might as well go back
[1:28:04] home but when you can recognize as a son
[1:28:07] and daughter of God those thoughts are
[1:28:09] coming but I'm casting it aside what are
[1:28:12] you doing you're acting like your father
[1:28:15] he cast out Satan in the
[1:28:18] beginning God don't want you to be
[1:28:20] frowning God want you to be happy the
[1:28:23] human heart was made to be happy worry
[1:28:25] will cause cancer temper will cause
[1:28:28] cancer don't never be upset just walk in
[1:28:31] his love that last phrase is the key
[1:28:33] just walk in his love cuz you could say
[1:28:37] don't do this and don't do this and
[1:28:38] don't do that just get a bunch of ice
[1:28:40] cubes and put it in the glass of water
[1:28:42] let it be divine love coming down lord
[1:28:44] just more of your love let it displace
[1:28:46] those things then it didn't well I got
[1:28:48] to be nice or I can't hold a grudge and
[1:28:50] you know I can't be Pride ful and you
[1:28:52] know I got to be patient and I got to
[1:28:54] throw away all the records of everybody
[1:28:56] ever done me any wrong no just just say
[1:28:58] God I need more of your love I need more
[1:29:01] of your love it's not us trying to 50
[1:29:03] steps to be a better lovely person we
[1:29:06] just need more of him when you feel
[1:29:09] yourself getting a little loose like the
[1:29:11] prophet said a little slack he said
[1:29:13] reach down and tighten up the
[1:29:18] Buckle knowing here's that is knowing
[1:29:21] that you're walking in him and nothing
[1:29:22] can harm you there's nothing can harm
[1:29:24] you neither Powers present things future
[1:29:26] nothing can separate us from him we're
[1:29:28] in him and we never come in by our own
[1:29:31] will he by choice elected us and brought
[1:29:35] us into him I love this statement so
[1:29:37] it's his business to take care of what
[1:29:41] he's took himself right hey God know
[1:29:43] what he was getting into when he got a
[1:29:46] hold of me he knew what he was getting
[1:29:49] into when he got a hold of you and it's
[1:29:51] his business to take care of what he's
[1:29:53] took for
[1:29:54] himself you believe thatall so Lord help
[1:29:59] me Lord if I could just just let this be
[1:30:01] so captured in my life it displaces
[1:30:04] worry oh my Branda go on down here to
[1:30:08] Psalms
[1:30:10] 139:14 let me just I'm going to I want
[1:30:12] to make a turn here and then we'll close
[1:30:14] into some things we'll look at in coming
[1:30:16] Services let me make a
[1:30:19] turn how many know God's he's a faithful
[1:30:23] parent there's things that no doubt that
[1:30:25] you and me alike that I would if if I
[1:30:28] would have known that I was going to go
[1:30:30] through it ahead of time maybe even when
[1:30:33] things come up I would be sitting there
[1:30:35] and say Lord I don't want to go through
[1:30:36] that I don't want to go through that I
[1:30:38] don't want to go through that but see
[1:30:40] God being a faithful parent he doesn't
[1:30:43] pamper us he doesn't say oh you don't
[1:30:46] want to go through that oh that's okay
[1:30:48] well let's let's just hold you back here
[1:30:50] you you don't want to go through that
[1:30:51] see God don't ask ask us that God don't
[1:30:53] ask us that as a faithful parent now if
[1:30:57] you can allow the Holy Spirit to apply
[1:30:59] it to our lives even as natural parents
[1:31:01] there's things that even how that being
[1:31:03] of a faithful parent but yet he makes us
[1:31:06] he guides us through the things that are
[1:31:09] uncomfortable in life he guides us
[1:31:12] through the hard things in life I mean
[1:31:15] you all know as parents there's things
[1:31:16] that your children have gone through yes
[1:31:19] and you were ready to
[1:31:23] take care of business in certain
[1:31:26] aspects
[1:31:27] right you're going to lay hands on them
[1:31:30] in a Christian way you know you know but
[1:31:33] you realize because what that part of a
[1:31:35] parent can rise up and then there's
[1:31:37] parts of said I don't want this or I
[1:31:39] don't want that but you see God he knows
[1:31:41] what's best for us he knows that there's
[1:31:44] elements of things that our character
[1:31:46] must needs be exposed to and molded and
[1:31:49] shaped because he knows what he has has
[1:31:52] for us down the line is that right he
[1:31:54] knows that and there's things like I
[1:31:56] said you would have and I would have
[1:31:58] just like if your kids or your parents
[1:32:00] hey hey I don't want I don't want this I
[1:32:01] don't want to do that I don't want to do
[1:32:02] this and you understand keep it all in
[1:32:04] context but God is faithful there to
[1:32:07] guide us through all the Affairs of this
[1:32:09] life CU he don't abandon us he don't
[1:32:12] abandon us he said he'd never leave us
[1:32:13] nor forsake us so God don't abandon us
[1:32:16] God won't just send us out and abandon
[1:32:18] us he's there to guide us now I want you
[1:32:20] to notice this scripture here in Psalms
[1:32:22] 139:14 I will praise thee for I am
[1:32:25] fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous
[1:32:29] are thy works and my soul knoweth right
[1:32:34] well God knows exactly how he has made
[1:32:38] every one of us up he knows all those
[1:32:41] characteristics even of all those things
[1:32:43] that have come all the way down through
[1:32:45] the fall now Bri if you don't mind skip
[1:32:47] down to 1951 at Thy word just skip over
[1:32:50] those other quotes and watch watch
[1:32:52] within this how a person can be made up
[1:32:55] brother brandham I didn't read the quote
[1:32:56] to you probably will next week brother
[1:32:57] Bram said one of the greatest studies
[1:32:59] I've ever done is on human behavior is
[1:33:01] being able to just just understand and
[1:33:04] you say brother Samuel that that don't
[1:33:05] sound exactly right well God said he
[1:33:07] knows his Sheep by name God knows every
[1:33:11] one of us by name that's why I remember
[1:33:15] when brother Billy Paul was standing
[1:33:16] there and he'd listen to his dad going
[1:33:17] through the questions and answers and
[1:33:19] he'd see a certain thing and see a
[1:33:20] certain way God knows everything one of
[1:33:22] us even in every one of us about even
[1:33:24] our
[1:33:26] makeup is that right now
[1:33:31] watch y'all look at me funny Brianna go
[1:33:34] back up to 1953 how the angel came to me
[1:33:37] I Don't Leave Nobody hanging I know you
[1:33:39] trust me but 1953 how the angel came to
[1:33:41] me it's been one of the most amazing
[1:33:44] things that I have noticed along the
[1:33:45] lines of Ministry for our lord Jesus is
[1:33:48] the peculiarity of people and and the
[1:33:52] study of human life is one of the
[1:33:54] greatest things that a person can study
[1:33:56] to watch the nature of
[1:33:59] people why there's differences even in
[1:34:02] the way we worship God don't want
[1:34:03] everybody worshiping the same even the
[1:34:06] way we worship everything the way we do
[1:34:08] it it's all based on the
[1:34:10] peculiarities my Lord I remember when I
[1:34:12] I stood there you know with the brothers
[1:34:13] and sisters in Africa and Ghana I mean
[1:34:15] man I mean there was a place from here
[1:34:17] to the pull pit out there to maybe where
[1:34:18] brother Shane and sister Lily this was
[1:34:20] the front of the church it was wide open
[1:34:22] and when we got done we got done you
[1:34:24] know with the preaching and man they
[1:34:26] were they were happy and they were out
[1:34:27] there dancing they were dancing what'
[1:34:29] you do got right out there and danced
[1:34:30] with them CU I was happy I was thankful
[1:34:33] even though I had been the one you know
[1:34:34] ministering what the Lord had brought to
[1:34:36] us but I mean here they were out dancing
[1:34:38] and all these everything I'll tell you
[1:34:40] they were
[1:34:41] happy it was
[1:34:43] peculiarities but God don't want us to
[1:34:46] go and say we have to do that
[1:34:49] here that's peculiarities
[1:34:52] now at Thy
[1:34:54] word oh I know some of y'all would have
[1:34:56] a problem with that that's why you stay
[1:34:57] on American
[1:35:00] soil 1951 at TH word everybody all right
[1:35:04] how do you do sister you're type of
[1:35:07] person that's once believing you believe
[1:35:11] kind of hard for you to see it you do a
[1:35:13] lot of worrying about things cross
[1:35:15] Bridges before you get to them build
[1:35:18] castles that never come to pass cuse
[1:35:22] that's your
[1:35:24] nature oh but if you believe me as God's
[1:35:28] Prophet The Diabetes will leave you you
[1:35:29] can go home and be well and he goes on
[1:35:32] and pronounces the healing now he talks
[1:35:34] in the message 1955 the True Vine and a
[1:35:37] false Vine he's talking about a brother
[1:35:39] is's having a stomach condition peptic
[1:35:41] ulcer and all these things at the bottom
[1:35:43] of your stomach in that second paragraph
[1:35:45] he says you're a person of deep thinking
[1:35:49] you're always Crossing bridges for you
[1:35:52] get to it planning things that never
[1:35:56] happen that's your
[1:35:59] nature in your stomach you're healed go
[1:36:03] get yourself a supper and eat it think a
[1:36:06] will because your faith has made you
[1:36:09] whole notice that's your
[1:36:12] nature over and over when the prophet
[1:36:16] would deal with certain situations the
[1:36:18] nature or the makeup of the person
[1:36:21] that's what was even the nervousness
[1:36:23] even some of these conditions is what
[1:36:25] would cause it was because of their
[1:36:28] makeup now did that mean that all of a
[1:36:30] sudden their nature or their makeup and
[1:36:32] all of that was going to be changed no
[1:36:36] but God would help them and deliver them
[1:36:39] from that condition they were in and
[1:36:41] they had to recognize every time that
[1:36:44] that Spirit would come I'm not going to
[1:36:46] let it rain in my
[1:36:49] life L's stand
[1:37:04] Brandon can you go down that last quote
[1:37:06] there 1955 the presence of the Lord
[1:37:08] Jesus I think that's the last one
[1:37:11] yeah well not the last one but the last
[1:37:13] one I want to
[1:37:16] do watch brother BM says you've been
[1:37:18] standing here all your life you've been
[1:37:20] nervous
[1:37:22] you're not a nervous person that shakes
[1:37:25] but you're a nervous person by thinking
[1:37:27] you're always pre-planning things going
[1:37:29] ahead planning things ahead and it
[1:37:32] usually never happens that
[1:37:34] way we call it Crossing Bridges before
[1:37:37] you get to them in doing that you formed
[1:37:41] a stomach trouble can't you see
[1:37:44] how Satan is so
[1:37:47] vile that he would take of even how a
[1:37:50] person you said Brother Sam but what's
[1:37:51] the value of a person getting things on
[1:37:55] their heart and and with even planning
[1:37:58] on it remember brother Bram took sister
[1:38:01] Bruce and sister Bruce would sometimes
[1:38:03] she could get in such a fix she was
[1:38:05] looking at I I I don't even know whether
[1:38:06] I got the holy ghost or not and brother
[1:38:08] Bram took it to her and he said now
[1:38:10] here's what it is Sister he says this is
[1:38:13] the way you're made up you're kind of a
[1:38:14] nervous person you get somebody on your
[1:38:16] mind you got to pray for them you can't
[1:38:18] rest until you go pray for them he said
[1:38:21] Satan will take that on the other side
[1:38:24] and he'll put something in your mind and
[1:38:25] you must solve it
[1:38:29] out and it starts down a
[1:38:32] pathway so it's God will use how he's
[1:38:37] made us remember brother brandham he he
[1:38:39] couldn't understand the rest of the rest
[1:38:40] of the brothers man they're shooting
[1:38:41] squirrels just anywhere and killing but
[1:38:44] he puts a gun down against the tree cuz
[1:38:46] he ain't hitting them through the eye
[1:38:48] and he puts it down and starts crying
[1:38:49] Lord why did you make me this way
[1:38:52] way and what was what was the response
[1:38:54] from the angel of the Lord I made you
[1:38:56] this way for a
[1:39:00] purpose so it's things that if we can
[1:39:03] look at it and say Lord I don't want to
[1:39:05] complain but help me to yield help me to
[1:39:09] yield my every channel to you he said
[1:39:11] Brother Sam how do I yield that just
[1:39:13] stay in fellowship with him you stay in
[1:39:15] fellowship with him you're ready like
[1:39:18] one of the Minute Men when this
[1:39:20] Revolutionary War took place you're
[1:39:21] always ready you're ready you're ready
[1:39:23] you're yielded when you're staying in
[1:39:24] step with him just just staying in
[1:39:26] prayer staying in the word staying in
[1:39:28] Fellowship walking in love thank you
[1:39:30] Lord for your mercy notice he says it's
[1:39:33] formed a stomach trouble it's an ulcer
[1:39:35] in your stomach it's
[1:39:36] nervousness now you quit being nervous
[1:39:39] watch this I love this there's no need
[1:39:42] of being nervous Jesus is with
[1:39:46] you I like that that's simple ain't it
[1:39:49] why should I quit being n nervous Jesus
[1:39:51] is with you that's why now go on your
[1:39:55] road rejoicing thanking God and praising
[1:39:57] him and you'll get completely well in
[1:39:59] the name of Jesus
[1:40:01] Christ what a
[1:40:03] place may God help
[1:40:05] us and give us
[1:40:08] Grace to be able to recognize when a
[1:40:12] concern
[1:40:13] comes and take it to the Lord in
[1:40:16] prayer instead of dwelling on
[1:40:19] troubles which can be our tendency
[1:40:21] depend on how you're made up depending
[1:40:23] on how how you're made
[1:40:26] up but if we can take the concerns that
[1:40:29] we have and take them to God in prayer
[1:40:32] and say Lord you know the need right
[1:40:37] now then that's where the peace of God
[1:40:39] can move to Garris in our life give us
[1:40:43] strength give us a peace to where then
[1:40:46] it doesn't turn into a worry everybody
[1:40:50] knows what that feels like when you a
[1:40:52] concern becomes a worry it's like you're
[1:40:55] you're standing there I mean I had it
[1:40:57] when I taught school you could sit there
[1:40:59] and all of a sudden you're you're in the
[1:41:00] middle of something and you don't even
[1:41:01] know what in the world you're
[1:41:02] saying you don't know what you're saying
[1:41:05] and you think and somebody else can be
[1:41:06] talking to you and you think wait minut
[1:41:08] what was that you just said and it it
[1:41:10] just stays with you throughout the day
[1:41:12] you you you find yourself in just a a
[1:41:14] moment and somebody else might be
[1:41:15] talking to you and you find yourself
[1:41:17] drift and here you are in a place
[1:41:21] of worry it is absolutely dominating
[1:41:26] moments in your
[1:41:28] life and I I want to tell you there's a
[1:41:31] place that you can
[1:41:33] go there's a place that you can go and
[1:41:36] you can take that to if you're in him
[1:41:38] you can take it to him if you're outside
[1:41:40] of him you can take your life to him and
[1:41:41] say Lord I am putting my life in your
[1:41:47] hands and when you've done that then
[1:41:50] other things things that come up things
[1:41:52] that arise you can rest to know he holds
[1:41:55] my tomorrow he is my brother Samuel is
[1:41:58] it really that simple try it and see
[1:42:02] well I've tried that no but if you
[1:42:04] really believe and say Lord I commit my
[1:42:07] life my all into your hands Lord I Lord
[1:42:12] am no longer going to try to figure out
[1:42:14] my own way make sense of everything else
[1:42:17] around me I cast my care
[1:42:21] on you for you care for
[1:42:25] me you believe that tonight no matter
[1:42:28] where you're at no matter the situation
[1:42:30] nobody is without hope no one here or in
[1:42:34] the invisible audience we have a place
[1:42:37] of Refuge in Jesus
[1:42:40] Christ let's go to him in
[1:42:43] prayer Heavenly
[1:42:47] Father
[1:42:49] Lord thank you for your mercies
[1:42:52] Lord thank you Lord that in the midst of
[1:42:56] moments and times all the way down
[1:42:58] Through the Ages Lord your children have
[1:43:01] faced and battled through fears worries
[1:43:06] things would Lord that would desire to
[1:43:08] come or Satan would try to take things
[1:43:12] that can be Lord natural or normal
[1:43:15] concerns Lord as we begin to deliberate
[1:43:17] on them and think about them and
[1:43:19] entertain this
[1:43:21] entertain that and pretty soon Lord it
[1:43:25] turns into anxiety that's what worry
[1:43:28] would begin to
[1:43:29] worry now Lord you you haven't come here
[1:43:32] tonight in any of these services to
[1:43:35] shame us that's that's not how you

[1:44:03] no certainty with them Lord of where
[1:44:05] they would be standing if you were to
[1:44:07] come in the next moment but Lord Jesus
