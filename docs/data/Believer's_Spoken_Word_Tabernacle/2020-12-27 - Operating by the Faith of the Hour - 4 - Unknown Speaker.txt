precious lonely hour you see jesus he let me know that i was on aren't you glad oh yes through it all through it all through it all oh yes i've learned to trust in jesus and i've learned a trusting god oh yes i like this verse right here so i thank god for my mountains oh i thank him for all my valleys oh yes i thank him for all the storms that he's brought me through you see if i would never have a problem church i just wouldn't know that my god could solve them oh yes i wouldn't know what faith in the word of god [Music] god singing through let's all stand this morning let's all stand oh yes through it all oh yes his word oh so i thank god for all the mountains i thank you for all the storms that you brought me through you see if i would never have a problem i just wouldn't know that you could solve them oh yes i wouldn't even know what faith in the word of god oh yes to trust in jesus [Music] oh [Music] amen thank god for his mercy this morning and i'm so thankful to be in the house of the lord amen and god has certainly made a way for us and we just so appreciate appreciate his mercy and his grace and this hour we're living in and truly the song said through it all i've learned to depend upon his word you know there's many times in our journey sometimes we would love to have a direct word from the lord this is going to happen this will be this will be here this will be there and that that brings faith as well but we also recognize that there are times just like the children of israel where god hasn't spoken directly but you've got a promise and he has already spoken to your heart and you got a promise that you can stand upon [Music] just like they when they walked into the fiery furnace they prayed they did just like the believers would do but they did not have an answer is that right they didn't have they didn't have the promise god never said i tell you what you go ahead and go in the furnace where you're not going to get burnt you're not going to get consumed you're not even going to smell like smoke they didn't have nothing like that but they did have faith in god that he's a deliverer whether god delivers us out of this fiery furnace one way or another we're going to be delivered from the hands of the king amen and truly times in our life it places us in times just like that because faith isn't that we know everything and that we have everything laid out for us so this isn't going to happen or that's not going to happen then it would not be faith the faith is this is what god has said and we rest on that we let god bring the ram into existence we let god move in those times let god do what only he can do and i think that's wonderful don't you amen it's just a work of god we just thank god for his mercy once again as you maybe would turn in your bibles this morning i want to say thankful to the musicians as they hear paul for reading in songs i want to also just say this morning we have a lord willing right after the ministry of the service have a baptism we're here with ryan walker we had spoke back in august and then you know we had issues that had come up with the baptistry the tank or some things the brothers had to work and to redo some things on that and so before he went to college we weren't able to to get that accomplished and you understand with everything that's been going on but at any rate we had spoke on the phone and how the lord had been dealing with his heart and that's exactly what he wanted to give his life to the lord and allowed god just to to take control of his life and he wanted to move forward and in the waters of baptism so we just thank god for that and we just want to continue to pray for him amen that god will just complete the work amen because that's the promise that we have amen the same god that draws us to him he completes his word so as we look here in the word here this morning we want to just uh look here in james chapter two and we'll go ahead and read so you you'll be able to have your seats in james chapter 2 verse 20 but wilt thou know o vain man that faith without works is dead was not abraham our father justified by works when he had offered isaac his son upon the altar see us thou have faith wrought with his works and by works was faith made perfect and the scripture was fulfilled which saith abraham believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of god verse 24 you see then how that by works a man is justified and not by faith only likewise also was not rahab the harlot justified by works when she had received the messengers and had sent them out another way whereas the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also so we want to just looking at how the scripture in james is we've been looking at this and there's just so much that lays here within it but it brings it down to our lives of what god sees what is in the heart god knows what he has placed within the heart of the individual and whatever is in the heart it comes out in the life and so as james was declaring if if there is not a person can say i have faith but if the faith itself is not expressing that itself of what has said has been received then it's vain and so we recognize there's only one faith that's a real living faith and that's the faith of god you and i still have our faith okay but it takes god's faith to come behind our faith our faith alone will not do it but it takes god's faith to come along and it moves our faith because of his faith just like we said moments ago where you stand upon the promises of god and you maybe don't know how this is going to come out or this is but this is going to come out but his faith moving your faith causes you to stand brown said it very simply in the message desperation he says love pushes faith out to the battlegrounds to stand let's just pray anybody have a need you may want to make known before the lord just say god just remember me lord remember the need god bless you heavenly father you're mindful you're merciful you're faithful dear god we just lord want to commit lord this service to remain part of it into your hands lord behind every hand and lord within every heart we have need of you and lord there's there's no way that a man can meet these needs but we ask that you would come that you would take control lord in this service and you would speak to our hearts lord minister to our lives in a very personal way oh god may the spirit of god just come and get into the word and take it out to the hearts of the people lord we just lord just look to you to know and lord with an assurance that god your word it's a factual lord it'll work lord in every heart that it is received we just give ourselves to you lord just ask that we might just be able to yield and step out of the way we thank you father for each and every lord need that you administer to here this morning we ask in the name of jesus christ amen may god bless you as you're being seated and the message works as faith express brother branham would say it like this and giving many different examples with this of faith and works and he says now jesus said only believe for all things are possible to them that believe faith and works are husband and wife they work together the husband works with the wife the wife with the husband they identify one another he said like a man would say he's married and yet he can't produce and show that he has a wife you doubt his claim a man say i'm married you say where's your wife oh i don't know about that be kind of hard for me to believe you i say well where's your wife well i don't know i said i ain't going to believe it so you see if you have what you say you have i have faith how are you going to show me you got faith by your words i'm married how do i know you're married this is my wife there you are i am married this is my husband i'm healed how do you know my works shows my faith what you're speaking of your faith is what god sees in you your works is what the other people see in you remember the lord jesus would express to us that you are a candle a life that has really been lit by god god has come to that life and god has lit that candle that part that god has placed there and now it is a place that it is that which will give light and he said no no candle is hit under a bushel but rather it's put as a city on the hill so something that you can see from great distances it's a light that that you're able to see it's a life as he would go on to say let me let your light soul shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your heavenly father so the light itself that's god that's god's life that's the faith of god our good works is not us trying to be good but those good works are those works that is by him alone who is good and there's no one good but god and so it takes god moving on the inside to bring forth the good works that the scripture says we have been for ordained unto good works so it takes god to bring forth the expression the faith of god moving in to express of of the works of god and this is where as brother graham said your faith is what god sees in you your works is what other people see in you you see this is why very simple a person can say well i'm a christian and brother brown would say just perfect like this if your neighbors don't know you are you're a christian something's wrong people should know you're a christian by the life you live not by something that we have to carry to prove them or to tell them let me just say this everything itself it expresses itself let me this covers a full gamut it covers the life you live the types of things that you feed on the types of posts you make on facebook and everything else there is no such thing as well you know sexual humor is just funny that's nonsense there is no such thing to a believer come on you see you're you're like you can tell brother brandon says you let me go into a man's office and let me see the music he listens to let me see the pinups on his wall and i'll tell you what that man feeds on it don't matter if that man says he's a christian it's what he feeds on it tells what's really there so this is not you see the faith of god is not something that we have to declare oh i have to prove this no it's a complete change of nature on the inside it's not a chicken trying to act like an eagle it's an eagle that is expressing it's an eagle so he says that's that's the difference between james and paul here explaining about abraham they never contradicted one another they was both the same married so is faith that doesn't produce works anyone has a right to doubt your testimony is that right right now do you hear me says before we start the prayer line if your faith doesn't produce works with it you can't make anyone believe that you're healed you say well i don't know well yeah sure i've got all the faith in the world you don't because if you are you got faith then works is married to faith their husband and wife one identifies the other the person says well i got peace it will identify itself but if fear is there it'll identify itself as well you see as as it is expressed that their husband and wife one identifies the other now in hebrews 11 1 because we recognize faith this faith that we're speaking about is god's own faith hebrews 11 1 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen it's a substance it's an evidence in verse 2 for by it the elders obtained a good report when we go on and read the rest of it hebrews 11 which we're not going to but we go through many of the great men and women down through scripture where the bible would say they were subject to life passions such as we are but yet they had a testimony that they were overcomers in their day the hebrew children we spoke of daniel david samson on and on let me tell you why they were overcomers it wasn't because they had good genes it was because they were genes of god and god ignited them and rose up within them his own dna it was gone in them that overcame amen hallelujah and so by it by what by this faith they obtained a good report they fulfilled the word that god had given to them now notice verse three through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which were not seen were not made so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith evil obtained unto be offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts and by it he by it he being dead yet speaketh now notice god revealed to abel what did god reveal it was god's faith that revelation of that of the lamb that it was blood that took him out it would be blood to take him back in it was god's faith that came by the revelation of god that led abel to go forth and he carried out what was revealed to him i think these are things that we need to be very clear on revelation is not knowledge knowledge itself will produce no action that's human faith but the faith of god dropping in it takes god's faith as we've been looking at in the previous services it takes him coming he's the one that comes gets into his word he makes his presence known that he indeed is the high priest not way off in the heavens but he's the high priest right here among us this morning he's veiled in his word speaking and ministering to our hearts he's declaring when he speaks to your heart he answers questions he moves for your needs he's declaring he is the ever-present god he is the i am amen he's letting it be known that this is not just a story that you believe in well yeah god raised from the dead he's declaring i am the risen one i'm the one who raised up from the grave and i'm right here among you i'm right here speaking to your hearts i'm alive as he appeared to john i am he that was dead and i'm alive forevermore no man could ever say that it was always the opposite i'm alive and dead but this one said i am he that was dead and now i'm alive forevermore and i've got the keys hallelujah that vision of the word breaking on john's life it inspired faith in his heart now notice by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation somebody said before he had this testimony that he pleased god the rapture is for those who have a testimony amen now i'm talking about a testament just a testimony of well you know i was sick and i got well or i pray for so-and-so not talking about a life i'm talking about a life that's lived the testimony of jesus christ in you the testimony of jesus christ in us enoch had a life you know what he not means right here in the scripture the word evil means dedicated by faith dedicated to the rapture you see where does the rapture how does it come it comes to dedicated life it's not us trying to dedicate ourselves you see this is the power of divine revelation it brings dedication the faith of god is not something you say oh i got to be more dedicated i got to be more dedicated listen god moves on our hearts and we can see in our lives there is more for us to give but i think you're very you're understanding what i'm saying that when that revelation comes brother it's not you trying to pull yourself or try to do something but it's god on the inside of you it's god moving you it's god directing you it's no longer your efforts it's your yielding and his life but without faith notice verse 6 without faith it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so this faith is a faith that goes beyond the carnal mind the bible says in romans 8 the carnal mind is enmity and strife against god so this faith is that same faith that moves down into the heart as we read in verse 1 faith is the substance it's a deposit that god would make himself into the heart of his children i want you to really lock in here it's a revelation from god as we were looking at that last week it's sovereignly given by his grace amen you can be sitting right here and you've got a need in your life maybe you've got a need for deliverance you've got a need for healing you've got a need for salvation you've got a need for the baptism of the holy ghost god operates sovereignly amen we don't have to work ourselves up into it that is not the purpose of the music then it's not the purpose that when there's no purpose to try to work us up you understand there's things where sometimes where people think pentecostal is where they've got to play the key of g and everybody gets excited no pentecost is where god steps inside of a life where that life has experienced the liberty and the loosening power the cleansing flow of the blood of the lamb pentecost simple is god tabernacling himself in his children that's a real liberty it's that which belonged to you and i pentecos is restoring back to that rightful place that you and i would have in god and we could not get back there on our own but he came he paid the price he sent forth the holy ghost that portion of the promise that belonged to us it comes back and it quickens that seed on the inside it brings us back to the place that we have bypassed so this is a revelation from god sovereignly given by his grace it's broadcast to all yet there's a predestinated ground for it to fall into look at the scripture in verse three we read through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god this word framed it deals with and it describes what is prepared for oneself frame by faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god god by his word remember god spoke his word but he didn't speak it and then have faith in it he already had faith therefore he spoke this is why jesus brings it down it says if there be no doubt in your heart and you say to this mountain be thou removed and capped plucked up and cast in the undersea it shall be even as thou hast said see it's bringing it down into our life we understand that the worlds were framed all was set together even how things were made think about this you or i don't sit around you know there's interesting things we can catch or pick up where you know they'll say you know maybe how this particular animal hibernates or they migrate or whatever and we just we stand in all that many times of how you don't have to go out there and tell the deer hey change your coat hey change your coat you know winter's coming you don't have to go out there and tell the deer hey lose the red coat put on your thick coat there is just it's already built within them you don't have to tell the ducks hey you know water's for you you know you need to go to water you need these what this is for you god allowed that witness left and remained in the earth to show that where the seed of god is when the life of god the water of god the word of god begins to deal with that seed that seed is coming into a place where there's an awakening going on and you're not going to have to tell them go to water you belong in water or you need to change your cup it is there within them within that seed it's responding to the light and the conditions that are taking place to think of it the frame the word of god if praying it prepared for oneself god prepared the world she prepared that even the stars themselves that's where he wrote his first bible to where even the planets and how those things would come into place the celestial bodies that was all framed by the word of god i asked you did it happen overnight no how long did it take don't raise your hand because you don't got an answer well by the same all i know it is but it is because he spoke it he had faith before he said amen he said it and he comes the faith that spoken is there to perform it that's the same way in every age when god sends his word when luther stood there and they were you know saying well this this bread this is the literal body of jesus christ we transform it and all these all that nonsense and luther the inspiration struck him this is not the body of my lord and he threw it down is that right let me tell you what would cause a man to stand like that and raise up against the catholic church what would cause a man to stand that way i tell you human faith alone and do it a man would crumble under human faith even when martin luther when he was there at wittenberg and mind battles were coming the faith of god was greater than any mind battle that he had what was it that caused him to stand that way i'm telling you it was the faith of god that inspired him in the word of god that brought forth the message the just shall live by faith it framed it it brought together many times when a messenger would go forth it is until afterwards that you would see as the word goes forward that afterwards then you see as the crop beginning to come on but with god the god who speaks his word is present to perform it amen amen sometimes we go by our feelings well i didn't feel this service or i didn't feel that had nothing to do with it god's trying to get us away from some of the things of immaturity and get us into a place of maturity to know his word can't fail amen jesus standing before the tomb of lazarus didn't pray because he had to he said i pray because of them standing by there's a lot of things jesus does the love from his heart is for us he comes before our ten door sarah and he'll speak to us he'll deal with our lives and that's the love of god he's not demeaning us but it's god he's through that time he's bringing us to a place to even recognize his word is effectual how many people sitting in meetings brother rem said to white moody he didn't even you know preach that of divine healing but yet he just got to preaching the word and as he was preaching the word there were people being healed in the audience when the word was going forth why faith inspired the message that was being brought he wasn't preaching divine healing but the divine healer was present on the grounds the faith then spare that word and take that word out and the word energized and people could walk away from a service and they didn't even recognize or sit there and say oh i don't have enough faith oh i wish i had more faith and how the prophet of god by the angel of the lord will look down and say you didn't know you had that much faith did you but you were healed just moments ago faith is a subconscious thing it's not something you have to think about it just comes out right amen that's what this faith that's with the faith comes let me not go there let me just stay here prepared if framing is prepared for oneself notice in luke 8 verse 11 the parable now here jesus is giving this parable the seed is the word of god this parable is he gave in each of the gospels and that the parable of the sower the seed is the word of god those by the wayside are they that hear then cometh the devil and take other way the word out of their hearts lest they should believe and be saved they on the rock are they which when they hear receive the word with joy and these have no root for which for a while believe and in the time of temptation fall away and they which fell among thorns are they which when they have heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of life and bring no fruit to perfection but that on the good ground that's what i believe i'm speaking to but that on the good ground are they notice the ground is talking about persons this ground is talking about persons but that on the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience now brother brown would say here's the predestinated plan in plain view and just as the other seed the word of god is a seed and must have the ground prepared beforehand if you sowed seed just throw it out there on the ground it would do no good the birds would pick it up you would throw it among thorns and thistles it'll choke it out pretty soon jesus parable said so so the ground has to be made ready first so god in sovereign grace prepares the heart [Music] first he prepared you before the foundation of the world to receive him in this age there's a part of you that has been prepared to receive him a part of him that is already prepared to receive him when he makes himself known to you in the hour in the season of the world and notice as he has prepared you and made ready that you could receive him remember he has to come and deal with the heart because he just doesn't override repentance this is god making the heart ready is repentance because of what is laying there already on the inside that's what he's coming that's the betting ground but there's got to be a repentance first are you with me so here let me read that again so god in sovereign grace prepares the heart first that's the work that god does through the preaching of the gospel now and now comes clear back before the foundation of the world he prepared you before the foundation of the world to receive him in this age you are represented in him before the foundational world as a matter of fact you were there when the morning stars shouted for joy are you with me you were also part of those stars that in isaiah 14 that lucifer said i will exalt my throat i will sin above the stars of god the stars of god means the messiah's brothers i will exalt myself above them but the word goes out god that exalted thyself thou shalt be brought down hallelujah glory be to god in the highest god prepared you before the foundation of the world to receive him in this age he foreknew you by his foreknowledge and ordained you to eternal life he knew you therefore he prepared you that's the reason you staggered out of these things and staggered into what you have now you didn't know what was taking place you're staggering all right percent what's going on but look at you look now look what god does when it finally god brings you into the place that is prepared for you listen friends i'm not just talking about this church it's got to go deeper than that it's talking about in christ in your inheritance in your enlightened portion it's when you come into that place you're no longer staggering around and bumping around but now you have been positioned in christ what is it it's a faith that expresses itself as a position mature adopted son and daughter of god is that right it removes the staggering you know what staggering is you don't know what's going on look how god's leading you here but i'm saying things that ought to be you came to the altar that night in a little mission you didn't know what was taking place you all you knew is god dealt with your heart you gave your heart to god maybe it was in your home you had no idea you know it's not even anything you're thinking about but all of a sudden your heart starts to turn what's happening you're staggering out of and staggering into even the staggering it's not you leading yourself it's god leading you you don't even know what's taking place and the truth be known is becoming more real to you and i even as we journey on it was god leading you to the place where he had ordained for you to be if this ground isn't prepared beforehand it can't grow that's the reason the seed of faith when you're preaching faith the discernments of the lord and see what takes place and gifts of the bible working people will work themselves up oh hallelujah i believe it and they come up and they find themselves disappointed the ground has to be foreign and you know it when it strikes him now in the scripture here the bible if i can just refer to a few places without having to really maybe to read them but if you didn't take if you notice that the earth itself as it is spoken of it is the only planet only only one mentioned in the scripture that is inhabited if nasa and the rest of them would only read the bible and believe it right amen they'd stop all the crazy spending are you with me i mean just five million dollars do rats have tails i mean you think of people have they gone nuts yes they have i mean i know they got tails so what but notice this the earth itself notice in the scripture genesis 2 it says the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden this word garden in the hebrew means bride god planted a garden it was a special place that he had prepared in the earth the bible goes on to say out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the site good for food the tree of life is also in the midst of the garden in genesis 4 when it speaks after cain has rose up against abel there remember the bible says thou art cursed from the earth which hath opened her mouth so it refers to the earth she is a womb it's ground it's a place that seed is to be received it opens her mouth thou telleth the ground it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength in leviticus 26 4 god's promise i will give you rain in new season and the land shall yield her increase now look how god would place this after the fall here we recognize as god here working and after the fall had taken place and god makes this declaration there to this first couple in the garden i will put enmity between thee and the woman between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel brother brown would say it just like this god he said had to reveal himself in his attributes in this person called christ in order to take death upon himself as jehovah he could not die so he had to create himself a body and no woman could produce that body you see he says when i think of it it's his character projected the lovely person of jesus christ so god's character projected the person of jesus christ no woman could bring it moses mother joshua had she was a great woman so was rebecca and many other women but none of them could produce this type of character because it was come through sex by a fallen people but god projected his own body his own dwelling place that's the reason he was the son of god because nothing else could project it but his own divine character projected this tabernacle to express himself in woman could not produce it the bible says man is born of a woman is a few days old and full of trouble is that right but by the woman tree we die right but by the man tree we live is that right here's the tree of life now notice he would give her a seed this is the promise he would give her a seed and when he gave her a seed this would be her seat the woman herself she has no seats she's a betting ground right is that right a woman can't have a child on her own a man himself just can't go and have a child on his own see that's why the perversions between men and women men and men as homosexuals and and these women and women and women that can produce no life what is it death it's perversion is that right but you see the hour that we're in that's where it's at among churches the man is not there right amen the one that cannot give you life it takes the mantra to bring you in it takes god he said i am the way the truth and the life it takes him coming ruth could not bring herself in boaz had to bring her in rehab could not bring herself in salmon had to bring her in when the daughters of salafia had no way to get to their inheritance but yet one who was a king out their father's tribe they married him and then they enter into their inheritance it takes the man to bring you in amen is that right so we see this yet god by his spirit listen to me now he would transmit into her into mary that seed both the bedding ground and life he borrowed the wound but he did not take the oven or the egg of mary amen that would have been another sinful mankind you see what god was saying god was letting us know i do not need your help [Music] this is why when it came to mary and let it be known what's going to take place mary first of all look reasoning said how can this be but the betting ground was there already prepared when the word came and said the holy ghost shall overshadow thee what did that do when that word came in that hour that was spoken by the prophet isaiah and god was there declaring it it was awakening the betting ground that was in mary that the word was for and she said be it unto me according to thy word she did not know how it was going to happen she did not know how it was going to take place all she now faith the faith of god that energized the promise to be spoken had energized her heart toward her faith now was declaring that be it unto me according to thy word amen how's it going to happen that's not faith that faith you have you've got faith because you figure everything out then you don't have faith right amen right oh glory be to god hallelujah so notice god god brings forth the betting ground and the life because no part of it was mary it was god preparing himself a body to come and live in and redeem us through remember what took place at the river jordan remember he was being baptized and here came the holy ghost descending down from heaven and out of lack and unto a dove god is coming into humanity and out from the dove remember from above he was spoke out this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased to dwell what was he doing the spirit of god the heavenly father was claiming this is my word has produced this and now i'm coming to proclaim what my word has produced what does the coming of the holy ghost say in your life it's coming to claim what god has already sown in your life he's coming to say that's prepared ground that belongs to me oh don't worry on that prepared ground on the other part on the other ground that was here oh there was all sorts of things that was done on that ground but this ground satan has never put his dirty feet on the prepared ground of god right let's say brother sam you have no idea of my past but there's a past that's greater than your past that ties you into your future because you see a seed itself was not alive but yet there's only one that could raise it up and that's god it was a batting ground that seed that the devil has never put his dirty feet on but god comes by his quickening power after he does away with your first husband and raises it up now look at this here i just i just want to read these things are inspired in my heart he is the first of this new race this is why the bible calls it we are a new creation in christ jesus he's the first of this new race it's not our life or our soul per se that we lend to god but rather by foreknowledge and predestination he placed a seed within us which is the attribute thought of the word himself one of his genes when you hear this genes word thought attribute it's speaking of the betting ground for the word that lay within your life the whole time dormant dormant only he could raise it up only he can raise it up what does he do before he raise it up he prepares the heart first he's got to start dealing with the heart and as he's dealing with the heart you see the staggering you see the staggering around but it's god dealing with the heart amen god dealing with the heart what's he doing he's preparing the heart first he's got to get everything lined up in agreeance are you with me notice he placed that seed we are one of the genes the heirs from the loins of his mind when we dropped from our mother's womb this seed of god that i'm talking about that was in god when you and i dropped from our mother's womb even god knowing the hair color the eye color and everything about you and i psalms 139 thou knewest me when my members yet not written in thy book yet altogether perfect is that right god knew you god even knew all of those details about you but it is something much deeper than these characteristics here it's that seed that was on the inside that seed that come forth from the loins this this right here on the outside it bears the image and reflection of brown and browning and all of those mixtures down through down through the town same way with you but there is a part a deposit on the inside that browning nor brown nor anybody else can actually bring that forth mom and dad help me raise me tell me what's right point me in the right way but it takes god himself to come by his own life and raise up that life on the inside and bring forth a real son of god in god god gives birth to sons and daughters of god a church does not give birth to sons and daughters of god but it takes god in the church to give birth to sons and daughters of god amen is that right right so the real you and me as soon as we took that that breath of life brother ram tells us in god rich in mercy that seed of god was placed within us then genesis 2 21 and the lord god calls the deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the ground which the lord god had taken the rib which the lord had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and adam said this is now bone of my bones flesh in my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man woman is womb of man womb of man she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh so man what did adam unite with adam united with what came from within him he united with that which god brought from within him woman womb of man notice this womb you see this this brings the election of god to light in our life it's that elected seed on the inside that comes predestinated from god not the person the seed on the inside god knew all those other parts as we said about you but remember it's that seed on the inside that seed that being part of him that being of his word that being from within him that is the womb the betting ground that he comes to plant his quickening power in now think of this that seed itself this is why brother brown would say that soul is that real gift from god that soul is the real gift from god amen remember your soul is the nature of the spirit is that right and god god don't want that first one are you with me god ain't trying to you know clean him up and man we're going to make him a good bedding ground i'll tell you there's been an awful lot of junk planning in this batting ground but this is my bedding ground nope god said i'm that's not my bedding ground that's the betting ground of your first husband your first nature right now is that right that's why the new birth ain't trying to clean up the ground and make it look pretty amen being born again means a complete transformation it's to raise up that seed that is that of a virgin life because jesus christ is the high priest and he can't marry somebody who's already married is that right he can only marry a virgin is that right so he takes him to raise that up after he deals with the first one this is god preparing the heart first notice brother em said the first son adam was the spoken seed word of god he was given a bride to reproduce himself himself so what would she be called adam the bible says when he called their name adam amen but after the fall she received other seed is where she got her own name eve mother of all living but you never find god saying adam is the father of all living because adam was not the father of all living right cain was of that wicked one all right is that right but abel and seth those are sons of god he was given a bride to reproduce himself now the bride could not reproduce him on her own she is the womb that which comes from him that is why the bride was given to him to reproduce himself to produce another son of god now notice how paul will pick this up in first corinthians 11. you notice how paul would write about this union he'll write about it in ephesians 5 he'll write about it here in the book of corinthians paul will write of it and depict to you and i that of the spiritual bringing it down to the natural and then right back into the spiritual watch how paul would place this here in first corinthians 11 7 for a man indeed ought not to cover his head for as much as he is the image and glory of god but the woman is the glory of the man so the woman is to be what the reflection of the man remember whatever a man chooses for a wife shows what's in his heart that's right if he chooses some woman that runs around doesn't care and this and that it shows what's in his heart because he's making a choice it is a reflection of his heart so then to see this of how that the woman just like the moon the moon has no light of her own but the moon is to do what give forth the light of the sun in its absence so the moon is that of the wife to that of the son the husband so the woman is the glory of the man for the man notice how paul bringing this in the spirit you're going clear back there into genesis for the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man neither was the man created for the woman but the woman for the man for this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels what a fitting thing that paul would place in here paul would deal with the part in the spiritual aspect it is not that god has come from us we've come from god is that right it is not that oh that god's been created for us no we were made we were made we were created for him that we would yield forth lives that are surrendered in worship and adoration it was not about notice the principle here our lives a real true christian's life it's not about their own will or serving their own purpose but it's coming back in to the submissiveness the subjection to the real reality that i'm not here on this earth to do my own will i'm here to do the will of almighty god in other words you recognize you're a pilgrim and a stranger you deny yourself you take up your cross and you follow him you realize this life that god has given me is a life to live for his glory amen this is real christianity not serving god for what while he can better your life that's that's not christianity amen truly serving the lord truly walking even in the light of the word even by that of a human faith can it benefit a lot sure it can keep a life out of a lot of trouble but you know god's desire is that they would get clear down here on the inside where it's not just up here in your mind oh i shouldn't do this and yeah i better not be i can't do that yet this is not a i can't do that it's not according to the word i can't do no but god wants to bring it so it's so much deeper from that of a mind of sanctification to where it moves to the inside it's no longer i can't it's the thing of i can't but i don't want to i don't want to do that i want to do only those things which please him amen for this cause notice i would bring this down for this calls out the woman to have power on her head because of the angels notice this word power is excusia it's a sign of authority a sign of authority which is position it's position what puts our position into a reality the dunamis the quickening power of god because see as we minister we minister the exclusion you're sons and daughters of god ministering that by the dunamis of god are you with me it's calling you behold behold beloved what manner it is what manner of love that god bestowed upon us what's god doing he's calling to sons and daughters of god now you couldn't sit here in your life and you know drinking smoking and all kinds of habits in your life and doing this and that and saying well praise god he said i'm a son of god that's right he's telling you you've got rights and stop living beneath your privilege you've got a position that you're called to then what do i do say god let the dunamis the holy ghost come down lord and bring me into the exclusion the authority of the son and daughter of god that i belong in that's right amen somebody's going to let you know who you are is that right then you can know your privileges your rights are ministered to you then you can ask for him who ministers to rights take me in lord amen you see this is why when you look at it power on her head why would paul deal with hair why would paul deal with hair here and paul would deal with it here in the scripture and say if it's cut you'd be better enough to have it shorn why would paul deal look what he says here for this calls out the woman to have power on her head because of the angels think of how god would allow these things intact now in type how that here we recognize the veil itself that even a woman would put on in the old testament when a woman would wear a veil it showed she was under authority when rebecca came to isaac she veiled herself showing she was under authority of the word of the promise to meet isaac that came by eliezer so when she came and she asked eliezer who is this man he says this is my master i said she veiled herself and she leaped off of the camel now paul paul brings this veil and ties the veil in that it is that of long hair what's long hair uncut hair now how would this be notice for the sisters themselves notice how this is it's a reflection of the sisters yet this speaks beyond just sisters it speaks to both male and female in the spiritual because the woman is to have power on her head because of what the angels not capital a lowercase a angels the messengers messengers are who messengers of god the messengers of god that would carry the message what message are they carrying the message the testimony of jesus christ that of god's own life whoever they're carrying it it's being broadcast to all but there is an ordained betting ground that when that life would come into that bedding ground think of it though our sisters would have long hair but think of it for every brethren's brother and sister every male and female every one of us must be born of the holy ghost we must all be adorned with the headship of jesus christ the word it's not just that which is shown an outward sign there upon our sisters but it ought to be an adornment about our life there is authority power on our head we are under the authority of the gospel of jesus christ is that right so it's not the identity of our first birth any longer it's the identity of the new birth this is why paul would go on and write in verse 11 nevertheless neither is the man without the woman neither the woman without the man and the lord for as the woman is of the man even so is the man also by the woman but all things of god notice how paul brought that all down then after the fall here we come man of woman and woman woman there of man we must all as he goes on and say in galatians 3 28 there is neither jew nor greek there is neither bond or free there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in christ jesus is that right and yet being all to all one in christ jesus god himself has said that the woman is not to handle the word i suffer not for a woman to teach or assert authority over a man why he comes clear back from there from eden but it is also an expression now listen to me now brothers if the woman is to be the real daughter of god is to be an expression a type there of the bride of jesus christ what does that call for you and i to be hello husbands love your wives even as christ so loved the church glory be to god you say lord jesus those are big shoes to fill but there's a great big god that can help you amen notice bill graham says your heart is a wound i love this quote your heart is a wound he said you know what i'm speaking of men and women your heart is the wound and the womb holds the seed the seed is the gospel now the seed alone in its heart no matter how many gamilias you set under no matter how great your pastor is how much you've read the bible it'll never take life until the germ of life has come to it look how he says this a woman's seed is a wonderful thing it's the building of the body but it has no life it can't it's impossible it has it has no life to begin with so no matter how much you know the bible how well it is in your heart you're still a sinner a woman's seed is a wonderful thing notice what happened the heart is the womb and faith cometh by an open ear that's not been sealed by theology faith coming by hearing to hear the word comes into the mind you make up your mind about it look how this is look how simple is that right could that be right well the bible said so i believe it down in the heart it goes then it's a wound we are the bride the woman the seed goes into the church what does the seed go the seed goes into the woman's seed he gave you a seed it's that seed of god that lay within you it's a building of a body but it has no life in it of its own it only has potential is that right but when that life comes into it the betting ground it raises that up and that betting ground becomes a temple a habitation that god can make himself known through amen it becomes a word that's being expressed for your life it becomes the faith of god that begins to be expressed through your life that anybody ever when you plant something how many of you are planted something in your life planted something okay i know you did really you're telling me them tomatoes this year when you go to plant them you know the tomatoes do you have to go out there over top the tomatoes when you planted them and and i don't know what kind you planted but let's just say you planted burpee big boys and you planted them and said now listen now you are not romans i want you to understand how you're to grow you're not to have these little teensy little teensy limbs growing out this is how you're supposed to grow you're supposed to do this and you're supposed to do that i can still see your eyes i mean i'll be able to see your mouth but i can see your eyes you probably look at me and thinking you go do that you're crazy you don't go out there and talk to plants furthermore you don't have to tell the big boy tomatoes how to produce big boy tomatoes you don't have to tell them how to grow are you with me you don't have to tell the aroma to tomato plants or the cherry tomato plants now you're only supposed to grow like big boys you're supposed to scream hey romans you're supposed to you don't have to do that where is that authority at it's in the sea all it needs is the quickening power to release what's already there and good works come out here comes a vine growing there here comes a vine growing here it shoots out there but blossom here you don't have to go and tell it what to do and grow only this much and how you should be growing this much you don't have to do that the only thing you've got to do is make sure it's positioned in light and you water it the leaves the vines the tomatoes are already in it just give it time in its position amen he shall perfect that which concerns me [Music] he will bring it forth this is the rest of god brother brian this is the rest oh my god i got a big boy tomato oh oh that's trying to work yourself up right so you can't produce faith what do i do drink drink push out drink drink push out oh mama notice he says then that male set which is the blood cell the blood of christ is applied and in the blood comes the germ of life that goes into the seed and brings forth a newborn baby crying abba father have a father my god my god why did i ever do those things my god my god there you are that little womb in your heart with the seed this morning falling into it the breath so won't you open your eyes won't you let it fall not from your mind but down into the womb of your heart men and women alike notice men and women alike there is neither male or female in this kind both of you has got a heart let it fall down there and say well sure that's the truth you know in the preaching of the gospel remember the sower went forth to sow seed some fell on among thorns and thistles some you know i'm on stony ground some of it you know all the different the the four different types of ground and then brother brown would say it like this he would quote those scriptures i read last week out of john 6 44. then he said all that the father has given me will come to me brother said i'm so glad that i don't know who it is and who it isn't all that i'm responsible for is spreading it it's sowing it it's preaching the word there's good ground that it's prepared for let me just say it to you right now there's good ground that it's prepared for even when god would come around and god might take a message like this or it might be another knee that you've got in your life that you need lord i need direction right now in this situation already you've got the faith of god moving in your life you pass from death unto life but you've got a need maybe it's a need for healing in your body maybe it's a need lord i need to know what direction do i take maybe you're between two or three jobs lord what direction do i take lord i need direction i need guidance on this and you know what god is mindful and present to drop into the betting ground what you have needed now he may not tell you take job a he can if he wants to he may not tell you take job b he may not tell you oh those test results they'll all turn out negative he may not tell you that but what he might drop down is say i'm the lord that healeth thee now you might look at it or me would say praise god no suffering and yet god didn't mean that maybe it meant 12 months from now 15 months from now brother brown tells us there's a sister standing there in the congregation i think it's 1964 just once more lord when you study many many of the months i just studying on healing and healing and just kept studying some of things we were bringing in the finally we broke into the first part of the year and you find how at times that here was a woman the spirit of god would speak out she was dealing with nervousness dealing with all kinds of conditions in her life and the spirit of god spoke out and said sister that nervousness god has healed you from that nervousness he says go god will bring it to pass 18 months later she stands up and testifies brother branham what god spoke to you that day god has brought it to pass in my life you think there wasn't days that she didn't get down sure there were days that she got down and discouraged you think there weren't days that there weren't thoughts that didn't come our way but what was it that motivated her what was it that gave her strength it was the faith of god regarding the promise i'm the lord that healeth thee what was god doing throughout all that listen fred so many times we miss what god is showing us by just looking at the outcome and we act as though lord where you at where you're at in the midst of it god was right there with her he said i'll never leave you nor forsake you when you're going through a trial he don't leave you at the door and walk around to this door he walks right there with you he went through the fire with the hebrew children he meant what he said he's there with you but this is where times come faith is trust trust doesn't need to know god you promised me i ain't never gonna get sick god you promised me this let me then they trust trust is lord this is what you said in your word and faith listen isn't you and i making ourselves it isn't that it's where that drops in our heart anybody know what i'm talking about i mean when things drop in your heart it's just it's peace right it's peace even in the midst of the storm even in the midst of what one with the things that we're dealing with but i'm saying you've got peace yes let's say do you have a promise that you won't get sick i don't have that promise i'm not standing here because i've got that promise right are you with me or you must stay in your house and i don't stay in the house i don't have a promise when i get in my vehicle that i won't get in an accident by the way there's a high more highly likely likelihood i die from an accident are you with me i don't listen to me faith is not we're going to say you're a young man you're 45 years old you don't have to worry about this that is not faith i said that's not faith that's not trust trust is i belong to him and the peace that he gives i don't have to have that promise me this god if you promise me this god i'll do this if you promise me this god i'll do this that's not faith but it's trust that's what god asked us to do trust him amen how can you can't give that to yourself i can't give it to myself it has to come from him does it make us bigger than anybody else not a bit it makes you thankful it makes you thankful lord thank you lord for your peace thank you lord for your peace let me try to bring this down it's good ground that god is looking for that that word notice in acts chapter 13 verse 48 when the gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed amen and the word of the lord was published throughout all the region notice those who were ordained to eternal life believed first thessalonians 2 13 for this cause also think we god without ceasing because when ye received the word of god which he heard of us ye received it not as the word of men but as it is in truth the word of god which effectually worketh also in you that belief the word finding a betting ground in a heart and it goes to work what does it do it produces just what he said in that word amen it goes to work it shows itself operative first peter 1 22 seeing you have purified look at this seeing ye hath purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever the seed of god god's own life coming into that betting ground notice what peter would write seeing you have purified your souls staggering god dealing with your life it's time and the word is being sounded here you are being drawn i don't mean you're in a church brother man tells us that voice that spoke to you when you're on the bar store and said what are you doing here that same voice that spoke there hey listen you sound a bar stool that same voice spoke to our prophet when he was carrying water for the moonshine steel right right glory be to god it spoke to your heart it begins to call you it begins to draw it isn't necessarily like my voice it could sound it could be an audible voice like this or something that maybe even would speak in your heart but then again it might just be the sounding of his voice that things start to turn and you look in and say what am i doing here there's something more than this something what's happening it's god calling you it's god dealing trying to get bring you into place where you need to be and so god is working and here you begin to notice purify your soul purify my soul you mean my soul is what i'm going to offer up to god no god wants it to come completely in line and then god kills it and then god raises up that seed on the inside are you with me god brings it completely in line with his word but you purifying your soul unto what obeying the truth you see friends it goes to everybody whether you're on the internet or wherever the holy ghost the bible says god giveth his spirit to them who obey his word if you don't obey then the spirit won't come but an obedient heart now notice that doesn't mean that oh i've got this t cross this t cross and this t cross you can sit right here this morning right here this morning and right there it moved within your heart into a place of full obedience and the spirit of god the token will come right down and ignite that there might be things that you've got to kick out and throw away when you get home or other things that you put but you see what's happened it's already been put out of here this has been lined up and then god comes down amen oh my anything precious how could we you and i could not bring ourselves into this place this is where brethren talks about the heart being prepared first throwing out that of jealousy throwing out that of bitterness throwing out different things malice and so forth within our life it's god moving god working in our life amen once you think of this as we close this bedding ground god has a way in his choosing the better ground of god's choice it has nothing to do with your flesh but is it my flesh the temple that he wants remember there are three chambers in a temple from the tabernacle in the wilderness to solomon's temple there's three the glory of god did not come down in the outer court the glory of god did not come in and down into that inner court or that holy place but the glory of god came down into the holiest of holies when it came down there on the mercy seat it would come in there when everything was right in its position it would come down and remember the coming down of his presence was the signifying it's finished this is a finished work it's the same thing within our life it's not the flesh god doesn't choose based on our flesh this is why paul would write he said you see that there's not many mighty many noble many rich but quite the contrary god would choose base things of the world things of the world that people would say write them off people that in the scripture could not come to the well but a certain time of the day but you see god chooses because out here people could look and say oh my no this person will never never never but what they underestimate is and don't know is there's a betting ground on the inside and that bedding ground when god can get everything else lined up and bring it in line in agreeance with him then god kills that and he moves right into the inside what is that seed that's the womb that's the seed that which came from god and god steps down and he veils himself in that life this is why when god has veiled in your life in that bedding ground this is why the spirit of god would say mortify the members of your body this is why him reigning on the inside would tell us you can't keep evil thoughts from coming but you can keep him from building nests is that right this reigning and dwelling on the inside is where you say you know what the same god that's dwelling in the habitation his habitation a body he prepared for himself a body he prepared for himself a womb a seed and his life emanating from that life the shekinah glory what does it do when that moving the love of god moving in our heart this is why this is why we do the things that we do we don't do it because we have to we do it because of his
