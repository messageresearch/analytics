[38:04] that he comes amen we just are so
[38:07] thankful for that we just want to just
[38:09] take our
[38:10] Quest well you've taken a prayer request
[38:13] before the Lord we just want to continue
[38:15] to offer
[38:18] and every request and to the Lord I know
[38:20] I've brought this to you before but with
[38:22] brother Donny's daughter sister Erica
[38:25] it's always just continue to keep that
[38:27] in mind in prayer and I know that the
[38:30] Lord has just been moving there for her
[38:32] and sometimes it's been little by little
[38:35] just by Littles to be able to do little
[38:38] things
[38:39] even around the house and then to be in
[38:41] the end to be in the house of God but
[38:44] you know we'll we'll take every little
[38:45] step
[38:47] and uh you know last weekend
[38:50] we had an opportunity we were there in
[38:53] the meetings and you some of you no
[38:55] doubt you maybe got a chance to watch it
[38:57] or to see it
[38:59] here you have brother Ron Spencer
[39:01] standing there
[39:02] on Friday night
[39:04] stage four cancer
[39:06] but it's preaching
[39:08] like a real champion
[39:11] I don't mean that that's not to uplift
[39:13] brother Ron to me that's that's a
[39:15] product of what this message does in our
[39:19] lives
[39:20] it's what God does in our lives to be
[39:23] able to stand there in the face
[39:25] to realize because the cancer that
[39:27] brother Ron has he was only given four
[39:30] months to live
[39:31] melanoma once it gets inside you it's
[39:33] four months
[39:35] and that was for months back in December
[39:39] of 2019.
[39:41] and in that particular moment I don't
[39:44] know if you're aware of this but when he
[39:46] got the news
[39:48] that he had that cancer in four months
[39:50] to live
[39:51] he was preaching at brother biscals
[39:54] he walked out and he preached the
[39:55] message called courage
[39:58] after getting that news
[40:00] if you haven't heard it and you know
[40:02] it's online it's a powerful service
[40:05] and I I just say it in this way that you
[40:08] know we want to continue to hold them up
[40:10] in prayer
[40:11] through it all
[40:13] God is receiving a testimony
[40:17] I'll tell you I witnessed there like I
[40:19] said on Friday night God took a God took
[40:21] a man about this about this tall right
[40:25] here
[40:27] and using
[40:28] for the glory of God
[40:31] and I just to me I just think glory be
[40:34] to God it's all you can do to contain
[40:35] yourself because you see God working but
[40:37] you know what the same God that works
[40:40] and Ron Spencer is the same God that
[40:42] works in you and me
[40:44] the same God
[40:45] no matter what our tests or our trials
[40:47] is I say Lord
[40:49] what resiliency you bring there you also
[40:52] bring in our hearts and our lives
[40:55] I believe that he's the same God he
[40:57] brother Braham says it like this
[41:00] I know this quote
[41:01] very well brother Brown says that God
[41:04] gives ice cream to one of his children
[41:06] he's got to give it to all
[41:09] so God doesn't God's not a god of
[41:13] favoritism what he does for one he'll do
[41:16] for all
[41:17] amen so I've Got Confidence in that and
[41:21] so we just want to continue as I was
[41:23] just trying to bring some to you
[41:24] remember to continue to prayers pray for
[41:26] sister Erica Parker brother Ron Spencer

[45:30] want to share with you brother Nathanael
[45:32] science just text me here today and
[45:35] they're having special meetings this
[45:37] weekend with brother Daniel Andy's
[45:39] Saturday with a he stated with the
[45:42] barbecue lunch between services and all
[45:45] of the Saints are welcome it's Saturday
[45:47] it's 10 a.m as the service and then they
[45:51] have lunch and then it'll be a 4 P.M
[45:53] service so if you're able to go and and
[45:56] to be a part of that I think it would be
[45:57] a great blessing and Saturday at 10 A.M
[46:00] and then at 4 P.M and there's a lunch in
[46:03] between and they've been so so gracious
[46:07] and so good they've we I thank God for
[46:09] the relationship and for the working
[46:11] amen that God has brought together and
[46:13] with the sister churches and just to be
[46:16] able to work together and they have
[46:19] certainly been very supportive of the
[46:22] meetings and services here and so we you
[46:25] know if you can find it in your schedule
[46:27] to go
[46:28] maybe just even one of the services I
[46:30] know would be a great blessing and
[46:32] encouragement as well
[46:34] and um
[46:36] let's look here in job 23 and verse 8.
[46:40] and I I want to
[46:44] just continue to read and I know we've
[46:46] been reading this for for a few few
[46:48] weeks or a few Services now but we want
[46:51] to continue to draw the context from
[46:53] this here
[46:54] behold I go forward but he is not there
[46:58] and backward but I cannot perceive him
[47:02] and on the left hand where he does work
[47:04] but I cannot Behold Him
[47:07] he hideth himself on the right hand that
[47:10] I cannot see him
[47:12] but he knoweth the way that I take and
[47:15] when he hath tried me
[47:17] I shall come forth as gold what a
[47:20] confession
[47:22] my foot hath held his steps
[47:26] his way have I kept and not declined
[47:31] neither have I gone back from the
[47:34] Commandment of his lips and I have
[47:37] esteemed the words of his mouth more
[47:40] than my necessary food
[47:43] I'd like to continue tonight to speak on
[47:45] that thought of faithful may God bless
[47:47] you bless the reading of the word as
[47:48] you're being seated
[47:51] I
[47:55] I come back and I was looking over one
[47:57] of the points and I don't have this
[47:59] quote up there with me but
[48:01] just very inspired to me even today as I
[48:05] was just looking over this and coming
[48:07] back to me but
[48:09] brother Branham takes us into that three
[48:11] kinds of Believers and he speaks of how
[48:13] that when job
[48:15] all of the friends had come around and
[48:19] they were pointing out clearly something
[48:21] is wrong with your walk with God
[48:24] because none of this would be happening
[48:27] if everything was okay between you and
[48:30] God
[48:31] and brother Branham in the midst of one
[48:33] of one quote
[48:35] and you know how it's things you just
[48:36] look at for some time and brother
[48:38] Brandon makes a statement within there
[48:40] he says but job was able they could not
[48:45] move him from his sacrifice
[48:49] and he said he knew it was the devil and
[48:52] it was no use of tempting him
[48:55] now see job was able to discern that
[48:58] clearly that what they were trying to do
[49:01] and it wasn't them
[49:03] that's all they understood but it was
[49:05] the enemy trying to work through them to
[49:08] get job to denounce his message
[49:12] it was to try to get him to turn from
[49:15] his message to deny it but see there was
[49:19] something that job didn't give himself
[49:23] job didn't learn this on his own it was
[49:27] divine revelation
[49:29] and that's why brother Brandon would
[49:31] tell us and I have heard but now I see
[49:32] and he would say it throughout the
[49:34] message Revelation is more important
[49:37] than what you realize
[49:39] because there's many times
[49:42] you know I've sat and I've talked with
[49:44] individuals went through scriptures and
[49:47] they can see certain things that is
[49:49] undeniable of what you're showing them
[49:51] in the scripture and then yet to turn
[49:53] and see them walk whiter right away from
[49:56] the truth and walk right back into
[50:00] accepting things that they set and when
[50:04] we went through in a Bible study they
[50:06] knew this was right
[50:09] and when you look at that you realize
[50:11] one thing was for sure it never was a
[50:15] revelation
[50:16] because what's more important than
[50:20] knowing the written word is to have the
[50:23] Revelation which is God's thought that
[50:27] what God thought when he inspired the
[50:30] writers to write that is the spirit of
[50:34] Truth revealing himself
[50:37] and that's why that's what God's
[50:39] original program and it's always been
[50:41] God's program God's program has never
[50:44] been man teaching man it's God himself
[50:48] unfolding himself to his people so even
[50:53] as God has teachers but it's not the
[50:55] teacher doing the teaching it's the
[50:58] spirit of God who's doing the teaching
[51:00] because he promised when he has come
[51:03] after the sacrifice is offered when he
[51:06] has come he will lead and guide you into
[51:08] all things he will teach you he will
[51:12] show you things to come that's the work
[51:15] and the office of the holy spirit so job
[51:19] is standing on the ground that God has
[51:23] revealed to him and he's and showing
[51:25] that in this scriptures that we read
[51:27] that job has not only heard his voice
[51:30] the Commandment of his lips but job has
[51:34] caught a sight of his character of his
[51:38] nature he knows him not just by a letter
[51:41] but I know his ways I know his steps
[51:45] remember the promise of John 5 19 which
[51:48] is reflected in the True Believer the
[51:51] son can do nothing in himself but what
[51:54] he seeth the father doing that doeth the
[51:58] son likewise it was showing that there
[52:00] was now an opening back fully into the
[52:04] channel to see the Living God and a
[52:07] direct communication that's coming back
[52:09] not just something that would come and
[52:12] go but a direct communication between
[52:15] God and his people and God's the one who
[52:19] has restored that through him by Calvary
[52:21] and then the outpouring of the Holy
[52:23] Ghost God has restored that relationship
[52:26] or that true Oneness that God has
[52:30] desired and then when we look upon this
[52:34] to see this within job's life I've been
[52:36] referring us back into a quote here out
[52:39] of the same message three kinds of
[52:40] Believers your brother Branham says
[52:42] Believers are put to the test and not
[52:45] sometimes but every time for every son
[52:49] that cometh to God must be chastened
[52:52] tried and child trained and remember the
[52:56] trials the dusty roads the hot son of
[52:59] persecution but the Loyalty of your
[53:02] heart beats that material till she is
[53:06] ready to go into the mold
[53:09] now you know our feelings can tell us a
[53:12] lot of things many times
[53:15] but I want to say to you your feelings
[53:17] anytime our feelings go against the word
[53:20] of God they're lying
[53:23] anytime reasoning goes against the word
[53:25] of God it's lying
[53:28] so it's not the loyalty to our feelings
[53:31] many times uh uh you know in humanity we
[53:35] can be loyal to our feelings loyal to a
[53:37] lot of things but remember loyalty
[53:40] itself is only recognized by God when
[53:44] it's a loyalty to his word
[53:47] that's what God recognizes God
[53:50] appreciates listen God the loyalty to
[53:53] the word of God by the spirit of God
[53:54] will bring loyalty in marriage it'll
[53:58] bring loyalty and home it'll produce
[54:01] loyalty in the lives of his people but
[54:04] first get that loyalty of Christ in you
[54:08] the hope of glory and then all these
[54:11] other things will be added unto you
[54:14] right because we come into such uh
[54:17] moments even of responsibility so there
[54:20] are the Loyalty of our heart is what
[54:22] beats that material till she's ready to
[54:24] go into the mold so in the midst of the
[54:27] test and of the trial standing faithful
[54:30] and looking to God when we do not know
[54:33] what the outcome is or what the next
[54:36] step is but in that moment dying to our
[54:40] feelings let me just say this brother Bo
[54:42] has preached a phenomenal message on
[54:44] Sunday I went back and I just combed
[54:47] through that message and I told him the
[54:48] other uh the texting the other day to me
[54:51] it was profound how that he went through
[54:53] that with the Temptations of Christ and
[54:55] broke into those things on Hunger
[54:57] feelings worship submission and then
[55:00] dealing with Satan's objective to bring
[55:02] confusion to get people off the word and
[55:05] to me I I just I was blessed as I was
[55:08] sitting and just listening and going
[55:10] through that because when you we see
[55:12] this that this is Satan's objective is
[55:16] always to come and test us on our
[55:18] feelings
[55:20] anytime we make decisions we can all
[55:22] Fellowship on this but I don't want to
[55:24] dwell in anything negative anytime we've
[55:27] ever made a decision on feelings
[55:29] those are the times we usually have to
[55:31] come back and say forgive me Lord
[55:35] right even forgive me to one another
[55:37] here because feelings itself is never to
[55:41] be what we're led by but it's the
[55:43] Loyalty of our heart that is we're
[55:45] standing in the midst and standing true
[55:47] and I pray that God will help me to get
[55:49] to some more examples tonight it's what
[55:52] takes the material and that material
[55:54] we're talking about is our character
[55:58] and there's no other way for character
[56:00] to be molded in our life outside of
[56:03] God's life being in us and tester trials
[56:07] coming our way that actually brings out
[56:11] that character
[56:12] it's God's way of bringing and unfolding
[56:16] of the character molding it and bringing
[56:19] out of our Lives what needs to be so
[56:22] Abram goes on to say God's children is
[56:24] made up correctly on his word for they
[56:27] are living examples and I want to just
[56:29] mark this right here for they are living
[56:32] examples and the word of God living
[56:35] through them the trial comes to shake
[56:39] you to put you to the very bottom to see
[56:43] where you'll stand and they tested they
[56:45] tried every son that cometh to God let
[56:48] me just say this God is not surprised by
[56:51] your stand
[56:55] he's not surprised God was not surprised
[56:59] at the stand of job he already knew
[57:03] and God himself he's not surprised when
[57:07] there has been lives tested and they go
[57:09] astray God's not been surprised by that
[57:12] God's not said oh my goodness I thought
[57:14] there was really something holding on
[57:16] there I wonder what goes on no that's
[57:18] you and me sometimes we can look
[57:20] sometimes and we see situations and see
[57:23] settings and you look and you think my
[57:25] goodness if I thought anybody had had
[57:27] this or had that and you look at it
[57:29] because you know why all we can see is
[57:31] what's on the outside
[57:34] I do believe whatever's on the inside
[57:36] will come to the outside but whatever's
[57:39] on the inside even when the outside's
[57:41] getting attacked there is a strength and
[57:44] an anchor that holds within the Veil
[57:48] just like the prophet when he came to
[57:50] the situation in his own life
[57:55] he was tested in faithfulness
[57:59] is that right and remember he listened
[58:02] to his mother-in-law
[58:05] that did not change God's mind about him
[58:10] brother Branham told us to use my
[58:12] mistakes as stepping stones of God's
[58:14] grace for you for me
[58:17] he he yielded to that voice of what she
[58:21] said or was it feelings
[58:24] and here then his wife is taken here his
[58:27] daughter is taken I tell you what
[58:29] friends there's been many people that
[58:31] have lost their faith under much less
[58:33] conditions
[58:37] showing the strength of that faith in
[58:41] our life by the New Birth when Satan
[58:44] came up next to him and stood right
[58:47] there while he was looking at his
[58:48] daughter and he prayed and asked God and
[58:51] a black sheep was pulled right down in
[58:53] front of him as if God was saying shut
[58:56] up I don't even want to hear your prayer
[58:58] is that what the prophet said he said
[59:01] his God was loving I don't even want to
[59:02] hear it
[59:04] but he said even while everything that
[59:06] Satan was saying he said I was about
[59:09] ready to say if that's the way he's
[59:12] going to be
[59:14] are you hearing me Satan came up and the
[59:17] prophet said every bit of reasoning
[59:20] agreed with him
[59:24] but up from the midst in his life said
[59:27] yay though he slaved me yet I will serve
[59:32] him
[59:33] it shows you and I we're not serving God
[59:37] by the intellect of our mind we're not
[59:40] serving God by our feelings because that
[59:43] will waver and up and down and up and
[59:46] down but there's got to be an eye on the
[59:48] inside that's greater than you or me I'm
[59:52] talking about the I am I will serve thee
[59:56] it's got to be Christ inside of you
[1:00:01] times friends when you talk with
[1:00:03] individuals and lives and I get you know
[1:00:06] calls and get things individuals well I
[1:00:08] really want to serve God and I really
[1:00:10] want to do this and you come back and
[1:00:12] say but you've got to get to the bottom
[1:00:14] of it it's more than a feeling I believe
[1:00:18] in Emotion but you've got to have a real
[1:00:20] dying to yourself
[1:00:22] not God come on top of your life he
[1:00:25] won't do that
[1:00:27] you've gotta you've gotta hate your own
[1:00:29] life
[1:00:31] you've got to see your own life you are
[1:00:33] sinful
[1:00:35] you need almighty God you don't need a
[1:00:38] church you don't need a church book you
[1:00:40] need almighty God
[1:00:43] you need the blood to be applied to your
[1:00:46] life he shed his blood not that it would
[1:00:49] just go to the Earth but that the Holy
[1:00:51] Ghost might come to your life and
[1:00:53] convince your heart that you're a sinner
[1:00:55] in need of a mighty God in need of
[1:00:58] atonement
[1:01:05] I think how Satan wants to confuse that
[1:01:07] and the real reason it comes down to it
[1:01:10] is lives and people want to hang on to
[1:01:13] their own life
[1:01:15] and if you hang on to it the scripture
[1:01:18] says you'll lose it
[1:01:20] but if you're willing to forsake it
[1:01:24] you'll receive life
[1:01:26] we're given that choice in this hour and
[1:01:30] the prophet said oh to think
[1:01:32] if that new birth hadn't been there
[1:01:37] let me tell you friends what is keeping
[1:01:40] when you see lives and you see hearts
[1:01:42] all the way through even through our
[1:01:45] little group and body of Believers when
[1:01:47] you see faithful lives and you see
[1:01:48] hearts that are pillars because God
[1:01:51] we've got some pillars here
[1:01:54] are you hearing me now I want to just
[1:01:56] just remind you that it is not because
[1:02:00] somebody has some kind of good DNA
[1:02:03] what I'm trying to say is is that it's
[1:02:06] got to be the love of God on the inside
[1:02:09] it takes God beating in the heart of the
[1:02:13] individual that's the Loyalty that God
[1:02:15] is craving that's what God is Desiring
[1:02:19] is there is a loyalty from our heart and
[1:02:22] that's what molds real character
[1:02:26] now
[1:02:28] think of this in this manner Proverbs
[1:02:31] chapter 20 verse 6.
[1:02:35] let me refer back to a scripture here
[1:02:37] before that in Galatians 2 20. Paul said
[1:02:40] I am crucified with Christ
[1:02:43] so he made a way that you and I could
[1:02:47] die to ourselves
[1:02:49] Calvary was not just about him Calvary
[1:02:52] was about you and me
[1:02:54] I am crucified with Christ
[1:02:57] nevertheless I lived yet not I but
[1:03:01] Christ liveth in me
[1:03:05] and the life which I now live in the
[1:03:08] flesh I live by the faith of the Son of
[1:03:13] God who loved me and gave himself
[1:03:17] for me
[1:03:19] so Paul how are you living I'm living by
[1:03:22] the faith
[1:03:24] of the son of God
[1:03:26] who gave himself who loved me and gave
[1:03:29] himself for me Paul is living by direct
[1:03:33] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:03:37] Paul do you get down yeah
[1:03:39] do you have fears come around you know
[1:03:42] we can go to many places on scripture
[1:03:43] fears come around but Paul how are you
[1:03:46] living how is it that you're persevering
[1:03:50] how is it that you know persecution is
[1:03:53] coming your way how is it that you're
[1:03:55] aware that that your life being hunted
[1:03:58] down how is it that you're able to keep
[1:04:01] going because I'm not living for myself
[1:04:04] any longer
[1:04:07] I'm living by the faith of the Son of
[1:04:11] God Who Loved Me
[1:04:12] and gave himself from me
[1:04:15] so I
[1:04:16] trust we see that parallel of how God
[1:04:19] himself
[1:04:20] reveals himself faithful and as God
[1:04:24] reveals himself faithful and makes
[1:04:26] himself known it has an effect upon his
[1:04:30] children
[1:04:32] Proverbs 20 verse 6 let me go through
[1:04:34] some scriptures here
[1:04:36] most men will Proclaim everyone his own
[1:04:41] goodness
[1:04:42] but a faithful man
[1:04:44] who can find
[1:04:46] so maybe we put this in the vernacular
[1:04:49] of our common terms every man can toot
[1:04:52] his own horn
[1:04:55] strut his own stuff
[1:04:57] put his own
[1:05:00] decalogue on Facebook or whatever of who
[1:05:02] he is
[1:05:03] but who can find a faithful man
[1:05:07] see this is a request this was this is a
[1:05:09] request who is a faithful man
[1:05:13] a faithful man is not a man that's about
[1:05:16] himself
[1:05:18] this is where God is laying this down
[1:05:20] who can but a faithful man who can find
[1:05:23] faithful to what
[1:05:26] faithful to the word of God
[1:05:29] Psalms 12 verse 1 this this same thought
[1:05:32] moves throughout the scripture here and
[1:05:34] I've read this scripture to you before
[1:05:35] as far as the whole passage but
[1:05:37] here David help Lord For The Godly Man
[1:05:41] ceaseth for the faithful fail from Among
[1:05:45] The Children of Men
[1:05:47] if in notice David's seeing Godly men
[1:05:50] are failing
[1:05:52] the faithful are failing from among the
[1:05:55] children of men well who's going to do
[1:05:57] something about it help God
[1:06:00] it's going to take God
[1:06:02] if there's any faithfulness restored
[1:06:05] it's got to come by a faithful God
[1:06:08] moving on the scene
[1:06:10] in that same scripture those passages in
[1:06:13] that chapter where David goes on to
[1:06:15] seeing how that where there were men
[1:06:17] that were just you know saying any old
[1:06:19] thing and living on any old kind of life
[1:06:21] but notice as he went on and I don't
[1:06:24] have it up there but God withheld his
[1:06:27] words from that generation you see God
[1:06:30] won't reveal himself if we fail to be
[1:06:34] faithful in what he's already shown
[1:06:37] the Bible said the first principle and
[1:06:40] who whosoever cometh to God must first
[1:06:42] believe that he is and that he is a
[1:06:45] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:06:48] after him
[1:06:50] oh my I tell you friends we're not
[1:06:53] seeking after a feeling we're seeking
[1:06:55] after him
[1:06:57] don't worry when you get him he'll bring
[1:06:59] feelings
[1:07:00] he'll bring emotion but it's getting him
[1:07:03] first it's seeking after him not to
[1:07:07] where have I got enough completed God's
[1:07:09] not a checklist he is a person that
[1:07:13] desires a relationship with you
[1:07:17] any man can give you a checklist Peter
[1:07:21] on the day of Pentecost never gave him a
[1:07:24] checklist they wanted to know what do we
[1:07:26] have to do to be saved
[1:07:30] why the person have been revealed he had
[1:07:33] brought conviction upon their lives and
[1:07:37] the same God who brings conviction
[1:07:38] reveals he is our way
[1:07:43] Ecclesiastes 7 verse 27 behold this have
[1:07:47] I found saith the preacher counting one
[1:07:49] by one to find out the account which yet
[1:07:52] my soul seeketh but I find not one man
[1:07:55] among a thousand have I found but a
[1:07:57] woman among all those have I not found
[1:08:00] sometimes the way the scripture is
[1:08:01] worded it's saying I have not found a
[1:08:04] man and I have not found a woman among a
[1:08:08] thousand
[1:08:09] you're taking a breath of people to find
[1:08:13] a man and a woman are you understanding
[1:08:15] me now
[1:08:16] you see God still regards a man a man
[1:08:19] and a woman a woman
[1:08:21] the Bible said he made them male and
[1:08:24] female
[1:08:25] God Don't Make sissies
[1:08:28] God don't do that that's Satan
[1:08:31] are you with me Satan gets in there
[1:08:34] through perversion with it with the
[1:08:36] desire to lead people to destruction
[1:08:40] but notice God makes a man and a woman
[1:08:42] let me just say this to you know when
[1:08:45] you look at it thank God there should be
[1:08:47] a real desire in our hearts even as
[1:08:49] parents whether we have boys or we have
[1:08:51] girls and even when we have here in this
[1:08:54] assembly we want to see real men and we
[1:08:56] want to see real women we want to raise
[1:08:59] them in the admonition of the lord we
[1:09:01] want the real principles because that's
[1:09:04] a responsibility that we're taught not
[1:09:06] just scriptural principles but the
[1:09:08] scriptural principles have to do with
[1:09:10] every facet of our life but to also know
[1:09:14] that in order to be the man that God
[1:09:16] intended you to be and the woman God
[1:09:19] intended you to be you must be born
[1:09:21] again by the same Holy Ghost and God
[1:09:25] himself is the one who makes a real man
[1:09:27] and a real woman
[1:09:30] he did it in the beginning in the garden
[1:09:32] and he's the same God today
[1:09:36] verse 29 Lord this is what I was saying
[1:09:39] Lo this only have I found that God hath
[1:09:43] made man upright but they sought out
[1:09:46] many inventions God made man in the
[1:09:48] beginning upright
[1:09:50] and let me tell you
[1:09:51] God never changed his desire
[1:09:54] God never changed his intention or his
[1:09:57] purpose God still with every life and
[1:10:01] through and by the shedding of the blood
[1:10:03] God has made a way that man or woman can
[1:10:07] come right back into the land of
[1:10:09] uprightness which is the very
[1:10:12] righteousness of God
[1:10:15] I tell you what God makes the Bible goes
[1:10:17] on to say in the same book no man can
[1:10:20] add to it or take away from it when God
[1:10:22] does a work in a person's life I'm
[1:10:24] telling you the devil can't touch it
[1:10:26] is that right Brethren when the seal has
[1:10:30] been laid down listen the Holy Ghost
[1:10:32] isn't something you gain and lose and
[1:10:34] gain and lose that might be on your
[1:10:36] spirit but when that show has been born
[1:10:39] again by the spirit of the Living God
[1:10:41] there ain't enough Devils out of hell
[1:10:44] that can ever talk you out of it or take
[1:10:47] you away why because God is faithful
[1:10:52] do I say tonight if you've lived an up
[1:10:54] and down life you're missing what God
[1:10:57] has for you
[1:11:00] nobody can ever lay that on God
[1:11:02] notice another scripture Jeremiah 5
[1:11:04] verse 1. remember this is in the time
[1:11:07] of where Israel is getting ready to go
[1:11:09] into captivity
[1:11:10] because Israel
[1:11:13] had abandoned the things of God
[1:11:17] is that right
[1:11:19] I want you to watch here in Jeremiah 5
[1:11:21] verse 1. same principle run you to and
[1:11:23] fro through the streets of Jerusalem and
[1:11:26] see now and know and seek in the broad
[1:11:29] places thereof if you can find a man if
[1:11:33] there be any that executed judgment that
[1:11:36] seeketh the truth and I will pardon it
[1:11:40] you know what God is saying I'll pardon
[1:11:42] this whole city if I can find one
[1:11:45] one one the executed judgment
[1:11:48] discernment
[1:11:50] one that seeketh truth
[1:11:53] I'll pardon it
[1:11:54] but he said though they say the Lord
[1:11:56] liveth surely they swear falsely
[1:11:59] so then God has let you know friends
[1:12:01] when I look at the scripture God
[1:12:03] remember we see it in Esther an
[1:12:05] intercessory life we're seeing an
[1:12:07] Abraham Abraham was an intercessor when
[1:12:10] the word was revealed to him is that
[1:12:12] right Abraham didn't code over where lot
[1:12:15] was he stood right there and said God
[1:12:17] he's down there but would you spare it
[1:12:19] for one you know of the down from 30 to
[1:12:22] 10 and on and on but to understand that
[1:12:24] there God himself I tell you I look at
[1:12:27] this principle right here if there's one
[1:12:29] in your home
[1:12:31] it allows God to visit
[1:12:34] if there's one you be that one
[1:12:38] say God I want to live if my children
[1:12:41] aren't living for you if my loved ones
[1:12:43] aren't living for you but let me stand
[1:12:45] true Lord don't let me cut Corners don't
[1:12:48] let me make excuses but let me stay true
[1:12:51] to your word Lord God because they need
[1:12:54] lies and I know you to be the life Giver
[1:12:57] who can find a faithful man
[1:13:02] Hallelujah all friends you know what I'm
[1:13:04] talking about you know many times we
[1:13:06] hear that I don't know if it's a phrase
[1:13:07] among everybody but I found it to be
[1:13:09] true whether it's a southern phrase or
[1:13:12] whatever when it says blood is thicker
[1:13:14] than water I have found that to be the
[1:13:16] truth
[1:13:17] that blood will turn right around on you
[1:13:19] family will turn around and they'll walk
[1:13:22] right over the word of God to cover up
[1:13:24] for their family
[1:13:26] I'm just going to preach truth now but
[1:13:29] you know what that doesn't do one thing
[1:13:30] it's not just that you're walking in
[1:13:32] Disobedience but it don't do one thing
[1:13:35] for that person that you really want to
[1:13:37] see health because it is not your flesh
[1:13:39] that can help anybody
[1:13:42] I tell you what happens when you go
[1:13:43] along with sin you're only cuddling and
[1:13:46] coddling and nursing spirits and them
[1:13:49] Spirits themselves it only gives it a
[1:13:51] betting ground to stay there longer but
[1:13:54] if you'll stand for the word of God and
[1:13:56] the truth and say whosoever on the
[1:13:58] Lord's Side let him come over here
[1:14:02] then God can go to work on their heart
[1:14:05] I can't go to work on your son and
[1:14:07] daughter's heart or anybody's heart if
[1:14:09] you're not staying true to the word of
[1:14:10] God
[1:14:12] who
[1:14:14] that's free
[1:14:16] Micah 7 2.
[1:14:20] the good man
[1:14:22] is perished out of the earth now you
[1:14:25] know it would be one thing to be for for
[1:14:27] this to be written about Babylon for it
[1:14:30] to be written about other nations
[1:14:32] this these scriptures that I'm reading
[1:14:35] from Ecclesiastes being Solomon
[1:14:39] from these other scriptures Jeremiah and
[1:14:41] now Micah this is referring to Israel
[1:14:44] yeah
[1:14:46] at one time if you recall in the
[1:14:49] scriptures God even says in the book of
[1:14:51] Isaiah what is happened to the faithful
[1:14:54] City
[1:14:56] that now has become a harlot
[1:14:59] how did it get to be this way now you
[1:15:02] understand they didn't have the presence
[1:15:04] of God how did Church systems today get
[1:15:07] to the place that they are it didn't
[1:15:09] start overnight it started by one slight
[1:15:13] deviation from the word of God
[1:15:16] to fail to accept him to be the same
[1:15:18] yesterday today and forever to where we
[1:15:21] read here in the Book of Revelations for
[1:15:25] this age we're setting in they put him
[1:15:28] out of the church they don't want a
[1:15:30] genuine experience they don't want him
[1:15:32] dealing with their life they don't want
[1:15:34] him correcting him they look at it and
[1:15:36] say you're touching menial things that
[1:15:39] do not matter I want the grace of God
[1:15:41] will a news flash the grace of God comes
[1:15:44] to bring transformation in our lives not
[1:15:47] what we deserve not what we've merited
[1:15:50] but what God in His Grace has provided
[1:15:53] because he sees what we have need of
[1:15:56] right and Micah's standing here and says
[1:15:59] the good man is perished out of the
[1:16:02] earth and there is none upright among
[1:16:04] men they all lie in wait for blood they
[1:16:07] hunt every man his brother with a net
[1:16:11] what a testimony this is about Jerusalem
[1:16:15] but I'll tell you God's made a promise
[1:16:18] he said when I gather you back
[1:16:20] you will be seen
[1:16:23] the Lord is our righteousness
[1:16:27] the Lord is our rest the Lord is our and
[1:16:31] God himself not only is he bringing him
[1:16:33] into the land but God's going to bring
[1:16:34] him into the real Promised Land of the
[1:16:36] Holy Ghost
[1:16:37] oh my now notice why all of this think
[1:16:40] of it but as we have referred to in the
[1:16:42] Book of Job I'm just going to skip over
[1:16:44] the scriptures but because you're
[1:16:46] familiar with them but how that it was
[1:16:48] even noted of how that job himself was a
[1:16:51] perfect and upright man then you find
[1:16:54] God testifying of this later in chapter
[1:16:57] one then after Things Fall Apart and yes
[1:17:00] you know his children are taken uh you
[1:17:03] know different sheep can't all that and
[1:17:05] then yet within it here God brags on him
[1:17:08] again when Satan comes up and says have
[1:17:11] you considered my servant job who is a
[1:17:14] perfect and upright man one that feareth
[1:17:16] God and askeweth Evil and God goes on to
[1:17:18] say even through the midst of all you're
[1:17:21] putting on him he still is holding fast
[1:17:24] his integrity
[1:17:27] I tell you there's something deeper
[1:17:28] inside of job than job
[1:17:31] there's something deeper in you than
[1:17:33] just you something deeper in me than
[1:17:35] just me I tell you friends that's the
[1:17:37] reality of the anchor let me tell you
[1:17:39] something The Testament trial not only
[1:17:41] is it coming to mold and shape our
[1:17:43] character but you know what it comes to
[1:17:45] bring you an out to a place to the
[1:17:46] bottom like the prophet said that you
[1:17:48] and I can only look and recognize it's
[1:17:51] got to be God right here in the depths
[1:17:53] of my life I'm not the one who's holding
[1:17:55] on but it's Christ who's got a hold of
[1:17:58] me that through the midst of it all I
[1:18:00] love him I thank him for through it all
[1:18:02] though I don't understand what's going
[1:18:04] on or taking place but yet I love him
[1:18:09] my glory be to God in the highest now to
[1:18:12] think of it you know God had that
[1:18:14] confidence in job because he had
[1:18:17] fellowshipped with job not just talk to
[1:18:20] him like you and me would talk but he
[1:18:22] had Fellowship he had communion God had
[1:18:24] revealed himself to job through him by
[1:18:28] the sacrifice so they had things in
[1:18:30] common so God's when God was putting
[1:18:33] forth this this examination God was not
[1:18:36] wandering back not eating his
[1:18:37] fingernails he wasn't wondering he
[1:18:39] wasn't pacing the floors like oh my
[1:18:41] goodness I hope job's going to do it I
[1:18:43] hope but friends let me tell you you've
[1:18:45] heard that time and time again but
[1:18:47] neither is God doing that for you and I
[1:18:49] a test or trial is not given to see us
[1:18:53] fail
[1:18:55] is that right it's not given to see us
[1:18:58] fail but God himself is given under his
[1:19:01] permission that it might work out to our
[1:19:04] Glory that through that character might
[1:19:06] be molded and you and I can realize
[1:19:08] there's something deeper anchored and
[1:19:10] holding in my life even God working in
[1:19:14] your life when you don't even see it and
[1:19:16] realize that he's working but he's
[1:19:18] working and you know what that's the
[1:19:20] secret in you of the Loyalty of your
[1:19:22] heart that's beating out that material
[1:19:24] what do you think it is that brings you
[1:19:26] to a place when you're in the midst of a
[1:19:29] test trial and you come through that and
[1:19:31] you begin to see yourself not as the
[1:19:34] victim but you begin to see yourself
[1:19:36] that God I'm in need of you Lord and
[1:19:39] you're molding out of my life what do
[1:19:41] you think brings that I'll tell you what
[1:19:42] brings it the same hidden power that was
[1:19:45] in Samson the same hidden power that was
[1:19:48] in job it is the secret of God's life
[1:19:51] working in your own life
[1:19:54] and you step back I step back and say I
[1:19:57] had nothing to do with it
[1:19:59] outside of surrendering
[1:20:02] and we didn't even realize that
[1:20:05] so God's confidence is himself operating
[1:20:09] through his own word
[1:20:12] that's where God's confidence was in job
[1:20:14] that's why that God's God's real
[1:20:17] confidence is God God places his love
[1:20:20] his life inside of you and me and then
[1:20:23] that's what God has confidence in you
[1:20:26] realize that's what the Holy Ghost is
[1:20:27] let me tell you we listen friends when
[1:20:29] God when the Seal of the Holy Ghost has
[1:20:31] come God has accepted your faith God has
[1:20:34] confidence in you
[1:20:36] and let me just tell you something like
[1:20:38] that once that seal has been given you
[1:20:41] can't break that confidence
[1:20:43] it's true you might fail but you know
[1:20:46] what on the inside as soon as you fail
[1:20:48] even if it's a thought there is
[1:20:50] conviction that strikes your heart why
[1:20:52] because there is a faithfulness that
[1:20:54] beats for God down on the inside
[1:20:57] you can't break the seal of the Living
[1:20:59] God
[1:21:01] amen it's God's confidence and security
[1:21:03] upon our life and this is why that the
[1:21:06] faithfulness brother Brandon would put
[1:21:08] it this way indeed if Jesus Christ I got
[1:21:10] to read this he talks about God making a
[1:21:12] contract and he said it was not because
[1:21:14] you were good not because you joined the
[1:21:16] church not because you're a good member
[1:21:18] of society uh you could be ever so good
[1:21:21] you could live a clean life you could go
[1:21:23] to church every day you can sacrifice
[1:21:25] every day you can give a part of your
[1:21:27] money you can give up all the sins of
[1:21:29] the world and everything and live just
[1:21:31] as true and faithful as you can and
[1:21:34] you'll miss Heaven just as far as East
[1:21:37] is from the West
[1:21:39] now some of those things if we're not
[1:21:41] careful listen I believe God brings
[1:21:43] about all of these realities in a life
[1:21:47] are you hearing me I believe God brings
[1:21:49] these realities right here what I just
[1:21:51] read about
[1:21:52] but you see sometimes if we're not
[1:21:53] careful we can get everything just right
[1:21:56] out here and everything so forth and
[1:21:59] then that's in itself when we look at
[1:22:00] and say what in the world happened
[1:22:03] it's because it's more this and listen
[1:22:05] the message is not do's and don'ts the
[1:22:08] message is not a Creed book the message
[1:22:11] is Christ the son of man being revealed
[1:22:13] to you in you and through you
[1:22:16] that's the reality of this word not a
[1:22:21] book that we live by but a divine
[1:22:23] revelation that he gave himself for me
[1:22:27] that I could walk out of here with a
[1:22:29] purge life a free life I can walk with I
[1:22:33] can walk with a burning reality of
[1:22:35] Christ inside of my life
[1:22:37] so notice he said you can be just as
[1:22:39] true and faithful as you can but you'll
[1:22:41] miss Heaven just as far as East is from
[1:22:43] the West somebody says well well what
[1:22:45] good does that do of being faithful
[1:22:46] going to church or faithful you're
[1:22:47] missing the point if you're resting on
[1:22:50] that you're resting on the wrong thing
[1:22:53] this is what we have to rest on it isn't
[1:22:57] by goodness that we are saved but it's
[1:22:59] by his Mercy that we're bought that God
[1:23:02] wanted to make Sons and Daughters
[1:23:04] goodness never makes them the spirit of
[1:23:08] God makes them if it wasn't so he
[1:23:10] wouldn't have had the sin the Holy Ghost
[1:23:13] so it takes the yoking power of the Holy
[1:23:16] Ghost to unite us with the word of God
[1:23:20] and I want to just refer here into the
[1:23:22] scripture of Luke chapter 18 and verse
[1:23:25] 1. I don't have verse 1 there but I want
[1:23:27] to read it here out of the scripture and
[1:23:29] it said that Jesus speaking of the
[1:23:31] unjust judge is said he spake a parable
[1:23:34] unto them to this end that men ought
[1:23:36] always to pray and not to faint
[1:23:41] remember he talked it goes on in this
[1:23:43] scripture speaking about that Widow
[1:23:45] so you came to that unjust judge on that
[1:23:48] judge's doorstep
[1:23:49] and she stayed there
[1:23:52] he
[1:23:54] he tried to get her away
[1:23:56] she kept on coming avenge me of my
[1:23:58] adversary
[1:24:01] but you know he himself
[1:24:04] would say though I don't fear God nor
[1:24:07] regard man but because this Widow
[1:24:09] troubles me I will Avenger lest by her
[1:24:11] continual coming she weary me so this is
[1:24:15] what listen
[1:24:16] right there the Bible says
[1:24:19] in verse 1 that men ought always to pray
[1:24:21] and not to faint
[1:24:24] now if I went by feelings many times
[1:24:27] I wouldn't pray
[1:24:31] I I know I'm preaching not to Angels
[1:24:33] tonight
[1:24:34] if I went by feelings
[1:24:37] sometimes it feels like
[1:24:39] nothing's moving
[1:24:41] nothing's getting answered
[1:24:44] but you don't pray based on your
[1:24:47] feelings
[1:24:49] your prayer is offered up to him
[1:24:53] who is a faithful and merciful high
[1:24:56] priest
[1:24:57] so we're not praying to an idol
[1:25:00] that's why we don't treat it like that
[1:25:03] it's a relationship
[1:25:05] I don't just talk to my wife at the
[1:25:07] dinner table I don't just talk to her
[1:25:09] you know at night after the kids have
[1:25:11] gone to bed and maybe we we sit around I
[1:25:14] don't just talk to her then but I talk
[1:25:16] to her at different times maybe
[1:25:17] throughout the day
[1:25:19] maybe sometimes when I'm there at the
[1:25:20] house and sometimes walking by other
[1:25:22] times it's by text or whatever that's a
[1:25:25] relationship with God
[1:25:27] so what are you saying brother Samuel
[1:25:28] prayer is not check
[1:25:31] it's been fulfilled for the day
[1:25:34] prayer is ongoing talking to him
[1:25:37] it might start with 10 minutes then
[1:25:39] you're going and doing these things then
[1:25:41] here you've got another five minutes
[1:25:43] didn't you sure there's times where you
[1:25:45] have durations of times
[1:25:48] but you and I both know sometimes when
[1:25:50] you try to just set durations of times
[1:25:55] yeah a lot of other things been on your
[1:25:57] mind
[1:25:59] and you never really got free during you
[1:26:01] made that period of time but you never
[1:26:02] really got free but you see what God
[1:26:04] shows us in that and it's not that that
[1:26:06] in itself is void or vain but it goes to
[1:26:08] show us that it's it's a relationship
[1:26:10] with him
[1:26:12] it's powerful to even start the day in
[1:26:14] prayer
[1:26:16] just just a little bit but you see this
[1:26:19] is the thing there are prayers that's
[1:26:21] being offered up to avenge me of my
[1:26:22] enemy my adversary and I'll tell you we
[1:26:25] got one adversary and that's the devil
[1:26:28] we are living in the hour in the time
[1:26:30] where we realize in Revelations 5 when
[1:26:34] the lamb has taken the book you find no
[1:26:36] mention of the devil in Revelations 5.
[1:26:39] you find no mention of him you know why
[1:26:41] he'd been cast down
[1:26:43] amen now let me just say this he's still
[1:26:46] there in Heavenly places but he has been
[1:26:49] cast down from challenging and coming
[1:26:53] against your life
[1:26:56] I know it may sounds like well how can
[1:26:58] that be he's he's railing against us on
[1:27:00] and on what I'm saying to you is that
[1:27:02] the accuser's arguments have been
[1:27:04] dismantled by the lamb himself you have
[1:27:08] a blood you have a word that is a sure
[1:27:11] word of Prophecy you have a word that
[1:27:13] when the accuser comes you can point it
[1:27:15] right back to the word your life your
[1:27:18] experience is based on the word your
[1:27:20] heart is beating there and what is it
[1:27:22] he's cast down out of your life he has
[1:27:25] no place for a foothold
[1:27:30] unless we allow him
[1:27:34] but if he wants to get into the mind at
[1:27:37] some point
[1:27:38] the lamb is still present
[1:27:40] to come and remind us of our rights
[1:27:42] casting down
[1:27:44] cast him out aren't you glad for that
[1:27:46] but we got we got one adversary and
[1:27:48] that's the devil and I want you to
[1:27:50] notice here in verse 8 it says when that
[1:27:53] speak of unless when the son of man
[1:27:55] would come when he cometh shall he find
[1:27:58] faith on the earth remember how brother
[1:28:00] Brown would take that over and over when
[1:28:01] he would preach that and he would take
[1:28:03] it out of contending earnestly
[1:28:04] contending for the faith and on and on
[1:28:06] he said God was not coming back looking
[1:28:09] for shall I find churches
[1:28:11] that's not the question
[1:28:13] shall I find programs that won the
[1:28:16] question if the question was shall I
[1:28:18] find faith
[1:28:20] and the faith that he's looking for
[1:28:23] is that Faith that'll stand upon his
[1:28:27] word
[1:28:28] and I'll tell you that's more than our
[1:28:30] human Faith human faith can go so far
[1:28:34] it can go so far but that's it but you
[1:28:37] see God never intended you and I to walk
[1:28:40] by our human faith
[1:28:43] listen I've said it over and over you've
[1:28:45] got it when you've got in your car you
[1:28:47] came here tonight you didn't wonder and
[1:28:49] think about is my car going to start you
[1:28:51] did not think about what if I'm going to
[1:28:53] get there all right tonight you didn't
[1:28:55] think about that that's Faith but God is
[1:28:58] looking for his faith
[1:29:02] is that right it must be his faith so
[1:29:05] then how can it be that God recognizing
[1:29:07] our faith it's when his faith is what's
[1:29:11] behind it
[1:29:13] and that's what moves it from just human
[1:29:17] faith to Supernatural faith will I find
[1:29:21] faith on the Earth
[1:29:23] brother Brown said like this Christ is
[1:29:25] looking for men and women tonight
[1:29:27] who will stand out with the love of God
[1:29:30] regardless
[1:29:33] the world's looking tonight for someone
[1:29:36] to display the real genuine Faith Of God
[1:29:40] no matter what people say
[1:29:45] I know we say we're sticks and stones
[1:29:48] you know might break my bones but words
[1:29:50] will never hurt me
[1:29:53] I don't know what fool came up with that
[1:29:54] but that ain't true hmm
[1:29:57] that ain't true words hurt
[1:30:01] offenses come is that right it's true
[1:30:04] no doubt some there's some Sometimes
[1:30:06] some things you might be dealing with
[1:30:08] the words that were spoken to you when
[1:30:09] you were just a young child
[1:30:12] things that were said
[1:30:14] even by a teacher or by somebody
[1:30:16] words are effective
[1:30:19] is that right
[1:30:21] but I want you to understand just as
[1:30:23] much as words can come in that way
[1:30:26] and I don't want you to look listen to
[1:30:28] me now that's not to say to take an
[1:30:31] attitude towards that person who spoke
[1:30:33] those things
[1:30:34] because you'll remain in bondage I'm
[1:30:37] just going to go with it right now
[1:30:38] you'll remain in bondage if you live
[1:30:40] under that right there because what
[1:30:42] Satan has wanted to do is to build a
[1:30:44] trap in your life to keep a place for
[1:30:46] bitterness to build up
[1:30:48] but if you can recognize there is one
[1:30:51] here tonight with a greater word
[1:30:53] a word that's able to bring a loosening
[1:30:56] and a power and a liberty to your life
[1:30:58] one who knows who you are who knows the
[1:31:02] potentials that lay into you your true
[1:31:05] identity and what do I do brother Samuel
[1:31:07] let go of those other things and take
[1:31:10] hold of this word that wants to take
[1:31:12] hold in your life
[1:31:14] let him come in and bring healing there
[1:31:16] in your life no matter what people say a
[1:31:19] real love of God that'll reached down
[1:31:20] that no matter what people say and what
[1:31:23] the circumstance is in how I feel or
[1:31:28] what it looks like
[1:31:29] that's why there's the need of that
[1:31:31] genuine faith of God
[1:31:33] and I want you to think of this
[1:31:35] Peter would write it like this to them
[1:31:37] that have obtained like Precious Faith
[1:31:40] with us through the righteousness of God
[1:31:43] and our Savior Jesus Christ so this is
[1:31:46] how the faith of God comes back in and
[1:31:48] that's what this message come to do for
[1:31:51] you and I it came to restore real Bible
[1:31:55] faith
[1:31:57] listen not that there would be people
[1:32:00] believing in the Bible there's many
[1:32:01] people believe in the Bible but it's to
[1:32:04] restore Bible faith
[1:32:07] and that Bible faith is the faith of the
[1:32:10] Son of God it's the faith of God himself
[1:32:13] the same God who moved down and spoke in
[1:32:15] the beginning and believed his own word
[1:32:17] the same God who Moved Upon A Man by the
[1:32:20] name of Abraham and dealt with his life
[1:32:23] and worked in his life all along and you
[1:32:26] watch that Faith grow and grow through
[1:32:28] every little bit of failure mistake but
[1:32:30] yet that Faith continued to grow as
[1:32:33] Abraham surrendered himself to God so
[1:32:36] much
[1:32:37] to elohim's Faith itself was reproduced
[1:32:41] through Abraham's life who was it that
[1:32:44] brought Isaac elohim's faith who was it
[1:32:48] that led that that brought caused
[1:32:50] Abraham to go up on there on the
[1:32:52] mountain with Isaac it was elohim's
[1:32:54] faith you said I thought it was Abraham
[1:32:57] Abraham's faith it was Abraham's Faith
[1:32:59] but it was a man's faith that all could
[1:33:01] see out here but they're wondering what
[1:33:04] is it about this man that's making him a
[1:33:06] rugged if I could say the prophet's
[1:33:08] terms an oddball to do such a thing is
[1:33:11] because there's a faith behind him
[1:33:14] that's moving him for the word to be
[1:33:16] fulfilled and a type to be given it's
[1:33:19] the faith of Elohim being reproduced in
[1:33:22] the lives of his people
[1:33:24] I know you don't feel like it sometimes
[1:33:26] I don't feel like it but I want you to
[1:33:28] understand even in your daily walk it's
[1:33:32] elohim's Faith being reproduced in your
[1:33:36] life
[1:33:39] you've lived another day in Satan's Eden
[1:33:44] you've been another houring lady you'll
[1:33:46] see ya and you've got your right mind
[1:33:50] I'm telling you that's overcoming power
[1:33:53] let me tell you what's doing that it's
[1:33:55] not your faith alone it's God's faith
[1:33:58] that's moving in your life in an age
[1:34:01] where there's gross Darkness but yet God
[1:34:04] is faithful to his word
[1:34:07] it's God's word being being fulfilled in
[1:34:11] our lives
[1:34:13] Hallelujah let me just can I give you
[1:34:16] two more examples
[1:34:20] we talk about praying
[1:34:23] many times we're praying we're praying
[1:34:25] for things
[1:34:28] but Samuel you ever prayed for things in
[1:34:30] situations that it felt like
[1:34:33] ain't nothing turning around and it
[1:34:35] feels like there ain't if anything at
[1:34:36] all it feels like it's getting worse
[1:34:37] yeah
[1:34:39] yeah
[1:34:42] and when you're going to pray and
[1:34:44] Satan's right there to attack you
[1:34:47] coming right there in your mind and
[1:34:49] saying
[1:34:50] just wanting to bring discouragement to
[1:34:52] try to just get you discouraged
[1:34:57] but that's a time to persevere
[1:35:00] I tell you
[1:35:02] I stand here tonight there's and I know
[1:35:04] I'm speaking to fellow Believers there's
[1:35:06] something that raises up there's times
[1:35:08] that when you can come to a place and
[1:35:10] you look at and think I don't know how I
[1:35:13] don't see how
[1:35:14] but there's something in you that won't
[1:35:16] let you stop
[1:35:19] there's something in you that causes you
[1:35:22] to rise back up there's something within
[1:35:25] you that causes you to say I'm going to
[1:35:27] pray one more time
[1:35:31] Hallelujah
[1:35:33] there was a man by the name of amraham
[1:35:35] this just lit my heart
[1:35:38] amram himself brother bran breaks into
[1:35:40] this on teaching of Moses
[1:35:42] of how Abraham and brother Brown you
[1:35:43] know he dramatizes it how Abraham would
[1:35:46] go up to the to The Loft at night
[1:35:48] brother Brown said he would go up there
[1:35:50] and he'd be praying
[1:35:53] and he'd get so tired he'd lay down
[1:35:56] be praying he fall asleep
[1:36:00] no don't let the devil condemn you if
[1:36:02] you fall asleep
[1:36:05] um
[1:36:06] yeah
[1:36:08] but he fell asleep he was praying but
[1:36:09] see every night even though the
[1:36:11] weariness from the day and the tiredness
[1:36:13] and for how many years had he been
[1:36:16] praying the same prayer
[1:36:18] but he went back up there and prayed
[1:36:20] again fell asleep
[1:36:24] but he received a visitation
[1:36:26] from the angel
[1:36:28] and the angel pulled out the sword
[1:36:30] brother REM said he pulled out the sword
[1:36:31] and he pointed to the north over into
[1:36:33] the Promised Land
[1:36:34] and he said
[1:36:36] God
[1:36:37] is coming to deliver his people
[1:36:40] the promise you've been holding to the
[1:36:42] promise you've been praying for the one
[1:36:44] you've been looking through the one that
[1:36:45] you've pushed through wearingness and
[1:36:49] even doubts thoughts that wanted to clog
[1:36:52] your mind I don't think I'll ever see it
[1:36:54] I don't know if it'll ever come come on
[1:36:56] I'm speaking real here I don't know if
[1:36:58] I'll it seems like it's going the
[1:37:00] opposite way everything is getting
[1:37:02] harder and things are coming this way
[1:37:04] but here's what Abraham did he kept
[1:37:06] going back to the one who made the
[1:37:09] promise
[1:37:12] Hallelujah and in the midst of that
[1:37:14] moment God speaks to him like that and
[1:37:17] God tells him brother Graham says I like
[1:37:19] this he said God spoke to Abraham
[1:37:21] Abraham and told him I want you to know
[1:37:23] you're going to play a great part in
[1:37:24] this Abraham because you were faithful
[1:37:27] in prayer and you were faithful in your
[1:37:29] house let me ask you something who was
[1:37:32] it that made him faithful in prayer God
[1:37:34] who was it then made him faithful in his
[1:37:37] house God it's God that does it then he
[1:37:40] turns around and rewards us for yielding
[1:37:43] to his unction
[1:37:45] even when we didn't feel like praying
[1:37:48] even when we didn't feel like it but God
[1:37:51] turns right around and rewards for the
[1:37:54] faithfulness that goes beyond our
[1:37:56] feelings
[1:38:00] what about Hattie right
[1:38:04] what about her the first time the third
[1:38:06] poll was ever used on a human being
[1:38:09] brother perhaps telling the stories
[1:38:13] I was there to see that
[1:38:16] Sea World of the place the the land not
[1:38:18] not the not where she lived her house
[1:38:20] because even her house at that time the
[1:38:22] way the brothers described it to me and
[1:38:24] brother Bram will talk about it on tape
[1:38:25] you could you could actually see through
[1:38:27] the boards and see out but it was one of
[1:38:29] the favorite places for brother Brandon
[1:38:30] to go up there and just to rest and to
[1:38:33] get away and the other brothers they
[1:38:35] would gather up there and different ones
[1:38:37] but how he's telling the story about the
[1:38:39] squirrels and brother Brown moves down
[1:38:42] and he says the only thing I know
[1:38:44] it's Jehovah Jireh
[1:38:47] and about that time with sister Hattie
[1:38:50] it struck and she said that's nothing
[1:38:52] but the truth brother Brown describes it
[1:38:55] in the message speak to the mountain
[1:38:57] 1959 he said it was like a super
[1:38:59] anointing came in the room
[1:39:01] he said I've never felt that he said it
[1:39:04] was a super anointing and came in the
[1:39:06] room and said you tell her she whatever
[1:39:08] she asked for she can have
[1:39:11] she turned to brother Brandman said what
[1:39:14] should I ask for
[1:39:16] remember brother Brandon said here was a
[1:39:18] woman faithful woman she only made 200 a
[1:39:22] year
[1:39:22] and she had put twenty dollars in toward
[1:39:24] the building project
[1:39:26] and here she was standing there so what
[1:39:28] do I ask for now look she's asking a
[1:39:32] prophet for guidance what do I ask for
[1:39:37] and the prophet stands and says well you
[1:39:40] know you know you as a poor person and
[1:39:42] you know you got your sister over here
[1:39:43] and you got your you know mother and you
[1:39:45] you know they're not doing good and
[1:39:46] you're dead and things like that they're
[1:39:48] not doing well now notice all these
[1:39:50] things were here that were temporal that
[1:39:52] were pointed out but you know what what
[1:39:55] was in her heart is what declared itself
[1:39:58] in that moment oh my I tell you what the
[1:40:02] word did in this hour it led us to a
[1:40:04] place to where our heart is able to
[1:40:06] declare and speak out it led us to a
[1:40:10] place my my my I wish I could preach it
[1:40:12] I'll feel it it has led us to a place in
[1:40:15] this reality that is more than temporal
[1:40:18] things of this world life it's more the
[1:40:21] material things or Associates it means
[1:40:24] more than anything because the temporal
[1:40:27] things will pass away
[1:40:29] you can be a rich man tomorrow or today
[1:40:32] and a poor man tomorrow you can be
[1:40:34] healed today and be dead tomorrow but
[1:40:37] once you pass from Death unto life that
[1:40:41] Soul can never anymore die
[1:40:44] it shows the effect of that third pull
[1:40:47] what will it do it draws out the desire
[1:40:50] that's on the inside the word comes to
[1:40:54] lead you and I to Victory and she said
[1:40:57] brother Branham the greatest desire the
[1:41:00] greatest desire brother Brandon what do
[1:41:02] I ask for he said ask for your greatest
[1:41:04] desire
[1:41:06] after he says that and she says my
[1:41:09] greatest desire
[1:41:10] is to see
[1:41:12] my boys
[1:41:15] serving the lord
[1:41:16] now mind you while this is going on
[1:41:18] they're sitting in the corner snickering
[1:41:20] and laughing
[1:41:23] but it didn't matter
[1:41:25] there had been a request that had been
[1:41:27] offered up and Jehovah Jireh stepped in
[1:41:30] and provided the conviction that was
[1:41:31] needed he provided the grace that was
[1:41:34] needed in that moment to lead those
[1:41:36] young boys beyond that of just being
[1:41:38] bondish and kensed in by complexes of
[1:41:42] teenage Hood he led them into Liberty
[1:41:45] what did that Jehovah Jireh
[1:41:50] true
[1:41:53] Proverbs 28 20 a faithful man
[1:41:56] shall abound
[1:41:58] with blessings
[1:42:00] but he that maketh to be rich
[1:42:03] shall not be innocent
[1:42:07] things want to come so quick and so fast
[1:42:09] he that will haste to be rich
[1:42:13] we're going to get this going to get
[1:42:15] that and going to get this I'm going to
[1:42:16] get that and going to get this and so
[1:42:17] many times the enemy pants so many
[1:42:19] things before the eyes of material
[1:42:22] things
[1:42:24] that before long you'll be setting them
[1:42:26] on the street
[1:42:28] you'll be donating them to Goodwill for
[1:42:30] any account
[1:42:34] but a rich man or one who hastens to be
[1:42:37] I got to get this I got to get that
[1:42:39] remember
[1:42:40] it's the rat race that Satan
[1:42:43] wants to try to trap in
[1:42:45] getting looked at all these things even
[1:42:47] listen even among that of our young
[1:42:49] people when you start out you're not
[1:42:51] going to start out like Mom and Dad
[1:42:53] there's things that has to it has to
[1:42:55] grow
[1:42:56] I never forget that you know years ago
[1:42:58] when I heard that sitting around family
[1:43:00] teaching being done and I remember
[1:43:02] hearing that because you know sometimes
[1:43:03] you you look ahead and you look at
[1:43:05] things like that and you think sometimes
[1:43:06] it seems like oh well you know you'll
[1:43:08] never have this or you'll never have
[1:43:09] that I'm just talking about simple
[1:43:10] simple simple necessities of life I'm
[1:43:13] not talking about great big things
[1:43:15] you know what I'm saying
[1:43:17] but it seems like when you look at that
[1:43:19] in that way
[1:43:21] to realize it's God that has provided
[1:43:24] it's taken parents to a place to be able
[1:43:27] to come to that place or the things that
[1:43:29] they would have
[1:43:30] but everyone when you look at this
[1:43:32] through the scripture I'm just gonna
[1:43:33] have to close right here
[1:43:36] anybody that's ever hasted to be rich or
[1:43:38] hasted
[1:43:41] to bypass
[1:43:43] that way
[1:43:47] it always lends itself in failure
[1:43:51] and that's the same way listen now let
[1:43:54] me bring it into the spiritual it's the
[1:43:56] same way
[1:43:58] you can never bypass
[1:44:01] anything with God
[1:44:05] you can't bypass the new birth
[1:44:08] because it can never it'll never be
[1:44:10] it'll be like you trying to add peacock
[1:44:14] feathers to a blackbird
[1:44:18] that can never be by you can't bypass
[1:44:21] even tests and trials
[1:44:24] and looking at others sometimes
[1:44:26] and you look and think man
[1:44:29] I want to get to that place where they
[1:44:31] are
[1:44:32] they didn't get there overnight
[1:44:36] it's been years it's been tests it's
[1:44:38] been trials moldings and shaping that
[1:44:41] has been going on to make that
[1:44:44] to bring that about and the same God
[1:44:47] that has worked in their life is the
[1:44:49] same God
[1:44:50] that's working in your life
[1:44:53] is that right
[1:44:55] a faithful man
[1:44:56] shall abound
[1:44:58] with blessings mine
[1:45:01] let's just let's just close it right
[1:45:03] there
[1:45:04] man don't you love him
[1:45:11] when I read that scripture
[1:45:13] there was a quote I came across
[1:45:16] some weeks maybe months ago
[1:45:19] and brothers talking about brother
[1:45:21] Russell creach
[1:45:22] a brother there in the church and
[1:45:25] brother Brahm had come back in and he
[1:45:27] heard a young
[1:45:29] he heard a young voice that was speaking
[1:45:31] in tongues
[1:45:33] and it was brother Russell's daughter
[1:45:35] Patty
[1:45:37] and here she is a teenager
[1:45:39] brother Brown's looking out and he's
[1:45:40] asking he says
[1:45:42] to Creech where are you and he says my
[1:45:45] he says you know because sister meedy
[1:45:47] had pointed out who it was to brother
[1:45:48] Brandon brother Brown said you know he
[1:45:49] said I dedicated her as a as a little
[1:45:51] baby
[1:45:53] and brother Adam goes in to talk about
[1:45:54] he says what Pentecostal preacher
[1:45:58] or one would desire to have their
[1:46:01] teenager
[1:46:03] doing that
[1:46:05] instead of running out and running
[1:46:07] around in other things
[1:46:09] I mean which which which one of us would
[1:46:11] not desire we want to see our children
[1:46:14] serve the Lord right we want to see our
[1:46:16] children sir Lord that that's of a great
[1:46:18] value and brother Brandon admonishes
[1:46:20] brother Russell at that time he says
[1:46:22] look he says I know
[1:46:23] you labor down there at the interstate
[1:46:25] very hard working on that job he said
[1:46:28] you're laboring for that family to make
[1:46:29] that family a good living
[1:46:32] and not only just not to make them just
[1:46:33] a good living but to labor and to you
[1:46:36] know to bring him here to have him in
[1:46:37] the house of God and he said brother
[1:46:39] Russell he said see he said God rewards
[1:46:42] faithfulness
[1:46:44] sometimes we are looking you know at
[1:46:46] different things accolades but I'll tell
[1:46:48] you there's only one Accolade that I
[1:46:51] look at that's the real that's the
[1:46:53] greatest aim in our life
[1:46:55] and that's the Holy Ghost
[1:46:57] that's more of God
[1:46:59] amen once you've been born again of the
[1:47:01] spirit of God that's that's that's the
[1:47:03] main thing right there that you've met
[1:47:05] God personally
[1:47:06] but then your life continues to grow
[1:47:08] into blossom in him I tell you that that
[1:47:11] that's the real blessing that's the
[1:47:13] blessing we find even as an assembly as
[1:47:16] a church and I say oh God faithful as it
[1:47:18] says in the scripture faithful a
[1:47:20] faithful man shall abound with blessings
[1:47:23] that's my heart's desire
[1:47:26] I want to be faithful
[1:47:28] I want to be faithful in every in
[1:47:30] everything God help me even in the hard
[1:47:32] things
[1:47:33] even in those things that are not just
[1:47:35] the things that are easy but in the
[1:47:36] things that are hard
[1:47:38] we want to be faithful even in these
[1:47:40] small things I skipped over a good part
[1:47:44] of it here tonight but even in small
[1:47:45] things because the scripture tells us
[1:47:47] whosoever is faithful in the least
[1:47:51] will be faithful in the greatest
[1:47:55] so it's being faithful for what God has
[1:47:57] already put into our hands and what do
[1:48:00] we do from here
[1:48:01] oh I believe God I believe God gives us
[1:48:04] the grace that we have need of
[1:48:06] to be faithful
[1:48:08] friends how in the world could you and I
[1:48:10] even come to that place of faithfulness
[1:48:12] if God did not make himself known in
[1:48:14] this hour as the faithful God
[1:48:17] do you realize sometimes I think maybe a
[1:48:20] I hope it don't just slip Us by but to
[1:48:22] realize God coming and fulfilling his
[1:48:24] word he's revealed himself as the
[1:48:27] faithful God
[1:48:29] there's no there's no other
[1:48:32] that can call him that they can say well
[1:48:34] he's a faithful God he gave me a new job
[1:48:36] and he did this and they can quote
[1:48:37] certain certain promises but to see the
[1:48:40] God who comes and confirms every
[1:48:42] scriptural promise
[1:48:44] and makes it live
[1:48:46] and will draw out a people for his
[1:48:49] name's sake
[1:48:50] who will be born of his Same Spirit
[1:48:54] to where in their hearts comes out an
[1:48:57] amen it's God's faithfulness being
[1:49:00] reflected back through our lives
[1:49:03] oh God
[1:49:05] oh God help us Lord even in the moments
[1:49:09] of weariness because we get weary in the
[1:49:11] times where our feelings we wonder is
[1:49:14] anything taking place sometimes when in
[1:49:16] what we're doing and sometimes you might
[1:49:18] feel like you're just going through the
[1:49:19] motions but let me say this to you
[1:49:21] you're not going through the motions
[1:49:23] when your heart is behind that Lord I
[1:49:26] want to be in the house of God Lord I'm
[1:49:28] going to look to you Lord even as in
[1:49:30] prayer sometimes it might seem like oh I
[1:49:33] feel like I'm I'm just just kind of
[1:49:34] beating the wind no your heart is in it
[1:49:37] don't let your feelings
[1:49:39] determine your faithfulness
[1:49:43] but let God who is faithful
[1:49:45] let him be the influence of your life
[1:49:48] amen let's pray
[1:49:52] Heavenly Father
[1:49:56] Lord Jesus
[1:49:58] how faithful you are
[1:50:00] how mindful you are Lord
[1:50:03] Lord God I'm grateful that we can stand
[1:50:06] here
[1:50:07] In This Moment
[1:50:09] and there's not a promise in the
[1:50:11] scripture
[1:50:14] that we would have a question over
[1:50:17] there's not a promise
[1:50:20] that you haven't
[1:50:21] made known before us Lord
[1:50:25] you are the same yesterday today and
[1:50:29] forever
[1:50:30] Lord you have shaken these promises
[1:50:33] before us as your people
[1:50:36] you've made yourself real
[1:50:39] to us and Among Us Lord
[1:50:42] I pray father
[1:50:45] for tonight I want to ask
[1:50:48] Lord for your strength
[1:50:53] Lord I know father is we are gathered
[1:50:55] here there's times
[1:50:58] Lord were we
[1:51:00] can be weary
[1:51:02] the Bible says be not weary and well
[1:51:04] doing
[1:51:05] there's times the Lord where we can
[1:51:07] become weary like is the scripture
[1:51:11] but say it would encourage us and
[1:51:14] admonish us
[1:51:15] to understand
[1:51:17] that Lord our prayers though it may seem
[1:51:19] like we were read there in Luke chapter
[1:51:20] 18 that it might seem like nothing is
[1:51:23] moving
[1:51:26] Lord your Prophet has told us
[1:51:29] that it will say to this mountain be
[1:51:31] thou removed
[1:51:33] plucked up and cast and Yonder sea
[1:51:36] we may not see it or hear it
[1:51:39] but one grain of sand has turned loose
[1:51:42] and has been removed
[1:51:45] and he would go on to tell us that is a
[1:51:48] witness that the rest of the mountain is
[1:51:53] on its way
[1:51:54] Lord
[1:51:55] there's been many times the Lord
[1:51:58] times and I know we all can testify this
[1:52:02] there's been a grain of sand turn loose
[1:52:04] I didn't see it feel it or hear it
[1:52:10] but how do I know
[1:52:12] because that mountain
[1:52:14] has been moved
[1:52:17] whether it was grain by grain
[1:52:19] one grain then five grains then ten
[1:52:22] grains
[1:52:23] didn't matter
[1:52:25] if thou sayest in thy heart to this
[1:52:28] mountain
[1:52:29] be thou removed
[1:52:33] plucked up and cast in yonder's scene
[1:52:37] if you say in your heart and don't doubt
[1:52:41] oh God I pray tonight
[1:52:45] Lord if there be anything at all
[1:52:48] that would want to hinder
[1:52:51] and give some sort of a place for doubt
[1:52:54] Lord right here in your presence
[1:52:58] we dismiss doubt Lord
[1:53:01] we dismiss the Lord God any hold
[1:53:05] God of any unconfessed sin
[1:53:07] anything that would be hindering the
[1:53:09] Lord to know that you're a God who
[1:53:11] uncovers to bring Liberty Lord
[1:53:14] in our lives granted Lord I pray for
[1:53:18] your children Lord right here Lord this
[1:53:20] evening
[1:53:21] may you strengthen Lord those that are
[1:53:23] weary Lord God
[1:53:25] Lord God may be Lord discouraged
[1:53:29] and they're weary
[1:53:30] weary in their mind and their Spirit
[1:53:33] Lord God
[1:53:34] but I pray that Lord God may you Lord
[1:53:36] God encourage him refresh them Lord let
[1:53:40] them know Lord God there's not a prayer
[1:53:42] Lord God that you haven't heard
[1:53:45] like you told Daniel when you finally
[1:53:48] got through there Daniel your prayer was
[1:53:51] heard the First Time You Prayed
[1:53:54] just because the answer didn't come
[1:53:57] until after 21 days didn't mean that
[1:53:59] your prayer wasn't heard you your prayer
[1:54:03] is the reason that I'm here
[1:54:06] oh God
[1:54:07] sometimes Lord there's a delay
[1:54:11] but that don't mean that you haven't
[1:54:13] heard us
[1:54:15] sometimes Lord you're just trying us
[1:54:18] seeing how we're going to react and
[1:54:21] respond
[1:54:22] during a delay
[1:54:25] Lord God as your children
[1:54:29] We Stand Lord to know that you answer
[1:54:33] and you answer in your own time
[1:54:36] and you answer in your own way
[1:54:39] oh God help us help us tonight Lord help
[1:54:42] us Lord husbands wives fathers mothers
[1:54:45] Lord as fellow Believers Lord help us
