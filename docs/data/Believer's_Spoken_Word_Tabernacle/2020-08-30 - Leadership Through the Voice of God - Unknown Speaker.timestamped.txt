[39:46] just so thankful that brother wayne was
[39:50] able to
[39:51] to come by and i just so appreciate
[39:57] the ministering of the word
[40:04] it's kind of funny one of the first
[40:05] times that brother wayne and i met we
[40:07] didn't even meet get to meet and shake
[40:09] hands he said on the front row and
[40:11] i was ministering but then we got to
[40:15] meet afterwards and well we just kind of
[40:18] hit it off
[40:20] and we just just have just really of um
[40:24] just how he's had some real good
[40:26] fellowship and i just really
[40:28] i i really love brother wayne appreciate
[40:30] his
[40:31] desire his zeal for the lord
[40:34] i think you got him loud enough
[40:38] and uh so we we just we're just so
[40:41] thankful to the lord the word has come
[40:44] to edify us amen come to build us up so
[40:49] um i want to read one verse of scripture
[40:51] here
[40:52] and this is in jeremiah 37 verse 17.
[40:57] i'm going to just read that one first
[40:58] and then let me read a few more verses
[41:00] and i'll let you be seated
[41:03] but i want you to notice this scripture
[41:05] i'm taking this here first
[41:07] this is the very first meeting
[41:10] that zedekiah is going to have with
[41:13] jeremiah
[41:15] zedekiah is the last king before they go
[41:17] into captivity
[41:19] i want you to notice the reading of the
[41:21] words in verse 17
[41:22] then zedekiah the king sent and took
[41:26] him out and the king asked him
[41:30] secretly in his house and said
[41:34] is there any word from the lord
[41:37] i want you to catch this he knows
[41:40] that jeremiah has contact with god
[41:45] he knows that jeremiah is the one
[41:48] whom god has sent to
[41:52] reveal his word to and through him
[42:00] and jeremiah said there is
[42:03] for said he thou shalt be delivered
[42:07] into the hand of the king of babylon
[42:11] now a chapter later in jeremiah 38
[42:14] 17 where we're reading from last week
[42:18] here we come into the second meeting now
[42:20] remember jeremiah's already
[42:23] been cast
[42:27] in prison the dungeon
[42:31] and so even with that part of it you
[42:33] realize there's different
[42:35] places of court of the prison and then
[42:37] the dungeon would be the lost place
[42:39] so now when we take this up in jeremiah
[42:41] 38
[42:42] the uh jeremiah has already been raised
[42:45] up out of the dungeon as we were looking
[42:47] a few weeks ago by
[42:48] vedmalek who is one that the word had
[42:52] found
[42:53] a resting place in his life
[42:56] to recognize not just that jeremiah has
[43:00] the word of the lord but he has an ear
[43:03] to be able to hear and a heart
[43:07] that can give place to that word
[43:10] when abamelec was raising up jeremiah
[43:13] even the approach that he took
[43:15] it was a display
[43:19] of how he was allowing the word
[43:23] to come into his life he was not
[43:26] haphazard
[43:28] but he allowed the word to come into
[43:30] power
[43:31] in his life so now
[43:34] zedekiah sends for jeremiah again
[43:38] thus saith the lord the god of host the
[43:41] god of israel
[43:43] if thou wilt this is something he has to
[43:47] do
[43:47] if thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the
[43:51] king
[43:51] of babylon's princess
[43:54] then thy soul shall live
[43:57] notice what he's talking about he didn't
[44:00] say
[44:00] everything will be peachy
[44:04] just like a picnic for you right
[44:08] we're talking about real life
[44:11] real life is not the uh necessities and
[44:15] things
[44:16] of this life but real life
[44:20] is that of our soul
[44:24] is where our soul becomes into
[44:28] his presence his life this is what he's
[44:31] drilling this is what a word is dealing
[44:33] with
[44:34] then thy soul shall live and this city
[44:37] shall not be burned with fire
[44:40] and thou shalt live and thine
[44:44] house it's a big responsibility
[44:49] this decision is going to affect a lot
[44:52] of people
[44:55] but if thou will not go forth to the
[44:57] king of babylon's princes
[45:00] then this city shall be given into the
[45:03] hands
[45:04] of the chaldeans and they shall burn it
[45:07] with fire
[45:08] and thou shalt not escape out of their
[45:10] hands
[45:12] zedekiah said zedekiah the king said
[45:14] unto jeremiah
[45:16] i am afraid of the jews
[45:19] that are falling to the chaldeans lest
[45:22] they deliver me
[45:24] into their hand and they mock me now
[45:27] who's this about
[45:29] how how is he taking the word you know
[45:33] the bible tells us in the book of isaiah
[45:37] god doesn't cast aside our reasoning
[45:40] but he says come let us reason together
[45:45] brother branham would tell us over and
[45:46] over we see
[45:48] when man rests upon reasoning
[45:52] he's already failed to begin when
[45:55] anything comes against the word you
[45:58] forsake that
[45:59] and take the word yes amen this is why
[46:02] brother branham would tell us
[46:03] in putting on the horm of god and
[46:05] throughout that whole time
[46:06] he would say when your reasoning speaks
[46:09] with the word of god
[46:11] then you move with it because you're not
[46:13] moving by your reasoning
[46:15] you're taking the word of god but if
[46:18] it speaks against the word you denounce
[46:20] that
[46:21] and you take the word
[46:24] you say is that possible for abraham's
[46:27] seed
[46:29] abraham see there's a greater prevailing
[46:33] power within you
[46:39] the seed prevails are you with me
[46:42] yeah one in a million the seed prevails
[46:46] all those all of those germs that come
[46:48] through there
[46:49] brother graham said i watched them when
[46:50] they took me to that cattle ranch and
[46:52] seeing
[46:53] all of that all of those germs going
[46:55] through there he said but the one that
[46:57] was able
[46:58] it crawled and it moved its way above
[47:00] all the rest of them
[47:01] and it fertilized that egg right
[47:06] verse 20 but jeremiah said
[47:12] they shall not deliver thee
[47:17] obey i beseech thee the voice of the
[47:20] lord
[47:21] which i speak unto thee so it shall be
[47:24] well
[47:25] unto thee and thy soul
[47:30] shall live what a promise
[47:34] amen god bless you bless the reading of
[47:36] the word
[47:39] i want to
[47:43] just take a thought and just looking to
[47:45] the lord of how he'll just
[47:49] direct us here this morning on
[47:52] leadership
[47:53] through the voice of god
[47:57] you know
[48:00] there's things that when god will ask of
[48:04] us
[48:06] sometimes it can seem so great
[48:11] and if you recall even in the time of
[48:15] israel what led up to this
[48:17] situation it wasn't that they weren't
[48:21] uh coming at the new moons at the
[48:24] sabbaths and not the feast days
[48:27] it wasn't that they weren't offering up
[48:29] lambs and
[48:31] everything and going through all their
[48:33] festivals
[48:34] all the feasts of the lord they were
[48:39] but it was something that was lacking
[48:43] in their life to where god
[48:46] seen it the way that they were
[48:50] offering and going about those things
[48:53] was a real lack of sincerity now
[48:56] please let me just speak here for a
[48:58] moment sincerity itself
[49:01] is not just a piousness of your
[49:04] body
[49:07] people remember
[49:10] brother brahman said many people they
[49:12] can they'll offer up
[49:14] you know this religion will tell them
[49:16] something and they'll sincerely approach
[49:19] that
[49:20] and he said they can be sincerely wrong
[49:24] yet god sent god's sincerity that god
[49:28] requires is
[49:31] is a humbleness of heart
[49:34] to his will
[49:37] and obedience this is what this is where
[49:40] the lord spoke to
[49:42] to to saul obedience is better
[49:45] than sacrifice if jeremiah would have
[49:48] told
[49:49] hezekiah because remember what zedekiah
[49:52] what zedekiah is hearing
[49:54] is not something new he's not
[49:57] hearing something different but yet
[50:01] there's a there's a desire to want to
[50:04] hear
[50:04] something different but judgment this is
[50:07] not the first time where judgment has
[50:10] been spoken
[50:11] god already spoke judgment is coming
[50:14] wrath is coming but zedekiah if
[50:18] if jeremiah would have said to him oh
[50:20] zedekiah this is the word of the lord
[50:23] go and get a thousand rams and
[50:26] go get lambs and offer all them up
[50:30] i think we could agree zedekiah would
[50:33] have known
[50:34] not only had that in store but he would
[50:36] have sent
[50:37] and did that readily but you see it was
[50:40] something deeper
[50:41] than the sacrifices of all those other
[50:44] animals they were
[50:45] sacrificing other animals but they
[50:48] weren't
[50:48] sacrificing their own will
[50:52] and that's what god had a problem with
[50:55] they weren't sacrificing their own will
[50:58] and their own
[50:59] life and this is where god was speaking
[51:02] through his word
[51:03] to try to lead zedekiah in the way of
[51:06] life
[51:07] that this sacrifice that i'm calling you
[51:10] to
[51:10] is a sacrifice of your own life
[51:14] and your own will
[51:17] now the scripture goes on if we can
[51:20] continue to read here
[51:22] you see there's a choice that's got to
[51:24] be made in verse 21
[51:27] if thou refuse to go forth
[51:32] i want you to catch this it wasn't
[51:34] enough for zedekiah
[51:35] in his just to sit there and say well i
[51:38] agree with it
[51:41] the agreements must come to an action
[51:47] faith without works is dead
[51:51] it must come to an action to an
[51:53] expression
[51:55] through that life of what god has said
[51:58] and
[51:58] the only way that can happen that has to
[52:00] be supernatural and let me just
[52:03] preach here just for a moment when i say
[52:05] that it has to be supernaturally
[52:07] it isn't just something way out there
[52:09] but it's the
[52:10] impulse of the holy spirit that's
[52:13] speaking to your heart personally
[52:15] he is there ministering courage right
[52:18] there
[52:19] if you can only yield to that he will
[52:22] break
[52:22] a spirit that is hanging over you
[52:25] that tries to hold you back from
[52:28] surrender
[52:29] that's what brother bram said kept me
[52:30] back from giving my life to the lord
[52:33] there was a spirit that hung over me let
[52:35] me just tell you friends
[52:37] it's not personalities it's not well
[52:39] this is this person's temperament
[52:41] it's this person's personality we've got
[52:43] all of that
[52:44] but i'm going to tell you personality it
[52:46] will not overcome
[52:47] personality it takes a greater one
[52:51] to break that spirit to dispose of him
[52:54] and let him know where you can stand and
[52:57] say i deny your lies satan and i
[53:00] accept what god is speaking to me
[53:03] when you stand on the word listen to me
[53:06] you know what i'm talking about
[53:07] when you stand on the word you will
[53:09] experience
[53:10] a surge of the holy spirit moving
[53:14] down in your life when you take a stand
[53:16] upon that word
[53:18] what is it it's a real courage that
[53:20] comes with that word
[53:22] because this word has life it has
[53:25] power within it
[53:28] if you refuse to go forth this is the
[53:32] word
[53:33] that the lord hath showed me
[53:36] this is what god has showed him verse
[53:40] 22.
[53:42] behold all the women
[53:47] that are left in the king of judah's
[53:49] house
[53:50] shall be brought forth to the king of
[53:52] babylon's princes
[53:54] and those women shall say
[53:57] thy friends have set they on
[54:01] that means they've enticed you allured
[54:04] you
[54:05] through temptation let me tell you
[54:08] something
[54:09] remember the gates of temptation lust of
[54:12] the eyes
[54:14] lust of the flesh and the pride of life
[54:21] thy friends who is he worried about
[54:24] not about the chaldeans he's worried
[54:27] about the jews that are already there
[54:33] thy feet notice what will happen thy
[54:35] friends have set thee on
[54:36] and have prevailed against thee thy feet
[54:39] are sunk in the
[54:40] mire and they are turned away
[54:44] back so they shall bring out all thy
[54:47] wives
[54:48] and thy children to the chaldeans
[54:52] god's letting him know either you lead
[54:54] your home
[54:56] either you take authority and let the
[54:58] word lead you and you lead your home
[55:01] or god says i let everything will be
[55:03] taken captive are you with me
[55:08] and thou shalt not escape out of their
[55:10] hand but thou
[55:12] shalt be taken by the hand of the king
[55:14] of babylon
[55:16] and thou shalt cause this city to be
[55:18] burned with fire
[55:20] this is a big responsibility
[55:24] and decisions themselves i think as we
[55:27] have perhaps of my mind serves
[55:31] correctly and i think about it we uh
[55:35] decisions themselves the older you get
[55:38] they don't become
[55:39] lighter
[55:43] amen sometimes there's decisions we make
[55:45] just to say
[55:46] uh i'm not going to go check on this
[55:50] i'm having this pain or i'm having this
[55:52] ah i'm not going to go check on it
[55:54] i'm not going to go this and i'm not
[55:55] going to do that or i'm not going to do
[55:57] this or sometimes decision we make
[56:01] yeah we don't need to call a plumber
[56:03] right now or this or that
[56:05] and the decisions we make eventually
[56:07] they lead to a catastrophe
[56:10] they can lead to a a bigger thing we
[56:13] understand
[56:13] we understand the impact of decisions
[56:17] their decisions themselves are things
[56:20] that
[56:21] the word always sets before us a choice
[56:24] and i believe with all my heart that the
[56:26] as we draw closer and closer
[56:30] to the finish line we begin to recognize
[56:33] that every decision that we're making we
[56:35] just don't look at things
[56:36] in terms of saying well oh this is
[56:38] natural i can make this decision
[56:40] it ain't going to very matter no no i
[56:42] believe as we're getting closer to
[56:44] the finish line you start looking at
[56:45] decisions that you make and say
[56:47] though there may seem to be no sin
[56:50] nothing in this
[56:51] but if i go this direction or if i take
[56:54] this up or if i go on this measure
[56:56] how's that going to affect my walk
[56:58] spiritually
[56:59] you begin to think and you realize
[57:01] what's what what is causing that
[57:04] it's not that you're such a great
[57:06] individual it's because the word
[57:08] is gaining preeminence in your life and
[57:12] the word
[57:13] is bringing before you the clarity of
[57:15] the mark
[57:16] that you're pressing toward and
[57:18] everything else that is about your life
[57:21] that could seemingly be a priority it
[57:24] begins to fade away it's not saying that
[57:27] you get rid of everything in your life
[57:29] like well you know i
[57:31] i don't go hunting anymore i don't do
[57:33] this anymore
[57:34] or i don't mess around with wood anymore
[57:36] that's not what it's saying
[57:37] it's saying what it comes down to is is
[57:39] that the word itself has such
[57:42] preeminence in your life that you
[57:44] recognize
[57:45] that anything that will take away or
[57:48] hinder that
[57:48] i don't want that about my life
[57:53] it's the value of his presence the value
[57:57] of his word in your life
[58:01] so his decision was not just about him
[58:05] paul even told timothy you hear the
[58:07] words
[58:08] take take heed to the words i'm i'm i'm
[58:12] speaking to you because not only will
[58:14] you save yourself
[58:16] but you'll save others who hear thee
[58:19] because the words that paul had were the
[58:21] words of eternal life
[58:26] i notice zedekiah's response in verse 24
[58:31] then said zedekiah unto jeremiah
[58:35] let no man know of these words
[58:39] and thou shalt not die
[58:44] few verses on down in verse 28
[58:48] so jeremiah ebold in the court
[58:51] of the prison until the day that
[58:54] jerusalem was taken
[58:56] and he was there when jerusalem was
[58:58] taken
[59:02] his response
[59:06] to the word
[59:09] it's known by his actions
[59:13] instead of saying you know the word that
[59:17] god has spoke to you
[59:18] jeremiah this word is of such value
[59:21] and to listen to me it's not uh
[59:25] the worship of of of the prophet or the
[59:28] man's person
[59:29] but it's to recognize that is god's
[59:32] mouthpiece and to reference
[59:36] that word that god is speaking
[59:39] through that mouthpiece that that is the
[59:42] word of the lord
[59:47] it's not to be esteem lightly it's not
[59:49] to be well you know
[59:51] well you know this is just brother
[59:52] brown's thinking or there this right
[59:54] here
[59:54] let me just tell you there are things in
[59:56] there that we can look at and say well
[59:58] you know that was brother brown and he
[1:00:00] would say this is my thinking or
[1:00:01] whatever but let me just be very clearly
[1:00:03] i will take his thinking
[1:00:06] i will take that over top of any other
[1:00:09] man's thinking
[1:00:17] because the thing that he should have
[1:00:19] done is is jeremiah
[1:00:21] you're not going back to the court of
[1:00:22] prison no way
[1:00:24] but he prepare a place and say jeremiah
[1:00:27] you you come and you rest over here but
[1:00:30] instead
[1:00:31] he he came he wanted to hear what's the
[1:00:34] word of the lord
[1:00:35] has god changed his mind at all and then
[1:00:37] the word comes
[1:00:38] lets him know all you have to walk in is
[1:00:41] simple
[1:00:42] obedience and instead of that he says
[1:00:45] don't you say these words
[1:00:46] to nobody else and he puts him back in
[1:00:49] the court of the prison let me just tell
[1:00:50] you something right now
[1:00:52] we can come and sit right here god can
[1:00:55] come down and he comes down
[1:00:57] by his presence and by his spirit and it
[1:01:00] can be such a time of
[1:01:01] oh my goodness i felt so wonderful i
[1:01:04] felt so good
[1:01:05] just stay with me now but yet if we
[1:01:07] leave
[1:01:08] out of here and hear the word goes back
[1:01:11] to the court of prison in our life he's
[1:01:14] not allowed to come in
[1:01:15] in preeminence we've done no different
[1:01:18] than what zedekiah did
[1:01:20] don't allow the word to just say you
[1:01:22] can't come any further
[1:01:24] you can stand on the door but don't go
[1:01:26] meddling in my life
[1:01:30] but the word has come to change our life
[1:01:33] and the real reality to a believer
[1:01:36] there's sure
[1:01:37] there's a reality about it that our will
[1:01:40] and everything else but there is a
[1:01:42] greater
[1:01:43] there's a greater reality of a seed on
[1:01:45] the inside let me say this
[1:01:47] whether that seed has come to birth or
[1:01:50] not
[1:01:50] there is a prevailing power there that's
[1:01:53] in that seed
[1:01:54] that no matter what the enemy will try
[1:01:56] to do he can't get it out of god's sight
[1:01:59] he can't take it out of god's memory he
[1:02:02] can't cloud it up
[1:02:03] with all sin and doubt and unbelief he
[1:02:06] can't get it to a place to where god
[1:02:08] forgets about it
[1:02:09] god knows where his seed is and the
[1:02:12] quickening power
[1:02:13] moves over that sea it draws your life
[1:02:17] you may not even be sitting in church
[1:02:20] israel was scattered throughout the
[1:02:21] world
[1:02:22] but the trumpet sounded supernaturally
[1:02:26] to bring them back home and brother the
[1:02:29] holy ghost
[1:02:30] is a living voice it is the word of god
[1:02:33] that is sounding out
[1:02:35] to gather his children back home
[1:02:39] amen we can take no credit we can take
[1:02:43] no glory
[1:02:45] it's him
[1:02:53] this condition that was in
[1:02:57] judah and in israel they were they were
[1:03:00] divided
[1:03:01] they were a divided people
[1:03:07] there was a need for leadership yes amen
[1:03:12] there was a need for leadership he had
[1:03:15] zedekiah
[1:03:17] and all zero kind cared about was
[1:03:20] himself
[1:03:23] right but god's gonna hold him
[1:03:28] responsible
[1:03:31] he's got more to look after
[1:03:34] than just himself
[1:03:38] he's got his household to look after
[1:03:44] can i preach a little bit
[1:03:47] to daddies to husbands your wife wants
[1:03:50] somebody who
[1:03:51] lead in the home leadership
[1:03:55] is not being dismissive of your
[1:03:58] responsibilities
[1:04:01] it's you taking the role and leading in
[1:04:05] that home
[1:04:08] well she's more spiritual than i am
[1:04:11] that's error
[1:04:14] you already need to ask god for a
[1:04:16] deliverance from a complex in your life
[1:04:21] god by his word if god allows that to be
[1:04:25] and in your life that god is
[1:04:27] overstepping his own word
[1:04:30] i understand sometimes in situations
[1:04:32] maybe there's one
[1:04:33] who's serving the lord and their spouse
[1:04:35] is not serving the lord
[1:04:37] but to bring it down very with such
[1:04:39] clarity here
[1:04:40] that leadership itself there is a
[1:04:43] craving
[1:04:44] for leadership
[1:04:48] and the husband says well you know you
[1:04:50] know mama you take care of discipline
[1:04:54] you take care of discipline shame on you
[1:04:58] you're the one that's supposed to be
[1:05:00] leading in that
[1:05:03] you're the one that's supposed to be
[1:05:04] direction and administering the rod of
[1:05:07] correction
[1:05:09] you're with me now you see on these
[1:05:12] thesis of leadership there was a cry
[1:05:15] for leadership look at what his his
[1:05:17] whole party is is that
[1:05:18] oh my if you know if i don't wonder
[1:05:21] what's going to happen the jews they're
[1:05:22] going to deliver to the jews they're
[1:05:23] going to mock me
[1:05:24] and here the word of the lord speaks
[1:05:27] that this
[1:05:28] is what's going to happen your family
[1:05:30] your household
[1:05:31] all is going to be carried away he's he
[1:05:34] is focused on the wrong thing
[1:05:39] same thing when a daddy gets focused on
[1:05:42] i don't want to hurt their feelings
[1:05:43] i want to make sure they love me i want
[1:05:46] you know that sometimes will cause the
[1:05:48] biggest compromises
[1:05:51] because they want them to love them
[1:05:52] that's a selfish love
[1:05:55] your children and everybody will love
[1:05:58] you if you stand there
[1:05:59] and you'll hold them accountable and
[1:06:01] tell them the truth
[1:06:02] when they're wrong don't put it on
[1:06:06] everybody else
[1:06:07] that it's this fault well if they hadn't
[1:06:09] been so sensitive
[1:06:10] they wouldn't have got on you if they
[1:06:12] hadn't been there you
[1:06:14] need to take your direction and
[1:06:17] responsibility
[1:06:18] as a real man in your home
[1:06:23] there is an example that we see in the
[1:06:26] word
[1:06:26] when the word was delivered to us in
[1:06:28] this day
[1:06:29] it did not come haphazardly when she
[1:06:32] wash it
[1:06:33] that we wonder where we stand it came
[1:06:35] with direction
[1:06:37] to bring correction why we were off the
[1:06:40] mark
[1:06:41] we had to get brought back on the market
[1:06:48] so many times you see that
[1:06:51] it's a result of the spirit
[1:06:54] that started way back there under this
[1:06:56] feminist movement
[1:07:00] and that has come and have prevailed
[1:07:03] because the word has not been held as a
[1:07:06] standard
[1:07:10] are you with me now so daddy you're to
[1:07:13] know what's going on in your home
[1:07:19] sometimes there's sayings as husbands
[1:07:21] boy i'm saying we're just going to go
[1:07:22] with him
[1:07:30] there is a desire and that cry
[1:07:33] for leadership in that life
[1:07:37] for you as a daddy to lead the devotions
[1:07:40] in the home
[1:07:42] for you to stand there and and
[1:07:45] giving direction and leadership and to
[1:07:49] guide your home being the real spiritual
[1:07:52] man in the house being the one who
[1:07:54] stands there it's not
[1:07:56] about what you say it ain't about all
[1:07:57] that you say it's the life you live
[1:08:02] it's your life your testimony your
[1:08:05] direction
[1:08:06] and what they're going give them
[1:08:08] something to follow
[1:08:10] i believe that's go i believe that's the
[1:08:12] desire in our life but i believe many
[1:08:14] times the enemy complicates it
[1:08:16] and god brings it so simple it isn't
[1:08:19] that you've got to be a great scholar
[1:08:21] you've got to be able to put scripture
[1:08:23] together you got to be able to do that a
[1:08:24] little more
[1:08:25] i can tell you right now and many times
[1:08:27] even with teenagers and one of her more
[1:08:29] they don't care about all the scriptures
[1:08:30] you can put together
[1:08:31] and your children everything else don't
[1:08:33] care about all the scriptures you can
[1:08:34] put together
[1:08:35] they want to see a lie
[1:08:38] they want to see a life that they can
[1:08:41] follow
[1:08:43] are you with me we're not it's not
[1:08:46] something where we're
[1:08:47] dependent god is letting jeremiah know
[1:08:50] you've got a responsibility
[1:08:52] you've asked of the word if jeremiah if
[1:08:55] seneca
[1:08:55] will take this word and go right back
[1:08:58] into his home
[1:08:59] it will have an effect on his home
[1:09:06] boy it's quiet
[1:09:11] brother brown will take this many times
[1:09:16] some of these are very familiar quotes
[1:09:19] to us
[1:09:20] brother brian will tell us we see it he
[1:09:23] said a woman can't get out of her place
[1:09:26] until the man first gets out of his amen
[1:09:30] right many times where you see it's not
[1:09:33] listen to
[1:09:34] me even as a pastor it's not going
[1:09:36] around saying sister you shouldn't have
[1:09:37] said this
[1:09:38] sister you shouldn't have done that many
[1:09:39] times that's a key that there's a
[1:09:41] missing
[1:09:42] link of leadership in that home
[1:09:50] when sisters walk around with their
[1:09:52] going about and
[1:09:53] taking their own opinion well don't you
[1:09:54] feel this and i feel the church ought to
[1:09:56] be like this and i don't feel i feel the
[1:09:58] church ought to be like this
[1:09:59] if that's going on i don't know but god
[1:10:01] is speaking
[1:10:03] the bible says the women is to learn in
[1:10:06] silence
[1:10:08] and to be subjection to their own
[1:10:10] husbands
[1:10:11] if they are to learn anything let them
[1:10:13] ask their husbands at home
[1:10:15] you know what that speaks there ought to
[1:10:16] be leadership at the home
[1:10:18] that if there are questions not that
[1:10:21] that man has all the answers
[1:10:22] but that he is in contact with the
[1:10:25] source of
[1:10:26] every answer
[1:10:38] listen friends the word is not against
[1:10:40] you
[1:10:42] it comes to help you there's a there is
[1:10:45] a
[1:10:45] cry that goes out for leadership
[1:10:49] and this is what god was responding to
[1:10:52] to to the cry for leadership there was a
[1:10:55] condition that was present there
[1:10:58] and there is an appointed channel let me
[1:11:02] just
[1:11:02] move here just just try to pick up the
[1:11:05] pace
[1:11:05] there is there is a channel god has
[1:11:09] channels of leadership yes
[1:11:13] and when we we see that here the lord
[1:11:16] jesus
[1:11:17] he's asked a question and in john 6
[1:11:21] 28 and they said unto him what shall we
[1:11:25] do
[1:11:26] that we might work the works of
[1:11:29] god you see they're seeing
[1:11:33] they're they're they're seeing things
[1:11:35] take place
[1:11:37] and they're and they're asking him what
[1:11:39] should we do that we could work the
[1:11:40] works of god
[1:11:41] look at the simplicity of it jesus
[1:11:44] answered and said unto them
[1:11:46] this is the work of god
[1:11:49] that you believe on him whom he
[1:11:52] hath sent amen that's the work of god
[1:11:57] now brother brown picks this up in
[1:11:59] spirit spoken spoken word
[1:12:01] his original seed and he's bringing it
[1:12:03] down through the scripture here
[1:12:06] that of moses that of samuel and he goes
[1:12:08] in here in paragraph 378 he says
[1:12:11] this is a law of god god's law
[1:12:14] is to receive a vindicated
[1:12:17] servant remember jesus told him he said
[1:12:21] um you know he said you you'll receive
[1:12:26] one who comes in his own name but you
[1:12:28] will reject
[1:12:29] him who comes in his father's name
[1:12:32] the father's name is his life his
[1:12:35] character his nature made manifest
[1:12:39] not just words but it's a life
[1:12:42] that is made manifest a real prophet of
[1:12:46] god
[1:12:46] he's one with that message that
[1:12:50] message is being lived out in his life
[1:12:53] the character
[1:12:54] the nature of god is on display
[1:12:58] amen hallelujah let me just be very
[1:13:02] careful let me just be very honest with
[1:13:03] you
[1:13:06] you take away the lord jesus christ
[1:13:10] and remove that from brother branham's
[1:13:14] life
[1:13:16] there wouldn't be a going on
[1:13:22] you recognize these were not and i know
[1:13:24] it's been seemed very elementary
[1:13:26] these are not the thoughts of william
[1:13:28] branham
[1:13:29] amen was a servant just like
[1:13:33] this microphone that brother wayne used
[1:13:35] the other night it can't speak
[1:13:38] that's right you can sit here all you
[1:13:40] want and say
[1:13:41] brother wayne talk to me brother wayne
[1:13:43] say something brother wayne said brother
[1:13:45] wayne
[1:13:45] this is not brother wayne
[1:13:48] but this is an instrument that brother
[1:13:51] wayne used
[1:13:52] amen and that's why god
[1:13:56] moves he uses instruments
[1:13:59] that are surrendered to him
[1:14:07] that's god's law he says in john 13
[1:14:11] 20 verily verily i say unto you
[1:14:14] he that receives whosoever i sinned
[1:14:17] receives me
[1:14:18] and he that receives me receives him
[1:14:21] that
[1:14:22] sent me oh he sent a vindicated servant
[1:14:25] he said
[1:14:26] it's a law of god to receive it and it
[1:14:29] goes on
[1:14:30] and i'm just just bear with me i'm just
[1:14:32] going to read this
[1:14:34] he said which one of you can condemn me
[1:14:36] of sin let me show you god's word
[1:14:38] see if you believe it see if god
[1:14:40] vindicates it in
[1:14:42] you and let me speak of myself if i
[1:14:44] speak of myself
[1:14:45] i'm a liar but if i speak of god and god
[1:14:48] speaks through me
[1:14:49] by his word then it's the truth then
[1:14:52] who believes the word of god near you
[1:14:58] now notice he says jesus said he that
[1:15:02] receives them that i
[1:15:03] send receives me
[1:15:06] them that he sent and them that receives
[1:15:09] me receives him
[1:15:10] that sent me he says you can only serve
[1:15:13] god
[1:15:14] as you believe the servants that god
[1:15:18] sins
[1:15:22] amen the citizen a mcdonald's menu
[1:15:27] amen there's things on the mcdonald's
[1:15:30] menu
[1:15:33] that i might prefer how do we get to
[1:15:36] mcdonald's
[1:15:40] you know how it is when you ask your
[1:15:42] wife what's for dinner and she says
[1:15:43] anything
[1:15:46] then there's other times you're like hey
[1:15:48] all right
[1:15:50] there's things that you prefer but it's
[1:15:54] all food
[1:15:56] but don't let your preferences keep you
[1:16:00] from eating amen
[1:16:03] that's what paul dealt with in the
[1:16:05] corinthian church
[1:16:06] they allowed their carnality to rise
[1:16:09] in preferences instead of recognizing
[1:16:12] it's god
[1:16:13] who does the planting it's god who does
[1:16:16] the watering it's god who brings the
[1:16:19] increase
[1:16:20] it's to be it is such a blessing to be
[1:16:22] able to recognize
[1:16:24] that it's him
[1:16:28] is that right so you believe the
[1:16:32] servants that god sends
[1:16:33] you can only serve god on earth as god's
[1:16:36] servants
[1:16:37] that sent on earth by
[1:16:40] divine inspiration interprets the word
[1:16:43] to you
[1:16:44] paul here in two places in the scripture
[1:16:46] first corinthians 14
[1:16:48] and also 11 1 you follow me as i follow
[1:16:51] christ
[1:16:53] you can say paul i don't need you i'm
[1:16:55] going to follow christ
[1:16:57] you can't you can't
[1:17:01] you can't you do away you do away with
[1:17:03] paul
[1:17:04] try to do away with john the baptist
[1:17:08] you can't these are connections
[1:17:12] to the throne it's not the man but it's
[1:17:17] the word
[1:17:18] that comes forth to prepare an entrance
[1:17:25] amen they're lives that are longing to
[1:17:29] serve god
[1:17:31] luke 10 16 he that heareth you heareth
[1:17:34] me he that despiseth you who despises me
[1:17:36] he that despises me despises him that
[1:17:39] set me
[1:17:40] god speaks his message through his
[1:17:43] servants
[1:17:46] now you know paul uh he
[1:17:49] we we many times we quote hebrews 13
[1:17:53] 8 if you go there hebrews 13 8 jesus
[1:17:56] christ the same
[1:17:58] yesterday and today and forever it's him
[1:18:01] all right hallelujah when it all comes
[1:18:03] down to it
[1:18:04] it's him amen within a service when it
[1:18:08] all comes down to it
[1:18:09] it's him amen he's the this is the
[1:18:12] objective
[1:18:13] is that he is the one that we see
[1:18:16] that we look in the word we see him
[1:18:19] we see where our lack is and we see the
[1:18:22] grace that has come
[1:18:23] to catch us from where we are to where
[1:18:26] we ought to be
[1:18:27] that's the power of a word that god
[1:18:30] has revealed there's a quickening power
[1:18:34] behind this word amen but the word the
[1:18:37] verse right above it
[1:18:39] goes in conjunction with it remember
[1:18:42] them
[1:18:43] which have the rule over you that rule
[1:18:46] is not the rulership of man over man
[1:18:51] god has appointed by gifts his servants
[1:18:55] not men of elevation servants what are
[1:18:58] they to do
[1:18:59] serve his will serve his people
[1:19:03] serving things that goes against their
[1:19:06] own
[1:19:06] wow a will their own wants too it's not
[1:19:10] about them
[1:19:11] it's about them serving god's will
[1:19:15] they're not perfect neither are you
[1:19:18] perfect
[1:19:19] but you see how god will chose
[1:19:23] to confound the wise then god will take
[1:19:26] fallible men and he will reveal
[1:19:30] himself to be the infallible god
[1:19:33] where he will take more than just your
[1:19:35] eyes
[1:19:36] and ears to see and hear it will take
[1:19:40] a spiritual endowment of the holy spirit
[1:19:43] to recognize that it's not the word of
[1:19:46] brother branham
[1:19:47] it's not the word of samuel browning or
[1:19:49] dwayne lawson or on and on
[1:19:51] but this is the word of god and so your
[1:19:54] confidence
[1:19:55] is not in the fallibility of that man
[1:19:59] but it's in the infallible god of an
[1:20:02] incalible letter
[1:20:03] that cannot fail
[1:20:06] [Applause]
[1:20:07] that's what we're under amen
[1:20:12] remember them who have the rule over you
[1:20:18] have spoken unto you this is what this
[1:20:20] is the true rule
[1:20:21] the word amen amen
[1:20:25] if it's a man we're still lost
[1:20:30] if it's a man we're in trouble
[1:20:36] but simon what kind of kind of car

[1:21:25] greater sensitivity

[1:21:54] congregation

[1:22:35] is that right under the authority of
[1:22:38] that
[1:22:39] revelation we rise in new heights
[1:22:43] now notice this is here even before
[1:22:46] zedekiah
[1:22:47] in jeremiah 29 2019 because they have
[1:22:52] not hearkened to my word saith the lord
[1:22:55] which i sent unto them by my servants
[1:22:58] the prophets
[1:22:59] these were not words that were sent to
[1:23:01] another nation
[1:23:02] it was sent personally
[1:23:06] notice rising up early and sending them
[1:23:09] you'll find that many times in the
[1:23:10] scripture
[1:23:10] rising up early rising up early god made
[1:23:14] it
[1:23:14] a priority
[1:23:17] it was set first to send his word
[1:23:21] to his people you see leadership itself
[1:23:28] it comes there's a vision
[1:23:32] it's a reality it's a faith
[1:23:38] the bible talks about with abraham the
[1:23:41] word of the lord
[1:23:42] came to him by vision you know when god
[1:23:46] spoke to abraham
[1:23:48] come away from your kindred come into a
[1:23:51] land i'll show you
[1:23:52] how blessed thee so forth he
[1:23:56] had to obey the voice of god
[1:24:00] when i say had to it wasn't somebody
[1:24:02] there pressuring him
[1:24:04] but it became greater than
[1:24:07] every other pool
[1:24:11] and he was willing to set aside
[1:24:13] everything to move
[1:24:15] into that channel amen it's the same
[1:24:18] thing that with
[1:24:19] when samuel samuel when samuel
[1:24:23] is here there is an open vision that is
[1:24:27] given
[1:24:27] of the word there becomes an opening
[1:24:30] within that word for the children of
[1:24:33] israel
[1:24:34] that's the mercy of god
[1:24:38] you see this is where god would express
[1:24:42] and i don't have time to read this but
[1:24:44] when god would speak even to
[1:24:49] with israel and how that he would guide
[1:24:51] them and he would lead them
[1:24:53] david would pick it up in the psalms
[1:24:56] and he would speak their
[1:25:00] the spirit of christ speaking to him
[1:25:02] that i
[1:25:03] i will guide thee i will
[1:25:06] instruct thee i will teach thee
[1:25:09] in the way i will guide me with my own
[1:25:12] eye
[1:25:13] and and the spirit of christ is letting
[1:25:15] it be known uh to that
[1:25:17] to you and i don't be like the horse or
[1:25:20] the mule
[1:25:20] that's got to have bits in their mouth
[1:25:22] and they've got to be turned
[1:25:24] here and there don't be like those who
[1:25:26] have no understanding
[1:25:27] what's he saying let the word the eye of
[1:25:30] god
[1:25:31] let the holy spirit be the guide of your
[1:25:34] life
[1:25:35] follow him for what he's trying to lead
[1:25:38] you into
[1:25:40] he doesn't lead you into bondage you're
[1:25:42] in bondage
[1:25:43] you need to be led into liberty
[1:25:48] amen and then the more as we're yielded
[1:25:51] to him
[1:25:52] that understanding there is liberty that
[1:25:55] is given
[1:25:56] by that of the spirit of god within the
[1:25:59] soul of the believer
[1:26:00] and it just keeps on working in our life
[1:26:03] a loosening
[1:26:04] and a loosening and a loosening
[1:26:10] that's why the scriptures would say it
[1:26:13] didn't say whoever could be
[1:26:15] pushed by the spirit of god right those
[1:26:18] that are pulled by the spirit of god
[1:26:20] said those that are left
[1:26:24] you see it's one thing for the spirit of
[1:26:27] god to say
[1:26:28] this but it's another thing
[1:26:32] for our heart to say yes lord that's
[1:26:36] leadership amen i'm saying like this
[1:26:39] that's receiving leadership
[1:26:42] he can say it but we must have a heart
[1:26:45] that says
[1:26:46] yes lord i side with that of the word
[1:26:50] we know how this is in our own life
[1:26:52] there are things
[1:26:53] that sometimes we can become enslared in
[1:26:57] our own feelings complexes can develop
[1:27:02] hard feelings or resentments or other
[1:27:04] things and we can become ensnared in
[1:27:06] that
[1:27:07] but when the word comes forth don't draw
[1:27:10] back right but say yes
[1:27:13] lord amen side with the word
[1:27:16] and when you side with the word and say
[1:27:19] yes
[1:27:20] lord don't even entertain a thought of
[1:27:23] how's this going to be or how's this
[1:27:25] going to happen if the word
[1:27:27] is speaking to you stand upon that word
[1:27:31] and say be it unto me lord according to
[1:27:34] thy word
[1:27:35] for jesus said my sheep they know my
[1:27:37] voice
[1:27:42] this is why even when you you know you
[1:27:44] can sinner
[1:27:46] uh brother branham would use the the
[1:27:49] example
[1:27:51] of the pool of bethesda they were all
[1:27:53] gathered around that pool of bethesda
[1:27:57] many were healed right there have been
[1:28:01] many
[1:28:01] that had come in the water when the
[1:28:03] angel had come down
[1:28:06] in a certain season right is that right
[1:28:09] soon as soon as that one stepped in the
[1:28:11] water there was no such thing as waves
[1:28:13] keep on going
[1:28:15] it ceased it was supernatural
[1:28:19] but they were sitting there gathered in
[1:28:21] that place because they knew
[1:28:23] there was a visitation
[1:28:28] had confidence in that right
[1:28:32] this is why brother brown would say the
[1:28:34] water
[1:28:35] could not say look at me look who i am
[1:28:39] it wasn't the water it was their
[1:28:42] faith in the angel
[1:28:46] stirring the water
[1:28:50] the faith in god's word and it brought
[1:28:52] deliverance in their life
[1:28:56] that's why brother brown when he makes
[1:28:58] that statement and this is in
[1:28:59] conjunction with this
[1:29:01] when he stands there and he says let me
[1:29:04] just let me just read it like this he
[1:29:06] says
[1:29:06] i'm just your brother by the grace of
[1:29:08] god but when the angel of the lord moves
[1:29:11] down
[1:29:12] it becomes then a voice of god to you
[1:29:17] he said if i offended you by saying that
[1:29:20] forgive me
[1:29:21] but i felt that might have been resented
[1:29:23] but i am god's voice
[1:29:24] to you and i'll say it again that time
[1:29:27] was under inspiration
[1:29:29] i felt bad about it the first time but
[1:29:31] it
[1:29:32] repeated it
[1:29:36] you see just a pool of water but when
[1:29:39] the angel of the lord came down
[1:29:41] it became more than a pool of water it
[1:29:43] became a place
[1:29:44] of deliverance
[1:29:48] when he comes that's what makes the
[1:29:50] difference when he comes in your house
[1:29:53] that makes a difference when he comes in
[1:29:55] your life
[1:29:56] that's what makes the difference
[1:29:58] [Music]
[1:29:58] [Applause]
[1:30:02] the impotent man who was laying there he
[1:30:05] didn't have
[1:30:06] nobody to help him
[1:30:08] [Music]
[1:30:10] is that what he said who do i have to
[1:30:12] help me
[1:30:13] i need somebody to help me and carry me
[1:30:14] down there i can't get there
[1:30:18] why are you still here because i know
[1:30:19] god's moving
[1:30:22] amen
[1:30:26] he needed help for somebody to carry him
[1:30:30] to where he needed to be
[1:30:35] the god who sent the angels
[1:30:40] angel after angel age after age
[1:30:44] are you with me that same god came down
[1:30:48] and where that man could sit there and
[1:30:50] there was no doubt
[1:30:51] there were things that were piling up
[1:30:54] about his life
[1:30:55] of you've tried before you've been
[1:30:56] sitting here before
[1:30:58] but you never got anywhere but his faith
[1:31:00] was
[1:31:01] not in himself he knew i'm here this is
[1:31:04] where god is moving
[1:31:06] and he stayed there brother his faith
[1:31:09] in that it invited the god of glory
[1:31:12] when he could not get to the water he
[1:31:15] couldn't move himself
[1:31:17] but the god of glory came down to where
[1:31:20] he was
[1:31:21] [Music]
[1:31:25] hallelujah amen that's the reality of
[1:31:28] the word
[1:31:29] coming to our pathway to our life
[1:31:32] it's not us with the ability to get to
[1:31:35] god
[1:31:35] it's god getting to us behold i stand at
[1:31:39] the door
[1:31:40] and knock
[1:31:51] here in the scripture
[1:31:56] i'll go back to the first part of
[1:31:58] jeremiah 38.
[1:32:08] i'm not going to pronounce all those try
[1:32:09] to pronounce all those names in verse 1.
[1:32:11] we would be here a month or sundays
[1:32:15] but the words that jeremiah had spoken
[1:32:18] unto all the people saying
[1:32:20] this is what the word that was spoken
[1:32:23] thus saith the lord he that remaineth
[1:32:28] in this city shall die by the sword
[1:32:32] by the famine and by the pestilence
[1:32:36] but he that goeth forth to the chaldeans
[1:32:38] shall live
[1:32:40] for he shall have his life for a prey
[1:32:43] and shall live his life it shall be a
[1:32:45] reward jesus said
[1:32:47] if you keep your life you lose it but if
[1:32:49] you're willing to lose your life
[1:32:51] you you keep your life is that right
[1:32:55] you receive life this is why listen the
[1:32:58] word
[1:32:59] when the word of leadership listen
[1:33:03] praise the lord leadership by the word
[1:33:10] does not leave you in your
[1:33:14] same condition
[1:33:17] leadership by the word it shows
[1:33:20] us where we are where we need to be
[1:33:26] it has a clarity this is where we are
[1:33:29] this is where we need to be so
[1:33:32] leadership by the word
[1:33:34] is not an emotion it's not a feeling
[1:33:38] are you with me this is why
[1:33:42] as the word came in this hour it came to
[1:33:45] bring such
[1:33:46] a stability in our life the world has
[1:33:50] rejected it because the world for many
[1:33:53] of them
[1:33:53] they go to church and all they have is a
[1:33:56] great emotional
[1:33:57] time but they don't
[1:34:01] live in the word
[1:34:04] that's not leadership
[1:34:08] that's called being pinned up for
[1:34:10] slaughter
[1:34:12] are you with me leadership
[1:34:15] is there to lead us to direct us
[1:34:19] to guide us
[1:34:23] hey i believe in emotion
[1:34:26] you understand we i just say it like
[1:34:29] this
[1:34:30] we're balanced i'm not you understand
[1:34:32] exactly where i stand on that
[1:34:34] there's people that's when completely
[1:34:35] off to another direct that's not even my
[1:34:37] focus
[1:34:38] if they want to go that route there's
[1:34:40] plenty that in the scriptures
[1:34:41] even that brother wayne was saying
[1:34:43] standing here and quoting that scripture
[1:34:44] on thursday night
[1:34:45] if they hold that peace the rocks will
[1:34:48] cry out
[1:34:52] it's speaking of the god that would even
[1:34:55] make you
[1:34:56] stand and worship let it be that god
[1:35:00] that stands in the depth of your life
[1:35:03] when all
[1:35:03] hell is breaking loose against you
[1:35:06] you've got one on the inside
[1:35:08] that same one that descended in
[1:35:10] revelations 10
[1:35:12] and stood with his hands up that same
[1:35:15] god is standing inside of your life
[1:35:22] hallelujah that same god who took the
[1:35:25] seventh star
[1:35:27] of this age and he revealed himself
[1:35:30] through this message through this
[1:35:33] prophet
[1:35:34] it took a life that was surrendered to
[1:35:36] god
[1:35:37] that the word might stand and be raised
[1:35:40] in power amen
[1:35:44] that word raised in power says we don't
[1:35:47] need church programs
[1:35:51] preach amen
[1:35:56] hallelujah five ways to overcome drugs
[1:36:00] three ways there's one way one truth
[1:36:05] one life
[1:36:08] you don't rehabilitate demons
[1:36:12] they're meant to be cast out
[1:36:17] god never made you as the daughter of
[1:36:19] god or a son of god
[1:36:21] to live with devils
[1:36:24] your life was meant to be an inhabitant
[1:36:27] of almighty god
[1:36:28] [Applause]
[1:36:32] hallelujah that's why so much so
[1:36:36] that even after you've been sealed with
[1:36:38] the spirit of god
[1:36:39] there might have been trouble that's
[1:36:41] come in your life and this is why the
[1:36:43] spirit of god would say
[1:36:45] give no place to the devil give no
[1:36:48] thought to the devil give no divisive
[1:36:51] thought to
[1:36:52] the devil amen let the word have free
[1:36:55] course
[1:36:58] if you can only recognize why does the
[1:37:00] devil do that
[1:37:01] why does he try to come that way because
[1:37:04] this word
[1:37:05] he is trembling this word exposes him
[1:37:10] this word takes authority over
[1:37:14] every devil
[1:37:17] and when you can receive it as the word
[1:37:20] of the lord let me just tell you
[1:37:21] the scepter passes to you hallelujah
[1:37:25] amen glory thank you lord
[1:37:30] you don't have to ask the devil cannot
[1:37:31] this cannot you don't have to ask him
[1:37:33] you're not his
[1:37:34] you're not his servant but sam you don't
[1:37:37] know what i did you don't know what i
[1:37:38] did
[1:37:38] i'm not talking about what you did i'm
[1:37:40] talking about the what the words calling
[1:37:41] you to right now
[1:37:45] amen hallelujah there's a greater one
[1:37:48] here
[1:37:49] amen amen the call was to go out
[1:37:54] go out and give your life destruction is
[1:37:58] coming
[1:38:00] come out from the sin of unbelief
[1:38:05] this is what the spirit of god said let
[1:38:07] us go without the camp
[1:38:10] when jesus was standing there the bible
[1:38:13] as it
[1:38:13] as it declares he suffered without the
[1:38:16] gate
[1:38:19] go forth unto him bearing his reproach
[1:38:22] go beyond traditions
[1:38:25] well i believe brother branham was a
[1:38:27] prophet of god go beyond
[1:38:32] say i am the one who god sent the
[1:38:36] message for
[1:38:38] [Music]
[1:38:40] [Applause]
[1:38:42] i'm that you that he said behold i send
[1:38:45] them to
[1:38:46] you elijah the prophet i'm that
[1:38:50] you knew beyond
[1:38:58] sound barriers
[1:39:03] this city i want you to catch me
[1:39:06] whoever remains in this city this city
[1:39:09] think of how many things
[1:39:11] david would write under inspiration even
[1:39:13] many of them that will come
[1:39:15] in the millennium and future home but
[1:39:17] they were also even in that time
[1:39:20] how david would recognize even god's
[1:39:23] choice
[1:39:24] how jerusalem was looked upon how it was
[1:39:27] favored by god but you recognize the
[1:39:30] city itself
[1:39:32] was not the bricks and the mortar
[1:39:37] these bricks out here in this building
[1:39:39] they ain't changed much
[1:39:42] since we've been here since 97. these
[1:39:45] bricks ain't changing man they got a
[1:39:47] little cracks in them here and there
[1:39:49] but they ain't changed much right the
[1:39:52] mortar
[1:39:54] but you see the real building
[1:39:57] is right here
[1:40:01] this is the real building there's mortar
[1:40:04] between those bricks out there
[1:40:05] that is put to hold them bricks together
[1:40:09] those of you know as tile layers and
[1:40:10] whatever more if you don't get that
[1:40:12] mixture just right
[1:40:15] that grout that goes in between the tile
[1:40:17] just like the mortar
[1:40:18] it becomes brittle and can hold nothing
[1:40:22] together and that's what god let him
[1:40:25] know
[1:40:25] you have there has been mortar that has
[1:40:28] been given to you
[1:40:30] that's untempered in the book of ezekiel
[1:40:35] what was the untempered mortar prophets
[1:40:38] prophesying to them
[1:40:39] peace peace everything's gonna be all
[1:40:44] right
[1:40:45] just sow your seed money
[1:40:50] on yeah everything's going to be all
[1:40:52] right god don't care
[1:40:56] it's all right
[1:40:59] blessing lord you believe a message
[1:41:02] don't you brother
[1:41:07] you love brother branham don't you
[1:41:11] pray are you going to preach with me now
[1:41:14] it is true that he said all that you
[1:41:17] ever loved
[1:41:18] and love you will be there
[1:41:21] i don't try to divide or separate or try
[1:41:24] to bring all that understanding
[1:41:25] but i know there's got to be a life that
[1:41:27] follows it i know there's a lot of grace
[1:41:30] and a lot of mercy
[1:41:31] of what god maybe had told as he told
[1:41:33] the prophet at certain times but i'm
[1:41:35] telling you a real life
[1:41:36] it gives itself to this word and it's
[1:41:39] transformed
[1:41:40] brother it loves this word thank god for
[1:41:44] this word why
[1:41:46] [Applause]
[1:41:56] i think you understand that
[1:42:00] verse 3 thus saith the lord this city
[1:42:03] shall surely
[1:42:04] be given into the hand of the king of
[1:42:07] babylon's army which shall take it
[1:42:08] therefore the prince has said unto the
[1:42:10] king we beseech thee
[1:42:12] let this man be put to death here's what
[1:42:15] the princes are saying
[1:42:16] for thus he weakeneth the hands of the
[1:42:20] men of war
[1:42:21] that remain in this city and the hands
[1:42:23] of all the people
[1:42:24] in speaking such words unto them
[1:42:27] he wasn't weakening them he was
[1:42:30] strengthening them
[1:42:32] he was trying to strengthen them in the
[1:42:34] right things
[1:42:36] but they regarded this message as
[1:42:39] treasonous to the nation of israel
[1:42:42] are you with me now they regarded it as
[1:42:45] treasonous
[1:42:46] but remember what god was calling them
[1:42:49] to
[1:42:50] was what they fell from
[1:42:56] treasonous to their first birth
[1:42:59] but god was trying to let them know
[1:43:01] there's a greater reality to line
[1:43:04] yourself up with
[1:43:05] yes he was trying to call him to that
[1:43:08] greater reality look what look how the
[1:43:10] scripture says
[1:43:11] this is what they said for this man
[1:43:13] seeketh not
[1:43:14] the welfare of this people but the hurt
[1:43:21] this man jeremiah he's not seeking the
[1:43:23] welfare of this people you know what the
[1:43:24] word welfare is
[1:43:25] shalom he's not seeking the shalom
[1:43:30] of the people see the reasoning
[1:43:34] the reasoning of man well
[1:43:37] it's coming against me it's against us
[1:43:39] it's not
[1:43:40] he was trying the word was coming to try
[1:43:43] to liberate him
[1:43:44] amen try to set him free it came for
[1:43:48] their welfare
[1:43:49] it was coming to minister to their soul
[1:43:53] this is why god you know he would speak
[1:43:56] here
[1:43:56] think about it it's so contrary
[1:44:00] to to the thinking of of
[1:44:03] of the earth of worldly thinking
[1:44:06] everybody wants to be so lovey-dovey
[1:44:10] and what i mean by lovey-dovey they
[1:44:11] really don't want to be lovey
[1:44:15] they want you to condone
[1:44:20] if you're against what i'm against then
[1:44:21] you're a hater
[1:44:25] david said i hate which thou that which
[1:44:27] thou hates o god
[1:44:29] amen if it's against god's word
[1:44:33] then i hate it
[1:44:35] [Applause]
[1:44:38] if it's for god's word then i'm for it
[1:44:49] let me just stay here
[1:44:54] this is why god would say as many as i
[1:44:56] love
[1:44:58] i chase him and rebuke
[1:45:03] it's a word of leadership that god
[1:45:07] would give us
[1:45:10] jesus said when the spirit of truth has
[1:45:12] come he will guide you into all truth
[1:45:17] let me just move on to second chronicles
[1:45:20] 36
[1:45:25] can i have just a few more moments
[1:45:34] this scripture goes and it accounts
[1:45:39] here in second chronicles when zedekiah
[1:45:44] and come on the throne he was 1 and 21
[1:45:46] years old
[1:45:47] when he began to reign and he reigned 11
[1:45:50] years in jerusalem
[1:45:52] and he did that which was evil in the
[1:45:54] sight of the lord his god
[1:45:57] and he and humbled not himself
[1:46:01] before jeremiah the prophet speaking
[1:46:05] from the mouth of the lord
[1:46:12] now we don't have anywhere in scripture
[1:46:15] second kings 24
[1:46:18] jeremiah 52 these portions
[1:46:21] we have nowhere that shows
[1:46:25] that zedekiah was rude
[1:46:30] or spit in his face or anything like
[1:46:33] that
[1:46:37] but you see it was more
[1:46:40] than just his demeanor of person
[1:46:45] god looks on the heart
[1:46:50] while the rest of the world if we take
[1:46:52] isaiah 53
[1:46:54] the rest the rest just eyes of man
[1:46:58] are seeing another man die
[1:47:03] but in the eyes of god it was much
[1:47:06] different
[1:47:08] he saw the travail of his soul
[1:47:13] he saw that that
[1:47:17] surrender that offering up of his life
[1:47:20] completely that you and i might have
[1:47:24] life
[1:47:24] see god looks to the depth of that life
[1:47:28] that's why there's times listen to me
[1:47:30] carefully this is why there's times
[1:47:34] i've just been pastoring here to come in
[1:47:36] here a few in
[1:47:37] 18 years coming since since
[1:47:41] i've been standing here
[1:47:44] there's been times that you can look at
[1:47:46] things i want to see
[1:47:48] you want to see lives move on with god
[1:47:52] but i can't force that right
[1:47:57] and the other part that's true really
[1:47:59] tremendous is
[1:48:01] is i can't see i can't see unless god
[1:48:04] gives me insight into it of how god's
[1:48:08] moving in that heart
[1:48:09] sometimes a person can set and it might
[1:48:12] seem
[1:48:13] no outward movement
[1:48:18] but their heart is being inclined
[1:48:23] to the word of the lord
[1:48:27] this is where this is where it takes
[1:48:31] us as believers to trust in the lord
[1:48:34] corrections got to be given i agree you
[1:48:36] understand with me
[1:48:38] but there's also it takes a discernment
[1:48:40] of the holy spirit this is where
[1:48:42] the trust comes in and and the rest in
[1:48:45] the word of god that
[1:48:46] god himself it's him that starts to work
[1:48:50] and he that begins to work will finish
[1:48:53] the world
[1:48:56] jerubal has hands have laid the
[1:48:58] foundation
[1:48:59] he shall also bring forth the capstone
[1:49:03] in that life
[1:49:05] sometimes god has to come and stir us up
[1:49:08] a little bit
[1:49:09] and he'll have to stir up lives and
[1:49:11] maybe get a little bit comfortable
[1:49:13] and he has to remind us hey you can't
[1:49:15] keep staying
[1:49:16] in this realm they're wonderful you're
[1:49:18] giving your life to the lord
[1:49:20] go on make another step take another
[1:49:22] step
[1:49:23] in obedience be baptized in the name of
[1:49:25] jesus christ
[1:49:26] have you received the holy ghost receive
[1:49:28] the holy ghost
[1:49:30] keep moving on in the word amen
[1:49:35] oh god let my heart be so given and
[1:49:37] friends it just doesn't stop
[1:49:39] with the baptism of the holy ghost it
[1:49:41] there is a continual
[1:49:43] quickening and growth in our life that
[1:49:46] quickening keeps quickening quickening
[1:49:48] quickening quickening quickly
[1:49:49] until the very change of our body
[1:49:56] this is the evil that he did in the
[1:49:57] sight of the lord is god
[1:49:59] humbled not himself before jeremiah the
[1:50:01] prophet speaking from the mouth of the
[1:50:03] lord
[1:50:03] let me just say this
[1:50:08] zedekiah
[1:50:11] had a rich heritage
[1:50:16] he knew what it was to see a humble life
[1:50:20] before him
[1:50:23] josiah was his daddy
[1:50:26] josiah was a man that when he kept the
[1:50:30] passover this is what the scripture said
[1:50:32] there had not been a passover kept
[1:50:36] since the days of samuel it
[1:50:40] leaped solomon since the days of samuel
[1:50:46] he had a god describe josiah as a
[1:50:48] tenderness of heart
[1:50:50] a humbleness of heart a heart that when
[1:50:53] the word was found
[1:50:55] he wept he gave himself to it
[1:51:00] where israel had allowed it to become
[1:51:03] kind of
[1:51:04] dust covered let me just say this
[1:51:13] the message that god has given us in
[1:51:16] this hour
[1:51:18] its full leadership
[1:51:23] are you hearing me it's leadership that
[1:51:26] even
[1:51:27] addresses present social issues
[1:51:32] are you hearing me not according to how
[1:51:36] the flesh sometimes would lack it but
[1:51:38] remember
[1:51:39] don't allow the spirit of this world
[1:51:42] to lead you
[1:51:48] it is leadership that god has given
[1:51:51] knowing
[1:51:51] that things that were sowed as seeds
[1:51:55] of where it would lead to
[1:51:58] leadership is all around the reality is
[1:52:03] everybody is following somebody
[1:52:10] everybody's following somebody
[1:52:16] we want to be found following
[1:52:19] thus saith the lord
[1:52:23] amen i'm going to say this very clearly
[1:52:26] if
[1:52:26] lives and hearts would give themselves
[1:52:28] even more to the word
[1:52:30] and take the value and the authority of
[1:52:32] the word
[1:52:33] they wouldn't be getting caught up in
[1:52:36] all of this
[1:52:36] other mess
[1:52:41] it's leadership that god has given
[1:52:44] those things are traps
[1:52:47] it's traps how many times the spirit of
[1:52:50] god has been saying that to us
[1:52:53] here brother wayne comes in here i don't
[1:52:55] talk to the men that come in here and
[1:52:57] preach
[1:52:58] i don't know you know what i've been
[1:52:59] preaching i don't talk to about those
[1:53:01] things
[1:53:03] but here it comes in and here the spirit
[1:53:04] of god brings it up
[1:53:06] and lets it be known these things are
[1:53:07] traps
[1:53:09] let me just tell you something as much
[1:53:11] as it is for the traps
[1:53:13] about all this other stuff out here is
[1:53:15] traps if these
[1:53:17] things take preeminence in your
[1:53:19] conversations
[1:53:21] if that's number one at your dinner
[1:53:23] table if that's number one in your home
[1:53:25] you need to evaluate the order
[1:53:27] i'm talking leadership here
[1:53:30] i'm talking leadership those words
[1:53:33] do not bring life
[1:53:38] you all understand you know me mo those
[1:53:40] of you you've been here with me
[1:53:42] you know me you know exactly where i'm
[1:53:43] standing i'm not a guy who has my head
[1:53:46] in the sand
[1:53:46] but neither am i going to be a guy who's
[1:53:49] going to be influenced by
[1:53:50] well this one says this brother samuel i
[1:53:53] don't listen to
[1:53:54] none of those fake news but you indulge
[1:53:57] in even all sorts of well this man this
[1:54:00] man saying this and
[1:54:01] this man saying that god has sent us a
[1:54:04] message
[1:54:06] i said god has sent us a message that
[1:54:08] doesn't mean that i don't read the
[1:54:09] newspaper
[1:54:10] that don't mean that i don't look up the
[1:54:12] weather on my app and see is it a good
[1:54:14] time to plan
[1:54:15] it simply means that that voice is what
[1:54:19] has priority in my life
[1:54:22] if there's anything that starts putting
[1:54:25] my direction anywhere else
[1:54:28] it is a hindrance
[1:54:30] [Music]
[1:54:33] if god put me here then it's god's
[1:54:36] duty to protect me he's my provider are
[1:54:41] you with me
[1:54:43] amen that don't mean i don't wear a
[1:54:46] seatbelt
[1:54:49] are you with me i don't mean that i
[1:54:52] don't have home insurance
[1:54:55] that don't mean that i don't have a
[1:54:56] security system right
[1:54:58] but my trust is in the lord
[1:55:02] when you talk to me i don't talk to you
[1:55:05] all about my security system
[1:55:08] oh i got this heating motion detector i
[1:55:11] got this labeled up on all the windows
[1:55:13] i got this if somebody even thinks about
[1:55:18] let's put on because the world we live
[1:55:21] in all right
[1:55:23] but that ain't my priority
[1:55:26] oh i'm telling you what's the truth we
[1:55:28] might as well just
[1:55:30] it's leadership it may not be anything
[1:55:33] knocking down walls but if you receive a
[1:55:35] word it'll help you
[1:55:42] he didn't humble himself
[1:55:51] let's just stop here
[1:55:55] what a value that god sees on humility
[1:56:07] humility
[1:56:11] it's not about us
[1:56:14] really being able to do anything
[1:56:18] but what's real humility is to recognize
[1:56:22] when you're standing in the presence
[1:56:25] of one greater of one who can do
[1:56:29] something
[1:56:32] about your need about your life
[1:56:37] you know that that challenge is always
[1:56:39] put before us
[1:56:40] you know sometimes on the job
[1:56:50] one thing that i prayed when i was
[1:56:53] teaching
[1:56:55] i realized
[1:56:59] i don't have all the answers
[1:57:04] i've realized in pastoring
[1:57:08] i don't have all the answers
[1:57:13] i've realized as a husband i don't have
[1:57:15] all the answers
[1:57:17] i've realized as a dad i don't have all
[1:57:20] the answers
[1:57:27] it's not that we don't want to give
[1:57:28] answers because we want
[1:57:31] the desire within our heart is to want
[1:57:33] to help somebody
[1:57:34] sometimes we're saying what what can i
[1:57:36] say
[1:57:41] but what's important
[1:57:44] is that you know him who is the answer
[1:57:54] there are many times within teaching
[1:57:58] sometimes the answer to the question i
[1:58:01] had
[1:58:03] i had to be willing to hear and to
[1:58:05] listen
[1:58:07] and sometimes the people whom came who
[1:58:10] came to me
[1:58:11] well most of the times in those
[1:58:12] situations they weren't believers
[1:58:16] but there was a wisdom that god would
[1:58:18] god would allow me to
[1:58:20] tap into that would help to address a
[1:58:22] certain problem
[1:58:23] brother samuel who did you give glory to
[1:58:25] well i would thank the individual
[1:58:28] but i would say lord thank you
[1:58:31] for being merciful to me
[1:58:35] and i thank you for preparing my heart
[1:58:37] to be able to receive it
[1:58:40] that i didn't stand there in a way and
[1:58:42] say well
[1:58:43] who's this
[1:58:49] it's to recognize we're in the presence
[1:58:51] of one
[1:58:52] who is greater than ourselves this is
[1:58:55] what
[1:58:56] the scriptures would say submit
[1:58:58] yourselves unto god
[1:59:00] humble yourselves in the sight of god he
[1:59:02] will exalt you
[1:59:05] humble yourself under the mighty hand of
[1:59:08] god notice the mighty hand of god
[1:59:10] and he will exalt thee
[1:59:14] in do time
[1:59:24] we could really preach on that like the
[1:59:27] scripture says
[1:59:28] if there be any sick among you let them
[1:59:32] call for the elders of church
[1:59:33] anointing with oil if there be any sins
[1:59:36] it shall be forgiven
[1:59:39] it shall be well but it didn't give the
[1:59:42] time
[1:59:45] when it says humble thyselves under the
[1:59:47] mighty hand of god and he shall exalt
[1:59:48] thee in due time
[1:59:52] god brings forth out of our life as we
[1:59:55] humble ourselves to him
[1:59:58] and to his presence to recognize
[2:00:04] sometimes that i had together a group of
[2:00:09] i don't know how long ago it's been now
[2:00:10] but a lot of the young
[2:00:13] the married families and the younger
[2:00:16] ones
[2:00:17] children and things and we were talking
[2:00:19] there at the house
[2:00:22] and i was expressing this very part
[2:00:24] about leadership
[2:00:26] sometimes sometimes that is a person
[2:00:28] they
[2:00:29] kick in trouble simon you don't have all
[2:00:32] the answers
[2:00:35] no neither do you
[2:00:39] matter of fact brother brown tells us in
[2:00:40] the message he said if you get a get
[2:00:42] around a man
[2:00:42] and he's telling you he's got all the
[2:00:44] answers he said you better run from him
[2:00:53] we're not led by the wisdom of man
[2:00:58] we're led by the holy spirit
[2:01:02] delivering his word to our life
[2:01:08] he will lead you and guide you into
[2:01:11] all truth i tell you god
[2:01:15] has been doing some wonderful things
[2:01:19] right here in our little assembly
[2:01:24] and i thank him for how that he is
[2:01:28] working touching hearts touching
[2:01:32] lives and moving by his presence amen
[2:01:36] samuel what does it what does it cause
[2:01:38] in you i want to see
[2:01:39] more i want to see more
[2:01:43] of him i want to see more of him
[2:01:48] i want to give myself more to him
[2:01:52] amen i want him to have the uppermost
[2:01:55] seat
[2:01:58] this word that we preach
[2:02:01] this word it packs within it
[2:02:05] a power this is not my thoughts
[2:02:08] this is god's word it packs a power
[2:02:11] and a courage to move
[2:02:15] your life into what god's
[2:02:18] desire is for your life
[2:02:21] amen leadership leadership
[2:02:25] not always something that sounds way out
[2:02:27] there but it comes
[2:02:29] in a still small voice
[2:02:34] but it's with certainty if zedekiah
[2:02:38] could have only received this
[2:02:39] yes he would have received the authority
[2:02:45] to cast down his imaginations
[2:02:50] his reasonings that were holding him
[2:02:52] back
[2:02:54] he would have received a word that could
[2:02:57] have led him
[2:02:59] he would have led his home it would have
[2:03:02] preserved
[2:03:06] it would have preserved his life he
[2:03:08] would have preserved the life
[2:03:09] of his family
[2:03:14] but he had a choice to me
[2:03:18] i say this morning we're standing
[2:03:21] in the presence of that same god
[2:03:26] we've got choices to make
[2:03:29] we've got a choice to make lord
[2:03:33] i want to serve you i want to surrender
[2:03:36] and give my life fully to you
[2:03:39] we've got choices to make us husbands
[2:03:43] as fathers i want to surrender
[2:03:48] my life and lord you to be the first
[2:03:51] place and preeminence
[2:03:57] say well brother simon i'm not a very
[2:03:59] good this it ain't about you being very
[2:04:01] good
[2:04:02] it's depend on him
[2:04:06] depend on him he's the one to lead you
[2:04:09] he's the one to guide you and that same
[2:04:12] god
[2:04:13] that deals with your life even as the
[2:04:15] spirit of god is moving
[2:04:17] so sweetly and it just is
[2:04:20] even here this morning a different it's
[2:04:23] not a different holy spirit but it's a
[2:04:25] you
[2:04:25] you understand just how that god is
[2:04:29] ministering in such a measure and such a
[2:04:32] in such a
[2:04:33] a personal way to give direction in life
[2:04:35] sometimes
[2:04:36] every service itself is different i you
[2:04:40] i perhaps you already see that already
[2:04:42] in different times it's not about
[2:04:44] how this or that it's about him
[2:04:48] it's about him coming the word taking an
[2:04:51] effect
[2:04:52] in our life he let him lead you
[2:04:55] and guide you he will take you in your
[2:04:59] life
[2:04:59] he'll take you you can't get to the
[2:05:01] baptism of the holy ghost
[2:05:03] but he will take you there but i will
[2:05:06] say this to you
[2:05:07] you can't get to your healing but he'll
[2:05:09] take you there
[2:05:11] you can't get to your deliverance but
[2:05:12] he'll take you there amen
[2:05:15] if you can just say lord i believe yes
[2:05:21] i submit myself i cast down my
[2:05:24] reasonings
[2:05:25] i can't figure this out i can't look at
[2:05:28] all this
[2:05:28] i refuse to look at my reasonings and my
[2:05:31] imaginations
[2:05:32] i'm gonna look to you lord
[2:05:35] look away to jesus i'm gonna look to you
[2:05:39] lord
[2:05:40] i'm gonna look beyond i tell you the
[2:05:43] same god
[2:05:45] it's not a man can inspire you to look
[2:05:47] beyond that
[2:05:48] you could a man can come here he could
[2:05:49] speak have everything
[2:05:51] put all together seemingly and it would
[2:05:53] leave you without any vision
[2:05:54] but there's a vision that comes through
[2:05:56] that word that it comes to you and says
[2:05:59] there's a possibility there is a
[2:06:02] possibility
[2:06:03] there is a reality that you can walk
[2:06:06] free
[2:06:07] there's a courage that comes with that
[2:06:09] word
[2:06:11] there's a strength maybe there's a
[2:06:14] string that's been about your
[2:06:16] family something that's been throughout
[2:06:18] your family
[2:06:19] and you can look back and say it's how
[2:06:20] to hold here it's how to hold there
[2:06:23] but you makes you look to the lord and
[2:06:25] say lord
[2:06:27] in me you're the cycle breaker
[2:06:30] hallelujah you recognize there's a
[2:06:33] greater strain
[2:06:34] that comes from predestination a strain
[2:06:37] from the tree of life
[2:06:39] the strain from that seed that's on the
[2:06:41] inside of you
[2:06:44] god opening your eyes to see
[2:06:47] victory where the rest of them saw
[2:06:51] nothing but giants saw nothing but
[2:06:54] defeat
[2:06:55] but david went down there when david saw
[2:06:58] goliath
[2:06:59] all david could see was victory
[2:07:03] hallelujah when joshua and caleb looked
[2:07:06] over there in the land
[2:07:07] all they seen was victory
[2:07:11] because it was the word that gave them
[2:07:14] vision
[2:07:16] they took what the word said beyond what
[2:07:19] their eyes saw
[2:07:23] eyes are more than this it's a mental as
[2:07:25] well
[2:07:27] let's say i take the word of the lord
[2:07:29] amen

[2:07:34] word i'm willing to walk in
