[34:03] good
[34:06] okay I'll let you have your seat just
[34:07] for a moment here
[34:09] right here okay
[34:12] okay
[34:17] think of the first line of Faith as the
[34:19] substance I see they're getting some new
[34:22] gadgets
[34:23] for recording
[34:25] where the brain's always in on this this
[34:28] part of it this is the there we go
[34:32] um
[34:32] I want I want to just briefly just kind
[34:35] of go over I mentioned
[34:38] to you before
[34:39] I think I announced it here just on
[34:42] Thursday
[34:43] um be known by the Barry coffee and
[34:46] asked brother Berry to come
[34:48] and last year there was a little bit of
[34:51] breakdown there between us and I totally
[34:52] take that and he was pretty busy with
[34:55] everything with uh Poland and
[34:57] everything's going on with Ukraine still
[34:59] is very busy with all that but uh what I
[35:02] what I'm I'm asking is and I want to
[35:04] just kind of give you an overview of
[35:06] what it is on Saturday
[35:08] I'm just really asking for that part if
[35:11] we could just really save the date
[35:13] we've got about two two months ahead
[35:15] right here and we've really been in in
[35:18] what's wrong
[35:21] you can't hear
[35:24] there's no mic
[35:28] I'm on
[35:30] am I on now
[35:34] either I was on or you thought you
[35:36] needed hearing aids right
[35:39] that's a good thing now you're like wow
[35:41] thank you Lord you know I didn't see
[35:44] people going like this you know and
[35:45] checking their batteries so
[35:47] yeah you would
[35:49] but um so with with brother brother
[35:53] Barry coffee coming here and I it just
[35:56] it's going to be just a little bit of a
[35:58] unique time and we'll have on Saturday
[36:01] and that's what I really want to talk
[36:03] about is the Saturday uh Gathering
[36:05] because he'll speak for us on Sunday
[36:07] morning and then we'll have a youth
[36:10] meeting
[36:11] like we just had here on Sunday evening
[36:14] and brother Berry will Minister that for
[36:16] us and he's been gracious to do that and
[36:19] this um this date I'm just asking you to
[36:21] save the date and I'm going to go
[36:23] through some of the parts about it so
[36:25] that you kind of understand what we have
[36:27] in mind the brothers that's been like to
[36:29] the men's meetings and things like that
[36:31] you'll you'll completely understand when
[36:33] we say the word sessions it's not going
[36:35] to be preaching there's just going to be
[36:37] a lot of interactive and teaching and
[36:40] and so forth that's going to take place
[36:43] um so
[36:45] and this is going to be the this is the
[36:47] whole subject is the Christian family
[36:50] and um
[36:52] that's what everything is going to be
[36:54] centered around here and I'm going to
[36:56] give this to you it'll come out in in an
[36:59] email even what I have the slides here
[37:02] and if there's any questions you have
[37:03] for me feel free to ask because you'll
[37:06] probably continue to hear me bombarding
[37:09] this whole thing because to me it's an
[37:12] investment
[37:13] that's how I look at it I'm going to
[37:16] just be very honest with you I don't
[37:18] care how as God as long as God allows me
[37:20] to live here upon this Earth
[37:22] if even after my kids are long and gone
[37:26] out of the house
[37:27] if I hear something is going to be
[37:29] spoken on with family You Can Count Me
[37:32] on being there
[37:34] I'm going to be there because I
[37:36] continually I want to grow and to learn
[37:38] because if God carries my
[37:40] responsibilities don't end when they
[37:42] leave home it continues to unfold into
[37:45] another Realm is that right scripture is
[37:48] loaded with that of for that of
[37:49] grandparents and so forth so
[37:52] this is really the layout of the day
[37:55] um I don't know why this isn't
[37:56] responding here okay so this is kind of
[37:58] the layout of the day
[38:00] um
[38:01] it's just and this is going to take
[38:03] place at the Heritage Presbyterian
[38:05] Church not here so it'll be a different
[38:07] uh the you know we've been out there to
[38:09] that uh the fellowship hall out there at
[38:11] the Heritage Presbyterian church and so
[38:13] it's going to be very informal uh the
[38:16] whole setup so uh you know you won't be
[38:18] seeing me in a suit and tie you'll
[38:20] probably see me in a flannel on my boots
[38:21] and my jeans it's just that informal and
[38:24] that's how informal I want it to be
[38:25] because we're not we don't that's not
[38:27] the focus here the focus is is we just
[38:30] we just want to gather everything that
[38:32] God has for us I just want to just be a
[38:35] moment it'll be you know with questions
[38:36] and answers and interactive and these
[38:39] are the sessions there's actually the
[38:40] sessions that are planned out
[38:42] um the first session will be from 10 to
[38:44] 12 and then we'll have lunch and no
[38:47] sisters will not be cooking on that part
[38:49] of it at all so these are some things
[38:52] that we just want to make it all focused
[38:55] on this session two would be from 1 to 2
[38:58] 30 and then session three from three to
[39:00] four Thirty and that's that's that's a
[39:03] pretty packed day in there
[39:04] and that's actually a light day for
[39:06] those that go to men's meeting when you
[39:08] when you come out of that uh because
[39:10] we're clear in until 10 at night
[39:13] uh these are the three sessions these
[39:15] are these are what we're going to be uh
[39:16] the dealing with is establishing the
[39:18] Christian household and then the second
[39:21] session will be the four uh corrective
[39:23] pillars of discipline spiritual verbal
[39:25] behavioral and physical and then session
[39:28] three independent years and I tell you
[39:30] as I said I I'm going to be gleaning
[39:33] from all of it but I know also where I'm
[39:35] where I'm standing right now I'm very
[39:36] much in session three whereas where
[39:38] where my children are at and uh so when
[39:42] I look at it
[39:44] I still to me because everything you
[39:47] look at in the economy of God it always
[39:49] has a spirit there's only the spiritual
[39:51] application is where we pull down into
[39:53] the natural
[39:54] and that's just exactly how it all comes
[39:57] together you hear that through the
[39:58] ministering of the word here you hear it
[40:00] right through the message of the hour
[40:02] and uh I believe that the word of God is
[40:04] meant to be a very practical it's meant
[40:07] to be practical and applied to our
[40:08] hearts and our lives and
[40:10] um I certainly don't feel like in any
[40:13] way and brother Berry we were talking
[40:15] about this I certainly don't feel like
[40:17] that I have a doctorate or a high school
[40:19] degree or anything in child rearing I
[40:23] feel like I'm continuing to grow and I'm
[40:24] continuing to learn and and that's
[40:27] exactly where where that I'm at within
[40:29] that
[40:30] so who is it for and who should be there
[40:34] because I I want to address this because
[40:36] sometimes I've heard statements like
[40:39] even when it came to the men's meeting
[40:41] and everything else
[40:42] and I want to address fears
[40:45] because sometimes it's almost like well
[40:46] I got this
[40:47] or I got and and we want to really look
[40:50] at who is it for you know because
[40:53] perhaps when I started just mentioning
[40:54] some of those things in the beginning I
[40:57] trust that nobody checked out and said
[41:00] that's not for me
[41:02] so who is it for and who should be there
[41:06] and these are some things as brother
[41:07] Barry and I were dialoguing uh regarding
[41:10] this right here
[41:12] and this is really where it's at any
[41:14] single that is at least 20 years old
[41:16] so if you're not if you won't be if it's
[41:19] below that then really the singles it
[41:21] really wouldn't be advantageous but at
[41:23] 20 years old and above uh it'd be very
[41:27] advantageous to be there
[41:29] um and couples that are currently
[41:31] involved in child raising or will be
[41:35] and then grandparents and like I I I was
[41:38] going to just put slides just involving
[41:41] grandparents and
[41:42] I don't have enough room and we wouldn't
[41:44] have enough time I just preach on
[41:45] grandparents you know because the
[41:47] scripture is just just filled with it
[41:48] because you know sometimes we look and
[41:50] say well discipline but you understand
[41:51] that borders themselves it's just like
[41:54] when uh one thing that I wanted with my
[41:57] parents
[41:58] um I just did not want my children to go
[42:00] over to their house and that their
[42:02] children that my children were just like
[42:04] well there's no boundaries I wanted my
[42:06] parents to know this is what our
[42:08] boundaries are so whatever they are at
[42:10] our house I want them over there too
[42:12] so the real reality they're not going to
[42:15] grandparents because it's just like
[42:17] Grandpa and Grandpa don't care what we
[42:19] do but we've got a responsibility by the
[42:20] scripture
[42:21] said teach that children's children
[42:24] so it we have the opportunities and
[42:26] different things and I know like with my
[42:28] boys just they have members remembrances
[42:30] of conversations and times uh with with
[42:34] my my dad and and my mother
[42:38] um who when they go over and stay over
[42:39] my mother's house right now we pray for
[42:41] her because you know she's going to be
[42:42] up late and a lot of times they'll sit
[42:44] around and they're they're just talking
[42:45] they'll talk about the things of the
[42:47] Lord and they have questions and and
[42:49] things they'll talk about I think that's
[42:50] awesome
[42:51] I really think that's awesome and
[42:53] because you know what we're all together
[42:54] on this it's not just one one part you
[42:58] know and that's how I look at it with
[42:59] even with children we don't bring our
[43:01] young people to church and say okay
[43:02] brother Samuel do your job or drop them
[43:05] off at a youth meeting do the job
[43:07] we're taking a Sunday school do the job
[43:09] no that's that's not we we work together
[43:12] we work together we work together and
[43:15] that's the thing that's that's the we've
[43:17] got a vision we've got a goal and I
[43:18] think I think it should be one of those
[43:20] things that remember
[43:21] when Pharaoh was trying to get a
[43:24] compromise with Moses and just said look
[43:26] you're an adult you're older
[43:28] you just be focused on this that you're
[43:30] all wound up and twisted up about just
[43:33] it's an adult thing you be focused about
[43:35] it but Moses with a burden of God and
[43:38] knowing what God had called him to he
[43:40] says no we're not going to leave our
[43:41] little ones behind
[43:44] we're going to bring them with us
[43:46] right
[43:47] every everyone has to have a fresh
[43:50] experience with God is that right
[43:52] but there's no need for our children to
[43:54] go back to Egypt
[43:56] is that right they all got across the
[43:58] Jordan but there's no need to take them
[43:59] back to Egypt we'd come out of Egypt why
[44:01] we don't have to send them back there
[44:02] that's not the experience that that
[44:04] that's needed so I I just encourage that
[44:07] that really that falls almost to the
[44:11] entire assembly and uh I just really
[44:14] when I say and just asking you to save
[44:16] the date I'm just going to make a
[44:17] request and you may not
[44:19] think very good of me but I'm going to
[44:21] ask a requests that if you've got to
[44:22] take a day of vacation it's going to be
[44:24] worth it
[44:26] there's it's an investment that is here
[44:29] and that's what we're looking at and now
[44:30] remember whether you have children yet
[44:33] or not or you will
[44:34] these these are some good practical
[44:36] moments right here to even ask questions
[44:38] or even in dealings with things of
[44:40] grandchildren things that will be out
[44:43] there and how we're working together
[44:46] um so and I'm going to ask I've got a
[44:48] sign up sheet because I'm going to have
[44:51] to know
[44:52] I'm not opening this up to the any other
[44:54] churches right now it's this Saturday is
[44:57] strictly if if I can't open it to
[44:59] anybody else that's fine
[45:02] it's focused and I I'm going to be very
[45:04] selfish with this right here I will open
[45:06] it up if I we have spots and space
[45:08] available but I'm very much focused on
[45:10] this right here for our assembly
[45:13] and I wanted to because I want it to be
[45:15] to where we're able to very uh in that
[45:18] manner to be questions or able to be
[45:20] asked able to be interactive and it
[45:22] isn't just all of a sudden questions
[45:24] where you're just everybody is listening
[45:26] at your question there will be questions
[45:28] submitted and brother Barry will be
[45:30] there even on the side and things like
[45:31] that and uh
[45:33] so I'm going to ask that you would RSVP
[45:36] and I have a sign up sheet and that's
[45:40] going to be put out there on the
[45:42] prayer request table and that table over
[45:44] there if you just would sign up there we
[45:47] have I have to know the number uh
[45:50] because there's things that I have to
[45:51] make copies of that will be coming to me
[45:53] and then also for the food and things
[45:57] like that so all of that I have we have
[45:59] to get that together that's a kind of a
[46:01] big thing and a little bit uh different
[46:03] but there's things that we have to do
[46:05] but it's going to be worth it it's going
[46:08] to be worth it and I'm grateful to God
[46:09] that we have an opportunity and and I'll
[46:11] just say this too if you have maybe you
[46:13] have a spouse you say whether you know
[46:15] my spouse doesn't come to church hey you
[46:17] know as brother bear and I were talking
[46:18] he was really we were very clear it's an
[46:21] awesome wonderful opportunity for an
[46:22] Outreach too because you're not going to
[46:24] be preaching Hellfire and brimstone this
[46:27] is teaching so they can kind of see but
[46:29] see the character of God's always
[46:30] applied and so it's a it's just a great
[46:33] opportunity to reach out so I would say
[46:35] for you that are connected right here uh
[46:38] it's just a just a great great
[46:40] opportunity for that and um
[46:43] I don't think there's anything else that
[46:45] I am forgetting with this right here but
[46:48] um I just to kind of reiterate that
[46:50] before we shift our directions it's the
[46:53] same thing with the family and I I look
[46:56] at it like with marriage I I remember
[46:58] years years ago I asked the Lord I said
[47:00] Lord I want my marriage to continue to
[47:03] Blossom I want it to grow I want to
[47:06] continue to learn
[47:07] and God brought things across my pathway
[47:09] and God began to open those things and
[47:12] and you know what I still I still feel
[47:14] that way even now I want to continue to
[47:18] grow
[47:18] because the very moment that I I don't
[47:21] want to grow that's the moment that I
[47:22] need prayer
[47:24] right because to you know backslide
[47:26] isn't all together to go back it's just
[47:28] failing to move on and I just want to
[47:30] say Lord I I want to go on I want I want
[47:32] more and I just said it like this if I
[47:35] wasn't if we weren't hosting it and I
[47:37] could get in somewhere else and brother
[47:39] Barry or maybe you know one of the other
[47:41] brothers where someone was ministering
[47:43] on this with the Christian family I'm
[47:46] just going to tell you and I'm just
[47:47] saying this from my heart I would be
[47:49] making the sacrifice to do that because
[47:53] I have done that in other instances
[47:55] you say brother Sammy but your kids you
[47:57] know that but I I want I want to grow
[48:00] because I'm also not only as a father
[48:02] I'm a pastor
[48:04] and I want to grow because there's
[48:06] things that I'll be able to see that man
[48:08] it comes right down into our spiritual
[48:09] walking regardless if somebody has kids
[48:11] or either out of the house or what
[48:12] there's such an application and I just I
[48:14] want more of God all that he has for us
[48:17] and anything that we can do and things
[48:19] that we can help along the way we want
[48:21] to do that and that's what that's what
[48:23] this is all about it's a it's a moment
[48:25] so that there's questions and things
[48:27] like that of things to be helped
[48:29] um
[48:29] so I think it's a good opportunity for
[48:33] us to just have a good start with that
[48:35] right there so
[48:36] this right here uh Zachary will you come
[48:39] get this and just put it out there on
[48:40] that table maybe give it to Brother
[48:42] Carlos if you don't know where to put it
[48:43] out there on the table where we do the
[48:45] prayer request so
[48:48] I don't know how to get out of this
[48:52] are you going to switch me off let's
[48:54] stand
[48:58] okay
[49:00] am I off
[49:07] okay
[49:17] praise the Lord thank you musicians
[49:23] if you want to turn in your Bibles let's
[49:25] turn to John chapter 17.
[49:39] it was all kinds of surprises this
[49:42] morning
[49:44] poor brother Trevor I felt so sorry for
[49:46] him on after the was that at the end of
[49:48] the Sunday morning service where
[49:50] I mean it's
[49:54] he was made it was a memory made for
[49:56] sure but I tell you what in the services
[49:58] were when you come down to it wasn't the
[50:01] service was just wonderful last weekend
[50:03] just wonderful and um
[50:06] I I text brother Trevor here this week
[50:09] because I've just
[50:11] just been meditating and there's just
[50:13] things there's there's just things that
[50:15] how God says things at a certain time
[50:17] and I told brother Trevor I said I'm
[50:19] just glad I was there when he was saying
[50:21] those things
[50:22] I'm glad you know I felt I felt like
[50:24] Peter and them they're on the mount
[50:27] Transfiguration it's just good to be
[50:28] here
[50:29] because there's things that God was
[50:31] saying so uh so clearly and um
[50:35] especially in that part where you know
[50:37] it you mentioned with Aaron and the way
[50:39] that God phrased that in that in that
[50:42] time and so and brother Trevor said well
[50:44] I'm just glad he was there when he was
[50:46] saying it too
[50:48] so it just so so uh so so good to be in
[50:52] fellowship and I just appreciate you for
[50:54] also the uh the
[50:58] support within those that were coming in
[51:01] here for the for the youth meeting and
[51:03] just being accommodating helping out all
[51:05] those parts and sometimes I know what
[51:07] the parking and things like that that
[51:08] can be you know an issue and different
[51:10] things we're working on and just making
[51:12] people feel at home and other brothers
[51:14] and sisters and because most importantly
[51:16] is it's a it's about lives being
[51:18] affected by the Lord Jesus and that's
[51:21] what we want more than anything is that
[51:22] right amen
[51:24] so if we could let's just let's read
[51:27] here in John chapter 17 verse 1 and
[51:29] certainly covet your prayers here this
[51:31] morning
[51:33] John 17 verse 1.
[51:36] these words speak Jesus and lifted up
[51:39] his eyes to heaven and said
[51:42] father the hour has come glorify thy son
[51:46] that thy son Also may glorify thee
[51:50] as thou has given him Power Over All
[51:53] Flesh that he should give eternal life
[51:56] to as many as thou has given him so
[52:00] notice the scripture that he should give
[52:03] eternal life
[52:04] to as many as thou has given him so the
[52:07] imparting of eternal life is that God
[52:10] has already is a predestinated plan of
[52:13] God so the whole counsel of God the
[52:17] whole word of God the program of God is
[52:20] a drama that's being unfolded
[52:23] so it's not anything that's new it's God
[52:26] just simply unfolding himself
[52:29] in his children's lives
[52:32] and so as we see here in verse 3 and
[52:35] this is eternal life
[52:38] that they may Know Thee the only true
[52:41] God and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent
[52:46] so what is eternal life that they may
[52:49] Know Thee the only true God and Jesus
[52:52] Christ whom thou Hast sinned
[52:56] I have glorified thee on Earth and I
[52:58] have finished the work which thou gave
[52:59] us me to do and now O Father glorify
[53:03] thou me with thine own self with the
[53:05] glory which I had with thee before the
[53:08] world was
[53:09] I have manifested thy name unto the men
[53:12] which thou gavest me out of the world
[53:15] thine they were and thou gavest them me
[53:19] and they have kept Thy Word
[53:21] now they have known all things
[53:24] whatsoever thou has given me are of Thee
[53:27] for I have given unto them The Words
[53:29] which thou gavest me and they have
[53:31] received them and have known surely that
[53:34] I came out from thee and they have
[53:36] believed that thou didst send me I pray
[53:40] for them
[53:41] and I pray not for the world but for
[53:44] them which thou has given me for they
[53:48] are thine one you know just a side note
[53:52] with on this we always find one thing
[53:54] prayer is always and should always be
[53:58] according to the will of God
[54:00] well Jesus is praying about and
[54:03] interceding is according to the will of
[54:05] God
[54:05] so he's not praying for something that's
[54:07] just you know reaching out here but he's
[54:10] praying according to the will of God and
[54:12] that that Simplicity comes down to God
[54:14] when God speaks to our heart personally
[54:16] and speaking to what uh in this hour
[54:19] he's letting us know this is what my
[54:21] will is and these are the things I want
[54:23] you to pray about these are the things I
[54:25] want you to ask for isn't that wonderful
[54:27] yeah so we're not guessing of what what
[54:29] should I be praying about God's letting
[54:31] us know personally what we're to be
[54:34] praying about and he Delights in that he
[54:37] Delights in that because prayer itself
[54:39] even is an act of faith and submitting
[54:42] to what the word is calling for in our
[54:43] life
[54:44] powerful right verse 10 and all mine are
[54:48] thine and thine are mine and I am
[54:51] glorified in them
[54:54] let's just pray Heavenly Father
[54:57] Lord we're just so thankful Lord that
[55:01] you have made a way for us to be
[55:03] gathered together this morning
[55:05] now Lord we ask that God is you Lord
[55:09] have come right here among us we pray
[55:12] that Lord that you'll help us Lord
[55:14] together speaker and hear that God we
[55:17] can just be able to Step Beyond and
[55:20] laying aside of the cares the thoughts
[55:23] worries so forth of this life and not
[55:26] just to lay them aside to pick him back
[55:28] up but to put them before you Lord and
[55:32] we ask that you'll just come Lord in a
[55:34] special way may you anoint us to gather
[55:37] Lord that father that you can just Lord
[55:42] have your way father in this service
[55:44] Lord I just Reserve myself to you I pray
[55:48] that God you'll drive away all weariness
[55:50] and tiredness Lord just for these few
[55:52] moments Lord as we would enter in Lord
[55:55] into the your presence May the word of
[55:57] God just find its place in our lives
[56:00] Lord we love you and we thank you father
[56:02] in Jesus precious name amen amen God
[56:06] bless you as you're being seated if you
[56:08] would I'm just going to skip some verses
[56:11] uh I'd like to read them but for sake of
[56:13] time let's just go straight to verse 20
[56:16] if we could
[56:20] and hear the Lord Jesus he says neither
[56:24] pray I
[56:26] for these alone but for them also which
[56:30] Shall Believe on me
[56:32] through their word
[56:34] that they all may be one now here he's
[56:39] laying out the
[56:41] the full conditions and the criteria
[56:44] this is what the prayer is about that
[56:47] they all may be one how
[56:50] how is that
[56:52] here amongst a group of individuals
[56:56] take for example the apostles
[56:58] we can go through the scriptures even
[57:01] before this right here
[57:03] and
[57:04] at one point
[57:06] they were arguing who's going to be the
[57:08] greatest in the Kingdom
[57:11] you're also seeing just the snapshots
[57:13] before that they're all very different
[57:17] Peter's much different from Andrew
[57:20] you get what I'm saying they're all very
[57:22] different so how are they going to be
[57:24] one because that's a question we know
[57:26] the spirit of God through the message in
[57:29] this hour has addressed that question
[57:31] because that very statement has been
[57:34] made of well we got to get all the
[57:35] churches together but that's that's not
[57:38] what he said
[57:40] that's not what he called for
[57:43] God's desire remember Redemption is to
[57:47] bring back restore what's been lost
[57:51] and this is what he said that they all
[57:54] may be one as thou father are in me and
[58:01] I in thee so as the The Living Word of
[58:06] God almighty God the Holy Spirit
[58:09] dwelling there in that life but it was
[58:12] all showing as it was there dwelling in
[58:15] that life of the Lord Jesus his life
[58:18] reflected every promise that was spoken
[58:24] for his life
[58:26] is that right so it works because when
[58:29] the Holy Spirit fully comes in it puts
[58:32] us and places Us in the word so then our
[58:36] life becomes a word life that's being
[58:39] expressed from the root of our desires
[58:43] it's expressing the word so how are they
[58:46] to be one as thou father are in me and I
[58:49] and thee that they also may be one in us
[58:54] that the world may believe that thou has
[58:58] sent me
[58:59] and the glory which thou gave us me I
[59:02] have given them that they may be one
[59:06] even as We Are One i in them and thou in
[59:13] me that they may be made perfect or
[59:16] complete in one and that the world may
[59:20] know that thou has sent me and has loved
[59:23] me as thou Hast has loved them as thou
[59:26] Hast loved me
[59:29] I'd like to just just begin speaking
[59:31] here just a a thought
[59:33] when we begin to look at it and and
[59:36] there is quite a bit that I'm just going
[59:38] to just say to you from just meditating
[59:40] on things that were spoken last Sunday
[59:43] and then from the previous Sunday
[59:44] certain things that begin to touch into
[59:47] how the Lord was directing on with
[59:48] identified gifts of God and I just
[59:51] there's just certain things that it just
[59:53] is meditating on it and just couldn't
[59:56] just couldn't get away from it not that
[59:58] you want to get away from it but you
[59:59] know you're laying it before the Lord
[1:00:00] and Lord what do you want and and it
[1:00:03] really I'll tell you really the phrase I
[1:00:05] hope I can say it correctly because I
[1:00:06] didn't have time I've got the minute
[1:00:08] marked uh when brother Trevor uh the
[1:00:10] Lord spoke it through him but you know
[1:00:12] he wants to be he wants to be as he used
[1:00:14] you Aaron he says he wants to be Aaron
[1:00:16] but he wants to be Aaron as Jesus would
[1:00:17] be Aaron
[1:00:19] so whatever your name is like he wants
[1:00:21] to be Samuel but he wants to be but he
[1:00:23] wants to be Samuel as Jesus would be
[1:00:25] saying
[1:00:26] so we put our so that that's really you
[1:00:28] understand that that's really the basis
[1:00:30] of some things that I just want to start
[1:00:32] working with and just kind of moving
[1:00:34] with and that is I want to deal with the
[1:00:36] working of Oneness with God in you
[1:00:39] the working of Oneness with God in you
[1:00:42] and you know to see it then within the
[1:00:46] body
[1:00:47] to see it in our families to see it
[1:00:50] working because it's the Oneness of God
[1:00:52] and that program and that that pattern
[1:00:54] that's laid down and I just say it in
[1:00:57] this way God does nothing outside of man
[1:01:00] God chose men he could have chose
[1:01:03] anything to preach the gospel but he
[1:01:05] chose man
[1:01:06] when God came in Redemption God came
[1:01:10] he became man
[1:01:11] he became one of us God created
[1:01:15] apart to become one with his creation
[1:01:19] God God created himself a body to step
[1:01:23] down into
[1:01:26] and I say that very slowly with this
[1:01:29] intention because Jesus was not a
[1:01:31] separate person from God
[1:01:34] because with that thought line it leaves
[1:01:36] you separate
[1:01:38] because who do you have in you if you
[1:01:40] have the Holy Spirit you have Jesus
[1:01:44] which we know who is that that's God you
[1:01:48] have a portion is that right
[1:01:51] so when so when we're understanding this
[1:01:53] that's why Satan has attacked that
[1:01:55] Revelation and in this end time that's
[1:01:58] why you'll hear the Holy Spirit picking
[1:02:00] up through the message even to the black
[1:02:03] brother who wrote the song
[1:02:05] uh back in the 1900s this is the evening
[1:02:09] time
[1:02:10] oh I can't remember uh the the path to
[1:02:13] Glory you will surely find that's how he
[1:02:17] wrote it that we you know we
[1:02:19] somehow got a hold of and got slowed
[1:02:21] down you know but that's really how I
[1:02:22] was wrote and and he wrote that out of
[1:02:24] the inspiration because they were
[1:02:26] wanting to split up the godhead and he
[1:02:27] locked himself away I'm talking about
[1:02:29] the 1900. he locked himself away he was
[1:02:33] not going to receive the counsel of the
[1:02:35] church at that time and it was just a
[1:02:37] burden what was it it was God laying
[1:02:39] that upon his heart think of what was
[1:02:41] wrote in that hour did he understand
[1:02:43] everything that was wrote I dare say he
[1:02:46] didn't understand it all to the degree
[1:02:48] and what you and I have had have the
[1:02:51] privilege of not just understanding but
[1:02:53] walking in and having it working in our
[1:02:56] life where we're singing it the path to
[1:02:58] Glory you shall surely find we are
[1:03:01] singing it we Are Witnesses of the path
[1:03:04] of Glory that's been revealed if this is
[1:03:07] the evening time
[1:03:09] we are the evening time people
[1:03:11] right so God moving and he operates he
[1:03:17] works through man and it's gone now I
[1:03:20] want you to understand God
[1:03:22] does not it's not that God needs
[1:03:26] us
[1:03:28] but yet he uses us what he needs what
[1:03:32] God desires and what God moves upon is
[1:03:35] that word that he's already sown and
[1:03:39] been placed in our life and that's what
[1:03:41] God brings forth which is actually
[1:03:42] himself
[1:03:44] so the new birth is actually God giving
[1:03:47] birth to himself in you
[1:03:49] it's God being born in your life
[1:03:52] okay so now we understand that this and
[1:03:56] end now everything is an individual
[1:03:58] Affair between us and God
[1:04:00] right we can come together as a family
[1:04:02] but but a family just being part of a
[1:04:04] family just being in a church doesn't
[1:04:06] save us
[1:04:08] it does just just that it has an
[1:04:10] individual Affair between us and God
[1:04:14] right and this is why when we see that
[1:04:18] in coming back into this place right
[1:04:20] here brother Brown will make the
[1:04:21] statement God is identified by his
[1:04:24] characteristic and right before he says
[1:04:26] that he says you are identified by
[1:04:28] characteristic now how many of you have
[1:04:30] ever had somebody mention someone else's
[1:04:33] name like for example they said Ray
[1:04:36] okay now if somebody's gonna you know
[1:04:39] they're talking now they might ask Ray
[1:04:41] who Joy who
[1:04:43] why there could be a lot of Joeys right
[1:04:48] I mean there could be a lot of or others
[1:04:50] of that name and the reason what they're
[1:04:52] asking for is what's the surname what's
[1:04:54] the last name now we know I mean you
[1:04:57] know internet and things like that you
[1:04:59] can look up and there's multiple Samuel
[1:05:01] brownings and you know and and so forth
[1:05:03] you know
[1:05:05] but they're all not as good as me
[1:05:11] you okay brother so and and but when you
[1:05:15] think of it you see that's why you can
[1:05:17] look this all up and somebody else can
[1:05:19] say oh Sammy a brownie now
[1:05:21] it may not be me that they've met or
[1:05:24] they know
[1:05:26] right it might have been another Dave
[1:05:28] Kress right I know there is actually
[1:05:29] another Dave Crest but that's a bad
[1:05:31] example but if you understand that
[1:05:33] that's why there's times where things
[1:05:34] that you ask I've asked them before
[1:05:36] somebody mentions a name when I was
[1:05:38] teaching school and they said you're
[1:05:39] going to have so-and-so so and so who
[1:05:41] what's your last name
[1:05:43] you know why because I know
[1:05:45] as soon as they say that last name oh
[1:05:48] Lord prayer and fasting now this summer
[1:05:52] why because it could have been many
[1:05:55] times or you know Larry's or whatever
[1:05:57] but as soon as they put that last name
[1:05:59] there what is it what is it that I'm
[1:06:01] groaning about not the name that they
[1:06:03] are expressing as far as saying Larry
[1:06:05] it's the character that's been expressed
[1:06:08] that says oh no
[1:06:10] they're not in my class surely not
[1:06:15] Lord be merciful
[1:06:18] so you you and I are identified by
[1:06:22] characteristics I mean you know this
[1:06:23] with business there's some people that
[1:06:25] you hear certain things about business
[1:06:26] you're like not having them here
[1:06:30] right
[1:06:31] you you we understand we understand that
[1:06:33] that characteristic becomes the display
[1:06:35] so you we've got that now God is
[1:06:38] identified by his great characteristic
[1:06:40] he cannot change
[1:06:43] he can't his masks can change but he
[1:06:47] can't
[1:06:49] right
[1:06:50] Jeremiah Elijah Elijah his mask but not
[1:06:53] him
[1:06:54] in Malachi 360 he said I'm God and I
[1:06:57] change not he absolutely doesn't change
[1:06:59] his characteristics are the same so it
[1:07:04] comes down to its almighty God working
[1:07:06] through the individual by an individual
[1:07:10] experience of the Holy Ghost that's the
[1:07:12] new birth yet God comes in many
[1:07:14] different forms as we just mentioned God
[1:07:16] he came to Abraham in many different
[1:07:18] forms right but he was the same God all
[1:07:21] the time
[1:07:22] what do we mean by the same God all the
[1:07:25] time his nature Remains the Same
[1:07:30] when he makes himself known it will
[1:07:33] never contradict a prior revealing
[1:07:38] are you hearing me it'll never
[1:07:40] contradict a prior revealing because
[1:07:42] it's him all along
[1:07:46] is that right so now as we come to it
[1:07:50] God drawing down into into our lives in
[1:07:53] First Corinthians chapter 6 verse 19
[1:07:55] Paul writes of this declaration know you
[1:07:59] not that your body is the Temple of the
[1:08:03] Holy Ghost which is in you which you
[1:08:05] have of God and you're not your own you
[1:08:08] are bought with a prize therefore
[1:08:10] glorify God in your body and in your
[1:08:13] spirit which are Gods so the price the
[1:08:18] penalty that's already been paid for
[1:08:22] there's there's no excuse because the
[1:08:25] penalty's been paid for and see the holy
[1:08:27] spirit is ministering to you and I this
[1:08:31] is not only our rights but it's what God
[1:08:34] has desired for you and I
[1:08:38] then my body was not meant to be an
[1:08:41] expression of sin my body was meant to
[1:08:45] be a display of the king of glory
[1:08:47] [Applause]
[1:08:48] right you can go to the store and buy
[1:08:51] picture frames is that right when you
[1:08:53] buy that picture frame you might display
[1:08:55] your family or extended family one or
[1:08:58] more but if I have that same picture
[1:08:59] frame who am I going to display my
[1:09:01] family is that right and that's the same
[1:09:04] way in our lives our life is that which
[1:09:07] is framed by God's grace to display His
[1:09:12] Image in this time and that's what the
[1:09:15] Holy Spirit calls you and I too that's
[1:09:18] the water of the word it calls us to
[1:09:20] that reality that hey there's something
[1:09:22] higher there's something greater there's
[1:09:25] the purpose of God for your life what
[1:09:27] you've been longing for what you've been
[1:09:29] craving for that deep that's yearning on
[1:09:31] the inside he is the satisfier of that
[1:09:36] [Music]
[1:09:37] but Brandon picks this up in the
[1:09:39] Ephesian age he says Man was created for
[1:09:43] God
[1:09:44] man wants to be the temple of God the
[1:09:47] place of God's rest the holy spirit that
[1:09:50] place of rest was man the temple
[1:09:54] now let's hear in Acts chapter 7 just
[1:09:57] this is as the prophet has this laid out
[1:09:59] here here here here is Stephen remember
[1:10:02] Stephen is declaring to uh the Pharisees
[1:10:06] the religious in that day
[1:10:08] of the Fulfillment of this word who
[1:10:12] found favor with God and desired to find
[1:10:15] a tabernacle for the god of Jacob who
[1:10:18] put that in David's heart
[1:10:21] well David was just a good old boy no
[1:10:24] who put that in his heart
[1:10:26] who put it in his heart to where there
[1:10:28] wasn't enough enemies around to take it
[1:10:30] out
[1:10:31] who put it in his heart that he spent
[1:10:33] the latter part of his life he would
[1:10:36] never see the temple come to pass but he
[1:10:39] says as long as I'm here I am going to
[1:10:41] be found working for the Lord I'm gonna
[1:10:44] lay up what's needed you know why
[1:10:47] because it had been revealed to him and
[1:10:49] that's why he said that very thing I'll
[1:10:51] pray for that's why David was moved upon
[1:10:54] bringing gold in bringing wood in
[1:10:56] bringing those other things what was it
[1:10:58] he was a burden of God that was moving
[1:11:01] upon David did David have it right every
[1:11:04] time like when you know they were
[1:11:06] wanting to bring the ark up no but he
[1:11:08] received correction
[1:11:10] right when they had another they had
[1:11:13] others mother men trying to bring the
[1:11:15] ark up and remember the man was killed
[1:11:17] because he was meant for the priest to
[1:11:19] Bear the ark over the heart
[1:11:23] but you see David had a burden but what
[1:11:26] it is is that burden had to be channeled
[1:11:29] through the word of God
[1:11:31] I'm grateful that God didn't leave you
[1:11:33] and I to our own devices
[1:11:38] you hear me I mean
[1:11:40] there's Christian bookstores that make
[1:11:42] this building and everything else look
[1:11:44] like just like a little shed filled with
[1:11:48] books
[1:11:49] and I'm not against books but you see no
[1:11:52] matter whatever that we desire to do God
[1:11:55] always he'll send his word through his
[1:11:59] prophet
[1:12:01] right
[1:12:02] David won a Revival but you gotta come
[1:12:04] to channel and that channel is the word
[1:12:08] you can't get outside of that and expect
[1:12:10] a Revival so here notice but Solomon
[1:12:14] built him a house how be it the most
[1:12:16] high dwelleth not in temples made with
[1:12:21] hands
[1:12:22] and saith the prophet Heaven is my
[1:12:24] throne and Earth as my footstool what
[1:12:26] house will ye build me saith the Lord
[1:12:28] for what is the place of my wrath hath
[1:12:30] not my hand made all these things
[1:12:33] now I want you just to think of this a
[1:12:36] temple not made with hands now
[1:12:38] when you think how Paul has placed us
[1:12:41] here your body is the Temple of the Holy
[1:12:44] Ghost
[1:12:45] and remember you your body it's three
[1:12:49] parts
[1:12:51] flesh Spirit soul
[1:12:55] the Tabernacle in the wilderness
[1:12:57] every Solomon's Temple on and on it's
[1:13:00] always three courts because that's man
[1:13:04] right then we go on and on with that
[1:13:06] that triunity it's man and how God's
[1:13:09] desire was to dwell inside of man so
[1:13:12] though God's real Dwelling Place I just
[1:13:14] ask you what's God's real Dwelling Place
[1:13:16] My Flesh
[1:13:18] is that the primary no
[1:13:20] no my spirit
[1:13:22] no what's the primary place so that's
[1:13:26] the temple not made with hands
[1:13:29] father and mother were moved upon this
[1:13:32] came forth right it didn't now this came
[1:13:36] forth not according to the perfect will
[1:13:38] but the permissive will of God
[1:13:40] so just so you know sorry when we get to
[1:13:42] the other side I'm not going to look
[1:13:43] different
[1:13:45] you're not going to look different I
[1:13:47] can't get there today
[1:13:49] because we're not all going to be the
[1:13:51] same on the other side
[1:13:53] are you hearing me so what is that
[1:13:55] Temple that's not made with ants it's
[1:13:57] that soul that came from God that that
[1:14:00] predestinated seed that part is a place
[1:14:03] and brother Branham even placed it like
[1:14:04] this it's God's faith moving into that
[1:14:07] place in our life that it actually
[1:14:09] receives himself into there
[1:14:12] so it's not even you and I say it I
[1:14:14] received the Holy Ghost no remember how
[1:14:16] brother Brown tells us he said I don't
[1:14:18] think you should say that I think you
[1:14:20] need to declare the Holy Ghost has
[1:14:22] accepted me
[1:14:24] right
[1:14:25] because that's what it's all about so
[1:14:27] it's God coming in into that place and
[1:14:29] it's God preparing it to wear everything
[1:14:32] that first nature is lining up it begins
[1:14:35] to agree with the word and then God can
[1:14:37] kill it and then here he moves down to
[1:14:39] raise up that new man
[1:14:43] but through the temple now let's look at
[1:14:45] this through that temple on the inside
[1:14:48] through the uppermost seat
[1:14:50] his glory was reflected
[1:14:53] into the inner court or holy place
[1:14:57] and on out into the outer Court
[1:15:00] it was all called all of it was called
[1:15:03] what the Tabernacle of God
[1:15:07] right so the token we don't just have
[1:15:10] the token in certain places in our home
[1:15:13] hello somebody we don't just have the
[1:15:15] Holy Spirit applied just in certain
[1:15:17] places of our life because that's not a
[1:15:19] true application the token applied is
[1:15:21] where his life
[1:15:23] it's come on to the innermost in of the
[1:15:26] inside by the new birth that's why Jesus
[1:15:29] said you must be born again
[1:15:34] notice this in First Corinthians 3 16
[1:15:36] know you not that you are a temple of
[1:15:39] God and that the spirit of God
[1:15:42] dwelleth in you
[1:15:44] now
[1:15:46] as he goes on to say know you not that
[1:15:48] your bodies are the members of Christ
[1:15:49] shall I then take the members of Christ
[1:15:52] and make them the members of a harlot
[1:15:53] God forbid what no you're not that that
[1:15:57] which is joined to a harlot is one body
[1:15:59] for two saith thee shall be one flesh
[1:16:01] but he that is joined unto the Lord is
[1:16:05] one spirit
[1:16:08] so think of the Tabernacle in the
[1:16:11] wilderness
[1:16:12] that was was a heavenly vision Moses was
[1:16:17] caught up
[1:16:18] and even Hebrews declares that Exodus
[1:16:20] declares it he was bitten by God and
[1:16:24] here he comes up comes into the cloud
[1:16:26] and he receives the heavenly vision and
[1:16:30] what he sees there there is already
[1:16:32] material on Earth
[1:16:35] that can be and is to be assembled so
[1:16:38] the reality is the vision from heaven
[1:16:41] will be reflected in Earth and the
[1:16:43] Earthly material that comes under the
[1:16:46] divine order
[1:16:48] as it's surrendered to God
[1:16:50] so the Earthly material everything
[1:16:52] that's had the black onyx stones and on
[1:16:54] and on
[1:16:59] order yet but the vision from that
[1:17:02] heavenly vision when it comes forth and
[1:17:05] is declared something grabs the hearts
[1:17:07] of the people and those that have a part
[1:17:10] that goes into that they surrender that
[1:17:13] part and what does it do it comes under
[1:17:15] divine order for it to be placed in a
[1:17:19] certain place those who had the black
[1:17:21] onyx Stones did not get to decide where
[1:17:23] they go
[1:17:25] God already had that determined
[1:17:28] you and I did not determine what age we
[1:17:30] would be born into we did not determine
[1:17:33] the message that we would walk in that
[1:17:35] has already been determined before the
[1:17:38] foundation of the world
[1:17:40] so where does it come to you and I when
[1:17:42] the heavenly vision is being declared
[1:17:45] because remember you say a vision I
[1:17:48] don't see a vision brother REM said
[1:17:49] every time you open the Bible you see a
[1:17:51] vision
[1:17:52] that's good
[1:17:54] Hallelujah the word of the Lord came to
[1:17:56] Abraham by vision
[1:17:58] there's an understanding it's something
[1:18:00] that grips our life and what is it it
[1:18:02] brings us to surrender I don't know I
[1:18:05] don't know I don't have to figure out
[1:18:06] where I fit in I just know I belong to
[1:18:08] him he will guide me
[1:18:10] [Applause]
[1:18:16] so God's desire
[1:18:19] has always been to be one with his
[1:18:21] creation as he had it in Eden
[1:18:27] and what Eden was was a reflection of
[1:18:30] what God had in his mind
[1:18:32] where God fellowshipped with his
[1:18:35] thoughts remember he asked job
[1:18:38] you feel like you've had laid all these
[1:18:40] questions and everything else I'm going
[1:18:41] to start out with one question and I'm
[1:18:43] just gonna and God just floors him God
[1:18:46] don't stop asking questions but he
[1:18:48] starts with one question where were you
[1:18:51] before the foundation of the world when
[1:18:53] the morning Stars
[1:18:56] shouted for joy
[1:18:59] where was that at that was in the mind
[1:19:02] of God
[1:19:04] right the Bible says in Revelations 13 8
[1:19:07] the lamb was slain before the foundation
[1:19:11] of the world for all the names that were
[1:19:14] on the book
[1:19:16] is that right that's a scripture so this
[1:19:18] is not we are not speaking of anything
[1:19:20] that's haphazard we're speaking of a
[1:19:22] Divine Assurance it's God unfolding
[1:19:25] himself in his children
[1:19:28] so it's God's desire what Eden was was
[1:19:32] the reflection of what God had in his
[1:19:34] mind and you and I are an attribute of
[1:19:37] God that God desires to fellowship with
[1:19:42] God is wrong let me say this to you you
[1:19:45] think you're longing or I could think my
[1:19:47] longing let me tell you where did you
[1:19:49] get that longing from
[1:19:52] well I was a good Sunday school student
[1:19:54] that didn't do it
[1:19:56] it could stir things up but that didn't
[1:19:58] do it
[1:19:59] come on Friends
[1:20:00] you can't it's not a Works unless any
[1:20:03] man should boast thank God for good
[1:20:05] preaching thank God for youth meanings
[1:20:07] thank God for Godly Parents but it is
[1:20:10] not a work of man
[1:20:12] it's a work of the Holy Spirit what is
[1:20:15] it it is Mama Eagle knowing she's got
[1:20:18] some English and she's searching for
[1:20:21] them and like you take a magnet and a
[1:20:24] magnet moves right down through a place
[1:20:26] what will a magnet do it will only draw
[1:20:29] and attract that which has properties
[1:20:32] to be drawn upon
[1:20:37] now you might be bolted down with sin
[1:20:39] and you're filling the pool and the
[1:20:40] enemy trying to bolt you down he might
[1:20:42] be trying to come and you know tighten
[1:20:43] you down with a with a pressure hammer
[1:20:45] and things like that but if you belong
[1:20:46] to God
[1:20:51] Hallelujah they're in a boat strong
[1:20:53] enough there ain't a devil big enough
[1:20:57] he said I will not lose a one
[1:21:04] I don't care what it looks like
[1:21:06] I don't care what it looks like in your
[1:21:07] family I don't care what brother
[1:21:08] so-and-so I don't care what it looks
[1:21:10] like he said he won't lose the one
[1:21:12] [Applause]
[1:21:17] well brother Samuel but I don't know if
[1:21:19] they are or not why would you even
[1:21:20] entertain that thought
[1:21:22] shame on you
[1:21:23] you claim them you stand on that
[1:21:26] it belongs to God doubt is not welcome
[1:21:29] here unbelief is not welcome here
[1:21:33] this picture frame only is here to
[1:21:36] display one thing the same Grace that
[1:21:39] found me and picked me up and changed me
[1:21:42] it's my life to display that same Grace
[1:21:46] that the world may know that thou Hast
[1:21:49] sent me
[1:21:56] um
[1:21:59] Philippians 2 5.
[1:22:02] let this mind
[1:22:05] be in you
[1:22:07] he ain't talking about this matter up
[1:22:09] here but we need his mind his life to
[1:22:12] come in to help us not only to change us
[1:22:16] but we need to live by that we'll still
[1:22:19] have this but we need to live by that
[1:22:21] and we need to let this influence this
[1:22:23] when this Rises up wait a minute here
[1:22:25] that's not according to this
[1:22:29] probably
[1:22:31] brother Samuel somebody's seen you like
[1:22:33] that they'd lock you up oh don't look at
[1:22:35] me funny now I know probably every one
[1:22:36] of you have a special person you talk to
[1:22:42] why did you do this why did you let this
[1:22:44] go I'll tell you knew hey who are you
[1:22:46] talking to oh nobody nobody nobody
[1:22:50] you know what I'm talking about now we
[1:22:52] we ain't gonna go down that alley but
[1:22:54] you know what I'm talking about
[1:22:56] right now think of it here within our
[1:22:59] lives these are things that we can look
[1:23:01] at it and say no I ain't going that way
[1:23:04] nope I ain't going that direction
[1:23:07] nope not gonna do that and Satan can sit
[1:23:09] there and try to feed you everything but
[1:23:10] you got to write to and you got this and
[1:23:12] they did this or this and this and this
[1:23:13] but there's something on the inside what
[1:23:16] is it it's God's mind working
[1:23:20] greater is he that is in you
[1:23:25] then he that's in the world
[1:23:28] and let me just let's just put it on
[1:23:29] notice the world that's even including
[1:23:31] the first birth greater is he that's in
[1:23:33] here on the throne I am ruling by that
[1:23:37] of the of the very life of God who's
[1:23:39] Seated on the throne you know what he's
[1:23:41] told me he's told me I'm a son of God
[1:23:44] he's told me whatsoever you bind on
[1:23:46] Earth I bind in heaven
[1:23:49] Son of God daughter of God so now let's
[1:23:51] look at this this scripture here
[1:23:54] who being in the form of God
[1:23:59] fought it not robbery
[1:24:01] to be equal with God
[1:24:03] now I like this this word here
[1:24:06] this word robbery think about this he
[1:24:09] fought it not robbery to be what in
[1:24:10] other words he wouldn't just
[1:24:13] the Lord Jesus you'll never find
[1:24:14] anywhere in the scripture where he was
[1:24:16] tiptoeing around as a matter of fact he
[1:24:18] would say I'm a father of one
[1:24:22] he wasn't saying that to brag that's his
[1:24:24] confession
[1:24:25] that was a confession that was true this
[1:24:27] is this is how it is
[1:24:29] now the writing remember there's oh thou
[1:24:32] blasphemest
[1:24:33] well what was the whole plan of the
[1:24:35] Messiah coming
[1:24:38] what was the whole purpose of redemption
[1:24:40] God to become flesh
[1:24:44] to pay the price right that his life
[1:24:47] might return come back into you and I
[1:24:50] bring that ransom for us so now it's
[1:24:52] probably not robbery to be equal with
[1:24:54] God and I like this this of the robbery
[1:24:56] you might have it in the middle of your
[1:24:57] a Bible there in the in the margin but
[1:24:59] this is this is the reality of this word
[1:25:01] robbery and this is what it means
[1:25:04] he thought it not robbery or robbery
[1:25:06] meaning a thing to be grasped after like
[1:25:08] oh
[1:25:10] I'm trying to be a Son of God oh I'm
[1:25:13] trying to be a daughter of God oh if I
[1:25:15] can he fought it not robbery in other
[1:25:18] words me claiming of who I am is not
[1:25:22] taken away from God
[1:25:26] are you hearing me it's not taken away
[1:25:28] from God because I know what he's done
[1:25:31] in my life now it's true I may not be
[1:25:33] aware I should be and where I want to be
[1:25:36] but I cannot deny what he's already done
[1:25:38] and it's not robbery
[1:25:41] [Applause]
[1:25:43] and I'm not grasping off I can just be a
[1:25:46] daughter of God if I can just be good
[1:25:47] enough someday or if I could just see
[1:25:49] that's what the devil wants he wants to
[1:25:50] constantly right here
[1:25:52] okay and grasping
[1:25:55] that is not the Holy Spirit
[1:25:58] let me just put it on notice right now
[1:26:01] get out of here Satan
[1:26:05] get out of here we can just open the
[1:26:07] doors and say go
[1:26:09] hold your peace and leave
[1:26:16] let me say it's God's will
[1:26:19] the will of God as brother Trevor was
[1:26:21] ministering on that here on Sunday
[1:26:23] evening finding the will of God
[1:26:26] we pick those things up even with the
[1:26:27] young people on Friday night and had a
[1:26:29] wonderful time of fellowship and
[1:26:31] discussion just around that right there
[1:26:33] but it is the will of God what is the
[1:26:35] ultimate of the will of God
[1:26:38] well Mary so and so no no what's the
[1:26:40] ultimate
[1:26:42] the ultimate of God's will
[1:26:44] is that he be tabernacled in you
[1:26:50] that's the ultimate because then when we
[1:26:53] begin to pray
[1:26:54] we're not praying
[1:26:56] with other desires
[1:26:59] we're praying
[1:27:01] according
[1:27:02] to that desire that's within us
[1:27:04] that's where John 15 comes in it says
[1:27:07] that you know ask the father anything in
[1:27:09] my name and I'll do it uh if you abide
[1:27:11] in me and my words abide in you ask what
[1:27:13] you will and it shall be done
[1:27:16] see it's all working it's taking in of
[1:27:18] the words and so here we find so the
[1:27:20] ultimate this is why Paul could write
[1:27:22] now don't be conformed to the world
[1:27:25] right conform think of like Plato right
[1:27:28] you push if you push something on
[1:27:30] Play-Doh on play
[1:27:33] it takes the impression of whatever's
[1:27:35] put on it right
[1:27:36] and Paul is saying look not only don't
[1:27:39] be conformed to the world
[1:27:41] but don't even try to take on outwardly
[1:27:44] just a conforming
[1:27:46] to the doctrines and everything but be
[1:27:48] transformed
[1:27:50] by the renewing of your mind
[1:27:53] that you might prove that good and
[1:27:56] acceptable will of God
[1:27:58] that's that God would dwell inside of us
[1:28:03] that's a real new birth that's a real
[1:28:05] born-again experience so see it's the
[1:28:07] working
[1:28:09] it's the working of the Holy Spirit to
[1:28:11] bring you and I
[1:28:13] fully into the will of God
[1:28:15] let me just say it like this
[1:28:18] uh
[1:28:20] some time ago and I just want to give
[1:28:22] credit where credit do this preachers or
[1:28:23] sometimes some of the biggest thieves
[1:28:24] but just hear something good you want to
[1:28:26] just claim it you know and some some
[1:28:28] years ago I heard brother Jason Watkins
[1:28:29] make a statement with the Holy Ghost I
[1:28:31] thought wow that's tremendous I just
[1:28:33] like how the placement of the words the
[1:28:35] Holy Spirit has come
[1:28:37] and you've been brought
[1:28:40] into cooperation with the vision
[1:28:43] so what the quickening power what the
[1:28:45] new birth does it brings you into
[1:28:47] cooperation with the vision
[1:28:51] God already has the vision laid out and
[1:28:53] we are working in cooperation with it
[1:28:56] now we know within that cooperation see
[1:28:58] to bring us in cooperation it isn't that
[1:29:00] we become dolls like this you know like
[1:29:02] Pinocchio
[1:29:05] no we know we've got a battle
[1:29:07] right we've got a battle but what gives
[1:29:09] us strength the the Lord is the strength
[1:29:12] of my life
[1:29:13] and I'm feeding on that right there and
[1:29:16] it's just growing stronger and giving me
[1:29:18] strength to subdue when this old guy
[1:29:20] wants to get
[1:29:23] well we'll leave him alone just for a
[1:29:25] little bit
[1:29:26] so here we have this notice how brother
[1:29:28] Brown would make this statement in
[1:29:30] Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[1:29:33] ah I just
[1:29:35] he's bringing it down into what the new
[1:29:38] birth is he says I want you to listen to
[1:29:41] this statement here he says Christ in
[1:29:42] you makes him the center of life of the
[1:29:45] rest of the Revelation those Christ in
[1:29:48] you makes him Christ's life in you makes
[1:29:51] him the center of the Revelation Christ
[1:29:54] in you makes you the complete revelation
[1:29:58] of the whole thing of what God is trying
[1:30:01] to do notice what does that not I make
[1:30:03] it Christ in you Christ in me makes
[1:30:09] the complete revelation of the whole
[1:30:11] thing
[1:30:12] Glory so he says is this coming down he
[1:30:15] says now what is the new birth then well
[1:30:18] brother Brandon what is the new birth
[1:30:19] it's the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:30:22] personally to you
[1:30:24] not you join the church
[1:30:27] shook ahead done something different set
[1:30:30] of cream promised to live by a code of
[1:30:33] rules and I don't want to just I'm not
[1:30:36] adding to the word but I want to just
[1:30:37] add this it's not even saying I believe
[1:30:39] brother Brown is a prophet
[1:30:41] or I believe this message is the truth
[1:30:43] it's not that's not the New Birth the
[1:30:46] new birth it's new life it's a new
[1:30:48] beginning it's a new creation
[1:30:51] now I agree there has to come the
[1:30:54] reality because you have to hear the
[1:30:56] call back to your inheritance and that's
[1:30:58] why God has sent the message
[1:31:00] amen God has not come to call us to a
[1:31:03] church call us to a program call us to a
[1:31:05] Creed call us straight God has come to
[1:31:08] call you and I to himself
[1:31:12] that's the word of reconciliation
[1:31:15] to reconcile God and man as one
[1:31:21] glory be to God notice he said and when
[1:31:25] Christ is being revealed he is the word
[1:31:27] and when the word is revealed it
[1:31:31] expresses itself
[1:31:34] so it's it's not oh I'm gonna let this
[1:31:37] word be expressed no when it's revealed
[1:31:40] it
[1:31:41] expresses itself
[1:31:44] in other words God says thank you for
[1:31:47] your picture frame
[1:31:49] I'll take over from here
[1:31:53] but Lord my picture frames got old
[1:31:55] trimming on the outside that's okay I'm
[1:31:58] no I want him to know that I can be
[1:31:59] displayed in Cherrywood Oakwood and
[1:32:01] Maplewood and remind my Lord but mine
[1:32:04] has you know it has like a red matting
[1:32:06] around it that's okay I like to be
[1:32:07] displayed through red and matting white
[1:32:09] matting green matting but are you
[1:32:11] understanding me now
[1:32:14] God's not interested in the form because
[1:32:17] what matters is when he gets in the form
[1:32:20] it will manifest himself the same
[1:32:23] through the form he's in
[1:32:27] oh glory be to God that was the whole
[1:32:30] purpose he said of Jesus Christ was to
[1:32:32] express himself to take his own laws and
[1:32:36] live by his own laws and fulfill his law
[1:32:38] by death and Christ died in flesh in
[1:32:41] order to condemn sin in the flesh that
[1:32:43] he might bring to himself a glorious
[1:32:45] bride redeemed back that will believe
[1:32:47] only in the word of God and not swap it
[1:32:48] like he did for intellectual conceptions
[1:32:51] of man that's Christ's idea that's God's
[1:32:55] idea the new birth reveals this
[1:33:01] and this is why it's very clear if a man
[1:33:04] says that he's born again I'm quoting a
[1:33:06] prophet but you can see it's very clear
[1:33:07] if a man says he's born again and he'll
[1:33:10] deny a part of the word he ain't born
[1:33:13] again he might be born again according
[1:33:16] to what a church has taught
[1:33:18] but remember churches do not have
[1:33:21] authority over the word
[1:33:23] the real Church of the Living God she is
[1:33:26] his wife
[1:33:27] she submits herself to her head she
[1:33:31] recognizes like Rebecca Saul Isaac and
[1:33:35] said who is this it said that's him that
[1:33:38] I've been telling you about she veiled
[1:33:40] herself and went to meet him
[1:33:46] she was under the headship of the word
[1:33:49] and the bride recognizes his headship
[1:33:52] and that's the only headship that she
[1:33:54] will recognize
[1:33:56] and if she goes to leaning toward any
[1:33:58] other headship she gets in trouble
[1:34:03] right
[1:34:04] example in the prophet's life just that
[1:34:06] little bit with the family we see those
[1:34:07] things but we see also the grace of God
[1:34:09] when that as well
[1:34:11] is that right
[1:34:18] this is why Mark 16 says these signs
[1:34:22] shall follow them that believe I I just
[1:34:24] have to I'm going to read this part of
[1:34:26] it right here he said so it's Christ
[1:34:28] expressing himself
[1:34:30] in the individual
[1:34:32] whether he's intellectual
[1:34:35] or whether he don't even know his ABCs
[1:34:41] and I could you know I could preach we
[1:34:42] could preach this probably in fifth gear
[1:34:44] but I don't want to do that
[1:34:46] I want to speak these things and let by
[1:34:48] the spirit of God that they drop it
[1:34:50] doesn't matter the intellect sometimes
[1:34:53] you know sometimes you I've heard things
[1:34:55] have said oh you know brother Sonia I
[1:34:58] wasn't raised in a message or I wasn't
[1:34:59] this and you know so-and-so was raising
[1:35:01] the message and this and that
[1:35:03] okay but that doesn't take away
[1:35:06] from The Authority that God has given
[1:35:08] you
[1:35:09] are you understanding me my wife was
[1:35:12] raised well maybe she might have been
[1:35:13] raised around it but she has she been in
[1:35:15] it
[1:35:17] when my husband well have they been in
[1:35:18] it because it's a lot different than
[1:35:20] setting on a Pew and being around it and
[1:35:22] it being in you and you being in it a
[1:35:25] lot different
[1:35:26] are you with me
[1:35:28] it don't it it doesn't it doesn't matter
[1:35:30] if a length of time a number of years
[1:35:32] and I know this and I know that and I
[1:35:34] know this and I know that my that that's
[1:35:36] not what matters what matters is it is
[1:35:38] our heart submissive to the Holy Spirit
[1:35:42] is it submissive to the word of God is
[1:35:46] it that same way that when he came that
[1:35:49] was prophesied that I Delight to do thy
[1:35:52] will o God that is within my heart
[1:35:56] so it has nothing to do with whether a
[1:35:58] person's intellectual or not well I
[1:36:00] don't I can't really I can't quote this
[1:36:01] or I can't do that that has nothing to
[1:36:03] do with it
[1:36:04] so that's where you're just able to
[1:36:06] dismiss it it doesn't mean that we don't
[1:36:08] give ourselves to the word but to
[1:36:10] understand giving ourselves to the word
[1:36:12] you could recite chapter after chapter
[1:36:13] and not be giving yourself to the word
[1:36:15] at all
[1:36:16] you can stand up here and spit out
[1:36:18] scriptures left and right quotes and
[1:36:19] everything else and still not be giving
[1:36:21] yourself to the Lord
[1:36:23] come on now and there are too many
[1:36:25] quotes of scriptures I can pull from on
[1:36:26] this right here it's got to be a heart
[1:36:28] that's submitted to God because we do
[1:36:30] not read the word of God that the next
[1:36:32] time I come across
[1:36:35] any while we do it
[1:36:38] we are in the word of God so that our
[1:36:41] lives might be enriched that it might
[1:36:44] become a practical at working in our
[1:36:46] lives
[1:36:49] right that's what the Holy Spirit was
[1:36:51] preaching now it comes back to me what
[1:36:52] brother Trevor is saying my Deuteronomy
[1:36:54] 2 has got your Ephesians 2 and Future
[1:36:56] Three what at the end of the day what's
[1:36:57] what's accomplished
[1:37:01] that's why the word of God's Not for
[1:37:03] debating
[1:37:04] the word of God is meant to be lived
[1:37:07] it's meant to be lived there's no
[1:37:10] greater testimony than a life that's
[1:37:12] lived
[1:37:15] Hallelujah
[1:37:17] glory be to God
[1:37:19] whether notice whether he's intellectual
[1:37:21] or whether he don't know his ABCs
[1:37:26] half the apostles didn't know it
[1:37:33] I'm just quoting here but they knowed
[1:37:35] Christ
[1:37:37] Peter and them couldn't read their name
[1:37:38] on The Box card that ain't supporting
[1:37:40] illiteracy
[1:37:42] it's letting you know they took
[1:37:44] knowledge this is scripture they took
[1:37:46] knowledge these are ignorant and
[1:37:48] unlearned men but the goes on to say
[1:37:51] they knew they had been with Jesus
[1:37:54] that's what matters
[1:37:56] amen not that I've been in a message
[1:37:58] church but have you been with Jesus
[1:38:02] come on now I know this doctor and I'm
[1:38:04] not asking you that I'm asking you have
[1:38:07] you met Jesus
[1:38:11] Hallelujah
[1:38:15] mama mama
[1:38:17] think about this
[1:38:19] Jesus said no man
[1:38:21] lights a candle
[1:38:23] and places it under a bushel
[1:38:25] is that right
[1:38:28] now that was not only being implied to
[1:38:31] you and I that we would have a testimony
[1:38:34] but Jesus is letting you know because
[1:38:37] whatever he's asking you and I and
[1:38:39] expressing to you and I he's letting us
[1:38:41] know this is how he does it
[1:38:44] he doesn't light up your life or my life
[1:38:48] with the new birth and then it's all
[1:38:50] hidden
[1:38:51] no it displays itself
[1:38:55] and you know what he don't have to
[1:38:56] borrow a Candlestick he's already got
[1:38:59] the place reserved because he's Jehovah
[1:39:00] Jireh
[1:39:01] the place where that light is going to
[1:39:03] burn that's your kind of light and it's
[1:39:05] going to reflect itself
[1:39:07] through our lives
[1:39:09] is that right
[1:39:11] therefore
[1:39:12] that's where it's God's light it's it's
[1:39:14] him that's inside of us
[1:39:17] through our surrendered life
[1:39:19] that's what God God wants I probably
[1:39:21] won't be able to get to this this
[1:39:22] morning but that's what he wants our
[1:39:24] temperament
[1:39:27] well brother Samuel I'm trying to escape
[1:39:28] of the of the way that I am well
[1:39:31] if the sin question is not settled then
[1:39:33] yeah you need to escape that but as far
[1:39:35] as escaping your makeup your disposition
[1:39:38] sorry you're not going to escape that
[1:39:40] but you can receive the grace of God to
[1:39:42] rule over it
[1:39:45] because you know what God wants to use
[1:39:47] it
[1:39:54] I remember he won't use anything we
[1:39:55] still got our hands on it
[1:39:58] sometimes you know you go to start
[1:39:59] putting your hands on things again no
[1:40:00] God just takes his hands back
[1:40:03] you know what I feel a little ugly let
[1:40:05] me have my hands on it
[1:40:07] let me put my hands back on it
[1:40:10] right
[1:40:12] that's what God wants is is leading in
[1:40:14] our lives you think take for example
[1:40:15] children in a family
[1:40:19] you have
[1:40:20] even in a family
[1:40:22] the children
[1:40:23] like our like take for example our three
[1:40:25] boys and they since I'm the pastor and
[1:40:27] standing here ministering right now and
[1:40:29] they're part of our family that they
[1:40:32] have the privilege of being used as an
[1:40:33] example
[1:40:39] but I'm not going to call them out
[1:40:41] personally but it's just to say it in
[1:40:42] this way
[1:40:44] there is very much a similarity among
[1:40:48] all three of them but yet there's a
[1:40:49] great difference
[1:40:51] there's a great difference there's a
[1:40:53] great difference even in the approach
[1:40:55] and how that I'm I I work with each of
[1:40:58] them
[1:40:59] because they don't it's not it's not a
[1:41:01] Cookie Cutter Way
[1:41:02] but the same way I need Scripture for
[1:41:04] that I'm glad you asked John 10 he knows
[1:41:06] his Sheep by their character by name
[1:41:10] right
[1:41:11] you remember the one sister oh brother
[1:41:13] Brandon I need to know that I really got
[1:41:14] the Holy Ghost brother Brian I'm just
[1:41:16] I'm all torn about it my brother that
[1:41:17] I'm saying brother just just ask God to
[1:41:19] let me speak in tongues so brother Brown
[1:41:21] said I'll never teach this out because
[1:41:22] I'd have people grasping after the wrong
[1:41:24] thing but he said to help her out well
[1:41:25] he knew she already had it so he said
[1:41:28] God let her speak in tongues why because
[1:41:29] the longer you get she got a place to
[1:41:31] stand
[1:41:34] to stand no doubt later on it's been
[1:41:36] there the whole time
[1:41:37] see God didn't say
[1:41:39] draw the line
[1:41:41] you know nobody whoever draws and red
[1:41:43] lines never go by him anyhow
[1:41:45] right some of you get that but under any
[1:41:47] rate there's things that God don't
[1:41:49] operate in that way
[1:41:51] God don't operate I'm glad he doesn't
[1:41:52] I'm glad I'm glad I'm saying for me and
[1:41:55] for you I'm glad he does it I'm glad
[1:41:58] that God's personal I'm glad that though
[1:42:00] you know brother Dave the way he deals
[1:42:02] with you he deals with you he may not
[1:42:04] deal with me the same way but you know
[1:42:05] what he's my father just as much as you
[1:42:07] are your father
[1:42:09] is that right he knows each of us
[1:42:14] he knows
[1:42:18] hallelujah oh Gloria I wish I had ours
[1:42:21] right now
[1:42:23] don't worry don't get scared
[1:42:26] but individually
[1:42:28] not only is you know look you can look
[1:42:30] at Ben and Paul and Zachary they're
[1:42:33] physical
[1:42:35] you know a little different and things
[1:42:36] like that
[1:42:37] I don't think any of them took after me
[1:42:39] but
[1:42:41] their emotional characteristics you know
[1:42:43] how it is with parents they can
[1:42:51] we know how to
[1:42:54] man never played cards but we know how
[1:42:56] to deal it out
[1:42:57] he got this from you just from
[1:42:59] now that that okay so that part's you
[1:43:01] and
[1:43:05] but yeah
[1:43:07] they shared the same father and mother
[1:43:11] Paul Ben
[1:43:13] exactly share the same father and mother
[1:43:17] and I'd say they're blessed
[1:43:19] it's free
[1:43:22] but I'll tell you and I share the same
[1:43:24] father and mother
[1:43:26] the word is our father and the Holy
[1:43:27] Spirit is our mother
[1:43:30] is that right
[1:43:31] not two separate people but it's the
[1:43:33] same God Condon sending down
[1:43:37] amen
[1:43:39] so
[1:43:40] just to leave it with this here this
[1:43:42] scripture can I have just a couple more
[1:43:43] minutes let me leave this scripture
[1:43:46] I'm dying to get to where I'd like to
[1:43:48] get to with all this but I'm not going
[1:43:49] to and I don't want to rush anything but
[1:43:51] let's just leave it like this in Romans
[1:43:52] 8 29. for whom he did for no he also did
[1:43:56] predestinate
[1:43:57] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:44:01] that he might be the firstborn
[1:44:04] among many brethren
[1:44:10] brother Trevor was really bringing that
[1:44:11] out and pulling it in from Hebrews there
[1:44:15] moreover verse 30 whom he did
[1:44:16] predestinate
[1:44:18] then he also called and whom he called
[1:44:21] them he also Justified so see God
[1:44:23] working all along what's God doing God's
[1:44:25] working
[1:44:26] under that of a finished product
[1:44:30] it's it's finished in the mind of God
[1:44:32] this is just out working
[1:44:34] it's God working it's God unfolding
[1:44:36] himself right and whom he justified them
[1:44:39] he also glorified and brother Brown
[1:44:41] picks this up if you haven't listened to
[1:44:43] the message images of Christ I just
[1:44:45] couldn't get away from that right after
[1:44:46] the services last week and I just went
[1:44:48] into that message begin to just just
[1:44:50] drawn to it with certain things I knew
[1:44:51] brother Brown had mentioned and he's
[1:44:53] dealing with images of Christ and you
[1:44:55] think in this hour that we're living in
[1:44:56] because the term Christian and
[1:44:58] Christianity
[1:45:00] can be thrown around so easily right
[1:45:05] you know you can have things where
[1:45:06] people say oh yeah I've seen this I've
[1:45:08] seen this Sports Talk boy they're
[1:45:09] Christian really how you know that well
[1:45:11] because they were across they don't mean
[1:45:12] anything right
[1:45:13] right well you know they kneel down that
[1:45:15] don't mean anything
[1:45:17] well I know so and so it
[1:45:20] now I will grant you this there's a
[1:45:22] great difference in a Christian and a
[1:45:24] Spirit-filled Christian
[1:45:27] yeah but just because somebody says you
[1:45:29] know God help me score this touchdown
[1:45:31] God you think God cares about a
[1:45:32] touchdown
[1:45:34] God help me with this basketball you
[1:45:36] think God cares about basketball
[1:45:38] you think God cares about oh you know
[1:45:39] God help me get this goal for soccer you
[1:45:42] think if you think God God's wrapped up
[1:45:44] in all of that
[1:45:45] that's when you look at what they're and
[1:45:47] you realize I'm not trying to put
[1:45:48] anybody down but friends listen this age
[1:45:51] has been so under such a deception to
[1:45:54] where it's almost like they said God
[1:45:57] help them do it approved
[1:46:00] right
[1:46:02] but remember there's one setting in the
[1:46:04] temple
[1:46:07] of God
[1:46:10] worship ask God right he's exalted to
[1:46:14] the throne of worship and man Satan
[1:46:16] doesn't care how that he's getting the
[1:46:19] worship
[1:46:20] even if it's coming through God's name
[1:46:25] are under the name of Christianity he
[1:46:28] doesn't care
[1:46:30] how do you know him because he opposeth
[1:46:32] himself to all that is called God
[1:46:38] who that wasn't a notes so many friends
[1:46:41] I wish we stopped back there it's free
[1:46:43] though
[1:46:45] so what is a Christian
[1:46:49] REM said sometimes we limit it to
[1:46:50] joining a church
[1:46:53] is that a Christian because we joined a
[1:46:54] church
[1:46:56] no
[1:46:59] someone who takes up affiliations with
[1:47:01] the church
[1:47:03] but REM said I believe that Christians
[1:47:04] should do that but I don't believe
[1:47:05] that's Christianity
[1:47:07] that's what a Christian does after he
[1:47:09] becomes a Christian
[1:47:12] some say well it's going to church and
[1:47:13] serving Declaration of creed you know I
[1:47:15] promise to raise my right hand and left
[1:47:17] hand and whatever more and promised I
[1:47:19] would do this or I signed the book and I
[1:47:20] I did all this and I'm not making fun of
[1:47:22] those things I'm just trying to say that
[1:47:24] we're here and the duty that I have is
[1:47:27] to preach the truth that has been
[1:47:28] revealed
[1:47:30] those that is ordained to that life will
[1:47:33] come to it
[1:47:34] it won't be me I've never brought it's
[1:47:36] not me bringing anybody it's God himself
[1:47:38] drawing he said if I be lifted up I will
[1:47:41] draw all men unto me not under Samuel
[1:47:45] unto me if I be lifted up right so
[1:47:49] notice loyal to a church no uh maybe
[1:47:52] packing a little something a little
[1:47:53] Cross or a little sign of a Christian
[1:47:55] I'm quoting
[1:47:57] perhaps maybe if they burn a candle or
[1:48:00] some kind of penance
[1:48:02] or they're immersed in water or they do
[1:48:05] some kind of sacrifice or some good to
[1:48:07] the church or they help their neighbor
[1:48:08] they buy some coal for the Widow or some
[1:48:12] shoes for the orphan
[1:48:14] those are all good things right those
[1:48:16] are all good things but that still don't
[1:48:18] deal with the root of the problem
[1:48:21] that's the soul
[1:48:24] purchasing a piece of coal does not
[1:48:26] birth your soul
[1:48:28] helping the Widow across the street does
[1:48:30] not give you a new birth
[1:48:33] right no more than just coming to a
[1:48:36] church
[1:48:38] the new birth is of creation of God
[1:48:41] where a life has died out to themselves
[1:48:47] that's the acts that a Christian should
[1:48:49] do but that doesn't make him a Christian
[1:48:51] well some said you know if you pack an
[1:48:52] image of Christ in your car on your wall
[1:48:54] well that's the sign of a Christian I
[1:48:56] mean maybe you've got the picture in the
[1:48:58] from Houston Coliseum that don't make
[1:49:00] you Christian
[1:49:02] come on now well I've got all the books
[1:49:04] that don't make you a Christian
[1:49:06] getting tight now
[1:49:08] that's not what does it
[1:49:10] I believe there's help there if you can
[1:49:12] recognize that the same one who had his
[1:49:15] picture taken there in Houston Coliseum
[1:49:17] he had his picture taken with us and
[1:49:19] he's here with us
[1:49:22] and his desire was is to dwell inside of
[1:49:26] you and I
[1:49:28] that's why brother Brown could say I
[1:49:30] don't believe being an image of being I
[1:49:32] don't believe that being an image of
[1:49:33] Christ uh I I believe let me I believe
[1:49:36] that being an image of Christ makes you
[1:49:38] a Christian it's not what we do
[1:49:40] outwardly
[1:49:42] it's what happened inwardly now I know
[1:49:44] someone right there you could take that
[1:49:46] and I could become a favorite quote and
[1:49:47] well it don't matter how I dress but
[1:49:49] remember it says it in the word of God
[1:49:52] and if the spirit of God's on the inside
[1:49:54] of here it will not reject anything here
[1:49:58] amen that's a real criteria for a uh
[1:50:01] what the real New Birth is and if that's
[1:50:03] not there you understand when those
[1:50:05] things are ministered in that way you're
[1:50:06] not the holy you know what that is that
[1:50:08] ain't a man trying to get you to conform
[1:50:09] oh don't wear your pants and don't do it
[1:50:11] ain't a man trying to get you to conform
[1:50:13] that's the word of God because on the
[1:50:16] other side there won't be no pants
[1:50:18] wearing
[1:50:19] and there won't be one make it there
[1:50:21] wearing pants
[1:50:24] there won't be one woman going the
[1:50:26] Rapture with pants on
[1:50:29] find it in the Book of Revelations where
[1:50:31] find it see if they were adorned in
[1:50:33] pants they're not adorned in pants
[1:50:37] it's not fair man has made that up
[1:50:40] seminaries and men and backslidden
[1:50:43] preachers false prophets have cut away
[1:50:46] at the word of God to try to do what
[1:50:48] appease the nature in man instead of
[1:50:51] dealing with it and saying you need to
[1:50:53] be born again because if you still got
[1:50:55] those desires you're not going to make
[1:50:58] it
[1:51:00] oh
[1:51:02] oh I won't have a man to rule over me
[1:51:05] like that that's what the scripture said
[1:51:08] when the sun came oh I don't have to do
[1:51:10] that I don't that's true nobody has to
[1:51:12] do that
[1:51:13] but for the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:51:18] for his bride
[1:51:20] she loves to please him
[1:51:24] Hallelujah we love to please him
[1:51:27] that's our desire if there's something
[1:51:29] that's out of line I want to know about
[1:51:30] it I want to know about I want to please
[1:51:33] him
[1:51:34] I want to serve him in every way
[1:51:39] so
[1:51:40] it's not just something I put on
[1:51:42] outwardly
[1:51:44] but it's got to be something inwardly
[1:51:47] and if he's our image and the likeness
[1:51:49] and we are the image and likeness of
[1:51:51] members of his body we should be images
[1:51:53] of him
[1:51:58] let me just skip this on down here he
[1:52:00] says
[1:52:01] then it's not what's reflected the image
[1:52:05] of Christ is not reflected in our church
[1:52:06] joining packing a crucifix or our
[1:52:10] emotions
[1:52:11] but it should be in the living presence
[1:52:13] of the Living God
[1:52:15] that's being reflected through our life
[1:52:21] now
[1:52:22] I'm closing here
[1:52:24] look at the Lord Jesus
[1:52:26] we see the Hoffman's head of Christ
[1:52:28] right
[1:52:31] we see the the Garment
[1:52:34] right that he's wearing we see the beard
[1:52:38] but you see God God's desire was not
[1:52:40] that we would reflect the outward
[1:52:44] God's desire wasn't that well every one
[1:52:47] of us you know we've got to we have to
[1:52:48] have a beard
[1:52:50] I know that sounds very simple but I'm
[1:52:51] reading exactly and sometimes the very
[1:52:54] simplest things because it's not
[1:52:55] something
[1:52:56] that we we don't have to it's not
[1:52:58] something being put on out here
[1:53:00] you and you don't like put-ons I don't
[1:53:01] like put ons right you can tell when
[1:53:03] somebody's a put on
[1:53:05] right
[1:53:06] because when it's put on it can be taken
[1:53:08] off and if you catch it at the wrong
[1:53:09] moment you're like whoa whoa where'd
[1:53:12] that Wolf come from it was beneath there
[1:53:16] see that doesn't mean we have to grow a
[1:53:18] long beard as the artist pictures him
[1:53:20] having and neither does it mean we have
[1:53:22] to grow long hair as the artist pictures
[1:53:23] happening or to wear a robe as he wore
[1:53:25] for we're living in another day
[1:53:27] we don't we we don't necessarily have to
[1:53:29] be that to reflect his we don't have to
[1:53:32] reflect his physical image but we must
[1:53:34] in our souls reflect his Spirit image
[1:53:39] and his manner of life
[1:53:45] I don't believe Christians consist of
[1:53:47] joining churches or Creeds I believe
[1:53:48] it's a reflection of Jesus Christ in a
[1:53:51] human being for we are his members the
[1:53:55] members of his body and we bear
[1:53:58] His image
[1:54:02] now just as you and just as me
[1:54:06] I have hands fingers eyes ears
[1:54:10] used to have hair so forth
[1:54:12] all of these everything even what you
[1:54:14] can't see my heart liver kidneys all
[1:54:17] those things
[1:54:18] all that together works cohesively
[1:54:21] together as a unit
[1:54:23] that I might be displayed
[1:54:26] because you've not really seen the real
[1:54:27] Samuel Browning
[1:54:30] you've only seen
[1:54:32] this right here that displays Samuel
[1:54:35] Browning
[1:54:37] that's what you've seen
[1:54:40] right that's why we're coming back to
[1:54:41] the very point at the beginning the
[1:54:43] message when you hear about somebody's
[1:54:44] name and you realize oh that's the
[1:54:46] person I was thinking about oh Lord what
[1:54:49] was it what was it you're saying oh Lord
[1:54:51] about it's what's been expressed you're
[1:54:55] not saying oh Lord because of their nose
[1:54:56] or their ears or their mouth or their
[1:54:58] you're saying oh no because of the
[1:55:00] character that's been expressed so the
[1:55:03] members of my body
[1:55:06] are the visible part that allows the
[1:55:09] invisible
[1:55:10] to be displayed
[1:55:11] is that right
[1:55:13] what'd you think of this right here
[1:55:15] how many remember the quote brother
[1:55:16] Brown says if I had the spirit of John
[1:55:18] Dillinger
[1:55:21] if I had he said I would you know own
[1:55:22] guns and shoot things up and go rob if I
[1:55:25] had the spirit of Beethoven
[1:55:27] right
[1:55:29] right now here's this one thing and I'm
[1:55:30] stopping here today
[1:55:32] you'll never find him in a quote saying
[1:55:34] if I had the spirit of John Dillinger I
[1:55:37] would dress like him
[1:55:40] I would I would you know I would I would
[1:55:43] you know act just exactly like him no
[1:55:45] the manner of life that would be
[1:55:47] displayed is one who's a bank robber
[1:55:51] I might act a little different than John
[1:55:53] Dillinger but if that spirit is within
[1:55:55] me it's going to be Robin Banks
[1:55:58] the spirit of Beethoven is within me I
[1:56:00] look different than Beethoven I'm living
[1:56:01] in a different time I dress different
[1:56:03] right I don't know where those you know
[1:56:05] them what do they call them you know
[1:56:06] with them big long stockings and
[1:56:08] everything else and you know them wigs
[1:56:10] and things and so no no but if that
[1:56:12] spirit that was in Beethoven was in me
[1:56:14] what would I be doing
[1:56:16] writing music
[1:56:18] now I might be writing maybe sometimes
[1:56:20] you know maybe with some of the music
[1:56:22] and but I'll be writing music right
[1:56:25] I look different
[1:56:28] I might even be a little bit more
[1:56:30] pleasant more of the time than what
[1:56:32] Beethoven was sometimes
[1:56:34] but what comes down to it is is what
[1:56:36] manner of life is on the inside and I
[1:56:38] end with that here this morning the
[1:56:40] working
[1:56:43] of the Oneness of God in our lives
[1:56:46] it's different forms
[1:56:48] it's different personalities
[1:56:50] but it's the same God doing the same
[1:56:52] Works through you and through me and
[1:56:54] let's just stop there
[1:56:56] that's God's
[1:56:58] idea that's God's desire
[1:57:02] God's desire is not you conforming to me
[1:57:06] or me conforming to you God's desire is
[1:57:09] that we be conformed to the image
[1:57:13] of his dear son because there's only one
[1:57:16] to be lifted up and exalted
[1:57:19] and that's the Lord Jesus
[1:57:24] might be different colors different
[1:57:26] forms and so forth remember he changes
[1:57:29] his masks
[1:57:31] but his nature
[1:57:33] is always the same
[1:57:36] glory be to God let's pray Heavenly
[1:57:40] Father
[1:57:43] Lord
[1:57:45] thank you Father for your
[1:57:47] your word this morning Lord
[1:57:51] a little bit Lord I know a little bit of
[1:57:53] a different gear of things and just
[1:57:54] waiting Lord on you and
[1:57:57] Lord just I appreciate father these
[1:58:00] things have just been
[1:58:01] Lord You're So riches we've looked at
[1:58:04] them Lord
[1:58:05] over the time and just Lord as you even
[1:58:08] last week how you spoke that in such a
[1:58:11] way and and just coming down and looking
[1:58:13] at this Lord your desire
[1:58:17] is to come
[1:58:19] and to
[1:58:21] work through
[1:58:22] us Lord Jesus
[1:58:25] to take our lives as vessels
[1:58:28] and to work through US Lord
[1:58:31] but that same manner of life
[1:58:35] is reflected through our lives
[1:58:39] because that's the true Oneness is that
[1:58:41] Lord
[1:58:42] we would be one with you by
[1:58:46] that indwelling of your life in US
[1:58:49] and through that
[1:58:51] that places us
[1:58:53] in the word
[1:58:56] so then it's a word life
[1:58:58] Lord throughout this journey
[1:59:00] there's a lot of dying
[1:59:03] a lot of dying to ourselves
[1:59:05] a lot of Lord letting down
[1:59:08] of our will
[1:59:10] to the will of God
[1:59:12] there's a lot of molding there's a lot
[1:59:14] of shaping
[1:59:16] and Lord we ask you oh God that you
[1:59:19] would just
[1:59:20] Lord
[1:59:22] give us more grace Lord
[1:59:25] more grace Lord is moving in our lives
[1:59:27] God as we would receive that Lord to
[1:59:30] take it in our lives being
[1:59:32] changed and transformed Lord
[1:59:36] pray God here this morning if there's
[1:59:38] one Lord where that Lord is something
[1:59:41] that they can recognize and say
[1:59:43] Lord I want you to have the uppermost
[1:59:46] seed in my life
[1:59:48] I I want you to have that that place I
[1:59:51] don't want you just Lord just let it be
[1:59:53] in my mind or
[1:59:55] where my spirit and that but I I Lord or
[1:59:58] something I do outwardly where I will I
[2:00:00] do the part but
[2:00:01] Lord your desire because that's a
[2:00:04] miserable life your desire it's
[2:00:06] miserable because it's not something
[2:00:08] that's coming from an inward Delight
[2:00:11] it it's it's a law but your desire oh
[2:00:15] God is that your word
[2:00:18] would be so displayed in our lives Lord
[2:00:23] father I pray this morning if there's
[2:00:25] one Lord that
[2:00:27] they can recognize that in humility to
[2:00:29] your word and your presence that they
[2:00:31] could just Lord invite you and say Lord
[2:00:33] that's what I desire Lord I I just Lord
[2:00:36] I lay my life down
[2:00:38] I Lay My will down lord
[2:00:42] father I pray that Lord that you'll move
[2:00:44] Lord I know you will Lord you'll move
[2:00:47] for every sincere heart dear God
[2:00:49] throughout the building Lord here this
[2:00:51] morning hear
[2:00:53] Lord you are veiled in many different
[2:00:56] forms
[2:00:58] Lord
[2:00:59] right here setting Among Us Lord as a
[2:01:01] people of God
[2:01:03] Lord
[2:01:05] I think Lord of even Lord even I can
[2:01:07] look in my own home Lord
[2:01:10] my wife and I Lord
[2:01:12] just just to look at us and yet we're so
[2:01:15] different
[2:01:16] there's things that were like shall she
[2:01:18] can know what I'm thinking and I can
[2:01:20] know if she's going to respond someone
[2:01:21] could ask me if she liked this or she I
[2:01:23] know that I've I've been I've been there
[2:01:25] with her enough I know that I know what
[2:01:27] she I've taken I that's an interest to
[2:01:29] me I know what she enjoys I know what
[2:01:31] she likes and vice versa
[2:01:33] but Lord we're very different
[2:01:36] but yet there's a Oneness that we have
[2:01:40] between us Lord
[2:01:43] and father
[2:01:44] that's just not in the natural marriage
[2:01:47] I'm looking at that Lord in the body of
[2:01:49] Jesus Christ
[2:01:51] that God
[2:01:53] so so different but yet it's the same
[2:01:56] God working the Lord
[2:01:59] and that's the Lord this morning that's
[2:02:00] what we want to be sure of and that's
[2:02:02] what we want to Lord surrender ourselves
[2:02:04] too that's what we want to yield to we
[2:02:06] want to yield to the Holy Spirit Lord
[2:02:09] because you're not you're not Desiring
[2:02:11] us to try to be like somebody else
[2:02:13] Lord I could pick out anybody's name
[2:02:15] here you're you're not Desiring Lord
[2:02:17] that Lord that brother just wait that he
[2:02:19] would be like brother Samuel you don't
[2:02:21] want that
[2:02:22] you don't want that if you wanted that
[2:02:25] you would have made him up just exactly
[2:02:27] as I'm made up
[2:02:28] you didn't want that and neither did you
[2:02:30] want me being brother Joshua
[2:02:32] you didn't want another sister being of
[2:02:34] another sister I think if there's
[2:02:35] anything that ought to draw Lord in our
[2:02:38] lives this should be to say I just want
[2:02:40] Christ to be reflected in me as he's
[2:02:43] reflected in her or him and who is it
[2:02:46] that we're drawn to Christ
[2:02:49] who is it that we need in one another I
[2:02:51] need Christ in you
[2:02:53] you need Christ in me it's Christ in one
[2:02:56] another it's in the body
[2:02:59] Lord help us I pray
[2:03:03] help us in our own individual part as
[2:03:05] you just started Us in looking at this
[2:03:07] Lord help us father
[2:03:10] help us Lord that we can just continue
[2:03:12] to step aside
[2:03:14] that the image of Jesus Christ
[2:03:16] can be displayed
[2:03:19] granted Lord we pray
[2:03:21] in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[2:03:25] amen
[2:03:28] I'm sorry this morning if it was so
[2:03:30] broke up but I trust he's been able to
[2:03:32] put pieces together
[2:03:34] I always trust that
[2:03:36] sometimes you feel a little bit you know
[2:03:39] the minister sometimes you may feel a
[2:03:41] little bit morally you feel
[2:03:43] like you've done anything but you
[2:03:45] understand that
[2:03:47] it's just it's
[2:03:49] it's something that God would make known
[2:03:52] so real to us and has he even passed by
[2:03:54] our way here last Sunday the way things
[2:03:56] were said
[2:04:00] and I began to even think about the
[2:04:01] previous Sunday we remember we were
[2:04:03] talking about identified gifts of God I
[2:04:04] was talking about those tribes of Israel
[2:04:06] and I said if God give me an opportunity
[2:04:09] and I'm not saying that this is that
[2:04:11] opportunity but to be able to show you
[2:04:13] if you've brought up a problem and you
[2:04:15] put all the 12 tribes
[2:04:17] you'd have 12 different perspectives
[2:04:20] are you hearing me yes but but it would
[2:04:23] be one heart and that one heart is is
[2:04:25] that
[2:04:26] they want God to be glorified
[2:04:29] but it would be 12.
[2:04:31] because why every one of them were
[2:04:34] different
[2:04:35] every one of those tribes were different
[2:04:38] is that right
[2:04:39] God even positioned them differently in
[2:04:41] the land one was a corn razor
[2:04:44] one God put their feet in oil
[2:04:47] some were great you know with the
[2:04:49] pastries and things that God has all
[2:04:51] that they were all set up so differently
[2:04:53] so you mean to tell me if you brought
[2:04:54] all of them to a table and sat down that
[2:04:56] they would all maybe come at it
[2:04:58] though they maybe wouldn't all come at
[2:04:59] it the exact same way it's think of
[2:05:01] think of it like this think about how
[2:05:02] God has such a diversity let's just
[2:05:04] leave it like this of the ministry and
[2:05:06] the body
[2:05:07] I mean like brother Trevor last week I
[2:05:09] couldn't even think of questions to ask
[2:05:10] like that that
[2:05:12] but he's been able to surrender himself
[2:05:14] to the Lord and that gift in his life
[2:05:16] and God uses it that way
[2:05:19] different perspective or different
[2:05:21] approach but it's the same after the
[2:05:22] same goal
[2:05:24] you see it now it's it's same it's
[2:05:26] coming but it's the same goal and that's
[2:05:28] why that God's not interested that
[2:05:30] everything he's not trying to make us
[2:05:32] all all that we're all like that's not
[2:05:34] the Oneness the Oneness of God is that
[2:05:35] he would be in us we in him
[2:05:38] and then we're part of the same body
[2:05:41] and God uses
[2:05:43] the uniqueness the differences
[2:05:46] the things about us like you said little
[2:05:48] Aaron regarding you
[2:05:50] he wants to be Aaron
[2:05:52] but he wants to be Aaron as Jesus would
[2:05:55] be Aaron
[2:05:57] and you can put your name in I can put
[2:05:59] my name in there that's how he wants to
[2:06:01] be and I think the greatest thing we
[2:06:02] could say is his Lord I'll just say for
[2:06:04] me Lord
[2:06:05] be Samuel how you would be Samuel
[2:06:08] but anybody want to join me too
[2:06:10] Lord and you put your name there right
[2:06:13] be Rey as you would be Ray Lord be be
[2:06:16] Stephen as you'd be Stephen Lord I want
[2:06:18] you to be Samuel as you'd be Samuel
[2:06:19] that's what I want you to be in other
[2:06:21] words you know what you're saying you're
[2:06:22] welcome I want you to feel at home
[2:06:25] I I I'm taking everything off in other
[2:06:28] words Jesus you don't have to just come
[2:06:29] in and stand on the welcome mat
[2:06:31] I'm free to go you want to go in the
[2:06:33] refrigerator go in the refrigerator
[2:06:37] yeah
[2:06:38] right
[2:06:40] I want you to be Jesus
[2:06:43] that's what I want
[2:06:45] be Samuel has Jesus would be saying now
[2:06:47] not as Samuel because Samuel
[2:06:49] Samuel's made a mess out of being Samuel
[2:06:53] but Jesus
[2:06:55] he knows
[2:06:57] he knows
[2:07:01] could we just stand let's just worship
[2:07:03] Him
[2:07:06] go ahead and sing brother Brown let's
[2:07:07] sing what's on your heart
