[49:24] uh it's just something about as i heard
[49:26] brother branham tell us here the other
[49:27] day
[49:28] he takes that scripture out of ephesians
[49:30] 1 he has blessed us together
[49:33] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[49:36] places

[49:38] this he said see together
[49:41] he said we were meant together
[49:44] together amen not to be off on our own

[49:49] together and you know it's something
[49:51] about it that's just so real
[49:53] you know when the love of god has so
[49:55] struck your heart
[49:56] it's just something about it you just
[49:58] you long to be
[50:00] amen where other saints of god are
[50:02] sometimes there's situations there's
[50:04] things that come up we've got different
[50:05] ones that
[50:06] you know anymore in the time we're
[50:08] living in and
[50:09] if you hear somebody sick about oh my
[50:11] goodness what do they got
[50:12] they're sick i mean yeah and so we
[50:15] realized that sometimes people deal you
[50:17] know with
[50:18] different things that come up but i'm so
[50:20] thankful that the stabilizers are put on
[50:22] the ship aren't you
[50:24] amen i'm glad that god is in control
[50:27] amen and he's he's directing he's
[50:29] directing
[50:30] every part of this amen for his glory
[50:33] amen so we just
[50:34] we're just so happy to be gathered
[50:36] together here
[50:38] this morning um let's just turn our
[50:40] attention here to the word of the lord
[50:43] um in colossians i'd like to go there
[50:46] first and
[50:46] in colossians chapter one we want to
[50:49] pull that
[50:51] in verse 12.
[50:55] amen
[51:02] bobby sister michelle god bless you it's
[51:03] good to see you
[51:05] amen i know greg and sister suzanne
[51:07] you've
[51:08] all had a quite a process but
[51:11] god is so good at me amen so good
[51:15] so let's just look here into the word
[51:21] and verse verse 12
[51:24] giving thanks unto the father
[51:28] which hath made us meet
[51:31] to be partakers of the inheritance
[51:35] of the saints in light
[51:38] who hath delivered us from the power of
[51:42] darkness and hath translated us
[51:46] into the kingdom of his dear son
[51:51] in whom we have redemption
[51:54] through his blood even the forgiveness
[51:58] of sins amen may god bless you bless the
[52:01] reading of the word as you're being
[52:02] seated
[52:05] we want to continue to just looking at
[52:07] this
[52:09] the redemption of sons and daughters of
[52:11] god
[52:13] and we see this scripture
[52:17] giving thanks unto the father who have
[52:19] made us meet and that
[52:21] that whole part made us meet
[52:25] is that now he is the one who has
[52:28] qualified us we are qualified then
[52:32] to be partakers of the inheritance of
[52:36] the saints in light
[52:38] qualified is to make us
[52:41] bringing us into a place to now where we
[52:44] can actually be
[52:46] a partaker of the inheritance
[52:49] that always belong to us as sons and
[52:52] daughters of god
[52:54] and when you look at the the just the
[52:56] few scriptures that we have read here
[52:59] in the opening of our text you recognize
[53:02] that this as it says giving thanks unto
[53:05] the father
[53:06] we realize that by the grace of god in
[53:09] the
[53:09] evening light that has come to us that
[53:12] we're not speaking of
[53:14] three different people we're not
[53:16] speaking of
[53:17] two different people but we recognize
[53:20] that it was the father
[53:22] above us then when as he came down and
[53:25] he stepped
[53:26] in the body that he created
[53:29] in order to redeem you and i through
[53:32] that body
[53:34] it was now god with us
[53:37] and then after he ascended
[53:40] he come back in the form of the holy
[53:42] ghost and it is now god
[53:44] in us this is why
[53:47] when romans 8 is a scripture to the
[53:50] heart of a believer
[53:52] that says who can lay any charge to
[53:56] god's elect
[53:57] it is god who justified
[54:01] so we we've not been not by
[54:05] another person or someone different but
[54:07] it is
[54:08] god himself and he is
[54:11] the word when you think of the word or
[54:13] if i
[54:14] speak of those things this morning don't
[54:16] think of the word
[54:17] as the letter the word is the person of
[54:21] jesus christ himself
[54:22] it is god and we know that without
[54:26] coming back into john 1
[54:28] but it is true that the word so it is
[54:31] the word itself and we see
[54:33] in this in verse 13 notice he
[54:36] qualified us to be partakers of the
[54:39] inheritance of the saints and light
[54:41] who hath delivered us from the power of
[54:44] darkness
[54:45] so before there can be a translating
[54:48] there must come a deliverance of the
[54:52] hold of darkness that's a whole process
[54:56] of where the evil spirit that would want
[54:59] to hold over a person and say
[55:01] wait wait wait wait wait or that of the
[55:04] darkness that could be
[55:06] even around them and there's habits and
[55:08] everything else still
[55:09] in the life but there is delivering
[55:12] power
[55:13] in the blood of the one
[55:16] who hath called you unto himself there's
[55:20] power to bring deliverance and
[55:23] now from deliverance then he translates
[55:26] us now
[55:27] this translating there's no one a man
[55:30] can do this for us
[55:32] it takes the work of the living god
[55:36] to bring us from where we are to where
[55:38] we need to be
[55:39] and you know what's powerful is that you
[55:41] can sit right in your seat
[55:43] and right while the word is taking place
[55:46] all of this
[55:47] can happen right there
[55:51] it's all how god deals sovereignly with
[55:53] each and every person what i'm saying is
[55:55] that translating is not a new church or
[55:59] that translating is not
[56:00] uh it's not something that's out here
[56:03] but that translating is to where
[56:05] that the holy spirit to where god has so
[56:08] moved in that life to where now that
[56:11] life has
[56:12] moved into a place in god to where
[56:16] it is as paul would write christ who is
[56:19] our life
[56:20] we are dead and our lives are
[56:23] hidden in god through christ that's the
[56:26] sovereign work
[56:27] of almighty god and you know the works
[56:29] that god
[56:30] does as it says in the book of
[56:32] ecclesiastes his works
[56:34] stand his works testify
[56:37] of themselves and you see
[56:40] this is there in the scripture when we
[56:42] speak of this uh
[56:45] inheritance that we have and i want to
[56:47] be looking at that term here
[56:49] this morning of inheritance and here in
[56:52] ephesians 1
[56:53] verse 11 paul would write in whom
[56:57] also we have obtained
[57:00] an inheritance being predestinated
[57:04] according to the purpose of him who
[57:06] worketh all things
[57:08] after the council of his own will
[57:11] that we should be to the praise
[57:15] of his glory who first
[57:18] trusted in christ i don't care
[57:21] how you read it in the scripture you can
[57:24] never
[57:24] read into the scripture and see the real
[57:27] redeeming work
[57:29] of the lord jesus christ and take any
[57:31] credit for it in your life
[57:33] the only thing you can say is it's him
[57:37] it's him it's what he started in my life
[57:40] he's the one that gave me strength when
[57:43] i fell down when i felt discouraged
[57:45] he encouraged me it's all
[57:48] him it's his work this is where paul
[57:53] could bring it
[57:53] into such a place in the ephesians uh
[57:57] uh letter that we are his workmanship
[58:01] created in christ jesus unto good works
[58:04] now brother branham takes this here and
[58:07] in the adoption
[58:08] series he's working with this
[58:10] inheritance that lays
[58:12] that is that that lays or that is for us
[58:16] and he says look he has predestinated us
[58:18] unto this inheritance
[58:20] if i'm a right inheritance of something
[58:24] if god is knocking at my heart and
[58:27] saying william branham i called you a
[58:30] long time ago
[58:31] before the foundation of the world to
[58:34] preach the gospel
[58:35] i have an inheritance and inheritance
[58:39] of eternal life god
[58:42] sent jesus to make that inheritance
[58:46] real to me because there was nothing
[58:50] i could do to inherit it it was blank
[58:54] it was valid there's nothing i could do
[58:56] but in the fullness of time
[58:58] god sent in his own good time jesus
[59:02] the lamb slain from the foundation of
[59:04] the world
[59:05] his blood was shed that i might
[59:08] go to my inheritance to be what
[59:11] what inheritance the sonship to be
[59:15] a son of god
[59:18] hallelujah an inheritance is what
[59:21] always belonged to you this is why
[59:26] when the scriptures when we see we see
[59:28] clearly and brother bannon picks this up
[59:30] jesus never gave me an inheritance
[59:34] he said my inheritance was first
[59:39] but god sent jesus god came down
[59:43] and he made that inheritance real
[59:46] to you and me hallelujah that
[59:49] inheritance that we would be the word we
[59:52] could
[59:52] see that clear back in the time of
[59:54] jeremiah sealed in an earthen vessel we
[59:56] can see that
[59:57] there is a promise that there are
[1:00:00] children of god
[1:00:01] that are going to come back into this
[1:00:03] expression
[1:00:04] back into that reality of a real
[1:00:07] son and daughter of god that's our
[1:00:09] inheritance let me just say this
[1:00:11] when that as it rings out in our heart
[1:00:14] you
[1:00:15] have a right it's god ministering to you
[1:00:17] and i
[1:00:18] this is your right amen
[1:00:23] hallelujah brother branham would say it
[1:00:26] like this and deity of jesus christ
[1:00:28] he said the devil is trying to make you
[1:00:30] think
[1:00:31] you're some trodden down something
[1:00:34] but you're not your sons and daughters
[1:00:37] of god
[1:00:38] [Applause]
[1:00:40] it's the devil trying to make you feel
[1:00:43] that way
[1:00:43] think that way but let me tell you the
[1:00:45] word will always come
[1:00:47] it'll deal with issues in our life but
[1:00:50] it
[1:00:50] comes to cut away and to lift up
[1:00:54] that life in the liberty that belongs to
[1:00:58] them
[1:00:58] as sons and daughters of god that's the
[1:01:00] real work of redemption
[1:01:04] you see this is where our inheritance
[1:01:07] here
[1:01:07] if you want to see the will being opened
[1:01:10] we read that last week
[1:01:11] in isaiah 53 who hath believed
[1:01:14] our will the inheritance that is whoever
[1:01:17] believed
[1:01:18] our report
[1:01:21] to whom is the arm of the lord reveal
[1:01:23] the report
[1:01:24] is sure in john 14
[1:01:28] 6 jesus said i am the way
[1:01:31] the truth and the life no man cometh
[1:01:35] unto the father
[1:01:36] but by me
[1:01:40] in hebrews 7 22 by so much
[1:01:44] notice how paul paul would pick this out
[1:01:46] by so much
[1:01:47] was jesus made a surety of a better
[1:01:51] testament and they were truly many
[1:01:54] priests because
[1:01:55] they were not suffered to continue by
[1:01:58] reason of death
[1:01:59] you see every one of those priests they
[1:02:01] would live to a certain place
[1:02:03] and then they died and then here another
[1:02:06] one would come they would die
[1:02:07] it spoke even of that death that was
[1:02:11] coming to them
[1:02:12] that the true had not come yet
[1:02:15] that was only a time of the anatype
[1:02:19] that would come he who is our
[1:02:22] true high priest and you and i
[1:02:26] needed this high priest we needed
[1:02:30] god to become our high priest
[1:02:34] without him becoming our high priest
[1:02:36] there's no way
[1:02:37] that we could get back to god but
[1:02:40] god oh glory be to god to become a high
[1:02:43] priest
[1:02:44] is one who was willing to release and
[1:02:48] stand
[1:02:48] in the gap for you and me it's one who
[1:02:52] was willing to say
[1:02:53] i forsake everything else and i do
[1:02:56] everything that my brethren
[1:02:58] might obtain the inheritance
[1:03:01] it's one who is a servant
[1:03:05] and if that is the life that brought
[1:03:08] that came
[1:03:08] down was a life of service so much that
[1:03:11] jesus could say
[1:03:12] the son of man he came not to be served
[1:03:15] but to serve
[1:03:16] if that life if it moved in the groom
[1:03:18] that way
[1:03:19] it will also move in the bright body
[1:03:22] that way
[1:03:23] that it is not us serving our own will
[1:03:25] but we seek to serve
[1:03:27] the will of almighty god
[1:03:30] hallelujah oh my
[1:03:34] but this man verse 24 oh i love that
[1:03:38] but this man because he continueth ever
[1:03:41] hath and unchangeable priesthood
[1:03:46] he's made a priest after the power of an
[1:03:48] endless life
[1:03:51] the devil tried he tried to stop it you
[1:03:54] couldn't stop it
[1:03:57] hey the body was put to death but you
[1:03:59] can't kill god
[1:04:01] but that was all part of the mystery
[1:04:04] there had to be
[1:04:05] a purchase prize that was made
[1:04:08] to settle the debt but once the debt was
[1:04:12] paid
[1:04:15] hallelujah since deposited
[1:04:18] put back up on the one who's the
[1:04:20] instigator
[1:04:21] of it in the very beginning then he rose
[1:04:23] up on that easter morning
[1:04:25] brother he rose up in victory as the
[1:04:28] mighty conqueror
[1:04:29] he had overcome what was here in this
[1:04:32] realm
[1:04:32] and he went down into the lowest realms
[1:04:35] and he overcame
[1:04:37] what does that say if he is in you you
[1:04:40] are more than a match for the devil
[1:04:44] greater is he that is in you this
[1:04:47] is where the reality of a son and
[1:04:49] daughter of god
[1:04:50] it doesn't matter what realms are all
[1:04:52] around them
[1:04:53] it doesn't matter what realm that
[1:04:55] they're facing there is one
[1:04:57] who has already overcome in every realm
[1:05:01] [Applause]
[1:05:04] greater is he that's in you
[1:05:09] this is the promise of this hour that
[1:05:12] the word would be
[1:05:13] manifested in every realm
[1:05:18] hallelujah glory be to god
[1:05:22] hallelujah wherefore
[1:05:25] he is able can i have a little bit more
[1:05:27] paul
[1:05:28] give me a little more here number one
[1:05:31] wherefore he is able
[1:05:33] also to save them
[1:05:36] to the uttermost that come unto
[1:05:39] god by him seeing he ever
[1:05:43] liveth to make intercession for them i
[1:05:45] like this
[1:05:47] he's able to save to the uttermost this
[1:05:50] word uttermost means
[1:05:51] perfection he's able to bring to a
[1:05:54] complete work
[1:05:57] it's that which is no longer you holding
[1:06:00] on
[1:06:00] but it's him holding you notice this
[1:06:04] comes that come unto god by
[1:06:07] him he's the word seeing he ever liveth
[1:06:11] to make intercession for them
[1:06:13] that's pretty powerful he already made
[1:06:17] intercession
[1:06:18] for you and i yeah intercession was made
[1:06:22] clear back before the foundation of the
[1:06:24] world jesus echoed that prayer of
[1:06:26] intercession in john 17.
[1:06:29] and that intercession is still
[1:06:32] going forth even as the word is being
[1:06:36] ministered and the spirit of god dealing
[1:06:39] with ministers hearts brothers and
[1:06:41] sisters hearts that listen this is why
[1:06:43] when the scripture says
[1:06:44] we are to pray for the perfection of
[1:06:47] others it's not talking about we're
[1:06:48] going to no longer make a mistake i know
[1:06:50] we're not talking about that
[1:06:51] we're talking about the perfection of
[1:06:53] the soul
[1:06:55] because it must be god to come it's got
[1:06:58] to be god to work on that life
[1:07:00] it takes god working on that life and
[1:07:02] god to bring it all the way
[1:07:04] this is why through the scriptures and
[1:07:06] we see that we're
[1:07:07] we're not people who's ignorant and
[1:07:09] walking around and just pretending hey
[1:07:11] listen we're to be mindful we're to be
[1:07:13] in prayer
[1:07:14] and to recognize that if someone is not
[1:07:16] where they should be
[1:07:17] we regard that and say god that you
[1:07:20] would move for them lord
[1:07:21] bring them into this glory lord that
[1:07:24] what you have revealed in my life oh god
[1:07:26] what it will mean to them lord
[1:07:30] that standing as a priest
[1:07:34] of god
[1:07:37] now the scripture as it speaks of that
[1:07:40] intercession
[1:07:42] paul would write throughout
[1:07:46] of of christ as our high priest
[1:07:50] and he remember he had become a high
[1:07:53] priest
[1:07:55] that as a priest would come into a place
[1:07:58] they they come
[1:07:59] in or they're ordained for men in order
[1:08:01] to offer things
[1:08:03] uh pertaining to god and and paul would
[1:08:06] write
[1:08:06] in this manner who can have compassion
[1:08:10] on the ignorant and on them that are
[1:08:14] out of the way
[1:08:17] i want you to catch this compassion
[1:08:20] because he says
[1:08:21] in that he himself is compassed about
[1:08:24] with infirmity there was no weakness
[1:08:28] in on the inside did jesus experience
[1:08:32] temptation did he experience sickness
[1:08:35] yes
[1:08:37] are you with me so the bible said he was
[1:08:39] tempted in all points such as we are is
[1:08:41] that right
[1:08:42] yeah without sin james says god can't be
[1:08:45] tempted
[1:08:48] so it shows that god part on the inside
[1:08:51] was never tempted god was
[1:08:55] in christ reconciling the world
[1:08:59] unto himself you see this was
[1:09:02] the the very life of the lord jesus
[1:09:04] christ was the
[1:09:06] ringing out and the declaring of the
[1:09:08] inheritance
[1:09:09] this is why he could take the role led
[1:09:12] by the holy spirit
[1:09:14] and announce in that generation in that
[1:09:17] synagogue
[1:09:17] and throughout that i have been anointed
[1:09:21] the spirit of the lord is upon me to
[1:09:24] preach
[1:09:25] to proclaim to announce the acceptable
[1:09:28] year of the lord is on
[1:09:32] it was to announce that liberty has come
[1:09:35] it wasn't liberty according to how the
[1:09:38] church church was looking at it
[1:09:40] the church was looking at well if i can
[1:09:41] just get this on my back if we can just
[1:09:43] get rome on my back they needed more
[1:09:45] than rome off their back
[1:09:48] this world needs more than a change of
[1:09:50] govern of leaders
[1:09:53] it needs a complete transformation
[1:09:57] come on brothers it needs a complete
[1:10:00] change
[1:10:01] and this is exactly where the earth has
[1:10:03] already been brought
[1:10:04] and is going through its stages of
[1:10:06] redemption where god
[1:10:08] called it and repentance was there in
[1:10:10] the days of noah
[1:10:11] and god baptized this earth in the name
[1:10:15] of jesus christ
[1:10:16] then at calvary the blood was shed and
[1:10:18] the blood spilled upon the earth to say
[1:10:21] this always belonged to me i'm coming
[1:10:24] i'm making another step i'm coming back
[1:10:26] to redeem it fully
[1:10:29] that you see that every time god's
[1:10:31] dealing with your life
[1:10:32] he's letting you know not only does he
[1:10:34] love you not only is he interested in
[1:10:36] you he's trying to declare to you
[1:10:38] i want to finish what i started
[1:10:44] let me just tell you he's big enough to
[1:10:47] do it
[1:10:49] he can have compassion on the ignorance
[1:10:56] on the ignorant yeah that's you and me
[1:10:59] i'm not talking about your earthly
[1:11:00] standing i'm talking about your
[1:11:02] stumblings
[1:11:04] and on those who are out of the way that
[1:11:07] have not yet responded to that call
[1:11:09] that have not come across jordan he's
[1:11:12] there as a high priest
[1:11:13] he maketh intercession do you know his
[1:11:17] own life being expressed
[1:11:18] is an intercessory life has he's there
[1:11:22] he has there's an intercessory that is
[1:11:25] being expressed
[1:11:26] because let me say this to you there's
[1:11:27] not one son or daughter of god
[1:11:30] that'll be left behind then let me just
[1:11:32] announce it to the devil
[1:11:34] there's not one son or daughter of god
[1:11:37] that'll miss the rapture
[1:11:40] not one of them because the word of god
[1:11:44] is sure
[1:11:46] [Applause]
[1:11:49] not one son or daughter amen oh my
[1:11:53] because we're making preparation for
[1:11:55] that great translation event
[1:11:58] i don't want to miss it for the world do
[1:12:00] you
[1:12:02] notice hebrews 9 11 but christ being
[1:12:05] coming high priest of good things to
[1:12:07] come by a greater and more perfect
[1:12:09] tabernacle
[1:12:10] not made with hands that is to say not
[1:12:11] of this building neither by the blood of
[1:12:14] goats and calves but by his own blood he
[1:12:17] entered in once
[1:12:18] into the holy place having obtained
[1:12:22] eternal redemption for us
[1:12:25] he obtained he entered in for if the
[1:12:29] blood
[1:12:30] of bulls and of goats and the ashes of a
[1:12:32] heifer
[1:12:33] sprinkling the unclean sanctified to the
[1:12:36] purifying of the flesh
[1:12:38] see we're forgiveness what is the
[1:12:40] separation the word
[1:12:42] as it's going forth and that heart would
[1:12:44] respond there's a forgiveness
[1:12:46] but paul's dealing with the blood of
[1:12:49] those
[1:12:50] animals never brought those they
[1:12:53] no forgiveness but they never dealt with
[1:12:55] the real desire
[1:12:57] can't you see that's where the
[1:12:59] denominational churches are
[1:13:00] at they deal with all the grace of god
[1:13:03] all the grace
[1:13:04] of god all the forgiveness of god but
[1:13:05] there's more to it
[1:13:08] there's a place you can go to in god
[1:13:10] where it's no longer just
[1:13:12] looking at it and living a defeated life
[1:13:14] there's a place
[1:13:15] of victory in jesus name
[1:13:19] you want to know how that happened men
[1:13:22] men
[1:13:23] the bible says in jude men of corrupt
[1:13:26] minds
[1:13:28] they didn't come in by the way
[1:13:29] themselves so they don't know how to
[1:13:31] preach the way
[1:13:32] [Music]
[1:13:34] they turn the grace of god into
[1:13:36] lasciviousness
[1:13:38] it's sickness to watch and see the grace
[1:13:40] of god
[1:13:41] as though god's got to swallow their
[1:13:43] field god don't have to swallow filth
[1:13:45] he comes to change he comes to clean up
[1:13:49] he's a sanctifier
[1:13:53] what is it king's religion this is what
[1:13:56] i do
[1:13:57] take it or leave it wow
[1:14:02] but grace is not disgrace grace does
[1:14:05] something about your life
[1:14:07] grace challenges your life to rise
[1:14:19] how much more shall the blood of christ
[1:14:22] oh i love that
[1:14:23] who through the eternal spirit offered
[1:14:26] himself without spot
[1:14:29] to god purge
[1:14:33] your conscience that's your soul from
[1:14:36] dead works to serve the living god
[1:14:39] now you know dead works or not are not
[1:14:42] bad
[1:14:44] paul writes about dead works
[1:14:47] be baptized baptism it's a dead work
[1:14:49] right
[1:14:50] laying on a hand come on now you know of
[1:14:52] bible readers hebrew hebrews 10
[1:14:54] dead works then works are things that
[1:14:57] god calls
[1:14:58] you to do but that in itself doesn't
[1:15:00] change you
[1:15:02] it's in process it's with you it's with
[1:15:05] looking
[1:15:06] faith to the complete transformation but
[1:15:10] you see
[1:15:10] god's desire is not that we would just
[1:15:12] come by dead works
[1:15:14] you must be baptized in the name of the
[1:15:16] lord jesus christ
[1:15:17] when does that become when it comes to
[1:15:19] that place of just a dead works
[1:15:21] where you're resting simply on that
[1:15:24] instead of
[1:15:25] having the rest in your soul
[1:15:28] you must come into the rest
[1:15:31] it's not praise god i was baptized
[1:15:33] that's all there is to it that's a start
[1:15:44] what's the objective it's just like
[1:15:46] every time when i've talked with
[1:15:47] somebody
[1:15:48] getting ready i want to see where people
[1:15:50] are at
[1:15:51] when they're wanting to be baptized
[1:15:54] because i know even in this city it's
[1:15:56] dominated with things of
[1:15:57] works catholicism and everything else
[1:16:00] all through here that water don't save
[1:16:03] nobody
[1:16:04] that water could have went on down the
[1:16:06] street and the fella next door could
[1:16:07] have took a bath in it
[1:16:09] the water don't have any virtue in it
[1:16:12] but the water represents a grave
[1:16:16] when you walk up and be baptized you're
[1:16:18] testifying
[1:16:19] there is a man that has left here he's
[1:16:22] buried
[1:16:26] not put up just in case but this guy is
[1:16:29] dead i testify that i'm no longer the
[1:16:33] same
[1:16:34] there's been a start there's been a turn
[1:16:36] in my life this is why repentance
[1:16:38] and baptism go together amen
[1:16:44] and for this cause verse 15
[1:16:47] but we better get going and for this
[1:16:49] cause he is the mediator
[1:16:51] that's the ratifier that's the one who
[1:16:53] brings
[1:16:54] two to become one he's the mediator
[1:16:58] of the new testament that by means of
[1:17:00] death for the redemption
[1:17:01] of the transgressions that were under
[1:17:03] the first testament
[1:17:04] that they which are called might receive
[1:17:07] the promise
[1:17:08] of eternal life so he took
[1:17:12] everything out of the way
[1:17:16] amen did you hear me he took everything
[1:17:19] out of the way
[1:17:20] brother samuel you don't know about this
[1:17:21] he took it out of the way
[1:17:24] so what are you saying quit letting the
[1:17:26] devil bluff you
[1:17:31] he's already conquered he already took
[1:17:33] it out of the way you have to accept
[1:17:35] what he's already done
[1:17:38] and the greatest honor you can do is to
[1:17:40] believe him
[1:17:41] when you start believing the word goes
[1:17:43] to work
[1:17:45] hallelujah for where a testament is it's
[1:17:48] talking about a will
[1:17:50] there must also be necessity the death
[1:17:53] of the testator
[1:17:55] right somebody left you something you
[1:17:57] can't go claim it right now until they
[1:17:59] die
[1:18:01] right
[1:18:04] you might be hoping but you can't claim
[1:18:06] it till they die
[1:18:08] you might have cleared out your dining
[1:18:10] room i'm going to make red for aunt
[1:18:12] so-and-so
[1:18:12] set you can't claim it until they die
[1:18:17] and you can't claim it unless it's
[1:18:19] already been designated to you
[1:18:24] but after the passing there's a reading
[1:18:26] of the will
[1:18:28] and when the will is read it lets you
[1:18:30] know this is what belongs to you
[1:18:35] this was left for you
[1:18:38] then you've got a right you don't have
[1:18:40] to ask nobody
[1:18:41] you got a right to say i want yes
[1:18:45] what belongs to me in other words
[1:18:48] give me my mountain
[1:18:52] i want what belongs to me
[1:18:55] you're not asking for something that
[1:18:56] don't belong to you
[1:18:58] you're not a fifa robber you're coming
[1:19:00] according to the way of the word
[1:19:04] you've got a right to stand there as a
[1:19:06] son and daughter of god it ain't about
[1:19:08] your righteousness
[1:19:09] it's his righteousness you're not
[1:19:12] standing there
[1:19:12] asking for it because you're worthy
[1:19:15] you're standing there because
[1:19:16] he's worthy and he has made you worthy
[1:19:22] what a compliment to stand there
[1:19:25] a man and say lord jesus i receive
[1:19:28] what belongs to me and the devil said
[1:19:32] there's no way you can have it
[1:19:34] too late it's already
[1:19:37] before the devil was ever the devil
[1:19:40] before there was adam's stardust or
[1:19:43] molecule
[1:19:44] before there was an angel
[1:19:46] [Applause]
[1:19:47] my inheritance was already locked up
[1:19:51] because i was in him
[1:19:55] that's my papa
[1:19:58] hallelujah you couldn't get me out of
[1:20:01] his loins
[1:20:04] the way that he moved down through the
[1:20:06] prophets i was
[1:20:08] there i responded the same way that noah
[1:20:11] responded
[1:20:12] i responded the same way moses responded
[1:20:15] why
[1:20:16] i'm identified by that life of the
[1:20:18] covenant
[1:20:19] coming upon the seed and what does it do
[1:20:22] it causes sons and daughters of god
[1:20:24] to manifest that same dna that's been
[1:20:28] all the way down
[1:20:34] for where a testament is a force after
[1:20:36] men are dead
[1:20:38] otherwise it's no strength at all while
[1:20:39] the testifier liveth
[1:20:41] whereupon neither the first testament
[1:20:44] was dedicated without blood
[1:20:46] so it had to be a testament must be
[1:20:48] dedicated with blood
[1:20:50] he talked about the law when they gave
[1:20:52] the law in the beginning in the law
[1:20:54] and paul goes on to write about it when
[1:20:56] moses had spoken every precept
[1:20:59] to all the people according to the law
[1:21:02] he took the blood
[1:21:03] of calves and of goats with water
[1:21:07] scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled
[1:21:09] both the book
[1:21:11] and all the people now notice
[1:21:14] wow has the word it wasn't just part of
[1:21:17] the word
[1:21:18] but everything that god had
[1:21:22] uttered every bit of it moses held
[1:21:26] nothing back from them
[1:21:30] and that word was declared and after the
[1:21:33] word was
[1:21:34] spoken now came forth the sprinkling of
[1:21:38] the blood
[1:21:39] the token that would join
[1:21:42] the people who responded to the word and
[1:21:46] said
[1:21:46] all that thou has said we
[1:21:50] will do so there had to be a response to
[1:21:53] the word
[1:21:54] now that the word has been responded to
[1:21:57] the blood goes forth
[1:21:58] to sprinkle both the book and
[1:22:02] the people to enjoin them showing
[1:22:05] of what god himself would do through the
[1:22:08] shedding
[1:22:09] of the blood in order for you and i to
[1:22:12] be
[1:22:12] joined back into the word which is our
[1:22:15] inheritance
[1:22:16] it would take that of a life one
[1:22:20] who would be able through that blood
[1:22:22] cell to combat put his hands
[1:22:25] on a holy god and then upon a center
[1:22:28] and he would be able to stand in the gap
[1:22:31] he would be able
[1:22:32] to feel the breach he would be able to
[1:22:34] remove
[1:22:35] the chasm he would be able to bring us
[1:22:38] from where we were
[1:22:39] and couldn't get back he would be able
[1:22:41] to bring us
[1:22:42] in to our inheritance
[1:22:45] [Applause]
[1:22:46] what is our inheritance the word right
[1:22:51] let me just say you are the word
[1:22:55] [Applause]
[1:22:57] you see that there was a fault with the
[1:22:59] first covenant
[1:23:00] the fault with the first covenant is it
[1:23:02] was wrote on stones
[1:23:04] and it was on the outside but god said
[1:23:07] i'm making another a new covenant
[1:23:11] this ain't a covenant that man makes
[1:23:13] this is a god thing
[1:23:15] this is a god covenant and this covenant
[1:23:18] was displayed in the person of the lord
[1:23:21] jesus christ
[1:23:23] wherein that the word itself was
[1:23:25] embodied there
[1:23:26] in the very fullness let me just say
[1:23:28] this we were in him then
[1:23:30] [Applause]
[1:23:32] we went to calvary in him when he got up
[1:23:36] on that
[1:23:38] when he got up on resurrection morning i
[1:23:40] got up in it
[1:23:43] [Applause]
[1:23:45] let me just say it simple like this
[1:23:47] everybody knows the story of lazarus
[1:23:49] when lazarus went in the grave now i
[1:23:51] don't know how it records from there if
[1:23:53] lazarus had children from then on out
[1:23:55] but when lazarus went in the grave are
[1:23:56] you with me when he went in there
[1:23:59] every one of the seeds that would be
[1:24:01] laying there in his body
[1:24:02] of children that could come remember
[1:24:04] what happened they laid him right there
[1:24:06] in the grave
[1:24:07] when lazarus laid there in the grave but
[1:24:09] brother when that came where the voice
[1:24:11] spoke
[1:24:12] and said lazarus come forth let me just
[1:24:14] tell you something
[1:24:15] not only did a man get up but the seed
[1:24:17] that was there
[1:24:19] in him got up also
[1:24:23] hallelujah glory be to god
[1:24:28] hallelujah i was there
[1:24:32] hey i was in my natural father when he
[1:24:35] when he
[1:24:36] cleared back i was in my grandfather
[1:24:39] come on now this is scripture
[1:24:43] when abraham met melchizedek levi
[1:24:46] is credited with paying ties and that
[1:24:50] was his grandpa
[1:24:53] but god was showing no matter what age
[1:24:55] that they meet
[1:24:57] the elect will act the same way when
[1:25:00] they come
[1:25:00] face to face with the world
[1:25:03] [Applause]
[1:25:06] why because there are the loins of god
[1:25:13] oh hallelujah you see it brings us
[1:25:16] across
[1:25:18] of the breach this is why in this hour
[1:25:23] god came in fulfillment
[1:25:26] of malachi 4. it's that the
[1:25:29] earth is to be delivered of a new birth
[1:25:33] let me just say this the church was to
[1:25:36] be delivered
[1:25:37] of a new birth satan still had
[1:25:41] claims on the church
[1:25:44] he could say to the church you ain't
[1:25:46] going nowhere you got my baptism
[1:25:49] come on that's a doctrine of devils
[1:25:52] he said you got my baptism
[1:25:56] there's a lot of other things but you
[1:25:59] see listen
[1:26:00] listen this is god's work god
[1:26:03] there was no god didn't need to bring a
[1:26:05] new deed
[1:26:07] the deed is the word he didn't need to
[1:26:10] bring a new deed
[1:26:11] like you got something you buy a piece
[1:26:13] of property and something you say man

[1:27:41] why this earth
[1:27:42] she's under those nervous prostrations

[1:27:48] the sons of god
[1:27:50] earthquakes in diverse places

[1:28:09] other one to move in
[1:28:16] see it's by a new and living way i have
[1:28:18] to
[1:28:19] let me refer here to this i read this to
[1:28:21] you last week but i want to refer to it
[1:28:23] because i want
[1:28:23] that continuity of thought in hebrews 10
[1:28:26] 19
[1:28:27] having therefore brethren boldness a
[1:28:29] confidence
[1:28:30] to enter into the holiest by the blood
[1:28:33] of jesus
[1:28:36] by a new and living way
[1:28:39] which he hath consecrated for
[1:28:42] us through the veil that is to say his
[1:28:45] flesh
[1:28:47] and he is the word
[1:28:53] people can look for lots of signs they
[1:28:55] can look for things
[1:28:56] oh does it yeah do i see signs in the
[1:28:59] hands or do i see see
[1:29:00] but you see the where the believer for
[1:29:03] the believer
[1:29:05] we he has unveiled to you and i
[1:29:08] in his word amen it's not something that
[1:29:12] you can even
[1:29:13] explain it might be something that gets
[1:29:16] your attention
[1:29:17] of what god does maybe you're in the
[1:29:19] service and something that god does and
[1:29:21] it brings you to where hey there's
[1:29:23] something there there's one here
[1:29:25] that's greater than man there's
[1:29:26] something here there's the god of the
[1:29:28] word
[1:29:29] it's god declaring himself and then that
[1:29:31] same god will come right down for he is
[1:29:33] the word
[1:29:33] and he'll begin to reveal that word and
[1:29:36] in the revealing of that word
[1:29:37] it begins to uncover that life let me
[1:29:39] just tell you something
[1:29:40] when that word when the holy spirit
[1:29:42] comes in that way he's
[1:29:44] not trying to shame you he's trying to
[1:29:47] uncover
[1:29:48] the works of the enemy that wants to
[1:29:51] isolate you
[1:29:52] and hold you back from that promise the
[1:29:55] devil is afraid
[1:29:56] of the holy ghost he knows when the holy
[1:30:01] ghost
[1:30:01] and your heart just stands there
[1:30:03] steadfast and says that's
[1:30:05] my promise that belongs to me and that
[1:30:08] life becoming united with god he knows
[1:30:11] it's no longer you
[1:30:12] but there's a mighty god on the inside
[1:30:15] of your life
[1:30:17] he's afraid of that because then you
[1:30:19] become a tormentor to him
[1:30:23] hallelujah then you've been made the
[1:30:27] head and not the tail
[1:30:28] [Music]
[1:30:32] glory be to god in the highest amendment
[1:30:35] now let me just let me just move here
[1:30:38] the scripture paul as he would pick this
[1:30:41] up
[1:30:42] and it's a spirit of truth i want you
[1:30:44] just to catch that for a moment
[1:30:46] when the lord jesus when he speaks of
[1:30:48] the coming
[1:30:50] the return in the form of the holy ghost
[1:30:53] he calls it
[1:30:54] the comforter i must needs go away
[1:30:58] that the comforter will come
[1:31:02] and then he declares in the same
[1:31:06] uh chapters there i believe it's 16
[1:31:11] when the spirit of truth is come
[1:31:16] he will lead and guide you into all
[1:31:18] truth
[1:31:20] you see the spirit of truth does not
[1:31:22] work in error
[1:31:25] it works in truth manifesting truth
[1:31:29] for he is the truth the life and the way
[1:31:32] he comes to lead you and guides you into
[1:31:35] the truth
[1:31:38] your first birth in my first birth was
[1:31:40] not the truth
[1:31:42] but this new birth this is the truth
[1:31:47] you shall know the truth
[1:31:50] it didn't say it will set you free it
[1:31:52] said it makes you
[1:31:54] free because you're not the old man made
[1:31:57] over
[1:31:58] you're a new man in christ jesus
[1:32:01] it's the holy ghost come to that seed
[1:32:04] that womb
[1:32:05] and it quickens these two have become
[1:32:07] one
[1:32:08] [Applause]

[1:37:17] fire
[1:37:17] amen amen we pray you in christ said be
[1:37:20] you reconciled to god
[1:37:22] for he hath made him to be sin
[1:37:26] for us who knew no sin
[1:37:29] that we might be made
[1:37:33] the righteousness of god in him and we
[1:37:35] can't make ourselves that
[1:37:37] he makes us
[1:37:41] we are his work you see this is the
[1:37:44] workmanship
[1:37:46] of hebrews 1. we referred to that last
[1:37:48] week
[1:37:49] he obtained that inheritance
[1:37:53] a more excellent name
[1:37:56] this is that which is spoken where paul
[1:37:59] would write
[1:38:00] he spoke to the fathers in the prophets
[1:38:04] now in these last days by his son
[1:38:07] whom he hath appointed heir of all
[1:38:09] things
[1:38:10] you see the son he is the word
[1:38:14] it's the spirit of truth coming through
[1:38:16] the word revealing
[1:38:18] the inheritance to the heirs
[1:38:21] it's a it's a word this is why i mean
[1:38:25] i mean what good would it do me to show
[1:38:27] up to oh there's been a passing in the
[1:38:30] hannah family i don't know who it is

[1:39:44] into his word and he begins to speak
[1:39:47] that word
[1:39:48] he begins to come to your heart that is
[1:39:51] god personally
[1:39:55] personally working in that life
[1:40:01] you see it's the ministry of
[1:40:03] reconciliation

[1:47:54] has been in your family tree for years
[1:47:56] this but that ain't the truth
[1:47:59] are you with me when those spies came
[1:48:03] back from across the land
[1:48:05] they said oh there's some big boys over
[1:48:09] there
[1:48:10] big ones man
[1:48:15] joshua and caleb never said you guys are
[1:48:18] a bunch of liars
[1:48:19] there ain't nobody over there a bunch of
[1:48:21] midgets they never said that
[1:48:24] joshua and caleb chose to be occupied
[1:48:28] with the truth
[1:48:32] there's a time when the truth is not the
[1:48:34] truth
[1:48:36] [Music]
[1:48:37] the doctor says you're not going to make
[1:48:39] it well by all medical reports and how
[1:48:42] things are
[1:48:43] that could be the truth but there's
[1:48:46] another report
[1:48:48] there's a truth that's greater than that
[1:48:51] truth
[1:48:52] and that's the truth that i choose to
[1:48:58] believe
[1:49:02] it's a truth it calls us into himself
[1:49:05] [Music]
[1:49:06] it's the inheritance that belongs to us
[1:49:11] where he comes to set us free
[1:49:15] he comes to make real to our lives
[1:49:20] that inheritance he calls us to himself
[1:49:26] and remember brother brown would say
[1:49:27] just like this he said as soon as
[1:49:29] he said that word goes forth
[1:49:33] and i relate it to you i think a week or
[1:49:34] so ago brother ram said it's like a
[1:49:42] and he's letting you know i called you
[1:49:46] he said then he says you in your heart
[1:49:48] you say
[1:49:49] you know what
[1:49:51] [Music]
[1:49:53] i got to make a decision here
[1:49:56] and then when you make a decision you've
[1:49:59] made a
[1:50:00] a start
[1:50:01] [Music]
[1:50:04] brother man says see he says let's steal
[1:50:06] that same
[1:50:11] what's he doing the spirit of truth is
[1:50:14] encouraging you
[1:50:15] in the truth to accept the truth
[1:50:19] to believe the truth
[1:50:25] this is where he calls us by his spirit
[1:50:27] this is why truth itself
[1:50:29] is so much greater than the lie
[1:50:34] then that darkness of that first birth
[1:50:37] the truth is so much greater
[1:50:39] the darkness that encompassed our life
[1:50:42] when truth went forth
[1:50:43] it pierced the darkness
[1:50:48] it let us know this is a potential
[1:50:52] your potential as a son and daughter of
[1:50:54] god
[1:50:57] i know probably many of maybe some of
[1:50:58] you have experienced things like this
[1:51:00] i experienced that even as a school
[1:51:01] teacher i experienced kids when they
[1:51:04] would sit down with me
[1:51:06] you see sometimes they were just a
[1:51:07] little nervous they'd sit down
[1:51:08] one-on-one
[1:51:10] some of the programs they had us doing
[1:51:12] they had to read and read so many words
[1:51:14] per minute
[1:51:16] forgive me i don't mean to be political
[1:51:18] or nothing like that or anything like
[1:51:19] that but i never believed in none of
[1:51:20] that garbage
[1:51:21] anything about how fast you can read it
[1:51:23] can you remember what you read
[1:51:26] sometimes people become so educated they
[1:51:28] become fools
[1:51:32] i had this little girl sitting there
[1:51:34] [Music]
[1:51:37] she said mr brownie she said i ain't a
[1:51:40] good reader
[1:51:42] i said i told you you wanted a good
[1:51:45] reader
[1:51:46] she said well mr browning i never could
[1:51:48] she said read real fast i just
[1:51:49] these many words were many i told her i
[1:51:51] said you've been coming to this table
[1:51:54] and reading to me since we came together
[1:51:57] here in september
[1:51:58] i said let me tell you something a good
[1:52:00] reader ain't about how fast you can read
[1:52:03] i said but every time you've come here i
[1:52:06] said you're not only able to tell me
[1:52:07] what you've read but you're able to make
[1:52:10] connections
[1:52:12] with what you're reading with other
[1:52:14] stories and personal experiences in your
[1:52:16] life
[1:52:18] i said that's what real reading is all
[1:52:20] about
[1:52:22] [Music]
[1:52:25] it was just like something just broke
[1:52:27] [Music]
[1:52:29] what she had thought now maybe there
[1:52:30] wasn't a teacher brother aaron that told
[1:52:31] her that
[1:52:32] it just was you know i can't remember
[1:52:34] and she just felt that way
[1:52:35] it was something about it
[1:52:39] but the moment then i could speak to her
[1:52:42] when that came about
[1:52:43] and addressed that i could have never
[1:52:45] addressed it brother dave if it hadn't
[1:52:47] come out but as soon as it came out
[1:52:50] i could address it with the real truth
[1:52:53] [Music]
[1:52:54] what would it do it would remove her
[1:52:57] from that lie
[1:53:00] that imagination that she had of her own
[1:53:03] self
[1:53:04] it condemned her she carried it with her
[1:53:07] but once that came in she could be
[1:53:09] settled in that
[1:53:12] that's over you could try to say what
[1:53:15] you wanted to say again about
[1:53:17] you can't read that fast don't matter
[1:53:19] [Music]
[1:53:22] that's in the natural that's in the
[1:53:24] natural
[1:53:26] what about our lord jesus
[1:53:29] what about our big brother what about
[1:53:32] our heavenly father
[1:53:35] he would come down and he would make
[1:53:37] known to you and i
[1:53:39] there might be loads you're carrying it
[1:53:41] might be things that you just
[1:53:43] thought about your own self it might be
[1:53:45] sin that you're carrying
[1:53:47] it might be habits you're carrying but
[1:53:49] he come to let you know
[1:53:51] you don't have to carry it no more
[1:53:55] [Music]
[1:53:56] he lets you know put an end to it right
[1:53:59] here
[1:54:01] his is the voice of truth it's not a
[1:54:04] reason
[1:54:05] it's a truth the truth comes
[1:54:08] to set you free now see then what you
[1:54:12] can do is
[1:54:13] instead of now being anchored or
[1:54:16] really not anchored but falling under
[1:54:18] that imagination
[1:54:20] that reasoning walking underneath that
[1:54:23] lie
[1:54:24] [Music]
[1:54:27] you can believe the truth
[1:54:32] you believe the truth the truth goes to
[1:54:35] work
[1:54:40] this truth is not it's not a dull sword
[1:54:44] it's not an antique it ain't something
[1:54:47] we put on the wall
[1:54:48] it's the word of god spoken
[1:54:52] by the holy ghost and that word goes
[1:54:55] forth
[1:54:56] to cut free cut free doubt
[1:54:59] and unbelief what do i do brother samuel
[1:55:04] believe him who speaks to you
[1:55:09] him that speaketh
[1:55:15] glory be to god
[1:55:20] [Music]
[1:55:22] let's pray
[1:55:26] lord jesus
[1:55:37] for every single need
[1:55:41] for each heart for each life lord

[1:55:53] there's not one person
[1:55:54] not one not one

[1:56:07] under condemnation
[1:56:11] the lord the word it comes to speak to
