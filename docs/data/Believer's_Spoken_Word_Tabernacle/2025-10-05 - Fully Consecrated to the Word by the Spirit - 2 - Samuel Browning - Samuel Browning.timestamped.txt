[0:18] God's doing. Amen. I always love hearing
[0:21] testimonies. So looking forward to hear
[0:22] what what God's doing for our brother.
[0:24] Amen.
[0:32] Uh, good morning everybody. Um,
[0:36] this October 15th will mark the second
[0:39] anniversary of my son Benjamin's near
[0:42] fatal car accident.
[0:44] His recovery has been long, painful,
[0:47] traumatizing, and mentally draining, not
[0:50] only for Ben, but also for my wife Jane
[0:54] and me as well.
[0:56] However, I'm happy to report that Ben is
[0:59] completely independent
[1:02] with regard to all of his personal
[1:04] affairs.
[1:05] He has been walking up and down the
[1:07] stairs for about two months. And since
[1:10] early spring, he has been walking around
[1:12] Walmart, Costco, or wherever else my
[1:15] wife does the shopping.
[1:18] He will however need to walk with a cane
[1:21] or some type of assistance as he is
[1:24] crippled because the nerve damage in his
[1:26] left leg and foot were so severe that
[1:29] the damage is permanent.
[1:32] Ben is back behind the wheel of a car.
[1:35] He has been doing all of the driving for
[1:37] my wife when she goes shopping.
[1:40] He is currently shopping for a new car
[1:42] for himself.
[1:44] Despite suffering such incredible
[1:46] trauma, Ben has been able to further his
[1:48] studies in computer science by obtaining
[1:52] specialized licenses which will make him
[1:54] eminently marketable as a software
[1:57] engineer.
[1:58] He's been faithfully going to counseling
[2:00] which has greatly benefited him to
[2:03] process the trauma he's been through and
[2:05] to set goals and manage his life going
[2:08] forward.
[2:10] In closing, during these past two years,
[2:13] many of you have been faithfully
[2:15] reaching out to me to ask how Ben is
[2:18] doing
[2:20] and to remind me that you are praying
[2:22] for him.
[2:25] I want to humbly express my sincere
[2:27] gratitude to you, my dearest brothers
[2:30] and sisters who have been so kind and so
[2:33] loving as to bring my son into the
[2:36] presence of our marvelous God Jehovah
[2:39] Rifa, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:43] My prayer is that this testimony will
[2:45] continue to encourage all of us to pray
[2:48] for one another without ceasing
[2:51] because we know that God answers prayer
[2:54] and changes things.
[2:57] &gt;&gt; And may we also be encouraged by the
[2:59] love and faithfulness of our great God,
[3:02] Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today,
[3:06] and forever. Thank you.
[3:09] [Applause]
[3:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God.
[3:18] How many's glad to hear what God's
[3:20] doing? Amen. Amen.

[47:19] Oh, heavenly father,
[47:22] Lord, as we come into this moment of the
[47:25] service,
[47:27] how we're so thankful, God, just such a
[47:31] wonderful atmosphere, Lord. Wonderful
[47:34] presence, Lord.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. How how thankful, Lord, we can
[47:40] truly utter like it was when David could
[47:43] say, "I was glad
[47:44] &gt;&gt; when they said unto me, let us go into
[47:46] the house of the Lord." And father, how
[47:49] wonderful it is that we're not just
[47:52] called at a certain time of the year as
[47:54] David would express on that pilgrimage,
[47:57] but oh God to think it's even beyond the
[48:01] moments that we're able together on on
[48:04] Lord in the services or midweek and
[48:06] Sunday. But oh God, just to come into
[48:09] your presence, Lord. Oh God, like the
[48:12] little little Shinomite woman when her
[48:15] there were need arose and
[48:18] her husband said, "Well, it's not a new
[48:20] moon. It's not a feast. Why are you
[48:22] going to the prophet?" But she had a
[48:24] need.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we're so thankful, God,
[48:27] that would speak of us in this hour that
[48:30] the provision that is made that we have
[48:33] access
[48:35] through and by the blood of Jesus Christ
[48:38] into the holiest of holies.
[48:41] Lord, that's where we live as and called
[48:45] to live as priests of God. What a
[48:48] privilege it is, Lord. No matter if
[48:50] we're driving down the road, no matter
[48:52] if we're at the job, no matter, Lord,
[48:54] we're walking down the supermarket, no
[48:55] matter where it is. Oh God, we have
[48:58] access to God by one spirit. What a
[49:02] privilege, Lord.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; What a privilege. And it don't have to
[49:05] be a special time, a special day. It
[49:07] doesn't have to be a special moment.
[49:09] You're the love of our lives, Lord. We
[49:12] don't have to wait to a special time.
[49:15] Oh, as David would write, praise waiteth
[49:18] for thee in Zion, oh God. Our hearts,
[49:21] Lord, are filled with thanksgiving.
[49:23] But Lord God, how we are so grateful for
[49:27] these moments that you've given us that
[49:29] we can come and assemble together, not
[49:32] out of a formality, not out of
[49:34] tradition,
[49:35] &gt;&gt; but God, with the desire that knowing
[49:38] that we are we are coming, Lord, into
[49:40] your presence, Lord. We're coming to
[49:42] hear from you, not a man. Lord, we don't
[49:46] we don't need to hear from a man. We
[49:47] need to hear from you. We don't need a
[49:50] man's thoughts or a man's spirit. We
[49:52] need your spirit, Lord. We need your
[49:53] word, oh God. And we're asking, Lord,
[49:56] that you would come, Lord, in a special
[49:58] way, Lord, for every need that is
[50:00] gathered here, Lord, that is behind
[50:02] every uplifted hand, Lord. May you
[50:05] minister, Lord God. I pray your word to
[50:07] our hearts, Lord. And may we leave out
[50:10] of here different,
[50:13] &gt;&gt; different people than when we walked in
[50:15] here, Lord.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; Grant it, Lord, we pray. Thank you,
[50:20] Lord, for all the specials. Thank you
[50:21] for the testimony, Lord, that brother
[50:24] Roco gave, Lord, regarding his son, Ben.
[50:27] How we thank you for your mercies, Lord,
[50:30] God, to know that you are so mindful
[50:33] &gt;&gt; of every single need.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Every need, Lord.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; Even the hairs of our head are numbered,
[50:42] Lord.
[50:44] You're concerned. You know that even if
[50:46] that of a farthing of a of a that of a
[50:48] of a bird would fall to the ground and
[50:51] your prophet would take that and said he
[50:53] would take a a bird that would be
[50:55] thought to be so insignificant but it's
[50:57] to show that God everything matters to
[51:01] God.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; Oh how we love you Lord Jesus.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord God. What a confidence.
[51:08] What a love reaches down into our heart,
[51:10] Lord, that God just draws back to you
[51:14] and said, "Lord, we love you. We
[51:16] appreciate you. Thank you, Lord. Thank
[51:18] you for bringing Brother Brian, Lord,
[51:20] through that surgery there, Lord, just a
[51:23] couple weeks ago." Lord, thank you for
[51:25] bringing him right here with us, Lord.
[51:27] Brother Dave Crest, Lord, thank you,
[51:29] Father, for bringing our brother right
[51:31] here with us, Lord. As brother Brian
[51:33] said, these are prayers that have been
[51:35] answered, oh God. And Lord Jesus, we're
[51:38] asking for your mercy, Lord, going with
[51:41] Sister Maria, Lord, this coming
[51:43] Thursday. Oh God, may you move, Lord,
[51:46] for our sister, guide and direct, Lord,
[51:48] the hands of the Lord, the surgeon,
[51:50] Lord. May you put your hands upon that
[51:53] surgeon's hands, oh God. And may you
[51:55] move down, Lord, I pray, oh God, in that
[51:58] surgery, Lord, and perform, Lord,
[52:00] another miracle, Lord. We pray, Father.
[52:03] Grant it, Lord. We ask it in the name of
[52:06] Jesus Christ.
[52:08] Amen. And amen.
[52:11] Amen.
[52:12] Amen. God bless you. Amen.
[52:16] Could we just turn right into the
[52:17] scriptures this morning? I don't want to
[52:22] take any other time, but I want to go to
[52:25] Leviticus chapter 8. And um
[52:30] if you have a chance to read this
[52:33] chapter
[52:35] um because this is where I'll be
[52:37] spending. We took the last service on it
[52:41] and then I'm going to be spending Lord
[52:42] willing probably a couple more services
[52:45] in here.
[52:46] But I want to draw from this um
[52:51] scripture here in Leviticus 8:es 1
[52:54] through verse 5. And you may want to
[52:56] just keep your Bibles there. So I
[52:57] because I may refer to a few places
[52:59] there in that chapter
[53:02] but this is the installing not only of
[53:05] the um high priest but it's also the
[53:08] priest. So Aaron and his son so it was a
[53:11] whole a process that they would would
[53:14] God would bring them through. Now they
[53:17] were already seen in the vision.
[53:19] Remember when Moses was caught up they
[53:22] were already mentioned and declared in
[53:24] the vision. And I want to say this to
[53:26] you and I, we have already been declared
[53:30] in the vision of the word.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; But in order to get into that place to
[53:35] be manifested, God had to make a way.
[53:40] And there's a process that he's taken us
[53:42] through. Is that right? Amen. So when we
[53:47] speak about being a seed of God, we
[53:49] speak about being a predestinated seed
[53:51] of God. We understand and I know this is
[53:54] very um maybe elementary or very simple
[53:57] but it's not uh a bypassing or an
[54:00] excusing but it's actually the whole
[54:02] process through justification
[54:04] sanctification and baptism of the Holy
[54:06] Ghost is is is delivered with the seed
[54:10] in mind in order to bring us back to
[54:12] God. Are you with me? So it's in order
[54:16] that passing through that process of the
[54:19] spirit of God working in our life to
[54:21] bring us into that place of fellowship
[54:24] with God under the blood. So Leviticus 8
[54:27] and verse one and the Lord spake unto
[54:30] Moses saying take Aaron and his sons
[54:32] with him and the garments and the
[54:35] anointing oil and a bulock for the sin
[54:38] offering and two rams. Now, one of the
[54:41] rams would be for burnt offering, and
[54:43] the next for consecration, and a basket
[54:46] of unleavened bread. And gather thou all
[54:50] the congregation together unto the door
[54:53] of the tabernacle of the congregation. I
[54:56] I don't know about you, but I'm thankful
[54:59] that the door has been revealed to us.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; Cuz remember
[55:05] down in Sodom, there were two messengers
[55:07] that went down to Sodom. And when those
[55:09] two messengers went down to Sodom,
[55:11] remember after they pulled Lot back in
[55:13] the door, the Bible says they on the
[55:16] outside, they staggered, were blinded to
[55:19] even get to the door. And brother
[55:21] Brandham's typing that door with that
[55:24] entrance into the kingdom of God, into
[55:29] the Holy Ghost, because they they're
[55:32] blind. And that's why I remember brother
[55:33] Bram says Billy Graham says I come back
[55:36] into town and how many people came to
[55:38] the altar and then I you you lazy
[55:40] preachers. And brother Bram said it
[55:42] wasn't lazy preachers.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; He said what it is? He said Paul took
[55:45] them all the way.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; So there's got to be a gospel to take us
[55:49] all the way.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Jesus said whoever comes
[55:53] in through through the door comes in by
[55:56] me. I'm the door. I'm the way. I'm the
[55:58] truth. I'm the life. He shall go in and
[56:00] out and find pasture. So I'm I'm very
[56:01] thankful that God has revealed the door.
[56:03] Aren't you?
[56:05] &gt;&gt; Look at the end at the end of the Ladyan
[56:08] age here. Here we stand in this hour and
[56:11] God tells us in the age before that in
[56:13] the Philadelphia I have set before thee
[56:15] an open door. That open door is to come
[56:17] back into full relationship with God.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Not just salvation,
[56:22] &gt;&gt; but to come into full relationship where
[56:24] Christ himself brings about a real
[56:27] transformation in a life. And then here
[56:31] we find in Revelations 4, John was
[56:34] summoned and a voice from heaven said,
[56:36] he said, I looked and there was a door
[56:38] opened in heaven that says, come up
[56:41] hither, John. So all was provided for
[56:44] rapture. There's an open door. There was
[56:46] a place that you and I have been brought
[56:49] into. And I it might just be just a
[56:50] statement within here that I would make,
[56:52] but this is where we come into. We're
[56:55] dwelling in the bright age right now.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the bride age is not a another
[57:00] church age.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; But it is that where God himself has
[57:05] come in bride form.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; It's an entrance into his presence.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; So how thankful we are for the door of
[57:13] the tabernacle of the congregation. And
[57:16] Moses did as the Lord commanded him. And
[57:18] the assembly was gathered together unto
[57:20] the door of the tabernacle of the
[57:22] congregation. And Moses said unto the
[57:25] congregation, "This is the thing which
[57:27] the Lord commanded to be done." May God
[57:29] bless you and bless the reading of the
[57:31] word. As you're being seated,
[57:34] I want to continue to take this thought
[57:37] on being fully consecrated to the word
[57:41] by the spirit.
[57:43] And I want to deal with a a um a part
[57:47] within this here that the the anointing
[57:51] the true
[57:53] baptism of the Holy Ghost follows the
[57:56] blood
[57:58] and you know when we recognize and we
[58:01] can see there's a divine order within
[58:04] scripture. So the Holy Spirit uh brother
[58:08] Brandham would say it like this in the
[58:10] message humble thyself. He said, "He
[58:12] will not put his spirit in an unclean,
[58:15] unholy temple." So, it's got to be a
[58:18] vessel that's been cleansed and cleansed
[58:22] through the blood. And then we know that
[58:25] the anointing is the is that of the
[58:26] spirit. It's the life within the blood.
[58:28] And and I say it in that way because
[58:32] many times this is where that when we
[58:35] look at it that we talk about, well, you
[58:37] need to receive the Holy Ghost. You need
[58:39] to receive the Holy Ghost. And that is
[58:41] true. But the Holy Spirit will not come
[58:44] without there being cleansing.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; A person can come under an anointing and
[58:50] they can feel they can even have you
[58:52] know where uh feel his presence and many
[58:56] times this is where that a person can
[58:59] rely upon sensations, rely upon
[59:01] feelings, rely upon many things and yet
[59:04] not really being able to rely on the
[59:07] word.
[59:09] Right?
[59:10] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? So let's just take a
[59:11] little journey in the scripture here
[59:13] because I want to say it in this way.
[59:14] Satan is always busy about trying to
[59:17] bring confusion because then if he is
[59:19] able to bring confusion then the whole
[59:21] thing is to try to take it away and that
[59:25] objective from the hearts of the people
[59:26] in their lives and I'm talking about
[59:28] even of lives from whether it's our
[59:30] young people to middle to whomever might
[59:32] come that to recognize there is a
[59:35] provided way. How many times you can go
[59:37] through on your app on your phone and
[59:40] pull up in the message of the hour just
[59:41] type in the word way. You'll find
[59:44] countless num God's provided way for
[59:46] this day. God's provided way for
[59:48] healing. God's accepted way. You'll find
[59:49] it over and over. Why? Because the
[59:52] message of the hour is revealing or
[59:55] uncovering that way.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Let me just say this to you. When when I
[1:00:01] was there standing and this just comes
[1:00:03] to me now. When I was standing there
[1:00:06] last year in Arizona when brother Andy
[1:00:08] Schuler took us up there to Eagle Rock
[1:00:11] and we we we had we were going we came
[1:00:14] up and around and then we're up there
[1:00:16] where you you about the time where you
[1:00:18] can see where the the rocks that are of
[1:00:20] the four living creatures there. You
[1:00:22] make this turn and you have to come down
[1:00:24] this way because this path is no longer
[1:00:26] used. And you realize when you get down
[1:00:28] in there in these paths, I started
[1:00:30] looking and I realized that what even
[1:00:34] that rock where it says eagle or it did
[1:00:37] say eagle on it. At one time it was one
[1:00:39] whole rock that had actually come down
[1:00:43] from a earthquake in New Mexico and but
[1:00:46] then through you remember the public
[1:00:49] works projects and things like that like
[1:00:51] the stadium in Sunduski is a public
[1:00:52] works project and I think George is it
[1:00:55] George Daniel Field? I think it's a
[1:00:57] public, in other words, you have
[1:00:58] individuals that during that time, you
[1:01:00] know, of you get into the depression
[1:01:02] area and things like that, they had
[1:01:04] public works, they had work camps. My my
[1:01:05] grandfather was a part of that in
[1:01:07] different in different ways, you know,
[1:01:09] so they could have work. What I'm
[1:01:11] getting to is is that when I looked down
[1:01:13] and I was seeing and I was looking with
[1:01:14] brother Andy, I said, "Brother Andy,
[1:01:16] here I'm seeing where they put
[1:01:18] dynamite." You can actually see where it
[1:01:20] was the dynamite stick was and they blew
[1:01:23] out that area in order to create that
[1:01:26] pathway and that trail. I just got
[1:01:28] beside myself. I said to think that that
[1:01:31] was written inside that rock on white
[1:01:34] eagle the whole time. But my point to
[1:01:36] you and I in this hour is that God God
[1:01:40] there even just showing within that here
[1:01:42] was a path that became open that was
[1:01:45] otherwise not a path and that's what
[1:01:49] listen that's what man and it's not man
[1:01:53] but it is spirits and Satan's desire is
[1:01:57] to block man from the true purpose and
[1:02:02] relationship that God desires where God
[1:02:05] would dwell supremely in man's life.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; And so we understand that that that in
[1:02:12] this this being in the message that God
[1:02:14] has sent to us that the message is the
[1:02:18] revealing of that original path back
[1:02:22] into sunship where they had that
[1:02:25] relationship on the day of Pentecost.
[1:02:29] And then as they came into the first
[1:02:31] church age, there was already a fallen
[1:02:33] woman and the seed went in the ground.
[1:02:35] But God said, "I will restore. I'll
[1:02:39] bring it back to how it originally was."
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Now, as a Bible reader, when you read in
[1:02:45] Revelations 1, we've read this scripture
[1:02:47] very a lot. Revelations 1 verse 5 and
[1:02:50] verse 6. And it says, "Now unto Jesus,
[1:02:53] who loved us and washed us with his own
[1:02:55] blood, and he hath made us kings and
[1:02:57] priests unto his God, right? Unto our
[1:03:01] God." Then you find that same scripture
[1:03:04] repeated back in Revelations 5. And you
[1:03:07] might look and say, "Well, haven't they
[1:03:09] been down through the ages?" Well, God
[1:03:12] has worked in portion down through the
[1:03:14] ages. But coming at the end time, the
[1:03:18] word would come back in full restoration
[1:03:21] for what purpose? For sons and daughters
[1:03:24] of God to come back to full
[1:03:26] manifestation. That's why this age is
[1:03:29] like no other age. This age was the
[1:03:32] promise that God would send his word
[1:03:35] through his prophet. And a prophet is a
[1:03:37] mouthpiece of God. It's a seer that's
[1:03:40] able to see what to see that pathway
[1:03:44] back to the holiest of holies with a
[1:03:47] full relationship with God.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Luther brought us into
[1:03:53] the courts. Wesley Wesley and Pentecost
[1:03:56] took us there into the into the holy
[1:03:58] place. But it was through the message of
[1:04:01] the hour that brought us into the
[1:04:04] holiest of holies
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; because the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:04:09] made way for the person of Christ
[1:04:11] himself.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; So now within that God's desire for us
[1:04:18] to be consecrated to the word by the
[1:04:20] spirit because you might look and say,
[1:04:22] well, you know, how do I become united
[1:04:24] with this? But it's not uh it's not when
[1:04:27] we think of it as far as a letter, but
[1:04:29] the word is a person. And the word is
[1:04:33] Christ. It's God. So how do we become
[1:04:36] united? Because then to where that this
[1:04:40] the Bible that we carry and so cherish
[1:04:42] and so love to where now the God of the
[1:04:45] Bible is living on the inside and now
[1:04:49] our lives are simply being expressed and
[1:04:53] interpreted by the word.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? You don't you don't
[1:04:58] plant you don't get a seed packet and
[1:05:00] you know you see the picture on the
[1:05:01] front and on the back you got a lot of
[1:05:03] writing. Is that right? Right?
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; You got whether you're planting
[1:05:06] maragolds, potatoes, tomatoes or
[1:05:07] whatever. The seeds are in the packet,
[1:05:09] but the writing on the outside lets you
[1:05:12] know the stages of justificate, you
[1:05:14] know, say it lets you know all the
[1:05:16] stages that that seed will go through.
[1:05:18] And the picture on the front is what it
[1:05:21] will look like when it's coming to
[1:05:23] maturity.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; So remember, God already took a picture
[1:05:28] of us before the foundation of the
[1:05:30] world.
[1:05:32] Let me just say it to you like this. As
[1:05:34] Job made provision before his his family
[1:05:38] did one thing, before there was even the
[1:05:40] thought that crossed his mind about per
[1:05:43] adventure they might sin, he he offered
[1:05:45] the burnt offering. He made preparation.
[1:05:48] I'm going to ask you, what was that a
[1:05:50] type of? That was a type of the lamb
[1:05:53] that was slain in the mind of God before
[1:05:55] the foundation of the world. God already
[1:05:59] made provision
[1:06:00] before there ever was a devil.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Before there ever was a sin, God, let me
[1:06:07] just tell you, he's not just two steps
[1:06:09] ahead. He's ahead
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; of the enemy.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; That's why he said when the enemy comes
[1:06:15] in like a flood, I, the spirit of the
[1:06:18] Lord, will raise the standard.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; How does he raise it? He makes his word
[1:06:22] more real. What could be any more real
[1:06:25] than the word not only coming to you,
[1:06:27] that's first, but then drawing you to
[1:06:30] where you come into the word and the
[1:06:32] word is in you.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Then you know what? You become a
[1:06:36] standard.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; So the anointing follows the blood.
[1:06:43] David would say, "Blessed is the man
[1:06:46] whom thou choosest and causeth." We we
[1:06:50] couldn't do it unless he not only he
[1:06:52] would cause us to approach unto thee
[1:06:55] that he may dwell in thy courts. We
[1:06:57] shall be satisfied with the goodness of
[1:06:59] thy house and even of thy holy temple.
[1:07:01] Jesus said, "No man can come to me
[1:07:04] except the father which hath sent me.
[1:07:07] Draw him
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; and I will raise him up at the last
[1:07:11] day."
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; So good.
[1:07:13] Paul would write, "Blessed be the God
[1:07:15] and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
[1:07:17] hath blessed us with all spiritual
[1:07:19] blessings in heavenly places, according
[1:07:22] as he hath chosen us in him before the
[1:07:26] foundation of the world, that we should
[1:07:28] be holy without blame before him in
[1:07:31] love, having predestinated us unto the
[1:07:35] adoption, the placement, taking our
[1:07:37] position as the children by Jesus Christ
[1:07:42] to himself. So it was God come down in
[1:07:46] the form of man Jesus Christ to span the
[1:07:50] breach for you and I
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; according to the good pleasure of his
[1:07:54] will to the praise of the glory of his
[1:07:57] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[1:08:02] in the beloved.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right?
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; That word accepted is key because it's
[1:08:08] not and let me just let me just say it
[1:08:10] and preface it like this. It's it's
[1:08:13] accepting what God has done
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; to believe it and then accept it. That
[1:08:20] all deals with submission of the heart.
[1:08:23] To lay down all all your fears, lay down
[1:08:26] all the thoughts, lay down all the
[1:08:27] wrestlings. like I lay it all down at
[1:08:30] the feet of him that not only uh gave
[1:08:32] himself for me, but he rose up on that
[1:08:35] Easter morning. And not only that, he
[1:08:37] sent back the Holy Ghost. And not only
[1:08:38] that, the Holy Spirit is here to confirm
[1:08:41] that that you are the reason he came.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; You've you don't have to you don't have
[1:08:50] to pay the debt. He already paid it.
[1:08:54] [Music]
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. In whom we have redemption through
[1:09:00] his blood, the forgiveness of sins
[1:09:02] according to the riches of his grace. In
[1:09:05] whom also we have obtained an
[1:09:08] inheritance, being predestinated
[1:09:11] according to the purpose of him who
[1:09:14] workketh all things after the counsel of
[1:09:17] his own will.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; There's not one elect seed of God that
[1:09:22] can escape the counsel of God.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; That is so good. You can
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; let me just say it to you like this.
[1:09:30] Every seed of God is coming.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; There might come a lot of hard knocks
[1:09:36] and a lot of hard things, but let me
[1:09:38] just tell you something. The prophet
[1:09:39] stood on the other side and here came up
[1:09:42] this woman and said, "Our precious
[1:09:43] brother, she was over 90 years old."
[1:09:50] [Applause]
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "They're wrote in my hand
[1:09:53] and no man can pluck them out of my
[1:09:55] hand.
[1:09:58] I want to remind you in that same hand
[1:10:00] is the one that holds the seven stars.
[1:10:02] In that same hand is power and
[1:10:04] authority.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; That we should be verse 12 to the praise
[1:10:16] of his glory. who first trusted in
[1:10:20] Christ and whom you also trusted after
[1:10:24] that you heard the word of truth the
[1:10:27] gospel of your salvation. So it first
[1:10:30] comes with hearing the word of truth
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; or drawn to that of the truth
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; in whom also after that ye believed.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; You were sealed with the Holy Spirit of
[1:10:43] promise.
[1:10:45] So, it wasn't when we believed, it's
[1:10:47] after we believed because the Holy
[1:10:49] Spirit is God recognizing our faith. And
[1:10:53] let me just say it like this. What God
[1:10:55] is actually seeing, he's seeing himself
[1:10:58] on display.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; He's seeing that faith in your life that
[1:11:04] is from him that stands back. And as the
[1:11:08] prophet said, he spoke his word in the
[1:11:10] beginning and believed his own word.
[1:11:14] You say, "Who's responsible for that?"
[1:11:16] God is. But as we will yield to God,
[1:11:20] giving ourselves to God, this word has
[1:11:23] transforming power. This word has within
[1:11:26] it the authority and the ability and the
[1:11:29] willingness to cast away every evil
[1:11:32] spirit, every doubt, every It has the
[1:11:35] ability within it to cleanse us and make
[1:11:38] us fit subjects for the kingdom of God.
[1:11:40] Amen.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Which is the earnest of our
[1:11:45] inheritance unto the redemption of the
[1:11:48] purchased possession unto the praise of
[1:11:51] his glory.
[1:11:54] So the priest, as we were looking at
[1:11:56] this in Leviticus 8, Aaron and his sons
[1:12:01] could not consecrate themselves.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; That's good, right?
[1:12:06] But they had to be willing
[1:12:10] to come God's provided way.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; That's true. They were already spoken of
[1:12:15] in the vision.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; But you see, it's one thing to be able
[1:12:21] to see ourselves in the vision and then
[1:12:23] to realize that the vision must become
[1:12:26] reality.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? It it's let me just
[1:12:30] let me say it's a beautiful thing, a
[1:12:32] necessary thing, important thing to be
[1:12:34] able to see in the word that he died for
[1:12:37] you. That is important. And to be able
[1:12:39] to recognize you are a son of God. Now
[1:12:42] that you recognize you're a son and
[1:12:44] daughter of God, now you can pursue the
[1:12:47] birthright that belongs to you.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Because you can't stumble. We're not
[1:12:54] stumbling into the birthright. We don't
[1:12:56] stumble into the Holy Ghost. It's the
[1:12:58] Holy Spirit himself that is making
[1:13:00] himself known. And we understand this.
[1:13:02] The Holy Spirit is not the second or the
[1:13:04] third person, the Godhead. The Holy
[1:13:06] Spirit is the same almighty God.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's the same God that dwelt
[1:13:13] in the body of the Lord Jesus. Our
[1:13:15] sacrifice is the same Holy Spirit that
[1:13:18] now is coming forth and calling you and
[1:13:20] I in redemption.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:13:25] Praise the Lord.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; God made that way and how that that they
[1:13:30] could come back into that place of a
[1:13:33] full relationship with God. Now, I want
[1:13:35] to just I want to just really tie in on
[1:13:38] this point here in this in a scripture
[1:13:41] in Leviticus 8 and here out of Leviticus
[1:13:45] 8. And then I'll be I'm going to I'll be
[1:13:47] referring and kind of working my way a
[1:13:49] little backwards through Leviticus 8
[1:13:51] here just in this service here this
[1:13:53] morning. But notice where that here they
[1:13:57] were to come before the door and they as
[1:14:00] we covered there a couple weeks ago they
[1:14:03] everything that was needed for them to
[1:14:07] step and be put into service. Let me say
[1:14:10] this. The coming of the Holy Ghost is
[1:14:13] come to put vessels into service.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Service for what?
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; For his will.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; As the Bible opens in Acts 1:1, oh great
[1:14:26] falafilus, all that Jesus began to do
[1:14:30] and teach and the prophet picks it up in
[1:14:31] the token in Jeffersonville and he says,
[1:14:33] "And continues to do."
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; That's good. Because he said, I love how
[1:14:38] he said that his death didn't stop him.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Because the death, the sacrifice only
[1:14:45] releases what's in the blood cell. And
[1:14:47] now what he did in the body of Jesus
[1:14:50] Christ, he is doing the body of
[1:14:53] believers. The works that I do, shall
[1:14:56] you do also.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; What was the works? Oh, you say raising
[1:15:00] the dead. Well, yeah, raising the dead.
[1:15:02] But I want you to understand, the dead
[1:15:04] were raised in the days of Elisha.
[1:15:05] Right?
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me now?
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Well, walking on water. Well, you know,
[1:15:10] an axe head was brought to brought to
[1:15:12] the top under the ministry of Elisha as
[1:15:15] well. What is it? The works that I do
[1:15:17] shall you do also would be that of a
[1:15:20] life that is being lived according to
[1:15:23] the word of God from a heart that where
[1:15:26] the word on the inside there has been a
[1:15:29] uniting and we are harnessed to the
[1:15:31] word. I I'm not talking about just
[1:15:33] carrying the Bible and and and and
[1:15:36] serving God according to our own
[1:15:38] thoughts. No, it it's got to go deeper
[1:15:40] than that. That's why that's why the
[1:15:41] blood was shed. That's why it came down
[1:15:44] to a place that we might be washed
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; from our own way of thinking.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; When Aaron and them came there, they had
[1:15:52] to be stripped.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; They couldn't go in on their same
[1:15:57] garments. You see, there's no measure
[1:15:59] and amount of righteousness.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; That we can ever muster up that is
[1:16:05] accepted.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? You can read the
[1:16:09] Bible 365 days out of the year. You
[1:16:12] cannot measure up to the righteousness
[1:16:15] of God. You must it must must accept it.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; And when you accept it, you submit to
[1:16:21] it.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; They didn't get down there in the water
[1:16:24] and say, "It's all right, Moses. I'll
[1:16:26] wash myself." No, they had to let Moses
[1:16:30] wash them.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; God don't need helpers.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Because you you can't help along the b
[1:16:40] the birth. Remember, brother Bram says,
[1:16:42] if you try to help that chicken while
[1:16:44] it's coming out of the egg, you'll kill
[1:16:45] it,
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; right? You can't you can't pull it out.
[1:16:49] It's got to come out through that
[1:16:50] process. And you know what? Sometimes
[1:16:52] coming out of that egg, God has a
[1:16:54] provided way. on the end of that beak.
[1:16:56] It's got a little little a little hard
[1:16:58] knot. It's there to keep parking. And as
[1:17:00] it's banging like that, the neck muscles
[1:17:02] are are building up. That's the same way
[1:17:04] it is with a child of God coming to a
[1:17:07] real birth with Jesus Christ. Oh, it's
[1:17:10] not something that's handed to us on a
[1:17:12] silver platter, but it's something the
[1:17:14] spirit begins to quicken, begins to
[1:17:16] energize, begins to stir our hearts
[1:17:18] with. Yes, the word is right. Amen to
[1:17:21] the word of God. Amen to the word of
[1:17:23] God. What's happening? faith muscles are
[1:17:26] building to do what? Bring that
[1:17:28] predestinated seed to life and break
[1:17:32] that shell.
[1:17:34] [Applause]
[1:17:37] [Music]
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; So the anointing, it follows the blood.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit, it follows the blood.
[1:17:50] In Leviticus 8, this is jumping a little
[1:17:52] bit ahead. Like I said, I'm going to
[1:17:53] work backwards and come up to this in
[1:17:56] Leviticus 8 and 30. And Moses took of
[1:17:59] the anointing oil. This is after all the
[1:18:02] sacrifices. This is after the wave
[1:18:04] offering. He takes the anointing oil. He
[1:18:08] takes of the anointing oil and of the
[1:18:10] blood. Now, when you read in the first
[1:18:12] part of the chapter, Aaron was anointed
[1:18:15] before there was ever a sacrifice
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; because Aaron was the high priest being
[1:18:20] a type of Christ.
[1:18:23] He was anointed with the oil of gladness
[1:18:26] above thy fellows. He was the anointed
[1:18:29] high priest because he didn't need to
[1:18:31] offer sacrifice for himself. Aaron
[1:18:34] needed a sacrifice for himself.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; It was a type. But now it's coming to
[1:18:40] this of Aaron's sons, which would be
[1:18:42] that of you and I coming into that
[1:18:45] election of God. Everybody with me?
[1:18:48] Right?
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Because when you think think of how God
[1:18:52] said to Israel, "You shall be unto me a
[1:18:55] kingdom of priests in Exodus 19." But
[1:18:58] then Israel,
[1:19:00] they rejected grace
[1:19:03] for law
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; and all of that about them being a
[1:19:07] kingdom of priest. It goes, "If thou
[1:19:09] shalt, if thy will, if thy will." So
[1:19:11] they rejected the grace that had brought
[1:19:13] them so far. And then notice God brings
[1:19:16] out later that out of in that I'm going
[1:19:19] to take that of the tribe of Levi unto
[1:19:22] me to minister a and to minister on
[1:19:25] behalf of the rest. I'm going to take
[1:19:27] that tribe and then even out of the
[1:19:29] tribe of Levi, God takes Aaron and his
[1:19:31] sons. You see, when God does something,
[1:19:36] man can try to argue against it.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; But when God vindicates it, God is
[1:19:42] behind it.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. You understand? A man don't have
[1:19:44] to wrestle for his position. If it's a
[1:19:47] God-given position, he can rest.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Just like in your position as a husband,
[1:19:54] a wife, and on and on. It's a God-given
[1:19:56] position. You don't have to wrestle. You
[1:19:57] don't have to worry. Look at if God gave
[1:19:59] you that job and you believe God gave
[1:20:01] you that job, then just just rebuke the
[1:20:04] enemy and say, "Get out of here, Satan."
[1:20:06] That's trying to torment my mind. Oh,
[1:20:08] they're saying layoffs are coming.
[1:20:09] They're saying this, "Lord, you are my
[1:20:12] provider."
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; I've never seen the righteous forsaken
[1:20:15] or a child of God have to beg for bread.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; See, even when the question came up
[1:20:22] about Aaron, well, what about Aaron?
[1:20:24] Why? Why, you know, why Aaron? Why does
[1:20:26] Aaron have to be the one to go in there?
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; God vindicated it with life,
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; right? Everybody had to bring in a rod
[1:20:34] and they had to write their name on the
[1:20:35] rod. But Aaron's rod
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; was vindicated in the presence of God.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; See, God will always vindicate his word
[1:20:44] in his presence.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? We can have a lot of
[1:20:50] I seen a sign here, a sign here. I want
[1:20:52] to bring them signs under the word.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me now?
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; I want to bring them under the word.
[1:20:58] That that's what I see with the
[1:20:59] prophet's life because we can have a
[1:21:01] sign here and a sign here and a sign
[1:21:02] here. You say, "Brother Samuel, don't we
[1:21:04] follow signs?" No. Signs are to follow
[1:21:07] us.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; Come on. The Bible said, "A wicked and
[1:21:11] adulterous generation seeketh after
[1:21:13] signs." God has provided the greatest
[1:21:16] sign that could ever be provided. I'm
[1:21:18] not just talking about a prophet, but
[1:21:20] I'm talking about the word not only
[1:21:22] coming down and becoming flesh, but now
[1:21:24] that word is inside of you, and your
[1:21:27] life has been changed. You are a super
[1:21:30] sign in this hour. Amen.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Christ himself born in your life. What a
[1:21:37] sign. I'll tell you what kind of sign it
[1:21:39] is. It's an end time seed sign.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; That is so true.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Moses took of the anointing oil and of
[1:21:48] the blood. So here the spirit and the
[1:21:50] blood coming together because after all
[1:21:55] we the blood itself, the literal blood,
[1:21:57] it's already went on the ground from
[1:21:59] Calvary. there there wouldn't have been
[1:22:00] enough literal blood to sprinkle on
[1:22:02] every one of us. But what it was is that
[1:22:04] blood had to be shed because the life
[1:22:06] within it would come back upon the
[1:22:08] worshipper and it would be the life, the
[1:22:09] Holy Spirit, God's own life that would
[1:22:11] draw you and I into relationship. So
[1:22:14] actually when the spirit of God is
[1:22:16] speaking to our life, that's the
[1:22:18] presence of the blood of Jesus Christ in
[1:22:20] the meeting.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Because this blood
[1:22:25] speaks.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, it does.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:30] which was on the altar now sprinkled it
[1:22:32] upon Aaron and upon his garments upon
[1:22:34] his sons upon his son's garments with
[1:22:36] them and sanctified Aaron and his
[1:22:39] garments and his sons and his sons
[1:22:41] garments with them. Now I want to remind
[1:22:43] you Jesus said remember them with the um
[1:22:48] uh there with with you know when Jesus
[1:22:50] was there with the disciples and Jesus
[1:22:53] remember they you know Peter didn't want
[1:22:55] him to go. I mean who would
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; They didn't want him to go. Let me just
[1:23:00] say it like this. That's why you think
[1:23:02] brother Perry Green reading and I'm not
[1:23:04] riding on the plane. They were waiting
[1:23:06] on brother Brandham to rise. It wasn't
[1:23:08] the brother Brandham. It was Jesus
[1:23:09] Christ who said they didn't see. They
[1:23:11] didn't see what was to come.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; The word had to be delivered and it was
[1:23:17] delivered.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; The trail of the serpent was exposed.
[1:23:22] All that would be needed. The pathway
[1:23:24] had been opened up. Not by dynamite, but
[1:23:27] seven angels blasted open. A pathway
[1:23:30] back into the holiest of holies.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Not a new writing. Not a new writing,
[1:23:37] but seal it up, John.
[1:23:40] seal it up.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; And in the end time, not dynamite, but
[1:23:45] in the end time, the mighty angel Christ
[1:23:48] himself coming down to do what? Open up
[1:23:51] the way.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; And that mighty angel is none other than
[1:23:55] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? We are being
[1:24:02] escorted.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not just by angels, but
[1:24:08] Christ himself in the midst of a bride
[1:24:12] body.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; And we're not anointed to go down.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; We're anointed to go up.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; That's why if you get contrary or I get
[1:24:24] contrary in our minds or our thoughts,
[1:24:26] that anointing is greater than your
[1:24:29] thoughts.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Yes.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; Now remember when Jesus was here, he
[1:24:36] told them throughout. He says he began
[1:24:39] to teach them. The Bible says in Mark
[1:24:41] 8:31 of how the son of man must suffer
[1:24:44] many things. They still didn't grasp it.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; It's all right. It wasn't the time. John
[1:24:51] 14:28, you've heard and how I said unto
[1:24:54] you, I go away and come again. And if
[1:24:57] you love me, you would rejoice.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? They thought love you.
[1:25:01] I would rejoice. I don't want you to go
[1:25:03] away.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Right? John 16:37. Nevertheless, I tell
[1:25:08] you the truth. It is expedient for you
[1:25:11] that I go away. Who's the eye? The
[1:25:15] sacrifice. The body that that that God
[1:25:18] was dwelling in.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; It's expedient for who? For you.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Who's this all about?
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Who's this all about? It's about God
[1:25:30] coming down and making a way for you and
[1:25:33] I.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; And if I go not away, the comforter will
[1:25:39] not come
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; unto you. But if I depart, I will send
[1:25:42] him unto you. When Jesus was walking
[1:25:46] down the road to Emmas, pardon me. He
[1:25:49] was walking down the road to Emmas.
[1:25:52] He came to them. Remember, they were
[1:25:54] sad. They didn't understand what had
[1:25:56] taken place. But this is where he came
[1:25:58] to them and be to open the scriptures
[1:26:01] unto them and begin to expound all of
[1:26:04] that which was spoken beginning with
[1:26:07] Moses all the way down to present hour.
[1:26:11] Ought not Christ to have suffered these
[1:26:13] things. Now what's he doing? He's
[1:26:15] opening letting them know the way has
[1:26:18] been opened for you to come now into
[1:26:22] perfect fellowship. The fellowship we've
[1:26:25] had has not been real oneness. But the
[1:26:28] oneness that my prayer was for in John
[1:26:31] 17 was that as the Father was in me and
[1:26:34] I in him, that I would be in you and you
[1:26:37] in me in perfect oneness. And in order
[1:26:40] for that oneness to come to pass, I had
[1:26:44] to go and make a way for you.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; That is so good.
[1:26:52] So I want to say that here he is the sin
[1:26:55] offering
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; and this sin offering when you look back
[1:27:00] in the beginnings of that chapter
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; and I want you to notice about every one
[1:27:04] of these offerings the sin offering the
[1:27:07] burnt offering the ram of consecration
[1:27:09] the wave offering every one of them was
[1:27:11] a hands-on event
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; right
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; oh that's good
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; you got to be identified all the way
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; they had to put their hands on the head
[1:27:19] of that sacrifice
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; you got Got to be identified with the
[1:27:23] word. Got to be identified with Jesus
[1:27:25] Christ. That's a choice.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; Free moral agency. The only way is
[1:27:32] through that gate of self-will.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; And this bulock had to be offered for
[1:27:38] sin. I want to remind you the inward
[1:27:40] parts of this bulock were offered on the
[1:27:43] altar, but the skin, the dung, all of it
[1:27:46] was taken without the camp.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Jesus suffered without the gate.
[1:27:52] He was our complete sin offering. He who
[1:27:55] knew no sin became
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; our sin.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; That we might be made the very
[1:28:03] righteousness of God in Christ. As a
[1:28:05] matter of fact, the prophet tells us in
[1:28:07] forsaking all there on Calvary, he said,
[1:28:10] notice when he said, "My God, my God,
[1:28:13] why is there forsaking me?" He doesn't
[1:28:15] say my father, my father. Because the
[1:28:18] spirit had already left in the garden
[1:28:20] and was leading him to the slaughter.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; And he said he couldn't remain a son
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; and pave the way for you and I
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; sinners to become sons. So he became
[1:28:33] sin.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; And he said he became sin that he might
[1:28:36] make sinners sons.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; He bore it all.
[1:28:44] He bore everything. He He bore it all.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; Now when we consider this, I want you to
[1:28:52] think that how this sacrifice when Jesus
[1:28:56] comes to the River Jordan here after 30
[1:29:00] years of living upon this earth,
[1:29:05] going through different stages of life,
[1:29:09] knowing what it'd be like for you and I.
[1:29:11] But the sacrifice has got to be washed
[1:29:14] before it can be received.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; So you can't just offer up the sacrifice
[1:29:20] without washing it. Jesus when he came
[1:29:23] to the river Jordan there to be baptized
[1:29:26] of John, we all know by the scripture
[1:29:28] where John's commission was is baptizing
[1:29:32] unto repentance. He could not baptize
[1:29:34] for remission of sins because the
[1:29:37] sacrifice had not been offered up. And
[1:29:40] Jesus did not enter the water because he
[1:29:42] had to repent like you and I. When you
[1:29:45] and I come to the waters of baptism, it
[1:29:48] is because we recognize ourselves as
[1:29:51] sinners and we are even in the
[1:29:54] beginnings to identify ourself with our
[1:29:58] sacrifice
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; to take upon his name.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:05] He didn't have to be washed because he
[1:30:08] had a bad nature.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; He didn't have to repent. But he was to
[1:30:12] be the sacrifice.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; He was to be the high priest.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; now? I want you to think of this in this
[1:30:23] manner. I I love how brother Brandham,
[1:30:25] you know, he's bringing this out and and
[1:30:27] how of this washing and I want just
[1:30:29] listen to this. I'm not going to post
[1:30:30] this quote, but listen to this. He said,
[1:30:31] "Think of how that the two great leaders
[1:30:35] of the hour, the Messiah and his prophet
[1:30:37] met in the water." This is he cares. Do
[1:30:39] you care? John was baptizing not for
[1:30:42] remission of sins but unto repentance.
[1:30:44] He said, "Because his offering had been
[1:30:46] made yet. And the sacrifice come to him
[1:30:48] in the water. And Jesus John looking up
[1:30:50] and seeing Jesus, he said, I have need
[1:30:52] to be baptized of thee. Why comest thou
[1:30:54] unto me?" And Jesus said, "Suffer it to
[1:30:57] be so." You you know this is in Matthew
[1:30:59] chapter 3. Which suffere it to be so.
[1:31:01] For thus it behooveth us be coming to us
[1:31:05] to fulfill all righteousness.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; What that the sacrifice has got to be
[1:31:10] washed before it's received. Then John
[1:31:13] being a prophet on whom the word of the
[1:31:15] Lord come comes only to the prophet.
[1:31:17] John being a prophet understood that
[1:31:20] that was the sacrifice. And according to
[1:31:22] the law the sacrifice had to be washed
[1:31:24] before presented. And that's the reason
[1:31:27] he baptized him. He said this is, see,
[1:31:30] it behooveth us to fulfill all
[1:31:32] righteousness. Now, now applying that
[1:31:35] scripture to our own life, it behooves
[1:31:38] us to fulfill all righteousness. It is
[1:31:41] that of God calling us a as a child of
[1:31:45] God, of elect child of God. And it's us
[1:31:48] surrendering. It's us submitting to the
[1:31:51] call of the Holy Spirit coming through
[1:31:53] the word and to a real child of God. Now
[1:31:56] listen to me now. Jesus was the lamb
[1:31:59] before he ever came to the Jordan.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; The prophet picks it up in the token. He
[1:32:05] said, "See, he was a lamb all along." He
[1:32:06] said, "See the predestination in view."
[1:32:08] He was a lamb before he got there.
[1:32:10] That's the reason the dove could come to
[1:32:12] him.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, down beneath all of our
[1:32:15] wolfy natures,
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; there was a predestinated seed. And that
[1:32:20] predestinated seed was a lamb that was
[1:32:22] on the lamb's book of life.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; Right? Jesus said, "My sheep know my
[1:32:27] voice." That's why the prophet said,
[1:32:28] "You do not through the new birth become
[1:32:31] a sheep. You always were a sheep."
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Well, what changes? Your nature is
[1:32:38] changed.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. And the actual change
[1:32:43] of the nature is actually the death of
[1:32:47] the old nature
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; and that new nature set in
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; which God raising up that seed on the
[1:32:53] inside.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:32:56] Because remember God well I'm not I
[1:32:58] won't go there tonight because I want to
[1:33:00] stay there's so many different types and
[1:33:01] places to run but to understand brother
[1:33:04] Ram goes on to say he said now the
[1:33:06] sacrifice it must be wash in the labor
[1:33:09] talking about the brazen labor before
[1:33:12] presented for sacrifice
[1:33:14] and Jesus was the sacrifice and John
[1:33:18] knew it and he knew that he must be
[1:33:19] washed before presented and then
[1:33:22] immediately afterwards he was presented
[1:33:24] for the public for trial and was the
[1:33:26] sacrifice for all human life.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Now, let me just say it to you. The
[1:33:31] reason when Jesus, he knew when to come,
[1:33:35] you know how he knew when to come?
[1:33:37] Because the same Holy Ghost
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; that calls you to the word of the hour.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; The prophet said the spirit sought him
[1:33:45] out in perfect obedience. You see, when
[1:33:48] God came down and became one of us, God
[1:33:50] so allowed himself to condescend to
[1:33:54] experience the wooing and the drawing of
[1:33:57] the spirit.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; You want me to read you the quote? Jesus
[1:34:02] was born the son of God to be Emanuel,
[1:34:04] God's expression in a man, and he found
[1:34:06] him in perfect obedience down at the
[1:34:09] River Jordan. And as soon as he obeyed
[1:34:13] him and walked out of the water, the
[1:34:15] heavens opened to John.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; You see, that's the key. God's not going
[1:34:20] to open heaven.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Until there's been obedience to the
[1:34:24] simple things of his word.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Are you talking about heavens being
[1:34:29] open? I'm talking about coming back into
[1:34:31] heavenly places.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:34:35] Because when God opens that, notice how
[1:34:38] Jesus was sought out. The prophet said,
[1:34:40] "In perfect obedience," he said,
[1:34:43] "Perfect obedience, the spirit had
[1:34:45] sought him out." I love how he says
[1:34:46] this, "Oh, weward man or woman, you
[1:34:49] there's something in you telling you
[1:34:50] that this is right." It's the Holy
[1:34:54] Spirit seeking you out
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; to bring you to a knowledge of the truth
[1:35:00] of this hour.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; To bring you to the realization of what
[1:35:05] this is all about and who this is all
[1:35:07] about. The message is not a movement.
[1:35:10] [Music]
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; The message is Jesus Christ.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; You're not called to a man. You're not
[1:35:18] consecrated to a man. You're not
[1:35:20] consecrated to a building. You're not
[1:35:22] consecrated to a ministry. You're not
[1:35:24] consecrated to a city.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; You have been called in consecration to
[1:35:31] the word.
[1:35:32] [Applause]
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, Baptist doctrine will
[1:35:37] bear allegiance to Baptist doctrine.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Pentecostals will bear allegiance to
[1:35:43] Pentecostal doctrine.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; And where did that doctrine come from?
[1:35:49] Where did that come from? To break him
[1:35:50] into three persons. I'll tell you where
[1:35:52] it came from. It came from hell.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; Your prophet called it the doctrines of
[1:35:57] devils.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; And it's the same one that speaks in the
[1:36:02] book of Revelation. Frogs and frogs are
[1:36:04] the only one that looks backwards.
[1:36:06] Looking backwards to Na Council where
[1:36:09] they split him up into three. It ain't
[1:36:11] three personalities.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; God's not a schizophrenic.
[1:36:17] Yeah,
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; anybody in their right mind
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; would know that. The prophet even said
[1:36:23] it like this. He said it don't even
[1:36:24] Christ the mystery. He said it don't
[1:36:26] even really take a revelation about
[1:36:27] water baptism. It's right there in the
[1:36:30] word.
[1:36:32] [Applause]
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; The part of revelation is where a person
[1:36:36] says, "Wow, what God has done for me,
[1:36:39] what he intends to do in my life that
[1:36:41] Christ might dwell in me." That's when
[1:36:43] it's a revelation
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; because we can Bible study people and
[1:36:47] people can say, "I I see it. I see it.
[1:36:50] Where are they? Where are they?
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Where are they? Where are they?" It's
[1:36:53] not a revelation.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; See, friends, that's why we're not I'm
[1:36:57] not interested in talking people into
[1:36:58] this.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Samuel, you're not No. No. I
[1:37:03] believe in reaching out, but I don't
[1:37:05] believe in where I'm We're out here
[1:37:06] trying to wrangle people in.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; That's so good. And let me say this to
[1:37:13] you. If a person has believed the Lord
[1:37:15] Jesus Christ for salvation, praise God.
[1:37:18] It's not a secure position.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; It's not a secure position because the
[1:37:23] Bible said might be saved. It's not
[1:37:25] secure.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; There's only one place of security and
[1:37:28] that's in Christ.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; That's one place of security. It's one
[1:37:33] place of safety and stability. But you
[1:37:36] know, going along with that, I thank God
[1:37:38] for salvation. But you see, this message
[1:37:40] never came to call us to the door and
[1:37:43] leave us at the door and wondering and
[1:37:45] fellowshipping around the door. The
[1:37:47] message of the hour came to call us into
[1:37:50] relationship.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Why? That Christ, it's Christ and his
[1:37:56] bride might be made one. Now watch this.
[1:37:58] Brother Bram says it like this. He says,
[1:37:59] "Now in Revelations chapter 4 part
[1:38:01] three, before the sacrifices was burnt
[1:38:04] or accepted, they had to be washed.
[1:38:06] Before any sacrifice is received to God,
[1:38:09] it's first got to be washed. Not
[1:38:11] emotionally, but washed by the word.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; Come on. 9/11 produced a lot of
[1:38:19] emotionality.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; Let tragedy strike the nation.
[1:38:23] Emotionality,
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; if that's even a word.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; And you give it after a period of time.
[1:38:28] When the emotion wears off, it's like a
[1:38:30] man who's drunk. When it wears off, it's
[1:38:33] done.
[1:38:35] Are you hearing me?
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; It's not true. Because the real truth of
[1:38:40] the gospel not only brings us to the
[1:38:43] reality that Christ is our sin offering,
[1:38:46] our burnt offering, but it brings us to
[1:38:49] the reality of God's desire to dwell
[1:38:51] inside of us and to kill that old sin
[1:38:54] nature.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, notice he goes on.
[1:39:01] said, "Before we can ever come to God
[1:39:02] with true faith, we first got to come by
[1:39:04] the waters of separation." You've got to
[1:39:06] come by what? The word. That's why a
[1:39:08] person can never receive the Holy Ghost
[1:39:10] without believing the word.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; So true.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; If you listen to me, if you've got
[1:39:15] disagreements with the word, you need to
[1:39:17] let God remedy all those disagreements.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; And don't just set us satisfy sitting
[1:39:23] under an anointing. You've got to have
[1:39:25] an anointing that goes down to your soul
[1:39:27] that makes you and anoints you with the
[1:39:30] sweetness of the rose of Sharon
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; that changes your nature to where
[1:39:35] there's an amen on the inside of your
[1:39:37] life. That's where the anointing is to
[1:39:39] go.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; I'm not upset at anybody. I'm just very
[1:39:44] passionate.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I know sometimes I've seen
[1:39:48] myself I'm like dear God what I'm
[1:39:50] already ugly but Lord have mercy seeing
[1:39:52] the faces that's made within that time
[1:39:54] but you know friend what you know what
[1:39:55] the whole thing that what God you know
[1:39:56] what God was doing through the prophet
[1:39:58] and they in that hour got upset with him
[1:40:02] they got so upset with him they did not
[1:40:04] even want him to preach in their
[1:40:07] churches no more
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham told him out in Arizona
[1:40:10] he says I know why you did it
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; I know why you wouldn't have me
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; even in the last meetings that we hear
[1:40:17] where he preaches such uh man just a a
[1:40:21] catalyst of messages. It's the invisible
[1:40:24] union of the bride of Christ. I've heard
[1:40:25] but now I see works as faith express on
[1:40:27] the wings of a snow white dove. Within
[1:40:29] those meetings, Jack Moore and them
[1:40:30] tried to get to him
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; to stop him so he wouldn't preach no
[1:40:34] more.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; I'm not making that up, brother. That's
[1:40:39] right.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; That's a truth.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; But you know what? Remember brother Bam
[1:40:44] tells on tape? They were trying to find
[1:40:45] me for lunch and I was down the
[1:40:47] courtyard. They were up on my room and
[1:40:49] then I was up here and I was up here.
[1:40:50] Who was doing that? God.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; You know why? Cuz we needed those
[1:40:55] messages. Invisible union of the bride
[1:40:58] of Christ. We needed that works is made
[1:41:00] fa faith faith or works is faith
[1:41:03] expressed. We needed those words.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; So very
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; glory be to God. And you know what? They
[1:41:12] didn't want to hear it no more. Right.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; They didn't want Pentecostalism being
[1:41:16] being called out.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; Now listen, don't go to calling emotion
[1:41:20] Pentecostalism.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; Cuz if you don't got emotion, you're
[1:41:24] dead.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet, listen to me
[1:41:28] now, I can tell you multiple quotes.
[1:41:30] 1959 question answers is one. Oh,
[1:41:33] brother brother Brandham, I think so and
[1:41:34] so got in the flesh when they were
[1:41:36] dancing. They were this. said, "Look,
[1:41:38] I've seen many people that then I can
[1:41:40] look over and realize even speaking in
[1:41:42] tongues and other things." He said, "But
[1:41:44] I won't say nothing against it." He
[1:41:47] said, "What I say in my heart is God.
[1:41:50] They are a child of yours like I am, and
[1:41:53] they love you like I do, and they want
[1:41:56] to come where you are like I do."
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; That's why Brother Bram says, "To say
[1:42:00] anything against it is blasphemy."
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; I'm not making that up. See, that's
[1:42:05] respect.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Remember friends, suspicion is not
[1:42:09] discernment.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "Then you've got to
[1:42:22] hear the word before you can enter
[1:42:23] there." You got because what does faith
[1:42:25] do? Faith opens up a clear way.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:42:30] It's like many times when I I watch
[1:42:32] within even in meetings, we're going
[1:42:34] into meetings. A lot of times it falls
[1:42:36] my lot to preach the you know the
[1:42:38] morning services and things and and
[1:42:40] thank God I always love I got the
[1:42:41] evangelist to follow after why I can
[1:42:43] teach in the morning.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; So they know what they're coming to.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; They know what to expect.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; You got to know. That's why brother Bram
[1:42:52] says he talks about why why is the Holy
[1:42:54] Ghost? He said you can't receive it
[1:42:55] unless you know what it is.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; And to know how it is to get it. So God,
[1:42:59] there there's an aspect of what the
[1:43:01] teaching of the word does. It allows us
[1:43:04] with the right expectation. What did
[1:43:06] Jesus do for 40 days?
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Did he preach to them for 40 days?
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; The Bible said he was teaching them.
[1:43:17] Got quiet.
[1:43:20] Got quiet. What was he doing? He was
[1:43:23] giving them instruction. Right?
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Not only in what you're approaching as
[1:43:29] you're coming to and what it will do in
[1:43:32] your life, but then even the instruction
[1:43:35] that would come after the Holy Ghost has
[1:43:37] come.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; So good.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; My my my
[1:43:44] so here the Lord Jesus becoming he was
[1:43:48] not only the sin offering but he is the
[1:43:51] burnt offering. Matter of fact, he's all
[1:43:52] of it. Every one of this, every one of
[1:43:54] these things within here, he was the
[1:43:56] burnt offering which was entirely burned
[1:43:58] upon the altar. He was the sweet
[1:44:00] smelling savor in the nostrils of God.
[1:44:02] God was pleased as it writes in Isaiah
[1:44:05] 53. He was satisfied with his offering.
[1:44:09] Right
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; now, this is why I I'm not going to have
[1:44:12] time to read these scriptures, but I
[1:44:14] want you just to, you know, maybe refer
[1:44:16] to them, and they're very familiar
[1:44:18] scriptures to us, but this is why that
[1:44:20] Paul would write when he came among the
[1:44:22] Corinthians that he said, "I was with
[1:44:24] you in fear and trembling, lest your
[1:44:27] faith would stand in me." He said, "I
[1:44:30] didn't want your faith in me. I I I want
[1:44:32] your faith to stand in the power of
[1:44:35] God."
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Right? I say and Paul made this this
[1:44:39] statement. I know nothing among you
[1:44:41] except Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[1:44:44] You say, brother Samuel, why was that so
[1:44:47] important? Well, it wasn't just talking
[1:44:49] about an event. But when Paul would
[1:44:51] preach the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus
[1:44:53] Christ, it was the same way the spirit
[1:44:55] was in Peter. When Peter spoke of the
[1:44:58] present fulfillment that the atonement
[1:45:01] has come and the life of the atonement
[1:45:03] was delivering the message, it brought
[1:45:05] conviction in the heart of the believers
[1:45:08] that were listening to it.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; So Paul was setting forth that he is the
[1:45:16] all sufficiency. All was met in him. All
[1:45:20] that you have need of
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; showing them that he is the way. This is
[1:45:25] why that Paul would write and he would
[1:45:28] say that God forbid I should glory save
[1:45:30] in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ by
[1:45:33] whom the world is crucified unto me and
[1:45:36] I unto the world. Now let me just tell
[1:45:37] you something. It's more than just
[1:45:39] rallying around the cross of the Lord
[1:45:41] Jesus is to realize he spoke of your
[1:45:45] cross and my cross more than he ever did
[1:45:47] his own.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; That's right. That is so true.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; But if he didn't go to Calvary, you and
[1:45:52] I could not take up our cross.
[1:45:54] Amen.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; There's no way that you and I could come
[1:45:57] to that place to so die to ourselves
[1:46:00] that the there were the spirit of God
[1:46:02] transforming us by the new birth. We
[1:46:05] could not come to that unless he was
[1:46:07] willing to drink his bitter cup.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? He He had to do
[1:46:12] that. He made a way for you and I.
[1:46:13] That's why he was saying, "I am the way,
[1:46:15] the truth, and the life."
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; This is why, listen, this is why that
[1:46:19] Satan loves just to leave people looking
[1:46:22] at the cross. Oh, I thank God for the
[1:46:23] cross. Oh, I thank God for the cross.
[1:46:24] Well, I thank God for the cross, too.
[1:46:26] And I'm not taking away, friends.
[1:46:28] Sometimes there's things that where
[1:46:29] people can only see to a certain degree.
[1:46:31] But I'm talking to you. I'm preaching in
[1:46:33] a message church right here this morning
[1:46:35] to message believers, those that are
[1:46:38] called to take up your own cross and
[1:46:41] become united with Jesus Christ. Not
[1:46:44] just fellowship around the wonderful
[1:46:45] attributes, but what why did he go to
[1:46:48] Calvary? Why was his blood shed? Why did
[1:46:52] he suffer? Why did he do that?
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Just to produce church groups,
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; self-help seminars?
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; Is that what he did? Did he die to
[1:47:04] produce Christian psychologist?
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; Is that what he did?
[1:47:11] No wonder the prophet
[1:47:14] when he would stand there and say he'd
[1:47:17] seen the church
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; of the world America.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; He said oh God see her she was naked.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; He said oh God
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; is that you know what I love about the
[1:47:28] prophet? He never said is that the best
[1:47:30] they can produce for you. He said God is
[1:47:32] that the best we
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; can produce for you.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; See he was laboring. This message was
[1:47:38] what? to have a bride dressed.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; And that dressear is the word upon our
[1:47:45] lives.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; Revelations 19, the marriage of the lamb
[1:47:49] has come and his wife hath made herself
[1:47:52] ready to her was granted to be arrayed
[1:47:56] in the fine linen which is the
[1:47:58] righteousness of the saints to have on
[1:48:00] that wedding garment to have that seal
[1:48:02] to have that token in her life. Now
[1:48:05] watch. by whom the world is crucified
[1:48:07] unto me and I unto the world. So, we
[1:48:09] don't want to just stop. Thank God for
[1:48:11] the cross, but to recognize what the
[1:48:13] cross did. It made a way for you and I
[1:48:15] to come into full relationship with God.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; Now, listen to me. I'm getting to some
[1:48:20] points now. Paul said in Galatians 3:1,
[1:48:23] "Oh, foolish Galatians, who hath
[1:48:26] bewitched you?" Incredible. Paul was
[1:48:29] calling out witchcraft and sorcery
[1:48:32] among the church of God
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; that you should not obey the truth
[1:48:39] before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been
[1:48:42] evidently set forth and crucified among
[1:48:47] you.
[1:48:48] I want to remind you this last day
[1:48:50] church is led by a witch
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; and they've got one that come right out
[1:48:56] of America.
[1:48:58] The Bible said out of her was sorceries.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; That's good. That's true.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; Blasphemous teachings.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; But let me just tell you, it's not just
[1:49:11] her. She's got daughters.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; Daughters that they taking on their own
[1:49:18] name.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Confront them with the word. Well, my
[1:49:21] church says this.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; What does the word say?
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Well, we teach this in a what does the
[1:49:29] word say? It's not about your church.
[1:49:31] We're not saved because we're identified
[1:49:33] with the church. There's only one place
[1:49:35] of safety, and that's under the blood.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; This is an hour of urgency, friends.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's an hour to say, God,
[1:49:50] let everything be clear.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; Let everything be clear. Let every
[1:49:54] channel, let every part of confusion be
[1:49:56] broken.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; Watch how the prophet takes us. If you
[1:50:01] haven't listened to this message in a
[1:50:03] while, I want you to listen to it. Going
[1:50:05] beyond the camp, I I don't know over the
[1:50:06] past weeks, I I don't know how many
[1:50:08] times I've went through this message.
[1:50:10] Brother Bram says, "More and more I am
[1:50:13] made to believe that people are not
[1:50:15] getting to Christ." And he said, "I'm
[1:50:18] here to help in every way that I can and
[1:50:19] make my statements as clear as I know
[1:50:21] how to make them. and you suffer with me
[1:50:23] if you will. Brother B says, "As I look
[1:50:25] and I preach across the nation and watch
[1:50:27] people, I am fully persuaded that the
[1:50:30] people are not getting to Christ." I
[1:50:32] believe that it's the enemy that's
[1:50:34] throwed this hindrance. Because the
[1:50:37] reason I believe this is he's not the
[1:50:39] object that they have been pointed to.
[1:50:43] They have either been pointed to a
[1:50:45] dogma, a doctrine, a party or experience
[1:50:48] or sensation or something like that
[1:50:51] instead of being pointed to Christ the
[1:50:54] word.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; That's why I think that people are
[1:50:59] resting their eternal destination upon
[1:51:01] some dogma, some sensation. I danced in
[1:51:04] the spirit. I spoke with tongues. I felt
[1:51:06] fire run over me. And do you know all
[1:51:08] those things can be impersonated by the
[1:51:10] devil?
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:12] You know what? Pentecostals, they they
[1:51:15] couldn't stand this. Do you know why
[1:51:17] Jesus was put out of the lady in church?
[1:51:21] This is it right here. He is the word.
[1:51:24] They put him out.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; They put him out. They didn't want the
[1:51:32] life. Now, let me ask you something. If
[1:51:34] he's not there, who are they worshiping?
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:42] I'm not throwing off on anybody. I'm
[1:51:44] just preaching the word.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; There's one thing that he cannot
[1:51:49] impersonate and that's the word. In the
[1:51:51] debate between the he and Jesus, each
[1:51:53] time Jesus defeated him, it is written
[1:51:56] in the word.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; Jesus never never defeated him on well,
[1:52:00] I felt this. All right, the Lord showed
[1:52:02] me this or this. You don't defeat the
[1:52:05] devil on that.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; That's right. Right. You've got to
[1:52:08] defeat the devil knowing where you're
[1:52:10] standing on God's word and to know that
[1:52:13] his word is in your life and you are in
[1:52:15] him.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "I believe today the
[1:52:23] reason that people are not coming to
[1:52:25] Christ is because they're pointing many
[1:52:27] of them to a denomination. you come join
[1:52:30] our church, you read our catechism,
[1:52:33] believe our doctrine or some system of
[1:52:35] some sort, they are pointed in the wrong
[1:52:37] way and their action and the life that
[1:52:40] they live without Christ proves in their
[1:52:43] own life is vindicated by that very
[1:52:45] thing. Now watch, he's going to give the
[1:52:47] example. For instance, I don't want to
[1:52:48] hurt nobody's feeling, but back and
[1:52:50] forth across the nation, I have
[1:52:51] condemned women for wearing short hair.
[1:52:53] All right.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; And let me just remind you, when people
[1:52:57] talk about trimming the dead ends,
[1:52:59] that's one of the dumbest statements.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; Cuz your hair don't grow from the end.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; Into your head.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; Sorry for being so plain, but there's
[1:53:09] really, you know, we ought to be living
[1:53:10] in a time of plainness. That don't even
[1:53:13] make sense.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; I mean, it don't, like brother Ben goes
[1:53:18] on to say, I've condemned women wear
[1:53:20] wearing shorts and using makeups. What?
[1:53:22] Let me tell you what made sense. If I
[1:53:24] came here and talked about how wrong it
[1:53:25] is to smoke because you, you know,
[1:53:27] notice, not only does the spirit of God
[1:53:28] condemn it, but even when brother talks
[1:53:31] about all those, you can see medical
[1:53:33] science, they even put it on the package
[1:53:35] warning carcinogens.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; I'm not making this up, friends. I can
[1:53:40] preach these things without reading
[1:53:41] quotes.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; But do you know makeup holds carcinogen
[1:53:46] properties?
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; And you think God is pleased with that?
[1:53:51] There's only one woman who ever did that
[1:53:53] in the Bible, and she was named Jezebel.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; And she did that to appear before a man.
[1:53:59] You know why this church that's under
[1:54:01] the anointing of a Jezebel spirit that's
[1:54:04] decked with all this gold and decked
[1:54:06] with crosses? You know why they're doing
[1:54:08] that? To appear holy and righteous, but
[1:54:11] on the inside, full of dead men's bones,
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; full of the martyrs and the blood of the
[1:54:17] saints.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; It's only a covering. Yes.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; But aren't you glad that God provided a
[1:54:24] greater covering for you and I? It ain't
[1:54:26] a covering that we smear on the outside,
[1:54:28] but it's a covering that'll deal with
[1:54:30] that old unbelief in our life. It'll rid
[1:54:32] sin nature from the inside and bring a
[1:54:34] liberty and a freedom from the inside
[1:54:37] because it's not about a garment on the
[1:54:39] outside. It's the garment on the inside
[1:54:40] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your
[1:54:43] soul.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; I've condemned women wearing shorts and
[1:54:49] using makeup, and every year it gets
[1:54:51] worse. It shows there's another finger
[1:54:54] somewhere. Not another finger here in
[1:54:55] this church.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; I'll continue to blast it.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; It shows that there's another finger
[1:55:04] somewhere. It might be another finger.
[1:55:06] Might be another. Oh, my my you know, my
[1:55:08] aunt said this or my daddy said this or
[1:55:10] my Whose voice are you going to take?
[1:55:12] Amen.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; Because when you stand there that day,
[1:55:16] it will be nobody to stand there for
[1:55:18] you.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; Mama won't be there. Daddy won't be
[1:55:21] there. But oh, what a blessed thing it
[1:55:23] is to say, God, I throw away my filthy
[1:55:25] rags. I'm willing to accept what the
[1:55:28] voice is saying by the spirit of
[1:55:30] almighty God.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; Why, friends? Why? Is to bring cleansing
[1:55:34] in our lives.
[1:55:40] Lord,
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; and they say, "We belong to a church.
[1:55:46] Our church don't." Well, don't make any
[1:55:48] difference what your church believes.
[1:55:50] God said it's wrong.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; And if they did get through to Christ,
[1:55:54] they would stop that.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; Not only that, but man would take his
[1:55:59] position if he got through on Christ and
[1:56:00] be against it.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; Husbands wouldn't let their wives act
[1:56:06] like that. genuine man don't want his
[1:56:08] wife acting that way. Now, that don't
[1:56:10] mean to go in and, you know, you those
[1:56:12] of you that have believing power or
[1:56:14] unbel, you know, spouses that aren't
[1:56:15] walking in the truth, it don't mean you
[1:56:16] go in there and empty out, you know, her
[1:56:18] her paint and everything else or
[1:56:20] whatever. It means you live a life of a
[1:56:22] standard. And don't you compliment that
[1:56:24] thing?
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Because beauty ain't
[1:56:28] about ain't about what kind of coloring
[1:56:30] this and shading this and shading that.
[1:56:32] Real beauty is character on the inside.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; Because after all, if God carries, we're
[1:56:39] all going to be a wrinkled mess.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; Look like eventually paint on that looks
[1:56:48] like paint. You got to take the filing
[1:56:50] thing through and scrape it off the wall
[1:56:51] and do what? Get the primer and put some
[1:56:52] back on it. That's where they have the
[1:56:55] pickups and the let downs and all that
[1:56:56] other stuff, you know, going on. But if
[1:56:58] they got, listen, if they got through to
[1:57:00] Christ, listen to me now, they would
[1:57:02] stop that.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; It ain't about somebody saying, "Well,
[1:57:05] I'm going to quit this." That's not what
[1:57:07] he's saying. He's saying getting through
[1:57:09] to Christ and then the appetite of the
[1:57:11] world is gone.
[1:57:14] [Music]
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; It must come through the blood.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; Now, you know, I want you to read this
[1:57:22] chapter when you get home. I don't have
[1:57:23] time to to to to to read it all. I would
[1:57:26] love to. But this second th second
[1:57:29] Thessalonians chapter 2, I want you to
[1:57:31] read this when you get home because this
[1:57:32] is the same chapter that speaks of the
[1:57:36] deception
[1:57:37] that even where that mystery of iniquity
[1:57:40] has been riding all the way down. That
[1:57:42] first writer, innocence, that white
[1:57:46] horse rider, it speaks of it coming into
[1:57:48] that place because Paul said the mystery
[1:57:51] of iniquity is already working. And Paul
[1:57:53] is going in to speak in this in this
[1:57:56] verse or this chapter 2 Thessalonians 2
[1:57:58] Thessalonians chapter 2 that even uh him
[1:58:01] whose coming is after the working of
[1:58:02] Satan with all power and signs and lying
[1:58:05] wonders and with all deceitfulness of
[1:58:07] unrighteousness in them that perish
[1:58:09] because they receive not the love of the
[1:58:12] truth that they might be saved.
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; Now what is the love of the truth?
[1:58:16] Christ in you.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; They did not receive the Holy Ghost. You
[1:58:21] see,
[1:58:24] they hadn't even been taught that. Well,
[1:58:26] brother Samuel, they've talked to them
[1:58:27] to born again, but they've been pointed
[1:58:29] wrongly.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; They've been taught that born again is
[1:58:33] to accept Christ. That's to have the
[1:58:35] same desires on the inside.
[1:58:38] That's not the new birth.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; There's got to come a cleansing. The
[1:58:44] Holy Spirit will not come down on
[1:58:47] unclean desires,
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; but it takes more of the Holy Ghost to
[1:58:52] burn out those unclean desires
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; that then the Holy Spirit might fill and
[1:58:58] put in service what he has cleaned and
[1:59:01] set aside for service.
[1:59:04] Is that right? Now, notice we've got to
[1:59:07] come through come through that of the
[1:59:09] blood. Now, Brother Brandham is pointing
[1:59:11] this out because we're living in the day
[1:59:14] where where Christ and his people
[1:59:17] becoming one.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Wherein that Jesus said,
[1:59:22] "Upon this rock, I'll build my church."
[1:59:24] Well, the temple of God in in when we're
[1:59:27] not looking for another step, we are
[1:59:29] called to ascend to that of brotherly
[1:59:32] kindness and the capstone coming down in
[1:59:34] rapturing grace.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? I it it it's God's
[1:59:38] capstone revelation that's drawing us up
[1:59:41] into that because he said upon this rock
[1:59:42] I'll build my church. What is his
[1:59:44] church? His tabernacle, his dwelling
[1:59:47] place. Right?
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; So God, what what is he going that's
[1:59:50] what Revelations 4 is all about. It's
[1:59:52] about the dwelling place. It's about the
[1:59:54] tabernacle of God being taken in
[1:59:56] rapture.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; Now this is why this this revelation
[2:00:01] Paul gave in that hour talking about
[2:00:04] that mystery of iniquity. How many
[2:00:05] remembers John said in 1 John, I think
[2:00:07] it's 1 John chapter 4 where it said,
[2:00:09] "Beloved, tri spirit." How many know
[2:00:11] that?
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the antichrist spirit was
[2:00:14] already among them,
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; right? Everything was right there. The
[2:00:19] mystery of iniquity, all of that. What
[2:00:21] was it doing? It was it was trying and
[2:00:23] working to turn people away from the
[2:00:26] real true experience of the Holy Ghost
[2:00:30] dwelling in their lives.
[2:00:39] You know, there were some men I I thank
[2:00:41] God those testimonies included. There
[2:00:43] were some men that remember they came to
[2:00:45] brother Brandham and they well they were
[2:00:48] standing on the word as far as all they
[2:00:49] knew.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; Remember the one who was the dean of
[2:00:51] that college
[2:00:53] spoke real bad of brother Brandham.
[2:00:54] Brother Brandham wrote turned back the
[2:00:55] letter and said, "Now dear brother, I
[2:00:57] know you didn't mean that. You're a
[2:00:59] servant of God like I am and you've been
[2:01:01] serving God a lot longer. Matter of
[2:01:03] fact, you was preaching before I was
[2:01:04] born. Brother Ram just, you know, just
[2:01:06] so compliment. And with that response,
[2:01:10] that man invited brother Brandham to
[2:01:12] come to that college
[2:01:14] and they had that discussion where he's
[2:01:16] saying, "Brother Brandham,
[2:01:19] we've believed.
[2:01:21] What more can you do?" He said, "Well,
[2:01:22] brother," he said, "That's right." He
[2:01:23] said, "But remember, God gave Abraham
[2:01:26] the seal of circumcision, showing him he
[2:01:30] had received his faith.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; And brother Bram took took that man.
[2:01:36] Remember, brother Bram tells a story. He
[2:01:38] took that dean to that college and the
[2:01:39] rest of those students. Let me just tell
[2:01:41] you something right now. There was some
[2:01:43] hearts that was honest to look in the
[2:01:44] word. You know what they were more
[2:01:45] interested in? They were more interested
[2:01:47] instead of relying on previous
[2:01:49] experiences
[2:01:51] to look in the word.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; That's where Pentecostals failed. They
[2:01:56] wanted to when the word came to the
[2:01:58] showdown, the word began to deal with
[2:02:00] that there's still something not right
[2:02:01] in your life. this up and down in your
[2:02:03] nature and the love for the world.
[2:02:04] Something's not right. Well, I spoke in
[2:02:05] tonesues. Remember, Brother Brand said
[2:02:07] that one lady's wearing shorts. He said,
[2:02:08] "And she spoke in tongues." He said,
[2:02:10] "You try to tell her she don't got the
[2:02:11] Holy Ghost."
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; Why? What's she relying on? Anointing.
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; But the anointing follows the blood down
[2:02:19] into the soul.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; Not just to be on here on the outer
[2:02:22] realm where it can come and go. True. We
[2:02:25] feel God's presence come and go, but
[2:02:27] when that anointing is on the soul, it's
[2:02:29] there to guide you and direct you even
[2:02:31] when you don't
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; feel it.
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? That's where the mana
[2:02:37] is in the golden ome
[2:02:39] it won't corrupt and get maggots in it.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost can't fade away right
[2:02:43] there. It's it's there present in that
[2:02:45] life.
[2:02:46] This is why in the scripture Paul said,
[2:02:49] "We are bound to give thanks always to
[2:02:51] God for you, brethren, beloved of the
[2:02:52] Lord, because God hath from the
[2:02:55] beginning chosen you to salvation
[2:02:59] through sanctification of the spirit and
[2:03:02] belief of the truth, where to he called
[2:03:05] you by our gospel, to the obtaining of
[2:03:08] the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ."
[2:03:12] Now, I want you to think about this.
[2:03:16] Brother Brandham
[2:03:18] in in bringing this with predestination
[2:03:20] in the message the future home
[2:03:23] he says you weren't saved
[2:03:26] on any certain day you were always saved
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; you've just recognized it
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; how does the person recognize that the
[2:03:40] spirit of God draws them through the
[2:03:44] process this God takes them
[2:03:49] here they stand
[2:03:51] washed
[2:03:53] repentance
[2:03:54] water baptism and I'm not just listen I
[2:03:57] I don't want you to think of this as
[2:03:58] just oh I come and do this step and I
[2:04:00] come and do this step that won't work
[2:04:04] it's got to be faith
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; it's got to be from your heart
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; everything is it's from your heart
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; God drawing upon the heart to move from
[2:04:13] one step to another with with what the
[2:04:16] full desire is. Lord, I want to be one
[2:04:18] with you.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; Right? I want to be one with you. So God
[2:04:22] provided a way that we can come back to
[2:04:25] that. And what that revelation breaks
[2:04:27] forth on our life, you were always
[2:04:29] saved. It doesn't mean that a person
[2:04:30] doesn't have to repent. As a matter of
[2:04:32] fact, it's because of that you will
[2:04:35] repent.
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean, well, I don't need to
[2:04:40] be sanctified. I know this is very
[2:04:41] simple. It means that that's the reason
[2:04:43] you want to be sanctified.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; And it doesn't mean, well, I don't need
[2:04:48] the Holy Ghost. I was already saved. No,
[2:04:49] you you need the Holy Ghost. It's the
[2:04:52] Holy Ghost leading you all the way. And
[2:04:54] if you are a part of that, clear back
[2:04:57] from the mind of God, you will desire
[2:05:00] the Holy Ghost.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; And that's why the prophet said God knew
[2:05:05] that you would be here in this meeting
[2:05:07] tonight.
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; And he knew you would be desiring the
[2:05:10] Holy Ghost. He said he knew that I would
[2:05:12] be standing here preaching what I'm
[2:05:14] preaching. And he made a way that you
[2:05:17] could receive the Holy Ghost.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's the Holy Spirit that
[2:05:23] brings us back into the presence of God,
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; back into our homelands.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me just Can I read just a few
[2:05:32] more statements here?
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is why with him coming
[2:05:38] back into that into that place with God
[2:05:41] to where that the blood itself, brother
[2:05:43] Brandham tells us here in going beyond
[2:05:45] the camp, he said, I know there's some
[2:05:47] reason that people are not getting
[2:05:48] through to Christ. If they would, they
[2:05:50] wouldn't act like it. Now, let me just
[2:05:51] say this
[2:05:53] sometimes, remember brother Ram says a
[2:05:55] son can go a long time
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; before they recognize they're a son,
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; right? A person can set underneath the
[2:06:02] word for a long time. So don't don't
[2:06:04] ever discount
[2:06:05] Someone said, "Well, they must not be
[2:06:07] elect." You don't know that.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; Remember I told you here this lady was
[2:06:10] 99 years old. I don't know how many
[2:06:11] meetings she sat in. I don't know how
[2:06:13] many I I don't know.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; Remember, Brother Brandham tells us in
[2:06:17] the message um redeeming redemption. He
[2:06:20] said, "As a young man, I wanted to get
[2:06:23] right with God." And he said, "I went to
[2:06:25] churches." He said, "But none of them
[2:06:26] made an altar call."
[2:06:30] That's what he said.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; He said, "I went there." Now remember,
[2:06:34] brother Brandham here, he comes outside.
[2:06:36] Remember, he nails a note, you know, to
[2:06:37] the tree and so forth. What I'm trying
[2:06:39] to say to you is is that how that God
[2:06:42] comes down to open the way for his
[2:06:44] children to come back home. But the Ram
[2:06:47] says, I I know there's some reason that
[2:06:48] people are not getting through to
[2:06:49] Christ. If they would, they wouldn't act
[2:06:51] like that. It may So it may it may go
[2:06:54] for a period of time, but I was just
[2:06:55] going to say this to you as well, that
[2:06:58] every elect will come to it.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? That's why we don't
[2:07:04] go around here and putting people in
[2:07:06] headlocks.
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; Right. Listen, I I just want you to
[2:07:11] understand that's why I'm not preaching
[2:07:13] fear.
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; Cuz if you're put into a position under,
[2:07:18] oh, the fear of hell. Hell's a real
[2:07:20] place.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you, it's real.
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; It is real. The prophet saw it expressed
[2:07:25] on earth.
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; But listen, God, you you can't serve God
[2:07:29] by being afraid of hell.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; No, that's right. It's the wrong reason.
[2:07:33] Right.
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; It's like marrying the first man that
[2:07:35] comes along only because you don't want
[2:07:36] to be an old maid.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; It ain't right.
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; If you want better examples, you have to
[2:07:41] ask and praying God. But it's true. I
[2:07:44] mean, that that ain't even real. That
[2:07:45] ain't even real love. You just I don't
[2:07:46] want to be an old maid. Yeah. I just
[2:07:49] marry the first one that comes along.
[2:07:50] That that ain't why we don't serve God
[2:07:52] out of fear.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; No. Amen.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; I'm afraid I'll go to hell. That's not
[2:07:56] real service. That's fear.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:07:59] And perfect love is to cast out all
[2:08:02] fear.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? To where that you're
[2:08:06] standing there, God's desire is to bring
[2:08:08] you to a place to where everybody else,
[2:08:10] if God said, "There's one right here and
[2:08:12] there's one in this city." Sorry, I hate
[2:08:14] to disappoint the rest of you, but this
[2:08:16] is the guy right here that's going.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying that just to be that's
[2:08:21] how I feel.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; If there's only one, that's me.
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; That's how you have to feel.
[2:08:29] That's how you have to feel. If there's
[2:08:31] one in your house, you have to say, "I'm
[2:08:33] that one."
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; Come on. You know I'm pulling from
[2:08:36] quotes here.
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; The whole purpose of that statement
[2:08:40] being made is for you and I to walk with
[2:08:42] a certainty because the experience is an
[2:08:46] individual personal experience. Not a
[2:08:49] group revelation, not a church
[2:08:51] affiliation, but a personal vindicated
[2:08:55] experience of the Holy Spirit in your
[2:08:58] life that you know you pass from death
[2:08:59] unto life.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; Now, brother Bram said Jesus suffered
[2:09:06] without the gates that he might sanctify
[2:09:08] his people with his own blood.
[2:09:10] Sanctification comes from the Greek word
[2:09:12] means cleaned and set aside for service.
[2:09:15] And when God cleans his people with the
[2:09:17] blood of Jesus, he cleans them from the
[2:09:20] filth of the world and sets them aside
[2:09:22] for service.
[2:09:25] Brother Brandham said, I was talking
[2:09:26] about Matthew 17, Mount Transfiguration.
[2:09:29] Remember how Peter said, "It's good to
[2:09:30] be here. Let's build three tabernacles."
[2:09:32] Peter wasn't catching what it was all
[2:09:34] about.
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; He was enthused.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; You know what Peter was a type of? The
[2:09:39] Pentecostals.
[2:09:40] They got enthused. The prophet said,
[2:09:42] "The supernatural excites the human
[2:09:45] emotion."
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; Now, I know people take that quote and
[2:09:49] they'll run it all the way down and if
[2:09:51] there's any type of emotion, they want
[2:09:52] to tie that. No, that's not how Brother
[2:09:54] Brown was saying,
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; missing the whole point whatsoever.
[2:09:58] Because you can't have, listen, you
[2:09:59] can't have the prophet saying that and
[2:10:01] then have this same prophet being the
[2:10:03] one when he comes to himself sitting on
[2:10:06] his podium with his legs dangling over
[2:10:08] it and thinking, "How did I get here?"
[2:10:12] He said, "But I just began to think
[2:10:14] about the goodness of God and think
[2:10:16] about what God had done for me." He got
[2:10:18] beside himself.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. The prophet said he
[2:10:22] got right down there in the floor.
[2:10:23] Remember, he said he was criticizing
[2:10:25] those that was dancing. Why are they
[2:10:26] doing that in my church? Why are they
[2:10:28] doing that in my church? Brother Bram
[2:10:29] said, "Before I knew it, I was out on
[2:10:31] the floor. Had my shoes and my socks off
[2:10:33] and my trouser legs rolled up."
[2:10:37] Woo! Glory.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, Brother Samuel, we just
[2:10:43] believe in the word.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; I don't have time to chase that rabbit
[2:10:52] this morning.
[2:10:54] I do, too. But I believe in the living
[2:10:55] word.
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; I don't believe in the in a word that
[2:10:59] just is, you know, produces a bunch of
[2:11:01] monks. I believe a living word that
[2:11:03] produces a real shout in our life, a
[2:11:06] real living reality. There's a joy in
[2:11:09] our life.
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. That's what the real
[2:11:12] Holy Ghost comes to do is bring a real
[2:11:14] joy. Jesus said, "My joy I leave with
[2:11:17] you." It don't mean you got to dance or
[2:11:19] you got to run, but you've got a joy
[2:11:20] that you know you pass from death unto
[2:11:23] life. It don't matter what you're facing
[2:11:25] in life. You know in whom you have
[2:11:27] believed and persuaded that he is able.
[2:11:30] I have passed from death unto life. I
[2:11:32] have met God's requirements
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; and I have the token.
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; He's our joy.
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; Not if the Buckeyes win.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; Not if the Browns finally have a winning
[2:11:47] season.
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; Now listen.
[2:11:53] Is it against those things?
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; No. But neither should that be your
[2:11:58] source.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; If that's your source, you got to change
[2:12:02] sources.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; You got to change sources because
[2:12:06] there's got to have a living source. A
[2:12:08] source that you can draw that others can
[2:12:10] draw from you from that living source.
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; Let me just shut it down here.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; There's no way to come to a stop. You
[2:12:20] just would jump off.
[2:12:25] But the spirit bade them not to do it.
[2:12:27] Don't build.
[2:12:29] Don't you build tabernacles.
[2:12:32] Don't you exalt men.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; Don't you exalt the law, the prophets. I
[2:12:37] mean, think about it. Can you imagine?
[2:12:39] Listen, they have seen so many wonderful
[2:12:41] things and they're standing there and
[2:12:43] seeing Moses and Elijah. How many people
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; have been able to say that in between in
[2:12:50] their generation? nobody.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; And they're able to say, "We've seen
[2:12:55] Moses and Elijah."
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; And Peter said, "Let's build three
[2:13:00] tabernacles."
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; He was enthused.
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; But this this was not it was not Mount
[2:13:07] Transfiguration was not about exalting
[2:13:09] the prophets. It was not about exalting
[2:13:12] the law. It was about God himself
[2:13:16] declaring through the adoption of his
[2:13:18] son that the law and God's justice has
[2:13:23] been met in the person of Jesus Christ
[2:13:27] and he is the word. Hear ye him.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; That's what this message has brought us
[2:13:38] to is a mount transfiguration. Amen.
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; And it brings every one of us to a
[2:13:44] personal mount transfiguration
[2:13:46] experience.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Bringing us to adoption
[2:13:50] in our own lives. Right?
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; But it's an adoption message.
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; We're under the authority not not of
[2:13:56] man's teachings. We're under the
[2:13:58] authority of the pillar of fire.
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; Stay with me. I'm wrapping it up. I'm
[2:14:03] just This part I'm jumping off. I'm
[2:14:04] trying to jump off now. Tray tables are
[2:14:06] up. Seat belts are buckled.
[2:14:10] But the same pillar of fire, think about
[2:14:12] this now. The same pillar of fire who
[2:14:15] wrote the word has come in the end time
[2:14:18] to interpret the word.
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; Here were the seminaries. The pillar of
[2:14:22] fire goes clear back to the mind of God
[2:14:24] and begins to reveal the contents
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; of the book.
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandham says, "Well,
[2:14:31] this one said this. Moody said this.
[2:14:33] Moody said this." Brother Brham says,
[2:14:34] "What do they have to do with this?
[2:14:41] It's the word.
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; That's who's come in our midst.
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; Now
[2:14:47] hear you him. That's who we're to look
[2:14:48] to. The word, not our enthusiasm or
[2:14:50] something. So the message is not about
[2:14:52] getting us all enthused.
[2:14:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes there's things where
[2:14:57] that that's been wrong. You know, you've
[2:14:59] get people that are they're always
[2:15:00] conspiracy theorist.
[2:15:03] The government's doing this. The
[2:15:04] government's doing that. The
[2:15:06] government's doing this. the government.
[2:15:08] &gt;&gt; I don't have time for that stuff.
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; I'm going to be honest with you. I don't
[2:15:10] got time for it.
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; I don't want to sit and listen to it.
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; I don't have time for it.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; Good preaching.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; You choose what you're going to give
[2:15:19] time to
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; because let me tell you what, them
[2:15:21] conspiracy theories are spirits.
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; Eventually, you'll be questioning
[2:15:26] everything else.
[2:15:30] &gt;&gt; Let me share this why it's coming. Then
[2:15:32] somebody that sent all this stuff about
[2:15:34] flat earth stuff
[2:15:36] and it pulled up. I was laying, you
[2:15:39] know, I'm very choosy about what I watch
[2:15:41] and what I look and give myself my time
[2:15:43] to. I don't like my thoughts
[2:15:44] interrupted. I don't like the channels
[2:15:46] I'm studying in interrupted. No, that's
[2:15:48] me. You can say, "Brother Sam, you pick
[2:15:50] your one or more. I know the veins that
[2:15:51] I'm studying in for the Thursdays, the
[2:15:53] Sundays, and meetings. I know all the
[2:15:55] and I don't want I don't want to be I
[2:15:56] don't want my my channels and what God
[2:15:59] has placed for here. I I don't my
[2:16:00] interest." So there's there's a lot of
[2:16:01] things I don't want things taking my
[2:16:03] thoughts away.
[2:16:05] But I got my wife started pulling up
[2:16:07] some of them. This person was sinning
[2:16:08] left and right.
[2:16:12] And I I was sitting laying on a couch on
[2:16:15] a Sunday evening. This is years ago. I
[2:16:18] sat up on that couch. I said, "Honey,
[2:16:21] the same spirits
[2:16:23] that are behind that are the same devils
[2:16:26] on that believe the sign."
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Absolutely.
[2:16:30] Absolutely.
[2:16:31] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't but about a few months
[2:16:34] turns of the clock.
[2:16:36] They no longer were standing for the
[2:16:39] message.
[2:16:41] I'm telling you, it's devils.
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; I'm not just talking about flat earth.
[2:16:45] I'm talking about spirits that want to
[2:16:46] lead and take people astray. You know,
[2:16:49] it's a spirit that would even get in
[2:16:50] your mind and say, "Oh, he's over the
[2:16:51] top. This message is over the top. You
[2:16:54] don't need to." That's not God telling
[2:16:56] you that. That's right.
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; If I've presented the word to you right
[2:17:00] here and I've only got to a certain
[2:17:02] place, but presenting the word that the
[2:17:04] anointing follows the blood with what?
[2:17:07] Later scripture coming in there. You've
[2:17:09] got to apply the blood
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; to your life.
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; You've got to take this message and
[2:17:14] apply it to your life.
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; You've got to take it and come under it.
[2:17:19] It had to apply the blood to the right
[2:17:22] ear
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; so they could hear the right way. had to
[2:17:25] apply it to the right thumb so they
[2:17:27] could handle the right way. Had to apply
[2:17:29] it to the right big toe. It had to be
[2:17:31] applied to their lives. And once the
[2:17:34] blood of the consecration was applied,
[2:17:37] then the anointing could come on their
[2:17:39] life.
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandham in the token
[2:17:42] message says you must apply the blood
[2:17:46] before the spirit will come.
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; What does it mean to apply the blood? It
[2:17:51] means to obey the voice
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; of the blood which is the word
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; and submit to it and let the word let it
[2:18:00] cleanse you.
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; Let it come under that blood. Submit to
[2:18:04] it. Don't don't wrestle to with it. But
[2:18:07] you see this is where in our hearts
[2:18:08] let's stand.
[2:18:10] This is where in our hearts
[2:18:15] brother Brandham one of one of the
[2:18:16] places
[2:18:18] in the message
[2:18:20] the comforter
[2:18:22] brother Ram will take that scripture of
[2:18:24] whom the world cannot receive.
[2:18:27] Now brother Bram will really dive into
[2:18:28] that in a church age book.
[2:18:31] But in that message the comforter
[2:18:33] brother Brandham says see whom the world
[2:18:34] can't receive. He said see what it is if
[2:18:37] you still love the world.
[2:18:40] He can't come.
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; Say, "Brother Sam, well, how do I get
[2:18:45] rid of that love of the world?" That
[2:18:47] because well, that love is arising from
[2:18:49] that first nature.
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; But remember, the prophet tells us in
[2:18:53] souls in prison. Now, when God can get
[2:18:56] that first nature to agree with his
[2:18:59] word, he kills it
[2:19:02] and raises up
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; that new nature
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; on the inside. Because that new nature
[2:19:09] is that seed. It's that womb, that
[2:19:12] pre-prepared ground for the word to fall
[2:19:14] in. You know what happens when the when
[2:19:16] the word I you know you know how it is
[2:19:18] when God got a hold of your life and
[2:19:20] begin to draw your life and man you're
[2:19:22] you're going through I mean you're just
[2:19:25] in love with him. You're not even you're
[2:19:26] not even you're not even worried about
[2:19:28] at first like where am I at? What am I
[2:19:29] doing? You just you're just in you're
[2:19:30] caught up with him.
[2:19:31] &gt;&gt; Right. That's right.
[2:19:35] and you're watching how the word you're
[2:19:37] just you're feeding you're you're taking
[2:19:38] in the word and you're watching things
[2:19:40] just desires just flee out of your life
[2:19:44] &gt;&gt; so
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; it's not something you're trying to do
[2:19:46] but what what's doing it you're applying
[2:19:48] the blood
[2:19:49] &gt;&gt; that is so good
[2:19:50] &gt;&gt; as you're giving yourself to the word
[2:19:52] the word the word it's a bleeding word
[2:19:55] that holds cleansing power
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; it begins to cleanse you're like I don't
[2:19:59] know why don't I mean it's like maybe
[2:20:00] you you know all of a sudden you you
[2:20:02] like a certain thing or doing and you're
[2:20:04] It's not even really it just it flees
[2:20:06] the the actual the desire what is what's
[2:20:08] doing that it's the blood that's
[2:20:10] cleansing
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; and as the blood is being applied the
[2:20:14] word is being applied to your life. This
[2:20:16] is why, listen friends, listen.
[2:20:18] This is why yes, it's a late hour and
[2:20:22] it's a time to be very serious and to be
[2:20:24] very urgent, but to understand that even
[2:20:27] if we were we were sitting right here
[2:20:29] before the word this morning and if you
[2:20:31] said, "Brother Samuel, I still have some
[2:20:33] things that I like
[2:20:36] that I enjoy."
[2:20:38] Well, you know what?
[2:20:40] Don't misunderstand me, but I'll say,
[2:20:42] "God bless you for being honest.
[2:20:45] But now that honesty,
[2:20:48] take it to the blood.
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; Submit to the word of God.
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:20:53] &gt;&gt; And begin to say, "Lord, cleanse me."
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; See, God's not just coming to cleanse
[2:20:59] you of attributes like we talked about,
[2:21:02] you know, makeup and shorts and other
[2:21:04] those are attributes. Smoking, drinking,
[2:21:06] those are all attributes
[2:21:08] of one symptom, unbelief.
[2:21:12] That's what the blood come to do is deal
[2:21:15] with the root of the problem is unbelief
[2:21:17] and bring us to a genuine faith in God's
[2:21:20] word where it comes to the place God
[2:21:23] brings us to that place that all the
[2:21:25] only desire Lord I just want to please
[2:21:28] you
[2:21:29] &gt;&gt; our lives have been employed by the
[2:21:31] spirit of God put into service the
[2:21:33] anointing has put us into service and we
[2:21:37] see the word working in our life we see
[2:21:39] that our lives have been have been
[2:21:42] changed. It's it's not just that, well,
[2:21:44] I don't smoke no more. I don't drink no
[2:21:47] more. I listen, I thank God for that.
[2:21:49] That's sanctification.
[2:21:51] &gt;&gt; But I'm going to ask you, do you love
[2:21:52] him?
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me, friends?
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; Do you love him?
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; Do you want to serve him with all your
[2:22:02] heart?
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; Do you want to be one with him?
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:11] because it's more than just well I used
[2:22:12] to smoke I don't smoke no more I used to
[2:22:14] drink I that there's it's deeper than
[2:22:16] that
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; but has he become the love of your life
[2:22:24] when he's become the very love of your
[2:22:26] life that's where the anointing has
[2:22:29] followed the blood
[2:22:33] &gt;&gt; listen friends he's not here God hasn't
[2:22:36] come and if you
[2:22:38] isn't about shaming
[2:22:40] It's about being united.
[2:22:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:43] &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil misinterpret the
[2:22:44] word. It's about uniting. We're We're
[2:22:46] going somewhere.
[2:22:47] &gt;&gt; I'm not planning on staying here.
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; This is This is not my home. I'm You
[2:22:52] know, I I'm looking forward to the
[2:22:54] change. I'm looking forward to the
[2:22:56] rapture. I'm expecting my daddy to walk
[2:22:58] in any morning.
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; I'm expecting my loved ones. I'm
[2:23:03] expecting to see Brother Herb, Sister
[2:23:05] Joe,
[2:23:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Carper. I'm expecting to see our
[2:23:08] loved ones. Amen.
[2:23:09] &gt;&gt; That's went on. I'm expecting that.
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; But there's a question. Do you love him?
[2:23:19] Is he your everything?
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; Now I realize, friends, sometimes
[2:23:27] love it can sometimes get a little cold.
[2:23:30] And if it does,
[2:23:33] with that being in your heart, you'll
[2:23:34] say, "God, I want to rekindle that,
[2:23:37] Lord.
[2:23:38] Because your desire is I don't want
[2:23:40] anything between me and him.
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; Because really, where are you getting
[2:23:43] that desire from? That's from him.
[2:23:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandon says the
[2:23:48] statue of a perfect man, one of the
[2:23:50] opening quotes, he said, "Anyone who's
[2:23:51] ever really come and fallen in love with
[2:23:53] the Lord Jesus Christ, it's something
[2:23:54] about it." He said, "You just can't get
[2:23:56] enough of him."
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; That is so true.
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; You can't get enough of him.
[2:24:03] So I ask you to evaluate if if if if
[2:24:05] it's become that oh church and oh here
[2:24:08] in the same old thing you might need to
[2:24:10] evaluate
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; if it's become something to where that
[2:24:14] oh it's just those people and that
[2:24:16] evaluate listen your soul is worth you
[2:24:20] evaluating
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; as much as you would check the reviews
[2:24:24] on a restaurant on Yelp before ever
[2:24:27] spending money. You will you will take
[2:24:30] time. Don't tell me you don't do it. I
[2:24:32] know many of you do it. I do it, too.
[2:24:34] &gt;&gt; I want to know when I go into an area, I
[2:24:36] want to know what are they saying about
[2:24:38] the stars on this restaurant.
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; Why don't you let the Holy Spirit say,
[2:24:43] "Lord, what about in my life?"
[2:24:48] &gt;&gt; Is my life lining up with those stars
[2:24:49] that Brother Ronnie preached about last
[2:24:51] week?
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; Is it lining up? Is it pressing on to
[2:24:54] the high calling? Oh, friends, God
[2:24:57] didn't come to just give us good
[2:24:58] messages. Right.
[2:24:59] &gt;&gt; God didn't come to give us just, you
[2:25:01] know, me just, you know, just to massage
[2:25:03] our shoulders and mind make us feel
[2:25:05] good. That ain't what the message is
[2:25:06] about.
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; The message is to call us up higher.
[2:25:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:10] &gt;&gt; It's called us up higher.
[2:25:13] &gt;&gt; You love him this morning.
[2:25:15] &gt;&gt; Just let the spirit of God just let him
[2:25:17] just evaluate. I know. I know. Just let
[2:25:19] him evaluate. Be honest. Be sober. This
[2:25:21] is a moment to be sober. to be honest
[2:25:23] and to let the spirit of God just just
[2:25:25] move through your life. Even as we'll
[2:25:28] take this word, God carries and we'll
[2:25:29] leave from here. I'll pray with anybody
[2:25:31] wants to need prayer, sickness, or you
[2:25:33] you you need you have a need in your
[2:25:35] life, we're here to pray with you. But
[2:25:36] don't let this word pass from you.
[2:25:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:43] &gt;&gt; Like the man who was coming around the
[2:25:45] mountain and when the one was bragging
[2:25:46] how close he could come to the edge,
[2:25:48] this other little guy said, "I don't see
[2:25:50] how far I can get to the edge." She
[2:25:52] said, "I I just stay climb tight to the
[2:25:53] mountain."
[2:25:54] &gt;&gt; And the guy said, "You're the guy I want
[2:25:56] to take me around.
[2:25:57] &gt;&gt; We don't need anybody proven skills.
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[2:26:01] &gt;&gt; I just want to stay close to him."
[2:26:04] &gt;&gt; I want to stay close to him. Because
[2:26:06] I'll tell you why. If there's any any
[2:26:08] life to come, if there's any birth, if
[2:26:10] there's any transformation, it's going
[2:26:12] to come from him.
[2:26:13] &gt;&gt; And it'll come through surrendered
[2:26:15] vessels.
[2:26:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:26:17] &gt;&gt; Is that how you want to be as a husband?
[2:26:19] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. as a mom, as a dad,
[2:26:20] grandparent, want to be a real example.
[2:26:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Samuel, my grandchild or
[2:26:26] my child, you know, there the blood's
[2:26:27] not been applied to them yet. But
[2:26:29] remember, the prophet said you're to be
[2:26:30] their Holy Ghost until they get old
[2:26:32] enough to receive it.
[2:26:33] &gt;&gt; You know what that means? That you're to
[2:26:35] apply it over their life.
[2:26:37] &gt;&gt; If there's things that you would not do
[2:26:39] in your own life, don't buy it for them.
[2:26:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:26:43] &gt;&gt; Don't condone it for them. That's called
[2:26:45] applying
[2:26:46] &gt;&gt; the blood.
[2:26:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, they don't understand this.
[2:26:50] Applying the blood is you who has the
[2:26:53] blood on display in your heart by the
[2:26:55] spirit of God. Don't compromise. Hold
[2:26:58] the standard.
[2:27:01] You love him.
[2:27:03] &gt;&gt; Let's pray.
[2:27:07] As every head is bowed, I want every eye
[2:27:08] to be closed. Please, no looking around.
[2:27:13] Wonder how many would want to just be
[2:27:14] remembered in prayer. And I just put it
[2:27:16] in that way.
[2:27:18] You let the spirit of God just speak to
[2:27:19] your heart this morning. Sure. I know we
[2:27:22] all need to go. There's not I don't want
[2:27:24] to say all, but we want to go deeper.
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:27:29] &gt;&gt; I want I wanted I want to be more like
[2:27:30] him. I believe that.
[2:27:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:32] &gt;&gt; But maybe there's hands this morning to
[2:27:34] say, "Lord,
[2:27:37] you know how you spoke to my heart.
[2:27:40] I want the blood applied because I know
[2:27:42] the anointing will follow the blood.
[2:27:49] Brother Samuel, is it that simple? Yeah,
[2:27:52] it's that simple. I was going to read
[2:27:54] you a quote here, but there's no way I
[2:27:56] even got near it.
[2:27:59] Maybe I'll read it or play it for you
[2:28:00] next week.
[2:28:02] Just a simple prayer, Brother Brandham
[2:28:04] guides them through at the end of token.
[2:28:07] It's that simple.
[2:28:09] Say, Lord, take everything from my life
[2:28:13] that's unlike you, Lord. Yes,
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; Lord God. Take every desire.
[2:28:18] Take everything, Lord, that would
[2:28:21] separate, Lord, that would keep. Lord,
[2:28:24] let the blood I I submit to this word.
[2:28:27] I submit to you, Lord.
[2:28:32] [Music]
[2:28:34] I want to be filled, Lord, through and
[2:28:36] through.
[2:28:38] Lord, my hands, Lord God,
[2:28:41] is up, Lord Jesus, as well. Yes, Lord.
[2:28:45] &gt;&gt; Lord, I pray, Lord Jesus.
[2:28:48] I'm asking you, Lord, to forgive me,
[2:28:50] Lord, for my wrongs, Lord.
[2:28:54] Lord God, cleanse us, Lord. I pray,
[2:28:57] Lord, right here this morning.
[2:29:00] Take us deeper, Lord. I I want, Lord, a
[2:29:03] refilling.
[2:29:05] &gt;&gt; I want a refilling.
[2:29:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:08] It's not just something Lord that we
[2:29:10] come to just every so many days but God
[2:29:13] to realize we have an access.
[2:29:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:20] &gt;&gt; Oh God sometimes when life is so
[2:29:22] overwhelming
[2:29:24] sometimes Lord God with the trials and
[2:29:27] the test
[2:29:30] the burdens of life but Lord
[2:29:33] we don't want to just wait till it gets
[2:29:35] to that point.
[2:29:37] But I'm thankful that God,
[2:29:40] you call us. There's a yearning. There's
[2:29:43] a desire.
[2:29:45] I want a fresh refilling. Lord, I know,
[2:29:48] Lord, throughout this building, Lord
[2:29:50] God, there's no doubt many, Lord God,
[2:29:52] that Father, you have
[2:29:55] so sealed their lives.
[2:29:58] But that longing is
[2:30:01] over and over they continue to present
[2:30:03] themselves before the word
[2:30:06] because they want to be a partaker of
[2:30:08] your divine nature.
[2:30:11] There's a desire, Lord God, to continue
[2:30:13] to draw down into their lives,
[2:30:18] more of you, Lord, to allow our lives to
[2:30:22] be evaluated, to be scanned, as it were,
[2:30:25] by the word.
[2:30:27] Lord, where are my shortcomings?
[2:30:30] Where am I falling short, Lord? Where
[2:30:33] can I pick it up, Lord?
[2:30:37] Lord, the weak areas, Lord God, places,
[2:30:41] Lord God, like your prophet said, where
[2:30:42] the devil's got a punch coming, keep it
[2:30:44] covered with the blood at all times,
[2:30:47] &gt;&gt; Lord God, recognizing that as sons and
[2:30:49] daughters of God, we're not super people
[2:30:53] as far as in our outward, but Lord God,
[2:30:55] it's that on the inside when the blood
[2:30:58] has been applied and the spirit has come
[2:31:00] and the prophet said, "You're a super
[2:31:02] super super super super super super
[2:31:05] human being because it's supernatural
[2:31:08] life
[2:31:09] living on the inside.
[2:31:13] Supernatural, Lord God, how you move
[2:31:15] through our lives, Lord God, how you
[2:31:18] lead us in your word. It's supernatural,
[2:31:20] Lord God, to wear, Father, when we are
[2:31:22] down, Lord God,
[2:31:25] and you, Lord Jesus, would send one of
[2:31:28] your angels by, Lord God, and drop a
[2:31:31] word to us, Lord.
[2:31:34] Oh God, how we thank you Lord.
[2:31:37] We love you, Father.
[2:31:41] How Lord God,
[2:31:44] how we're thankful. We're thankful every
[2:31:47] time you've corrected us, Lord.
[2:31:49] &gt;&gt; Not just in church. No, we don't have to
[2:31:51] wait till we get to church to be
[2:31:54] corrected.
[2:31:56] But Lord, to be so in tune with you, as
[2:31:59] the prophet said, Lord, I want to be so
[2:32:01] in tune with you to where I would know
[2:32:03] the least little thing
[2:32:07] that you would be grieved at.
[2:32:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; I want to know that way. I want to know
[2:32:12] you in that way. Like a husband and a
[2:32:14] wife would know one another. No, he
[2:32:15] likes this. He don't like that. He likes
[2:32:17] this. He likes this this way. He likes
[2:32:18] it on this side of the plate. Fork on
[2:32:20] this side. Can't turn this way. She
[2:32:22] knows. Oh, God. Granted, Lord Jesus,
[2:32:27] this is our desire, Lord. We want to
[2:32:30] please you.
[2:32:34] How wonderful it is, Lord,
[2:32:38] to be
[2:32:40] in fellowship with you.
[2:32:42] &gt;&gt; Now, Lord God,
[2:32:45] I pray behind every hand that was
[2:32:47] lifted,
[2:32:49] Lord God, may you move down. I pray Lord
[2:32:52] Jesus and according to every request
[2:32:55] that's on the hearts of your children,
[2:32:58] Lord God, as they Lord would believe
[2:33:00] your word and say amen to the word.
[2:33:04] Oh God, they're not ashamed of the word
[2:33:06] but to say amen to it. Lord, I give
[2:33:09] myself to this word. Lord, cleanse me,
[2:33:12] Lord God. Let the word cleanse every
[2:33:14] desire from my life. Lord, I want to be
[2:33:17] one with you, Lord God.
[2:33:19] I want to be one, Lord God.
[2:33:22] &gt;&gt; Maybe, Lord, his hearts are setting
[2:33:23] right here that God, they have that
[2:33:25] testimony.
[2:33:27] &gt;&gt; I've been cleansed of this, cleansed of
[2:33:29] that. God has cleansed me and set me
[2:33:31] free of habits, but Lord God, they
[2:33:33] realize
[2:33:35] that love is really not where it needs
[2:33:37] to be.
[2:33:39] That's right. May you, Lord, I pray God,
[2:33:41] take them deeper, Lord God, through
[2:33:44] their willingness, Lord God, an
[2:33:46] acknowledgment
[2:33:48] to say, Lord,
[2:33:51] I want to be one with you. The same one
[2:33:54] that justified me, the same one who
[2:33:56] sanctified me. It's all with the purpose
[2:33:59] to be united with you.
[2:34:02] Lord God, I want real joy in my life.
[2:34:05] Maybe that's your prayer. I want real
[2:34:07] joy in my life.
[2:34:10] Lord God, I've served you, but it's only
[2:34:12] been under a law and under justice. If I
[2:34:15] do this or if I don't do that, if I do
[2:34:17] this or I don't do that, God, I pray.
[2:34:20] May their eyes be turned to look away to
[2:34:23] Jesus.
[2:34:24] May they see Lord God it's not about
[2:34:27] their dues
[2:34:29] and living under a fear but may they
[2:34:32] Lord God accept
[2:34:34] the great provision that was made.
[2:34:39] Accept it.
[2:34:41] yield the Lord God of their lives that
[2:34:43] the spirit of God
[2:34:46] could move down, Lord, in the very
[2:34:47] depths of their life and bring that real
[2:34:51] joy down on the inside, that real peace,
[2:34:54] that real rest of the Holy Spirit, that
[2:34:56] token life, Lord God, where the love of
[2:34:59] God burns within our hearts, Lord, in a
[2:35:01] love affair.
[2:35:03] Grant, Lord,
[2:35:06] that's why you came. That's why you went
[2:35:08] to Calvary. That's why you rose on the
[2:35:11] Easter morning.
[2:35:14] And that's why you sent this message
[2:35:17] is to bring us
[2:35:19] back into that place of perfect
[2:35:22] fellowship
[2:35:23] under the blood.
[2:35:26] &gt;&gt; A people that where the Holy Spirit
[2:35:29] coming in this hour by way of the token
[2:35:33] clears a people for rapture.
[2:35:38] They've already got their ticket. the
[2:35:39] token. They've cleared all security and
[2:35:43] they're awaiting at the gate.
[2:35:46] Oh God, grant it, Lord.
[2:35:49] [Music]
[2:35:50] &gt;&gt; Grant it, Lord. Grant it, Father.
[2:35:53] [Music]
[2:35:54] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ.

[2:44:55] It's my joy to honor you,

[2:45:05] I
[2:45:08] am a free
