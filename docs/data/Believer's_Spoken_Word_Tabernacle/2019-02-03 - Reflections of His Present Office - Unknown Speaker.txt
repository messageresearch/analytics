that's moved into our lives and one day and I say more than the more and more any moment we're gonna be standing in the presence of the very God of glory amen who has done to work in our life and where we are longing to dwell in his presence amen redeemed by the blood of the Lamb we just thank God this morning a man to be able to be here we just want to approach the word this morning if we could musicians thank you sir we enjoyed the service here we want to look in Hebrews chapter 2 you would like to turn there and then won't have a word of Prayer as we prepare to enter into the word hebrews chapter two and let's let's just begin reading here verse 7 thou madest him a little lower than the angels thou crown dust him with glory and honor and did set him over the works of thy hands thou has put all things in subjection under his feet or in that he put all in subjection under him he left nothing that is not put under him but now we see not yet all things put under him but we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the Angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings amen let's just let's just ask the blessing upon the word this morning or Jesus as we Lord would endeavor Lord to approach or God your word this morning Lord we know that father without you without the unction of the Holy Spirit or God though our intentions would be ever so good but yet father we know God would would leave Lord empty Lord but father we believe or God that you who is the word Lord who giving this word and moved upon the holy prophets of old dropped by your Holy Spirit Lord and and father as we stand here gathered together this morning we're in need of you Lord o God the author of eternal life that you would come Lord and you would take us O God in your this morning band break the bread of life to us or God may you speak to every need Lord as we place it before you this morning whatever may be upon the heart O God the needs that are throughout this congregation Lord of people this morning that are gathered here may there not be one that would leave oh God without that need in their life God fully spoken to Lord and met Lord God by you or father you're the only one or God that is the saddest Fire Lord Oh God we just pray that you would come Lord anoint our lips and our ears and may you find all God receptive hearts or God to your presence I pray Lord just continue to ride in upon us now as we look into your word O God and take control father be the speaker here this morning we pray father and hear through us for we asking in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen god bless yous your being seated I want to just want to take the thought here this morning on the present the present office but I'd like to speak on reflections of his present office and to know that the Lord Jesus Christ here as he came down God coming down creating a tabernacle for himself to come dwell in order to redeem you and I to bring us back to himself God made himself known he had stepped in two bodies that he had created made himself known to Abraham where he would pick up the dust and bring creation and come and speak to Abraham and yet we find and we identify other places in the scripture but not within that could he come and and redeem us but he had to become like we were and so to see how that God is we were looking at some weeks ago the great the great condescension of Almighty God of hound that he condescended to become one of us to in order to bring us back home to where to where he is and we look at this of how that when he is in his earthly pilgrimage as he was here we find that has it was made known John would declare behold the lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world at that at that present time he had not entered into there had not been an offering up of the Lamb he had not went to Calvary but once going to Calvary to offer up his life and pour out his soul as an offering on our behalf and to take our sins away and to pay that sin doubt and then to think of how that he he raised up there on that third third day and he appeared to the disciples and when he appeared to them remember they were in disarray they did not they were not connecting what had taken place and here he begins to make known to them and gathers them by the promise and he is is is there with them and he makes known to them Here I am going to ascend to the Father and when I ascend to the Father I'm gonna send back the Holy Ghost and to see how that then as he entered into this the mediatorial work and there there in the present office as our high priest he's there on that present office on our behalf and brother Branham would say it like this and I just want to quote this here he refers over into revelations 15 3 where he says they sing the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the lamb saying great and marvellous are thy works Lord God Almighty just and true are thy ways thou king of saints he says do you see it the lamb the high priest holding his blood as an tone meant on the mercy-seat for our sins is the Lord God Almighty that is his present office that is what he is doing now pleading his blood for our sins but one day that lamb will become the Lion of the tribe of Judah and he will come forth and power and glory and take his authority and to reign as king he's coming he's a coming king of this earth he is the coming king of this earth and he says it does not say that he's not the king now for he is our King king of the Saints right now it is a spiritual Kingdom it's not of this world system even as we're not of this world that's the reason we act different from the world our citizenship is in heaven we reflect the spirit of the world of our rebirth where Jesus is the king that is why our women do not dress in men's clothing or cut their hair or used all those cosmetics and other things that the world likes so much that is why our men don't drink and smoke and carry on in sin our Dominion is the dominion over sin and it is enforced through the power in the Spirit of Christ that dwells in us and we know that every Kingdom on earth is going to be torn down but ours will remain we see that even in the parallel the type of even how Daniel would speak of that that this great stone that smote the image will smite that image we see that that stone itself in just for our lives by the true new birth of the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's mites the hold of the world upon our life and it grows within our life and we see that we see within our lives I want to take here in this place reflections of his present office because when we look at this the Lord Jesus made it clear before he ever went to Calvary he let it be known you know when he was speaking of even the work that he was going to enter into he would tell the disciples and he would speak of what was to be a present and among them in their lives and he says that there should be by this of the love of God between them he says and by this they shall know that you are my disciples indeed and when we look at this scripture we understand it can be made to be something very carnal but yet the reality is it is that the love of God by the Holy Spirit in our life it brings us into that place to where that our life has changed and we have a desire to please the Lord and we look even to where that with that pulsing in our lives we see the value not to allow anything to remain in our life as God brings it to our attention or to allow things to come between us between brothers or sisters or what have you it's the love of God working and jesus said when they see this then they know you're my disciples and I believe that that is a that is a declaration because though that men and others cannot see him but yet what they see is a reality and should see a reality of a Living God being reflected in our life when we think of that of how that we are to see him brother Branham would say it like this he says when he says we see him he says as he is opening himself in the word he said and then he says I look he says as the word is going forth I see you taking that word in he said and then that life that word in moving in your life he says then he says I'm seeing him being reflected through your life so it is a life of Christ to this be reflected and when you think of that term reflection we realize that it is not our light but it is Christ the Lord Jesus who is our light we have no light of our own but yet by God's grace we have within us the ability not our ability but by that seed of God on the inside to be able to reflect Christ who he is in this generation and so it is something that will catch that you know it's like a signal in this room there's a signal that goes from this little transmitter that I have and it goes over there to that receiver you don't see that signal and but yet you know there is something that is taking place because you are hearing it in your ears you don't see it but you hear it and that's the same thing when we look at God Himself is a spirit and God Himself is invisible but God makes himself known and reflects himself through visible forms it's it's God in morphe it's God reflecting himself and remember when he reflects himself it cannot just reflect something of just what he was but it must reflect what he is and whatever he is will also identify what he was you see it's an advancement of that life and so this is where when we look at this in the scripture a reflection of his present office to recognize that through the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ we have been brought in and made co-workers in Redemption with him there is one objective and I want you to think of this there's one objective that the Lord Jesus Christ that here God coming to this earth there's one objective that he had he said the Son of Man is come to seek and save that which is lost that was the objective there was anything else there was no other objective but along the way in that objective we find out that how they were sick that were healed does that right Devils were cast out all of the many things that were there to vindicate the Living God was present and how that he manifests himself as the true sacrifice the true atonement and then to see how that in the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost that in itself the coming of the Holy Ghost is a witness that he is now seated on the throne of God that he indeed is our mediator and that there is a mediatorial ship to where he is going to make good upon the promises in other words it's like when you know electricity is flowing in this building but yet in a certain outlet you are not able to get power yet you know there's power coming into this building but there must be something that is able to take care of the short there's got to be something that's able to cause the circuit to come back together that that life or that electricity can flow and that's the same way it is with the son and daughter of God without the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's like a dead socket but you need to have that energized by the Spirit of God but you cannot do it I cannot do it but there is one who already stood in the gap for you and I there is a mediator there on the throne who by God's grace was able here to be able to fill that gap to take away that breach and to manifest when the baptism of the Holy Ghost comes upon your life that is the consummating of the breach of your life you're tied right back into his mind as you were in the beginning and this is why that when we look at this there is a reflection of the present office of the high priests that indeed he is there and is all-powerful you believe that so when we find this appalled would you know in these scriptures Paul dealing and pulling from Psalms 22 and Paul would it would express here but we see Jesus and Paul would would find it when you look in them in the book of Hebrews you'll find it in other places but Paul here the revelation has been known of how that God the Lord God Almighty became one of us and took upon the likeness of sinful flesh you'll find Paul bring this to you and I Paul will lay out so clearly in the Hebrews in the Hebrews a book there of the media toriel work of that working of the high priest and when we we think of it that in this great working of how that we see Jesus and he he became the example one you know he's the reflection but the remm said like this in the indictment he's the example son of what God intends every son and daughter of God to be to think that he he adorned himself in that same kind of a garment and then to look at how that within it you know how that he himself was able to bring to us of the access that you and I though all his sons and daughters of God but yet he brings the access that we might be recognized as sons and daughters of God you recognize that a person can live and may be right out on a barstool there are a son and daughter of God but they have not been quickened you with me future home you were always saved you see the reality your destiny has the son and daughter of God was never in question you understand God himself all the dead the destiny was already set in God and the pathways and whatever that came about but yet he himself had to move and raise up that son and daughter on the inside in order for you and I'd to be recognized as a son and daughter of God because you couldn't say as a son and daughter of God and drinking and smoking and running around and living like the world dressing like the world you could not call yourself a son and daughter of God you might you know you might say it but you see underneath this word you know there is not an authority in your life now you might look at it this morning and let me just preach to you for a moment you might look at and say well I want it but are you willing to get rid and your life down because if you're not willing to lay your life down then God's not gonna move any further but if you're willing to lay your life down you say what are you talking about your selfishness of everything and lay it down and allow God to move on the scene and be gone if you allow him to do that he will manifest his present office to you and then you become a reflection of the press and office of the high threes that indeed there is a mediator there is a lamb that has taken care of my sins there is one who is able to lift me above a life of sin they men so to see this within it brother Randall's in here and I want to just kind of keep this here and bringing this moving it back and forth in the message that out of the Simonian church age brother brems says his purpose now he breaks over into tests and trials his purpose is that after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect be established strengthened and settled I want you to keep in mind this perfect is not talking about your soul I hope you all want seem to be very clear with this this perfect is not talking about our soul his blood took care of that and the life coming back to you and I let me tell you something when that life strikes a son and daughter of God it's not one day I'm gonna be a son and daughter of God we are fully adopted sons and daughters of God when we have been born again of the Spirit of God in other words God ain't given a teaspoon and saying I wonder if you'll be a good boy or girl good girl and I'll give you a little bit more that's not how it works you say is there a maturing there is a maturing but that maturing comes where you operate in the authority that the father has placed in your life has a fully adopted son and daughter of God I wish I could preach on that a little bit but that perfect there it's dealing with a completion within our life it's dealing with all of these things that you and I are going through the tests and trials that we go through even now it's God molding and shaping our lives and he's bringing out of our lives I tell you we God brings out of our life great compassion Lord Ram goes on to say his job said he puts strength in us in that tremendous through tests and trials this is how God puts in strength so this is God's way he says he goes on to say he said now you see he himself suffered he learned obedience by the things that he suffered he was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered he goes into Hebrews five and eight nine though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey Him Lorain whitsel like this he says in plain language the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering and according to Paul he has left his church a measure of suffering that they - by their faith in God while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection he's talking about a completion without dwelling on this this morning but the random deals with Hal he says the success of my ministry has been able when I've been able to enter into the feeling of that one I'm praying for and sympathize with them he said then God comes on the scene and brother Branham would say it like this in another place these are just a little tidbits to drop in here brother Graham talks about a mother who she felt led of the Lord to pray for a baby and she said well you know brother brems here I'm not gonna pray for the baby and so forth but she can't get away from that burden and so she prays for that little baby and then brother bream said here when they come on the platform the Prophet bun denieth the inspiration the Holy Ghost calls it out and said you know your baby had this and this and this but God's already healed it he said when that woman that sister prayed for it and brother I've said it just like this he said see what it is that mother would have had more compassion on that situation that I ever could have got to what is God doing it's a body it's a body he you see God used that situation would not have heard the pear the prayer of the prophet he would have but you see God moved on the scene were put that burden on that sister's heart and she entered in in prayer and God answered that prayer mine so when we look at this you know that sonship and we find the tests and trials you know when we go through the tests and trials brother Graham says what we actually come out with we have passed in through schools of suffering and you know when we come through and in these areas here you look at the Lord Jesus Christ of how that God we said it here some weeks ago he could have went straight to Calvary but you see he would have never had the understanding that came with all of the suffering the Bible didn't say that the captain of our salvation would be made perfect through suffering it said through sufferings so there were multiple ones brother Branham told us he said he went through and knows what it's like to feel ignored right all the all these things that you and I would look over and say well mile the King of glory he would need to experience that evidently he needed to experience it he experienced all of these things not for the people out there but that was for you and I aren't you glad about it you see when we looked at it being the son his sonship did not exempt him from suffering it didn't exempt him as a matter of fact the position of which he was to fulfill the captain of our salvation required this to think of how that you know when you look it's a necessary completing he he suffered he there was a great suffering for us but then we find through the sufferings of the Lord Jesus that through these sufferings that was a perfecting as we just read of the very character of the Lord Jesus Christ and when we we think of this within looking at it I want you to think of it here if we could just transport back to the Garden of Eden and you find that this lovely couple were there within God's God's Eden there with a perfect understanding of the love of God there was no fear around there wasn't any torment there there wasn't anything of that nature but to see how that when we know that day in and day out that how that you know Satan would have pressed upon Eve in that of a serpent you know friends she could have ended that battle if she just would have taken it right to the word now I'm not going to say and I think you would agree with me we recognize that I don't believe that Genesis 3 was just a one-day event how long he pressed on her I don't know come on somebody because you know that then remember Potiphar's wife the bible says she pressed upon joseph remember look at Delilah the Bible says she pressed upon Samson so there was pressing upon now now when we go back to the Garden of Eden there's not been a fall yet but to think how that things begin to drop in upon Eve and to think how that things begin to get stirred to where that she begins to desire what Satan is actually presenting to her there is a measure in that of suffering but yet she doesn't know what it really is to suffer Satan is presenting to her there something you don't know about so right and then we find if if it would have just been brought back to the word there weren't a Beneful it's you know it comes down to that reality it's got to come back to the word that's why the scripture would tell you and I cast down imaginations cast down reasonings and it says that we are to bring every thought and to obedience of Christ and when we look at this the effect of suffering if there's a purifying remember the the Word of God teaches us that suffering is a purifying it's a purging now look here in 2nd Corinthians 1 I'm just going to move through this quickly in 2nd Corinthians 1 verse 3 through verse 7 Paul says blessed be God even the father of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of mercies and the God of all comfort who comforted us in all our tribulation that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God so here Paul goes on to say for as the sufferings of Christ abound in us so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ and he goes on whether we're afflicted it's for your consolation and salvation which is effectual I want you to catch this phrase which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we suffer or whether we be comforted it is for your consolation and salvation and our hope of you is steadfast knowing that as you are partakers of the suffering so shall you be also of the consolation the infection enduring to think of this here here you have the apostle the prophet there of that age and here he is declaring there to the people of God the believers that we and ourselves are going through tribulation but in your hearing of how that we have gone through tribulation then you are comforted I want you to think of this if there is something if Paul listen to me now if Paul would have not been able to stand the test you know what that would have done to the gospel he was preaching you see this is what credentials is a whole lot more than what a man says it's what he lives its credentials here so Paul remember here when you begin to recognize Paul is noticing and knows that what God is doing through his life that it actually brings comfort to the believers to know I'm not alone because you know the devil will many times try to single out and make you think you're all alone but you recognize that even how God would allow in in humility that the Prophet would even speak of him many of his shortcomings and tests and trials and other things it would speak to you and I water what a glorious message that God has given to us and we can also look at the character here that that brought that and we look and see that God's grace indeed is sufficient you know when you think about testimonies when we give testimonies here within the church those testimonies it's not just you know something off out of the way but you don't know sometimes at that testimony when you've given that there might be somebody sitting right here there might be some of this streaming out there but it is going to help and encourage the rest of the body that's God's Way it's God's Way of comforting one another did not Paul said we look back and we take these things for our in samples they are examples to you and I now to think of this in first Peter chapter 5 just in referencing this how that Peter would speak about the great roaring lion but remember he got his teeth pulled out and he links the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour now the Bible goes on to say whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world in other words you have there is a steadfastness of faith in Christ but in also knowing that there are others who are also facing the same battles this is comforting because it brings us to a place where we recognize that God is God we believe that God is in control but you see what it does it breaks down any statements that the old lugar man wants to make that is though that you're off off on your own it's a comfort to you and I I don't know about you but that's what makes this message so great I know there's some people who well you know we got to cover this what do we got to cover up this message is not highlighting any man the Bible doesn't highlight man that's why it's not a book of man if this message was a man it would highlight man but this message is not there's not the highlighting of of a man it is the revealing of Jesus Christ himself in his supreme deity and authority back in the church and God lets us see the frailty and the weakness of humanity glory be to God now the think of this here James 5 verse 10 through 11 take my brethren the prophets who have spoken in the name of the Lord for an example of suffering affliction and of patient how many are thankful for those examples I am in evidently Paul or James Sina right here take for example my brethren for an example notice verse 11 behold we count them happy which endure ye have heard of the patience of Job and have seen I want you to catch this and seen the end of the Lord that the Lord is very pitiful and of a tender mercy now remember here this is back in the Old Testament Joe being the oldest book in the Bible but yet noticing even though that redemption itself were God becoming one of us taking on a body of smade in the likeness of sinful flesh even though that that has not taken place but yet God himself if we could say like this he was the very high priest of job's faith you with me he was the very hybrid you say how could he be high priest in time remember now he revealed himself to Abraham as Melchizedek that King and priest of the Most High God is that right he already revealed himself this is who he is so now when job's Trials come remember here Ella who first visits him and then you find it how that the Lord would speak to him veiled in the whirlwind and God would take things and speak to job that are very very simple things that you and I step over and when I say simple there's no way you can explain it such as where God would take him and ask him to know do you understand about how the frost is formed do you know who it is that causes the water spouts in the heavens do you understand all this you see what he's doing he is overwhelming job that all these things are taking place without your help you got to remember what he's come to that because job by the conversation he's been around job has drifted from the faith that he had in the sacrifice I know that's a big statement but job has drifted you say how did he drift look how job in the very midst of that book begins to try to justify himself in the midst of his so-called friends or accusers I tell you it matters who you hang around it matters what you listen to are you with me it's just like here we were dealing with music it matters what kind of music you listen to there's a lot of sums that's been wrote hey there's wonderful praise and worship songs but there's a lot of songs whether it's gospel or whatever more that's been wrote that has no bit of victory in it whatsoever it is nothing but a defeatist attitude of where they can't live in overcoming life that don't belong in the house of God because we don't know the Lord Jesus Christ in that way we know him in supreme deity and power we know him as the resurrected one he is an overcomer and manifest his overcoming life in us so to think of how that jeer in the midst of the time of Joe when job's faith itself would drift notice how God comes on the scene and he begins to speak to Jobin let job know I have all of these things on control and so do I have your life under control because you don't know it but I'm the one who asked Satan to consider you our thought lines probably about we would say Lord don't mention my name just I'm okay you know just I'm just okay just being one of yours but you see God coming on the scene through simplicity is able to yoke joke back to the faith that's residing in him that's residing in the sacrifice that he might continue on now when we look at this in the scriptures here in Hebrews chapter 2 verse 16 if we continue he says Paul goes on to say for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the seed of Abraham wherefore in all things it behooves him to be made like unto his brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God don't let that drift from your heart he's of that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God this is his present office and that present office is reflected here on earth through his body when they walked out on the day of Pentecost they had that same life dog the true atonement in them and when they walked out of there they asked them what must we do to be saved Peter took them back and he identifies the coming of the Lord as the true atonement and then they asked him what must we do to be safe and now the way that's been open repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost I'm going to tell you if you ain't got no further and you find yourself not going any further then you need to ask yourself the question where are you sitting now you see you yield as God deals with your life you got to keep yielding if you don't keep yielding and walking on with God and keep giving your life to the Lord yep telling you what your days will be numbered right here I'm not talking about taking you off this earth I'm talking about that it's got to be a faith that comes down on the inside just coming to the church just being associated with a message is not powerful you gotta have that life of the truth helmet dwelling inside of you and then it reflects that he is indeed the mediator because the life gives witness that indeed the debt has been paid the same question settled in me and I am a reflection of that Living God so here it behooves him you say it was a virgin body it was but that virgin body made in the likeness of sinful flesh it was not something that came from between Joseph and Mary is that right but neither could he have went to Calvary in just as he stepped and revealed himself to Abraham couldn't go that way he had to come through the woman why he's redeeming he's claiming back what was lost so he hast he has to redeem that way in order to bring us back now what's this in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people for him that he himself have suffered being tempted he is able to secure them that are tempted now we understand this wasn't an act this was not an act he was tempted he suffered suffered means vexed to undergo a sensible experience and in that he suffered now notice what look at look at this in that he suffered now now it gives him what the ability to do what Sukkur come to the help or aid this is sicker come to the help or the aid of no glory in other words Jesus don't give us sugar pills for our needs he gives us what we need and where we're lacking that's how he's able to secure us to help us notice for the RAM goes into this here in the Hebrew series he says Sakr means to sympathize that's the reason he become this that he might be sympathetic with you who are you have your ups and downs your little ins and outs and your temptations get so great you can't hardly stand it he knows how to sympathize with you now you realize there's a difference between sympathy and empathy empathy means that I don't share the same feelings but I'm able to say ma that's at got to be hard brother but sympathy means I know what you're feeling I know what you're feeling this is what sympathy is it's it's different but yet there is a sympathy and there is an empathy now notice how brother Ram would take this word he knows how to sympathize with you now who is this this is the Lord of glory the same God who spoke in the beginning let there be and it was this is the same God who sent the very the very stars the very planets it's the same Almighty God here now dwelling in a robe of flesh don't lose that now it's that same deity that was there in the beginning now God come down and become one of us the god notice all-powerful dwelling there behind that veil of skin no wonder the scripture would say in Philippians 2 he made himself of no reputation he could have but he didn't he come in such simplicity to where the people missed him that overlooked him he came listen without bearing you know sometimes a person can have you know this particular person their name out there and when their name is put out then there is a reputation that kind of goes before them but here when God came down and took upon a human name for redemption Jesus here God comes down and noticed his name is manifested now is going to be manifested in power and glory through Redemption here is he said I've come in my father's name here is a manifestation of that life that is actually being manifested through the very life of the Lord Jesus Christ so here there is a reputation he's you know what we look at when we see the Lord Jesus Christ what you and I can see is that it's the same Jehovah God of the Old Testament is Jesus Christ of the new he didn't lose any power his nature didn't change but God became one of us hmm my the salmon let's talk about the glory and the honor he received but wait a minute this was before glory and honor and it's the same way in our lives testing trying all of this is before glory and honor it's proving notice he knows how to sympathize with you he sits there to make intercession he sets there to love you and though you go astray he won't forsake you he will still come after you and knock at your heart there's not a bats ladder in the building but what knows that God knocks at his heart daily and he will do it as long as you're immortal on this earth for he's loved you he redeems you he will not lose one but let me just also put a cliff note in here that does not mean that you can do whatever you want to do because if you still have that fault line at home ah I'll tell you right now you're not where you need to be under the blood and I doubt to where the dogs even dealing right now with you the way you ought to be but let me put you to and point you to this really in a real way there is a real hell I said there is a real hell or better Santa I believe this message but is this message the life of Jesus Christ identified in you that's the question not just being associated guarantees no sir it's not just being around open Sam you know I want to but if you're want to it's got to be a surrender I'm talking about his prison office now we're not talking about a high priest who walks around with dainty's and you know it's just walking around with teaspoons of sugar and spinning out you know little cube Elsa we're talking about a God who had manifested himself in power where he said be of good cheer for I have overcome the world glory be to God let's qualify this statement for a moment there's not a backslider in the building one knows God nuts at your heart you recognize brother Rama he'll go on and tell us here and I understand there could be a backsliding I'm getting cold even of a person brother man goes through this and took in many other places in that even when being born of the Spirit of God you can get cold that's backsliding it's not my words that's his you can get cold where you know where you're not giving yourself to the Lord lock you off to you're not praying you're not reading and then again maybe you're praying in your reading but yet the attitude itself is preventing the nutrients of the word from making it down in your life come on somebody it's kind of come deep in here we've got to reflect his present office amen it's got to be a real reflection of that life but you see it can also be when a person God has touched their life but yet they never came to a place of a real true conversion having a real birth in their life and they drift away brother BAM said the prodigal son was a backslider so you now want you to say take this in for a moment there's times where you can see people you can see brothers and sisters you can see different ones maybe it's husband or wife or whatever you can sometimes see things and coldness you can feel it in your own life and there's a battle against that there's all sorts of things to try to take away our attention and to try to divert them let me just say this to you part of our maturity isn't that we're not tempted and isn't that you don't make mistakes but I'm gonna tell you this right here part of our maturity is where you start recognizing the devil and every one of his tricks God told Israel when you get in the land down there pictures and there's times there's been wrong behaviors family strange you need to pull those pictures down get rid of those things because what you see is that when you prostrate before them it gives you a wrong attitude and our own slant and our own view you see that's not something where you're going out oh I'm drinking us no this is something where it gets down to the height from a charity where you recognize I don't want anything that hinders me from pleasing him and serving his will that's maturity hallelujah we need to be like those in the book of Acts where the Word of God multiplied the Bible said they brought all their books and Birnam come home somebody oh my so you just see when we look at this here brother been talking about that that backslider you see brother BAM even brings it in this manner here even to where a person can begin to speak negative remember when you go to talking like that negative he said you've excellent right there you're getting cold so none though it's this as our high priest he stands there to intercede for you and I and to think even in times of coldness and even in the time where there are lives that are not fully progressing and have not fully moved in to that divine assurance of the new birth he is sitting there to intercede on our behalf do you realize what that is when he deals with your heart and gets ahold of your lot and deals with you and talks with you you realize what that is he is making known that he interceding on your behalf and there is a life where you can live that is a victorious life above the life you're living you say how brother Samuel it ain't a one-two-three ABC step plan it's simply surrender your life to the Lord believe you see it's a reflection I was praying right here and just praying over these things and this is where the Holy Spirit spoke to my heart you are the very words that just come to my heart how is this reflected I've been studying on these things with the high priest looking at this and looking through the priesthood looking at this and it's over the past few weeks and it's just like a flood and just not a flood but and how the Word of God had challenges you many times before it ever comes to your heart and you're shedding tears it's already been striking here but to see the responsibility of the reflection that is to be within our lives to reflect this present office that where it is known how do we know that he's interceding there there's got to be lives that that can be reflected through you said brother Samuel it's got to be the Spirit of God that deals I agree but he'll travel by the word you with me so there has to be a reflection of this remember being made co-workers now watch this here when you find that there's there has to be you know this this particular scripture we're going to read out of Hebrews five you recognize that quote we just read here that quote we just read he knows how to sympathize do you realize when you read that quote of how much long-suffering and patience is required there you say I remember in the bible is clear to say in the days of noah he was long-suffering see it was already glimpses of the high priest here he is he's already meant long-suffering long-suffering means to suffer long you see what we're dealing with here it's more than just about somebody saying something against you or you have this or that this is what I'm speaking of his win we're long-suffering for one another we're patient with one another the Branham took some heat in his own tabernacle for certain things where he was long-suffering in patience and some of the brother bran knew it and he talked about it in broken cisterns I want you to think of this here maybe I'll refer to that here in a little bit in Hebrews 5 verse 1 for every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God what's that say that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins so the priesthood that of the Levites God took them to himself out of all Israel he redeemed them took them unto himself for that service now watch this who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them better out of the way for that he himself also is compass with infirmary I want you to catch this for he also is accomplished with infirmity I want you to think of it take for example here this word compassion this word compassion deals with one who is not unduly disturbed by the errors false sins of others but bears them gently now I've already started on these verses Scripture we're going to go but I can't stop here now it's not unduly disturbed can see the faults can see the sins can see all these things come on somebody we don't need a prophet here now to see all of that we can see things we see coldness we see things where people just seem like people are lining up with the word come on somebody a coldness that's setting in I'll tell you what there's no excuse for being cold in this hour if you want to be cold and indifference because you choose to be that way there's a living God a living fire that is ever-present to clean your life up clean your attitude up he's ever-present to take care of it so this compassion remember it's not about sugarcoating but at the same time it's also being able to look sometimes you've got to look beyond what you're seeing and see the heart you understand brother Branham man he got criticized 1965 broken cisterns Bill Graham said concerning that within the tabernacle there was a man who was smoking and burning he wasn't in the tabernacle yet brother Branham went to that man and he cared a talking that man he said hey what what happened if you die man said well brother brownie you know I just I can't I can't do this right now I can't get my life the Lord I got the smoking but the man said why don't you forget about that he said you quit looking at what you can do and you need to look he said it what he's already done they said I would really remember them said there you go again talking about them cigarettes didn't I tell you stop talking about that he said you need to talk about him and you need to look to him and he takes us to the water in the rock he said there's sufficient water there to take care of that burgum said he took heat in the tabernacle because he baptized that man in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ not that run through a litany of quotes right now but I won't do it it was not the Spirit of God nor the Prophet condoning smoking know what he was saying and brother mem says this word for word he said what it is beyond what all the criticism was he said I could see there was something genuine in that man sometimes I'm wondering if we're so interested I believe in real holiness because the Bible said without holiness no man shall see God that's just flat-out the truth but I wonder if my concern has been over time are we interested in getting people to match our model instead of getting them to the Holy Ghost I don't want people just to dress Ron and everything else I want to see people on fire for God soul of the Holy Ghost [Applause] if you have the Holy Ghost you'll do the things that are right it's not a struggle to live a Christian life if you get the Holy Ghost I'm talking about the high priest this morning well yes sir I believe you ought to let your hair grow sister I believe you ought to wipe off all that paint off your face and Matt I believe you oughta wear shoes that don't put you up in the balcony come on now I believe your honor wear things that are presentable and brothers I believe you ought to wear things that are presentable - oh yeah brother Brent deals with a regarding rumor he talks about that of the the ponytail brother Brent said now back in the old days he said that was an example of a street woman he said of course that was back then when they would braid their hair brother Bramson now he said see he said the world looks at that net son off cast then he said it's not a fashion of the world he said it's okay it's not a fashion of the world and this is what I'm telling you you might have everything it seems like it's detailed but you need to make sure that you're not trying to pattern yourself after the world because brother this world is already falling apart but you need a pattern yourself after the Living God be a witness be an example be a reflection of that true high priest and the atonement that there is a life that's greater than this life there is a life that's more dear and more precious we're going to send you they may not accept me who cares what the world says as long as you're accepted in Jesus Christ that's what matters well they might promote me than if they promote you you have to confer compromise more and more I'd rather be a popper for Jesus been to compromise with the things of the world amen wanna be witnesses in this hour that indeed the true atonement has come and this is compassion where you can look upon a situation and you're able to pray for that situation Lord give them the same experience you gave me that's having confidence with that token you know that's the remedy well now we got the foundation will preach a little bit compassion on the ignorant and them that are out of the way some of you might be visitors here but you're not ignorant of our ways preach preach preach brother sin you're not ignorant your children are not ignorant of this way no Sam you can't make them do this or do that I didn't say make them do this or that but I ought to be a just a genuine respect of the presence of Almighty God it ought to be something where there's a desire and it ought to be something aware it's just a a holiness that's there well some of you got quiet on that one but that's alright we're talking about reflecting the Office of the hyperion I'm the time I'm running people down and someone I'm talking about I'm talking about having a real compassion but it's a compassion with power oh my and them who are out of the way they don't know no better hello for Hiva himself also his compass with infirmity and by reason here of he ought as for the people so also for himself to offer for sins and no man taketh this honor unto himself but he that is called of God as was Aaron you did not take this honor to be called a son and daughter of God unto yourself any man that of the priesthood is by birthright it's designated you are you are already by for nation a seed a child of God but remember you had to be born into this you can't just walk into the priesthood you got to present yourself there before that way and be wash and be dressed you don't just walk in forgive me this might step on toes - I never understood how people just walk in backsliding it's like we just pick up where we left off I'll tell you that always questions my heart because if you know you say brother Simon you don't know what for took place at hold no I don't know that but if something really took place to wear their heart was struck and they had already repented and it's turned around then praise God let's go on but for someone just to walk back in and act like nothing it happened it's hit the resume button I don't agree with that where you been all this time come on somebody I believe you ought to be a true repentance it's not just come back to where you are cuz where you were it wasn't strong enough to hold you and you fell away you've got to come to a place where it's not you the anchor but it's Christ who is the anchor that's holding you in the veil that's a reflection of the high priest no repeater God so Christ let me go on I got to read this so also Christ glorified not himself to be made a high priest but here he had said unto Him thou art my son today have I begotten thee has he also said in another place thou art a priest forever after the order of melchizedek remember now here comes here this one does great melchizedek and it takes upon a body of flesh he's not walking around in the temple all day if you recall without me relating to a lot of things in the scriptures the traditions and things that had been so devised with the Pharisees they themselves were so removed from the people and they were to be servants they forgot the foundation of the calling they forgot that foundation remember they looked a minute oh you're born a sinner well tell me how you were born that was altogether born in sin so were you - but you see listen now the Pharisees had such an outward and outward you know display about the remember brother BAM tells us this and you see it in the gospel he said you couldn't put a finger on their life but then when he started to uncover what's beneath these garments he found them full of dead men's bones he found them full of that was the same spirit motivating them that had motivated them to saw Isaiah in pieces come on somebody it didn't matter they were holding up the message of Moses and the law it didn't matter all that and they could say well I'm the seed of Abraham they themselves were against the very God who called Abraham and they had a problem now let me read the scripture here in Luke 15 verse 1 and verse 2 then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him dear God this is Melchizedek clothed in flesh and the sinners and publicans drew near him to hear him verse 2 and the Pharisees and scribes murmured saying this man receiveth sinners and eateth with them this is Melchizedek in flesh milk Cassidy became Jesus Christ here he is and the Pharisees and scribes are looking at him and saying this man how in the world can he have anything to do with them I know him they've been coming to this church for a long time they never got right they never fully went all the way then now let me ask you why were they coming to Jesus because Jesus was a good buddy no it was a living presence of the Living God you know what it was it was reality it was something that those starched Pharisees did not have they might have had word but they did not know the god of that word even the people said never a man spake like this do you realize Jesus takes this and you can read the rest of the chapter he deals with going out after that one lost sheep he goes on and deals with a woman where the coin she's looking for the corn then he goes on to the to the prodigal son and he ends this whole parables and wraps it up that the Pharisees are the elder brother what do you mean how no rules he rejoices not been here I've done this I've lived this to the letter I've done this I've done that you say what it is some people that's why they're so miserable it's because it's what they've been doing and instead of rejoicing now remember rejoicing the Bible didn't say when they rejoice is that a sheep been born again he didn't say that it didn't say rejoice us now that this coin has been you know completely put back or that this prodigal son remember the father went to meet him this is talking about and reflecting his office of a high priest do you realize Jesus don't sit in heaven and say it just repented I'll get happy when they get sanctified or another sanctified out you know I'll wait till they really get born again when they get born again I'll get happy that's not what this is about I guarantee and that's the desire within every one of us that's God's desire listen friends in the ministering of the word it so that you would come into a full relationship with Jesus Christ by the new birth but I'll tell you this right here for a life that has actually been given over to God and they themselves they might be full of still of all the things but yet they've given their life to the Lord they've turned it over as a sheet that's when astray you talk about rejoicing brother it all not be just them rejoicing we ought to rejoice knowing they are not the work of man but even justification is a work of the Holy Ghost somehow we've got this mixed up that sanctification and justification is not a work of the Holy Ghost yet we know it but somehow we don't know it you know what that means it means we need the divine power of the high priests to move on our midst there are things that you and I you can preach you can labor and you can see things and sometimes you say doesn't get discouraging yeah it's discouraging Saint can bring all sorts of things up before me it's not being effective and this is and and that isn't and that isn't but you see within the midst of it there I've got a choice I can either come out and blast everything or I can look under him and say God would you direct me and I can look two lives that he's bringing up and pray and ask God to undertake it might be that God will come right through here and he'll skin our hearts good but remember there still has to be a heart behind it most time you need to preach on this and this what's stopping you what about your life we're living so selfish for yourself and be a help to the rest of the body come on yeah I know it's tough but if you just say man it helps as sons and daughters of God were to be reflections operating under the headship and authority of a high priest you've got charges that you've got to keep come on your borders if you're born to the Spirit of God you got charges well we I want to keep going here the Bible goes on to say in Hebrews seven my-my-my Hebrews 7 verse verse 23 they truly were many high priests were many priests because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death but this man because he continuous ever hath an unchangeable priesthood wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him or that that could really we could preach on that for months seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them he saves to the uttermost that's the that's the testimony in our life he don't do a partial work he does a complete work coming to God by him he does a complete work for such a high priest or all of this for such a hot reached become us who is holy harmless undefiled separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens who need if not daily as those high priests to offer up sacrifice first for his own sins listen I want you to really pay attention this verse who needeth not daily as those high priests to offer up sacrifice first for his own sins and then for the peoples for this he did once when he offered up himself remember the high priest before they had to have a sacrifice that went in before them they were continually confessing their sins is that right now I believe it the Holy Ghost will help us here in dealing with this I believe that this when we look at this in verse 27 I believe it deals with us living a life that's consecrated to him you say what do you mean I'm talking about a life that's not lived to self but rather a life that's surrendered fully and daily to him in order to fully fulfill the present office of a high priest let me go a little further with it I believe with all my heart when this verdes verse of scripture pressed up on my heart I believe that God is calling us to a greater and higher calling you say what do you mean I mean that we need to recognize the power and the authority of our high priest to fully operate in our lives and that means that our prayers should be more have more depth than just asking forgiveness I hope you with me you're going to make mistakes but that is not something where brother Branham told us two words well I just have mistakes I see that attitude right there I call that attitude out that is not right it's not a condoning of sin but you are compass to about within this body brother angles injured he says you know it said mistakes he said I've told people he said I'll be praying for him he's saying forget the pray for him you might look at this a man I don't see how much of a mistake these other things we can go through but my point is this instead of us living a life that where the prayer is constantly asking for forgiveness and we thank God that he is a high priest there that's one on our behalf that's there to make to move for you and I to remove that guilt from around our life but this is what I'm saying it ought to be that we're living a life that's more focused on his purpose and his plan and his calling instead of ourselves if our prayers are more on forgiveness we're living a selfish life you understand you're praying remember you have come into this brought in by the new birth and there's many responsibilities for the believer priest and one of those is intercession intercession for the needs of others how can you correctly intercede when you're wrapped up in yourself instead of there's needs in the body there's needs for healing there's needs for deliverance there's needs for people to be born again preach brother son instead of looking at ourselves is to take that focus instead of us look on the needs of others Paul said look not every man on his own things but also on the things of others that don't mean look on the things of others and run them down it means intercede pay for them and God lays it on your heart after you've got sweetened maybe you would be the vehicle to go and speak to them sister to sister brother to brother somehow I feel like this Catholic spirit II just like wants to creep over my brother Sammy was the holy man here brother Samuel does everything here you better get that Roman Catholic spirit out of here this is not a one-man it is a body of Jesus Christ it's the Holy Ghost working through his many membered body glory Paul told the believers in Galatia he's warning them don't be entangled with the yoke of bondage you've been free don't get entangled with it you and you've been free get up and get going and keep moving if you fell in a rut you made sure that you put distance between yourself and the rut you were in Paul so told the Corinthians all things are lawful unto me but however not all of them are expedient you see he's trying to tell them that in operating there's many things Paul could say I can do but I choose not to do it it's not expedient it doesn't further the work or the calls but let us serve one another verse 28 that we read I'm coming they'll all make us men that are high priests that have infirmity I want you to watch how Paul places this the lawmakers men high priests which have infirmity but the word of the oath it was spoken clear back to Abraham the word of the oath glory be to God which was since the law maketh the son who is consecrated forevermore and listen to me when he stood there before Peter and the rest of him he said who do men say that I am some say your David some say Jeremiah some say this who do you say I am thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God that logos that pillar of fire the Son of God who went out the first visible form you with me here he is dwelling in a body of flesh I want you to listen to me here in this body of flesh when he stood before the Pharisees they said you're not a man more than fifty years old and you told me you seen Abraham you see he looked old a virgin born body for the complete supreme sacrifice he found temptation he felt sickness but the Sun was in week this is what I'm saying this morning the son of God is not weak he's all-powerful the Holy Ghost is all-powerful but it's an anchor that holds it keeps you here you are in your life your compass about with infirmity but once you've been born again of the Spirit of God you're more than a conqueror you experience things out here but on the inside it's the overcomer that's pulsating in your life there is no weakness on the inside and through that it brings us back to where we will receive a body that will match what has taken place on the inside of us because what has taken place on the inside of us it has now connected us with a theophany in the heavenly places in the delegation of God of that new city and it's reflected back down here on earth we have a body reserved in the heavens [Music] there's no weakness in the seed life no weakness the Bible says here I'm coming down here I just want to drop this in you see this is why that we stand believers believers spoken where tabernacle is not a club it's not a lodge there's a lot of sweet people there there's a lot of sweet people at the ladies sewing circle to come on somebody a lot of love down they're going to love some other places as well Wittering this not just that it's here there's a Living God that's present do should people fill up they ought to feel they ought to come around listen to me like it did the Lord Jesus when the Bible says they drew near to Jesus there was a know roar there was a presence about Jesus he was not looking down on her that's a difference that kind of an attitude is not a reflection of the high priest that kind of an attitude of goodness gracious man how long is going to take before they get it that's not a reflection of the high priest that's the frustration of this earthly garment but you and I cannot make people conform they tell you something the word is preached what parents and as the word is preached it's Moses but brother there's only one can take across Jordan and that's just the agent show the Lord that's the only one that can tak them across into the promises everything else is to be set in order but it has to be the presence of God the angel the Lord to pack the people into the presence of Almighty God that's right if you're schooled in to this message you'll be schooled out of it I'll hold it be to God you said what he's saying I'm saying that it ought to be the presence of God I believe it friends but I want us to be very sincere and very very focused on this we want a sweetness and a presence about our life that would call somebody to one what we have you think Jesus wasn't bothered by the things that was going on around him he was but evidently it did not affect his attitude to where they themselves can have him around no more it was known he received them he didn't avoid them hello somebody I said he didn't avoid them they weren't the plague you know what it was he was confident in the seal that was on his life a living presence that could have an effect on their life if your Holy Ghost can be taken away then I wonder where that it ought to be effectual to where it's able to bring people into the presence of Almighty God but Simon I don't associate with people if it's after a few different times and then received it you show me that through where your prophet did that how many times he hung with Bert so often we we we Dogma ties this whole thing the brother man go along with his sin not at all but there was a life that was lived a reflection of the office of the high priest one to listen not that you remain in your sin that's not the desire not to go low but the desire is as God do something for this life change this life maybe it's something that said maybe it's not something that said maybe it's just said through your life the Bible speaks to us that he have made us kings and priests unto God and his father that's a duality King where we're reigning over sin over the flesh over the devil over sin it's a life of the high priest that's reflected in us the answer has come the answer to the devil's question ask our victory has been released and it's a witness it's a testimony you see it's a life that's live that witnesses to others you can be free brother I know what you're going through but I want to let you know there's a refuge sister I know what you're going through but there's a refuge for the band spending he says always said you that's a drunkard he said all he says and your family's warning you to get right he said I can sympathize with them and he goes into talk about the effects of that kind of a life and say no why don't you just turn your life over to God right now let God take control of it you see just sympathise doesn't mean that you would stay in the condition you're in but we are looking to God to know that the same god of what he's done in us that that same God can do it in you and if there's something in your life that you feel tempted by you're tested by is to wear that we're able to stand together as brother to brother Sister to Sister and able to say brother I'm praying with you sister I'm praying with you what a because Heslin has a king having dominion on the inside and yet were also priests we been brought into this place as a priest brother Brennan tells us this Lamia I'm closing I am God could not suffer in spirit he had to become flesh to feel the pain of sickness to feel the temptation of lust to feel the temptation of want to feel the temptation of hunger to feel the power of death that he might take it upon his self to stand in the presence of the Great Spirit Jehovah the spirit not the man the spirit to make intercession to this life he said Jesus took that in order to make intercession for us for he knows how it feels when you get sick he knows how it feels when you're tempted he knows how you feel Levin said did you ever notice when we vote for a president every farmer will vote for a president that's been a farmer for he knows the hard part of the farmers life he wants some man who understood and he said before God could ever understand before God could ever understand but Sammy that's not important oh but it is it is important that he understand to know how to intercede for you and for me not just knowledge of it but understand him being that great holiness think of this how could he ever understand after he condemned man by his holiness he condemned man and the only way he will ever know how to justify man is to become the Bram says all he says he's our high priest standing there he knows how you feel he knows how to reconcile you back to Grace and how to bring you back to your health he knows how to do it but I'm ask you whose hands does he have whose feet does he have come on somebody sometimes it's stretching out to people listen France there's too many testimonies to go around to things you know sometimes it's not jumping right on what you see is wrong sometimes you need to develop a friendship we're so interested that's not God's approach God gets your favor give me an example glad you asked Nathan when he walked in before David did David did Nathan walk in there with double barrels you man no you know what he did he God David because David would have been on the defense he got him to open up his gate of reasoning the word just opened him up to a certain place and then he finally could say you're the guy so he had open up there was his defenses were dis and you know brother Bram tells us then you start talking about the weather see if it'll go any further see if it'll go any further why would I do that because you have a heart of feeling for that person don't you let the devil condemn you that if you've been talking to them oh I didn't let him have this quote and I didn't let him have this scripture that's just a devil trying to get you all twisted up she friends he need to discern this right here the devil brings that stuff with anxiety the Spirit of God does not bring anxiousness how could he he'd be contradicting himself when he told us don't be anxious be careful for nothing take no thought for tomorrow he would contradict himself remember after all the one individual brother branham talked about being led to the Lord it wasn't what the preacher said although all the sermons were wonderful it wasn't the choir what did he see sunrise sunrise brother Brandon led a man to the Lord the infidel what quote did he use well the scripture did use well the rain rivers I mean he had has a God is in his universe God is in nature the Spirit of God used such wisdom and discernment to point this out to that man to what the man is open now he's open now you can approach it but if you to come out blazing with scriptures different story different story but the first that's why just be a reflection let your light so shine and pray God give me a favor with that brother give me a favor with that co-worker Lord give me a favor with m'lord would you Lord God give me favor for that soul that ought to be our prayer give me favor with them Lord that it would be like that to where they would assemble to our lives like they did to the Lord Jesus my ena was all about it he didn't have to be sick I'm just skimming over these but he became sick he didn't have to be but that you when you're sick or I'm sick and we could say lord I need you touchable but I just don't I don't feel good you don't stand here and say well I don't know it seems pretty bad he's able to sympathize and in her head and he's able to offer up as we stand there and say Lord by your stripes I'm healed yep yep yep that's it he's standing there to make good on that confession let me leave you with this quote here and we'll close out of the message living dying the last things the last quote I gave you just skip down to that first nineteen said I'm so glad to know that he can be found amongst the brokenhearted in our sorrows he's not one that would leave us aren't you glad that he sends an email glad he sends a card or it may not be American Greetings but it's greetings from the Dove and our sorrows he's not one that would leave us he stands by us when all has failed and the last hopes of earthly reaching has come to its end he is still God and He loves us he was the expressing of God and all how I believe that he longs for his people to be so anointed with his that we could go to each other in trials and in troubles and give the expression of his sympathy as it pours from our hearts that's been born of his spirit to reflect in the church the love of the Living God it's powerful it's a lot he longs for his people to be so anointed with this spirit now probably if we're asking out here who would want to be the one they would go on here Lake Erie if God wants people to walk on water out here today or not I'll do it lord I just just humbly I'll walk on the water let all of them see but if he says hey would you be anybody would be willing born in my spirit that would want to show sympathy to a brother to a sister well that's not like walking on the water I know but it's its greatness its greatness its greatness to be able to express did you catch what it says his sympathy how can I have sympathy the right depth of it without him but to enter in God help us reflecting his present office reflecting a life above sin and yet within that rhythm through that divine power riding residing within our life to also reflect that compassion that's able to minister to a heart and say there's a better way there's a deeper life god bless you this morning I'll tell you this morning if you you're here without that life you can have it you can have it if God's been dealing with your heart you can have it you just you just surrender and say Lord draw me nearer Lloyd you might say brother salmon sometimes taking the simple word surrender Oh Simon what does that mean that means giving everything if you know that there still holds on your life steel things that you still have a love for say Lord dissolve that love dissolve that Lord I want to be in that place of refuge that spoke about this morning and those who are in that refuge say Lord I want to so reflect your present office a life that's above sin and I want to reflect it Lord reflecting your sympathy to others let me have a heart that's willing to pray for others Lord to enter in on their behalf Lord what you did for me you can do for them Lord I remember I was sick with this Lord you're my you're my high priest you're their high priest Lord would you just touch them Lord it's faithful let's bow our heads or Jesus our hearts award I know mine Lord are very challenged very challenged Lord sometimes the Lord in the occupying we get so occupied and with Lord God it slips from us it's just living for others I pray Heavenly Father I pray O God for our lives Lord hearts as an assembly I realize Lord what care when a new one Lord one that would come into the fold there's got to be care ministered to it Lord [Music] I pray Heavenly Father that God that you're this morning may Lord as your holy spirit Lord is just moving through this building Lord to bring conviction to hearts that are not living where they ought to be Lord may you just minister to that heart may they find that and make that release in you Lord and I pray father those living beneath our privileges looking at life so occupied what I know I believe in my heart or god you're calling us Lord to a greater higher calling [Music] we battle self we battle battle pride we battle Lord God the infirmities of this garment but greater are you greater is he that is in us and he that's in the world your Lord that you help us to subdue father leave your calling our lives not that we don't need to ask for forgiveness we do but help us Lord me God our sights be set in such a measure Lord they were looking not just on our own but on the needs of others and taking it to heart [Music] maybe Lord God it's the burden you'd place on our heart annoyed to befriend that brothers sister because a desire to see him help to encourage him to pray with them Lord Bible said confess your faults one to another pray that you might be healed Oh God Lord Jesus we live Lord and around a surrounding that's it's all about self but I believe in my heart Lord I I know the testimony Lord this morning I know the witness the Lord God among us as a people it's true Lord and we'd give you glory because it's nothing that we've done but Lord neither do we want to be of a mind as though that it's something we've done Lord to where there's the presence of God that strikes hearts when they walk in this door to where in Lord when others come this in mind just just feel such a love and they know it's it's beyond just any just any love but God I pray that from the depth of every heart may it be God we're burdens are taken on Lord to pray for that one Lord to pray for that life to stand there Lord as an intercessor as one less confidence in the working of the life within them of what is able to do in others your God I pray this morning we're in Lord where else the Lord where they see it it must be a reflection and the life and the hearts of your people your bride Lord a reflection of your life of that true atonement your God I pray forgive us Lord of our shortcomings and may we rise Lord may father from our hearts Lord as that just grips us award [Music] Lord as we desire that same life may we may we lord have that same testimony as that of Luke 15 where they came to hear you well God we don't want to be and have that attitude of the Pharisees that'll grieve your spirit away you won't just run others it will grieve your spirit if we get the feeling like we're the only ones I get the feeling like Lord that it's got to come through us Oh God Lord God don't please father don't let that arrogant spirit Lord be around us Oh God that may we the testimony always be it's Jesus it's the Lord Jesus Christ he's the one to meet your needs the same strength as son grace the same power that I'm living of it's for you granite lord I pray may our lives so reflect that Lord granite Lord made that living presence of the Living God be unhindered Lord if there be anything that hinders that reflection Lord I ask that you would forgive us and I pray cleanse Lord cleanse lord I pray anything Lord that would be unlike you lord [Music] granite lord for that life that heart Lord this desiring that refuge in you lord I pray may they just give all of their life Lord I lay it all down there's nothing even of what I would think of value no there's nothing that compares to eternal life nothing that it'll lift you out of the world lift you above the Dominion of sin I remember I didn't understand that when that was spoke to me I could see it I could see lives that were lived before me but I didn't understand it but one day he came one day he brought it about he drew me it was yielding and he did the work that's saying God he's the same God for your life he's the same God he what he wants to be a reflection through your life oh so [Music] yes I [Music] should be my blessed Savior [Music] hallelujah [Laughter] [Music] if you'd like to stand you're more than welcome to [Music] all to Jesus sing that all to Jesus [Music] Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] for me to be a sanctuary Lord prepare to be a sanctuary [Music] I'll [Music] [Applause] [Music] god prepared me to be a sanctuary [Music] try Oh Lord God [Music] you know I think of where Paul and we think of the burden now God would so place us in the body I look at what Paul said when he met the Lord and he said Lord what would you have me do what would you have me do you know that's something when you you look at it everyone everyone has a part in the body of Jesus Christ you may not be a singer may not be a preacher don't don't matter you might be one that I say bill Sammon sometimes I get I'll twist it up my words but you might be one that even behind the scenes you're taking needs and you're praying about it you're one that's reaching out to others that you see in need you've got your part in the body and that part on once you understand as we surrendered to that part I think our brother Brent I remember how he looked when he seen Oral Roberts and all the rest of me said Lord I guess you couldn't trust me with something like this Ben said I got the feeling sorry for myself and he said Ben the Lord told me look up I'm your Porsche brother brand recognized that what God had given him to do he said do you realize he said you may not be and brother been put in those terms a Billy Graham Warren Oral Roberts he said but if you do what God has called you to do he said you are thought of as much as what they are in the kingdom you see it's what God has called us to do Lord what would you have me to do you know it's different sometimes people say I'll do this or I'll do that and but if it don't drop here as a burden when you don't feel like doing it you won't do it when it's a burden you do it when you don't feel like doing it that's different but when it's a burden you say what do you mean by burden where you take it and realize this is my church this is my symbol these are my brothers and sisters yeah come on somebody you see I I love all you kids but I don't love them better in love mine I love mine better I love all of God's people God's giving me you know an opportunity to meet others and and minister but God don't know I'm not for everybody but this is the burden that God has for me do you understand that's the same way when we look at this Lord this is my assembly it's not well that's brother sango's Church no this is my church I said this is my church you have that responsibility as a gate keeper as a priest in the house of God and you can say Lord what would you have me do what would you have me to do Lord and you do that with what God drops on your heart you do it with all eyes unto the Lord you watch God he up that burden he's placed on your heart he makes good on it it makes good on it it's very very very very very well I think you know a services of what God has done here as I've said in the past few years I've seen more supernatural in the past few years here than I've ever seen many things taking place not just in healing deliverances and other things I've watched God do but you know what it wouldn't have taken place and things the services themselves if it weren't people praying it wouldn't what I mean your so brother Simon you study but I don't study what I want to study you see I don't preach what oh I want to preach sometimes there's things and I'm I'm out in a study on things and my going and it's not even one I want to preach the next morning but I have to follow the inspiration you know you might go all I fishing but it might be purged or bitin that day so you pick up the perch it's legal right god knows what we have need of and we are all we are a part of God's great economy what's your loving this morning Lord what would you have me do let's bow our heads or Jesus as we prepare to depart Lord from one another's presence Lord how we just were so thankful for these times to be able to come together or to help us even as we carry that upon our hearts what would you have me do old mine Lord God how I thank your father for your great working Lord in our lives thank you Father for Oh God brothers and sisters helpers smart Oh God what a what a blessed thing it is Lloyd to be a part of the family of God what a wonderful wonderful privilege Lord to be a part the local assembly Lord thank you Father Lord Jesus we pray that you Lord you know what you have for us Lord the burden then Lord that you would have for us and we like Paul could say what would you have me to do Lord Father help us Lord if we know what to do and there are things that we maybe have let that be crowded out you're God we're reporting for duty granite Lord Jesus that your burden would be fulfilled in our lives lord help us Lord I pray God be with us as we go our separate ways watch over each and every one or God may the spirit of grace may the holy spirit continue Lord to move and brood over our hearts Lord even as we would leave from this place Lord breaking the bread of life to a sword making it more personal help us father go with your people Lord those that have been sick and body lord i pray may they find this weak Lord God may they find more God that wellness wood granite Lord God where they've been touched Lord God by You Father granite Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen god bless you church amen you're dismissed in the name of the lord jesus god bless you as you go your separate ways [Music] oh it's hot there's more [Music] ah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
