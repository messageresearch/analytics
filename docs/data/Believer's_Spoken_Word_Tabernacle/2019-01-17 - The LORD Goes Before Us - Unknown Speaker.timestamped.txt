[31:52] [Applause]
[31:55] Holly we Holly Lou a man you're loving
[32:00] tonight man it's certainly it's good to
[32:04] be in the house of the Lord and I good
[32:06] to be gathered together the saints of
[32:08] God of like precious faith amen I think
[32:12] I think the winner has finally struck us
[32:16] I want to make a few announcements here
[32:21] probably for the betterment of the
[32:23] weekend we really still don't know all
[32:25] that we're likely to get and what we
[32:29] will get and if we get it we certainly
[32:32] don't like to have to cancel anything
[32:35] and I just trust that we don't have to
[32:38] cancel service on Sunday but we just put
[32:42] that all before the Lord I want to make
[32:46] mention though we spoke with the Deacons
[32:49] and so forth and probably for the
[32:51] benefit of everything we'll go ahead and
[32:53] cancel the depot we do have that
[32:56] scheduled dole again in February right
[32:59] brother bill because brother bill would
[33:01] have to go there and get the key
[33:02] tomorrow and so that'll probably save
[33:07] some of you and having to plan on what
[33:09] you were going to make or whatever more
[33:11] and I don't like to cancel the better
[33:15] sometimes you know we we live and some
[33:18] people say we live in Ohio and you know
[33:20] what I heard the statement that said
[33:22] about Ohio if you don't like the weather
[33:24] stick around and it'll change after a
[33:26] little while but you know what I found
[33:28] out that's not just for Ohio when I went
[33:31] to Canada they said the same thing they
[33:33] said you know I was you know how they
[33:34] say about Canada this so it it's the
[33:38] same thing you know we we just don't
[33:40] know also I just wanted to make mention
[33:45] we had sent out a calendar with a
[33:47] communion service there in the first
[33:48] part of February but I'm gonna go ahead
[33:51] and cancel that the communion service
[33:53] and we'll reschedule that for for a
[33:55] later date
[33:57] a later date in that time I know we've
[34:00] had a lot of sickness and things that's
[34:02] been among us so for that we'll go ahead
[34:05] and cancel that for a later time and you
[34:07] just be in prayer with that and we'll
[34:09] let we'll let it be known ahead of time
[34:11] as much as we can I think that's it
[34:14] right now you love the Lord so let's
[34:20] just I just want to turn our attention
[34:22] now to the Word of God that's that he'll
[34:27] just come and speak to us tonight the
[34:30] personal way he certainly knows he
[34:33] certainly knows all of our needs doesn't
[34:34] he and I believe that he's the one to
[34:38] guide us and direct us all along this
[34:42] this way so let's just let's just look
[34:46] to him in a word of Prayer tonight and
[34:48] just asked it he would just lead us and
[34:51] guide us amen Heavenly Father Lord as we
[34:55] bow our hearts Lord in this moment Lord
[34:59] as we come together father we've lured a
[35:02] symbol Lord according to your word for

[37:10] Lord from this address God into heavenly
[37:12] places Oh Lord tonight we pray father
[37:15] Lord we ask it now for the glory of God
[37:18] in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen
[37:23] turn with me if you would to Deuteronomy
[37:24] chapter one I just want to read just a
[37:29] portion of the word
[37:42] Deuteronomy chapter 1 verse 29 is what
[37:45] I'd like to to go first now here is
[37:50] there is Moses where we have been here
[37:55] in this place he's rehearsing before the
[37:59] children of Israel remember there are
[38:01] those who have been there and have been
[38:04] witness to these this along the journey
[38:08] but it's also for the new generation
[38:10] that's coming along and how that he is
[38:13] expressing these words of what had taken
[38:16] place here at Kadish and so now once the
[38:20] people had had been discouraged watch in
[38:22] verse 29
[38:23] Moses is rehearse to them what was
[38:26] spoken in that time by himself when he
[38:30] said in verse 29 then I said unto you
[38:33] dreadnaught neither be afraid of them
[38:36] the Lord your God which goeth before you
[38:40] he shall fight for you according to all
[38:43] that he did for you in Egypt before your
[38:47] eyes and in the wilderness where thou
[38:50] has seen how that the LORD thy God bare
[38:54] thee has a man doth bear his son and all
[38:58] the way that ye went until you came into
[39:02] this place yet in this thing you did not
[39:05] believe the Lord your God who went in
[39:08] the way before you to search you out a
[39:10] place to pitch your tent tents in and in
[39:14] the fire by night to show you by what
[39:18] way you should go and in a cloud by day
[39:22] a man you loved him Amen may God bless
[39:26] you bless the reading of his word as
[39:28] you're being seated I want to just just
[39:33] take this tonight and maybe start to
[39:35] break into this part of just some things
[39:37] that will possibly hear over the
[39:41] services maybe somewhat overlap on
[39:43] Sundays and that certainly wasn't
[39:45] anything that was planned but just you
[39:47] know inspiration strikes your heart in
[39:50] just months ago many of these things
[39:52] when looking just in the
[39:56] Israel's journey in them coming to the
[39:59] crossing of the Jordan and we recognize
[40:02] that within this hour the ministry that
[40:04] God has given us is not just that of a
[40:07] Ministry of that of Moses but also holds
[40:10] within it the Joshua Commission and we
[40:13] know that where we are are standing and
[40:16] promised that to abide fully in the
[40:19] promises of God and to also come into
[40:23] that which the Church of the Living God
[40:25] has longed for the very change of the
[40:28] body so we are we are with and under
[40:31] expectation for that and you you find
[40:34] that within this here that the whole a
[40:39] point and whole place of the journey
[40:41] were Israel is is in journey with the
[40:44] Lord and how that Moses would make known
[40:47] to them in the midst of this time when
[40:50] there was a trouble in the camp back
[40:52] there in numbers where they'd come to
[40:53] Cadiz the spies had come back remember
[40:56] and he was we look here in the word
[40:58] Moses was encouraging them and directing
[41:02] their focus away from all of the reports
[41:06] of what those evil men the ten spies
[41:10] what they themselves had brought up
[41:12] because we know that there were two that
[41:14] were faithful but they were ten who
[41:16] brought up an evil report of the land
[41:17] and notice Moses here at that time he
[41:20] said this is what I mentioned and I
[41:22] spoke to you at that time and to thank
[41:25] all of them who were standing present
[41:27] who were still alive among them that had
[41:31] made it through that had not been there
[41:34] and consumed with the plagues that had
[41:36] not disbelieved God had not rejected him
[41:40] they were witnesses there were witnesses
[41:43] that were there of all that God had done
[41:46] down in Egypt and all along the way
[41:48] until he brought into Kadish there were
[41:51] people who were witnesses eyewitnesses
[41:54] of this and I want you just to think of
[41:56] this we wanted just just to take it
[41:58] little by little however far God will
[41:59] allow us to get here tonight but I want
[42:02] but I don't want to rush oh I believe
[42:04] these are our nuggets that just feeling
[42:06] impressed to the Spirit of God to look
[42:08] at that you find
[42:10] many times through the journey where
[42:12] Israel comes out of the land we we
[42:15] understand we hear many times of the
[42:17] murmuring and the complaining and how
[42:19] they provoked God and all of those
[42:21] things many times we also read as God
[42:24] would make mention in Deuteronomy and
[42:26] other places of where that there was a
[42:30] punishment that would come fire came out
[42:33] from God the Serpent's came across we we
[42:36] read of those times but I want to
[42:38] reflect and draw us as a as a people to
[42:42] look at the pathway of God and look at
[42:45] this tonight as we open into it to see
[42:48] how that God when he was bringing the
[42:51] people into the promise remember he says
[42:54] I'm consent you I'm come down to deliver
[42:57] the people to bring them out of Egypt
[43:00] and then into this land of promise
[43:02] that's that's the goal that's full
[43:05] reconciliation where we stand there in
[43:08] the promised land and we know that's a
[43:11] type of the Holy Spirit is that right
[43:13] that's a type of the believer dwelling
[43:16] in Christ dwelling in our promises but
[43:18] to see that how that God that everything
[43:22] that God has has given to us
[43:25] everything is already it is something
[43:28] that God has already made away as he
[43:31] said I've given you the land God already
[43:35] had given it to him but they had to have
[43:37] faith in order to take what God had
[43:42] given them you know brother Bram tells
[43:44] us about grace and he makes these
[43:46] statements in marriage of the Lamb he
[43:47] said God's got Amazing Grace to save you
[43:50] he said but you will have to take it you
[43:53] have to accept what God has for you
[43:56] there's healing for your body but he
[43:58] said you have to fight for it he said
[44:00] every promise of God you have to fight
[44:03] for it but here's the thing if God has
[44:06] already given it to you and that same
[44:09] God is inspiring and making it known to
[44:12] you then it then it is God Himself
[44:15] causing faith to rise in him who made
[44:20] the promise because after
[44:22] all it's not us fulfilling the promises
[44:25] we're just simply the vessels that are
[44:28] yielded to God that God would fulfill
[44:31] his promises through and I believe that
[44:34] with all my heart if we can recognize
[44:36] that that it's God building building our
[44:39] faith for the journey all of these
[44:41] things that were along the way was God
[44:45] building the faith of the people for
[44:48] that time of the crossing think about
[44:50] how brother Branham would place it there
[44:52] in the message a spiritual food and due
[44:55] season and he would he would just talk
[44:57] to the people at the beginning of that
[44:59] message and he would say now he says
[45:01] there's too many things that's happened
[45:04] here out throughout this ministry for
[45:07] you not to recognize God as among us
[45:09] then he makes a statement right after
[45:12] that in the next paragraph and he says
[45:14] but you see he said it's gonna take more
[45:16] faith in this hour than it ever has in
[45:19] any other hour he said but what we want
[45:22] you to do is take the things that God
[45:24] has done and we want you to take not
[45:27] only the signs and the wonders of what
[45:29] he's done but the word also and he said
[45:32] lay those things up in your heart he
[45:34] said I've cumulate those things in your
[45:37] heart allow Him to be built up he said
[45:39] these being built up you to be built up
[45:42] in the Holy Oracle's of faith and I
[45:45] believe that's God's desire you see if
[45:47] God's made a promise then God comes by
[45:50] when you and I are not able to help
[45:52] ourselves and it's God who comes by to
[45:55] raise our faith that the promise that
[45:58] he's spoken might come too fast you see
[46:00] how could you know he's a savior unless
[46:03] he would make himself known to you and
[46:05] deal with your heart and call upon your
[46:08] life and let you know that I'm a savior
[46:11] that I can save you that I have paid
[46:13] away and they made a price for you you
[46:16] couldn't know that unless he himself
[46:18] wouldn't make it known to you and when
[46:20] he would make it known to you and how
[46:22] that you would look in your life then
[46:24] you could raise up into that place and
[46:26] you could say Lord Jesus save me Lord
[46:29] for my sins because you believe that he
[46:32] is able to make that real
[46:35] in your life so it all comes down to
[46:38] that it is God Himself supplying what is
[46:42] needed for the hour think about it how
[46:44] that each one of those martyrs stood in
[46:47] their time brother Brent tells us like
[46:49] this
[46:49] in the church age book he said it was
[46:51] when Polycarp and the rest of them came
[46:53] to their time he said God stepped in and
[46:56] supplied supreme grace for what was
[46:59] needed for the supreme hour and I'm
[47:01] telling you right now when you look
[47:03] around it the Bible tells us even in
[47:06] regards to Sarah that Sarah herself the
[47:09] Bible says that she received strength to
[47:12] conceive because she judged him faithful
[47:16] who made the promise so it is God that
[47:19] you and I are drawing our strength from
[47:22] and that's why I say it and I believe
[47:24] I'm talking to believers tonight we know
[47:26] we need the Living God in our midst
[47:29] we're nothing without the presence of
[47:31] Almighty God you know that's the thing
[47:34] that separates us from all other people
[47:36] upon the face of the earth is the
[47:38] presence of the Living God
[47:40] you know many carry a Bible but what
[47:42] separates us from others is the presence
[47:45] of the Living God and we recognize when
[47:48] we look at this here tonight of how that
[47:50] God would build faith within the hearts
[47:52] of his people I want to go back and
[47:55] begin to look at this of how that God
[47:57] bringing them up to that time of Katies
[48:00] every experience was ordained by God it
[48:04] was not an experience of punishment but
[48:07] it was rather God chastening or
[48:10] disciplining his children and preparing
[48:13] them and he was also not only preparing
[48:16] them for the land because remember this
[48:18] Lamb that they were going into was not
[48:21] like the land of Egypt God let him know
[48:24] you're not gonna water your crops by
[48:26] your foot like you did in Egypt but this
[48:28] is a land that I care for this is a land
[48:32] that my eyes are upon this land God was
[48:35] letting them know this is not a natural
[48:36] land it's not an intellectual and this
[48:39] is a supernatural land and our
[48:42] dependency is upon the Living God
[48:44] so in order to
[48:46] the people and building their character
[48:49] and building him for coming into this
[48:51] place God has all of these appointments
[48:53] down through time that he would make
[48:56] known himself to them and I believe that
[48:59] you and I as believers I don't believe
[49:01] that we not only should do it have to do
[49:05] it but I believe it's something in our
[49:07] hearts that when we can look at the
[49:09] things that God is doing it ought to
[49:11] bring faith within our hearts to believe
[49:14] God and to know that even the
[49:16] testimonies like was given here last
[49:18] week and in other services that what God
[49:21] did for that one that he would make that
[49:23] known then God is the same God for my
[49:27] need and my situation it might be a
[49:30] little different but he's the same God
[49:32] and when the same conditions are met
[49:34] he'll perform the same way and I believe
[49:38] that with all my heart that how that God
[49:40] you would find how Moses would actually
[49:43] recall and rehearse the children of
[49:46] Israel through these appointments of God
[49:49] and when I look at this here I think
[49:51] back to Deuteronomy chapter 8 and
[49:54] Deuteronomy chapter 8 verse 2 once again
[49:57] you find how that Moses would make known
[50:00] to the people and say thou shalt
[50:02] remember all the way which the LORD thy
[50:05] God led thee beasts forty years in the
[50:08] wilderness to Humble thee and to prove
[50:11] thee to know what was in thy heart
[50:13] whether that would is keep his
[50:15] Commandments or no now to think of this
[50:18] to remember that you would remember you
[50:21] you know it's necessary to recall of how
[50:25] that it's been the Lord God as Moses
[50:27] goes on to let him know it's been the
[50:29] Lord God that has kept you these forty
[50:32] years this is exactly what was being
[50:34] said when they were getting ready at
[50:37] kadish there and those flies come back
[50:39] he was letting them know remember it's
[50:41] the Lord God that brought you out of
[50:43] Egypt he's letting them know that the
[50:45] place that you stand right now you would
[50:48] not be standing here if it was not for
[50:51] the Living God the supernatural God that
[50:54] has brought you all along
[50:56] and you know what all the people had to
[50:58] do was just believe God then you notice
[51:03] that within this when we look in these
[51:05] settings here the Bible goes on to tell
[51:08] us there in Deuteronomy a of how that
[51:11] you know that their raiment and all of
[51:13] those things Moses would let him know
[51:15] your raiment you know it didn't whack
[51:17] sold and he goes into that in verse four
[51:19] and then verse five he said thou shalt
[51:22] also consider in thine heart that as a
[51:25] man chase on earth his son so the LORD
[51:28] thy God
[51:29] chase enough V and you know sometimes we
[51:32] look at the word chastening I want to
[51:34] just drop this here for the thought here
[51:36] tonight chastening does not always mean
[51:39] you know the the wippen chastening is
[51:43] discipline and instruction brother
[51:46] branham over and over you find that when
[51:48] you look at it from the opening of the
[51:50] seals clear down into nineteen
[51:52] sixty-five you'll find where the prophet
[51:55] will actually make mention to us and
[51:58] he's he's praying here actually as he's
[52:00] praying lord ii said that you might
[52:02] reveal your will to us that we might
[52:05] know how to discipline our lives in the
[52:09] hour that we're living you see if God
[52:12] doesn't make known the way how can we
[52:14] find the way but it's up to God he's the
[52:18] one that's leading us and if he is
[52:20] calling us to Allah to to an acceptable
[52:23] to a be accepted then it's up to God to
[52:26] make away and reveal that you realize
[52:29] when somebody desires to be well
[52:32] somebody desires to be healed somebody
[52:35] desires to be saved somebody desires to
[52:38] be delivered to be filled with the Holy
[52:40] Ghost do you realize when you really
[52:42] desire that you didn't get that desire
[52:44] on your own you did not get that desire
[52:46] from the devil it was not something that
[52:49] was stirred up that you would just have
[52:51] some myth in front of you but that was
[52:54] originated and God dropped that within
[52:56] your heart and listen and just as sure
[52:59] as there's a desire that pulsates within
[53:02] that heart for that there is a living
[53:05] God to make that promise real
[53:07] and alive in your heart because God does
[53:10] not play with our feelings our emotions
[53:13] or thoughts God is faithful oh my that
[53:21] thou wood is considered how the Lord had
[53:25] chastened thee as a man chasing his son
[53:29] so God is instructing Israel as a father
[53:33] as he said in the opening Scripture as a
[53:36] man would bear his son you know Paul
[53:39] remember how Paul would reach back there
[53:41] in the book of Galatians I believe it's
[53:43] Galatians 3 and Paul would speak of how
[53:46] that the law was a schoolmaster and you
[53:49] know a schoolmaster is given till a time
[53:52] until faith comes in schoolmaster is
[53:56] there to instruct to make known you know
[53:58] what is right and what is wrong
[54:00] but once faith is come then the
[54:03] schoolmaster it has done its duty by
[54:06] bringing us to a place that the
[54:08] schoolmaster himself can no longer can
[54:11] no can no longer or cannot bring us into
[54:13] a place that only faith can bring us
[54:16] into you realize Moses could only bring
[54:19] him to a certain place but it the Joshua
[54:22] to take him over you know and God had
[54:24] already spoke about this in the book of
[54:27] Exodus he said mine angel shall go
[54:30] before thee and he shall bring thee into
[54:33] the land that thou prepares you realize
[54:36] even as parents as parents the most of
[54:39] our ministry of parents it's like that
[54:41] of Moses we speak of the statutes and
[54:44] the judgments and what is right and
[54:46] order and all the order and all the
[54:48] appropriate things all of that is
[54:50] necessary it's all needful but there's
[54:52] only one that can take our children into
[54:55] the land and that's Joshua that is the
[54:57] Lord Jesus Christ
[54:59] that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[55:01] that pacts them there from law into
[55:04] grace where it's no longer living by
[55:06] do's and notes but you've got the doer
[55:08] on the inside oh my don't you love the
[55:11] Lord so to think how that God's
[55:13] chastening of hound that he would care
[55:16] for Israel and you know there's lessons
[55:18] to be learned here
[55:20] it's a
[55:20] pathway of God's choosing you know God
[55:23] was was teaching them a divine
[55:26] instruction by experience you know how
[55:29] many times that for you and me both you
[55:31] know you had things where people will
[55:33] even make things known to you and
[55:35] they'll they'll speak things you know
[55:37] usually you know those sometimes it's
[55:39] older than us and they'll make no math
[55:41] ways in ways that they've walked before
[55:43] and that's done so that you and I might
[55:46] be able to benefit and grow from their
[55:49] learning but you realize sometimes even
[55:51] when things have been spoken that
[55:53] sometimes even afterwards that you begin
[55:56] to actually come into a place and you
[55:59] find yourself coming into something and
[56:01] it's not I'm not talking about sin but
[56:03] I'm talking about something to where you
[56:06] come to a place and you realize that
[56:08] didn't go just exactly like I thought it
[56:10] was gonna go or whatever and then all of
[56:12] a sudden the Holy Spirit will bring back
[56:14] to your memory here someone that it
[56:17] spoke to you your confidence in and you
[56:19] begin to remember those things and you
[56:21] say oh my yeah I'm not I'm not alone I'm
[56:24] not in this alone and you realize that
[56:27] oh yeah what they were saying but you
[56:29] see they told you they spoke to you but
[56:32] yet it was not something that you or I
[56:35] was able to learn by experience through
[56:39] just word but it actually had to come by
[56:42] experience and then once you have the
[56:44] experience it actually takes the word
[56:47] that was spoken and it brings comfort to
[56:49] you and that's exactly the way that God
[56:52] would lead Israel he didn't want to just
[56:54] give them a bunch of words but God
[56:57] wanted to manifest himself and let
[57:00] Israel know that when I have made the
[57:03] promise I've got all the bases covered
[57:06] for your life let me just say it like
[57:10] this if you look at it here just for a
[57:12] moment and you take this into
[57:13] consideration here and you look at how
[57:16] that you know within Israel's life you
[57:19] know we understand that the trials that
[57:21] we go through there for the perfecting
[57:23] of us is that right those trials are for
[57:26] the perfecting of us and all the way
[57:28] that God was leading them that was his
[57:32] way it was God's Way
[57:34] he was directing them all the way
[57:36] through the pathway and when you look at
[57:38] everything in here I tell you I I just
[57:41] this this point just seems to resonate
[57:43] in my heart if you watch how that God
[57:45] lays everything out in the Book of
[57:48] Numbers in the book of Deuteronomy here
[57:50] in the book of Exodus God wanted the
[57:52] people's focus on one thing and that's
[57:55] him
[57:56] who made the promise and the promise God
[57:58] said you don't have to be focused on all
[58:01] the necessities of life sure they come
[58:04] up before us but I want you to remember
[58:06] that I made the promise and Allah
[58:09] brought you out if I called you out that
[58:12] I will sustain you I will provide for
[58:15] everything that you have need of they
[58:19] meant God's letting them know you see
[58:21] he's not just gonna tell them that that
[58:23] God said I want to prove this to you so
[58:27] when we think of this of how that God
[58:29] would would make himself known to Israel
[58:32] brother bran would say it like this here
[58:34] just let me refer to it he talks about
[58:36] how he said God would bring Israel out
[58:39] he would try them as a nation he plucked
[58:41] him up up them up from Egypt among all
[58:45] those unbelievers and brought them under
[58:47] his tender care on the wings of an eagle
[58:50] the great Eagle Moses that led them from
[58:53] place to place trying to get them in
[58:55] condition to cross over notice trying to
[58:59] get them in condition to cross over now
[59:02] you watch here has we you know we just
[59:04] look at this here just a few moments
[59:06] here tonight you find the places that
[59:08] God is taking them as soon as they leave
[59:11] out of Egypt they're going to come to a
[59:13] place of the Red Sea then from the Red
[59:16] Sea that come tomorrow then they come to
[59:18] them then they move into Sinai and each
[59:20] one of these places are divine
[59:23] appointments that God is making himself
[59:27] known to Israel that I am all that you
[59:31] have need of I'm not just gonna say it
[59:35] to you but I'm gonna prove it to you
[59:39] glory be to God don't you love when God
[59:42] comes and proves his word hello it stirs
[59:48] our hearts as believers you know it's
[59:50] something has just stairs my heart you
[59:52] know when testimonies will drop and I
[59:55] think you know just of even the service
[59:57] that we had here last week and I made
[59:59] mention to you you know and I left out
[1:00:01] of here I thought boy this is gonna be a
[1:00:03] hard night to go to sleep because you're
[1:00:05] just so stirred up of what God is doing
[1:00:07] among his people friends this this is my
[1:00:10] joy this is my delight I believe it's
[1:00:13] your delight as well to witness the
[1:00:15] Living God there's nothing else that I
[1:00:18] get pleasure and satisfaction out of
[1:00:20] there's nothing that means more to me
[1:00:23] than to pray till I'm in his presence
[1:00:25] and then also to hear his word and to
[1:00:28] also then witnesses workings among his
[1:00:31] people I tell you it encourages us and I
[1:00:35] believe it's I believe that it is God's
[1:00:37] Way how many times you find brother
[1:00:39] Branham when he's in the midst here of
[1:00:41] you know in the ministry he dropped
[1:00:44] right back into a testimony and it
[1:00:46] through a testimony there he would build
[1:00:48] faith for the oncoming battle in that
[1:00:51] just exactly what David did David when
[1:00:54] it came to a situation with Goliath hold
[1:00:56] all of those that were up there saw in
[1:00:58] the rest of them that weren't so much
[1:01:01] standing behind
[1:01:02] believing David himself had to reach
[1:01:05] into his own personal scrip bag of
[1:01:07] experiences and he began to declare that
[1:01:10] the Living God was the same one who
[1:01:13] delivered him from the line and from the
[1:01:15] bear and he's the same God that will
[1:01:17] deliver this uncircumcised philistine in
[1:01:21] my hand do you realize that David
[1:01:23] identified something that the rest of
[1:01:26] those Israelites should have known it
[1:01:28] should have been that very thing that
[1:01:30] they would have caught their attention
[1:01:32] no matter how big that giant was he's
[1:01:35] uncircumcised it is not part of the
[1:01:39] Covenant but they were looking at his
[1:01:43] size but David could say he's
[1:01:45] uncircumcised he don't have no
[1:01:47] protection
[1:01:50] what does that say about you and I who
[1:01:53] have been born of the Spirit of God and
[1:01:55] plays in the Covenant of Jesus Christ by
[1:01:58] the circumcision not made with hands
[1:02:01] we've got a great big God
[1:02:03] we've got a great covenant oh my it's
[1:02:06] all powerful of a Living God hallelujah
[1:02:10] oh my oh my how I feel like preaching
[1:02:17] but I don't want to make it so
[1:02:19] evangelistic huh I want to drop this
[1:02:21] here for us tonight that we would lean
[1:02:24] from this tonight you find here in that
[1:02:29] sit is 13 maybe some of these places you
[1:02:32] can just follow me here in the scripture
[1:02:34] in Exodus 13 verse 17 the Bible says it
[1:02:40] came to pass when Pharaoh had let the
[1:02:42] people go that God led them not through
[1:02:46] the way of the land of the Philistines
[1:02:49] although that was near that was closer
[1:02:57] but God's got a reason for God said
[1:03:01] unless peradventure the people repent
[1:03:05] when they see war and they return to
[1:03:08] Egypt God was mindful he had bared them
[1:03:13] he was bearing them has a man dove care
[1:03:17] for his son he knows what they're able
[1:03:20] to stand
[1:03:21] he knows what they're able to endure at
[1:03:24] that point aren't you glad he will never
[1:03:26] put more up on us than we are able to
[1:03:30] bear and whatever he allows to come our
[1:03:34] way you know what I'm talking about
[1:03:36] 1st Corinthians 10:13 whatever he
[1:03:38] permits remember it is that which is
[1:03:41] common to man and with that he will make
[1:03:45] an escape that we might be able to bear
[1:03:48] it God is faithful now think of this
[1:03:52] here but God led the people about
[1:03:56] through the way of the wilderness of the
[1:03:59] Red Sea and the children of Israel in a
[1:04:01] harness
[1:04:02] out of the land of Egypt means they were
[1:04:04] they were going up but you know a breast
[1:04:06] like like an army and Moses took the
[1:04:09] bones of Joseph with him for he had
[1:04:12] straightly sworn the children of Israel
[1:04:14] saying God will surely visit you and you
[1:04:17] shall carry up my bones away hence from
[1:04:19] you and they took their journey from
[1:04:22] Saku and in Campton 'litham and in the
[1:04:25] edge of the wilderness and the Lord went
[1:04:27] before them by day in a pillar of a
[1:04:30] cloud to lead them in the way and the
[1:04:33] night in a pillar fire to give them life
[1:04:35] to go by day and night he took not away
[1:04:38] the pillar of the cloud by day nor the
[1:04:40] pillar of fire by night from before the
[1:04:42] people I want you to notice something
[1:04:44] very very peculiar here you know when
[1:04:46] you look in the scriptures it speaks
[1:04:48] here of how that the Lord went before
[1:04:50] them in a pillar of cloud the Bible says
[1:04:54] he led them in the way if says he the
[1:04:58] pillar fire gave them light to go by day
[1:05:01] and night and he took not the pillar
[1:05:03] crying away from the people you know
[1:05:06] brother Branham makes a statement and he
[1:05:08] talks to us every time how many times
[1:05:10] you hear what brother Branham would
[1:05:12] identify he says he came and he had his
[1:05:15] picture taken with us and brother Graham
[1:05:18] will say it over and over he said look
[1:05:20] he said that pillar fire was not just
[1:05:24] with Moses it was with the people he
[1:05:27] said look he said that pillar fire did
[1:05:30] not come he said because of me he said
[1:05:32] he came because of his word he said he's
[1:05:35] identified himself with me he said
[1:05:38] because I'm standing on his world and he
[1:05:40] said if we stand together on the word
[1:05:43] he's identified with us
[1:05:46] it's that same angel the Lord that same
[1:05:50] angel of the Covenant let me tell you
[1:05:52] something although here you know the
[1:05:55] seventh angel the earthly messenger
[1:05:57] although he's gone but the one who stood
[1:06:00] right there and delivered that message
[1:06:02] and who gave it that same one is here
[1:06:05] with you and I and it's the same one
[1:06:08] that's in our meds that's making this
[1:06:10] word to come to pass and it's the same
[1:06:12] one that's
[1:06:13] left here that'll pack us from these
[1:06:15] mortal bodies into the immortal
[1:06:18] it's the same age of the Lord that's
[1:06:21] God's promise behold I sent mine angel
[1:06:23] before thee to keep thee in the way and
[1:06:26] to bring me into the place that I have
[1:06:29] prepared for thee and in my father's
[1:06:32] house are many mansions Amen that same
[1:06:37] angel the Lord is leading the Church of
[1:06:40] the Living God tonight step by step of
[1:06:44] the way
[1:06:45] faith being built look at this here you
[1:06:48] know brother Branham made this statement
[1:06:51] here and let me just read this here
[1:06:54] he says if I was going to New York City
[1:06:58] the best thing for me to do is not to
[1:07:02] try to find geographically how I'm
[1:07:05] situated and take off north but the best
[1:07:08] way to do is to get a map and follow the
[1:07:11] map a highway if I don't I get in
[1:07:13] trouble is that all right I'm air we'd
[1:07:20] go on trips and you know that was back
[1:07:22] in the days when getting ready go on a
[1:07:23] trip dad would get out there and McNally
[1:07:25] atlas he would lay it on the table and
[1:07:28] he would plan and we were plan out stops
[1:07:30] along the way you had to know what exit
[1:07:33] was and stuff like that and I know some
[1:07:35] of the young people looking at me and
[1:07:36] saying what is that but it was a map and
[1:07:40] it had a layout you know of the roads
[1:07:43] and the highways and you could kind of
[1:07:44] plan your way through there and you know
[1:07:47] here but the random is letting him know
[1:07:49] he says you would get a map and you
[1:07:51] would follow the map and if I don't I
[1:07:53] get in trouble he says there's no
[1:07:55] shortcuts in God's kingdom you know we
[1:07:58] try to make a shortcut we get out here
[1:08:00] and upon somewhere and mire down and
[1:08:02] that's what we do when we get off the
[1:08:04] grand old highway of God
[1:08:06] God made a pathway so now let me come
[1:08:09] down to you youngers O'Malley got phones
[1:08:14] and we got GPS but I think there's
[1:08:17] enough witnesses here tonight including
[1:08:19] myself how many times where it's told me
[1:08:21] you have arrived and I'm in the middle
[1:08:23] of a neighborhood and that neighborhood
[1:08:24] I don't know if I can I'll probably get
[1:08:26] pulled over this
[1:08:26] I'm gonna do to get out of there there
[1:08:29] been times I remember my dad was in the
[1:08:31] hospital had he had a knee operated on
[1:08:33] and you know I got a GPS in the first
[1:08:36] place one of them garments is because
[1:08:38] you know I couldn't remember where all
[1:08:39] the hospitals were at when I'd have to
[1:08:41] come visit you all and I couldn't
[1:08:42] remember do I get on turnpike for this
[1:08:44] one do I take 90 for this one where do I
[1:08:46] get off so that's the reason our guy got
[1:08:47] one in the first place and so here I am
[1:08:49] you know I'm driving along and about
[1:08:51] that time you know I'm supposed to be
[1:08:53] going to Lakewood Hospital and about the
[1:08:55] time I get off and you know I'm just
[1:08:57] following it because I don't know where
[1:08:58] liquid hospitals that never been there
[1:09:00] in my life about that time I'm all down
[1:09:02] the other way and I'm in a neighborhood
[1:09:04] and it says you've arrived I looked
[1:09:06] around I said there is nothing around
[1:09:08] here I don't even see a building that
[1:09:11] looks like a hospital I said Lord Jesus
[1:09:13] help me Lord help me I'm lost so I
[1:09:16] called my mom I said hey I said I need
[1:09:18] help I said I don't know where I'm at
[1:09:20] you know so they referred me to the
[1:09:22] front desk and and I called the front
[1:09:23] desk I'll let her know it said here I'm
[1:09:25] over here by this you know I said what I
[1:09:27] see across the street is a Burger King
[1:09:29] but I just passed it here I'm moving on
[1:09:31] down the street cuz I'm not gonna stay
[1:09:32] here I stopped on this corner I'm coming
[1:09:34] down this way and here's what I see over
[1:09:36] here here's what I see and you know that
[1:09:38] lady was able to guide me in my point
[1:09:40] that I'm making is that you can have all
[1:09:42] of all the all the equipment and all
[1:09:44] those things but you see what a map and
[1:09:46] those things what a GPS another thing
[1:09:48] should help you do it should be able to
[1:09:51] help you to get from one place to the
[1:09:53] other but you know if you know as well
[1:09:55] as I do it would be a quick trip if we
[1:09:58] could drive across the lake and go into
[1:10:00] Ontario but we can't do that we've got
[1:10:02] to go all the way around this way
[1:10:04] or we've got to come all the way up that
[1:10:06] way there's certain ways in certain
[1:10:08] places you know how it is as you know
[1:10:10] has little fellas sometimes you're in
[1:10:12] the car and we're gonna take a shortcut
[1:10:14] and the shortcut ain't a shortcut it's a
[1:10:16] long cut it ends up being a long way
[1:10:18] around and sometimes it's places that
[1:10:21] you wish you never been and this is what
[1:10:23] brother branham is letting us know here
[1:10:25] in a very simple way that God's player
[1:10:27] pathway is not a shortcut but it is his
[1:10:32] way and all along the way there are
[1:10:35] sites that he wants us to see there are
[1:10:38] things that he
[1:10:39] wants to make known to you and I hold my
[1:10:42] so then you know brother Ren tells the
[1:10:44] seagulls into here of how God's a
[1:10:46] leadership he said you know he said some
[1:10:49] through the waters some through the
[1:10:51] flood some through deep trials but all
[1:10:53] through the blood he said that's the way
[1:10:54] God leads his children God's path God's
[1:10:57] provided way if the children of Israel
[1:10:59] would have tried to bypass and go around
[1:11:02] down this way they'd have got in trouble
[1:11:04] they had to follow the cloud of fire and
[1:11:07] the pillar fire that led them they
[1:11:09] followed that and if the church tonight
[1:11:11] I love this statement will only follow
[1:11:13] the pillar fire only follow the pillar
[1:11:16] fire the Holy Spirit you'll make Canaan
[1:11:19] as sure as anything if you only follow
[1:11:23] the Holy Spirit the pillar fire you make
[1:11:26] Canaan as sure as anything God has a way
[1:11:28] of provided way he said now there's two
[1:11:31] ways a man can go and that's his way or
[1:11:36] God's Way and that's the right way or
[1:11:40] the wrong way and your way is always the
[1:11:46] wrong way and God's Way is the right way
[1:11:50] and you can't be in your own way and in
[1:11:53] God's Way at the same time so you got to
[1:11:55] get out of your own way so God can have
[1:11:58] his way in you I want to look here in
[1:12:02] the scripture go with me to Exodus
[1:12:04] chapter 13 here Exodus 13 here the Bible
[1:12:20] we just finished reading where the
[1:12:22] pillar fire was right there with them
[1:12:23] leading them in verse 1 of Exodus 14 and
[1:12:27] the Lord spake unto Moses saying speak
[1:12:30] unto the children of Israel that they
[1:12:33] turn and in camp before peer oath
[1:12:36] between mcdowell on the sea over against
[1:12:39] Bowser phone before before it shall you
[1:12:42] in camp by the sea for Pharaoh will say
[1:12:46] of the children of Israel they are
[1:12:47] entangled in the land the wilderness
[1:12:50] hath shut
[1:12:51] in and I will harden Pharaoh's heart but
[1:12:55] he will follow after them and I will be
[1:12:57] honored upon Pharaoh and upon all his
[1:13:00] hosts that the Egyptians may know that I
[1:13:03] am the Lord and they did so now here is
[1:13:08] God leading them his pathway now the
[1:13:14] children of Israel remember here they
[1:13:15] are they're out from under bondage
[1:13:17] they've been in bondage they've had to
[1:13:20] give heed to these task masters as well
[1:13:22] as to Egypt it was a ruling authority
[1:13:26] over their lives but how did God by way
[1:13:30] of the sacrifice think of all the
[1:13:32] plagues that God did when they were down
[1:13:34] there in Egypt and all those plagues
[1:13:36] there what was it doing it was executing
[1:13:38] judgment upon the gods of Egypt but then
[1:13:42] how that it came into that final moment
[1:13:44] to where there would be a difference
[1:13:47] that the Lord would make between Israel
[1:13:50] between Israel and all of that of Egypt
[1:13:54] and the difference that the Lord would
[1:13:56] make would be by the blood and we know
[1:13:58] that how that he told them he said you
[1:14:00] to take a lamb and you to slay the lamb
[1:14:02] you to put the lambs blood upon the door
[1:14:04] so there had to be a sacrifice a
[1:14:07] sacrifice of blood in order for them to
[1:14:11] walk out you see this is part of
[1:14:14] redemption redemption requires a
[1:14:17] purchase and it's only a purchase by
[1:14:20] blood it cannot be purchased with that
[1:14:23] of with that of silver with that of gold
[1:14:26] but it is a purchase of blood because it
[1:14:28] speaks that there had to be a life that
[1:14:32] would be an innocent life that would be
[1:14:34] able to stand in our place and take our
[1:14:37] judgment that you and I could be able to
[1:14:40] go free so here they are they're walking
[1:14:44] out under the sacrifice of the blood of
[1:14:47] the Lamb when they've come out of Egypt
[1:14:49] and then they come into this time and
[1:14:51] here God has orchestrating and
[1:14:54] engineering every bit of this - we're
[1:14:56] here they would be in a place that he
[1:14:59] has led them to that Pharaoh himself
[1:15:01] would rise up in that time God would
[1:15:05] harden his heart when they would tell
[1:15:06] Pharaoh concerning Israel and Pharaoh
[1:15:09] would start out after him to over take
[1:15:12] Israel not to think this God has all of
[1:15:16] this in his plan but remember now he has
[1:15:18] not told his plan to Moses this part of
[1:15:22] it he only said I'm going to take him
[1:15:24] into the land but you see he didn't have
[1:15:26] to tell everything to Moses what Moses
[1:15:29] knew was that he had met the Lord God
[1:15:32] and what God had said he was doing I've
[1:15:34] come down to deliver him behold I'm
[1:15:37] sending you Moses had faith in the
[1:15:40] Living God of what God had told him to
[1:15:43] do that God was standing by and that's
[1:15:46] the same way it is with us we don't need
[1:15:48] to know every step of the way but it is
[1:15:50] faith enough to know and rest that we
[1:15:54] are in the very hand of Almighty God we
[1:15:58] have met the Living God and he himself
[1:16:00] has brought us forth so whatever the
[1:16:03] future holds is to know he holds the
[1:16:06] future this is what brother Branham was
[1:16:09] so labor in the messages of Shalom there
[1:16:12] in the beginning of 64 and he would over
[1:16:14] and over deal with the future and he
[1:16:16] said all why don't you just commit your
[1:16:18] future to the Lord he said you know he
[1:16:20] said we don't know what the future holds
[1:16:22] he said death might take you he said but
[1:16:24] don't look at that he said look to him
[1:16:26] he said who knows you might get killed
[1:16:28] in an accident but don't look at that
[1:16:30] look to him oh my brother Ram says if
[1:16:33] you're in a situation you say brother
[1:16:35] branham I just seem like I can't look
[1:16:37] ahead
[1:16:37] he said don't try to look ahead look up
[1:16:40] to him I don't want you to looking ahead
[1:16:44] look to him Amen we look to him this
[1:16:49] salvation we were drawn to him and
[1:16:51] salvation looking to me all your hands
[1:16:53] of the earth we need to keep looking
[1:16:54] unto Him who's the author and finisher
[1:16:56] of our faith because the Bible says that
[1:16:58] he will appear the second time to those
[1:17:01] who look for him he will appear the
[1:17:03] second time without sin unto salvation
[1:17:05] so we're looking for him now notice this
[1:17:08] when we look at this part of the journey
[1:17:10] here how that Israel comes into this
[1:17:12] time and the Bible tells us here if I
[1:17:15] can just refer to a few places here of
[1:17:17] now but you know at this time when favor
[1:17:20] will begin to draw near in verse 10 that
[1:17:22] when he drew near the Bible says that
[1:17:25] the people were afraid and the children
[1:17:28] of Israel cried out unto the Lord and
[1:17:30] they said to Moses was it because there
[1:17:33] was no graves in Egypt have stopped
[1:17:35] taken us a way to die wherefore hast
[1:17:38] thou dealt with us to carry us forth out
[1:17:40] of Egypt is it not this word that we
[1:17:42] told the in Egypt saying let us alone
[1:17:44] that we may serve the Egyptians for it
[1:17:47] had been better for us to serve the
[1:17:48] Egyptians than we should die in the
[1:17:50] wilderness notice here they'd wasn't
[1:17:52] aware that this was going to come up but
[1:17:55] you see what happens when they begin to
[1:17:57] hear about Pharaoh the hearing they see
[1:17:59] the things coming they themselves are
[1:18:02] troubled but you know where God is going
[1:18:05] to take this as a proving grounds now
[1:18:09] how many times after this we hear the
[1:18:11] statement of why you brought us out here
[1:18:13] to die you brought us out here to die
[1:18:15] and other times later on God brings
[1:18:19] judgment on earth but this time right
[1:18:22] here you know this is an opportunity
[1:18:24] because God is chastening his people
[1:18:27] he's going to prove
[1:18:28] here's faithfulness to them
[1:18:32] Omaha don't you love him now notice here
[1:18:35] you know Moses he instructs the people
[1:18:38] to stand still and you shall see the
[1:18:40] salvation of the Lord I want you to
[1:18:42] watch this verse of scripture here he
[1:18:44] said you shall stand still and see the
[1:18:46] salvation of the Lord in verse 13 which
[1:18:49] he will show you to you today for the
[1:18:52] Egyptians
[1:18:53] whom you have seen today you shall see
[1:18:56] them no more forever the Lord shall
[1:18:59] fight for you and you shall hold your
[1:19:02] peace
[1:19:03] Oh glory you see you can't go anywhere
[1:19:09] with the past come on somebody you can't
[1:19:14] go anywhere with the past God knows that
[1:19:16] so God he makes a way he's gonna deal
[1:19:20] with that past he's gonna deal with
[1:19:23] those things that were ruling over them
[1:19:27] when
[1:19:27] were down in Egypt you see he had called
[1:19:30] them out by the word and they had come
[1:19:32] out but you see when they came out then
[1:19:35] the very taskmasters and those that had
[1:19:38] ruled over now are stirred up to come
[1:19:41] out against them the the very ones that
[1:19:43] had made him go and pick up straw and
[1:19:46] make brick and all those other things
[1:19:48] the very ones that had ruled over him
[1:19:50] were now in pursuit after them but you
[1:19:53] see it's exactly what God wanted God
[1:19:57] wanted this at this time he's called him
[1:20:00] out by faith and by faith they applied
[1:20:02] the blood and walk out is that right
[1:20:04] there's been a purchase that was made a
[1:20:06] purchase was made now God he's going to
[1:20:09] manifest to them his power will glory
[1:20:13] he's gonna manifest power to Israel as
[1:20:16] well as their to the Egyptians now
[1:20:18] remember here the Bible says that how
[1:20:21] that God in verse 19 that the angel of
[1:20:24] God which went before the camp of Israel
[1:20:26] removed and went behind them and the
[1:20:28] pillar of cloud went from before their
[1:20:30] face and stood behind them so here what
[1:20:33] was pursuing them and what was coming
[1:20:36] after them they were following in God's
[1:20:38] pathway and now the angel of God here
[1:20:41] here he is in that pillar fire that
[1:20:43] pillar of cloud he removes from going
[1:20:45] before them and he comes between them
[1:20:48] and the enemy now I want you to stay
[1:20:49] with me here brother Branham brings this
[1:20:51] very thing that's very very place here
[1:20:54] in the scripture and he'll tap it in
[1:20:56] many different ways
[1:20:57] he'll tap it here within that of
[1:20:59] sanctification he'll type it in the in
[1:21:01] Redemption joint completeness he'll type
[1:21:04] it that here was physical death was
[1:21:06] coming after the people of God to kill
[1:21:09] him and you know if we just look at that
[1:21:11] one just for a moment he deals with how
[1:21:13] he says maybe here you are walking in
[1:21:15] your journeying with the Lord and
[1:21:17] sickness has come after you maybe he
[1:21:20] said it's a cancer it's something that
[1:21:22] the doctor himself has gives you no hope
[1:21:24] to recover as far as that you'll be
[1:21:27] overtaken by he said now it's up to you
[1:21:30] he said the angel of God is standing
[1:21:33] between that demon of sickness and
[1:21:35] between you he said it's that same angel
[1:21:38] of the Lord that stood between
[1:21:39] me he said when I was all shot up he
[1:21:42] said and I could have died that way he
[1:21:44] said but has I was standing there he
[1:21:46] said I decided to take his way that he
[1:21:50] was leaving and I'll tell you right now
[1:21:52] his way is the way of life the angel of
[1:21:55] God standing right there between your
[1:21:58] sickness in your body you realize that
[1:22:00] Satan cannot even touch your body and
[1:22:04] cannot even afflict you I unless he
[1:22:06] first gets permission from Almighty God
[1:22:08] but to think how the angel of God would
[1:22:12] stand right there in between the
[1:22:14] sickness and in between the people and
[1:22:16] to think of how that the people of God
[1:22:18] walking there through the Red Sea
[1:22:21] upon the dry ground when they got to the
[1:22:24] other side and they climb upon the banks
[1:22:26] remember what takes place is that a
[1:22:29] Pharaoh's army is subdued and overcome
[1:22:33] and overthrown and drowned by the water
[1:22:36] you say what are you saying tonight
[1:22:39] I'm telling you that same angel of God
[1:22:41] is here to lead you from sickness to
[1:22:43] health and apply that promise to know
[1:22:47] that it's the angel of God standing
[1:22:50] between you I'll tell you what when I
[1:22:52] look at that and I think of it of how
[1:22:54] that God in His mercy would stand right
[1:22:57] there that all that Israel think about
[1:22:59] this all the Israel had to do was stand
[1:23:01] still and see the salvation of God they
[1:23:05] stood still now watch they stood still
[1:23:08] yet they had to walk when the way was
[1:23:11] open now here is Moses now after Moses
[1:23:14] has just told them the Lord is going to
[1:23:17] fight for you today you can hold your
[1:23:19] peace God is going to fight for you know
[1:23:21] what God wants them to witness his power
[1:23:24] this is not an accident
[1:23:26] it was not an oops you remember
[1:23:29] sometimes as you look at that of Cecil
[1:23:31] Beaton Cecil B DeMille
[1:23:32] that did Commandments and you think of
[1:23:34] how that favor Rama C says right there
[1:23:36] he said their God must be a poor General
[1:23:38] to lead him into a place like this where
[1:23:41] they can't get out but this was not a
[1:23:43] mistake
[1:23:43] this was the pathway of God's Lee God
[1:23:48] was going to get him honor
[1:23:50] upon Pharaoh and on their past masters
[1:23:53] these people that had once ruled their
[1:23:55] life and made their life a rigor bondage
[1:23:58] but God was luring them to a place that
[1:24:01] Pharaoh's army would never be able to
[1:24:04] make it through that Red Sea let me tell
[1:24:07] you something there's not a demon out of
[1:24:09] hell
[1:24:10] that can make it through the blood of
[1:24:11] Jesus Christ there's not one devil that
[1:24:14] can make it through the blood of Jesus
[1:24:16] Christ
[1:24:17] there's not one old habit that can make
[1:24:19] it through that blood cleanses it's all
[1:24:23] powerful better to set free he alert him
[1:24:28] to this place this was a setup
[1:24:32] Israel didn't know what was going on
[1:24:36] Pharaoh didn't know what was going on
[1:24:38] but God knew what he was doing you think
[1:24:42] about this journey he opened it up he
[1:24:45] has told Moses stretched forth your hand
[1:24:47] with the Rob that's in your hand and
[1:24:49] speak he stretched his hand over the
[1:24:52] water and the Bible says that the waters
[1:24:54] became for Israel a wall in that funny
[1:24:58] the very thing that overthrown the
[1:25:00] Egyptians was the very thing that was a
[1:25:02] wall for them in it funny the very same
[1:25:06] word that is walls for you and I it's
[1:25:08] protection its fortification it's
[1:25:10] judgment for the rest of the world I
[1:25:14] want you to think about this for a
[1:25:16] moment you know that little pill that
[1:25:18] heart patients can take it's called
[1:25:19] little natural or the little nitro pills
[1:25:21] you know and I wrote those things you
[1:25:23] realize they get enough and they get
[1:25:24] that arranged and get it in a bigger
[1:25:26] quantity they can blow up buildings
[1:25:30] nitroglycerin you understand that rock
[1:25:33] very something like that that you look
[1:25:36] at it it's all powerful the very same
[1:25:40] thing that you can take in your body and
[1:25:42] will help your bloodstream if you need
[1:25:44] help for it to thin out is the very same
[1:25:46] thing in other qualities that can blow
[1:25:48] things up let me tell you something safe
[1:25:50] that is taken into our heart it might be
[1:25:52] the size of a grain of a mustard seed
[1:25:54] but you hold on to that you nurse that
[1:25:57] you feast on God's Word you border that
[1:25:59] with
[1:26:00] and worship and you watch that very same
[1:26:02] thing it'll bring down strongholds it'll
[1:26:05] bring you into the presence of God to
[1:26:07] the promises that you're desiring in
[1:26:09] your life a man that is a living God at
[1:26:13] work in our lives
[1:26:14] think of this think of the living dog
[1:26:16] going here before the people of Israel
[1:26:19] right now stand still there in fear he
[1:26:27] just said stand still you're going to
[1:26:29] see the salvation of the Lord
[1:26:33] these that's been bothering you we'll
[1:26:35] never see him no more I want you to
[1:26:40] think of this right here him Moses was
[1:26:42] able to stand there and prophesy under
[1:26:45] the Spirit of God and said you'll never
[1:26:47] see him no more they won't be able to
[1:26:49] out swim it they won't be able to
[1:26:51] overcome it there is nothing that will
[1:26:54] make it through
[1:26:55] but how that God opened up a way for
[1:26:59] Israel what was he letting Israel know
[1:27:02] that I am your way I am the way that's
[1:27:07] been provided for you I am your way
[1:27:10] maker I am the one who opens the way
[1:27:13] that you can walk across there here they
[1:27:17] come in here they are walking you know
[1:27:20] and I want you to understand this
[1:27:21] they're on dry ground the Bible just
[1:27:24] didn't include that just to be including
[1:27:26] it they were on dry ground when they
[1:27:29] walked their feet were on solid ground
[1:27:31] God took the same ground that could
[1:27:34] overthrow the chariot wheels and it was
[1:27:37] made solid ground for that of Israel
[1:27:41] glory be to God in its remembers how
[1:27:44] that God will take the promises of his
[1:27:46] word and to us as believers it's not
[1:27:49] just word but it's solid ground it's
[1:27:52] places that we can stand upon and stand
[1:27:55] in the Lord oh ma here is Israel they
[1:28:06] come across and as they come across and
[1:28:09] they get across there now remember that
[1:28:11] Pharaoh and his army they're in pursuit
[1:28:16] they've been brought out of Egypt and
[1:28:19] all of that that has fallen those
[1:28:21] taskmasters but as they get to the other
[1:28:24] side and they get up on the other side I
[1:28:27] want you to remember here that Moses
[1:28:30] himself was directed by God now I want
[1:28:32] you to turn your hand and I want you to
[1:28:34] stretch it forth over top of that sea
[1:28:37] and the Bible says the sea came back
[1:28:40] together let me tell you something that
[1:28:41] hand what others looked at and it was
[1:28:44] Moses hand but let me tell you something
[1:28:46] when God stretches down his hand you
[1:28:48] find it in the scriptures where it
[1:28:50] speaks of the hand of the Lord it's
[1:28:52] showing God in personification of how
[1:28:55] that God would make himself known and
[1:28:58] real to you and I that by my right hand
[1:29:01] I have delivered you I have stretched
[1:29:03] down my hand who have believed the
[1:29:06] report of the Lord the arm of the Lord
[1:29:08] been revealed had been extended down and
[1:29:12] here they are in the midst of that and
[1:29:14] Moses holds the hand
[1:29:16] now watch they're not saying there's
[1:29:18] nothing all they've done he's had to
[1:29:20] walk in obedience you know what God was
[1:29:22] teaching them here you walk in obedience
[1:29:24] to my word and I will take care of your
[1:29:29] enemies anything that would try to beset
[1:29:33] you if you walk in my word I will take
[1:29:36] care of it this is God's promise this
[1:29:39] was not just a show this was a
[1:29:42] disciplinary lesson that they would know
[1:29:45] that I'm the Lord who brought you out I
[1:29:48] will take care of you and you can't go
[1:29:52] anywhere with the past so I've got to
[1:29:54] remove your past a purchase has been
[1:29:58] made and now here comes is there that
[1:30:01] are the Egyptians coming right through
[1:30:03] there oh my glory be to God and now the
[1:30:07] waters begin to cover it up on the
[1:30:10] Egyptians the Bible let's had known hid
[1:30:12] overthrew their chariots you know what
[1:30:14] the chariots was it was there
[1:30:15] our the water over through the power of
[1:30:20] failure roll it over through as a matter
[1:30:22] of fact in over through all of that of
[1:30:25] pay rose army the horsemen the horse it
[1:30:28] over through all of those powers I want
[1:30:30] you to think with me now you realize
[1:30:32] that when you look at a beast and the
[1:30:33] scripture here and you come over into
[1:30:35] revelations you realize it's a type of a
[1:30:38] power is that right so here was a power
[1:30:41] here that was coming after them a power
[1:30:44] that was sent to pursue after them these
[1:30:48] are people of a promise marching in the
[1:30:51] promise led by the pillar file and Satan
[1:30:54] is in pursuit after them let me tell you
[1:30:56] something when they come into this place
[1:30:58] and the waters closing up it is there
[1:31:01] that every elf a rose army is overthrown
[1:31:04] I want to read this here in Exodus 15
[1:31:07] can we read it here Oh glory be to God
[1:31:13] Exodus 15 1 mama I'm coming down been
[1:31:24] saying Moses and the children of Israel
[1:31:26] this song unto the Lord and spake
[1:31:28] singing I will sing unto the Lord for he
[1:31:30] had triumphed gloriously the horse and
[1:31:33] his rider hath he thrown into the sea oh
[1:31:36] there's a new song that was wrote there
[1:31:38] it fitted the inspiration of the hour
[1:31:43] you with me the Lord is my strength and
[1:31:47] soul and he has become my salvation he
[1:31:51] is my God and will prepare him and
[1:31:54] habitation my father's called and I will
[1:31:56] exalt him the Lord is a man of war the
[1:31:59] Lord is his name Pharaoh's chariots and
[1:32:02] his hosts have he cast into the sea his
[1:32:05] chosen captains also are drowned in the
[1:32:07] Red Sea and it goes on to to speak of
[1:32:10] how that God moving there among them
[1:32:13] notice here in verse 11 who is lacking
[1:32:16] to the O Lord among the gods who is Lac
[1:32:19] unto thee glorious in holiness fearful
[1:32:22] in praises doing wonders
[1:32:27] you're talking about a song you see what
[1:32:33] they were singing about was because what
[1:32:37] had been about them and after them had
[1:32:41] been consumed Omaha and they come
[1:32:43] brother branham here he places it so
[1:32:46] clearly we know that the blood he holds
[1:32:48] a sanctifying power it's not just enough
[1:32:51] that there was a sacrifice but there's a
[1:32:53] power that's been released from the
[1:32:56] blood of that sacrifice there's a power
[1:32:59] in that blood there's power to clean up
[1:33:02] a lot power to change your life as they
[1:33:06] stood there on that seashore brother and
[1:33:08] sis here was Moses he said you know
[1:33:11] maybe a little reserved person he said
[1:33:14] but that time Moses got beside himself
[1:33:16] and Miriam got beside herself because he
[1:33:20] said they can look back and they could
[1:33:23] see all of them old habits of the world
[1:33:27] was done away with come on somebody you
[1:33:32] see it was something that was real to
[1:33:34] them nobody had to tell them it was a
[1:33:38] witness to them are you with me
[1:33:42] it's a witness inside of your life that
[1:33:45] that of the past and and that of loose
[1:33:48] things that used to bond and used to
[1:33:50] bother you brother Brent said their one
[1:33:52] one old dirty habit came up out of that
[1:33:54] sea it was all drown the whole glory be
[1:33:57] to God you understand we're talking
[1:33:58] about habits it was drowned there the
[1:34:00] see the blood of Jesus Christ it packs
[1:34:03] within it sanctifying power why he's
[1:34:07] preparing them for the journey they
[1:34:11] still Don across Jordan but in here this

[1:35:19] would have said well I'm seeing the
[1:35:20] salvation of the Lord

[1:35:24] but in order to stand still and see his
[1:35:26] salvation you've got to walk step by
[1:35:28] step in the word that's been open for

[1:36:39] the other side to where His grace is
[1:36:41] reflected sublimely and perfectly in
[1:36:44] your life you stand on the other side
[1:36:47] there as a victory sanctified cleansed
[1:36:55] and I'll tell you this right here one
[1:36:58] thing I find with the Holy Spirit he
[1:37:00] don't just leave stations and
[1:37:02] appointments here in the word for the
[1:37:04] past to where we just look at it and say
[1:37:09] been there done that but I love how the
[1:37:14] Holy Spirit brings it fresh the Prophet
[1:37:17] will work it around and he said you know
[1:37:18] what he said what took place there on
[1:37:22] the bank of that Red Sea was a good
[1:37:26] old-fashioned revival and he said you
[1:37:29] know what a good old-fashioned revival
[1:37:31] is the results of its a good wind that's
[1:37:34] blowing up on the water and we need a
[1:37:37] good wind he said to blow upon this
[1:37:40] water you know what it does
[1:37:43] it washes all the trash out if there's
[1:37:46] been in snare mats if there's been traps
[1:37:48] because the enemy can have all kinds of
[1:37:50] traps around remember traps are not
[1:37:52] habits traps and types of ensnare mats
[1:37:54] but to think of how the grace of God is
[1:37:56] able to move within our life to where
[1:37:59] that we can stand
[1:38:00] and sing the song of victory aren't you
[1:38:04] glad I'm thankful to God for his word
