[44:39] good to feel good isn't it yes it is I
[44:41] tell you some different ones that we've
[44:43] battled sickness and so may God bless
[44:45] you uh let the musicians uh be seated um
[44:49] also I want to as we're turning to the
[44:51] scriptures Colossians chapter 3 and you
[44:54] pray for my wife she's going to be
[44:55] running these slides here
[45:01] today I told her I told her last night I
[45:04] said if you need me to create if I would
[45:06] wanted me to create a a a PowerPoint or
[45:09] something like that I can do that uh it
[45:11] just takes a whole lot more time but I
[45:13] don't know if you know it this program
[45:15] here the way brother Bryant brother
[45:16] Bryan actually took the program and he
[45:18] has wrote a back part to it to where all
[45:21] I have to do is I space my notes I just
[45:23] copy put them there and it totally
[45:26] orders the whole thing on slides so
[45:29] brother Brian has just painstakingly I
[45:32] drop it and it goes clear into the cloud
[45:34] comes right into that computer so I tell
[45:37] you I really love my
[45:42] brother-in-law I really miss him I
[45:44] really do brother Brian is just he and
[45:45] sister Sue and their family my goodness
[45:47] we're not even going to get in the word
[45:50] today amen we love you Colossians
[45:53] chapter 3 verse 1 and I'm going to read
[45:57] just few four verses of scripture and
[45:59] then we'll then we'll let you be seated
[46:01] if you then be risen with Christ seek
[46:05] those things which are above where
[46:09] Christ sth on the right hand of God set
[46:13] your affection on things above not on
[46:18] things on the earth I want you to notice
[46:20] there's a measure of this of
[46:22] responsibility that comes to you and I
[46:25] as children of God oh yes when the New
[46:27] Birth has come even when God dealing
[46:29] with your life before the depth of that
[46:32] has moved in in our life it's already
[46:35] him drawing us to him in a love affair
[46:39] then when it steps in on the inside now
[46:42] the love of God is what is taken
[46:45] preeminence in our life but it's just
[46:47] like in even in a natural marriage you
[46:50] can't let things
[46:52] die are you with me I got a little quiet
[46:55] quiet there brother bradam you'll hear
[46:57] him say it over and over he says never
[46:59] let that honeymoon cease if he says
[47:02] never let it do it then it means there's
[47:03] a possibility it can happen so that's
[47:06] the same thing within our walk with God
[47:09] now once you're sealed you're sealed but
[47:11] let me just say this right here when we
[47:13] stand there on that day and and if
[47:16] you're sealed with the spirit of God
[47:18] you're not going to come to the white
[47:19] Throne judgment but every one of us will
[47:21] have to appear before the Judgment seat
[47:23] of Christ and give a account for the
[47:26] Deeds Done in this body and for when God
[47:30] would say why not why weren't
[47:34] you why wasn't this a priority why
[47:37] didn't this happen so I'm not after
[47:41] rewards I just want more of
[47:45] him if if I have if there's nothing that
[47:48] at the end of it but me just to be able
[47:50] to say I've given my life entirely for
[47:54] his glory
[47:57] that's it'll be worth it all amen verse
[48:00] three for ye are dead and your life is
[48:03] hid with Christ in God when Christ who
[48:07] is our life I love that shall appear
[48:11] then shall ye also appear with him
[48:16] brother Bram takes this thought in
[48:17] invisible Union of the bride of Christ
[48:19] and I just want you to just listen to
[48:21] this thought and he's telling letting
[48:22] the people know the direction of this of
[48:25] that message and he says this is to the
[48:27] church the body of Christ that we're
[48:29] trying to lead to deeper thoughts and
[48:33] higher objectives believing that the
[48:36] coming of the Lord Jesus is at hand and
[48:40] he goes on there in that statement and
[48:42] he says I'm not looking for Revival in
[48:46] our generation I'm looking for the
[48:49] coming of the Lord in our
[48:51] generation that's why brother brandham
[48:53] could say he says they'll never never
[48:56] be anything greater than this he said
[49:00] some are looking for something super
[49:02] duper he said you're looking for the
[49:03] wrong thing yes sir is that right God
[49:06] gives one gift that gift to a
[49:09] generation and so now if we put this in
[49:13] perspective with Revival that doesn't
[49:14] mean there's no move of God what it
[49:17] means what the prophet is saying here is
[49:19] is that there's not going to be a
[49:21] national Revival we're not going to be
[49:23] going oh this city oh this this college
[49:25] this is having a Revival no remember
[49:27] what real Revival is Revival isn't a
[49:30] isn't a gathering isn't an emotional
[49:33] workup Revival is a call back to the
[49:38] word that's true Revival that's so true
[49:41] Revival is not emotion right true
[49:45] Revival is where the love of God burning
[49:49] in hearts and where the trash and
[49:52] everything of the world that's taking
[49:53] place gets washed out yeah that's that's
[49:56] for Revival So within this he says I'm
[49:59] not looking for a Revival in our
[50:00] generation he's not as far as for the
[50:03] church world the church world is not
[50:04] going to have a Revival sometimes there
[50:06] can be things that looks like great
[50:07] moves but a re a real Revival is getting
[50:10] back to God fully back to the word abely
[50:14] is that right Israel could pack around
[50:17] the Scrolls but they didn't have the
[50:19] word of the
[50:20] Lord is that right but when the word of
[50:23] the Lord come then it brings you back to
[50:25] the word so to have this of a of a
[50:27] Revival didn't say we couldn't
[50:29] individually have Revival I believe we
[50:31] ought to as a matter of fact the prophet
[50:32] said stay in
[50:34] Revival and he says like this keep life
[50:37] in you stay in the spirit of
[50:42] Revival Hallelujah and let me just say
[50:45] this to you the bride's Revival is not
[50:47] something that just started a year ago
[50:49] two years ago or three years ago the
[50:51] bride's
[50:52] Revival is around the word and when the
[50:54] seals were taken off that's when the
[50:57] bride's Revival begin so the bride's
[51:00] Revival is not chasing after sign
[51:02] chasing after a Wonder chasing up no
[51:04] though the bride's Revival is an inward
[51:07] reality between Christ and his
[51:11] people are you hearing me I could give a
[51:14] go a number of quotes on that but I'm
[51:16] just saying this is where we're at and
[51:18] it's that's what's taking place and this
[51:20] is what we're looking for the coming of
[51:23] the Lord and I'm not just looking for
[51:25] oh I I you know I'm I'm just looking for
[51:28] my loved ones I am but if I'm looking
[51:30] for that then I'm looking for him in the
[51:33] decision I need to make for tomorrow I'm
[51:36] looking for the coming of the Lord why I
[51:37] want his Blessing and his leadership in
[51:39] every step of the way yes sir because I
[51:42] want everything to lead into the coming
[51:44] of the Lord I'm looking for his coming
[51:46] in this service I want him to come in
[51:48] this service I want him to come and fill
[51:51] lives and change hearts and heal the
[51:52] sick I'm looking for the coming of the
[51:54] lord we are people that are looking for
[51:56] the coming of the Lord amen God bless
[51:58] you bless the reading of the word as
[52:00] you're being seated I want to speak here
[52:02] at just a few
[52:04] moments and I know when I say that you
[52:06] probably say yeah right but I want to
[52:09] speak a few moments here on uh we'll see
[52:12] how far we get uh but I'd like to speak
[52:14] on changing priorities and forsaking
[52:18] excuses in uh Colossians CH 3:1 I read
[52:22] from there but I'd like to read it from
[52:23] the Amplified version it says if then
[52:25] you have been raised with Christ to a
[52:28] new life and thus sharing his
[52:31] resurrection from the dead aim at notice
[52:34] these words this is what that means when
[52:36] it says seek after it's aim at and seek
[52:39] the rich Eternal Treasures that are
[52:42] above where Christ is seated at the
[52:46] right hand of God in verse two it says
[52:49] and set your minds and keep them set on
[52:54] what is above that's when when it says
[52:55] set your affections that's what it's
[52:57] referring to set your minds on on set
[53:00] them and keep them set on what is above
[53:04] the higher things and not on the things
[53:06] that on are on the earth I don't have to
[53:09] tell you that you know even as you could
[53:11] set here in a service you could be
[53:13] battled to keep your thoughts here
[53:16] that's it doesn't matter who you are it
[53:17] doesn't matter even how say as I'm stand
[53:20] here and ministering and Satan can come
[53:22] he he he comes and attacks me the same
[53:23] way as I'm standing here preaching
[53:26] uh so we know it's a battle and this is
[53:29] something that when we see to keep our
[53:31] minds you see uh the spirit of God comes
[53:34] and he brings Deliverance in our life to
[53:36] lift us to where that uh the Bible will
[53:40] say we are seated together in Heavenly
[53:43] places in Christ Jesus so there is a
[53:45] raising up from where we have been and
[53:47] to show that there's been a raising up
[53:49] you can look back in your life and say
[53:52] I'm no longer the same That I Used to Be
[53:55] the things of this world I no longer I I
[53:58] no longer do this I no longer love this
[54:00] my love is to Christ and Christ alone
[54:05] you've raised above the things of the
[54:08] earth now within that remember within
[54:11] our lives as Sons and Daughters of God I
[54:15] I know many times we are looking and
[54:17] think of this in terms of even as the
[54:20] spirit of adoption the holy ghost coming
[54:22] to produce full sunship that God is
[54:26] entrusting little by little to you and I
[54:29] to see how we handle little things like
[54:32] for example when you see when we hear
[54:35] about the prophet speaking to the storm
[54:37] it was not something that he was handed
[54:39] that test right away but there were
[54:41] other things that went little by little
[54:44] as testing grounds Proving Grounds
[54:47] preparing him for that moment and that's
[54:50] the same way it is with our lives God is
[54:54] testing and is proving now let me just
[54:56] say our submission to his
[55:00] voice no more than you could take your
[55:02] child and put their coat on them the
[55:05] Holy Spirit remember he's a gentleman he
[55:08] will not force us to grow up right he
[55:12] will not on our own but it is something
[55:14] that we in our lives out of love must
[55:17] grow up into him in all things and this
[55:20] is why with the scripture as it says
[55:22] right here set your minds and keep them
[55:26] on what is above as I said just moments
[55:29] ago there is the battle the
[55:31] Battlegrounds is constantly in your
[55:35] mind but I want to say this you don't
[55:38] have to live occupied with the things of
[55:41] the
[55:42] world there is a there is a way it's
[55:45] just like this this platform right here
[55:47] it's a space we could so fill this space
[55:51] till not one more thing could get on
[55:54] here pretty close to it now now we could
[55:56] so feel that um like maybe you could
[55:59] feel your pantry and you feel your
[56:00] pantry and you're finally like huh
[56:02] where' I put it let's get a shelf for
[56:03] the basement let's get a shelf for
[56:05] outside see your mind is a No Man's Land
[56:11] you decide what you're going to fill it
[56:14] with you're the one who decide now to me
[56:17] this is where my heart's just that
[56:19] little simple reality I want my mind you
[56:22] say brother Samuel our soul needs to be
[56:24] filled I know that I believe my soul is
[56:27] filled but I want my mind filled with
[56:31] [Music]
[56:33] God because the things you think on
[56:36] create an atmosphere around
[56:39] you is that right now I want you to
[56:42] think of this as we look at this on
[56:44] changing priorities and forsaking
[56:47] excuses brother bam says in the
[56:49] unwelcome Christ remember the the here
[56:51] as he's he's dealing with this of where
[56:53] Jesus was invited to the home of Simon
[56:56] the Pharisee but when they got there
[56:59] they just let him stand there brother
[57:01] Bram says we have other things too that
[57:03] we think more important my brother my
[57:07] sister the most important thing in your
[57:09] life is to entertain Jesus Christ and we
[57:13] believe that right now watch how the
[57:15] prophet places this is how we entertain
[57:18] him the most important thing in any life
[57:21] is to entertain Jesus Christ properly in
[57:25] first place in your worship first place
[57:29] in your life first place in Everything
[57:33] Jesus Christ deserves that place so as
[57:38] our husband it's us running every
[57:42] decision through him not because we're
[57:44] afraid of him not because I'm afraid I'm
[57:47] going to hell I just want to so please
[57:50] him I don't want to do anything that's
[57:53] going to take away from him I don't want
[57:56] anything that's going to extract his
[57:58] presence from my
[58:01] lifej that's what I value more than
[58:04] anything else is his presence it's him
[58:07] it's his
[58:08] word watch how brother Bram says this
[58:11] but if you don't he'll take second place
[58:14] he'll go down in the basement with you
[58:16] if you're ashamed of him when you're out
[58:18] among the people and then you go down in
[58:20] the basement so nobody will see you
[58:22] he'll still come that ought to make you
[58:25] love him above everything in the
[58:27] world why the Jesus Jesus himself he's a
[58:31] gentleman if you give him third place
[58:34] he'll take it if you give him fourth
[58:36] place he'll take it and let me just tell
[58:38] you let me just tell you something right
[58:40] now Jesus don't play shaming
[58:44] games you understand what I'm talking
[58:46] about where you're guilted into
[58:49] something guilted into getting somebody
[58:51] a gift shamed into calling somebody oh
[58:55] my come on now don't sit there you know
[58:57] what I'm talking
[58:58] about we've had things like that that
[59:01] Jesus doesn't do that he doesn't use his
[59:05] word to shame you because you know why
[59:08] right it'll continue to
[59:11] happen he wants you to love him he wants
[59:14] us to love him and sometimes the things
[59:17] that even that we don't even understand
[59:20] the value of but when we obey his voice
[59:24] the the value of that begins to be
[59:27] effectual in our
[59:29] lives because there's nothing greater
[59:32] than
[59:34] obedience obedience is better than any
[59:37] sacrifice we could do that's why Paul
[59:40] said though you could speak with tongue
[59:41] of men and angels though you understand
[59:43] all Mysteries though we give all my all
[59:45] of my goods to feed the poor and have
[59:47] not charity a Heart of Love in obedience
[59:51] to God to his word everything else means
[59:56] nothing now Ephesians 5 and verse1 15
[1:00:00] watch how Paul would give direction I'm
[1:00:03] so thankful to the word of God aren't
[1:00:04] you I'm thankful I'm thankful for the
[1:00:07] whole for the light of God upon his word
[1:00:10] in this hour that we're looking and we
[1:00:13] see the word of God as our absolute amen
[1:00:16] I'm thankful to God for that verse 15
[1:00:19] see then that you walk circumspectly not
[1:00:22] as fools but as wise let me just remind
[1:00:25] you this is the Ephesian church this is
[1:00:28] the church one of this is the church
[1:00:30] where brother Bram never had to you know
[1:00:32] talk about how gifts are to operate put
[1:00:34] gifts in order but listen what Paul did
[1:00:37] deal with as he did also in colossia
[1:00:39] each one of those churches had their own
[1:00:41] individual problems because every church
[1:00:44] has strengths and weaknesses so when
[1:00:47] we're looking at this this is that
[1:00:49] Ephesian uh the Ephesian Church remember
[1:00:52] this is the church that where some of
[1:00:54] the depth of of where that we were and
[1:00:57] our choosing it was in Christ before the
[1:01:00] foundation of the world but you
[1:01:02] recognize God himself does not leave us
[1:01:05] to guess or to wonder but he brings
[1:01:08] leadership to our lives of how in the
[1:01:11] midst of all this then we are to conduct
[1:01:13] our lives and he says you're to walk
[1:01:15] circumspectly that means diligently that
[1:01:18] means carefully that means observing and
[1:01:21] mindful of every step that you're taking
[1:01:23] you see the spirit of God his desire and
[1:01:26] this works in our life as Believers as
[1:01:29] we grow in him every step we make we
[1:01:32] want to be sure that we're stepping in a
[1:01:35] bloody
[1:01:36] footprint of the son of man we want to
[1:01:39] be sure I don't want to just you know
[1:01:40] hastily and just do something and say
[1:01:43] well you know there's forgiveness
[1:01:44] there's something that moves deeper that
[1:01:46] I want to be in Step I don't want to
[1:01:48] have to retract and go back I'm thankful
[1:01:50] for God's grace to do that but I I don't
[1:01:53] want to waste time on on
[1:01:55] that time is too precious it moments if
[1:01:59] you consider think about this God might
[1:02:03] have purposed you for this day to be a
[1:02:07] witness to someone you've never even
[1:02:11] seen that's why it's important that
[1:02:14] every single step of the way Lord I want
[1:02:16] to be in your
[1:02:18] presence I want to be in that place that
[1:02:20] Lord that your life can just radiate
[1:02:23] through me my verse 16 notice what he
[1:02:27] says Redeeming the time because the days
[1:02:29] are evil I won't ask you to raise your
[1:02:31] hands but probably throughout this
[1:02:34] congregation there is some things that
[1:02:36] you could be able to look at and say I'd
[1:02:39] like to get some time back oh yes true
[1:02:43] and I'm talking not necessarily of going
[1:02:45] back into the past we we can listen we
[1:02:47] can all set here as well wishers let me
[1:02:49] just tell you something a trap of the
[1:02:51] enemy is to get you trapped looking back
[1:02:54] in your past of something that you can
[1:02:57] never go back and change but what you
[1:02:59] can do is accept God's grace for this
[1:03:03] moment and he will take the sting and
[1:03:07] the hurt and all the condemnation and
[1:03:10] the torment that the devil has tried to
[1:03:12] bring on your life for past decisions
[1:03:15] that's what the Lord Jesus will do for
[1:03:20] youall
[1:03:23] Hallelujah we want to redeem the time
[1:03:27] now you know Redemption requires a
[1:03:30] sacrifice over our lives and seeing even
[1:03:34] at moments and times in our life when
[1:03:36] seasons and times where things can
[1:03:39] become very busy let let me give you an
[1:03:41] example with the young people at times
[1:03:43] whether it's been at Retreats camps or
[1:03:45] right there in the living room they go
[1:03:47] through Seasons sometimes where you'll
[1:03:48] find a week of testing and uh I'm
[1:03:51] talking about school test and and then
[1:03:52] even when they're uh going to to college
[1:03:54] and my sometimes it just seems like that
[1:03:57] the rain is just pouring down but this
[1:03:59] is the thing that I've mentioned even
[1:04:01] during that time this is what I found
[1:04:03] this is what what where I found in my
[1:04:05] own walk with God and that was it's not
[1:04:09] always altto together the quantity of
[1:04:12] time it's the
[1:04:15] quality that's so good is that right
[1:04:19] Paul said I would rather speak a few
[1:04:21] words and they understand than a whole
[1:04:23] bunch
[1:04:25] that's so it's not so much quality so
[1:04:27] we're geared to think quality is
[1:04:29] approval numbers are approval that we're
[1:04:31] geared in that way why that comes from
[1:04:34] that first
[1:04:35] birth are you hearing me that's good
[1:04:38] this church that I'm reading for they
[1:04:40] only had 12
[1:04:42] members that's exactly right now what
[1:04:46] I'm saying is is that in that of
[1:04:47] redeeming the time this is what I told
[1:04:50] the young people I said look there's
[1:04:52] times I said where you take rest of the
[1:04:54] brid tree what 3 hours 36 minutes h i
[1:04:58] put that in the tape deck that's when we
[1:05:00] had cassette tapes if you need to know
[1:05:01] what that is we'll tell you about that
[1:05:03] later but I would put that in the tape
[1:05:05] deck now going back and forth from
[1:05:07] school studying doing test and all that
[1:05:10] but that would be my tape time that
[1:05:12] would be my time outside of other times
[1:05:14] that maybe I would get here and there at
[1:05:16] home but the what I'm trying to say is
[1:05:18] is that sometimes Satan wants to shingly
[1:05:21] so fill everything to where you've got
[1:05:23] to step back and realize I'm in a season
[1:05:26] right now but if what Lord what time
[1:05:28] what time in this season I want you to
[1:05:31] be the Lord of it all I want you to be
[1:05:33] the influence of it all so show me Lord
[1:05:36] the times in here that I can redeem
[1:05:38] instead of saying oh I'm so overwhelmed
[1:05:41] oh this is so much help me to take that
[1:05:43] Lord God cuz it's my strength it's my
[1:05:45] shot in the
[1:05:48] arm Redeeming the
[1:05:52] time sometimes you you can become
[1:05:54] anxious when you think about all that
[1:05:56] has to be done in a short amount of
[1:05:59] time is that right so we can just take
[1:06:02] these practical parts to step back and
[1:06:04] say Lord show me Lord like I said with
[1:06:07] that message ah took me a couple weeks
[1:06:10] to get through it in the
[1:06:12] car brother Samu it took you a couple
[1:06:14] weeks listen friends it's not about I
[1:06:16] said this moments ago it's not about
[1:06:18] quantity amen you could listen let me
[1:06:21] just say this to you I'm listening to
[1:06:23] the message constantly but you could
[1:06:25] listen to the message five straight
[1:06:27] messages and and if you've not really
[1:06:31] been able to give yourself to it if
[1:06:34] you're just doing it out of quantity I
[1:06:36] believe there's things that we receive
[1:06:39] while we're hearing the word that many
[1:06:41] times we're not even aware what's taking
[1:06:43] place I believe that the Bible said
[1:06:47] scripture brother Samuel good kingdom of
[1:06:49] God cometh without
[1:06:52] observation there's things that God has
[1:06:54] is done for you right while the words
[1:06:55] coming forth that all you look back and
[1:06:57] say thank you Lord thank
[1:07:01] you now to redeem the time it means to
[1:07:04] recover from the power of another to
[1:07:07] Ransom or to buy off now that's what he
[1:07:10] did that's what the Lord Jesus did for
[1:07:13] us in bringing us to himself now watch
[1:07:15] how this applies to us to buy up for
[1:07:18] oneself for one's use to make wise and
[1:07:22] sacred use of every opportunity Unity
[1:07:24] for doing good so that Zeal and wello
[1:07:29] are as it were the purchase money by
[1:07:32] which we make the time our own that's so
[1:07:35] that's so good that's so good can I just
[1:07:38] say I'm just going to preach as this is
[1:07:42] coming I'm not going to tell you what to
[1:07:45] do and what not to do but I'm going to
[1:07:46] say this to you it's things sometimes
[1:07:49] that you don't need to well I'm going to
[1:07:51] binge one way and I'm not going to do
[1:07:53] anything I'm going to cut everybody off
[1:07:55] and I'm just going to get in my closet
[1:07:57] and I'm going to do this no listen you
[1:08:00] need to ask God teach me how to live in
[1:08:04] Victory In the Heat of the
[1:08:07] battle sometimes we need a reset are you
[1:08:09] hear me sometimes we need to come aside
[1:08:12] but you need to ask God Teach Me How To
[1:08:14] Live In the Heat of the battle when the
[1:08:16] arrows are flying when everything's
[1:08:18] around me Teach Me Lord teach My Hands
[1:08:21] to War amen
[1:08:27] verse 17 wherefore be ye not unwise but
[1:08:31] understanding what the will of the Lord
[1:08:33] is that's very important the will of the
[1:08:35] Lord God's will is to be born again
[1:08:39] right amen and to grow up in him into
[1:08:43] all
[1:08:43] things that's why we want to seek his
[1:08:46] will in all
[1:08:47] things the Bible goes on to say in in
[1:08:51] Ephesians 5:18 watch these NexTrip
[1:08:53] scriptures be not drunk with wine
[1:08:55] wherein is excess but be filled with the
[1:08:59] spirit speaking to yourselves this is
[1:09:02] what's appropriate speaking to
[1:09:04] yourselves in Psalms hymns spiritual
[1:09:07] songs singing making Mel in your heart
[1:09:10] to the Lord giving thanks always for all
[1:09:14] things unto God and the father in the
[1:09:16] name of our Lord Jesus Christ brother
[1:09:18] Samuel you don't know my circumstance I
[1:09:20] can't give thanks about my circumstance
[1:09:23] I didn't say that neither did the word
[1:09:25] it says giving thanks that I'm in my
[1:09:27] right mind though everything is breaking
[1:09:29] loose all around thank you Lord for your
[1:09:32] protection thank you Lord that there is
[1:09:35] a hope within that I know that my
[1:09:37] redeemer
[1:09:39] liveth giving thanks to the Lord in all
[1:09:45] things Hallelujah notice the effect of
[1:09:48] it notice the effect of being filled
[1:09:51] with the spirit of God that's why the
[1:09:53] the prophet said he said I'm convinced
[1:09:55] in the message Oneness he said we have
[1:09:57] just been filled enough we don't drink
[1:10:00] no more we don't smoke no more we don't
[1:10:02] do this no more he said matter of fact
[1:10:04] we don't want to do anything he said but
[1:10:05] God wants to fill every fiber of our
[1:10:09] being he wants to feel our thinking he
[1:10:12] wants to so feel Our Lives to where our
[1:10:15] words have become his words
[1:10:20] amen I say God help us fill every fiber
[1:10:25] Lord fill every channel
[1:10:27] Lord if there's any channel where
[1:10:30] there's any AOS Terrace hiding out flood
[1:10:33] it Lord with your presence oh God flood
[1:10:35] them out of there Lord God flood it out
[1:10:38] to a place that's Revival flood it out
[1:10:41] Lord Oh Brother we've got more water
[1:10:43] present than what they have in the ocean
[1:10:45] to flood those tunnels we've got more
[1:10:48] than a pump to put them in there the
[1:10:50] Holy Spirit himself is the life of God
[1:10:53] we're not just in ankle deep water we're
[1:10:56] not just in Waist Deep Water but the
[1:10:58] promise of this hour is this water has
[1:11:01] become life to you and I we are swimming
[1:11:04] in it as it said in Ezekiel we're not
[1:11:07] waiting in the promises of God we are
[1:11:10] bathing and our lives are consumed with
[1:11:14] his
[1:11:16] presence
[1:11:18] Hallelujah we have a choice though we
[1:11:20] can become drunken with the cares of
[1:11:23] this life
[1:11:29] true the effect of this is it submits
[1:11:32] oneself ourselves one to
[1:11:34] another this is why we come down into
[1:11:38] this here this is
[1:11:42] why we want to just be very mindful of
[1:11:46] the time and where we're standing
[1:11:49] um Kim if you'll go to spiritual food
[1:11:52] and do season there I want to read that
[1:11:54] quote almost called her honey
[1:11:58] that's Paul when Paul was little he
[1:12:00] would go around behind her when I wasn't
[1:12:02] around and in the middle of sisters
[1:12:04] everybody he honey honey
[1:12:07] honey we were laughing about that the
[1:12:09] other
[1:12:12] night but noce spiritual food and due
[1:12:14] season like Elisha of old Elijah if God
[1:12:19] be God then serve him aren't you glad
[1:12:21] that God what he did for them on Mount
[1:12:24] Carmel he does the same thing for you
[1:12:26] and I he not only has done it but in
[1:12:29] every situation that we put before him
[1:12:33] he'll declare his
[1:12:35] will there's things that we can try to
[1:12:37] make his
[1:12:39] will no fire comes no fire
[1:12:43] comes but when we just do it according
[1:12:46] to his
[1:12:47] word not according to any of our
[1:12:50] Impressions not according to feelings
[1:12:53] right
[1:12:53] but when it's according to his will you
[1:12:57] say Brother Sam how do I how do I know
[1:13:00] that what I'm doing is according to his
[1:13:01] will well first of all there won't be
[1:13:03] anything in the word to contradict
[1:13:05] it and you examine your motive and your
[1:13:08] desire behind
[1:13:10] it and I can tell you this if you're
[1:13:13] anxious about it let it
[1:13:15] alone because the spirit of God is not
[1:13:19] an anxious Spirit that's yes sir even
[1:13:23] when it says to move in haste that's not
[1:13:25] anxiousness it means with the confidence
[1:13:28] God is directing
[1:13:31] this
[1:13:33] amen notice and if Jesus is the center
[1:13:36] of all things to the Christian then I
[1:13:38] think we ought to let loose of
[1:13:40] everything else and cleave to him
[1:13:43] remember he is the center he's the North
[1:13:45] Star he is the ultimate he is the
[1:13:48] absolute and if he's the North Star
[1:13:50] there's only one thing that will point
[1:13:51] to that North Star that's your compass
[1:13:53] that you're selling with and the compass
[1:13:55] that I'm trying to sell with is the word
[1:13:58] trying you to sell with is the word have
[1:14:00] you to sell with and the word always
[1:14:02] points to him so if internally remember
[1:14:06] when the spirit of Truth is come he will
[1:14:09] lead and guide you into all truth he
[1:14:12] will take that which is of mine and
[1:14:14] reveal it unto you that's what the holy
[1:14:17] spirit is he is the compass he is the
[1:14:20] word inside of you and I and that is the
[1:14:24] strength of the believer is the word
[1:14:28] inside of you it's not a l it's the
[1:14:33] person of Jesus Christ it's the
[1:14:35] quickening power that has brought that
[1:14:38] seed to life and your life is a
[1:14:40] reflection of his life and then that
[1:14:44] Compass what's it always pointing to the
[1:14:46] North Star right now you can take that
[1:14:48] compass and walk over here but if that
[1:14:51] Compass is only going to point to the
[1:14:52] North Star you might get pointed in a
[1:14:54] wrong direction are you hearing me you
[1:14:57] or me might get pointed in a wrong
[1:14:59] direction and not necessarily with our
[1:15:01] feet it might be your
[1:15:04] attitude it might be your
[1:15:07] priorities might be things you're
[1:15:09] deliberating on but the compass on the
[1:15:13] inside if you'll pay heed to that and
[1:15:16] just consider the compass not your
[1:15:18] feelings but consider the compass
[1:15:20] because the compass will always direct
[1:15:22] you to the work and everything that God
[1:15:25] has for you in life even the natural
[1:15:27] things will not take away from the
[1:15:29] revelation of Jesus
[1:15:31] Christ it'll only highlight his care his
[1:15:34] love his glory his Mercy for your life
[1:15:37] amen it never anything even in the
[1:15:40] natural does not diminish Jesus Christ
[1:15:42] when we're walking in step with
[1:15:45] him this is why in First Peter 4:1 watch
[1:15:49] how Peter says this you know Peter Peter
[1:15:52] wrote a lot under inspir oparation of
[1:15:54] how the Believers were to conduct
[1:15:55] themselves even in the last days and
[1:15:57] with battles and pressure and everything
[1:16:00] going on watch how he says this for as
[1:16:02] much then as Christ ha suffered for us
[1:16:04] in the flesh arm yourselves likewise
[1:16:08] with the same
[1:16:10] mind for he that hath suffered In the
[1:16:12] Flesh hath ceased from
[1:16:15] sin this same mind what was this mind
[1:16:17] let this mind that was in Christ amen be
[1:16:21] in you also what is is the mind of
[1:16:25] Christ that's the privilege oh I think
[1:16:27] how brother Bram says it in the message
[1:16:28] he says oh to think the privilege we
[1:16:31] have as Believers to enter into the mind
[1:16:34] of Christ am the privilege that when
[1:16:37] situations or decisions I'm glad I'm
[1:16:40] glad that it's not just me my wife
[1:16:42] family sitting at the table but I'm glad
[1:16:44] he's at the head of the table hallelujah
[1:16:49] amen I'm glad and he's not just sitting
[1:16:52] there as a picture I want to know what
[1:16:54] he
[1:16:55] wants I want to know what he
[1:16:59] wants is that how you feel I want to
[1:17:02] know how he wants I want him to be
[1:17:04] glorified yes I don't want to presume we
[1:17:06] we should we should that's what the
[1:17:08] grace of God comes to do Deliver Us from
[1:17:11] presuming venturing without Authority
[1:17:14] that's what God's grace in this hour
[1:17:15] comes to do we're walking in God's will
[1:17:18] at this
[1:17:19] moment sir let me go
[1:17:21] on to be armed with that that he that he
[1:17:25] no longer should live the rest of his
[1:17:27] time in the flesh to the lust of men but
[1:17:30] to the will of God notice how this verse
[1:17:32] is written it almost sounds like there's
[1:17:35] been a disembodiment but yet there's not
[1:17:38] but what's happened is as the quickening
[1:17:40] power has come you have been raised up
[1:17:43] into Heavenly places your thinking is
[1:17:46] Heavenly amen your thoughts everything
[1:17:49] there moving about your life is about
[1:17:51] him listen that even takes place when
[1:17:54] God lifts and you experience when you
[1:17:56] repented of your sins and you experience
[1:17:59] that where the load is lifted off of all
[1:18:01] your past sin listen it only goes deeper
[1:18:06] as he sanctifies and then he relieves
[1:18:08] the condemnation by any connection with
[1:18:13] him who influenced you to do it in the
[1:18:15] first
[1:18:16] place hallelujah
[1:18:19] amen and here you walk in this Veil same
[1:18:23] Veil same
[1:18:25] Veil but on the inside you're a new
[1:18:27] creation that's what the Holy Ghost
[1:18:30] comes to
[1:18:31] do it does not reform us it does not
[1:18:35] come down and give us five steps to a
[1:18:38] better you let me just tell you there's
[1:18:40] not a better you than the you that was
[1:18:42] in the mind of
[1:18:45] godall you can wash it up clean it up
[1:18:48] everything else but it's still a
[1:18:51] sinner there's only one thing and that
[1:18:54] is die and be born again die to your
[1:18:58] thinking die to your thoughts die to
[1:19:01] your own ideas die to your will and be
[1:19:04] born again brother Samuel what are you
[1:19:05] saying change your priorities amen
[1:19:10] yes and in his presence if you'll just
[1:19:13] allow him he'll dismantle every excuse
[1:19:17] and every excuse that seems to stand
[1:19:19] there and vaunt itself against you no
[1:19:21] matter where you're at in your life in
[1:19:23] his presence he'll dismantle
[1:19:26] it are you hearing me this is not uh
[1:19:30] psyche of the mind I'm talking in the
[1:19:32] presence of God where there's authority
[1:19:33] to dismantle every
[1:19:36] hold to deal with every Spirit to deal
[1:19:40] with things that's haunted in that life
[1:19:43] to deal with things that you can look at
[1:19:45] and say I know what God's done for me
[1:19:48] but Lord I Need Your Grace for this
[1:19:50] moment there is Grace to deal with that
[1:19:54] Hallelujah to take on that same mind to
[1:19:57] be busy about this is what it means now
[1:20:00] let me just get in here to this message
[1:20:02] the influence of
[1:20:03] another I want you just to listen to
[1:20:06] this
[1:20:07] here it says you take a family of people
[1:20:11] that will start going to church and God
[1:20:13] will heal that heal that little family
[1:20:17] he will bless them and give them the
[1:20:19] holy spirit in their life the little
[1:20:21] children will pray around the table
[1:20:24] they'll pray before they go to bed
[1:20:26] mother and father will join hands and
[1:20:28] pray I want you to watch this statement
[1:20:31] and as long as they
[1:20:33] continue like that they'll stay a family
[1:20:37] right so right here we've just received
[1:20:40] what is a definition of a family a
[1:20:42] family is not just a male and a female
[1:20:46] and kids right husband and a wife and
[1:20:49] kids that's it's more than that remember
[1:20:53] family is not of the world that's why
[1:20:57] organizations that have come on even in
[1:20:59] these last
[1:21:01] days have sworn to the destruction of
[1:21:05] the traditional family oh I could call
[1:21:08] those organizations out I've got their
[1:21:10] I've got their mission statements right
[1:21:13] here
[1:21:14] that's and some of these things were
[1:21:16] people just getting sucked into and
[1:21:18] marching along with they don't realize
[1:21:19] you know why it's a spirit of this age
[1:21:24] that's right that's right Satan wanting
[1:21:26] to direct people to the wrong
[1:21:30] things is that
[1:21:32] right now within this part of it here
[1:21:36] notice a family God
[1:21:39] himself God is a
[1:21:42] family he is a family God is one but in
[1:21:46] him were
[1:21:48] attributes in him just like you were in
[1:21:50] your father I was in my father father
[1:21:53] even the scripture said Levi paid tithes
[1:21:57] to
[1:21:58] MDC he was in the loin of
[1:22:03] Abraham and God reckon it to him how did
[1:22:05] he reckon it to him he could see he's of
[1:22:08] the same
[1:22:10] DNA when I make myself known to him he
[1:22:13] will act just like Abraham act when MDC
[1:22:17] reveals himself among his children his
[1:22:20] children give him
[1:22:23] preeminence you want this you want that
[1:22:25] you want this I'll not take a sho
[1:22:27] latchet I'm not here in this world to
[1:22:30] serve myself I'm here to serve his
[1:22:34] purpose that's what Abraham was
[1:22:36] declaring when lady o see and all the
[1:22:39] kings and all the riches and all the
[1:22:41] spoils want to try to take his attention
[1:22:44] isn't it incredible all of that was
[1:22:45] taking place all around but he was
[1:22:47] locked in on
[1:22:48] MDC
[1:22:51] hallelujah oh brother brother Samuel I
[1:22:53] have hdhd whatever they call that well
[1:22:56] let me just tell you you might you might
[1:22:58] deal with certain things in the natural
[1:23:00] but make sure you're not dealing with it
[1:23:01] spiritually get locked into his presence
[1:23:04] right there it'll settle you it'll calm
[1:23:06] you it'll guide you it'll direct you it
[1:23:09] will release the virtue you have need of
[1:23:11] for this moment and each day of your
[1:23:16] life and as long as they continue like
[1:23:19] that they'll stay a family so what so if
[1:23:22] they don't stay like that what happens
[1:23:23] well they can still be family as far as
[1:23:27] what's that definition but it's not a
[1:23:29] family the way that God thinks of
[1:23:32] it so this part of it that I just read
[1:23:35] it's where God brought that family
[1:23:37] restores it heals that family Brokenness
[1:23:41] is restore all of that an't that
[1:23:43] wonderful first thing you know they
[1:23:46] didn't have nothing an old junk car
[1:23:48] maybe riding around in or maybe walking
[1:23:52] finally they'll get a good car and a
[1:23:54] Better Home and the first thing you know
[1:23:56] then they want to to to get to what they
[1:23:59] call the world calls a better class to
[1:24:02] associate with they move into a
[1:24:04] different neighborhood and in there they
[1:24:08] find out they become influenced by the
[1:24:11] wrong
[1:24:13] influence I'm sure some of you have
[1:24:15] probably found this out too there are
[1:24:16] certain stores you can go in you know
[1:24:18] when you there's certain things as you
[1:24:20] get older like my boys they tease me or
[1:24:22] Dad's shoes I said what till you get my
[1:24:23] age of got teres you'll find out the
[1:24:25] shoes you wear and you stand on you
[1:24:27] better they're they got to be
[1:24:28] comfortable I said even my dress shoes I
[1:24:31] I get dress shoes that I can stand on
[1:24:32] for hours not that I plan on preaching
[1:24:35] for hours but I I could walk I'm telling
[1:24:37] you the the they're more comfortable to
[1:24:39] me than than tennis
[1:24:41] shoes but even some of the tennis anyhow
[1:24:43] how do we get off on that but my point
[1:24:45] is this you can go into certain places
[1:24:48] and you go in there and you feel like
[1:24:49] woo country boy in the city you know you
[1:24:53] you want to straighten up your yalls and
[1:24:54] say have you
[1:24:57] all in the gray
[1:24:59] Pon you know you you get around and
[1:25:02] maybe you don't feel that way but
[1:25:03] sometime it was like the first time that
[1:25:05] they brought me on the first class they
[1:25:07] you know they graduated me to first
[1:25:09] class and I walk in there and they say
[1:25:10] can I take your jacket my
[1:25:12] jacket I know I'm used to cattle class
[1:25:15] my jacket yeah and here's your slippers
[1:25:17] sir here's your menu you need anything
[1:25:20] you want right now here's your newspaper
[1:25:22] here's this here's that man you can get
[1:25:24] used to that kind of
[1:25:25] Life I'll be ready to fly anywhere like
[1:25:28] that but you know you come into some of
[1:25:30] those places like that and uh you know
[1:25:33] you feel you feel like how did I get
[1:25:36] here right you feel you feel out class
[1:25:39] but notice what the prophet is saying
[1:25:41] listen friends this is why Spirits out
[1:25:44] there are very real don't ever ever feel
[1:25:48] like well I'm around the message and
[1:25:50] I've got the message and I know this oh
[1:25:52] brother samel I would never do that but
[1:25:54] you see sometimes we'll say I would
[1:25:55] never say that but if we walk otherwise
[1:25:59] in a careless manner we're saying
[1:26:03] that is is why we've got to walk
[1:26:09] circumspectly notice they'll become
[1:26:11] influenced by the wrong influence you
[1:26:14] must always watch this admonition stay
[1:26:17] where the kingdom of God is and where
[1:26:20] the glory of God is pouring out amen
[1:26:24] stay where you can be spiritually fed
[1:26:27] day and night he says then the first
[1:26:30] thing you know separations come in the
[1:26:31] home worldliness and they get lifted up
[1:26:33] now notice what he's saying when he's
[1:26:35] saying stay where the kingdom of God is
[1:26:39] where the glory of the Lord is pouring
[1:26:40] out and stay where you can be
[1:26:42] spiritually fed day and night this is
[1:26:45] speaking I want you to understand
[1:26:48] now from what brother Bram has just said
[1:26:51] in this quote he's not saying anything
[1:26:53] about having a better car I mean listen
[1:26:56] I'm grateful to have a better car I I
[1:26:58] remember when Kim when my wife when I
[1:27:00] first got married I remember where the
[1:27:02] transmission in my in the car you go to
[1:27:05] you go to press gas at this green light
[1:27:08] and it would catch and
[1:27:12] go I remember you know we had that it
[1:27:15] was a hand me- down but I'm glad I was
[1:27:16] glad for I hand me down we had my dad
[1:27:18] let me use his truck you know we called
[1:27:21] that the Kahuna that big old you
[1:27:22] remember that big old brown truck my dad
[1:27:24] had we have that and my wife took some
[1:27:25] spins you know with you driving in the
[1:27:27] snow with that
[1:27:30] thing yeah I appreciate I I'm thankful
[1:27:33] I'm thankful to I I am I'm thankful to
[1:27:35] the Lord for for it so brother BR the
[1:27:37] the listen the word of God is not
[1:27:40] teaching us oh that it's wrong to have a
[1:27:43] better car or if you have a better house
[1:27:45] but what it's saying is is that don't
[1:27:48] allow those to become the priorities
[1:27:52] if our focus is on God God will give us
[1:27:56] what we can handle let me tell you
[1:27:59] something I would rather be in God's
[1:28:01] will I believe we Fellowship on this I
[1:28:03] would rather be on in God's will that
[1:28:05] means peace in my mind and not have to
[1:28:09] worry can I make this bill meet this
[1:28:12] bill meet this bill I would rather be in
[1:28:15] his will and not have things like that
[1:28:17] on my mind that's right that's right
[1:28:20] that's just that that that's me and I
[1:28:22] believe that's scriptural but I'm not
[1:28:23] I'm just telling you I don't want
[1:28:25] nothing when I sit down and here I am
[1:28:28] waiting and I'm looking to the Lord to
[1:28:30] receive and Lord what would you have for
[1:28:32] your people I don't want to have to weed
[1:28:34] through stuff when I'm praying about
[1:28:36] things I don't want to have to weed
[1:28:37] through stuff I'd
[1:28:39] rather not have anything and I think you
[1:28:43] can read into that than to be worried in
[1:28:46] my
[1:28:50] mind oh oh my so we want to stay that
[1:28:55] means our our heart remember set your
[1:28:58] mind and then seeking after those things
[1:29:00] let me just try to get us to a place
[1:29:02] here this morning I want you to think of
[1:29:04] this quote when we read this these are
[1:29:07] things Satan does not make
[1:29:10] moves just right out as to notice it he
[1:29:15] comes in
[1:29:17] slowly that that's that's how he came in
[1:29:21] in that first stage just slowly brother
[1:29:23] BR says he makes a move has so not to be
[1:29:26] detected he don't want to be detected
[1:29:30] let me tell you something you or I are
[1:29:33] not able to detect Satan's working on
[1:29:36] our own accord that's that's why we need
[1:29:39] the discernment of the Holy Spirit by
[1:29:43] the
[1:29:44] word so don't feel like oh I should be
[1:29:47] this no no Lord you're my husband you
[1:29:50] Lord I'm looking to you you're my guide
[1:29:52] amen Lord you know you you you you can
[1:29:54] see the things that's coming that I'm
[1:29:55] not even aware of and you also see the
[1:29:57] things that I might think oh this is a
[1:29:59] this is a lamb but on the inside it's
[1:30:02] it's a
[1:30:04] lion
[1:30:06] right so everything that we do
[1:30:10] decisions you know is to be prayerfully
[1:30:13] well brother Samuel this is simple I
[1:30:15] know it is but you know to be pray forly
[1:30:19] it's kind of like with the one
[1:30:20] individual he was asked to go pastor a
[1:30:22] church and he told his wife he said you
[1:30:23] go pack the bags while I
[1:30:26] pray we're going to see if it's God's
[1:30:28] will but you pack while I'm
[1:30:29] praying
[1:30:32] yeah yeah but prayerfully now brother
[1:30:35] Samuel if I'm seeking God's will that's
[1:30:38] the value that even even even in the car
[1:30:42] that I buy even in the home even in
[1:30:45] Little Things yes we want to seek his
[1:30:48] will I desire his approval now I'm just
[1:30:50] going to tell you you know right now now
[1:30:52] right now don't call me as your pastor
[1:30:53] and say Brother Sam is it all right for
[1:30:55] me to buy a car because I'm not going to
[1:30:57] tell
[1:30:59] you I'm not your master I'm not your
[1:31:01] boss I'm your pastor there can be
[1:31:04] questions I'll ask you but there are not
[1:31:06] questions and I need answers for there's
[1:31:08] questions that you have to be able to
[1:31:09] answer right right many of you know that
[1:31:13] there's questions I've asked you in
[1:31:14] office I told you I I don't want the
[1:31:15] answer I'm just asking you these
[1:31:16] questions and then you need to talk
[1:31:17] about
[1:31:18] them because we need that
[1:31:22] now prayerfully sometimes when we're
[1:31:24] praying about God's will is this all
[1:31:26] right hope
[1:31:29] so but you know sometimes we're praying
[1:31:32] about something oh yeah man this is this
[1:31:33] is this is real good this is real good
[1:31:35] well that don't mean to stop praying
[1:31:37] right you pray even more you know why
[1:31:41] because God even knows the change that's
[1:31:43] coming in your life of the decision
[1:31:46] you're praying about and the more that
[1:31:47] you pray about it it's God going to
[1:31:50] condition your heart for that
[1:31:52] moment are you hearing me his will when
[1:31:56] we're praying many times about his will
[1:31:58] my I need to try to get to a place
[1:32:01] here
[1:32:03] hallelujah this is why when the prophet
[1:32:05] says in the saman church age you think
[1:32:08] of the scripture you abide in me and my
[1:32:09] words abide in you ask what you will and
[1:32:11] it shall be done brother BR said no True
[1:32:13] Believer is any stronger and spiritually
[1:32:17] healthy and Alive than his knowledge of
[1:32:21] and adherence to the pure word of God
[1:32:25] how many knows the scripture said for a
[1:32:26] lack of knowledge my people perish
[1:32:29] that's right it's God speaking to our
[1:32:31] lives and not just to know it but Lord I
[1:32:34] want to adhere to it with all my heart I
[1:32:37] want my life to be so given to it let me
[1:32:40] just try to to bring this here uh to a
[1:32:43] to a to a certain place here this
[1:32:45] morning think of this and I want you to
[1:32:48] think back to the to the scripture that
[1:32:50] we read in our opening text
[1:32:52] text and maybe we'll pull from this in
[1:32:55] our opening text where the scripture
[1:32:57] said set your mind if you're risen with
[1:33:01] Christ then seek those things that be
[1:33:03] above uh that of Christ where he set it
[1:33:07] at the right hand of God I want you to
[1:33:08] think about what's at the right hand of
[1:33:10] God in Psalms
[1:33:12] 1611 David said in thy presence is
[1:33:16] fullness of joy and at thy right hand
[1:33:20] there are pleasures ever
[1:33:22] more there's no pleasure of the world
[1:33:26] that can compare to
[1:33:30] this if you feel that way then you've
[1:33:32] never experienced the pleasure of the
[1:33:35] Lord in that of his realities that's so
[1:33:38] good and that's what you need you need
[1:33:40] to let that be the priority Lord that's
[1:33:42] what I want to be a priority I'm listen
[1:33:43] when I'm talking about this here I'm not
[1:33:45] just talking about friends just coming
[1:33:47] to church and we just come to church and
[1:33:50] we just fulfill a Duty neither is this
[1:33:53] talking about we come to church and my
[1:33:56] my goodness wasn't that a tremendous
[1:33:58] song it's got to go
[1:34:01] deeper it's got to go deeper to where
[1:34:04] our lives are being changed our will is
[1:34:07] being
[1:34:08] dissolved in his
[1:34:12] presence because
[1:34:14] listen anointing can come and anointing
[1:34:17] does come but what matters you do not
[1:34:19] live by
[1:34:20] anointing God I can't get to that this
[1:34:23] morning you do not live by that and the
[1:34:25] Holy Ghost is not fed by it he's fed by
[1:34:28] the word of God and if you really
[1:34:31] understand what the anointing is the
[1:34:32] anointing is the person of Jesus Christ
[1:34:35] it is the word himself amen amen and it
[1:34:39] leads us to a place of
[1:34:41] submission are you hearing me it doesn't
[1:34:44] lead us to a place of you know listen
[1:34:46] friends I you know I I could speak on
[1:34:48] this with emotion I'm an emotional guy
[1:34:49] but that's how God has made me up but
[1:34:51] it's not just emotion it's got to come
[1:34:54] deep it's got to come to the place to
[1:34:56] where our will is surrendered to his
[1:35:00] will not just enough to get under it
[1:35:02] like the jump rope and we we're jumping
[1:35:04] in the jump rope and and then after
[1:35:05] that's over we're
[1:35:08] done it's got to go deeper we have to
[1:35:10] change our
[1:35:14] priorities oh my Psalms 110 ver1 the
[1:35:18] Lord said unto my Lord sit thou at my
[1:35:21] right hand and until I make thine
[1:35:24] enemies thy foot
[1:35:26] stol when you're seeking after him the
[1:35:30] things let me just try to wrap this up I
[1:35:32] got one more quote I'm going to read and
[1:35:33] I'll
[1:35:35] stop you realize what this is saying as
[1:35:38] you're seeking of that which is above
[1:35:41] and where Satan is one to always try to
[1:35:43] take your mind and pull you down right
[1:35:45] he try to get you down looking at your
[1:35:47] faults looking at your failures looking
[1:35:50] at your job looking at you this and
[1:35:52] listen you have to pay attention to
[1:35:53] things right but listen as you keep your
[1:35:57] eyes on him he will bring and give you
[1:36:00] leadership in all of these things right
[1:36:02] here yes you see he you see God's not a
[1:36:05] distraction he's the
[1:36:07] attraction anything outside of him is a
[1:36:10] distraction that's right it's taking
[1:36:13] away is that right that's why the
[1:36:16] prophet said the Revelation that God
[1:36:18] wants to bring out in your life he said
[1:36:20] you let so many other things get it out
[1:36:22] of you you see how powerful that is that
[1:36:25] it shows it it's it's it's entered in
[1:36:30] but then other things come along and
[1:36:31] it's just
[1:36:33] like it just starts knocking it Knocking
[1:36:36] it out of us you you know how it is when
[1:36:37] you start out to do something you know
[1:36:39] maybe sisters start out to uh do
[1:36:41] something and all of a sudden here comes
[1:36:42] a thought oh yeah I better go do that
[1:36:46] isn't it incredible when you get down to
[1:36:47] pray oh you need to go do this you need
[1:36:50] to go do that
[1:36:53] hey why don't you go sit in the corner
[1:36:55] and when I'm done you can remind me of
[1:36:57] all the things else I need to
[1:37:00] do you know what I'm saying you know
[1:37:02] what I'm saying it's a truth you get
[1:37:04] down on your knees and all of a sudden
[1:37:05] you're start oh you know what I forgot
[1:37:07] this oh isn't it amazing how we remember
[1:37:09] at that time well brother Samuel what is
[1:37:12] that that's are important things I I
[1:37:13] agree but it's also things that where
[1:37:16] Satan will use little things that are
[1:37:19] seemingly harmless to destroy us from
[1:37:22] his presence cuz this is what happens in
[1:37:24] his presence and let me leave you here
[1:37:26] is in his presence he will dismantle
[1:37:30] every enemy every tongue every word
[1:37:33] every accusation every excuse everything
[1:37:37] he will make it bow
[1:37:39] amen at his feet and if you didn't know
[1:37:42] it you are his
[1:37:44] feet as the prophet stood there when
[1:37:46] that Maniac came across remember he
[1:37:50] challenged yes and the Holy Spirit took
[1:37:53] his Challenge and said you will fall
[1:37:56] across my feet tonight the feet of the
[1:37:59] holy spirit that night was a size
[1:38:01] whatever William
[1:38:03] brandom and let me just say this to you
[1:38:06] that what took place in Oregon you're
[1:38:08] facing Spirits every
[1:38:10] day you're facing things every day that
[1:38:13] wants to try to work on you wants to try
[1:38:15] to work at me and pull Upon Our Minds
[1:38:18] pull and get us away just like God could
[1:38:20] deal with the heart and that mind starts
[1:38:22] moving towards that of yes Lord yes Lord
[1:38:25] I I need you Lord I want to surrender my
[1:38:27] life to you and all of a sudden here
[1:38:28] come a thought to try to turn your mind
[1:38:30] another way then you get outside of
[1:38:32] church here comes another thought this
[1:38:34] is why it is the best to act upon the
[1:38:37] word while God is dealing with it say
[1:38:40] amen and surrender your all and watch
[1:38:44] him make every enemy bow at your feet
[1:38:48] every excuse be dismantled every
[1:38:51] argument every reasoning every tongue
[1:38:54] that's been raised in judgment against
[1:38:56] you no weapon shall prosper against
[1:39:00] [Applause]
[1:39:02] [Music]
[1:39:04] you Hallelujah this is the is the
[1:39:08] realities of seeking after
[1:39:12] him let me tell you something your
[1:39:14] answer your answer can drop at any time
[1:39:17] at anywhere it can drop right here it
[1:39:20] can drop while you're driving it can
[1:39:21] drop while you're working it can drop
[1:39:23] while you're in the bed it can drop
[1:39:24] while you're kneeling because why your
[1:39:26] connection is not just a church
[1:39:28] connection or an affiliation you are
[1:39:31] connected with him seated in Heavenly
[1:39:34] places hallelujah
[1:39:37] hallelujah you've got a backstage pass
[1:39:41] you've got
[1:39:45] access no wonder the Song of Solomon

[1:39:51] yeah in the secret of thy stairs My Love
[1:39:56] She Knows the hidden passages she knows
[1:39:59] the secret channels into his presence
[1:40:02] she knows what it is to capture his
[1:40:06] presence what is is to capture the king
[1:40:09] and hold him captive is when our heart
[1:40:11] says Glory yes my
[1:40:14] Lord yes it holds the king captive prise
[1:40:20] the Lord
[1:40:25] oh my you love
[1:40:29] him let me close upon this part of it
[1:40:33] here we just out of the message of
[1:40:37] shamed brother Brown's referring
[1:40:40] to the condition that was out in Arizona
[1:40:43] with where the people had followed him
[1:40:44] out there and they had no church to go
[1:40:47] to and brother Bram would see remember
[1:40:50] he talked aled about this quite
[1:40:51] extensively saw spiritual life drying up
[1:40:55] even among the people that followed him
[1:40:56] out there they were the you know the
[1:40:59] kids were outside riding their bikes and
[1:41:01] things on Sunday and they no place to go
[1:41:04] and uh and so brother Bram he he talks
[1:41:09] about it all the way all the way around
[1:41:11] of that period of time from 64 65 and
[1:41:13] he's talking about it and now you know
[1:41:16] that was a burden I've spoke on that to
[1:41:18] you here brother Bram expresses that in
[1:41:20] what house were you me that was a burden
[1:41:21] to have a place an assembly to go now
[1:41:24] watch how brother Bram makes this
[1:41:25] statement
[1:41:26] here and I want you to think about that
[1:41:29] seeking our
[1:41:31] mindset on Christ brother Bram says and
[1:41:36] you stay under the spirit of God he's
[1:41:38] talking about the spiritual dryness
[1:41:40] there he says you stay under the spirit
[1:41:43] of God and your
[1:41:45] life
[1:41:47] becomes
[1:41:48] sweet tender like water brings this
[1:41:52] grass and soft
[1:41:55] buds well what happens if you don't stay
[1:41:57] under it you start to die right and when
[1:42:01] you start to die remember the cactus the
[1:42:05] pricklies on the crack Cactus they're
[1:42:07] actually
[1:42:08] leaves but when there is lack of water
[1:42:11] it becomes
[1:42:14] prickly but under the presence of God
[1:42:16] this is why he says You must stay did
[1:42:18] you hear we must
[1:42:19] stay under the spirit of God so this
[1:42:21] isn't just something hey you're born of
[1:42:23] the spirit of God no more no worries

[1:42:35] got to grow and grow and grow we we we
[1:42:40] we learn how to walk we start learning
[1:42:41] how to

[1:42:46] that some point I made in service they
[1:42:47] were telling me they said you should
[1:42:48] have heard what the reason people were

[1:43:10] we I don't want to get off on that but

[1:43:14] this is why it's important to
[1:43:16] grow grow right I I want to be sweet
[1:43:22] cuz I tell you what I can't stand myself
[1:43:24] when I'm
[1:43:26] not oh brother Samuel you mean there's
[1:43:29] yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:43:32] I tender you know what tender means
[1:43:37] flexible
[1:43:39] able to bend to move with the presence
[1:43:43] of
[1:43:44] God not my way or the
[1:43:49] highway tender
[1:43:51] that's right
[1:43:53] flexible
[1:43:56] sweet like water brings grass and soft
[1:44:00] buds that's these trees would be Cactus
[1:44:04] them leaves would just wind up and make
[1:44:07] stickery that's the way it is when you
[1:44:09] get dry around the church everybody is
[1:44:14] sticking one another you're sticking me
[1:44:18] I'm sticking you stick
[1:44:22] post post
[1:44:26] post you see you got to half look at
[1:44:29] this listen listen now let me I'm
[1:44:31] closing I know you said said it but I
[1:44:35] want let this is very important you've
[1:44:37] got to have what kind of waters soft
[1:44:41] soft
[1:44:42] Waters I love good torrential torrential
[1:44:46] downpours I love that I I I believe
[1:44:48] there should be torrential Dr down
[1:44:50] downpours at times in the house of God I
[1:44:53] believe that according to how however
[1:44:54] God sees fit but I'll tell you this
[1:44:56] right here torrential drown downpours
[1:44:58] will run
[1:45:00] off are you hearing me it'll run off but
[1:45:03] you take a nice soft rain it'll soak
[1:45:05] into that
[1:45:08] ground when it gets down into the
[1:45:10] summertime and it rains man I look
[1:45:12] outside I said Lord please let it be
[1:45:14] soft let it be
[1:45:16] soft why cuz I like how my draas look
[1:45:21] when they get watered and that means I
[1:45:23] don't got to water them that means my
[1:45:25] grass gets
[1:45:29] watered soft water so you see it's the
[1:45:32] soft water I'm let's
[1:45:36] stand it's the soft Waters of
[1:45:39] rain that soften you up listen now don't
[1:45:43] don't tune me out it softens you up this
[1:45:45] is what soft water does it softens us up
[1:45:49] you realize there's times the reason
[1:45:50] that there's times where there's things
[1:45:52] no doubt that we can miss things is
[1:45:56] because we don't allow the spirit of God
[1:45:59] to soften us up and you know what
[1:46:01] happens is it becomes
[1:46:03] runoff and then after it becomes runoff
[1:46:06] are you listening watch how the enemy
[1:46:08] he'll turn around and he's got a quote
[1:46:09] for you and the enemy will say now you
[1:46:12] know what that is there is a quote in
[1:46:14] spiritual food in spoken words Original
[1:46:17] Seed and it says that if this water just
[1:46:20] runs off your back like a duck you're
[1:46:23] not a seed that can absorb it he's
[1:46:25] quoting a quote but he's misapplying
[1:46:29] it yeah that's good and if you allow him
[1:46:32] he's trying to take that quote and
[1:46:35] distract you how do I know because when
[1:46:38] God takes a hold of his word he don't
[1:46:40] condemn you he'll convict you Hallelujah
[1:46:44] condemnation puts you in a jail and you
[1:46:47] can't get out but conviction will say
[1:46:49] hey this is where we're missing the mark
[1:46:50] but come on let's go let's go that's
[1:46:52] what conviction it'll lead you in
[1:46:54] Repentance it'll get you on the right
[1:46:55] way that's what real conviction does
[1:46:58] that's what the word of God comes to do
[1:46:59] it comes to bring healing in our lives
[1:47:02] and soft rain soft rain you know
[1:47:06] sometimes when it's soft you just man
[1:47:07] it's so pleasant to hear that soft
[1:47:09] rain and absorbs into our
[1:47:12] life sometimes we we just want come on
[1:47:15] brother Samuel drop it down come on Lord
[1:47:18] I Lord I've only got so much time drop
[1:47:20] down the Toral and it
[1:47:23] just feels good but afterwards where are
[1:47:27] we right remember the rain is the holy
[1:47:30] spirit
[1:47:32] right I I don't want to put the rain
[1:47:36] schedule on my
[1:47:38] schedule the Bible said his eyes are
[1:47:42] upon this land and care for it God knows
[1:47:46] what has to be brought out of our life
[1:47:48] in this season he knows just the right
[1:47:51] amount of rain for this season that
[1:47:53] we're in what Feast we're in he knows
[1:47:55] just the right amount of
[1:47:58] rain and we want to say Lord let my life
[1:48:02] be an absorption amen if I've got things
[1:48:05] Lord in me and my mind and I'm sitting
[1:48:07] here and just be honest with him don't
[1:48:10] don't don't be under condemnation be
[1:48:11] honest with him this is a moment to be
[1:48:13] honest with him and allow the soft rain
[1:48:15] just to come down and say Lord I got a
[1:48:17] little distracted my mind's got off on a
[1:48:19] little things I got over here but Lord I
[1:48:22] want to just you know I just want to
[1:48:24] take in this soft rain just soften me
[1:48:27] Lord soften my will to your
[1:48:31] will soften my will to your
[1:48:34] will let's
[1:48:36] pray
[1:48:39] father thank you for your mercies this
[1:48:41] morning
[1:48:43] Lord Lord we need your grace in this
[1:48:47] hour we need your leadership and I
[1:48:50] believe believe that Lord you have given
[1:48:52] us Lord of your spirit you've given us
[1:48:55] lord of the
[1:48:57] leadership that we have need
[1:48:59] [Music]
[1:49:01] of Lord
[1:49:03] through all of it here this morning
[1:49:05] everything Lord as you've spoke to our
[1:49:09] hearts May there be a
[1:49:12] resolve that God has
[1:49:14] moved not by just not by just sitting
[1:49:18] here in this building but a resolve
[1:49:20] would move into hearts and
[1:49:23] lives to say Lord I want to change
[1:49:28] priorities I want your priorities the
[1:49:30] priority of this
[1:49:33] word that's what I want my life that's
[1:49:35] what I want my whole life to govern
[1:49:39] around is the priority of entertaining
[1:49:42] Jesus
[1:49:43] Christ first place in my
[1:49:47] worship because my worship is not just
[1:49:49] when I rais my hands not just when I'm
[1:49:51] singing a certain song but my worship is
[1:49:54] my daily
[1:49:56] living Lord as your Prophet told us we
[1:49:59] can worship you by just going up to the
[1:50:00] person at the store and saying isn't it
[1:50:02] a beautiful day the Lord has given us
[1:50:04] that's
[1:50:06] worship father in all things may we put
[1:50:10] you first as James would
[1:50:14] write to us under inspiration and say of
[1:50:18] all the plans that you have
[1:50:21] but allow room for divine
[1:50:25] Interruption if it be the Lord's
[1:50:29] will oh God help us in this hour we
[1:50:31] we're living in a moment we're living in
[1:50:33] an hour where Lord we have to be mindful
[1:50:35] of every step that we're making not walk
[1:50:37] fearfully but walking with our eyes on
[1:50:40] you and when there's decisions that we
[1:50:43] have to make
[1:50:44] Lord we want to be under your
[1:50:48] influence Lord any life or any heart you
[1:50:51] know where each of us are at I'm asking
[1:50:55] this morning
[1:50:57] Lord as your grace Lord has spoke to our
[1:51:00] hearts to lead us out of places that
[1:51:03] Lord that maybe as we read in that quote
[1:51:06] where that family started out you healed
[1:51:08] that family and then all of a sudden
[1:51:10] Lord they other things other influences
[1:51:13] moved in I pray here this morning God as
[1:51:15] your influence or your presence Lord has
[1:51:18] moved down May there be Wills made
[1:51:20] hearts to
[1:51:22] recognize I'm not being influenced by
[1:51:24] the right
[1:51:25] Source I'm not chasing after the right
[1:51:28] thing I'm not putting the right
[1:51:29] priorities I'm putting so many other
[1:51:31] things and and and and when I have time
[1:51:33] for God or when whenever Time Lord but
[1:51:35] Lord we don't want to be as the prophet
[1:51:38] told us in that message too busy too
[1:51:42] busy to pray too busy to go to the house
[1:51:44] of God too busy cuz we in that Lord
[1:51:48] where we are too busy
[1:51:51] but help us help us to redeem the time
[1:51:55] Lord in every area of our life Lord from
[1:51:57] the school from a school child Lord to
[1:52:00] the college to Lord those in the job to
[1:52:03] every one of us Lord in family life all
[1:52:05] those things we want your leadership
[1:52:09] Lord help us father I
[1:52:13] pray Lord May there be hearts and lives
[1:52:17] this morning that if they've never come
[1:52:19] to a place of surrender never come to
[1:52:22] that place of repentance with you to
[1:52:25] where they've really repented of their
[1:52:27] wrong and walking into the Waters of
[1:52:30] baptism Lord never received yet Lord the
[1:52:34] spirit of God may that be the number one
[1:52:37] priority of their life may they let
[1:52:40] loose of everything
[1:52:42] else and say
[1:52:45] God I want you to be the priority
[1:52:48] because every everything else in my life
[1:52:52] you know how to order
[1:52:54] it I want you to be the Lord of all
[1:52:57] maybe he's come into your life and youve
[1:52:59] he's standing on a welcome mat but he
[1:53:00] wants to go through every door of your
[1:53:02] life maybe it's the door of
[1:53:04] Pride that's the first door that he
[1:53:06] comes into he works on that door of
[1:53:08] Pride and I'm afraid what so and so will
[1:53:10] say I don't want to do this or I don't
[1:53:12] want to give up this style I just just
[1:53:14] let him come in if you just say Lord
[1:53:15] come into this room give me the strength
[1:53:17] that I need Lord and take Lord
[1:53:20] everything out of this room any anything
[1:53:23] thatall is influencing me in the wrong
[1:53:25] way let him go through every door every

[2:25:44] Eternal oh to God's a changing
[2:25:51] hand oh
[2:25:54] build your hopes on things
[2:26:01] Eternal
