[28:55] truly in our lives it's been the glory
[29:00] of God it's been God moving it's been
[29:03] God working in our lives to him we give
[29:08] glory amen there's nothing that we can
[29:11] glory in you know even any any movement
[29:16] that's been made in obedience
[29:17] we can't take credit for it it's God's
[29:21] grace God's grace that he would have our
[29:24] heart in a condition to be able to catch
[29:27] where he's leading us so it all comes
[29:29] down to his glory and I'm so grateful it
[29:32] just brings us to more of a realization
[29:34] our dependency on him and we see our
[29:38] littles
[29:38] but all how we can see his greatness how
[29:42] we love him don't we love him God is so
[29:45] good friends it's so good amen we want
[29:49] to go right into the word tonight
[29:51] just if you'll turn with us to
[29:53] Deuteronomy nine will keep you standing
[29:56] very long
[30:06] Lord willing tried to finish this
[30:08] thought here this evening
[30:15] Lord willing brother John LaFontaine
[30:17] will be here with us on Sunday so you
[30:20] would just just keep him in prayer and
[30:23] also keep me in prayer I just got a call
[30:27] yesterday and just asked to be to fill
[30:31] in for one of the Brethren at the youth
[30:33] retreat that is not going to be able to
[30:35] make it and so if you would just be in
[30:38] prayer God knows and Lord willing I'll
[30:43] be doing the morning sessions and just
[30:45] teaching and so I was just just numbing
[30:49] for myself but the whole camp if you
[30:51] just just keep us in prayer that God
[30:53] will just move in a very very special
[30:55] way he already knows every need you
[30:59] believe that he knows every need and he
[31:01] knows just how to minister to the needs
[31:02] of his children and and we just pray
[31:05] that God will just pour out of his
[31:06] spirit and bring life to hearts that are
[31:09] in need of life bring encouragement to
[31:11] those that's discouraging that he
[31:13] himself who is the answer that he'll
[31:15] just make himself known amen let's just
[31:19] read here in Deuteronomy 9 verse 23
[31:23] likewise when the Lord sent you from
[31:25] Kadesh Barnea saying go up and possess
[31:27] the land which I have given you
[31:29] then you rebelled against the
[31:31] commandment of the Lord your God and you
[31:33] believed him not nor hearken to his
[31:35] voice you have been rebellious against
[31:38] the Lord from the day that I knew you
[31:40] thus I fell down before the Lord forty
[31:43] days and forty nights as I fell down at
[31:46] the first that is a paradox right there
[31:50] did you catch that I fell down as at the
[31:54] first the first time that my heart was
[31:57] moved to intercede it hasn't wavered
[32:00] even up to this time now there's been a
[32:03] lot of things that took place up till
[32:05] this time right here there's just a huge
[32:07] leap that has taken place but Moses is
[32:09] letting it be known as I fell down at
[32:12] the first because the Lord had said he
[32:16] would destroy you I prayed that word
[32:19] means to intervene mediate go in on
[32:22] one's behalf I prayed therefore unto the
[32:25] Lord and said O Lord God
[32:28] destroy not thy people and thine
[32:30] inheritance which thou has redeemed
[32:32] through thy greatness which thou hast
[32:35] brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty
[32:37] hand remember thy servants Abraham Isaac
[32:41] and Jacob look not unto the stubbornness
[32:44] of this people nor to their wickedness
[32:47] nor to their sin aren't you glad that
[32:50] there's there's something present that's
[32:53] able to turn his attention how many's
[32:57] glad for the token of the Holy Ghost in
[32:59] your life
[32:59] how many's glad for the blood that's
[33:01] Abel that that captures his attention
[33:04] and he says I see the desire of your
[33:07] heart Oh aren't you glad for that lest
[33:13] the land wench twin style broadest us
[33:16] I'll say because the Lord was not able
[33:19] to bring them into the land which he
[33:21] promised them because he hated them he
[33:24] hath brought them out to slay them in
[33:26] the wilderness yet they are thy people
[33:29] and thine inheritance which thou
[33:32] broughtest out by thy mighty power and
[33:35] by the eyes stretched out on may God
[33:38] bless his word bless you as you're being
[33:41] seated so good to be together this
[33:45] evening
[33:47] last week we you were examining once
[33:50] again on the intercessory prayer and you
[33:56] see the very heart of Christ here as we
[34:00] Moses is relying this to the generation
[34:05] that is preparing to cross over God's
[34:09] been building their faith there has been
[34:12] testimonies that are being developed and
[34:14] I guess God is building their faith God
[34:17] is also putting the dread of them upon
[34:20] the other in the inhabitants there of
[34:22] the land but Moses is letting him know
[34:24] that he doesn't he's not boasting in
[34:27] himself but he's letting him know if it
[34:29] wasn't for the mercy of God you wouldn't
[34:32] even be here but you see Moses himself
[34:35] knew the mercy of God he knew it by
[34:38] personal experience because he himself
[34:40] one
[34:41] had went away and he had lost the vision
[34:44] so Moses himself you know by an
[34:47] experience you know he knowing the grace
[34:50] of God and the depth of God's redemptive
[34:52] grace as far as what could be known in
[34:54] that time he was able to stand there on
[34:57] behalf of the people and I think as we
[34:59] have so rightfully looked at this here
[35:02] at different intervals of time that we
[35:05] know that it takes more than just our
[35:09] our ability to be able to intercede on
[35:13] behalf of one it really takes the Spirit
[35:17] of God on the inside when I I look at
[35:19] those scriptures where when Paul would
[35:22] admonish the believers and Ephesians and
[35:24] Colossians and the other places and he
[35:26] would say to forgive even as Christ has
[35:29] God as has given you forgiving you for
[35:31] Christ's sake the even as that's that's
[35:33] a tall task and when Paul would go on to
[35:36] say in Colossians 3 I believe it is put
[35:38] on therefore as the elect of God holy
[35:40] bowels of Mercy and he goes on to speak
[35:43] of having a core among you forgiving
[35:45] even as Christ has has forgiven you that
[35:49] that's something that takes some that
[35:52] takes something greater than our ability
[35:55] and I believe that's where Paul could
[35:57] say put on therefore as the elect of God
[35:59] it's a sinking that word means to sink
[36:01] into an adornment that is present and I
[36:04] believe that that is present in our life
[36:07] if we have been born of the Spirit of
[36:09] God we have access to that garment of
[36:12] forgiveness to that of the mercies of
[36:15] God but it requires us to just surrender
[36:18] and just to sink into that and that's
[36:21] something that is greater than our
[36:23] abilities it's greater than our words it
[36:26] actually takes a sovereign work of
[36:28] Almighty God you realize - even for your
[36:31] sins and my sins to have been forgiven
[36:33] it has taken a sovereign work of God's
[36:36] grace and that's the same thing it takes
[36:39] within the lives of each and every one
[36:42] of us it takes a sovereign work of God
[36:44] and this is a sovereign work of God that
[36:47] it's taking place in Moses heart
[36:50] according to the promise of God and to
[36:53] see this tonight I want to
[36:55] drop it like this that the love rhythm
[36:58] says God seen the love that Moses had
[37:01] for these people it was the love of God
[37:04] that it was so rightly placed I want you
[37:07] to so hold on to that now
[37:08] it was so rightly placed in Moses life
[37:12] so that it was not just a word that
[37:16] Moses knew but it this was the very God
[37:20] the very life of the promised Christ
[37:22] himself he who was veiled
[37:24] in the fire in the bush that same life
[37:28] that same God who spoke the promise that
[37:31] same life and heart of the promise was
[37:34] pulsating through Moses life
[37:36] Moses was yoked and United with that
[37:40] promise and to see that we you know when
[37:42] we look at that that realizing that when
[37:46] Moses interceded he was interceding
[37:48] according to the plan and will of God
[37:50] that had been spiritually revealed to
[37:53] him and Denis he he would pray and he
[37:55] would intercede remember there was a
[37:58] mixed multitude that came up out of
[38:00] Egypt Moses was an ignorant of that that
[38:02] there were people who were just present
[38:05] who were just there who were just
[38:07] traveling along and yet in the midst of
[38:10] it you see down through each part of the
[38:12] journey that you'll see that different
[38:14] things will come out and the Bible says
[38:17] they complained against God they
[38:18] complained against Moses and then we
[38:20] took a little bit last week and we
[38:22] looked at that in numbers 21 where that
[38:24] here they spoke against Moses spoke
[38:26] against God God sent fiery serpents down
[38:29] and it's it bit them and there were
[38:31] those who died but then there were those
[38:33] who rose up and said Moses we have
[38:37] sinned against the Lord and it's
[38:39] speaking also against you pray to the
[38:42] Lord for us and the Bible says Moses
[38:44] prayed or he intervened interceded on
[38:47] their behalf you see it's always
[38:49] something when you look at it that here
[38:51] when two people come to the realization
[38:54] that they were wrong there was mercy for
[38:58] them if they were willing to ask for
[39:00] that mercy I don't know about you
[39:03] tonight but I want to be humble enough
[39:04] to realize that I need God's mercy every
[39:08] day of my life
[39:09] and to recognize that there are things
[39:11] that as brother Brennan would place
[39:13] alike this that we stagger into
[39:15] ignorantly there's things where we make
[39:17] mistakes not willfully there are things
[39:20] that we need God's grace and at that
[39:22] time thank God that there's conviction
[39:25] that strikes our heart when things are
[39:27] wrong and we can rise up and we can look
[39:30] to the Lord and say Lord I'm asking for
[39:32] your mercy Lord please forgive me you
[39:34] realize what a high price that is to be
[39:36] able to look to God and to be able to
[39:40] ask God for forgiveness
[39:41] you know why you ask God for forgiveness
[39:43] is because a life is pulsating within
[39:46] you that desires to be pleasing to the
[39:49] Lord and anything that is Grievous or
[39:52] somewhat of an offense any way that you
[39:54] think this I maybe I've said this wrong
[39:56] where I've looked at this wrong and this
[39:58] could be displeasing to him because
[40:00] within our hearts our desire is to
[40:03] police him in all points and it all
[40:06] matters and you know brother Graham
[40:07] called that about our life he said
[40:09] that's attention that belongs to the
[40:11] believer he said you know being a
[40:13] Christian he said you don't really
[40:15] relieve tension but rather you add
[40:17] tension to your life and he likens it to
[40:20] that of an automobile going down the
[40:21] road and he talks about the belt you
[40:24] know that would be around the different
[40:26] pulleys on the engine if that belt
[40:28] breaks on your car you're not going to
[40:30] go anywhere I don't care how much power
[40:32] that you got in that car but brother mem
[40:34] says that belt it's lack of attention
[40:36] upon a believer he said in the tension
[40:39] to a believer he said it's not a bad
[40:41] thing it's actually a blessing and he
[40:44] said because what it is it brings us to
[40:47] this place
[40:47] Lord am i pleasing to you and he said we
[40:50] find ourselves asking that question
[40:52] daily you know why because it matters to
[40:55] you it matters that you're policing to
[40:58] him yet you just don't want to take
[40:59] things for granted we want to walk
[41:02] pleasing to him because we realize every
[41:04] moment in this life we've got to make
[41:06] every moment count and we need his help
[41:09] there's a goal that we're after we're
[41:11] not just people gathered here tonight
[41:13] that are just coming around a church and
[41:15] and become part of a some sort of a
[41:18] system or a society but we are a part of
[41:21] the body of Jesus
[41:22] Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[41:24] we've got a promise that's burning
[41:27] within our heart a promise of
[41:29] deliverance and that song we suddenly
[41:31] see the signs of the time that are all
[41:33] around us it's something within us
[41:35] that's a groaning that's a desiring for
[41:38] a relief from this walk from this life
[41:41] that we're in yet were filled with joy
[41:43] of the Lord in our soul but yet there's
[41:45] a desire and a longing to be with him
[41:48] and he knows that that's why he came
[41:51] back and he deposited his life within
[41:54] you and I so that we might be where he
[41:57] is and I think of this of how that when
[42:00] Moses would pray you know it took prayer
[42:04] itself prayer is not just something that
[42:07] you would do or we would do based upon
[42:11] just what we see but prayer itself when
[42:14] we look at intercessory prayer it is
[42:16] that where there is eyes or site that
[42:19] looks beyond the present circumstances
[42:21] and it looks to God who made the promise
[42:24] and knowing that the present
[42:27] circumstances that it's all in God's
[42:29] hands that God is more than able to turn
[42:32] those circumstances around and you're
[42:35] able to intercede on the behalf of
[42:37] others needs I'm talking about things
[42:39] that you and I we would like to try to
[42:41] engineer with our hands sometimes we may
[42:44] feel we can change this or change that
[42:46] but there's only one thing that can
[42:48] really change things and that's gone
[42:50] he's the one that changed our life and
[42:52] you and I can look at that and we'd
[42:54] realize prayer just like in this
[42:56] situation it changes things so when I
[43:01] think of it here in terms of looking at
[43:03] Israel coming out of Egypt they're
[43:06] delivered by the mighty hand of God and
[43:08] how that many of them were kept there
[43:10] were many that died along the way but
[43:13] there was a seed there was a group of
[43:15] people in whom God knew and when he made
[43:18] the promise he made it with them in mind
[43:21] and look within it you find that how the
[43:24] Lord Jesus here in John 17 when he makes
[43:27] a great prayer of intercession here here
[43:30] is the very perfect sacrifice himself
[43:33] and he speaks in John 17 sick
[43:35] he said I manifested thy name unto the
[43:38] men which thou gave us me out of the
[43:40] world dying they were and thou gave us
[43:43] them me and they have kept that word
[43:45] they have known that all things
[43:47] whatsoever thou has given me are thee
[43:49] for I have given unto them the words
[43:51] which thou gave us me and they have
[43:54] received them and have known surely that
[43:56] I came out from thee and they have
[43:58] believed that thou did it send me look
[44:00] at this in verse nine I pray for them I
[44:03] pray not for the world but for them
[44:07] which thou has given me for they are
[44:10] thine you recognize that the redemptive
[44:15] work of Calvary was for the elect in
[44:20] mind bill man lays this very clear with
[44:24] predestination he said predestination is
[44:27] not God simply choosing and picking out
[44:30] now but it's what he already elected and
[44:33] chosen from the foundation of the world
[44:36] and that choosing was not like picking
[44:38] kickball teams on the playground you
[44:41] were chosen because you were in him you
[44:45] were always a part of him you're a part
[44:48] of that word which is him he knew what
[44:51] bit of time where you would live when
[44:53] you would be born he knew all of those
[44:55] things and to think that the redemptive
[44:58] work of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[45:00] redemption as the Prophet tells us and
[45:02] who is this Melchizedek Redemption he
[45:04] said is with the elected in mind because
[45:07] it is the son of man who came to seek
[45:10] and save that which was lost and you
[45:12] know how Jesus lays it out in the
[45:14] parables in Matthew 13 then he breaks
[45:16] over I believe in Luke chapter 11 and he
[45:19] talks about the parable of the prodigal
[45:20] son he was always a son he was always an
[45:24] eagle he was always the Sheep but
[45:26] remember he made a choice and went
[45:28] astray lacked what happened back in the
[45:30] garden but more but upon this moment
[45:33] mother mam tells us that there was a
[45:34] mama and a daddy that was praying for
[45:37] him and they knew he had went wayward
[45:39] and brother brems so glory brother Babel
[45:41] said well that mom and Daddy were
[45:43] gathered
[45:43] in that living room praying for that boy
[45:45] he said the angel of the Lord began to
[45:47] move as that prayer was being offered up
[45:50] he said the angel the Lord went to that
[45:52] Pigpen right where that boy was that I
[45:55] believe that was on my heart I'm a
[45:56] living witness of that the angel of the
[45:59] Lord went down there and begin to deal
[46:01] with that boy's heart and begin to close
[46:03] him to think about his father's house it
[46:06] began to cause him you see where he was
[46:07] drawn before his physical body ever left
[46:11] the Pigpen all my I know sometimes it
[46:13] looks discouraging because you can still
[46:15] see him in the Pigpen but remember
[46:17] there's got to be something move and
[46:19] turn their heart while they're in the
[46:21] Pigpen and it's gonna be that ritual
[46:23] turn and eventually you see him leave
[46:26] the Pigpen it's God the angel of the
[46:28] Lord he's moving on that prayer why
[46:30] because that prayer is in intercession
[46:33] according to the promise that day and
[46:36] their offspring shall be there with them
[46:37] believe believe in the Lord Jesus Christ
[46:40] and die in the house shall be saved
[46:43] those are promises that you're able to
[46:45] take their before the throne of God and
[46:47] the age of the Lord is there to make
[46:50] good upon those promises that's what God
[46:53] said that's his promise to us and to
[46:56] think of how that the Lord Jesus would
[46:58] lay this out with Redemption plan that
[47:01] it's all about bringing back to himself
[47:04] those whom were lost in the beginning
[47:07] now when you look at this this is the
[47:10] elect of where that Jesus would go on to
[47:13] say here in the scriptures all mine are
[47:16] thine and dine on mine and I am
[47:18] glorified in them
[47:20] you see Jesus is not glorified in just
[47:24] the righteous ones but glorified is
[47:28] where the full honor the full dignity
[47:31] the full reality of who he is is made
[47:34] known in that of the elect believer in
[47:38] this hour you understand me
[47:40] it brings I would suggest this it brings
[47:43] you and I to such a responsibility
[47:45] because you don't know who are your life
[47:48] who it's touching and who it's effective
[47:50] there's many people that will not read
[47:53] the Bible or haven't read the Bible but
[47:56] read your life and they know there's
[47:57] something different about it what is
[47:59] that that is the very glorification of
[48:02] the Lord Jesus Christ the supreme
[48:04] sacrifice that has ascended to the
[48:07] mediatorial seed and sit back down the
[48:09] Holy Ghost to bring in reality through
[48:12] your life there has come Redemption
[48:15] there is deliverance there is victory
[48:17] there is a complete victorious life in
[48:21] Jesus Christ what is that it's a Holy
[48:24] Ghost in your life that has given you
[48:26] power and dominion over sin to where
[48:29] you're able to bring your body and
[48:31] subjection and your life is a billboard
[48:34] of God's amazing grace
[48:36] so he's glorified in them now verse 11
[48:40] said I'm no more in the world but these
[48:42] are in the world and I come to the Holy
[48:44] Father keep through thine old name whom
[48:47] those whom thou hast given me that they
[48:49] may be one as we are one so here's
[48:52] intercessory prayer the prayer of
[48:54] intercession is that the people be
[48:56] united that every elect child of God be
[48:59] united I hope you're with me tonight we
[49:02] recognize that the elect of God let me
[49:04] say like this being elect of God you
[49:06] never can you never could and you
[49:08] weren't on your way to hell you might
[49:10] have been going down that pathway but
[49:12] remember really for every human being
[49:14] the Bible says that hell was not created
[49:17] for human beings it was created for the
[49:19] devil and his angels is that right
[49:22] but to see this right here that even in
[49:25] the midst of it the elect of God the
[49:28] Lord Jesus look at the attitude that he
[49:30] took he never just took it as it was
[49:32] something for granted but he prayed for
[49:35] those thou hast given me that they may
[49:38] be one even as we are one his desire was
[49:42] for fellowship this was the request that
[49:45] he made think of it this is the request
[49:48] that he made before he ever made the
[49:50] request at the end of Matthew and in
[49:53] through John about let this cup pass
[49:54] from me he asks for our fellowship
[49:58] because he wanted to be one with us I
[50:00] tell you Moses just did not have a
[50:03] burden to bring the people out in the
[50:04] wilderness but remember the burden in
[50:06] his heart whereas he
[50:08] Moses I think in Exodus 15 when the
[50:10] spirit of prophecy began to move on his
[50:13] life and victory had come up the Bible
[50:15] says that Moses spoke to the Lord and as
[50:18] he was singing out he said Lord until
[50:20] that people be passed over until that
[50:23] people be passed over Oh Lord thou has
[50:25] brought them out and thou shall plant
[50:27] them in the land you recognized the
[50:29] spirit of prophecy knows no defeat
[50:32] that's why in the Church of the Living
[50:35] God that he reveals himself in a
[50:37] Sevenfold manner there in revelations 1
[50:40] that they had the testimony of Jesus
[50:43] Christ what is the testimony of Jesus
[50:45] Christ it's the very name of the Lord
[50:47] Jesus Christ revealed in by the presence
[50:50] of his word the Holy Spirit taking his
[50:53] word and revealing that divine nature
[50:55] and you and I are called by that same
[50:58] name glory be to God the testimony of
[51:01] the Lord Jesus Christ notice while I was
[51:04] in the world I kept them in thy name
[51:06] those that thou gave us me I have kept
[51:09] and none of them is lost but the son of
[51:11] perdition that the scripture might be
[51:13] fulfilled and now I come to thee that
[51:16] these things I speak in the world that
[51:18] they might have joy fulfilled in
[51:21] themselves so to see how that when the
[51:25] Lord Jesus ascended up there from Mount
[51:29] Olives and the disciples turn to go back
[51:33] to Jerusalem as they went back to
[51:35] Jerusalem here he was moving to the me
[51:38] to toil work he's already been presented
[51:41] as the sacrifice already been accepted
[51:44] it's he'd already rose from the grave
[51:46] now here he goes to intercede on behalf
[51:50] of the promise because he went there you
[51:54] and I were in him there when he rose
[51:57] from the grave we got up with him
[51:59] we were represented in him who is the
[52:03] word and he went there to intercede on
[52:07] the media toriel work when John looked
[52:09] there in Revelations for he saw one that
[52:12] sat on the throne in Revelations 5 when
[52:14] John was told to look and see when John
[52:17] began to weep he said John look the Lion
[52:20] of the tribe of Judah
[52:21] he had prevailed to take the book and
[52:24] loosen the seals they're out recognizing
[52:26] that that is for this hour
[52:28] the time that you and I were living in
[52:30] that when intercession itself is just
[52:32] about closing out when the rapture
[52:34] itself has come that intercession time
[52:37] is over because when he leaves the
[52:39] intercessory box the same seat that is a
[52:42] seat of Mercy will become a judgement
[52:45] seat when the blood is no longer there
[52:47] and that's why at the very heart it
[52:49] pulsates the within our lives even as we
[52:52] look concerning our loved ones and
[52:54] concerning really anybody you look up on
[52:57] lives you look on hearts that you come
[52:58] in contact with on your job or at your
[53:01] restaurants or different places there's
[53:03] something about it that burns in your
[53:05] heart that you see people in situations
[53:07] and you look and you say there is some
[53:10] there is an answer here that is able to
[53:13] minister to their life because it's
[53:15] something about your life in my life
[53:17] it's filled with life that's beyond this
[53:20] life and you know there's an answer that
[53:22] burns in your heart no matter the
[53:24] travesty and everything that has taken
[53:26] place there is indeed a healing in the
[53:30] Lord Jesus Christ until you in this hour
[53:32] there's more hurt people than you can
[53:33] shake a stick at
[53:34] but I'm glad they're still balm in
[53:36] Gilead I'm so glad about that he's
[53:39] seated on the mercy seat until the last
[53:42] one comes in now I realize that
[53:44] sometimes that this has been a point of
[53:46] contention of which that you know
[53:48] Baptists don't have to preach on it
[53:49] Pentecostals don't have to preach on it
[53:51] nobody has to preach on these things
[53:53] except around the message and that is
[53:55] where you have some that have looked and
[53:56] said well you know when he took the book
[53:58] you know he left the mediatorial see the
[54:01] mercies over with but what it is it's
[54:03] failing to place things correctly in the
[54:05] word God will always reveal what he is
[54:08] ready to do before he does it is that
[54:12] right he reveals that we're living in
[54:15] the time just like when brother John the
[54:17] Baptist could say that the kingdom of
[54:19] heaven is at hand though right it's
[54:23] still at hand tonight you and I look
[54:26] back and say 2,000 years but 2,000 years
[54:29] has been like this it's been a work
[54:32] that's been taking place down through
[54:33] time so God himself
[54:35] making an announcement in this hour and
[54:38] the releasing of the seals of the book
[54:40] to where that God Himself would actually
[54:43] begin to Thunder out his voice and turn
[54:45] our hearts back to the original Bible
[54:48] faith that was once delivered unto the
[54:51] Saints of the Living God it would be
[54:53] that same apostolic faith that was lost
[54:56] back there from the beginning when it
[54:58] started in the church ages but here in
[55:00] this last name this small increment of
[55:03] time God by His grace would move for you
[55:06] and I and revealed to us the things that
[55:09] we have need of not as knowledge but as
[55:11] that which would sow stimulate and
[55:13] correlate with that part that was sown
[55:16] within us faith rises up to recognize
[55:19] that we were always a part of him I tell
[55:23] you what it does brother Branham Labor's
[55:24] on the point it tells us why that he's
[55:27] laboring within predestination why he's
[55:29] laboring an election he said it's to
[55:31] drive the fear out of the church I'm
[55:35] telling you brother and sister our
[55:37] security is not in ourselves our
[55:40] security is in the blood of the Lamb the
[55:43] Bible says in Revelations 12 that we
[55:46] overcome him by the blood of the Lamb
[55:48] and the word of our testimony so it's in
[55:52] him that we are counting on and he
[55:54] prayed the Father for us what some of
[55:57] the RAM says this now the lamb in the
[55:59] time of intercessory back here he knew
[56:01] that there were names in there that was
[56:03] put in there from the foundation of the
[56:05] world and as long as their names have
[56:08] never been manifested on earth as yet he
[56:10] had to stay there as an intercessor
[56:13] there were a lot more names that were
[56:15] manifested on the earth after 1963
[56:19] brother Brandon goes on and you can pick
[56:21] this up we've dealt with this here
[56:23] before brother brems goes on clear into
[56:25] 65 we're waiting on that last sheaf to
[56:27] come in we're waiting on maybe it'll be
[56:29] a black one down in Africa brother BAM
[56:31] tells us over in Washington there in the
[56:33] message he said the Church of the Living
[56:35] God will slug on she'll keep on pressing
[56:38] on until that last name that last one
[56:41] comes in Wow because the promise is sure
[56:46] we know there is a last one
[56:49] we know there's a final as we've said
[56:51] before there's a final day there's a
[56:53] final moment there's a final time we are
[56:55] living in the end time we're not
[57:00] ignorant of this we're not walking as
[57:02] Paul said you're not ignorant brethren
[57:04] in darkness but you're walking in light
[57:07] Levin goes on to say it
[57:09] he said perfectly predestination he had
[57:12] to stay there because he came to die for
[57:15] those that God had ordained to eternal
[57:18] life you catch that he came to die for
[57:21] those whom God had ordained to eternal
[57:24] life by his foreknowledge he saw them
[57:29] not by his own will his will was none
[57:34] should perish you catch that divining
[57:38] there Calvary is for the elect it is a
[57:41] purchase of redemption
[57:43] but as it says in the book of Peter he
[57:46] will he desires that no one would be
[57:49] lost that's his desire and that same
[57:52] life within us desires the same thing
[57:54] there are people that you don't know
[57:56] you're not a witness to by your life
[57:59] maybe little things that you feel like
[58:00] why couldn't I drop all of this why
[58:02] could nine fall all of this maybe God
[58:04] wanted you to fold out the part that
[58:07] needed to be folded to that person and
[58:09] they themselves were not meant for that
[58:12] of election and redemption but they
[58:15] could look to the Lord in salvation
[58:17] because they could look and say lord
[58:19] save me
[58:20] I'm lost and they could have faith that
[58:23] there was a sufficient purchase was made
[58:27] and they can believe God for the
[58:29] forgiveness of their sins but yet never
[58:32] able to see that truth that reality and
[58:36] Christ be glorified in them fully as he
[58:40] is the believer but let me tell you
[58:42] something
[58:43] justification is a part of Christ being
[58:46] glorified in somebody's life
[58:48] sanctification is another fold a second
[58:52] work of grace being glorified in a
[58:54] person's life I don't know about you but
[58:55] I could shout what somebody's been
[58:57] sanctified the whole brother slamming
[58:59] you got to give him what for why do I
[59:01] gotta give him what for
[59:03] well they don't believe like you believe
[59:05] who said they gotta believe like I
[59:07] believe are you with me this is a
[59:10] message friends for the elect but it is
[59:12] not a message that calls you and I to
[59:15] look down at other people it ought to be
[59:17] something on our heart that says welcome
[59:19] welcome welcome but it's not welcome
[59:24] according will they receive exactly how
[59:27] you're bringing in or one or more but it
[59:29] is a life that bids them welcome not
[59:33] welcome of sin but it actually puts
[59:35] before them of what Christ himself has
[59:38] already done now notice this by his
[59:41] foreknowledge he knew who would and who
[59:43] were not there for as long as there was
[59:45] one named hatton never yet been declared
[59:48] in earth price had to stay there as an
[59:51] intercessor to take care of that name
[59:53] aren't you glad but as soon as that
[59:56] final name had been splashed in the
[59:59] Clorox bleach then his intercessory days
[1:00:02] was over let him that's filthy be filthy
[1:00:04] still at him that's holy be holy steel
[1:00:07] and he leaves the sanctuary and it
[1:00:08] becomes a judgement seat
[1:00:10] woe unto those outside of Christ then
[1:00:13] I'm glad that he's there I'm glad that
[1:00:20] he has been there and he is there
[1:00:23] because that's the thrust of the gospel
[1:00:26] remember when Peter preached on the day
[1:00:28] of Pentecost he was preaching of the
[1:00:31] full work the redemptive work and he was
[1:00:34] preaching by the authority that the
[1:00:36] sacrifice had ascended up to the
[1:00:38] mediatorial seed and now the fulfillment
[1:00:41] of joel to the promise of the holy ghost
[1:00:43] of which they were looking for has now
[1:00:45] been poured out upon the believer so he
[1:00:49] was preaching that these are the
[1:00:51] mediatorial days and he said that it is
[1:00:53] unto you and to your children and as
[1:00:56] many as the Lord our God shall call you
[1:00:59] see the minitor work of the Lord Jesus
[1:01:01] Christ is not just by sacrifice and by
[1:01:04] blood but a redemption is also by power
[1:01:07] and redemption comes with a full
[1:01:09] completeness as well and this is what
[1:01:12] the heart of the early church was
[1:01:14] bringing about that there indeed is a
[1:01:16] real complete work there is a power
[1:01:18] that's able to liberate you from sin
[1:01:21] that's able to lift you up because a
[1:01:24] purchase has been made and the life
[1:01:26] within that blood has been released and
[1:01:28] there's a power that's able to open up a
[1:01:31] pathway like God did through the Red Sea
[1:01:33] he's able to bring you through there and
[1:01:35] through the same thing that purges you
[1:01:38] cleanse you set you free is the very
[1:01:41] same blood that destroys the enemy that
[1:01:43] removes his hold upon your life better
[1:01:46] release of that life inside of you says
[1:01:49] I once was bound but now I have been set
[1:01:52] free then it brings a little dance about
[1:01:56] your step because you realize your
[1:01:57] enemies are dead glory so there's been a
[1:02:03] much interceding on our behalf you see
[1:02:06] all the way down through time here
[1:02:09] there's been intercession you realize
[1:02:13] that the Spirit of God Peter would speak
[1:02:15] of this in first Peter chapter one I
[1:02:17] believe of how that the Spirit of Christ
[1:02:19] speaking through the prophets signifying
[1:02:23] what time what manner of time of which
[1:02:25] this salvation should come speaking of
[1:02:27] the very change of the body the
[1:02:30] redemption of the body they did not know
[1:02:32] the time though nor the day nor the hour
[1:02:34] remember down through the ages they've
[1:02:37] lived every moment as though that the
[1:02:39] next moment was his coming up I'm
[1:02:41] talking about the believers they lived
[1:02:43] with that kind of an urgency about their
[1:02:45] life they prayed with him that way as a
[1:02:47] matter of fact they took what Paul said
[1:02:49] comforts you one another with these
[1:02:51] words
[1:02:51] if there was any comfort to be given it
[1:02:54] was comfort that would come by the word
[1:02:56] of the Lord and I believe with all my
[1:02:58] heart that we look at this even how the
[1:03:00] Lord Jesus himself he told us when he
[1:03:03] went away he said I will pray the Father
[1:03:05] for you that he would send you
[1:03:08] uncomforta
[1:03:09] another comforter and he will lead and
[1:03:11] guide you into all truth now think of
[1:03:14] this intercessory work and you know you
[1:03:16] realize that things within the
[1:03:18] scriptures brother and sister there
[1:03:20] disconnected it's not all of a sudden
[1:03:22] that you and I or anybody else yes
[1:03:24] things are just dropping out of the sky
[1:03:26] and we alone I did this and I didn't
[1:03:29] even realize it but you realize God
[1:03:30] brings things our way even with what he
[1:03:33] is ministering here tonight and other
[1:03:35] times and things you read in the
[1:03:36] scripture and things that you're
[1:03:38] listening in the message these are not
[1:03:39] things to where you're just building
[1:03:41] knowledge but remember it's the Spirit
[1:03:43] of God that is speaking to you and I and
[1:03:45] the word is always meant to be applied
[1:03:47] and the Spirit of God will always help
[1:03:49] you and I to know when to apply that
[1:03:51] word I think of where when you look at
[1:03:54] Abraham's life brother Dan tells us was
[1:03:56] gardening Abraham's life I believe it's
[1:03:58] in by faith faith is the victory and he
[1:04:01] says tells us of how then Abraham one
[1:04:04] day he heard about Noah and Abraham he
[1:04:06] said went out in the field and begin to
[1:04:09] pray he said God he said I know that you
[1:04:12] and he said that you're a living God and
[1:04:14] I want to meet that same God that moved
[1:04:17] for know I heard what what you did and
[1:04:19] he said when he got out there in the
[1:04:20] field and started praying that way he
[1:04:22] said that day God came down and spoke to
[1:04:25] him you see there's got to be a life
[1:04:27] that crosses another life's path that'll
[1:04:30] cause them to think there's something
[1:04:32] more beyond this they may not be able to
[1:04:35] put in words where you're at but they
[1:04:37] know about your life Jesus is present in
[1:04:40] your life they know that's a living God
[1:04:42] they know that there's something real
[1:04:44] that's there you see it gives them a
[1:04:46] point of reference that they're able to
[1:04:48] refer to and say I want to know that
[1:04:51] same God that so-and-so knows I they
[1:04:53] testified to me on this I've seen their
[1:04:55] life I want to know that same God they
[1:04:58] don't know right now tonight they might
[1:05:00] be in a worse situation it might be a
[1:05:02] very bad situation that they're in but
[1:05:05] there can come a memory within their
[1:05:07] heart that would rise up and they should
[1:05:09] say lord I remember so-and-so that I
[1:05:12] work with the Lord they testified you're
[1:05:14] a living God the Lord will you intervene
[1:05:17] on this position right now I'm telling
[1:05:19] you he's a living God and your life just
[1:05:22] as much as you got Bible markers in your
[1:05:25] Bible as much as you highlight it and
[1:05:27] you've got ribbon sticking out let me
[1:05:29] tell you something you are the ribbons
[1:05:31] of the words that contained in here when
[1:05:33] that life is reflected through your life
[1:05:36] it's a point of reference of the Living
[1:05:38] Word and here was Abraham he already
[1:05:44] knew when they got thinking him back to
[1:05:47] eighth Noah's life and I believe that
[1:05:49] Moses could look back to Abraham's life
[1:05:51] you see Abraham was one that even when
[1:05:56] God had revealed to Noah regarding
[1:05:58] impending judgment Noah built and
[1:06:01] preached to the whole generation matter
[1:06:05] of fact Noah preached like everybody was
[1:06:07] going to be saved here you know he
[1:06:10] rebuked sin he preached it as though
[1:06:12] everybody but you see God had already
[1:06:15] told him it's for him and his family oh
[1:06:18] Lord I want you to catch something right
[1:06:22] here
[1:06:22] you see if it was truly that Noah
[1:06:25] himself was just preaching out of form
[1:06:28] then there would have been nothing that
[1:06:30] would have been able to help the people
[1:06:32] in but you see I believe that Noah had a
[1:06:35] spiritual insight like you and I can
[1:06:37] look into tonight and realize it's not a
[1:06:40] man's family but the family is the
[1:06:42] family of God and when that word has
[1:06:45] been delivered through a profit that
[1:06:46] profit is not bringing forth natural
[1:06:49] sons and daughters because it's not his
[1:06:52] seed line he's there as a minister of
[1:06:55] the throne from the right hand of God
[1:06:57] and he's ministering that seed life of
[1:07:00] God and is there's going to be children
[1:07:02] of God that are brought forth in that
[1:07:04] hour what by the same spoken word that
[1:07:07] same holy spirit it brings forth life so
[1:07:10] who is the family the family is the
[1:07:13] family of God you see and I'm saying
[1:07:17] you're a greater privilege tonight to be
[1:07:19] a son and daughter of God so you could
[1:07:22] have been born a Branham and be lost
[1:07:24] you're a greater privilege to be a son
[1:07:27] and daughter of God just because your
[1:07:29] last name you're not guaranteed anything
[1:07:31] come on friends the only name that
[1:07:34] counts is the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:07:35] Christ that's the only name that's the
[1:07:38] only name that anybody is saved by
[1:07:41] that's the only name
[1:07:42] Donal recognized because that's the name
[1:07:45] of salvation and redemption and
[1:07:47] righteousness and salvation and holiness
[1:07:51] so in this spirit of intercessory he no
[1:07:55] doubt how it moved within the heart of
[1:07:57] Abraham I'll tell you it shows us the
[1:07:59] power of a separated life before God
[1:08:01] when knowing when Abraham he begins to
[1:08:04] stay here and he's you know staying with
[1:08:07] the Lord the Bible says in Genesis 18 22
[1:08:10] that the men turned their faces from
[1:08:12] fence and they went toward Sodom but
[1:08:15] Abraham stood yet before the Lord and
[1:08:19] Abraham drew near and said well now also
[1:08:22] destroy the righteous with the wicked
[1:08:26] look at this spirit of intercession
[1:08:29] peradventure there be 50 righteous
[1:08:33] within the city wilt thou also destroy
[1:08:35] and not spare the the place for the
[1:08:39] fifty righteous that are therein that be
[1:08:42] far from thee to do after this manner
[1:08:45] Abraham in tune with God's heart to slay
[1:08:50] the righteous with the wicked and that
[1:08:52] the righteous should be as the wicked
[1:08:55] that be far from thee shall not the
[1:08:59] judge of all the earth do right see this
[1:09:03] intercessory work that's taking place
[1:09:06] do you realize what a blessing it is to
[1:09:08] have your eyes open because when you
[1:09:11] have your eyes open you're able to truly
[1:09:13] intercede you're not interceding about
[1:09:16] getting somebody to a church you're not
[1:09:18] interceding about getting somebody Lord
[1:09:20] that they believe just like I do know
[1:09:22] you're interceding knowing that the
[1:09:24] answer is Jesus Christ you're not trying
[1:09:27] to get him to a camp you're trying to
[1:09:29] get them to Jesus Christ throw to me to
[1:09:35] God God goes on to say yeah 450 I'll
[1:09:39] spirit in verse 26 in verse 27 Abraham
[1:09:41] said behold now I have taken upon me to
[1:09:45] speak unto the Lord which am but dust
[1:09:47] and ashes he knew he were nothing but
[1:09:49] dust and ashes but he was in contact
[1:09:51] with the Lord God Oh glory be to God so
[1:09:56] Abraham
[1:09:56] prayed earnestly look at that very
[1:09:58] nature of Christ and Abraham that called
[1:10:01] out for lot you know brother Ram take
[1:10:03] many different angles on lot many
[1:10:05] different ways that you find even have
[1:10:07] brother Ram will bring certain types in
[1:10:08] certain ways good and just for example
[1:10:10] you know billet and many times will and
[1:10:12] we always recognize that crossing into
[1:10:14] the promised land used to cross into the
[1:10:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost yet brother
[1:10:17] Ram will take us in the message
[1:10:19] redemption and completeness and joy and
[1:10:20] he'll speak of how them coming through
[1:10:22] the Red Sea that that was actually the
[1:10:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost you see he was
[1:10:26] applying things that came by divine
[1:10:29] power and is to recognize the type and
[1:10:31] has its being spoken of in that moment
[1:10:33] and we know that what would speak of the
[1:10:35] righteous one lot does not speak of the
[1:10:38] elect but yet there are times that
[1:10:39] brother Branham would use this as an
[1:10:41] example to where brother Ram would say
[1:10:43] that lot himself was unaware of
[1:10:45] impending judgment and then brother
[1:10:47] rambles talked about it that lot himself
[1:10:49] was a believer who got himself singled
[1:10:52] out from the rest of the body so it's
[1:10:56] watching how things are applied remember
[1:10:58] it was it was Lots own ambitions that
[1:11:01] caused him to separate from the rest of
[1:11:03] the body now if you can apply this
[1:11:04] correctly here and we can look at and
[1:11:07] say well he got his own ambitions and
[1:11:08] got returning towards the things of the
[1:11:10] world and that can happen what a person
[1:11:12] can actually begin to become so wrapped
[1:11:14] up in everything looking at the success
[1:11:16] of life and what they can have that they
[1:11:18] fail to recognize this life yes but a
[1:11:20] vapor you don't have a promise of
[1:11:22] tomorrow why would you want to give all
[1:11:24] your all your work and resources for a
[1:11:26] house that when you get retired you
[1:11:28] won't even be able to enjoy you
[1:11:31] understand what I'm saying it's a
[1:11:32] reality that this is just a plea of
[1:11:35] leading passing time it don't mean that
[1:11:37] we're not to work for things but it
[1:11:39] means that we're not to have our
[1:11:40] ambitions and our goals our affections
[1:11:42] set on things of this earth but to see
[1:11:45] that how but even with lot himself
[1:11:47] brother Ram talks about how that we you
[1:11:49] know in that wolf can get that deer all
[1:11:51] singled out from the rest of them he
[1:11:52] tells us don't forsake to assemble
[1:11:54] yourselves together he said when the
[1:11:56] devil can get you all isolated off to
[1:11:58] yourself to where you actually believe
[1:12:00] and start to think that I can be just a
[1:12:03] good a Christian at home as I can of
[1:12:05] church and brother Ram says you cannot
[1:12:08] do that
[1:12:08] you can do it it's totally contrary to
[1:12:12] God's provided way but he said you get
[1:12:15] yourself all singled out you get
[1:12:17] yourself all drawn out you know why
[1:12:19] you're not willing to walk on with God
[1:12:21] we need one another program tells us in
[1:12:24] that same quote we need one another more
[1:12:26] now than we ever did he said see when
[1:12:28] you're in fellowship with one another
[1:12:29] you have people who pray for you people
[1:12:33] who holds your name up before the throne
[1:12:35] of God I'll tell you what if you don't
[1:12:37] got nobody else to pray for you put me
[1:12:39] on your list every moment of the day
[1:12:41] every hour say Lord God brother Samuel
[1:12:44] needs help Lord he needs help by the
[1:12:46] same udl I sure do need help I need his
[1:12:49] leadership
[1:12:50] I need his grace and His mercy every day
[1:12:53] of my life I'm not dependent on my works
[1:12:55] or my righteousness I'm depending on him
[1:13:00] no repeater god I look here you know at
[1:13:04] Abraham you look at law he got himself
[1:13:06] all singled out you know his pride is he
[1:13:08] got too ambitious and looking at things
[1:13:11] but I think God that Abraham was able to
[1:13:13] stand there and said Lord will you spare
[1:13:16] it if there's only ten only ten will you
[1:13:20] spare it God said I'll spare it if
[1:13:21] there's only ten Abraham was so on with
[1:13:27] God's nature I'll tell you Abraham like
[1:13:31] Noah he caught the real kernel of the
[1:13:34] message in that hour it's a message of
[1:13:38] preserving life when Daniel and Daniel
[1:13:41] chapter 9 when there was a hasty
[1:13:45] decision regarding here the image of the
[1:13:48] beast
[1:13:49] the dream that Nebuchadnezzar has and he
[1:13:51] rose up and said I want you to kill all
[1:13:53] the last man daniel stood up in that
[1:13:55] hour and daniel said why is the king so
[1:13:58] hasty with his judgment he said let us
[1:14:02] pray and seek for the mercies of God and
[1:14:04] Daniel stood up and he began to pray he
[1:14:08] took his fellows with him the rest of
[1:14:10] them didn't know what to do but Daniel
[1:14:12] had contact with God and then you could
[1:14:14] stand there and pray for the mercies of
[1:14:16] God and God revealed to Daniel and the
[1:14:19] Bible says when God revealed to Daniel
[1:14:21] answer it said Daniel bowed himself and
[1:14:24] begin to worship the Lord an answer came
[1:14:28] brother and that answer itself was well
[1:14:31] that Daniel needed and Daniel knew I've
[1:14:33] got the answer
[1:14:34] this same answer in when it's delivered
[1:14:36] it's going to spare death guess that has
[1:14:39] sought to take this province its sought
[1:14:42] to take wise man but this answer that's
[1:14:45] come strictly and straightly from the
[1:14:47] throne of God it's called the secret of
[1:14:50] life it's gonna preserve lifes in this
[1:14:52] hour why there was one who was able to
[1:14:55] stand there and said let's intercede on
[1:14:57] behalf i'm telling you brother and
[1:14:59] sister the rest of the wise men did not
[1:15:02] become elect Hebrews but they were saved
[1:15:05] because God himself there was salvation
[1:15:08] that went throughout that Kingdom and
[1:15:10] God preserved his elect and he preserved
[1:15:13] the other wise men because of the prayer
[1:15:15] of intercession then you believe God
[1:15:18] still answered prayer glory that's one
[1:15:24] thing the Holy Ghost it brings in our
[1:15:26] life to have power with prayer think
[1:15:28] about this a living an intercessor in
[1:15:30] life brother bamboo you know he talks
[1:15:32] about this and souls in prison he talks
[1:15:34] about how that women would dress he
[1:15:36] talks about some of me you know he said
[1:15:38] they'll make fun of you about how you
[1:15:39] you'd wrestled fashion and
[1:15:41] so forth and you look like a Holy Roller
[1:15:42] he said don't you worry you got
[1:15:44] something a little sex green that don't
[1:15:46] got the world all looking out there she
[1:15:49] hasn't got it oh she's doomed you got
[1:15:51] more on you got virtue
[1:15:52] she's got nothing she got a bait that
[1:15:54] traps all all souls in the hell the
[1:15:56] blind walks into it now you've got
[1:15:58] something now you better watch how you
[1:15:59] take this this is not meant to walk with
[1:16:03] pride you realize brother man tells us
[1:16:06] and how can overcome he talks about the
[1:16:08] sisters he said getting long hair and
[1:16:11] you start to get a pride about your long
[1:16:14] hair it's not enough just to have the
[1:16:17] right clothing out here
[1:16:18] I believe in holiness out here but I
[1:16:20] also believe in the spirit of meekness
[1:16:22] on the inside so what's what he's
[1:16:26] telling here here you are your life the
[1:16:28] way that you're dressed your life your
[1:16:32] life is actually preaching
[1:16:36] he said you know you may not even be on
[1:16:38] a church book but it might be your
[1:16:42] righteous life that's holding the wrath
[1:16:45] of God from the world today
[1:16:47] the world won't believe it you woman
[1:16:49] that's called Holy Roller you little man
[1:16:51] that don't hardly know anything but you
[1:16:52] cried at God day and night for the sins
[1:16:55] of the country you might be the one
[1:16:57] that's holding off the wrath where God
[1:16:59] said if I can find 10 I'll spare it if I
[1:17:01] can find 10 as he was in the days of
[1:17:03] South asylum so shall it be
[1:17:05] he said not if I can find 10 Methodist
[1:17:07] and Baptist 10 Pentecostals 10 athletes
[1:17:10] 10 message believers Mize will bring it
[1:17:13] on down come on friends if I can find
[1:17:17] ten senators if I can find ten ministers
[1:17:20] but if I can find ten righteous there is
[1:17:22] one righteous that's Christ Christ
[1:17:26] living in one them ten of spirit so the
[1:17:33] righteousness God was looking for the
[1:17:36] blood if he found the blood
[1:17:40] he'll spirit do you realize even right
[1:17:44] now
[1:17:44] what's holding back the wrath of God is
[1:17:47] because you and I under the blood are
[1:17:51] here and there's still more names to be
[1:17:55] splashed names or name or whatever it's
[1:17:59] still dear Ellis when you walk in a
[1:18:00] workplace your life failed by and
[1:18:04] shrouded by the blood of Jesus Christ do
[1:18:06] you realize it's holding the wrath of
[1:18:09] God back to minister grace to hearts and
[1:18:13] lives now I'm saying like this here
[1:18:15] let's try to kind of bring this down
[1:18:17] here remember Jesus and we looked at
[1:18:20] this a little bit on the Sundays Jesus
[1:18:23] he knew what was going to take place
[1:18:25] with Peter but he told Peter I prayed
[1:18:29] for you he knew the direction was going
[1:18:33] to be taken but that had to be for the
[1:18:34] fulfillment of the word but he said I
[1:18:36] prayed for you when you're converted
[1:18:39] then you go sprint strengthen your
[1:18:40] brother
[1:18:41] you see intercessory prayer it's being
[1:18:45] able to pray for one another you
[1:18:48] to the promise by the same spirit where
[1:18:51] you that same faith that moves in your
[1:18:55] heart that's how you pray you pray by
[1:18:58] the same effectual faith and work that
[1:19:02] God has done in your life and that's how
[1:19:05] you're able to effectually pray you see
[1:19:08] intercession by the spirit it's
[1:19:10] recognized by the Word of God in the
[1:19:13] plan of God intercessory player
[1:19:15] intercessory prayer is not asking God to
[1:19:18] bless something he's cursed like I could
[1:19:23] not pray god bless the USA I can't pray
[1:19:26] that you with me yet I can still pray
[1:19:31] according how the scripture says that I
[1:19:34] would that every man pray everywhere and
[1:19:36] Paul goes through and speaking of who
[1:19:38] and how that you ought to pray you see
[1:19:41] even when brother Graham said I've given
[1:19:43] up praying for her but remember brother
[1:19:44] Branham would offer a prayer for the
[1:19:46] president
[1:19:47] you see it's having discernment within
[1:19:49] those things brother BAM was not praying
[1:19:51] that America would turn around because
[1:19:53] she's already send away her day of grace
[1:19:56] but there are lives and hearts that are
[1:19:58] still here you with me so when we look
[1:20:02] at this it's having an understanding
[1:20:04] because even when Abraham prayed for
[1:20:06] Ishmael
[1:20:07] even though Abraham had his heart that
[1:20:10] he desired that God would bless Ishmael
[1:20:12] but he wanted to make Ishmael that he
[1:20:15] would be the one of the Covenant but you
[1:20:17] see even though Abraham being elect of
[1:20:19] God and having an intercessory prayer he
[1:20:22] God he could not change what God had
[1:20:25] already ordered that it was not going to
[1:20:27] be Ishmael that he would make the
[1:20:29] covenant with but with Isaac aren't you
[1:20:32] glad that in your life in my life the
[1:20:34] Covenant is not with Ishmael it's with
[1:20:37] Isaac amen the book of your first Union
[1:20:42] has been put in the Sea of God's
[1:20:43] forgetfulness Ishmael was under that
[1:20:46] first union but now under this new union
[1:20:49] with Christ Jesus
[1:20:51] it is the Isaac that was promised
[1:20:53] because we in Christ take on Abraham's
[1:20:56] seed we are joint heirs with Christ
[1:20:59] Jesus we are
[1:21:01] in the covenant of the covenant life and
[1:21:04] giver himself oh my just think of how
[1:21:08] this to be an intercessor you must be
[1:21:10] filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:21:12] you must be filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:21:15] you see feel because what the Holy
[1:21:17] Spirit is the new birth its eyes men
[1:21:21] cannot even see the kingdom of God
[1:21:22] except he'd be born again it gives
[1:21:24] eyesight things that others cannot see
[1:21:28] it gives eyesight and listen to me now
[1:21:31] even when others who aren't born again
[1:21:34] but there might be things that are going
[1:21:35] on that they don't even see but another
[1:21:38] one who is in the body they're able to
[1:21:40] call out and say lord help my brother
[1:21:43] help my sister and they're able to pray
[1:21:45] on their behalf in intercessory prayer
[1:21:48] now you and I this is the way that I
[1:21:51] believe with intercessory prayer that is
[1:21:53] the same spirit of christ that's praying
[1:21:56] through us according to the promise you
[1:21:58] know the bible tells us in Luke chapter
[1:22:00] 18 I'm not going to read all this but
[1:22:02] the Bible talks about that there were
[1:22:04] two men that went up to the temple to
[1:22:06] pray and this is in Luke 18 verse 9 and
[1:22:09] there was a Pharisee in verse 11 that
[1:22:11] said the Pharisee stood and prayed thus
[1:22:14] with himself god I thank thee that I am
[1:22:21] not as other men are extortioners unjust
[1:22:24] adulterers or even as this public Oh
[1:22:30] Lord
[1:22:31] this kind of sounds like they were in
[1:22:33] the same church I fast twice a week I
[1:22:39] give tithes of all that I possess and
[1:22:43] the publican standing afar off would not
[1:22:48] lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven
[1:22:52] but smote upon his breast saying God be
[1:22:57] merciful to me a sinner I tell you this
[1:23:04] man went down to his house justified
[1:23:06] rather than the other I don't care what
[1:23:09] the other had done I don't care if he
[1:23:11] did everything twice a day he did not go
[1:23:13] down to his
[1:23:14] justified because he had justified
[1:23:17] himself no man shall be justified in the
[1:23:21] eyes of God outside of the blood of the
[1:23:23] Lord Jesus Christ if your rest is in
[1:23:26] your works you're still lost
[1:23:28] but you must rest in the blood of the
[1:23:30] Lord Jesus Christ if you're resting in
[1:23:34] him listen brother and sister you have
[1:23:36] been set free from your own works for
[1:23:44] everyone that exalteth himself shall be
[1:23:46] abased and he that humbleth himself
[1:23:49] shall be exalted see sometimes God lets
[1:23:56] you see wrong see what you're gonna do
[1:23:59] about it he'll let you see it what are
[1:24:02] you gonna do about it
[1:24:03] intend there's been a lot of things I'll
[1:24:05] be honest with you you know what no
[1:24:07] doubt it's wrong with me I don't think
[1:24:08] but there's a lot there's things that I
[1:24:11] have you know just sometimes going
[1:24:12] around and I see different things let me
[1:24:14] just tell you the approach I've taken
[1:24:15] with it I looked at it like this I said
[1:24:17] Lord you let me see certain things but
[1:24:20] it's not to criticize the person but
[1:24:22] you've let me see it and I'm asking you
[1:24:24] to help me let my feet be ordered
[1:24:27] because I don't believe that brother
[1:24:28] meant wrong I don't believe this one
[1:24:30] means wrong Lord help me help them Lord
[1:24:32] help me you showed this to me I'm
[1:24:34] responsible now there would be more
[1:24:36] mercy for that individual than it would
[1:24:39] be for me but I look at it like that I
[1:24:41] need God's grace we all need God's grace
[1:24:44] I tell you friends that's a reality here
[1:24:47] in this life it isn't that were just oh
[1:24:49] we're a bunch of sorry people
[1:24:50] we can't live a victorious life that's
[1:24:52] not what I'm talking about I'm saying
[1:24:54] that we need God's grace every single
[1:24:56] day if there's any victory or any praise
[1:24:58] in our life it's because of the Lord
[1:25:01] Jesus Christ you realize the attitude
[1:25:05] that we take even when we come together
[1:25:06] it will affect whether his presence
[1:25:10] comes down among us or not we can take
[1:25:13] this kind of an attitude right here well
[1:25:15] I think God I'm not like a lot who
[1:25:17] turned his tent going down that way
[1:25:19] bless God I'm not turning my tent my
[1:25:22] tennis straight right here that ain't
[1:25:23] intercessory prayer you're justifying
[1:25:26] yourself before the throne of God
[1:25:28] in a matter of fact they don't even have
[1:25:29] access to the blood is not opening Jesus
[1:25:32] Christ blood does not open for
[1:25:35] accusation brother the devil is there to
[1:25:37] accuse they are not you cannot come
[1:25:40] before the throne of God and accuse your
[1:25:43] brother or sister you can't do it I want
[1:25:48] you think about this what about us when
[1:25:52] you look at how brother Branham himself
[1:25:53] and I mentioned to you last week about
[1:25:56] him standing in that little place in
[1:25:59] Cleveland cleburn's cafeteria there in
[1:26:01] Toledo remember that little lady how she
[1:26:03] was scantily dressed and that policeman
[1:26:05] had his arm around her
[1:26:06] you remember how brother Branham had the
[1:26:07] attitude toward it God how can you let
[1:26:09] such stand my little daughter's Lord God
[1:26:12] I don't want them to be raised up in
[1:26:13] this field how can you let stuff such
[1:26:16] stuff stand around here like this and
[1:26:17] brother Graham tells us of how that God
[1:26:19] took him around and you know how God
[1:26:21] began to show him a vision of the world
[1:26:22] and how that every time his sins that
[1:26:25] they would they would come up but there
[1:26:27] was a bumper of blood that was there
[1:26:29] that he would actually take care of his
[1:26:31] sins and you know how it went on brother
[1:26:33] Ram says that hound that the Lord said
[1:26:35] you know he said I've forgiven you he
[1:26:37] said but you're wanting to stand here
[1:26:39] and condemn her and you know how when
[1:26:41] when the whole thing goes on these are
[1:26:43] this is a key statement that I always
[1:26:45] look at in there brother Ram says I seen
[1:26:47] in God's eyes I was as bad as she was
[1:26:56] that has been a loaded statement for me
[1:26:59] over the years
[1:27:01] it wasn't brother man standing there in
[1:27:03] shorts in a halter top but you see it's
[1:27:06] not just about the clothing out here
[1:27:09] it's the clothing in here you've got to
[1:27:13] have the right clothing on the inside
[1:27:15] and no doubt all the pressures every one
[1:27:18] of us friends sometimes you go in place
[1:27:20] you think really do we have to have the
[1:27:22] music this loud is this supposed to help
[1:27:24] me synchronize my bites of steak and cut
[1:27:27] it a certain Lane what's what's supposed
[1:27:31] to do is supposed to make me faster so I
[1:27:33] eat more and I spend more money
[1:27:34] sometimes you know you go to certain
[1:27:36] places and you know so really there's
[1:27:38] only some places you can go certain
[1:27:40] times of the day and actually hear some
[1:27:41] the rest of time you just read their
[1:27:42] lips and say we'll talk afterwards let's
[1:27:44] just eat right now you know you can get
[1:27:47] to a place you can think lord have mercy
[1:27:49] why do they happen you know you can get
[1:27:50] yourself in such a ynx such an
[1:27:53] atmosphere about yourself say god help
[1:27:58] us god help us they might be your
[1:28:01] tendency it may not be your tendency but
[1:28:03] nonetheless we need the help of the Lord
[1:28:05] and I say like this before brother Brown
[1:28:09] could ever intercede for that woman in
[1:28:11] prayer he had to have the right spirit
[1:28:14] on the inside to intercede for you see
[1:28:17] before you could ever pray for somebody
[1:28:19] you got to have a heart for him you got
[1:28:22] to be able to enter in you may not know
[1:28:24] what they're going through it may not be
[1:28:26] that you condone their actions that
[1:28:27] someone I'm talking about I'm talking
[1:28:29] about you look and say Lord I don't know
[1:28:31] what they're going through I don't know
[1:28:32] what they're feeling the Lord I don't
[1:28:34] know what they've been through but I
[1:28:35] believe they belong to you Lord and I
[1:28:37] pray that God that you would help them
[1:28:39] Lord God but you and minister to them as
[1:28:42] you've ministered to me Lord you're
[1:28:44] standing there intercession they may not
[1:28:46] even have the strength or the confidence
[1:28:49] to raise their head but remember the
[1:28:51] Lord Jesus knew that about Peter and he
[1:28:53] said don't tell Peter my disciple that
[1:28:57] I'm going before him God knows what he's
[1:29:01] doing that's where I will look what
[1:29:04] about us what about us in every local
[1:29:07] assembly every local assembly right here
[1:29:10] it's like a womb it's like a womb you're
[1:29:14] carrying with a desire to see life come
[1:29:17] forth there are many different stages
[1:29:21] right here present there's not one of
[1:29:23] you including myself that can speed
[1:29:26] somebody along but we want to be a help
[1:29:29] we want to keep moving as God letting
[1:29:32] Moses to keep moving they kept praying
[1:29:34] and look brother sister every time they
[1:29:36] prayed they kept moving every time they
[1:29:38] prayed they kept moving God was moving
[1:29:41] and interceding many different stages
[1:29:45] but there must be a resounding faith to
[1:29:49] intercede and minister to the needs that
[1:29:52] are present
[1:29:53] the Bible says in Philippians Paul told
[1:29:56] the church looking on every man on his
[1:29:58] own things but also on the things of
[1:30:01] others
[1:30:02] this is where the Prophet would admonish
[1:30:04] some of the older seasoned sisters in
[1:30:07] the spirit of sweetness to go and try to
[1:30:10] help others this is where he would
[1:30:12] Mohnish the older brethren speak to the
[1:30:14] younger this is just a little foretaste
[1:30:19] here it's just a little drum but you see
[1:30:21] we all have something to do your there's
[1:30:25] a burden in your heart for this assembly
[1:30:27] I trust there is it's not about making
[1:30:30] this church all we want this church to
[1:30:32] be now we're interested in crys being
[1:30:35] reflected in lives that's what we're
[1:30:39] burning for that's why we would speak
[1:30:41] with one another that's why we would
[1:30:43] take time to call somebody catch
[1:30:45] somebody that's why we would help them
[1:30:47] encourage them along the way somebody
[1:30:49] else might look and say they don't
[1:30:50] deserve encouragement but yet somebody
[1:30:53] needs to be encouraged sometimes they
[1:30:55] know they're beneath sin they know
[1:30:57] they're loaded down but they need to be
[1:31:00] encouraged just point them to the one
[1:31:02] who can help them in their time of need
[1:31:05] they're already beat down shut down
[1:31:07] they're already down there they need to
[1:31:10] be pointed and lift up their eyes unto
[1:31:13] Him what about us what brother Sammy
[1:31:19] you've got that hey this ain't a one-man
[1:31:20] show the days of one man ministry are
[1:31:23] over buddy
[1:31:24] this is a body ministry this is where
[1:31:27] there's a burden that moves through this
[1:31:28] church where you're a part of this local
[1:31:30] assembly you say I'm a part of the bride
[1:31:32] of Jesus Christ I am to worldwide but
[1:31:35] God gave me a burden for this local
[1:31:37] assembly for the lives that are here I
[1:31:39] pray and I study according to what God
[1:31:43] has placed before me here that's where
[1:31:45] my that's where my whole reliance is
[1:31:47] with that do you pray for the rest of
[1:31:49] the body I do
[1:31:50] but yet I know where God has placed me
[1:31:53] and there's a burden here that no matter
[1:31:56] if I wanted to lay it down I can't I
[1:31:59] can't woe unto me if I preach not the
[1:32:03] gospel
[1:32:05] you think there aren't times that I felt
[1:32:07] like just saying you know what I'm
[1:32:08] discouraged sure there have been times
[1:32:11] like that but whoa and to me if I don't
[1:32:13] preach the gospel I didn't get myself
[1:32:15] this burden I did not get myself this
[1:32:18] love for the people and you did not give
[1:32:20] yourself the love that you have for the
[1:32:23] body of Jesus Christ for the brothers
[1:32:25] and sisters of where you've got a burden
[1:32:27] to see Christ glorified and magnify in
[1:32:30] the light you didn't do that but God did
[1:32:32] that in your life we are a member of one
[1:32:37] body if God wanted us to be one big
[1:32:42] massive body around the world of which
[1:32:45] that is the entire body of Jesus Christ
[1:32:47] he would have left it like that but
[1:32:50] that's not how God seen fit you realize
[1:32:53] he could have done that all of those who
[1:32:56] gathered out of this province he could
[1:32:58] said okay you come out of this province
[1:33:00] we want y'all to come right back here to
[1:33:01] Jerusalem all you from Antioch come back
[1:33:04] here to Jerusalem all you from Corinth
[1:33:06] you know you can't live in Corinth you
[1:33:07] gonna go to hell come on back to
[1:33:08] Jerusalem you know all those are in
[1:33:10] closet oh come on you gotta come back to
[1:33:12] Jerusalem they had already met the high
[1:33:16] priests and King of Jerusalem Jerusalem
[1:33:20] the Holy Spirit fell in Jerusalem as a
[1:33:23] promise that is where David's throne
[1:33:26] will sit in the Millennium it moves into
[1:33:30] our hearts right now by the baptism of
[1:33:32] the Holy Ghost God keeping a promise
[1:33:34] that he made in his word but now to see
[1:33:37] that Jerusalem being unfolded in the
[1:33:40] lives and hearts of been believing
[1:33:42] children to where you and I would stand
[1:33:44] right here and have a heart to pray for
[1:33:47] one another
[1:33:51] your loving I think of how Paul said I
[1:33:54] in ceased to pray for you I think of one
[1:34:01] brother here
[1:34:01] I won't call his name out but he texts
[1:34:04] him here just just some days ago and
[1:34:07] there was some needs that he had heard
[1:34:08] about you know within the churches
[1:34:09] things it was and he said you know
[1:34:11] buscemi said we may not be able to be
[1:34:13] there he said as far as you know right
[1:34:15] there he said but we
[1:34:17] and stand right in prayer I looked at
[1:34:19] that text I said God thank you they may
[1:34:22] not have been able to stand right here
[1:34:23] but yet to see it that how they're a
[1:34:26] part of this assembly they're here but
[1:34:28] you look at it they said we may not be
[1:34:30] able to be but we're standing in prayer
[1:34:31] I said things be to God
[1:34:34] no wonder Paul could talk about
[1:34:36] travailing you know it's revealed
[1:34:38] together in Christ until Christ be
[1:34:41] formed in you let me just skip down here
[1:34:48] don't you love him let me just close
[1:34:52] with this
[1:34:59] here's Israel in the days of Samuel they
[1:35:06] made a choice and the choice they made
[1:35:10] was based on what they were seeing out
[1:35:12] of other countries other countries had a
[1:35:15] king and so they made a choice that they
[1:35:18] themselves wanted a king God let his
[1:35:23] displeasure be known to him Samuel
[1:35:26] prayed for him and then Samuel came to
[1:35:30] him and he let him know that within it
[1:35:36] all of this has been prayed for he says
[1:35:40] in verse 20 at first verse Samuel 12
[1:35:43] because God actually let a sign be given
[1:35:45] by the Thunder and by the rain in the
[1:35:48] time of harvest that I disapprove and
[1:35:52] then look at how the people became the
[1:35:55] Bible says in verse 19 they said to
[1:35:58] Samuel pray for thy servants unto the
[1:36:00] Lord thy God that we die not for we have
[1:36:04] added unto all our sins this evil to ask
[1:36:08] us a king and Samuel said unto the
[1:36:11] people fear not you have done all this
[1:36:13] wickedness yet turned not aside from
[1:36:16] following the Lord but serve the Lord
[1:36:19] with all your heart
[1:36:23] and turn you not aside for then should
[1:36:27] you go after vain things which cannot
[1:36:29] profit nor deliver for they are vain for
[1:36:32] the Lord will not forsake his people for
[1:36:36] his great namesake because it hath
[1:36:38] pleased the Lord to make you his people
[1:36:42] I love this next part moreover as for me
[1:36:47] God forbid that I should sin against the
[1:36:52] Lord in ceasing to pray for you though
[1:36:58] they were in the wrong Samuel said God
[1:37:00] forgive forbid that I sin against God in
[1:37:05] ceasing to pray for you but I will teach
[1:37:12] you the good and the right way of the
[1:37:18] mercy of God I want you to think of this
[1:37:23] and we can apply this down here just as
[1:37:26] God can look into Moses heart and see
[1:37:29] the cross he could see the love the
[1:37:32] Moses had for the people he saw the love
[1:37:35] of God of the promise properly placed in
[1:37:39] his heart and it drew God's attention
[1:37:42] away from the stubbornness of the people
[1:37:45] and it drew it to the promise of himself
[1:37:48] as Christ here veiled in Moses and I
[1:37:53] want you to recognize that same word as
[1:37:57] the Lord Jesus said if ye abide in me
[1:38:00] and my word about it in you ask what you
[1:38:04] will and it shall be done unto you I'll
[1:38:09] tell you when I think of that in terms
[1:38:10] of the scriptures I look at that in
[1:38:13] Romans chapter 8 and he just bear with
[1:38:15] me just a moment I'm coming down if you
[1:38:17] look at it of how that you and I in a
[1:38:19] journey the Bible says that in Romans
[1:38:22] 8:26 the Spirit helpeth our infirmities
[1:38:26] it helps our weaknesses I'm not going to
[1:38:30] ask you to raise your hand but every one
[1:38:32] of us have weakness
[1:38:35] we're encompassed with weakness for we
[1:38:39] know not what we should pray for as we
[1:38:42] ought but the Spirit itself maketh
[1:38:44] intercession for us with groanings which
[1:38:46] cannot be uttered do you realize that
[1:38:49] the same Spirit of God living in you and
[1:38:51] I it is United us with Christ Jesus we
[1:38:55] are accepted in the beloved we are
[1:38:57] identified with our high priest we are
[1:39:00] in him and he is the high priest of his
[1:39:04] word
[1:39:06] he is our intercession he is the high
[1:39:10] priest that was selected from among men
[1:39:13] to represent you and I to offer up gifts
[1:39:16] on our behalf to intercede for you and I
[1:39:18] when we don't even know how to pray but
[1:39:21] the spirit maketh intercession according
[1:39:24] to our weaknesses you know why even in
[1:39:26] the midst of our mistakes and our
[1:39:28] failures but yet the Spirit of Christ on
[1:39:31] the inside of you and I remember it's
[1:39:33] calling out cuz there's a mediator on
[1:39:35] the throne but the Spirit of God on the
[1:39:38] inside of you he knows how to be the
[1:39:40] right kind of a mediator in me and you
[1:39:43] I'm telling you you and I've got
[1:39:45] somebody on the throne who never rose up
[1:39:48] and raised up to the heavens and forgot
[1:39:51] his humanity down here but he took that
[1:39:54] remembrance all the way to glory and on
[1:39:57] the throne and glory tonight
[1:39:59] there sits a human body there sets a
[1:40:02] body there as a memorial that I have
[1:40:05] overcome the world be a good cheer I
[1:40:08] have shed the blood even though the
[1:40:10] accuser wants to point out all kinds of
[1:40:13] faults but my blood has taken care of
[1:40:15] what Adam did and Adam sold them out but
[1:40:19] I paid the price and I have redeemed
[1:40:22] them but they're not perfect oh but
[1:40:26] they're in my perfection they are
[1:40:30] perfect and coming to perfection are you
[1:40:34] with me what's he looking at this is why
[1:40:37] brother Branham in that same quote I've
[1:40:38] been reading to you look at the power of
[1:40:40] believer God seemed to love the Moses
[1:40:42] had for the people brother brems would
[1:40:44] see that's why the word must be abiding
[1:40:46] in you because when the words are
[1:40:48] biting in you God is not looking at your
[1:40:50] stubbornness he's looking at the life of
[1:40:53] the word that's living on the inside of
[1:40:56] you I'm telling you I'm grateful there
[1:41:00] is a blood that's there that's able to
[1:41:01] capture his attention and now I'm the
[1:41:04] only just capturing his attention but
[1:41:06] there's an effectual working by the
[1:41:08] divine grace of God that's able to move
[1:41:11] on my behalf to able to lift me and give
[1:41:14] me strength
[1:41:15] that I'm able to live and overcoming
[1:41:17] life and prevailing over every gate of
[1:41:20] the enemy I'm glad about that tonight
[1:41:22] the Bible said he searches the hearts he
[1:41:27] that search of the hearts knoweth what
[1:41:29] is the mind of the Spirit because he
[1:41:33] maketh intercession for the Saints
[1:41:37] according to the will of God I want you
[1:41:42] to think of this according to the will
[1:41:46] of God brother Brennan gives us two
[1:41:47] examples just just two out of so many
[1:41:50] there was a brother getting ready to go
[1:41:52] down on a plane there was a plane
[1:41:54] getting they told him we don't know if
[1:41:54] this plane is going to land if it does
[1:41:56] the landing gears not coming out so
[1:41:59] we're gonna try to land it but we don't
[1:42:00] know what's gonna happen
[1:42:00] brother Brown meets the brother later on
[1:42:03] on the platform but the brother said
[1:42:06] Lord wherever brother Branham is in the
[1:42:08] world would you put my name before him
[1:42:10] right now he said because I believe he
[1:42:14] can touch the throne of God for him for
[1:42:15] me brother Bram said he was you know he
[1:42:19] didn't realize but this brother's name
[1:42:20] just come to him you know after brother
[1:42:21] Bram got to talk to the brother and got
[1:42:23] to asking times and dates and stuff what
[1:42:25] it was God dropped the name of that
[1:42:27] brother and brother Rams heart and
[1:42:29] brother Bryan prayed for him and just as
[1:42:31] that plane was coming down landing gear
[1:42:34] popped out they met on the platform and
[1:42:36] identified all that brother bran said
[1:42:38] was a spirit of intercession bill Graham
[1:42:40] went on to talk about a baby who was
[1:42:42] around the tabernacle there they had
[1:42:44] called and so forth and brother bran
[1:42:46] wasn't able to get to it but brother Ram
[1:42:47] started praying and when he started
[1:42:49] praying he said you know he said they
[1:42:51] had to go ahead he said I couldn't go
[1:42:52] down in the hospital right then because
[1:42:53] they were getting ready to do tests on
[1:42:54] the baby and give us some kind of a
[1:42:55] treatment he said I knew would be a long
[1:42:57] process so I just stayed at home I'm and
[1:42:59] I prayed he said I got a report he's
[1:43:02] when I was finally got to the hospital
[1:43:03] that that baby had already gotten better
[1:43:06] he said so I just walked over putting
[1:43:08] her hand on her knee and just thank God
[1:43:09] he said see it wasn't about that I had
[1:43:11] to be there it was the Holy Spirit that
[1:43:13] interceded on behalf of that baby I'm
[1:43:17] telling you he's still the same God
[1:43:19] tonight he's still the same God I've
[1:43:23] witnessed in right here in this assembly
[1:43:24] it's not just something I've got to
[1:43:27] refer back to the message about I can
[1:43:29] bring it right here to this assembly
[1:43:30] bring it in my own life that the Holy
[1:43:32] Spirit is still an intercessor that
[1:43:35] intercede on behalf of one another I'll
[1:43:38] tell you tonight I'll say God don't let
[1:43:40] me just get my eyes on me myself and I
[1:43:42] and just my family but God let me have
[1:43:44] the right heart like Abraham had even
[1:43:46] though Locke wasn't under Abraham's nose
[1:43:48] but Abraham said he is part of the land
[1:43:51] and you gave me the land and I'm
[1:43:53] claiming him I'm glad that there's a
[1:43:59] spirit the Spirit of God let's stand
[1:44:03] it's our advocate brother and sister
[1:44:05] it's our advocate brother bill it's our
[1:44:09] advocate you know what an advocate is
[1:44:12] it's somebody who stands in on your
[1:44:14] behalf it's something to wear that as
[1:44:19] program says we stagger ignorantly
[1:44:21] sometimes into things fall into traps I
[1:44:25] want to ask you to raise your hands but
[1:44:27] they're saying you can look at and say
[1:44:28] oh my why did I say that like that Lord
[1:44:32] why not this well you get to look in on
[1:44:34] that and you recognize it within it it's
[1:44:36] much your heart but there's an advocate
[1:44:38] there for you if you confess your sin
[1:44:40] he's faithful and just to forgive you I
[1:44:41] know sometimes it's hard cuz everything
[1:44:44] is there and you wall within and under
[1:44:46] self condemnation but remember there he
[1:44:48] ever liveth to make intercession and if
[1:44:51] God be for us who can be against us you
[1:44:53] see what it is draw his attention to
[1:44:55] that word if something strikes your
[1:44:57] heart make it right there in the
[1:44:59] presence of God say Lord forgive me what
[1:45:01] are you doing you're drawing his
[1:45:02] attention there to the blood by which
[1:45:05] you are covered and identified in by his
[1:45:08] spirit if God be for us who can be
[1:45:10] against us he ever liveth to make
[1:45:13] intercession
[1:45:15] on our behalf the Rebbe said we don't
[1:45:18] plead for ourselves it's the Holy Ghost
[1:45:21] in us that pleads for us he gives an
[1:45:24] utterance he gets forth prayer it's him
[1:45:28] crying out an advocate brother Branham
[1:45:32] reads that scripture says and not for
[1:45:34] ours only but also for the sins of the
[1:45:38] whole world are we able to pray for
[1:45:43] other people when we see needs in their
[1:45:46] life maybe they've got situations that's
[1:45:49] come up in their life and you your path
[1:45:51] the way you cross them you cross their
[1:45:53] path and you realize it Lord they just
[1:45:56] need help right now most I'm you know
[1:45:58] they're not a believer they don't even
[1:45:59] go to church anywhere so does that stop
[1:46:02] you from praying for ho not you might be
[1:46:08] their only length if they've got and if
[1:46:10] God's brought that knee to your
[1:46:12] attention you're responsible to bring
[1:46:13] that before the throne of God when we
[1:46:16] can bring that before God's throne in
[1:46:18] intercession see it's not just
[1:46:20] interceding for one another's needs but
[1:46:23] the needs that we come across it might
[1:46:25] be a witness to that person that you can
[1:46:26] go back to them and say you know what
[1:46:28] we're lifting you up in prayer before
[1:46:30] the Saints with who does that be okay at
[1:46:31] our church and they might say sure I
[1:46:34] appreciate that they may maybe not
[1:46:35] understand it but then they themselves
[1:46:37] can get a little witness back as God
[1:46:39] would move for the need in their life
[1:46:41] don't get down because you never never
[1:46:43] seen sitting here it may not be that
[1:46:46] there are name to sit here but maybe
[1:46:49] that witness in their life has caused
[1:46:52] them to reach for what they are destined
[1:46:55] for and that was salvation Lord forgive
[1:46:58] me for my sins
[1:47:00] you see when we look at it down through
[1:47:02] time brother BAM tells us clearly like
[1:47:04] this he said if it's a Catholic man he
[1:47:07] said if he's trusting in the church for
[1:47:08] his salvation
[1:47:09] he's lost but he said if he's trusting
[1:47:12] in Jesus Christ that man is saved
[1:47:15] go horribie to God that don't bother me
[1:47:18] a bit that he saves others they don't
[1:47:21] bother me a bit that he saves others I'm
[1:47:24] glad because you know what
[1:47:26] he is a savior
[1:47:28] I know him as a savior I'm known as a
[1:47:30] redeemer I've said it a bunch of times
[1:47:33] if all I can do is fellowship with
[1:47:35] somebody and all they can fellowship
[1:47:36] about as a savior and I don't say that's
[1:47:38] all they can do
[1:47:39] I'll fellowship with you that he's a
[1:47:41] savior and we can see if God will open
[1:47:44] the door for a little bit more room but
[1:47:46] I do know he's a savior I'm not gonna
[1:47:49] beat somebody down because of what
[1:47:51] limited they know but I want to
[1:47:53] encourage him to live to your full
[1:47:55] potential amen and if God sees fit to
[1:48:00] open their eyes then that's in his hands
[1:48:04] may our lives live such a righteous life
[1:48:06] may we live as people with a burden may
[1:48:12] we live as people with a burden for
[1:48:14] instance does not get into where we come
[1:48:16] in to church and as soon as church is
[1:48:18] over we're just I'm not gonna preach on
[1:48:21] that tonight but let's have a birdie
[1:48:24] let's not get wrapped up in our own
[1:48:26] little world our own little problems
[1:48:28] let's have a burden realize that the
[1:48:32] devil the devil is stealing from you the
[1:48:33] joy stealing from being able to pray for
[1:48:36] one another I want people to pray for me
[1:48:39] I'll tell you one when I pray among most
[1:48:42] of my time is spent
[1:48:43] it's praying for other people it isn't
[1:48:45] just when I'm in time of prayer but
[1:48:47] there's time sometimes for the rail
[1:48:49] forget people's names I forget needs and
[1:48:51] sometimes it bothers me brother behind
[1:48:53] so Pascagoula I didn't mean to forget
[1:48:55] this but when he brings it to me I might
[1:48:57] be in a grocery store I said God you
[1:48:59] know if that made Lord forgive my feeble
[1:49:03] mind Lord I forgot Lord but minister
[1:49:06] I've told him I pray for him Lord and I
[1:49:09] didn't get it wrote down in time but
[1:49:13] let's let's be people with a burden
[1:49:17] because I'm telling you you're not going
[1:49:20] anywhere without me and I'm not going
[1:49:23] anywhere without you brother Samuel it's
[1:49:26] an individual fare I know that but this
[1:49:29] is a rapture in one astronaut the Lord
[1:49:33] Jesus Christ and I don't believe I'm
[1:49:35] preaching through a bunch of heathens
[1:49:37] I believe I'm preaching to believers
[1:49:39] I'm believe I'm preaching to sons and
[1:49:41] daughters of God I'm preaching what God
[1:49:44] has delivered for this generation and
[1:49:46] for this evening I'm preaching this
[1:49:49] because this is what father wants i dont
[1:49:53] preach things looking down the depot i
[1:49:55] preach this same gospel this word it's
[1:49:57] for this guy included right here I'm
[1:50:01] preaching to God's people I'm preaching
[1:50:04] to the purchase of his blood no malice
[1:50:09] pray Lord Jesus whoa God how we thank
[1:50:15] you tonight Lord that there is an
[1:50:17] intercessor on the floor how we thank
[1:50:20] you Lord God for the bloody lamb I would
[1:50:24] thank your Lord God as she revealed
[1:50:26] yourself Lord and continue to unfold
[1:50:29] yourself in this hour that you are our
[1:50:33] propitiation Lord God to think down
[1:50:37] through the ages the believers that's
[1:50:41] lived in every age the call has went out
[1:50:44] of them like it did in John even so Lord
[1:50:47] Jesus come they didn't know Lord God
[1:50:50] that it would be so many more years
[1:50:52] hundreds or a thousand or whatever more
[1:50:54] you they didn't know that but they lived
[1:50:56] every day they lived for your coming
[1:50:59] that's what Redemption did for them it
[1:51:02] calls them Lord to live their eyes above
[1:51:05] this world they were no longer trapped
[1:51:07] in just having ambitions nothing wrong
[1:51:12] Lord with having goals in this life but
[1:51:15] Lord God we don't ever want goals to be
[1:51:17] ahead of you
[1:51:18] there's one goal that we have one mark
[1:51:21] that we're pressing towards and that's
[1:51:24] the mark of the high calling of Jesus
[1:51:26] Christ our Lord
[1:51:28] our desire Lord God is to be delivered
[1:51:31] out of that second resurrection we don't
[1:51:34] want to be there in that second
[1:51:35] resurrection we want to be part of that
[1:51:37] first resurrection this is where Paul
[1:51:40] himself did not even live his life as
[1:51:42] though he was one who had already
[1:51:43] attained that he said I strive I seek to
[1:51:50] apprehend that which I'm not pretend
[1:51:53] enough he prayed for the saints of God
[1:51:57] many times in the opening letters
[1:52:00] philippians colossians thessalonians
[1:52:02] ephesians on and on it's mentioned
[1:52:05] prayer prayer for the people lord god I
[1:52:12] pray that we would stand not as that
[1:52:16] Pharisee we read about the Lord God if
[1:52:19] we see situations let us have that heart
[1:52:23] like the publican that can look and say
[1:52:26] Lord just as I need your mercy my
[1:52:30] brother and my sister needs your mercy

[1:52:54] us and us in it Lord God to where that
[1:52:57] love of God as you Lord would speak a
[1:53:00] new commandment that I ran unto you that
[1:53:01] you love one another even as I have
[1:53:03] loved you

[1:58:19] call out in intercession he never prayed
[1:58:23] and said Lord you know she reads so many
[1:58:26] chapters a day she listens to my tapes
[1:58:29] Lord that's not what he brought before
[1:58:31] your throne but he said Lord she's been
[1:58:35] good for me
[1:58:36] she stood between me in the public Lord
[1:58:39] she's fixed my meals Jesus she's ironed
[1:58:44] my clothes
[1:58:45] Lord he interceded on her behalf what
[1:58:51] she might have not thought anything

[1:58:57] servanthood she did her part o Lord let
[1:59:03] us not despise our parts Lord that we
[1:59:06] are called to play but we each and every
[1:59:09] one up to have a burden Lord God and
[1:59:13] father

[1:59:41] intercessory lives Lord government a
[1:59:44] hard war that intercedes who were God on
[1:59:48] behalf of one another not one of us Lord
[1:59:52] would just turn away our children if we
[1:59:54] seen him going wrong we would not turn a
[1:59:57] blind eye to it but we would pray and we
[2:00:01] would ask for your leadership we would
[2:00:03] seek toward God that you might give us
[2:00:06] words of wisdom that you might deal with
[2:00:09] them in the night that you might deal
[2:00:10] with them maybe through another brother
[2:00:12] another sister but Lord we know that it
[2:00:14] would have to be you whatever the
[2:00:17] channel would be that would be fine with
[2:00:19] us but what did you that we're asking
