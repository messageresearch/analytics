personal to where we're at presently amen we just so thank the Lord for his Mercy tonight and so glad to be able to be able to be gathered together and uh may God bless you I looked out the window at one point when I got back there from praying in here and I thought my goodness not again with the and I know that snow it's not like we're down south where you know if if they hear the word snow it's like oh my goodness what do we do you know but um um you know what I want to just say thank you and uh just being able to be here tonight and make it out tonight through through whatever you had to come come through to to get here and uh certainly I know between the deacons and myself we try to keep a watch on those things and we don't certainly don't want to force anything but I'm thankful that God makes a way we can come together aren't you amen amen and uh always want to remind you those some of some that live obviously almost half of the church live a great distance from here um but just always to use wisdom if we have service it means that it's okay to have it within this radius uh but you always have to use wisdom from where you're traveling from you know cuz I know some places over there near akan and then you can have places in sanduski you just have to use wisdom with where you're located and and um you know within it um so we'll we always try to keep a watch on that I want to say um I we I'd taken account and looked at those items that are out there on the table the addresses and birthdays anniversaries I've I've updated um updated that you'll see if you put any marks on there it's highlighted over that let you know that I've got that covered um and so if you haven't checked that out of your birthday anniversary please put that on there um we certainly would like to have it um also the telegram I think we're getting we're getting more and more people on and um so and I also know some some people I've talked to some brothers and sisters your your password is what what's kind of held you up and uh so you know we'll see what we can do there's I'll tell you what these these young ones and brother Brian I mean these I'm just happy I can do certain things on my iPad and on my computer I'm right there you know but these when I get into trouble that's when I I'll ask them hey how do you do this or sometimes I'll ask my boys I'll say Hey how do you do this I want to do this how do I do that but you know perhaps you can just see one of them maybe after service or um maybe at the fellowship dinner on Sunday um just I think it's so handy because we're able just to um put those things out there and uh we we did it purposely I explained this to you before just so you understand when you some of you the first time you see it you're like I can't respond to anything well on those threads you can't and the reason we did that is because you know how it is sometimes when respon say the message gets lost y uh I'm on threads like I said with ministers some here in the states some in the area some that are around the world hundreds and and all of a sudden you wonder what's what's everybody saying praise the Lord about what are they saying amen about and then you realize oh oh oh oh oh oh okay 2: a.m. in the morning this was sent from a brother in Uganda oh that that that's what they're talking about so we want to try to keep it so that it's not cuz everybody gets a lot of notifications I know that um we get and so that's what we've tried to do that just to keep it simple um that it's always before us the announcement and prayer request and um so thankful to hear that brother Shane regarding Brooks man look at him tonight he's right on point he's looking right at me I tell you man he's right on point I'm telling you that just that's just wonderful we so thank God for his mercies I I just really appreciated that so glad to see different ones amen that able to be in the house of the Lord let's just continue to keep one another in prayer amen we so appreciated this past weekend God was so good to us amen the things that you know it's just so wonderful as I said before there's to me it's so beautiful God's Great bouquet and um you know God has such a way that uh and and I CU I believe in that I believe we need all parts of the five-fold ministry we you know we we might have certain preferences but we we what we want is is Lord I want to always see you whatever vessel you're using I I want to I want to be to that level of a I want to I want to become a mature son and daughter of God that I'm not looking at the vessel and say oh this that's a little bit different in Ministry I want to be mature enough to say God help me to see you because this is a vessel that there's a gift in there but I'm I'm depending on seeing you you know my needs so Lord take that vessel and just speak to my heart and I'll tell you it's abs absolutely beautiful how God takes the different gifts that he's placed in the body and I I tell you I'm just I'm just so thankful to be a part of the body of Jesus Christ I'm thankful to see how God uses the gifts in the body because what what you see what rejoices my heart is not only have I been blessed but the church we've been edified we've been helped and that to me is that's that's that's what it's all about amen don't you love the Lord tonight amen let's just stand and I'm probably going to read from a scripture I'm not probably I am and I've never preached from this scripture that I can ever recall from in my life and you're probably thinking what could that possibly be it's a scripture we refer to many times but it's a scripture that I've never just taken a text upon and ministered from it but looking at the Book of Job where we have been drawing inspiration from that of job 26 and remember we were looking at the aspects of how that um the attribute and the display of Savior and how God worked through men down through the Old Testament and it was not the man that was the Savior but it was the word of God but a Man became surrendered God used prophets God God still uses Ministry God sent has a prophet as he sent in this hour God still has lives and you and I in our lives as we're surrendered to the Lord can actually be used to be able for God to minister even that attribute to bring help to bring uh Salvation to someone else not our words but his word because our words will fail but his words can't fail and so we just want to be channels that's what Jesus when he told the disciples he said when you go and Terry in Jerusalem and when you be indued with power from on high then shall you be Witnesses unto me and that's that's where we're at is we want to be with all of our hearts God true Witnesses and that true expression through our life so I want to read here this this scripture out of Ecclesiastes chapter 11 and verse verse one cast thy bread upon the waters for Thou shalt find it after many days give a portion to seven and also to eight for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the Earth if the clouds be full of rain they empty themselves upon the Earth and if the tree fall toward the South or toward the North in the place where the tree falleth there it shall be he that observe the wind shall not swow and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap as thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit nor or how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all in the morning sow thy seed and in the evening withhold not thine hand for thou knowest not whether not and whether shall prosper either this or that or whether they shall both be alike good the scripture goes on to say truly the light is sweet and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to be behold the son but if a man live many years and rejoice in them all yet let him remember the days of darkness for they shall be many all that cometh is Vanity now watch the last part of this scripture here as well Rejoice oh young man in thy Youth and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy Youth and walk in the ways of thine heart and in the sight of thine eyes but know thou that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment therefore remove sorrow from thy heart and put away evil from thy flesh for childhood and youth and youth are vanity i' just like to speak here if the Lord would help us a few moments of casting thy bread on troubled human Waters let's just pray Heavenly Father Lord Jesus how thank thankful we are for your mercies tonight Lord Lord Jesus knowing that Lord as we are standing Lord in need of your grace once again that you would just come Among Us Lord in a very special way father as your children Lord and have gathered out here tonight Lord sacrifices that has been made Lord and father to be able to gather together Lord not to be seen oh how we love to be able to see one another how it encourage enes our hearts Lord just to be able to look and see brothers and sisters of like Precious Faith but Lord as we've come to this place Lord God that father Our Lives Lord that we might be examined by the word of God and that we might Lord take father of that word for the needs that are present Lord in our lives Lord those needs that God that are so right before us and other needs Lord that you can see that would be so fitted and necessary to be dealt with Lord and moved upon in our lives would you help us Lord give us the grace that father we might be able to see as we look into the word the way that you would want us to see Lord and may your spirit just move Among Us Lord to change us I pray oh God and Lord make us more like you father give us Lord I pray father this day our daily bread Lord God may you just Lord move Among Us in a very special way tonight Lord speak to our hearts Lord I pray as Only You Can Do Lord we just commit ourselves into your hands Lord and ask that you would forgive us if there's anything Lord that we have said or we've done Lord that would have been displeasing to you in any way help us father that Lord Our Lives Lord might be fitted and pleasing to you we commit this service into your hands and ask that every single need Lord would be met for your honor and glory in Jesus precious name amen amen God bless BL you as you're being seated I want you to think back to that scripture as we looking at it and as we were referring that there in the Book of Job of job 26 of where job had asked of those Brethren that had come to him how savest thou him that has no strength and him giving might to him that ha no power and to know that here that you know the Brethren as we were talking and as they had come to job they had every good intention but yet they lacked the discernment and you know there's things that within all of walks in our life there's many needs that's Among Us there's many needs of individuals that we rub shoulders with on a daily basis there's lives and sometimes that we can look at and see that maybe perhaps on the outside they are smiling but yet on the inside there's so much torment and turmoil that is taking place you got to remember we're living in a time in an age that where the Bible said men's Hearts would be failing for fear there's there's such such anxiousness depression and and fear that's upon the people and realizing that where we are standing we are standing at the point of the coming of the Lord we're here there we're we're were here standing at the end time these things were prophesied to be and yet we see so many effect effects and so many things that actually lend itself and lead to this to where that you find things where lives are so bogged down with spirits and oppression and so many other things and we know that even in this hour that we're living in and we think about you know these Dimensions we live in the first three dimensions but in that fourth dimension itself and to think about even how that's where television waves come through that's where even the waves like of this wireless microphone that's through a cell phone and all those different things come through their internet all those things and yet we're finding here even in the time that you and I are living in of when we look sometimes at individuals and people and whether and it's not just middle AG it's not just young people or older people it's people of all ages and it's amazing and astounding sometimes of the things that you can find that's so present among the young people and it's not just something that has just come or Fallen right out of the air we realize that there are so many things that's happening even right through that fourth dimension there there is such a such right now even with things through the internet and so so so many different things in that way you realize that the Bible tells us because we're living in a time it told us that as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man that's right then it also said as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the coming of the son of man so within those two things that the Lord Jesus Jesus would be mindful to point out it when remember lot was called out Noah was taken in so there's a coming out of and there's a going in but in the days of Noah the Bible said of how that the Earth itself was filled with violence through them there were lives and individuals in that moment in time that had been able to come under such an influence of demonic spirits such evil such wickedness that was that was around now I want you to understand this sometimes the evil and the wickedness it can be so much compartmentalized but let me just tell you something the evil and the wickedness that would even have been in the days of Noah would have been even that of religious Spirits because religious spirits that would have come and gathered around the ark would have waited would have criticized Noah would have you know torn it all there is nothing to this man and this message that we've got to come and get into this Ark but I'll tell you if they wanted to be safe they had to get into the ark they had to come under that word if not they would not withstand the waters that was going to come upon the earth I want to remind you there's also spoken of in the Book of Revelations of where it speaks of the great that sets upon that of the thickness and the multitudes of people or upon the waters and to see the effects and and we're not ignorant to know exactly of what of what that is we understand it's that Roman Catholic system that is so permeated down through the time and the ages and sure there's been daughters and so forth that's come out of there but you see the effects of it that all throughout the world and and where we're at there people are so religious it Marvels me even in the time that we're living in that you can't even even watch or look at a politician without them saying one thing blessing the name of Jesus and then a curse word going out of their mouth at the same time it it shows you the desensitizing that has taking place and that is religion religion will never take the place of true salvation religion is only a covering that covers where the actual need really is that's what took place in the Garden of Eden is it not when the ACT had taken place in the Garden of Eden it wasn't an apple we understand that there was an act that took place in the Garden of Eden and where did they cover they covered where the ACT had taken place they didn't just go and grab any leaves that was laying around they would if they did they would have grabbed some of the biggest leaves they could get a hold of but they grabbed fig leaves because fig leaves it speaks of seeds within are you with me multiple seeds within here we are living in in an hour in a time where there's such troubling among Humanity I mean I I pray God help us to be sensitive to lives and hearts cuz we do not know when we look at all of the seed we do not know who is seed who's not I I to me I'm not worried about that I just pray God help me to shine the light let my light be a help or an encouragement to someone else you might say brother Samuel they might never darken these doors that is not going to stop me from shining the light to encourage and help another human being along life's way Hallelujah Hey listen if God thought enough that he would allow men to tap in to certain things with medicine surgeries and other things knowing because there'd be people that would not believe in Divine Healing and God would be so loving and merciful that he would so arrange that it's not those men that heal it's not a surgery that heals it's God who is the Healer life is the Healer in the body but God in his love would be so mindful to move for those needs in humanity how much more you and I that's right amen now when we think of this this Troubled Waters all around us H it's just it's amazing of the of the time than here of where that we are living in and to understand casting thy bread I want you to know this it's not just casting bread but it's thy bread upon the waters what is bread bread is the staff of life is that right right the children of Israel were sustained by the Mana that came down from above is that right but then here stood the the ACT actual antitype or the Perfection or him who could declare I am that true bread from Heaven he he was not discrediting the Mana he sent the Mana but the Mana was only a type of him to where that there would come a true sustainment into the very heart of man that would sustain man that would give you and I the strength to live above sin through him by a true relationship where the bread of life himself has come down and surrendered his life that he himself might impart his life into you and I that we can have strength that we can live more abundantly it's the bread of life that's among us this is why that even in the evening time God promised there would be light in the evening time God promised there would be bread in the evening time even when we in ourselves would would pray and admonish give us this day Our Daily Bread we we we need a continual uh filling of the spirit of God not that we lose it because once you're sealed you cannot become unsealed but when you've ever been sealed but we realize that within it God I need more I I need I need that bread I need that Revelation to guide and direct my life I want more of him give us this day our daily bread hallelujah we're not Beggars we're not strangers we are Sons and Daughters of God that have been purchased by the blood of the lamb and the spirit of God has brought that reality to you and I that I was always a son and daughter of God clear back from the mind of God I always belonged to him and he came and sought me out I was not seeking for him it was him that came and sought me out you know what that is that that ought to create a faith in our to know there is one who loved me and that kind of a love that has been bestowed upon me I I want to serve him with all my heart Lord with all my life you sought me out Lord casting thy bread thy bread I want you to understand once you you have received that bread that life that word remember when we stand here and here we are and we take that communion we take it in symol as Paul gave it remember Paul caught by Revelation he takes us back to the Last Supper Paul wasn't even there but being a prophet of God he sees that last supper and he breaks it out I have received of the Lord and he takes these very symbols and shows of what that is of the wine of what it's to represent it's to represent the blood of Jesus Christ it's to represent inside of that wine there there there is a power of stimulation there is an authority to divorce and remove sin and to cleanse the life there is a power within it and it's a fellowship amen and then the bread that bread has it's been broken and that bread his body his body he was he was he was he was crucified here here his side was opened and to think that body that bread it represents the body of Jesus Christ by the indwelling of his own life it represents this is why that in our lives this is the same thing that when Abraham met MDC he gave him Bread and Wine he gave him what was needed after he overcame that's what happened in Acts 2 it was the coming of the spirit of God the same one that meant Abraham gave them what they needed Bread and Wine he gave them the holy spirit because the Holy Spirit and the word are not two separate things it is one and the same yes sir that's why when we are born of the word we are born of the spirit we are born of the water and of the spirit amen gives us the strength that we have need of so then in our lives we are living by the bread of God that's so good that's so good we're living by his bread yes that's a living bread Our Lives display this is a living bread it this is not this is not like the Mana that fell remember it it fell and they were required to go and get it but they could go out there and they could get that mana and they were told don't keep more than what you're going to eat after you get done make sure you burn it is that right why because it would contaminate with maggots now I want you to think of this yet they they were commanded Moses was commanded or told Aaron go and take and fill a golden r with that Mana that fell on the first day and put it into the holiest of holies the same Mana oh my but that Mana never got maggots in it that's right never corrupted you know why it just shows when the holy spirit makes its way beyond their mind beyond their spirit and it comes into that abod that God has serve for himself in the soul and our Nature has been changed the Holy Ghost will never depart from our lives it's a seal it's a seal we are held there by the Seal of the Living God oh glory be to God that's an anchor friends you see this is why when the bread is revealed and ministered it brings a certainty and a real positivity to the heart of the believer that is born of that word because what you are resting in is not your own works it's not your own Merit but you're resting in the redeeming work of the blood of the Lamb that you see working in your own life sir and that's where your rest is at and through our rest then becomes the reflection in our lives so bread itself is a staff of life I want you to think of this this brother Brown preaches a message here called Mother's Day and I want you to listen to what he says here he says oh the resurrection means a lot to me I'm anticipating on that great crowning hour aren't you I'm looking forward to it and then as the light begins to spr spread forth we'll know as we're known we'll understand we'll remember our acquaintance and the ones that's been there remember remember when they were on Mount Transfiguration they knew who Moses and Elijah was is that right they they they nobody had to tell them or to try to get pictures to prove it they under the the prophet says it like this under that inspiration he said when that morning breaks you recognize your mother Hallelujah you recognize your loved ones that's gone on before some of you that lost children or grandchildren before they ever came to the age of maturity on that Resurrection morning you will recognize them why because they are a part of that word and it's that word in you and the in insiration of the Holy Spirit to bring that realization oh what a what a what a day we have to look forward to what a moment watch this this I I want just just to take I want you just to draw encouragement from this the prophet says it like this he says there'll be many there that we didn't even think would be there you know it's at that time I believe the bread that we have cast upon the human Troubled Waters will return to us on that day when we see the effects of Our Testimony on people that we didn't understand their action towards it will probably be there what a day amen that will bejah Hallelujah so we don't understand their action towards it you know what it's saying the scripture is saying that even their action don't judge their action for it amen just our responsibility is to shine the light oh my you know what friends that rejoices my heart to recognize and realize that there will be lives that our testimony by God's grace has touched and maybe they were a little offended put out with it maybe they were a little indifferent but the grace of God in our lives it walked on with the love of God and you know what was left they might have disagreed with the word why because of what they have been taught y right right not because they wanted to but because of what they've been taught but let me remind you love the love of God is greater and able to dismantle every ounce of hardness it's able to overthrow every bit of bitterness and Malice and enmity the love of God is greater no wonder the songwriter said oh love of God how rich and pure how measureless and strong Glory Hallelujah casting our bread upon trouble water it's not my responsibility what comes out of but God our testimony before others when you'll see others on that day and they were standing there and we in our mind the last Reckoning that we had is oh my the way they were going but you don't know what took place between that time that we spoke that we've lived and then when they stand there oh my I'm just going to say with I'm going to say it like this I want to take everybody with me that God's intended and you know what God had asked me to sort sort people out God hadn't asked me to do that he said son just cast The Net just cast The Net even the disciples wanted to sort out the tears and and move this and move that he said don't do it lest uprooting the tears you'll destroy the wheat Let It Grow and in Harvest it'll declare itself it'll be gathered notice he goes on to say here in this he says and then the seeds that we've SED not even thinking what they would do but here they are yes they are they brought forth precious F fruits and we'll see them on that day the Wayward loved ones and relatives that scripture believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thy and thy house shall be saved Isaiah 6365 they and their offspring shall be there with them it does not matter how Wayward they might be right now remember God's grace is greater than their waywardness you and I were Wayward at one time let's just put it this way the reason that we see what we see where we are where we are is for such a time as this everywhere you look at the scripture when the Revelation struck Abraham he became an intercessor is that right Revelation Struck it could struck struck Moses he was an intercessor amongst the wrong of the people intercessor Esther as in the wrong that was taking place everything she became an intercessor and that's what the spirit of Jesus Christ is even in you and I right now it's the right kind of a mediator that it ministers within you and I to be able to say Lord forgive them they don't know what they're doing they didn't mean to say it that way father that's right they they they don't they don't know any better but Lord God give us Grace give me Grace Lord let my heart be that much more sweetened that what will be left and impressed upon them will not necessarily be that they remember all the words that I've said but Let It Be You Let It Be You Let It Be You Lord because after all that's what it's about it's about him that's that's what it's really about all the preaching all the word all the sharing all the testimony all the witnessing it's about one thing it's about getting people to the Lord Jesus Christ that they might see him and know him in a personal relationship that's Hallelujah so here you know it's the it's the bread I want to just say it's the bread of Our Testimony right I won't ask you to raise your hands but there's no doubt all throughout this congregation those that would be streaming sometimes you get discouraged sometimes you look look around it's true that's what it burdens our heart when you see the condition of the world I I'm not praying that America turn around she's she send away her day of Grace that's right that's right do I do I do do I pray I I pray for others I pray for I pray for you know our local uh establishments our you know policemen and other things like that I'm instructed to by the word of God in first Timothy is that right right but but we understand how to pray I'm not praying for everything to turn around and oh God's going to send a Revival God has sent a Revival by his word through his Spirit remember if God's going to send a Revival David was moved and said I want to see a Revival but David went to the captains of thousands about bringing back the ark and when he went that way there was a man who died they put it on a new cart but there's one if there's a sure way if Revival Revival comes by the word because anything other than that is just it just becomes a workup where lives it's only a period of time but listen the word brings a change brother and sister this is why when David was instructed he had to go to Nathan and Nathan was the prophet on the scene at that hour and he instructed him take it off that new cart and get it over where it belongs over over the hearts of the Levites and bring it back into its position the word could not come back into its position without the word giving the direction it must be over the heart now let me tell you every real Revival in your life in my life in our home it starts with a word in our life it's a word that brings Revival I thank God for songs I thank God for music but it's not songs that bring Revival it's not I love worship because we've got something to worship about Hey listen we're living in the time of where the lamb has been revealed in Revelations 5 and worship is set before the children of God I'm thankful to see myself in the book I'm thankful to see that the lamb has overcome I'm thankful to see the clearness of Victory but to realize our worship is because of the word and where we see ourself in the word so it's a word that brings Revival and God's has sent his word as he promised right is that right and so God sending his word and I want you to think of it that it's the bread of Our Testimony our life that's lived cuz you know there's a lot of things there's when we talk about lives and hearts getting discouraged let me just say it to you like this it isn't we don't know sometimes how how far a person could go you can look at and say Well they're not doing nothing and their backslid and their this and they that listen don't ever write nobody off cuz let me just tell you something right now when when when when when that's already in your heart you need to get back to the Altar and I'm not saying you need to get saved again but I'm I'm saying you need to meet God and say Lord I need a refreshing because let me tell you there's human Troubled Waters right now there's light now let me just say this to you there's nothing that's too great for our God nothing all the round through here in this in this building just with what what is here tonight there are lives that are testimonies and trophies of God's Redeeming Grace there's enough we could go throughout this building and to be able to declare testimony after testimony that our God is more than enough that's right that's right but in the midst of times when we get weary you know the Bible tells us to it tells us of how that even in our lives it says that let me just skip down to this it tells us that don't don't be don't be deceived God's not mock it tells us to seow The Good Seed and it tells us I want you just to really focus in on on on verse n let us not be weary in wello doing in other words don't get to a place to where you just think there ain't nothing I'm doing that's making a difference it's not you it's not you that's making a difference it's what's In Your Vessel it's the bread it's the bread in your life that's giving you strength it's the bread that has through your life it's an example and that bread is being cast out on troubled human Waters Hallelujah that's only Satan's tactic to try to get you to draw back and you think man there ain't nothing being effective here I might as well quit doing this and I might as well quit reaching out I might as well you know quit trying to text or I might as well quit trying to witness her no that's only Satan that's right trying to cool you off be not weary in well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not yes it is true that we need refreshing from the presence of the Lord it is true we need to be uh reminded and and refilling upon refilling of the spirit of God that is absolutely true because we in our human humanness and Humanity as best as we try we in our Humanity can become discouraged by what we see but I want you to remember faith is not only for when you're going through a disease right or a sickness but it's when things look like they're going the opposite way we walk not by sight but by faith when you maybe see a loved one going a certain way or you see a brother or sister maybe somebody getting you look and say Well they're may be getting a little cold or a little LAX don't write nobody off but pray for them even the more so and say God if whether it be me or somebody else let me Lord God in the middle of that moment Lord give me the grace to be able to reach out to him let me go backwards here BR says it like this he talking about it your little bark meaning your little boat like G like the Lord Jesus was in as you're sailing on life solemn seed testify sing or pray like bread upon the Water it'll Return To You Someday speak a little word for Jesus do something testify sing pray do something for him while you're s failing over life Soloman all right listen all the accolades we could accomplish in human life that doesn't mean one thing if our life has not been spent for him that's the only thing that's going to matter on the other side that's right even when we stand there before the Judgment seat of Christ not the white Throne because we won't stand before the white Throne under the blood sealed by the spirit of God we're not we're not going to be part of the white Throne remember we are standing by his side as a wife is standing there but the Judgment seat is that's a part where we give account for the Deeds that's done in the body and these are things that when we look at it in our life Lord when it all is said and done look I just want you to understand I've said it many times before I'm not trying to get accolades and rewards I just love him whatever he wants me to do I I don't care how it compares to somebody else I just want to do what he wants me to do it it may never be known man I I don't care as long as I can do something for him that that's all he's did everything for me he did for me what nobody else could do and not just one time but again and again he's been so faithful the least little thing Lord that I can do notice a forlorn and Shipwrecked brother in seeing shall take heart again said Long Fellow yes while we're sailing life solom man let's give our testimony let's do something that will leave footprints on the sands of time footprints that perhaps another yes a forlorn and Shipwrecked brother seeing what we did will take heart again and make another try he seen where somebody was pouring it out he made a try and stood on the Promises of Christ and become a soldier of the Cross let's make Footprints who knows the footprints that you live leave behind through the expression of your life you might say well I'm not a martyr like they were back then but I want you to understand the same kind of life that polycarp lived and all the rest of them lived they lived it by the spirit of the Living God they responded to the anointing of God that was upon them in that hour to surrender their lives right is that right and the same spirit of God the remember Paul said not not not only for me shall there be a crown of life but for all them who love his appearing right his appearing him making himself his word alive right now in our midst that it's undeniable it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever The Works that I do shall you do also the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ we shall receive a crown a crown what I'm not interested in a Golden Crown but it's a Crown of Life another body a new body Paul wrote of it a body that reserved in the heavens Peter said it's one who's undefiled in the heavens right it's a body that is reserved in the heavens a theophany a word body there you go it's reserved amen oh I tell you what I'm looking forward to the day when not only this body right here this terrestrial will be changed but but I'm looking forward to when I'll no longer have that human Spirit but it'll be theophany glory be to God aren't you looking forward to that we don't go and become Angels those that die and slip on that pass on in the presence of God they don't become Angels they move into that Heavenly Body that theophany just as real more real than what we are right here tonight is that right amen that's exactly remember they saw when Samuel came up remember even standing on Mount Transfiguration on and on that we could go but notice will'll take heart again somebody's seen your life in my life this is this is really my prayer God let my life and let the lives of every one of us be a life that somebody that is backslid that is Shipwrecked maybe their life is a mess that it would look like it's easier to untangle fishing line than their life to be straightened out but nothing's too great for God there is nothing that is beyond the blood of Jesus Christ nothing oh God let our life let our testimony Let It Be how this is displayed that others that maybe have been Shipwrecked that there can be a display of something of that impression in their mind and in their heart to give them courage to say I'll rise and try again it may not be where maybe you or I or somebody has has prayed for somebody else it might simply be with someone taking notice of how you interact with your family how you interact with one anothers how even when the boss has laid everything on you that he can lay oh yeah and another one that you're not even aware of is watching your life cuz we are an influence yes we are we are an influence somebody is watching our life but where they can be able to look at that and say my Lord the way he or she has taken that that's more that's more than human human human strength but it be something that's so real that it maybe the rest of the people in the plant or the office or work walk right by it but there's something about it it catches their attention and would give them strength to rise up and say Lord I'm going to trust you amen I'm going to trust you what what you are and my brother my sister what you are Lord be that way in me maybe they won't be asking God about strength to just you know be able to be sweet and responsive back to the boss they might be asking God Lord help me to overcome these habits in my life help me Lord God to clean out the things in my life the things that are hindering me Lord God but through that very thing right there they can look and know that God is alive and real sir just cast cast thy bread upon the waters it'll return that is so good it'll return Yes you know brother Braham talks about a sister and I don't know what ever happened with her but he talks about how that she would make clothes for you know sister mey when you know she was you know poor and there were you know just she was just a little girl and how that this this this lady and this is what I want you to catch brother Brown would talk about how that here she was brother BR talks about how that she had baxin she lived just right down from the church BR said I used to see her dance in the church he said man I'd see her shout under the spirit of God just shout under the power of God he said but she she got away she she back and he said but every time she would see me on the street she would run and grab my hand brother Bram pray for me you see it wasn't shut out wasn't closed off you see she knew let me let me say this friends we know there's a time for a word to be given sometimes there's moments where I have found where there is times where God will give a word of admonition or a correction but God gives us the wisdom for what to do at the moment where was this individual at they themselves were backsliding no doubt they did not know how to get out of that trap that they were in but they had enough confidence and knew that I have not been closed off from the body I've not been excommunicated Hallelujah and they could run to pray for me she came it came a time in the hospital she sent for him God ministered to her heart I want you to think of this here in the time we're living in Isaiah chapter 14 where it speaks of how in the scriptures of how that Satan himself Lucifer in Isaiah 14 how are there fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which didst weaken the Nations for thou has said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven and I will exalt my throne above the stars of God his desire I will sit on the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high yet Thou shalt be brought down to Hell to the sides of the pit to exalt his throne to be worshiped above the stars of God that phrase stars of God means messiah's Brothers to understand how Satan Here Wanting and placing himself to in a way be able to detour worship to himself and really to understand that within our lives if we if we just you know sometimes we we get away and and sometimes we don't remember just how far God has brought us because we can look sometimes at situations and I want you to remember you weren't schooled into this you're not schooled if you're schooled into anything you can be schooled out of it right amen but it takes the spirit of God to come around over our lives to break the darkness that was around our lives that's why the prophet said I would have served the Lord at a much younger age but there was a spirit that hung around me that kept telling me wait a little longer wait a little longer wait a little longer wait a little longer true but finally that Spirit was broken I want you to think of this here out of works of Faith expressed and I want you to think of this here out of this part and I want you to think of it in this term I want you is go through some things I want you to think about that on the display of the name of Jesus Christ how many believe that's what we're called to to display the name of the Lord Jesus Christ there's no other greater name than the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now notice this when it speaks in works as Faith expressed brother R talks about having a dream he says I don't dream very often I'm not a dreamer I dream that I seen a man a young fellow in shackles and he was trying to get out now watch this somebody told me those are horrible people don't have nothing to do with them and I seen this young fellow getting out of his sa shackle so I just let him alone and I thought I'll just see what he does so when he got out he was a nice fellow and I've seen others trying to get out now notice in this dream that he had he sees a young man that is in shackles and there are others around him in the dream that said those are horrible people but when this young man he noticed when this young man got out of these shackles he thought I'm going to see how this young man acts and when he got out from under the shackles he was a nice fellow you see sometimes you begin to realize some things that are called personality are not personality they're demons that's true they're spirits that is there but notice when the shackle is broken what that young man really was can actually be able to display itself that's what Paul said we were dead in sin and trespasses we walked according to the prince and power of the air but God rich in Mercy who loved us that while we were dead in our sins right aren't you glad for that I want you to watch how how he goes on brother ra talking about within this dream you know he's seen brother borders and seen others of them and they're just brother you know brother B saying brother Bram I just can't grasp what's going on I want you just to listen this very carefully he said they they spoke to him even even a certain lady who used to help him so much there you know she said brother Deliver Us from this talking about these iron bars this is a house of hell you've been misunderstood and you misunderstood these people too did you catch that yeah you've been misunderstood and you have misunderstood these people too these are fine people and I looked over there in a great big Cellar big walls down beneath a great big cave great iron bars 8 or 10 in thick and people out of their mind Twisted arms and legs beating their head like that crying deliver the people brother randam help us we're in trouble he said I looked around and I said I wish I could and he says go on and looking around and my this little bitty body and I looked at he looked at himself his little itty bitty body and all he could look at and says no way I I can't get him them irons them IR bars are sitting too close together then and how the people are so out of their mind but notice how that when you look at it brother R says when he looked he seen some flick lights flickering around in there I want you to notice the lights that were there over the in the Sals there were lights flickering in there but there was people who was bound up bound but there was lights God let him see there are lights flickering in there and I looked up and there stood the Lord Jesus with lights of rainbow around him he was looking right straight to me and said deliver those people and I thought how could I deliver them I haven't got strength enough in my arms to break those bars so I said House of Hell give way Amen to the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah notice these people were fine people yes but in that condition in that condition you see there's so much that we can apply here you seen it sometimes as you you know throughout the years and times like that whether it may be even working with children are working with others and things like that sometimes you can look at the things that you can see and you'll look at it and when you when you see it got it's recognizing that sometimes there's things you what you're what you're dealing with is a spirit and what what what what is so important is to be able to separate the person from the spirit because the spirits the spirit what it wants to do is draw you or I out into a battle and every time we leave from behind that word we are always going to be defeated but if standing right there with that word I want you to notice this cuz we could read right over this quote and just just keep on going but I I want you to notice where we're drawing from this house of Hell give way to the name of Jesus Christ there is nothing as powerful as the name of Jesus Christ amen you know when we have been repented of our sins been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of our sins and to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost we have been baptized into the very person of Jesus Christ into the word into that life into that domain into him where his life is dwelling in us and we are dwelling in him and this is why when brother bradam when he was asked and that one man told Brother Bram said brother Bram I don't think you got to call it don't matter calling a name over anybody when you baptize them he said you know my my wife he said said you know he said every time you know she sweeps the broom or the house she don't say you know in in the name of of brother Jones brother Braham said he said but you didn't just run out there on the street and say come here Mrs Jones you had to go through a ceremony oh there you go and you went through a ceremony and then she became your wife right then everything she does from that point on she does it in your name Hallelujah and that's within our life this is the power friends it ain't about that we can stomp or how loud or whatever more let me just tell you something your constant belief and faith in the word of God can send Devils flying Hallelujah it can break holds let me just tell you something it can break holds in your home it can break holds that are around your children children you know you're giving yourself to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ giving yourself to that character giving yourself to his word you realize it it can bring it can cause things that have been a separating point to Bow its knee I don't have time to read the rest of these scriptures but you can read in Colossians 3 everything you do in word or deed do it all in the name of Jesus Christ but notice what it said the scripture before that maybe I will read that notice what it said said before that let the word of Christ dwell in you richly you there's got to be virtue there's got to be strength there's got to be something that can be given out in that time is that right you've got to dwell let it dwell in you to dwell in us let it become the influence of our life so that it becomes Christ in us that is the impression on others not that they're impressed by us but it's a life it's his presence is so good that's what Philippians 2 I I don't have time to read that but that's what Philippians 2 as it comes from as well you know because we can leave we can leave that there and I'm not going to read it but we can leave that there Philippians 2611 and we can understand that what brought that Victory and that authority to where that that name is above every other name and every devil has to bow that character and that life was produced and through humility to the word of God he learned obedience by the things he suffered and through submitting that walk in that life you know why he did that so that he could understand you and I he didn't only come down to redeem us but while he walked here that he might be able to be the right kind of a mediator in you and I when it's hard sometimes and it's hard to submit to the word we can say Lord give me Grace Lord show me Lord teach me Lord cuz he knows what it is he knows what it is he learned obedience through the things that he suffered but look at the effect of it look what he went through where he sacrificed his own will what did it bring where every demon there's not a name Heaven Earth beneath the Earth nothing that won't bow at the name of Jesus Christ if we can look at this in the right way and I could just put a picture of you up there put a picture of me up there it's daily living in submission to the word of God it breaks the holes it takes down it dismantles House of Hell let me tell you sisters there's things can I just say it like this I want to say God bless you sisters walking you you know there's things for brothers we we can walk around well there's there's business men that dress like what I'm dressed like there's other guys that wear jeans and flannels and boots you know but sisters here you are walking and your hair right flowing true you know because remember long hair is uncut hair is Flowing your life you're not adorned up with the things of the world and and they see you to here you are veiled oh it's a reproach I know you bear a reproach that many times at the brothers we we don't you know we don't we don't we don't bear that to that degree but I want to say what what a blessing it is to Bear the reproach for him what a blessing that is what a what a privilege that is to be under the authority of the word of God Amen you know you know you understand I you know I don't know how many times there's we could just stop right here and I could ask sisters to come up here and give testimony of life sometimes individuals that's come and set in this church they might have only set for one service but they came because of the testimony they saw in one of our sisters they would see their life and say where is it that you go maybe even they poked fun at you and then they'll see where you go see it become everything becomes you know what it is listen those people don't mean to be in that way that's how they're taught they're taught do you understand what that is that's Spirits yes it it's Spirits that's got in there enticing spirits to lead people from the word of God Satan doesn't care what he has to do as long as he can prevent relationship that's that's what he wants that's why that he that he sent his Doctrine from the pits of Hell on the Trinity is to break that even that a a picture of a relationship God above us God With Us God in us hallelujah that's so good it's to break that reality that the purpose of God himself coming down tabernacling deity in a body of Flesh for Redemption is that through and through that shed blood he might come and Tabernacle inside of a body of Believers he becomes the example yes he does are you hearing me yes the Lord Jesus becomes the example of what God intended every son and daughter of God to be aren't you thankful for that that's a clear picture it doesn't put the Lord Jesus out here as something of well I'll never be able to obtain to a Victorious life but it's having that that Victorious Life that defeated every principality that rose on that Easter morning that same one that ascended up and now has returned back in the form of the Holy Ghost it say that same quickening power I want you to think of this yes sir that's good his glory being revealed in our lives brother Brown would tell us like this in the adoption series and I want you to think about this he talked about how he said to when he was in there for that physical he said I witnessed he said I told everyone he said that I could every doctor and every nurse I could I testified about having the Holy Ghost and asking if they had been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ brother BR he goes he just encouraged he said he said tell him about it he said because we ain't got much time and he said you think it seems hard here to tell somebody wait till you cross on the other side and you'll be wishing oh I wish I would have I wish I'd have went a little bit more now it's not talking about notice I think we we have enough wisdom on here right here that you know when there's times and opportunities even as you test it and just say getting the Lord good let me tell you there's a lot in this community that I can go around and you know some I can say God bless you they like God they like the blessing of God there you go brother Isaiah Brooke was one that told me that he said they like they like they like to hear God bless you so I can see them I I don't know where they're Christian I say God well God bless you God bless you honey okay now now let's see let's see where it goes from there right let's see where it goes from there I mean that I I mean that I want God to bless his children yes and to know we don't know where it's going to go I'm not here trying to make people see this word but if there ordains of life I'm not getting out of here till that last one comes in I'm not getting out of here till that last one comes in no sir I I I want to come listen I know what he did for me I know how he changed my life I know he did what everybody else had wrote off on Sam Browning but I know what he did for me I know what he's done throughout this congregation oh my we don't we don't know cast thy bread upon the waters yeah oh my brother BR said oh he said they might disagree with you and fume fume and fuss a little bit but they don't mean it they really don't mean it if they go to fussing they don't mean it it's just by what they've been taught but just love them right into it pray for them oh God you see friend this is where we need the strength of the Lord It Isn't So Much many times the strength of the Lord to be able to First be able to talk to someone and to to express ourselves sometimes there is that element of it depend on how we're made up and things like that and sometimes you know it depend you know a lot of different factors but my my point is within this is that when we look at this let us remember it's not it's not up to you it's not up to me to make anybody a Believer that's in God's hands right and you know the moment that we can just rest within that it's like it's like in our lives anybody ever been stressed before wow you guys have wow man you ever been to a place you get stressed in your chest oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah I remember some of the first years when I when I started teaching and man I you know you're trying to just sort your way out you know they tell you the first three years in anything is you're trying to find your feet and I remember man the first year my goodness and my dad had just had open heart surgery here I was Brother Ray sitting in my classroom man I was I was having pains right here and immediately pains going down the left side oh man and here I am and all these are things come on now those thoughts come and things like that and I'm sitting there and that pain was real I thought what is that and what that was was stress sometimes tense anxiousness many things of life that can come and to think that how that that sometimes that tenseness of where we come and we can feel like I I I've just I I've got to say it that's not what brother Brandon was doing when he was testify he wasn't up tense it was just his love with the Lord it just it just overflowed if we're going to sit down and talk and any time along oh sure we might be able to sit around talk about hunting and things like that and maybe if I see somebody you're somebody that you know likes you know some team or something like that maybe I can I remember somebody that can talk you know hey this this this but we going to get around long enough he's the love of my life absolutely he's a love of my life abely we get around long enough and you know what it ain't something that we have to force how many know what I'm talking about you don't have to force it he's the love of our life so what I'm saying is that those things where it becomes like restricted when we get in that place of restrictedness that's not casting bread upon the Water right but the casting of the bread upon the water is to remember what God did for you and how he did it he'll do it right for that loved one that relative that coworker if they belong to him to what even to whatever degree that they are yeah you know what and it might even be in degrees that God would use you it may not be all it once that's right it might be years and years and years on end brother Sean how many years was it that brother Ray witness to you uhoh five little by little by little by little sometimes it's by degrees degrees sometimes we look at things and think man as soon as I some different ones of you testify you know brother Andy when he worked over there and steel mill and how that affected many of your lives some of your lives you say well why was that it was not because you were any greater than anybody else God when God shows you anything it's because you've got a work to do there's things that God desires to move in your life the more that he shows you the more that he's Desiring he wants to work through your life right my goodness that's good let me can I just skip to this last quote here nobody said Amen on that one but let me just skip to this last quote and I want to I'm I'm I'm ending here remember that they laugh like but this is our responsibility and God's responsibility there's there's two parts here watch how brother Bram places this in the message he's asked a question in the message he's asked the question God being misunderstood this is the question and then I'll display the quote he said 'th Lord has told us through prophecy this person's writing a question the Lord has told us through prophecy to witness unto others of the things that we have heard and seen here such as The Nearness of the coming baptism in the name in Jesus name and such things we have told these things to some who seem to be Christians yet they don't seem to believe what do you think will happen to those people will they go in the rapture brother Bram doesn't he starts the question this way but I'm not going to display it this way he says I'm glad you said at the end of that what do you think he said because which he said if it's what I think it wouldn't make it right he said but I believe now let me read it to you he says I believe that no man can walk in the light of God until God reveals it to him I don't believe any amen all these hidden things are HID from the people no man can see them except God reveals them and I believe it because in the Bible it's always been that way you have you have eyes cannot see ears cannot hear all the father ha given me will come on and on many scriptures now watch you're responsible for spreading the light you're not responsible for them receiving the light you're responsible to take it to them but you're not responsible for their reaction if God lets us in that'll be up to him they haven't got the garments on and so forth but remember they can't see it until God reveals it unto them so what should we do well the prophet said inside of many of those places he calls out Methodist Baptist on and on and on he said there's many good people they're only waiting to see the light flashed across their path in humility I said oh God let us be that Lord there's lives on this human Troubled Water listen we would be in the same shape if not for the grace of God listen I'm standing right here I've watched God deliver from anxiety I've witnessed God heal from depression sometimes right away sometimes over a period but nonetheless it's God healing them that's right true and to see human Troubled Waters who wouldn't want to see somebody helped I remember one of the first things that you know sometimes there's things it's the first time you see it it kind of startles you and one of the things I remember you know at times when you now it's almost Common Place everywhere you go but I remember when we first got married I had a neighbor that they end up buying the trailer that was right next to us and when they moved in there and I seen I seen the the the gentleman that moved in there oh my Lord I I I didn't know how I was even going to look at him because like I said now this is commonplace but then he had the nose ring in had tattoos had everything all that was I mean back in 98 that was that was strange now you can go into certain restaurants and that's almost like prerequisite but it's just so common but it it shows you the time where where people are at listen friends you know what I'll tell you what under many of those things tattoos earrings and everything else there's good people yes there's people that are bound with different spirits and but underneath that is good people God help us to look beyond the shell that's one thing that God that's one thing that God spoke to my heart if there was nothing else than him bringing that that gentleman in right next to me it was for God to turn around and speak to my heart and say God help me cuz if not for your grace no doubt I looked a mess and I would look a mess I would look like the rest but God in his grace not one not you not me God in his grace God rich in Mercy I wonder I wonder if we could just look and say Lord let me cast my bread upon the water help me through my testimony it may not even be somebody that I'm actually talking to might be somebody else on the job that's watching me how that I've responded and let me just say it to you like this there's not one of us in here that is perfect or that has been free from mistakes on our job family whatever more but may we may we look and say God if there's something that I need to personally go to someone and say forgive me for the what the response that was displayed forgive me because that is not what a son or a daughter of God is to display and I am sorry that that display was done that way you say brother Samuel what will that do I'll tell you what humility remember I just read to you out of Philippians 2 humility to the word of God you might say they won't return my calls they won't answer my text they won't give me no period of time but if you'll take it before the Lord and say Lord you know that Soul you know that Heart Lord you know what I meant Lord you know I didn't mean but Lord God give me an opportunity Lord yes L that whatever that last impression would be let him see Let It Be an impression where a son or daughter of God has been able to display that you know what my life it didn't hit the mark but I'm here to stand as a son and daughter of God I'm here to ask as I've asked him forgiveness you forgive me because my life is to be an example I want to cast the right bread upon the Water let that be in our families let it be in our church let it be all around that every Our Testimony that is left after we leave it's been the bread bread that's there don't ever lose hope don't ever lose hope you hold on to the promise of God because God made that promise yes he did you love him tonight yes sir oh my think about what the prophet said there in that Mother's Day message there will be individuals he said that we didn't think would be there to me that CS us even when you have thoughts or thinking or different things it it causes you to look at things right now like hey there's some waiting on me right now there's some waiting on me right now abolutely don't you love the Lord yes sir let's just pray heavenly father thank you Lord you know Lord our needs you know the needs that are among us you know the hearts lives Lord that not only that we would rub shoulders with dear God we work with in our families relatives even as that other couple of quotes that I read of those Lord that would be backslid Lord sometimes it can be backsliding and setting right here in the church sometimes lord it's something that's happened also along the way maybe it's not setting right here Lord but God May our life be a life that could be one that somebody could take courage from maybe it's that returning to that loved one or that other and saying forgive me maybe it was something that maybe it wasn't something that wasn't said or done maybe it was a lack of care just something Lord how you would deal with our hearts to be able to touch their lives that you could touch their hearts Lord Jesus there's human Troubled Waters around us there's prevailing ing Waters Lord only the ark would withstand those Waters there's Waters Lord God as we read in the Book of Revelations there was also Waters that an ax head was lost in one day but there was a staff placed in the hand of the Prophet could reach down and against the laws of gravity it brought that ax Head Up From The Bottom beneath the waters and joined it Hallelujah to that staff right that wood oh God granted Lord May Our Lives be like that in your hand may it be like that in your hand Lord it could be an encouragement Hallelujah to someone else along the way maybe it's maybe it's not somebody that's out there it's another brother or sister right here in the local body maybe it's a brother or sister we come in contact with at a meeting somewhere funeral wedding sometimes a places Lord where individuals will come sometimes it'll be places like that or Fellowship dinner or family gathering sometimes Lord where they'll come in places like that but you know what I'm so glad you're not resp restricted to work just inside these four walls as a matter of fact your Prophet told us that inside of your children you go to church every single day Lord Jesus help us help us Lord to cast The Bread upon the water help us Lord that our testimony oh we get discouraged I know it Lord and I know Lord God all around it happens we get discouraged but father may we take courage even in that like your Prophet told us sometimes the reactions that we have seen not because we've had some certain thought about somebody or something but the reaction that we witnessed [Music] but the reaction that we saw at the last was not what was the lasting or what remained it just shows Lord it was the effect of that word on display it shows the effect of the word of God oh Lord how many times were we've walked away from situations whether it be family loved ones relatives people on the job we just been discouraged we've been down but Lord help us to remember our responsibility amen our responsibility is to Shine the Light Lord God it's in your hands to open their eyes it belongs to you Lord that just like you did to us you made us meat to be partakers of The Inheritance but the Saints in light as Paul wrote It's not what we did but it's your grace Lord father would you help us forgive us Lord forgive us and I ask you Lord where we've let down forgive us Lord knowing that Lord it was never a desire to stumble anybody Lord for a mistake or anything never never Lord you know Lord God even as I was walking up and down this place today talking to you Lord Jesus I willingly go if there's anything Lord Lord God any Lord that would be offended if there's something Lord that I've said or I've done give me the opportunity Lord to make that right if it's something that would hinder somebody I don't want them to be hindered yes Lord granted Lord Jesus Grant it Lord may we cast Lord our bread upon the waters Lord our families loved ones those that Lord God that backsliding Lord God they don't have to they didn't have to come to this church if they're backsliding whether the Lord God they go there to brother nathaniels they've went there it don't matter they're one of your sheep Lord give us [Music] Grace you know Lord God our focus is it's not about getting somebody to a church it's that they would know you Lord help us Lord help us give us the wisdom Lord Lord Jesus that's what your evening time light has has brought what the effect is to be in our life give us that Grace Lord give us the leadership we need for it's truly the bread upon the human Troubled Water that can turn the situation around it can break down the shackles it can break down the bars help us Lord may we remember that every even through all of our life everything we do in what or de do it all in the name of Jesus Christ let we realize Lord that and help us to always remember that help us Lord God to giving ourselves to the word of God letting the word of God just so permeate through our lives Lord as I spoke here earlier God you brought it to my attention about the sisters God bless them amen Lord Jesus to me Lord they're real heroes Lord God they're examples Lord that others could walk right past us Lord God but they see a display they see something that's different or they might poke fun at him at first but when they begin to talk to him there's a glory of the Lord amen a Sweetness in their life A Love For You Lord and Lord God as you begin to speak to them they realize this isn't somebody else like that of around in the world there's something different God I believe that's the same way for us as the brothers as well it may not be something Lord that where we would stand out maybe in that way although there's a lot of things that even nowadays as brethren we can not partake of Lord we do not even Adorn ourselves with Lord God give us Grace Lord help us Lord that the bread of life might be cast upon these human Troubled Waters granted Lord help us to reach every last one help us to encourage help us to encourage the discouraged Lord I know what it's like to feel discouraged help me Lord to encourage the discouraged oh God let our lives be a Let It Be Lord a display to somebody who feels like they can't make it let our Lives May the love of God be so sweet Lord that it would reach to their lives Lord to where there would be such Grace that would move down into their hearts Lord that they would rise rise and say Lord by your grace Lord what you've done for my brother my sister Lord you're no respect of persons do that for me Lord oh granted Lord let our Liv so
