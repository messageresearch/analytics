[38:31] the presence of the lord and
[38:33] i also want to remind you just to be
[38:37] very prayerful in the meetings that we
[38:38] have coming up here
[38:41] two weekends from from this weekend
[38:44] here on memorial day weekend brother
[38:46] andrew glover the lord willing will be
[38:47] ministry
[38:48] and we want you just to be very
[38:50] prayerful and i'm asking you
[38:52] as a congregation uh when we have when
[38:55] god has
[38:56] meetings that he places and when he
[38:58] places things on our heart
[39:00] that's for you that's for you it's for
[39:03] all of us
[39:04] we want to anything that we we receive
[39:07] from god
[39:09] is going to need to be an investment
[39:11] when we invest in these things through
[39:13] prayer and
[39:14] being here in the services to really
[39:17] draw because
[39:18] let me just say this to you the things
[39:20] of this
[39:21] life are typical
[39:25] they will flee away not just
[39:28] at the time of the rapture there's
[39:30] things right now that maybe
[39:32] this past week was your bulk trash you
[39:35] set some stuff out
[39:37] that at one time meant a lot to you or
[39:40] maybe you drop some stuff off it
[39:42] good will salvation army one time it
[39:45] meant a lot to you
[39:48] it's temple but the things of god
[39:52] are eternal amen these are the things
[39:55] and the times
[39:56] in this hour that we receive strength
[39:59] from el shaddai he's he just knows
[40:02] exactly
[40:03] what you and i have need of you know
[40:06] it's a very purposeful
[40:07] a very purposeful time and i believe
[40:09] every time that we come to the house of
[40:11] god
[40:12] i think what god has brought us through
[40:15] even in this past
[40:16] year it brings us to a reality of not to
[40:19] take one moment
[40:21] for granted amen not one moment
[40:24] for granted i was praying this morning
[40:27] not only praying and received different
[40:30] texts and things like that from india
[40:33] and other places
[40:35] just different ones requesting prayer
[40:38] and
[40:39] i thought lord here on one side we're
[40:42] there
[40:42] going through this just just sweeping
[40:45] through there
[40:47] then i thought lord here we have just
[40:49] right up to the north of us here
[40:52] a country and
[40:56] you'd never it never imagined because
[40:59] it's supposed to be a
[41:00] free democratic society
[41:04] but instead where they are standing
[41:08] against churches and closing them down
[41:13] we're not ignorant of satan's devices
[41:18] this is why we we must have eyes to see
[41:20] beyond
[41:21] all these things that's taking place and
[41:23] not get caught up
[41:25] in the things of this earth there's an
[41:26] agenda that's taking place
[41:30] are you with me i'm not being political
[41:32] right now not at all if that's what
[41:34] you're thinking you're way off
[41:35] board i'm not at all i'm saying right
[41:38] now
[41:39] when you see such things that are taking
[41:41] place
[41:42] there are brothers and sisters that
[41:44] would give their front teeth to be in
[41:46] the house of god
[41:47] there in canada they don't have a choice
[41:53] i say for everything that we have
[41:57] we've got to stand with different ones
[41:59] down through the ages
[42:00] of the hebrew children with those who
[42:03] were there in the time of the outpouring
[42:05] of the holy ghost there in pentecost
[42:07] we've got to stand there and stand with
[42:09] them as overcomers if we're going to
[42:11] stand there we have to stand as
[42:12] overcomers
[42:14] they never had it easy no i feel like
[42:16] i'm preaching already and i ain't even
[42:17] in my subject
[42:19] they didn't have it easy they had to
[42:23] persevere
[42:25] they had to go through many different
[42:27] circumstances and persevere
[42:29] but what was them that what was it that
[42:31] motivated them through all of that
[42:34] the love of god that was in their heart
[42:38] see the love of god will always places
[42:40] us in a place to say lord
[42:42] i trust you even when i don't understand
[42:45] it
[42:46] i trust you and i'm looking to you
[42:49] may we make every opportunity
[42:53] may we make it count every moment
[42:57] but we give everything that we've got
[42:59] we're in the final
[43:01] moments of this race
[43:05] we're here it's not we're arriving we've
[43:08] arrived
[43:10] we're at that time we're at a moment

[46:15] in the name of jesus christ amen and
[46:18] amen
[46:19] amen amen let's turn in john chapter 19
[46:24] verse 30.
[46:29] you're saying i so enjoyed that special
[46:31] mr beckham
[46:32] that's awesome that was just great
[46:36] i really enjoyed those words amen
[46:40] enjoyed the anointing that was with me
[46:42] [Music]
[46:43] amen i'm assuming you you wrote that
[46:46] song
[46:47] you didn't write it well you sang it
[46:50] like you
[46:54] really enjoyed that john 19 verse 30
[47:01] when jesus therefore had received the
[47:03] vinegar
[47:04] he said it is finished
[47:08] and he bowed his head and gave up
[47:11] the goals may god bless you bless the
[47:14] reading of the word as you're being
[47:15] seated
[47:17] i want to just continue
[47:22] with looking at this thought and there's
[47:24] just so many
[47:25] different points within it but that of
[47:28] the finisher
[47:30] and i'm sure that many of you here
[47:34] just like myself sometimes there's
[47:36] things that we've started on
[47:38] our own house projects and other things
[47:42] and they're still there they haven't
[47:44] been finished
[47:46] they've been starving sometimes there's
[47:48] things that we get in and
[47:50] we underestimate the job we get to
[47:53] looking at it sometimes we finished it
[47:55] but we've underestimated the time it's
[47:57] going to take
[47:58] well this is only going to be a few
[48:00] hours or this is just going to be a few
[48:01] days
[48:02] then there's some unexpected things that
[48:04] happen
[48:06] in between all of that that we didn't
[48:09] account for
[48:11] that causes us to sometimes if i can say
[48:14] this
[48:15] get frustrated because it wasn't in
[48:18] our plans we didn't plan for this we
[48:21] didn't plan for them to be out of these
[48:23] screws we didn't plan
[48:25] you know what i'm saying but that's not
[48:29] so with god
[48:31] and to remember that our lives
[48:34] is not our own work it's his work
[48:39] so when we consider this
[48:42] of of the finish here as we
[48:46] break into this this view on calvary
[48:49] where now the very life is
[48:53] leaving the body and here he
[48:56] utters out the very words to declare it
[48:59] is finished what work
[49:01] that he was commissioned and given to do
[49:04] to declare god to declare his
[49:06] righteousness to declare his loving
[49:08] kindness
[49:09] to pay the very price that was
[49:13] needed in order for redemption
[49:16] now when it was uttered out it is
[49:18] finished the price
[49:20] has been paid but now what what
[49:23] what where here in this earthly realm
[49:26] those words are uttered out and there's
[49:28] many even of his closest
[49:30] disciples that they didn't understand it
[49:33] they didn't know what was taking place
[49:35] but even after
[49:37] here where they find the euro here of
[49:40] the body and hear the expiring there on
[49:42] the cross where from a life that was
[49:45] fully surrendered
[49:47] but he went on accomplishing
[49:50] his work now he descends into
[49:54] into hell itself and he descends in
[49:58] there
[49:59] bearing the load the weight
[50:02] the guilt of the sin of the world
[50:05] every sin that would ever be every
[50:09] attribute he bore the sin
[50:12] the all of it into the very lowest parts
[50:15] of hell
[50:16] you see what he's doing he's taking it
[50:19] back to who it belongs to because
[50:23] sin my mind does not
[50:26] belong to the believer sin
[50:30] does not belong to a son and daughter of
[50:32] god
[50:34] sin belongs back on the one
[50:37] who in the beginning brought all of this
[50:40] about who was a perverter so now he's
[50:44] he's taking it right back to where it
[50:46] belongs
[50:47] there's a conquering that's going on
[50:50] down there
[50:51] beyond the earthly realms beyond what
[50:54] the disciples
[50:55] and the rest of them are even aware of
[50:58] what's taking place
[51:00] and i want to say it to you like this
[51:02] that when we think of and we express
[51:04] the coming of the lord this has been uh
[51:08] that which has been looked for all the
[51:11] way through the old testament
[51:13] it's been prophesied of the coming of
[51:15] the lord think of where the disciples
[51:17] would ask the lord jesus
[51:18] is it at this time that you will restore
[51:21] the
[51:22] kingdom unto israel but you see
[51:25] what was not known in that time is there
[51:27] was going to be
[51:29] a gentile dispensation that god was
[51:32] going to take a people for his namesake
[51:34] although it was hidden types yet things
[51:37] were also
[51:38] expressed very vividly in the old
[51:40] testament but you see
[51:42] god has a way of making things that he's
[51:45] expressed
[51:46] become vivid or become clear and that is
[51:50] only at that appointed time
[51:53] and to who it is that it's given to
[51:56] understand at that moment
[51:58] so it's not if we can say it like this
[52:01] it's not given for you and i nor do we
[52:03] have to press
[52:04] our way or to try to pry into anything
[52:08] all we have to do is yield to god i
[52:11] always think of you know as it's been
[52:13] said
[52:14] it's not the three pushes it's the three
[52:17] pulls
[52:18] so if there's a pull then what it
[52:20] requires is just a yielding in our lives
[52:23] it's god who draws us unto himself
[52:26] so the coming of the lord which is an
[52:29] event
[52:29] that has been unfolding even right down
[52:32] to the present hour
[52:34] that we're living in and i want to just
[52:36] just say it in this manner peter would
[52:38] pick it up
[52:39] in first peter verse 1 or chapter 1 and
[52:42] verse 18
[52:43] and here peter is speaking to the jews
[52:46] that have been scattered about as
[52:48] strangers into
[52:49] among gentile lambs and he says for as
[52:52] much as you know
[52:54] that you were not redeemed with
[52:55] corruptible things as silver and gold
[52:58] from your vain conversation received
[53:02] by tradition from your fathers see they
[53:05] were keeping the law
[53:06] they were offering the sacrifices all
[53:08] that god
[53:09] had given them to do at the time but
[53:12] remember
[53:12] the law could make nothing perfect
[53:17] so he's letting them know there was
[53:19] something greater
[53:20] nothing of of silver and gold that
[53:23] that was given that was corruptable but
[53:26] your redemption here
[53:28] it is purchased now as he goes on by the
[53:31] precious blood of christ
[53:33] as of a lamb without blemish and without
[53:37] spot so you know what he's letting him
[53:38] know this
[53:40] is sure this is sure
[53:45] there's things that are corruptable but
[53:48] this
[53:49] is incorruptible who
[53:52] verily look at this verse here who
[53:54] verily
[53:55] was foreordained before
[53:58] the foundation of the world
[54:02] but was manifest in these last
[54:05] times for you he's bringing it down the
[54:09] manifestation
[54:11] of that lamb now offering up his life
[54:15] it was done with you in mind
[54:18] this was before the foundation of the
[54:21] world
[54:22] amen it's all an unfolding of things
[54:25] that are taking place here
[54:28] who by him do believe in god that raised
[54:30] him up from the dead
[54:32] and gave him glory that your faith and
[54:34] hope
[54:35] might be in god in revelations 13
[54:38] 8 here here it picks up regarding that
[54:42] worship that this is an end time
[54:44] scripture
[54:45] an end time scripture is speaking of
[54:48] that worship
[54:49] to that beast that image of the beast
[54:52] and it speaks here and all that dwell
[54:54] upon the earth
[54:56] shall worship him whose names are not
[54:59] written in the book of life of the lamb
[55:04] slain from the foundation of the world
[55:06] that's what i want to focus on
[55:09] this was already this was something that
[55:12] already
[55:13] took place in the mind of god
[55:16] what we just read about here even in
[55:18] john
[55:19] 19 30 it was a part
[55:22] of that plan being unfolded but the lamb
[55:25] was slain before the foundation of the
[55:28] world before there was an atom
[55:30] molecule before there was ever an angel
[55:34] the lamb was slain from the foundation
[55:38] of the world samuel what are you saying
[55:42] that redemption is sure
[55:48] it was already finished
[55:52] before there was ever even a beginning
[55:56] hallelujah isaiah himself when you would
[56:00] read of this you know when you find in
[56:02] isaiah 53
[56:03] hear isaiah being a prophet and a
[56:06] prophet himself
[56:07] is caught up that was god has placed in
[56:11] his life
[56:12] he's caught up into that realm of the
[56:14] word you see
[56:15] there's a realm that's much greater than
[56:18] the realm that you and i walk in
[56:20] we walk in this timeline matter and all
[56:22] of this around here
[56:23] but there's another realm that's much
[56:26] greater
[56:28] and isaiah is caught up into this this
[56:31] realm
[56:32] he's caught into the realm of the word
[56:34] where when you read in isaiah 53
[56:36] you read it he was bruised for our
[56:39] iniquities
[56:41] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[56:44] him
[56:45] you know you can read through isaiah
[56:46] it's not wrong
[56:48] writ as though it's a future tense it's
[56:51] wrote
[56:51] as a past tense happening because
[56:54] in god's mind the lamb was slain it was
[56:58] all settled
[56:59] right there in the mind of god it was
[57:02] god's thoughts
[57:03] and so now it's a plan of god that's
[57:06] being
[57:07] unfolded even in this very moment
[57:10] in our midst in our lives
[57:14] oh my no wonder jesus could say blessed
[57:17] are your ears that hear
[57:18] and your eyes that see i tell you for
[57:21] every believer that's lived
[57:23] down through the ages they can declare
[57:25] that in their age but let me say this to
[57:27] you
[57:28] how much greater in the hour we're
[57:30] living in
[57:31] we're living in a time where it's a
[57:34] finishing
[57:35] up of this work of redemption it's a
[57:38] closing
[57:39] hour we're seeing that moment this is
[57:42] what
[57:42] the prophets themselves were waiting on
[57:45] when they were caught up and they would
[57:47] express these things
[57:49] as in the book of isaiah jeremiah on and
[57:52] on
[57:52] yet they would come back down the word
[57:55] was spoken
[57:55] and their lives would be lived and go on
[57:57] for hundreds and
[57:59] and hundreds of years before many things
[58:01] would just start taking place and
[58:03] happening but you and i are not living
[58:05] in the
[58:05] hour where promises are being made this
[58:09] is not the hour of promises being made
[58:11] this is the hour of the god who made the
[58:13] promises
[58:14] coming to fulfill them
[58:15] [Applause]
[58:19] this is where we're at
[58:23] hallelujah isaiah was transported up in
[58:26] that realm
[58:27] of the word what isaiah caught he was
[58:31] in tune to be able to hear what god
[58:34] already said you see a prophet
[58:38] is not uttering his own thoughts he's
[58:41] caught up into the thoughts of god and
[58:44] it's god's
[58:45] thoughts that are being uttered out are
[58:48] you with me
[58:50] so when we see this here let me just say
[58:53] it to you like this and and
[58:54] that be he purposed god himself before
[58:57] there was ever a man
[58:59] he already had a plan
[59:02] before there was anybody lost he already
[59:05] had a cross
[59:07] this is it's already it's tied up
[59:10] that's right
[59:17] god came according to the word
[59:20] he'll never come outside of his word
[59:24] he'll always work according to that here
[59:27] in luke 24 where you find the disciples
[59:30] they're walking along and hear the bible
[59:34] let's just pick into let's just
[59:35] move into this conversation in verse 25
[59:38] and he
[59:39] steps out and he says to them all fools
[59:42] and slow of heart to believe all that
[59:46] the prophets
[59:47] have spoken
[59:50] so he's letting them know first of all
[59:54] there's things that has been spoken
[59:57] that you've been slow to believe right
[1:00:00] they believed a lot of things but
[1:00:02] there's other things you've been slow to
[1:00:03] believe
[1:00:06] ought not christ to have suffered these
[1:00:09] things and to
[1:00:10] enter into his glory and beginning in
[1:00:13] moses and all the prophets
[1:00:15] he expounded unto them in all the
[1:00:18] scriptures
[1:00:19] the things concerning himself
[1:00:24] i find this to be in this in this
[1:00:26] portion of scripture
[1:00:27] how brother branham would take this in
[1:00:29] christ the mystery and he's he's
[1:00:31] bringing this out to us
[1:00:33] and he's talking you know he's declaring
[1:00:35] in this message
[1:00:37] of why i've done what i've done all the
[1:00:39] days here at the tabernacle
[1:00:41] why the message that i stood to stood
[1:00:43] for and preached and proclaimed
[1:00:45] all these decisions and he says now he
[1:00:48] says what i want to do
[1:00:49] is he reads this in luke 24 and he says
[1:00:52] now i'm going to take the entire bible
[1:00:54] for my text
[1:00:56] because we're living in a time of the
[1:00:58] finish
[1:01:00] but i want you to catch some things here
[1:01:02] that's very personal
[1:01:03] brother brown tells us how that jesus he
[1:01:06] steps out
[1:01:07] as we read here and he steps out and
[1:01:09] begins to converse with them
[1:01:11] now when he comes to them they're sad
[1:01:14] they're weeping they're discouraged and
[1:01:18] they don't know what's taking place but
[1:01:20] there
[1:01:21] is word that's already been spoken
[1:01:25] it's been fulfilled and they didn't know
[1:01:28] it's been fulfilled
[1:01:30] they didn't even realize what was taking
[1:01:33] place
[1:01:34] but here they are in this moment walking
[1:01:37] with sadness
[1:01:38] brother braham says it like this he says
[1:01:40] and they were going along
[1:01:42] and they looked upon the account of his
[1:01:45] death and how they
[1:01:46] seen him suffer for what they had
[1:01:49] thought was of no value at
[1:01:52] all
[1:01:55] i wonder how many times in our lives
[1:01:57] remember
[1:01:59] things that we start and then things
[1:02:02] that are finished
[1:02:03] i wonder how many times that even in the
[1:02:06] life's journey
[1:02:07] in god working in our lives i wonder how
[1:02:10] many times that we've looked at
[1:02:12] tests or trials or happenings and we've
[1:02:15] looked at things to maybe be
[1:02:17] well this is no value at all but god has
[1:02:20] been working
[1:02:21] the whole time he's a god that
[1:02:25] even when they themselves thought this
[1:02:27] is of no value
[1:02:28] what they didn't recognize the greatest
[1:02:31] event
[1:02:32] besides that of where god and man were
[1:02:35] joined together there at the river
[1:02:36] jordan
[1:02:37] but now on the on calvary the price
[1:02:41] has been paid and been offered up they
[1:02:43] were not even aware of that great event
[1:02:46] this is a fulfillment of the word they
[1:02:48] were not even aware of the great event
[1:02:51] i hope you're hearing me they were not
[1:02:53] even aware of the great event at that
[1:02:55] moment that they were actually a part of
[1:02:59] they had no idea that what they thought
[1:03:02] was of no value
[1:03:03] was a great event that this very thing
[1:03:07] taking place of the price of redemption
[1:03:10] and now his resurrection it would lead
[1:03:13] to the outpouring of the holy ghost and
[1:03:16] it continues on
[1:03:17] it leads you and i into a place of the
[1:03:20] body change
[1:03:20] of the rapture it leads on to the
[1:03:23] millennium
[1:03:24] it leads on to the future hope it keeps
[1:03:26] on going
[1:03:28] amen and yet many things that were
[1:03:31] taking place this
[1:03:32] is why when paul would write many times
[1:03:36] if we step back and bring it into our
[1:03:38] own lives
[1:03:39] that many of the times that we are not
[1:03:42] even aware or not even thinking in this
[1:03:44] way
[1:03:45] but the tests and trials that come our
[1:03:47] way they
[1:03:48] are foreordained of almighty god
[1:03:52] when peter could stand there in the book
[1:03:54] of acts he let him know
[1:03:56] that that you have taken the prince of
[1:03:58] life and with wicked hands have
[1:04:00] crucified him
[1:04:01] but he said i want you to know he was
[1:04:03] delivered unto you
[1:04:05] by the determinate counsel of
[1:04:08] the almighty god amen that even
[1:04:12] this that was taking place that thing
[1:04:14] was no value at all
[1:04:16] god was working his plan was being
[1:04:18] fulfilled
[1:04:19] let me just tell you something god's
[1:04:21] word it cannot
[1:04:23] be stopped
[1:04:26] amen and the tests and trials that god
[1:04:30] in his infinite wisdom allows to come
[1:04:32] our way
[1:04:33] they've got a purpose
[1:04:40] many times in a test and trial god as it
[1:04:43] comes to you and i
[1:04:44] our humanity pulls back but that's the
[1:04:47] time when the
[1:04:48] god part on the inside will stand in the
[1:04:51] midst of that hour
[1:04:52] even when you don't feel like or think
[1:04:54] you've got enough faith
[1:04:56] but it's not based on your thoughts
[1:04:58] about things
[1:05:01] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:05:03] that's in the world
[1:05:04] [Applause]
[1:05:06] it's not your faith that's overcoming
[1:05:08] the world it's
[1:05:09] god's faith inside of you that's
[1:05:11] overcoming the world
[1:05:14] you might look around and wonder how am
[1:05:16] i still standing it's because there's
[1:05:18] one who stood for you
[1:05:19] and now the same one is
[1:05:24] [Applause]
[1:05:28] [Music]
[1:05:31] paul said the dying of the lord jesus in
[1:05:33] our body
[1:05:34] that his life might be made manifest in
[1:05:37] our own life let me just say this to you
[1:05:41] that doesn't mean whereas intestinal
[1:05:43] trials
[1:05:44] that we take sicknesses and we just take
[1:05:47] them
[1:05:47] and we here we are we just you know line
[1:05:49] ourselves up like a velcro target and
[1:05:51] say
[1:05:52] go ahead devil just keep on attacking it
[1:05:54] on me
[1:05:55] but it's it's a time to where you
[1:05:57] realize tests and trials come
[1:05:59] but we're standing there upon the word
[1:06:01] and know what
[1:06:02] god has declared by his stripes i'm
[1:06:05] already healed i don't care
[1:06:07] what we feel like that has nothing to do
[1:06:10] with the word of god
[1:06:13] amen we stand on god's word regardless
[1:06:16] this is what god has said and then the
[1:06:19] devil wants to hand you something
[1:06:21] hand it right back to it you don't have
[1:06:24] to take it or accept
[1:06:25] it you can hand it right back to you
[1:06:28] amen
[1:06:29] [Music]
[1:06:30] hello glory be to god let me i gotta
[1:06:33] move on here
[1:06:36] but there are things that come up i'm
[1:06:39] sure
[1:06:41] when we look at these situations that
[1:06:43] take place
[1:06:44] even in the fulfillment of the word god
[1:06:47] laying out the prophecy of his word
[1:06:50] there are things that in some of these
[1:06:52] instances that
[1:06:54] that may be with some of these believers
[1:06:56] they wouldn't they wouldn't have chosen
[1:06:58] the pathway
[1:06:59] joseph wouldn't have been chosen to
[1:07:00] throw be thrown in a pit
[1:07:02] right he wasn't chosen all these years
[1:07:06] to be away
[1:07:07] from his father
[1:07:10] that wasn't his choosing it was god's
[1:07:14] plan
[1:07:17] i'm not going to preach on that this
[1:07:19] morning but wonder how many times that
[1:07:22] joseph lay there in prison thinking
[1:07:25] what value is this
[1:07:31] but god was working on joseph
[1:07:34] and god then was going to work on the
[1:07:36] other end
[1:07:37] god is arranging everything
[1:07:40] perfectly to where when joseph could
[1:07:43] stand there at that moment
[1:07:45] he could say what you meant for evil he
[1:07:48] never tried to hide it
[1:07:50] never tried to mince words with him but
[1:07:52] he let him know
[1:07:53] that's what you meant for evil but god
[1:07:56] meant it for good god was in control
[1:08:00] all along when you threw me in the pit
[1:08:03] god was there
[1:08:05] when i was sold to the ishmaelite
[1:08:07] bandits
[1:08:08] god was there women put me there in the
[1:08:11] prison
[1:08:12] god was there when i was in potiphar's
[1:08:14] house
[1:08:15] god was there are you hearing me god was
[1:08:18] with him i wonder how many times he
[1:08:21] felt like god was with him
[1:08:26] sure there's a lot of times he didn't
[1:08:28] feel like god was with him
[1:08:31] but joseph had come to this realization
[1:08:34] that through it all god has done it
[1:08:38] for a purpose
[1:08:41] the bible says for prayer for the
[1:08:42] prophecy came not in old time
[1:08:45] by the will of man but holy men of god
[1:08:48] spake as they were moved by the holy
[1:08:52] ghost so all of the all of the acts as
[1:08:55] we've
[1:08:56] looked at the acts even there were those
[1:08:59] who would speak the word there were
[1:09:02] words that were spoken
[1:09:03] as isaiah would express that word as we
[1:09:06] looked at last week
[1:09:07] behold a virgin shall conceive caught
[1:09:09] beyond his own senses
[1:09:11] and to for a word to be uttered like
[1:09:13] this but it wasn't isaiah's word
[1:09:16] it was god's word it's god that came on
[1:09:19] the scene to
[1:09:20] fulfill it at the appointed time but in
[1:09:22] the lives of
[1:09:23] other believers they didn't speak
[1:09:27] but their lives spoke it was the same
[1:09:30] holy spirit
[1:09:31] that would pick up the prophets and they
[1:09:34] would speak as they were moved by god
[1:09:36] that same holy spirit is the same one
[1:09:39] who moved upon rebecca
[1:09:40] it's the same holy spirit that moved
[1:09:42] upon esther it's the same holy spirit
[1:09:45] that moved upon tamar it's the same holy
[1:09:47] spirit
[1:09:48] that moved upon rehab it's the same holy
[1:09:50] spirit
[1:09:51] that though they did not speak prophecy
[1:09:54] but their lives
[1:09:55] spoke prophecy of an end-time
[1:09:58] people of a bride that would come to
[1:10:01] maturity
[1:10:02] it was prophecy that was going forth out
[1:10:05] of their lives
[1:10:08] the acts of the believer declares this
[1:10:11] and you know they fulfilled their part
[1:10:15] they fulfilled it and they fulfilled it
[1:10:17] by the inspiration
[1:10:19] of the holy spirit that come to him i
[1:10:21] want you to look at this
[1:10:23] here is elijah speaking to job
[1:10:26] in the midst of job's times of tests and
[1:10:29] trials now
[1:10:30] remember all the all the older men have
[1:10:33] been there
[1:10:34] and elihu had uh given them honor
[1:10:38] and now here you know all that
[1:10:40] conversation and where it's when
[1:10:42] but here's where elijah steps forward
[1:10:44] and he expresses
[1:10:46] to job i said days should speak
[1:10:50] multitude of years should teach wisdom
[1:10:54] but there is a spirit in man and the
[1:10:56] inspiration
[1:10:57] of the almighty giveth them
[1:11:00] understanding
[1:11:02] now there's times it's true that wisdom
[1:11:06] it cometh with age even the bible will
[1:11:08] talk about the whorehead the gray hair
[1:11:10] and things like that for those that have
[1:11:11] it it would speak of that
[1:11:13] about the times of wisdom but you know
[1:11:15] as well as i do there are people
[1:11:16] older how do i say this
[1:11:19] they ain't got to lick more wisdom than
[1:11:21] nothing right right
[1:11:23] you're with me yeah i mean it's like you
[1:11:25] know they're they're
[1:11:26] they're still you know well let me just
[1:11:28] move on from that
[1:11:29] so it isn't necessarily that age itself
[1:11:32] speaks of wisdom
[1:11:35] this is what ella who is standing around
[1:11:38] and he's watching this
[1:11:39] and he recognizes it's not that of age
[1:11:42] that's
[1:11:43] actually helping job but now the spirit
[1:11:46] of god see
[1:11:46] god is mindful even of job going through
[1:11:49] his test
[1:11:50] and his trial job doesn't know what's
[1:11:52] taking place he doesn't know what's
[1:11:55] happening
[1:11:56] job doesn't he's not aware what's taking
[1:11:58] place and
[1:11:59] how's this going to come out you see he
[1:12:01] knows by being a prophet
[1:12:03] there's got to be an outworking there's
[1:12:06] a purpose he's trying to find that
[1:12:08] but you see god has hid it from him but
[1:12:11] now the inspiration of the almighty
[1:12:13] and now it's going to speak to job it's
[1:12:16] god who gives
[1:12:17] inspiration and i'm telling you this
[1:12:20] here it's god that gives you and i
[1:12:22] inspiration and understanding it's his
[1:12:25] inspiration
[1:12:26] that gives peace to our lives it's his
[1:12:28] inspiration that gives
[1:12:30] direction and guidance and leadership
[1:12:35] he goes on and says the spirit of god
[1:12:38] hath made me and the breath the
[1:12:41] inspiration
[1:12:42] of the almighty hath given me life
[1:12:47] let me just say this you are
[1:12:50] ordained and anointed to finish
[1:13:00] ordained and anointed to finish
[1:13:03] god already saw him as a finished work
[1:13:10] hallelujah where they have walked
[1:13:14] when the bible speaks of the old
[1:13:16] testament saints they
[1:13:18] walked through deserts the bible says
[1:13:20] wandered
[1:13:21] in sheepskins clothed here they were as
[1:13:25] outcasts of the world but yet the world
[1:13:27] wasn't even worthy of them
[1:13:29] they lived out their purpose their life
[1:13:32] under the inspiration of almighty god i
[1:13:35] hope you understand what i'm saying
[1:13:37] i'm not talking about inspiration where
[1:13:39] you've got a good feeling
[1:13:40] and you walk out and and it's no and
[1:13:43] here people just continue on
[1:13:45] i'm talking about the inspiration that
[1:13:47] sets our lives
[1:13:48] in motion it's where god himself comes
[1:13:52] down
[1:13:53] and it's god now who begins to express
[1:13:55] his word
[1:13:56] through our lives it's what is already
[1:13:59] there and
[1:14:00] inspiration comes upon that word
[1:14:03] look at this in hebrews 1. god who at
[1:14:07] sundried times
[1:14:08] and in diverse manners spake in times
[1:14:10] past unto the fathers by the prophets
[1:14:13] half in these last days spoken unto us
[1:14:16] by his son
[1:14:17] the word whom he hath appointed heir of
[1:14:20] all things
[1:14:21] by whom also he made the worlds who
[1:14:23] being the brightness
[1:14:25] of his glory and the express image
[1:14:28] of his person and upholding all things
[1:14:32] by the word of his power when he had by
[1:14:34] himself
[1:14:35] purged our sins sat down on the right
[1:14:38] hand
[1:14:39] of the majesty on high
[1:14:43] so what was uttered it is finished
[1:14:46] the conquering went on then he ascends
[1:14:49] up
[1:14:50] there seated at the right hand and we
[1:14:53] understand
[1:14:53] he sat down in the throne with the
[1:14:57] father
[1:14:58] is that right now here's a corporal body
[1:15:01] there on the throne
[1:15:02] yeah are you with me because jesus is
[1:15:05] not an iron boy
[1:15:06] he's not a second person it's not he's
[1:15:08] not you know an old man
[1:15:10] with a hand out here and here the sun
[1:15:11] climbs up on that right hand signifies
[1:15:14] power and authority yeah amen amen
[1:15:18] so with that power and authority there's
[1:15:22] nothing that has been able to stop
[1:15:25] god's program from coming forward
[1:15:28] and there's nothing going to stop it
[1:15:31] from being
[1:15:32] fulfilled are you with me the devil all
[1:15:35] through the old testament
[1:15:36] he wanted to try to hinder that he tried
[1:15:38] to get at him wanted to stone the
[1:15:40] prophets
[1:15:41] wanted to take them out but what the
[1:15:43] dumb devil didn't realize is
[1:15:45] you can kill this body but you can't
[1:15:48] kill the life
[1:15:51] and when when god was finished with this
[1:15:54] vessel
[1:15:55] this one on earth then god called them
[1:15:57] home they might have been taken out of
[1:15:59] the earth
[1:16:00] in a way that would seem very ear uh
[1:16:03] disrespect and things like that but god
[1:16:06] was calling them home
[1:16:08] their lives had been their purpose had
[1:16:10] been fulfilled
[1:16:11] the expression whether they spoke it
[1:16:14] here or they
[1:16:14] lived that out here it had been
[1:16:16] fulfilled and god called them home
[1:16:18] after their part had been served and the
[1:16:21] devil
[1:16:22] couldn't stop it
[1:16:25] man he could not stop it he wanted to
[1:16:28] stratus
[1:16:29] he came at it in every way and you know
[1:16:32] what he knows he can't stop
[1:16:34] it but that doesn't keep him from trying
[1:16:38] he'd like to make you think that he can
[1:16:40] stop you
[1:16:42] [Applause]
[1:16:45] i said he'd like to make you think that
[1:16:47] but it's
[1:16:48] not you
[1:16:51] it's not you it's god
[1:16:55] if it would have been up to me or you
[1:16:57] we'd have gave up a long time ago
[1:17:01] but god cannot be
[1:17:04] stopped
[1:17:05] [Applause]
[1:17:12] he upholded upholds all things by the
[1:17:16] word of his power
[1:17:17] amen
[1:17:20] i know science can have all of this and
[1:17:22] you know they got this and well this is
[1:17:24] spinning here in this planet here and
[1:17:26] this star here and this here and this
[1:17:28] here and this here but all the figurings
[1:17:30] out
[1:17:31] is not what holds it in place
[1:17:34] it's god you want to put your law of
[1:17:37] physics and everything else
[1:17:39] my point is is that who was the one
[1:17:42] who said it and then just happen to
[1:17:45] allow a canary brain to tap
[1:17:47] into it come on now
[1:18:05] just a few scriptures here just just
[1:18:07] pressed on my heart to read these
[1:18:10] i don't have these up there but i'm just
[1:18:11] going to read them here it speaks
[1:18:14] in psalms 37 the arms of the wicked
[1:18:17] shall be broken
[1:18:18] but the lord upholdeth the righteous
[1:18:21] amen the lord knoweth the days of the
[1:18:24] upright
[1:18:24] and their inheritance shall be forever
[1:18:27] they shall not be ashamed in the evil
[1:18:29] time
[1:18:29] and in the days of famine they shall be
[1:18:32] satisfied
[1:18:33] psalms 37 23 the steps of a good man
[1:18:37] are ordered by the lord and he
[1:18:39] delighteth in his ways
[1:18:40] though he fall he shall not be utterly
[1:18:44] cast down
[1:18:45] for the lord upholdeth him with
[1:18:48] his hand
[1:18:52] what are you saying brother samuel that
[1:18:54] we are upheld
[1:18:55] with the word of his power
[1:18:59] it's god that's holding everything right
[1:19:01] where it needs to be
[1:19:04] there's not one thing that can even make
[1:19:06] an encroachment or
[1:19:08] anything at all it's held right there by
[1:19:10] the word of his power
[1:19:12] our lives are upheld by the word of his
[1:19:14] power
[1:19:16] glory be to god in the highest think of
[1:19:19] this
[1:19:20] this word
[1:19:23] i want you to think of this here as we
[1:19:25] read on in this scripture
[1:19:28] and thou lord hebrews 1 10
[1:19:31] and thou lord in the beginning has laid
[1:19:35] the foundation
[1:19:36] of the earth and the heavens
[1:19:39] are the works of thine hands they shall
[1:19:43] perish but thou
[1:19:46] remainest and they all shall wax old
[1:19:51] as doth a garment and as a
[1:19:54] vesture shout thou fold them up and they
[1:19:57] shall be changed but thou art the same
[1:20:02] and thy years shall not
[1:20:05] fail
[1:20:09] a lot of things can change everything
[1:20:12] here
[1:20:13] upon the face of this earth
[1:20:16] when fallen the when sin entered the
[1:20:19] fall came
[1:20:20] then death sets in is that right
[1:20:23] fear sets in where animals and
[1:20:26] hiding and all those things now becomes
[1:20:29] prey and predatory
[1:20:32] is that right before that time it was
[1:20:34] not praying predator
[1:20:36] amen are you with me well just to show
[1:20:39] you in the in the millennium
[1:20:40] when it says the lion will lay down by
[1:20:42] the lamb the lion is not going to have
[1:20:44] them big old teeth
[1:20:46] it will eat straw amen that's scripture
[1:20:51] hey listen if that line he got his teeth
[1:20:54] yanked out
[1:20:55] that changed i'm talking about the line
[1:20:58] that are laid down in the millennium hey
[1:20:59] look god took the bite out of our lives
[1:21:01] too
[1:21:02] you might as well preach with me he took
[1:21:04] the bite out of some of some of our
[1:21:06] lives
[1:21:07] is that right amen and brought a real
[1:21:10] peace into our life
[1:21:12] because we were so we couldn't even get
[1:21:15] along with ourselves much less with
[1:21:16] anybody else
[1:21:18] amen are you with me it's not it's not
[1:21:22] not a miracle he'll bring that change
[1:21:24] about he's brought a change in our
[1:21:26] nature
[1:21:27] the same god and rather change in our
[1:21:28] nature it will bring a change to the
[1:21:30] atoms of these bodies
[1:21:33] is that right though the earth and how
[1:21:35] the world itself growing old and notice
[1:21:38] like a garment a garment is something
[1:21:41] that's on the
[1:21:41] outside is the outer covering but what
[1:21:44] remains the same
[1:21:46] is thou o lord amen his word
[1:21:50] cannot change that's who he is amen
[1:21:54] amen it cannot be changed
[1:21:58] think about from where we're coming hear
[1:22:00] from the mind of god
[1:22:02] where here god here was the word
[1:22:06] it cannot change even after god has
[1:22:09] spoken it he didn't speak something
[1:22:11] different from himself
[1:22:12] he was only expressing the thoughts
[1:22:15] of himself
[1:22:19] notice matthew chapter 5 verse 17
[1:22:22] think not that i am come to destroy the
[1:22:24] law or the prophets
[1:22:26] i am not come to destroy but to fulfill
[1:22:30] for verily i say unto you till heaven
[1:22:32] and earth pass
[1:22:34] one jot or one tittle shall in no wise
[1:22:37] pass from the law
[1:22:38] till all be fulfilled
[1:22:42] i want you to think of this just for a
[1:22:44] moment jesus went
[1:22:46] deeper than just words all right amen
[1:22:50] the word had to be fulfilled is that
[1:22:52] right
[1:22:53] but in order for the word to be
[1:22:55] fulfilled he brings it into a
[1:22:57] jot and tunnel which is an accent mark
[1:23:01] i don't know about you but when i was
[1:23:03] teaching school i had to learn with some
[1:23:04] of the names i had to learn accent marks
[1:23:07] yeah and you know what i had i butchered
[1:23:09] some things up i'd write it out right
[1:23:11] there
[1:23:12] write it out so i'd have to so i know
[1:23:13] how to say that particular name or
[1:23:15] whatever
[1:23:15] sometimes it went into difficult names
[1:23:17] it's just that's just the things that
[1:23:19] were accent
[1:23:20] marks they meant to express this or
[1:23:21] express that or do this
[1:23:23] you see what god is saying here is that
[1:23:26] even the expression of that word
[1:23:30] which it must in order to be fulfilled
[1:23:33] it must be expressed according to his
[1:23:36] thought
[1:23:38] so even that expression of it the way of
[1:23:41] just that
[1:23:42] little accent mark in order for that to
[1:23:45] be expressed
[1:23:46] it takes god who gave the word
[1:23:50] coming on the scene and into our lives
[1:23:53] to express that word because the word
[1:23:55] cannot be changed
[1:23:57] the word cannot be altered the word is
[1:24:00] to be
[1:24:01] fulfilled and to hear god comes on the
[1:24:04] scene
[1:24:05] to fulfill that word to express that
[1:24:07] word
[1:24:08] and it's the inspiration of almighty god
[1:24:11] coming
[1:24:11] in the manifestation of his word that's
[1:24:14] what brings a real son and daughter of
[1:24:16] god
[1:24:16] out in our life it now
[1:24:20] it's no longer it's not just a word but
[1:24:23] now it's an expressed word
[1:24:26] it's got the accent on it it's got the
[1:24:28] real expression
[1:24:30] of what was in god's thinking amen
[1:24:33] now when you look at this here think
[1:24:36] back to
[1:24:37] in genesis 1 because
[1:24:40] when we look at even in our life and
[1:24:42] keeping that thought in mind
[1:24:44] of the finisher you often in genesis 1
[1:24:49] and the very first verse in the
[1:24:51] beginning god
[1:24:53] created the heavens and the earth period
[1:24:58] brown will pick that up and he points
[1:24:59] this out to us
[1:25:01] in the message power transformation and
[1:25:03] he points out to us
[1:25:05] of god's objective that he's had to
[1:25:08] bring this
[1:25:08] to pass he said many people have taken
[1:25:12] these
[1:25:13] first chapters of genesis
[1:25:16] and they are saying as though god is
[1:25:19] repeating himself
[1:25:22] but he said in actuality when god spoke
[1:25:25] it
[1:25:26] it was finished now listen to me now
[1:25:30] it was spoken when god said let there be
[1:25:33] light
[1:25:34] and there wasn't any light there wasn't
[1:25:37] nothing yet
[1:25:38] but his word was declared
[1:25:41] true amen are you with me now his word
[1:25:45] was declared
[1:25:45] there wasn't a light the old world was
[1:25:48] still floating
[1:25:49] in the darkness covered over with water
[1:25:51] but you see he had spoke his word
[1:25:54] then that's what he was speaking
[1:25:57] brother goes on to speak about how it
[1:26:00] goes in genesis 1
[1:26:01] 26 when god formed man in his own image
[1:26:04] in his own likeness in the image of god
[1:26:06] maybe him male and female he said see he
[1:26:09] was
[1:26:09] he was making man he just spoke
[1:26:13] the word and he goes on to say now maybe
[1:26:15] he said it was
[1:26:16] hundreds of years after that and there
[1:26:19] was still no man to till the soil
[1:26:22] but he says see god had spoke the word
[1:26:25] and then the word had to take place
[1:26:30] when god said something he said let
[1:26:32] there be
[1:26:33] he says there might have been hundreds
[1:26:35] of years
[1:26:37] before it ever came to pass
[1:26:41] but it had to come to pass
[1:26:46] it couldn't fail it was what was once
[1:26:49] now in god's mind
[1:26:51] has now been expressed it's been spoken
[1:26:54] amen amen and when god speaks it this
[1:26:57] is where as his children we can rest
[1:27:00] upon his word to know that what god has
[1:27:03] said
[1:27:04] he won't take it back i don't care what
[1:27:07] kind of conditions arise
[1:27:09] are you hearing me i don't care what
[1:27:11] situations arise
[1:27:12] in this world it doesn't matter
[1:27:15] god doesn't alter his word
[1:27:18] [Applause]
[1:27:19] he doesn't have to alter it and say oops
[1:27:22] i should have accounted for this i
[1:27:24] didn't know this was going to come up
[1:27:26] i didn't know this was going to come up
[1:27:28] he's not an oops god
[1:27:31] because an oops god is not a god
[1:27:36] there's no oops about him what he saw
[1:27:40] and from there in eternity he laid out
[1:27:43] everything and he got all the bases
[1:27:45] covered
[1:27:46] god's already spoke his word there's no
[1:27:49] going
[1:27:50] back on it amen amen
[1:27:53] hallelujah
[1:27:56] oh my brother adam says it like this
[1:27:59] right after this he says god is going to
[1:28:02] have a
[1:28:02] church i don't care how many dark ages
[1:28:06] we go through
[1:28:07] and whatever more he's going to have a
[1:28:09] church
[1:28:10] without spot or wrinkle whether we are
[1:28:13] part of it or not
[1:28:14] because he's already said it it's going
[1:28:17] to happen
[1:28:17] it's going to be there
[1:28:20] there's nothing can stop it there's
[1:28:24] not enough devil-inspired websites to
[1:28:27] turn around a son and daughter of god
[1:28:30] there's not enough demons in hell that
[1:28:32] can stop this word
[1:28:34] from being fulfilled god has spoken
[1:28:38] it and god is on the scene to fulfill it
[1:28:41] and bring it to pass
[1:28:43] he's got believers that'll stand on that
[1:28:46] word
[1:28:46] live sing drown swim whatever they'll
[1:28:49] stand on that word
[1:28:53] hallelujah i don't care how many decages
[1:28:56] in your life you've got to go through
[1:28:58] amen satan thought he had the church
[1:29:03] snuffed out in the dark ages he snuck in
[1:29:06] there
[1:29:08] he snuck in there and we find out that
[1:29:10] starting out in that ephesian age
[1:29:13] sneaks in there and wants to lead them
[1:29:15] away from a real
[1:29:17] true acts to experience of the baptism
[1:29:20] of the holy ghost
[1:29:22] instead of just mental exception will
[1:29:24] you believe on the lord jesus christ let
[1:29:26] me tell you something the devil believes
[1:29:28] it
[1:29:28] that's right well i believe this message
[1:29:30] is the truth the devil believes that
[1:29:32] all right i believe serpent see
[1:29:36] the serpent himself believes serpents
[1:29:38] see it yeah yeah
[1:29:39] amen it's these theologians that are all
[1:29:42] messed up out here
[1:29:43] come on it's evil spirits the bible said
[1:29:47] seducing spirits teaching doctrines of
[1:29:50] devils
[1:29:53] i'm going to preach now that trinitarian
[1:29:56] baptism
[1:29:57] is from the pits of hell it was inspired
[1:30:00] by the devil himself
[1:30:02] to try to break down that oneness and
[1:30:04] the unity of god
[1:30:06] because if you get it split into three
[1:30:08] person
[1:30:09] then you can kind of mess with the word
[1:30:11] does he keep all of his word
[1:30:13] what god says he keeps
[1:30:15] [Music]
[1:30:16] he don't need somebody else to keep it
[1:30:18] for him he keeps it himself
[1:30:20] [Applause]
[1:30:24] hallelujah glory be to god
[1:30:28] so here it doesn't matter all that takes
[1:30:30] place
[1:30:31] it's got to be there amen
[1:30:37] the bible says it like this
[1:30:41] in genesis 2. maybe i just
[1:30:44] kind of read this here the heavens and
[1:30:48] the earth
[1:30:49] were finished and all the host of them
[1:30:54] and on the seventh day god ended his
[1:30:58] work which he had made
[1:31:00] and he rested on the seventh day from
[1:31:02] all his work
[1:31:04] which he had made and god blessed the
[1:31:07] seventh day and saint about it
[1:31:09] because then in it he had rested from
[1:31:11] all his work
[1:31:13] which god created and made
[1:31:18] he already spoke it but now
[1:31:21] over the time this
[1:31:24] time used in this sense as far as a
[1:31:27] measure for you and i to understand
[1:31:30] over thousands of years
[1:31:33] but god's word could not be altered
[1:31:36] amen now when it came to a time of
[1:31:40] now where the word that's been spoken
[1:31:43] it's coming time of a manifestation
[1:31:47] god enters into his rest
[1:31:51] it's finished the seventh speaks
[1:31:56] of a time of completion
[1:31:59] it's a time of rest this is why
[1:32:02] the seventh seal to us as believers
[1:32:06] it's the time of relaxing it's a time of
[1:32:10] resting it's a time of entering into him
[1:32:14] where all the promises lay
[1:32:21] here the fall takes place
[1:32:25] let me just read this here i'm trying
[1:32:28] just to get us to a certain place here
[1:32:29] this morning
[1:32:30] in hebrews 4 3 paul picks up on this
[1:32:34] rest and he's picking it
[1:32:35] bringing it now there was a spiritual
[1:32:38] part to this
[1:32:39] for we which have believed do enter into
[1:32:42] his rest
[1:32:43] as he said as i have sworn in my wrath
[1:32:45] they shall
[1:32:46] enter into my rest although the works
[1:32:49] were finished from the foundation of the
[1:32:53] world
[1:32:56] when were they finished before the
[1:32:58] foundation of the earth is the correct
[1:33:00] word
[1:33:02] before there was adam stardust or
[1:33:05] molecule samuel what he's saying the
[1:33:08] word
[1:33:09] itself is eternal amen
[1:33:12] it cannot be altered what was in god's
[1:33:15] mind
[1:33:16] it was finished amen before it was ever
[1:33:20] spoken
[1:33:21] because what was spoken was just that
[1:33:24] same word
[1:33:25] that plan now that has been expressed
[1:33:28] and now has been unfolded
[1:33:32] amen down through the time
[1:33:38] although the works were finished think
[1:33:41] of this
[1:33:43] as the fall had come god
[1:33:47] is brought out of his rest on that
[1:33:50] seventh day
[1:33:52] he's brought out of that
[1:33:55] this is where we go back into that time
[1:33:58] of the millennium
[1:34:00] god moves out god is drawn out of that
[1:34:03] to come
[1:34:04] out of that seventh day to come
[1:34:08] and now begin to unfold redemption
[1:34:12] for his lost children
[1:34:15] it's going back to that seventh day amen
[1:34:19] we're going back to that seventh day but
[1:34:22] remember
[1:34:23] what god as he's brought out of that
[1:34:25] rest
[1:34:26] it's not something then that god now has
[1:34:29] to come up with a
[1:34:30] i gotta come up with a new plan no
[1:34:34] this circumstances that took place
[1:34:37] allowed the attributes of himself the
[1:34:40] word
[1:34:41] now allows him to be expressed
[1:34:44] it's just like in your life my life we
[1:34:47] were in need of salvation
[1:34:49] he expresses the attribute of savior
[1:34:52] amen
[1:34:53] we were in need of redemption he
[1:34:55] expresses the attribute of redeemer
[1:34:58] in need of deliverance he expresses the
[1:35:01] attribute of delivery
[1:35:03] in need of a shepherd he expresses the
[1:35:06] attribute of shepherd
[1:35:08] in need of healing he expresses the
[1:35:10] attribute of healer
[1:35:12] this is all he is everything
[1:35:16] he's got it all covered that no matter
[1:35:19] what situation you go through you say
[1:35:22] my here's where everything started but
[1:35:24] you realize
[1:35:25] you're start there's only a moment that
[1:35:28] maybe you came to an
[1:35:29] altar or at a pew or wherever you're at
[1:35:32] and there was a start that was made
[1:35:33] there
[1:35:34] but that was only a reflection
[1:35:37] of what was already in his mind amen
[1:35:41] god already saw where your heart would
[1:35:43] be surrendered
[1:35:44] god knew the conditions that would come
[1:35:46] about god knew
[1:35:48] all of that
[1:35:51] he knew each of those moments god knew
[1:35:54] exactly
[1:35:55] when everything would come to that place
[1:35:57] as you're yielding to his spirit
[1:35:59] to where now the quickening comes on the
[1:36:01] inside
[1:36:02] and the new birth comes forth in your
[1:36:04] life god has all of that
[1:36:06] pre-planned it's all been arranged
[1:36:11] it wasn't the spot was holy it was a
[1:36:14] holy god
[1:36:15] that came and met you and i right there
[1:36:18] where did he meet us he met us in his
[1:36:22] word
[1:36:24] gestures could change our lives were all
[1:36:27] scarred up or whatever more
[1:36:29] but down beneath that vesture there was
[1:36:33] a word
[1:36:34] that god had sold where did that come
[1:36:38] from it came from the eternal
[1:36:41] amen
[1:36:44] amen nothing could alter it
[1:36:50] amen
[1:36:52] man i wish i could preach right now
[1:36:57] the devil no dog tried to twist up your
[1:36:59] granddaddy and grandma
[1:37:01] and everything else but he couldn't stop
[1:37:04] because every one of that even in the
[1:37:06] natural has this one has got to come
[1:37:08] with this one
[1:37:09] this one with this one it's got to come
[1:37:11] according to that way
[1:37:12] and god knew that you would be here why
[1:37:15] even your hair color
[1:37:16] your eye color your stature every bit of
[1:37:19] that god
[1:37:20] seem to it that all those details would
[1:37:22] be put in place
[1:37:24] the same god that saw to those details
[1:37:27] made a way that you would be able
[1:37:31] to recognize him in this hour
[1:37:34] and receive him he sow his word
[1:37:38] in you
[1:37:44] though this festure gets old
[1:37:47] this gesture gets weak this vesture
[1:37:51] gets sick but the inside man
[1:37:54] is alive and is renewed
[1:38:05] [Music]
[1:38:12] we were trapped there's no way out
[1:38:16] but god came made out let's yes lord let
[1:38:19] me just close with this
[1:38:24] our identity as we said it was in him
[1:38:29] before the foundation of the world
[1:38:36] we read the scripture in the opening
[1:38:40] the lamb slain before the foundation of
[1:38:43] the world
[1:38:46] when job was going through
[1:38:49] the tests and trials and the height of
[1:38:51] everything
[1:38:55] remember job
[1:38:59] oh he said with the day that they had
[1:39:02] somebody had never bought the report
[1:39:04] a man child was born he was depressed
[1:39:10] he was down he didn't even have fan
[1:39:13] friends and family
[1:39:14] even they turned their backs on him
[1:39:18] god permitted that yes
[1:39:21] god was permitted that here was a man
[1:39:23] that didn't have the holy ghost like you
[1:39:25] and i
[1:39:26] are privileged to have it but he still
[1:39:29] was the seed of god
[1:39:31] and god proved to you and i this is
[1:39:34] where james could write by inspiration
[1:39:37] have you read of the patience of job
[1:39:41] right the endurance of job
[1:39:45] it wasn't job the natural man it was god
[1:39:48] in job
[1:39:52] and so here in the clone in this moment
[1:39:55] when god
[1:39:56] comes down after elohim allah who comes
[1:39:59] down
[1:40:00] sacrifice now it allows god to speak to
[1:40:03] him
[1:40:05] god now asks him a question where were
[1:40:09] you
[1:40:11] when i laid the foundations
[1:40:15] of the earth that's pretty powerful
[1:40:20] see brother samuel what do you mean i'm
[1:40:22] talking that before
[1:40:24] you or i even had an opportunity
[1:40:28] to choose before doing good or even
[1:40:35] before any test or any trial
[1:40:38] before any mistake before anything
[1:40:43] god's taking him back before all of this
[1:40:46] trial took place and god lets him know
[1:40:49] because if he can let him see get him
[1:40:52] getting tied in back there
[1:40:53] then he knows i'm going back amen
[1:40:58] amen so he asked him a question
[1:41:01] where were you when i laid the
[1:41:03] foundations of these
[1:41:04] amen declare if you've got understanding
[1:41:12] who hath laid the measures thereof if
[1:41:14] thou knowest or who has stretched the
[1:41:16] line of them
[1:41:17] where upon are the foundations they're a
[1:41:19] fastened or who laid the cornerstone
[1:41:21] thereof
[1:41:22] when the morning stars sing together
[1:41:26] and all the sons of god
[1:41:29] shouted for joy
[1:41:36] sons of god shouting for joy before
[1:41:40] the foundation of the world
[1:41:43] i may not be too smart but i know one
[1:41:45] thing when you're shouting for joy
[1:41:48] you are you are shouting at a victory
[1:41:52] it's something that's going for you
[1:41:57] right here this is where now the sons of
[1:42:00] god
[1:42:00] shouting for joy brother branham takes
[1:42:04] it up in the very
[1:42:05] opening statement of the message the
[1:42:07] serpent seed
[1:42:09] he says this was the time
[1:42:12] where the lamb was slain before the
[1:42:15] foundation of the world
[1:42:17] and the sons of god saw their salvation
[1:42:20] they saw the security of it and they
[1:42:24] shouted for joy that's why we can enjoy
[1:42:28] it
[1:42:29] right now we were there
[1:42:32] [Applause]
[1:42:34] that's one of all the pleasures of life
[1:42:36] you thought you enjoyed a lot of things
[1:42:38] in this life
[1:42:39] but it left you empty
[1:42:42] but when he comes when he ministers to
[1:42:46] your life
[1:42:47] when you meet him personally that's when
[1:42:50] real joy
[1:42:51] it's not a joy that any man can take
[1:42:54] from you
[1:42:56] no man can take this joy from you this
[1:42:59] is a joy
[1:43:00] that comes from god
[1:43:04] it's placed in the heart of the believer
[1:43:07] i know in whom i have believed i
[1:43:11] persuaded that he's able
[1:43:12] to keep that which i've committed unto
[1:43:15] him against that day
[1:43:17] amen
[1:43:20] you're not going to fail
[1:43:35] the word is what is anointing our life
[1:43:38] are you hearing me cast aside your
[1:43:41] thoughts
[1:43:43] lay them down you're anointed and
[1:43:46] ordained
[1:43:48] not to fail
[1:43:52] enter into that assurance enter into
[1:43:55] that reality

[1:52:08] edition the last account of that stamp
[1:52:12] being sold
