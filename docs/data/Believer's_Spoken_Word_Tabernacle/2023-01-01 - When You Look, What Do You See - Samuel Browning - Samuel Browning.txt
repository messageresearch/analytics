come more in my life amen I want him to come more amen just become more real amen more more dedicated we don't know we don't even know the challenges that lay before us in this year but we know that he said he'd never leave us nor forsake us that's why David could say I just David said I just commit my times into his hands and that's a blessed that's a blessed place to our lives to be placed is in his hands because we can think and speculate about a lot of things hey let's just be honest this past year a lot of things that through Our Lives individually and church and on and on there's a lot of things that transpire but you know what nothing took God by surprise through every test or every trial through everything God is faithful and we're standing here this morning because of his grace the grace that brought us to this place is the same Grace that will take us on home it's more than words of a song it's a reality it's a reality he's he's leading us he's guiding us he's keeping us he's directing us what a comfort that is soon and very soon we're going home we're going home amen don't you loving this morning and what a privilege it is just to serve the Lord amen so good to see different ones for the Josh God bless you amen different ones of some other good sister Chrissy God bless you man good to see some different ones back that I know that have been out with sickness and and things like that and you know Believe It or Not flu still exists believe it or not a common cold still exists you know and uh you know so uh we just we thank God for his Mercy amen for his healing touch amen for his strength you know in our lives you know you know you look at things it's very interesting because even over um I don't want to take too much time but it's very interesting some of you probably looked at these things but the uh you know even when they look at it and they'll let you know it's necessary for sickness for your body to build immunity and you know that time and you've seen a lot even with children things like that where everything was so closed off and closed up and it was just like things came and knocked people off their feet that normally would not have knocked us off our feet but it's just it's something and you know when you look at that and even in the spiritual realm that's why there's things that comes around our way but you know what it does every test and every trial we don't come weaker through every test and every trial he put strength in US we grow stronger and stronger amen amen now we don't maybe feel stronger but what the strength is is him in US amen less of us and more of him amen you love him this morning amen you don't want to go to sleep do you okay I trust you won't amen God bless you amen let's just look to the Lord here in a word of prayers we prepare to open the word of God Amen this morning and let's just look to him Heavenly Father Lord how we thank you Lord for this privilege Lord and opportunity that we have Lord to be able to gather together Lord once again Lord in your presence father Lord we have need of you Lord we need to hear from you father oh God you know Lord even Lord questions on our hearts you know things that Lord that we are facing or will be facing Lord you know every need Lord and oh my Lord how that you're so mindful to take account of each need Lord and to come in such a personal way that Lord that's beyond my mind of understanding Lord I I can't understand how that Lord you come into a congregation Lord and no matter what the size is but you'll come Lord and you'll speak so personally to every heart that's a paradox Lord I I just know that you do it Lord and I just welcome you Lord we welcome you here this morning that Lord once again you would take Lord this vessel of clay and the gift you've placed in my life Lord to be able to get out of the way and Lord I I'm just Desiring to do that Lord completely to get out of the way and the gift you've placed in the hearts of the people Lord oh God to look Beyond the Veil and and to believe and to hear your voice Lord we we need you this morning Lord I'm asking God for that anointing of the Holy Spirit to fall afresh upon us the Lord and Lord God may we be lifted Lord out of this since-bound realm Lord God for we have need of you Lord it was there in that presence Lord that Moses received Lord in just a few moments what was needed to go down their lord into Egypt and to withstand all the tides Lord of doubt and accusation and everything that would try to flood but God what he found there Lord it carried him through and it was you that led your people out so this morning Lord may you just come in a personal way Lord God and may I pray Lord just speak to our hearts Lord you know what is before us Lord and we just go ahead and testify heaven and say Lord you're more than enough Lord for whatever it is the Lord that is upon my heart or in my life in my home job wherever it might be you are more than enough Lord so I just come to present myself Lord and and just look to you oh God for you're the satisfier and the dissolver Lord of every doubt Lord may you just come in a special way this morning Lord we give ourselves unreservedly to you now Lord for the glory of God we ask it Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen may God bless you if we could turn in the word to Luke chapter 2. I want to make an announcement as you're turning there I haven't made this announcement I kind of held off for a little bit just waiting uh to get the go-ahead with it but we've I've known about it for a year probably some of you have known of it as well but our brother Joshua is going to be getting married now it's not an invisible bride it's not a mail-order bride but this is why last year you've seen him go a few different times and to make that trip to to Congo he's he's marrying a sister by the name of sister Sharon and forgive me I just say it in just the plain hillbilly English way not Sharon sister Sharon I just call him brother Joshua but uh you know uh sister Sharon this is uh the the daughter of uh who was brother Joshua's Pastor when he was there in Congo and so um as they had been communicating and brother Joshua had went over there made two trips at the end of the year uh last year did you go over this year at all yet so he hasn't he didn't go over this year at all yet and and that's not by the way that's just not an um 45 minute drive either what is it like 20 some hours almost yeah yeah those are the that's a long way yeah have been on how many been on a flight like that before I've been on a flight like that to the Philippines and you got to remind yourself to get up and walk around on the plane and excuse me excuse me pardon me excuse me get up and walk around I just go stand somewhere on the plane but so anyhow they're getting married on February 26th and so she's in the process our brother everything that has been filed for her to uh come here all of that was started last December so um I know he's been Faithfully checking everything on his phone as we talk and all that whole process so I want you just to continue to keep that in prayer and God will just make a way for that because it's nearing that those that time in that moment and uh so if you've seen just a bigger smile on his face here since last uh December you know why and it's just got bigger every time he and I are sitting down it's just I tell you just I don't know why we love you brother Joshua amen and we so anxiously await amen for sister Sharon to join join here with you and with us and so we just want to just wanted to make that announcement and just to keep that in prayer amen may God may God originally bless you all amen Luke chapter 2 verse 7. and rather than I've had you standing here for a moment so if you don't mind let me just read a scripture then we'll allow you to have your seats as I continue to read in Luke chapter 2 verse 7 and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a Manger because there was no room for them in the End Amen may the Lord bless the reading of the word as you're being seated if you wouldn't mind I'd like to continue to read here in the scriptures amen in verse just continuing right there in verse 8. and there and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over the flock by night I want you just to remind remember I I um last week as we started into the thought guided to the word made flesh I'm not going to background on that but it was dealing with and the wise men and we brought it we got it to a certain place of what we were speaking to of coming to being led to that of the word made flesh and so here we pick up with the Shepherds and we realize these are two two separate um uh accounts the Shepherds were there at the birth but the wise men did not come until two years later but we're still we're focused on the same glorious event that has that has taken place so let's in verse 8 there were in the the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord Shone round about them and they were sore afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people For unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you you shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the Heavenly Host praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace Good Will toward men and verse 15 and it came to pass as the Angels were gone away from them into heaven this is I wanted just to hone in on this right here as the Angels were gone away from them into heaven the shepherd said one to another let us now go even unto Bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass which the Lord hath made known unto us so this message has been declared and they are responding to it and say what we've heard let us go see it and once you remember even when the event of the disciples let me just let me just Traverse a little bit forward here when the disciples were standing there and the Lord Jesus after his resurrection and he's taken up and he ascends up after after being there with them for 40 days upon the Earth and walking around after his resurrection remember he he ascends and they're standing there I mean you know they're already it's been Supernatural event after Supernatural event after Supernatural event on and on through the 40 days but you know here you're saying here is one you're beholding this and you're just seeing here he is is Raising and he's rising up and he's ascending and remember as they're standing there beholding that the Angels spoke to them and said why are you standing here gazing I mean they were looking at a tremendous event but remember when he Ascend when he's ascending now it's time for the Holy Spirit to be poured out right so now the angels that remind them hey you need to stop just looking at it you need to go become one with it so there's a there's a part when we see this that the Shepherds they heard it but now it was called they were drawn to the place or they moved to say Let's go see what the Lord hath made known unto us I think that's a great way to approach everything is Lord what you've spoke to me I want to see it I want to see it in my life I want to see that word come to pass in my life and the Bible said they came with haste and they found Mary and Joseph and the Babe lying in a manger and when they had seen it they made known the saying abroad and said what was told them concerning this child and all they that heard it wandered at those things which were told them by the Shepherds but Mary kept all these things and she pondered them in her heart and the Shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen as it was told unto them I want you to think of this in this moment of where that you and I are standing even in this moment because I want you to think that how that we can look at the Bible we can look at the scriptures and we recognize that the Bible it's not just a book of History but it's a book of Prophecy it's where that when we read the scriptures we're not reading about events that have taken place in the past where there's no connection to it whatsoever but it we are reading the Bible and not just reading we're seeing the Bible because the spirit of God the author that moved through the lives of these individuals that moved upon the prophets to write all the same God is the same God who comes and he pours himself into his word and makes it alive to where that you and I are not looking at it as history we recognize it is prophecy of Our Lives because there's one goal that God has had through the entire scriptures and the spirit of Truth the holy spirit that has come to think of how that God would would promise that he would deliver the spirit of Truth to lead and guide us into all truth and as I shared this with you this little bit of where we're going uh from some weeks ago and standing here on a Sunday right after the service and it's just the holy spirit's so stirring in my hearts my heart after that service of the precious and and blessed reality that God has given that we might be able to be led to the place of a real true birth to where we can have a real Assurance in God where we can have a no-so where we can have that of a of a real full reality and I I just don't take that for granted because all around there's a there's so much confusion and if not for the spirit of Truth you and I would be in that same confusion it is the grace of almighty God in this hour of where we're standing it's just like for the wise men they were guided where they were guided because of the Heavenly sign and it drew upon them it didn't draw upon every every Magi it didn't draw upon everyone as a matter of fact not everybody saw it they saw it because they were ordained to see it they couldn't help but see it and it moved them it caused them to forsake and lay aside and even put their lives at risk because it was something that meant more to them that sign and look they weren't just something following blindly they recognized when they saw it they seen it this is what was prophesied in the word and I'm seeing it identified this was a star should arise out of Jacob and they followed that there was there was an assurance in their lives and it was guiding them to the word made flesh and I want to say it like this Paul over and over here Paul is given the commission to come among the Gentiles to take this light that the hold of Satan and darkness that is upon the Gentiles would be driven back would be broken by the Light Of God as God would come and make known and declare the mystery that he had hidden himself from the beginning of before the world ever began and remember how Paul Paul will speak of this in the book of Ephesians as the mystery of God and you'll speak of this mystery that's been committed to me and the whole mystery is Paul brings it all the way down in Colossians chapter 1 that this mystery that Paul is speaking of it's God letting you and I know the full purpose and the full counsel what everything has spoken about is God God's desire to dwell in man once again that's what it's all been about is that God would come down and God would Tabernacle deity would once again be failed in flesh Hallelujah and so God supplied his grace his grace supplied the leadership to the word made flesh and when I say the word made flesh I'm not just speaking of just looking at the word made flesh in Jesus Christ or the word made flesh through the prophet or the word made flesh through your mother or the word may flesh through your father or the word may flesh through your pastor I'm saying the word made flesh in you that's what we've been guided to so when we think of that you know the way it's not an easy way the way to the word may flesh in our life I'm a witness of that it's a journeying because you know why you got to let go of your own ideas we've had to die to ourself you see nothing else could bring about a death except the Water of Life the water that raises up that seed on the inside is the same water that causes rot to our ideas it rots it eats away and our thoughts our ideas it eats away at that old first nature nothing else could bring that rot But the Water of Life because every other water would a cistern water would tell you it's all right you're good but we needed the Water of Life that would actually begin to just tear down and take away everything of of this because really that first nature that's the hindrance that's the Trap that is the prison house that is the garbage dump that is the rubbish Heap that is the past house and that's why we need and have needed God's grace to come to you and I to Lift Us in a real true birth that's why I'm brother random let me just read this to you as I as I begin to just set the stage here he says it is your life and his life they find one another not at a church not at a building not at a Creed not in good works notice his life and your life right his life in your life but where we find is in the cross where we are crucified with him that's where you find Christ you don't find him by doing better turning a new page starting a new life you don't find Christ you find Christ only in death not in a Manger not in a confession but to be nor to believe in certain Creeds and fables you don't find Christ there but to think a true servant is one that is going to take you to him and he's the word a person could say Christ is on Earth today but a real servant will take you to him because he's here in the form of his word and it is the word that brings life because he is the word and a true servant will take you there is the pathway easy it's not an easy way it's not and it's not the way that is the choice of the world it is a harder way it's a choice that must be made in every individual has to make that choice there's decisions that we're making even here this morning and a real true servant anointed by the spirit of God leads or directs or takes us and points us to that place of where the word is made flesh he is the word he's the Bible made living and when you die to yourself with Christ like a corner wheat then the word lives in you and it brings forth the same results as it did in that living corn of wheat that had to drop into the Earth I want you to think of the scripture here in Isaiah 7 14. I just I'd love to read all the scriptures that surround it because there's a battle going on a war but this is God's answer verse 14 therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel which is God With Us or with us is God what a what a sign that God would give now think about there's been many signs that when we think because this prophecy has was spoken concerning of the coming of the Messiah and there's been many many many signs that men remember man is is looks for signs and there's been many signs that have been placed out there that Proclaim safety uh we've seen it you know from uh you know well maybe not not many of us we've not seen the whole thing with the Titanic but we've heard it and we've heard things where things have well this is going to be the newest and best thing and this is going to be and and everything itself it fails and think of even with the Titanic when they said this is a ship that even God can't sing just like the Tower of Babel they were making a Tower of Babel everything notice when they made that statement regarding the Titanic yet they were tempting God but they were proclaiming it was a place of safety but God showed them there is no place of safety there is no works of man that is a place of safety there's only one provided place of safety and to think all the signs all the achievements that's ever been done because we're reading about the sign that God had given and God said I'm going to give you an eternal sign a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel I want you to think of that question why was it a baby and that's a simple question but it's a very it's a very important question why was it that it had to become a baby had to become so simple that God said I will give you a sign and it's going to be a super sign now think of it this was this is God's super sign and the world would laugh at it a Super Saiyan the devil would laugh at it a super sign but yet this God is is coming down where he's going to live with his people in a super sign and you know this sign right here it would not just be a sign for that day but it would be a sign for every day it would be a sign for the day that you and I are living in right now now think of it in this way I want you to understand this he is the way but Samuel that's simple I know that but he is the way God never entrusted the way to nobody else when the fall came in Eden God never sent nobody else he came himself he came down to see he knew what had taken place but God came down to come to come and to move on the behalf of man now I want you to think of this he is the way God has given many signs you know how precious it is that God would give a sign even when it looks like through that of Noah God would give a sign through Noah and it would be a sign that when God would prepare and have an art prepared for safety for those who were wanting and Desiring to escape judgment that message that God would send that sign if it would be a sign of judgment for all who wanted to reject the word but it would be a sign of Mercy for all that would say that would heed to that word and enter into that place of safety think about this when it would come to the burning bush think of how that they would stand there at the burning bush sure Moses met God there God dealing with Moses but think about what God was saying in a sign there was a sign that was being given and God was letting the people know in that hour that I am a covenant keeping God I have remembered my word what a confidence because that sign itself has never ceased every time God comes on the scene it is God letting you and I know I have not forgot about my promise what I've said I'm here to fulfill that it didn't matter how much bondage they were in it didn't matter how dark it looked it didn't matter how Bleak it was God let him know I'm a covenant-keeping God and I've come down to deliver it's a sign of delivering sign that was taking place there at the burning bush think of how when God would come down think of how it you know brother Brandon would play it so plain like this he said think of how God when he created heavens and earth he spoke to the angels around and said let us he said but when God came down in the Plan of Redemption God came all by himself all by himself he came in the Plan of Redemption and to think of how through the Red Sea let's look at that for a moment I I tell you when I think of this brother random would say it like this if I just want to read this he said this sign at the Red Sea God showed that he would make a way for those who were trying to do right and follow his commandment oh my that's shouting grounds right there that was a sign that God said I will make a way for those who are trying to do right and desire to follow my word no matter what cuts it off God proved that the Red Sea and gave a sign that he could open the Red Sea in every Temptation he'll make a way of Escape mother don't believe it Daddy don't believe it the church don't believe it I don't care who don't believe it if you believe it God Will Make A Way of Escape he gave a sign that he word they were on their way straight to the promised land where God promised them and the Red Sea shut them off and they got in trouble remember what the people wanted to do they wanted to go back oh man the Way's too hard look you brought us out here to kill us but Moses didn't bring you out God brought you out [Applause] amen Moses his life the word made flesh there was a sign of what God was leading you to the same victory that Moses had that pulsated in his life that when discouragement Rose in the house discouragement Rose in the church discouragement Rose all around he had a victory a fire that the devil couldn't put out there was a victory in his life Glory when the Red Sea shut him off and they got in trouble they didn't know what to do God showed that he'd make a way of Escape in every Temptation in every trial you can't quit smoking take God one time you can't quit lying can't quit stealing can't quit having a temper you can add you can just add on in there take god with you one time if you don't feel like going to church and you can't get anywhere take god with you one time take his promise he proved at the Red Sea he'll make a way of Escape God has many signs now when we read about the birth of the Lord Jesus remember it was in the time right close to the birth when a persecution arose hear the baby was here it was at the time to be delivered the pressure the persecution all that was rising at that time the taxation you must go back to your place of nativity and they had to get back there it had to be in Bethlehem God knew that everything was arranged it wasn't happening maybe with all the ways that they thought and it's just you and I can relate to that there's things that has happened that we did not look at or expect for it to happen this way and that's the same way with the Rapture we're expecting the Rapture is that right and I'm sure that God in every little place and every Junction of time there are going to be things we do not know about but oh if we can just be in step with him we're ready when that next step comes but here they were a pressure arose a persecution arose and there's spread there's things that in the midst of the time that when that is being formed in your life think about this in your in in your own life to where when you are dying and you're coming to life there's a pressure they'll have things where friends will turn against you and family and everything else will come against you and Satan will do all he can what's he trying to do stifle that life from coming to a full birth he would like to hinder the prophecy of the word that's why Paul could say I travail in Christ together until now until Christ be formed in you Paul was identifying there there is a work within the Life coming to a full birth which is the word made flesh and Paul said I'm laboring under that leadership of the Holy Spirit that's pointing you leading you directing you to a real victory in your life that's encouraging you when Associates and everything else around says this is too much right now I got to get this taken care of and I'll never be able to get Beyond this and now no keep pressing that's the moment to press that's not the moment to pull back that's the moment to press Hallelujah it's not the moment to pull back away from the word it's a time to press on it's a time to press here it's a time to go beyond our own feelings we're in the hour of the press the Press is on we're in the hour of the press to press on to Perfection everything that you and I receive from God in our life will not be given out on a silver spoon that everything we get from God every promise it's going to be a battle we're not wrestling against God our battle is with our own selves and allowing the enemy to come and to hinder and move upon the flesh move upon the spirit move upon the mind but everything we get that is worth getting it will require a press in this hour it's easy to live a lukewarm life the rest of the world is living a lukewarm life but it takes a press in this hour to stay on fire for God brother Sammy I got fire in my soul but you got to keep that fire Kendall you've got to press against everything that wants to try to stifle that you've got to press against it think about how God think about this I just love it God could have fully Could Have Become a fully matured man but he didn't God came down and they gave a sign and that sign that God he became a baby I want you to notice where these where the Shepherds were directed they were directed by the message you'll find him in the stable that's where you'll find him so they were going to have to Journey from where they were on the hillside to go to where the word had told them to go if they were hearing the word and would have never moved they'd have never saw the word that they had heard made flesh now I want to just I know probably the title's up there but I want to just re remind you just this this is the thought it's on my heart when you look what do you see when you look what do you see when we look in upon this word what do you see you see because the world you know from these past weeks and on and on and uh I I don't have nothing against going to Israel I'd like to go someday myself but you know I it's not not necessary but I'd like to do it but you know how many would you know wanting to go and or if we can just go to Behold a Manger if we can just go to behold that that's not where he's at that's not where he's at that was only a sign of what he wanted to do in you where will I find him notice the word would come where we would find him we will find him wrapped in a swaddling cloth and we'll find him there in a Manger think of how that God borrowed the womb of a woman God came down himself God supplied both sperm and egg and God brought forth a tabernacle his own dwelling his own Tabernacle God that that creation which was a creation of God and God would bring that forth and God would step down God would borrow the womb of a woman the very God of Glory would come down and become one of us and God would be veiled in his creation and in that creation here it would reveal God's glory would be revealed as Emmanuel think about it he who is the creator of heavens and earth he and whom the earth and the fullness thereof belongs to him he who is beyond all riches he who it speaks his riches are unsearchable he who it is that brought forth everything that was needed in this earth he's the one who put it here whether it be the oil the gold on and on he put it here but he who was The Riches of them all he became poor he came down for you and me and the way that he chose to do it he didn't choose to come as a fully matured man God had appeared and come down in flesh many times and there had been visitations and we could go on through that in the Old Testament but the difference was it was not in the Fulfillment of the prophecy that God's told the woman I will give thee a seed and thy seed shall bruise the head of the serpent but God had to borrow in order to display his riches God became one of us I want you to think of this how brother Brandon would place this here I I just I find this very striking he says how God he said I think when God With Heaven in his mind of what would be appealing to the human being appealing to the human being it is to the believer it is appealing when our God becomes one of us that's appealing to the believer when God becomes one of us is that right that's appealing but you know he says to think how that God would cross himself and become our dust that he would become our stock a human stock the Creator who made all things oh he said how the word was made dust flesh and dwelt Among Us Jehovah the word became human became dust and tabernacled with us an everlasting sign that shall never end that was only the beginning true he came he didn't become a fully matured man he came as a baby why there had to be a birth it was speaking to you and I that that's the word itself was made flesh it came in a very simple manner because it was going to bring to you and I what was needed we needed a birth we needed to be born again we didn't need to be made over we'd have the same flaws the same issues we needed a birth is that right this is why in order to get that life to you and I in order for the price to be paid God himself had to come down and he went through every stage of life he knows what it's like as a boy he knows what it's like as a teenager he knows what every step of the way is like he knows the pressures he knows the Temptations He knows all of those things and he did that he did that for Redemption for you and I that when that word has you and I can look to that and that word all becoming flesh in our life what is it it's once again the same God walking in a Linda veil of a teenager God walking through the veil of a young man a young lady a man and a woman the same God veiled in his creation glory be to God in the highest it was Abraham's faith that United the spirit and the flesh together that's why this poke it is Abraham's seed when he came he took not on the nature of angels but he took upon Him Abraham's seed uniting the Flesh and the spirit together I don't know about you but anytime you've ever borrowed anything or maybe you've had somebody borrow something from you I know we've always had people we had to go back and ask hey you uh you you asked to borrow that right it wasn't donated oh yeah yeah yeah so borrow borrow means to temporarily use it means it's been surrendered I mean because look if somebody goes in to your house and I don't you know Albert Sammy We're All brothers and sisters here y'all know but I'd probably get your dander rougher a little bit if I went in there and took your favorite broom I said Oh Brother Ray won't mind this you know he's my brother in Christ right you'll know about that in a little bit but you see right it's different if I come and I ask and say brother do you mind would you can I borrow that song I don't just go into his house and take it that's called theft are you hearing me now God's not a thief the Bible said a thief and a robber cometh to kill and destroy but he has come that we might have life more abundantly he borrowed a womb he didn't force himself upon Mary he made his word known and Mary said how is this going to be how is this going to happen how's this going to come to pass he said here's how this sign will be produced in your life the Holy Ghost shall over Shadow thee what was happening as the word was being spoken the spirit of God was drawing upon her life not taking from her but causing her to yield you may borrow my life whoa oh he borrowed the womb just the same way that he borrows our bodies sure this body this body itself is not is not what God had in mind even though the picture on the the album is when when we were in the best of our of our time but that was before this negative there was a positive you don't have a negative I know a lot of young people they don't know what negatives are maybe some others but you know we used to have back in the days called a camera and it wasn't on the phone and I'm not talking about the Polaroids either but you know there had to be you'd have negatives and if you got a negative you could take that negative and go have another picture made and it was better than taking you know maybe some other picture you took that negative but the only way you got a negative is because it was taken from a positive is that right there was a picture taken before the foundation of the world amen that's not the negative that's the positive but that positive had been deposited down here and though this is the negative it's bearing the reflection of the positive that I always was a son or daughter of God this is just a borrowed body glory be to God and one of these days think about it where my body and my flesh flesh you know Body Spirit where he gives me such fits and you know it doesn't want me to pray it wants me to be lazy it wants me to read it wants me come on now I'm not just talking to me you know he wants to get into that oh you know you just need to relax and and this and that oh you know you don't need to go to church I mean hey you get somebody else you know you're kind of tired and this and that that old body if I gave into that it wouldn't be so easy but one of these days this body that I have borrowed and said hey buddy I need to borrow you today because I need to use your voice chords the Holy Spirit has put something in my heart I need to borrow you yeah but what am I going to get in return I'll tell you what you're going to get in return one of these days what you have yielded there's gonna come a sweep over this life and what has been surrendered in a borrowed way will be changed to match what's happened on the inside oh you're talking about a super sign an everlasting sign I want to ask you can he borrow your life can he borrow your body can he use your life to be a witness come on now don't get quiet on me can he usually think about it can he can he use your life to be a witness to your family to your Associates it will your life can he borrow it will it Point them there is a real real reality of deity to be tabernacled in flesh now remember there's a lot of other signs but before before we get any other sign because remember there's signs that are in the scripture such as speaking in tongues prophecy a lot of those things in there and God put them in and God didn't take them out but God never gave any any of those as the delivering sign praying for the sick and you know healing Miracle healings and broken Miracles but but there's one sign that is the super sign it's the greatest sign it's the sign that is above every other sign it's that sign that must be sought after first and that's the sign that God gave originally and that's of the Holy Ghost coming into the life and transforming it then everything else as he has needs of it it'll go you're saying brother Sammy what I'm saying that our experience is not based on any other sign it's based on the sign of the word made flesh in our life come on now that's what God God brought us a deliverance from that because look God delivered you and I from a confusion that we might walk with a fearlessness a boldness that we might have boldness Before the Throne of God that I know that the sin question has been settled I know that my life has been changed why because there has come a new creation on the inside in my life think of how they moved in when such a such a haste in that time you know think of how that God when he came to the Shepherds you know it didn't bother them I mean you know how how within it all God bypassed the theologians bypassed so he bypassed all of them he didn't go down to Jerusalem and but God here that here came on that here was Shepherds that was out there on the hillside by biting with their sheep they were doing what they were supposed to be doing and notice what happened here the Angels Came and began to announce to them let me tell you what's taken place in Bethlehem as they can ring out and say I want you to go to Bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass the Lord hath made known these things that that here it is you'll find him you'll find the one that is to bring great joy the one that is a savior is born go and you'll find him you know what the call was is that you will see the word made flesh if they wouldn't have went they'd have never saw the word made flesh they couldn't go halfway and see the word made flesh justification is not the word made flesh they couldn't just go to sanctification and the word be made flesh it had to come to a full experience with God to where now the word and now God's life our life has met up and now the word is made flesh his life dwelling in our life you know it didn't bother them because the message that was being given in that moment was that the Messiah is here now he's on Earth right now he ain't coming he's on Earth right now that was a great message to them he's here so if he's here where's the at I need to find him this announcement there's a savior you know why I need saving I need deliverance and saving is where to save me from my sins I need Deliverance I need what was promised to come fully in my life all the massage on Earth you know what it didn't bother them then they begin to bring out how the Angels begin to worship laughs you know the first time the Angels Was Heard singing was over in job oh I'm not going to get there but that was the first time they were singing there was in heaven but now when creation here was upon her arms and what was coming to Earth what the rejoicing was over there was the lamb being offered up to make a way back for the Sons and Daughters of God that's what the rejoicing was there but now on Earth hear the angels are singing and rejoicing because now that lamb that was that was projected there is now on Earth the way has come down why do I get happy why do I Rejoice I'm not just rejoicing because the way is here I'm rejoicing because the way is here I've met him I know him it's a joy the way home is assure it's a reality that's what brings joy in our hearts this is why we glorify God we're not glorifying God because we've heard a message we're glorified God because what I've heard I've seen and I see it in my own life I see this word working and it brings a joy in my life oh I'm not beside myself I'm not crazy yeah I've lost my mind but I've got the mind of Christ I've got something that's satisfied I've got something that keeps me I've got something that keeps and gives me joy when sadness is all around there is a victory so what do you see when you look and you behold the word may flesh what do you see what is it to you is it just a church is it just a message is it just more teaching what do you see you see they they didn't just see they didn't see a teaching but they saw the word may flesh you know what that was that was a sign that sign of the word made flesh it was a sign calling them to the purpose that God had for their lives God's desire to be made flesh in their life and that's God's desire in our lives that that word would be made flesh oh brother Brahm says I'll give them a sign I'll be in their flesh I'll be like them they'll be like me he told the angels to look over the Angels told the Shepherds go look in the manger and see and you'll see what I mean that sign wasn't just for Angels it wasn't just for Shepherds it's for the world to see and believe that God dwells in flesh and through the offering of that flesh he Sanctified our flesh that he might dwell within us God in you Christ in you think of how brother Brown says it like this well he said I've received some mighty fine Christmas presents a movie camera many other things guns and things that people love me and they gave me how I appreciate all that but all this eternal life the Blessed assurance that Christ lives in us that his fullness dwells within us makes us rise and act different that that's what when we really behold the word may flesh let me tell you something there are people in lives that set on the platform even when you look in the Deep calm the Deep that didn't recognize what it was all about there was even the men that could look like T.L Osborne and said when we saw William Branham we saw Jesus Christ speaking of that life reproduced again what was spoken in the Bible when brother Bosworth could make a statement and he would pull on the on the in in on the coattail of of brother Vale and say I have waited years to see the ministry of Jesus Christ reproduced and I've seen it right here I'm not just talking about because these are things in writing but you see what it is you know what it was a sign of it was evening lights God promised in the evening time there would be light what was that light about the light itself was not to where we come and we rally around the messenger you must hear the message but what is the message speaking about who is the message revealing what is the message calling us too the message did not call us to worship the prophet the worship the message that did not call us just to gather around a group of teachings but the real manifestation is God and Christ are one it's time for the marriage of the Lamb has come it's an everlasting sign it's an appealing sign it doesn't appeal to the world but it appeals to the evening light people because there's a longing in our hearts it was something we craved we longed for what was it it was for almighty God it was a deep calling to the Deep an everlasting sign God said I'll give him an everlasting sign the whole version shall conceive it was not a work of man it's not in the work of man in your life it's a work of the Holy Ghost it's God coming down in your life personally it's God coming down God bringing forth in our life his own life what do we see when we look what do we see I tell you what I see I see Jesus Christ I see the god of Glory that's what I see I see the God who is rich in Mercy that desires to bring Deliverance to every heart in every life I see a god who's greater than the birth of a Browning I see a god who's greater and you put your last name to it I see a God who is more than Mindful and mighty to take care of whatever the situation might be in my life hallelujah or it might be hard and these things are pointed out and this is pointed out and that's pointed out but remember when God's pointing things out you know what God's doing God is speaking to you and I he's letting us know don't stop there keep going go all the way don't stop when the holy spirit's speak into our life don't pull back let our ideas fade away let our thoughts fade away because when God has brought forth that Eternal sign in your life there is no devil no trial no task nothing can take that away it's an eternal sign it is the Seal of the Living God it's a circumcision that has been made without hands it is a birth and your life is the Nativity grounds that Christ is displayed through you look at all those parts when they put the nativity scene in let me just tell you what that is when we really look down in your own life you say brother Samuel my life my life a Manger yeah you know I was a Manger because a Manger was a stinking rotten place and I don't care how good you were how good I was or I was raised in a message church at first birth is a stinking rotten birth I don't care how long it's been that's where it come now he came down and was born in the fireless oh my the manure didn't stop him the stench didn't stop him it was an appointed place you don't have to worry about it Jesus gets in there the manure Fades away The Stance Fades away he gets born right there that's it oh I can't quit this I can't quit that just invite him in let him come in he's the one that brings the quit and brings you alive to where your life what comes out of your life when the word comes forth amen yes the Lord Jesus be it unto me Lord according to Thy word be it unto me Lord according to Thy word yes Lord Jesus let it be Lord in my life what's happening it's a crucifying the life I live now in the flesh it's not me it's living but it's Christ who liveth in me it's Christ in me the hope of glory you're talking about an eternal sign God Made A Way that you and I could have that real true experience a place where we can put our foot down where there's a place within our life that I know I've met God tell you we understand it's more it's not our works it's not what we could do we could never Merit his grace as he went searching all throughout he came into Bethlehem he came searching and no place no place was there any room but God knew where the place was going to be God knew in this age where the place would be God knew he had children in this hour whose lives oh would be you know it doesn't matter what everything you could stack up but God knew I've got a place that I've reserved there for myself oh it's not the life right now that they're living but I've come to redeem what belongs to me so when you look what do you see I tell you I see the Mighty God when you look in the manger of your heart I mean when you look into that manger of your heart what do you see do you see the Living God do you see the word may flesh do you see Christ in your in your life well brother Sammy I agree with all the words that's good but is that fulfillment of the works that I do shall you do also is that present is it the same life that he lived if it's the same life that he lived that's an eternal sign but if it's not there yet to the same life that he lived keep pressing I said keep pressing until it comes to that place and when that life has come in your life you've got to press beyond your doubts you got to press me on all your discouragements let me tell you something right now the very thing that you start moving away Satan wants you to move away from prayer he wants you to move away from playing getting into the message and playing it I tell you I'm telling you brothers and sisters there's a power within that I sit there and as I'm as I'm listening or I'm walking having it going I tell you it's a channel it's an inspiration that just comes and it just moves let me tell you something you're setting an atmosphere in your home what do you want to invite in your home come on now there's going to be channels and things that are going to try to move into your home what do you want in your home if you want angels to visit I'm telling you get into the message start praying just put the message on and play the message just say God Lead Me Lord Lord speak to me you know what I have needed I think that's a good way to start this year out I think it's a good way to say you know what Lord I'm going to consecrate myself into that life on the inside I want that baby remember he wasn't born a fully matured man you're not born fully matured but it is a birth and you grow to maturity but you've got to feed that inner man on the things of God there's things you and I as we started out as a little a little baby or a little kid a little toddler even things right now I look back to my daddy and them and told me when I was a teenager I didn't understand why they were saying it I knew they were talking with an urgency I didn't understand it at that time now I do I understand it you know why I've grown to that place I understood what they were talking about that's the same way it is as we're growing in Jesus Christ but make sure you've had that birth on the inside where your Nature has been changed and then feed yourself with the word of God let the word of God change your life let it transform you from Glory unto Glory unto Glory let the sheer be a declaration in your heart in your life what do I see when I'm looking in there what do I see I want to look in and I want to behold his Beauty I don't want to just come to church I want to Behold Him I want to give myself to him I want that word perfect and change my life I want to give myself to it I don't want to just come and hear it and go away I want to give myself to the word I want to take that word Lord I want to see what you've said I want to go with haste and I want to look in upon that word I'm going to look upon that word because what I give myself to look upon I will become all right let's bar heads Hallelujah oh precious Jesus Hallelujah Hallelujah oh Hallelujah glory be to God Lord Jesus what a moment Lord that we're living in we're not Lord living in history we're living in the present you are the I am that I am not the I was that I was you are the I am he which was which is and which is to come father as we look back lord hear over your word and we see God of the signs that you've given signs like that of the red seed to be an encouragement to our life oh God to encourage us walk on keep pressing on whatever's trying to hinder you or hold you back I gave a sign I am your Waymaker I'll make a way into the promises I'm the one who's leading you to the word may flesh in your life granted Lord father as we take those signs we receive them and we move and we act upon that word Lord oh God how we are so thankful Lord that father we are not reading Isaiah 7 14 as a as a historical event but we know that God through that birth that God you have come

just as much may that light Upon Our Lives let it be that it points in our homes Families Our Associates let it be that it's it's a light that's pointing our life is leading others to Jesus Christ as an announcement that the same God that has come here that you you wonder and you you look and say what makes you different or what church you belong to or what there's something about it that I I want that same reality that you have I I may not be able to explain it but I want that same reality I believe that's in our homes I want that same reality I want that same perseverance I want that I want that that where there's a fire that's living in your life Daddy I want that fire that's living in your life that's what I want our lives what is it doing pointing them to the word made flesh but you see it's not pointing people to a Manger it's not pointing them to a prophet it's not pointing them to a pastor it's not pointing him to a church not pointing them to a deacon I believe the word ought to be made flesh in every life but all of that is pointing to God's desire to be made flesh in your life that's what it's all about if our life is the correct billboard and display for Jesus Christ what it's displaying and crying out God in Christ are one there's a real experience there's a God who desires to move down the Living God and dwell in Tabernacle in your life what do I have to do let him borrow let him have say Lord I turn my life over to you well brother Samuel I've got these Ambitions let him borrow them turn them over to him I've got these dreams dream over to him let him borrow him he can do more in his hands that little lad's lunch would have only fed him but when he got in the hands of Jesus it fed a multitude and not only did it feel in being a multitude there was some worship going on afterwards they had 12 baskets to pick up because what he does he multiplies it shows there's no end to this life there's no end the same Holy Ghost he gave he gives it the same way it's with the same strength the same power the same Glory the same Authority he keeps on giving it [Applause] and you know what after it's all said and done every time there's 12 baskets 12 is worship there's always worship when he comes oh glory be to God Lord I give you my all I give you my all Lord this this year Lord God my heart's desire Lord I give you my whole Lord I want a fresh

pour out your power and love as we see foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] so glad I'm Yours Hallelujah you know I think as we come into this this moment even in this year and rededication and renewal you know it's a wonderful time to even you start out and reading your Bible and I know we say well but the same I read my Bible and I well I trust we do but I you know it's it's one of those times that I found for myself over the years here just taking I because it's easy for me to get out on the trail and just start studying and I don't I want to just read sometimes there's times of study I'll get into that and it's just I can get going on that but you know I'm talking about where you just take the Bible and read it through in a year it's still hard during those times but I've I've done it in a manner the reason I've done it I've shared that with you before just so it keeps me just just focused on this and I just have that that look that that little bit of time that is right there and then of course you know I I studied things will just run out after that but there's so many things available to us so many apps that are available I've used apps I've used things that just keep things that and it's good I'll tell you what I I will say this to you there have been many times where I've done that because I can stay just focused on this but there's been so many times where different things out of right then and there things will strike and then what starts being ministered right here is things that's coming right out of the devotion in the morning because the Holy Spirit just starts to move right on the scriptures and and different things and there's messages I haven't even preached from a few years ago of just some things just that was striking in there but what I'm just saying in this manner make it a purpose make it a purpose don't don't try to listen don't try to be well I'm going to read it I'm going to read this much no even if you start with something you know just start if you start with the Book of Matthew wherever you're going to start at but just turn out to that I think it ends up being what 85 verses a day or something like that you might think that's very carnal but I'll tell you what in order to have a fire you've got to have wood you got to have wood and sometimes it's just a little bit of an accountability of something like that that you can you can look at I'll tell you what it's been a blessing just going through because I'll tell you what the message it's God's light this Bible has become a new book you see it all the way through and I just would just set yourself upon that say God I'm just going to dedicate myself just let just let God let God bring forth the results let him bring forth the results just give ourselves to him and I think what a song that we can sing I'd like to sing that song Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus a lot of distractions a lot of things will try to get our attention and you know what just set our hearts up on this I'm not going to give my time and energy to things I can't even change you know what I'm saying I mean you ain't gonna change politics you ain't gonna change no sports team or you know you're rooting for them ain't gonna do you ain't gonna let's give our thing let's give ourselves to the things that matter let's give ourselves say Lord I want to just reconsecrate myself to the things that matter I I believe I believe this right here I know it to be true that if we consecrate ourselves more to him all the other things in life the anxieties the frustrations and that'll just go because that is a result of those things but if we just turn our eyes upon him you'll you'll find the peace of God just moving in you'll find your approach only one that there won't be problems but you'll just find your approach to things and you know what I don't know but I know God's going to make a way and you'll even be looking at yourself and say wow is that me acting that way no that's the word have an effect on your life you're inviting the word to have an effect on your life well I think one of the greatest things the Lord blessed me the Lord make his face to shine upon glory be to God the Lord be gracious to you the Lord be merciful the Lord keep you watch over you watch over us this year you're loving let's sing this as a as a dedication as we would prepare to go from this place it's been good to be here hasn't it been good to be with each of you amen God bless you I can't think of anybody else I'd rather spend the new year with amen just think one of these days we're all going to be gathered at that table says a thousand miles long I don't know how long it's going to be but I'm just glad that I'll get to be there you know what I'll be rejoicing oh brother Samuel I'll tell you maybe I'll be able to set across from David no I I want to shake David's hand but I'll tell you what would be a real blessing if I get to sit across the people from you Hallelujah I want to see David I want to see the rest of them but we get to sit across the table from one another and say wasn't it worth it all wasn't it worth it all every every pressing every pressing and yielding and allowing him to borrow our lives it has been worth it all glory be to God in the highest lead us brother Brian Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus let's sing it through one time before in his wonderful Faith Lord let every distraction be put to the side and the things they fade out in the light of this Glory turn your eyes [Music] Upon Jesus [Music] it is [Music] and the things over will grow strange like them in the light of his glory and grace [Music] Upon Jesus Jesus [Music] and the things [Music] they do in the Bloods of his glory and Grace yes turn your eyes Upon Jesus [Music] in his one faith [Music] and
