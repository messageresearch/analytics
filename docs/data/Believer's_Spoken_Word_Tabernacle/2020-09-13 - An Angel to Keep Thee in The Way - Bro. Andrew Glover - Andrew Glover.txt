changed my soul and now i know i need you so [Music] amen and amen aren't you glad for that this morning amen it's just it's so good to be a christian it's good to be in the house of the lord amen there is always something good that happens when jesus comes there's always something good happens when jesus comes and we're just expecting him to come every day we're expecting him to come we're living in the time of his coming amen so if he doesn't come in corporal body here this morning i've been counting on him that he is among us and he'll wrap himself in a veil called andrew glover he'll minister to our hearts as part of his bride i'm expecting him to come in our midst this morning we are living in the time of his coming amen it's just such a wonderful and awesome time and out there no it's not it's a terrible horrible dark time but this is the grandest time to ever be living it's the greatest hour amen oh the the hour for the bride of jesus christ it's not going to get worse it's only going to get greater amen greater and greater and greater and i'm just so thankful for god's grace in this hour his mercy amen and you know when we look at that in in this song that we're singing brother branham would tell us it's so fitting he would say it like this and it's the rising of the sun he said that little eagle that was down there in that barnyard he needed to hear more than just stories about an eagle he needed to see one that was just like him and that's what we need to see we really can catch a hold of that of what this message is it's jesus christ revealed to our hearts this is not doctrine it's not theology it's it's not just teaching this is jesus christ revealed in power and glory and it reveals to us of who we really are amen we're on our way back home we've met our melchizedek amen we're going home amen glory be to god so let's just pull on the gift of god the service this morning and then the lord willing here again once again tonight at six o'clock and i can tell you one word that just has been moving on my heart even as we were just meditating on some things yesterday is the word investment and you know we there's there's things that sometimes uh as individuals we can or people can invest in and whatever you invest in is what you esteem to be a value you know sometimes a person will give their money and invest and they'll invest in this certain thing maybe it's something they buy for their house or whatever you have if you have a fixed a value that that was worth all of that money all of your blood all your sweat and everything that went in to obtain that there's an investment you made there's a part of it and i think that all of those things that you and i know of that many times they they are precious to us but there's something that is so far greater and that is eternal life there's something that's so much greater and that is what god is doing amongst his people and what what is added to our life there's an investment and i believe this morning i'm talking to wise investors i don't believe i'm talking to people that just you know like they say the money burning a hole in your pocket i believe i'm talking to people this morning that you have a wise investment and i say this morning and throughout this day let's so invest ourselves and just in prayer even while the word's coming forth and then throughout this day let's just pour ourselves into this and say god you pour yourself into me lord we've got needs here there's needs right here among us and there's not one person that doesn't have a need but i'm grateful that there is a living god that's here among us the only true and wise living god amen and may he manifest himself greater than all of our needs amen do you love him this morning amen we just welcomed brother andrew sister moriah glad to have them here with us let's pull on the gift of god this morning god has put that gift in that life that he might come down and use and that it might minister to you and i let's pull on that gift let's draw amen from el shaddai this morning and draw right down into our being what we have need of amen we're going home aren't we church amen just any moment any twinkling of an eye amen and there is a perfect clear blood trail that's laid out that we can get there amen let's think that once again i didn't know how to fly i didn't know what to say [Music] but the voice came speaking to the whole barnyard heard it but it was personal [Music] you're one of my dreams oh at first i was afraid deep down with me but something got to stirring [Music] amen oh oh how glorious you cleansed me you touched my heart and changed my soul and now [Music] one more time hallelujah this is personal now oh papa god oh let him know how much you appreciate him how much you're loving how thankful you are oh glory [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] we yeah [Music] now [Music] um amen give the lord a handclap of praise he's worthy to be praised amen and we greet you this morning in the name of the lord we sure believe the spirit of the lord is still moving among his people today amen amen i was just hearing the prophet of god speaking this morning and he was talking about the power of a believer hearing from god and he said when you hear from god nothing will shake you from what you've heard from him what amazed me was he said if the lord spoke to me and told me it was going to rain he said i wouldn't have no problem getting an umbrella and walking out even though the sun was shining and i began to think about that of how that when you hear from god amen nothing past present or future will shake you from what you heard from him so it may not look like it's possible to get a deliverance this morning or possible to get a healing but if he spoke to you all things are possible to them that believe this morning how many believers do we have here today amen let's just buy our heads together for a word of prayer as we look to him this morning and we'll just ask him to come and to speak to our hearts heavenly father lord is your believing children have gathered themselves together here this morning in your house lord we have not come out of tradition we have not come out of ritual lord we have not come out of largest coming to be in church or just coming to do our religious duties but lord we have received a message in this our father and it is a message of resurrection lord not a resurrection of two thousand years ago but it's a resurrection of lord a present tense god right here manifesting himself lord not just in paul's generation or you're not just manifesting yourself even in the days of brother branham but lord you're here today in this building in the year 2020 lord manifesting your power and your resurrection just as you did before lord as we come here this morning father we come as a needy people lord we come as a people today father that needs to hear from you lord we didn't come to hear from a man we didn't come to hear from a church but we come to hear from you lord and i pray this morning god lord as we have sung the songs of zion and as we feel your presence lord that has been brought into this building this morning in the hearts of your people i pray this morning lord you would come now and may as we open this this book called the bible lord we know anyone with physical strength can open it the lord it will take you to come and reveal what is written upon the pages and i pray this morning lord that it would be another emmaus road walk here today god that you would come lord and lord you would come into the secret places of our heart and you would there begin to break the bread of your word father i pray for those today god that would be weak lord i pray they would receive strength today pray for those who would be bound i pray god that they would receive deliverance today father lord in these meetings this weekend father upon today lord i pray o god that you would send a refreshing from the presence of god lord not a not just an emotion not just a sensation but lord a reality that you're still the same yesterday today and forever lord whatever is accomplished today we'll be sure to give you all the praise and all the honor and all the glory for it's in the wonderful name of our lord and savior jesus christ we pray and all the believers said amen amen may god richly bless you this morning if you have your bibles and your while you're standing with us we'll invite you to the book of exodus the 23rd chapter and while you're turning there we want to greet you this morning the name of the lord we certainly counted an honor and a privilege to be here with you today and i sure appreciate the invitation to come and brother samuel we appreciate him and his friendship and i appreciate the church here and all the believers here standing for this end time message amen we sure appreciate that and i want to bring greetings from our church there at home our pastor brother sean martin he said to send his greetings to you also we do do want to do that today and that we want to look here in the book of exodus the 23rd chapter how many has come to have church today amen i tell you i believe the spirit of the lord is among us amen in the book of exodus the 23rd chapter i want to look in the 20th verse exodus 23 and verse 20. i've been studying here some time on the voice and of god and as you go through the message of the hour studying on the voice it amazes me how many sermons brother ramtis back to exodus 23 in exodus 23 verse 20 the bible here says behold i send an angel before thee notice not behind thee but before thee so the angel is going to lead you to keep me in the way and to bring me into the place which i prepared beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him but thou shalt indeed what obey his voice and do all that i speak then i will be an enemy unto thine enemies and an adversary unto thine adversaries from an angel shall go before thee isn't it amazing the angels going before them shall go before thee and bring me into the amorites now notice here you would think if the angel the lord was in front of you leading you he would lead you away from the enemy but he leads him right to the enemy unto the amorites and to the hittites under the perizzites into the canaanites the harvards the jebusites and i will cut them off thou shalt not bow down to their gods nor serve them nor do after their works but thou shalt utterly overthrow them and quite break down their images and ye shall serve the lord your god and ye shall bless and he shall bless thy bread and thy water and i love this and i will take sickness away from the midst of thee i will take sickness away from the midst of thee we ask the lord this morning to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you may have your seats here for just a few moments this morning i want to by the help of the lord to speak to you here out of this scripture and some time ago i was actually we were here on a thursday night and we left here and went over to brother jim schumacher for some meetings there with them and i was studying there in hebrews chapter 12 and it's amazing how that one little word or one little scripture will open up so much to you and as i was studying there in hebrews 12 the bible there paul speaking said see that you refuse not him that speaketh and i've just been uh studying here some time on the voice of god but this morning i want to take another portion of this out of exodus 23 maybe not so much the voice but i want to speak to you on an angel to keep me in the way an angel to keep me in the way and there the bible says amen that god would send an angel before them and they shall obey his voice now we know it's important to do three things it's important to receive the voice of god it's important to believe the voice of god amen but it's also important to obey the voice of god there's many that will receive it there's many that will believe it amen but where the real battle comes is when it becomes time to obey what the voice is said amen and the voice of god is in that angel now we know that all bible believers believe in angels can you say man all scriptural bible believers this morning believe in angels and i i think of how that when we begin to speak of angels we should be aware amen that even right here this morning there are angels in our midst right here in this building this morning though you may not be able to see them though you may not even be able to feel them amen there's angels in this building this morning now the bible says in hebrews 13 2 be not forgetful to entertain strangers amen for thereby some have entertained angels unawares i i think of how abraham there in the bible amen just laying the foundation here he actually entertained amen the angel of the lord abraham entertained the angel of the lord now brother says it this way amen in a message of super sign he said i received some mighty fine christmas presents a movie camera many other things guns and things that people love me they give me how i appreciate that but all this eternal life this blessed assurance that christ lives in us that his fullness dwells within us and makes us rise and act different he said because when you do that you become a fugitive to the things of the world you become a pilgrim you reckon yourself dead to the things of the world and alive in a new life now you're an alien in the world you're an alien because you have professed plainly by your action that there is a city whose builder and maker is god see and you no longer care for these things of the world he said but we're a heaven-bound people looking for a city amen who's builder and maker as god we are abraham's seat because we have believed on the lord jesus christ and have died to the things of this world and have been raised in the resurrection of his likeness he said to walk as abraham did amen seeking a city to come talking god taking god's word calling everything else contrary amen to entertain angels in our home amen like abraham did the messengers of god that brought the message oh what a time amen professing that we don't want no more of the world we want him and him alone amen he is our savior amen then what that tells me is in the last days amen there's going to be another people on the earth amen that's going to receive a message but that message is not going to come ain't meant to tell them get comfortable where you're at and get more relaxed react but that message is going to come and it's going to remind them amen that there is still a heaven amen there is still a city whose builder and maker is god and i just want to take a minute in here and tell you this morning there's a lot going on in this world amen there's a lot of shaking there's a lot of variety there's a lot of confusion amen but there is a people here this morning amen that is not shaken amen they are not moved amen they are not nervous because they have received a message from an angel amen that said there's still a land amen beyond the river i don't know about you amen if all we had was this world this morning we've got every ride ain't meant to sit here defeated if all we had was the future of the political system we've got every right to be defeated this morning but we received a message they meant to come with a capstone revelation that there is a future home amen and somebody's going to go to i don't know about you but i feel the angels of god here this morning reminding me get your eyes off the things of this world get your eyes off the democrats get your eyes off the republican and get your eyes back on the land amen that is flowing with milk and honey get your eyes back on the land where the streets are paved the gold and the walls are jasper hey this is not my home amen i didn't come to stay here we're going to leave here church don't you forget that no matter how dark the night gets no matter how cold the trial comes we're going to leave here one of these mornings because god should an angel amen to lead us out of here amen we do not believe in the worship of angels but we do believe in the ministry of angels the bible says in matthew 18 10 take heed that you despise amen not one of these little ones for i say unto you that in heaven amen there's angels to always behold the face of my father which is in heaven amen there is angels in heaven amen there is angels on the earth now notice here he said you see when i speak of an angel i do not mean the worship of an angel does everyone understand that no you don't worship an angel you worship god see not an angel but it's the ministry of angels amen amen in this morning church we are under the ministry of angels i believe that the angels of god they watch over us amen i believe that jesus said there is angels always behold the face of my father which is in heaven amen the prophet of god said the ministry of angels amen was in the old testament he said it was in the new testament as well amen that god would send angels in the message what is the holy ghost given for now in this age that we're now living this age is beyond pentecost pentecost settled itself in organizations and started taking a whole lot of organizations amen but we are this and we are that that's just nature he said see but the church has moved on it's gotten into greater more powerful it's the restoration of the guests and many people amen many pentecostal people does not believe in divine healing he said they don't believe in the ministry of angels and the powers of god amen see why god had to call it pride out of that amen because when it was in the beginning amen he'll be in the end and whatever denies what he was in the beginning will be dismissed from him but there'll be a pride that'll come out of that confusion and they'll stand i feel like preaching here and they'll stand in the middle of a god-denying world in the middle of the supernatural divine world and they'll still say i believe in angels amen i'll tell you this morning church there's some people here today you can call us crazy you can call us fanatics you can call us holy rollers but we're not a part of that nonsense amen god called us out that we could stand not upon the rock of gibraltar but upon the rock of ages and declare we still believe in the supernatural elements of the living god in this generation i'm not ashamed of a church not ashamed of my supernatural beliefs i'm not ashamed to stand and say that god still heals the sick i'm not ashamed to stand and say that god still cast out devils i'm not ashamed to stand and say that god still feels with the holy ghost can i tell you something else i'm not ashamed i'm not ashamed to stand and say that god sent a man in this generation by the name of him with a message i'm not ashamed to stand and say seven angels picked him up and revealed the health i'm not ashamed amen to say the same pill of fire amen that led moses and then paul is here leading the church this morning oh let me shout it with everything within me i am not ashamed of the supernatural element of jesus christ oh we've got a lot of people that's ashamed of it amen they want us to get quiet they want us to get formal amen they want us to get real real real traditional amen but let me just go ahead and preach to you this morning i'm not getting that way i'm not ashamed amen i'm not to say i believe god still speaks in tongues yes sir i believe god still feels with the holy ghost i believe god amen still dances in the spirit i believe god still does everything that he did in the book of acts he is still doing here this morning let me say it again i am not ashamed to be in the bright age i am not ashamed they meant to be preaching under the pride anointing i am not ashamed they meant to be walking in the bride like oh this ain't denominational light this is messiah light this is bright light they didn't come to leave us where we're at but it come to take us work on or dang for us to go ah it's all coming forth of the holy spirit he said to this great church is being filled up and chugged full hallelujah of the great powers of almighty god until it's got to a place until the very works that jesus done has manifested itself right here in the church now amen friends what god done then is what's being manifested now and there ain't no devil can stop it i ain't no demon combined there ain't no unbelieving spirits that can stop the ministry of angels in this generation oh what is an angel believe says an angel is a servant he said is that all right he said they are his servants another place he would say what is an angel an angel is a messenger he said get your dictionary you'll find angel means a messenger some of them are heavenly messengers amen some of them are earthly messengers amen that god dwells in to bring his earthly message then the angel is not god amen but god is him the angel amen amen the angel is not god amen but god is failed in the angel he said in those messengers angels of the lord amen they're messengers to you and they're standing there with their hands out to obey what god has to say amen another place he would say notice now when anything is going to happen on earth amen then first god will send a messenger and that messenger is anointed by an angel he said now there's minor angels and there's major angels he said now sometimes he said like gabriel who is a major angel he said when he comes something major is getting ready to happen he said gabriel come from heaven and announce the first coming of jesus and gabriel will announce the second coming amen i want you to catch something here that angels true angels amen do not move upon their own accord amen but they are sent by god then what they're doing is they're being sent forth from the presence of god exodus 23 verse 20 said notice behold i amen which is god will do what will send amen an angel before thee amen see now look here remember it says the word we have just read was god said to moses he said the people were there in bondage he said just like today we're in the last days and he promised that these signs and wonders would be done in the last day he said so god raised up a man by the name of moses had he born in the world for a specific purpose he said moses never performed one miracle it was the angel of god that went before moses it was a pillar of fire at night in a cloud by day even see god delivered the children of israel when they were in bondage and they couldn't help themselves he said and today god's people are not in bondage spiritually for they're delivered by the power of the holy spirit no man has to stay in bondage of sin any longer because the holy spirit will bring him from bondage amen of sin now notice here but the people as children are sick and needy and some of them are cancer ridden and tubercular and heart trouble our beloved doctors of this earth can find no remedy for and it's multiplying it's getting greater and greater all the time they meant sickness is heaping greater and greater and some of them things that the doctors know not how to control and the people have cried since chile for years and years amen for god to restore the church again amen his gifts and signs and wonders i guess there's a hundred here tonight let's pray that prayer well when the children of israel of god began to cry down in egypt god sent them down a deliverer and vindicated this deliverer by signs and wonders don't you think god amen could do that tonight just the same are you hearing me amen if god could do it for israel amen then god can do it this morning amen if god could hear the cries of two million people amen and say i am come down amen to deliver my people and i believe here this morning if we'll begin to cry unto god in the same god amen that delivered israel will come in this building this morning and will deliver his people yes sir if you're sick amen and can't get well and the doctor can't help you don't you think your father is here for you and can he send gifts he said now he did then and i believe he's just the same today he always makes a way anybody a witness here today that god always makes a way when there seems to be no way when there is no way possible somehow or another god comes down and he makes a way now what amazes me is how israel was in bondage they were sick they were being beaten they were slains they were being tormented they were being oppressed all this around them and they're praying asking god amen for a deliverer he meant to deliver them out of that condition and here comes a man named moses and they look at him but because he didn't come the way they thought he would come then they missed him but he would stand there and say this way i am the answer to your prayers amen moses could stand there and say what you've been praying for quit praying and start rejoicing because what you've been praying for is now standing before you in fulfillment then a prophet would bring that to this day and say there's hundreds of cancer-ridden and tuberculosis cases and people's been praying for years that somewhere somebody would pick up the bible and would believe that god is still god and his word is still the word and he can still heal and a prophet is standing before them and saying what you've been praying for is before you tonight amen can i bring back to today amen what you've been praying for what you've been asking god for it's not coming it's here this morning because god has sent an angel in this generation to deliver unto you the word oh church i'll tell you what it's time to do it's time to stop crying it's time to stop moping it's time to stop mourning we got something to shout about brother because the mighty god has been unveiled in this generation and the mighty god has come down oh somebody lift your hands and say thank you lord amen thank you lord the mighty god has come down in this generation what did he come down with he come down with an open book he meant to open a power in the church he meant to release an anointing upon a group of people i can't even teach for preaching this one hey come on church we are not here as a bunch of beggars this morning we are the sons and daughters of angel hey we are the children of god we've got every divine blessing laying in our fingertips this morning we've been praying for it but it's here this morning amen you've been asking god for it but it's here this morning you've been looking for it but god sent a prophet even to identify it to you in the word oh look no further look no further amen it's here this morning oh you said brother andrew i don't see it neither did israel amen they did not see god veiled in an angel called moses notice here the lord said i have surely seen the affliction of my people amen notice here which are in egypt and have heard amen that have heard their cry by the reason they're taskmasters for i know their sorrows amen i love this and i am come down let's say those let's say those three words together i am come down that was four sorry i am come down in c and to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians amen and to bring them up out of the land unto a good land and a large land and a land full of milk and honey unto the place of the canaanites amen and the hittite and the amorite and the paris hat and the jebusites are you all catching it and then there was enemies there that was indwelling in their land but it wasn't their land so god sent an angel and said the place where your enemy has been i'm gonna remove it and i'm gonna give it to you are y'all hearing me this morning church some of you all have been looking at promises but there's been a canaanite on it you've been looking at promises but there's been a genius hat on it amen you've been wanting to shout some bad but there's been a parasite on it you've been wanting to get your praise back so bad but there's been an old canaanite on it but this morning amen the spirit of lord is in the building to drive off every enemy and to give you your land and [Applause] there is a host of angels here well i don't feel like putting forth no effort will sit there and let the enemy enjoy your land but not this boy no sir it ain't no enemy going to enjoy my blessing ain't no enemy going to drink amen the stimulation of revelation is sent to me it's mine and god said an angel here ain't meant to make sure i would come to the place of your name for me to go oh you notice harry he says i have come down i god have come down but all we see is you moses but god has come down amen i have come down the man says oh i just caught that under inspiration what is it god going in the form of a man a then the angel was not god amen but god was in the angel and the bible said amen that ye are gods oh then what is divine leadership what is it this morning is divine leadership abort is divine leadership of counsel it's divine leadership amen a denomination a divine leadership he is god going in the form of a man to lead his people to a divinely prepared place that he himself prepared for them amen moses the very deliverer god's gift to the people they did not understand him do you see what i mean they did not understand moses moses thought surely they would understand he was the gift to the liver but they did not understand he said now friends don't get me wrong may i say this with reverence in my heart knowing that i am eternity-bound person that'll stand before judgment someday thousands of people are missing their gift see they can't understand it and they'll look and say oh he's just a man that's true was it god or moses that delivered the people he says it was god in moses and then see they cried for the liver and then god sent the liver and they failed to see it because it was by amen but it wasn't a man it was god in the man are you hearing me this morning amen another place now god is always by all men through the scriptures through all ages has ordained that angels should guide the people amen the angels amen should guide the people there was moses there was daniel how many more could we say all the way down that was guided by angels see then it was god coming down in the form of a man to be a divine leader a meant to be a god amen to guide his people amen from one place to the other amen can i tell you this morning church you've got three stages of your journey you have got a past amen you have got a present but can i preach to you this morning you got a future [Applause] this morning and i didn't come here ain't meant to remind you of your past i didn't come here ain't meant to remind you of where you've been and where you was i don't care where you've been i don't care where you was can i go a step further i didn't even come to remind you where you're at but i did come he meant to remind you of where you're going we're going somewhere church we're going somewhere where are we going we're going forward are you all catching it this morning the angel was not behind them the angel was before them because their future was not behind them their future was in front of them and i was saying this morning church your future is not behind you your future is infinity anybody want to rise up this morning and put your walking shoes on anybody want to rise up and say i'm tired i'm sitting here there is a future there is a land there is an inheritance to go get [Applause] well brother there's no way i can take it that's what the devil wants you to say but god sent an angel oh brother don't you see right now there's a warfare going on in this building do you know there's a warfare right now [Applause] right now there's a warfare you say what is that warfare it's a warfare between the demons of darkness between the demons of hell and the angels of god right now they're present against each other right now they're pressing against each other they've been saying don't go forward don't rise up don't shake that lukewarmness off don't get a revival don't get a breakthrough have a nervous breakdown and then don't move any closer to god stay where you're at there's a war going on amen but i heard a prophet say that one is the majority in god when one believer rises up and says enough is enough i am tired of sitting where i've been for 20 years for 15 years for 30 years there is a place prepared church and we sent an angel to get us there [Applause] i'm just going to preach to you for a minute amen if you're still where you are where you were thursday night service you need a revival amen if you're still where you were 40 years ago you need to move preach brother andrew thank god i will if you're still where you're at when you first heard about the message you need to get some fire under you and move on up the road brother we got a place to go we can stay here oh god help me we can't stay here this morning church we got to leave here people's not so content with their iron ain't mean that they don't worship god no more they don't shout no more they don't speak in tongues no more they don't break through no more well let's preach we're here we might as well and then they don't want to see nobody listen i've come to place if you don't want to go no further that's a okay with me you just leave me alone if you're happy where you're at that's okay but leave me alone remember then you're getting pretty boastful amen now you're not the first one to pull that on me i remember when i first started preaching there was a preacher come to me he said oh he's just young young whippersnapper you're just trying to be something that's why you're studying all them tapes and preaching all the employees you're just trying to be something now y'all forgive me okay amen but i didn't come from ahab i came from elijah i don't have a wisp oh my god and i just looked at him i said well brother you're exactly right he kind of stepped back and said you mean to tell me you're trying to be something i said yes sir i'm trying to be everything that a prophet of god said i could be if he said i could be victorious if he said i could be healed i'm gonna be here has ordained me to me [Applause] i'm going somewhere church i'm not staying here i'm going somewhere i can't help it it's pulling me it's drawing i wish i could stand [Music] are you hearing me this morning we can't stay here we got to move we got to move brother [Music] oh we got to be what god so we could be we got gotta expand a little bit we gotta we gotta grow out a little bit right well let's preach right now i mean you may be happy with a hill but i'm not there ain't enough room for my big feet to dance on that hill [Applause] you may be happy with the hill but i'm not they're getting enough room on a pentecostal hill for me to preach the third pool amen there's a mountain somewhere to oh i pray this morning i know this may be as simple as simple can be but i pray the same spirit that fell on caleb would fall upon this church this morning and before their service is over somebody would raise up and say give me my mountain yes sir god amen always had ministering spirits i believe in them i believe in the ministering spirits sent from the presence of god the holy spirit ministers lead the church guardian angels did y'all hear that big word guardian angels guardian angels that watches over us see that's why i got to praise god it's because i know if it wasn't for him i wouldn't be here [Applause] now people tighten up on that well he's going to get pentecostal that you're exactly right because the ones you're worried about ain't protected you know the ones you're worried about haven't provided for you the reason why you're here this morning is because god sent a guardian angel come on church when moses got down there in egypt and realized that he swam down a snake and crocodile infested river you better believe he's going to give god some praise you know why because he had ever right to be dead he had every excuse not to be there but god sent an angel god sent an angel and he went through crocodile rivers and the promise of god said that and then an old crocodile would get real hungry and he would sneak up there in the basket and he said he would smell that and he would say man that smells like a good meal but you know what i believe i believe with that angel when that when that crocodile put his nose against that basket i believe there was an angel there that touched that nose and said back up there's a condition on him back up he was born for a specific purpose well hear me this morning church come on church even some of you know you shouldn't be sitting here this morning you should have died in your past life you shouldn't be alive this morning the devil should have got you even hail should have consumed you but there was an angel there was an angel around you and when the day will come in to sniff your life when the devil come in to take your testimony there was an angel that smacked him on the nose and said i'm reserving them for a bright age for a rapture oh i want somebody screaming the devil you can't touch this bride you can't touch this bride come on fathers you can't touch this family you can't touch my family come on preachers you can't touch this church come on sisters you can't touch my testimony there's an angel there's an angel watching you when you was in college and some old liberal theologian some old liberal philosopher tried to talk the power of god out of you there was an angel there that touched that doctrine on the nose and said back up that's a manifested son of god [Applause] i feel angels in here this morning you say by the end why are you feeling lighter because i feel demons backing up an angel here ah brother andrew there's only a guardian angel for the preacher there's only a guardian angel a guardian angel for the deacon well then there's only a guardian angel for the prophet well let me tell you what the prophet said everyone has a guardian angel according to the scripture ah now before god sends a message to the earth god sends angels sometimes as messengers to the earth to bring his message do you believe that do you believe god sends angels and let's look through the scriptures here real quick at the ministry of angels amen in genesis 16 7. i'm just going to read these quickly the angel lord found hagar found her by a fountain of water and told her to return to syria and submit herself into her under her hands now we know hagar is not our type but i want you to notice something the angel of the lord knew where hagar was do you realize in genesis 19 15 that the angels of the lord hasten lot and center eyes amen take my wife and my two daughters which are here let's thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city and escape for that life god sent an angels to lot and tap lot on the shoulder and said launch you better get up and get out of here are you catching it in genesis 22 11 do you realize abraham took isaac upon the mountain what did he go up there to do to offer him you realize there was an angel appeared amen and called unto abraham and said abraham stay thy hand right before he slew isaac had abraham not heard and obeyed the voice of god he would have killed the promise but he heard the voice and the angels stopped him and said there's a ram here in first kings 19 5 the bible says that elijah was really tired amen he had been preaching he had been laboring real hard they've been against all that all that all that nonsense that they have in jezebel and the bible says that the lord told elijah to go to a juniper tree and the prophet of god said he went up there and he told his angels he said i want the angel that's got the softest hands and the best cook to go down to the juniper tree and i want you to find my weary servant and i want you to stroke his brow i want you to fix him some corn cakes i want you to minister to him well brother andrew that's real good amen that's your good but that changed that that's elijah and this soft angel salt handed angel went over and struck the little servant of god on the ground remember if you've done your best yes brother andrew that's elijah that's not me but remember if you've done your best then god still god angels yes sir in order he loves you just the same as he loved elijah in daniel 3 and verse 28 the bible tells us that god sent his angel to deliver the three hebrew boys that they would give them sin they would not give themselves over to the idolatry of the day in daniel 6 22 daniel testified that god had sent his angel and shut the lion's mouth that they would not hurt him in mark 1 13 jesus was in the wilderness 40 days tempted of satan and the angels ministered unto him in luke 16 22 amen the bible says that there was a beggar named lazarus and that man died notice and was carried by angels there is an angel i know we can't shake hands and breakfast hey but look at somebody next to you and say there's an angel there's an angel brother brian there's an angel i'm trying to behave this morning brother there's an angel here there's an angel there's an angel with you in your birth there's an angel with you in your life oh come on church there's an angel with you in your death yes sir and then you look in acts 5 19 how the angel of the lord by night came down and opened the prison doors for the apostles that they were thrown behind all right if there is an angel can i preach to you for a minute the same angel that was in your past is the same angel that's in your present and that same angel has already been in your future [Applause] he was in your past he's the reason why your past didn't consume you oh come on church well bless god brother andrew i have you to know right now i want no cigarette sucking whiskey drinking i was a message believer from the time i was born but you know what there's an angel because there's been people sent message churches that's not been consumed by alcohol that's not been consumed by drugs but they've been consumed by false doctrines but the reason why you are not it's because there was [Applause] oh god i hope you hear me this way you ain't got nothing to praise god for you're out of your mind you've got something to praise him for this morning you shouldn't don't you touch my lips i'll tell you why i'm here this morning it's because i memorized all the quotes i memorized all the sunset mountains and i memorized all the cliches no there's a lot of people done that but they're not here this morning but the only reason why that you're here this morning is because there was an angel there was an angel there was an angel that could not amen let you go that way because he had done being in your future [Applause] oh god in your future are you all hearing me don't you see why i heard him say this morning in future home he said let me draw brother i i i'm all scattered but i'm just going to preach amen he said let me draw it for you he said here's those pharisees and here's those priests and here's all those all those attributes he said and here's the woman at the well he said see he said she came from there therefore she could recognize him because she had representation to go back there [Applause] when the vindicated word of her day crossed her path she had to believe it because she believed it [Applause] [Music] there those pharisees those pharisees they saw the vindicated word and it didn't move them he said you know why because they didn't have no representation there hey but the reason why she was so happy is because an angel had admitted her future and had done seen her there [Applause] oh do you know why that guardian angel won't let you quit you don't know why that guardian angel won't let you give up do you know why that guardian angel won't let your bad days outweigh your good days to the point you give up is because he's done seeing your spot at the [Applause] he's going to [Music] [Applause] [Applause] and he's already seen my future go ahead and praise god [Applause] [Applause] the angels [Applause] [Music] oh god [Music] that's real nice but that ain't scripture my bible says that the angel of god stood before paul i don't mind telling you i'm feeling them outdoors right now the angel stood before paul and said paul you're going to be shipwrecked you're going to go through 14 days of no light but don't worry [Applause] will be no lives lost you will make it you will make it who was paul he was the messenger of the age are y'all catching me this morning then when paul got on that ship and all of a sudden they were sailing and it began to storm paul didn't get nervous he went turned on be not afraid in his eye hey when the when the first bit of rain began to fall paul didn't get nervous he went in there and turned on the future home see he was in his presence but he had a future oh i know this is simple but here my heart this morning and when the storm began to rock the ship and paul was sitting there maybe someone began to get nervous and knock their knees and say oh paul what's going to happen paul didn't get nervous he just kept on praising god all of a sudden this broke apart and there they are and they're all scattered out there on the sea but paul never lost height of the shore he never lost height of the shore because an angel said paul you're going to be shipwrecked now i want you to catch something paul gets on the other side you imagine paul gets over there and he gets over there and he's looking around and he might be singing oh won't we have a time when we all get over yonder maybe he was singing they'll be dancing at isaiah brooks they'll be dancing on the hills of glory and that paul was shouting you imagine some of these other guys come up on broken pieces come up on broken boards and there was paul over there just praising god they said paul what's wrong with you don't you see what we just went through don't you see what we just survived oh why are you so happy paul said before it ever happened i met an angel and that angel said paul there's going to be some shipwrecks there's going to be some people leave the message there's going to be some preachers tonight of indicated word there's going to be some families and friends that you love dearly that's going to throw up their hands and say it's nothing but cannon fighter but don't you be shaking paul because you're going to make it [Applause] right there's enough to praise god for an hour we're going to make a fall by church left side some may fall by our eyes but we've heard an angel say oh the angel that was in the past was the guardian angel in the present was the guardian angel that already seen your future see then what are all these can i have just a few more minutes what are all these they're all ministering spirits the bible says amen notice here are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation see then what is the word ministering means it means to be employed in the ministry then these angels are employed by god to see that you get there [Applause] but what do they do they bring you the word notice here ministering spirits sent where from the presence of god what to do minister his word and the greatest bounty ever fought the angel lord even his picture hanging here on the wall has got science stumped everywhere what does he do stay right with the word amen cut every devil let's say that together cut every devil amen yes it does what is it it's the ministering spirit sent from the presence of god to anoint the speakers of the word what that stays with the word and he confirms the word with signs following and brings jesus the same yesterday today and forever notice here what's the matter though it's in our minds we open our minds to things and say well now i don't know whether it could be or not maybe if i feel better tomorrow oh don't have one thing to do with that now notice here there are true angels and there are false angels can you say amen amen now if you'll notice here both types of angels have characteristics in the book of revelation 22 verse 8 and i john saw these things and heard them and when i heard and seen i fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things then saith the unto me see thou do it not for i am thy fellow servant and of thy brethren the prophets and of them which keep the scenes of this book notice the next two words worship god god has always used angels in his work but god has had angels to every dispensation and i want you to catch something here god always sends his warning just the same just the days before the coming of the lord jesus god always makes a preparation so he sends an angel notice here and a true angel would not stand to be worshipped right there is the first characteristic of a true angel he will not stand to be worshipped all right the second characteristic is a real true angel will come and vindicate this scripture to the dot he won't change it he won't water it down he won't add to it he'll only vindicate what's already written then the third thing is a true angel of god will bear a record of christ hallelujah a true great mind will bear grace and a true spirit of god will manifest jesus christ if it doesn't then it don't answer to the year of famine but it says and i defy the devil hallelujah and all of his works it's the hour of the church's deliverance and they're sitting under creeds and nominations and fleshing and going on till they don't know their day but rise all right right you that sleep amen and shake yourself and call on god amen it's the hour of the church's deliverance amen can i give you a fourth characteristic of a true angel the fourth characteristic is he will testify that the bible which is the written truth the written word is the truth now i i'm i'm trying to hurry here but i want you to catch this there's many characteristics of false angels right amen but but i just want to give you the the number one identifying characteristic of a false angel galatians 1 6 i marvel that you're not so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of christ unto another gospel which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of christ notice here but the we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed and paul was so determined that he would say as we said before so say i now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you then that ye have received let him be accursed then bluebeam says what is it he said the angel of the lord that comes to me never takes me away from the scripture the angel that you see in the picture never took the prophet away from the scripture then what is the identifying characteristic of a false angel hallelujah to lead you away from the word amen amen so this morning if a false angel come in here and said i want to tell y'all something the ark never did happen well you screw your shoulders back say i'll tell you right now bless god i'll take you over to kentucky and show you the replica the angel is not going to fight you on what's already been fulfilled he's not going to try to lead you away from what paul done or what peter done what's he going to do lead you away from the vindicated word of your hour see the problem of god said that's what israel needed was a way out of egypt and god provided them a prophet with the vindicated original word are you hearing me all right now let me read this to you brother and praying says may now they repent come quickly to you and be filled with the oil and the wine and be changed from that denominational robe of cain's death unto a snow white robe of eternal life given out by the bridegroom and then they'll go to the wedding supper someday in the vindicated word of the resurrection i don't have time to get into all this let me let me let me listen this way the leadership of god the god the guardian angel the leader of the way is follow the vindicated word of the hour by the holy ghost now i want you to catch us here because eve's interpreter is the false angel's chief now the bible says the serpent was more simple than any beast in the field verse 4 and the serpent said to the woman you shall not surely die all right god will not now some churches says we don't believe this but we believe that god will never judge the world by the church he judges it by jesus christ and jesus christ is the word he'll judge the church by the word and if this is the revelation of jesus christ for all ages and for this age he's revealed in this bible what he would do in this age and when we see it do it right i can preach there all day when we see it do it when we see him do what he promised to do not a virgin birth hello not a virgin birth that was 2 000 years ago but what he promised to do today what he said he would do today that's what he is today and many times people say well i don't believe that well you've got eve's interpreter again right eve's interpreter amen was lucifer and satan now he said he would exhaust himself above the most high he would ascend above the clouds and the stars he would sit there like god be above the most high he has succeeded in carrying out his threats he has certainly had a marvelous success in carrying out his threats by the people letting him explain away in every age the value of god's promised word to that age that's exactly how he's done it so when an age comes and god sends an angel to lead that age and the devil comes in and says that's not the way it's supposed to be then they believe eve's interpreter and leads him out of the way now amy can i have just a few minutes here am i holding too long if you look with me in revelation 1 in the in the patmos vision the bible says remember says it this way before we read there they put him on the owl for two years and while god had him out there along to himself he wrote the book of revelation as the angel of the lord revealed it to him so john goes to the isle of patmos god sends an angel his angel comes and reveals the book of revelation to john and john writes it now in verse 10 of revelation 1 i was in the spirit on the lord's day and heard behind me as a great voice as of a trumpet saying i am alpha and omega the first and the last what thou seest write in a book and send it and the seven churches which are in asia under ephesus smyrna pergamus thytyra sardis philadelphia and laodicea and i turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks was one like unto the son of man now i want to skip down here to verse 16 and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth with a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun it shineth in his strength and i saw him and i fell at his feet as dead and he had his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not i am the first and the last amen now notice here in verse 19 write these things which shall have seen and the things which thou are and with through things that shall be hereafter past present future the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which thou saw us are the seven churches now notice here he had in his right hand seven stars remember those seven stars are the messengers to seven successive church ages they are not called by name they are just set forth as seven but it's one to each h from the ephesian age on down to this layout of sin age each messenger brought the message of truth to the people never failing to keep it with the word of god for that particular age each one held on to it amen each one held on to it they were steadfast in their loyalty to the original light as each age pulled away from god his faithful messenger hallelujah would turn that age back to the word their strength was from the lord and i'm not going to preach all day but stay with me their strength was from the lord or they could have never stemmed the tide these angels were not floating downstream they were swimming upstream oh god have mercy they were not swimming down they were swimming up i can't read my notes for catching inspiration don't you see they weren't going down they were going up what are we doing we're not coming we're down up the angel didn't lead him down they was already down but the angel let him up oh come on church if you're down this morning there's an angel in this feeling [Music] oh they were truly yielded to him and kept him by his own kept by his omnipotence they were denounced by the organizations and they were held in mockery but they kept to the true word all right amen i gotta close here in a second but we'll say paul swam the tide we'll say martin swim the tide we'll say columbus swim the tide we'll say luther swam against the tide well let's not just leave it there because we're in an age and we need an angel too but in the days [Applause] [Music] when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished when he shall begin to sound when you hear his voice you are closer [Music] you are closer when you hear that voice you are closer to home than you've ever been for seven successive church ages oh i'll tell you this morning church won't you look at somebody and say don't give up don't give in don't give up don't get in some of y'all still look at me don't give up don't give in what do we do give it all you got we're just about home i can see the sword from here i can see the lights from here brother why are you so happy because god sent me an angel with the original word he delivered unto me the original word are you hearing me this morning church and that original word caught me it caught me it picked me up it began to talk to me it began to fellowship with me it began to tell me i've been there [Music] heaven i was laying on my bed [Music] with my hands behind my head and the next thing i knew i was over there and i looked back and there was that wrinkled body there was that wrinkled william branham laying in that bed but here was i a young man it was high fellowship and with convert with a 90 year old woman that i led to jesus christ who are you daddy on earth they call me your little sharon rose where's billy paul are y'all hearing me he went there so he could come back and say i saw you there [Music] and you want me to deny this message you want me to deny william as a prophet [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh all i can say is get ready get ready get ready get ready we're going home you say with andrew i don't know about that i don't know what's happening i'll tell you what those seven angel messengers were sent to do they were sent together the elect i've got a three-part sermon right here in one i'm trying to tie it up they were sent to gather the election behold i god send an angel to do what keep me in the they were sent to gather the elect into the way brethren said god sending forth angels together the elect from the four winds of the earth with our angels they are divine keepers behold i sent an angel to preserve thee in the journey amen in the way of holiness amen the way is the middle of the road now but the real church is a real same gospel right in the middle of the road it's not cold and starchy neither is it fanaticism it's a real good old warm gospel love of god going right down the middle of the road calling from both sides what am i saying god's provided way walk in god's provided way he has provided us a messenger the holy ghost he has provided us a word and if any spirit speaks conquer the word it cannot be the holy ghost now brother andrew what kind of road are you on it's a road that's been built by christ our lord the expansion that is made from earth to another land and the unclean doesn't pass over it then what does that angel do he keeps you in the way who is the way jesus said i am the way christ is the way he is not a way it's the way can i make some devils mad and close amen christ is the way the message of the hour is christ then that tells me this message is the way brother andrew how am i going to get from here to over there how am i going to get from here there it's real simple [Music] god sent a message it's called the way just walk in it amen well then that's too simple for me well the product of god said this way well brother andrew i i don't know if i can walk in this message i don't know if i can follow this angel messenger he's the absolute to the believer and if christ is your absolute you're tied to him and if he is your absolute and you're tied to him then you're tied to the word now now this tells whether we got the right absolute or not see if you can read it in the scripture something that christ has ordained us to do and because of some twisting around if someone would tell you that was for the disciples or someone else then you don't hold on to that then christ is not your absolute here's where i want to leave it that person listen here that person who led you out of the way is your absolute but if that word christ still holds see then he is your absolute and we mustn't let anything stir us out of the way of the word a true angel will lead you in the way he will tell you to stay in the way but a false angel will tell you there's another way but my god said my ways are not your ways for my ways are higher than your ways amen they've been trying to find ways to get there but god sent seven angel messengers to seven church ages to lay out the way of christ unfolding himself in this last gentile age and to keep thee in the way and this is where i'm done and to bring me to a prepared place can i tell you this morning he's not working on it right now maybe i preached up the first 30 minutes he's not working on it now it's already see to bring me to a prepared place to a stable place to establish place to a fixed place to a place that's been arranged to be restored then what are you saying i'm saying our god is a god of preparation before god does anything he prepares it god prepare god's preparation has been absolutely ridiculous to the natural mind because the natural mind cannot conceive the things that are of god can i tell you something of how god all right i'm going to close right here god prepared he prepared your coming he prepared your being here but he also prepared you're leaving here you say brother andrew what are you talking about god prepared a sacrifice for abraham on the mountain when goliath made his boast god already had a man by the name of david prepared to take care of him the bible says noah prepared the ark to the saving of his household god prepared the prophet isaiah for the days of his prophecy in the days of israel after 400 years of being in bondage god prepared a sign of deliverance for them god was the sign of deliverance to israel and god was the sign of judgment to egypt oh can i go a step further the lord had prepared a great fish amen to swallow up jonathan amen see he's the god of preparation all that was done in your coming here all that was done before you got here but when you got here what was done was a foreshadow of what was going to happen to you when you got here to get you out of where you are to take you where you should always have been [Applause] god hallelujah the lamb to be slain before the foundation of the world for the redemption of his church then what are you trying to say preacher i'm trying to tell you before you come here in bondage god already paid prepared your liberty [Applause] but a body has to have prepared hallelujah you realize the father god said god prepared america for the freedom of religion right he's the god of preparation oh that's my past that's my present but brother samuel let's go to my future let not your heart be troubled amen if you believe in god believe in me in my father's house or many mansions if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there he may be also what am i telling you this morning church you've got a future you don't just have a past brother brian you don't just have a present but you got a future this morning church get up shake yourself off knock the dust off on you put on your walking shoes get your staff in your hand he's looking for me this morning he's waiting for you this morning you got to be there [Applause] no i don't think you get it i don't think he he actually got something hey they got a thing now called life 360. you heard of that me and my wife's got it i'm gonna get in trouble here we've got it we was with the people of the day and that's talking about it and one brother one sister spoke up she said yeah we need to get that honey he said no we don't we'll leave that alone amen live 360. it's a very interesting thing you know what you can put your you can put yourself in there and wherever you are there's something always tracking you so if you get lost they can find you but you know what it's got a place you began on there it's got it's got it's got a destination where you begin but it's also got a destination of where you end oh you know what i love about it amen when my wife gets ready to leave home or something amen you know what it'll it'll notify me it'll say i'll be at my office or something it'll notify me it'll say your wife is fixing to leave home but you know what you can watch all the streets you can make sure she's okay if something happens you know exactly where she's at brother samuel but you know what i love when it says something else it says your wife has arrived at home that means she made it back she made it back where she started oh come on church you didn't start in layout of the seas you didn't start in saint jaden you didn't start in this college you started in heaven you bypassed your theophany you're on the journey this morning it's got a lot of crooks it's got a lot of bends it's got a lot of unexpected turns but your father your husband he knows you're on your way home won't you stand and lift your hands inside coming home i'm coming home he knows where i'm at he sent an angel there [Music] [Applause] he's an angel [Music] is the musicians coming this morning if we're christians i think we ought to kindly be notified ahead of what our destination is berlandr what are you doing this morning i'm reminding you i'm reminding you you didn't start here you came from god there was a guardian angel with you watched over you in your birth prepared you're coming here when you begin to get older watched over here watched overs in our running days when we was running from god brother andrew i went running from god i sit in the message church where he was just running from god in the messy church all right amen running from god but there was an angel watching over here said brother andrew that angel was only with me when i was out in the world and then i got saved that angel he don't say no see that same angels right here this morning amen amen prophet god said angel will meet you and bring you to the seat you're sitting here i got to preach on angel the other day at home and where we're at right now we got a church building's too small for all the people we got to social distance so we've got a campground we can spread out in there six feet apart and the state orders are you got to set families together so when they they went over and got that building and arranged it they actually put seats together and then they put name tags on the back so one would say like for us the glovers or ones say this so it's it's already arranged i got preaching on that about angels and i said you know the bible says the prophet god tells us that angels actually will meet us at the door and escort us to our seat now you're preaching you feel something come back at you and i said well wait a minute you're saying we're under there and no way that could happen because they arranged these seats the deacons and the pastor come here to range you see i said let me just tell you how crazy i am i'm crazy enough to believe that when they was arranged in these seats there was an angel leap that's how crazy i am because i believe in the supernatural hallelujah i believe in angels i believe in the ministry of angels [Music] i believe there's an angel here this morning i believe the reason why you're sitting here clothed in your right mind hallelujah is because there was an angel there was an angel around you they said no no you've gone too far back up devil i've got a prepared place for him hallelujah [Music] you love him this morning amen hallelujah you believe that angel was in your past you believe he was in your presence you believe he's already been in your future you ever listen to some of the prayer lines it amazes me brother branham will say now i'm here but i'm really not here paraphrasing he would be his body would be there but he would leave and go into another dimension a dimension ahead or he would go into a dimension behind and he would say he was bit by a dog as a little child that fear has followed you all your life and he would bring him all the way from the past the president say that's why he got that fear on you now but then he would go in the future [Music] and say but the thing left you you're going to be well go on your way to rejoice brother i ain't even got time to surface the ministry of angels this morning but if you don't believe in nothing else but this you remember there's a guardian angel watching over him that's gonna bring you to the prepared place anybody anybody in this last little bit begin to feel that little bit of an antsy feeling about going home this this time no i'm not talking about this morning just begin to feel that little little time to go home just this there's nothing nothing settles around you know everything you can build a new house and move in and it just don't feel right you can remodel the house you're in and it's nice but just got that antsy feeling it's time to go you know why because there's a place prepared for it it's pulling at you it's drawing at you it won't let you rest well in layout to see you woke up the other morning brother samuel missed we were somewhere i came here where was that and i asked my wife i said you sleep well last night she said i didn't sleep too good i said oh she said i can't sleep well knowing i got to do something the next morning i gotta go somewhere i gotta do something i gotta be somewhere i just can't rest well she said now if i know i'm gonna sleep in then i rest real good but knowing i gotta go somewhere i just can't oh brother you see why we can't get here comfortably out to see it because we know some more hallelujah some morning between six and nine we gotta leave here we got to leave here we got to go from here there's a place prepared for us then what are you saying i'm saying don't give up don't give in give it all you got what are you singing brother [Music] where i'm going [Music] if anybody [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh is [Music] gives me grace is [Music] oh [Music] [Music] me [Applause] all the parties [Music] [Applause] until i see my savior to be with my [Music] won't you worship me for just a few moments no i'm talking about jesus this morning hey i'm talking about the god that is the reason why you're sitting here today i'm talking about the god that was the go-between in a time of your troubles i'm talking about the god that stood between you and the cancer the god that stood between you and the disease with god that stood between you and the divorce the god that stood between you and the division and your family the god that stood between you and the church trouble i'm talking about the angel of the lord this morning would you give him some praise here today would you begin to give him some praise here if you know he's the reason why you're here today well jesus for this church [Applause] hallelujah you say brother andrew i think all this praising god's a little foolish david said for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep me in all thy ways brother member said each night of course the holy spirit is here wherever you go he's always there you never get away from him david said no matter where he made his bed god was there because the angels of god are encamped about those who fear him he said in our country down south we've got luke's they've got a lot of colored people that's very spiritual and they come to my meeting sometimes and they used to sing a little song for me i remember they used to sing an old kind of sister and sing it all day all night angels are watching over me my lord amen now listen what a problem god said he said so i always just almost had to time my hands to keep from running the meeting just jumping up and down and screaming and running all over the place now you didn't think i did that did you but i do he says i don't but he does it in me i believe if anybody felt the way i did they'd do the same thing it's just an experience yes sir it sure is you say but andrew how could brother branham give god praise and say it was an experience because he knew what it was like to be ready to go over the falls and be killed in a drowning flood but the angel stood there he knew what it was like to pick up a gun and tried to commit suicide but an angel was [Music] there don't know about you church but when i get to talking about angels i can't help but feel shouty i can't help but feel crazy i can't help but feel like giving god some praise because i know there's nothing i could have done or you could have done to bring me to where i'm at today and i also know there's nothing i can do to get me to the place he prepared but he's got an angel you know that song we sing it for us [Music] [Music] angels [Music] all night [Music] angels [Applause] is [Music] [Music] watching [Music] all day angels watching over me well if you get there before i do angels watching my over my family i'm coming too angel's watching over me see me through angel's watching is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] well if you get there before i do [Music] [Music] standing [Music] there are angels [Music] let us [Music] his presence [Music] [Music] there [Music] let us [Music] his [Music] can you say thank you lord jesus amen oh blessed be the name of the lord amen oh blessed be the name of the lord in the highest thank you lord jesus glory be to god hallelujah before we leave play that song in the presence of jehovah [Music] [Music] oh [Music] just take those
