wounded for our transgressions Lord and the chastisement of our peace was upon you Lord you bore our iniquities Lord oh God we look way to Jesus Grant it Lord this morning we pray father in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you amen if we could let's turn in our Bibles to 1 Corinthians chapter 11 amen and I want to go ahead and just read these scriptures as we are preparing to approach the Lord's Supper here in just a few moments and um amen I want to say it's good I see Colton here with us and uh it's so good to have him here you it's the second time that he's been here with us but uh he you if you don't know he's been coming to youth meeting and uh he's been for quite some time for a few years now so uh with little Aaron and they and so it's just been it's real blessing to have him here with us amen and uh 1 Corinthians 11:23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given things he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had slept saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do you as of as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do sh the Lord's death till he come wherefor whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat t one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that he come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I'm going to go ahead and give you a a title here this morning just what's on my heart heart and that is I'd like to just speak here and I'll get to some other scriptures on assuring our heart before him certainly we recognize that that's what the real gospel came to do was not to uh make us smarter make us more intelligent but it came to deal with the heart because the real the real question and the real where the real problem was at that needed to be remed was in the heart and there was nothing within the blood of bulls and goats all of those offerings were a type that was speaking that there was going to come a perfect lamb that through that blood which God's own blood that was creative blood that was offered for you and I it was not the blood that was a part of Mary or a part of anyone else God created that blood cell because all of the rest of the blood lined that was through the Earth was polluted there was was not a man even throughout that could have been searched out not one was worthy there had to be someone that not only would be willing to pay the debt I would say that if you think about it that when we look upon many times uh humanity and different ones we come in contact with uh you hear people on the job or in your family you would love to take the situation they have and and see that that situation would be dissolved or to see him help if if we don't have a desire to see someone else help then we first have to check check our own lives and see Lord am I really where I need to be and living where I need to be because once once you have met him your desire is to tell others of what he has done for you because you you are a living witness you are a testimony and that's what the Holy Spirit which was in that blood cell when it comes back upon you as a worshipper now you become a co-partner in redemption's plan it's the same life of God in you that Walked In the Garden of Eden that calls out to The Sinner that calls out to loved ones where are you and recognizing that that no matter the situation that's in that there is a God who is sufficient a blood that is more than enough to take care of the sin question and not only to do that but to bring a restoration to pay a debt but then to restore you back to your rightful position as a son and daughter of God and that's what the the Holy Spirit does the blood pays the price the blood sanctifies but the life on the inside of that blood cell is God's own life that's why the purpose the blood was shed so that the debt could be settled and that that life might come back upon the worshipper and put the worshipper back in the rightful position as a son and daughter of God so much so that it would bring nothing else can bring such a reality to the heart of a believer outside of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is what brings the Assurance in our heart the Lord Jesus over and over through the Book of John he would write that he says I will not leave you comfortless I must go away and if I go away I will send the comforter to you he says I will come again unto you now we did not receive the flesh body again but the same comforter the same God who was dwelling behind that Veil that came down to walk among us to understand you and I and now going to Calvary to pay the price not under deception Eve was deceived but this lamb Adam himself notice this that even the first Adam he walked out the first Adam knowing what he was going to do he knew he was going to take his wife sin if he did not take her to himself then Satan himself would or God would have been forced to destroy her right is that right so this is why that when God God coming down and God becoming becoming one of us to think of how that God he would take his sin or our sin upon himself he would pay that price he stepped out on our behalf and satisfied the debt and then he sends back his life upon us as as the worshipper to make us aware of it to bring an assurance to our hearts to settle the sin question to dismiss fear and he comes as the comforter he comes and gives you and I that life that we had before the fall right only he can do that this is why that Redemption itself as it speaks in the Book of Jonah salvation is of the Lord God will use men anoint men with his Spirit that's what Peter wrote of that we preach this gospel with the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven Paul said how can they hear without a preacher but how can they preach unless they be sent but it's not sent by man it's sent by God he is the chief Apostle of our confession he was the one who left glory on our behalf to bring to you and I the good news he could announce to you you and I when he stood there and even in his Earthly Ministry there were holds upon people's lives that were dismissed the woman at the well we saw the sick being healed but that was only a testimony that the Jubilee that you see in this vessel what has been restored and manifest in one earn vessel is going to be when this vessel is opened up then other Earth and vessels will receive that same life and be restored back to their god-given rights Hallelujah and that's what he's done for you and I that's what he's provided for you and I amen I thank God for that we are provided to be a partaker with him and to see that within this this scripture even that Paul would would write of here when we look in our text you know when we think of communion uh there's three things that God gave the church to do wanted baptism I'm talking about three physical things to be baptized he that he that heareth he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved it said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins that's the first thing and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost then the two other ordinances that he left was that of taking the communion and foot washing taking the communion as we come to take this bread and this wine the bread itself representing that God the word became flesh we ourselves could not become a partaker we could not become a full partaker of the word the Old Testament prophets had experienced the word would come to them they would speak and express that word they would live under that word that God would give to them and it was speaking that there was going to come a time where the word itself would not just come and depart come and depart but where that the people of God would come under and abiding for it said on whom to John on whom thou see the spirit descend and remain it's not enough just for the spirit to descend but he's got to have a place to remain and when he remains there then it's God restoring his judgment seat in the hearts of his children then it's not you walking by I can't do this I can't do that yet there's a part within that but it's you walking from a heart filled with God's own life and God is love amen your love and devotion is to him and to him alone so when we find this even in this aspect of even even that of the wine recognizing that of his own life as we spoke just a few moments ago it's God's Own Life coming to you and I as the worshipper the blood was shed for you and I and the life was in it to come back upon you and I and bring forth the same life that he lived Hallelujah is that right not that we are wearing you know uh we had to wear sandals and and you know long Palestinian garment and we have to no no no it's where our souls end on the inside our souls are conformed to His Image so it's not that I have to look like the Hoffman's head of Christ but with his Our Lives conformed to His Image it will make itself known on the outside that right so communion itself you know the prophet would say it like this it's a real strict one because it brings us to a showdown right now meaning a strict one now we don't have any closed Comm commun un here we don't have closed communion where bar the doors and you have to be a part of the of the assembly here and so forth no we our doors are open but we recognize that within this with being a real strict one a showdown that it that it's always a moment of reflection and I believe with all my heart that even as within our walk as a Believer and as we get closer to the coming of the lord we want to assure our hearts we want to assure Ure our hearts in a manner that I know that if he's coming in the next moment I'm going with him is that right that that's what that's what our desire is I I want to I want to have that Assurance I don't want to see how close I can come to the edge I don't want to just take well what I was a month ago I want to know I want to I I want to have that part about I want to be that honest with God that I can look there in the word and say Lord I'm not where I need to be Lord but help me Lord help me what the word is calling to me I want to ascend to that place I'm telling you when your heart is in that condition it's in a very good place that in itself is allowing the word to move upon your life and your heart responding and it allows God to move in a place and it brings you an assurance because you're looking to him amen oh my I B says it like this every Christian and what doest thou here should take communion it's your duty it's a showdown he said Jesus said if you don't take it you have no part with me right but he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eats and drinks damnation to himself that is watch how watch how the prophet explains this if you're still out in the world doing things of the world people see you taking communion you're doing wrong so in other words if there's a complete different kind of life and you are living in the things of the world the love of the world is still there in your life and and everyone else and there and there's nothing that's noticeable that there's a difference in your life then watch's what he says you're only bringing disgrace to you if it it'll harm you it isn't that it'll harm God it harms you so a person should examine themselves this is why that the token itself is to be on display the holy spirit is to be on display when they put it there upon the door notice it was put on the door and it testified of a work that had already been received accepted believed for those inside the house so the blood being on display which is God's own life God's own life being on display is a testimony that the worshipper has passed from Death unto life and there is a son or daughter of God on the inside is that right because now everywhere no matter it deplay it displays itself in public life it displays its life at the office it displays itself that's what the life of Jesus Christ does it makes itself known amen hallah Hallelujah so we understand uh and I think uh I find it very much so even in this city that we live in I find it very much so that even after God can take Hearts it's such a such a Catholic Spirit um that even after God takes a hold of lives and hearts we can still try to serve god with the Glorious truth he's called us to but serving with a Catholic mentality where it's just you know it's like everything look look what's look what with the whole thing I you know I don't I didn't come out of the Catholic Rel I I don't have have no background with it so I've had to rely upon others and you know you've had neighbors and you see things and you realize it is a religion of convenience it is something that does not require a real change right you see what good does it do to confess your sins to another man it's different if you when you're standing here you come up and say look God has brought this conviction on my heart you're not bringing it to me to confess it to me as though that I can do something but as a Son of God Anointed with God's spirit as a minister of gospel I'm commissioned by God to cast that spirit away and we'll stand as children of God and Chase the enemy off your land because there is a blood that speaks better things better things a blood that says you're free a blood that says you are a son and daughter of God there's a blood that speaks that voice has been unsealed amen so we find that even within that as I said that Catholic mentality you find I remember I had Neighbors at one time and I I looked I said I thought what are they doing well what it was is they had plans for Sunday so you know what had to happen is is they need they Saturday mass it brings it brings a religion of convenience wow Sun Sunday's going to be it's going to infringe so may just go on Saturday night before we go out and do our own things it's convenience right you see religion is nothing but just formality it's a covering but it doesn't deal with the real situation listen friends that same Spirit can come right around here in this message and I'm asking you don't look at nobody else let the word examine your own life sometimes we can get into a mode of well you know I come on Sunday or I come on Thursday or I come here or there no no it's not about a fulfilling of well you know I at least hit a few few Services out of the month it's not about that it's not about that there is a a record that's kept it's it's about Lord I want to serve you with all my heart that's what it's about it's not about well this is just enough that's you and I determining the limits but you understand it's got to be deeper than just what we say it's got to be from the heart we must assure our hearts before him this is what this is the whole reality of why the gospel is preached is that our Liv lives would be kept clean our lives would be led into the place to the word as we Feast on that word we build strength in our life to Fly Above things to instruct Us in righteousness so we understand that let me make this point that it's also as it comes to me that it's also it's not just you know coming up and I realize sometimes coming from the background well it says whosoever doesn't take communion and you know is it every week that they take commun UN in the in the Catholic Church okay see I'm I'm ignorant of that part every time they go through there and what and and they they have to they come in oh my if they don't do that you know that's why they cross in front of the church they they whatever that's is that's done they do that yeah is that right that's right but yet they believe if I if I don't do this if I don't come and do this and and and it's all wrong this coming to take the Lord's Supper it's not about oh if I don't do this I I'm not a part of bwt I I'm not a part of the body of Jesus Christ no let me say this you are a part of the body of Jesus Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then you are testifying I have taken the word into my life what I'm doing here is an act I am saying I have become part with the word is that right Jesus said except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you and those same things is what mzc gave Abraham after he overcame this is what came on the day of Pentecost now first first John chapter 3 so we understand that we're we're coming here as as a testimony as a witness I I'm here as a testimony doing it in remembrance of him I there as a testimony that to say he's coming how can you say that cuz he's already come what do you mean he's already come he already came paid the price and the Holy Ghost the same God had returned on the day of Pentecost and right now he's returned in his fullness he has come in my life I am part of the coming of the Lord and I'm testifying I'm here I'm awaiting I'm part of the coming of the Lord I am part if these the I am the reason that he took the seals off the book I'm the reason that he sent this message I'm the reason that he sent the Holy Ghost brother Samuel you have that out of that's too bold fake is not robbery to be equal with God because Galatians for because you are Sons he hath sent his Spirit into your heart you don't become Sons when the Holy Ghost comes you already were that's why this word has meaning to your life oh Hallelujah verse 19 of 1 John 3 this is where I'm drawing my my points from and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him for if our heart condemn us God is greater than our heart and knoweth all things so if there's something it's condemning just clear it out clear it out that's that's the that that's the best way to live clear it out if the son they say well I don't know airm just clear it out just clear it out yes beloved watch if our heart condemn us not then have we confidence toward God and whatsoever we ask we receive of him those two verses I wish I could just stand and preach on those for a Month of Sundays these two verses here is exactly where Satan wants to ensnare the Church of the Living God he either wants to remind you of all your past failures or he wants to keep you in a place to where little things that come about and we just allow things to accumulate and accumulate and accumulate and pretty soon where we could walk across this platform it looks like a hoarder lives here that's good that's good it accumulates accumulates and things we can accumulate the wrong things and you know what happens the channel of God's blessings it gets closed out upon our life that that joy that should be there in our life that enthusiasm for his presence for his word see that's always that's always a part as a Believer to diagnose and examine our life if there's time now listen there's times where there does come uh depressing or gloomy times but it's always to evaluate in that moment as a Believer Lord is there something something out of line with me is there something out of line with me how notice and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his Commandments now watch this we keep his commands so we observe those and do those things that are pleasing in his sight so what God is seeing I'm sure that every one of us know exactly what I'm speaking of that you you teas could be crossed perfectly eyes dotted in our mind but yet God don't just look at what we do here God looks down upon the heart because sometimes the things that we can be doing but yet we can have in here not the right attitude remember the Bible says have Hospitality without some go ahead say it without grudging they're grudging mean oh yeah hey we'd love to have you over house Lord have mercy couldn't why did they pick why did they pick this time Lord knows it's the busiest time of the year got to get taxes ready and everything else have Hospitality without grudging see down here down here this is why Paul could write and when he's speaking about of how that we are to press and to strive he said said do all things without murmurings and complaining Hallelujah that you might be without rebuke in this wicked generation that The Marvelous Light might shine I'll do it if ask me and pi God looks on the heart remember when God went to anoint David he sent Samuel Samuel he didn't know David was the one but remember he he went and he saw the tallest one the one that looked just exactly like fit the description and he's ready God says no he goes down through every SE every one of the Seven Sons but the eighth one is out in the field he wasn't even called that'd be like my wife having you over dinner and not let me know about it if there's one important part of the day that's an important part outside of prayer and everything else he was look look he wasn't even considered by even his parent and finally sa Samuel gets to the end and said hey there's got to be one be one because none of these are what God sent me here to anoint they got one more he said we're not going to sit down right until you bring him they wouldn't got him and they poured the anointing oil upon him but remember that anointing oil had to follow a sacrifice Samuel was afraid to go to that house because he knew what Saul had done even to other priests that had taken aside or to assist David so here Saul asked Samuel asked the question how can I go there and here God instruct Samuel go down under the cover of a sacrifice Hallelujah and say you're going to offer you're calling to a sacrifice why because without a sacrifice the true anointing cannot come and God in this hour in order for the Holy Ghost to come the sacrifice the true atonement the true Lamb of God had to step into view and this message has brought Jesus Christ off the pages into view that the works that I do shall you do also so the anointing follows the sacrifice and God finds every one of his children he looked upon the heart amen you know what God said he's got a Heart Like Mine you know as a real believer you're a part of God's heart Christ is the heart of God you were chosen in Christ in God is that right he's the complete thought but you are chosen in him and you are a part of his heart you are a part of the expression of God's [Applause] godhead oh my this is why God wants the very depths of our heart brother BR says it like this in the message communion he wants the depths of your heart he said Remember the very God that brought you here on Earth is the one you're serving he says you're doing this because he said so because it's his order then we want to come with deepness of sincerity knowing that by God's grace we have been saved and we love him and we feel his presence notice this is how how we're coming we know we have been saved we love him we feel his presence we see it change our lives our whole being is changed we're different people we don't live like we used to we don't think like we used to 1 Corinthians 10 verse 15 Paul said I speak as to wise men judge ye what I say the cup of blessing Now watch how Paul brings this and shows it to be the body of Jesus Christ the cup of blessing which we bless is it not the communion of the blood of Christ the bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of Christ I know I know that there's different ones of you that knew one another before you ever came to the Lord I know that some of you went to school with one another somebody you we know we did not have the fellowship that we have now because even fellowshipping around Earthly subjects of Science and biology and math and fad and and the everything all the important things lunch and recess and so forth no no that's not what we Fellowship around we might talk about that but that's not what's brought real Fellowship this Fellowship Paul's talking about we are a joint air a participant in one who shares an intimate heart like David spoke to Jonathan they spoke back and forth their hearts were inter knitted together with the same purpose that's why Paul could said regarding Timothy I have no other man likeminded meaning equal in Soul having the same desire the same purpose it's a fellowship that we have it's a communion that we have for we watch how he brings this now because look he became flesh his life the word became flesh his life living through the body making that word do what it said it would do right then he says for we being many are one bread many but we're part of that one bread we're we're not off here and off here no no we're part of that one bread we are part of the word and one body for we are all part partakers of that one bread so I say we must remember we're a body of Believers Paul would take a a time to express that you know and and and sometimes uh you know this past week I had different things that I dealt with with headaches and things and pressure behind my eyes and my head and everything and some of that started last weekend and ah my man I tell you nobody likes when your your body's aching but you know what because that my head was aching did not make my hand complain or my hand just say you know what I don't got time for you you know what I needed my hand I needed my hand to open the cupboard to get me some Tylenol I wanted molum but all I had was Tylenol I needed it I I I needed the assistance of my hand but now my hand could not solve problem problem s right that's that's that's that's not even my head it's what's inside of my head right right so even the parts that I cannot see I need every single part of the body this is why this is why Paul is bringing this and here we come and stand here together as we stand together to remember our journey here together of who it is that has brought us together and what our real purpose is it's a fellowship one with another under the blood of Jesus Christ I need my brother I need my sister we need one another Hallelujah is that right I love I love you know even my ugly feet I still like them because I like being able to stand up yeah even my my hands that a short stubby biscuit smackers I still like them you know why they help me get biscuits they help me get pieces of pie they help me they help me reach out and Shake Your Hand you let one little thing a little hang nail or something come up on it woo see this is why it's so important our walk with one another watch how watch how the enemy would like to come in and and try to trouble that that communion in the message Jubilee Year brother BR says if you have enmity against some neighbor against somebody else that's done you harm now not about what's done that you've done but what's done you harm and that person has done you harm if you in your heart can't love that person don't take that experience If It's Love in here it shows out here I'm just you know what if there's thing brother Samuel you ever been there before H are you kidding me and that's the first place I start is right here right here inside God fill my life with more of your love why that I can look beyond their fence not holding somebody as I am here to remind you you are guilty guilty guilty how's that kind for love that's not love love cover a multitude of sins because you know what love is it is a direct tie to the atonement of which I am tied into and this is why I'm saying if someone asked you to forgive them it is your duty to forgive them and if they haven't asked you it's still your duty to forgive them and forgiveness is not lips Jesus said if you don't do it from your heart then when you go to pray see these are simple principles in God's word that if they're not followed they hinder the word the Third they hinder the move of God Little Things little things oh my you must love those who do not love you if you love those who love you facebookers do the same Sinners do the same insta whatever do it but you got now not just to act like it in a religious life but from your heart you have to amen right now watch this brother Bram takes this scripture and I I think this is very important here because as we recognize and serving one another as we t one for another in 1 Corinthians 11:33 when you come together Terry one for another Terry means to wait it also means to serve right now I hope you understand friends when we're talking about what things of forgiveness we could preach months upon this there a things that we have if God leads us to do certain things like that we'll do it but I can tell you be honest with God if there's something that's in your heart that's not right let me tell you something brother Brown says it like this he says if you've got one ought in your heart against anybody you are in danger of Hellfire that's how important it is it's not just about that it's about your own life and your own walk with God true you realize if you can't go up and Shake somebody's hand and stand in their presence and talk with them something is wrong woo are you hearing me we can't say we're going to go in a Rapture that way we're not going in a Rapture that way it should not even be something that we should feel comfortable even coming and standing here you see what I'm saying then when brother ran talks about this being a showdown and a strict one that's how we ought to live our life it should not be well I got to get serious communion servic is coming up this is why brother BR says in this quote I'm getting ready to read he says this is one thing that keeps the People Prayed up but it should be prayed up I want to be ready to go I want to be ready I don't know when my number is going to be called I want to be ready I want to be available I don't know who God's going to ask me to make me minister to speak to or to witness to I don't know but I want to be available so my brother Ram he goes Brianna go to that second statement of let your life so shine before men right below paragraph 14 watch how he says we should come reverently solemnly sacredly right walking up confessing all of our wrongs praying one for the other not only that watch's this we should feel if there's a brother or sister Among Us that we feel is just a little bit out of line somewhere our hearts ought to be burdened for that person on communion night watch this especially to see them that they'll be able to walk up and take communion and not be condemned with the world because they are our brothers or sisters so something that we would see that maybe is not in line like brother Rand puts it in this of the weight or to T on one another this is where we serve one another this is where it's not us spying on one another it's not us sitting down and getting together over somebody else's house and we have a list of people that we just going to tear down that should not be there should not be I a pastor over a quote where the spirit of God in that Jubilee year where the spirit of God has convicted the prophet for being critical of other ministers that he saw things that were wrong but he said who am I to correct them and condemn them God corrected him and he dealt with that part of it but notice this waiting on one another they serving one another I'm part of the body like I said when my head was conting I needed my hands I needed it to serve that part of the body I didn't say what's your fault sinus cavities I mean look I mean it's not not my fault not my fault that the pollen's flying in the air it's not my fault that you know you don't have hair up there it's not my fault that you were sitting under a draft it's not my fault I know that I don't say that to be comical but Paul brought those things into the body right sometimes we're so interested in trying to if you'd have done this and this and this and this and this and this and this forgive us for not being perfect like you wow wow maybe your blood should have been shed wow I don't mean that to be I'm just trying friends look we have to look at our own lives and recognize we need God's grace for our own lives hallelujah hallelujah I don't care you know when a person is living where they should be and close to God you don't have to worry about them looking down on somebody else because why they've get in the right position and they got their eyes looking to him and knowing that they themselves are are a sinner as well saved by the grace of God Son of God true but they need God's grace every day of their life this is where waiting on one another comes into play God allows these this similitude these symbols to bring us into places where we are to live in our lives you know brother Brown talks about our neighbors he says you got to such a place nowadays he said somebody have to tell you your neighbor died you have to read in the paper it used to be neighbors were friendly they were neighborly not just somebody who lives next door to you now I look at those statements said over and over but I wonder sometimes how much of our life has been so taken to where we live in our own little world we don't consider anybody else it's my problems and I'm not listen I'm not minimizing you understand me I am not minimizing toils of this life you have pressures I have pressures but there's a place to let that pressure off God has called us as a body of Believers there's people that you will reach that I would never reach there's lives in where God will use you right that he would not use me in that way but there's also the need Among Us in the body to help one another to encourage one another the Bible says look not every man on his own things but also on the things of others see we're living listen to me very carefully don't don't don't pull up on me don't pull up on me you got to understand that's a spirit the Bible says this age is a spirit that is a lover of themselves decisions are made based on self and let me just tell you something I don't care how many services you said it first of all you need the Holy Ghost but even after the Holy Ghost has come every ser that you said it we need to it's true we need to set in the house of God but it will cause you and I to reain over oursel because there's a part about us then whether we want to admit it or not this guy is still number one that's right when it come I'm I'm I'm tired I'm tired but to wait on one another to wait on one another this is why brother BR says when you wait on one another you you see somebody that's out of maybe you You' seen him out running around with somebody else you've seen him out living in the world and you know dressing like the acting like just acting like the just just out in the world and there's no there's not even the slightest little bit of resonating in their heart you just see him just going out carelessly says you don't walk up in the communion line and jerk them out but he says you pray for him and he says then after that service is over he says you pray and you go to him and love and say brother forgive me but I noticed this I see you out here this reports come in brother let's let's get this confessed let's get it under the blood that's waiting on one another that's serving one another I don't want no one to miss it and not only that I I don't want Christ to be hindered do you want him to be hindered I don't want him to be I want him to move when I because we don't never know the needs that we have in lives that will come in here we want him to be free to move I don't want no hindrances that's why we are servants one to another now may one one place in scripture here numbers 15 verse 27 I want to read this because this is where the Lord was taking me to I want to read this because at times when we come into communion sometimes communion it's things that it's not always looked at correctly you can have things where people just they my you know they just feel like well I I'm not worthy well none of us are worthy but but but he's the one who makes us worthy he in me makes me walk worthy now watch this how God put this in in numbers 15 if any Soul sin through ignorance then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering and the priest shall make an atonement for that soul that sinth ignorantly when he sinth by ignorance before the Lord to make an Aton for him and it shall be forgiven him key word ignorance verse 29 you shall have one law for him that sinth through ignorance both for him that is born among the children of Israel and for the stranger that sojourneth among them but the soul that doth ought presumptuously whether he be born in the land or a stranger the same reproacheth the Lord and that Soul shall be cut off now this is the meaning then of what presumptuous is because he hath despised the word of the Lord yeah that's good that's good this is God's word I don't have to do that that's just their thought if it's God's word it's God's word but you see what's coming down to it's not even about the ACT it's about the heart behind it when the heart says that's and hath broken his Commandment that Soul shall be utterly cut off his iniquity shall be on him now I don't have time to read Hebrews 10 but this is what Paul's speaking of in Hebrews 10 when he says if we sin willfully after we've received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no sacrifice for sin verse 28 it say he despised Moses law died without Mercy under two or three Witnesses now watch watch through this this this portion of numbers 15 here I have a few more verses while the children of Israel were in the wilderness they found a man that gathered sticks upon the Sabbath day now remember that was a no no you don't work on the Sabbath day you don't gather there was not even man are going to fall on the Sabbath day right you don't go out and do that but here was a man Gathering sticks on the Sabbath day and they found him Gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron and unto all the congregation and they put him in Ward because it was not declared what they should be done to him so they don't know at this time what what do we do to this man is this man is in ignorance or is it presumptuous is it ignorance that he don't know what's going on or is it something that he's just stepping right over he just just it doesn't matter see now what's needed is it's not just condemnation because of the act we've got to know the heart we've got to know the heart and the Lord said unto Moses The man shall be surely put to death and all the congregation shall Stone him with stones without the camp and all the congregation brought him without the camp and stoned him with stones and he died as the Lord commanded Moses so he was determined the man didn't do it out of ignorance he just despised he just said just it doesn't matter it wasn't ignorance you see what ignorance is is when you don't know ignorance is when there's things that's stumbled into are you with me this is why listen this is why I I hope I hope you're hearing me now this is why the word of God it's not coming in a manner and saying well if you do this you're not bride if you don't do this if you no no it's where it comes down to if if you love the world or the things of the world then the love of God is not in your heart so what's it bringing it down to it's not acts it's what's in the heart are you hearing me it's what's in the heart this is why this is why that with things that when when if it's that way it just keep you up and down and and no no it's to realize if there's still a hunger if the hunger is for the world or the things of the world you've not arrived but I say Keep pressing are you hearing me keep pressing keep pressing this guy is always going to want a side with the world but I'm talking about this man on the inside here can I have just a few more moments I want to I really want to move this in I'm talking about assuring our hearts the Bible said Romans 8:16 the spirit beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God our spirit when we say well I I have the Holy Spirit then it will bear Witness with God's spirit God's word and that's how we know we're Sons and Daughters of God let me read from a sister whom brother Bram even speaks about how that she was even with some others listening to the message of the hour in her home and the pillar of fire came in and went right over the tape player they wondered what it was about and brother Bram says what that was it's God's showing you have accepted his message now that's earlier years I'm going to read 1964 sister Georgie Bruce sister Bruce says I make so many mistakes and I fail so many times right you mind we could put brother Samuel sister so and so anybody else feel that way yeah that's why Christ had to die so that you with your mistakes wouldn't be lotted to you he took your mistakes your desire in your heart is to serve him she says yes that's what he died for so you could serve him your mistakes are not looked or not lotted to you he is your prop situation he is your sin offering your sins are not known you're not a sinner before God God took your sins and became you cuz your desire is to serve him this is why the challenges even among for our own lives and among one another is because we know our own self we look at him or look at her in the mirror every single day that's why we must take the word above what even our own thoughts or what we even know about ourselves are you hearing me and the same way with that that's the same way with a body of Believers if you take a home that does not know Grace and for forgiveness and really Redemption if you don't know that then it's so hard things are so fragmented but in order for there to be a home to survive and make it it will take Grace forgiveness and Redemption it'll take the spirit of God in order for a church to thrive in order for a church to work in harmony as a body of Believers it takes the working of the spirit of God Ting Grace forgiveness Redemption one among another if not it'll never make the great right but you know what how could we forgive if there wern't people to forgive how could we well I want I want to be like Jesus he said forgive even as he forgave you see there's parts of the word that I'll be honest with you my flesh My Flesh My Flesh My Flesh don't mind I mean I really wouldn't want to walk on the water as far as out there but if he told me I could Walk On The Water I'm going to take him at his word I would probably first of all raise my hand and say I'll take care of that but what if he's asked me to go through a trial go through something where I am called upon to manifest that attribute of forgiveness our flesh will not raise that hand but God knows what we have need of when we have need of it he's not the the author of confusion or frustration he's got a purpose in mind is that right so to see that how that desire is to serve him notice God sees the desire it's not the ACT it's the desire on the inside notice sister Bruce says but I've never had an experience that I've been filled with the Holy Ghost that I could put my foot on notice he says ordinarily I love how the word answers this a human being is born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies that's the nature of a human being Sister Bruce says yes what do you say yes that was your nature it changed once but what changed it Christ there you are she had the answer to the devil's question the whole time but but you know I I picked up I picked up sticks on the Sabbath but see the word goes down the desire in your heart is to serve him the desire is not to walk over his word the desire is to come under his word the desire is to live for him the desire is to please him hallelujah it's not about I have to do this I can't do that I want to please him there's nothing that he can ask me that I wouldn't say yes Lord my flesh might say no no no but that's so on the inside says though he slay me I will serve him he paid the price so that desire could come forth and then the word brings the discernment ignorance not presumptuously not arrogantly not I oh no see this is this is this is word discerning our hearts First John 3 verse 8 he that committeth sin that word committeth means practice is of the devil for the devil sinth from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil whosoever is born of God do not practice sin that's what that word commit means you can look in your margin to scoffield Bible for his seed whose seed his seed remaineth in him his seed his life has come into that W seed in your life and it remains there it's his desire your heart has become the Judgment seat of Christ to where when there's things that not only that you would say that might be wrong because listen we don't all start out fully matured when God takes a hold of a life this is where you have to be careful among a body Believers when God gets a hold of a life there's maturing in your life like there's maturing in another person's life and God comes into things i' I've absolutely had things here over the years where some seems like people would want to crucify somebody else because of some sort of a a character thing and I said wait wait wait wait wait wait wait I would sit down and speak to and say wait wait wait wait this person has not come from the upbringing and background that you know about and what I don't understand is why are you wanting to crucify that's what I don't understand I don't understand that I I can't understand the spirit of Christ being that way now what matters is you know just to correct that I wasn't to put down if the person individual would all of a sudden responded and reive that and realize yeah that's exactly right it's not condoning maybe certain Expressions that are out there but let's have Grace let's let's get let's let's have Grace let's work to bring that one along that sister or that brother let's get next to them yes sir maybe there's certain words I'm not talking about cursing and swearing maybe there's just certain words that they tell people about certain things they're getting ready to do and you're like whoa that that's not Kosher man that might be out there and wherever more that that that's not just not but you see what it is a spirit of God moving around in that Redemption we work with one another to serve one another everybody with me my my my now watch this we have an advocate verse one of 1 John 2 My Little Children these things write unto you that you sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous and he is the pretu for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world so not only does he take care of the sin problem in our life but he is there to keep us clean represent us in the presence of God constantly we have one who stands for us and the spirit of God within us is what convicts us leads us to a place of repentance now does that mean think of this right here does that mean at times that we don't need the word to come down and correct us does that mean oh brother why why why didn't I catch that before why didn't I catch that when I said that like that out there that day but did you catch it now see what's important did you catch it now don't don't you don't you're wrestling with the wrong thing of why didn't I catch that before no it's God remember if we do not judge ourselves he'll judge us why that we be not condemned with the world God brings correction to our lives to help us and we learn from those things in our life watch this in the message adoption I have to lay this in how can you preach predestination of God's for ordaining and setting unless there's a sin atonement somewhere why is it each day you make a mistake each day you do wrong but if you're born again man or woman as soon as you make the mistake God knows you're sorry for it now that doesn't take away from repentance but he knows you're sorry for it and then that'll come forth you would stand in the Pres of presence of President Roosevelt or anyone else say I'm wrong God forgive me for this thing you notice he said that it says s i ns sins a sinner is a sinner he does not commit sins but the church commits sins does wrong gets a wrong thought wrong impression anybody been there well not me brother Samuel I don't get the wrong thought you got the wrong one right now I ain't never had the wrong impression you got the wrong impression right now we get a wrong wrong thought a wrong impression oh so and so I think so and so's got it out for me I think we get the wrong Impressions makes Scruples wobbles like a little child walking trying to learn how to walk he don't know how to walk good yet cause he's a little boy but we have a hand that reaches down it gets us steadies us and says make this step this way son he doesn't pick us up and spank us because we made a mistake he doesn't beat us to death because we're trying to walk he loves us like we love our children a real real daddy wouldn't whip his child when he's trying to walk if he falls down on the floor reach right down with a big strong hand and pick him up and take both hands a hold of him and say this is the way you do it son walk like this why we're not born fully mature but the Holy Ghost is the spirit of adoption it leads us to full maturity you know it's a spirit of God working in your life that brings conviction it's a spirit of God in your life that quickens that word that allows you to be teachable allows you to be led it's a spirit of God in your life that brings about humility in your life to the word and to one another well that got quiet that's what does it the spirit of God I think as we close here on this and prepare to come and gather around here what a moment to assure our hearts before him in his presence it's not something we we're looking at and even in our walk with God to we never want to take it for granted you never want to take it for granted you want to you want to assure your heart before him want to look if there's things that you realize that in your life in your heart and just if there's if there's a if there's a I don't care it don't matter what brother Samuel says it don't matter what listen it it listen it ain't about me if I if if if I'm preaching my opinion then I shouldn't be standing up here I'm not preaching my opinion when I'm preaching I can back up with the scripture and the message of the hour and if I can't if it is not within the message of the hour I am not pulling it from some other source sorry just just just not going there amen but we can pull it right from there and there's something within our hearts that says yes Lord be it unto me Lord according to Thy word oh my you you you might have been sure make mistakes sure we do but what's important is is have we been born
