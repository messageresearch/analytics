way for us that we're able to uh be able to gather together maybe not in the the way that we would be accustomed to and would desire to but uh just in this uh time the season this moment we just just felt pressed in our hearts and we just for a moment of time we just wanted to we're just going to return to the streaming I ask you um as a as the congregation that we make sure that you uh stay stay up to date with your email if your email address has changed and you're not getting an email there was an email sent out on Wednesday morning uh of this past week so if you have not received that or the Facebook post just please make sure that you uh provide the update uh to BS swt. office gmail.com and they can uh sister Roseanne can get that updated and and processed uh so that we're able to communicate with you um by all means if there is a need or something arises in the time you can reach uh Brother Richard Sanchez and brother Gomez um they you have their phone numbers available uh if you don't there is those that you can contact to get them uh also the prayer request link if you'll follow that by the email uh during this just like we did before uh everything if you'll just send it through there then we know that we can compile those and then the requests can be uh read and also made known um also tomorrow Lord willing there will be another email announcement that will be uh coming out uh just in regards to uh how that you're able to stay faithful in your giving during this time just as we uh did before um we certainly don't know uh we certainly don't know how often or how how many times or will this uh occur again as far as us when we come back together and then we have to go back to streaming we don't know that uh but one thing that we do know is for certain and that we can set our expectations on and that's is and that is this that if we are not able gather here in person uh within within a short time or in a moment we know one thing for sure we are heading uh to another gathering and that is that is the rapture and that's on and so we just want to be just just mindful of these things and I want to encourage you uh just to continue to to press on uh and looking uh to the Lord in in in every in everything in our daily life this is a time that we uh we live in it's a time that I believe that it's a time for the word uh to live and the word that has been living the word is to live it's a faith uh that is to be a living faith within our life uh in everything that we do is to trust the Lord uh that is that is our solemn trust and this is where all things that we see around us uh we see everything fading there is there is nothing we can put any trust in except that Kingdom that God has established within the hearts of his children by the Holy Ghost that's a kingdom that cannot be shaken that's a kingdom that that's a kingdom that can be trusted because that is his word so we just want to say we love you and we appreciate you and we just look forward to the time as we just continue to evaluate uh everything that is around us and that is present in this hour and we just want to go forward in serving the lord so um uh I think that's that's all that I want to mention right now by way of announcements um if you could at this time well let's just go ahead and we want to I'd like to go right into the word of the Lord here this morning and perhaps before we turn to the word uh let's just go to the Lord in a word of prayer Heavenly Father Lord as we just come before you Lord in this time we are we're just so thankful dear God that you've made away Lord and Lord you are our stability you're our strength Lord in this time and this hour that we we are living in oh God we ask Lord Jesus this morning as Lord prayer requests that were given and Lord we add to that also that I know there's no doubt many other needs and Lord we just ask ask that you'll just continue to move for Brother Bill in a very special way Lord and just for each and every one of your children Lord you know Lord the different needs that are upon the hearts Lord the hands that are lifted up out there oh God and we just pray that Lord that you will just come and you'll just Lord just direct the service Lord we know that though we are Lord separated visibly from one another but dear God we're not separated ated from your presence Lord we lord just desire to be gathered here this morning Lord around the word that the Holy Spirit would just Lord anoint us together Lord that we might receive oh God from you for you know our needs Lord you know the thoughts and intents of the heart oh God and I just pray that Lord that you'll minister to those needs this morning Lord as our faith Lord is just looking Lord to you oh God for every need and every request Lord we just Lord lay it all oh God before you and we ask in the name of Jesus Christ that you would just move in a very special way we pray on behalf of your children in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen as we read in Genesis 22 I want to come back into this place and I just want to encourage you as you're streaming there at home uh to to know that you know brother many times you hear what brother Bram will say uh maybe he says that was not for someone who's here but maybe it's for someone who was out there on the telephone hookup or someone who will be listening or someone who will hear it by tape and how many times we we hear that and to know that God he is mindful so your need and just in in everything just put it before God and let's just let's just join our hearts together and not allow uh any any separation that we might be in person don't don't allow that to hinder us but let's just put our all into this and let's just pull from God this morning in Genesis 22:1 and the Bible says and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham and said unto him Abraham and he said behold here I am and he said take now thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of Mariah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of and Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son and clav the wood for the burnt offering and Rose up and went unto the the place of which God had told him then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place a far off and Abraham said unto his young men abide ye here with the ass and I and the lad will go Yonder and worship and come again to you may God bless you and bless the reading of his word uh those of that are here is being seated and we as we we look at this this portion uh of of the scripture it's very much so when we see the life and we see what God uh did through Abraham it certainly was a shadow of what God would do through everyone of Abraham's seed and we know that Abraham's seed itself uh was not uh merely it was not pointing to just was not pointing to the Natural seed uh because we see a natural seed in terms of ishmail we see also the natural seed in Isaac that failed but we find that this seed that is spoken of is that Faith seed which would which would come forth as we know to be the Lord Jesus Christ and so so when we look here in in in the scriptures of what God uh has spoke to Abraham and I want to just deal with this part a little bit further this morning on focused in to the program of God and I I certainly believe that this is something it's not just to be in this hour but it is it is that which is to be about a life of a believer that our life is not just something that is to be uh just wonder in about but it is to really be positioned in Jesus Christ and to really be focused on what God's will is in this hour and to know that God uh has has has a word that God has given and God has revealed for this time and for this season and we look here in the scripture in in in Romans 4 and when I I look at this scripture in Romans 4 uh to notice of how that in in this of where the Bible says in verse 21 and Abraham being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform now remember in the scriptures that are around this this chapter here uh brother Brandon would write it like would say it like this he says whenever I get gloomy he said this is the chapter I go and I read Because in this chapter we find that in Abraham's life that there was a journey that started but when we begin to read here and I think it's maybe in verse 17 and onward you recognize that this correlates with what is taking place in Genesis 17 when God would reveal himself to uh Abraham as the almighty God elhadi the breasted one the strong one the nourisher the one who makes one fruitful and to see how that you know within this how God would even draw Abraham's attention you remember in Genesis 17 how that God would draw Abraham's attention even as he did here in Genesis 22 he would refer to Isaac as thine only son take thine only son the one whom thou lovest and to remember that you know God had told him your Heir is the one that will come forth from your own loins and remember after even God speaking that we we recognize that you know Sarah got to looking at uh the inabilities that she has and she uh as brother bam re says it she slightly doubted the promise and she said take Hagar and and perhaps God will give me a child by her but we recognize that God doesn't need any help in fulfilling his word God only needs yielded vessels to him and it's God that steps in it's God that fulfills his word as a matter of fact when it comes down to it for even the Christian Life there is not one person that can live the Christian life outside of God himself coming down in that life and then it becomes God in us living out his own word so we're just we become the yielded vessels unto God and this scripture I want you to look at this here in verse 21 it says and being fully persuaded and This this term fully persuaded it means to fill one with any thought a conviction or an inclination or a h to make one certain to persuade or convince one to be persuaded fully convinced or assured to render inclined or bent on and I I want to just say it like this this is not Abraham's thoughts it was not Abraham's thought in the beginning it was God's mind it was God's voice Abraham had received a supernatural call even when Abraham had left that of the ear of childes and received that call Abraham heard God's voice and it was calling him out and he believed what God was saying to him and the Bible says it was imputed unto him for righteousness Abraham was moving along as the voice was speaking to him but as it comes into this this place in Romans 4 this is this is no longer Abraham's Faith but this is God's faith moving in supremely in Abraham's life this is Abraham rece receiving God's own mind God's Own thought so now it's not Abraham's faith that he's walking by but it is God's faith God has been giving Abraham strength all along but now remember Abra God allowed Abraham to come to his end he had fed in ishmail his stream of life was still there in Genesis 16 but God allowed that stream of life to dry up Abraham could no longer father any children he was dead Abra and and Sarah even the deadness of her womb but this is the time where there was deadness now it's time for elhadi the strong one to step on the scene when God allowed Abraham to come to his end then God could step in do you see God can never step into a life until that life is willing to come to its end God does not put his life upon a life life but God allows a life to come to its end that that life it surrenders to him that God might fully bring his life in that it might be said that our life is a reflection of Jesus Christ so Abraham of where he's of where he's at within this time God's faith moving in remember it's in this chapter in chapter 17 that Abraham receives the change of his name he receives he receives uh the the spirit of God and he receives the adoption very quickly in that chapter of Genesis 17 he receives the very part of God's Own Name Elohim and that part of Elohim that latter part god takes part of his name and he places that upon Abram's name so he would be called Abraham he his life is now filled with God's own life his breath his life his nature it's now Abraham because now it will not be uh Abraham trying to father a child it will be God operating through Abraham's life and brother Brandon would say it like this he said it was that God was moving upon Abraham because Abraham would reproduce the faith of Elohim to think when God when in the very beginning his mind what God had in his mind God God already he believed his word God spoke his word God believed his word and his word came to pass and that's the same thing within the life of each and every one down Through the Ages it has not been their faith that has brought the word to pass but it is been God that would draw he would pull upon that part on the inside that was redeemable that was part of that word and the voice of God would sound out let me tell you something to just look at you and me how we were if just looking at us you could have no faith in us but God never had faith in this but God has faith in his word and God has sown his word though laying dead though laying dormant in our life but God has confidence in his word that when he speaks his word and his Spirit Goes Forth to raise that word up in our life God has confidence in himself so Abraham was was was anointed was called of God to reproduce the faith of Elohim you see even within our own lives God has given us of his own name we we do not take our own name but we receive his name and so Abraham in this journey that we look at here in Genesis 22 Abraham had not only seen the supernatural he had experienced the supernatural it's not enough to see it you have to experience it this journey that he's making is not based on what he seen alone you see there are many people that had s even in the meetings of brother random and saw the supernatural but never experienced it I'm not just talking about a healing of their body that's a that is indeed a supernatural work but the supernatural work that I am talking about is why God would make himself visible in his word because he's calling us to an experience by the word that is a supernatural experience and he appears and makes himself known that I am El shat ey your strength alone cannot do it but if you'll just yield to me I will bring my strength into your life and I will raise up my son and daughter on the inside it's God's desire you see just in the days of the Lord Jesus Remember many Saw The Miracles many ate of the Loaves and fish they saw the supernatural but that wasn't enough you have to experience the supernatural they had to go on into the upper room and receive the real baptism of the Holy Ghost it wasn't enough that they walked with him in Luke 24 and saw him step out of the Shadows that had to go to the upper room so you must not only be to be a real witness of the Supernatural is not just what you see or what you feel but there must be a genuine experience on the inside that no man can do no church can do only God can do that work on the inside let me just dwell with that Abraham was in the climax of The Journey he had already experienced a change where it changed them young again remember their bodies were dead as far as they're not able to produce the promise God allowed it to get to that place you know sometimes God has God will allow a life to get to a place to where they know I can't do it and when they're getting to that place and that's the time that God says they're getting ready into the place now where I can really get to a spot that they can be birthed into my kingdom but before that if a person walks and says well I can do this and I'm trying to do this and I can do this then God can't do anything he cannot even make himself his glory known in the real Supernatural transformation of his power you see in Hebrews 11:11 the Bible said through faith also Sarah received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past the age I want you to catch this Sarah through faith received strength to conceive seed and she was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had made the promise let me just say it you know as we read in the scripture when she journeyed down there and abamec beheld her in Genesis 20 he looks upon her she is beautiful she is fair he wants her to be a part of his kingdom she he wants her to be his wife but notice how God even when Abraham stood there and said once again tell them you're my sister even in that moment it shows that the program of God can never be overthrown God's program cannot be dismantled or overthrown his program marches onward you see in this here through faith Sarah herself to remember you know brother Brandon would place it like this in the message believest thou this he said you know he says it was Abraham's faith that produced the miracle in Sarah's womb now the Bible says Sarah herself received strength she had to receive re that strength that Faith had to become her faith it had to become operative in her life now think of this here is Abraham here now to reproduce the faith of Elohim God stepping in to Abraham and Sarah's life and transforming their bodies in order to meet the conditions of what the promise has called for now remember in the Old Testament the the the woman uh could not be saved but only through the circumcision of the man she had to come in in a union because the woman could not be circumcised it was the man that was circumcised so the only way that the woman could come into the Covenant and come into a circumcision she had to be United in a marriage Covenant with her husband and then she was identified under his seal and in the Covenant that is made with that seed so Sarah Sarah here being a type of of the in time bride even in this moment to where that we and ourselves and in the Gentile bride you you and I could never have come into the Covenant Promises of God we were alien aliens of the Commonwealth of Israel we were like Rahab we were like Ruth we were like all of them but there came one who would stand for us and a union with boas brought Rahab in a union with with Simone brought Rahab in hallu it's like the daughters of zad they had no way to get into their inheritance the only way is there had to be a kindred of their father's tribe and they would have to marry him and he would bring them into that Covenant and that's the same way in Jesus Christ we are brought into the Covenant by the baptism of the Holy Ghost this is a circumcision that's not made with hands Paul would lay it so clearly this circumcision remember circumcision was a sign that God placed in the flesh of Abraham as a seal of the righteousness of of his faith so that Sarah herself would be under that same seal that Abraham was sealed by oh my we are under the same seal that God sealed his son we are under the same seal that God has sealed his word in this hour we are sealed with the book we are under the same designation and the Seal of God's own life that same seal and this is this is where as we find under that Union it's God's faith Paul sading through it's God's faith moving through you see it's that same revealed faith of the hour it was Abraham's faith that performed that miracle in Sarah's womb Sarah was United with that faith that same revealed faith of this hour is the the same faith that Jude wrote by admonition contend earnestly for the faith that was delivered to the Saints this is not human Faith this is God's faith coming down because it it would be and it has to be God's faith in order to reproduce the promise this is where Satan he's tried to trample underfoot he's trying to trample it underfoot that same faith that same original outpouring of the Holy Ghost that word that true experience that word birth that new birth all of them being the same he tried to trample it out but you see the faith of the Son of God has prevailed through the Church of the Living God all the way down through the Gentile ages there's been some Believers the scripture denotes them as the Overcomers in that age he that ha an ear let him hear what the spirit said to the church endowed with the ability to hear God's voice not just see the supernatural but become an absolutely Supernatural work themselves of the Living God oh my and to see how God himself even moving in this time it's the same Faith that's present in the bride body of Believers it's that same faith that same faith that Paul would write of we you know referring to it very often and Paul would say the life that I now live I live by the faith of the Son of God not my faith God's faith remember through the scriptures as we looked at it last week when Jesus would say uh daughter thy faith hath made thee whole he would say thy faith has done that and we recognize you have to have faith but for that in order for that come to come to pass he would take now God coming down and recognizing that Faith his brother R would say your faith and my faith together now he said God will step down and his faith is what will bring the miracle to pass and so Paul said it's not the life the life that I now live he lived a different kind of life before and now live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me so as we read in Romans 4 Abraham being not weak in faith this was not human Faith this was not this was not faith that we see uh faltering in the other chapters and you know here and and moments because God was dealing with Abraham in in each Junction of time but when it came time to reproduce the promise it would require God's faith supremely alone now the Bible says that Abraham as we read in our text that Abraham he said to his young men abide you here with the ass and I and the lad will go Yonder and worship and come again to you what faith Abraham did not did not know what was going to take place but he knew one thing we're going to go and worship and then we're going to come back to you in other words the form that I have Isaac with me now he's going to come back in that form and Abraham the Bible says in verse six he took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together I want you to think of this as God would make this known to Abraham you know brother randam and dramatizing and he said perhaps God spoke to Abraham on a Sunday afternoon and then Monday came around and you know how Mondays can be be sometime it's a time that brother B tells us he said after what God has in all the confidence he's instilled in you in that service the enemy wants to come and try to knock it out of you so to think of the things and and the thoughts that would be trying to come in Abraham and and all of these things look what God God has given you this child look what and and and now God is asking you to take this child to take this child and to offer it up but you see Abraham brother R would say it like this and I I just believe this he said Abraham could look there on that Monday morning and he could look at Isaac and he knew what God had said and he would look at Isaac and he said his heart just going out there he said but Abraham would have to turn from that and Abraham looked to the word of God God took something that was so dear promise that he had given him and now Abraham here in the midst of that he turned his Focus completely to obedience to the word he made ready one of the opening scriptures we read here the Bible says that Abraham chopped wood I don't know about you but sometimes there's things that we have to do that you know what it takes a lot of motivation to do it it's easy when there's certain things that's asked that kind of goes along and everything's going all right long as it don't inconvenience us as long as it just you know keeps on going a certain way that's all right but see Abraham the Bible says he prepared the wood when Abraham he prepared for this journey Abraham could even the wood the sacrifice all the knife even the sharpening of his knife Abraham did not say well if I forget the knife then we won't be able to offer him up but he took fully he knew what it meant to sacrifice and Abraham took everything that was required he had offered sacrifices upon altar upon this altar but this was the final altar of Abraham's Christian Journey everything had prepared him for this moment let me just say this to recognize when you and I are standing in the blending of Time and Eternity standing on the very verge of the change of the body they that have went on before us the Bible says they without us should not be made perfect it's we can't get by with anything less we must come through every process that that God has laid out every word must be word on top of word on top of word every line upon top of line that right there speaks of a real true experience it's not just the letter of the word but it's to have the spirit of the word and to have that genuine birth on the inside that is word on top of word line on top of line precepts on top of precept Abraham he made ready for the miraculous you see Abraham he was already prophesying we're going to go worship me and the lad we're going up there we're going alone and we're going to come back down here we're coming back down here we're going up there we're coming back down here he made ready for the miraculous to take place you see you got to make ready for the miraculous it's the people in this hour you see God has sent what's necessary in order to prepare us for this great translation he said in John 14 let not your heart be troubled if I go away I go away to prepare a place for you that where I am there you may be also you realize he made the necessary preparations for you and I that preparation is so that we could die and be born again he made preparation for us he prepared the way he opened the way for you and I it had to be a preparation it's just like when God remember here coming to to the Earth uh into fulfillment of Isaiah 9:6 there were scriptures that were laid out that the messenger should come first Elias shall come all of the scriptures that were were set forth and laid out and we see it identified in John John's Ministry that it was to prepare the way it was a message that would all them to repentance a message that would remove all of the obstacles and the everything so that the word might have free course so God has sent a necessary preparation and this is where I love how brother Ram says this in the junction time he talks about Noah building an ark he says he was not only working a miracle but he was preparing for a miracle the church today is not only only having Miracles but it's preparing for a miracle the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and the Rapture of the church to be taken up he said give me a church ready visualized to see signs and to see the omnipotent God the great power of God moving amongst the people which the Rapture will be an easy thing when Jesus comes they'll be caught up because they believe in such Hall you can't believe in a miracle like this until you first become a miracle amen amen you see Abraham was not only seeing the supernatural he had become a witness and experience of the supernatural he knew how God had come and so transformed his life you see this is why through the revealing of the word signs that take place we see God working and God moving right here Among Us right in lives and you see to also see lives and to know see to be visualized is to see the supernatural God coming and transforming lives not making well we're going to make better people that is not what God comes to do God comes to raise up that dead man on the inside that son or daughter of God that seed that's been laying there dead the whole time and to be United with him to become a miracle and you know when you become a miracle it's not anything you can explain it's not anything that you had anything to do with it's what you surrendered yourself to that's the Simplicity of the Gospel is a surrender to his will the Bible says in 1 John 2:27 the anointing which you have received of him abideth in you and you need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing teacheth you all things and is truth and is no lie even is even as it ha taught you you shall abide in him notice the anointing the word the person that you have received of him he's the one that is teaching you he's the one that's opening the word he's the one that is revealing the program of God he's the one that's revealing the direction and the leadership in your life it's him taking the word and unveiling that word notice he goes on to say and now little children abide in him that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming if you know that he is righteous you know that everyone that doeth righteousness is born of him John goes forward to say in 1 John 3:1 behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of God not we're going to be we are now the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is because remember in in the times when we look at with Abraham's life God appeared to Abraham many times appeared to him in the revealing of his word God had visited him there we see in a Time and MDC as God revealed himself then we see over here we see how God would Veil himself in that little white light we see how that God would step down and take the elements of dust in Genesis 18 and Veil himself and here in each of these times it's God appearing according to the promise and to recognize that it's to receive his appearance it's to receive God coming in the form of his word and making himself known making himself real when God Reveals His word that's God's voice it's God calling our names it's God calling to that son or daughter on the inside you realize the scripture said that he that I behold I stand at the door and knock that's not what it is on your heart like that but his knocking is his voice that's calling your name that's speaking to your life and say don't you want to turn your life over don't you want to surrender your life don't you want to yield your life and brother B said and for those who have yielded their life that voice on the inside re resounds out of your life and says aren't you thankful you surrendered your life to him it's yielding to him you see it's making ready because in order to see him and to be a part of the Rapture the change of the body that promise there's got to be a change a transformation a new birth on the inside first without the token without the new birth there is no Rapture it's something much much deeper than a good life it's more than a righteous life it's a holy life produced by the holy God by a Holy Faith that moves down on the inside you see we are assured this is where John is writing by inspiration we know that we when he shall appear we shall be like him because right now we have the identification the same same experience that he had he is our he is our Elijah that threw back the robe of his Spirit back on us his same life that same spirit and and and the same life that lived and was reflected God's own life through that body through that life through that predestinated seed is the same life that comes back and reflects God's word and that's why the confidence that you and I can have we see the works that I do shall you do also it is the same life reproducing itself in a bride body in your life where a transformation has taken place it is the assurance that my body shall be changed Abraham is walking to Mariah Mount Mariah with assurance verse three and every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure every man that has this hope this expectation that faith has set in your life every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure this the wording in the scripture is not entailing as though this is something that we are doing on our own but the word term purifieth here it deals with the burnt offering it deals with an offering up of a life a surrendering of the life remember here that work that God has done even as he is pure even as he surrendered and yielded up his life even as he said I come not down from heaven to do my own will but the will of My Father which sent me his life Calvary was not just where he became an offering his life was an offering he surrendered his will when they tried to pull upon his feelings and his emotions he surrendered to the will of God this is where it's a purifying life a life that is that is offered up a life that has been raised by the quickening power of God into Heavenly places in Christ Jesus wherein we reflect that our life were're a delicate delegate of that New Jerusalem just like a represent is We Stand we sin from Ohio or the local communities and we sin to represent us we are we are delegates of that New Jerusalem our life the life that we live the life that's lived through us that life that appears before others it reflects our destiny how you live and conduct your life now shows your destiny Hallelujah Genesis 22: 2 God speaks to Abraham and just to move this part in here he says take now thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest and go to mount Mariah and offer him there for a burnt offering Abraham had another son ishmail is is was also the one that remember when God is revealing himself as the almighty God in Genesis 17 and God and even when he says do not call your wife sari anymore call her Sarah remember Abraham himself he laughed and said shall she shall he but you see here in the midst of that of Genesis 17 here is where the word is going forth here is where God is revealing himself as elshad and remember in that moment this is where even Abraham says oh God that ishmail might live before you but you see even though ishma was also a son that Abraham fathered and you see in Genesis 17 where Abraham is also looking at himself but there's a transformation that takes place in Abraham's life Paul by inspiration picks up the effect of God revealing himself as the almighty God can't you see that the word itself sometimes when the word has its coming forth you and I can look at oursel but the word has a prevailing power within it that God's word it will not return back to him void it was God who moved on the scene it was God who brought that forth in Abraham's life when Abraham returns back into Camp he does not return back saying sari but he returns back into his Camp saying Sarah there's a there's a power within the word I I say it like this and we just yield to what to the word of God don't try to figure it out don't try to look and say how's this going to be you're a Seed of Abraham just believe what God has said he's big enough to back it up amen the Bible said he was fully persuaded that what he had said he was able to perform Abraham's Focus was not on what God had said so much as he was upon the one who said it because just to look at the letter alone it kth but the spirit giveth life oh glory be to God thine only son so God had a specific meaning here the son of the promised word is who I want ishmael's already been put out of the picture there's already been a separation the shock has already pulled away from the seed are you with me now the Sun that came by the faith of God moving down into Abraham's life and gave Abraham the necessary germ ishmael's out of the picture let me just say ishmail was what sari is slightly doubting just slightly doubting and ishmail ishmail you can never offer to God your own creation of Holiness well Lord I'm not doing this and Lord I do this and Lord I I help out I do this at the church or Lord I do this for people or I I give food baskets or Lord I do this or or I do that you can't offer God your creation of Holiness or homemade self-made righteousness outside of it being God's Own righteousness it's homemade it must be the creation of himself in you his spirit that comes on the inside to Quicken you see you're not of that Bond woman that that that seed that's on the inside that seed is not of the Bond woman this first birth the nature that controls this first Birth has to die God don't want to try to make him over God don't want to try to clean him up God's not trying to save that old man he wants to kill him that he can raise up that seed on the inside are you with me because anything else is an ishmail and God doesn't want ishma Ishmael can't go to mount Mariah Ishmael can't go in the the Rapture the son of the Bond woman will never ever take the Rapture there's got to be a death a new birth a new life you've been changing your own Nature has died and the new nature of God's own life is now flowing through that seed word that he swed in you and is raised up that's the part let me just say it like this that's the part of you that that's really him the part of you that's really him is that seed on the inside that's the part that he made the Covenant with when God told Abraham I will make my co my Covenant is with Isaac him will I make my Covenant I'll Bless ishmail yeah ishma be blessed he'll have children he'll do this and he'll do that but my Covenant is with Isaac this ishmail right here gets a lot of blessings this ishma he likes material things this Ishmael receives those things of material but the real Isaac on the inside the real blessing that he receives is The Blessing of Abraham it's the real that's that's the that's the real reality the Holy Ghost that's that part of the the contract the Covenant that comes down you see the scripture let me just refer you to a few places this is why Paul would say in the offering up of our life that you would present your bodies a Living Sacrifice notice how Paul presents this in in Romans 12 holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service notice ye present your bodies you have control over your life because Christ you have been birthed into him it's his spirit in you that's directing you as a son and daughter of God you now have control it's a spirit of righteousness that guides and directs and brings this body into subjection it's the spirit of Christ within us that says no I'm not I'm not going to allow ow those thoughts to remain I'm not going to how hold those feelings I'm not going to it takes a discernment it takes the the the quickening power of God on the inside because this is still the sticky part but this is where he says You must present that you would present your bodies a Living Sacrifice not conformed to this world but transformed by the renewing of your mind now it's not talking about the matter here it's not even talking about this the just the the spirit the human spirit is talking about the soul the nature a transformation that you might prove declare show forth what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God you see this is why when when the Bible says behold what manner of love he hath bestowed upon us to call us the sons of God you see God calls you what you are you can go a long time before you recognize it and surrender to it and believe what he is saying but nonetheless it takes one of your own kind to tell you who you are this is why Paul would say even in Romans 15 verse 16 that I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles ministering the gospel of God that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable being Sanctified by the Holy Ghost this is the this is the only way that the offering up of the Gentiles that the Rapture this is the only way to be a part of the body of Jesus Christ is there was a seed laying there within you all along and the Holy Spirit seeks you out and brings you to himself that then through his life you might the offering up the giving of your life might become acceptable our life everything that we we could try to do it must be under the direction of the Holy Ghost this is why Peter would say in 1 Peter 2:5 as Lively Stones you build up a spiritual House of holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ there's only one only only one way only one place of acceptance that's in him you see Abraham let me just try to bring this down to close Abraham was expecting the supernatural every every experience that he had had led up to this time but remember he was walking to mount Mariah with the experience that brought a change in his body he was walking to mount Mariah with a transformation that had come where the promised son of what the word had spoke he was walking there with this living reality you see the Bible says in Hebrews 11:17 by faith when he was tried he offered up Isaac and he that received the promises offered up his only begotten son of whom it was said that in Isaac shall thy seed be called accounting that God was able to raise him up even from the dead from whence also he received him in a figure he accounted he thought he laid it to God's account this is something this word accounting here this word deals with reality let me read it to you it is this this word it means that if I reckon that my bank book has $25 in it it has $25 in it otherwise I am deceiving myself this word refers to facts not suppositions Abraham was walking not with an imagination he had a living experience the supernatural was right there with him I am the lad will go Yonder and worship and we will come again this was not an imagination Isaac was right there Abraham could look at him each time no doubt through this journey remember it was three days no doubt even as the journey would go on Abraham the Bible says he accounted that God was able to raise him from the dead because he had received him from the dead and so what was he resting in what was he resting in notice brother Ram would saying like this he said God took away even the hope that was there that you'll be the father of Nations this one in whom that God had promised but Abraham said brother BR dramatizing it he said Abraham saying oh my yeah hope is gone but I still have the word I still have the word Abraham journeyed to mount mariia on the word of the Lord it was real to him Abraham how is this going to happen I don't know how is your body going to be Chang I don't know how is the rapture going to be I don't know but I know he's already spoke it so shall it be it was a reality it was what Abraham was resting in let me just say it like this let me just read this to you in closing this is out of the patriarch Abraham I love this quote the BR says after Isaac had come on the scene we found out we find out that God gave him a double test after now being 115 years old or 20 Abraham was he said I want you to take this your only son take him up the mountain that I will show you and there offer him up on this mountain for a sacrifice in other words destroy every evidence that he had that the promise would be fulfilled that's taking away all the natural things God allowed every bit in this and this right here reasoning can't even stand reasoning has tried to come on reasoning brought an ishman Sarah even standing there looking at her own condition reasoned but then it was that faith that God had revealed there to Abraham Sarah was United with that same faith and that faith it transformed her life and in this moment journeying to that place all natural things feeding where where you cannot rest there's nothing in the natural that you can rest upon let me just tell you something this in itself there's already been raptures that's been before us there was an Enoch he walked with God and had a testimony that he pleased God Amen there was a an Elijah that was translated Jesus was caught up with the Old Testament Saints is that right so you see there's already been but remember there there's not one thing that you and I can do to produce this Rapture it is solemnly in the hands of almighty God and I say in the name of the Lord be sure that you are in his hands because it is he alone that brings forth the Rapture it's not a church it's not a man that whole unfolding of the Rapture is even taking place there's a gathering that's already went been going on with a shout the message that God has sent it's been Gathering us in Christ the shout the living bread of life get under the blood get under it get the token be born again living bread of life get in Christ get in the chosen place of worship takes away all the natural things and Abraham said I received him as one from the dead and I'm fully persuaded that he is able to raise him up from the dead listen to this that's the people now the Seed of Abraham because he raised us from the dead we were dead in sin and trespasses and he who was able to change my mind change my thoughts change my nature change me all over he can do as he pleases whatever he says I believe it's the truth and every Seed of Abraham believes the same thing so how is the Seed of Abraham journeying into the promise of God by receiving the promise of this hour by receiving the transformation in that life the New Birth the token where you know I once was dead but now I am alive the love of the world has fled from my life and it's the love of the father that pulsates in my life I am not an old creation made over it is a new creation in Christ Jesus Abraham how are you going to mount Mariah I'm going there with my own only son your only son yes the one whom God has brought forth through my life how are you going in the Rapture what is it that is going to be raptured it's the character that image that is of Christ on the inside and that that very rapturing of that life then what will God do there will be a transformation of the atoms of this bodies for those who are Li and remain shall not hinder or prevent they in that other dimension will break forth they have went on they have entered into their theophany they are there waiting on us they're waiting on the finishing up of the climax they themselves have went on and made up that part of the bride and they are waiting they are longing for that time and the Earth is groaning and travailing and waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God they will break forth from that realm and they come and as they appear we'll know our changes on its way they'll receive their glorified body our body will be changed and we'll go to meet our theophany so how are we journeying how are we going I wonder as Abraham would go and reach over grab a hold of Isaac how did Abraham encourage himself he would look and say God you raised him from the dead there wasn't an ounce of hope that I had Sarah or me there was no hope but this this is a miracle he could see the miracle in his own body and he could see this miracle where was his encouragement the same way our encouragement is in this hour you cannot rest or take hope in anything else out here you can't even take rest and hope and you know with some predictions here or there but the real place of our joy our Isaac our laughter our rejoicing is in the work that God has done inside of our life that's our real joy that is the joy of the believer that's the joy that no man can take from us that's a joy that's lasting it's real I tell you this journey it behooves each and every one to check up and be sure be very sure and those that are sure what an assurance where you have the testimony as Paul said the life that I now live not I that liveth it's Christ that liveth in me that's our joy that's our rest that is the supernatural work of almighty God or we have a confidence that our future is clear past there is no more past it's been not just cut off but that old nature that one that used to live here is submitted come in to the place to where God moves to kill him that the man on the inside that seed might come forth I encourage you as we walk in this time in this hour this is to be our Focus this is our joy this is our strength and if you don't have that Joy let me just tell you I just I give you a real straight warning don't try to present to God an ishmail God won't accept it God won't accept your works well I do this for you Lord or I do that God don't want your ishmail the only thing God wants to do is kill him so that Isaac can come forth because your righteousness my righteousness is filthy rags any Holiness outside of it being God's holy Life coming through God does not accept if you're in Journey right now in your life and don't just say I'm in Journey and you you sit around in the same place you've always been setting for years you're not in Journey you become complacent you become laxed you've got to be in Journey you've got to be moving you've got to go on to the promise go to that place to where you become United with Jesus Christ to where now you are united with the circumcision of the Holy Ghost to where you're in the Covenant with him and every promise in him becomes yay and amen this is a place that we journey journey to know the god that raised up changed my life the God who changed me I couldn't change myself the God who brought the change in my life is the same God that will change my body how's it going to be I don't know that is not my business that's God's business let's pray Heavenly Father what a confidence Lord that we can have in you and Lord I pray that if there's any life Lord any heart that do not have that confidence I pray God may they Lord lay themselves before you according to your word and allow you to do the Kinsmen work in their life may
