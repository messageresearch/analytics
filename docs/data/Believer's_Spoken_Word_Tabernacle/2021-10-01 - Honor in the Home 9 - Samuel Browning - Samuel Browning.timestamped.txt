[35:32] unseemly and that's where we really want
[35:34] to continue to draw from it does not
[35:36] behave

[35:39] unseemly

[37:36] i just lord willing here i want to i'm
[37:40] not going to do it tonight but lord
[37:41] willing i want to have some of the
[37:44] brothers when we went there to the men's
[37:47] meeting and i'll probably speak a little
[37:48] bit more about that at the beginning of
[37:51] sunday's service but
[37:53] it was certainly a real
[37:55] refreshing and rewarding
[37:58] time that we had there together
[38:00] and just
[38:02] just a great uh a great
[38:06] time fellowship around the word
[38:08] you know when you
[38:10] consider it and i know there's some
[38:12] others that's been there as well
[38:14] you have
[38:16] all together seven services in three
[38:19] days
[38:21] so
[38:23] that's saturday is just you you get up
[38:26] on saturday and saturday it's non-stop
[38:29] and so
[38:31] we just we had just such a wonderful
[38:33] time god was so gracious uh even through
[38:36] the ministering of the word i really
[38:38] appreciate your prayers and just to see
[38:40] how that god just just moved so
[38:44] marvelously among us there and i know
[38:46] that the brothers that that we had just
[38:49] such a wonderful trip down there
[38:52] and we had a good we had a good trip
[38:54] back as well and uh yeah we thank god
[38:56] for safe traveling mercies and
[38:59] the only snafu or hang up we had was
[39:03] going through
[39:04] a state where everything was locked down
[39:07] and closed and you know trying to find
[39:09] somewhere to eat you know and you just
[39:12] boy i said we're already being put to
[39:14] the test right after this meeting
[39:16] [Laughter]
[39:17] i mean may god help us you know you
[39:20] start thinking maybe we should have went
[39:21] the other way down back that we came
[39:23] down you know but uh god was so so good
[39:26] to us and and um
[39:28] so we just we really thank the lord for
[39:31] his mercy
[39:32] and his grace
[39:33] you know um
[39:35] one of the things that i we even when i
[39:38] think of it in the time and the hour
[39:40] that we're living in and i don't know
[39:42] how god will we'll take it even in
[39:44] coming services but i i would say this
[39:46] one thing that i put before
[39:48] the brethren down there in speaking
[39:52] in some of the sessions there is that
[39:55] we're living in a time
[39:57] that
[39:58] we what we are seeing in this generation
[40:01] is the actual
[40:03] product or manifestation
[40:05] of where the prophet
[40:07] by inspiration could see the outcome of
[40:11] the seeds that were being sown
[40:13] back there
[40:15] we're not seeing seeds now we're seeing
[40:17] the product
[40:19] this is harvest time and not just wheat
[40:22] all is coming to harvest
[40:24] everything is coming to maturity
[40:26] and so with that in mind the ways that i
[40:30] i look just being pressed of the lord to
[40:32] look at it
[40:34] that we we cannot as take anything
[40:38] for granted
[40:40] and just take it in a manner then well
[40:42] this will just come automatically this
[40:44] will just come this way or this
[40:46] but satan is very subtle
[40:48] and yet he's very intentional in all he
[40:50] does he's got a motive and he's got his
[40:52] objective
[40:54] brother bram tells us how he studies our
[40:56] life and he waits for just a moment he
[40:58] waits to see where is that word at in
[41:01] our lives
[41:02] and so
[41:04] my my challenge not only to the brethren
[41:07] there but i just bring it here forward
[41:08] tonight is that if satan as he is
[41:12] intentional
[41:13] we are to be very intentional
[41:18] we we're to be i mean it things that we
[41:20] we do
[41:22] uh the things that's just like how god
[41:24] would has has led us and we're dealing
[41:26] with these things even
[41:28] within first corinthians 13 and how the
[41:30] holy spirit been dealing with it in
[41:32] terms of of the marriage covenant and
[41:34] those things like that it is a time of
[41:37] great intention it's nothing to be
[41:39] assumed
[41:40] because when because
[41:42] this this is the mind of god
[41:46] this is god's mind the prophet tells us
[41:48] in written form
[41:50] now it takes the holy spirit to bring
[41:53] this to life to where we can read a
[41:56] verse but when god gets a hold of it
[41:59] it's no longer just a verse it becomes a
[42:02] living reality that we are standing in
[42:04] front of and there is an examination
[42:07] that takes place in our life or should
[42:09] be a reflection that we take inventory
[42:13] and say lord i see a lack here
[42:16] i'm asking for strength that that might
[42:19] be made flesh in my life lord
[42:22] let it drop down from just my knowledge
[42:26] of agreeing or just saying that is true
[42:28] but let it drop from my head down into
[42:31] my heart let it come into that place to
[42:33] where it's no longer conscience but it's
[42:35] subconscious
[42:37] and that's why we need as the word is
[42:39] ministered before us we need the living
[42:42] reality of jesus christ
[42:44] because god comes to fulfill his word
[42:48] he's the one that puts upon the garments
[42:51] of his word and makes them manifest to
[42:54] you and i
[42:55] and so when we we look at this here
[42:58] in the scriptures in first corinthians
[43:00] 13
[43:01] and i want to just move very quickly
[43:03] into where we were dealing the very the
[43:06] last time on thursday we were together
[43:09] and we were drawing out of out of
[43:11] ephesians 5
[43:13] and which we have been with that of a of
[43:16] a husband and a wife and i want to just
[43:18] say it in this which i've said it over
[43:19] and over but it behooves to be
[43:21] reminded in this time paul is writing to
[43:24] believers in ephesians 5.
[43:27] there's other scriptures there's other
[43:29] parts that pertain to one who has a
[43:32] believing spouse and to one that and and
[43:35] this other the spouse is not a believer
[43:38] there's writings for that and paul takes
[43:40] into account knowing that there will be
[43:42] situations like that as well
[43:45] but i i believe with all of my heart
[43:47] that even within those situations like
[43:49] that i believe when we look at ephesians
[43:52] 5 just like when we read first
[43:54] corinthians 13 there's something about
[43:56] the word of god it comes and it
[43:58] challenges our life
[44:00] you know we just don't want to say amen
[44:03] to it because it's the right thing to
[44:04] say and say well yeah i agree with it
[44:06] amen by agreeance i know but we want to
[44:08] say amen so be it in my life
[44:13] let there be a so be it because there's
[44:15] the promise of what we inherit if we
[44:18] will bless ourselves in the god of the
[44:21] amen
[44:22] that is that in the scriptures as it
[44:25] lays there so we want to take him
[44:27] inventory of the word and and this is
[44:29] the way that i believe we should
[44:31] approach it in ephesians 5
[44:33] is just as that's to be a reflection of
[44:35] christ and the bride
[44:37] and then in the earthly uh between
[44:40] believers a husband and wife it should
[44:42] be our prayer
[44:44] even as a husband to say lord let me be
[44:47] the kind of husband that you are to your
[44:49] bride
[44:51] there's no better example
[44:53] this trumps every book
[44:55] from christian bookstore
[44:57] i'm not against books you understand i'm
[44:59] not against books i know some go i'm not
[45:02] but but i am against this right here
[45:04] because everything that's there it ought
[45:06] to come through the filter of god's word
[45:09] because there's a lot of psych that's
[45:12] out there that all it is is psych and
[45:14] let me tell you something there's a lot
[45:16] of good principles but those principles
[45:18] do nothing if there's not the operation
[45:21] of the holy ghost on the inside to bring
[45:24] it to fruition in our life
[45:26] so i believe that paul is he's dealing
[45:29] with this that as a husband and wife not
[45:31] only this reflection is to be but there
[45:34] is victory that within this life there's
[45:37] a testimony that even as the wife can
[45:40] actually go to the lord in prayer and
[45:42] say lord let me be
[45:44] that wife as your wife as the brightest
[45:48] unto you let me be that way o god
[45:52] see we were looking at psalms 23 and i
[45:55] want to just move back into that because
[45:58] those three psalms of psalms 22
[46:01] 23 and 24 when we look at those psalms
[46:06] right there we see that the very the
[46:08] very uh first psalm when we look at it
[46:11] it's it's here it writes of of of the
[46:14] messiah as he's giving his life for the
[46:17] sheep my bones my bones they stare at me
[46:19] you know the scriptures then it's then
[46:21] it goes in the same psalm to the rising
[46:24] i will declare
[46:25] thy name unto the brethren so in order
[46:28] for the rising to come into that place
[46:31] of victory there had to be a giving a
[46:34] dying a yielding first
[46:36] and then when it rises to that place
[46:39] then we come into psalms 23 which is
[46:41] where you and i walk here in a union
[46:45] with the lord jesus christ and this is a
[46:48] psalm of great care because he gave his
[46:52] life he rose again now we share his life
[46:57] we are joint heirs
[47:00] as i write so now being joined heirs
[47:02] then he is there to provide and care for
[47:06] her every need
[47:08] and then when it's all said and done
[47:10] psalms 24
[47:12] open up ye everlasting gates
[47:16] what is it all of this down here now
[47:18] makes way for the position
[47:21] but that position there is reflected in
[47:24] its care it's reflected in the giving
[47:26] and the healing see over there in psalms
[47:28] 24 it's not just a time that oh this is
[47:32] reflected in psalms 24 no that king
[47:35] is reflected through psalms 22 and
[47:38] psalms 23.
[47:41] so i look at this in psalms 23
[47:45] and what a what a psalm you know many
[47:49] times the only time that people read
[47:50] this psalm they think about funerals
[47:53] you know wow this is a funeral song no
[47:55] this is i look at psalms 23 and and i'm
[47:58] just going how god just so inspired it
[48:00] to my heart this is a psalm that deals
[48:03] with marriage
[48:05] this is a psalm that deals with a
[48:07] husband and a wife
[48:09] this is a psalm that deals with a home
[48:11] this is a psalm that deals with the
[48:13] believer and his shepherd
[48:18] oh glory the word holds application in
[48:21] all seasons of our life
[48:24] psalms 23 1. let's just jump right back
[48:27] in there the lord is my shepherd and i i
[48:31] shall not want
[48:33] is satisfied completely
[48:36] there's no question there should be no
[48:38] question in our life whether god loves
[48:40] us or not
[48:42] as a matter of fact god wants to make
[48:44] sure you and i he just doesn't say you
[48:46] know what i told you that a year ago or
[48:48] i told you that last week he desires to
[48:51] make his love known to you and i
[48:55] it's not a love that suffers just being
[48:57] poured out are you hearing me
[48:59] it's reality that his love because why
[49:02] that brings stability in our lives
[49:06] it brings strength in our lives
[49:09] this is why
[49:10] when we look at this the bible you know
[49:12] would say that for those who fear him
[49:16] there's no want
[49:18] in him
[49:19] and i know these are scriptures these
[49:21] you know as husbands and things can look
[49:23] at and say my you know as we said last
[49:26] week these are big shoes to fill but
[49:27] remember i would take this approach just
[49:29] as from my heart to say god
[49:32] let me be this kind of a man
[49:36] i didn't preach this there to men's
[49:37] meaning this is here
[49:40] but let me be this kind of a man
[49:43] let me be this kind that lord that that
[49:45] is a shepherd that's because a shepherd
[49:48] is one who is looking out for
[49:51] looking not only for things present but
[49:53] for things to come
[49:56] and see that's totally contrary with the
[49:58] spirit of this age the spirit of this
[50:00] age is i'll i will stay in my world
[50:04] you're in your world
[50:06] how do we know what's in your world text
[50:07] me find out
[50:10] text me or maybe tweet me or instagram
[50:13] me
[50:14] but you're sitting on the chair and i'm
[50:15] on the sofa well this is our world
[50:19] that's not how that's not how that a
[50:21] home is to operate in two separate
[50:24] worlds is to operate in one union
[50:28] [Music]
[50:32] we're walking here aren't we
[50:35] he maketh me to lie down in green
[50:38] pastures he leadeth me beside the still
[50:42] waters let me just stop here for a
[50:43] moment and say this
[50:46] when the word of god comes across to our
[50:47] path we have got a decision
[50:51] anytime you're open you become
[50:54] vulnerable
[50:55] are you hearing me now anytime you're
[50:58] open you become vulnerable this is why
[51:00] many times people look at the word and
[51:03] they'll run from it
[51:04] now they can sit right here but they run
[51:06] from it they close off and won't allow
[51:08] the word to evaluate their life why
[51:10] because when you become open you become
[51:12] vulnerable
[51:14] and whether we open ourselves or not the
[51:16] bible says in hebrews chapter 4
[51:19] we stand naked
[51:22] before him
[51:24] all things are open before him
[51:27] so what should i do i would just open
[51:29] and say lord you're the one examining me
[51:31] i'm not here to make excuses i'm here i
[51:34] want to align with the word
[51:36] don't make excuses if they're saying the
[51:38] word showing up i will allow myself
[51:41] because when we say being vulnerable
[51:43] you're not in the presence of a
[51:45] condemour we are in the presence of our
[51:49] high priest
[51:51] one who can move for us on our behalf
[51:54] who wants to speak to us in a very
[51:56] personal way
[52:00] i say that's a great quality in this
[52:02] hour to be able to be open
[52:05] that's a great quality
[52:08] that's one of the things if you
[52:10] understand as as him as our husband
[52:12] that's one of the things that brings
[52:13] security in our life because he's so
[52:16] open with us he doesn't hold anything
[52:19] back
[52:20] he shows every little thing in our life
[52:22] he doesn't smooth things over what what
[52:24] is that that's openness it's honesty and
[52:27] it brings confidence
[52:30] because that's what that's what one
[52:31] thing that really it brings strength to
[52:33] us as the bride of jesus christ because
[52:35] we know
[52:36] he says things honest and openly even
[52:39] when it cuts
[52:41] so when he says i love you you're the
[52:43] apple of my eye i have trust in that
[52:46] because i see here he's truthful in all
[52:47] things
[52:49] he's open and honest
[52:51] [Music]
[52:53] he maketh me to lie down in green
[52:56] pastures he leadeth me beside the still
[52:58] waters he's faithful
[53:00] in all his care
[53:02] he takes
[53:03] god
[53:04] think about it brother battle would take
[53:05] a message things that ought to be and
[53:08] speak of that message dealing with how
[53:10] our life has come here under the
[53:13] pre-planning of god the forethought
[53:15] he'll wrap in the scriptures of of john
[53:18] 14 i go away to prepare a place
[53:21] and he begins to do the whole when we
[53:23] look at that he's dealing with it god
[53:26] made that there are certain things that
[53:27] you would like here mountains or planes
[53:29] or whatever it is that that you enjoy
[53:32] that you like god knew you would like
[53:34] those and he seen that all of that
[53:36] topography would be set in a certain way
[53:39] and then brother branham takes us and
[53:40] says if god so pre-planned your birth
[53:43] naturally and even knowing these things
[53:46] that you would like to see that they are
[53:48] set up here in this earth then how much
[53:51] more has he made preparation for you to
[53:54] come back into
[53:57] that mansion that body that theophany
[54:00] that place with him with union god has
[54:03] already made provision he's a god it
[54:06] boils it down to this right here god is
[54:09] one who works in preparation he's
[54:12] mindful and i tell you when i look at
[54:15] that in the scripture right now we this
[54:17] is a challenging thing for us because
[54:19] sometimes we feel like let's just be
[54:21] honest we're just glad that we've made
[54:23] it nine o'clock time for bed
[54:27] let's just be honest there's sometimes
[54:29] with the days and with things that go
[54:30] through in the day we're tired we're
[54:33] weary let me tell you something every
[54:35] demon out of hell has been released
[54:37] revelations chapter nine it is forces
[54:40] that are coming against us not just laws
[54:43] there's demonic spirits that are coming
[54:46] every single day that you're battling
[54:49] you're fighting through you're
[54:51] overcoming you're persevering and your
[54:54] soul don't get weak but your spirit and
[54:57] your body gets weak
[55:00] is that right
[55:02] but god knowing then all of these things
[55:05] he provides he works he works to provide
[55:08] care and that's where i i love that that
[55:11] we can look to the lord and say oh god
[55:14] help me lord to really to see that
[55:16] preparation to see those things lord
[55:20] that that can be done because you see
[55:22] when we look at a shepherd and sheep i
[55:25] want you to recall in ii samuel 12 3
[55:28] this is nathan standing before david
[55:31] after david took bathsheba uriah's wife
[55:35] and once you just the the thing that i
[55:37] want you to focus on is not what i just
[55:39] mentioned i want you to focus on how god
[55:42] likens bathsheba in this quote
[55:46] the wife
[55:47] he said the poor man had nothing save
[55:50] one little you lamb
[55:55] but this was his this was his wife but
[55:58] notice not just a grown you one little
[56:02] you lamb
[56:04] so still the treatment with great
[56:06] delicacy
[56:10] oh my which he had brought and nourished
[56:12] up notice he brought and nourished them
[56:14] and he grew up together with him and
[56:16] with his children it did eat of his own
[56:18] meat and drank of his own cup and lay in
[56:20] his bosom and was unto him
[56:23] as a daughter
[56:25] that's a term of endearment in the
[56:26] scripture
[56:29] for a husband to refer it's a term of
[56:30] endear so so how god has referred this
[56:34] in this leadership now coming back to
[56:36] the scripture where we we we stopped
[56:39] last week in psalms 23 3 he restoreth my
[56:43] soul
[56:45] and truly
[56:46] we can say there's only one
[56:48] that could restore our soul
[56:51] to the right position
[56:53] and that's our shepherd
[56:55] he came to lead us to that place and it
[56:59] wasn't something out here
[57:01] it was actually a yielding to where the
[57:04] blood would reach the innermost part of
[57:06] our life
[57:08] to where now his presence now it's it's
[57:11] it's agape love that has worked on us
[57:13] the love of god but the love of god
[57:16] works even on our filial love to where
[57:19] we love god we begin to respond to the
[57:22] things of the lord but if that is all
[57:25] under the influence of agape love until
[57:27] agape love the holy ghost
[57:30] sets down on the holiest of holies
[57:34] so it's under see the baptism of the
[57:37] holy ghost is the love of god the seal
[57:40] of god upon our soul and how is it all
[57:42] working it's not our love doing it we
[57:45] love him because he first loved us it's
[57:47] his love the spirit of god brooding over
[57:50] us bringing us to this place of complete
[57:52] surrender
[57:54] because the holy ghost does not come
[57:56] without complete surrender
[57:59] you see that's why in reality the
[58:00] baptism of the holy ghost is very simple
[58:02] to receive
[58:04] it's very simple
[58:05] repent
[58:06] that's full surrender
[58:08] this will surrender full dying out
[58:11] him comes
[58:12] he'll come when it's according to his
[58:14] word he'll always come every when the
[58:16] pattern of the word is followed he comes
[58:19] he came in moses temple came in
[58:21] solomon's temple it's very simple repent
[58:23] repent means die you abort that old life
[58:28] see that's why the tears can be shed but
[58:31] yet god's not looking at our tears
[58:33] because if god was looking at the tears
[58:35] many people would have received it god's
[58:37] not looking at the tears he's looking at
[58:40] the heart
[58:41] because that's the place that faith must
[58:44] move in order for him to receive himself
[58:48] inside
[58:50] it's all his work because that inside is
[58:53] the real temple
[58:54] of almighty god
[58:56] he restored my soul
[58:59] and yet as we're looking that there are
[59:01] times that we see in our life we go
[59:03] through it as an assembly
[59:05] we go through it in marriage
[59:07] we go through an individual walk there's
[59:09] times we we'd love to stay on the
[59:11] mountain all the time
[59:13] we would love to but there's times we
[59:15] get weary
[59:16] and it's not weary oh we're being sinful
[59:19] the bible says be you not weary in
[59:22] well-doing
[59:25] i'm gonna ask you to raise your hand but
[59:26] sometimes there's been things that you
[59:28] feel like i you know what i really feel
[59:31] like i'm doing the right thing but it
[59:33] seems like everything else is going the
[59:35] opposite way what should i do be not
[59:37] weary
[59:38] in well-doing what does that mean it
[59:40] means keep doing what is the right thing
[59:44] to do don't ever give up on the word
[59:47] because the word can't fail
[59:49] [Applause]
[59:51] amen
[59:53] he restoreth my soul notice let me just
[59:55] make you i take a few scriptures here
[59:58] uh of how that when we look at even in
[1:00:01] our home and our marriages and even in
[1:00:03] our life when we even come to the house
[1:00:05] of god when we're around one another as
[1:00:07] brothers and sisters this should be our
[1:00:10] testimony
[1:00:11] and when i say that
[1:00:14] when i read it don't don't all of a
[1:00:16] sudden shrink down in your seat but we
[1:00:18] want to read it and then let's look into
[1:00:20] the avenue that god has provided that
[1:00:22] this can be in our life
[1:00:25] philemon chapter well there's only one
[1:00:27] chapter this is the personal letter
[1:00:29] that's wrote on behalf of onesimus back
[1:00:32] to philemon remember niecemas is the one
[1:00:34] who ran away
[1:00:36] paul and he runs and paul sees him and
[1:00:38] he now becomes
[1:00:40] a son of the gospel he becomes fully
[1:00:42] converted he becomes uh one that paul
[1:00:44] could have such such confidence in and
[1:00:47] now onesimus runs back with a message in
[1:00:49] his hand that in a quote he's now it
[1:00:50] says this is me i've been pardoned
[1:00:53] so philemon now notice notice the
[1:00:55] greeting concerning philemon for we have
[1:00:57] great joy and consolation and thy love
[1:00:59] because the bowels the the innermost
[1:01:02] parts of the saints are refreshed
[1:01:06] by the brother
[1:01:09] it's nice to get around refreshing
[1:01:11] people isn't it
[1:01:16] that's wonderful
[1:01:19] second corinthians 7 13 and these are
[1:01:21] just a few places here but with with the
[1:01:24] definition that i want to look at
[1:01:25] therefore we were comforted in your
[1:01:28] comfort yea and exceedingly the more
[1:01:30] joyed we were for the joy of titus now
[1:01:32] paul's in the midst of a test and trial
[1:01:34] here right now
[1:01:36] and he's saying this is where we were we
[1:01:37] were joined because his spirit
[1:01:40] tituses his spirit was refreshed by
[1:01:45] you all
[1:01:48] our spirit needs refreshment
[1:01:52] the real place of refreshing is behind
[1:01:54] the inner veil but that refreshing has a
[1:01:58] conduit and a channel to affect others
[1:02:02] is that right brother bram says you've
[1:02:04] been around sometimes good people and
[1:02:05] you're
[1:02:06] you're around them and they're good
[1:02:07] people
[1:02:08] after you're there's an atmosphere
[1:02:10] that's about them that's just
[1:02:11] maybe they're good people but they're
[1:02:12] very condescending not something that
[1:02:15] maybe say but you just catch it in their
[1:02:16] spirit man
[1:02:18] are you hearing me it's an atmosphere
[1:02:19] brother ben tells us that you create an
[1:02:21] atmosphere by the things you think on
[1:02:24] right
[1:02:25] so then in order to be refreshed when we
[1:02:28] look at this
[1:02:29] it's to
[1:02:30] um the the the scripture says to or the
[1:02:33] definition says to cause or permit one
[1:02:35] to cease from any movement or labor in
[1:02:37] order to recover and collect his
[1:02:39] strength to give rest refresh to give
[1:02:42] oneself rest to take rest to keep quiet
[1:02:45] of calm and patient expectation
[1:02:47] [Music]
[1:02:50] lord i need a refreshing
[1:02:52] [Music]
[1:02:53] at some time we just have to be honest
[1:02:55] you know what i need a refreshing.
[1:02:58] you know there's times that they and
[1:03:00] listen these are things that we we
[1:03:02] should be asking for lord i need a
[1:03:04] refilling of the holy ghost
[1:03:06] it's one filling with many refillings
[1:03:10] by the same i just asked him for a
[1:03:12] refilling yesterday asking for another
[1:03:14] one today
[1:03:17] it's a daily walk
[1:03:19] brother says this in another place in
[1:03:21] the message he says when you begin to
[1:03:22] feel like the buckle and the armor is
[1:03:25] kind of slacking down he said take the
[1:03:28] buckle and
[1:03:29] tighten it up and ask god for a
[1:03:32] refilling of the holy ghost
[1:03:35] it's a refreshing in his presence that's
[1:03:38] what caused
[1:03:40] aaron's rod to move from a dead rod to
[1:03:43] one that butted blossomed and produced
[1:03:46] almonds it was the place of refreshing
[1:03:49] so this is where brother adam will say
[1:03:50] in the messi's divine love
[1:03:53] what type of people aren't we to be if
[1:03:54] we're a christian
[1:03:57] what type of atmosphere should we live
[1:03:59] in now i want you i'm just i'm speaking
[1:04:01] this very plainly
[1:04:02] the gospel does not give
[1:04:05] any um
[1:04:07] superscript letter
[1:04:10] that states
[1:04:11] this can only be
[1:04:13] if so-and-so's living in victory
[1:04:16] nobody else's life should be a
[1:04:18] determination on whether you walk in
[1:04:21] victory
[1:04:24] this is the hour as the bible says in
[1:04:26] the book of isaiah i understand
[1:04:27] sometimes there's things that's very
[1:04:28] close to you you feel the breath they're
[1:04:31] right beside you or one ever more it's
[1:04:33] very close but this is the hour as it
[1:04:35] says see she from man whose breath is in
[1:04:38] his nostrils
[1:04:39] it's one recognizing this that there is
[1:04:42] a mighty god that is present to
[1:04:44] influence and direct our lives
[1:04:48] understand these are things that what a
[1:04:49] privilege we have sometimes you know the
[1:04:52] devil is mastery at trying to make us
[1:04:55] feel hopeless
[1:04:57] you come into a situation or something
[1:04:59] you're wanting to change and he then
[1:05:01] brings it in sense to where it's now you
[1:05:05] looking at it through your finite eyes
[1:05:07] and how this can be i'm telling you
[1:05:10] that's impossible through our finite
[1:05:12] eyes but when we can look through the
[1:05:14] eyes of god get in the atmosphere of the
[1:05:17] holy spirit brother it opens up the
[1:05:20] impossibilities
[1:05:22] to where it becomes possible to us as
[1:05:25] believers
[1:05:27] [Music]
[1:05:32] brother man so what type of people are
[1:05:34] we to be if we're a christian what type
[1:05:36] of an atmosphere should we
[1:05:38] live in
[1:05:40] look what he says
[1:05:41] this is the kind of atmosphere we should
[1:05:43] live in in a consoling
[1:05:46] soothing
[1:05:47] healing
[1:05:48] atmosphere
[1:05:50] we should live in notice live in
[1:05:54] with our heart see this is why the enemy
[1:05:56] battles at you satan remember he's
[1:05:58] intentional
[1:05:59] this is why here you are getting ready
[1:06:01] to get off work and then somebody has to
[1:06:04] say something
[1:06:06] this rumor has to come about
[1:06:09] because you were thinking man when i get
[1:06:10] out of here whoo i'm gonna have a nice
[1:06:13] refreshing
[1:06:15] bath in the car cleansing of all the
[1:06:17] critical spirits and everything else has
[1:06:19] been around and here i am to walk in my
[1:06:21] priestly garments and my i'm just going
[1:06:23] to have a man it's going to be a
[1:06:25] wonderful evening and all the and satan
[1:06:27] knows just how to put that board in the
[1:06:30] spoke of your bicycle
[1:06:35] so we're not ignorant of that but at the
[1:06:37] same time
[1:06:38] knowing knowing you know there's things
[1:06:40] that you begin to learn hey you know
[1:06:42] what you begin to learn things like
[1:06:44] sunday morning like oh well i'm always
[1:06:46] late for church oh why am i is this for
[1:06:48] church oh i'm at this for church you
[1:06:50] know what
[1:06:51] these are times where we have to really
[1:06:53] be at sons and daughters of god
[1:06:56] oh my i don't know what the ground we're
[1:06:58] gonna walk on right now it's just coming
[1:07:00] fresh and we're just going to take it
[1:07:02] it's all organic and it's packed with
[1:07:04] vitamins and minerals
[1:07:07] sometimes we look at things like that
[1:07:09] instead of just looking and saying now
[1:07:11] wait a minute what can be done so we're
[1:07:13] not in this predicament
[1:07:16] come on now i mean if you're in a
[1:07:18] predicament when it comes dinner time
[1:07:20] you start saying wait a minute here what
[1:07:22] can we do i know we do honey we'll put
[1:07:24] on a slow cooker meal on tuesdays that
[1:07:26] may we got dinner when it's time for
[1:07:28] dinner what are you doing you're taking
[1:07:30] away a preparation that should be the
[1:07:32] same thing not just come into the house
[1:07:35] of god you ought to look at what can i
[1:07:37] do it's the same thing when it comes to
[1:07:39] things that you know where the enemy
[1:07:41] wants to trip you up or whatever more
[1:07:43] you can look at that guy coming across
[1:07:45] the plant and say adios buddy i see you
[1:07:47] tomorrow because you know when that guy
[1:07:50] comes you know he's packing something
[1:07:53] you understand
[1:07:55] i mean i've told you this many times
[1:07:56] there when when i was there in teaching
[1:07:59] i kept a folder on my desk that had
[1:08:01] papers in it what were they nothing
[1:08:04] nothing
[1:08:06] those you work in office and teaching
[1:08:07] look you know you got you got people
[1:08:09] that come at the end of their time what
[1:08:10] do they do they come and what they want
[1:08:12] to do is run down the boss run down this
[1:08:14] why do we have to do this why do we they
[1:08:16] didn't get nothing done
[1:08:17] so i kept that stack of things i could
[1:08:19] hear some of them coming down the hall i
[1:08:21] took that stat that folder had nothing
[1:08:23] and no papers of importance and i just
[1:08:25] walked out of my my man what are you
[1:08:27] gonna do i'm heading to the copy room
[1:08:29] brother samuel that's acting but it got
[1:08:31] me out of that stuff
[1:08:34] come on now we know people the bible's
[1:08:35] looking look at this let's apply this
[1:08:37] also in all things the bible said know
[1:08:39] them that labor among you we should know
[1:08:41] those things even among our workplace
[1:08:43] you know here comes the gossiper here
[1:08:45] comes a critic
[1:08:50] no i don't know we're just going
[1:08:53] what time you see this is victory of
[1:08:54] what kind of atmosphere we should live
[1:08:56] in this is where we as sons and
[1:08:58] daughters of god are reigning over
[1:09:00] situations
[1:09:01] reigning in maturity remember brother
[1:09:03] graham says overcoming is recognizing
[1:09:05] the devil at every one of his tricks
[1:09:09] what type of atmosphere we should live
[1:09:11] in in a soothing consoling soothing
[1:09:14] healing atmosphere we should live in
[1:09:16] with our hearts constantly in
[1:09:18] prayer how do i say constantly in prayer
[1:09:21] paul said pray without ceasing
[1:09:23] how do i pray without ceasing because
[1:09:25] prayer is not a is not the position of
[1:09:28] your body
[1:09:30] it's the frustration of your heart
[1:09:33] you can be praying right there in the
[1:09:34] car i'm not saying that we don't we all
[1:09:36] know we need our times alone with god
[1:09:38] but i'm just going to say it like this
[1:09:40] don't limit it to where oh i've got to
[1:09:42] be in my prayer closet here or this
[1:09:44] bedroom or i've got to be right here
[1:09:45] pray pray without ceasing
[1:09:49] when there's things that comes to you
[1:09:50] offer up to god in prayer just ask god
[1:09:53] lord guide me today watch over me today
[1:09:56] you say what are you doing as a son of
[1:09:57] god you're inviting the atmosphere of
[1:10:00] the holy spirit down to say lord i want
[1:10:03] to live in that healing consoling
[1:10:05] atmosphere i want that to radiate from
[1:10:07] my life so i'm inviting you who is the
[1:10:10] influence of my life lord let it be the
[1:10:13] atmosphere here
[1:10:15] it's raining the sons and daughters of
[1:10:17] god it's not letting the devil turn
[1:10:19] around and beat you back this way well
[1:10:21] you're not living up to that you're not
[1:10:22] it's taking the channel to the word and
[1:10:24] say this is my god-given right as a son
[1:10:28] and daughter of god and devil you are
[1:10:30] exposed
[1:10:36] psalms 23 3 let me read the next part
[1:10:38] here
[1:10:39] [Music]
[1:10:42] he leadeth me
[1:10:44] in the paths of righteousness
[1:10:48] for his namesake
[1:10:49] so the paths
[1:10:51] that he chooses
[1:10:53] the path he's leading me
[1:10:57] and these are paths
[1:10:58] of righteousness for his namesake no
[1:11:02] this is it says this is complete
[1:11:05] responsibility
[1:11:07] this is complete ownership
[1:11:11] you see when the fall took place in in
[1:11:13] eden
[1:11:15] as soon as sin came in
[1:11:18] soon as sin came in
[1:11:21] it began to pass the buck
[1:11:26] she gave to me so he wasn't protected
[1:11:29] lord you know the one that you had me
[1:11:31] call and
[1:11:32] go over you know and speak to her youth
[1:11:34] can't this this one
[1:11:35] [Music]
[1:11:38] don't you lord the woman thou gave us me
[1:11:44] he trusts he tried to do put it back on
[1:11:46] god
[1:11:49] come on listen let's just be honest it's
[1:11:51] within our nature to deflect
[1:11:54] i'm not talking about our our our
[1:11:57] our new birth i'm talking about in that
[1:11:59] old nature that first nature that sticky
[1:12:03] part that we still have it's in our
[1:12:05] nature to deflect
[1:12:07] [Music]
[1:12:09] i mean it's so much in this age right
[1:12:11] now that the person robbing the store
[1:12:12] they blame the police for being there
[1:12:14] and they did it
[1:12:16] if you hadn't been here i wouldn't got
[1:12:17] caught
[1:12:18] if you didn't have these cameras
[1:12:21] [Music]
[1:12:23] proverbs 13 3 you see because the
[1:12:25] leadership
[1:12:27] that even as
[1:12:28] as a
[1:12:29] as brethren and even
[1:12:31] the pastor on and on and on and on that
[1:12:33] we have to seek for is for the wisdom of
[1:12:36] almighty god
[1:12:38] and this is why
[1:12:40] look how that it would speak of how that
[1:12:41] wisdom and i want you to catch this
[1:12:43] remember how solomon would write by
[1:12:45] inspiration concerning wisdom he never
[1:12:47] writes of wisdom as being the masculine
[1:12:50] he writes it as the feminine
[1:12:52] because it comes
[1:12:54] you see revelation is not something
[1:12:55] that's forced
[1:12:58] a man is not even to be for it's it's
[1:13:00] something that's to be very
[1:13:02] open
[1:13:03] and delicate and received
[1:13:04] [Music]
[1:13:06] are you with me brother brown takes out
[1:13:07] i think it's question answers 54 he
[1:13:09] speaks about how he says people are
[1:13:11] studying and studying and studying you
[1:13:12] know in the book ecclesiastes does much
[1:13:14] study worries
[1:13:16] and brother brahman says you forget back
[1:13:18] he said a lot of that studying and he
[1:13:19] talks about where it takes people and
[1:13:21] then brother rhymes and talmud don't
[1:13:22] study but what he's dealing with is
[1:13:24] people as a person just study study
[1:13:26] study and he says you're forgetting
[1:13:29] to yield to him in love
[1:13:32] and that's what it is
[1:13:34] it's yielding to him
[1:13:36] in love
[1:13:38] so these ways the paths of righteousness
[1:13:41] here's what these paths of righteousness
[1:13:42] are proverbs 13 3 13 and then i'm going
[1:13:45] to go to verse 17. happy is the man that
[1:13:47] findeth wisdom
[1:13:48] and the man that gideth understanding
[1:13:51] verse 17. her ways
[1:13:54] this is wisdom her ways
[1:13:56] are ways
[1:13:58] of pleasantness and all her paths are
[1:14:01] peace
[1:14:06] so the paths of righteousness are ways
[1:14:08] of pleasantness
[1:14:10] and paths of peace
[1:14:14] i want you to just to catch this here
[1:14:15] just to really be very
[1:14:18] mindful of this part
[1:14:20] it's very very very important
[1:14:22] reflecting the right leadership
[1:14:25] in our homes
[1:14:27] regarding each situation
[1:14:30] is very very important
[1:14:32] because the wife
[1:14:33] she's the moon
[1:14:36] and
[1:14:37] she's going to reflect the light
[1:14:41] when the sun is absent
[1:14:43] i never forget this before i was married
[1:14:45] i never forget i was listening to
[1:14:46] um
[1:14:48] i was in a camp meeting brother harold
[1:14:49] hildebrand was ministering back in 95.
[1:14:52] and uh he he was and he talked about how
[1:14:56] he was referring to this right here and
[1:14:57] how the wife is like the moon and he was
[1:14:59] talking about a situation you know that
[1:15:01] uh you know that had taken place and
[1:15:03] some things maybe that have been said
[1:15:04] about him or this or that and the wife
[1:15:06] knew about it maybe this brother was
[1:15:07] contentious or whatever more so the wife
[1:15:09] knew about it
[1:15:11] well then some years later then you know
[1:15:13] this brother had come everything was
[1:15:15] able to be smoothed out man i mean they
[1:15:17] were just
[1:15:19] but
[1:15:20] he said one thing he said that when i my
[1:15:21] wife my wife saw this brother what she
[1:15:23] remembered is that
[1:15:25] that contention in what had been in the
[1:15:27] past she wasn't aware of those things
[1:15:29] the restitution that had been made
[1:15:32] so she was still reflecting what light
[1:15:34] had been emitted
[1:15:36] previously you see this is why it is
[1:15:39] very
[1:15:40] it's very very important this is why i
[1:15:44] just i'm just going to follow him this
[1:15:45] is why
[1:15:47] even when the bible says let not the
[1:15:49] left know what the right is doing or the
[1:15:50] right not the left you know what i'm
[1:15:52] saying don't you we we don't go about
[1:15:54] and do that
[1:15:55] this is why even in a family in a home
[1:15:58] you know
[1:16:00] it's not to take things and entrust it
[1:16:02] to somebody else for example nobody
[1:16:05] should know the weaknesses of your
[1:16:07] husband but you
[1:16:10] nobody should know the weaknesses of
[1:16:12] your wife
[1:16:14] but you
[1:16:17] sometimes and listen i'm speaking now to
[1:16:20] even of the flesh that exists because
[1:16:22] sometimes the flesh can't handle that
[1:16:24] the flesh will remember that
[1:16:26] come on blood's thicker than water i've
[1:16:28] seen it
[1:16:30] i mean not any phrase i've seen it
[1:16:32] i've seen it you see the the thing that
[1:16:35] then you say well brother simon what are
[1:16:36] you saying within that i'm saying that
[1:16:38] just the bible says love coverth a
[1:16:40] multitude of sin
[1:16:42] the love is to be that to where not only
[1:16:44] it covers but it puts the best light
[1:16:47] forward
[1:16:58] this is why there's things that if some
[1:16:59] that if a person or family leaves the
[1:17:01] church i'm not going into anything with
[1:17:03] anybody
[1:17:05] you say why would you do that because if
[1:17:07] they would ever to come back to visit or
[1:17:09] come back here i don't want that on the
[1:17:11] minds of the people
[1:17:13] well i know so and so does it that's up
[1:17:15] to them every church is sovereign but
[1:17:17] for me there's some things it's nobody's
[1:17:19] business
[1:17:22] because why i don't want anything
[1:17:24] troubled
[1:17:25] i don't want you i don't want to tutor
[1:17:26] your perception to change concerning any
[1:17:29] brother or any sister oh brother samuel
[1:17:32] i have the love of god
[1:17:34] and then nobody's questioning that we're
[1:17:36] not going to question that but there's
[1:17:37] things that we have to operate in wisdom
[1:17:42] right
[1:17:43] so you see this is why this reflection
[1:17:46] of light it should be like the prophets
[1:17:49] of old remember what god how the prophet
[1:17:52] identified the prophets he called them
[1:17:54] reflectors of god's light
[1:17:58] and the seven stars are in his right
[1:18:01] hand power and authority
[1:18:03] headship hold what does it do it emits
[1:18:07] light
[1:18:08] to scatter darkness
[1:18:10] so then the entrustment is is that that
[1:18:13] our lives reflecting the right
[1:18:15] leadership that tends to righteousness
[1:18:19] not bitterness
[1:18:20] grudges
[1:18:22] discord
[1:18:23] but promotes unity
[1:18:30] the bible says for a man i i could go on
[1:18:32] that point for a while but i'm not going
[1:18:34] to
[1:18:35] in first corinthians 11 7 for a man
[1:18:37] indeed ought not to cover his head for
[1:18:39] as much as he is the image and glory of
[1:18:42] god but the woman is the glory of the
[1:18:43] man see the sun and moon relationship
[1:18:46] first corinthians 11 1
[1:18:48] we were talking about he leadeth me
[1:18:51] paul could write be your followers of me
[1:18:54] even as
[1:18:55] i also am of christ so paul was saying
[1:18:58] you follow me to the degree that i'm
[1:19:01] following christ
[1:19:03] so it's not just following me
[1:19:06] but it's the following as i follow
[1:19:07] christ
[1:19:08] that's the real confidence that's the
[1:19:10] stability this is the path of
[1:19:13] righteousness
[1:19:14] because you see there's a lot of things
[1:19:16] in paths of righteousness that we can
[1:19:18] look at that a lot of things can come up
[1:19:20] with even in a home let me say this like
[1:19:22] this you know
[1:19:23] it's not hard to lead when everything is
[1:19:26] you know hitting on the right cylinders
[1:19:30] but now becomes a challenge when
[1:19:32] adversity strikes the home
[1:19:36] maybe a son or daughter or something's
[1:19:38] not going right on the job
[1:19:41] or a teacher or a professor or or
[1:19:44] something else now it becomes a crucial
[1:19:46] that you lead in adversity and
[1:19:48] leadership in adversity is not taking
[1:19:51] the side of
[1:19:54] leadership is lead through
[1:19:58] god does it we'll see as we go on god
[1:20:00] doesn't remove us from tests from trials
[1:20:02] from adversity he leads us through
[1:20:05] brother brahma says oh god give me grace
[1:20:08] to go through it
[1:20:09] you say why because it's crucial now
[1:20:13] because later on in life it's not just
[1:20:15] now it's later on in life that if it's
[1:20:17] not led in the right way if the wife is
[1:20:19] not lit in the right way then maybe
[1:20:21] there's words that are said things that
[1:20:23] come in to the home maybe a sister or
[1:20:25] there's a disagreement or whatever it's
[1:20:27] crucial leadership is needed at that
[1:20:30] moment at that time to guide even the
[1:20:32] thoughts to guide it in a place of
[1:20:34] restitution to guide it in a place of
[1:20:37] giving a place and understanding to work
[1:20:40] with that why because you're inviting
[1:20:42] peace
[1:20:46] is that all right
[1:20:49] so this is where in our lives we are all
[1:20:53] oh boy brother branham like he puts it
[1:20:57] there in the latter part of 65 we come
[1:20:59] here with a human grab bag
[1:21:01] we get all that i mean we you know it's
[1:21:02] like
[1:21:05] we're pound full in our first birth of
[1:21:07] junk
[1:21:09] i know everyone has got pride about our
[1:21:11] last name order more but you know what
[1:21:12] your your last name like my last frame
[1:21:14] is full of rottnest and junk and we're
[1:21:16] all made out of the same calcium potash
[1:21:18] petroleum it's not putting anybody down
[1:21:20] it's recognizing that our inadequacies
[1:21:22] that oh we're not superior we we do
[1:21:25] things this way good somebody else does
[1:21:27] things another way god has all varieties
[1:21:29] in his kingdom and they're all needed
[1:21:32] right
[1:21:34] so
[1:21:34] you see
[1:21:35] these are things that we have to
[1:21:37] evaluate in our life this is part of the
[1:21:39] word dealing in our life
[1:21:42] that even as husbands and in our home as
[1:21:45] leaders as pastor
[1:21:47] any place of leadership we don't want
[1:21:51] complexes sown
[1:21:54] so we need the discernment of the holy
[1:21:57] spirit that there listen nobody walks
[1:21:59] around and says you know what i got a
[1:22:01] complex
[1:22:01] [Music]
[1:22:03] no
[1:22:04] think how the prophet felt when that was
[1:22:06] made known to him what it was he didn't
[1:22:08] know what it was at first
[1:22:10] are you hearing me he preached the seals
[1:22:12] with that complex
[1:22:14] come on now
[1:22:16] he preached the seals then he takes
[1:22:17] messages like humble thyself not a
[1:22:20] doctrinal message it's instruction
[1:22:24] standing in the gap instruction
[1:22:28] standing in the gap it's a life that's
[1:22:30] lived when something is dead wrong but
[1:22:32] you hold to that what's right and you be
[1:22:34] the breach that fills the gap
[1:22:38] he's standing in that message and how he
[1:22:40] says he feels in that message go back
[1:22:42] and listen to the first part of it how
[1:22:43] he feels he said i'm in the place right
[1:22:45] now that's something going downstream he
[1:22:46] said i could stand and laugh at it
[1:22:49] told you so
[1:22:51] i'm not making you understand this
[1:22:53] but see you one thing about you find one
[1:22:55] this is one thing i love there's many
[1:22:56] things i love but and one thing with the
[1:22:58] message brother branham reflects
[1:23:00] i take that example he reflects in his
[1:23:03] life
[1:23:04] he didn't everything that man everything
[1:23:06] i do is like glaze you know on krispy
[1:23:08] kreme donuts and it's smooth and it's
[1:23:10] tasty and it's i tell you this and that
[1:23:12] sure god spoke to him a lot but he
[1:23:14] reflected in his life that's why i can
[1:23:17] follow a man like that
[1:23:19] because he was dead honest
[1:23:23] he didn't put the blame on everybody
[1:23:25] else he took responsibility
[1:23:28] when he stood there and he saw the
[1:23:30] preview of the bride listen to the words
[1:23:33] when he saw that church of america he
[1:23:35] said i was ashamed and i said to god is
[1:23:38] that the best we can do
[1:23:42] he never said these sorry preachers out
[1:23:43] here and this and that he was a man of
[1:23:46] reflection why god this was a man a son
[1:23:49] coming to maturity a wave sheet to show
[1:23:52] that real sons and daughters of god will
[1:23:55] reflect they'll take the counsel the
[1:23:57] word because they want to align with the
[1:23:59] word more than anything else
[1:24:04] [Music]
[1:24:07] not through complexes we don't want to
[1:24:09] sow complexes in because you find one
[1:24:11] complex can be passed to another
[1:24:12] generation
[1:24:15] [Music]
[1:24:16] my friend let's not look outside we can
[1:24:18] do that i'm talking about inwardly
[1:24:21] i'm talking about when what did you say
[1:24:23] what a second what i do well it isn't
[1:24:24] something you go around and say god show
[1:24:26] me my complex god show me all my no what
[1:24:28] it is when the word is dealing with our
[1:24:30] life
[1:24:33] it's dealing with our life
[1:24:35] if there's complexes that's had that
[1:24:37] it's always you know everybody's out to
[1:24:39] get me everybody's like that's a complex
[1:24:42] you need god to resolve that
[1:24:45] god's not out to get you oh my brother's
[1:24:47] out to get me my brother's saying this
[1:24:49] my sister oh yes i do i know it i know
[1:24:51] it i know it no that's a complex
[1:24:54] and a complex is operated by a spirit
[1:24:57] and it's not the holy spirit
[1:24:59] and remember that spirits itself sown
[1:25:03] are the germ within seeds
[1:25:07] that's why we have to be careful what we
[1:25:09] sow
[1:25:10] for what god's not mocked whatsoever a
[1:25:13] man soweth
[1:25:14] judge shall he also reap
[1:25:17] is that right
[1:25:18] this is why my goodness
[1:25:22] i said my goodness because i'm looking
[1:25:24] i'm looking at time
[1:25:27] proverbs 11 18 this is why when the
[1:25:29] bible says the wicked worketh at the
[1:25:30] deceitful work but to him that soweth
[1:25:32] righteousness
[1:25:34] shall be a sure
[1:25:36] reward
[1:25:39] you see
[1:25:40] paul would write about you know
[1:25:42] even the things that we're to think on
[1:25:44] thinking about atmosphere
[1:25:46] he would write about that in philippians
[1:25:48] 4 8 then going to philippians 4 9 notice
[1:25:50] what paul how paul would speak
[1:25:52] concerning leadership here
[1:25:54] those things
[1:25:56] which you have both learned
[1:25:58] and received
[1:26:00] and heard and seen
[1:26:03] in me
[1:26:04] do
[1:26:06] so paul would say paul could say like
[1:26:08] this he said paul's saying i'm not
[1:26:11] saying do as i say i'm asking you to do
[1:26:13] as i do
[1:26:14] come follow me
[1:26:17] see that's it's an invitation come
[1:26:19] follow me be followers of me as i also
[1:26:22] am of christ
[1:26:25] and the god of peace shall be with you
[1:26:26] all so this this part here let me let me
[1:26:29] my my my my let me try to to to to wrap
[1:26:33] this this this part up right here
[1:26:36] [Music]
[1:26:38] this is very imperative in leadership
[1:26:41] and what i'm going to just deal with
[1:26:42] here just a few moments
[1:26:45] in what we're looking at the paths of
[1:26:46] righteousness he leadeth me
[1:26:49] because his leading
[1:26:52] is very gentle
[1:26:54] it's not forceful
[1:26:57] it's not a demand
[1:26:59] but his leadership
[1:27:01] is is an invitation to you and i
[1:27:04] it's what's a provision for you and i
[1:27:06] i'm not this isn't painting got up to be
[1:27:09] you know powdered sugar and maple syrup
[1:27:11] and that's not what i'm saying because
[1:27:12] we realize he corrects us he lets us
[1:27:14] know if if something's wrong
[1:27:17] because we're a reflection of him
[1:27:20] and he can say that's not my attitude
[1:27:21] concerning that you're the moon i'm the
[1:27:23] sun and the sun's an attitude is not
[1:27:25] that attitude so we need to get this
[1:27:26] right here you need to reflect the right
[1:27:28] light so he's quick to to
[1:27:31] to help us on that
[1:27:34] and one of the greatest ways like as
[1:27:35] paul would write husbands love your
[1:27:37] wives even as christ who loved the
[1:27:38] church and gave himself for it
[1:27:40] even as
[1:27:41] so it's very imperative in leadership
[1:27:44] true leadership is responsible
[1:27:47] for creating an atmosphere
[1:27:50] of confidence
[1:27:51] trust and faith
[1:27:55] i want you to notice of how
[1:27:58] uh in in isaiah 62 and you just just
[1:28:02] give me just a few moments here
[1:28:04] in isaiah 62 verse 4 this is god
[1:28:07] bringing israel back home
[1:28:09] 144 000 but it also speaks spiritually
[1:28:13] of the bride too
[1:28:15] because there's a land that we were out
[1:28:17] of
[1:28:17] and god brought us back into the land of
[1:28:20] the holy ghost he's brought us back into
[1:28:22] this place thou shalt no more be turned
[1:28:25] forsaken neither shall thy land any more
[1:28:28] be termed desolate
[1:28:30] but thou shalt be called hepsidha and
[1:28:32] thy land beulah which means married for
[1:28:35] the lord delighteth in thee in thy land
[1:28:38] shall be married so the land was laying
[1:28:42] there but now when the right
[1:28:45] people get back into the right place
[1:28:48] then there's an expression of the union
[1:28:51] of the glory
[1:28:53] that belongs
[1:28:54] to the people of god
[1:28:56] just like in our lives when we get into
[1:28:58] the right place get in christ then
[1:29:00] thy land shall be called married it
[1:29:02] begins to the word itself is now living
[1:29:06] in flesh
[1:29:09] for as a young man marrieth a virgin so
[1:29:11] shall thy sons marry thee so that that
[1:29:14] that word that land that's coming into
[1:29:16] view
[1:29:18] thy sons shall unite with it
[1:29:21] as the bridegroom rejoiceth and this is
[1:29:23] what i want you to take in the bride as
[1:29:25] the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride
[1:29:27] so shall thy god rejoice over thee
[1:29:34] you think god delights in you
[1:29:38] well you better believe it
[1:29:40] he said you're the apple of my eye
[1:29:42] oh he's he's known he's watched over us
[1:29:45] clear back from the mind of god
[1:29:48] we were in his loins all coming all the
[1:29:51] way down
[1:29:53] he made sure
[1:29:55] this one
[1:29:57] would come together with this one
[1:30:00] it might look like this is not going to
[1:30:01] happen but god said there's got to be
[1:30:02] this king of the bell
[1:30:04] got to be that certain ting of the bell
[1:30:07] ting because remember you you didn't
[1:30:09] your parents or you did not give
[1:30:10] yourself the seed
[1:30:12] but remember even when we look at our
[1:30:14] temperaments and our makeups and all
[1:30:15] those things like that god had such an
[1:30:16] arrangement god oh my he's over it all
[1:30:20] he's watching over it all
[1:30:22] my goodness and we have a few things to
[1:30:24] make out for the insurance company in
[1:30:25] our hair well those i have there it's
[1:30:27] all frazzled
[1:30:29] god's got all this
[1:30:32] notice problem you see this is part of
[1:30:34] leadership
[1:30:36] proverbs 5 18 let thy fountain be
[1:30:40] blessed
[1:30:41] and rejoice with the wife of thy youth
[1:30:46] let her be as the loving hind and

[1:30:53] thee and all times and be thou ravished
[1:30:56] always
[1:30:57] with her love
[1:31:00] notice with her love remember brother
[1:31:03] brown talks about the older couple
[1:31:05] and he's doing i think a renewal
[1:31:08] and
[1:31:08] he told brother brown he says she's just
[1:31:10] as beautiful as ever
[1:31:12] and she said he's just as handsome as
[1:31:14] ever and of course the older brother
[1:31:15] brother brahm tells it on tape he said
[1:31:17] the older brother says you know he said
[1:31:19] of course my eyes are not as good as
[1:31:21] they used to
[1:31:22] [Music]
[1:31:26] brother ever had a way of telling things
[1:31:27] he could get away with it you know
[1:31:29] you know there's things that brother
[1:31:30] brown had but
[1:31:32] you see what it is thy love
[1:31:35] be thou ravished always with her love in
[1:31:38] the message you must be born again
[1:31:40] brother braham says
[1:31:42] he speaks of he says a woman he said
[1:31:43] take another man in your arm you marred
[1:31:45] the mold that you were taken from
[1:31:47] remember that when you act like a man
[1:31:49] you're out of your place
[1:31:51] and when man begins to get
[1:31:53] too let me just stop here for a
[1:31:55] moment act like a man and you're out of
[1:31:57] your place remember let me let me just
[1:32:00] deal with this that comes to me
[1:32:02] remember ahab
[1:32:05] you remember ahab
[1:32:06] ahab was a spoiled brat
[1:32:09] [Music]
[1:32:11] maybe we shouldn't i don't know where
[1:32:12] these footnotes coming from but ahab
[1:32:15] seen something that he couldn't have
[1:32:21] is my lip pooched out enough
[1:32:23] [Music]
[1:32:26] nabot wouldn't sell me his vineyard i
[1:32:29] want his vineyard i want it i want it
[1:32:31] i've always got what i got when i wanted
[1:32:33] it daddy always got it for me mama
[1:32:35] always got it for me
[1:32:37] brother bram said you take a man like
[1:32:38] that or marry he'll make life hell on
[1:32:42] earth
[1:32:43] that's a direct quote
[1:32:46] because that's the kind of leadership
[1:32:48] he's exacting
[1:32:49] i always get what i want i always get
[1:32:51] what i want it's got to be my way it's
[1:32:53] it's gone so he pounced
[1:32:55] see he's out of his place so here she
[1:32:58] steps forward
[1:32:59] [Music]
[1:33:02] oh
[1:33:03] darling
[1:33:05] they won't give that to you
[1:33:08] i'll get it for you
[1:33:11] i'll chew him out for you
[1:33:14] see it's feminism working right there
[1:33:16] [Music]
[1:33:17] you're just going to basement and play
[1:33:19] games and i'll take care of acting out
[1:33:21] the role
[1:33:24] this is all free
[1:33:26] [Laughter]
[1:33:28] maybe we shouldn't stopped on that line
[1:33:29] right there but i'll take care of it for
[1:33:31] you oh would you honey would you take my
[1:33:34] role for me
[1:33:36] you
[1:33:39] jellyfish
[1:33:42] this is what ahab was a spoiled brat
[1:33:47] he never had the right he never got the
[1:33:49] right kind of leadership
[1:33:52] because the right kind of leadership you
[1:33:54] might have said well his daddy armory
[1:33:55] and everything else you know they wasn't
[1:33:57] all that bad brother adam tells us like
[1:33:59] this he said i know you know there's
[1:34:01] people that say they're pretty good
[1:34:03] people they don't drink they don't smoke
[1:34:06] they don't do this brother brahma said
[1:34:07] like this take this kentucky grammar the
[1:34:10] wrongest thing they could have ever done
[1:34:12] is not lead their children to christ
[1:34:16] wrongest
[1:34:19] they didn't get the right leadership so
[1:34:21] what you're doing because you get the
[1:34:22] right leadership with god let me tell
[1:34:24] you how that exhibits itself through the
[1:34:26] home it's a life of submission the
[1:34:29] children know daddy's getting his
[1:34:31] leadership from someone above it's
[1:34:34] coming down the wife knows he's getting
[1:34:36] his leadership from one who is above
[1:34:40] what does that bring security
[1:34:43] because we're not under that of flesh
[1:34:44] and blood we're under the oversight of
[1:34:46] the holy ghost
[1:34:50] oh my but you see then then jezebel
[1:34:53] steps up oh honey
[1:34:55] i'll do battle for you
[1:34:57] i know how to take people down on
[1:34:59] facebook
[1:35:00] i know how to rip them down on instagram
[1:35:02] i know honey
[1:35:04] i mean i willed a sword but i've got a
[1:35:05] tongue
[1:35:07] oh lord
[1:35:08] my i know honey you see what it is
[1:35:10] what's she doing she's out of her place
[1:35:12] cause he's out of his place
[1:35:16] come on friends there's been too many
[1:35:18] times where you see men where the where
[1:35:20] the wives is doing everything and well
[1:35:23] there will she'll go fight my battles
[1:35:25] she's not to fight your battles brother
[1:35:27] branham says she's in the battles with
[1:35:30] us
[1:35:33] sometimes just a little bit of
[1:35:34] encouragement from her
[1:35:37] ready to go
[1:35:40] he wanted nabot's vineyard
[1:35:43] see it went from wanting that matchbox
[1:35:45] car i gotta have that
[1:35:48] moves from matchbox car
[1:35:50] to a vineyard
[1:35:52] i'm a bit personal now moves from
[1:35:54] matchbox car till if he can't get what
[1:35:56] he wants when he wants it he pouts
[1:36:00] you can interpret that
[1:36:02] what is that failed leadership
[1:36:05] it didn't get corrected throwing a
[1:36:07] temper tantrum in the floor now it's a
[1:36:09] temper tantrum in the marriage oh god
[1:36:11] help us
[1:36:13] wow wrong leadership
[1:36:15] it starts young that's why brother
[1:36:17] brandon when he preaches the message
[1:36:18] leadership he says when you started out
[1:36:20] it was somebody taking you and guiding
[1:36:22] you along like that with a finger
[1:36:24] is that right teaching them how to walk
[1:36:28] let's stop here i said just a few
[1:36:30] minutes and we
[1:36:31] that quote just exploded like a roman
[1:36:33] candle on me
[1:36:36] when you act like a man you're out of
[1:36:37] your place
[1:36:39] and when man begins to get too and
[1:36:41] babying this and that and the other he's
[1:36:43] out of his place
[1:36:46] i'm trying to get out of this quote
[1:36:50] well my wife just raises the kids
[1:36:54] she's the one that does all the
[1:36:56] correction
[1:36:59] who
[1:37:00] you're not in your place
[1:37:02] you're the one who is to oversee the
[1:37:05] guidance and direction and leadership
[1:37:08] because leadership works with the vision
[1:37:10] of the future
[1:37:13] are you with me
[1:37:15] man we better stop on this quote
[1:37:21] it's the truth
[1:37:23] it's the truth brother samuel that's
[1:37:25] pretty plain intentional
[1:37:27] intentional
[1:37:29] intentional
[1:37:30] intention
[1:37:31] things aren't going to happen osmosis
[1:37:33] when you act like a man you're out of
[1:37:35] your place when a man begins to get us
[1:37:37] get to get two and babying this
[1:37:39] that and the other he's out of his place
[1:37:42] he's boss
[1:37:43] he's ruler
[1:37:45] i gotta close that because we i just
[1:37:46] feel more and more just coming
[1:37:53] as husbands
[1:37:54] and as daddies
[1:37:56] sure we want our children to love us
[1:37:58] but we want the right kind of love
[1:38:01] we want the love that brings faith and
[1:38:04] respect
[1:38:06] not a love
[1:38:07] that says
[1:38:09] well daddy's my favorite
[1:38:12] why
[1:38:13] because
[1:38:15] really what it is daddy gets me to get
[1:38:16] away with what i want to get away with
[1:38:23] no
[1:38:24] i tell you what
[1:38:26] no
[1:38:26] daddy loves to correct his children
[1:38:29] i don't care how good of a home run
[1:38:30] slugger he is nobody likes correcting
[1:38:32] their children
[1:38:34] i mean dad my dad used to tell me you're
[1:38:36] right it's gonna hurt it hurts you worse
[1:38:38] than me
[1:38:39] i'm the one feeling it
[1:38:46] i know
[1:38:47] man i'll tell you i don't know how we're
[1:38:48] getting here
[1:38:49] i know some people oh brother samuel we
[1:38:51] don't believe in the belt we don't
[1:38:52] believe in this we don't believe in this
[1:38:54] you can't take that out of scripture
[1:38:58] granted every child is different
[1:39:01] but if timeout ain't working you need a
[1:39:03] timeout
[1:39:08] and if you're counting to 10 a working
[1:39:10] and you ain't learned how to count to
[1:39:11] ten yet and they stop doing that then
[1:39:14] you don't need more math classes
[1:39:16] you need to come and take the word of
[1:39:18] god because the bible says the rod
[1:39:20] driveth the foolishness out of the
[1:39:23] heart of the child that's the scripture
[1:39:26] that's how god deals with us god didn't
[1:39:28] just take us in and say oh you're so
[1:39:30] sweet you're so lovely the bible said he
[1:39:32] that cometh to god
[1:39:33] must be chastened
[1:39:35] and proven first what is it the word
[1:39:37] begins to deal with our life to what
[1:39:38] drive the foolishness out so that he can
[1:39:41] step in
[1:39:44] oh lord
[1:39:47] [Music]
[1:39:50] my witness needs
[1:39:52] let let it just come down and just rain
[1:39:55] it's it's a wonderful presence here
[1:39:57] isn't it
[1:39:58] because you see
[1:40:00] this is our desire to line up with the
[1:40:01] word of god
[1:40:03] lord let it just let it so saturate in
[1:40:05] on my life
[1:40:07] he leads us in the paths of
[1:40:09] righteousness for his name's sake it's
[1:40:11] not always maybe the paths that we would
[1:40:14] choose and sometimes it's not the things
[1:40:16] that is the easiest it's time sometimes
[1:40:18] of adversity but that's where leadership
[1:40:20] shows
[1:40:23] it shows even in the moments
[1:40:26] of adversity
[1:40:29] the light that we're walking in what
[1:40:31] leadership
[1:40:32] evening light
[1:40:33] in this hour that we're living in it
[1:40:36] shows greater
[1:40:38] and more brighter why
[1:40:40] it's it's not just because
[1:40:44] he's here in his fullness
[1:40:46] but remember it's the contrast the
[1:40:48] darkness declares
[1:40:52] the opposition of the light it's a
[1:40:54] contrast
[1:40:55] the light is so great because the
[1:40:57] darkness also it shows it up it's so
[1:41:00] great we're living in a time of gross
[1:41:01] darkness
[1:41:02] but
[1:41:04] your light has come
[1:41:06] my light has come
[1:41:08] let me say lord i want to walk in that
[1:41:10] atmosphere
[1:41:11] i want to live in that atmosphere i want
[1:41:13] to
[1:41:13] help me to be the the right kind of
[1:41:15] leader and guide even in every in every
[1:41:17] situation no matter what it is lord help
[1:41:19] me to be under your influence for the
