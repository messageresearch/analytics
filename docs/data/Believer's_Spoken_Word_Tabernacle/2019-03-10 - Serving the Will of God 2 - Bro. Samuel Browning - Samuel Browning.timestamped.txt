[21:36] amendments received and she's been
[21:38] really blessed and Amanda's been going
[21:41] through a lot this is about nine months
[21:43] already she was going through so much
[21:45] pain in her body no doctors they
[21:47] couldn't figure it out no matter what
[21:48] test they did to her and so they even
[21:50] started thinking it was probably in her
[21:52] head and I said Lord and I put it before
[21:55] you all and you all put it before the
[21:57] Lord I says Lord you've got to direct me
[21:59] you got to help me Lord we don't know
[22:00] they're saying Lord she's going through
[22:03] pain and it was two in the morning and I
[22:05] remember the Lord just guided me I was
[22:08] looking at the iPad he was guiding me
[22:10] all of a sudden I read about the same
[22:13] kind of patient was going through the
[22:15] same thing with what the issue was
[22:18] and when I had seen that I jumped out of
[22:20] bed I told my daughter she had a mesh I
[22:22] said Amanda it's a mesh that's what's
[22:26] causing the problems well sure enough
[22:28] the Lord directed me exactly because
[22:31] then we were able to go to the doctor
[22:33] then go to and then be guided to what
[22:36] doctor to go to because we didn't know
[22:37] who to go to God just kind of led us to
[22:39] what doctor to go to after we were led
[22:41] to the doctor he led us to what the
[22:44] issue was the and and I'm giving this
[22:47] testimony because I just wanted
[22:48] sometimes you Amanda is still recovering
[22:51] she thanks you continue to keep her in
[22:52] prayer she's coming along really well
[22:54] but I tell you it's just God works
[22:58] miracles when we think that he's not
[23:00] listening and he led us to the doctor a
[23:03] doctor even the surgery was supposed to
[23:05] be four hours and brother Samuel Sister
[23:07] Kim were there and and and we were just
[23:09] talking thinking oh my God this is going
[23:11] to be a long day I think it had to be
[23:12] half hour that doctor came out and we
[23:14] were like he says it's done he goes he
[23:17] goes let me talk to you about it it's
[23:19] done he says actually he goes when I
[23:21] went in there because they were talking
[23:23] about being being complicated and it was
[23:25] going to be in the nerves and it was a
[23:27] mess and it could have been a mess for
[23:29] her could have been worse God had that
[23:30] theme floating on top God had the nerves
[23:33] right on top where they were able to get
[23:35] those nerves immediately Amanda was

[30:53] Hallelujah
[30:55] you know it's it's not hard to testify
[30:58] to that when we're on the mountain
[31:01] but you know when you've been on the
[31:04] mountain you've been in the valley
[31:06] there's always then the mountain then
[31:08] there'll be the valley then there's the
[31:10] mountain there's the valley but in the
[31:12] midst of it where you can stand and
[31:14] testify God is good all the time
[31:17] he's faithful
[31:19] he's faithful
[31:21] you know to think of it one time in the
[31:23] scriptures where that the enemy would
[31:25] vaunt himself lift himself up against
[31:28] that of Israel and said
[31:30] he's God of the mountains but he's not
[31:32] God of the valley
[31:33] God heard that
[31:35] God heard that
[31:37] when God heard that God said I will show
[31:39] that I am God of the valley
[31:42] and I'm grateful for that this morning
[31:45] we find that in our lives you see it
[31:47] throughout even the the book of Acts we
[31:50] go through trials we go through tests
[31:52] and you know that fruit itself is never
[31:55] it's never made or born on the
[31:57] Mountaintop The Mountaintop is only the
[32:00] expression that you've come through the
[32:02] valley
[32:03] but I'm grateful like David said yea
[32:05] though I walk through the valley
[32:06] of the shadow of death I will fear no
[32:09] evil
[32:10] amen for in that same scripture in
[32:13] Psalms 23 is the same scripture where it
[32:16] speaks of how that the Lord leads us he
[32:19] leads us into those places even to the
[32:21] Mountaintop he's led us to the mountain
[32:23] we graze we feed we take in and then
[32:27] here we come right back down into the
[32:28] valley but you see in the valley it
[32:31] shows what you've been eating up on the
[32:32] good table lands
[32:35] you find as we said all through the
[32:38] times of the book of Acts and different
[32:39] times you you watch the word of how that
[32:42] it'll say the church was being tested
[32:44] and then it'll say and then the church
[32:46] has had rest
[32:48] there's always it goes in Cycles you
[32:51] know there's times where we want to
[32:52] abide under the nice palm trees Lord
[32:55] just another day just another moment

[40:39] Hallelujah
[40:42] God bless you if we could let's turn in
[40:44] our Bibles
[40:46] we want to turn to Deuteronomy chapter
[40:49] 17.
[40:52] and
[40:54] we want to just by the help of the Lord
[40:56] just resume this morning just to
[40:59] continue a little bit
[41:02] in this thought we begin looking at last
[41:05] last Sunday on serving
[41:08] the will of God
[41:10] serving the will of God
[41:12] you know it's one thing when you think
[41:15] of the thoughts serving the will of God
[41:18] you realize it's always a choice
[41:22] in the beginning God made known his will
[41:25] and there was a choice whether they
[41:28] would serve his will
[41:30] and when you look at even when Abel and
[41:35] Cain they came to the time to worship
[41:39] and God moved down and God Vindicated
[41:43] able sacrifice with his presence
[41:46] and God showing that he had rejected
[41:50] Cain's sacrifice his presence did not
[41:53] come to confirm it and then to think how
[41:56] that God just simply made known to Cain
[42:00] at that time and he said why are you
[42:02] cast down why is your countenance so
[42:05] Roth he asked him that question and you
[42:09] know Cain Cain knew what the perfect
[42:12] will of God was when he saw the presence
[42:16] of God come down and vindicate Abel's
[42:21] sacrifice
[42:22] I want you just the Simplicity of it he
[42:25] didn't have to understand it
[42:28] he just had to see it and submit to it
[42:34] but Cain chose not to serve the will of
[42:38] God
[42:40] and that's a very
[42:42] something that very dearly in our hearts
[42:45] that when we are looking as Believers we
[42:48] know that God's presence will always
[42:51] accompany in his word and we want to be
[42:54] sensitive to the presence of the Lord
[42:58] I want to be sensitive to that
[43:01] so we just want the Lord that he would
[43:03] just come direct our thoughts this
[43:05] morning and not our thoughts but that
[43:07] his thoughts would be the ones that
[43:09] would direct us this morning so we just
[43:12] want to move under that canopy and that
[43:14] protection of our Lord Jesus Christ
[43:16] verse 14 I'm just going to read two
[43:19] verses and we'll let you be seated when
[43:21] when thou art come unto the land which
[43:24] the Lord thy God giveth thee and shalt
[43:26] possess it and shalt dwell therein and
[43:29] shalt say I will set a king over me like
[43:33] as all the nations uh like as all the
[43:36] nations that are around about me
[43:40] Thou shalt in any way in any way set him
[43:45] King over thee whom the Lord thy God
[43:48] shall choose that's a very important
[43:50] point
[43:51] you shall set over you whom the Lord thy
[43:55] God shall choose
[43:57] now you realize
[44:00] that God will actually give people and
[44:04] allow people
[44:06] to have their own choice
[44:10] he'll allow them to have their own
[44:12] choice this is why we always want our
[44:14] choice to be his choice
[44:17] this is where as brother bam tells us in
[44:20] the message the breach he says when we
[44:22] are redeemed we no longer want our own
[44:24] choice
[44:26] we want we have made him our choice and
[44:29] we want what he wants so Thou shalt in
[44:32] any way set him King over thee whom the
[44:34] Lord thy God shall choose one from among
[44:37] thy Brethren shalt thou set King over
[44:40] thee thou mayest not set a stranger over
[44:43] thee which is not thy brother may God
[44:47] bless you bless the reading of the word
[44:49] is being seated
[44:52] there's much counsel that God goes
[44:54] through and gives
[44:56] concerning this in the book of
[44:58] Deuteronomy in this in this portion and
[45:00] gives the characteristic of what is to
[45:03] be had there with with the King that his
[45:07] objectives and all of the motives what
[45:10] what everything is to be set for and I
[45:13] believe you can sum it up in this
[45:14] measure that the king is to hold fast
[45:17] with one desire and heart and that's to
[45:20] obey the Lord to serve him to serve his
[45:24] word to serve his people
[45:27] and so when we when we look at this in
[45:30] the scriptures if we move ahead in first
[45:34] Samuel 8 we find where the people the
[45:37] people of God hear the children of
[45:39] Israel they've come into the land
[45:41] and as they've come into the land we
[45:43] find just as God himself made known to
[45:46] them when you come into the land and you
[45:50] begin to see the other nations that are
[45:53] around you that you would say let us set
[45:56] a king up over us like the other nations
[45:59] and the the problem with that is as we
[46:03] read here in just a few moments is that
[46:06] their purpose and their motive in doing
[46:10] it was that they were wanting to be like
[46:14] the rest of the Nations that they were
[46:18] beholding so I find here in first Samuel
[46:21] chapter 8 verse 4 all the Elders of
[46:24] Israel they gathered themselves together
[46:25] and they came to Samuel unto Rhema you
[46:29] you we realized that Samuel was God's
[46:32] gift and what I mean by God's Gift a
[46:35] channel that God himself would speak to
[46:39] the children of Israel that God himself
[46:41] might lead them there or continue to
[46:44] lead them by his word because remember
[46:46] the Bible tells us that before this time
[46:50] there was no open vision
[46:52] and yet the people when you would look
[46:54] at it it wasn't that the people
[46:56] themselves were not looking at the word
[46:59] but an open Vision it deals with a
[47:02] channel that is open to to be able to
[47:06] know God's Will and God's abiding
[47:09] presence to guide and direct the people
[47:12] in other words we just don't it's not
[47:14] just a people that are just going
[47:16] through the motions with things and just
[47:19] looking at things that were in their day
[47:21] where they were looking at the word they
[47:23] were looking over the law they were
[47:25] looking over those things but yet they
[47:27] were just kind of going through the
[47:29] motions and they they got their focus
[47:31] away and off of the Lord by looking at
[47:35] all of these other things and then when
[47:38] they would even begin to wonder why are
[47:41] we losing battles
[47:43] why are we not having Victory like we
[47:46] should be having and it always comes
[47:49] down to and we see that even when Israel
[47:51] entered the land you see with Aiken he
[47:53] got his eyes on the wrong thing and when
[47:56] any time the eye and the heart or
[47:58] anything gets set on the wrong thing it
[48:00] is just one little thing that that can
[48:03] enter in that can actually remove
[48:05] Victory from a heart and from a life and
[48:08] remove Victory from the camp and so we
[48:11] we recognize within that we we desire I
[48:14] believe I believe that every one of us
[48:16] would desire and I believe it's
[48:18] something we always have to stay before
[48:20] God and staying in his presence that
[48:23] Lord let every one of my desires and let
[48:26] everything be checked and let it be Lord
[48:29] God one with what your desire is if one
[48:33] I'm looking at is not your desire then
[48:36] Lord I don't want it and even if I can
[48:39] look at it and it looks wholesome
[48:41] there's nothing in the word against it
[48:42] but Lord
[48:43] you know you know what I have need of
[48:47] you know the timing you know all things
[48:50] so Lord you who have brought me from my
[48:54] mother's womb then Lord I'm trusting on
[48:57] you to guide me every step of the way as
[49:00] you've dealt with my heart you see it's
[49:02] the realizing that God has had his hand
[49:06] upon our life it's him that is leading
[49:08] us
[49:10] So within it it's things that as as here
[49:14] they came to Samuel and the Bible says
[49:17] in verse 5 and they said unto him behold
[49:19] Thou Art old and thy Sons walk not in
[49:22] thy ways now make us a king to judge us
[49:25] like all the nations but the thing
[49:28] displeased Samuel when they said it give
[49:30] us a king to judge us and Samuel prayed
[49:33] unto the Lord oh my
[49:35] well that's a place to take it can you
[49:37] say amen and the Lord said unto Samuel
[49:40] hearken unto the voice of the people in
[49:43] all that they say unto thee for they
[49:45] have not rejected thee but they have
[49:48] rejected me that I should not Reign Over
[49:52] them
[49:54] according to all the works which they
[49:56] have done since the day that I brought
[49:59] them up out of Egypt even unto this day
[50:01] wherewith they have forsaken me and
[50:04] served other gods so do they also unto
[50:07] thee you see spirits never die
[50:11] Spirits never die it's just like how God
[50:14] would move you see it in the days of the
[50:16] judges here in Samuel himself not only a
[50:18] prophet but a judge and to see how that
[50:21] you know God would bring a Deliverance
[50:23] in Israel I think of how that Nehemiah
[50:26] you know under inspiration would say it
[50:27] he sent them saviors he sent them those
[50:30] who would be in contact with God and God
[50:33] would hear and respond to the Cry of his
[50:36] people and they would come in
[50:37] Deliverance but then you would find
[50:39] after a Deliverance that they themselves
[50:41] failed to maintain that that walk before
[50:44] God and they would form themselves right
[50:46] back into the very the very mold of what
[50:51] God had called them out from and so when
[50:54] here he goes on to say hearken unto
[50:56] their voice how be it yet protest
[50:59] solemnly unto them and show them the
[51:02] manner of the king that shall reign over
[51:06] them now you see here when we look at
[51:09] this the manner of the king that would
[51:11] Reign Over them to recognize that even
[51:14] based on their choice and what would be
[51:16] made then it's also going to reveal or
[51:19] be able to make known that the choice
[51:21] and the way that they have went about
[51:23] this that it makes known exactly what
[51:26] this king is going to be like who's
[51:28] going to Reign Over them you're going to
[51:30] know that because how can you tell that
[51:32] you can tell that by the desire and what
[51:35] is motivating within their heart
[51:38] so watch how that you know when we look
[51:41] at this we find that you know brother
[51:43] Brandon would identified in this manner
[51:45] that that Spirit of antichrist that was
[51:47] moving in here it's not new and and here
[51:51] you know now look how this moved in
[51:53] there the people themselves were in fear
[51:56] they were afraid
[51:58] and so because of fear why would they be
[52:01] in fear
[52:04] but you see when this little departure
[52:06] from the word even before then it brings
[52:09] fear
[52:11] and it's like they're trying to ensure
[52:13] their survival their protection and and
[52:16] they're fail to recognize wait a minute
[52:18] you didn't bring yourself out of Egypt
[52:22] you didn't bring yourself across to
[52:23] Jordan
[52:25] it is I the Lord that have brought thee
[52:28] that have brought you to where you are
[52:30] but you see in the midst of that time of
[52:32] fear then that's when the spirit of
[52:34] antichrist comes in
[52:37] now watch this he goes on to speak he
[52:40] says that's not that's something that
[52:42] came in through the church ages and he
[52:43] says now it goes against God and it
[52:46] takes over in the church uh and he
[52:49] begins to bring this out of the Old
[52:51] Testament and I'm just trying to move
[52:53] through this here a little bit we we
[52:55] just to kind of cover review a little
[52:57] bit here this morning he goes in and
[53:00] says that early church started out
[53:02] talking about there from the day of
[53:03] Pentecost the early church started out
[53:05] under the pure Ministry of the holy
[53:07] spirit with signs wonders and
[53:09] manifestations such as prophecy tongues
[53:12] interpretation wisdom knowledge and
[53:15] healing so in the days of Israel when
[53:18] they left Egypt they were under the
[53:20] leadership of the spirit of God
[53:22] manifesting in gifts God was the leader
[53:25] of the people actually he was their King
[53:28] he was a father King he took care of
[53:32] Israel like a man cares for his family
[53:34] he fed them fought their battles move
[53:38] the way their difficulties and settled
[53:40] their problems he just busied himself
[53:43] over them they were the only nation to
[53:45] which he was truly God
[53:48] now God had men listen to me God had men
[53:52] that he chose Vindicated by his presence
[53:56] and by his presence God would would we
[53:58] know would would direct the people but
[54:00] it wasn't the man himself directing the
[54:03] people but it was the leadership of the
[54:07] Holy Spirit
[54:09] that's the greatest that's the greatest
[54:12] uh reality and that is what is the most
[54:15] important is to have the leadership of
[54:19] the Holy Spirit
[54:22] that's more that's more important to
[54:25] have the presence of God through guiding
[54:28] and directing and moving us within the
[54:31] word that's more important there because
[54:33] it will always direct us into his word
[54:40] he supplied every need they had need of
[54:42] think about how how that God even when
[54:45] you look at where Moses is at and the
[54:47] burden would strike Moses to where he
[54:49] would say even in the time they're in
[54:51] Exodus and you find it there in numbers
[54:53] you find it in a Deuteronomy of how that
[54:56] Moses would even make and say Lord let
[54:58] there be a man that would stand before
[55:00] the people there Lord let them be one so
[55:03] they would have a Shepherd one that
[55:05] would be able to guide them but it
[55:07] wasn't a man but it was that one who
[55:10] would be in contact with God that God
[55:13] could speak to his people God would
[55:16] Minister to his people where did Moses
[55:18] get that desire from he got that desire
[55:21] from God
[55:23] he realized that our protection is the
[55:27] presence of God in Walking In obedience
[55:29] to his word think about it they went
[55:32] through a Wilderness there where people
[55:34] was all around them in different times
[55:35] they came out against them but who kept
[55:38] them they were not an organized Army
[55:42] they were not a great military come on
[55:45] somebody who was it that fought their
[55:47] battles the Lord fought their battles
[55:50] who wants it that kept them almighty God
[55:52] kept them and he was manifesting you see
[55:54] what God was doing let's say day one
[55:57] what God did day one was to build faith
[56:00] for day two what he does day two is to
[56:03] build faith for day 10 on and on it's to
[56:06] be there is to be an increasing and a
[56:09] building of Faith to where the people of
[56:11] God are resting more and more in his
[56:15] presence than their abilities
[56:21] no wonder David could say what time I am
[56:23] afraid I will trust in thee
[56:26] Hallelujah
[56:28] glory be to God we're not on that King
[56:30] yet but
[56:33] notice this
[56:34] but one day they got to looking around
[56:36] and they saw the Philistines and other
[56:40] nations with Kings over them it cocked
[56:42] their eyes and they decided that they
[56:45] ought to humanize their leadership so
[56:47] they wanted a king now God was going to
[56:50] humanize the leadership himself in the
[56:53] person of the Lord Jesus Christ but they
[56:56] got ahead of him
[57:00] yeah true God was going to do that but
[57:04] they got ahead of him
[57:06] but how because influence there was
[57:09] influence that came their way
[57:12] Satan knew the plan of God so he put it
[57:15] in the hearts of the people to get ahead
[57:18] of God the word do you realize is what I
[57:21] just referred to you about Cain brother
[57:23] random tells us in power transformation
[57:25] Satan knows the will of God
[57:29] he knows it but he refuses to do it
[57:34] he knows it but you see his objective is
[57:38] look for a people here he's not going to
[57:41] be able to pull these people away and
[57:44] say well the law is no good and and what
[57:46] you've got this word and this message of
[57:49] a prophet but what he has to do is he
[57:51] has to get them outside of the
[57:53] boundaries of protection where the
[57:56] presence of God let me tell you
[57:57] something friends the latter is not our
[58:00] protection it's the presence of God the
[58:03] person of Jesus Christ and let me tell
[58:06] you the person of Jesus Christ will
[58:08] never get outside the word
[58:11] he stays in the boundaries of his word
[58:17] there's a lot of things he can do Beyond
[58:18] his word but remember the real reality
[58:21] where we ourselves our confidence and
[58:24] where our trust and our rest is he
[58:26] performs his word and that's good enough
[58:29] for me
[58:34] now watch this
[58:36] has Satan had put that in the people's
[58:39] hearts trying to get them ahead
[58:42] so when we loan us with God's will
[58:45] because every one of us are faced with
[58:47] decisions
[58:50] every one of us
[58:52] and even though
[58:54] that to have a king over them was the
[58:57] plan of God
[58:59] it was the will of God but it has to be
[59:02] God's way in God's time
[59:07] that's the two key things God's will you
[59:10] know we don't have to fret ourselves
[59:11] about God's will
[59:13] when you're praying about something in
[59:15] your life you don't have to be anxious
[59:18] somebody help me preach now because
[59:20] we've got to battle that thing
[59:22] we got a battle yes sir but when we what
[59:25] it comes down to is US recognizing wait
[59:28] a minute if our heart is just in tune
[59:31] with God if God wants us to make a step
[59:33] here then as long listen as we are
[59:36] staying in step with him I I love the
[59:39] scripture as it says in the opening of
[59:41] Psalms 119 it said wherewith shall a
[59:44] young man cleanse his way by taking heed
[59:46] to Thy word and it goes on to say in
[59:48] Psalms 119 that they who seek Him shall
[59:51] do no iniquity
[59:53] that's powerful brother let me tell you
[59:55] something when God is the focus of the
[59:58] life and you're seeking after God let me
[1:00:00] tell you something God when you come to
[1:00:02] a mountain he'll make a way through that
[1:00:04] mountain
[1:00:06] when you come to a river he'll make a
[1:00:08] way through that River
[1:00:10] be the main important thing is is stay
[1:00:12] in contact with his presence so when the
[1:00:15] unction moves you're ready to make a
[1:00:17] step when it's time to make a step
[1:00:21] lean not to your own understanding
[1:00:24] you know that's a powerful scripture and
[1:00:26] to think of it the very man who wrote
[1:00:28] that under inspiration eventually leaned
[1:00:30] to his own understanding
[1:00:33] are you with me I'm not going in that
[1:00:35] far this morning but to see where it is
[1:00:37] it's to abide we're under the presence
[1:00:40] of almighty God
[1:00:42] about now to thank you because you look
[1:00:45] the man it's not a man's word it's God's
[1:00:48] word
[1:00:49] so it the way in timing and this is why
[1:00:51] that God will always reveal his will in
[1:00:55] his season you know it's one thing you
[1:00:57] and I we can look at print
[1:01:00] you and I can look at print words quote
[1:01:03] scriptures and you can try to take that
[1:01:06] and just forcefully apply it and this is
[1:01:09] this way and this is that way but
[1:01:11] friends if you miss the leading of the
[1:01:13] Holy Spirit the presence of God to move
[1:01:16] down within that right time you have
[1:01:18] missed the very one who is the enforcer
[1:01:21] of the word
[1:01:23] God has never called you and I to be
[1:01:26] self-reliant self-willed he wants us to
[1:01:30] serve his will
[1:01:32] now watch this this way in timing this
[1:01:34] is why we need the ministry of the Holy
[1:01:37] Spirit we need that of the word for God
[1:01:39] to come down the life of ministry to be
[1:01:42] able to move down that the Holy Spirit
[1:01:44] not man I can't know how you know even
[1:01:46] if I know what's on your heart or what
[1:01:48] it is you're going through I still am
[1:01:50] reserved to follow the leading of the
[1:01:53] Holy Spirit
[1:01:55] sometimes that's the thing with the
[1:01:56] pastor you know sometimes as a pastor I
[1:01:59] can know sometimes the different needs
[1:02:00] maybe there's sometimes there's things
[1:02:02] that you've spoke to me or or other
[1:02:03] things like that but yet within it all
[1:02:05] you know and I thank God for you know
[1:02:07] the brothers and sisters that really
[1:02:08] protect me because I don't need to know
[1:02:10] all the business God himself is the one
[1:02:12] who needs to know he's the one who's
[1:02:14] been leading this church he's the one
[1:02:16] that that has to be the one to move
[1:02:18] within the situations and the different
[1:02:20] needs to settle troubled hearts to
[1:02:22] answer questions it has to be the Lord
[1:02:24] to do that but to recognize that how we
[1:02:27] need that word coming down and
[1:02:29] Discerning the very thoughts and intents
[1:02:32] of the heart we need that judgment seat
[1:02:34] of Christ so that because there's
[1:02:36] sometimes where we've been inclined in a
[1:02:39] certain way and the way that we've been
[1:02:41] inclined it seemed like this is exactly
[1:02:43] perfect this is what we need to do and
[1:02:46] yet when we find as we will just be
[1:02:48] sensitive to the Lord the Lord could say
[1:02:50] nothing in my word against it it's
[1:02:52] everything according to it's fine with
[1:02:54] my word but it's not for you to do it or
[1:02:57] it's not my will and he can go right
[1:02:59] down through that example when brother
[1:03:01] Brandon was standing there and preparing
[1:03:03] to enter into Israel was it not God's
[1:03:06] will his word that the that the gospel
[1:03:08] itself the same baptism of the Holy
[1:03:11] Ghost that has been poured out upon the
[1:03:13] Gentiles here down through the Gentile
[1:03:15] ages is it not so that God is going to
[1:03:18] visit his people wherein that the
[1:03:20] fountain in the House of David shall be
[1:03:21] opened he is indeed going to do that but
[1:03:24] he will do it in his way and in his time
[1:03:29] think of what God told the Prophet this
[1:03:32] is not your place this is not the time
[1:03:38] it's always what is God's time I believe
[1:03:41] with all my heart if we can be sensitive
[1:03:43] to God about everything whether it comes
[1:03:46] to buying a house he comes to buying a
[1:03:48] car it comes to every little aspect
[1:03:50] about our life I believe we need to see
[1:03:53] God what's your will on this it is so
[1:03:56] much maybe if it's ten dollars and
[1:03:58] you've got 30 well to praise God I've
[1:04:00] got the money to cover that may not be
[1:04:01] God's will we ought to seek for the will
[1:04:04] of God because it might be ten dollars
[1:04:06] and there'll be a day you only got five
[1:04:08] and if the God has made known that's his
[1:04:10] will it doesn't matter if it costs ten
[1:04:12] dollars and all you got is five you're
[1:04:14] able to say God has made known this is
[1:04:17] his will so if I'm in his will he is
[1:04:20] Jehovah Jireh
[1:04:22] that's the comfort that we receive in
[1:04:25] the times when pressure comes
[1:04:29] so if we find in the scripture here even
[1:04:31] we find in the opening part of the
[1:04:33] scripture Eve how that God came to eat
[1:04:37] he didn't come to Adam I mean how sorry
[1:04:38] how the how did Satan bear through the
[1:04:40] tool of the serpent he came to eat he
[1:04:43] didn't go to Adam
[1:04:46] and the very thing that he did he dealt
[1:04:48] with Eve and began to project to her you
[1:04:51] know God had already said you're
[1:04:53] multiply and replenish the Earth but God
[1:04:55] had not made known his will his timing
[1:05:00] all the way all the way that it would be
[1:05:02] in the season God had not made that
[1:05:04] known so where did Satan come to tempt
[1:05:07] and to test them out when it came not to
[1:05:10] say oh what God Said ain't the truth you
[1:05:12] know you ain't gone there's not going to
[1:05:13] be no multiplying that's not how he came
[1:05:15] and attacked it the way that he came and
[1:05:18] attacked it was is to try to get her to
[1:05:21] move ahead you know if Satan cannot keep
[1:05:24] people back from the word of God then
[1:05:26] he'll try to push them beyond the will
[1:05:29] of God
[1:05:33] same thing with Sarah
[1:05:34] we find you know what happened there
[1:05:36] with Eve then you find the same thing
[1:05:38] with Syria it's very important that we
[1:05:40] say that Sarah this is before before God
[1:05:43] came down and God identified himself
[1:05:46] with her by giving her of his of his
[1:05:49] letter of a that that Breath of God to
[1:05:53] where his presence there would have come
[1:05:54] to her life before that time it was
[1:05:57] sarri I
[1:05:59] am and so she I think my opinion my
[1:06:03] thoughts I'll tell you friends we don't
[1:06:05] have no business with our thoughts or
[1:06:07] our opinions
[1:06:09] our thoughts and our opinions ought to
[1:06:11] be before the prince of God
[1:06:13] that's the truth you know you don't want
[1:06:16] me preaching my opinions and I'm going
[1:06:18] to preach my opinions I don't want my
[1:06:20] thoughts I want what God wants
[1:06:22] because opinions and thoughts ain't
[1:06:24] gonna Rapture nobody it ain't gonna give
[1:06:26] no overcoming power to nobody but the
[1:06:28] one thing that'll give overcoming power
[1:06:30] and bring Deliverance is the word of God
[1:06:32] preached by the Holy Ghost
[1:06:34] Hallelujah so to find out when you look
[1:06:37] at Sarah here she got ahead notice it
[1:06:40] was God's will think of this now it was
[1:06:42] God's will that there would be a seed
[1:06:45] that would come from the very loins of
[1:06:47] Abraham right but God has not revealed
[1:06:50] the pathway or the womb of who it was to
[1:06:54] be at that time although that Sarah was
[1:06:56] God's intended womb for Abraham's seed
[1:07:00] but yet Abraham's seed under that of the
[1:07:03] urging of Sarah under her voice under
[1:07:06] the timing under the way she said why
[1:07:08] don't you give your seed here to that of
[1:07:10] Hager a bonds woman now notice nothing
[1:07:13] wrong with Abraham's seed
[1:07:16] there's nothing wrong with the Holy
[1:07:18] Ghost
[1:07:19] it's just got to fall upon the right
[1:07:23] individuals
[1:07:25] come on somebody the Bible says in the
[1:07:27] last days that he poured out his Spirit
[1:07:29] upon All Flesh
[1:07:32] and upon my servants and my handmaids
[1:07:35] God has an intended target for the
[1:07:39] outpouring of the Holy Ghost look what
[1:07:41] it did look what that seed did within
[1:07:43] Ishmael Ishmael himself could never come
[1:07:46] under the authority of the word
[1:07:49] yet he could say I am a son of Abraham
[1:07:54] but he never came under the headship of
[1:07:57] the word
[1:07:58] but look what the difference was when it
[1:08:01] actually came into the intended womb of
[1:08:03] Sarah and that Seed Life of Abraham
[1:08:06] moved in that time it was a seed life
[1:08:08] that God had allowed Abraham to dry up
[1:08:11] and become as good as dead and then God
[1:08:13] himself raised that back up God himself
[1:08:15] changed their their bodies and God
[1:08:18] himself is the one who actually brought
[1:08:21] the promise to pass it was not Abraham's
[1:08:24] strength it was the strength of Jehovah
[1:08:27] that brought forth his promised word
[1:08:31] and you look at Isaac here you find one
[1:08:34] then where that life has come it's one
[1:08:37] who's under the headship of the word it
[1:08:40] didn't mean that he didn't make mistakes
[1:08:41] but remember when the presence of God
[1:08:44] came to him he made whatever was wrong
[1:08:47] he made it right
[1:08:52] come on somebody
[1:08:53] you see this is why it's not our
[1:08:56] righteousness
[1:08:59] there's one who's the king of
[1:09:01] righteousness and that is our
[1:09:03] Melchizedek and that same life in us
[1:09:06] we're born of that we're born after the
[1:09:09] order of Melchizedek and then as he's
[1:09:11] the king of righteousness then that's
[1:09:13] what's exhibited in the kingdom of God
[1:09:16] is righteousness of almighty God
[1:09:20] Glory
[1:09:22] now watch us here just a few moments
[1:09:24] let's look at this example let me just
[1:09:26] show you here in the word or let the
[1:09:28] Lord just take us in the book of Exodus
[1:09:31] you find something here and I don't know
[1:09:34] if I'll read all these verses or just
[1:09:36] refer to them but you find here is Moses
[1:09:40] and here is something that takes place
[1:09:42] in verse 13 where Moses father-in-law
[1:09:45] Jethro is taking no notice of something
[1:09:50] and it came to pass on the morrow that
[1:09:52] Moses set to judge the people and the
[1:09:54] people stood by Moses from the morning
[1:09:56] unto the evening and when Moses
[1:09:59] father-in-law saw all that he did to the
[1:10:01] people he said what is this thing that
[1:10:03] thou doest to the people why sidest thou
[1:10:06] by self alone and all the people stand
[1:10:08] by thee from morning unto even and Moses
[1:10:11] said unto his father-in-law because the
[1:10:13] people come unto me to inquire of God
[1:10:16] when they have a matter they come to me
[1:10:19] and I judge between one and another I do
[1:10:22] make them know the statutes of God and
[1:10:24] his laws and Moses father-in-law said
[1:10:28] unto him the thing that thou doest is
[1:10:31] not good thou Wilt surely wear away both
[1:10:36] thou and this people that is with thee
[1:10:39] for this thing is too heavy for thee
[1:10:41] thou are not able to perform it thyself
[1:10:44] alone hearken now unto my voice and I
[1:10:48] will give thee counsel and and God shall
[1:10:51] be with thee be thou for the people to
[1:10:53] God's word that thou mayest bring the
[1:10:55] causes unto God now when you look on
[1:10:58] down in the scripture without me going
[1:11:01] through and reading it God here here uh
[1:11:04] Moses father-in-law he begins to lay
[1:11:06] down what needs to be done you teach him
[1:11:08] the ordinances you teach these men the
[1:11:11] statutes and so forth and then he says
[1:11:13] in verse 21 that Marvel Thou shalt
[1:11:16] provide out of all the people able men
[1:11:18] such as fear God men of Truth hating
[1:11:21] covetness and and thus our place over
[1:11:23] them to be rulers of thousands rulers of
[1:11:25] hundreds rulers of fifty rulers of tens
[1:11:27] and let them judge the people at all
[1:11:30] seasons and it shall be that every great
[1:11:32] matter that they bring unto thee but
[1:11:35] every small matter they shall judge so
[1:11:38] shall it be easier for thyself and they
[1:11:41] shall bear the burden with thee and he
[1:11:44] goes on to say you know if thou would do
[1:11:47] this and and verse 24 says Moses heart
[1:11:50] into the voice of his father-in-law
[1:11:53] key point
[1:11:54] he hearkened to the voice of his
[1:11:56] father-in-law
[1:11:58] his father-in-law made a good
[1:12:01] observation
[1:12:03] he could see the weariness that was upon
[1:12:06] Moses that there's no way I mean he's
[1:12:09] he's seen him you know whether he was
[1:12:11] staggering or whatever you was going on
[1:12:13] he did and he you know he could look at
[1:12:15] there's no way that you are going to be
[1:12:17] able to do this because here's what it
[1:12:18] comes down to if Moses Burns himself out
[1:12:22] what good are you for the kingdom
[1:12:26] that's why the Bible says be you not
[1:12:28] weary and well doing
[1:12:32] there Comes A Time to Say no
[1:12:34] here's there comes a time to rest
[1:12:37] come on somebody
[1:12:39] you see but what they were seeing
[1:12:41] because when you look at it he was
[1:12:43] letting it be known hey I'm seeing you
[1:12:45] need to rest you you need you can't be
[1:12:47] you can't be taking all this upon
[1:12:49] yourself what he has said to Moses it's
[1:12:53] good it's it's good uh counsel and all
[1:12:56] those things but the difference is is
[1:12:58] it's got to be of the Lord
[1:13:03] and let me tell you something when it's
[1:13:05] of God remember what's the whole
[1:13:07] objective here the whole objective that
[1:13:10] it shall be easier for thyself not that
[1:13:12] you have an easy way to go but that you
[1:13:14] yourself are not coming to a place of
[1:13:17] that weariness to where that you're not
[1:13:19] going to be able to serve
[1:13:21] true
[1:13:23] so let's see how this works out
[1:13:26] let's see if this is easier
[1:13:29] numbers 11 verse 14.
[1:13:32] here is Moses
[1:13:34] I am not able to the Lord I'm not able
[1:13:37] to Bear all this people
[1:13:40] alone
[1:13:41] wait a minute I thought he had all of
[1:13:44] these rulers enable men men of Truth men
[1:13:47] who hated covenants I thought he had all
[1:13:49] of them set up that he would be able to
[1:13:51] teach them and that through that right
[1:13:53] there he himself would not be so worried
[1:13:59] so even though he's got everything p's
[1:14:02] and q's
[1:14:03] he still feels alone
[1:14:09] he still feels old
[1:14:16] he's not supposed to feel this what was
[1:14:20] mentioned in the earlier part in
[1:14:21] Deuteronomy by his father-in-law was
[1:14:24] supposed to relieve this burden
[1:14:27] but it didn't
[1:14:30] and if thou deal look what look what
[1:14:32] Moses said if thou deal thus with me
[1:14:36] kill me
[1:14:37] he didn't even ask God say Lord give me
[1:14:39] a vacation he said you know what just
[1:14:40] kill me
[1:14:42] just end it I mean I I I can't take no
[1:14:45] more
[1:14:46] I pray thee out of hand if I have found
[1:14:50] favor in myself can you imagine that
[1:14:52] Lord if I found favor kill me
[1:14:58] and let me not see my wretchedness do
[1:15:01] you realize what's being said right here
[1:15:03] Moses himself you see God's burden
[1:15:06] within Moses he realizes this is the
[1:15:09] people of God though there's been times
[1:15:11] where they disobeyed but yet they are
[1:15:13] God's inheritance and they deserve the
[1:15:16] very best
[1:15:18] glory be to God they deserve the very
[1:15:21] best and Lord as he's saying right now
[1:15:24] Lord I can't give them the very best
[1:15:27] I am wretched
[1:15:30] I am weary
[1:15:31] I can't do this alone
[1:15:34] wow he's got all of this structure
[1:15:38] everything is lined up
[1:15:40] you know he's got the treasure the
[1:15:42] deacons the trustees all those things be
[1:15:44] it he's alone
[1:15:46] well y'all getting quiet you're
[1:15:48] wondering where I'm going
[1:15:52] and the Lord said unto Moses
[1:15:55] gather unto me
[1:15:58] 70 men of the Elders of Israel whom thou
[1:16:04] notice
[1:16:06] thou knowest
[1:16:08] notice who's together Moses
[1:16:11] whom thou knowest because there could
[1:16:14] have been ones in the camp that said
[1:16:15] tell you what I think brother so and so
[1:16:17] I'll make a good one
[1:16:19] hello somebody
[1:16:21] but see Moses no brother so-and-so
[1:16:25] Moses no brother so-and-so might be a
[1:16:27] little stubborn a little bit hard and
[1:16:29] not really moving with the rest of the
[1:16:31] vision good brother wonderful brother
[1:16:33] but just not really one who would work
[1:16:36] one with a vision now you know God don't
[1:16:38] like yes men how many all know that God
[1:16:41] don't like yes men but you bet at the
[1:16:43] reality of it God wants people who are
[1:16:46] in tune with his vision
[1:16:50] that's God's desire and there can be
[1:16:52] that reciprocal work of we're saying hey
[1:16:54] you think about this if you consider
[1:16:56] this but you see it works in harmony
[1:16:58] with the vision
[1:17:01] I'll tell you friends that's why it's so
[1:17:02] important that when even the choosing of
[1:17:05] a church that a church is chosen based
[1:17:08] on does listen this is what brother Ram
[1:17:09] gave us are they standing for the word
[1:17:12] and is the presence of God the
[1:17:16] supernatural there
[1:17:18] he never mentioned anything else
[1:17:22] you know why because every single church
[1:17:24] is sovereign
[1:17:29] one might take up the offering this way
[1:17:31] one might do it this way but everyone is
[1:17:34] Sovereign what makes it Sovereign you
[1:17:36] must find the leadership of the Holy
[1:17:38] Ghost for that group of people
[1:17:43] God don't want you to realize even to
[1:17:45] pattern pattern after this hold this
[1:17:47] assembly here or we'll pattern after
[1:17:49] this God don't want us pattern after
[1:17:51] nobody he wants us to follow the
[1:17:54] leadership of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:58] I'll tell you friends that's why it's so
[1:18:00] important it's just like when you know a
[1:18:02] person can gather together all sorts of
[1:18:04] quotes and they can gather together all
[1:18:05] their scriptures and everything else but
[1:18:07] where it comes down to it is where does
[1:18:09] all of this get placed where's the
[1:18:11] presence of God within it all where does
[1:18:13] it all get balanced out
[1:18:15] foreign
[1:18:17] here's the difference
[1:18:19] gather unto me so Moses is going and
[1:18:22] Moses is bringing these 70 elders in
[1:18:26] but who's he following not Jethro's
[1:18:28] voice
[1:18:30] God's voice
[1:18:31] and it looks like he's bringing him to
[1:18:33] himself he's not he's Gathering them
[1:18:36] unto the Lord
[1:18:40] seventy men of the Elders of Israel whom
[1:18:43] thou knowest to be the Elders of the
[1:18:46] people and officers over them and bring
[1:18:49] them unto the Tabernacle the
[1:18:50] congregation that they may stand there
[1:18:53] with thee
[1:18:55] and I will come down and talk with thee
[1:18:59] there and I will take of the spirit
[1:19:02] which is upon thee and I will put it
[1:19:05] upon them and they shall bear the burden
[1:19:09] of the people with thee that thou bear
[1:19:11] it not alone
[1:19:14] you know what God was saying I will
[1:19:16] vindicate my word
[1:19:19] I was not saying away with order but
[1:19:22] what God was said I will vindicate my
[1:19:26] order
[1:19:27] in my time my choosing
[1:19:33] you realize even before they got the
[1:19:34] Holy Ghost they were already going to
[1:19:36] choose somebody else you know Judas is
[1:19:38] not with us no more uh so we got to
[1:19:40] choose somebody you know and so the
[1:19:42] Bible says the lot fell on the thighs
[1:19:45] like brother bam said that was man's
[1:19:47] Choice Paul was God's choice
[1:19:50] big difference right
[1:19:52] Matthias was minestrone brother say you
[1:19:54] don't read anything else about him but
[1:19:56] yet one thing was sure what was
[1:19:57] important he got the Holy Ghost
[1:20:00] right but he wasn't he wasn't used of
[1:20:05] God the way that the rest of them
[1:20:07] thought it ought to be but you see what
[1:20:10] it was it's kind of hard to know the
[1:20:12] program of God when you're outside
[1:20:13] looking in you've got to get into it and
[1:20:17] mainly the program of God get in you and
[1:20:20] when the program of God get inside of
[1:20:22] you then you know God's program by a
[1:20:25] personal experience oh yeah you can
[1:20:27] witness it out here the Lord Jesus told
[1:20:30] them in the Book of Luke he said your
[1:20:31] Witnesses this day but even though they
[1:20:34] were Witnesses of the supernatural
[1:20:36] reality of the resurrected power of the
[1:20:39] word but yet they themselves still had
[1:20:41] to go to the upper room and be born of a
[1:20:44] spirit of almighty God where that they
[1:20:46] would become Witnesses of that Living
[1:20:49] God
[1:20:54] we learn a very valuable lesson here
[1:21:00] seek the will of God
[1:21:02] not simple
[1:21:06] and you must have faith it's God's will
[1:21:10] because whatever has been revealed to be
[1:21:12] God's will
[1:21:13] you're going to be tested on it
[1:21:17] sometimes you're going to be testing on
[1:21:19] it and feel like it's not
[1:21:24] that's why the Precious Precious reality
[1:21:29] of when God Reveals His will there's
[1:21:32] something where you have given of your
[1:21:34] heart and you are submitted to that then
[1:21:37] you say Lord I don't understand this it
[1:21:40] looks like it's all going haywire but
[1:21:42] Lord this is what you said
[1:21:49] sometimes it takes a little bit for a
[1:21:51] person to come to that and where they
[1:21:53] themselves will settle down you know to
[1:21:55] wear that hey everything itself
[1:21:57] everything ain't going to go just peachy
[1:22:00] clean
[1:22:02] there's going to be tests and trials all
[1:22:05] sorts of things going to come out
[1:22:09] timing
[1:22:10] timing timing timing timing timing
[1:22:13] timing's everything in
[1:22:17] so not only got to be God's way so you
[1:22:19] could look at Jethro compared to this in
[1:22:22] numbers and say well what's the
[1:22:23] difference one key thing God's way
[1:22:26] God's timing
[1:22:28] even though maybe the ordering in the
[1:22:30] structure what's wrong with men of Truth
[1:22:32] nothing that's a wonderful thing what's
[1:22:34] wrong with selecting men who hate
[1:22:35] covenants nothing it's wonderful thing
[1:22:38] but it's got to be God's way
[1:22:44] timing timing timing this is where the
[1:22:46] Lord Jesus would mention to us in
[1:22:49] regards to patience over and over
[1:22:51] throughout the scriptures even Paul
[1:22:53] would refer to it the god of of patience
[1:22:55] Jesus would say impatience possess your
[1:22:58] souls in the book of Lamentations
[1:23:00] chapter 3 verse 24 the Lord is my
[1:23:03] portion saith my soul therefore will I
[1:23:05] hope in him the Lord is good unto them
[1:23:08] that wait for him to the soul that
[1:23:10] seeketh him it is good that a man should
[1:23:13] both hope and quietly wait for the
[1:23:16] Salvation of the Lord psalms 27 14 wait
[1:23:20] on the Lord be of good church now you
[1:23:22] know what if all these scriptures here
[1:23:24] we could go on and on if verse says wait
[1:23:26] on the Lord that means there's going to
[1:23:28] be times you're going to be waiting
[1:23:30] it means there's going to be times where
[1:23:32] the impatient part about us is going to
[1:23:35] be tested
[1:23:36] or let's say our patience is going to be
[1:23:38] tested
[1:23:39] but this is where the admonition of the
[1:23:42] word now you reckon that David was
[1:23:44] writing this right here just so you know
[1:23:46] sitting in the Ivory Towers and saying
[1:23:48] let me see what be good what be good
[1:23:49] words to a song hmm
[1:23:52] what be a good tune here let me try to
[1:23:53] get a new you know a new song I got to
[1:23:56] make sure the words rhyme no David was
[1:23:58] writing this by experience
[1:24:00] wait on the Lord
[1:24:04] David knew what he was to wait on the
[1:24:06] Lord and He also knew what it was not to
[1:24:09] wait on the Lord
[1:24:12] he's riding by experience wait on the
[1:24:15] Lord so notice and be of good courage
[1:24:18] why how are we of good Courage by by
[1:24:21] staying in his presence by feasting on
[1:24:24] his word by taking in from him he gives
[1:24:26] you an eye the strength and the
[1:24:28] expectancy like how the prophet would
[1:24:30] tell us in the dramatization of Abraham
[1:24:33] when Abraham himself and they would
[1:24:35] store up the diapers when God had told
[1:24:37] them you're going to have a child and
[1:24:39] yet here for 25 years God let the
[1:24:42] promise linger
[1:24:44] right a lot of things listen to me a lot
[1:24:48] of things came up in Abraham's life that
[1:24:51] the devil could have pointed out and
[1:24:52] said aha what about year two aha what
[1:24:55] about year five aha what about year
[1:24:58] seven do you realize all of those things
[1:25:00] the devil could have continually tried
[1:25:03] to put before him why where did Abraham
[1:25:05] get his strength he got his strength
[1:25:08] because he judged him faithful who made
[1:25:12] the promise
[1:25:14] Abraham rested I didn't call myself out
[1:25:17] that wasn't some kind of voice that just
[1:25:20] struck my head that wasn't my
[1:25:22] imagination that was the Lord God
[1:25:25] [Applause]
[1:25:26] [Music]
[1:25:27] [Applause]
[1:25:32] be of good courage
[1:25:35] and he shall strengthen
[1:25:37] thine heart
[1:25:39] wait
[1:25:40] I see
[1:25:42] on the Lord
[1:25:44] the Bible would tell us they did wait on
[1:25:45] the Lord Isaiah 40 31 they that wait on
[1:25:48] the Lord shall re-new their strength
[1:25:57] God moves us through the Redemptive
[1:25:59] stages of Grace
[1:26:01] it deals with a person's heart
[1:26:04] he convicts your life
[1:26:07] to where you recognize
[1:26:09] I'm undone
[1:26:12] I need a savior
[1:26:14] and he presents himself that I am your
[1:26:18] savior
[1:26:19] he lets you know I've already saved you
[1:26:22] but he wants you to recognize what he
[1:26:25] has already done for you and acknowledge
[1:26:29] that and say Lord forgive me of my sins
[1:26:32] Lord I'm a sinner I'm in need of your
[1:26:36] grace
[1:26:38] and then you walk on with him
[1:26:40] and the Bible says blessed are they that
[1:26:42] do hunger and thirst after righteousness
[1:26:43] for they shall be filled and so you
[1:26:46] begin to walk on feeding on that word
[1:26:49] taking in the word that God deals with
[1:26:51] your heart let this go uh watch this
[1:26:53] right here and and he's dealing with
[1:26:55] your heart upon things but you see the
[1:26:58] hunger The Thirst it has to be for him
[1:27:00] you know think about this when you're
[1:27:02] hungry what do you do do you go to bed
[1:27:04] when you're hungry I don't
[1:27:06] the worst thing to do when you're hungry
[1:27:08] is go walk through the grocery store
[1:27:10] now you all know that just from I mean
[1:27:12] they teach you that in school
[1:27:14] you don't ever do that you come out more
[1:27:16] junk in that cart you need than anything
[1:27:21] well it's a hard one you know I mean
[1:27:23] unless you're going to Sam's Club and
[1:27:24] they got all the samples out then you
[1:27:25] are right
[1:27:28] but if you're hungry blessed are they
[1:27:31] that do Hunger what should you do if
[1:27:33] you're hungry
[1:27:34] eat
[1:27:37] eat the right things
[1:27:40] Lord I want the Holy Ghost so that eat
[1:27:42] the right things
[1:27:45] Lord God I I'm so thirsty Lord Ben make
[1:27:48] sure you're drinking the right things
[1:27:53] impatience possess you your souls your
[1:27:56] patience is that what Lord this is your
[1:27:58] word I want to be one with you Lord I
[1:28:01] want your word Lord just so and fill my
[1:28:03] life and as you keep moving keep walking
[1:28:05] patience is is to know that God has
[1:28:09] never failed God will not fail God will
[1:28:13] perform his word and you keep moving
[1:28:15] along and watch how God will bring the
[1:28:18] final transformation and Captain a
[1:28:21] capping of Redemptive Grace and then you
[1:28:24] find your patience it'll just continue
[1:28:26] to grow it continues to grow
[1:28:31] foreign
[1:28:34] this is a time and an hour we need we we
[1:28:37] should be getting more patient and less
[1:28:39] impatient
[1:28:40] the world is different
[1:28:42] the world wants instant now
[1:28:47] that's the way the world is I know I
[1:28:49] hadn't graduated high school yet I know
[1:28:51] that I know I'm not talking about me I
[1:28:53] know I ain't graduated high school yet
[1:28:55] but I want a job that pays six figures
[1:29:00] okay so if we just get the right
[1:29:01] president and maybe they'll McDonald's
[1:29:03] will end up paying that amount of money
[1:29:07] some of you'll get that tomorrow
[1:29:14] that was free
[1:29:17] but you understand what I'm saying
[1:29:19] it's look out of time when this is an
[1:29:23] hour
[1:29:24] that requires patience
[1:29:28] and it's a time when people are becoming
[1:29:30] more impatient
[1:29:33] you realize it's its influences friends
[1:29:36] it's you say well it's demons I agree
[1:29:39] it's demons but remember there before
[1:29:41] demons could influence the people there
[1:29:45] in the days of Noah to get them in the
[1:29:48] spirit of destruction there had to be
[1:29:51] vessels channels that them demons could
[1:29:55] project themselves through that's why
[1:29:57] the Bible says in Genesis 6 that the
[1:30:00] Earth was filled with violence through
[1:30:03] them
[1:30:04] it was people who opened themselves up
[1:30:09] if I can say it this way to the spirits
[1:30:12] the media
[1:30:13] in that hour
[1:30:15] it was the Instagram of that hour the
[1:30:18] Facebook of that hour I tell you what
[1:30:20] what you feed on you will become
[1:30:24] what you feed on will dominate your life
[1:30:26] do you realize there are spirits there
[1:30:29] is not something that is spirit-free I
[1:30:32] know there's a lot of nonsense about
[1:30:33] fat-free sugar-free and this right here
[1:30:35] but there is nothing that is spirit-free
[1:30:40] are you with me
[1:30:41] it's the discernment of what spirit is
[1:30:45] motivating this it ought to be something
[1:30:47] in your life that you look on it is this
[1:30:50] drawing me closer to the Lord or is it
[1:30:53] causing a greater distance
[1:30:57] I kind of like that because there's
[1:30:59] nothing spirit-free that's the same
[1:31:01] thing with God's word
[1:31:04] when we can be in the channel of the
[1:31:06] Holy Spirit then the honor the glory the
[1:31:09] power that's in that word is poured out
[1:31:12] upon God's people God don't want a
[1:31:15] spirit-free word he don't want to fat
[1:31:17] free sugar-free word God likes a word
[1:31:20] that is come with power and
[1:31:22] demonstration
[1:31:24] Hallelujah it has the ability to take a
[1:31:28] life and live that life and break sins
[1:31:31] change who is that it takes more than a
[1:31:34] letter it takes the god of the word to
[1:31:37] come and vindicate his word
[1:31:39] [Applause]
[1:31:43] but you find Israel
[1:31:49] God
[1:31:52] had given them theocracy
[1:31:57] his leadership
[1:32:00] but Israel wanted
[1:32:02] democracy
[1:32:08] God gave him theocracy
[1:32:11] they wanted democracy
[1:32:15] come on somebody
[1:32:18] the Bible said Samuel told him all the
[1:32:20] words
[1:32:21] in first Samuel 18
[1:32:24] of Unto the people that asked of him a
[1:32:26] king
[1:32:30] and they themselves he told them what
[1:32:32] manner of the king it's going to Reign
[1:32:35] Over You
[1:32:36] he let him know how I'm not going to
[1:32:39] read it today because you can read it
[1:32:41] when you get home he let him know and I
[1:32:43] think this is what's very key
[1:32:45] the very first phrase I'll read here in
[1:32:47] this scripture he will
[1:32:50] take your sons
[1:32:52] and a point for himself
[1:32:55] for his chariots and to be his Horsemen
[1:32:59] and some shall run before his church you
[1:33:01] go on and on his his his
[1:33:06] what's the difference listen was it that
[1:33:10] Israel did not come together and go
[1:33:12] fight battles in the past you know you
[1:33:15] can't fight battles in disarray
[1:33:17] come on somebody you can't fight battles
[1:33:20] with divisions
[1:33:23] so if you can't fight it with divisions
[1:33:25] you've got to know where you're supposed
[1:33:28] to be standing win that battle you got
[1:33:30] to know what ground you're supposed to
[1:33:32] cover come on somebody it wasn't that
[1:33:34] Israel you know was just a you know a
[1:33:36] bunch of people just walking around like
[1:33:37] well I'll tell you God's just leading us
[1:33:39] and they're walking around like they
[1:33:41] ain't got no direction in their life not
[1:33:43] so
[1:33:44] they had Direction in their life
[1:33:47] there was Direction there was captains
[1:33:50] there was Elders there was these things
[1:33:52] there was chariots there was all of that
[1:33:54] but the difference is is that God had
[1:33:57] orchestrated it
[1:34:00] not man
[1:34:04] but by their choice now it's the
[1:34:07] orchestration of man
[1:34:12] this is the difference like we looked at
[1:34:13] between Moses
[1:34:15] Moses father-in-law and the Lord
[1:34:19] the difference was the presence of the
[1:34:21] Lord
[1:34:22] right that's that's the great difference
[1:34:25] here and you see it just like how's that
[1:34:27] God would go on through Samuel he would
[1:34:29] warn the people
[1:34:30] and even after you know the thing that's
[1:34:33] different let me just point out to this
[1:34:36] this is different
[1:34:39] when you look at the difference between
[1:34:40] the theocracy and the Democracy the
[1:34:43] difference is with the theocracy it's
[1:34:46] God stirring the hearts of the people
[1:34:50] when it came time to build the
[1:34:52] Tabernacle in the wilderness Moses never
[1:34:55] had to tell one person now you give up
[1:34:57] your honest stones
[1:34:58] now you give up the gold hairs now you
[1:35:01] spin this together you make these
[1:35:03] garments you give it he never had to say
[1:35:04] that it's simply the vision was made
[1:35:08] known and those who had Onyx Stones
[1:35:11] surrendered they caught the will of God
[1:35:14] for their life nobody had to tell them
[1:35:17] because God through an open Vision had
[1:35:20] spoke lip to ear
[1:35:22] they were all here in the same sermon
[1:35:25] but yet God was speaking lip to ear
[1:35:30] ning it was the same way it was
[1:35:32] in the times you know when Cyrus rose up
[1:35:35] Cyrus began you know to call on them and
[1:35:38] different ones through the spirit of the
[1:35:40] Lord raised up to go back and then even
[1:35:42] in a time of Nehemiah you find that even
[1:35:44] when it came time for the offerings to
[1:35:46] be gathered for that of Solomon's Temple
[1:35:49] who was that that stirred that up
[1:35:52] God did it
[1:35:54] it wasn't something that had to be
[1:35:56] demanded
[1:35:58] it was God that did it
[1:36:01] it was God's leading
[1:36:04] you realize the prince of God
[1:36:08] is what balak
[1:36:11] and Balaam were blinded too
[1:36:15] you couldn't have put one finger
[1:36:17] listen to me now
[1:36:19] their sacrifice was perfectly in order
[1:36:24] perfectly in order
[1:36:26] fundamental to the Core
[1:36:29] but do you realize what was the
[1:36:32] difference
[1:36:33] Balaam although being a prophet he could
[1:36:37] not recognize the presence of God with
[1:36:42] those people
[1:36:44] couldn't recognize that and you realize
[1:36:47] how the devil did it he called him up
[1:36:49] and said here come look at the Honda
[1:36:51] parts because he even changed the
[1:36:53] position oh wait a minute you're just
[1:36:54] not seeing him in the ride you're not
[1:36:56] seeing them in the right light you need
[1:36:57] to come over here to my house I mean you
[1:36:59] need to come over here to the angle and
[1:37:01] let me give you a little bit of scoop
[1:37:02] well I give you a little bit of scoop
[1:37:03] about things of course I've got quotes
[1:37:04] to go with it as well when I do that
[1:37:06] you'll see the back Parts I tell you
[1:37:09] right now that kind of a spirit is an
[1:37:10] anointing from hell that is not the
[1:37:12] anointing of almighty God
[1:37:15] come on somebody it is not for the
[1:37:17] people of God to pick apart the people
[1:37:19] of God vultures pick apart one another
[1:37:23] not equals of God
[1:37:25] Eagles ought to encourage other eagles
[1:37:28] [Applause]
[1:37:31] Oh Glory but you see what was missing
[1:37:34] the presence of God
[1:37:36] they were fundamental fundamental
[1:37:39] everything is just fundamentally right
[1:37:43] everything is just exactly right we've
[1:37:47] got all of this just right but you're
[1:37:50] missing one thing
[1:37:51] what's that the presence of the Lord and
[1:37:56] that means everything
[1:38:02] here's Samuel let him know
[1:38:05] laughs but the people in verse 19 they
[1:38:09] refuse to obey the voice of Samuel and
[1:38:11] they said nay but we will have a king
[1:38:13] over us you know I often wonder when
[1:38:15] Samuel was actually delivering this you
[1:38:17] know God told him he hearken to him and
[1:38:19] he said but I want you to protest
[1:38:20] solemnly I I wonder if when Samuel you
[1:38:23] know the presence of God coming down and
[1:38:25] Samuel was just ministering there and
[1:38:27] protesting Solomon I wonder if there's
[1:38:29] parts of it where he could see that
[1:38:31] maybe some of them was almost like a
[1:38:33] gripper they were almost moved in a
[1:38:36] certain way and here he is he just all
[1:38:37] of a sudden you know moves in that
[1:38:39] channel Lord here's one right here Lord
[1:38:40] God they look like they're moving and
[1:38:42] about that time then all of a sudden
[1:38:44] they would just pull back from it but
[1:38:46] you see as Samuel he was going and
[1:38:48] approaching this not as some formality
[1:38:51] he was taking this as though there could
[1:38:54] actually be a turning around
[1:38:59] but they said nay but we're going to
[1:39:01] have a king over us
[1:39:03] that we may also be like all the nations
[1:39:05] and that our King May judge us
[1:39:10] so well they wanted the Judgment of man
[1:39:13] they didn't want the Judgment of God
[1:39:17] and go out before us and fight our
[1:39:20] battles
[1:39:24] now they didn't want to stop being
[1:39:25] called God's people
[1:39:27] they still wanted to be called God's
[1:39:29] people but they wanted to do their own
[1:39:32] thing
[1:39:34] they wanted their own way
[1:39:37] are you with me
[1:39:38] they still wanted you yeah we you know
[1:39:41] we still want Miracles we still want
[1:39:43] manifestations we still want all those
[1:39:45] things and we still want the priests to
[1:39:47] go out before us but we just want the
[1:39:49] king himself to lead us out we we just
[1:39:52] we we still you know we love you Samuel
[1:39:54] there's nothing that that has been done
[1:39:56] that's been wrong you know but we just
[1:39:58] want a king who's one of us you know to
[1:40:00] lead us but they didn't recognize what
[1:40:03] they were doing
[1:40:04] do you realize friends that even as you
[1:40:07] and I we come here and we sit here in
[1:40:10] this place that God has given us do you
[1:40:12] realize who comes down service after
[1:40:15] service and deals with our hearts
[1:40:18] who is it that guides and directs the
[1:40:21] services and what's to be brought and
[1:40:23] wants to be said within that time he's
[1:40:25] doing that
[1:40:27] that's not something that a man puts
[1:40:29] together
[1:40:30] just because a man has a study program
[1:40:32] don't mean he's got a gift in his life
[1:40:35] it's going to be a gift there that
[1:40:37] surrendered to the Holy Ghost
[1:40:40] Hallelujah
[1:40:42] so it would see him within it how did it
[1:40:44] would come down and that same God that
[1:40:46] will deal with our hearts let me tell
[1:40:47] you something it ought to be something
[1:40:48] within our hearts not to pattern after
[1:40:51] the things of the world
[1:40:53] we want to live a life that's holy unto
[1:40:57] God at all times
[1:41:01] to where it's not just one day out of
[1:41:04] the week we come to the house of God and
[1:41:06] sense his presence but it ought to be
[1:41:08] something as you evaluate your life is
[1:41:11] his presence abiding in my life day
[1:41:15] after day is my life a reflection of the
[1:41:19] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:41:21] let me tell you something you can work
[1:41:22] and have your workplace filled with
[1:41:24] people they pack a Bible just like you
[1:41:28] and let's say even they can pack a King
[1:41:30] James Bible just like you
[1:41:33] but there's got to be a difference they
[1:41:35] can come right here to this church just
[1:41:37] like you but there's got to be a
[1:41:38] difference there's one thing that's a
[1:41:40] difference and you might say well I
[1:41:42] believe God sent a prophet the Muslims
[1:41:44] believe in a prophet right a prophet is
[1:41:47] not what makes the difference
[1:41:50] what makes the difference is is the
[1:41:53] presence of almighty God
[1:41:58] Hallelujah to really recognize what God
[1:42:01] has done in the ministry in this hour is
[1:42:04] to make you and I aware of the presence
[1:42:07] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:42:12] to every single day when we're outside
[1:42:15] it ought to be a testimon do you realize
[1:42:17] all sorts of things can be presented
[1:42:20] your way certain things to try to draw
[1:42:22] you and try to attract you I'm telling
[1:42:24] you friends this is why the new birth
[1:42:26] it's not an option that you're born
[1:42:28] again you must be born again
[1:42:34] it's to be patterned after the Lord
[1:42:37] Jesus Christ
[1:42:39] to love him and say well you know I just
[1:42:41] I just love him you know it's my savior
[1:42:43] but he did more than just a savior from
[1:42:46] your sin he wants to cleanse you he
[1:42:49] wants to fill you with himself he wants
[1:42:52] to be the Lord of your life
[1:42:57] but the way so many times it is it's
[1:43:00] Lord I'll show up and do my duty I'll do
[1:43:03] my time
[1:43:05] and then on the other days of the week
[1:43:07] do what I want to do
[1:43:09] listen friends I've got to be honest
[1:43:11] with you that's a pattern Bound for hell
[1:43:16] you want to make it you do not want to
[1:43:19] go to that place you do not even want to
[1:43:21] be left here
[1:43:23] in the tribulation time
[1:43:25] you don't want to be left here do you
[1:43:27] realize when he appears
[1:43:30] even in his descent even into Israel and
[1:43:33] then as he would appear do you realize
[1:43:35] even the foolish virgin will be wailing
[1:43:38] at that time
[1:43:41] when he descends back from that marriage
[1:43:43] supper of the Lamb
[1:43:44] coming then with the armies then and
[1:43:46] Armageddon they will well and even the
[1:43:49] rest of the re of the living creation
[1:43:52] who has been tormented
[1:43:54] while God's visiting Israel
[1:43:56] they will cry for the rocks to hide them
[1:44:01] hide us from the Wrath
[1:44:04] of the Lamb
[1:44:06] it's a time now to run to the mercy of
[1:44:08] the Lamb
[1:44:11] let me tell you friends it don't matter
[1:44:12] how long you've known about this message
[1:44:14] here no matter how long you've come to
[1:44:16] this church the question still comes
[1:44:17] down have you received the Holy Ghost
[1:44:19] since you believed
[1:44:21] it don't matter how long and how much
[1:44:23] you know you can be around the message
[1:44:25] you can talk God all you want you can
[1:44:27] talk quotes and everything else but do
[1:44:29] you have the presence of God packing in
[1:44:32] your life is it Vindicated in your life
[1:44:36] so often friends we've got things all
[1:44:39] around us where people can hand out
[1:44:40] quotes and have no Divine Vindication in
[1:44:44] their life
[1:44:45] no backing in their life whatsoever of
[1:44:48] the presence of almighty God I'll tell
[1:44:51] you right now that's a sorry situation
[1:44:52] to be in but you don't have to stay that
[1:44:55] way you can actually have a power where
[1:44:57] you can have joy down in your soul you
[1:44:59] can actually have joy and enjoy serving
[1:45:02] God
[1:45:03] [Applause]
[1:45:06] y'all with me
[1:45:11] let's go like this
[1:45:13] it'll help me
[1:45:16] is to be transformed
[1:45:19] you see Israel wants to be a separated
[1:45:21] people from the world
[1:45:23] they were not to look like the world
[1:45:24] they were not to act like the world
[1:45:27] they were to be a separated people
[1:45:31] that's why over and over there's times
[1:45:34] Corrections needed the standard of the
[1:45:37] word is needed to be brought forth
[1:45:38] whether it's music whatever it might be
[1:45:41] whether it's it and there has to be a
[1:45:43] standard of the word when it's always
[1:45:45] set before and let me tell you something
[1:45:46] Holiness itself it ought to be Holiness
[1:45:48] on the outside and it ought to be a
[1:45:50] Holiness to match it on the inside it
[1:45:53] ought to be Holiness on the inside and
[1:45:55] Holiness on the outside
[1:45:57] a pattern
[1:45:58] a pattern A Life That's patterned
[1:46:02] after the word
[1:46:15] may God help us
[1:46:20] that was the one difference
[1:46:22] what was the one difference between
[1:46:23] Israel
[1:46:25] and the rest of the Nations
[1:46:27] the presence of God
[1:46:29] you take the prince of God away from
[1:46:31] Israel and they were like any other
[1:46:34] Nation
[1:46:36] you take the prince of God away from
[1:46:37] Samson he's like any other man
[1:46:42] the difference is the presence of
[1:46:45] almighty God
[1:46:49] this is why everything that we do
[1:46:56] God would tell you tell Samuel hearken
[1:46:58] to their voice
[1:47:03] hearken to him go ahead make the king
[1:47:12] this is where that
[1:47:15] we look at anything you know it's
[1:47:17] important sometimes
[1:47:20] is it really where it really takes
[1:47:23] the patience and the grace of God
[1:47:26] sometimes to
[1:47:29] know a person's heart
[1:47:32] a lot of times what I'm saying is that
[1:47:34] we don't all together know
[1:47:36] know a person's heart
[1:47:38] but you know how it is with your wife
[1:47:40] between you your wife and your husband
[1:47:41] if you're not married
[1:47:43] you just kind of have to take a word for
[1:47:45] it it would be like your mom or dad or
[1:47:47] if you're raised by your grandparents
[1:47:49] they get to know you
[1:47:51] you make mistakes
[1:47:54] there's things that in the midst of it
[1:47:57] maybe you've said something a little
[1:47:58] wrong
[1:48:00] and they can tell you
[1:48:02] I think you said that wrong
[1:48:05] but when they know your heart
[1:48:07] that's what makes a difference
[1:48:10] are you with me
[1:48:12] so when you when you look at this
[1:48:16] It's always important
[1:48:19] in knowing a motive and objective on
[1:48:21] things
[1:48:23] because the motive and objective
[1:48:25] that's what's going to be the
[1:48:27] determinant you know you and I can look
[1:48:28] at things
[1:48:31] well I'll just tell you I'll just tell
[1:48:33] you for myself
[1:48:35] I've learned to quit being like a Quick
[1:48:36] Draw McGraw
[1:48:38] pray for more
[1:48:39] you know God's God's taught me you know
[1:48:42] just shut your mouth and pray about it
[1:48:44] and wait
[1:48:46] sorry to be so plain but probably some
[1:48:48] of you got that I mean
[1:48:50] didn't have no acronyms to text that out
[1:48:52] to you
[1:48:55] because you know what I've come to find
[1:48:56] I need God's grace a whole lot too
[1:48:59] oh yeah I need his grace a whole lot too
[1:49:02] and sometimes when it is you know God
[1:49:04] has a way that's oh my it's Unique God
[1:49:06] can allow you to go through some of the
[1:49:08] same things and then you have a little
[1:49:10] bit more sympathy and empathy you can
[1:49:13] think why in the world that person act
[1:49:14] this way huh just wait just wait now you
[1:49:17] understand not that that's condoned but
[1:49:20] you'll have a little bit more
[1:49:21] understanding and Grace
[1:49:25] anybody want to be pastor
[1:49:29] in the Bible
[1:49:35] the first thing
[1:49:37] when we look at what we're ever going to
[1:49:39] do
[1:49:40] you look at it but the REM says the
[1:49:42] first thing I always want to try to find
[1:49:44] out
[1:49:46] is whether it's God's will or not to do
[1:49:48] a certain thing
[1:49:51] amen so first of all it's it's looking
[1:49:53] in his word
[1:49:56] is it God's will
[1:49:58] you give ourselves to God's will
[1:50:00] sometimes we're waiting on things for
[1:50:02] God
[1:50:03] to guide and direct us you know in his
[1:50:05] will
[1:50:07] sometimes I know that for myself and I
[1:50:10] no doubt each of you find that same way
[1:50:12] sometimes brother Brown says you know he
[1:50:15] says sometimes people feel like the
[1:50:16] pastor is a little slow on doing things
[1:50:18] he said he's the ox of the team
[1:50:20] the ox of the team got four feet on the
[1:50:23] ground
[1:50:25] he's not the prophet
[1:50:27] people still want a prophet
[1:50:30] we need what God has sent but God also
[1:50:34] has Ox to have four feet on the ground
[1:50:38] come on somebody
[1:50:40] and you can look in the heavenlies but
[1:50:42] the ox on the ground says yeah but I'm
[1:50:46] seeing what you're doing
[1:50:47] so you can't be flying as high as I
[1:50:49] think you're flying or you think you're
[1:50:50] flying
[1:50:52] they preach better Samuel preach
[1:50:55] Brothers Samuel
[1:50:56] why because the ox is looking and what
[1:50:59] is going on
[1:51:02] I mean
[1:51:03] that's when I you know the ox is doing
[1:51:05] it fourthly it's a slow guy you don't
[1:51:07] want an ox to run a race
[1:51:10] is that right but remember an ox is what
[1:51:13] they used on the Oregon Trail
[1:51:17] they didn't use horses horses won't
[1:51:20] endure
[1:51:22] listen what are you trying to say I'm
[1:51:24] not trying to say anything I'm just
[1:51:25] saying what you're giving me to say
[1:51:27] and Ox of the team would just hold it
[1:51:29] together because when they get to that
[1:51:32] land they've got to plow
[1:51:34] they're going to be plowing some hard
[1:51:36] ground and an ox is needed
[1:51:40] the event says a pastor is patient and
[1:51:42] believe me I remind him Lord you said
[1:51:44] I'm patient
[1:51:46] you said that lays Within Me Lord Lord
[1:51:48] help me praise the Lord
[1:51:51] that's the truth it's not it's not
[1:51:53] automatic it's see God makes known
[1:51:55] what's in us and then we say Lord help
[1:51:58] me
[1:51:59] help me help me what is that that's you
[1:52:02] bring forth what you put in
[1:52:06] Glory
[1:52:07] but the Bible says he said this is what
[1:52:10] I told Brother Collins he said I always
[1:52:11] want to know if it's God's will or not
[1:52:15] and then I test
[1:52:17] my motive towards doing it brother Brian
[1:52:20] he covers this beautiful power
[1:52:22] transformation many other places I just
[1:52:23] I like this particular one
[1:52:25] as well I like all of them but I just
[1:52:27] this is so it's just real simple then I
[1:52:30] test my motive towards doing it
[1:52:33] if I have no selfishness
[1:52:38] nothing
[1:52:39] and I know it's God's will and I'm doing
[1:52:44] it for that purpose because it's his
[1:52:48] will
[1:52:49] he won't fail you then
[1:52:53] so with no selfishness
[1:52:56] I know it's God's will and I'm doing it
[1:52:59] because it's God's will then he won't
[1:53:01] fail
[1:53:02] because why it's him
[1:53:05] making known his will giving us the
[1:53:10] strength to fulfill his will
[1:53:14] but if history look at this this is
[1:53:16] powerful but if it's his will
[1:53:20] and you got a selfish motive in it
[1:53:24] it's just the same as it not being his
[1:53:26] will that's right because it won't
[1:53:32] you mean something can be God's will
[1:53:36] yeah
[1:53:39] he said not being his will
[1:53:41] yeah when when when it's a selfish
[1:53:45] motive
[1:53:47] behind it
[1:53:50] this is where even hearts
[1:53:53] or motives and objectives
[1:53:56] in everything that we do
[1:53:59] you don't take for example
[1:54:02] how many times you hear Brother Brahm
[1:54:04] say
[1:54:05] the Joneses paint their steps green
[1:54:10] so it just
[1:54:12] Green's a new color
[1:54:14] It's The End
[1:54:16] God I have my steps painted green
[1:54:19] listen you telling me something's wrong
[1:54:21] with green paint not a bit
[1:54:23] are you telling me something's wrong
[1:54:24] with having my stuff's painted not a bit
[1:54:27] what's motivating you to do it
[1:54:33] are you telling me it's wrong for me to
[1:54:35] have you know my child's birthday party
[1:54:38] at
[1:54:40] Pizza whatever
[1:54:41] no
[1:54:43] what's your motive in doing it
[1:54:45] well I just wanted to have a good time
[1:54:46] or is it you're wanting to compete
[1:54:49] with the rest of everybody else at the
[1:54:53] school
[1:54:54] you know what as well as I know
[1:54:56] you've seen people that compete with one
[1:54:58] another in weddings
[1:55:00] come on somebody preach with me they
[1:55:03] want to outdo somebody else man and they
[1:55:05] don't care they're willing to go in debt
[1:55:06] it would be more important to invest on
[1:55:09] becoming one and you walk down the aisle
[1:55:12] Barefoot and he walked down the aisle
[1:55:14] with bibbed overhauls on and you walk
[1:55:16] out debt free and you'll be one in heart
[1:55:18] than to be in debt and Out of Love
[1:55:22] because it is not the greatness and the
[1:55:25] magnitude of the wedding oh did you see
[1:55:27] that dress nothing wrong with all of
[1:55:29] that but sometimes it's such the
[1:55:31] deadness of things please don't
[1:55:32] misunderstand me but sometimes the
[1:55:35] emphasis is placed on the wrong things
[1:55:40] and people are vexed anxious
[1:55:44] and yet there's nothing wrong if you can
[1:55:46] afford it and and you're doing it for
[1:55:47] the right reasons nothing wrong
[1:55:54] it's like radio broadcast
[1:55:58] that brother Monica seems to do a radio
[1:55:59] broadcast he used to didn't he I know of
[1:56:02] many Souls one out there is that right
[1:56:03] sister Caroline
[1:56:06] brother Stephen abali who was here
[1:56:07] you're a member of the Stephen from
[1:56:08] Uganda
[1:56:09] and you remember the testimony that he
[1:56:11] gave
[1:56:12] the amount of souls that's what's
[1:56:14] stirring in Uganda right now
[1:56:16] because
[1:56:18] the radio broadcast
[1:56:20] where they're going on
[1:56:22] they play a little bit of the message
[1:56:24] and then they come behind it and they
[1:56:26] preach
[1:56:28] there has been churches
[1:56:31] the the Baptist churches and other
[1:56:33] churches they can't keep up with it
[1:56:35] brother Stephen keeps sending me stuff
[1:56:38] they can't keep up with the souls that's
[1:56:41] coming out
[1:56:43] now I want you to think of this what if
[1:56:47] now I know there is
[1:56:49] I know there I know I know there is I
[1:56:51] know there's people that he'll bless God
[1:56:53] brother Branham was against radio
[1:56:54] broadcast really
[1:56:56] perhaps you need to read in a message a
[1:56:58] little bit more
[1:57:01] animals against that all that
[1:57:03] broadcasting stuff you need to read in
[1:57:05] the message a little bit more
[1:57:07] brother Branham himself supported he
[1:57:10] said I support radio broadcast he said I
[1:57:14] support A.A Allen's I said he went
[1:57:16] through a list of them and brother
[1:57:17] Branham would tell the people hey hey he
[1:57:19] said did you hear Brother Neville
[1:57:21] preached here the other day he said my
[1:57:24] goodness he said I'll tell you what you
[1:57:25] do the next time he said when brother
[1:57:27] Neville's getting ready to come on you
[1:57:29] get all your neighbors and bring them in
[1:57:30] your house and you sit down and turn on
[1:57:32] that broadcast so they can hear Brother
[1:57:34] Neville
[1:57:36] so if we take the attitude that radio
[1:57:40] broadcast is denominationalism
[1:57:44] then somehow we're missing the mark But
[1:57:46] Sam are you saying you're going to start
[1:57:47] a radio broadcast no because God ain't
[1:57:50] led me to do that
[1:57:53] what I'm trying to put out here is
[1:57:56] there's certain things that lay in the
[1:57:57] message that what the difference is look
[1:58:00] it don't matter if you have a radio
[1:58:01] broadcaster you don't have a radio
[1:58:03] broadcast that is not a qualification
[1:58:05] for the rapture
[1:58:07] come on somebody
[1:58:09] no more than if you take the offering at
[1:58:12] the beginning of the service or the end
[1:58:13] of the service that has nothing to do
[1:58:15] with the rapture
[1:58:16] come on somebody
[1:58:18] but you see this right here with these
[1:58:20] things the way brother Brown could go
[1:58:22] through it look at listen to brother
[1:58:23] Branham if you listen to what he said
[1:58:25] brother Ben there's many messages
[1:58:26] brother Brandon will give to us and say
[1:58:28] Hey I just heard this the other day on
[1:58:30] the radio broadcast brother Branham was
[1:58:32] not an isolationist
[1:58:35] are you hearing me he was one who
[1:58:38] believed in separation unto God but he
[1:58:41] said over and over I'm not an
[1:58:43] isolationist you see there's a
[1:58:46] difference between isolationism and
[1:58:49] separate
[1:58:51] isolationism draws apart us us and no
[1:58:55] more
[1:58:56] but separation says I'm separated unto
[1:58:59] the power of God and we can walk among
[1:59:03] people and we have hearts for people to
[1:59:06] know that that same power of God that's
[1:59:08] moving in our life all it takes is it to
[1:59:11] break on their life that's it
[1:59:15] amen that's what he said that's not my
[1:59:18] words those are quotes
[1:59:19] so it's separate unto the Lord even how
[1:59:23] many times that brother Branham would go
[1:59:25] on and on with these with the different
[1:59:27] things even with as I said with the
[1:59:29] radio broadcast and all that and even
[1:59:30] brother Brown just here just the other
[1:59:32] morning listen to the very beginning of
[1:59:34] sudden secret going away from the church
[1:59:35] now if you want on these quotes I've got
[1:59:37] them but if you look at sudden Seeker
[1:59:38] going away from the church brother
[1:59:40] Brandon even says on the opening part of
[1:59:41] that message he said now Lord he said
[1:59:43] there's some people that's unable to
[1:59:44] make it to the house of God this morning
[1:59:46] he said no doubt they're going to read
[1:59:48] their Bibles and they will listen to the
[1:59:51] ministers that will be on the radio that
[1:59:54] will encourage them and edify them
[1:59:58] what is everything to be done for the
[2:00:01] edification of the body
[2:00:05] if a specialist sung if a song or a
[2:00:09] testimony whatever it is it's to be done
[2:00:12] for the edification
[2:00:17] this is where
[2:00:19] motives and objectives are so
[2:00:23] needed to be tested
[2:00:27] and to say Lord
[2:00:29] let me just Reserve to you
[2:00:35] hello let me just Reserve to you
[2:00:39] because you remember brother Branham got
[2:00:40] into place one time where he was
[2:00:42] criticizing
[2:00:44] hey Alan
[2:00:48] criticized
[2:00:53] it was men
[2:00:55] word made flesh India trip
[2:00:58] and brother Brown says I want you to
[2:00:59] pray for me I've developed a critical
[2:01:01] spirit
[2:01:02] then at the end of the message he calls
[2:01:04] that critical spirit he said remember I
[2:01:06] want you to pray for me I've developed a
[2:01:07] selfish spirit
[2:01:10] he said I'm wanting to go around and
[2:01:12] tell everybody where they're wrong
[2:01:14] and he said that it's not that's wrong
[2:01:16] that's wrong he said that's not for me
[2:01:18] to do it they're God's men it's up to
[2:01:21] God
[2:01:24] I'm thankful for those examples in the
[2:01:27] word of God
[2:01:29] you see within when you look at how that
[2:01:31] Samuel would even come uh just I'm done
[2:01:34] when Samuel would come we'll just stop
[2:01:36] there
[2:01:38] when Samuel would come even before the
[2:01:40] people he'd let them know
[2:01:41] okay
[2:01:43] this is what you want
[2:01:45] okay but he could tell him this is how
[2:01:48] things are going to be
[2:01:49] how could he tell him how things are
[2:01:51] going to be
[2:01:52] because of the manner of the king
[2:01:54] he could tell him the manner of the
[2:01:56] Kingdom
[2:01:57] same way Daniel by inspiration could
[2:01:59] tell them
[2:02:00] and you see it's just like this this
[2:02:02] morning
[2:02:03] by the attitude that you take towards
[2:02:05] the word of God
[2:02:06] there's a lot can be said what will
[2:02:09] transpire in your life even From This
[2:02:12] Moment forward
[2:02:14] maybe this is the first time you you're
[2:02:16] hearing the gospel preached but if you
[2:02:18] and your heart is a hunger within your
[2:02:20] heart that attitude that you take to it
[2:02:22] say Lord
[2:02:23] what I'm hearing this morning I want to
[2:02:26] give my life to you
[2:02:28] I want to surrender my life
[2:02:33] and then as we hear it
[2:02:34] Lord I want I want to walk that
[2:02:37] separated walk
[2:02:39] it's not just because you know the
[2:02:41] preaching of the word we shouldn't dress
[2:02:42] this way we should do that but Lord
[2:02:45] want that on the inside of me
[2:02:48] where it's a difference on the inside of
[2:02:51] me because I want to please you this is
[2:02:54] your word that's been delivered this
[2:02:56] ain't brother Samuel's thoughts
[2:02:58] this is your word I want to line up with
[2:03:02] your word
[2:03:03] I want to line up with you I want to
[2:03:05] please you I want your presence I want
[2:03:08] my life across my heart to be welcome
[2:03:13] welcome welcome welcome welcome
[2:03:18] that's what I want Lord
[2:03:20] and you welcome him in continuing to
[2:03:23] welcome him in even in all of our lives
[2:03:27] Lord Jesus
[2:03:30] I want to walk pleasing
[2:03:32] my motives my objectives I need the word
[2:03:36] to check to discern I also need his I
[2:03:40] need his strength to wait
[2:03:45] to be patient
[2:03:49] sometimes you can feel pressures of this
[2:03:51] Abraham fell pressures
[2:03:54] Abraham you ought to be doing you can
[2:03:55] feel precious but remember
[2:03:57] make sure that you're not acting out of
[2:04:00] pressure
[2:04:03] act in obedience to his leading
[2:04:07] because if you act out of pressure
[2:04:09] imagine this if I acted out of pressure
[2:04:11] from one person in here
[2:04:14] guess what that opens it opens up a can
[2:04:16] of worms
[2:04:18] to then be open to everybody
[2:04:24] but if I'm open to one person and I
[2:04:26] don't mean to hurt your feelings but
[2:04:28] I'll take his leading any day
[2:04:30] over your leadings
[2:04:33] because I've got to give an account not
[2:04:35] only for my soul I've got to give an
[2:04:38] account for every soul in here
[2:04:42] sometimes there's times where we've got
[2:04:44] to wait on things
[2:04:46] wait on things to get just right and
[2:04:49] these things to be put in the right
[2:04:51] place
[2:04:52] but you know what God is faithful
[2:04:55] I've seen that time and time again God
[2:04:58] will always provide for himself
[2:05:03] don't you love him
[2:05:05] that's the truth friends he'll always
[2:05:07] provide for himself
[2:05:09] he's faithful
[2:05:11] don't let the things of the world if
[2:05:14] they've got a grip on your heart
[2:05:16] let God just loosen you
[2:05:19] let him have control
[2:05:21] you're a young person or old person give
[2:05:24] yourself to the Lord I mean really give
[2:05:26] yourself
[2:05:27] don't just come to the church give
[2:05:29] yourself to God
[2:05:31] feed on his word
[2:05:33] drink from him and talk to him ask him
[2:05:37] say Lord I I want to know you more Lord
[2:05:41] will you speak more to me speak to My
[2:05:44] Heart Lord Jesus
[2:05:46] not just the in church he wants to talk
[2:05:48] to you out of church
[2:05:50] he wants to be your lord he wants to be
[2:05:54] your buddy
[2:05:56] he wants to be your friend
[2:05:59] he wants to be the one that's the go-to
[2:06:02] person
[2:06:04] he wants to be the one that
[2:06:08] is your BFF your best friend forever
[2:06:11] except he's eternal
[2:06:15] he's your best friend you could ever
[2:06:17] have he stick closer than a brother
[2:06:21] glory be to God
[2:06:23] faithful
[2:06:26] let him be your king
[2:06:28] let him guide you
[2:06:31] he'll be faithful
[2:06:33] he is you love him
[2:06:39] let's bow our heads in a word of Prayer
[2:06:41] I wonder as we prayed here this morning
[2:06:43] is there any that you would like to
[2:06:46] maybe you don't you have men serving the
[2:06:48] lord
[2:06:48] maybe you'd like to accept the Lord
[2:06:50] Jesus Christ your savior
[2:06:52] is there someone here this morning that
[2:06:54] would like to you would raise your hand
[2:06:55] from your heart and say I want to accept
[2:06:58] that Lord Jesus you talked about this
[2:07:00] morning
[2:07:01] I want to accept him I want to receive
[2:07:03] his pardoning grace for my sins
[2:07:07] I want to accept him
[2:07:10] what he's already done for me if you do
[2:07:12] it just slip your hand up right now
[2:07:16] he'll meet you right there in your heart
[2:07:18] where he's already been dealing with you
[2:07:19] he'll meet you right there
[2:07:25] there'd be someone here this morning
[2:07:28] God bless that hand back here
[2:07:30] God bless you son God bless you maybe
[2:07:33] there's somebody else back here young
[2:07:35] man
[2:07:36] someone say
[2:07:39] I want that
[2:07:42] presence of God I want a holy ghost in
[2:07:45] my life that's what I need God bless
[2:07:47] your hand
[2:07:48] God bless your hands
[2:07:52] now listen you raised your hands his
[2:07:56] presence dealt with your heart and
[2:07:58] remember he didn't play and he's not
[2:08:00] playing with your emotions
[2:08:02] I don't it don't matter how many times
[2:08:04] that you may have your heart may have
[2:08:06] been inclined
[2:08:07] but I want you to set your heart on it
[2:08:09] right now
[2:08:10] that he made the promise with you in
[2:08:12] mind
[2:08:14] for as many as the Lord Our God shall
[2:08:17] call
[2:08:19] you're part of that word
[2:08:22] that promise if you've followed within
[2:08:24] the word you have been baptized in the
[2:08:27] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:08:29] being identified in his burial
[2:08:32] identified with your sacrifice
[2:08:37] because with that comes repentance
[2:08:40] and you're surrendering your life and
[2:08:43] you're letting God the greatest is our
[2:08:45] Lord cleansing my life Lord I want to be
[2:08:48] filled then let me tell you that promise
[2:08:50] is for you this morning
[2:08:54] couldn't erased your hand if he hadn't
[2:08:55] dealt with your heart
[2:08:58] in an age where an age is so indifferent
[2:09:00] and so hard but yet when your hand being
[2:09:03] lifted up to the Lord there's a heart
[2:09:05] behind that that the Holy Ghost has
[2:09:07] touched this morning
[2:09:09] and I want you to know this I stand here
[2:09:11] as a messenger
[2:09:13] [Music]
[2:09:15] of that Holy Ghost
[2:09:17] [Music]
[2:09:18] his desire is for you
[2:09:21] [Music]
[2:09:23] and you you believe in the Holy Ghost is
[2:09:26] for me
[2:09:27] and you make preparations like Abraham
[2:09:30] and Sarah did you make preparations to
[2:09:32] receive it you go ahead and you start
[2:09:34] taking that word into your heart that is
[2:09:37] my promise he made the promise of the
[2:09:40] Holy Ghost with me in mind if there
[2:09:42] wasn't nobody else in this earth he
[2:09:45] himself would have come down to redeem
[2:09:47] me because I belong to him and I'm
[2:09:50] giving my heart you concentrate right
[2:09:53] now in your heart that everything else
[2:09:55] there's nothing that matters I must have
[2:09:59] his presence that Holy Spirit dwelling
[2:10:03] in the center of my life I need that
[2:10:06] more than anything else in the world
[2:10:10] you set your heart that way
[2:10:13] and you watch him come and do for you
[2:10:16] you may not feel one little thing but
[2:10:19] you set your heart to it and you watch
[2:10:21] there's a manifestation of his presence
[2:10:24] that'll move right and it'll bring the
[2:10:26] change in your life nobody will have to
[2:10:29] know that you've been changed and
[2:10:31] transformed and that there's a fire on
[2:10:33] the inside of your life but you won't
[2:10:35] only be a clean person you'll be a
[2:10:38] person who's on fire
[2:10:40] because the flame will burn inside of
[2:10:42] you
[2:10:42] [Music]
[2:10:45] I wonder how many before we go to prayer
[2:10:49] would say Lord
[2:10:50] I want to refill him
[2:10:53] of the Holy Ghost
[2:10:55] I want a rededication Lord a refilling
[2:10:59] [Music]
[2:11:02] if there's any patterns or anything
[2:11:03] anything in at all Lord
[2:11:07] burning out Lord
[2:11:10] there's one Focus I've got that's you I
[2:11:12] want to please you more than anything
[2:11:14] [Music]
[2:11:15] as we go to the Lord in prayer
[2:11:18] we're going to pray together
[2:11:20] and his sweet presence that's here right
[2:11:23] now that's been walking up and down the
[2:11:25] aisles and moving up and down in the
[2:11:27] hearts of your of his people that same
[2:11:30] God
[2:11:31] it's right here to move in with the
[2:11:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost he's here to
[2:11:36] move in and sanctifying power he's here
[2:11:39] to move in in the refilling of the Holy
[2:11:41] Spirit right now
[2:11:43] and as we go to prayer you believe that
[2:11:45] and you make ready to receive that
[2:11:48] [Music]
[2:11:49] let's pray
[2:11:51] Lord Jesus
[2:11:52] [Music]
[2:11:54] father
[2:11:55] though we've come and we've set in a
[2:11:58] building that's located at a physical
[2:12:01] location
[2:12:02] off of Lake Breeze Road
[2:12:05] but father we've moved from this
[2:12:07] location
[2:12:09] your God
[2:12:11] Under The Canopy of your divine presence
[2:12:15] Lord Jesus you have come and you have
[2:12:18] ministered your word to deal with our
[2:12:21] hearts
[2:12:22] it's truth through the foolishness of
[2:12:25] preaching you chose
[2:12:27] that way and that order Lord God
[2:12:31] and father it's your presence not the
[2:12:34] word so much as it is your presence Lord
[2:12:37] that Lord would move those words into a
[2:12:41] place to where it discerns Lord where it
[2:12:44] breaks chains the Lord God where it
[2:12:47] dismantles holds where it lifts Faith
[2:12:51] Lord where it Lord God gives Grace Lord
[2:12:54] where father Lord it moves Lord hearts
[2:12:59] Lord God
[2:13:01] towards you
[2:13:02] it's you Lord
[2:13:04] and now Lord these hands that swim up
[2:13:09] but God
[2:13:12] from that little boy back there Lord God
[2:13:15] erased his hand
[2:13:17] he won't accept you as his savior he
[2:13:20] said I want that Jesus I want him to be
