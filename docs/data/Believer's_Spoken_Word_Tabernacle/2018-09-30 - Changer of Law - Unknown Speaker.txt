these days the Lord should let us meet that would not Pat again and that is what we are praying for so let us rest assured that we have a blessed assurance god bless all of you amen I pray also that I pray for me that the Lord will continue to strengthen me as we go wrong amen shall we just be on our feet at this moment and have a word of Prayer before we read our scriptures dear Lord we thank you again this morning what we are here in your presence not because of what we were so much much to do but that just the grease or law that you've bestowed or not before the foundation of the world therefore father we pray now let this all worship and I'll create this money be a subsidy Nightside we pray O God that you will come again to speak your word to rise more your children I hear desiring your father to feed on your word and we know Oh God every man will be able to turn the pages of the scriptures and read them my lord take your leadership Oh father to bring what you want your people

Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen shall we just turn our scriptures to Hebrews chapter 4 and we reinvest 8 to 11 Hebrews chapter 4 yeah the state for if Jesus had given them rest then will he not afterward have spoken of another day Mary Manette therefore arrest to the people of God for he that is entered into his rest he also had seized from his own works as God did from his let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest hidden man fall after the same example of unbelief Romans chapter 8 verse 2 to 4 Romans 8 verse 2 for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh now the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit may the Lord that is blessing to the reading of his word amen shall we take our seat well I'm happy again to be in the house of God I agree with David he said I was glad when they asked me to go to the house of God because I surely believe that identity realize that in the house of God there is Liberty Alleluia in the house of God there is forgiveness of sin in the house of God is power of gosselin to heal your sickness in the house of God everything is at our disposal amen so this morning we want to talk on a topic change of law it's very unusual but that is what is on my heart changer of law we change the situation's Amen when we are talking about the changer of law then of I believe strongly that we are referring to the one who made the law amen you see many times Mundek law and other men come and change that law is that it you remember that there are so many laws especially in the political arenas a president who you know Institute alone upon a nation and another one will come and take the same law and make it useless you mean what I wanna say what I mean not quite long we heard about something called they say Johnson's amendment bill or something like what has happened to die not here in America but all over the world in where I came from there was a president who built a presidential palace because we didn't have one and when he built it he named the place golden jubilee house golden jubilee house but the other party that opposes this party that built the presidential palace they didn't like it so they came to power and change the name of the palace and call it flat star house fortunately for the party dubbed the presidential palace they have read more an election and they have come back to change the same thing again to the goodness of Nestle order so there is confusion here confusion day so when we are talking about the change of law we are not talking about a man but we are talking about our God that we worship he is only one that make a law and no man can change it if there has to be a change to take him himself to make the change so when we are talking about a change of law we are not talking about any man on earth we are talking about our God hallelujah we know that he is able to change situations God is able to change the atmosphere God is able to change the ration of the wind right now he is able to change the skies hallelujah God for that matter don't need anybody's advice to do whatever he desired to do amen and we know that in a beginning he given laws to his people to live by now when we even talk about law what is the meaning of law law or the law or a law we know that every law goes with punishment because I profess that every law without punishment is vain so when we talk about law we are talking about a written or understood rule that consents behavior from people and pair up there are consequences because law is made for man to live by rate ma when we talk about commandment it has almost the same mean is the act of commanded or exercising authority to somebody press something upon you it's a commandment becomes a law if I have power right now in America and I say nobody should eat ice-cream again if you dare go and eat icecream you'll be in trouble isn't it yes sir if I do that I know that many people cannot stay by it yes because many people here will not miss the ice cream for a day last year my groceries are happy to be in a is it oh my I think Toledo and some of the brothers took me to a place I've forgotten the name of the play but they introduced me to one of the ladies over there say oh these are a brother a missionary from Africa Anna the umma was so happy to see me and I fight it excited you know telling me asking me so many things about Africa and then she turn around and ask me what is what is there what is there oh my he put his something where I forgotten how to put it he said what is is that some like what is they they're horrible things of seeing you know in America since I came well and I said the horrible thing I've seen that women smoke more than me that's what I noticed and then she laughed because she too and as she asked me what is the funniest thing I saw were the funniest thing is that almost every American like ice cream in a so I know that if I easy to allure right now to change that I am bringing a bed into some people and alluvia so brother does just by the way now we know that our God give law to his people to liberate but they were not able to live by that law amen but that law people work on them and killed because they were not justified buried in a but don't knew that it was time to impose that on them he didn't put it to kill them he had his reason of doing that I understand what we are meaning so because they were not justified by that law it became death to them because after the forest did every law there is penalty to reach you understand that you know you remember that in the Bible one time on a Sabbath day there was a man who did it honor that that's how bad the Bible that I shall win he I'm sorry he went on a third to break sticks and people saw him and he told Moses Moses look at what is happening the man didn't honor this a lot Moses said I'll bring him and they put him somewhere I said law Moses stood Allah let me wait and hear from God because before I'll take decision and so by captain David Moses stood I put that kill him because God said we should kill him and they killed a man because he broke the law hallelujah he broke the law now we remember also that the same law was made for righteousness but they could not lead by rate if instrument children were taken to the elders to be stoned to death he will have a child in those days who don't want to respect you who don't want to listen to your advice because the Bible says that we should train up then the way they should go so that when they'll grow they will not depart from it so even have a stubborn child a stiff neck a child the law says that take that child to the others and you do justice to his flesh can we read it quickly in the that is cutting deuteronomy chapter 21 yeah datura me chapter 21 verse 18 yeah he says if a man had a stubborn and a rebellious son which will not obey the voice of the Father or the voice of his mother and that when they have just in him will not hear him unto them then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him and bring him out unto the elders of this of his City and on to the gate of his place and they shall say unto the elders of his City this our son is stubborn and rebellious he will not obey our voice he is a glutton and a drunkard and all the men of his City shall stone him with poles that he died so shalt thou put evil away from among you and all Israel shall hear and fear that was a condition of a day under the law today who will be able to do that will you have what it takes to take your son to the police station and tell the police shoot my son because his problem it doesn't want to listen to my advice can you do that today you can you do that yeah I'm certainly I know that you can do that because it is not applicable now MA there is a place also that the Bible say that even bastard children don't enter into cognition for ten generations but today we go about preaching to all the people directing them to Jesus Christ we don't ask them are you a bastard or not do we do that No because there has been a change of law the one that met that law has come to change the law in fact when you read the message I think kress of God Christ is the mission of God revealed there's a play that a prophet made a statement he said God didn't come to change the law but I came to magnify it yes sir God came to magnify the law but a procedure is what we are talking about now any he change it for our good even because the pastor is the pastor would not enter into the congregation of God for pain generations there you are talking about so many hundred of years hallelujah but today we have the golden scripture that is reflecting in a life of all the children of God that for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him will not perish but have everlasting life amen and amen so because of this condition whereby man could not lead by all the law could not make the person righteous grace was provided hallelujah grace was provided for us for the atonement and that was the introduction of the Lamb of God to wash our sins away so therefore what the law could not do that grace has come to do it the introduction of grace have come to do it all brother and my sister so the giver of the law came and change it whether you believe in that or not ask Roma's is saying here right now yes Romans 8 verse 2 again he says for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death amen because the spirit of life was in Christ Jesus and the spirit which was in the law was dead that is how when you break the law you die amen so it means the law couldn't produce life to the people but price has come to introduce life to us oh praise God for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh okay it was weak the law could not penetrate our flesh in fact its profits our our flesh the Lord met our flesh we saw stubborn you understand it could not penetrate okay so it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh so what the law could not do on our flesh the spirit of life which is in Christ Jesus has come to do it oh my that direction Asst of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit notice how we are spiritual people sitting here in the presence of God this morning we are not living on our flesh even though we live in this flash we are not living on the flesh but we live on the Spirit of Christ which has given us a new life amen are you following carefully let me go something from spiritual adoption quickly then I'll come back he says later this morning and a tango that we are in this morning cast our eyes away from self-righteousness or something that we have done I do not plead for law I cannot be judged by the law or because I'm lawless no one kept the law there cool not keep the law and other can you save yourself now that can you heal yourself and if the law by your own manmad will you wanted to project that to the plan then there is only one thing required by the law if you fail that is justice you understand what would be if you want to live by the law then the only thing that is required when you fail is justice and justice is to be condemned and died forever it requires total annihilation because he that breaks one point of the law is guilty of all the law so you must die but God as we look at God's law and we look at God's justice who dares to Jesus who present God's love not law not justice but in him was met the fulfillment of both law and justice he said this is my beloved son no more self-made stuff but listen to your tutor that is a reason Peter who say thou are the Christ the Son of the Living God law and justice was met in Christ and if God loved to the human race amen he ramada there was a time that I said how did it come to destroy the law but I came to fulfill the law so the professor that law and justice was met in Jesus Christ hallelujah let's continue now we took this test out of Deuteronomy it's a Greek word I am quoting okay which has a compound meaning or it means to loss that's a Greek word autonomy and that is just what got us to different laws and one of them is a law of death and the other one is a law of life so this morning I asked you a person which of this laws are you entitled to the law of that or the law of life I certainly know your choice and I know you certainly know my choice he says to follow him and serve him and worship Him as life to reject him as death there is two laws in God now one of those laws was met recognized to the world at Messina God gave the law to Moses and Israel not that the law can help them but the law only pointed out to them that they were sinners and that's what the Lord does to us that they were sinners until data they didn't know what sin was to be hot a law there cannot be a law without a penalty hello is not a law without penalty so therefore the transgression of the law is sin and the witness of sin is death so therefore until God made them a law there was no transgression upon to them if there is no law here that said you can't run over 20 miles an hour then you can do that but when there is a law says you can't do it then there is a law and a penalty behind it you know so it took Moses to the mountain and gave him the law to his people and when you realize that the law could not help them he took his own son Jesus Christ to another mountain and demonstrated life meaning he took their law and nail it on the cross are the Bible talks about because the law could not produce righteousness to us so therefore a time came that God has to come down and change it hallelujah for you and I Oh gracious god amen and amen you know you know the mean of Sinai ponds pause or a 20 thing something that can pierce your flesh like when you go to the hospital nobody want injection because the injection is more or less a tone she is your flesh nobody liked it and that the mean of scenario so the lobby kept at all in the life of the people they were also they were always suffering by the law they were all almost dying by the law it could not produce righteousness for them but God meant boot for his people God did not mean evil for his people he meant good always for his people so he made a way for us to come to him not by our merit not by what we have done about what he has done for us he made an email hallelujah let's read quickly galatians chapter chapter 2 yes galatians chapter 2 we already in verse 19 for I through the law I am dead to the law that I might live unto God I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not i but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me hallelujah I do not frustrate the grace of God for if righteousness come by the law then Christ is dead in vain if righteousness come by the law then Christ is dead in vain but righteousness didn't come by the law but righteousness and by the death of Jesus Christ which was Grace for his people that is why we cherish all that the Lord has done for us under the grease but greater not mean disgrace grace means acknowledgment of what he was supposed to do but you are not able to do and someone has done it for you that is grace amen you have a butt load of so many piece you are not able to carry it somebody's all my brother my sister let me give her half a hand okay and he grabbed the tips off from your head and put it on his back so will you will you just say that okay he would have carried mine and load from my head they have to carry me also at your back it can work that way so grace that don't mean this grace hallelujah grace means the righteousness of God that will be made manifest in your life amen and amen I with me I am quoting from the message called law it's another beautiful type of the believer today coming believing lay his hands upon Christ and there at the altar or in his seat wherever he meets Christ lay hands upon him at Calvary and realizing that all that agony and suffering belongs to you and in your soul deep regrets and sorrows comes with your hands upon him you are changed hallelujah you will never be the same it is taking the condemnation away from you because you have laid your hands upon Jesus Christ he under the law being a shadow the man went away justified but still with the same desire because the animals blood could not wash your sins away ok it was just a shadow of everything that was coming to happen so as he lay his hands upon the animal and when the animals was being killed you know the shake of the animal you know it's reflected in the in the in the flesh or the body of the sinner so the property Cena after it is done like that he will go justified at that moment but still having that desire of sin upon him so he could not be justified even though you're Daniel sacrifice but still remain a sinner but uncovering when Christ was being killed and you and I and all the chosen generations when we lay our hands upon Jesus Christ our guilt went away from us amen amen because he's pudding for us we could not go by the law so he brought in that precious grace and he took our position and he we took his position hallelujah so we are changed you will never be the same brother sister and I stuck in the condemnation away from you amen yes sir let us say he was caught committing adultery on a server it was the love could not change that person because that Londo Havasu in a gallon didn't help what it takes to bring a shady life to the sinner but the love that has what it takes to bring a change upon the sinners life what the love of God that was slain from the foundation of the world Oh gracious God have mercy upon your children amen and amen so Paul SATA how do not frustrate the grace of God for if righteousness come by the law then Christ is dead in vain don't let us frustrated agrees brother sister I am serious this morning don't let us frustrate the grace because frustration is not good in our lives you know that frustration I know that sometimes when somebody want to frustrate reality you are you flora you are ready to slap someone because somebody's flow stretching you so what would you like if you don't love to be frustrated why would you like to frustrate the grace of God and maybe you don't know where sometimes frustrate the Spirit of God and I'm going to discuss with you anything that you need not to be angry or annoying they were annoying you are frustrating the spirit anything little thing then you flare up you are ready to box when your brother step on you at all you are you flutter you are frustrating the Spirit of God hallelujah when it is time to come to church you know that the soul in you feet ask this flash feed on pizza are this flesh feet on earth or do you call it hamburger or cheeseburger or chicken sandwich now this fresh feed on those that when it is time for you to go you don't want waste a time because you don't want to frustrate the desire of of your tongue we don't want to frustrate your anger because when I'm hungry I'm hungry let me go take a bite I'm hungry you don't want to frustrate that but when it is time for your soul also to be fed you want to frustrate the spirit you sit at home you don't want to come to church do you know that the frustration of the spirit or the grace of God you know frustrating the spirit because brother/sister it has come to a turn they'll show up not like that if you are not here there is no change can you imagine if I decide not to come to check today my brother decide not to come my sister desire not to compare us all of us we desire not to come to church how old are some well preach amen do you think it'd be reasonable for brass Amma to come and stand behind a pulpit and there is no soul on the benches and someone will come and see breasts somewhere stunning and the law said and Allah said and Allah said who is there to say Amen to it so what happened we are frustrating the grace of God my brother and sister look we should not reach the point to think that because we are message believers and that is all there is something more to that if we have mustard believers we must fulfill the word he said we should also set the Assembly of ourselves together I want somebody to tell me the meaning of the scripture here are mistaken he said we should not forsake the assembling of ourselves together meaning every meeting be we must make sure that we are in church will you say Amen here well if you don't like what I'm saying just be quiet but if you love what I'm saying say Amen to it because I don't want you to prostrate the Holy Spirit it's in you you have the Holy Ghost in you but if you don't check on you can frustrate it well I know I know and let me be sincere that I know that sometimes the condition of your work some situations in your screws I know that will not emit you yes I know that but what about those who have nothing nothing at all and it was just get up in this area or today oh oh today I think I'm tired you are tired to come to church then you must be equally tired to go to the Pizza Hut you must be equally tired to go to Bob Evans you must be equally tired to go to Cracker Barrell or whatever you call it yes sir because the soul also must be fed which is very important than living the flesh one hallelujah Paul say that I will not prostrate the grace of God for if righteousness come by the law then Christ died in vain but I tell God that Jesus Christ didn't die in vain he died to manifest his power in you and in our Oh glory be to his holy name amen and amen yes sir let me call this from God shows in place of worship I with me now he says there was also two covenants given to the people we are going to speak of it this morning we are speaking on it he says one of them was given to Adam on condition if you do this and don't do that but Darla was broken Adam and Eve brought that in the Garden of Eden then God made the second covenant and give that to Abraham and the law was unconditional it isn't what you have done or what you will do he said I've already done it hallelujah not what you do or not what you are going to do not what you ought to do but what God had already done for us we only acknowledge and appreciate it amen and amen Oh hallelujah he said that is grace that is the law of life okay the first law was the law of death but this one is the law of life do not forget that is that God did that for Agra or Abraham and his feet after him that is all Abraham seats and the Bible said it amen but the law of God was through Christ which was a branch royal seat that by grace or Israel he saved that is all that is in Christ he is saved and that is God's second covenant praised be the name of our God hallelujah so if it is this way then why was somebody think that it is his horn weird something that is able to do it is greasy that is the reason why in the time of Martin Luther when the log pick him up to speak against the thing that was going on in the room and color change that that people need to understand that you have to pay for your sins they get huge sums of money so that they can want you to live in sin because after all I have paid for my sins perhaps of about 1 million dollars in my pocket I just give to the church a church take it the year ahead of me I have the right to do whatever I want to do was it just travel if you don't have money they have to do penance you have to touch on your budget to pay for your C's is that whatever say so therefore God told Martin Luther he said speak to the people they just shall live by faith and a lot drug damn from that bondage we all know what happened during that time until he came to a child they wanted to kill the man Martin Luther but because it was the chosen one at that time God protected him from all those allowed and today somebody can tell me that you need to punish your body before you be accepted somebody would tell me they need to pay monies before it can be accepted no brother no sister hallelujah it has already been done what the law was to make us do and we were not able to do it the Lord has done it for us and it's already done we are only manifesting what he did brother sister remember that we is not to be this way we used not to be this way and we've been in churches and you call us up appreciate but you know that you are not able to live a Christian life until you came to the knowledge of the truth it's one team call yourself a Christian and I know nothing knowing that knowledge of truth you can call yourself a Christian when you are not a Christian but above all say that and the truth shall make you free the truth shall make you free so the only thing that'll make you free is when you come to the knowledge of the truth and what is the truth the prophets say that when we are talking about the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost horny ghost in the revealed Word of God in your day but today many people claim to be Holy Ghost filled people and they are not able to come in terms with a message then tell them to act themself what kind of Holy Ghost is in them because if it is the real Holy Ghost of God that is in you you will embrace the message of the hour because the message is what opened our eyes to the grace of God that we are talking about it right now praised be the name of our God he says now that was the law I'm sorry the law of death was the commandment given on Mount Sinai we told my dad he was a sinner and to transgress God's law he died but there is no salvation in the law it was only a policeman that will put you in jail it had nothing to bring you out with but then he get another law that was at Mount Calvary and I say amen to that well sin was recording Jesus Christ and then the penalty was paid and not with without law but by grace you are saved by the grace of God through predestination of God's foreknowledge of your being so sometimes when when I hear I was discussing with both Summerall this morning but a very good brother oh very good but I've met him before and he claimed he believed the message of this hour why doesn't believe that God seeded you before the foundation of the world that is his problem but if you were not seated before the foundation of the world when when did that take place in our lives wait hallelujah the Bible says in Timothy he says what is he for the foundation of the lost and she and why something is says something me sure it means that M is fixed that nothing can shake it he said the foundation of the Wednesday a shield okay how did this in you they'll not knows those who is not that their Lord is not going to know those who were his is it they're not not those who were hates who is seated before the foundation of the world to be in this time sometimes I can go that he didn't place me in a time of Martin Luther I tell God that I didn't place me in the time of Paul you must also can go the same way because God knew why he placed you in this time because you are the people that can handle the grace of God their way is supposed to be handled so God needed you in this very time amen and amen hallelujah oh my collisions I'm reading it again condition three then say for as many as are of the works of the law are another cache for it is written cursed is everyone that continued not in the office which are written in the book of the law to do them but that no man is justified by the law listening carefully in the sight of God not in a set of men but in the sight of God it is evident for the just shall live by faith so Martin Luther said that I Josh I live by faith they just cannot lead by paying for his or her sins and the law is not of faith but the man that doeth them shall live in them Christ how do we deem us from the curse of the law will you say in a year Christ as we deem us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed is everyone that hung it on the tree that the blessings of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith hallelujah amen amen so Jesus Christ has to go to Calvary to demonstrate his power over since when our behalf oh brother you remember it product easy for him to go to the cross new dramatic turn came the Bible say that he went to the Garden of Gethsemane hallelujah as we demonstrated last Thursday here he was in Akron he was in a trouble because it was time for him to change the law into grace he prayed and prayed and prayed because he had no option he prayed and prayed and prayed for you and I he said Lord father if it be possible let this cup pass over me but not my will but dying hallelujah and so he said lastly say it is finished the salvation plan forgiveness of our sins brutal the spirit of life in Christ Jesus was made finished and he giveth none power for us to be called the sons and daughters of God not what we have done but what he has done praised be the name of our God hallelujah amen and even so the Bible says in Hebrews he says today after so long a time as Curtis said if you hear his voice harden not your heart that Jesus had given them arrest will he not afterward have spoken of another day what is the rest what was the rest the summit what was it the purpose that it just means to rest and the Holy Ghost today in your life is what gives you that rest oh brother we are wrestling today we are resting today in the grace of God not what we have done we have nothing to do with it we didn't pay for anything we didn't do anything about it it is his own wheel we are resting today we are resting today in the person of Christ amen and he says the dispensation changed with Jesus Christ from the Lord grace from wedge or to Grace from something you do to watch something God did hallelujah upon your honor it no upon his merit it changed amen you remember do I still have time rosamma remember one day the Bible says that Jesus Christ was in the temple and lo and behold that were our seats there always to the youngest they held this woman proper proper and brought her before Jesus Christ and they asked Jesus master this woman has been caught in adultery in fact in a very act and according to the law of Moses such a woman should be stoned to death but what do you say why did he go and as Jesus cried out question you know they themself near questions we are always condemning them why should I boil Jesus you have the law why don't you implement it because they have seen that Christ has brought something new that they didn't have the man didn't have what it takes to grab it so they were always confused hallelujah that is why we know they had a law the law tells them there's no God human but then they say no let us go a ciggies as Christ face meanwhile the according visible so now the clergy the holy men they were going to ask them eligible to tell them what they should do about the law can we imagine this so they went and told the desert this man was caught in adultery she wished one head to death then the Bible says that Jesus Christ took on the floor and he started writing something that nobody knew up to today perhaps he was writing I am the one who gave the law to Moses and I say such a woman should be stoned to death now you are asking me what should be done to this woman I am the same one who made Moses on the mountain I have come here with a new thing to change the old one after you wrote that on the floor he straightened himself up now we look at them he said anyone among you who have not seen she first cast the stone and he continued and now I am going to crucify the law on the cross and I will introduce grace of God to bring righteousness to my people [Applause] so before Christ finish writing distant on the floor and he straightened himself up no Pharisee was they again and by the Bible say that they started moving one by one starting from the old man hey so it means let me know do a condom and this woman to die dead himself was not righteous they were not Rachel so it means that there were so many hypocrisy people were healed by people who supposed to be killed you understand it now so none of them were justified by the law even to condemn people by the same law the policy is not and it was with Jesus and the woman alone and Christ asked the woman where are your accusers nobody condemned you it's the new master it's a while now that grounds to condemn you but boo and sin no more how alone so we are talking about grace great doesn't mean that you can continue to live in sin no then you don't have revelation of what the mean of Grace's hallelujah they don't have the wind of it so if they are d'autre I'm surprised at the current the current who make war of the man by the middle of on the on the woman only proud the man was faster like Hussein good and he ran away you understand that is why anything that you do to someone you must make sure that you are doing the right thing but I will you give us romance after sex we are reading all of us are going to read it before we close okay Romans chapter 6 and verse 1 romanced ripped away Chapter six I'm sorry I ready to read with me he's gonna board romance after sex okay let's go is that what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound verse two says God forbid how shall we that are dead to sin little longer they read hallelujah should we continue in sin that grace may abound the bubbles that are good for bigges how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer the ring we have killed see by grace in the flesh but the law could not kill sick you see the word atenas the grace of God which is the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has been able to kill sin in the flesh what the law could not give grace has done it so Paul say that God forbid that he doesn't mean that you are a message believer you believe the message so that is all oh you feel the Holy Ghost so that you can do whatever no it is never like that we bring righteousness out of grace we are here as representations of God hallelujah we have another influence that cannot cope with the system of this present time the environment that we are living in now that is why it were our desire that we should be accepted in the society your faith that you hope now can make you you know have a whole lot of enemies around you because anything that I do you contaminate and not you condiment but that the Spirit of Christ that is in you anything contrary to the Word of God is condemnable we don't condemn the people because the illiberal sin but we condemned sin in the people so the proper to tell you somewhere we say we don't hate the sinner but we love the cinema we hate the same we are here to establish the kingdom of God and that is what we are doing we are not doing it by by our strength but just the grace of God we are doing all this thing by His grace amen one time somebody was asking me a question me God there was a brother in the church who was misbehaving and I was after so many advice he was not you know listened to the advice so what happened was that we have to apply the word and as come kick him from the church and he was confused and so how can we do that so well as the is the word we didn't do it is what is written in a word thanks a lot but the Prophet didn't has communicated anybody from the his church and I asked him were you dealt with it you had a prophet in his church were you dealt with him if nobody is misbehaving there is no need of excommunicating anybody but if somebody's misbehaving then we can do that because great doesn't mean that we can leave anyhow Grace has brought this LC into our body Grace has got righteousness into our body hallelujah Grace has brought holy life into our body and that is what we knew and that's always freedom brother sister before I close do not be discouraged do not be discouraged at all that you believe this message do not be discouraged a poll that pay your faith you are not gonna be accepted in the areas value you found yourself in do not be discouraged because very soon we are going to tend to be judges upon their people on this earth your brother Brahm say that when grace is spawned what is left is what judgment today let us acknowledge that God for that mattias on Jesus Christ took us from where we were and you put us in his condition and he has come into our condition that is what we are able to live as Christians amen that is why anything that we do today brings glory to his holy name the grace of God in us is what is reflecting what is in heaven that is why your life my sister is different from the woman on the street that is why the man living a decent life because grace has done it for us grace has given enough power if a dress has refined us and today we can be bold and happy to look up to the skies and say Lord come now we can look to the skies and see that the halls of heaven they are all ready to accept us now to receive us because what we are doing today is what is influencing them also over there your life and my life we are looking on us hallelujah they are looking on the way the behavior we are putting up on this we are looking down and they are watching us because if we fail the Apostle feel so the Bible say that the prophets of old the apostles and all the saints they are looking on you are we going to fill them I say no no matter how difficult it will be on the way no matter how frustrated if they will be no matter what hardship perhaps who rise on the way let us live on Jesus Christ for he is our warfare general he said it has finished and I'm not sure that that word us judgment manifest in my life you must make sure that it manifests in your life soon and very soon we are going to go away that is what I am thinking about now because everything shows that there's no time left everything shows like we said last Thursday he shall have travail and and the child is born to them we must also travail because as they are preparing to receive the Messiah the Messiah whose Jesus Christ must hide his wife also in the place even that is there today there are a lot of people don't know what time is it but a prophet will ask you says what time is it today I will tell you that it is the time of changing of the body of the believers and we are in a process of the body change oh brother sister I would like you to say Amen here we are in a process of the body change anything that will make the body change is here I say it's here hallelujah as we park today as we park tomorrow one day of these days it will be over and as I always say when we change let me see you die glove change because I will make sure that you see that I've change and I wouldn't need to go and buy delta tickets to fly and come and see where a summer and a check we will not need to go and buy perhaps of American Airlines but as you sit here in Loreen I will be in Ghana and I will see everything that is going on and you do the same brother and sister there is no joy that can surpass that condition there is no liberty that also pass that thatís why to pay our age you let us press on I said let us press on to the price of the high collars of God do not be frustrated do not be discouraged by enemies in this world for the society will not welcome us but we are here to establish the kingdom of God and that is what we are doing now god bless all of you god sentinel of you god for all of you with his power and glory anything that will be a hindrance on your way the lost click on 1208 and i think i will be disappointed to the appointment in your way the law should take care of it and attain that to suggest you to be worried to be touchy to be lukewarm to be lazy then law should take it away from your life then I will fill you with all the glories of heaven shallow [Applause] sit amen God is so good kidney you know brother branham he makes a statement in the message of grace and he says you know there's two things he said that I'm gotten after that people disagree with me so much on and he said first of all he said it's on the doctrine of predestination and he said the second thing that they don't like is the message of grace that I'm minister see those two things go hand in hand and I realize that within this hour what God has restored back to us that election was not something that was new this message did not bring new things to us it uncovered what was already laying here we're restored back to the original faith and with that the those things that God seen that in here that were hidden and reserved as nuggets for this hour such as to be able to look at Abraham and Sarah and to see that change it is not wrote in the scripture by words but yet it is written there in their lives and those are nuggets that even God would bring out in this hour thinking of Rebecca and Esther and all of those things they were only making known of what types you know there were shadows in order to have a shadow there must be substance that made a shadow and to this morning I'm looking at the substance I am of that substance David was a type in part of his life of Christ not everything David did was Christ but that tight in only spoke of the true substance that would come and then to see in this hour all the shadows in order to be a shadow there must be a substance to make a shadow and so seeing that how that Christ would come preeminent in his bride body it is the substance of all the shadows its Christ in bright form that same Lord Jesus now manifests within our life then they're wonderful you know friends the Bible says very clearly it says david says all let us worship him in the beauty of holiness and that holiness is not our our works is not our righteousness it is his holiness the very opening of the book of Romans says that he raised him from the grave by the spirit of holiness see he fulfilled the law you with me he fulfilled that because it's his life within you and I how could you stand when the Bible says that the Holy Ghost he will bring conviction to our lives is that right he brings conviction from the inside so then how how could it be that you could say Father forgive me I didn't mean to say that I didn't mean to entertain that I did how could that be because there's been a desire that's been raised up by the Spirit of Christ on the inside God sees the desire is that right that is the real spirit and beauty of holiness because my if we're standing here this morning on our own merits we're in trouble we are in big trouble because the rapture itself will not be by merits the rapture is simply by walking in obedience to the grace that he has unfolded and when that moment comes he just as he did for Abraham he will move on the scene enrapturing grace it's all him you know the Bible says like this look in the scripture I just just want to drop these few things John sometimes you know brother Stephen of Bali and I we were fellowshipping about some of these things because sometimes the things that are spoken and expressed sometimes they can bring if those words aren't broke down they can bring trouble and when you look at things we speak of the three stages of grace and I think I may have mentioned this on Sunday we look at things sometimes and we look at it in terms of steps as though it's steps were making it's not steps were making it's the work that he starts in us and he deepens in our life so it's not me coming from this point but remember that inner veil is Christ coming upon the throne of our heart so it's not us moving it's us yielding and he moves deeper so when the scripture says let us labor to enter into his rest it's not my I gotta get distant I gotta get this and I gotta go no no it wasn't that even when you look in the condition of Buddy Robinson in the field it wasn't because he got down on his knees and I'm gonna get this I'm gonna do this and I it wasn't that it was this here when that came to that place God moved into depth its surrendering so the whole labor you know the whole labor it's us it's our will it's our will but no no wonder Paul could say you bleep all the spirit-filled no wonder Paul could say oh I protest by your rejoicing that I die daily in Christ isn't that wonderful God's grace to you and I that real righteousness on the inside where it's not our efforts it's our yielding you see your efforts it will condemn you but why are you looking to what he has already done as I think that was a tremendous statement that was made grace is to acknowledge what you cannot do but that he has already done that is powerful the grace of Almighty God oh my and one of these moments as brother Daniel said we are going to be changed by the grace of God I ask you who put the RAM on the mountain did Abraham put him there did Abraham didn't put him there no el Abraham did was walk in obedience to what God had made no and when Abraham come even into that place where he was ready to take his own son's life according to what God had asked his hand was in the air brother Bram says the buzzers inside were going off what are you gonna tell Sarah when you get back home what are you gonna do what brother Brown says but Abraham stood in obedience to what God had asked for and the angel of the Lord stayed his hand and then about that time you're the bush hear hear the sound here's the ram the ram has come on the scene that's the rapture the RAM coming on the scene walking in obedience to the word I believe I'm looking in the generation of the RAM amen Abraham was an old man the rapture is for all of God's children [Music] [Applause] grace grace grace unto it aren't you grateful to God my my my my my my how I think God lets tend oh my we have so much to be thankful for so much I know you were blessed amen we have certainly been blessed and we still think God that God allowed brother Daniel to be able to come by our way amen we want to pray for our brother pray for his church his family that God will just continue to to strengthen him I also want to make mention to you but the cadre digs will be here with us this coming Thursday and let's continue to remember the Cruz family in prayer they just we want to hold them up in prayer that God will just strengthen them during this time and then when everything is made known on behalf of the funeral and all those arrangements we will get that out to you as soon as that becomes available to us and my I'm just so thankful for the grace of God aren't you you know there couldn't have been a New Testament if there wasn't a fulfillment of the old now how could we fulfill that how could anybody fulfill the old you know brother mem says God makes a requirement and God makes the requirement where there's nobody else can do it but him and then he steps on the scene oh how wonderful he is amen let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer Lord Jesus we want to say thank you this morning thank you father how you have you have spoke to our hearts Lord ministering to us Lord Oh God we're just so appreciative Lord so much that we have Lord to thank you for as David Lord said wash of the Lord in the beauty of his holiness Lord this this is our worship Lord it originates it's born or God Father by the beauty of your holiness part for Lord we could not make ourselves acceptable but all God we have been made accepted in the beloved Oh God we ask this morning for every life that is here for every need that Lord no matter where one would be what has been spoken this morning of your grace your righteousness your holiness may every heart in every life recognized the great the great price that was paid that that life could come to us Lord and release us from our own works that could bring about Lord a death of that badger nature on the inside and release the very holiness and righteousness of Jesus Christ by the grace of God into the bosom of our soul that by that life that quickening power we bring this body shell of the Badger into subjection by that authority of the love of God in our soul nor Jesus as you have spoken so deeply in our lives may we not frustrate the grace of God we ask Lord God throughout this building this morning forgive us would search a sword if there be any way any place or God where we have frustrated or our frustrating Oh God cleanse us Lord God by your power Lord and your holiness or God that our walk like Aaron Lord my God be as the bells in the pomegranates Lord moving together O God as our lives would blend together in harmony with you Lord crying out holy holy holy holy is the Lord granite Lord this morning I pray God may every life every heart God may it live in a manner Lord and surrendering oh God that you might go deeper Lord moving deeper Lord surrendering Lord for our labor Lord is the laying down of our will Lord and father it's by your grace Lord that an atmosphere who God has created Lord for us to surrender Oh God to see father than Lord Jesus it is you Lord that desires to do for us what we ourselves cannot do lord help us wider father there be any Lord O God that in any measure Lord have been trusting Lord and resting Lord in their works may be Lord with things that they have done and Lord somehow that that in itself would merit happiness may they recognize Oh God that real true happiness and joy is not based upon our works but it's based solidly in the grace of Almighty God our works are only an appreciation Lord for what you for what grace has already done for us more and that grace is so reflected in our life to where we are known as mrs. grace Oh bless your wonderful name Lord we love you Father we thank you of God for your mercy blessed for the Daniell Lord the Assembly Lord is wife is children Oh God how
