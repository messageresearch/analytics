[0:00] and Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob the
[0:03] heirs with him of the same promise for
[0:06] he looked and maybe seen Abraham was not
[0:15] looking for the Promised Land
[0:18] neither was Isaac or Jacob Abraham
[0:22] sojourned in the land of promise Isaac
[0:25] was born in the land of promise Jacob
[0:29] was born in the land of promise
[0:31] amen god bless you buddy and so he
[0:37] wasn't looking Abraham he was looking
[0:42] for a city it said whose builder and
[0:45] maker is God what Abraham was looking
[0:47] for was heaven
[0:51] man the promised land
[0:55] brother Brennan told us type the Holy
[0:57] Spirit well that wasn't what he was
[1:01] looking for he was looking for heaven
[1:03] turned me to Philippians three verses
[1:08] 2021
[1:20] or our conversation is in heaven from
[1:23] whence also we look for the Saviour the
[1:26] Lord Jesus Christ who shall change our
[1:30] vile bodies that it may be fashioned
[1:33] like unto his glorious body can save man
[1:36] according to the working whereby he is
[1:39] able even to subdue all things unto
[1:41] himself
[1:42] so if Abraham was looking for heaven
[1:46] where is heaven
[1:49] Abraham wasn't looking out into the
[1:52] Stars
[1:53] he wasn't looking out into space Abraham
[1:57] the Bible said was sojourn in the land
[1:59] of promise and he was looking for heaven
[2:09] first thing I want to say Evan is a real
[2:13] place
[2:17] turn me to John chapter 14 I want to
[2:20] read verses 1 through 3 here's the words
[2:23] that Jesus spoke on the night before he
[2:25] was crucified
[2:27] and he says let not your heart be
[2:29] troubled you believe in God believe also
[2:31] in me in my father's house are many
[2:34] mansions if it were not so I would have
[2:37] told you I go to prepare a place for you
[2:40] and if I go prepare a place for you I
[2:42] will come again and receive you unto
[2:44] myself that where I am there you may be
[2:47] also
[2:48] so
[2:51] twice in three verses Jesus calls heaven
[2:54] a place and he means that when he says
[3:03] my father's house he's talking about
[3:05] heaven
[3:11] and what he means is it's just as real
[3:13] as any place that you could think of
[3:16] here on earth it's as real as the place
[3:22] that you call home it's a real place
[3:25] filled with real people now when the
[3:32] people pass from this life they die as
[3:37] we say they pass away or
[3:40] are asleep in Christ then they pass into
[3:46] another dimension a dimension of
[3:49] immortals and they don't pass into a
[3:55] place where there's houses of brick and
[3:58] mortar and paint and all these things
[4:00] but what he's talking about when he says
[4:03] in my father's house he's talking about
[4:06] another body
[4:09] where the scripture says that if the
[4:12] earthly tabernacle be dissolved we have
[4:15] one waiting
[4:18] and so the place that you go
[4:23] is more of a condition
[4:29] it's a body changes it's changing and
[4:33] that's where they go before they return
[4:37] and are raised from the dead
[4:42] a house not made with hands is what Paul
[4:47] says in 2nd Corinthians it's a body
[4:54] heaven we know is the dwelling place of
[4:57] God
[4:59] I'm gonna refer to many scriptures and
[5:02] to save time I'm just going to read them
[5:05] to you and I won't I won't give you time
[5:09] to turn to Rose it it'll take us a while
[5:12] to get through it otherwise I've had
[5:14] many scriptures here before me but
[5:16] Matthew 18 and 10 it says take heed that
[5:20] ye despise not one of these little ones
[5:23] for I saying to you that in heaven their
[5:25] angels do always behold the face of my
[5:28] father which is in heaven amen so that's
[5:31] where the father is is in heaven and the
[5:35] angels that are the guardian angels they
[5:39] always behold the face of the Father
[5:44] the throne of God is in heaven in
[5:47] Matthew 34 5 and 34 it says but I saying
[5:54] do you swear not neither by heaven for
[5:56] it is God's throne
[5:59] in acts 7 48 49 it says howbeit the Most
[6:03] High dwelleth not in temples made with
[6:06] hands as saith the Prophet heaven is my
[6:09] throne and earth is my footstool what
[6:12] house will you build me saith the Lord
[6:14] or what is the place of my rest
[6:18] Hebrews 8:1 says now of the things which
[6:23] we have spoken this is the sum we have
[6:26] such an high priest whose is set on the
[6:29] right hand of the throne of the Majesty
[6:32] in heaven
[6:34] and from what we read earlier from
[6:37] flippy ins three-and-twenty we see our
[6:41] citizenship is from heaven Abraham
[6:46] journeyed as a pilgrim and a stranger
[6:49] and that's what we are here we're living
[6:54] in this realm but we're not of this
[6:56] realm the bodies that we inhabit are of
[7:01] this realm and but but we're not of this
[7:08] realm and we're waiting for the Lord
[7:10] Jesus to come to catch us away the Bible
[7:15] actually hints that heaven is not that
[7:18] far away
[7:21] whether Branham says it directly that
[7:24] heavens not that far away
[7:27] many times people think you to travel to
[7:31] heaven you've got to go way up beyond
[7:33] the sky somewhere
[7:36] but early Christians knew and we can see
[7:40] it by the scriptures that they would
[7:43] immediately when they pass from this
[7:45] life they would immediately pass into
[7:47] heaven
[7:49] or a realm of heaven
[7:53] in the message of Christ revealed his
[7:55] own word brother branham says you're
[7:57] going to find out one of these days that
[7:59] when you go to heaven you don't fly off
[8:01] somewhere else you're right here you're
[8:05] still right here - just in another
[8:07] dimension faster than this right through
[8:11] this room is coming color every color
[8:13] shirt dress whatever you got on is
[8:16] eternal laying right on the records
[8:19] going around and around the world every
[8:21] time you bat your eyes it's right on
[8:23] record watch television will prove that
[8:25] brother batam says when a person is born
[8:29] there is a record put on to record that
[8:34] person's life and he says at first
[8:38] there's not much sound but then as you
[8:40] grow then it becomes things you spoke
[8:43] things you do and as you come into the
[8:48] age of accountability then there's a
[8:51] recording of that and brother Graham
[8:52] said then when a person dies that tape
[8:55] gets put into God's library and then
[8:59] when the judgement comes that tape will
[9:02] be pulled out and played everything that
[9:05] was ever said everything that was ever
[9:07] done he said everything you ever thought
[9:12] but thank God for the blood of Jesus
[9:15] Christ that cleanses and erases anything
[9:22] as we seen Thursday night from all of
[9:25] our mistakes all of our faults our sins
[9:28] our failures will be erased by the blood
[9:31] of Jesus Christ I wouldn't want to stand
[9:35] there on that day without that
[9:40] but the rhythm says in one place he was
[9:42] afraid not knowing what heaven exactly
[9:46] was he was afraid at first he didn't
[9:49] want to just be a spirit floating around
[9:52] he said he wanted to be a man all the
[9:57] time wherever he was
[10:00] and then he had a vision one morning he
[10:03] woke up in bed and he had a vision and
[10:06] he said he in that vision he says I went
[10:09] to another dimension somewhere
[10:12] and he says when we leave this body were
[10:15] not spirits God's got another type of
[10:18] body where we're just as real as we are
[10:21] here
[10:27] Paul tells us something amazing about
[10:30] the gospel and what it's done for us in
[10:32] Hebrews 12 22 through 24 he says but we
[10:38] ye are coming to Mount Zion unto the
[10:42] city of the Living God the heavenly
[10:44] Jerusalem to an innumerable company of
[10:47] angels to the General Assembly of the
[10:50] Church of the firstborn which are
[10:53] written in heaven and to God the judge
[10:55] of all and to the spirits of just men
[10:58] made perfect and to Jesus the mediator
[11:00] of the New Covenant and to the blood of
[11:03] sprinkling that speaketh better things
[11:05] than that of Abel Paul is comparing
[11:09] Mount Sinai to Mount Zion
[11:13] and in the time we know of Moses Moses
[11:17] would go on Mount Sinai to get into the
[11:21] presence of God
[11:22] and to hear from God and remember one
[11:26] time that the children of Israel said
[11:29] they wanted God to speak directly to
[11:31] them and so they draw near and to Mount
[11:34] Sinai and it talks about there being
[11:37] thunderings and lightnings and earth
[11:39] shaking and they they were fearful and
[11:42] they said no let God speak to you Moses
[11:44] and then you just come tell us what he
[11:45] said had to say but in this verses that
[11:50] we read the writer or Paul uses a Greek
[11:56] word that means to come near or to
[11:59] approach closely he uses it several
[12:02] times when he says to an innumerable
[12:04] company of angels to a General Assembly
[12:08] of the Church of the firstborn to the
[12:10] judge of all to the spirits of just men
[12:13] made perfect and he uses this phrase
[12:17] many times and what he's saying but now
[12:22] we're in Christ we are in heavenly
[12:26] realities
[12:29] think of what he's saying heavens not
[12:31] that far away
[12:33] we're not that far from angels we're not
[12:35] that far from love lines we're not that
[12:40] far from God we're not that far from
[12:42] Jesus Christ itself heaven is a real
[12:45] place where Jesus is and it's not far
[12:50] away from us
[12:52] Amen pulses and visions tune one through
[12:57] seven he said you have he quickened who
[13:00] were dead in trespasses sin you say
[13:03] ma'am
[13:04] he's quickened us we were dead in
[13:07] trespasses and sin but we've been
[13:09] quickened what is it that that seed of
[13:13] God that we you were born with that was
[13:15] on the inside of you has been quickened
[13:17] and brought to life we're waiting for a
[13:22] quickening of this body
[13:26] we're in time passed she walked
[13:28] according to the course of this world
[13:30] according to the Prince of the power of
[13:31] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[13:34] the children of disobedience among whom
[13:36] also we all had our conversation in time
[13:40] past in the lusts of our flesh
[13:41] fulfilling the desires of the flesh
[13:43] another mind and we're by nature the
[13:46] children of Wrath even as others but God
[13:49] who is rich in mercy amen for his great
[13:53] love we're in he loved us even when we
[13:56] were dead in sins hath quickened us
[13:59] together with Christ by grace ye are
[14:01] saved and has raised us up together and
[14:04] made us to sit together in heavenly
[14:07] places in Christ Jesus that in the ages
[14:12] to come he might shew the exceeding
[14:14] riches of His grace in his kindness
[14:15] toward us through Christ Jesus
[14:21] pardon me
[14:29] in
[14:31] second Corinthians twelve verses two
[14:35] through four Paul speaks about the third
[14:42] heaven and says he was caught up into
[14:48] paradise and heard unspeakable words
[14:50] which were not lawful for man to utter
[14:53] into the third heaven
[14:57] so what we're looking at there are
[14:59] realms of heaven there are different
[15:03] dimensions
[15:05] we here on earth on we're in this mortal
[15:09] realm
[15:11] but there are dimensions that are below
[15:14] us I don't mean into the earth but I
[15:19] mean on us God scale there are
[15:22] dimensions going this way and there's
[15:25] dimensions going that way and we live in
[15:28] in between in them in among dimension of
[15:33] mortals
[15:35] now in that dimension you take there's a
[15:40] great conglomerate of blackness and
[15:42] gaiety and muck and sin and divisions of
[15:46] the world but all
[15:49] at once you might see a light somewhere
[15:53] brother madam said that light that you
[15:55] see in the mists of that darkness is a
[15:58] Christian in the midst of all the
[16:01] darkness in this mortal realm he says
[16:04] you'll see a light here and there and
[16:06] that is the Christian but men that are
[16:11] in this realm they are influenced by
[16:14] these other realms they're glowing this
[16:19] way brother Branham says there's the
[16:21] round the first realm is the realm of
[16:23] the dead the Unruh generated man lost
[16:27] unjust souls of men and then the
[16:32] dimension beyond that he says this
[16:34] dimension of demons and then the
[16:37] dimension beyond that is the dimension
[16:39] of hell
[16:41] going the other way you have the first
[16:43] dimension of the saved of those that are
[16:47] under the blood of Jesus Christ who died
[16:50] and who will rise again beyond that you
[16:55] have the next dimension which brother
[16:57] Branham said was the dimension of angels
[16:59] and then the next dimension above that
[17:02] he says is the third heaven where God is
[17:07] he says men that are here in this mortal
[17:10] realm they're affected by one dimension
[17:13] or the other he said this side comes
[17:18] from God that side comes from the devil
[17:22] and it affects mortal beings in this
[17:25] realm and he says those that are in
[17:28] darkness are influenced from beneath and
[17:31] those that are the lights are influenced
[17:35] from above
[17:37] when you leave this earthly dimension
[17:45] you pass one way or the other into a
[17:48] realm of spirits into a realm either of
[17:54] the just or the unjust
[18:04] brother branham spoke about when he was
[18:07] shot and he was dying and he says I was
[18:13] laying there when the doctor done away
[18:16] with me and I felt myself sinking into a
[18:22] dark eternity looked like
[18:25] and I hollered papa Oh Papa helped me
[18:30] there was no Papa there mama helped me
[18:35] there was no mama there all God helped
[18:39] me there was no God there it was just
[18:42] endless horrible old nightmare burning
[18:47] blazing hell would be a pleasure being
[18:50] up beside that and falling on through
[18:53] there I thought oh my over and over like
[18:55] this and I got in a place of smoke and
[18:58] dark and sick and all such a feeling it
[19:02] was death on me and I could see these
[19:05] women coming up to me and they had some
[19:08] kind of painted eyes like that and that
[19:12] was about 40 years ago but I still
[19:15] remember it and they were going ooh ooh
[19:18] ooh and I said am I to be here forever
[19:24] yeah it's just forever
[19:27] he said old God if you'll let me out of
[19:30] here I'll never be ashamed of you again
[19:32] I'll never be ashamed God please give me
[19:35] a chance
[19:36] the first thing you know I felt myself
[19:38] coming back up and the doctor was
[19:41] alarmed because my heart had only
[19:43] beating 17 times to the minute I doesn't
[19:47] let out all my blood and everywhere
[19:49] laying in my own blood
[19:54] where the brand saw the dimensions of
[19:57] the law hell the dimensions of hell
[20:09] talks about when he had moved out to
[20:12] Tucson and his wife went to JC Penney
[20:16] store and she was shopping and he sat
[20:22] down to wait
[20:24] and coming up either escalator was these
[20:29] two women and he said they had paint on
[20:32] their eyes and he said they were talking
[20:35] in another language he believed it was
[20:38] Spanish but when he first heard them and
[20:41] saw them he thought that he was back in
[20:45] that place again
[20:46] hell
[20:48] and I wanted to say from this those
[20:54] individuals were influenced by wonderful
[20:56] side of the dimensions or the other and
[20:59] from what brother branham said he saw we
[21:01] can see what dimensions that influence
[21:04] is strong
[21:20] message of fellowship you said now if
[21:22] you speak of heaven or when we die that
[21:24] we go off someplace where you can't even
[21:28] see can't you see that God has hid the
[21:31] glory from the natural eye
[21:34] we are setting here in heavenly places
[21:39] now the Holy Spirit is here now Christ
[21:43] is here and the body that we receive
[21:47] when we go out of here is here we got we
[21:51] go into another dimension into a blessed
[21:54] place with the Lord Jesus in return and
[21:56] at the return of Christ in his physical
[21:59] body come back to earth he spiritually
[22:03] turned back and picked up a brand-new
[22:05] body that's going to live forever if
[22:08] people can get the ideal right now of
[22:11] angels walking up and down the aisles of
[22:15] Christ the Son of God moving around in
[22:18] the building you're in his presence we
[22:25] are seated in heavenly places heaven is
[22:27] moving around us just in another
[22:32] dimension brother Brown said that's
[22:34] faster than ours
[22:40] the Bible doesn't give a lot of
[22:42] description of heaven
[22:45] but it does give us some images and
[22:48] pictures comparisons to life here on
[22:51] earth
[22:58] Psalms 33:13 said the Lord looketh from
[23:02] heaven
[23:05] acts 1:8 through leaven says but we ever
[23:09] see but we shall receive power after the
[23:13] Holy Ghost has come upon you and ye
[23:15] shall be witnesses unto me both in
[23:19] Jerusalem and all Judea and into Samaria
[23:21] and unto the uttermost part of the earth
[23:24] as Jesus talking to the cyclist and when
[23:27] he had spoken these things while they
[23:30] beheld he was taken up and a cloud
[23:32] received him out of their sight and
[23:34] while they looked steadfastly toward
[23:37] heaven as he went up behold two men
[23:39] stood by them in white apparel what
[23:42] happened
[23:42] they appeared from that other dimension
[23:45] which also which also said Ye men of
[23:49] Galilee why stand ye gazing into heaven
[23:52] this same Jesus which was taken up from
[23:55] you into heaven shall so come in like
[23:58] manner as ye have seen him go into
[24:00] heaven he saved man he's going to come
[24:04] in like manner he's coming again
[24:13] Paul says in Philippians 1:21 through 23
[24:18] for me to live is Christ and to die is
[24:20] gain
[24:22] but if I live in the flesh this is the
[24:25] fruit of my labor yet what I shall
[24:28] choose I want not for I am in a strait
[24:31] between stew having a desire to depart
[24:35] and to be with Christ which is far
[24:38] better Paul says he's caught between the
[24:41] two he's here doing the work for Christ
[24:44] but he longs to leave here and be with
[24:47] Christ
[24:53] so we see the father's house there's a
[24:58] city designed and built by God Hebrews
[25:01] 11 and 16 tells us it's a better country
[25:05] turned me to revelations chapter 21 now
[25:13] I'm going to read a few verses here and
[25:16] I'm going to skip some verses because
[25:18] there's a lot of words of jewels and
[25:26] things that I don't even know of and
[25:28] can't pronounce so if you want later you
[25:32] can go and reread this whole chapter but
[25:37] what I want to look at is the
[25:39] description of the city
[25:41] verse two and I John saw the holy city
[25:44] to New Jerusalem coming down from God
[25:46] out of heaven prepared as a bride
[25:49] adorned for her husband and I heard a
[25:52] great voice out of heaven saying behold
[25:54] the tabernacle of God is with men and he
[25:57] will do well with them and they shall be
[25:59] his people and God himself shall be with
[26:02] them and be their God and God shall wipe
[26:05] away all tears from their eyes and there
[26:08] shall be no more death neither sorrow
[26:10] nor crying neither shall there be any
[26:13] more pain where the former things are
[26:16] passed away
[26:17] they say praise the Lord verse 18 and
[26:21] the building of the wall of it was
[26:24] Jasper and the city was pure gold like
[26:26] in the clear glass verse 21 and the
[26:30] twelve gates were twelve pearls every
[26:33] several gate was of one pearl and the
[26:35] street of the city was pure gold as it
[26:37] were transparent glass and the city had
[26:41] no need of the Sun neither of the moon
[26:43] that's in verse 23 two shining it for
[26:46] the glory of God did lighten it and the
[26:49] lamb is the light thereof verse 25 and
[26:53] the gates of it shall not be shut at all
[26:56] by day for there shall be no night there
[26:59] glory verse 27 and there shall in no
[27:04] wise enter in anything to defile it nor
[27:07] whatsoever worketh abomination or maketh
[27:09] the lie but they which are written in
[27:12] the Lamb's Book of Life
[27:16] now from the Scriptures and from songs
[27:20] that we've heard were all
[27:23] familiar with the
[27:26] the city the streets being paved with
[27:30] gold
[27:30] we've got songs that's a sir so I want
[27:36] you just for a moment before we go on to
[27:38] imagine something imagine that you were
[27:42] a very wealthy person and you possess
[27:46] must riches
[27:48] and you had a lot of gold
[27:51] and let's say that you somehow were able
[27:55] to take that gold with you when you left
[27:58] here
[28:00] you realize when you got to heaven the
[28:02] only thing you would have would be
[28:04] pavement
[28:18] John writes about the cities paved with
[28:21] gold and I don't doubt his words I
[28:23] believe they're literal I believe
[28:25] they're simply him reporting what he saw
[28:28] and but I also believe that it was meant
[28:33] to tell us that something that we here
[28:35] in this slide hold as having great value
[28:40] is going to be used to pave the streets
[28:42] with their
[28:47] it's a city built by God in a great city
[28:54] it will be filled with God's people what
[28:58] would that city be like won't be no
[29:01] pollution the sky will be clear no crime
[29:08] no violence no criminals will ever enter
[29:14] there
[29:16] there won't be no greedy politicians
[29:21] there won't be no drug pushers there
[29:25] won't be no drug users
[29:28] there won't be no child molester
[29:35] there won't be any potholes in this city
[29:42] we won't have to worry about power
[29:44] outages for the lamb is light there
[29:57] revelations 22 verses one through three
[30:02] and he showed me a pure river of water
[30:05] of life clear as crystal proceeding out
[30:08] of the throne of God and of the lamb and
[30:11] in the midst of the street of it on
[30:14] either side of the river there was a
[30:16] tree of life which bare twelve manner of
[30:19] fruits yielded to her fruit every month
[30:22] and the leaves of the trees were for the
[30:25] healing of the nation's
[30:29] this tree spanned the river is what this
[30:34] is saying was this one tree but it says
[30:38] it spanned the river verse three and
[30:41] there shall be no more curse Alleluia
[30:49] right now our bodies every time we look
[30:53] in the mirror testifies of us that we
[30:57] are living under the curse as far as in
[31:00] this physical body this body is subject
[31:04] to the curse that's why we're we die we
[31:07] our bodies is dying as we grow older it
[31:11] gets to a point where our body slows
[31:13] down on the reproduction of cells until
[31:17] eventually it stops
[31:21] but there will be no more curse there'll
[31:27] be no more dying there will be no more
[31:32] sorrow no regret no remorse all
[31:38] bitterness will be gone you got to get
[31:42] rid of that bitterness here you you
[31:45] can't hold on to that all your failures
[31:50] will be left behind suffering will be
[31:54] redeemed and rewarded
[31:57] there won't be any eyeglasses no braces
[32:04] no wheelchair no false teeth no bald
[32:12] heads no hearing aids there won't be any
[32:20] crutches there won't be any need of
[32:23] hospitals there won't be no need of
[32:29] doctors there won't be no more nursing
[32:34] homes because we don't grow old there
[32:39] it's one of the things I tell my oldest
[32:42] daughter all the time I tell her
[32:43] promised me when I get older you will
[32:45] not stick me in a nursing home
[32:48] I I do not like those places they're one
[32:53] of the most sad places on earth you
[32:54] asked me my daughter works in one every
[32:57] day
[32:59] there won't be no need of paramedics
[33:02] nobody's gonna need CPR
[33:07] won't be no aspirin won't need it
[33:11] no Tylenol accidents over cancer utterly
[33:18] obliterate
[33:21] heart attacks won't be any no one grows
[33:27] old and feeble there's another thing you
[33:31] won't find in heaven Cemetery
[33:36] because no one dies no funerals if you
[33:42] make it to that city you'll live forever
[33:44] a man
[33:52] who's in heaven right now well we've
[33:55] said pretty much that already God we
[33:58] know is in heaven the Lord Jesus we know
[34:03] that the Bible tells us there are
[34:06] maryada of angels
[34:08] and I'm sure you know that there's the
[34:12] Angels have different classifications
[34:15] and categories and jobs that they
[34:17] perform and do we can see that clearly
[34:20] by the scripture
[34:22] and
[34:28] I believe that every true believer that
[34:33] has been washed under the blood of Jesus
[34:37] Christ by accepting him as their Savior
[34:41] and filled with the Holy Ghost born
[34:45] again all the born again will be in that
[34:49] first dimension of heaven and when they
[34:57] rise again then those who are alive and
[34:59] remain will be changed
[35:05] and we will have a little time with them
[35:07] here before we pass on into the next
[35:11] dimension to meet Jesus Christ in the
[35:13] air as the Bible says
[35:19] but I wonder what that will be like when
[35:24] they arrive
[35:25] I wonder I know that the born-again
[35:32] believers will see will be able to see
[35:37] the resurrection of the dead they'll be
[35:40] able to see loved ones that's come back
[35:46] but I don't think the world will be able
[35:49] to see and I believe that will be
[35:53] changed into a body that the world won't
[35:56] be able to see
[36:06] oh but you know what it makes me think
[36:09] also those that won't be taped
[36:17] those that will be left here in this
[36:20] dimension of the mortal and will have to
[36:25] go through the three and a half years of
[36:28] tribulation
[36:34] friends I don't want the plan B what if
[36:39] I don't make it I'll make it through the
[36:40] tribulation no sir I don't want a plan B
[36:42] I want to make it a man brother branham
[36:49] spoke about the tribulation and he said
[36:51] cut me open build me full of sulfur and
[36:53] set me on fire but don't let me go
[36:55] through that tribulation telling how
[36:58] horrible that it will be
[37:07] Bride of Christ will be caught away
[37:14] I believe that children who are died
[37:20] before the age of accountability they go
[37:23] to heaven
[37:24] brother branham actually says all babies
[37:27] if they died go to heaven
[37:29] before the age of accountability I'll
[37:32] personally I don't have anything really
[37:36] to back this up so if you think
[37:39] otherwise it's all right it's not
[37:40] something that's going to hurt either
[37:42] one of us but I believe that people that
[37:45] are born with mental disabilities that
[37:50] don't have the ability to be able to
[37:53] understand I believe they're going to be
[37:57] there and be in our right mind
[38:00] because it was being brought into this
[38:03] room into this body something took place
[38:06] before the birth and they were born that
[38:10] way
[38:12] but I don't believe that's the real them
[38:19] no more than I believe you can look at
[38:21] one another and say well I see the real
[38:23] you
[38:25] the real me doesn't look like this I
[38:31] remember what I look like
[38:38] I can't wait to go back I can't wait to
[38:42] be young again well I've got a lot more
[38:46] to say on that
[38:51] second Corinthians five and seven
[38:57] you're nine
[38:59] pardon me
[39:07] where we walk by faith not by sight we
[39:10] are confident I say and willing rather
[39:14] to be absent from the body and present
[39:17] with the Lord
[39:19] wherefore we labour that whether present
[39:22] or absent we may be accepted of him
[39:26] not everybody is gonna make it to heaven
[39:31] the Bible clearly defines there are the
[39:34] same there are the laws
[39:38] there is no in-between category now
[39:47] I want to put this in here where the
[39:50] Branham talks about the elect and he
[39:55] talks about he gives an example of like
[39:58] cutting out a pattern of a dress
[40:02] and he says when you cut it out there is
[40:05] part of that cloth is ordained to be
[40:10] part of the dress
[40:12] but he says there's a remnant
[40:15] and you don't do away with that it still
[40:17] was part of the cloth it just wasn't
[40:20] ordained to be part of the dress
[40:23] and brother branham likens that unto the
[40:25] difference between those that are the
[40:28] elect the Bride of Christ and those that
[40:31] actually have received Jesus as their
[40:33] Savior and are saved
[40:37] remember the foolish virgins they were
[40:40] still virtuous they were saved they just
[40:46] didn't have the Holy Ghost
[40:56] and there's a time when they will come
[41:00] to receive their inheritance but just
[41:06] looking from among the saved and the
[41:08] lost
[41:10] people are either going to spend
[41:12] eternity in heaven or spending eternity
[41:14] in hell
[41:21] my job is not to decide who goes to
[41:24] heaven and who goes to hell I'm in cells
[41:28] not administration
[41:36] but I am sure one thing those that do
[41:41] not accept Jesus as their Savior will
[41:44] not have a chance of being
[41:51] God knows us completely and intimately
[41:55] and what I want to answer was how are we
[41:59] gonna know each other
[42:00] in heaven because we're going to be
[42:04] changed
[42:08] let's say you met someone you've come in
[42:11] and you've just met someone here now and
[42:15] let's say they're in their 70s they're
[42:17] not gonna look like that when they
[42:20] received the body change the how do you
[42:22] get to know
[42:26] you live with your husband and wife yeah
[42:30] in your memory you can have remembering
[42:32] what they look like in that but what
[42:35] you've grown accustomed to is what they
[42:37] look like now on you except that in this
[42:40] nature I'm as being them
[42:48] how you gonna know
[42:51] well
[42:53] one thing's for sure we're not going to
[42:55] no less in heaven than we know here one
[42:59] thing's for sure we're going to no more
[43:01] in heaven than we do here
[43:04] Paul says in first Corinthians 13:12 for
[43:07] now we see through a glass darkly but
[43:10] then face to face now I know in part but
[43:14] then shall I know even as also I am
[43:18] known
[43:21] Psalms 31 39 verses 1 through 4
[43:27] Psalm 139 verses one through o Lord thou
[43:32] has searched me and known me thou
[43:35] knowest my down setting and my uprising
[43:38] thou understand that my thought afar off
[43:42] thou compass my path and my lying down
[43:46] and our great and art acquainted with
[43:50] all my ways
[43:52] for there is not a word in my tongue but
[43:55] but lo o Lord thou knowest it all
[43:58] together
[44:01] David is right here God knows us very
[44:03] intimately
[44:06] God we know his word is a discerner of
[44:10] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[44:17] we we have imperfections in this life
[44:25] but those imperfections are going to be
[44:28] removed this life causes us to cover up
[44:34] now not just physically I'm talking
[44:36] about but I'm talking about emotionally
[44:39] many times people cover themselves
[44:45] because
[44:50] of the sin
[44:53] it's over
[44:59] sin will be lifted
[45:04] then we can be ourselves without the
[45:06] imperfections don't shame
[45:13] no embarrassment
[45:19] individual personalities survive into
[45:23] eternity brother Branham says one place
[45:26] says that God takes your personality who
[45:31] you are your makeup and he uses that for
[45:34] his glory God's made you like you are he
[45:40] wanted you to be like you are God didn't
[45:43] just throw the clay there and say well
[45:45] let's just see what comes of it brother
[45:49] Brennan says in one place he said he
[45:51] bred this one to that one and this one
[45:52] to that one and this one to that one
[45:54] until he got the right ting in the bell
[45:59] who you are the way God wanted you to be
[46:02] and when we leave here will still be the
[46:06] way God wanted us to be so the essence
[46:10] of who you are
[46:12] survives into eternity
[46:16] hallelujah just vastly improved by the
[46:22] grace of God
[46:27] I believe well know each other
[46:29] intimately and I take this from the
[46:31] scripture when Peter James and John were
[46:36] on Mount Transfiguration they recognized
[46:40] Moses and Elijah
[46:43] now they didn't recognize them because
[46:46] there had been some paintings of Moses
[46:49] and Elijah that had their likeness down
[46:52] there may have been paintings but who
[46:54] who would know what they looked like
[46:57] years hundreds of years have passed how
[47:04] did they recognize Moses and Elijah they
[47:07] weren't wearing name tags
[47:11] there was something about each one of
[47:14] those men that made it evident of who
[47:17] they were there was something they
[47:21] recognized you realize what was
[47:23] happening was here was a opening of
[47:27] another dimension and here steps out
[47:30] Moses and Elijah
[47:34] and there's still Moses and Elijah
[47:38] brother Brennan says Saul got back slid
[47:41] and God wouldn't answer his prayer and
[47:45] he went to the prophets and the
[47:47] Providence couldn't tell him anything
[47:48] and he went to the Urim and Thummim and
[47:53] there was no lights to flashed across it
[47:55] and so he disguised himself and went to
[47:58] the Witch of Endor and then he asked her
[48:02] to bring up the spirit of of Samuel and
[48:07] when she called him up she bowed down
[48:12] herself and cried I see God's rising
[48:15] from the earth and brother man said
[48:19] Samuel was still a prophet he was still
[48:24] Samuel and Saul recognizing but not only
[48:29] that he knew Saul
[48:36] some people have said Saul was lost Saul
[48:39] was not lost
[48:40] he just back slid but remember Samuel
[48:46] said today you and your son are gonna
[48:50] die in battle and then you're gonna be
[48:54] with me so he couldn't be lost because
[48:58] they were going to be where Samuel was
[49:00] but my real point was Samuel was still a
[49:03] prophet he was still sandal and Elijah
[49:08] and Moses when they stood there on Mount
[49:10] Transfiguration they were still prophets
[49:15] and Moses wasn't an old man like he was
[49:19] when he delivered led the children out
[49:22] of bondage he was a young man again but
[49:24] there was something about him that he
[49:26] was still Moises Alou yeah Peter James
[49:35] and John recognized him even though they
[49:37] had never saw him before
[49:42] I believe
[49:49] I know that will recognize
[49:55] many of you here in this assembly know
[49:58] the testimony of my father and how when
[50:04] he was on the table there before the
[50:08] doctors he rose up out of his body he
[50:13] was taking it to another dimension and
[50:16] said he was trying to see everything and
[50:21] he described how the flowers were they
[50:25] are more beautiful than any flowers
[50:27] did you ever see here in this world and
[50:30] there was many people coming and he was
[50:33] trying to look and see him he said but
[50:35] there was a young man that was standing
[50:37] in front of him
[50:39] and he says every time he would move the
[50:42] look around who said that young man
[50:44] would move over into his line of sight
[50:47] and this went on for a little bit till
[50:50] finally he looked directly at the young
[50:52] man
[50:53] and when he looked at young man the
[50:55] young man smiled and when he did my dad
[50:58] said he knew that was his dad
[51:03] we'll know them they'll know hosts
[51:11] the last time that my grandfather
[51:14] Browning saw me I was 12 years old
[51:20] you'll know me on that day
[51:29] or I think about what Heaven's like
[51:35] and I think about it in the life story
[51:36] brother branham told about how his wife
[51:41] hope was passing and they had pulled a
[51:47] sheet up over her he went to go in the
[51:52] room the nurse that I was going with you
[51:53] to brother and said no I wanted going
[51:55] alone
[51:56] he goes in and he shuts the door and he
[51:58] walks over and he pulls the Sheik back
[52:02] and he said she was gone
[52:07] but he took a hold of her and he said
[52:09] hope well just speak to me one more time
[52:12] and speak to him and he shook her and
[52:16] then he said he screamed hope
[52:18] and when he did her eyes come hope you
[52:24] know what she says why did you call me
[52:27] back
[52:33] and I think about it she had two babies
[52:35] here in this realm and a husband but she
[52:41] said why did you call me back
[52:53] and I want to read this team
[52:56] she says old bill you've preached about
[53:02] it honey you've talked about it but you
[53:06] don't realize what it is I was being
[53:09] taken home by a group of white angels it
[53:13] was like an oriental thing with big
[53:15] birds flying from tree to tree so
[53:18] peaceful
[53:21] the Benham says I believe with all my
[53:23] heart she was going into paradise
[53:29] he says understood by the bedside
[53:32] restraints that have passed and watch
[53:37] them reading loved one that no one else
[53:40] could see
[53:46] what was happening they were dying they
[53:48] were leaving this mortal realm they were
[53:49] beginning to see into that next
[53:52] dimension
[54:04] I remember
[54:06] my being with my mother's dad my
[54:10] grandfather Brown and I remember one
[54:16] time going with him down to the
[54:18] barbershop
[54:20] and we got there there was somebody that
[54:25] came up
[54:27] and I know I don't remember a lot else
[54:29] but I do remember this thing I remember
[54:31] my grandfather asked him saying young
[54:32] man have you ever thought about where
[54:35] are you going to spend eternity
[54:39] yeah that's never left
[54:45] I don't know all of you here today I
[54:47] know a lot of you but I don't know wall
[54:51] where are you going to spend eternity
[54:59] are you gonna go to that place
[55:05] of beauty and rest are you going to go
[55:08] to that place which hope was describing
[55:10] said you've preached about it you've
[55:13] talked about it but still don't
[55:16] understand what it is it's greater than
[55:20] anything that we can describe it's
[55:23] greater than any words that I have used
[55:25] this morning to try to tell you about a
[55:27] heaven that's still great
[55:33] are you gonna go be going over those
[55:35] great atarax
[55:36] brother madam says those fall falling
[55:39] into eternity there in the voice of many
[55:43] waters the voice of the ministers that
[55:46] spoke in the meetings you said here
[55:49] where the word was spoke where you could
[55:55] have given your life to the Lord but you
[55:59] refused the word that was coming for
[56:03] this may be said I still got time
[56:10] I'm young I've got plenty of time
[56:18] there was a man that I know that I
[56:22] remember when we were just kids
[56:29] and uh we just found out the other day
[56:32] he's uh he was just a few years older
[56:36] than me found out the other day that he
[56:41] had something like a boil or something
[56:44] that was on his side and he didn't take
[56:46] care of it and somehow something
[56:51] Stephanie for something said in
[56:55] and he died
[56:59] but he had a half brother who went down
[57:05] to seem to try to get there before he
[57:07] died and when he got there he was on
[57:10] life support and he went in and he tried
[57:15] to see if he could speak to him and he
[57:19] told him he said if if you've ever
[57:21] prayed you need to pray now you need to
[57:26] talk to the Lord and get right he said
[57:30] he didn't see any sign
[57:34] and he had to make the decision moving
[57:37] off life
[57:40] he's gone
[57:41] he's passed
[57:48] there's no prey in the mouth
[57:51] there's no buying them out
[58:03] if he was counting on getting right with
[58:06] God before he passed he didn't get that
[58:10] opportunity it happened too
[58:20] I don't believe Eve knew that he was
[58:23] gonna die
[58:25] you just
[58:30] we had no promise of tomorrow we have no
[58:33] promise of how long but I will tell you
[58:37] this also when Christ comes from the
[58:41] dead in Christ rise all those that are
[58:45] the born again will be changed but those
[58:50] that are not born again will not be
[58:52] changed
[58:57] I want to be amongst the Zbornak
[59:05] our heads
[59:18] is there
[59:20] anyone here this morning say
[59:23] brother I
[59:28] I'm just so unsure
[59:31] but I want to spend eternity in heaven
[59:34] I don't want to go to that place brother
[59:37] branham described was so
[59:44] you want to raise your hand
[59:59] but what to say
[1:00:02] I've been going down the wrong path
[1:00:05] or the wrong eternity I want to change
[1:00:08] my way now this is someone bracelet
[1:00:18] Heavenly Father
[1:00:21] Lord you saw the hands
[1:00:25] war
