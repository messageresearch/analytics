[45:12] reality and the world makes it about
[45:14] certain things but to have that reality
[45:17] in our life of God give us the most
[45:19] precious gift that he could ever give us
[45:23] and you
[45:25] know the world didn't want it the world
[45:27] didn't like the wrapping that it was
[45:29] wrapped in that's right they they they
[45:31] despised that and even in the end time
[45:33] the world didn't like the wrapping and
[45:35] I'm not just talking about the veil but
[45:36] I'm talking about even the manifestation
[45:39] of God they they didn't they didn't want
[45:40] that but you know beyond all of that I
[45:44] I'm so glad that God beyond all of the

[46:15] but it's by The Sovereign Grace of God
[46:18] well that's enough to get us
[46:20] excited and
[46:23] uh I told my wife on the way home on
[46:25] Thursday she we were going home and I
[46:28] said I am so tempted I said I'd love to
[46:31] continue on from where I'm at on
[46:34] Thursday I said I'm so tempted I said
[46:36] but I've got to obey the Lord I know
[46:38] what he put on my heart for Sunday but
[46:40] uh you know you just enjoy the the good
[46:43] things of God don't you and the Lord
[46:45] just speaks to our hearts and I you know
[46:48] I don't deserve it we don't deserve it
[46:50] but I'm so glad he comes and speaks to
[46:51] us I'm glad he works with us aren't you
[46:54] amen so it's so good to see each one of
[46:57] you and I don't want to just keep you
[46:58] standing but I I love you it's so good
[47:01] to see you see different ones back
[47:03] battling from sickness and different
[47:06] things like that and man it's so good to
[47:08] be it's good to be together amen it's
[47:11] really really good to be together so
[47:13] amen I want to say thank you to the
[47:14] musicians and uh we want to just get
[47:17] ready to turn our attention to the word
[47:18] of the Lord and if you want to uh open
[47:22] your Bibles to Philippians chapter
[47:25] 4 uh
[47:29] and I'm just going to read um I'd like
[47:31] to read um a few verses of scripture
[47:34] from
[47:35] here uh this morning and beginning with
[47:38] verse 4 and then we'll read through uh
[47:41] verse 13 and then we'll pick up from
[47:44] there
[48:02] everybody doing okay okay verse four I
[48:06] want you this is a a common scripture we
[48:09] we hear Rec
[48:12] quoted rejoice in the lord always and
[48:17] again I say rejoice now if you you
[48:20] notice what's very very key in this
[48:23] rejoice in the Lord so not only are we
[48:27] in him but our rejoicing is about him
[48:32] and in him because a lot of times
[48:34] circumstances around us the
[48:37] circumstances if we limit it to that
[48:41] there's no rejoicing in the
[48:42] circumstances but our rejoicing is in
[48:45] the Lord and that's why the rejoicing is
[48:48] all way this is not something this
[48:50] scripture is not something that you know
[48:52] we use to to get people going and get
[48:54] them worked up that's not what this
[48:55] scripture is about it's not about a
[48:57] scripture to whip or brow beat somebody
[49:00] and say hey you you know you don't need
[49:01] to be sad we we experience times of
[49:03] Gloom and other things but this is
[49:05] talking about rejoicing in the lord
[49:08] always that there is a place and in him
[49:11] and concerning him I can rejoice in him
[49:15] I cannot always rejoice in the
[49:17] surroundings that I find myself in I
[49:19] cannot always rejoice in everything I
[49:21] see around me or what I feel but I can
[49:24] rejoice in
[49:25] him that's where where the real true joy
[49:28] of the Lord comes from is the work that
[49:30] he's done in our lives Amen Let Your
[49:33] moderation be known unto all men the
[49:35] Lord is at hand be careful for nothing
[49:38] that phrase means don't be anxious but
[49:41] in everything by prayer and supplication
[49:44] with Thanksgiving let your request be
[49:47] made known unto God and the peace of God
[49:51] which passeth all understanding shall
[49:55] keep your heart hearts and Minds through
[49:59] Jesus Christ finally Brethren whatsoever
[50:02] things are true whatsoever things are
[50:04] honest whatsoever things are just
[50:07] whatsoever things are pure whatsoever
[50:09] things are lovely and whatsoever things
[50:12] are of a good report if there be any
[50:14] virtue and if there be any praise think
[50:18] on these things and if we could just
[50:20] pass everything through
[50:22] there because there's a lot of things
[50:24] that's true but it doesn't follow all
[50:26] the the
[50:27] criteria that's right a lot of things
[50:29] it's honest but it don't follow it's got
[50:31] to meet all the criteria word on top of
[50:34] word on top of word it's that's the same
[50:36] way in our lives is that right doctor's
[50:40] report comes in and it says we found
[50:42] this on the scan well that's that's
[50:44] facts but the truth is by his stripes
[50:48] I'm
[50:49] Healed facts and Truth are two different
[50:52] things is that right amen those things
[50:57] which you have both learned and received
[50:59] and heard and seen in me do and the God
[51:01] of Peace shall be with you but I
[51:03] rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at
[51:06] the last your care of me hath flourished
[51:09] again wherein you were also careful but
[51:12] you lacked opportunity not that I speak
[51:15] in respect of want for I have learned in
[51:18] whatsoever State I am in therewith to be
[51:23] content I know both how to be abased and
[51:28] I know how to abound so this is
[51:30] something that Paul has come to
[51:33] understand in his life I know how to be
[51:36] abased and I know how to abound
[51:39] everywhere in in all things I am
[51:41] instructed both to be full and to be
[51:44] hungry both to abound and to suffer need
[51:49] I can do all things through Christ which
[51:52] strengtheneth me can we read that last
[51:55] one together just a just an affirmative
[51:58] confession I can do all things through
[52:02] Christ which strengtheneth me let's just
[52:05] bow our heads Heavenly
[52:08] Father oh God you who are the word Lord
[52:13] Jesus as we just Lord bow our heads and
[52:16] our hearts Lord in your presence we
[52:19] invite you Lord that is here that you
[52:21] would come Lord and just speak to our
[52:24] hearts in a personal way Lord the things
[52:27] that you have placed upon my heart
[52:29] there's no way Lord that oh God in
[52:32] myself Lord that I can bring these
[52:34] things as you've laid it there on my
[52:36] heart so I just ask Lord that you would
[52:39] just give me Grace to get out of the way
[52:41] and Lord to enter into that same
[52:44] inspiration oh God that moved Lord for
[52:47] this here this morning Lord I pray that
[52:49] you'll take control Lord and speak to
[52:52] every heart to every need minister to
[52:54] our lives Lord in every area Lord Heal
[52:58] those that are sick among us those that
[53:00] are streaming Lord father those Lord in
[53:02] pain and discomfort Lord may you
[53:05] minister to them Lord minister to
[53:07] everyone in need Lord I pray physically
[53:10] spiritually Lord emotionally oh God may
[53:13] you Minister Lord to Body Spirit and
[53:16] soul lord right here this morning once
[53:18] again Lord pour out of your spirit Lord
[53:21] for we give Lord you all the praise
[53:23] honor and glory and just commit
[53:25] ourselves Lord Lord into your hands now
[53:28] in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen
[53:31] God bless you as you're being seated
[53:33] amen maybe turn to the person beside you
[53:36] and say God bless you bless you I don't
[53:38] know if they I don't know if they had
[53:39] you do that or not but joy God bless you
[53:41] you don't have nobody beside
[53:44] you but I want to go ahead kick it over
[53:47] for me
[53:48] please but I want to um I want to deal
[53:53] with this thought here on on hindrances
[53:55] and I want to um go just a little bit
[53:59] here upon this and it it's going to take
[54:01] me a little bit to build this but I'm
[54:03] not going to do it all in one service um
[54:06] but I want to look here a little bit
[54:07] more at hindrances and overcoming
[54:11] hindrances in our lives and you know
[54:14] when we think of this thought this is
[54:16] what I want you to be focused on on from
[54:18] the negative to the positive and I
[54:22] thinking of it in this terms you know
[54:24] when you look at it many times we've
[54:26] heard this analogy used and everything
[54:28] is based on perception sometimes even
[54:31] experiences sometimes it can be even
[54:33] where we are presently uh sitting and
[54:37] sometimes you know you you could ask a
[54:39] person what do you see and someone could
[54:41] say well I see a glass that's half empty
[54:43] and or someone else could say well I see
[54:45] it's it's that's half full I mean it's
[54:49] it depends on how you're looking at it
[54:50] so perception is everything and so
[54:53] listen when we understand that when
[54:55] we've come here into this into this life
[54:59] you and I came through and by that that
[55:02] sexual birth that first birth and that's
[55:05] that's a negative there our lives are
[55:08] surrounded by negative there's negative
[55:11] all around us we experience negative you
[55:14] know you get if you you know you you
[55:15] find yourself you know you're growing
[55:17] and you're eating and everything and
[55:19] then all of a sudden you get to about
[55:21] the age of 25 and my things start
[55:23] happening and you know aches start
[55:25] happening and you some of us are eating
[55:27] better than we did before and you know
[55:29] things just aren't happening and and we
[55:31] you know it it but it's all it's all
[55:33] that and itself is all in the negative
[55:36] but you see all of that is that God
[55:38] himself before the foundation of the
[55:40] world he already made up his photo album
[55:44] he's not like you or I where we have
[55:46] pictures of our children and they're
[55:48] going from you know when they were born
[55:50] and you know they look like a red plump
[55:53] melon and then they're going from here
[55:55] or or what have and they're going up but
[55:57] God in his family album God doesn't have
[56:01] a picture of us in any of our uh
[56:04] mistakes or our failures or our flaws
[56:08] but God himself he took a picture of you
[56:11] and I before the foundation of the world
[56:13] the Bible said the lamb was slain before
[56:16] the foundation of world there was a
[56:18] reason that the lamb was slain in the
[56:20] mind of God the Bible tells us in the
[56:23] Book of Job that here it was that when
[56:25] the sons of God God shouted for joy and
[56:28] so here that we understand that God in
[56:32] his album he's already took a picture of
[56:34] you and I of what we were at our best
[56:37] and somewhere between that 18 and 21
[56:40] year age I always kind of you know I I
[56:42] don't want to joke but I always thought
[56:44] I thought well I hope it's closer to 18
[56:46] cuz my hair started turning loose when I
[56:48] was 17 so I want to you know but God
[56:51] knows he knows all about it you know and
[56:53] you know it's one thing for sure brother
[56:55] Brandon would say say you know if you're
[56:57] a blonde here you're that's what you're
[56:59] going to be over there if you're a a
[57:01] brunette here you're going to be a
[57:03] brunette over there so it's not all of a
[57:05] sudden that when then when the changes
[57:07] come that when our body has changed oh
[57:09] my I'm going to you know I'm not going
[57:11] to be this anymore I'm not going to be
[57:13] that anymore it's a changing back to
[57:16] what God had in his mind before the
[57:18] foundation of the world as a son and
[57:20] daughter of God and all of the
[57:23] imperfections and all of the negative
[57:26] will have been done away with and it
[57:28] will be fully developed into the
[57:31] positive amen so from that time so until
[57:35] that time here we are walking in this
[57:38] journey in this life of where we are
[57:41] where we experience and surrounded often
[57:44] times by the negative and the negative
[57:47] sometimes is what we can see and what we
[57:49] can feel even in our own being it can
[57:52] things that we can even look at
[57:54] sometimes in our own in our own lives
[57:56] our own failures our own mistakes and
[57:58] then we can look at that and we get to
[58:00] looking at that those are the things
[58:02] that will cause us to become unsteady or
[58:04] questioning and remember what's key is
[58:07] our perception and our perception is is
[58:09] what we're looking at and the spirit of
[58:12] God just comes to dial Us in to the
[58:14] right things on how to look at the right
[58:17] thing because you know what the negative
[58:20] here uh you can go through so many
[58:22] things and oh I'm just going to think
[58:24] positive what does that mean
[58:27] well you could say well thinking
[58:28] positive means that glass is half full
[58:30] but if we think down to a real a real
[58:33] place of overcoming there's only one
[58:36] source that's positive and that's the
[58:39] word of God heavens and earth will pass
[58:41] away so then we want our thoughts to be
[58:45] based on the word of God and any thought
[58:48] that comes in we want to pass it through
[58:52] the
[58:53] word is that all right now notice
[58:56] brother BR says this here in Victory Day
[58:58] He said it seems like the Christian Life
[59:01] if the fellow is not absolutely centered
[59:04] on Christ the Christian life seems like
[59:08] it holds so many
[59:10] disappointments but those
[59:12] disappointments are God's Divine will
[59:15] happening for us now it don't seem like
[59:18] it would be that but it's God's way of
[59:21] doing things he lets us hit the river to
[59:25] see what we'll do
[59:26] do so the key is is that life that is
[59:32] can not be so centered upon Christ and
[59:35] and then it just seemed like everything
[59:37] is such a disappointment but once that
[59:39] life is centered on Christ and you have
[59:42] to maintain your Focus On Christ This
[59:45] World Satan and all of his imps
[59:48] everything around is busy to try to get
[59:51] your focus and my focus off of the thing
[59:55] that really matters and that is the word
[59:58] of
[59:58] God the word of God matters more than my
[1:00:02] feelings the word of God is more than my
[1:00:05] surroundings because all these things
[1:00:07] right here will pass away let me just
[1:00:09] tell you this right now the trial you're
[1:00:11] in is not a permanent
[1:00:14] residence don't have them forward the
[1:00:17] mail to the trial you're in right now
[1:00:19] you are just passing through like like
[1:00:23] like David wrote in Psalms 84 where
[1:00:26] passing through the valley of baka we
[1:00:28] are on our way to the translation of the
[1:00:31] body we are on our way with this is not
[1:00:35] our final resting
[1:00:38] place and I'm grateful for God's grace
[1:00:41] this is why when we come to the house of
[1:00:43] God you know as we're sitting here you
[1:00:46] can't push stop on me you can't fast
[1:00:48] forward me you can't remind me I mean
[1:00:50] you can get up and walk out but you
[1:00:52] can't stop any of that you can you can't
[1:00:54] push play or pause you can't do that and
[1:00:57] what I'm trying to say is is that as you
[1:00:59] come and sat right here you are waiting
[1:01:02] on God to come and speak to your life
[1:01:04] and let's just be honest sometimes when
[1:01:06] we come here we're not in the best frame
[1:01:08] of mind we have walked through things
[1:01:11] throughout the weak this seems like the
[1:01:13] negativity and everything that is so far
[1:01:16] around us we need help from one who is
[1:01:19] greater than us and we need help from a
[1:01:22] positive Source that'll come down and
[1:01:25] minister is word and by the power of the
[1:01:27] Holy Ghost will take our mind and put it
[1:01:30] on things of where it needs to be that's
[1:01:32] the help we we get from God now I'm not
[1:01:35] talking about not playing tapes you
[1:01:37] understand what I'm saying because you
[1:01:38] can be at your house and putting on a
[1:01:40] tape and then you can get such a place
[1:01:42] you won't even put a tape on but you
[1:01:44] walk out of here you walk out of here
[1:01:47] when you come into the presence of God
[1:01:49] right here then as you walk out of here
[1:01:51] what is God doing encouraging you in
[1:01:53] your daily walk with him
[1:01:56] and then you're in the message then
[1:01:58] you're praying then you've got strength
[1:02:00] to carry on is that right God works in
[1:02:04] that way so we're not just coming here
[1:02:06] that we would become uh smarter people
[1:02:09] sure God imparts knowledge by divine
[1:02:11] revelation but he's also here to
[1:02:14] encourage you and I and he works in so
[1:02:16] many different ways throughout a service
[1:02:19] God like he brought Israel up to the
[1:02:21] place of the Red Sea and he wanted to
[1:02:23] see what they were going to do and he
[1:02:25] told speak H don't cry to me speak that
[1:02:28] the children would go forward and the
[1:02:30] Red Sea opened them up it opened up then
[1:02:33] we find that even within you know when
[1:02:36] something is has happened and and
[1:02:37] sickness has happened and and you know
[1:02:39] someone backsliding or something that
[1:02:42] has happened but to come right to that
[1:02:44] place and speak the word of God and move
[1:02:47] forward and God will perform his word I
[1:02:51] want you to think of this here in 2
[1:02:53] Corinthians chapter 4 Paul said we have
[1:02:56] this treasure in Earth and vessels
[1:02:58] what's he talking about what treasure is
[1:03:00] he talking about he's talking about
[1:03:03] God's own life that's the treasure in
[1:03:06] earn frail vessels that the Excellency
[1:03:10] of the power may be of God and not of us
[1:03:14] we are troubled on every side yet not
[1:03:17] distressed that's
[1:03:19] negative yeah that's good right we're
[1:03:21] troubled on every side but the positive
[1:03:24] is we're not distressed amen
[1:03:27] see I'm not going to let the negative
[1:03:29] where my sentence the end of it be
[1:03:33] negative come on Friends notice he says
[1:03:38] persecuted but not
[1:03:40] forsaken so another words I'm not
[1:03:42] ignoring circumstances but I'm just
[1:03:44] going to tell you this I'm persecuted
[1:03:46] but I'm not forsaken he said he never
[1:03:48] leave me nor forsake
[1:03:51] me so it's gone from negative to
[1:03:53] positive notice he said said cast down
[1:03:57] but I'm not destroyed always bearing
[1:04:00] about in the body the dying of the Lord
[1:04:02] Jesus that the life also of Jesus might
[1:04:07] be made manifest in our body so the
[1:04:10] trials the tests that God In His
[1:04:13] Infinite Wisdom allows to come our way
[1:04:15] they are tailor made for our lives
[1:04:18] because God is Desiring to get out of us
[1:04:21] what he knows lays within
[1:04:24] us that's why always bearing about in
[1:04:27] the body the life of Jesus Christ for we
[1:04:31] which live are always delivered unto
[1:04:34] death for Jesus sake that the life also
[1:04:38] of Jesus might be made manifest in our
[1:04:42] mortal bodies and Paul goes on to say
[1:04:45] for all things are for your sakes that
[1:04:47] the abundant grace might through the
[1:04:50] Thanksgiving of many redown to the glory
[1:04:53] of God for which cause we faint not but
[1:04:57] though our outward man perish yet the
[1:05:00] inward man is renewed day by day what a
[1:05:05] contrast outward man is perishing then
[1:05:07] inward man is being
[1:05:10] renewed so this outward Madness is
[1:05:13] feeling the effects and you know of all
[1:05:15] the tests and all the trials and look it
[1:05:17] doesn't take very long I mean I I look
[1:05:20] I'll just say it for myself I look at
[1:05:21] pictures of myself and I see wrinkles
[1:05:23] that I never saw before
[1:05:26] and if I let my hair grow on the sides
[1:05:28] right here it's it's it's
[1:05:30] white thank
[1:05:34] you but I look I look at things that
[1:05:37] when I when I see it and and you know we
[1:05:40] we see things that when we go through
[1:05:42] the pressures the tri look when the Lord
[1:05:44] Jesus was here he was thought to be a
[1:05:47] man not more than 50 years old he wasn't
[1:05:51] even close to 50 years
[1:05:53] old it was the pressure the burden that
[1:05:56] he was bearing the outward man was
[1:06:00] perishing but the inward man that was
[1:06:03] the truth that was the reality that that
[1:06:05] inward man on the inside was the
[1:06:07] strength
[1:06:09] Giver it's the same way in our lives in
[1:06:12] our in our walk with God for our light
[1:06:15] Affliction notice how Paul could say
[1:06:17] this I I'll just be honest you probably
[1:06:19] throw tomatoes at me if I made that
[1:06:20] statement or light Affliction but nobody
[1:06:22] can throw tomatoes at
[1:06:24] Paul you know what I mean because Paul
[1:06:27] ain't making light or simple of the
[1:06:29] things that we go through let me tell
[1:06:31] you the things you go through the things
[1:06:33] I go through they are personal the
[1:06:35] trials are to bring more of Christ out
[1:06:38] of
[1:06:40] us that's what trials are for they're
[1:06:43] experiences to bring more of God out of
[1:06:46] us now notice for our light Affliction
[1:06:48] which is but for a moment worketh for us
[1:06:52] a far more exceeding and Eternal weight
[1:06:56] of Glory while we look not at the things
[1:07:00] which are seen But at the things which
[1:07:03] are not seen for the things which are
[1:07:06] seen are temporal but the things which
[1:07:08] are not seen are Eternal aren't you glad
[1:07:12] that the Holy Spirit has anointed your
[1:07:15] eyesight and anoints our eyes to see
[1:07:19] beyond temporal things of this
[1:07:22] Earth and there's you know what it is
[1:07:24] there's a strength cuz you see once you
[1:07:26] have seen and recognized and caught a
[1:07:29] vision of the Living God it stabilizes
[1:07:32] you it's a stabilization that's deeper
[1:07:35] than your mind it's deeper than your
[1:07:37] spirit it's what's there on the inside
[1:07:39] there's an anchor that anchors within
[1:07:41] the veil it holds you amidst even when
[1:07:44] your reasoning is gone when the prophet
[1:07:47] was standing there and the Satan told
[1:07:49] him said look at everything you've done
[1:07:51] for him look at everything that's
[1:07:52] happened he's took your wife took your
[1:07:54] little baby and brother BR said at about
[1:07:56] that time I was getting ready to say if
[1:08:00] that's how he's going to be he said but
[1:08:02] oh there was something down on the
[1:08:05] inside that new birth that spoke up in
[1:08:08] that time and said yay though he slay
[1:08:11] me I'll trust
[1:08:16] him it's something that's greater that's
[1:08:18] within us and you I think we can
[1:08:20] Fellowship on that through things that
[1:08:22] we go through that you you recognize
[1:08:25] that something deeper there's something
[1:08:27] greater there's something more and
[1:08:29] there's even how the spirit of God will
[1:08:32] come and work in our lives in a service
[1:08:36] and God anointing our sight that we
[1:08:39] would not walk by the things of this
[1:08:42] world or of this Earth but we would walk
[1:08:45] by that sight which is called Faith to
[1:08:47] be able to see the victory to be able to
[1:08:50] see what God has for
[1:08:53] us watch this go God comes down he he
[1:08:56] comes to change our perceptions of
[1:09:00] looking at things let me just say this
[1:09:03] to you that even when the spirit of God
[1:09:05] has come into our lives we still need
[1:09:09] the ongoing working of the holy spirit
[1:09:11] in the renewing of our mind changing our
[1:09:16] perceptions changing our outlooks on
[1:09:19] things is that right I'm just dropping
[1:09:23] this in here he said now because I want
[1:09:24] you to think that little Eagle the
[1:09:26] prophet said that little Eagle that
[1:09:27] walked along in that barnyard down there
[1:09:30] he he was told he was a chicken that's
[1:09:31] what he was told all he saw was you know
[1:09:34] them putting out the chicken feed and
[1:09:36] this that's all he knew and he was
[1:09:39] taught to look down because chickens
[1:09:42] look down they're going to get their
[1:09:44] food but when that Mama eagle flew over
[1:09:47] who knew she had an eagle
[1:09:52] somewhere he was always an eagle
[1:09:56] Hallelujah you and I were always Sons
[1:09:59] and Daughters of
[1:10:01] God right but they had to we had to have
[1:10:05] a personal contact with the Living God
[1:10:09] that would change from where we're
[1:10:11] looking to look up to him and then
[1:10:14] receive Grace to escape what we were
[1:10:17] born
[1:10:20] into this is why it's very clear this is
[1:10:23] why the word of God it it never
[1:10:26] expresses that you will become a son and
[1:10:29] daughter of God you always were a son
[1:10:31] and daughter of God the Bible said in
[1:10:33] Galatians 4 because ye are Sons he hath
[1:10:37] sent forth his Spirit into your
[1:10:40] hearts is that right so a son and
[1:10:42] daughter of God it's allowing the spirit
[1:10:44] of God comes to minister to you and I
[1:10:47] what our rights are this is why serving
[1:10:50] God is so much deeper than just coming
[1:10:52] to church it's yet that's a part of it
[1:10:55] but it's it's deeper than belonging to
[1:10:57] an affiliation or or just you know a
[1:10:59] mental recognition but the reality of it
[1:11:03] is is a relationship with God where God
[1:11:06] brings you and I back to that rightful
[1:11:09] position as a son and daughter of God
[1:11:12] this is why the scriptures I love the
[1:11:14] scripture Psalms 82:6 I have said ye are
[1:11:18] God's and all of you are children of the
[1:11:21] most high that's good that's a good one
[1:11:24] Jesus refers back to this it's a
[1:11:26] powerful chapter but Jesus refers back
[1:11:29] to it in John chapter 10 and he says is
[1:11:31] it not written in your law I said ye are
[1:11:34] gods and if he called them Gods unto
[1:11:37] whom the word of God came then the
[1:11:39] scripture cannot be broken now notice
[1:11:41] when Jesus is referring to this here in
[1:11:44] John chapter 10 he's speaking of how
[1:11:46] that the word would come to the prophets
[1:11:49] but let me ask you the question when the
[1:11:51] word comes to the prophets why does God
[1:11:53] send the word to a prophet
[1:11:56] he sends the word to the prophet because
[1:12:00] there are people that are ordained to
[1:12:03] hear what that Prophet has to say that
[1:12:06] Prophet is just like this microphone
[1:12:08] that I have on this microphone has no
[1:12:11] thoughts of its
[1:12:13] own but a prophet I'm just working with
[1:12:15] this with the young people there on
[1:12:17] Friday on prophets but you recognize
[1:12:19] what a prophet is a prophet is not
[1:12:22] someone who where God is just speaking
[1:12:24] to to him as though to tell him
[1:12:26] something new that's not what a prophet
[1:12:28] is but a prophet is caught up into the
[1:12:32] Realms of God's thinking and he hears
[1:12:35] what God has already
[1:12:38] said he hears it those words are going
[1:12:41] around and God brings him up into here
[1:12:44] that when Isaiah spoke he said he was
[1:12:48] wounded it hadn't even happen but he
[1:12:50] spoke of it in a past tense already
[1:12:53] Declaration of the coming of the Messiah
[1:12:56] why because when God speaks any word it
[1:12:59] is
[1:13:01] finished nothing can alter that word
[1:13:05] that's right that's right nothing can
[1:13:07] change that word that's right oh and you
[1:13:11] and I were always a part of that word
[1:13:14] that's right Satan wanted to alter and
[1:13:17] change and tried to scruple up a lot of
[1:13:20] things in our first birth and
[1:13:22] experiences and things that happened to
[1:13:24] us but although he can try to deface the
[1:13:28] outside he cannot disturb the written
[1:13:32] evidence that's been sealed on the
[1:13:37] inside you can change the open evidence
[1:13:41] but the evidence that's been sealed on
[1:13:43] the inside you can't touch
[1:13:46] it that's so
[1:13:49] good
[1:13:50] hallelujah hallelujah that can be
[1:13:52] interpreted in many different ways on
[1:13:54] what the outside you're this you're that
[1:13:56] you're this but God comes to let us know
[1:13:58] who we really are that's is why it
[1:14:02] matters the word that we're setting
[1:14:04] under God never called called us to just
[1:14:08] be you know as church members or or to
[1:14:10] take up some name and well we're this
[1:14:12] and we're that well you know I'm a I'm
[1:14:15] Methodist or I'm Lutheran or I'm
[1:14:16] Pentecostal or I'm just a message
[1:14:19] believer I'm not I'm nothing wrong with
[1:14:22] with walking in light but my point is is
[1:14:24] that that life's got to be inside of us
[1:14:26] and God brings a word to you and I to
[1:14:29] let us know who we really are brother
[1:14:32] there's nothing that can push back the
[1:14:34] negative in our life like the positive
[1:14:36] raise of the s o
[1:14:39] n watch out brother BR says this here in
[1:14:41] the uncertain sound he said we've got to
[1:14:44] tell him he's a Son of God born for the
[1:14:47] kingdom of God he is somebody this is
[1:14:50] just a negative a picture a negative
[1:14:54] waiting for it to be developed someday
[1:14:58] he said when you die out to yourself a
[1:15:01] new
[1:15:02] picture starts on the inside key word
[1:15:06] starts on the inside a new picture
[1:15:09] starts on the inside and then that new
[1:15:12] creature Christ Jesus begins to show
[1:15:15] itself through and one of these days he
[1:15:18] will come to receive you up to himself
[1:15:20] then the whole thing will be changed and
[1:15:22] then this negative shadow
[1:15:25] will become a
[1:15:28] positive though it's developing the
[1:15:31] picture now just for just for us to
[1:15:34] revisit and probably for the young
[1:15:36] people CU When I say camera they think
[1:15:38] of iPads
[1:15:40] iPhones and
[1:15:42] phones but you know there's such a thing
[1:15:44] called a camera and we'd put in we'd put
[1:15:46] in phone and I know there's there's also
[1:15:48] you know photographers that will still
[1:15:49] use this method and so here it comes
[1:15:52] there's you know that that role of film
[1:15:54] starts like this and then it'll you know
[1:15:56] you you put it in there in the camera
[1:15:58] and you start taking pictures and what's
[1:16:00] happening is is there's actually images
[1:16:04] that is actually being captured through
[1:16:06] the lens of the camera and th those
[1:16:09] images are being put in a negative form
[1:16:12] now I want you to catch this the picture
[1:16:14] is taken of a positive image the picture
[1:16:18] taken of a positive image it comes onto
[1:16:21] a negative but the negative then is
[1:16:24] submitted to develop the picture of the
[1:16:27] positive that was
[1:16:29] taken I didn't lose you did I so if
[1:16:32] there is the negative on that on the
[1:16:35] here in this life then there had to be a
[1:16:38] positive somewhere else where you and I
[1:16:42] were always Sons and Daughters of God
[1:16:44] and God took a picture you and I were
[1:16:48] Sons and Daughters of God and he
[1:16:50] submitted here that seed of God here
[1:16:53] that is placed in our life and we're
[1:16:55] surrounded by the negative but here here
[1:16:59] in the midst of our life there's a
[1:17:00] transforming that's going on a picture
[1:17:03] is being developed what's that picture
[1:17:06] that's the picture that's according to
[1:17:08] his
[1:17:10] mind it's just like this you know you
[1:17:14] see this right here how many of you ever
[1:17:15] looked at just
[1:17:17] negatives yes was it
[1:17:19] fun no I mean if I if you call me over
[1:17:22] your house brother R Say Hey I want to
[1:17:23] show you some picture when I was little
[1:17:25] boy I might even stop there but but when
[1:17:27] he shows me over and says hey and all I
[1:17:30] see is negatives that is not going to be
[1:17:32] fun right right that ain't going to be
[1:17:35] fun I mean I've tried to look back at
[1:17:36] certain negatives you ever have a bunch
[1:17:38] of negatives messed up and you got to
[1:17:40] put them back in the right kind of put
[1:17:41] them back in the right pouch trying to
[1:17:43] match them up with the right packet of
[1:17:45] pictures it's hard work you know why you
[1:17:48] don't see the details there very clearly
[1:17:51] and that's how God was through the Old
[1:17:53] Testament it was Parts being revealed
[1:17:56] down through those ages down through the
[1:18:00] prophets but when he became manifested
[1:18:03] when the he stepped forward as the son
[1:18:06] himself then the negative was developed
[1:18:09] into the positive it was him in Jeremiah
[1:18:13] it was him in Isaiah he was he is the
[1:18:16] Bible never said he was but it says he
[1:18:18] is despised and rejected of all men he
[1:18:20] was despised in Noah he was despised in
[1:18:23] Elijah he was despised in Elisha all of
[1:18:26] them were
[1:18:29] parts that when it was
[1:18:31] developed It produced hallu Jesus
[1:18:36] Christ so to look at this uh this on the
[1:18:39] right I'd much rather now when we
[1:18:41] talking looking at a family album I look
[1:18:43] at these pictures right here this is
[1:18:45] what I like to see it's kind of hard to
[1:18:46] see them
[1:18:49] details right you take this even here
[1:18:53] that's a slide looks pretty fun don't
[1:18:56] it but look over here look at them
[1:18:58] pictures if I gave you that picture
[1:19:00] you're looking at you're
[1:19:02] like I don't know you can't really tell
[1:19:05] what really well it might be a bright
[1:19:07] day it might be but over here when that
[1:19:09] negative is developed it's a
[1:19:12] positive that's the same thing it is
[1:19:15] within our
[1:19:16] lives from here from the negative to the
[1:19:21] positive now I want you to think about
[1:19:23] this when God comes
[1:19:25] in the Holy Spirit comes into our
[1:19:29] life through and by the transforming
[1:19:33] power of the Holy Spirit remember in
[1:19:35] order to take these negatives and make a
[1:19:38] positive the picture it's got to pass
[1:19:41] through a dark room right some of us
[1:19:44] maybe took that in high school where you
[1:19:45] had to take photography or if you took
[1:19:47] it as elective so you didn't have to set
[1:19:48] in study hall or something like that and
[1:19:50] you and you took that and there was
[1:19:52] there was you know there was in bends
[1:19:54] you got to put it in this bin for a
[1:19:55] while and then going take it up put it
[1:19:56] in this bin for a while and then put it
[1:19:58] back down in here and put it back down
[1:19:59] in there has a lot of work makes me want
[1:20:02] to say thank God for
[1:20:04] phones it was a lot of work but it was
[1:20:07] the it was the it was the chemicals that
[1:20:11] would cause the
[1:20:13] development that would bring that all
[1:20:16] all to pass within there and that's what
[1:20:19] the Holy Spirit does in our life it
[1:20:23] develops that negative that that seed
[1:20:26] that God has put on the inside and here
[1:20:29] is the positive and the positive is
[1:20:32] still encased in a lot of negative
[1:20:36] that's all around us that we have to
[1:20:38] deal with day by day but what's
[1:20:42] important is is the positive experience
[1:20:46] from a positive God gives a positive
[1:20:49] token that's what is the positive that
[1:20:52] will lead to eventually everything our
[1:20:56] body our spirit everything will come
[1:20:58] together glorify theoy and with that
[1:21:01] Soul what y brother says this in Christ
[1:21:03] he says he says what they meant to those
[1:21:06] people in type what what it ought to
[1:21:08] mean us in the antitype what they done
[1:21:10] under the law and what could we do with
[1:21:12] it today under the baptism of the Holy
[1:21:14] Spirit if they had the shadow we got the
[1:21:17] positive they had the negative we've got
[1:21:20] the positive they have the they had the
[1:21:23] picture in a negative we've got it in a
[1:21:26] positive after it's been developed at
[1:21:29] Calvary and we went to Calvary with the
[1:21:34] lamb is that right and every believer
[1:21:37] that comes to Christ must come to the
[1:21:40] same Cross of self-denial and die there
[1:21:43] with the Lamb with his lamb die out to
[1:21:46] our own thoughts die out to your own
[1:21:48] mental thinking and just take what the
[1:21:51] holy spirit says in your heart and then
[1:21:54] live for
[1:21:56] Christ so then when the new birth is
[1:21:59] come you know because the thought can
[1:22:01] come and is like it was with the Lord
[1:22:03] Jesus and say you know what good could
[1:22:05] come out of Nazareth well if we're just
[1:22:07] thinking about Nazareth it's the most
[1:22:08] meanest City there was but we weren't
[1:22:11] talking about just of a Nazarene he was
[1:22:14] there that it might be fulfilled as the
[1:22:17] scripture said he was a Nazarene but he
[1:22:20] was he was an identity that was beyond
[1:22:22] that of a Nazarene look they might look
[1:22:25] in your neighborhood where you live and
[1:22:26] say what good could come out of there
[1:22:28] but we're not talking about fleshly
[1:22:31] associations we're talking about that
[1:22:33] which is of
[1:22:35] god and you could look at your life or
[1:22:37] look at my life and think what could
[1:22:39] have ever come out of his
[1:22:41] life oh yeah I remember I remember the
[1:22:44] conversations of of things not that it
[1:22:46] was conversations that I heard but it
[1:22:47] was passed on bed on to me oh you know
[1:22:50] you know what what's going to come out
[1:22:52] of his life and and things like that and
[1:22:54] you know
[1:22:55] had things that I I knew I knew I knew
[1:22:56] teachers knew different things and they
[1:22:58] you know kind of want to make little
[1:22:59] jids and stuff like that in the
[1:23:01] classroom and and so forth I I
[1:23:03] understood all that but you know what I
[1:23:05] knew there's one thing about it I'm glad
[1:23:07] that he came down and he sought me out
[1:23:10] and he did something for me that no man
[1:23:13] could do I couldn't bring it out of
[1:23:15] myself you can't make yourself a
[1:23:17] Christian it's God himself who comes
[1:23:20] down and declares himself in your life
[1:23:24] you you and I are his
[1:23:28] workmanship this is why Satan always
[1:23:30] wants to try to bring frustration when
[1:23:32] we're trying to do something trying to
[1:23:34] do something and I I keep failing all
[1:23:36] we're seeing is the negative that's
[1:23:38] around us but if you can just let go and
[1:23:41] let the positive God by a positive word
[1:23:45] say Lord move into the depths of my life
[1:23:48] oh God blow everything else out of the
[1:23:51] way how many of you know that bridge
[1:23:53] that they built over there in Australia
[1:23:55] brother Ram talks about it many times
[1:23:57] and there were men that would not take
[1:23:58] that job up to build it between those
[1:24:01] two places that island in the mainland
[1:24:03] there in Australia there are many men
[1:24:05] said it can't be done but there was one
[1:24:07] man he had a reputation and he told him
[1:24:10] he said I'll take the job he said you're
[1:24:12] you're crazy he said let me have it but
[1:24:16] he went over there and he blasted beyond
[1:24:19] all the sand he went down beneath all
[1:24:23] that was there in that water floor and
[1:24:25] he blasted it all out until he got down
[1:24:28] to the Rock that's so you know why
[1:24:30] because that you couldn't build on
[1:24:32] anything else and this is why the Holy
[1:24:35] Spirit it goes down it's a blasting away
[1:24:38] of our thoughts it's a blasting away of
[1:24:40] our habits it's a blasting away of
[1:24:43] desires you know what he's doing he's
[1:24:44] getting down to the
[1:24:47] inside because that inside the prophet
[1:24:50] said is that foundation stone he placed
[1:24:53] in you and to be a son and daughter of
[1:24:56] God he builds his Revelation upon that
[1:25:00] part of himself which is a son and
[1:25:02] daughter of God that's right yes sir so
[1:25:04] I say holy spirit Blow Away Lord Blast
[1:25:08] away everything Lord that's unlike you
[1:25:10] and let it be founded and when that man
[1:25:12] came they might have thought he was a
[1:25:13] bragard they might have thought this guy
[1:25:15] nothing but a boastful guy but he told
[1:25:18] him he said I want this bridge filled I
[1:25:21] want Locomotion locomotives on this
[1:25:23] bridge I want semis on this bridge I
[1:25:26] want it full when we open it not just
[1:25:29] passing over it brother Ryan filled with
[1:25:31] traffic setting on it yeah you know why
[1:25:34] he was confident in his work you know
[1:25:37] why he was confident because of what
[1:25:39] they couldn't see what was beneath the
[1:25:41] surface he had hit rock and that's why
[1:25:43] in your life you might think I don't
[1:25:45] know if I could take this or I could
[1:25:47] take that but when it's founded on the
[1:25:49] rock where are you resting you're
[1:25:50] resting on the rock of a solid
[1:25:53] experience in Jesus Christ that you
[1:25:56] can't get away from even if you tried
[1:26:00] to oh my I'm talking about the positive
[1:26:04] this morning yes you are yes you are
[1:26:06] hallelujah oh my so we've got a new
[1:26:10] parent now a new parent and everybody
[1:26:13] knows you know you you have a in your
[1:26:16] parent what does our parents do will
[1:26:18] they guide us right it it all changes as
[1:26:22] as we go I mean you know eventually it
[1:26:24] got things that you know as as my dad
[1:26:26] and them would they work with me and
[1:26:28] well don't touch this it's hot and you
[1:26:30] know they're trying to cover things up
[1:26:32] things you know all of a sudden you know
[1:26:34] for long you don't have no furniture in
[1:26:35] the house for long it's like let's just
[1:26:38] take away the walls and we'll just have
[1:26:41] tents you understand what I'm saying
[1:26:43] we're just trying to protect all the
[1:26:45] bruises and things getting knocked out
[1:26:46] and everything else we are padding on
[1:26:48] the corner man why didn't they have some
[1:26:49] as St when we were
[1:26:51] younger might have saved me from some
[1:26:53] knots on my head but you see as as a
[1:26:57] little boy there's times I would
[1:26:59] fall but Dad would come down and pick me
[1:27:02] up he would he would reach down with his
[1:27:03] hand and and there were times when I
[1:27:05] started to ride that bike I looked at
[1:27:07] that with training wheels man that was
[1:27:08] all right but then all of a sudden when
[1:27:10] it came time to ride without training
[1:27:12] wheels I don't know about
[1:27:15] that I don't know about that Hey listen
[1:27:17] Hey listen I I didn't have the privilege
[1:27:19] to ride on a sidewalk I was raised in
[1:27:22] the country and it was gravel driveway
[1:27:24] just like this was out here so trying to
[1:27:26] ride the the bike on that that was an
[1:27:28] extra
[1:27:30] challenge but think about it here was
[1:27:32] dad you know on the back of it back you
[1:27:34] know and you feel pretty good you can
[1:27:36] you can feel you know Dad holding on but
[1:27:38] all of a sudden what dad's objective is
[1:27:40] is to get me confident as his he is
[1:27:43] there that to get me confident and that
[1:27:45] ability and those things begin to grow
[1:27:47] and establish in my life but you know
[1:27:49] what sometimes it might have taken a day
[1:27:52] sometimes it took days sometimes maybe
[1:27:53] it took weeks I don't know but you know
[1:27:56] at at either point we have transitions
[1:27:58] in our journey and as we're
[1:28:01] growing and that sometimes as the
[1:28:04] growing you all and I remember exactly
[1:28:07] where it's at we're at times where we
[1:28:09] were as 5 years old and you're like man
[1:28:11] if I can only be
[1:28:13] 10 man why' I got to be five you know
[1:28:17] some of us you know you couldn't ride
[1:28:19] the rides at a certain height I won't
[1:28:22] say no more but then then you have then
[1:28:25] then you have as time goes on you know
[1:28:27] you come into certain times you're like
[1:28:28] man I shoot I can't wait till I'm 16 I
[1:28:31] can get my driver's permit then after a
[1:28:33] while you get your driver's permit you
[1:28:35] know and that's just a one thing to do
[1:28:37] and you know somebody's there to guide
[1:28:38] you and help you you don't just go out
[1:28:40] and say Hey I want a driver's permit no
[1:28:43] you got to take a test right you got to
[1:28:46] study a book about a bunch of laws
[1:28:48] memorize it you got to pass a signs test
[1:28:51] and all of these things you know all
[1:28:53] those all those situ ations
[1:28:55] right and then you have to ride if
[1:28:58] you're under 18 you've got to have
[1:29:00] training from a school somewhere plus 50
[1:29:04] hours with an adult that signs off on an
[1:29:07] affidavit ask me why I know that so well
[1:29:09] right
[1:29:10] now that's so good but it just don't
[1:29:13] happen you don't just say hey you know
[1:29:15] what I feel like driving it's a
[1:29:18] process it's a
[1:29:20] process and then even as you get your
[1:29:23] drivers like well when you get your
[1:29:25] driver's license do you ride away say
[1:29:27] soon as you get your driver's license
[1:29:28] I'm going to take off and man I'm going
[1:29:30] to Los Angeles I don't think so there's
[1:29:32] places you've never drove through yet
[1:29:34] right City Driving is allog together
[1:29:37] different y right and I'm not talking
[1:29:40] about lorine lorine City and it's it's
[1:29:41] Unique in itself believe me but you know
[1:29:44] uh you know but but still when you go to
[1:29:46] other places it's it's a different story
[1:29:48] when you pass through all those things
[1:29:50] listen what I if you can catch what I'm
[1:29:51] trying to get to here is it's the same
[1:29:53] way that God works with our life there's
[1:29:56] changes that are taking place as he's
[1:29:59] working with us but sometimes we get
[1:30:02] frustrated with where we are
[1:30:06] at true let me just tell you frustration
[1:30:09] itself is never of God and it's never
[1:30:11] God's business to try to frustrate us
[1:30:14] that's that's but God's working with us
[1:30:16] right now to prepare us for that next
[1:30:20] moment this is why the scripture says i'
[1:30:22] I've got to hurry here this this is why
[1:30:24] the scripture said that you must be born
[1:30:28] again is that right John 3 you must be
[1:30:31] born again if you you're not born again
[1:30:32] you can't even see the kingdom of God
[1:30:35] and in verse 5 it said except a man be
[1:30:37] born of water and spirit he cannot even
[1:30:40] enter into into the kingdom of God so to
[1:30:43] understand the kingdom of God the
[1:30:45] blueprints to know what God desires of
[1:30:47] your life to understand all of that to
[1:30:50] actually even come into the kingdom of
[1:30:53] God you must come by the water and the
[1:30:55] Spirit by the word the new birth is not
[1:30:58] something that we just grow into the new
[1:31:02] birth is an event an experience that
[1:31:06] takes place in our life so good how many
[1:31:09] of you have pictures from when your
[1:31:10] children children or child was
[1:31:12] little only about five of you two of you
[1:31:15] okay you got you got pictures right do
[1:31:17] they look the same now no they don't
[1:31:20] they Everything's changed it changes
[1:31:21] right even as they start going through
[1:31:23] different things they start they start
[1:31:24] changing things start developing so when
[1:31:27] they're born they don't all of a sudden
[1:31:28] start out fully mature now I know I know
[1:31:31] I know I know I know I know when they
[1:31:33] get to be 13 years old hey they can tell
[1:31:36] the president what to
[1:31:38] do Ain't It Funny friend listen to me
[1:31:41] ain't it funny that even even sometimes
[1:31:45] even in our spiritual walk with God
[1:31:48] where you and I listen we don't we don't
[1:31:50] skip toddlerhood we don't you don't skip
[1:31:53] the birth is that right you don't skip
[1:31:55] the birth you crawl you start walking
[1:31:57] you're a toddler come on now it's the
[1:31:59] same thing Jesus is using this he never
[1:32:02] said when a man becomes born again he
[1:32:04] becomes a fully matured Son of God it's
[1:32:07] a
[1:32:08] process is that right it's working on
[1:32:11] that's why it's working on in our lives
[1:32:13] that's why we start out with the milk of
[1:32:15] the
[1:32:17] word right as we're growing I'm talking
[1:32:21] about getting Beyond this part that of
[1:32:23] the negative now watch this brother Bram
[1:32:25] says this and I'm I'm reading these
[1:32:26] because I want it to be very definitive
[1:32:28] and you must be born again brother Bram
[1:32:30] talks about all these things that people
[1:32:32] are being told you know uh in many
[1:32:34] different things but this is one point
[1:32:36] he goes on he says they're being told
[1:32:38] tonight you're a sinner tomorrow you're
[1:32:39] a manifested Son of God
[1:32:42] nonsense where you get that in the word
[1:32:45] babies are not born men they're born
[1:32:47] babies and grow to
[1:32:50] men that is a key that will actually
[1:32:54] defeat
[1:32:56] negativity you see we're not just saying
[1:32:59] think positive think positive it's
[1:33:01] you've got to un we are understanding
[1:33:03] who we are as Sons and Daughters of God
[1:33:05] being told who we are where we're at and
[1:33:07] the process we what we're going through
[1:33:11] if I'm crawling right now God ain't
[1:33:12] expecting me to run a race out here in
[1:33:13] this parking
[1:33:15] lot and shame on you if you want to
[1:33:17] challenge me to a race and I'm only
[1:33:20] crawling come on friends you know you
[1:33:22] run me off you run me back and forth
[1:33:25] well he just
[1:33:28] toddler hey you want a
[1:33:33] race we understand I know it's very
[1:33:35] simple and sometimes it seem but but it
[1:33:37] gets down to where we're at see God's
[1:33:39] working with every one of our Lives you
[1:33:41] know that's this is why that even within
[1:33:43] it the more that we mature that's right
[1:33:47] the more we have greater sympathy and
[1:33:50] understanding to pray for one another
[1:33:53] amen but see sometimes when we get to
[1:33:55] the we can get in those and we all pass
[1:33:57] through them we all pass through them so
[1:33:59] I'm not I'm not here condemning I'm just
[1:34:01] saying to understand where we're at and
[1:34:02] to understand where God's taking us cuz
[1:34:04] sometimes we can get into this I'm this
[1:34:06] shotgun I got up here first I called I'm
[1:34:08] riding shotgun with mom up here first
[1:34:10] and you're on the back no hey hey get
[1:34:11] over by the window hey hey quit bumping
[1:34:13] me and we're sitting in the middle hey
[1:34:14] quit bumping me quit touching me pray
[1:34:16] tell where they're supposed to go you
[1:34:18] know what I'm talking about don't you I
[1:34:20] mean pray tell me where you're supposed
[1:34:21] to go I mean there was a lot of times
[1:34:23] station wagons just in case for young
[1:34:24] people looking up station wagons were a
[1:34:26] thing you the mom and dad and whoever
[1:34:28] else sat in the middle row we didn't
[1:34:29] have these consoles down the middle that
[1:34:31] was also for p a person's body down the
[1:34:33] middle and then you had that second row
[1:34:35] ain't that right brother Aaron you had
[1:34:36] the second row and you know what the
[1:34:38] back was for to throw all the rest that
[1:34:39] won't fit in the other
[1:34:41] seats you have people's elbows faces
[1:34:44] feet and everything else in yours but
[1:34:48] you know what's funny as you grow a
[1:34:49] little bit you begin to realize it don't
[1:34:52] matter if I'm in the front seat seat or
[1:34:54] the back seat by the window got this
[1:34:56] window or I'm in the middle seat it
[1:34:58] don't even matter if I'm sitting in the
[1:35:00] trunk I'm just so happy to be going with
[1:35:04] Mama but you know that don't happen
[1:35:07] overnight so that what that deals God
[1:35:09] deals with our life he'll even correct
[1:35:11] us on our on on our thinking now in our
[1:35:13] thinking sometimes did we get it when we
[1:35:15] were that age we didn't sometimes we
[1:35:17] just thought Mom and Dad don't
[1:35:18] understand and man we were so wanting
[1:35:20] our way but after a while as we grow up
[1:35:23] and with the right right tutoring with
[1:35:24] the right tutoring where Mom and Dad
[1:35:27] would say that's not going to exist
[1:35:29] anymore that's the same way God does you
[1:35:31] and I God doesn't let us throw ourselves
[1:35:33] on the floor and pout and give a fit and
[1:35:35] kick a fit you know why cuz we'll be
[1:35:37] doing that later on down the
[1:35:40] road are you with me God is one who does
[1:35:43] not believe in spoiling the child he
[1:35:46] believe God knows his own word that
[1:35:47] foolishness is bound in the heart of the
[1:35:49] child and only the rod correction will
[1:35:52] drive that out that's why the the word
[1:35:53] of God comes to drive out foolishness
[1:35:56] out of our heart he's not there to
[1:35:58] condemn us he's to drive out of our life
[1:36:01] what's hindering us and hindering him
[1:36:04] from working in our
[1:36:08] lives you see if we're not careful when
[1:36:10] we get corrected or something comes our
[1:36:12] way now listen I'm not going to say that
[1:36:14] you're not a child of God but sometimes
[1:36:16] a person can get corrected and they get
[1:36:18] so offended while they're corrected and
[1:36:20] they'll leave and well I'm going to go
[1:36:21] to this church I'm going to go to this
[1:36:23] church look I'm happy as long as you
[1:36:25] want as you continue on with the Lord
[1:36:26] but sooner or later you're going to have
[1:36:28] to deal with that issue in your life and
[1:36:30] realize it's not everybody else's fault
[1:36:33] that there is things still in your life
[1:36:35] that even when correction comes it
[1:36:38] bothers you oh that's good that's so
[1:36:41] good come on friends that's good oh my
[1:36:44] all of a sudden my no we're not there
[1:36:48] all the way yet notice in the scripture
[1:36:51] Ephesians 4 speaking the truth
[1:36:54] in
[1:36:54] love not in harshness but speak the
[1:36:58] truth In
[1:36:59] Love sometimes that's where it's got to
[1:37:01] get down beneath all of the all of the
[1:37:03] stuff because it's all the stuff that's
[1:37:04] hindering
[1:37:06] us right thank God for that thank God
[1:37:09] for the truth being spoken in
[1:37:12] love how is that in love knowing that
[1:37:15] down beneath there that this right here
[1:37:17] that's not my brother that's not my
[1:37:19] sister that's not them there's a
[1:37:21] confidence on the inside there there is
[1:37:23] more of God to be made manifest
[1:37:28] Hall that's good listen let the devil
[1:37:31] come around like sand balot and like
[1:37:32] tobiah came around the walls when
[1:37:34] Nehemiah was building them and said
[1:37:36] there ain't nothing but a pile of
[1:37:37] rubbish here while these walls a fox
[1:37:40] could run right through them let the
[1:37:41] devil say what he wants but we are the
[1:37:44] redeemed of the Lord and God is building
[1:37:47] Sons and Daughters of God by his word
[1:37:50] we're not looking at the negative cuz
[1:37:52] the negative will never take us anywhere
[1:37:55] but the positive of his life and of his
[1:37:57] experience pulsating in our life it'll
[1:38:00] take what the world calls rubbish and
[1:38:02] bring out of it a son and daughter of
[1:38:04] God it'll take a dirty pile of laundry
[1:38:07] and when it's passed through
[1:38:08] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:38:11] the Holy Ghost it can actually have the
[1:38:13] image of the king himself impressed upon
[1:38:20] it notice this last this phrase here
[1:38:23] everybody all
[1:38:24] right May grow
[1:38:26] up into him in all things so it didn't
[1:38:30] just

[1:39:17] pains are not
[1:39:18] rejoicing you know mama would always
[1:39:20] tell me you're growing Again Sam you're
[1:39:21] growing I wish I would stop growing in
[1:39:23] certain areas but she keeps telling me
[1:39:25] you're growing you're growing Samuel and
[1:39:27] I'm thinking I'm hurting right now this
[1:39:30] hurts I can't even think about tomorrow
[1:39:33] morning yeah that's good preacher I
[1:39:35] can't even think about the favorite pop
[1:39:37] tarts and I've got picked out for
[1:39:38] breakfast I can't think about that all
[1:39:40] I'm thinking about is the pain and
[1:39:43] sometimes what that you and I can look
[1:39:45] at is the the trials the test and what's
[1:39:48] going on but God is encouraging you and
[1:39:50] I and says yield my son yield my
[1:39:53] daughter you're
[1:39:58] growing that's good
[1:40:01] oh but grow in Grace not in unto but
[1:40:05] grow in Grace and in the knowledge of
[1:40:08] our Lord Jesus Christ Our Savior our
[1:40:11] Lord Jesus Christ to him be glory now
[1:40:14] and forever brother BR says it like this
[1:40:16] he says when a man is converted let's
[1:40:20] just say like the little white button
[1:40:21] starts in his heart that part is God
[1:40:26] when he's born again with the spirit of
[1:40:28] God it's God's Spirit dwelling in him if
[1:40:31] he can let that Spirit grow and take out
[1:40:35] all the roots of bitterness and press
[1:40:38] God's way through him now God's not
[1:40:42] pressing from the outside in no God gets
[1:40:46] on the inside and a little white
[1:40:49] button like that right there that much
[1:40:53] when a man has been born again that
[1:40:57] much but the more that he can
[1:41:01] yield it'll push out now the whole key
[1:41:05] in growing is
[1:41:08] yielding but that yielding to it through
[1:41:11] all the correction through all the
[1:41:13] chastening through all the experiences
[1:41:15] sometimes it's the experiences that God
[1:41:17] allows us to come to in our own
[1:41:21] character development
[1:41:24] to where things to be rubbed out of our
[1:41:27] life things that maybe we've had to
[1:41:29] repent of over and over and over and
[1:41:33] finally it gets to a spot to where we
[1:41:36] recognize Lord I need to die in this
[1:41:39] area of my life I I need to die it gets
[1:41:43] to a place where we're no longer it's no
[1:41:45] longer an excuse it's no longer a
[1:41:47] something like such a thing cuz
[1:41:49] sometimes there's things that we brag on
[1:41:50] the negative boy I tell you what
[1:41:53] he or she will just tell it like it is
[1:41:55] and finally God will just allow
[1:41:58] situations to go and then if they're a
[1:42:01] real child of God born of the spirit of
[1:42:03] God I'll tell you what those things will
[1:42:05] come right around and God will work that
[1:42:08] thing out of their life but it will not
[1:42:10] be that God is doing it without their
[1:42:12] yielding they'll have to come finally to
[1:42:15] a place to realize this is not a brother
[1:42:18] this is not a sister this is not so and
[1:42:20] so this is not them that has done this
[1:42:22] or this or that or my boss or whatever
[1:42:24] more but God helped me to die in that
[1:42:27] area of my life and I'll tell you that
[1:42:30] takes a son and daughter of God stepping
[1:42:32] up with courage now watch how brother
[1:42:34] Ram will say this here he said God's
[1:42:36] desire is that he would dwell supremely
[1:42:39] to do our thinking our walking our
[1:42:41] talking then it's no longer the man it's
[1:42:45] God in the man notice he said eternal
[1:42:48] life is the light of God that dwells in
[1:42:50] the man and if he will yield to the SP
[1:42:53] Spirit more he becomes unman likee and
[1:42:57] becomes more
[1:42:59] Godlike notice the key yielding brother
[1:43:03] B goes on an uncertain sound that says
[1:43:05] talking about that button again when a
[1:43:07] man saved that much of him is God that's
[1:43:11] the little light that comes in to make
[1:43:14] you quit doing what's wrong and notice
[1:43:18] what it starts with it starts with
[1:43:21] things that are so obvious with with
[1:43:23] dealing with sin nature and then from
[1:43:26] there it works
[1:43:27] outwardly in the molding and shaping of
[1:43:31] our
[1:43:32] character he says now if you can take
[1:43:35] all the malice Envy strife and unbelief
[1:43:39] out that little button like of the light
[1:43:42] and power of God will keep growing
[1:43:45] growing growing growing crowding
[1:43:49] out
[1:43:51] unbelief that's and if you do it by you
[1:43:54] can't do it by exhortations of bodily
[1:43:57] exercise you do it by a Sanctified
[1:44:00] consecrated life that the holy spirit
[1:44:03] moves through
[1:44:05] you wow so let me just say this when God
[1:44:09] God listen everyone you are to have a
[1:44:12] personal experience with God and then
[1:44:15] with your experience with God we take
[1:44:17] encouragement from one another through
[1:44:19] testimonies through Fellowship but God
[1:44:22] God works on on you he works on me just
[1:44:24] as he did with that personal experience
[1:44:26] to where you pass from Death unto life
[1:44:29] friends that is the absolute necessity
[1:44:32] without that experience in your life
[1:44:34] it'll just be like you or me trying to
[1:44:36] put peacock feathers in a black bird
[1:44:39] it'll be like you and I trying to
[1:44:41] manufacture wool but when the spirit of
[1:44:44] God has come and our Nature has changed
[1:44:46] you say how do I know that my nature has
[1:44:48] been changed the love of the things of
[1:44:51] the world is gone and there is the love
[1:44:54] for God it's a love that's not just here
[1:44:57] it's a love that creates a real
[1:45:00] Fellowship a real relationship it
[1:45:02] creates such a reality that it stands
[1:45:05] out there like that mother deer did when
[1:45:07] that Little Fawn call was being made and
[1:45:09] she seen the hunter but she stepped out
[1:45:12] there with
[1:45:14] reality it produces
[1:45:17] reality and then from there there's a
[1:45:20] growing that takes place
[1:45:23] now
[1:45:25] notice cuz sometimes in the negative I'm
[1:45:27] trying I'm trying to get to I'm trying
[1:45:28] to get down here I only got a couple
[1:45:30] more parts to go here one more point but
[1:45:34] sometimes when we get to looking
[1:45:36] at on the
[1:45:38] negative we can just get focused on
[1:45:41] where we're at we can get focused on man
[1:45:45] if I if I had a not a bad day well why
[1:45:47] did you have a bad day yeah that's the
[1:45:50] key well I I I I I fell into this area
[1:45:53] why did you fall into that area see as a
[1:45:55] Son of God why did that
[1:45:58] happen if certain things were coming up
[1:46:01] and it felt like that it felt like you
[1:46:03] know the the thickness of whatever of
[1:46:05] lust or whatever was around you why were
[1:46:07] you feeling that in such a way you say
[1:46:09] well I'm still I'm still in this body
[1:46:10] but why is it that certain things were
[1:46:13] bothering in such a way that is where it
[1:46:16] certain things that was passing by your
[1:46:19] eyes certain things that was coming
[1:46:22] certain places where they ought not have
[1:46:24] been what what was it that has started
[1:46:26] that you see negative that can be around
[1:46:28] what is it that would cause a person
[1:46:31] here they come in from work and they
[1:46:32] come in from work and everything is
[1:46:35] wrong the kitchen the table is 5 centet
[1:46:39] to the right too
[1:46:40] far I mean you know the rice is not
[1:46:43] right today it's more orange than it is
[1:46:46] yellow where's the
[1:46:49] gandulas where's the pork you give me
[1:46:51] chicken
[1:46:53] everything yeah now you listen you
[1:46:56] wonder why is that because if that
[1:46:59] person is a son and daughter of God
[1:47:01] there's something that they realize I
[1:47:03] got to get out of this I got to get out
[1:47:05] of this I got to get the war that's
[1:47:07] right there that War I got to get out of
[1:47:08] this I got to I got to break this that's
[1:47:10] not
[1:47:12] right but what started
[1:47:15] that maybe it was from the workplace
[1:47:18] where there's a bunch of critical
[1:47:20] Spirits not people come on Friends don't
[1:47:23] be oh I'm tell you I can't I can't hang
[1:47:25] around them guys don't blame the
[1:47:28] guys come on if we if we when we come
[1:47:31] back to that place and been critical it
[1:47:33] wasn't because of the guys it's what we
[1:47:35] allow to come in because you're always
[1:47:38] going to be around
[1:47:40] negative but you and I it has to be God
[1:47:44] let it be in my life something that will
[1:47:46] neutralize that and if we feel ourselves
[1:47:49] getting negative like why in the world
[1:47:50] are they driving so slow why don't they
[1:47:52] hurt hurry up I mean it's 35 you can at
[1:47:54] least go 50 down through
[1:47:58] here you know what I'm talking about
[1:48:00] friends and sometimes those are the very
[1:48:03] things it hinders and the Holy Spirit is
[1:48:05] grieved and he P pulling back and that
[1:48:08] really is what bothers you and I as a
[1:48:10] son and daughter of God when we lose and
[1:48:12] we sense that we've grieved him in some
[1:48:15] way we've offended him in some way but
[1:48:18] that if we can receive it is part of the
[1:48:21] child training and we learn from that
[1:48:23] correction and that correction is where
[1:48:25] he pulls back his presence and we say
[1:48:28] Lord forgive
[1:48:31] me and then we realize when you go into
[1:48:34] work you may still have the same
[1:48:35] critical people
[1:48:37] around you don't have to walk around and
[1:48:39] shun them like they're the plague but be
[1:48:41] a son and daughter of God in every
[1:48:43] situation if you're not strong enough to
[1:48:45] do that ask God to make you give you the
[1:48:47] strength to be able to do that come on
[1:48:50] friends if you can't look at the trash
[1:48:52] online then get off of it if you can't
[1:48:55] look at Facebook and Instagram sometimes
[1:48:57] we got our face too much in those books
[1:49:00] so much in those things right there and
[1:49:02] there's why there's a weakness within
[1:49:04] our life and our walk with God and no
[1:49:06] wonder we're not any further along than
[1:49:08] we ought to
[1:49:09] be but you know what God works with our
[1:49:12] life and if we'll recognize it as we
[1:49:15] come around those
[1:49:16] situations soon as you get away you get
[1:49:19] in your car say Lord cleanse me
[1:49:23] Lord Lord if there's any piece of straw
[1:49:26] that a bird has carried into my mind I
[1:49:30] don't want that Nest maybe they started
[1:49:31] to put them mud around those straws and
[1:49:34] we we battle Birds on our porch them
[1:49:37] Birds must have been there from I don't
[1:49:38] know when I mean them little them little
[1:49:41] guys are about that big they'll have a
[1:49:43] nest in no time I've knocked them down
[1:49:47] in the morning and they've already
[1:49:49] gotten one built by 1 p.m.
[1:49:53] and I mean it's mud woven with
[1:49:58] straw sometimes we look and say oh just
[1:50:00] one piece of straw it can get built very
[1:50:02] quickly and there's things that we're
[1:50:04] responding in a certain way and the
[1:50:06] spirit of God is bringing us more and
[1:50:08] more to the realization you're a Son of
[1:50:11] God you're a daughter of God you have
[1:50:14] authority over unclean spirits yeah
[1:50:18] that's so
[1:50:19] good some of us we might be geared we're
[1:50:22] we're geared in certain ways and see
[1:50:25] God's not here to try to change the
[1:50:26] gears he's here to give us Grace to rule
[1:50:30] over those
[1:50:31] gears is that right I mean some of us
[1:50:35] you know it just ah it don't matter you
[1:50:36] know it's okay this or that it's all
[1:50:38] right others of us man you know if it's
[1:50:39] always this way it's this way it's this
[1:50:41] way it God has all
[1:50:43] variety but God works in our life and
[1:50:47] here's the point that I want to get to
[1:50:50] it's God leading you and I and sometimes
[1:50:53] the part with the negative that we're
[1:50:55] trapped around we get into looking at
[1:50:58] our feelings this is one of the things
[1:51:00] that even as a young Christian a young
[1:51:02] believer it will affect in their life
[1:51:04] they'll look many times at feelings and
[1:51:06] we still if we'll be honest as older
[1:51:10] Believers we battle against
[1:51:12] feelings sometimes the things that we've
[1:51:14] said that are negative is because based
[1:51:16] on our
[1:51:18] feelings right in instead of the word of
[1:51:20] God well you know and here comes in
[1:51:23] whisper I like well you're not getting
[1:51:24] anywhere you're not making any
[1:51:25] Improvement you're still dealing with
[1:51:27] things and and we listen to that listen
[1:51:30] God is not in the business of running
[1:51:33] his children
[1:51:35] down he's in the business of reminding
[1:51:38] you of who you
[1:51:41] are he's in the business of giving you
[1:51:43] strength even as he corrects us as he
[1:51:45] guides us to give us strength to rise
[1:51:48] above it and you know what when you
[1:51:49] start out I'm just I'm just speaking
[1:51:50] here from my heart as you start out and
[1:51:52] your walk with God sometimes you might
[1:51:54] want to see things and say well my I
[1:51:56] want to you know man I should be like
[1:51:57] this brother I should be like this
[1:51:59] sister no you shouldn't you should be
[1:52:00] whom God has made
[1:52:02] you and let me just tell you something
[1:52:04] these other brothers in here I could
[1:52:05] call a number by name or whatever more
[1:52:07] listen they didn't they didn't start out
[1:52:09] like like where they I mean they started
[1:52:11] out where you are now and where I am
[1:52:13] then then all of a sudden one day boom
[1:52:15] man and they're they're over here they
[1:52:17] don't start that way it's little by
[1:52:19] little by little this is why this is why
[1:52:22] even when you're seeking God for
[1:52:24] anything you if you're seeking God for
[1:52:26] the Holy Ghost start really getting in
[1:52:28] and reading your Bible listening to the
[1:52:30] message and praying and seeking after
[1:52:33] God press beyond your own feelings
[1:52:36] because the negative is what will try to
[1:52:38] hold you back when Caleb when Caleb and
[1:52:41] them were there the spies came back in
[1:52:43] the land all they could talk about was
[1:52:45] the
[1:52:46] negative it affected the whole Camp the
[1:52:50] whole house started to wail and
[1:52:53] weeping and Caleb stood up and stealed
[1:52:56] the people so wait a
[1:52:59] minute who brought us out of the
[1:53:02] pits wait a minute who was it that
[1:53:06] opened the Red Sea wait a minute who was
[1:53:09] it that gave us a word about a lamb
[1:53:12] being slain with blood spread placed on
[1:53:15] the lentils of the door poost and we
[1:53:17] walked out of there with the treasures
[1:53:19] of Egypt who was that that's brought us
[1:53:21] here
[1:53:23] amen he's beginning to rehearse the
[1:53:25] works of God I tell you right now
[1:53:27] there's times you need to if you need to
[1:53:29] get in the bathroom close the door and
[1:53:31] look in the mirror and say Where Were
[1:53:33] You When God got a hold of you what were
[1:53:36] you before God started dealing with your
[1:53:38] life you might say well they might think
[1:53:40] I'm a Nut you know who you're talking
[1:53:43] to encourage yourself in the
[1:53:47] Lord what God has done for you it'll
[1:53:50] change the negative to the positive you
[1:53:53] watch the holy spirit will come right
[1:53:55] into the room I am a daughter of God I
[1:53:58] am a Son of God the Holy Ghost belongs
[1:54:01] to me uh Deliverance belongs to me he's
[1:54:04] working on my character he's molding me
[1:54:07] he's shaping
[1:54:11] me this might be all broke up but I
[1:54:14] think pray God to put it together to
[1:54:16] make sense it's experiences sometimes in
[1:54:18] our lives that we come through it's
[1:54:21] experien say and those experiences we
[1:54:23] come through it makes us as we yield to
[1:54:27] him it makes us what we ought to be you
[1:54:30] love
[1:54:32] him
[1:54:34] so we want to continue to yield to him
[1:54:37] let me read one more scripture and I'm
[1:54:39] I'm I'm stopping here this is the key
[1:54:42] being led by the
[1:54:45] spirit Paul said here in Romans 8 verse
[1:54:50] 13
[1:54:52] if you live after the flesh you shall
[1:54:54] die but if you through the spirit do
[1:54:56] mortify that means keep dead the Deeds
[1:55:00] of the body so you got a strength to put
[1:55:04] the Deeds of the body in
[1:55:06] line do you don't want to pet them well
[1:55:09] this has always been part of my family
[1:55:10] tree you're part of a different family
[1:55:12] tree now you're part of a different what
[1:55:15] good can come out of but your last name
[1:55:17] there my last name there a son and
[1:55:19] daughter of God that's the good thing
[1:55:20] that can come out of there
[1:55:23] right so notice if you through the
[1:55:26] spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body
[1:55:28] you shall live sometimes that is not
[1:55:31] just something with that is just
[1:55:32] overnight if to have the thought that
[1:55:35] I'm going to live in such a place that
[1:55:36] I'll never make a mistake brother Brown
[1:55:38] tells us he said don't ever get thinking
[1:55:41] that
[1:55:43] way this is why we need the blood of
[1:55:46] Jesus Christ we're here within the
[1:55:49] negative but we're pressing on there's
[1:55:51] things that is more I'm more sensitive
[1:55:54] to now than what I was even a year ago
[1:55:58] absolutely yeah there's things I'm more
[1:55:59] there's say and when I say more
[1:56:00] sensitive there's more of the awareness
[1:56:03] of this guy yeah that's right that's
[1:56:06] what I'm talking about the awareness of
[1:56:08] this guy that's my hindrance there's
[1:56:10] more because you know what happens the
[1:56:12] word has a way of exposing in our lives
[1:56:16] and it's calling us
[1:56:17] higher and this is the real key friends
[1:56:20] you can take this to the bank and cash
[1:56:22] in
[1:56:22] for if you live after the flesh you
[1:56:24] shall die but if you through the spirit
[1:56:26] do mortify the Deeds of the body you
[1:56:27] shall live this is the one for as many
[1:56:30] as are led by the spirit of God they are
[1:56:34] the sons of God and verse 16 the spirit
[1:56:38] itself beareth witness with our spirit
[1:56:40] that we are the children of God that's
[1:56:43] so see it's being led when the spirit of
[1:56:46] God comes to speaks to our hearts and
[1:56:48] deals with our life can we be led say
[1:56:52] yes Lord be it unto me be it unto me
[1:56:56] Lord to be led by him you see because
[1:56:58] we've never passed this way
[1:57:00] before when God told Israel coming into
[1:57:03] the land stay behind the ark the ark is
[1:57:06] the word because you've never passed
[1:57:08] this way before you're a new creation
[1:57:12] behold all things old things are passed
[1:57:15] away and all things have become new
[1:57:18] right brother Bram says this he says
[1:57:20] every time you move out a little
[1:57:24] unbelief God steps right in and takes
[1:57:30] over the scripture for this everywhere
[1:57:33] The Souls of your feet are set that I
[1:57:36] give you to move out of little unbelief
[1:57:39] H H how do we know to move out of un
[1:57:41] little unbelief did Israel decide what
[1:57:44] city they were going to take in the
[1:57:45] order they were going to take it they
[1:57:47] didn't that's right God said Jericho
[1:57:50] then it was AI
[1:57:55] God gave them Jericho they so they could
[1:57:56] see when it comes to AI don't take your
[1:57:58] own
[1:57:59] intelligence don't take artificial
[1:58:02] intelligence take the mind of Christ
[1:58:04] working in you is that
[1:58:07] right notice but notice it didn't decide
[1:58:10] that it was it was step by step of the
[1:58:12] way right they didn't take all the land
[1:58:13] at once that's how listen the promised
[1:58:16] land that's how it is in your life how
[1:58:18] it is in my life from the negative to
[1:58:21] the the positive it's little by little
[1:58:24] by little see just even how simple it
[1:58:27] started in your life my life your walk
[1:58:29] with the with God my walk with God it
[1:58:31] starts with what repentance starts with
[1:58:34] that going into water baptism God begins
[1:58:37] to God is sanctifying the life and God
[1:58:39] deposits the gift of the Holy Ghost in
[1:58:42] your life it's walking on with him and
[1:58:44] you don't start walking from that birth
[1:58:47] it's a
[1:58:48] growing BR says there you are you're
[1:58:51] pressing out from that little button is
[1:58:53] taking over the fibers of you spreading
[1:58:57] out God working through you in you and
[1:59:01] around
[1:59:02] you I I know today and I'm not trying to
[1:59:05] make fun of anybody but I know today I'm
[1:59:07] so thankful all of a sudden they started
[1:59:09] offering you a little bit more dress
[1:59:10] shirts and all of a sudden they got to
[1:59:11] these things slim fits modern fits now
[1:59:14] if you like them I'm not against them I
[1:59:15] know some of young boys they like all
[1:59:17] that I I I just I I don't like all that
[1:59:19] to me that kind of stuff when when we
[1:59:20] were you know you wear your pants so
[1:59:22] they can see your your your socks I'm
[1:59:24] I'm okay with that I'm I'm not
[1:59:25] condemning nobody you understand I'm
[1:59:26] just trying to make a point here when
[1:59:28] when I was growing up and your pants
[1:59:30] were too tight they need to be boxed up
[1:59:32] and given to somebody
[1:59:34] else and they were too short you know or
[1:59:37] your pant or you know you you had your
[1:59:38] shirts and they were they were so tied
[1:59:40] on you you know you boxed them up and
[1:59:42] gave them to somebody else or or hand
[1:59:44] them down to somebody but you see now
[1:59:46] with the spirit of God when it grows in
[1:59:48] our life man it if there's sometimes it
[1:59:52] feels good when there's things you start
[1:59:53] breaking out of you know it's like you
[1:59:55] know when you're things are St moving
[1:59:57] you realize man it's it's it's growing
[2:00:00] in my life and you know when you see God
[2:00:02] growing in your life it's not just in
[2:00:06] the exploits god listen God gives signs
[2:00:09] and wonders and miracles God will do
[2:00:10] things through your life God will do
[2:00:12] wonderful little things and I don't want
[2:00:14] to say little just to say little but you
[2:00:16] know why he does that to encourage
[2:00:19] you but the real growth the real growth
[2:00:22] is when you as you can see him in your
[2:00:25] life and you can begin to recognize your
[2:00:29] littleness and his greatness you can
[2:00:31] begin to see certain things in your life
[2:00:33] and say Lord I want to rule over that in
[2:00:36] my life Lord you begin to because soon
[2:00:38] as you identify and you and I can't
[2:00:41] identify it brother Aon if it w for the
[2:00:43] word we couldn't identify it but the
[2:00:44] word helps us to identify it and as we
[2:00:46] will yield to the word the more we
[2:00:49] become unman likee and more Godlike
[2:00:53] and God gives us Grace to reign in that
[2:00:55] are life from negative to
[2:00:59] positive you love
[2:01:01] him we'll just stop there let's
[2:01:18] stand oh my thank you Lord Jesus
[2:01:24] thank you

[2:01:33] more if you play that song Lord I want
[2:01:36] to be more like

[2:01:43] go knows each of Our
[2:01:45] Lives listen friends no matter where
[2:01:48] where we're at here this
[2:01:50] morning what we all have need need of is
[2:01:52] more of him that's not a cliche that's
[2:01:55] just not a statement that is made but we
[2:01:59] all need more of
[2:02:01] him we're all growing there's lives here
[2:02:04] that need no doubt among us some that
[2:02:07] might stream or archive that in need of
[2:02:10] a a real true experience with God but
[2:02:12] don't let Satan point that put that
[2:02:15] experience something somewhere out there
[2:02:16] it's it's right it's right there by you
[2:02:18] you say how is it right there by me
[2:02:22] brother B said' when you begin to hunger
[2:02:23] and thirst for the Holy Ghost he quotes
[2:02:27] that scripture blessed are they that do
[2:02:29] hunger and thirst after righteousness
[2:02:32] for you shall be filled he said that's
[2:02:34] the spirit of God on your life
[2:02:38] wanting to fill your
[2:02:42] life say brother Samuel what what do I
[2:02:45] do just invite him just invite him say
[2:02:49] Lord all of my thoughts
[2:02:52] all that I have Lord I surrender to
[2:02:55] [Music]
[2:02:59] you the negative if you just focus on
[2:03:02] him who is the positive he'll give you
[2:03:05] the grace to be delivered of that
[2:03:08] negative
[2:03:09] birth and then and then in our lives as
[2:03:14] we're walking with him we come through
[2:03:18] we come into different times in our
[2:03:19] lives my I remember when God first got a
[2:03:22] hold of my life you can
[2:03:25] too
[2:03:27] man it was just wonderful it's actually
[2:03:31] more wonderful now but then it's tests
[2:03:34] trials different things that came things
[2:03:37] that we had to learn
[2:03:39] mistakes sometimes God would let us let
[2:03:42] us fall right on our face to bring us to
[2:03:45] a place to help us to
[2:03:47] realize we need him I want you to think
[2:03:50] of this
[2:03:52] God's not a cookie cutter God when God
[2:03:55] moves down into our lives by the spirit
[2:03:57] of
[2:03:58] God he moves down some might be more
[2:04:02] strong willed than others others might
[2:04:04] have more of a of a gentle nature but
[2:04:07] that's we're that's not we talking about
[2:04:09] we're talking about something deeper
[2:04:10] when the Holy Ghost has come in and then
[2:04:13] the Holy Spirit begins to move in that
[2:04:14] life that person that might be a gentle
[2:04:16] nature the spirit of God would have to
[2:04:17] work in their
[2:04:19] life to where
[2:04:22] that they don't come into a place of
[2:04:25] just being pushed around a little bit
[2:04:28] accepting certain things not that they
[2:04:31] become arrogant but God has to work and
[2:04:33] build in their life to that place and
[2:04:35] then God will have to work on somebody
[2:04:37] else who's maybe more strong natured to
[2:04:39] be a little bit more to be tender to be
[2:04:44] sensitive to be yielded to know when to
[2:04:46] say something and when not to say
[2:04:48] something see God's working on all of
[2:04:50] us and Friends the spirit of
[2:04:52] God that Spirit of
[2:04:55] adoption the scripture said it leads
[2:04:58] us to full
[2:05:01] adoption I say God Have Your Way in our
[2:05:04] lives Lord have your way in our lives
[2:05:08] move through US Lord God let the spirit
[2:05:11] of God just so flow through our lives
[2:05:14] may may have even as we are embarking
[2:05:16] and looking upon this new year coming in
[2:05:19] I pray May Our Lives be so

[2:05:26] lives that are so completely
[2:05:29] yielded coming into the new birth say

[2:08:53] things why is it if it was
[2:08:56] something that bothered us of
[2:08:59] criticalness or something that showed up
[2:09:01] why is that it's not because of a
[2:09:05] person but Lord if we can really look

[2:19:37] help us even as we go through this
[2:19:39] week Lord with the things that you've
[2:19:42] spoke to us
[2:19:47] personally may we Lord take
[2:19:50] just meditating just dwelling upon that
[2:19:53] Lord
[2:19:55] and dear
[2:19:58] God help us to yield
[2:20:01] Lord sometimes Lord things and terms
[2:20:05] that they're very simple terms but
[2:20:08] sometimes they can become so vague they
[2:20:12] can become so
[2:20:15] abstract but Lord simple
[2:20:19] yielding it even starts Lord
[2:20:22] God with
[2:20:24] prayer simple
[2:20:27] yielding taking Lord
[2:20:29] and going through Lord God a
[2:20:34] chapter listening Lord maybe to a
[2:20:37] portion of a message on the way to
[2:20:39] [Music]
[2:20:41] work maybe listen to a little bit more
[2:20:44] of the next day and the next
[2:20:47] day simple yielding that's that's simp
[2:20:50] simple yielding and
[2:20:53] allowing you to have the right away Lord
[2:20:57] it says so
[2:20:59] much like of a person who would come on
[2:21:02] a shift before they would ever step by
[2:21:04] the machine or go into their
[2:21:07] office first thing they'll go is in
[2:21:09] maybe into the kitchen cafeteria they
[2:21:12] make themselves a cup of coffee they
[2:21:14] become known by they've got to have
[2:21:17] their coffee before their day starts
[2:21:23] Lord help us
[2:21:25] Lord help us Lord that we can just even
[2:21:28] see of sometimes the things that would
[2:21:30] seem so vague and we can look and say
[2:21:33] well yielding yielding but Lord God you
[2:21:36] intend for us to be able to see that
[2:21:38] even in our own lives it takes Lord just
[2:21:41] of the simplest of
[2:21:43] things and just to invite you Lord just
[2:21:46] in daily
[2:21:48] devotion it allows you to move to work

[2:23:30] forsake not to assemble yourselves
[2:23:32] together is the manner of some is simple
[2:23:36] yielding obedience to the word of God
