[44:10] morning
[44:11] and i believe he knows just exactly what
[44:13] we need
[44:14] amen and so we just ask that the lord
[44:17] will just take brother alexander
[44:19] magoulis and just use him in a special
[44:21] way
[44:22] we're so thankful that brother alexander
[44:24] and sister maria that they would come
[44:26] and the family
[44:27] and so we just want to pull on the gift
[44:30] of god
[44:31] god is mindful you know brother branham
[44:34] put it
[44:34] just simply like this in spiritual food
[44:37] and due season
[44:38] he said now he said there's a gift he
[44:41] said that god has placed in my life
[44:43] and he said god has gifted you to
[44:46] believe
[44:46] and he said now what happens between
[44:49] those two gifts
[44:51] he said god himself comes down and
[44:54] embodies himself so what takes place
[44:58] i'm getting a ringing up here so what
[45:01] takes place
[45:02] is is a real sovereign work of god and
[45:05] brother brown said it just as simple
[45:07] he said that's the secret food
[45:11] we realized we could have went there
[45:12] could have been other places that we
[45:14] could have went to and you know how it
[45:16] is you can hear
[45:17] talks or you can hear somebody speak
[45:20] but we've come here to hear the word of
[45:23] the lord
[45:24] amen we've come to hear from god and to
[45:27] know that god is
[45:28] mindful of our need he's a very personal
[45:32] god and he's mindful
[45:34] so let's just approach it in that way
[45:36] whatever you've got to care
[45:38] and and truly every one of us we've got
[45:40] needs or we've got something on our
[45:41] heart
[45:42] let's just put it on the altar of god
[45:44] and let's just believe
[45:46] for god to come on the scene and move in
[45:49] a very special way
[45:51] because though we may not feel anything
[45:54] that's not
[45:54] that doesn't make any difference what
[45:57] matters is is lord
[45:58] let me be in that position as we were
[46:00] talking last week
[46:01] that faith can drop into my heart for
[46:04] whatever the situation is
[46:06] amen don't you love him amen
[46:10] let's just let's just welcome the lord
[46:12] here to come and just speak to us and
[46:14] we're just thankful to have brother
[46:15] alexander

[46:21] to sit but

[49:38] applause just give him praise this
[49:40] morning
[49:41] he's been faithful
[49:43] [Applause]
[49:46] i'll tell you what that song just like
[49:47] the verse says it means
[49:49] it means more to me now i think than it
[49:51] did when i first it was precious when i
[49:53] first realized it but
[49:55] when you realize even as a christian how
[49:57] many times you make mistakes how many
[49:59] times you really
[50:00] need the lord it just has an even
[50:02] greater meaning to you
[50:04] as time goes on so we thank god that his
[50:06] faithfulness
[50:07] he is always faithful amen and
[50:11] i just want to say this morning i sure
[50:12] appreciate brother paul and
[50:14] the songs that he's saying you know he
[50:16] made that comment about his memory
[50:18] he's he shouldn't be that old already
[50:20] and most of you laugh because you know
[50:22] that it just gets worse as you go on
[50:24] some of you are laughing because you're
[50:25] looking at me saying well what do you
[50:26] know about it
[50:28] so if it's that bad there
[50:31] i mean i don't know i mean sometimes i
[50:34] don't even know why what i
[50:35] what i'm doing like i'm just driving
[50:36] down the road and i'm like oh i'm going
[50:37] the wrong direction
[50:39] well i'm the only ones ever done that
[50:42] anyway god's faithful though but i
[50:43] appreciate the
[50:44] the songs that were sung especially you
[50:46] know i was just back there looking at my
[50:47] notes and i thought well i might not
[50:48] have to preach today if you keep singing
[50:49] these songs
[50:51] i love i love it when a plan comes
[50:53] together
[50:54] and i don't usually see my own ever come
[50:56] together but i've seen gods come
[50:57] together i just
[50:58] i love watching it come together because
[51:00] i believe that the spirit and the word
[51:02] of god there's a harmony
[51:04] that exists and when you see everybody
[51:06] come into the harmony of the word
[51:08] uh it's it's just a beaut it's beautiful
[51:10] to watch how god unfolds things
[51:12] you know i was just on the way here i
[51:14] was looking at uh brother graham talked
[51:16] about jehoshaphat and ahab they
[51:18] they sought out the different prophets
[51:19] and they had each prophesied things and
[51:22] jehoshaphat says well isn't there one
[51:24] more
[51:25] he was looking for somebody because
[51:26] there's something in him said you know
[51:27] what this isn't quite where it needs to
[51:29] be
[51:30] and even when that prophet said well go
[51:31] and do what you want the lord's with you
[51:33] said no i told you
[51:34] tell me what the lord says he said well
[51:36] i saw
[51:37] the people scattered like sheep but that
[51:39] king he recognized that there's
[51:41] there has to be a harmony between what
[51:42] god has said and what he's always
[51:44] declared
[51:45] and i just i just as i get older
[51:47] especially
[51:48] preaching like an old man i don't know i
[51:49] keep doing this but i just really
[51:52] marvel at how god brings things together
[51:55] and i think it's relevant
[51:56] as even what we're looking at today in
[51:58] the scripture because
[52:00] how god brings things together so many
[52:02] times it's completely
[52:04] contrary to how we try to piece things
[52:07] together
[52:08] and uh when we learn just to lay those
[52:09] things aside and look at the lord and
[52:11] what the lord's trying to do
[52:13] it makes your life a lot easier among
[52:14] other things and so we just want to
[52:16] yield to god's purpose
[52:18] uh you know i was thinking about it on
[52:20] the way here there's there's three
[52:21] things
[52:22] that we look at when we look at how
[52:24] things are it's how we think
[52:26] things ought to be and then there's how
[52:28] things ought to be and then there's
[52:29] how god wants them to be and our desire
[52:32] is that we have all three of those in
[52:34] harmony we want our will
[52:35] to be what his will is to change the
[52:37] situation
[52:39] what it's supposed to be and so we just
[52:41] desire that if you have your bibles
[52:43] before i might as well take a text if i
[52:44] want to preach to you huh
[52:46] [Laughter]
[52:48] i was overseas if you want to stand here
[52:50] the book of ecclesiastes is the third
[52:51] chapter
[52:52] i tell you when i was overseas one time
[52:54] you probably heard this story
[52:56] but i was overseas one time and this
[52:58] this guy got up to preach
[53:00] and i tell you what he was having a good
[53:01] time i i maybe not so much but
[53:04] he just went on and on and on for about
[53:05] 45 minutes before he took his text
[53:08] i was i was timing him too and uh i just
[53:11] thought well praise the lord maybe we'll
[53:12] get to the word of god today
[53:14] so we want to look at the word of the
[53:16] lord today
[53:17] ecclesiastes the third chapter we're
[53:19] gonna read the first eight verses then
[53:20] we're gonna turn to the book of joshua
[53:22] after this
[53:23] and uh ecclesiastes chapter three
[53:27] and we'll start in the first verse it
[53:28] says to everything there is a season and
[53:30] a time to every purpose
[53:32] under heaven a time to be born and a
[53:34] time to die a time to plant and a time
[53:37] to pluck up that which is planted a time
[53:40] to kill and a time to heal
[53:42] a time to break down any time to build
[53:45] up
[53:46] a time to weep and a time to laugh
[53:49] a time to mourn and a time to dance
[53:52] a time to cast away stones than a time
[53:55] to
[53:56] gather stones together a time to embrace
[54:00] and a time to refrain from embracing
[54:03] a time to getting the time to lose a
[54:05] time to keep and a time to cast away
[54:08] a time to rand and a time to sow
[54:11] a time to keep silence and a time to
[54:14] speak
[54:15] a time to love and a time to hate
[54:18] a time of war and a time of peace
[54:21] and if you turn me to the book of josh
[54:23] with the third chapter here
[54:29] then we'll just read verses 12 to 17.
[54:32] now i had a bookmark so i got there
[54:34] right away but if you're there say amen
[54:37] josh of the third chapter
[54:40] verse 12 it says and joshua's speaking
[54:43] here he says now therefore
[54:44] take ye twelve men out of the tribes of
[54:46] israel out of every tribe of man
[54:48] and it shall come to pass as soon as the
[54:51] souls of the feet of the priests
[54:54] that bear the ark of the lord the lord
[54:56] of all the earth
[54:58] shall rest in the waters of jordan the
[55:00] waters of jordan shall be cut off from
[55:02] the waters that come down from above
[55:04] and they shall stand upon a heap and it
[55:07] came to pass when the people were moved
[55:09] from their tents to passover jordan and
[55:12] the priests bearing the ark of the
[55:13] covenant before the people
[55:15] and as they that bear the ark were come
[55:17] unto jordan
[55:19] and the feet of the priests that bear
[55:21] the ark were dipped
[55:22] in the brim of the water it says this
[55:25] and
[55:26] this actually where i want to come from
[55:27] here for jordan overflowed all his banks
[55:30] at the time of harvest it says that the
[55:34] waters which came down from above stood
[55:36] and rose up upon a heap very far
[55:38] from the city adam that is besides
[55:40] zaraton and those that came down toward
[55:42] the sea of the plain even the salts he
[55:44] failed
[55:45] were cut off and the people passed over
[55:48] right against jericho and the priests
[55:50] that bear the ark of the covenant of the
[55:52] lord stood firm
[55:54] on dry ground in the midst of jordan and
[55:57] all the israelites
[55:58] passed over on dry ground until all the
[56:00] people were passed clean
[56:02] over jordan let's just bow our heads for
[56:04] word of prayer
[56:05] heavenly father lord i thank you for the
[56:07] scripture that was read
[56:09] this this at this time lord and i just
[56:12] pray
[56:12] father you'd come and do your mighty and
[56:15] your strange work in our midst lord
[56:17] may you take the words that were read
[56:18] the words of this bible
[56:20] and cause them to live in our sight
[56:22] cause a
[56:23] a great power of revelation to move
[56:25] among the hearts
[56:27] and the lies of your believers even
[56:28] right now lord to recognize and to move
[56:31] and to yield to the mighty plain and
[56:33] purpose that you've laid out for us in
[56:35] this age
[56:36] lord as you bless the reading of your
[56:37] word and you bless each of these
[56:39] we pray that your great name will be
[56:41] magnified in our midst
[56:43] and lord we just give you all the praise
[56:44] and the glory we commit ourselves
[56:46] this people our time now into your hands
[56:50] that you might have your way for we ask
[56:52] it in jesus christ's name
[56:54] amen and amen god bless you you're
[56:56] seated
[57:00] i'd like to take a thought i actually
[57:01] didn't really know what i was going to
[57:02] title this
[57:03] uh just a few minutes ago but i guess
[57:05] i'm just going to title it
[57:07] in time of war or a season of war
[57:10] and uh we look at this and brother bran
[57:12] makes a statement here
[57:14] in the sermon as i was with moses he
[57:16] says that the jordan was
[57:18] three or four times its size he said it
[57:20] was spooky horrible looking muddy
[57:22] but joshua said god said within three
[57:25] days
[57:26] we're going over and we're going over he
[57:28] says now the clergy would say now wait a
[57:30] minute joshua
[57:31] we are educated men we are smart many of
[57:35] us here are engineers from egypt
[57:37] we know how to do these things
[57:40] i love the expertise of these men we
[57:42] know how to do these things so we'll
[57:43] just
[57:44] wait a little while until the stream
[57:45] clears up and we can walk across it
[57:47] isn't that much easier he says but
[57:49] joshua said i don't care what you think
[57:52] god said three days we're going over and
[57:55] we're going over he says we're going
[57:57] over in three days he says
[57:58] watch what joshua did what did he put
[58:02] first amen your leadership is determined
[58:05] by what you put first amen
[58:06] he says what did he put first the clergy
[58:09] no sir
[58:10] he put the word first he said you take
[58:13] that ark and all you priests
[58:15] he says stay away from him he says get
[58:17] behind it don't try to lead
[58:19] it let it lead you
[58:22] he says that's the trouble today we try
[58:24] to get ahead of the word
[58:26] and bypass and make the word to fit
[58:29] this to the word to fit that he says
[58:31] bless your hearts
[58:33] what we need today is to follow the word
[58:37] amen i believe uh we're living in a time
[58:39] amen we live in different seasons and
[58:41] and we know this earth and humanity
[58:43] there there's subject different seasons
[58:44] but i believe that we're living in a
[58:46] as the prophet would say the greatest
[58:47] time for the believer it's a marvelous
[58:50] hour and i believe if we're going to do
[58:51] something for the lord to this is the
[58:53] hour to do something for the lord
[58:55] if we're ever going to serve god amen if
[58:57] we're ever going to
[58:58] commit ourselves fully into the hand of
[59:00] god for god's purpose
[59:02] it's today that we should do it amen i
[59:05] hope that for each of us here today
[59:06] we're more committed to the purpose of
[59:08] god today than we were in 2020
[59:11] i pray we're more committed to god today
[59:13] than we were two
[59:14] or three or four years ago i hope that
[59:17] we can look at things that are going on
[59:18] the earth today
[59:19] and circumstances and say you know what
[59:21] despite all these things
[59:23] i am more committed i am more sold out i
[59:26] am more purposed in my heart to follow
[59:28] the word of god today
[59:30] than i've ever been before can i get a
[59:32] witness
[59:33] we're we are more established we've got
[59:36] more promises
[59:37] there's a greater revelation that's been
[59:39] made available us today
[59:41] and then we're not in a we're not in a
[59:42] time of retreat we're in a time of
[59:44] moving forward
[59:46] we're not in a time of dispossession of
[59:48] our own inheritance
[59:49] we are here to dispossess the
[59:51] inhabitants that have taken what belongs
[59:54] to us
[59:55] healing is our promise deliverance is
[59:58] our promise
[59:59] the power and the manifestation of this
[1:00:02] world that's
[1:00:02] our promises we are here to possess
[1:00:05] and to dispossess what the enemy has
[1:00:07] taken over amen
[1:00:10] i believe we're living in our and and
[1:00:12] let me say it this way i believe there
[1:00:13] was a great anticipation
[1:00:15] that morning in the camp when the water
[1:00:16] began to roll away because they'd heard
[1:00:18] stories
[1:00:19] about what god had done they heard tales
[1:00:22] about what god had promised
[1:00:23] but this day they were crossing over
[1:00:26] they weren't going to be sitting there
[1:00:27] ringing their hands saying i can't wait
[1:00:28] for this to happen one day but there was
[1:00:30] a recognition
[1:00:31] when the waters began to move back and
[1:00:34] the foot of that priest fell upon that
[1:00:35] river
[1:00:36] and it drove the waters back the things
[1:00:38] that we've talked about
[1:00:39] the things that we've longed for the
[1:00:41] things that we've expressed that we've
[1:00:42] heard mommy and daddy talk about
[1:00:44] those are no longer things we're just
[1:00:46] going to look forward to
[1:00:47] this is now a present truth in our lives
[1:00:51] we're no longer just trying to find or
[1:00:52] wandering we have entered in
[1:00:54] to a possession and i believe for the
[1:00:57] bride of jesus christ today
[1:00:59] where you're sitting at this morning i
[1:01:01] believe we are possessors of all things
[1:01:03] according to the promise of god amen
[1:01:06] so many people are looking for something
[1:01:08] amen they're looking one day god's going
[1:01:10] to do great things
[1:01:12] today god's going to do great things
[1:01:14] well one day there's going to be revival
[1:01:16] there's revival today but we're looking
[1:01:19] for the third poll
[1:01:20] to be manifested you're hearing it today
[1:01:24] it's the opening of this word that we're
[1:01:25] ministering this
[1:01:27] message has come to give you a full
[1:01:29] possession
[1:01:31] not a promise of something that's out
[1:01:32] there somewhere but life is entered into
[1:01:35] the body
[1:01:36] the power of god has come quickening
[1:01:38] power has entered in
[1:01:40] to the body of jesus christ yes
[1:01:43] hallelujah oh we're waiting for this
[1:01:46] great falling away
[1:01:47] we're great waiting for this thing we're
[1:01:48] waiting for that and remember the brim
[1:01:50] said they were doing the same thing in
[1:01:51] the wilderness
[1:01:52] they were waiting on god they were
[1:01:53] waiting on god and god was waiting on
[1:01:56] them
[1:01:57] i tell you what if i was running behind
[1:01:59] at a meeting or something with we hate
[1:02:01] doing that as americans especially
[1:02:02] you go overseas they're always late but
[1:02:05] americans we're conditioned to it
[1:02:06] if we gotta be there at three o'clock
[1:02:08] and it's 301 we we're we're sweating
[1:02:11] we're getting worked up we're worried
[1:02:13] we're gonna miss something
[1:02:14] because we've been conditioned that way
[1:02:15] this is a natural people we don't want
[1:02:17] to be late
[1:02:18] and how i would dread to think that i
[1:02:20] would make god that i made my brother
[1:02:22] that'll make my sister wait on me amen
[1:02:26] listen brother when he sees a vision at
[1:02:28] three o'clock in the morning he's a
[1:02:29] visionary vision of palestine
[1:02:31] and he sees that he says bless god
[1:02:33] praise the lord
[1:02:34] over in that land just beyond the jordan
[1:02:37] river
[1:02:38] he said that's where all the promises
[1:02:40] lie
[1:02:42] he said they're already there amen what
[1:02:44] did joshua come to do
[1:02:46] he didn't come to to just continue moses
[1:02:49] ministry
[1:02:50] in the wilderness but the the
[1:02:51] furtherance of the ministry was to take
[1:02:54] them in
[1:02:54] to the promised possession amen god was
[1:02:57] going to magnet he said i'm going to
[1:02:58] magnify you
[1:03:00] this day tweety told the province
[1:03:02] paradox as he did with joshua i'm gonna
[1:03:04] magnify your name this day
[1:03:06] and then the people are no longer just
[1:03:08] they're just observing the promised land
[1:03:11] from a mountaintop somewhere but they've
[1:03:13] actually already entered in
[1:03:15] through the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:03:17] he's placing them in a possession
[1:03:19] and brother brown in the same vision he
[1:03:21] sees that great mamba snake
[1:03:23] and when he goes to look for it the
[1:03:24] first thing he says he comes into the
[1:03:26] vision
[1:03:26] and he sees the people are scared and he
[1:03:28] asks the question
[1:03:29] what's everybody so afraid of
[1:03:33] that's what i'm asking myself this
[1:03:34] morning what's everybody so afraid of
[1:03:37] i understand why the world's afraid i
[1:03:40] understand why the unbelievers
[1:03:42] and the nations of this earth i
[1:03:43] understand why they're afraid
[1:03:45] why are the believers afraid this
[1:03:47] morning
[1:03:48] what are they afraid of amen well
[1:03:51] hallelujah
[1:03:52] listen we're living in a time this
[1:03:54] scripture says men's hearts would fail
[1:03:55] for fear
[1:03:56] we're in it i'm not waiting for it
[1:03:59] listen you've got more antidepressants
[1:04:01] you've got more psychology you've got
[1:04:04] more madness
[1:04:05] and insanity in this hour than there's
[1:04:07] ever been before
[1:04:08] social media and government and politics
[1:04:11] they're bombarding you constantly every
[1:04:14] day
[1:04:15] and it's destroyed the human faculty to
[1:04:17] reason and to think like a rational
[1:04:19] human being
[1:04:19] so they can't even tell what gender they
[1:04:21] are they can't even tell their left hand
[1:04:23] from the right
[1:04:25] what they call goodness evil what they
[1:04:27] call evil is good
[1:04:28] they've got no idea i don't understand
[1:04:31] why they feel that way but you and i are
[1:04:34] the believer
[1:04:36] i understand when israel showed up to
[1:04:39] the promised land why the jebusites and
[1:04:41] the hittites and
[1:04:42] i understand why they would be scared
[1:04:44] but the believer's not scared
[1:04:47] the believers coming into their
[1:04:48] possession the believers rising up today
[1:04:52] what they're going to possess is greater
[1:04:54] now than what they've ever possessed
[1:04:56] before
[1:05:01] hey man it's interesting
[1:05:04] so many believers they've they've become
[1:05:05] disillusioned with the world i'm
[1:05:07] thinking praise god
[1:05:08] it's about time it's about time
[1:05:11] they look at cobra they look at
[1:05:13] elections
[1:05:15] well i'm going to take my liberty here
[1:05:17] amen i just love it some of these
[1:05:18] believers i get i get people that send
[1:05:20] me this stuff or whatever oh we're going
[1:05:22] to do this and
[1:05:23] the president's going to do that and
[1:05:24] this time like whatever yeah
[1:05:27] hey man listen i understand voting i
[1:05:29] don't want to pay higher taxes i get
[1:05:31] that
[1:05:31] remember god's economy doesn't change
[1:05:33] based on who's in the white house
[1:05:35] god's program doesn't change based on
[1:05:37] which representative gets voted in here
[1:05:39] or there god sets up kings and he tears
[1:05:42] them down
[1:05:43] well praise the lord you get these
[1:05:45] brothers i got this book this brother he
[1:05:46] comes
[1:05:47] you know what he said he's looking he's
[1:05:49] looking at politics he said this
[1:05:50] country's done for her
[1:05:52] i'm thinking praise god you finally got
[1:05:54] a revelation
[1:05:55] decades after a prophet preached it it's
[1:05:59] done for her it's not coming back
[1:06:02] amen somebody well this country's done
[1:06:05] for you
[1:06:06] you know the world's just falling apart
[1:06:08] yep he preached at least uh what six
[1:06:10] times i think
[1:06:11] four times it it's actually falling
[1:06:13] apart again
[1:06:14] amen yeah it's falling apart we've been
[1:06:17] preaching that for years
[1:06:19] you understand the very things that
[1:06:21] upset people
[1:06:22] that worry the world is the very
[1:06:23] vindication that this bible
[1:06:26] and this message are true because we
[1:06:29] were told it would be that way well they
[1:06:30] rigged an election they viewed that in
[1:06:32] the 60s brother ramsey
[1:06:33] he said it's already over
[1:06:37] so why would we get upset about that
[1:06:39] because the same voice
[1:06:41] that told us it's over the same voice
[1:06:43] that said america's doom
[1:06:44] is the same voice that said there's
[1:06:46] going to be a sinless
[1:06:47] virtuous bride of jesus christ
[1:06:51] it doesn't matter what satan's even
[1:06:53] possesses and throws at him there's
[1:06:55] going to be a people
[1:06:57] by the grace of god under there the
[1:06:59] final voice under the messenger
[1:07:01] to the final edge
[1:07:06] we're so big not people not worried
[1:07:07] what's going to happen on the 20th
[1:07:09] well i don't know what's going to happen
[1:07:10] on the 20th but i know it's going to
[1:07:12] happen to me
[1:07:13] i'm going up i'm rising up
[1:07:17] i'm not backing down i'm not pulling
[1:07:19] away
[1:07:20] i'm moving forward with the kingdom of
[1:07:22] god
[1:07:24] this country's just gonna be a bunch of
[1:07:25] ashes at the end of the day
[1:07:27] but you and i we have received a kingdom
[1:07:30] that cannot be moved
[1:07:34] i can stand as the apostle and boss of
[1:07:37] death
[1:07:37] where is thy sting who craves where is
[1:07:40] thy victory
[1:07:41] listen these men suffered under
[1:07:43] persecutions
[1:07:45] and and trials and and all kinds of
[1:07:47] debauchery
[1:07:48] they saw the rise of the antichrist
[1:07:51] spirit
[1:07:51] in their day their heads were put in
[1:07:54] chopping blocks in there today
[1:07:56] hey man
[1:08:03] i love the way the profit dramatizes
[1:08:04] this crossing of the jordan river
[1:08:07] because these men were so busy telling
[1:08:09] joshua
[1:08:10] why it can't be well this has to happen
[1:08:14] and
[1:08:14] this is a circumstance that's in the way
[1:08:17] this has to take place
[1:08:18] amen i'm going somewhere praise the lord
[1:08:21] well but this has to line up with this
[1:08:22] and i have this song
[1:08:23] listen we've studied this we're
[1:08:24] educating men we've got degrees
[1:08:27] i've studied this thing to and fro and
[1:08:29] back and forward and i've got
[1:08:30] i've got it figured out well don't
[1:08:32] figure yourself wrong about then
[1:08:34] hey man listen these men had every a
[1:08:36] rational excuse
[1:08:38] for why they couldn't cross over the
[1:08:40] river's too high and this isn't going to
[1:08:42] work
[1:08:42] but i want you to understand that the
[1:08:43] circumstances that were hindrance to
[1:08:46] them
[1:08:47] and then were the very circumstances
[1:08:49] that declared this was the time to cross
[1:08:51] over
[1:08:52] well look moses just passed on and the
[1:08:54] waters are really high
[1:08:56] and look at the world today look at its
[1:08:58] condition
[1:08:59] well this has to happen and the church
[1:09:01] has to do this and the church has to
[1:09:02] stop doing that and we're looking for
[1:09:04] all these things to add up before we're
[1:09:06] going to believe god
[1:09:08] amen someone
[1:09:11] i think about this because people are
[1:09:13] doing this they try to rationalize i'm
[1:09:15] thinking why
[1:09:15] why are we trying to validate the plan
[1:09:17] of god we don't have to validate the
[1:09:19] plan of god
[1:09:20] god's already vindicated it we don't
[1:09:22] have to validate it amen
[1:09:25] you know it's like i always tell people
[1:09:27] you know they're looking for certain
[1:09:28] things to come up
[1:09:29] they're waiting for california they're
[1:09:30] waiting for this and they're waiting for
[1:09:31] that i'm thinking
[1:09:32] if what god has done and what god has
[1:09:34] said has not already moved you into
[1:09:37] possess your land
[1:09:38] what do you think is going to move you
[1:09:40] well one day we'll get right with god
[1:09:41] what's going to change
[1:09:43] right well one day there's going to be a
[1:09:44] manifestation what could god do
[1:09:46] that he hasn't already done we've got
[1:09:49] some idea in our mind some circumstance
[1:09:52] like those men this can't be the day we
[1:09:55] believe it's going to happen
[1:09:56] but it just can't be right now because
[1:09:58] there's these circumstances in our way
[1:10:00] that are hindering us but joshua didn't
[1:10:02] look at circumstances
[1:10:04] he looked at the season that he was
[1:10:06] living in
[1:10:08] see the spiritual believer doesn't look
[1:10:10] at circumstances they look at the season
[1:10:12] they are living in
[1:10:14] he says of course the banks are
[1:10:15] overflowing jordan always overflows his
[1:10:17] banks
[1:10:18] in the harvest in other words it's
[1:10:21] harvest time
[1:10:21] of course the waters are going to be
[1:10:23] high amen it's the end
[1:10:25] of course people are going to be falling
[1:10:26] away of course people don't believe in
[1:10:27] the power of god
[1:10:28] of course the nations are breaking
[1:10:30] they're supposed to but for you and i
[1:10:32] that means this is the season
[1:10:34] of the harvest this is our overcoming
[1:10:38] you and i were born for such a time as
[1:10:40] this
[1:10:41] and the very circumstances that declared
[1:10:43] it was harvest time
[1:10:44] to joshua he could recognize now is the
[1:10:47] time to cross over
[1:10:49] because they'd put on quail they'd fed
[1:10:51] on man but they weren't going to do that
[1:10:52] in this land
[1:10:53] they were going to eat the old corn of
[1:10:54] the land
[1:10:56] now the only hallelujah the only way for
[1:10:58] them to do that is if the corn was at
[1:11:00] harvest time
[1:11:01] they're not going to go dig it out of
[1:11:03] the ground in its infancy there's
[1:11:04] got to be a mature harvest that's ready
[1:11:07] for a horse
[1:11:08] for them to eat so the harvest time is
[1:11:11] the only time they can cross over
[1:11:13] and survive so the very circumstances
[1:11:17] that they thought testified against them
[1:11:19] actually testified this is the hour of
[1:11:22] our possession
[1:11:30] we'll look at somebody say well i need
[1:11:32] this to happen to believe the message
[1:11:34] i'm waiting for this vindication i'm
[1:11:35] waiting for this and we'll sit there
[1:11:38] and rightfully so we'll look we'll look
[1:11:40] at me like well that's just ridiculous
[1:11:41] to do that
[1:11:41] but we'll do the same thing with the
[1:11:44] other promises of god
[1:11:45] well one day i'll get my deliverance one
[1:11:47] day i'll i'll have my joy back
[1:11:49] one day there'll be a revival in my
[1:11:50] church one day in my house and one day
[1:11:52] this
[1:11:53] you're doing the same thing you're hey
[1:11:55] man i thought i'd get a few more amens
[1:11:57] on that
[1:11:58] you're looking at the circumstances that
[1:12:01] you're living you're looking at all the
[1:12:02] same lost loved ones and
[1:12:04] uh and you're looking at sickness you're
[1:12:06] looking at politics
[1:12:07] and you're saying it can't be oh yes he
[1:12:09] can
[1:12:10] because for god to manifest his power to
[1:12:13] do these things
[1:12:14] those circumstances have to be present
[1:12:16] [Music]
[1:12:17] so you don't look at the circumstance
[1:12:19] the circumstance and say it can't be
[1:12:21] you look at the circumstance and say now
[1:12:24] is the time
[1:12:25] now it's not a time to back away this is
[1:12:28] a time of war
[1:12:29] we're declaring war on the power of
[1:12:31] satan this is the time
[1:12:32] we are going to possess our promises
[1:12:36] don't look at the circumstances and be
[1:12:38] dismayed and it should actually
[1:12:39] encourage you as a believer
[1:12:41] [Applause]
[1:12:43] listen whenever the devil lies you you
[1:12:45] are being cursed when the devil says you
[1:12:47] can't be saved
[1:12:48] you can't serve god you can't you want
[1:12:50] to be so encouraged because guess what
[1:12:51] he's still a liar you ought to be so
[1:12:54] encouraged
[1:12:55] when the devil says you can't because
[1:12:57] you can sit there and testify
[1:12:58] i can i already have by the grace of god
[1:13:02] i'm not just gonna make it i've already
[1:13:05] made it
[1:13:07] i'm not just gonna cross over one day i
[1:13:09] believe the message has already led us
[1:13:12] hallelujah people still waiting for the
[1:13:15] power of god they're waiting for
[1:13:17] quickening power to wait for the rain to
[1:13:18] fall quickly power open those seals
[1:13:22] with quicking power open those heels
[1:13:23] quickening power can restore your home
[1:13:26] quickening power can raise up your body
[1:13:30] quickening power can reach out to the
[1:13:32] lost
[1:13:33] because the only way the banks of the
[1:13:35] jordan could be falls if the rain fell
[1:13:38] there was an abundance of the power that
[1:13:41] quickened that harvest
[1:13:42] right in front of them and they looked
[1:13:44] at it and they saw a negative
[1:13:45] circumstance
[1:13:46] but joshua said this is the season of
[1:13:49] our overcoming
[1:13:50] hallelujah
[1:13:53] [Music]
[1:13:58] there was spiritual food there in due
[1:14:01] season it
[1:14:01] you couldn't have had it in the
[1:14:02] summertime you couldn't have had in
[1:14:04] wesley's day
[1:14:05] you couldn't have luther's day it had to
[1:14:08] be in this hour
[1:14:11] and the believer today like joshua if
[1:14:13] you're spiritually minded
[1:14:14] you're not looking at the circumstances
[1:14:16] well this has happened and this has
[1:14:18] taken place
[1:14:18] and what about this those things all
[1:14:20] those modern events they're made clear
[1:14:21] by prophecy
[1:14:23] it's the lord's doing you can't resist
[1:14:25] his will you can't change it
[1:14:27] it's got to be what you can do is come
[1:14:29] into a harmony
[1:14:30] with joshua you can get behind the ark
[1:14:33] and let it lead you
[1:14:34] into a place that's greater than you've
[1:14:36] ever been before
[1:14:39] [Music]
[1:14:41] amen i believe this is the hour the
[1:14:44] prophet daniel spoke of your day
[1:14:46] he said in that day his people god's
[1:14:48] people they'll do exploits
[1:14:50] amen don't put that off till next week
[1:14:53] don't make that something that you're
[1:14:54] looking for well if some
[1:14:56] great man will rise on the scene some
[1:14:57] great person the great ones already here
[1:15:01] jesus christ he's the same yesterday
[1:15:03] today and forever
[1:15:04] we put too much confidence in men
[1:15:07] right now because that's what most of
[1:15:09] our circumstances come from well this
[1:15:11] person did this and
[1:15:12] this is going on is there any one of
[1:15:14] them that can defeat the council of the
[1:15:16] almighty
[1:15:19] is there some man that can outsmart god
[1:15:26] these people they're getting ready to go
[1:15:27] over they've seen some great things but
[1:15:29] they were gonna see some great things
[1:15:31] amen i believe you and i here today
[1:15:33] you've seen god do great things
[1:15:35] but i believe god's fixing to do great
[1:15:37] things today
[1:15:39] i believe he's the same amen i'm not
[1:15:41] talking about me i'm not talking about
[1:15:42] us as men
[1:15:43] and women i'm talking about the power of
[1:15:44] god that's in our midst
[1:15:46] don't put him outside the door like they
[1:15:48] did in laodicea
[1:15:50] he's here he's present he's an
[1:15:53] ever-present help in trouble
[1:15:57] and that what david said psalm 27 in the
[1:16:00] time of trouble if there was ever a time
[1:16:01] of trouble
[1:16:02] it's now if you've ever had trouble this
[1:16:05] is the time of trouble
[1:16:06] but that's when he'll hide you in the
[1:16:08] secret of his pavilion
[1:16:11] oh hallelujah there has to be a trouble
[1:16:14] for him to be the present help
[1:16:15] [Music]
[1:16:18] the very difficulties you're going
[1:16:20] through declare that he is with you
[1:16:24] [Music]
[1:16:30] amen they weren't just looking back
[1:16:33] to what happened with moses people do
[1:16:35] that well brother branham was here
[1:16:36] brother branham can't do anything more
[1:16:38] brother branham told you if jesus
[1:16:40] himself
[1:16:41] stood on this platform wearing this suit
[1:16:44] he could no more heal you than i could
[1:16:47] because he's already done it amen
[1:16:50] brother brandon never tried to point you
[1:16:52] to a historical ministry
[1:16:54] in his own life and that sure is not the
[1:16:56] will of god today
[1:16:57] but the same one that was with him is
[1:17:00] the same one
[1:17:01] that's in our midst today that's what
[1:17:03] the message is about
[1:17:06] amen this revelation declares the
[1:17:08] prophet says in the church e-book
[1:17:10] she can do the greater works and then
[1:17:13] she can not she will be
[1:17:15] not she could she can right now you
[1:17:18] already possess
[1:17:19] the ability if you can just catch it by
[1:17:22] revelation
[1:17:23] everything you need is here
[1:17:28] yeah now see it's one thing to enter
[1:17:31] into a possession
[1:17:33] to enter into the promised land it's
[1:17:34] another thing to find your place
[1:17:36] in that and then and not try to take
[1:17:39] somebody else's place or
[1:17:40] try to live in the glare of another day
[1:17:42] or try to be something that you're not
[1:17:43] amen
[1:17:44] because you're rest the rest is in the
[1:17:46] promise but where
[1:17:48] it's actually in your position in that
[1:17:50] promise
[1:17:51] because you can come into the promised
[1:17:52] land and you've got to fight on your
[1:17:54] hands amen
[1:17:54] there's still battles here
[1:17:58] we get this idea as christians that if
[1:18:01] we were really spiritual
[1:18:02] we'd have less battles in our lives we'd
[1:18:04] have less trials
[1:18:05] forget it you're living a daydream
[1:18:09] that has nothing to do with the kingdom
[1:18:11] of god you signed up for a battle
[1:18:15] you signed up to take the head off of
[1:18:17] that old devil
[1:18:19] and then you didn't come here for a
[1:18:21] picnic you signed up for war
[1:18:24] you might as well gird up your loins
[1:18:26] like a man you might as well put your
[1:18:28] shield on your sword on
[1:18:30] and put your armor on hey man cause
[1:18:32] guess what you're not getting through
[1:18:33] this
[1:18:34] without taking a few blows but praise
[1:18:36] god you've got armor
[1:18:37] it's meant to take the hitch you're
[1:18:40] building stuff that don't bluff
[1:18:42] what you've got can handle any fiery
[1:18:44] dart
[1:18:45] anything the enemy can throw at you
[1:18:47] you've got what it takes
[1:18:50] by the holy ghost you've got what it
[1:18:53] takes to withstand every fiery dart
[1:18:58] amen hallelujah we gotta find our that's
[1:19:00] where our rest is
[1:19:02] see once you find your place you're not
[1:19:03] tossed to the front like a child anymore
[1:19:05] you know what you're standing
[1:19:09] well i'm going off the beaten path here
[1:19:10] now but i was just ministering on this
[1:19:12] the other day
[1:19:13] you you watch certain people by the way
[1:19:15] praise god these steps i came up here
[1:19:16] i'm like
[1:19:18] that's real nice when you're five foot
[1:19:20] nine
[1:19:21] i don't get too close to you that's real
[1:19:23] nice though
[1:19:24] amen i was talking about this today you
[1:19:27] watch people
[1:19:28] even around the message and they float
[1:19:29] from one kind of a movement to one kind
[1:19:31] of idea
[1:19:32] to one thing to this to that we're gonna
[1:19:34] chase an anointing we're going to chase
[1:19:36] a ministry
[1:19:36] and they're always they're tossed to and
[1:19:38] fro and then
[1:19:39] what we need to do is get down
[1:19:42] and repent say god i'm supposed to have
[1:19:45] some discernment
[1:19:46] you said this bride's not going to be
[1:19:48] deceived why do we get caught up in
[1:19:50] certain things we ought to get down say
[1:19:51] god
[1:19:52] don't ever let a thing like that happen
[1:19:53] to me again
[1:19:55] we box from one idea to one man to this
[1:19:57] and that and we act like it's just
[1:19:59] normal
[1:20:00] but the christians ought to know what
[1:20:01] their place is
[1:20:03] there ought to be something so settled
[1:20:04] in us there
[1:20:06] should be something so driven down in
[1:20:08] our lives
[1:20:09] till nothing can move us off of it
[1:20:12] because listen if the devil can move you
[1:20:14] he'll move you if he can't push you up
[1:20:16] he'll bring you down
[1:20:17] he'll find a way to move if there's
[1:20:19] anything there yes sir amen
[1:20:21] you've got to know that you know that
[1:20:23] you know god prophesied
[1:20:25] he manifested the promise this is my
[1:20:28] land
[1:20:29] i was ordained to overcome in 2021
[1:20:32] i was retained to overcome this dark age
[1:20:35] of darkness
[1:20:36] and vanity and men's ideas yeah there's
[1:20:40] somebody here
[1:20:42] praise god somebody who's gonna make
[1:20:45] listen this is an age where nobody was
[1:20:47] supposed to make it but somebody's gonna
[1:20:49] make it
[1:20:50] because joshua told you we're following
[1:20:53] our joshua
[1:20:55] we follow this message because it come
[1:20:57] from joshua actually this message is
[1:20:59] your joshua yes sir
[1:21:00] brother yes sir amen
[1:21:04] yes sir yes sir brother says this
[1:21:07] hopefully it's familiar quote for you he
[1:21:10] says if you just rely on hope he says
[1:21:11] you hinder faith
[1:21:13] amen many of us today need to get out of
[1:21:15] the way of god amen
[1:21:17] we'll get into this way we'll get into
[1:21:18] that we'll follow this we'll we'll
[1:21:20] we've got all the best literature we've
[1:21:21] got all the best ideas get out of god's
[1:21:23] way
[1:21:24] amen your hope your ideas it's hindering
[1:21:27] faith
[1:21:29] well praise the lord he says hope looks
[1:21:32] for something way off
[1:21:33] but faith claims it right now see faith
[1:21:36] said god said so
[1:21:38] and it's mine somebody say it's mine
[1:21:42] god said so it's not just yours because
[1:21:44] you wanted it we're not a bunch of
[1:21:46] squatters now
[1:21:47] amen listen we are not robbing anyone
[1:21:51] amen the bible says let this mind
[1:21:54] be in you that was in christ who thought
[1:21:57] it not
[1:21:57] robbery to be he was god
[1:22:01] amen listen that's why the pharisees
[1:22:02] hated jesus they thought he was robbing
[1:22:04] god
[1:22:05] i didn't you've been a man you make
[1:22:08] yourself god
[1:22:08] saying god and i are one amen
[1:22:12] he wasn't robbing god that's who he was
[1:22:15] that's who you are if you can receive it
[1:22:17] you're not robbing anything from god
[1:22:20] you are the manifestation of his glory
[1:22:30] praise the lord god said so
[1:22:34] that's all i need the further i go on
[1:22:37] with the lord
[1:22:38] and the more i walked by faith i realize
[1:22:40] you know what god said so
[1:22:42] i don't need any additional
[1:22:43] qualifications i don't need another
[1:22:46] opinion
[1:22:47] god said so i mean quit listening to a
[1:22:50] popular opinion and culture tells you
[1:22:52] god said so therefore it's mine
[1:22:56] god said and that's all i need
[1:23:00] he said that settles it see i don't care
[1:23:02] if i'm still crippled
[1:23:03] i'm still blind if i'm still sick that
[1:23:06] don't have nothing to do with it
[1:23:08] i believe it anyhow it's mine
[1:23:12] right now yes sir
[1:23:16] you know i i've been blessed i said this
[1:23:18] to the glory of god i'm not saying this
[1:23:19] is a
[1:23:20] a boast but i've been blessed to travel
[1:23:22] and to see things
[1:23:23] i i i've seen god open the eyes of the
[1:23:25] blind i've got i watched god raised up
[1:23:27] cripples
[1:23:28] i watched devils cast out and it
[1:23:30] astounds me when i talk to people in
[1:23:32] church
[1:23:32] they say i wouldn't be great if god
[1:23:34] still did those things i'm thinking
[1:23:36] you're too late you're too late
[1:23:40] god still does those things he didn't
[1:23:42] change he didn't die in 1965
[1:23:44] my god he's still alive he's still the
[1:23:47] same
[1:23:48] he's still present
[1:23:49] [Applause]
[1:23:52] that's right brother i asked him what
[1:23:53] are you looking for exactly
[1:23:56] well i don't know but i'll know when it
[1:23:57] comes no you won't
[1:23:59] because it's coming you missed it
[1:24:03] can you imagine natural people watching
[1:24:05] water
[1:24:06] roll back and priests walk in there
[1:24:09] saying well
[1:24:10] maybe someday and yet god has come
[1:24:14] and he's not just vindicated the message
[1:24:16] he's thoroughly vindicated it
[1:24:19] amen not once not twice hundreds of
[1:24:23] thousands of times god has vindicated
[1:24:26] this message and we're waiting for
[1:24:29] something to qualify it
[1:24:32] it's no different than than when la with
[1:24:34] the rich man and lazarus
[1:24:36] hey man when he was down there well if
[1:24:37] god would raise up the debt listen if
[1:24:39] they can't believe the law and the
[1:24:40] prophets
[1:24:42] that's why i'm going this way if if you
[1:24:44] can't believe it now what do you think
[1:24:45] is going to change it for you
[1:24:47] what thing is going to make it different
[1:24:50] there's nothing to do
[1:24:51] it's already finished just believe it
[1:24:57] see that's the problem
[1:24:59] we're waiting for rapturing faith we've
[1:25:00] done sales on the tapes
[1:25:02] all right and that is all it takes now
[1:25:04] if you listen to tapes
[1:25:06] if you listen to what he said it's not
[1:25:08] just on the tape anymore
[1:25:11] i believe there's a people on the earth
[1:25:14] right now
[1:25:15] rapturing faith is already in them
[1:25:18] because they heard the word
[1:25:19] and when they heard the word they
[1:25:21] believe the word then it must be in them
[1:25:23] now
[1:25:25] this how can rapture and faith be in
[1:25:26] this people
[1:25:29] where else would it be if everything you
[1:25:31] have in english did you
[1:25:32] even the rapture that it's got to be in
[1:25:34] you now
[1:25:36] see now there's a difference between
[1:25:38] faith and believing
[1:25:41] see faith's a noun you can have faith
[1:25:43] but faith without works is dead
[1:25:45] but when you begin to believe when you
[1:25:47] begin to act
[1:25:48] and live like it's true not just saying
[1:25:52] it is a lofty platitude
[1:25:53] and just a good thing we put on the law
[1:25:55] well praise god
[1:25:57] those footsteps of a good man order the
[1:25:58] lord can you believe that when you're
[1:26:00] walking through the valley
[1:26:02] of the shadow of death his footsteps are
[1:26:04] still ordered
[1:26:06] even when i can't see he's a light to my
[1:26:08] feet he's a left in my path
[1:26:10] i had no idea how i got to 2021 my life
[1:26:14] my plans my ambitions did not bring me
[1:26:17] here this morning
[1:26:18] but god has ordered the steps
[1:26:21] the steps of a man from ohio he's
[1:26:23] ordered the steps of some people
[1:26:25] from sheffield to be here today
[1:26:28] because the rapture is taking place
[1:26:31] it's already working in us something on
[1:26:33] the inside
[1:26:34] is prevailing over that which is on the
[1:26:36] outside
[1:26:42] let's not just have faith let's believe
[1:26:44] let's put it into action
[1:26:47] let's quit talking about like it's the
[1:26:49] doctrine of a thing
[1:26:51] but let's let this thing live
[1:26:55] he says hope says god said so and i'm
[1:26:57] expecting to get it sunday
[1:26:59] [Music]
[1:27:00] we're gonna have revival someday sunday
[1:27:03] gonna overcome this addiction
[1:27:05] someday i'm gonna be an overcoming
[1:27:08] christian i'm not gonna be a roller
[1:27:09] coaster christian
[1:27:10] someday i'm gonna be settled someday i'm
[1:27:12] gonna be uh
[1:27:13] more mature he says you see i'm
[1:27:17] expecting someday
[1:27:18] as long as satan notice he's doing it
[1:27:20] now
[1:27:21] as long as satan can put you off to
[1:27:24] another day
[1:27:25] that's as good as he wants
[1:27:27] [Music]
[1:27:30] hey man i'm saying something there now
[1:27:32] satan's not trying to convince anybody
[1:27:34] here today
[1:27:34] probably that the message is wrong that
[1:27:37] the bible doesn't work
[1:27:39] that god is a lot that's not what he's
[1:27:40] trying to convince you of he's just
[1:27:42] trying to
[1:27:43] get you to kind of put it off a little
[1:27:44] bit
[1:27:46] that's why the bible says don't be
[1:27:47] slothful but diligent
[1:27:50] as partakers of those who through faith
[1:27:52] and patience
[1:27:53] inherit the promises amen because faith
[1:27:55] takes possession
[1:27:58] faith doesn't hope so someday because
[1:28:00] that's exactly the plan of satan
[1:28:03] one day i'll get right with the lord if
[1:28:06] you can't get right with the lord today
[1:28:08] why would you think you'd be able to do
[1:28:08] it tomorrow or the next day or the next
[1:28:11] day
[1:28:11] what circumstances are going to change
[1:28:13] that
[1:28:16] that's right he says that's right that's
[1:28:18] as good as he wants
[1:28:19] you'll never get it
[1:28:25] a double-minded man's an unstable he's
[1:28:27] unstable in all his ways
[1:28:29] let not that man think he'll receive
[1:28:32] anything from the lord
[1:28:36] he says just believe i wants to believe
[1:28:39] just believe you've got it right
[1:28:41] now it's your personal property faith
[1:28:44] is the substance of things hoped for
[1:28:48] the evidence of things not seen is that
[1:28:51] right he says
[1:28:52] faith acts now now's the time
[1:28:56] he says it's positive listen brother
[1:28:59] ramp said one day
[1:29:00] this church it will know its position
[1:29:03] then the rapture will go
[1:29:05] now i don't know when the church is
[1:29:06] going to find its position but for me
[1:29:08] i'm not waiting till the next day to
[1:29:10] find out my position
[1:29:12] lord you show me today what is your
[1:29:14] purpose in me
[1:29:16] it's got to start somewhere when they
[1:29:18] crossed over that promise
[1:29:20] into that promised land over that jordan
[1:29:22] listen somebody had to take their land
[1:29:23] first
[1:29:24] right they didn't all get it at once but
[1:29:26] somebody said you know what i'm gonna
[1:29:27] take mine
[1:29:28] i won't want it belongs to me we're
[1:29:30] gonna fight together
[1:29:31] we're gonna stand together to my brother
[1:29:34] to my sister
[1:29:35] till they get a breakthrough till they
[1:29:37] can take possession
[1:29:39] listen when i see one of you overcome
[1:29:42] and been blessed by god and god does
[1:29:44] something for you i rejoice
[1:29:47] because i'm saying to myself that's my
[1:29:49] promise to you
[1:29:50] it's not just for me it's for the body
[1:29:52] of christ
[1:29:54] how we ought to rejoice when one of us
[1:29:56] is honored
[1:29:57] amen
[1:30:02] somebody's got to take their promise hey
[1:30:04] man well maybe if reuben does it or
[1:30:06] maybe benjamin
[1:30:07] or this and i'll get interested
[1:30:11] amen see our attitude
[1:30:15] is the problem because the right mental
[1:30:17] attitude brings every promise to pass
[1:30:19] amen
[1:30:20] let's not hinder faith all right
[1:30:24] let's get behind it hey man what place
[1:30:27] is the church
[1:30:27] teaching places the church he said amen
[1:30:30] i believe that's why god
[1:30:32] give the holy ghost the scripture says
[1:30:33] he'll lead and guide you
[1:30:35] into all truth now if i ask how many
[1:30:38] here's got the holiest day
[1:30:39] i'm not going to ask that but hopefully
[1:30:41] every hand would go up amen or almost
[1:30:43] every hand
[1:30:44] if you've got the holy ghost that he
[1:30:46] promised to teach you all things
[1:30:47] he promised to lead and guide you to all
[1:30:49] truth he's never going to leave you
[1:30:51] he's never going to forsake you he's
[1:30:54] never going to doubt his own word
[1:30:56] he's never going to change his mind
[1:30:57] about his word
[1:31:01] amen that's what this message come to do
[1:31:04] it come to equip a group of believers
[1:31:06] with the maturity it takes
[1:31:08] to to to overcome liability amen this
[1:31:11] message is more than just a bunch of
[1:31:12] rules to me
[1:31:13] it's more than some good stories about
[1:31:15] squirrels and possums
[1:31:16] and people being healed in different
[1:31:18] meetings it's the manifested power of
[1:31:21] god
[1:31:22] to me when i see god working the life of
[1:31:25] brother branham i don't just say well
[1:31:27] praise god he could do that for that man
[1:31:29] but god is not a respecter of persons
[1:31:38] this message tells me who christ is you
[1:31:40] say well that's really important
[1:31:41] yeah it is because who he is is who you
[1:31:44] are
[1:31:45] what he is declaring about himself is
[1:31:47] what he has declared about you
[1:31:49] listen christ never fails christ never
[1:31:51] lies amen
[1:31:52] the word in you might talk about your
[1:31:54] flesh now christ in you will never fail
[1:31:58] when you fail he'll be there to pick you
[1:32:00] back up
[1:32:02] you might fall seven times and he'll
[1:32:04] pick you back up every time
[1:32:11] you're gonna have to fight brother ram
[1:32:14] said you have to fight for every inch
[1:32:16] all right i don't know
[1:32:19] i don't know i'm i'm i'll throw myself
[1:32:20] here i don't know where i got this idea
[1:32:22] that uh we're just gonna kind of breeze
[1:32:24] through this thing like
[1:32:26] we're gonna fake it till we make it that
[1:32:28] don't work in the kingdom
[1:32:31] you're not faking anything i mean you're
[1:32:33] gonna have battles
[1:32:34] you're gonna have fights it's gonna hurt
[1:32:36] some days you're gonna be limping out
[1:32:38] from the fight you had last night one
[1:32:40] morning out of the tent
[1:32:41] and my man i don't even feel like
[1:32:42] fighting today guess what your enemy's
[1:32:44] not taking the day off
[1:32:46] later she's not taking a day off hey man
[1:32:49] you and i can't take a day off
[1:32:51] we part-time christians we're full-time
[1:32:54] believers
[1:32:55] we're soldiers we're lined up we're
[1:32:58] ready to fight
[1:33:00] i'm ready to take my
[1:33:07] the land paul says in colossians chapter
[1:33:09] two he says beware
[1:33:11] lest any man spoil you through
[1:33:14] philosophy and vain to see
[1:33:15] after the tradition of men after the
[1:33:18] rudiments of the world and not after
[1:33:20] christ
[1:33:20] for in him christ dwelt all the fullness
[1:33:23] of the godhead
[1:33:24] bodily and ye are complete where
[1:33:28] in him not in your church not an
[1:33:30] organization not your ideas not the
[1:33:32] family you come out of
[1:33:33] you're completely in hand amen now
[1:33:36] listen if you're complete in him
[1:33:38] that means that you're not incomplete i
[1:33:40] know that's really tough for some people
[1:33:42] if you're complete in him that means
[1:33:44] that you're not incomplete
[1:33:45] not in him i think i did that right
[1:33:49] you're complete in other words you lack
[1:33:52] nothing
[1:33:53] and pausing beware when somebody comes
[1:33:56] to try to say well you lack you need
[1:33:57] something you don't have what you need

[1:34:02] you've got everything you need in this
[1:34:04] land this message i don't have to
[1:34:06] venture out and find another idea
[1:34:08] to supplement what the prophet said amen
[1:34:12] i believe that'll preach amen i don't
[1:34:14] have to find some other idea
[1:34:16] to say well if i take this and i add
[1:34:18] this to the message
[1:34:19] we've really got something yeah you've
[1:34:20] got a hybrid seed and it might get you a
[1:34:22] big looking crop but there's death in it
[1:34:24] it'll never reproduce the life
[1:34:28] i've got what i need god made sure it
[1:34:30] was provided for me
[1:34:32] that's not profit he wanted to be a
[1:34:34] trapper he didn't want to have to preach
[1:34:36] this message
[1:34:36] he knew he lose 10 000 friends but god
[1:34:39] made sure there was a message
[1:34:41] for you and i in 2021 that we could
[1:34:44] stand here and know that god has called
[1:34:46] us
[1:34:48] god has ordained us
[1:34:53] some men come on and say well well you
[1:34:55] lack you don't have that man's lying do
[1:34:58] you

[1:35:05] need my thing and this i don't need
[1:35:07] anything you have to give me

[1:35:14] has to give me
[1:35:15] my bow ass is taking care of me i don't
[1:35:18] need to go into some other field
[1:35:20] i don't need to find some other redeemer
[1:35:22] i'll find my boss
[1:35:24] he'll take good care of me he makes sure
[1:35:26] the reapers lifted that left a little
[1:35:28] extra for me
[1:35:33] so much what goes on in churches today
[1:35:35] they're spoiled through philosophy
[1:35:37] they're to see it's like i was talking
[1:35:39] about today you look at you
[1:35:40] you look at charismatic churches these
[1:35:42] big churches and they're well we're
[1:35:43] going to have revival one day
[1:35:44] and their own words testify against them
[1:35:46] they're dead
[1:35:49] think about that think about that we
[1:35:51] need revival that means you're dead
[1:35:53] one day there's going to be a great
[1:35:54] awakening so you're asleep
[1:35:56] their own words testify against them
[1:35:58] they lack
[1:36:00] they don't have but you and i that's not
[1:36:03] our testimony
[1:36:05] we've been enlightened by the seven
[1:36:07] thunders
[1:36:08] those are revelations of awakening the
[1:36:10] bride we're not an ignorant we're not
[1:36:12] enormous
[1:36:13] we are aware we're not like the children
[1:36:17] of the night
[1:36:17] they're overtaken by the night we're the
[1:36:19] children of the light
[1:36:22] this thing has not overtaken us unawares
[1:36:25] hallelujah
[1:36:29] like i say time and time again people
[1:36:31] get caught up looking at the wrong thing
[1:36:33] hey man they're looking at the wrong
[1:36:35] thing we look at adoption
[1:36:37] we look at the message we're looking at
[1:36:38] the wrong metrics we're looking at the
[1:36:40] wrong measurements we look at man's
[1:36:41] ideas
[1:36:42] well this is how a christian ought to
[1:36:44] look this is what they should do and
[1:36:45] this is the kind of ministry
[1:36:47] and don't even line up with the word
[1:36:57] he tells this story several times in the
[1:36:58] message and i don't know
[1:37:00] it's like i go to churches and they're
[1:37:02] not familiar with it sometimes i'm like
[1:37:03] man
[1:37:04] you think i come up with a new doctrine
[1:37:08] but brotherhood tells a story about a
[1:37:09] man he was a car salesman i don't know
[1:37:10] if anybody knows this hopefully you do
[1:37:12] but
[1:37:12] this man was a car salesman and his wife
[1:37:14] should become a christian
[1:37:15] and he said you know i didn't go to
[1:37:17] church i didn't do all these things but
[1:37:18] but i didn't mind my wife doing i
[1:37:20] support her doing it
[1:37:21] and he said he was in the office one day
[1:37:22] and sold a car and he went back to get
[1:37:24] the key to make sure they had the key
[1:37:25] and he walked in and he pulled out a
[1:37:26] tract they said where will you spend
[1:37:29] eternity
[1:37:31] and so he just looked at him well i'm
[1:37:33] just going to toss it or whatever but he
[1:37:34] looked at it again
[1:37:36] and he read it again and he started to
[1:37:37] wonder said i'm a 40 year old man
[1:37:39] i've he said i've got to settle this yes
[1:37:42] sir
[1:37:43] hey man listen we've got to settle
[1:37:44] things in our life
[1:37:46] because we try to run from trials we try
[1:37:49] to run
[1:37:49] from circumstances we try to run from
[1:37:51] the calling of god
[1:37:52] same thing adam did we try to run we
[1:37:55] tried to put it off
[1:37:56] and listen you'll tire out before your
[1:37:58] trials do
[1:38:00] you get weary before your problems do
[1:38:02] you've got to settle things
[1:38:05] this man said i've got to settle this so
[1:38:07] he starts going to meetings he goes to
[1:38:08] billy graham's
[1:38:09] they said if you if you accept the lord
[1:38:11] jesus christ is your savior
[1:38:12] you say this sinner's prayer you do all
[1:38:14] these things he said that'll settle it
[1:38:16] he said i did all that it didn't settle
[1:38:18] it right
[1:38:19] he said i went to the methodist i went
[1:38:21] to the nazarene and they told me if you
[1:38:23] shout
[1:38:23] that'll settle it he said that didn't
[1:38:25] settle it right
[1:38:27] amen he said it went down i think was i
[1:38:29] think it was all robert said it's
[1:38:30] pentecostal meaning
[1:38:31] i went down there and said if you speak
[1:38:32] in tongues and you just that'll settle
[1:38:34] it
[1:38:35] he said i spoke in tongues he said i
[1:38:37] still didn't settle it
[1:38:38] finally they said one day that he would
[1:38:39] not voice a healing said go over to
[1:38:41] brother branham's house
[1:38:42] he'll help you settle in he'll be able
[1:38:44] to tell you if you did something in your
[1:38:45] life somewhere or
[1:38:46] there's something off he'll be able to
[1:38:48] help you out with it so he goes to
[1:38:49] brother brown
[1:38:50] and he tells him this and he begins to
[1:38:52] tell brother brown about this man
[1:38:55] see if there's any hope for his
[1:38:56] condition is there any hope for me
[1:38:58] is there a way for me to get out of my
[1:38:59] condition because i don't want you to
[1:39:01] notice
[1:39:02] this man's condition was in his own mind
[1:39:05] because brother brandon begins to speak
[1:39:06] to this man
[1:39:07] and he says listen billy graham told you
[1:39:08] the truth but not all the truth
[1:39:11] he said the methods they told you the
[1:39:12] truth but not all the truth or obviously
[1:39:14] told the truth
[1:39:15] but not all the truth he said all those
[1:39:17] things are attributes of christ
[1:39:19] is it to receive christ is to receive
[1:39:21] the person
[1:39:22] the lord jesus then these other things
[1:39:27] then these other things will take place
[1:39:29] he said well you think i've ever done it
[1:39:31] or do you think i ever could do it
[1:39:32] i said you've already done it brother
[1:39:37] [Applause]
[1:39:38] so you were going on a road hating
[1:39:40] religion no religion
[1:39:42] and you looked at a little sign and
[1:39:44] something said to you two years ago
[1:39:46] you've saw you've hunted said what
[1:39:48] happened i said what does conversion
[1:39:50] mean
[1:39:51] turned around you were going one time
[1:39:54] without anything
[1:39:55] hating god hating religion going on
[1:39:58] ignoring it
[1:39:59] all at once right there at your desk yes
[1:40:02] sir
[1:40:03] well i thought i'd get a few more amens
[1:40:05] on that right where you were sitting
[1:40:07] right there at your desk you turned back
[1:40:10] up the road
[1:40:11] hunting god seeking god what happened
[1:40:14] you was converted
[1:40:16] he threw his arms around me started
[1:40:18] weeping said brother brown
[1:40:20] i've had it all this time
[1:40:23] he said that's right that's exactly
[1:40:25] right he said you know i went to
[1:40:27] all of them this is profound now and
[1:40:30] they told me i crossed the separate
[1:40:32] listen these men didn't give him any
[1:40:33] hope at all
[1:40:34] you didn't cross the separating line
[1:40:37] said you was a prophet you could tell me
[1:40:38] what was wrong
[1:40:39] watch what brother bram says he says you
[1:40:41] don't need a prophet
[1:40:43] the word settled that
[1:40:46] praise god i think today some of us just
[1:40:49] need to realize
[1:40:50] the word is settled whatever you're
[1:40:51] wrestling with whatever you're dealing
[1:40:53] with well brother brandon was here if
[1:40:55] so-and-so was here
[1:40:56] listen the word settled it for you
[1:41:00] and sell it even if you didn't realize
[1:41:02] it like this man
[1:41:03] yes sir many times oh hallelujah
[1:41:07] just like them crossing the jordan we
[1:41:09] going we're looking for something
[1:41:10] ignorant that we possess it already
[1:41:15] come on brother you think of all the
[1:41:17] rich and powerful
[1:41:19] influential men in the world today and
[1:41:21] they're staying at five-star hotels and
[1:41:23] they've got
[1:41:23] jumbo jets and they've got money and
[1:41:25] they've got all this stuff and they've
[1:41:27] got problems
[1:41:28] and they don't know how to deal with it
[1:41:29] they're like that rich young ruler
[1:41:31] right down there you get a dollar
[1:41:32] general for uh for a dollar dollar
[1:41:34] general
[1:41:34] for the dollar tree right there's a
[1:41:36] bible right there's what they need right
[1:41:38] there
[1:41:39] they stay in hotels and the word of
[1:41:41] god's land right there
[1:41:43] how many times in our own life we're
[1:41:45] waiting for an answer
[1:41:47] right it's like i said i said this years
[1:41:49] ago i said people they're waiting on a
[1:41:51] phone call from god and here he doesn't
[1:41:52] send him a letter
[1:41:54] god's already told you that you've got
[1:41:56] what you need he's already made promises
[1:41:58] to you amen
[1:42:00] many people like this man they're going
[1:42:02] around trying to settle the issue
[1:42:04] what you need is already here
[1:42:09] it's already done you've got to
[1:42:11] recognize
[1:42:12] god settled that for you
[1:42:14] [Music]
[1:42:19] they're waiting for that what's that man
[1:42:21] waiting for he's went for a sensation or
[1:42:23] something
[1:42:23] well praise the lord well i don't know
[1:42:27] why i make apologies for this i'm not
[1:42:28] going to i guess
[1:42:30] you know you you look at i try to think
[1:42:33] how to say it
[1:42:35] you look at people you know i was
[1:42:36] talking to a sister years ago
[1:42:38] and we were praying for her for a
[1:42:39] certain condition and she began to tell
[1:42:41] me well
[1:42:42] a certain minister told me years ago
[1:42:44] that when you pray you'll feel this
[1:42:45] certain thing and this certain thing
[1:42:46] will happen and i'm thinking
[1:42:47] that that man told you wrong you might
[1:42:50] feel that
[1:42:51] you might not feel a thing but his word
[1:42:54] is true regardless
[1:42:56] with his stripes you're already here
[1:43:00] [Music]
[1:43:02] i look in my own life and maybe this is
[1:43:03] my experience but when god's done some
[1:43:05] of the most
[1:43:06] profound or powerful things that god's
[1:43:08] ever done my life i wasn't emotional
[1:43:10] about it all right i actually i stood
[1:43:12] there like i was watching god do
[1:43:14] something now i got pretty happy about
[1:43:15] it afterwards
[1:43:17] don't get me wrong i was like man that
[1:43:18] was cool man that's awesome
[1:43:21] but listen the emotion wasn't a
[1:43:22] vindication to me
[1:43:24] neither was my own intellectual idea
[1:43:26] when god comes and god does something
[1:43:28] it's completely contrary to my own
[1:43:30] thinking
[1:43:31] yet it's exactly the word of god whether
[1:43:33] the sensation
[1:43:34] or no sensation it don't matter when god
[1:43:37] brings it god brings it to pass
[1:43:40] this man was waiting for something but
[1:43:42] what he needed was that
[1:43:44] bride of jesus christ quit waiting for
[1:43:46] god to do something for you when he
[1:43:48] cried out on the cross
[1:43:50] it's finished it wasn't safe 2000 years
[1:43:54] or 10 years ago or 20 years ago you were
[1:43:56] saved that day at calvary
[1:43:58] the price was already paid whatever you
[1:44:01] have need of today god has given it into
[1:44:04] your hands
[1:44:07] see most people they live in condition
[1:44:10] brother graham calls it spiritual
[1:44:11] amnesia
[1:44:13] we forget these things that's why we
[1:44:14] need to be reminded
[1:44:16] hopefully not just on sunday or just
[1:44:18] wednesday we need to be reminded every
[1:44:20] day
[1:44:21] amen what brings spiritual amnesia when
[1:44:23] you get halt between two opinions
[1:44:26] well i know god said this but
[1:44:29] spiritual amnesia the christian doesn't
[1:44:32] have to qualify what god said
[1:44:34] the christian takes him at his word
[1:44:36] because he's never lied
[1:44:38] and he's never failed amen
[1:44:41] don't let the enemy take from you don't
[1:44:43] let a preacher or whatever
[1:44:44] don't let anybody take from you god has
[1:44:46] already given you something
[1:44:48] i mean it's what you already possess and
[1:44:51] the enemy wants to rock
[1:44:52] listen he can't rob you unless you have
[1:44:54] it in the first place that's right
[1:44:56] listen nobody here can come and rob a
[1:44:58] million dollars for me after service
[1:44:59] i ain't got it but your enemies comes a
[1:45:03] thief
[1:45:03] to steal to kill and destroy because he
[1:45:06] realizes
[1:45:06] who's got the goods
[1:45:10] there's some possessors here today they
[1:45:12] possess
[1:45:13] eternal life they're holding it in their
[1:45:15] bosom
[1:45:16] they are possessors of it right now and
[1:45:19] the devil would love nothing more
[1:45:20] than to come and take it from you but
[1:45:22] you know what he's got no rights on my
[1:45:23] property
[1:45:24] [Music]
[1:45:27] that's right i got a big old sign up not
[1:45:29] in my actual yard
[1:45:30] spiritually speaking i got this big old
[1:45:32] sign up on my yard
[1:45:33] trespassers will be shot on side don't
[1:45:36] let the enemy step one foot on your
[1:45:38] ground
[1:45:40] it's time to serve him notice you don't
[1:45:42] belong here
[1:45:43] get out of my house i didn't ask you
[1:45:46] here
[1:45:47] i didn't invite you here i'm sure not
[1:45:48] going to make you comfortable here
[1:45:51] god give me what i need
[1:45:56] the same one that begun a good work in
[1:45:57] you he's faithful to finish it
[1:46:01] hey man listen it's him that works in
[1:46:03] you
[1:46:04] to will and to do his good pleasure not
[1:46:05] even your own idea
[1:46:08] amen praise the lord well hallelujah
[1:46:12] i thank god for all his gifts and all
[1:46:14] his blessings
[1:46:17] the only character is through a victory
[1:46:21] that means you got a fight on your hands
[1:46:24] you're never gonna get it without a
[1:46:25] fight
[1:46:28] hey man you're just gonna have to fight
[1:46:30] like i said inch by inch
[1:46:31] hey man and i don't want to re and i
[1:46:33] think i i touched on this a little bit
[1:46:34] last time i was preaching about the
[1:46:36] masterpiece
[1:46:36] but i want you to realize he said i'll
[1:46:38] give it to you little by little
[1:46:40] amen sometimes god gives you your
[1:46:42] promise just a little bit at a time
[1:46:44] don't get discouraged with that slow
[1:46:46] progress is not no progress
[1:46:49] slow progress is not the same as no
[1:46:51] progress god did that for a reason with
[1:46:53] them
[1:46:54] that's the same thing that isaiah said
[1:46:55] he'll give you knowledge he'll give you
[1:46:57] revelation
[1:46:58] little by little moses told the people
[1:47:00] i'll give you the land
[1:47:01] little by little why so that it won't be
[1:47:03] overrun
[1:47:05] see god's not interested in just giving
[1:47:07] you the land he wants you to live there
[1:47:10] we get so caught up trying to get
[1:47:12] somewhere but god's not worried about
[1:47:14] getting you there
[1:47:15] he wants you to live there these
[1:47:17] promises
[1:47:18] this purpose of god this possession it's
[1:47:21] more than just a place we're going to
[1:47:22] visit
[1:47:23] we're not just coming in for a vacation
[1:47:27] i mean i don't come to church to go on
[1:47:28] vacation for my problems
[1:47:31] some people treat church like it's a
[1:47:32] treat religion like it's a drug it's
[1:47:34] just a way of escape from my problems
[1:47:36] it's a way to get away from this for a
[1:47:37] few hours
[1:47:38] listen i have to ordain to live in this
[1:47:39] place
[1:47:41] i want them to live this gospel not just
[1:47:43] preach it
[1:47:45] god doesn't want to just give us a
[1:47:47] visitation he wants us to be a
[1:47:48] habitation
[1:47:50] [Applause]
[1:47:51] and if you're making any progress at all
[1:47:53] it might be an inch a day
[1:47:55] but god gives you that inch and you
[1:47:56] don't ever have to give it back
[1:48:00] see that's the difference between just
[1:48:01] giving you a piece of dirt on the ground
[1:48:03] and saying this is your eternal
[1:48:04] inheritance
[1:48:05] whatever you take possession of you
[1:48:07] never have to give it back
[1:48:09] [Music]
[1:48:10] once you possess that it's yours for
[1:48:12] eternity amen
[1:48:15] the devil will say well yeah you you had
[1:48:17] this joy yesterday
[1:48:18] you had peace but listen this is a
[1:48:20] different day
[1:48:22] but the promise is still the same
[1:48:25] god is still the same i don't have to
[1:48:27] forfeit one centimeter to him
[1:48:34] amen praise the lord

[1:50:59] the world ever tell you that
[1:51:01] listen this message is more hated and
[1:51:03] persecuted today than it was a year ago
[1:51:05] or two years ago or 20 years ago or 30
[1:51:07] years ago
[1:51:09] and don't ever get in your mind that
[1:51:10] somehow you're just gonna be accepted by
[1:51:12] people one day
[1:51:13] it's never gonna happen but you're
[1:51:15] accepted by
[1:51:16] god and that's what matters amen
[1:51:25] the scripture in the scripture in mark
[1:51:27] chapter 11.
[1:51:29] jesus says he says have faith in god
[1:51:32] actually if you look at the scripture in
[1:51:34] the greek it says have the faith of god
[1:51:36] have god's faith amen he doesn't give
[1:51:39] you his faith
[1:51:40] see that's what i'm saying we get this
[1:51:42] well i just don't have the faith for
[1:51:43] this well if you've got god's faith you
[1:51:44] do
[1:51:44] yes sir well praise the lord listen
[1:51:48] jesus own disciples came to him one day
[1:51:51] said lord increase our faith he's like
[1:51:53] no
[1:51:56] if you've got faith the size of a
[1:51:57] mustard seed you can speak to a tree
[1:51:59] you can speak to my it's not that you
[1:52:01] need amen don't let the devil lie to you
[1:52:04] listen if you don't have the faith to
[1:52:06] overcome today it's not going to come
[1:52:08] later
[1:52:08] through some other message there's not
[1:52:11] some other testament
[1:52:13] or some other word of the lord that has
[1:52:14] to come you've got it
[1:52:16] and the enemy will he'll try to bully
[1:52:18] say well you don't have faith for that
[1:52:19] well maybe i don't
[1:52:21] but god does and god's in me and god
[1:52:24] believes the promise
[1:52:25] god in you is more than enough to meet
[1:52:27] the challenge
[1:52:28] of this hour
[1:52:30] [Applause]
[1:52:32] if you've got god on the inside of you
[1:52:34] you're more than a match for the devil
[1:52:37] you're more than a match for the world
[1:52:39] you're more than a match
[1:52:41] for the eyes the lust of the eyes and
[1:52:43] the pride of life and the lust of the
[1:52:44] flesh
[1:52:44] he's more than a match god does not
[1:52:48] hallelujah god is not contending with
[1:52:51] the enemy today
[1:52:52] he has already defeated him he has
[1:52:55] already overcome the world
[1:52:58] let's quit acting like we've got someone
[1:53:00] just don't want me to make it we're only
[1:53:01] one
[1:53:03] what are you talking about
[1:53:10] you say this mountain right not if he
[1:53:13] says it
[1:53:14] or your pastor or the deacon or brother
[1:53:16] out if you say
[1:53:18] be thou removed and don't doubt in your
[1:53:20] heart but believe
[1:53:21] what you've spoken will come to pass you
[1:53:23] can have it
[1:53:25] brother brown's talking about this when
[1:53:26] he's out in the woods one day he talks
[1:53:28] about this scripture he says well i
[1:53:29] thought why does that scripture keep
[1:53:31] coming to me
[1:53:32] when i can't preach on it
[1:53:35] i've been there you know i i've had a
[1:53:37] thought coming before i'm like i mean i
[1:53:38] can't preach this it was it was years
[1:53:39] later
[1:53:40] the lord's like remember that thing amen
[1:53:42] there's a season to it sometimes
[1:53:45] amen see we're trying to discern the
[1:53:48] season of things not the circumstances
[1:53:49] around them
[1:53:51] because when you begin to discern the
[1:53:52] season around a thing
[1:53:54] that's when you begin to have an
[1:53:55] understanding of the harmony of god's
[1:53:56] purpose
[1:53:58] he said how can i i could he said i
[1:54:00] could not go go before a congregation
[1:54:02] and try to explain that scripture
[1:54:04] they said well i sat there a little bit
[1:54:05] i thought well there's only one thing to
[1:54:06] do
[1:54:07] if i'm ever called to preach on that
[1:54:09] subject here's the way i'll do it see he
[1:54:10] had his own idea well i'm going to do
[1:54:12] this
[1:54:13] he said well jesus told the disciples
[1:54:14] and gave them that authority that was
[1:54:15] about
[1:54:16] a year and six months before the
[1:54:17] atonement was made so if it wasn't in
[1:54:19] the atonement was on the other side of
[1:54:20] the atonement
[1:54:21] so if anybody ever asked me that
[1:54:23] question i'll just tell them it was on
[1:54:24] the
[1:54:24] other side of the atonement it's the
[1:54:26] only thing i know because jesus
[1:54:28] was still living the atonement was not
[1:54:30] made and he was not wounded for our
[1:54:32] transgressions
[1:54:33] nor by his stripes were healed yet so he
[1:54:35] just gave them that power on the
[1:54:37] other side of the atonement he said but
[1:54:39] then all of a sudden
[1:54:41] something spoke to me and said what
[1:54:43] about the prophets
[1:54:45] well i begin to see it then see it's
[1:54:47] different when you see it
[1:54:49] it began to unfold to me what do you
[1:54:52] think had taken place in the meeting
[1:54:53] when you're standing listen he'd done
[1:54:55] this before
[1:54:56] and he didn't even recognize it
[1:55:00] how many times in our own lives as
[1:55:02] christians does god do something in our
[1:55:04] life
[1:55:05] like that man and we don't even
[1:55:06] recognize each other oh that was god all
[1:55:08] this time
[1:55:09] and we thought it was just us we thought
[1:55:11] it was just a whim
[1:55:12] or we thought it was just something and
[1:55:13] here was god doing something
[1:55:15] and you can look back and read this even
[1:55:16] when i didn't realize it god was doing
[1:55:19] something with my life
[1:55:21] in my life he how many god has spoken
[1:55:23] things in your life and you don't you
[1:55:25] sit there i don't even know why i said
[1:55:27] that and yet it was god doing it
[1:55:29] yes sir brother yes sir
[1:55:32] very good that's it's a it's an amazing
[1:55:36] thing when you can recognize god has
[1:55:37] done things in your life you're like oh
[1:55:38] i didn't realize it was god
[1:55:40] maybe the other person didn't realize it
[1:55:41] was god at the time
[1:55:43] oh praise the lord amen he says this
[1:55:48] he says do you think you're the one who
[1:55:50] knows those people
[1:55:52] do you think that it's you that can
[1:55:53] predict and say to those people that
[1:55:55] you're going to do a certain certain
[1:55:56] thing and a
[1:55:57] certain certain thing has to happen a
[1:55:59] certain certain thing will happen to you
[1:56:00] do you think that that's you saying it
[1:56:03] he says oh my it means so much
[1:56:05] it never left me i love it when god
[1:56:09] really brings something together in life
[1:56:11] it'll never leave you when you really
[1:56:13] have a revelation of god
[1:56:15] as jesus christ is your savior
[1:56:17] personally the baptism the holy ghost
[1:56:19] that never leaves you you might this
[1:56:22] this body might be eaten up by skin
[1:56:23] worms you might go through sickness
[1:56:25] you might even lose your mind amen god
[1:56:28] forbid
[1:56:29] but no matter what happens that'll never
[1:56:31] leave you
[1:56:34] amen i thought surely not lord it's you
[1:56:38] well then who do you think it's talking
[1:56:40] you think it's you talking he says no
[1:56:42] do you think it was the prophets talking
[1:56:44] had you
[1:56:46] had not you just got through preaching
[1:56:49] on the subject
[1:56:50] that the prophets were so anointed with
[1:56:53] the holy spirit
[1:56:54] that it wasn't them that done the
[1:56:55] speaking it was the holy spirit
[1:56:59] in them crying out then whatever you say
[1:57:02] if you're anointed i really feel to
[1:57:04] qualify that here for just a second
[1:57:06] if you're anointed wouldn't it be you
[1:57:08] saying it it would be the holy spirit
[1:57:11] saying it
[1:57:13] i think that's a very important
[1:57:14] qualification and i minister i think on
[1:57:16] the idea of inspiration here a while
[1:57:17] back at this church even
[1:57:19] and that's why i feel that way because
[1:57:20] you don't exercise this authority
[1:57:22] through your flesh it's not exercised by
[1:57:26] by by your emotions it's not exercised
[1:57:29] by your own intellectual understanding
[1:57:31] and many people in this message we can
[1:57:33] talk about authority
[1:57:34] we can talk about the the how god
[1:57:37] ordains certain
[1:57:38] things but it's one thing to just say
[1:57:39] well god's given us authority
[1:57:41] what kind of authority amen
[1:57:44] listen a man is omnipotent if he's
[1:57:47] submitted to god
[1:57:50] he's not omnipotent like it's a knife he
[1:57:52] just swings it around like you know what
[1:57:53] i'm going to see the dead race day well
[1:57:55] i want to be you know
[1:57:56] it don't work that way when god comes
[1:57:58] and gives an inspiration
[1:57:59] it might even bypass your own
[1:58:01] understanding but yet it's god that's
[1:58:03] done it amen
[1:58:05] and when that inspiration comes listen
[1:58:07] jesus himself said i can do nothing
[1:58:09] except the father shows me first now if
[1:58:12] it's like that with our lord jesus
[1:58:14] why would it be any different with you
[1:58:15] and i
[1:58:18] now how god reveals that to you might be
[1:58:20] different than how he reveals it to me
[1:58:21] yep the way god revisit to you might be
[1:58:24] different than the way he revealed to
[1:58:25] you before
[1:58:27] sometimes god will deal with you in a
[1:58:28] different way than he's done before
[1:58:31] to see if you're able to if you're
[1:58:33] willing to submit to the plan of god
[1:58:36] because many times we are caught up in
[1:58:38] the form or
[1:58:39] or how something is done and it's got to
[1:58:41] be done this way glasses i can i can do
[1:58:43] more than you can think i can do
[1:58:45] exceeding abundantly above that
[1:58:48] amen right so it's not something that's
[1:58:50] emoti and i've see
[1:58:52] you've probably seen these people they
[1:58:53] get intellectually or emotionally
[1:58:55] motivated
[1:58:56] and we start making these declarations
[1:58:58] there's no power in that
[1:59:00] when god gives the inspiration
[1:59:03] amen when you can discern us the voice
[1:59:06] of god and speak the will of god
[1:59:08] that's what brings it to pass these
[1:59:10] prophets the bible says
[1:59:11] they speaking old time not by their own
[1:59:13] will
[1:59:14] it wasn't the will of men they were
[1:59:16] moved by the holy ghost
[1:59:19] this bride she's moved by the holy ghost
[1:59:22] she's got thus saith lord and she knows
[1:59:25] what he wants done with him
[1:59:27] that means she also knows what he
[1:59:29] doesn't want done with it
[1:59:32] that's right brother
[1:59:36] says well i thought well that's right if
[1:59:38] the person
[1:59:39] through the atonement sanctified by the
[1:59:42] blood of jesus christ
[1:59:43] can live into such a sphere with god so
[1:59:45] close he can be wrapped so
[1:59:47] completely in god by the blood of jesus
[1:59:50] it wouldn't be him talking
[1:59:53] amen it would be the holy spirit
[1:59:55] speaking those things he said
[1:59:57] and no more than i had said that the
[1:59:59] anointing of the holy spirit struck me
[2:00:01] like i never had it before in all my
[2:00:03] life god knows that
[2:00:04] i raised up to my feet yes sir
[2:00:07] and watch this i raised it to my feet i
[2:00:09] got scared
[2:00:11] what yeah i mean the holy ghost can do
[2:00:13] that yeah he can do that too
[2:00:15] yeah it's not always oh praise god i got
[2:00:17] the victory
[2:00:18] listen john felt down like a dead man
[2:00:20] daniel felt down like a dead man
[2:00:23] you don't know what it's going to do to
[2:00:24] you but it'll do something
[2:00:28] amen something said to me now this is
[2:00:29] the beginning of your new ministry
[2:00:33] now ask what you will and it shall be
[2:00:34] given to you you say why do you bring
[2:00:36] this up
[2:00:37] i believe his new ministry is our
[2:00:39] ministry because it's just a
[2:00:40] continuation
[2:00:41] of the son of man in the bride body so
[2:00:44] what he was doing there is what he's
[2:00:45] doing now
[2:00:46] he's giving inspiration he's speaking
[2:00:49] he's moving in the hearts of the
[2:00:50] believer
[2:00:51] to bring to pass amen if you say
[2:00:54] god's gonna take your mouth not just
[2:00:56] mine he's gonna take your mouth and make
[2:00:58] declarations
[2:01:00] and and he's going to say things things
[2:01:02] that might even bypass your own
[2:01:04] understanding and he's going to bring
[2:01:05] them to pass
[2:01:08] today
[2:01:11] i believe that's today because i believe
[2:01:14] god's always speaking
[2:01:15] maybe we don't always listen real well
[2:01:17] but god's always speaking
[2:01:19] [Music]
[2:01:20] if you can catch the voice of god today
[2:01:22] god is looking to do something
[2:01:23] with your tongue amen because death and
[2:01:25] life are in your tongue
[2:01:28] that's right listen brother and so when
[2:01:30] you become a christian
[2:01:31] you got a checkbook yes sir that
[2:01:34] checkbook
[2:01:35] jesus made a deposit for that at calvary
[2:01:37] and every redemptive promise
[2:01:38] everything that atonement is in that
[2:01:40] checkbook and jesus christ signed it at
[2:01:42] the bottom amen
[2:01:42] an adopted son of god after mount
[2:01:45] transfiguration
[2:01:46] he signed that checkbook and that checks
[2:01:49] is good it's good for any redemptive
[2:01:50] promise
[2:01:51] but brother ram said when a man when a
[2:01:53] son comes into his own adoption
[2:01:55] his name on the checkbook it's as good
[2:01:58] as daddy's
[2:02:00] we all believe that jesus christ's name
[2:02:02] on that book is as good as his father
[2:02:04] it's the same name but when you
[2:02:05] recognize your name
[2:02:07] you can say you can speak with authority
[2:02:11] as an adopted son of god knowing the
[2:02:14] will of your father and it will come to
[2:02:16] pass
[2:02:21] everything that adam lost brother has
[2:02:23] been restored you believe that
[2:02:25] everything what did he lose he lost a
[2:02:28] book of redemption
[2:02:30] where did it go into the hands of the
[2:02:31] original owner where did it go from
[2:02:33] there
[2:02:33] revelation 10 tells you where it went
[2:02:35] from there it went into the believers
[2:02:37] it went to the mighty angel to the
[2:02:39] seventh angel and then he gave it to
[2:02:41] somebody
[2:02:41] yes sir oh hallelujah does anybody know
[2:02:44] he gave it to
[2:02:44] he give it to somebody somebody's going
[2:02:46] to receive it
[2:02:48] somebody's going to eat the book
[2:02:50] somebody's going to speak the word
[2:02:52] somebody's got to prophesy again
[2:02:55] this is the day for there is no other
[2:02:57] day for it to come to pass
[2:02:59] this is the hour we're the sons of god
[2:03:01] we'll speak the word
[2:03:02] and it will be manifested
[2:03:04] [Music]
[2:03:05] [Applause]
[2:03:06] i'm not trying to convince you
[2:03:07] intellectually but once you realize it's
[2:03:09] been declared
[2:03:11] i'm not trying to convince you to get
[2:03:13] excited and say and try to you know
[2:03:15] make your house bigger or whatever or
[2:03:17] get a promotion work because you feel
[2:03:18] like it
[2:03:19] because many times those things are
[2:03:20] opposite the will of god
[2:03:23] what i'm saying is can you recognize the
[2:03:25] time that we're in
[2:03:27] recognize these signs of these things
[2:03:28] they've appeared to increase
[2:03:30] to encourage to stimulate your faith let
[2:03:32] me say that way
[2:03:33] you've got the faith you need but these
[2:03:35] things are here to stimulate your faith
[2:03:37] that you'll put it into action
[2:03:43] listen joshua one day he'd come there to
[2:03:46] the
[2:03:47] fight for the giving us of beth haran
[2:03:48] and he began to speak a word
[2:03:50] and that man was delegated that
[2:03:52] authority by god almighty
[2:03:54] amen he was given a commission and you
[2:03:56] and i we've been given a commission
[2:03:59] it's not just been given to us we've
[2:04:00] inherited it through through our father
[2:04:04] and that man spake and the very son
[2:04:07] stood still
[2:04:11] the the moon held its place in the
[2:04:13] valley amen
[2:04:14] all right i like how brother graham says
[2:04:16] it he didn't go on a 40-day fast
[2:04:18] he didn't get down and pray about it he
[2:04:19] didn't have to go make a bunch of
[2:04:20] sacrifices
[2:04:21] he was in the line of duty amen how many
[2:04:24] how many fighters we got in the line of
[2:04:25] duty today
[2:04:27] listen you've showed up here today
[2:04:29] because brother brown said this is your
[2:04:30] post
[2:04:31] of duty you're in the line of duty today
[2:04:35] and you've got a need the inspiration
[2:04:37] come on him and brother bram said he
[2:04:39] didn't fumble around his mind
[2:04:40] he didn't try to think it through it
[2:04:42] come upon him it seized upon this man
[2:04:44] and he spoke something unthinkable
[2:04:49] but guess what it come to pass remember
[2:04:51] there's a paradox to see something
[2:04:53] that seemed to be impossible yet it's
[2:04:55] true the sun
[2:04:57] stood still says the bible i says i
[2:05:00] don't know what you people think
[2:05:01] that means the world is run now or
[2:05:03] however but the sun stood still
[2:05:06] perhaps joshua never had tried to figure
[2:05:08] out how i was going to do it
[2:05:09] how god was going to do it the only
[2:05:10] thing he said was son
[2:05:12] stand still he said it perhaps not
[2:05:15] knowing what he was saying
[2:05:20] because it was god that gave it to him
[2:05:22] amen
[2:05:23] and he worked he says he god god worked
[2:05:28] same thing in mark 11. if you say this
[2:05:29] about same scripture amen
[2:05:31] so brother is tying it in together it's
[2:05:33] the same thing today
[2:05:34] so it's not just for joshua listen god
[2:05:37] didn't do that for joshua
[2:05:38] just for joshua so joshua could feel
[2:05:41] good about himself
[2:05:42] but there was a people there that he
[2:05:44] would manifest it to
[2:05:45] to bring them into their position amen
[2:05:48] this one brother man is hot and
[2:05:49] squirrels and god says you've got needed
[2:05:51] squirrels
[2:05:52] i don't know that brother brand was
[2:05:53] starving amen
[2:05:55] what was the need the need was for the
[2:05:57] manifestation
[2:05:58] of the third pull for you and i to
[2:06:00] realize that god
[2:06:02] still does the same thing today
[2:06:05] this is the great need the need of the
[2:06:07] hour is the bride of jesus christ
[2:06:09] to overcome because the world's groaning
[2:06:12] and travailing for it
[2:06:14] right
[2:06:17] he says you can't stand there and fumble
[2:06:18] in your mind so you've got to be
[2:06:20] inspired to say it
[2:06:22] you know what it's like i say this if
[2:06:23] this message don't inspire you i don't
[2:06:25] know what will
[2:06:26] hey man if we're feeding on this word
[2:06:28] you feed on this hey man don't just
[2:06:29] nibble on it hey man
[2:06:31] make this your diet all right
[2:06:34] man i tell you what my my younger
[2:06:37] daughter jana she's uh
[2:06:39] she's become my personal trainer
[2:06:43] i'm like well i guess i need it then
[2:06:47] she's got this this saying i hope she
[2:06:49] don't mind this
[2:06:50] she's got this sanctions the more you
[2:06:51] eat the more you weep
[2:06:56] i'm like thanks sweetheart she said you
[2:06:58] can't have any wheat
[2:07:00] you can't have any sugar you can't have
[2:07:02] this and you can't have that i'm
[2:07:03] thinking but why is that because it's no
[2:07:05] good for you
[2:07:06] hey man you've got to eat the right you
[2:07:08] can't just not eat the wrong things
[2:07:09] you've got to eat the right thing and
[2:07:11] many times we abstain from all the wrong
[2:07:13] things
[2:07:14] but we've got to feed on the right thing
[2:07:16] this is your spiritual meet and do
[2:07:18] season
[2:07:19] that's going to give you strength to
[2:07:20] overcome the trial of this hour is this
[2:07:22] message amen
[2:07:24] we ought to esteem this word more than
[2:07:26] our necessary food amen
[2:07:28] this word will bring an inspiration we
[2:07:30] can have a confidence
[2:07:32] knowing what was delivered to us amen
[2:07:35] listen if we don't have confidence in
[2:07:36] this we might as well stay on the other
[2:07:37] side of jordan
[2:07:39] amen because once you get confidence in
[2:07:42] this message
[2:07:43] once you realize you're following joshua
[2:07:45] it doesn't matter how many giants are in
[2:07:46] the land
[2:07:47] it doesn't matter how wild the cities
[2:07:48] are it doesn't matter how many
[2:07:50] philistines are over there
[2:07:51] god has already given the land into your
[2:07:53] hand
[2:07:54] amen there was five kings that come up
[2:07:58] to fight joshua that day
[2:07:59] and then kings come out and they were
[2:08:01] fixed you know what they they they were
[2:08:03] in for rude awakening
[2:08:04] they thought they were going to go set
[2:08:05] them israelites straight and put them in
[2:08:07] their place but they found out that day
[2:08:09] that their destiny was not their own to
[2:08:11] command
[2:08:12] amen they went out there to make war on
[2:08:13] the people of god and guess what
[2:08:15] they found themselves hiding in a cave
[2:08:17] yes sir right
[2:08:18] and then they were hiding a cave by the
[2:08:20] end of the day because it's one thing
[2:08:22] when you defeat an enemy
[2:08:23] it's another thing when you humiliate an
[2:08:25] enemy
[2:08:27] well i thought i'd get a few more amens
[2:08:28] on that one listen jesus christ has not
[2:08:31] only defeated satan
[2:08:33] he has humiliated him this message has
[2:08:36] come to expose satan
[2:08:37] he's a liar he's a bluff he has no power
[2:08:41] he doesn't even have the keys to his own
[2:08:43] house the bible says when he
[2:08:45] defeated the powers of darkness jesus
[2:08:48] spoiled them
[2:08:49] he made a show of them openly
[2:08:52] he marched him down the street naked
[2:08:55] exposed
[2:08:56] as a defeated enemy listen god is not
[2:08:59] looking just to show you
[2:09:00] that satan's defeated he's looking to
[2:09:02] humiliate satan
[2:09:04] through you he's going to manifest his
[2:09:08] manifold wisdom
[2:09:09] through you that the lowest the basis
[2:09:12] the weakest things of the earth
[2:09:14] he's still more than a match for the
[2:09:16] enemy
[2:09:20] these five kings they hid in the cave
[2:09:21] and and joshua he puts a rock over it so
[2:09:24] they can't go nowhere
[2:09:25] and he goes and he wins the battle and
[2:09:26] he comes back and says bring him out
[2:09:28] here
[2:09:29] i want you to bring him out here and
[2:09:31] joshua does something i think it's a
[2:09:32] real good idea
[2:09:33] joshua says i'm gonna go up here i'm
[2:09:35] gonna go for this king i'm gonna put my
[2:09:36] neck
[2:09:37] my foot on his neck take that sugar
[2:09:39] diabetes
[2:09:41] take that blindness take that mind
[2:09:44] battles
[2:09:46] take that depression god has put me over
[2:09:49] you
[2:09:49] i am humiliated not just the foot
[2:09:52] soldier but the very kings
[2:09:54] the very powers the very commanders i've
[2:09:57] humiliated them
[2:09:58] and then joshua invites his commanders
[2:10:00] to come here he says i want you
[2:10:02] to do the same thing
[2:10:06] jesus christ has not only defeated every
[2:10:08] enemy for us
[2:10:09] he's invited us i want you to come
[2:10:12] and put your foot on that that filthy
[2:10:14] defiled philistine
[2:10:18] listen if god could overcome it 30 years
[2:10:20] ago 60 years ago
[2:10:22] the invitation today is that the god of
[2:10:24] peace will put satan
[2:10:26] under your feet
[2:10:29] amen how are we going to call him out
[2:10:31] today amen
[2:10:32] listen you've been given an authority to
[2:10:34] call him out
[2:10:36] don't leave him in the cave how saint
[2:10:39] wants to hide their lives
[2:10:40] he'll try to find little places in our
[2:10:42] lives he'll try to hide there
[2:10:43] and say well you can't overcome this and
[2:10:45] you can't let so-and-so know about this
[2:10:47] and
[2:10:47] you can't deal with this problem but if
[2:10:49] i were you i would drag him out in the
[2:10:51] light today
[2:10:53] because the light has exposed him he is
[2:10:55] defeated
[2:10:56] pull him out of the cage you make your
[2:10:58] confession
[2:10:59] i might have dealt with this for years i
[2:11:01] might have suffered with this problem
[2:11:03] i might have had this mind battle i
[2:11:05] might have dealt with this addiction
[2:11:06] but today i'm pulling you out of the
[2:11:09] i refuse to let you stay in there
[2:11:11] another day god has given me an
[2:11:13] authority
[2:11:13] to put my foot on your defeated neck
[2:11:17] you pull them out today you take your
[2:11:20] voice listen you don't have to come up

[2:11:53] a place in my possession
[2:11:55] you've got no place in my life you and i
[2:11:58] we can't dwell on the same

[2:12:02] us

[2:12:33] been fought amen
[2:12:37] you know jesus told pilate he said my
[2:12:40] kingdom is not of this world
[2:12:42] because if it was then my servants would
[2:12:44] fight

[2:13:56] nothing to be afraid of you're the one
[2:13:58] to be afraid of

[2:14:02] don't he doesn't fear your humanity
[2:14:04] he doesn't fear your intelligence he
[2:14:06] doesn't for your position at work he

[2:14:38] and while the world's getting pulled in
[2:14:39] more and more we're lifting off
[2:14:42] we're rising up we are not the same as

[2:14:52] bodies of the fallen enemies
[2:14:54] that have tried to beset us in our life
[2:14:57] we will not suffer satan
[2:14:58] one more inch in my land i'll not suffer
[2:15:02] him another day
[2:15:03] [Applause]

[2:15:14] may they begin to speak to the
[2:15:16] circumstances in their life that have
[2:15:18] tried to discourage them
[2:15:19] and tell them it can't be for them that
[2:15:21] there's no way they'll ever overcome
[2:15:23] may they begin to speak to the
[2:15:24] situations that have beset them
[2:15:26] the different sins that have tried to
[2:15:28] beset them may they lay aside every
[2:15:30] weight
[2:15:32] may they begin to take their voice by
[2:15:34] inspiration with authority
[2:15:36] and claim every promise that belongs to
[2:15:38] them
[2:15:40] lord may they not suffer the enemy to
[2:15:41] set foot in their land may they not
[2:15:43] compromise one more inch
[2:15:44] of this possession this is a time
[2:15:48] of war we'll have plenty of time for
[2:15:51] peace in the millennium
[2:15:52] we'll have plenty of time to settle down
[2:15:55] and have a good time later
[2:15:56] now the battle is raging right now is
[2:15:59] not the time
[2:16:00] to sit down and sip tea right now i
[2:16:03] don't have the time to sit down
[2:16:04] and take it easy this is the time when
[2:16:06] the battle is the hottest
[2:16:08] this is the time to do as the prophet
[2:16:11] himself was told
[2:16:12] to press the battle
[2:16:16] the harder laodicea pushes the harder
[2:16:19] darkness pushes the harder the enemy
[2:16:21] tries to push against us
[2:16:22] the harder the spirit of crash than us
[2:16:24] is going to push back
[2:16:26] you promised you'd raise up a standard
[2:16:28] when the enemy would come in
[2:16:29] lord i believe there's a standard here
[2:16:31] today the message of the
[2:16:32] hour has come to give us prevailing
[2:16:34] power
[2:16:40] oh hallelujah
[2:16:44] there's a people here today they are the
[2:16:46] head and not the tail
[2:16:49] there's a people here today
[2:16:53] they have already passed from death
[2:16:56] unto life we've got some fighters in the
[2:17:01] building today i believe
[2:17:03] they're not looking to fist a cuff with
[2:17:05] their brother
[2:17:07] they're not looking for an earthly
[2:17:09] revolution to fix the world
[2:17:11] but the revolution of a human heart to
[2:17:15] turn from the powers of darkness
[2:17:17] towards the marvelous light of our lord
[2:17:19] jesus christ lord that's the revolution
[2:17:21] today
[2:17:22] that's the power that overthrows
[2:17:23] darkness today in our lives
[2:17:26] our confidence is in this great
[2:17:28] commander the captain
[2:17:30] of the hosts of the army of the lord
[2:17:32] there's no jericho
[2:17:34] there's no giant there's no kings can
[2:17:37] stand before us
[2:17:43] oh lord god
[2:17:46] i pray there for every need that's here
[2:17:48] today
[2:17:50] your prophet said faith settles it lord
[2:17:53] we're not looking at circumstances today
[2:17:57] for our circumstances can deceive us
[2:18:00] we're not looking at emotions and
[2:18:02] feelings today
[2:18:04] for they can lie to us many times our
[2:18:06] senses have lied to us
[2:18:08] our feelings have lied to us our own our
[2:18:10] own human intellect has deceived us
[2:18:12] at times but lord i can testify you have
[2:18:15] never once lied to me
[2:18:17] you've never once failed me you've never
[2:18:19] once let me down
[2:18:22] lord you've never once delivered me into
[2:18:24] the hand of mine enemy
[2:18:27] you've never once cast me off lord when
[2:18:29] am i in my bed in hell
[2:18:31] you were there lord then
[2:18:34] the thousands shall rise up against me
[2:18:38] i will not fear i will be confident
[2:18:41] [Music]
[2:18:44] oh heavenly father
[2:18:48] i look at this group of believers here
[2:18:50] today precious
[2:18:52] brothers and sisters in christ what a
[2:18:54] what a wonderful testimony
[2:18:58] i can stand as paul and testify of what
[2:19:01] you've done with this group of believers
[2:19:02] their faith
[2:19:03] with charity lord i pray now lord when
[2:19:06] the battles at this hottest
[2:19:08] may they not fool now may they not give
[2:19:11] up may they redouble their efforts
[2:19:14] may they double down on the enemy today
[2:19:16] and serve them in eviction notice
[2:19:19] we will not forfeit this message
[2:19:23] we will not give up this eternal life
[2:19:25] [Music]
[2:19:28] we refuse to compromise with the enemy
[2:19:33] there's no reconciliation with him
[2:19:36] there's no middle ground
[2:19:39] we will utterly defeat him
[2:19:43] through the power of our lords and
[2:19:44] savior jesus christ lord it's in your
[2:19:46] name
[2:19:47] we ask these things i pray to bless this
[2:19:49] group for every need here today
[2:19:51] every knee that was lifted up every
