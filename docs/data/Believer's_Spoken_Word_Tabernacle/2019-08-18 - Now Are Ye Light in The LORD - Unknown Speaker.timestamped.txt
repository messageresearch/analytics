[33:42] if it ever gets away from that then

[33:53] to a place that God has given us and set
[33:58] aside to come in to worship Him
[34:01] and to hear from him and yet if that's
[34:06] where the worship begins and ceases
[34:09] that's still not the worship that he's
[34:13] looking for me God he never came that we
[34:17] would have a church life he's that
[34:20] that's not a true worship true
[34:23] worshipers go to church but a true
[34:25] worshiper worships him in spirit and in
[34:29] truth every day of our life is a warship
[34:34] unto God what we say and what we don't
[34:38] say the way that we conduct our lives
[34:40] it's worship unto God amen

[36:13] verses of Scripture
[36:20] and if there's any visitors here if
[36:23] we've overlooked you god bless you
[36:24] you're welcome this morning amen if you

[36:29] and it looks like you're a visitor well
[36:34] we can change that amen god bless you
[36:39] this morning
[36:40] Ephesians chapter 5 and just two verses
[36:43] of Scripture and then we'll just let
[36:45] we'll just look to the Lord here verse 8
[36:48] Ephesians 5 verse 8 for ye were
[36:51] sometimes darkness but now are ye light
[36:58] in the Lord walk as children of light I
[37:03] want you to notice that scripture it
[37:06] didn't say we were in darkness it said
[37:10] we were darkness we were darkness but
[37:15] now are ye light in the Lord not just in
[37:20] the light but our light remember jesus
[37:24] said when he was here he said I as long
[37:25] as I am in the world his compound
[37:28] meaning as long as I'm in the world I am
[37:30] the light of the world and that same one
[37:33] that same Lord Jesus turns to you and I
[37:36] and announces in the book of Matthew
[37:39] says ye are the light of the world so
[37:44] there's in order to be the light there's
[37:46] got to be light come has to be light to
[37:51] come but now are you light in the Lord
[37:54] walk as children of light
[37:56] wherefore verse 14 just skip down to
[37:59] that one wherefore he saith awake thou
[38:03] that sleepest and arise from the dead
[38:08] and Christ shall give the light
[38:15] notice verse 14 as it says wherefore he
[38:19] saith this is his word he speaks awake
[38:24] thou that sleepest and arise from the
[38:27] dead and Christ shall give thee light

[41:19] Oracles of God or father by the unction
[41:23] of the Holy Ghost may you take control
[41:25] this morning oh god lord i bind every
[41:28] unclean spirit Lord in the name of Jesus
[41:32] Christ Lord every demon spirit that
[41:34] would want to hinder Lord and seek to
[41:37] assert itself over the children of God
[41:39] Satan we call you a liar in the name of
[41:42] Jesus Christ you're nothing but a bluff
[41:44] and my Lord Jesus Christ has defeated
[41:47] you you're a liar and you must take your
[41:50] hands off of God's children so in the
[41:53] name of Jesus Christ we cast you from
[41:56] this building in the name of Jesus
[41:58] Christ for the glory of Almighty cause
[42:01] in Jesus precious name Amen amen
[42:07] god bless you as you're being seated
[42:08] this morning amen if you would turn with
[42:15] me also to the Book of Luke I want to
[42:18] just begin in there here this morning in
[42:21] the Book of Luke and just looking at
[42:25] this this part of what the Lord Jesus is
[42:30] is expressing to our hearts now we're
[42:35] talking we a couple weeks ago and we
[42:37] were dealing with this the light of God
[42:39] and true worshipers we realized that
[42:44] we're not talking about natural light
[42:47] yet natural light itself is a type it is
[42:52] a shadow the Sun itself that we're
[42:55] enjoying the light of today it is eight
[42:58] of the Son of God himself just as the
[43:03] moon is a type of the Church of the
[43:07] Living God where that the moon herself
[43:10] is to show forth a witness of the Son of
[43:16] God and his absence she has no light of
[43:18] her own she only reflects light and so
[43:23] when we're looking at this of the light
[43:25] of God the scripture tells us in the
[43:28] book of John chapter 1 that this light
[43:31] that we're speaking of is that light
[43:35] that lighteth every man it's the light
[43:39] that is also the life it's something
[43:42] that's greater than just our natural
[43:45] life because we we have life but yet
[43:49] Jesus as he spoke and here the coming of
[43:52] the Messiah he said I am come that you
[43:55] might have life and that you might have
[43:58] it more abundantly
[43:59] so it's something and I love that phrase
[44:02] in that scripture where more abundantly
[44:05] it means beyond what you can even
[44:07] imagine and so we recognize there's a
[44:11] greater life than what just a life that
[44:14] we have and you know even though as we
[44:18] walk within this life we can have many
[44:20] disappointments we can have many times
[44:23] of up and many times of down but yet
[44:26] when that life has come within us it
[44:29] gives to us within our hearts an
[44:32] expectation that goes beyond just the
[44:35] circumstances that we are in it's a
[44:38] strength it's a light it's his life that
[44:41] comes to guide and direct us in in in
[44:45] our lives through this life so here the
[44:49] Lord Jesus as is expressing this in Luke
[44:52] 11 verse 33 no man when he hath lighted
[44:57] a candle a candle can't light itself
[45:01] right nobody has a self-lighting candle
[45:04] but a candle is made to be lit
[45:08] I know we have sometimes we have candles
[45:10] around for decorations but the reality
[45:13] of when candle when I was growing up the
[45:15] electricity would go off the reason we
[45:17] had candles was not because of their
[45:19] smell it was tool item when the
[45:21] electricity went out that's why we have
[45:24] so that you could see your way around
[45:26] the house in the country so here we
[45:30] understand that a candle has a part
[45:32] about it that can be lit and here Jesus
[45:36] said no man when he hath lighted a
[45:39] candle because it takes the Lord Himself
[45:43] to light the candle in our life no man
[45:48] when he have lighted a candle put it in
[45:51] a secret place neither under a bushel
[45:54] but on a candlestick that they which
[45:59] come in may see the light so the focus
[46:03] when this candle has been lit it's
[46:06] placed on a candlestick that those who
[46:09] are entering might see the light so the
[46:13] focus is not on the candle but the
[46:16] candle is only that which is displaying
[46:19] that light that has come to it so now
[46:24] look how Jesus says this in verse 34 the
[46:28] light of the body is the eye and this is
[46:33] something that you know I would love to
[46:35] just preach on a little more here on
[46:36] verse 34 but you recognize it is very
[46:40] very it's very crucial on what we give
[46:43] our eyes to the light of the body is the
[46:48] eye
[46:49] therefore when thine eye is single thy
[46:53] whole body also is full of light but
[46:55] when thine eye is evil thy body also is
[47:00] full of darkness take heed therefore
[47:04] that the light which is in thee be not
[47:08] darkness Maya what a contrast light in
[47:13] me but the light in me be darkness so
[47:16] Jesus is saying take heed that what
[47:18] light is there within
[47:20] you that it is not darkness now remember
[47:23] Satan he claimed to Eve in the beginning
[47:26] and Paul picks this up in 2nd
[47:28] Corinthians 11 Paul the Satan came to
[47:33] Eve and he came bringing what would seem
[47:36] of a greater light upon the Word of God
[47:40] but in actuality what Satan was doing
[47:44] was substituting or he was bringing
[47:47] darkness into the very life now if she
[47:52] did not have to go along with it
[47:54] remember it was by self-will deception
[48:00] you know the spirit of deception fell
[48:02] and then you find that then it became
[48:05] darkness yet leave herself believe what
[48:09] she had was light you see the light when
[48:13] it is the light of God within our lives
[48:16] I want you to listen to me closely when
[48:18] it is the light of God that is in our
[48:21] life and working through our lives it
[48:23] will not be out of sync or out of
[48:26] harmony with the Word of God but the
[48:29] light of God within us it brings us in
[48:32] harmony and continuity with the Word of
[48:36] God because now it is his life being
[48:39] expressed through you and I it is the
[48:43] absolute manifestation that there is a
[48:47] fellowship between us and God when light
[48:52] itself is reflected and made manifest
[48:56] through our lives so notice in verse 36
[48:59] for if thy whole body therefore be full
[49:04] of light having no part dark the whole
[49:07] shall be full of light as wind the
[49:11] bright shining of a candle does give
[49:15] thee light now we all want to be fooled
[49:19] only no part dark we want to be full
[49:24] full light fully surrendered now notice
[49:27] what David says here in 2nd Samuel 22 29
[49:31] for Thou art
[49:33] my lamp Oh Lord thou art my lamp Oh Lord
[49:39] and the Lord will lighten my darkness
[49:45] the brother branham makes this statement
[49:47] we're familiar with this and who is this
[49:49] milk hezid I kind of want you to listen
[49:50] this wording here we are formed to the
[49:54] word image to be a partaker of the word
[49:58] feed on the word by being predestinated
[50:01] since the beginning you see that little
[50:05] spark of life that you had in you from
[50:09] the beginning when you started your
[50:12] journey so when you started the journey
[50:15] it was a spark of life they said now
[50:19] many of you can remember it you joined
[50:21] this church you joined that church you
[50:23] tried this and that nothing satisfied
[50:27] that's right but one day you just
[50:29] recognized it you see there is already
[50:34] light with light itself or life that was
[50:39] resting within us in that of the seed
[50:42] that God had sown within our heart but
[50:45] there is nothing that can satisfy that
[50:49] life outside of God's own life the as
[50:55] brother brand was putting it here you go
[50:57] from this church to this church you go
[50:59] from here to there but there's something
[51:01] that's not satisfying it's not
[51:04] ministering or meeting the deep that's
[51:07] calling out of the deep in your life
[51:09] there can be a lot of good programs a
[51:11] lot of good things but yet there is only
[51:14] one thing to a believer that ministers
[51:17] to you and I and that is the very life
[51:20] of God church life will never do it they
[51:24] just said to you like this coming to a
[51:26] church will never satisfy a believer and
[51:30] you see this is why that winning is just
[51:34] church life this is why there is such a
[51:36] need for so many other programs and so
[51:40] many other things to try to hold the
[51:43] or to bring people but there's one thing
[51:46] that brings and holds the children of
[51:49] God and that's the gospel of the Lord
[51:52] Jesus Christ for it is the power of God
[51:55] on the salvation because we're not
[51:58] interested in a good church life we're
[52:01] interested in his life and this is why
[52:06] that when the substitute of that life
[52:09] very is a thirst that is within man and
[52:14] man will thirst he will crave he is
[52:17] hunger but brother and sister it's not
[52:19] bad to hunger and thirst but it is what
[52:22] we are hungry and thirsting for you see
[52:25] you can tell what you have in your life
[52:28] by what type of thirst and what type of
[52:31] desires that you have in your life
[52:34] that'll tell you what's on the control
[52:37] tower now God has placed that there and
[52:40] there's no way that you and I can find
[52:42] it but it takes the leadership of God to
[52:46] direct us to where that we ought to be
[52:49] brother I hope you understand this is
[52:51] much bigger than you are I this is not
[52:54] our ingenuity our figuring out this is
[52:58] the four-nation of Almighty God and when
[53:03] I look at this how that the scripture
[53:06] would place it in Colossians 1 verse 12
[53:09] it says giving thanks unto the Father
[53:12] which hath made us meet and that word
[53:16] meat is qualified to be partakers of the
[53:20] inheritance of the Saints in light it
[53:24] was always it's an inheritance the life
[53:27] of God it is an inheritance that was
[53:30] given to us from before the foundation
[53:33] of the world Paul would say it in
[53:36] another place in Ephesians chapter 1
[53:38] that through the offering of the Lord
[53:40] Jesus Christ we have obtained and
[53:43] inheritance the inheritance was already
[53:45] there but in order for the inheritance
[53:47] to be released there not only had to be
[53:50] that of the testator that to witness of
[53:54] the in hell
[53:55] presents that belong to us but then in
[53:57] order to receive what is wrote in the
[54:00] will there must be the death of the
[54:02] testator that he which has let you and I
[54:05] know what belongs to you and I then now
[54:09] it can be released to us there had to be
[54:11] a death a suffering of the Lord Jesus
[54:15] Christ a payment that was paid for our
[54:18] ransom that that life God's own life our
[54:22] inheritance that belonged to us that
[54:25] that could be released to us and there
[54:27] isn't no one else who did this but the
[54:30] father himself becoming one of us Jesus
[54:35] is not the second person in the Godhead
[54:37] if we were redeemed by the second person
[54:40] were still in sin but it took not coming
[54:44] down and creating a body that he would
[54:46] step into and he by his own life would
[54:50] demonstrate to you and I the inheritance
[54:53] of what it is to be a son and daughter
[54:56] of God he was the perfect example amen
[54:59] so we have been qualified he has
[55:02] qualified you know what qualified means
[55:04] you have a right where they had no
[55:09] access before now you have access floor
[55:13] rabida God you say I'm not qualified but
[55:16] he he has qualified us to be partakers
[55:21] of the inheritance of the Saints in life
[55:24] who hath delivered us from the power of
[55:28] darkness and hath translated us into the
[55:31] kingdom of his dear son in whom we have
[55:35] redemption through his blood even the
[55:38] forgiveness of sins now oxygen I want to
[55:41] read this here to you brother Alan picks
[55:44] this up in this thought he keeps moving
[55:46] this thought around within this series
[55:48] around this timeline of in 1961 and and
[55:52] I want you to understand this as we're
[55:54] looking into this there were so many
[55:56] things that when we look at the message
[55:58] that God has sent to you and I there is
[56:01] a continual unfolding of God's desire
[56:04] and purpose that he has ordained for you
[56:07] and I
[56:08] and for the hour that we're living in it
[56:11] is the ministering of the rights that
[56:13] belong to us as believers and you know
[56:17] brother Branham you know I think God how
[56:19] that the Holy Spirit would take it and
[56:21] put it in such a simple measure of the
[56:24] working of the Holy Ghost in our life
[56:26] and he would say it like this and the
[56:28] message why remember when a man is saved
[56:31] he said it like like there's this much
[56:34] like this button here becomes eternal
[56:36] life in your heart that's God as you're
[56:40] able to push out all the roots of
[56:42] bitterness then God begins to spread in
[56:45] you then you become a son of God now
[56:49] remember you we don't become a son and
[56:51] daughter of God by a church by church
[56:55] life but remember in order for you and I
[56:59] to be here there had to be two parts
[57:01] come together they had to be egg and
[57:04] sperm come together is that right in
[57:06] order for you and I to come forth and
[57:08] that is the same way that it is with God
[57:12] but God does not take anything from us
[57:15] but what it is God has placed within our
[57:18] hearts that seed of himself that when
[57:21] his seed life comes upon that seed it is
[57:26] through that that he breeds back sons
[57:29] and daughters of God again there is no
[57:32] weakness within that DNA as a matter of
[57:36] fact this is where that you and I can
[57:38] stand upon the word that our birth is
[57:41] not a church live but as the scripture
[57:45] said we are not born a flesh born of
[57:48] blood but we have been born of God amen
[57:51] the Holy Ghost amen
[57:54] our mother and hear God our Father the
[57:56] same one working within our life to
[57:59] bring forth that expression my how God
[58:07] has allowed these things to be so simple
[58:10] before us he said a man was made to be a
[58:13] God to be gone he says he's in the image
[58:15] of God he's the son of God he's like God
[58:17] he was given a domain
[58:19] a Dominion over the whole earth he ruled
[58:22] the earth he ruled the animal kingdom
[58:25] and all the other kingdoms all but the
[58:27] kingdom of God above he was God he was
[58:30] an amateur God he was made in the image
[58:33] of God made like God had hands and feet
[58:36] like God he was in the image of God this
[58:41] is what God had said I will restore I
[58:46] will make a way back that that image can
[58:51] come into expression once again
[58:56] Alleluia the Lord Jesus Christ is the
[59:00] one that restored and he was the witness
[59:03] the faithful and true witness that
[59:06] testified on behalf of the inheritance
[59:10] of the image of God that belongs to the
[59:13] children of God mmm Oh hallelujah he
[59:18] said but what happened because he
[59:20] disbelieved God's Word it sent him right
[59:23] back out to shift for himself my when
[59:29] this when unbelief comes you're on your
[59:31] own
[59:33] but faith and God's Word brings God on
[59:36] the scene a very simple statement I know
[59:39] but that applies to everything in our
[59:40] life faith in God's Word that God is
[59:46] faithful he knows where you're at
[59:49] he knows the needs in our life unbelief
[59:52] can put us to where we're starting to
[59:54] try to do it on her own and when we try
[59:57] to do anything on our own
[59:58] it takes us away from the program and
[1:00:01] purpose of God hello somebody but faith
[1:00:08] in his word
[1:00:09] it makes us available for God to work on
[1:00:14] our behalf and that the program and
[1:00:16] purpose of God will flow in harmony and
[1:00:20] continuity in our life times we let too
[1:00:25] many distractions
[1:00:27] get ahead of us come on somebody
[1:00:31] sometimes we let we let that go on but
[1:00:34] thanks be to God for light that'll show
[1:00:36] that up he said now God's trying to
[1:00:38] bring him back and when you have faith
[1:00:41] and you accept him my brother just let
[1:00:44] that little light begin to grow out
[1:00:46] taking out all the roots of doubt and
[1:00:48] bitterness this is a key point when you
[1:00:50] have faith
[1:00:52] it requires there has to be a beginning
[1:00:56] in your life let me just say it very
[1:00:59] bluntly if you come here to church and
[1:01:01] you never ever made a stand for the Lord
[1:01:05] Jesus Christ
[1:01:06] you're not even where I'm preaching at
[1:01:08] this morning you've got to make a
[1:01:11] decision
[1:01:12] you can't stay neutral any man well I'm
[1:01:18] okay how I have no we're not okay how we
[1:01:21] are Jesus spoke in job three he was
[1:01:25] speaking to a man that you couldn't put
[1:01:27] a finger on his life by the name of
[1:01:30] Nicodemus as a matter of fact he was a
[1:01:33] member of the Sanhedrin one of the
[1:01:36] Pharisees and Jesus called those men
[1:01:38] righteous but Jesus never came to call
[1:01:42] the righteous to repentance you can put
[1:01:47] a finger on their life but nonetheless
[1:01:49] they had to be born again I tell you
[1:01:55] there is no substitute for the new birth
[1:01:58] no no substitute I don't care how good
[1:02:03] you are how good you think you are your
[1:02:06] goodness is nothing but filthy rotten
[1:02:08] rats they men were not gotten interested
[1:02:12] in your righteousness you see how
[1:02:14] foolish it sounds if we begin to think
[1:02:17] about our own righteousness then why did
[1:02:19] he have to come and shed his blood you
[1:02:24] say we're gonna send you I believe he
[1:02:26] did that for me then it's time for you
[1:02:27] to make a stand and repent and say Lord
[1:02:32] forgive me I am a sinner
[1:02:35] I need salvation let me just tell you in
[1:02:41] case you don't know hell is paved for
[1:02:44] people who know about God the rich young
[1:02:48] ruler is there and he asked he made a
[1:02:52] request he said since some of my sent
[1:02:55] some of the prophets and go send them
[1:02:57] back where he could look across India
[1:02:59] hams bosom the promise he send him back
[1:03:02] sinned
[1:03:03] don't let my brethren come here don't
[1:03:05] let them come here
[1:03:06] but he said they have the law they have
[1:03:09] the prophets if they won't hear them
[1:03:12] they will not receive the one comes back
[1:03:15] from the dead friend don't you realize
[1:03:18] how blessed it is to be able to have
[1:03:21] faith to believe to have faith to
[1:03:27] believe that God would touch your heart
[1:03:31] God deals to every man a measure of
[1:03:34] faith he passes by and he raises the
[1:03:38] faith just in his simplicity
[1:03:40] whether Svensson might be in the church
[1:03:42] might be in a hospital room might be
[1:03:44] somewhere but here the witness of the
[1:03:46] Holy Ghost can go forth and begin to
[1:03:48] deal with the heart and let them know
[1:03:50] that there is one who's already paid a
[1:03:53] price for you and you can be free
[1:03:55] brother I'm telling you a word spoke
[1:03:58] like that but the unction of the Holy
[1:04:00] Ghost
[1:04:01] it raises faith within the heart to
[1:04:03] believe you know this is the promise
[1:04:05] that the Lord Jesus has made if I be
[1:04:08] lifted up I will draw all men unto me
[1:04:16] now looking to a church but looking to
[1:04:18] him so watch this and when you have
[1:04:20] faith
[1:04:22] God can't do nothing with our faith and
[1:04:27] accept him my brother just let that
[1:04:31] little light begin to grow out
[1:04:35] remember what says what's the desire is
[1:04:38] that the candle would be put on the
[1:04:41] candlestick that when people enter the
[1:04:44] room they're not even focused on the
[1:04:47] candle they just see light so you see
[1:04:53] the focus isn't about us it's about him
[1:04:57] so if the focus is about him then that's
[1:05:00] what it has to be through every stage of
[1:05:03] the journey notice he takes out let's
[1:05:06] let that little light begin to grow out
[1:05:08] taking all the roots of doubt and
[1:05:11] bitterness yielding yourself to the
[1:05:15] spirit then you begin to become a son of
[1:05:18] God a daughter of God you begin to grow
[1:05:20] in the grace of God and the Holy Spirit
[1:05:23] begins to build his kingdom within you
[1:05:28] brother Branham he goes on in here in
[1:05:30] the uncertain sound and he says now as i
[1:05:34] illustrated like a button when a man is
[1:05:38] saved that much of him is god that's the
[1:05:43] little light that comes in to make you
[1:05:46] quick doing what's wrong well I stop
[1:05:53] this if you stopped it you have to keep
[1:05:55] its tongue yeah but when he comes in
[1:06:03] this is what he does why light presses
[1:06:07] darkness we want our lives full of like
[1:06:13] what light presses darkness jesus said
[1:06:16] and brother Breton tells like this he
[1:06:18] said we just don't want darkness you
[1:06:20] know placed out of us we want to press
[1:06:23] that darkness clear to the other side of
[1:06:26] the earth think about that that's the
[1:06:30] little light that comes into you to make
[1:06:32] you quit doing what's wrong now if you
[1:06:34] can take all
[1:06:35] the malice and envy and strife and
[1:06:38] unbelief out over the center how am I
[1:06:43] going to do that by agreeing with the
[1:06:46] world as it is exposing and showing
[1:06:51] things that need to be removed light
[1:06:58] makes known darkness remember the Bible
[1:07:02] says in John three that this is the
[1:07:06] condemnation that light is come in the
[1:07:08] world and because men rather loved
[1:07:12] darkness they would not come to the
[1:07:15] light they wanted to remain doing what
[1:07:20] they were doing oh but there was some
[1:07:23] who what they were doing they didn't
[1:07:25] want to do and so in light has come what
[1:07:29] did like do like drew them to the very
[1:07:33] one to the source that could actually
[1:07:36] ignite and life that combustible part
[1:07:40] within their life and light itself
[1:07:42] pushes out darkness hid in the belt I
[1:07:47] gotta quit doing this and I gotta quit
[1:07:49] doing this and I gotta quit doing this
[1:07:51] it's letting the light grow within your
[1:07:54] life
[1:07:57] oh my that little button like of the
[1:08:02] light and power of God will keep growing
[1:08:05] growing growing crowding out unbelief
[1:08:12] crowding out what's it doing the light
[1:08:16] is casting out darkness because the
[1:08:19] light is coming in its crowding out
[1:08:21] unbelief and then allowing the world to
[1:08:25] have free course and all right it crowds
[1:08:27] how humbly you know how it is sometimes
[1:08:30] it's easy for things to get crowded out
[1:08:32] you can let your schedule get so booked
[1:08:34] up to where Jesus is crowded out you
[1:08:38] know I'm saying now things can get
[1:08:40] crowded out why how things come in and
[1:08:43] this is here when we look at the light
[1:08:46] and the power of God let it continue to
[1:08:48] grow within our lives removing all the
[1:08:52] roots of bitterness and malice and all
[1:08:54] of those things why that it will crowd
[1:08:56] out all unbelief you see it isn't you
[1:08:59] doing it it is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:02] himself
[1:09:03] doing it we've got a yield somebody said
[1:09:10] lord help me yield help me yield lord
[1:09:14] help me yield he said you don't do it by
[1:09:19] exhortation zuv bodily exercise you do
[1:09:23] it by a sanctified consecrated life that
[1:09:28] the holy spirit moves through you now
[1:09:34] let's just work that thought just a
[1:09:35] moment Philippians chapter 2 verse 12
[1:09:39] wherefore my beloved as ye have always
[1:09:43] obeyed not as in my presence only but
[1:09:47] now much more in my absence so what are
[1:09:52] we looking at obedience obedience is
[1:09:56] what submission
[1:09:58] they meant not just when Paul was
[1:10:00] present but in their in his absence
[1:10:02] notice work out your own salvation with
[1:10:05] fear and trembling they meant it shows
[1:10:10] us right here in the scripture that
[1:10:12] obedience itself there is a wrestling
[1:10:16] that goes on obedience itself the flesh
[1:10:22] will draw against it
[1:10:25] amen once you have that soul what's that
[1:10:28] soul has been converted on the inside
[1:10:31] then you've got strength right there in
[1:10:34] your wrestling but listen now if you're
[1:10:36] working to that place or that's where
[1:10:39] you're at that takes obedience to the
[1:10:41] world it isn't well I'm just going to
[1:10:43] sit here until God fills me with the
[1:10:45] Holy Ghost the Bible said he gives the
[1:10:48] Holy Ghost to them that obey amen obey
[1:10:54] with faith in the world God cannot do no
[1:10:58] more for you if you're not walking in
[1:11:01] the light of his word in obedience it's
[1:11:05] not just when we're here just saying a
[1:11:07] man is the beginning when we receive
[1:11:10] that word but obedience it takes prayer
[1:11:13] obedience takes dying obedience takes
[1:11:16] letting go and letting God have his way
[1:11:19] we are tested with every word that comes
[1:11:22] our way
[1:11:24] but brother with the light of God and
[1:11:26] the power of God within our life if we
[1:11:29] can just yield to him he crowds out all
[1:11:35] the unbelief what's he doing he's taking
[1:11:39] over the body
[1:11:41] amen like he took over the body when it
[1:11:44] came up there you know it went there in
[1:11:46] the in the Dark Ages that went in the
[1:11:48] grave there and there and that's a
[1:11:50] tyrant age but then it came up there
[1:11:53] with with the message that just shall
[1:11:55] live by faith what was drop doing he was
[1:11:58] beginning and work in the body then it
[1:12:01] came that they shall be sanctified by
[1:12:05] the blood what was he doing taking over
[1:12:08] more of the body then it came to the
[1:12:10] restoration of the gift believing in the
[1:12:13] supernatural what was he doing taking
[1:12:15] over more of the body and then it comes
[1:12:18] to the real baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:20] the person of Jesus Christ now he takes
[1:12:24] over the body it is the son of man
[1:12:26] revealed in the bride's body Christ
[1:12:31] taking over how does he take over by his
[1:12:34] word by his word he takes over even when
[1:12:44] he rides back in Revelations 19 the
[1:12:48] Bible says his vesture dipped in blood
[1:12:50] and Nepal upon him was written he meant
[1:12:56] for his name is called the Word of God
[1:12:59] if not that his name is the word of God
[1:13:01] but the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it
[1:13:04] is called the Word of God so what we are
[1:13:07] preaching is the word is the Holy Ghost
[1:13:10] is the name of Jesus Christ we're not
[1:13:13] preaching a characteristic of some
[1:13:15] organization or some man's idea we are
[1:13:19] preaching the very mind and thoughts of
[1:13:22] God because that is exactly what sons
[1:13:25] and daughters of God are learning for
[1:13:27] and need in order to become real
[1:13:31] overcomers they need the thoughts of God
[1:13:33] moving down to collect the thought of
[1:13:36] God that lays within their life and it
[1:13:39] takes God to do it work out your own
[1:13:46] salvation with fear and trembling
[1:13:51] now this hricko this is more than just
[1:13:53] coming to church punch in and punch it
[1:13:55] out hallelujah
[1:14:00] this is working out our own salvation
[1:14:02] with fear not slavish fear oh I've got
[1:14:07] to do this if I don't do this I'm gonna
[1:14:08] go to hell no that's not the kind of
[1:14:10] fear we're talking about we're talking
[1:14:12] about a fear that's a reverence we do
[1:14:15] what we do because we love Him
[1:14:19] home I love this word trembling here it
[1:14:23] is one who the latter part of that it
[1:14:26] describes like an anxiety of one who
[1:14:29] distrusts his ability completely to meet
[1:14:34] all requirements but religiously does
[1:14:38] his utmost to fulfill his duty and you
[1:14:44] and I can make the work come to pass but
[1:14:46] I can give myself to the word and so can
[1:14:48] you
[1:14:50] Amen I can give myself to the word
[1:14:53] coming and and and hearing the preaching
[1:14:55] of the word listening to the message
[1:14:57] that God has given us reading within the
[1:15:00] Scriptures amen and pray amen looking to
[1:15:07] God I can by doing that that is a duty
[1:15:10] that God has given to you and I we ought
[1:15:16] to do that that's this is loaded in the
[1:15:18] scripture Paul would tell Timothy
[1:15:20] Telekom give give time to reading to
[1:15:25] doctrine to exhortation the Bible tells
[1:15:29] us that all Scripture is given by
[1:15:31] inspiration from God it is profitable
[1:15:34] for reproof for rebuke for correction
[1:15:36] for instruction in righteousness you see
[1:15:41] why the enemy wants to visit your time
[1:15:43] up because listen if he can visit your
[1:15:46] time to where the only clap you hear
[1:15:48] anything about the Word of God is when
[1:15:51] you come to church he's got you but
[1:15:53] listen now it's time for you and I to
[1:15:55] get into the word and to know the
[1:15:58] promises that belong to you and I it's
[1:16:01] times with trembling to give ourselves
[1:16:03] fully to God that God can come on the
[1:16:06] scene and say what you were reading it
[1:16:09] was not my chance here I was directing
[1:16:11] this for you this is your promise we're
[1:16:15] not Lodge members
[1:16:18] [Applause]
[1:16:23] don't repeat a gun for it is God which
[1:16:28] worketh in you both to do and and both
[1:16:34] to will and to do of his good pleasure
[1:16:38] Mize God's will and to do of his own
[1:16:44] good pleasure
[1:16:46] this word worketh here let me let's just
[1:16:48] look at this for a moment it's to be
[1:16:50] operative be at work put forth power to
[1:16:55] work for one aid one to effect or to
[1:17:00] display one's activity to show oneself
[1:17:03] operative who is it that's doing this
[1:17:08] God but God remember he will work
[1:17:13] according to his word
[1:17:27] those are switches
[1:17:35] now there's electric coming in this
[1:17:37] building there is a power supply out
[1:17:40] there there is a there is a line that
[1:17:44] comes in here a telephone pole and then
[1:17:46] it comes right back in there they break
[1:17:48] it off there and bring that right into
[1:17:50] the voltage box then there is wiring
[1:17:53] that has to take place in order for
[1:17:57] lights right here to actually benefit
[1:18:00] from electricity that's coming from a
[1:18:02] sending station that electricity has to
[1:18:06] be channelled and has to come into this
[1:18:08] building and there are breakers and
[1:18:10] everything that will actually channel
[1:18:12] that electricity there has to be wires
[1:18:15] that are set up and then wires have got
[1:18:18] to be connected when the wires
[1:18:21] themselves are connected
[1:18:24] remember wires are conductors wires are
[1:18:29] not insulators we put insulin insulation
[1:18:34] or the rubber the plastic outside of
[1:18:37] that wire why so we can touch it so it
[1:18:39] doesn't get hot you know and burn and
[1:18:42] burn here within you know the wood
[1:18:44] that's in here in the in the walls but
[1:18:47] inside of that there is a wire that is a
[1:18:51] conductor that wire does not hinder the
[1:18:54] flow of the current but that wire itself
[1:18:58] is only a channel that the current that
[1:19:02] is coming it actually comes to a place
[1:19:05] that it allows that current to flow that
[1:19:08] once it comes on the filaments of these
[1:19:10] bulbs right here it lights up what does
[1:19:13] that be electricity so when I'm looking
[1:19:16] at the lights I'm not seeing the
[1:19:18] electricity I'm seeing the light but
[1:19:21] there's one thing about it when I look
[1:19:23] at that light I know that there is a
[1:19:25] power source
[1:19:27] that that lie is tapped into I know that
[1:19:30] the wire it's not grounded somewhere
[1:19:33] there's not some part of the word that
[1:19:36] said I don't know about this but every
[1:19:39] wire is in tune with God and what does
[1:19:42] it do it brings a lie
[1:19:44] sure that's where the word the word
[1:19:51] moving in our life it brings the wiring
[1:19:55] the way that it ought to be when the
[1:19:59] wiring gets to where it ought to be then
[1:20:02] he says let there be light it's him
[1:20:06] doing it you see anything in the world
[1:20:09] you say well I don't want to dress like
[1:20:10] that I don't want to stop cutting my
[1:20:12] hair I don't want to stop wearing pants
[1:20:13] or I don't want to stop doing this I
[1:20:15] don't want to stop do it you're
[1:20:16] grounding the power of God well I don't
[1:20:19] believe that's necessary but remember
[1:20:20] you're not the chief electrician he is
[1:20:24] it's your choice whether you want to
[1:20:26] remain in darkness or you want to be lit
[1:20:29] up and be light you're not a Christian
[1:20:32] because you say you're a Christian
[1:20:34] you're a Christian because Christ
[1:20:37] Himself reflects his life through you
[1:20:41] coming to this church does not make you
[1:20:44] a Christian it does not make you a
[1:20:46] believer what makes you a believer and
[1:20:49] declares it is the power of God moving
[1:20:52] in your life and you live a victorious
[1:20:55] Christian life god spoke to Joshua let's
[1:21:05] read this here just a moment God let
[1:21:08] Joshua know your time has come many
[1:21:12] types here that we give to Joshua Joshua
[1:21:16] is the tank of the Holy Ghost a type of
[1:21:20] the Lord Jesus because it takes the Holy
[1:21:23] Ghost to bring us into the promises
[1:21:26] right and then the Prophet would also
[1:21:30] type it then this is a declaration of
[1:21:34] the last a ministry why because Jesus
[1:21:37] Christ the Son of Man would declare to
[1:21:40] the Church of the Living God not just
[1:21:42] some promises but this is the time for
[1:21:45] the fulfilling of all the promises that
[1:21:47] have been made it's a time where shadows
[1:21:50] and types are coming into reality and
[1:21:53] then the Prophet were also under the
[1:21:55] unction of the Holy Ghost were
[1:21:57] also declare that Joshua is a type of
[1:22:00] the spiritual believer so right here
[1:22:04] this morning I want to look at this as a
[1:22:06] type of the spiritual believer so here
[1:22:10] in verse 1 and verse 2 God let's just
[1:22:13] you a know not something that he didn't
[1:22:16] already know
[1:22:17] he knew Moses had died but God's letting
[1:22:23] him know I didn't and God is letting him
[1:22:28] know Moses spoke promises and those
[1:22:33] promises pertain to you
[1:22:35] Joshua you know about them great qu8 you
[1:22:38] remember how you and Caleb stood right
[1:22:40] there on the Word of God
[1:22:42] you remember these promises now Moses my
[1:22:46] servant is dead this is a time for
[1:22:49] transition it's time for you to rise up
[1:22:52] and to take what God says belong to you
[1:22:57] you have the message you've had the
[1:23:00] messenger and he has come to demonstrate
[1:23:03] and to identify to you what belongs to
[1:23:06] you he's lettin Joshua know just to see
[1:23:11] Moses is not enough they met Moses had a
[1:23:16] message that was calling you into your
[1:23:19] inheritance and brother that's what this
[1:23:23] message that God has sent to you and I
[1:23:26] it is a message and a Ministry of our
[1:23:29] inheritance in this hour amen it's
[1:23:35] calling us to the truth baptism of the
[1:23:38] Holy Ghost it's calling us in a third
[1:23:41] Exodus where we are to be taken into
[1:23:44] those bodies that have been prepared the
[1:23:48] rapture is upon the Church of the Living
[1:23:51] God God is announcing it it's time to
[1:23:57] take it in verse 3 he says every place
[1:24:04] but the sole of your foot shall tread
[1:24:06] upon that have I given you as I said
[1:24:11] unto Moses you're not God saying I've
[1:24:13] indicated Moses I've indicated his
[1:24:16] message and now I'm gonna vindicate you
[1:24:19] with that same word my presence as I was
[1:24:24] with Moses I'll be with you also
[1:24:29] every place your sole of your foot
[1:24:33] treads upon God said of our to given to
[1:24:36] you don't that means brother just way it
[1:24:38] means that God had already given it to
[1:24:41] him but they had to have faith to
[1:24:44] believe and claim what God had already
[1:24:47] given I don't care how many booger men
[1:24:52] are all around I don't care how many
[1:24:53] devils that try to scare and try to put
[1:24:56] everything up let me tell you someone
[1:24:57] you go to start taking promises that
[1:24:59] devil will try to hang every sort of
[1:25:02] condemnation you try to put ever tell
[1:25:04] you and every mistake he ever made
[1:25:06] before your face but you need to stand
[1:25:10] under the blood of Jesus Christ and say
[1:25:12] it is not my righteousness it is the
[1:25:15] righteousness of the blood of the Lamb
[1:25:18] and they overcame him by the blood of
[1:25:21] the Lamb and the word of their testimony
[1:25:29] and if you're not fully under the blood
[1:25:32] this scripture also applies for you that
[1:25:34] you can stand and say the Holy Ghost is
[1:25:37] for me yes sir as soon as you begin to
[1:25:44] stand on that you'll find some of that
[1:25:47] that light beginning to grow where you
[1:25:53] first believed and you're believing it
[1:25:57] just keeps growing keeps growing it just
[1:26:04] crowds it out it just crowds it out
[1:26:08] we'll just wait it's like if you and I
[1:26:10] are sitting on this pew right here and
[1:26:12] then everybody on this side tries to
[1:26:13] come up here eventually something gonna
[1:26:15] happen you and I are going kicked off
[1:26:16] this pew you know why because it's just
[1:26:18] people coming in and that's how it is
[1:26:22] when we are receiving the word this is
[1:26:26] why the Prophet could say ask you
[1:26:29] receive the word you become the word
[1:26:34] taking that word in it ain't about
[1:26:36] whether you're worthy or not there ain't
[1:26:38] none of us were they there ain't none of
[1:26:41] us were they in ourselves but it is him
[1:26:44] he rose from the dream he is the
[1:26:46] testimony he is the wetness we are
[1:26:49] justified in believing because of him
[1:26:57] every place that the sole of your foot
[1:27:01] shall tread upon it's time to take
[1:27:04] ground I said it's time to take ground
[1:27:07] but I've given you as I said unto Moses
[1:27:10] and he gives him all the boundaries God
[1:27:14] sets the boundaries of his word from the
[1:27:17] wilderness and this Lebanon even unto
[1:27:20] the great river the river you freeze all
[1:27:22] the land of the Hittites and unto the
[1:27:25] Great Sea toward the going down of the
[1:27:26] Sun shall be your coast God said I know
[1:27:31] there's darkness and there's Devils
[1:27:32] jelled welling there but that land
[1:27:35] belongs to you amen every part every
[1:27:41] part belongs to us as believers oh my
[1:27:47] there shall not look at this in verse 5
[1:27:50] there shall not any man be able to stand
[1:27:55] before thee all the days of thy life now
[1:27:58] you understand why Joshua when he's
[1:28:02] asking for the battle plans of Jericho
[1:28:03] and he sees a man and he looks at that
[1:28:08] man and he says are you for us or are
[1:28:11] you against us you know I he's standing
[1:28:13] on that word because if you're against
[1:28:17] us I've got a promise
[1:28:19] man will be able to stand in our way
[1:28:26] but he announces who he is and because
[1:28:29] Joshua has been feeding on the son of
[1:28:34] man of the world on the revelation he
[1:28:38] recognizes the presence of God as it
[1:28:41] comes into the meeting and what does he
[1:28:48] do he submits himself see in order to
[1:28:51] take Jericho he's got to submit himself
[1:28:56] to the presence of the captain of the
[1:29:02] hosts see it is him who according to his
[1:29:07] will work in you and I sometimes you
[1:29:13] find the way that you have won certain
[1:29:16] battles you don't win all the battles
[1:29:18] with the same pattern but it's the same
[1:29:22] God you know what he's teaching us to
[1:29:25] allow there shall not any man be able to
[1:29:30] stand before thee all the days of thy
[1:29:32] life as I was with Moses so will I be
[1:29:35] with thee I will not fail thee nor
[1:29:38] forsake thee be strongly another good
[1:29:42] courage for unto this people shalt out
[1:29:45] divide for an inheritance the land which
[1:29:48] I swear unto their fathers to give them
[1:29:50] only be thou strong and very courageous
[1:29:53] that thou mayest observe to do according
[1:29:56] to all the law notice according to all
[1:29:59] of it you've got to take all of it which
[1:30:03] Moses my servant commanded thee turn not
[1:30:07] from it to the right hand or to the left
[1:30:10] that thou mayest prosper whether so ever
[1:30:13] valve goest Amen this is God's
[1:30:18] commitment to his word
[1:30:19] hey listen this church is all up and
[1:30:22] down this road in other places that they
[1:30:24] carry Bibles
[1:30:27] they can preach run out of the Bible and
[1:30:29] yet not be preaching the Word of God why
[1:30:33] because they begin to preach the
[1:30:36] traditions and the theories of man and
[1:30:38] what does it reduce it never produces
[1:30:41] victory in people's lives it never
[1:30:43] produces the resurrected Lord Jesus
[1:30:46] Christ but it leaves him in a grave in
[1:30:49] an empty tomb it leaves him in history
[1:30:51] but rather when the Holy Ghost begins to
[1:30:54] declare himself what does it do it
[1:30:58] raises him out of history and it'll
[1:31:02] drive darkness out of your life it
[1:31:06] brings change in your life that's why
[1:31:12] the message that God has sent to us is
[1:31:15] not some strange concoction of a man's
[1:31:18] ideas the message is the original
[1:31:22] message that the Church of the Living
[1:31:25] God is to live by but it was lost down
[1:31:29] through the ages and what is that
[1:31:32] original message that you are to be born
[1:31:35] again you are to have that life on the
[1:31:39] inside of you Christ in you the hope of
[1:31:45] glory you see let me read on here verse
[1:31:55] eight this book of the law shall not
[1:31:56] depart out of that mouth see if you're
[1:31:58] reading it you're observing it it's
[1:32:01] gonna affect your language what you feed
[1:32:08] on will talk about what you think on
[1:32:13] you'll speak about this is why Paul this
[1:32:18] is the Word of God
[1:32:18] this is why the Holy Ghost would speak
[1:32:21] to us put on the helmet of salvation he
[1:32:24] would tell you and I think all things
[1:32:26] better have virtue praise good good and
[1:32:29] true he would direct it let our minds be
[1:32:32] directed in the right way
[1:32:38] so many times you can say out show me
[1:32:41] but that's alright so many times we were
[1:32:44] talking about too much stuff of this
[1:32:46] earth and Satan listen he knows every
[1:32:51] one of us he knows your strengths and
[1:32:54] your weaknesses but let me remind you
[1:32:56] your strengths if it's not covered by
[1:32:59] the blood your strengths can be your
[1:33:01] biggest hindrance your strength it is
[1:33:07] not what God chose me because of my
[1:33:10] strength God didn't need your strength
[1:33:15] amen everything in our life is to be
[1:33:18] governed by the Holy Ghost
[1:33:21] well we're this kind of people and we do
[1:33:24] this and we do that you're advertising
[1:33:26] for the devil and how to take up your
[1:33:27] time and you're a braggart
[1:33:31] that's called pride amen we're not to be
[1:33:36] exalting self exaltation of our own
[1:33:39] family life if you're tapped into the
[1:33:42] tree of life we're to be exalting the
[1:33:44] family of God the life of God that's in
[1:33:47] the tree of life this right here is part
[1:33:54] of the strategy of winning battles this
[1:34:00] book of the law shall not depart out of
[1:34:02] my mouth you've got to start speaking
[1:34:05] what belongs to you I'm not talking
[1:34:12] about like a smiley guy from Texas who
[1:34:14] has a megachurch
[1:34:15] and you're speaking in Mercedes Benz and
[1:34:18] you've got perfect pearly white teeth
[1:34:19] I'm not talking about that stuff I'm
[1:34:22] talking about promises that God makes
[1:34:25] real to you you need to start claiming
[1:34:27] those promises you need to as a prophet
[1:34:30] wrote in the prayer letter he said when
[1:34:32] you take this peripheral and you apply
[1:34:34] to the situation again he said you need
[1:34:37] to doubt your doubts he said and you
[1:34:40] need to call anything contrary to the
[1:34:42] Word of God it's a lie
[1:34:45] stand upon that word you gotta speak the
[1:34:49] word Oh glory be to God
[1:34:55] Omaha therein thou shalt meditate
[1:34:59] therein day and night Oh Lord don't have
[1:35:02] time to check Facebook post brother Sam
[1:35:08] Ian it's like you're trying to run our
[1:35:09] life no I'm not trying to run your life
[1:35:11] Jesus just wants to take you over your
[1:35:13] life but something so many things are so
[1:35:19] fake in this hour you ask people how
[1:35:22] many friends you've got well I got 525
[1:35:24] you're a liar you ain't got 525 friends
[1:35:27] I'm not talking about your cyber friends
[1:35:29] I'm talking about your real friends I'm
[1:35:32] not talking about those so-called people
[1:35:34] that you try to impress and feel the
[1:35:37] pressure I'm talking about some who are
[1:35:39] real but the devil has filled so many
[1:35:45] things to try to take our meditation
[1:35:47] away dear Lord that thou may us observe
[1:35:54] to do according to all that's written
[1:35:56] therein for then thou shalt make thy way
[1:35:59] prosperous and thou shalt have good
[1:36:02] success have not I commanded thee be
[1:36:05] strong and of a good courage be not
[1:36:07] afraid neither be dismayed for the Lord
[1:36:09] thy God is with thee whithersoever thou
[1:36:12] goest when you're standing face-to-face
[1:36:18] with the word you got to be of a good
[1:36:21] courage to be able to stand there and
[1:36:25] say
[1:36:26] yes Lord be it unto me but sometimes
[1:36:31] that word it comes you cuts but
[1:36:36] everything it cuts it's removing
[1:36:39] hindrances its chopping away and all the
[1:36:46] hindrances its suspended good courage
[1:36:50] and when the word comes is to take the
[1:36:52] side of the Lord brother balance said it
[1:36:57] like this and the message messiah mama
[1:36:59] if you haven't listened that message go
[1:37:01] ahead the messiah 1961 he said now you
[1:37:09] don't have to die to get this on what
[1:37:10] this life you have to spiritually die
[1:37:12] but you don't have to physically die the
[1:37:15] inside is where god gets in to control
[1:37:18] you and as he presses himself forward
[1:37:22] don't let any root of bitterness hatred
[1:37:25] malice strife that'll run him right back
[1:37:29] out hmm
[1:37:32] so do you think the devil is just gonna
[1:37:34] sit back and say lights working in their
[1:37:39] life no he's gonna try to hinder oh lord
[1:37:47] you mean he might cause people to do
[1:37:48] things and i think are wrong and then i
[1:37:50] get an attitude about it
[1:37:51] mmm getting it now you mean he might get
[1:37:57] on my boss and close me two men become
[1:37:59] bitter towards him and he's an
[1:38:02] unbeliever yep yeah because the devil
[1:38:05] knows if he can get roots of bitterness
[1:38:07] in your life
[1:38:08] he stifles the work of light but you
[1:38:13] understand if you'll just stand there
[1:38:15] and say lord i need help
[1:38:22] my flesh is saying one thing my spirit
[1:38:27] is being pulled one thing but down here
[1:38:30] on the inside the Son of God Who I am
[1:38:34] they men I'm looking to You Lord you
[1:38:38] fight my battles I give it over to you
[1:38:42] you know what happened rather light just
[1:38:45] steps forward in that area of your life

[1:38:50] box you just put everything in the
[1:38:52] locker you're ready to go check in and
[1:38:55] you're met right there in battle but
[1:38:57] that battle is an opportunity for light
[1:39:00] to step forward well said I'm just
[1:39:08] crowding it out just crowding it out
[1:39:12] pretty soon you don't even feel at
[1:39:14] liberty to act that way y'all have been
[1:39:17] shouting glory on that one I don't even
[1:39:21] have I don't even have the room to act
[1:39:22] out like that anymore
[1:39:23] hmm it's crowding out Jesus has taken
[1:39:27] over he don't want just one little
[1:39:31] office brother he wants the whole
[1:39:33] building
[1:39:34] [Applause]
[1:39:37] oh yeah oh my my my glory be to God
[1:39:45] let's try to find somewhere to get a get
[1:39:48] off here he said you just get all the
[1:39:52] meanness and the superstitions and all
[1:39:56] the unbelief out of you and every time
[1:39:59] you move out a little unbelief God steps
[1:40:02] right in and takes over
[1:40:04] move out unbelief oh my unbelief is what
[1:40:12] is doubt unbelief is what anything
[1:40:15] contrary to the Word of God glory he
[1:40:23] told Joshua everywhere the soles of your
[1:40:25] foot has said that I'll give you and
[1:40:27] tonight as we enter into the kingdom
[1:40:30] God's kingdom taking out all the
[1:40:32] Philistine unbelievers and all the
[1:40:34] amorite sin the Amalekites and whatever
[1:40:36] more throw it out of us like that we
[1:40:40] take possession of em said Amen I like
[1:40:43] that says days of miracles has passed

[1:40:52] footprint there

[1:41:22] around you who's doing it he's doing
[1:41:30] ground is being cleaned he's spreading
[1:41:34] out in our life he's taking over any men
[1:41:39] now notice how Paul would pray for this
[1:41:43] year in Ephesians 3 let me just skip
[1:41:47] over some of this here
[1:41:48] Paul would speak of the burden that is
[1:41:50] upon his heart to preach the
[1:41:53] unsearchable riches of Christ and verse
[1:41:56] 9 to make all men see what is the
[1:41:58] Fellowship of the mystery
[1:42:00] I like fellowship and with the mystery
[1:42:05] you know what the mystery is it's the
[1:42:08] mystery of God the mystery of God is
[1:42:10] Christ in you the Holy Ghost
[1:42:13] I like fellowshipping with the mystery
[1:42:16] and I can fellowship with the mystery
[1:42:19] human when I'm on my riding lawn more I
[1:42:22] can fellowship with the mystery when I'm
[1:42:24] riding down the road get on in one exit
[1:42:28] plug your ears those that you just got
[1:42:29] your temps and driver's license and then
[1:42:31] realize when I get off at another exit
[1:42:34] I can fellowship get so caught away in
[1:42:39] his presence I'm not working nothing up
[1:42:42] but you're not if you just struck
[1:42:44] thinking about a little something and
[1:42:47] before you know it that little thought
[1:42:50] that you just started meditating on it
[1:42:53] just starts taking over and if you think
[1:42:58] on that what does it do it is casting
[1:43:00] out all that gloom oh it's a Monday
[1:43:03] morning
[1:43:04] it's just casting it out man that word
[1:43:08] is just it's a light
[1:43:10] it's ruminating you you find strength
[1:43:17] glory somebody say I think that
[1:43:25] Amen it's available all you have to do
[1:43:29] is think about him but the devil wants
[1:43:33] to try to cram so much else in I got to
[1:43:36] think about this worry about this worry
[1:43:38] about that worry about this worry about
[1:43:40] that some of you know right now that are
[1:43:44] our two older boys here they'll be going
[1:43:47] to college here this coming year and I'm
[1:43:51] telling what's the truth all of the
[1:43:54] paper working things that I've had to do
[1:43:56] and attend to and those you know as
[1:43:58] parents and then I have things that goes
[1:44:00] on you know with even with Benjamin
[1:44:02] where I've got state and everything else
[1:44:04] I got to redo this and do that and do
[1:44:05] this as I'm filing all that I'm telling
[1:44:08] you this because it seems like it just
[1:44:10] things just keep piling up got to sort
[1:44:13] through this and sort through that and
[1:44:14] sort through this and then all of a
[1:44:15] sudden here then I get that paper in
[1:44:18] then I get this one over here and you go
[1:44:21] back you pull up your email the thread
[1:44:22] oh yeah yeah yeah they said mr. brownie
[1:44:25] we got off now I knew they already had
[1:44:28] and I read that email before so what are
[1:44:32] you saying there is things that I enjoy
[1:44:35] I can't control of more responsibility
[1:44:37] that I have you can't control sometimes
[1:44:41] I can't control sometimes come on now
[1:44:45] there's sometimes there's stuff we take
[1:44:47] on we take on that we don't need to be
[1:44:50] taking on oh I never ordained you or me
[1:44:55] to be the savior of the world preach
[1:45:00] brother Santa thank you I will
[1:45:04] but there are things like this that
[1:45:06] you've got to fill out your taxes you've
[1:45:08] got to do this you've got to do that
[1:45:09] sometimes the responsibility grows I was
[1:45:12] thinking there you know just even a
[1:45:13] month or so glass-top you know I I kind
[1:45:16] of wish they were still back in diapers
[1:45:19] it was easier because once they were
[1:45:21] changed they went on their way now
[1:45:24] you're worrying about this and this and
[1:45:26] I'm looking at this and I got this and
[1:45:27] got that and whatever morning I'm not
[1:45:29] saying that to make them feel bad you
[1:45:30] can buy me dinner later but but I what
[1:45:32] I'm trying to say is is that there's
[1:45:34] more responsibility
[1:45:36] I can't shirk that responsibility but
[1:45:39] it's held that I place the priorities in
[1:45:43] my life if I make that first my
[1:45:46] spiritual life will go right down the
[1:45:49] tubes
[1:45:50] and this church because I'm the pastor
[1:45:53] will suffer with it so it's about how
[1:45:58] you prioritize things you're not always
[1:46:01] going to be able to shirk it and boy I'm
[1:46:04] gonna live a real victorious life and
[1:46:06] when it gets to December oh praise God
[1:46:08] everything will slow to hell in December
[1:46:11] and then every day of your life you're
[1:46:16] called to live in victory
[1:46:18] it's just the devil that wants to try to
[1:46:22] make you feel like I can't get this done
[1:46:25] I gotta get this time I got to do this I
[1:46:26] got to do this and then I'll have time
[1:46:28] for this over here and by the time you
[1:46:30] get to this over here your life
[1:46:41] it's priorities even in the starting of
[1:46:46] our day started with the lamb I'm not
[1:46:55] telling you for some of you that are
[1:46:57] about ready to faint like Oh Lord I've
[1:46:58] got to get it at 5:00 in the morning and
[1:47:00] go into prayer coughing now I'm telling
[1:47:02] you that cuz you probably fall asleep
[1:47:03] what I'm trying to tell you is you start
[1:47:07] your day with the Lord take that verse
[1:47:14] of scripture take that verse of
[1:47:17] scripture that pops up take that pray
[1:47:22] and say Lord guide me today why because
[1:47:27] this is a day I want you to take ground
[1:47:30] in my life a day where it spreads out in
[1:47:34] my life and he's in you taking over one
[1:47:42] of these days one of these days it'll be
[1:47:47] the final step the final taking over
[1:47:54] will take us home
[1:47:58] what's he doing he's taking over in our
[1:48:01] life let's just stop here lord have your
[1:48:09] way have your way Lord I'd say that
[1:48:14] across the building if you haven't
[1:48:16] surrendered your life to the Lord would
[1:48:18] you do that today not because brother
[1:48:20] Samuel has mentioned that to you but
[1:48:22] wouldn't you just just to serve him and
[1:48:25] let him it's not trying to please a
[1:48:28] church but it's let him let him because
[1:48:33] by faith when you receive that that
[1:48:37] little light about the size of the
[1:48:40] button it'll start working in your life
[1:48:43] and it's him making you quit doing
[1:48:48] things well how is he making he just the
[1:48:52] more as you are letting him and yielding

[1:49:27] crowding out unbelief he's just making
[1:49:33] himself at home cuz you're inviting him
