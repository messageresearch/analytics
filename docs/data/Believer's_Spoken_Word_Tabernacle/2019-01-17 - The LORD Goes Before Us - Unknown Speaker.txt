together the saints of God of like precious faith amen I think I think the winner has finally struck us I want to make a few announcements here probably for the betterment of the weekend we really still don't know all that we're likely to get and what we will get and if we get it we certainly don't like to have to cancel anything and I just trust that we don't have to cancel service on Sunday but we just put that all before the Lord I want to make mention though we spoke with the Deacons and so forth and probably for the benefit of everything we'll go ahead and cancel the depot we do have that scheduled dole again in February right brother bill because brother bill would have to go there and get the key tomorrow and so that'll probably save some of you and having to plan on what you were going to make or whatever more and I don't like to cancel the better sometimes you know we we live and some people say we live in Ohio and you know what I heard the statement that said about Ohio if you don't like the weather stick around and it'll change after a little while but you know what I found out that's not just for Ohio when I went to Canada they said the same thing they said you know I was you know how they say about Canada this so it it's the same thing you know we we just don't know also I just wanted to make mention we had sent out a calendar with a communion service there in the first part of February but I'm gonna go ahead and cancel that the communion service and we'll reschedule that for for a later date a later date in that time I know we've had a lot of sickness and things that's been among us so for that we'll go ahead and cancel that for a later time and you just be in prayer with that and we'll let we'll let it be known ahead of time as much as we can I think that's it right now you love the Lord so let's just I just want to turn our attention now to the Word of God that's that he'll just come and speak to us tonight the personal way he certainly knows he certainly knows all of our needs doesn't he and I believe that he's the one to guide us and direct us all along this this way so let's just let's just look to him in a word of Prayer tonight and just asked it he would just lead us and guide us amen Heavenly Father Lord as we bow our hearts Lord in this moment Lord as we come together father we've lured a symbol Lord according to your word for Lord we know that Lord if there be any other assembling Lord it would be in vain Lord but father we've come Lord together by the will of God and Lord as you have spoke to our hearts and Lord here we are as your children Lord we are Oh God desiring Lord to hear from you tonight Lord father if it would just be me speaking Lord what a disappointment that would be Lord but father Lord we're looking and we're expecting you Lord that you would come father you lord who are the word Oh God the very author of life Oh God that you would come tonight Lord and you would take oh god your word and speak Lord God to our hearts Lord minister to our needs Lord in a very personal way Lord Oh God you're able Lord to move right father from the pulpit Lord God right through this building to every heart Lord and that's what our desire is law for a hearts Lord we've come Lord Oh God to be warmed in your presence Lord to be strengthened Lord and edified or God in your word Lord corrected if need be Oh God but father all things for the Lord the edification of the body Lord and Lord truly in you father we do have strength Lord and it's by you that we are built up Oh God father we just pray tonight Lord now for every need and all the requests that's been given Lord and and father I stand with the requests in my heart will God that you would help me to get out of the way tonight that you can deliver Lord what it is that you would have upon your heart father for us this evening lord I just give myself in this congregation Lord into your hands Lord that you would just come in a special way Oh God and supernaturally Lord just anointing me in this congregation Oh God and lift us Lord from this address God into heavenly places Oh Lord tonight we pray father Lord we ask it now for the glory of God in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen turn with me if you would to Deuteronomy chapter one I just want to read just a portion of the word Deuteronomy chapter 1 verse 29 is what I'd like to to go first now here is there is Moses where we have been here in this place he's rehearsing before the children of Israel remember there are those who have been there and have been witness to these this along the journey but it's also for the new generation that's coming along and how that he is expressing these words of what had taken place here at Kadish and so now once the people had had been discouraged watch in verse 29 Moses is rehearse to them what was spoken in that time by himself when he said in verse 29 then I said unto you dreadnaught neither be afraid of them the Lord your God which goeth before you he shall fight for you according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes and in the wilderness where thou has seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee has a man doth bear his son and all the way that ye went until you came into this place yet in this thing you did not believe the Lord your God who went in the way before you to search you out a place to pitch your tent tents in and in the fire by night to show you by what way you should go and in a cloud by day a man you loved him Amen may God bless you bless the reading of his word as you're being seated I want to just just take this tonight and maybe start to break into this part of just some things that will possibly hear over the services maybe somewhat overlap on Sundays and that certainly wasn't anything that was planned but just you know inspiration strikes your heart in just months ago many of these things when looking just in the Israel's journey in them coming to the crossing of the Jordan and we recognize that within this hour the ministry that God has given us is not just that of a Ministry of that of Moses but also holds within it the Joshua Commission and we know that where we are are standing and promised that to abide fully in the promises of God and to also come into that which the Church of the Living God has longed for the very change of the body so we are we are with and under expectation for that and you you find that within this here that the whole a point and whole place of the journey were Israel is is in journey with the Lord and how that Moses would make known to them in the midst of this time when there was a trouble in the camp back there in numbers where they'd come to Cadiz the spies had come back remember and he was we look here in the word Moses was encouraging them and directing their focus away from all of the reports of what those evil men the ten spies what they themselves had brought up because we know that there were two that were faithful but they were ten who brought up an evil report of the land and notice Moses here at that time he said this is what I mentioned and I spoke to you at that time and to thank all of them who were standing present who were still alive among them that had made it through that had not been there and consumed with the plagues that had not disbelieved God had not rejected him they were witnesses there were witnesses that were there of all that God had done down in Egypt and all along the way until he brought into Kadish there were people who were witnesses eyewitnesses of this and I want you just to think of this we wanted just just to take it little by little however far God will allow us to get here tonight but I want but I don't want to rush oh I believe these are our nuggets that just feeling impressed to the Spirit of God to look at that you find many times through the journey where Israel comes out of the land we we understand we hear many times of the murmuring and the complaining and how they provoked God and all of those things many times we also read as God would make mention in Deuteronomy and other places of where that there was a punishment that would come fire came out from God the Serpent's came across we we read of those times but I want to reflect and draw us as a as a people to look at the pathway of God and look at this tonight as we open into it to see how that God when he was bringing the people into the promise remember he says I'm consent you I'm come down to deliver the people to bring them out of Egypt and then into this land of promise that's that's the goal that's full reconciliation where we stand there in the promised land and we know that's a type of the Holy Spirit is that right that's a type of the believer dwelling in Christ dwelling in our promises but to see that how that God that everything that God has has given to us everything is already it is something that God has already made away as he said I've given you the land God already had given it to him but they had to have faith in order to take what God had given them you know brother Bram tells us about grace and he makes these statements in marriage of the Lamb he said God's got Amazing Grace to save you he said but you will have to take it you have to accept what God has for you there's healing for your body but he said you have to fight for it he said every promise of God you have to fight for it but here's the thing if God has already given it to you and that same God is inspiring and making it known to you then it then it is God Himself causing faith to rise in him who made the promise because after all it's not us fulfilling the promises we're just simply the vessels that are yielded to God that God would fulfill his promises through and I believe that with all my heart if we can recognize that that it's God building building our faith for the journey all of these things that were along the way was God building the faith of the people for that time of the crossing think about how brother Branham would place it there in the message a spiritual food and due season and he would he would just talk to the people at the beginning of that message and he would say now he says there's too many things that's happened here out throughout this ministry for you not to recognize God as among us then he makes a statement right after that in the next paragraph and he says but you see he said it's gonna take more faith in this hour than it ever has in any other hour he said but what we want you to do is take the things that God has done and we want you to take not only the signs and the wonders of what he's done but the word also and he said lay those things up in your heart he said I've cumulate those things in your heart allow Him to be built up he said these being built up you to be built up in the Holy Oracle's of faith and I believe that's God's desire you see if God's made a promise then God comes by when you and I are not able to help ourselves and it's God who comes by to raise our faith that the promise that he's spoken might come too fast you see how could you know he's a savior unless he would make himself known to you and deal with your heart and call upon your life and let you know that I'm a savior that I can save you that I have paid away and they made a price for you you couldn't know that unless he himself wouldn't make it known to you and when he would make it known to you and how that you would look in your life then you could raise up into that place and you could say Lord Jesus save me Lord for my sins because you believe that he is able to make that real in your life so it all comes down to that it is God Himself supplying what is needed for the hour think about it how that each one of those martyrs stood in their time brother Brent tells us like this in the church age book he said it was when Polycarp and the rest of them came to their time he said God stepped in and supplied supreme grace for what was needed for the supreme hour and I'm telling you right now when you look around it the Bible tells us even in regards to Sarah that Sarah herself the Bible says that she received strength to conceive because she judged him faithful who made the promise so it is God that you and I are drawing our strength from and that's why I say it and I believe I'm talking to believers tonight we know we need the Living God in our midst we're nothing without the presence of Almighty God you know that's the thing that separates us from all other people upon the face of the earth is the presence of the Living God you know many carry a Bible but what separates us from others is the presence of the Living God and we recognize when we look at this here tonight of how that God would build faith within the hearts of his people I want to go back and begin to look at this of how that God bringing them up to that time of Katies every experience was ordained by God it was not an experience of punishment but it was rather God chastening or disciplining his children and preparing them and he was also not only preparing them for the land because remember this Lamb that they were going into was not like the land of Egypt God let him know you're not gonna water your crops by your foot like you did in Egypt but this is a land that I care for this is a land that my eyes are upon this land God was letting them know this is not a natural land it's not an intellectual and this is a supernatural land and our dependency is upon the Living God so in order to the people and building their character and building him for coming into this place God has all of these appointments down through time that he would make known himself to them and I believe that you and I as believers I don't believe that we not only should do it have to do it but I believe it's something in our hearts that when we can look at the things that God is doing it ought to bring faith within our hearts to believe God and to know that even the testimonies like was given here last week and in other services that what God did for that one that he would make that known then God is the same God for my need and my situation it might be a little different but he's the same God and when the same conditions are met he'll perform the same way and I believe that with all my heart that how that God you would find how Moses would actually recall and rehearse the children of Israel through these appointments of God and when I look at this here I think back to Deuteronomy chapter 8 and Deuteronomy chapter 8 verse 2 once again you find how that Moses would make known to the people and say thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee beasts forty years in the wilderness to Humble thee and to prove thee to know what was in thy heart whether that would is keep his Commandments or no now to think of this to remember that you would remember you you know it's necessary to recall of how that it's been the Lord God as Moses goes on to let him know it's been the Lord God that has kept you these forty years this is exactly what was being said when they were getting ready at kadish there and those flies come back he was letting them know remember it's the Lord God that brought you out of Egypt he's letting them know that the place that you stand right now you would not be standing here if it was not for the Living God the supernatural God that has brought you all along and you know what all the people had to do was just believe God then you notice that within this when we look in these settings here the Bible goes on to tell us there in Deuteronomy a of how that you know that their raiment and all of those things Moses would let him know your raiment you know it didn't whack sold and he goes into that in verse four and then verse five he said thou shalt also consider in thine heart that as a man chase on earth his son so the LORD thy God chase enough V and you know sometimes we look at the word chastening I want to just drop this here for the thought here tonight chastening does not always mean you know the the wippen chastening is discipline and instruction brother branham over and over you find that when you look at it from the opening of the seals clear down into nineteen sixty-five you'll find where the prophet will actually make mention to us and he's he's praying here actually as he's praying lord ii said that you might reveal your will to us that we might know how to discipline our lives in the hour that we're living you see if God doesn't make known the way how can we find the way but it's up to God he's the one that's leading us and if he is calling us to Allah to to an acceptable to a be accepted then it's up to God to make away and reveal that you realize when somebody desires to be well somebody desires to be healed somebody desires to be saved somebody desires to be delivered to be filled with the Holy Ghost do you realize when you really desire that you didn't get that desire on your own you did not get that desire from the devil it was not something that was stirred up that you would just have some myth in front of you but that was originated and God dropped that within your heart and listen and just as sure as there's a desire that pulsates within that heart for that there is a living God to make that promise real and alive in your heart because God does not play with our feelings our emotions or thoughts God is faithful oh my that thou wood is considered how the Lord had chastened thee as a man chasing his son so God is instructing Israel as a father as he said in the opening Scripture as a man would bear his son you know Paul remember how Paul would reach back there in the book of Galatians I believe it's Galatians 3 and Paul would speak of how that the law was a schoolmaster and you know a schoolmaster is given till a time until faith comes in schoolmaster is there to instruct to make known you know what is right and what is wrong but once faith is come then the schoolmaster it has done its duty by bringing us to a place that the schoolmaster himself can no longer can no can no longer or cannot bring us into a place that only faith can bring us into you realize Moses could only bring him to a certain place but it the Joshua to take him over you know and God had already spoke about this in the book of Exodus he said mine angel shall go before thee and he shall bring thee into the land that thou prepares you realize even as parents as parents the most of our ministry of parents it's like that of Moses we speak of the statutes and the judgments and what is right and order and all the order and all the appropriate things all of that is necessary it's all needful but there's only one that can take our children into the land and that's Joshua that is the Lord Jesus Christ that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost that pacts them there from law into grace where it's no longer living by do's and notes but you've got the doer on the inside oh my don't you love the Lord so to think how that God's chastening of hound that he would care for Israel and you know there's lessons to be learned here it's a pathway of God's choosing you know God was was teaching them a divine instruction by experience you know how many times that for you and me both you know you had things where people will even make things known to you and they'll they'll speak things you know usually you know those sometimes it's older than us and they'll make no math ways in ways that they've walked before and that's done so that you and I might be able to benefit and grow from their learning but you realize sometimes even when things have been spoken that sometimes even afterwards that you begin to actually come into a place and you find yourself coming into something and it's not I'm not talking about sin but I'm talking about something to where you come to a place and you realize that didn't go just exactly like I thought it was gonna go or whatever and then all of a sudden the Holy Spirit will bring back to your memory here someone that it spoke to you your confidence in and you begin to remember those things and you say oh my yeah I'm not I'm not alone I'm not in this alone and you realize that oh yeah what they were saying but you see they told you they spoke to you but yet it was not something that you or I was able to learn by experience through just word but it actually had to come by experience and then once you have the experience it actually takes the word that was spoken and it brings comfort to you and that's exactly the way that God would lead Israel he didn't want to just give them a bunch of words but God wanted to manifest himself and let Israel know that when I have made the promise I've got all the bases covered for your life let me just say it like this if you look at it here just for a moment and you take this into consideration here and you look at how that you know within Israel's life you know we understand that the trials that we go through there for the perfecting of us is that right those trials are for the perfecting of us and all the way that God was leading them that was his way it was God's Way he was directing them all the way through the pathway and when you look at everything in here I tell you I I just this this point just seems to resonate in my heart if you watch how that God lays everything out in the Book of Numbers in the book of Deuteronomy here in the book of Exodus God wanted the people's focus on one thing and that's him who made the promise and the promise God said you don't have to be focused on all the necessities of life sure they come up before us but I want you to remember that I made the promise and Allah brought you out if I called you out that I will sustain you I will provide for everything that you have need of they meant God's letting them know you see he's not just gonna tell them that that God said I want to prove this to you so when we think of this of how that God would would make himself known to Israel brother bran would say it like this here just let me refer to it he talks about how he said God would bring Israel out he would try them as a nation he plucked him up up them up from Egypt among all those unbelievers and brought them under his tender care on the wings of an eagle the great Eagle Moses that led them from place to place trying to get them in condition to cross over notice trying to get them in condition to cross over now you watch here has we you know we just look at this here just a few moments here tonight you find the places that God is taking them as soon as they leave out of Egypt they're going to come to a place of the Red Sea then from the Red Sea that come tomorrow then they come to them then they move into Sinai and each one of these places are divine appointments that God is making himself known to Israel that I am all that you have need of I'm not just gonna say it to you but I'm gonna prove it to you glory be to God don't you love when God comes and proves his word hello it stirs our hearts as believers you know it's something has just stairs my heart you know when testimonies will drop and I think you know just of even the service that we had here last week and I made mention to you you know and I left out of here I thought boy this is gonna be a hard night to go to sleep because you're just so stirred up of what God is doing among his people friends this this is my joy this is my delight I believe it's your delight as well to witness the Living God there's nothing else that I get pleasure and satisfaction out of there's nothing that means more to me than to pray till I'm in his presence and then also to hear his word and to also then witnesses workings among his people I tell you it encourages us and I believe it's I believe that it is God's Way how many times you find brother Branham when he's in the midst here of you know in the ministry he dropped right back into a testimony and it through a testimony there he would build faith for the oncoming battle in that just exactly what David did David when it came to a situation with Goliath hold all of those that were up there saw in the rest of them that weren't so much standing behind believing David himself had to reach into his own personal scrip bag of experiences and he began to declare that the Living God was the same one who delivered him from the line and from the bear and he's the same God that will deliver this uncircumcised philistine in my hand do you realize that David identified something that the rest of those Israelites should have known it should have been that very thing that they would have caught their attention no matter how big that giant was he's uncircumcised it is not part of the Covenant but they were looking at his size but David could say he's uncircumcised he don't have no protection what does that say about you and I who have been born of the Spirit of God and plays in the Covenant of Jesus Christ by the circumcision not made with hands we've got a great big God we've got a great covenant oh my it's all powerful of a Living God hallelujah oh my oh my how I feel like preaching but I don't want to make it so evangelistic huh I want to drop this here for us tonight that we would lean from this tonight you find here in that sit is 13 maybe some of these places you can just follow me here in the scripture in Exodus 13 verse 17 the Bible says it came to pass when Pharaoh had let the people go that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines although that was near that was closer but God's got a reason for God said unless peradventure the people repent when they see war and they return to Egypt God was mindful he had bared them he was bearing them has a man dove care for his son he knows what they're able to stand he knows what they're able to endure at that point aren't you glad he will never put more up on us than we are able to bear and whatever he allows to come our way you know what I'm talking about 1st Corinthians 10:13 whatever he permits remember it is that which is common to man and with that he will make an escape that we might be able to bear it God is faithful now think of this here but God led the people about through the way of the wilderness of the Red Sea and the children of Israel in a harness out of the land of Egypt means they were they were going up but you know a breast like like an army and Moses took the bones of Joseph with him for he had straightly sworn the children of Israel saying God will surely visit you and you shall carry up my bones away hence from you and they took their journey from Saku and in Campton 'litham and in the edge of the wilderness and the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud to lead them in the way and the night in a pillar fire to give them life to go by day and night he took not away the pillar of the cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night from before the people I want you to notice something very very peculiar here you know when you look in the scriptures it speaks here of how that the Lord went before them in a pillar of cloud the Bible says he led them in the way if says he the pillar fire gave them light to go by day and night and he took not the pillar crying away from the people you know brother Branham makes a statement and he talks to us every time how many times you hear what brother Branham would identify he says he came and he had his picture taken with us and brother Graham will say it over and over he said look he said that pillar fire was not just with Moses it was with the people he said look he said that pillar fire did not come he said because of me he said he came because of his word he said he's identified himself with me he said because I'm standing on his world and he said if we stand together on the word he's identified with us it's that same angel the Lord that same angel of the Covenant let me tell you something although here you know the seventh angel the earthly messenger although he's gone but the one who stood right there and delivered that message and who gave it that same one is here with you and I and it's the same one that's in our meds that's making this word to come to pass and it's the same one that's left here that'll pack us from these mortal bodies into the immortal it's the same age of the Lord that's God's promise behold I sent mine angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring me into the place that I have prepared for thee and in my father's house are many mansions Amen that same angel the Lord is leading the Church of the Living God tonight step by step of the way faith being built look at this here you know brother Branham made this statement here and let me just read this here he says if I was going to New York City the best thing for me to do is not to try to find geographically how I'm situated and take off north but the best way to do is to get a map and follow the map a highway if I don't I get in trouble is that all right I'm air we'd go on trips and you know that was back in the days when getting ready go on a trip dad would get out there and McNally atlas he would lay it on the table and he would plan and we were plan out stops along the way you had to know what exit was and stuff like that and I know some of the young people looking at me and saying what is that but it was a map and it had a layout you know of the roads and the highways and you could kind of plan your way through there and you know here but the random is letting him know he says you would get a map and you would follow the map and if I don't I get in trouble he says there's no shortcuts in God's kingdom you know we try to make a shortcut we get out here and upon somewhere and mire down and that's what we do when we get off the grand old highway of God God made a pathway so now let me come down to you youngers O'Malley got phones and we got GPS but I think there's enough witnesses here tonight including myself how many times where it's told me you have arrived and I'm in the middle of a neighborhood and that neighborhood I don't know if I can I'll probably get pulled over this I'm gonna do to get out of there there been times I remember my dad was in the hospital had he had a knee operated on and you know I got a GPS in the first place one of them garments is because you know I couldn't remember where all the hospitals were at when I'd have to come visit you all and I couldn't remember do I get on turnpike for this one do I take 90 for this one where do I get off so that's the reason our guy got one in the first place and so here I am you know I'm driving along and about that time you know I'm supposed to be going to Lakewood Hospital and about the time I get off and you know I'm just following it because I don't know where liquid hospitals that never been there in my life about that time I'm all down the other way and I'm in a neighborhood and it says you've arrived I looked around I said there is nothing around here I don't even see a building that looks like a hospital I said Lord Jesus help me Lord help me I'm lost so I called my mom I said hey I said I need help I said I don't know where I'm at you know so they referred me to the front desk and and I called the front desk I'll let her know it said here I'm over here by this you know I said what I see across the street is a Burger King but I just passed it here I'm moving on down the street cuz I'm not gonna stay here I stopped on this corner I'm coming down this way and here's what I see over here here's what I see and you know that lady was able to guide me in my point that I'm making is that you can have all of all the all the equipment and all those things but you see what a map and those things what a GPS another thing should help you do it should be able to help you to get from one place to the other but you know if you know as well as I do it would be a quick trip if we could drive across the lake and go into Ontario but we can't do that we've got to go all the way around this way or we've got to come all the way up that way there's certain ways in certain places you know how it is as you know has little fellas sometimes you're in the car and we're gonna take a shortcut and the shortcut ain't a shortcut it's a long cut it ends up being a long way around and sometimes it's places that you wish you never been and this is what brother branham is letting us know here in a very simple way that God's player pathway is not a shortcut but it is his way and all along the way there are sites that he wants us to see there are things that he wants to make known to you and I hold my so then you know brother Ren tells the seagulls into here of how God's a leadership he said you know he said some through the waters some through the flood some through deep trials but all through the blood he said that's the way God leads his children God's path God's provided way if the children of Israel would have tried to bypass and go around down this way they'd have got in trouble they had to follow the cloud of fire and the pillar fire that led them they followed that and if the church tonight I love this statement will only follow the pillar fire only follow the pillar fire the Holy Spirit you'll make Canaan as sure as anything if you only follow the Holy Spirit the pillar fire you make Canaan as sure as anything God has a way of provided way he said now there's two ways a man can go and that's his way or God's Way and that's the right way or the wrong way and your way is always the wrong way and God's Way is the right way and you can't be in your own way and in God's Way at the same time so you got to get out of your own way so God can have his way in you I want to look here in the scripture go with me to Exodus chapter 13 here Exodus 13 here the Bible we just finished reading where the pillar fire was right there with them leading them in verse 1 of Exodus 14 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying speak unto the children of Israel that they turn and in camp before peer oath between mcdowell on the sea over against Bowser phone before before it shall you in camp by the sea for Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel they are entangled in the land the wilderness hath shut in and I will harden Pharaoh's heart but he will follow after them and I will be honored upon Pharaoh and upon all his hosts that the Egyptians may know that I am the Lord and they did so now here is God leading them his pathway now the children of Israel remember here they are they're out from under bondage they've been in bondage they've had to give heed to these task masters as well as to Egypt it was a ruling authority over their lives but how did God by way of the sacrifice think of all the plagues that God did when they were down there in Egypt and all those plagues there what was it doing it was executing judgment upon the gods of Egypt but then how that it came into that final moment to where there would be a difference that the Lord would make between Israel between Israel and all of that of Egypt and the difference that the Lord would make would be by the blood and we know that how that he told them he said you to take a lamb and you to slay the lamb you to put the lambs blood upon the door so there had to be a sacrifice a sacrifice of blood in order for them to walk out you see this is part of redemption redemption requires a purchase and it's only a purchase by blood it cannot be purchased with that of with that of silver with that of gold but it is a purchase of blood because it speaks that there had to be a life that would be an innocent life that would be able to stand in our place and take our judgment that you and I could be able to go free so here they are they're walking out under the sacrifice of the blood of the Lamb when they've come out of Egypt and then they come into this time and here God has orchestrating and engineering every bit of this - we're here they would be in a place that he has led them to that Pharaoh himself would rise up in that time God would harden his heart when they would tell Pharaoh concerning Israel and Pharaoh would start out after him to over take Israel not to think this God has all of this in his plan but remember now he has not told his plan to Moses this part of it he only said I'm going to take him into the land but you see he didn't have to tell everything to Moses what Moses knew was that he had met the Lord God and what God had said he was doing I've come down to deliver him behold I'm sending you Moses had faith in the Living God of what God had told him to do that God was standing by and that's the same way it is with us we don't need to know every step of the way but it is faith enough to know and rest that we are in the very hand of Almighty God we have met the Living God and he himself has brought us forth so whatever the future holds is to know he holds the future this is what brother Branham was so labor in the messages of Shalom there in the beginning of 64 and he would over and over deal with the future and he said all why don't you just commit your future to the Lord he said you know he said we don't know what the future holds he said death might take you he said but don't look at that he said look to him he said who knows you might get killed in an accident but don't look at that look to him oh my brother Ram says if you're in a situation you say brother branham I just seem like I can't look ahead he said don't try to look ahead look up to him I don't want you to looking ahead look to him Amen we look to him this salvation we were drawn to him and salvation looking to me all your hands of the earth we need to keep looking unto Him who's the author and finisher of our faith because the Bible says that he will appear the second time to those who look for him he will appear the second time without sin unto salvation so we're looking for him now notice this when we look at this part of the journey here how that Israel comes into this time and the Bible tells us here if I can just refer to a few places here of now but you know at this time when favor will begin to draw near in verse 10 that when he drew near the Bible says that the people were afraid and the children of Israel cried out unto the Lord and they said to Moses was it because there was no graves in Egypt have stopped taken us a way to die wherefore hast thou dealt with us to carry us forth out of Egypt is it not this word that we told the in Egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians for it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians than we should die in the wilderness notice here they'd wasn't aware that this was going to come up but you see what happens when they begin to hear about Pharaoh the hearing they see the things coming they themselves are troubled but you know where God is going to take this as a proving grounds now how many times after this we hear the statement of why you brought us out here to die you brought us out here to die and other times later on God brings judgment on earth but this time right here you know this is an opportunity because God is chastening his people he's going to prove here's faithfulness to them Omaha don't you love him now notice here you know Moses he instructs the people to stand still and you shall see the salvation of the Lord I want you to watch this verse of scripture here he said you shall stand still and see the salvation of the Lord in verse 13 which he will show you to you today for the Egyptians whom you have seen today you shall see them no more forever the Lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace Oh glory you see you can't go anywhere with the past come on somebody you can't go anywhere with the past God knows that so God he makes a way he's gonna deal with that past he's gonna deal with those things that were ruling over them when were down in Egypt you see he had called them out by the word and they had come out but you see when they came out then the very taskmasters and those that had ruled over now are stirred up to come out against them the the very ones that had made him go and pick up straw and make brick and all those other things the very ones that had ruled over him were now in pursuit after them but you see it's exactly what God wanted God wanted this at this time he's called him out by faith and by faith they applied the blood and walk out is that right there's been a purchase that was made a purchase was made now God he's going to manifest to them his power will glory he's gonna manifest power to Israel as well as their to the Egyptians now remember here the Bible says that how that God in verse 19 that the angel of God which went before the camp of Israel removed and went behind them and the pillar of cloud went from before their face and stood behind them so here what was pursuing them and what was coming after them they were following in God's pathway and now the angel of God here here he is in that pillar fire that pillar of cloud he removes from going before them and he comes between them and the enemy now I want you to stay with me here brother Branham brings this very thing that's very very place here in the scripture and he'll tap it in many different ways he'll tap it here within that of sanctification he'll type it in the in Redemption joint completeness he'll type it that here was physical death was coming after the people of God to kill him and you know if we just look at that one just for a moment he deals with how he says maybe here you are walking in your journeying with the Lord and sickness has come after you maybe he said it's a cancer it's something that the doctor himself has gives you no hope to recover as far as that you'll be overtaken by he said now it's up to you he said the angel of God is standing between that demon of sickness and between you he said it's that same angel of the Lord that stood between me he said when I was all shot up he said and I could have died that way he said but has I was standing there he said I decided to take his way that he was leaving and I'll tell you right now his way is the way of life the angel of God standing right there between your sickness in your body you realize that Satan cannot even touch your body and cannot even afflict you I unless he first gets permission from Almighty God but to think how the angel of God would stand right there in between the sickness and in between the people and to think of how that the people of God walking there through the Red Sea upon the dry ground when they got to the other side and they climb upon the banks remember what takes place is that a Pharaoh's army is subdued and overcome and overthrown and drowned by the water you say what are you saying tonight I'm telling you that same angel of God is here to lead you from sickness to health and apply that promise to know that it's the angel of God standing between you I'll tell you what when I look at that and I think of it of how that God in His mercy would stand right there that all that Israel think about this all the Israel had to do was stand still and see the salvation of God they stood still now watch they stood still yet they had to walk when the way was open now here is Moses now after Moses has just told them the Lord is going to fight for you today you can hold your peace God is going to fight for you know what God wants them to witness his power this is not an accident it was not an oops you remember sometimes as you look at that of Cecil Beaton Cecil B DeMille that did Commandments and you think of how that favor Rama C says right there he said their God must be a poor General to lead him into a place like this where they can't get out but this was not a mistake this was the pathway of God's Lee God was going to get him honor upon Pharaoh and on their past masters these people that had once ruled their life and made their life a rigor bondage but God was luring them to a place that Pharaoh's army would never be able to make it through that Red Sea let me tell you something there's not a demon out of hell that can make it through the blood of Jesus Christ there's not one devil that can make it through the blood of Jesus Christ there's not one old habit that can make it through that blood cleanses it's all powerful better to set free he alert him to this place this was a setup Israel didn't know what was going on Pharaoh didn't know what was going on but God knew what he was doing you think about this journey he opened it up he has told Moses stretched forth your hand with the Rob that's in your hand and speak he stretched his hand over the water and the Bible says that the waters became for Israel a wall in that funny the very thing that overthrown the Egyptians was the very thing that was a wall for them in it funny the very same word that is walls for you and I it's protection its fortification it's judgment for the rest of the world I want you to think about this for a moment you know that little pill that heart patients can take it's called little natural or the little nitro pills you know and I wrote those things you realize they get enough and they get that arranged and get it in a bigger quantity they can blow up buildings nitroglycerin you understand that rock very something like that that you look at it it's all powerful the very same thing that you can take in your body and will help your bloodstream if you need help for it to thin out is the very same thing in other qualities that can blow things up let me tell you something safe that is taken into our heart it might be the size of a grain of a mustard seed but you hold on to that you nurse that you feast on God's Word you border that with and worship and you watch that very same thing it'll bring down strongholds it'll bring you into the presence of God to the promises that you're desiring in your life a man that is a living God at work in our lives think of this think of the living dog going here before the people of Israel right now stand still there in fear he just said stand still you're going to see the salvation of the Lord these that's been bothering you we'll never see him no more I want you to think of this right here him Moses was able to stand there and prophesy under the Spirit of God and said you'll never see him no more they won't be able to out swim it they won't be able to overcome it there is nothing that will make it through but how that God opened up a way for Israel what was he letting Israel know that I am your way I am the way that's been provided for you I am your way maker I am the one who opens the way that you can walk across there here they come in here they are walking you know and I want you to understand this they're on dry ground the Bible just didn't include that just to be including it they were on dry ground when they walked their feet were on solid ground God took the same ground that could overthrow the chariot wheels and it was made solid ground for that of Israel glory be to God in its remembers how that God will take the promises of his word and to us as believers it's not just word but it's solid ground it's places that we can stand upon and stand in the Lord oh ma here is Israel they come across and as they come across and they get across there now remember that Pharaoh and his army they're in pursuit they've been brought out of Egypt and all of that that has fallen those taskmasters but as they get to the other side and they get up on the other side I want you to remember here that Moses himself was directed by God now I want you to turn your hand and I want you to stretch it forth over top of that sea and the Bible says the sea came back together let me tell you something that hand what others looked at and it was Moses hand but let me tell you something when God stretches down his hand you find it in the scriptures where it speaks of the hand of the Lord it's showing God in personification of how that God would make himself known and real to you and I that by my right hand I have delivered you I have stretched down my hand who have believed the report of the Lord the arm of the Lord been revealed had been extended down and here they are in the midst of that and Moses holds the hand now watch they're not saying there's nothing all they've done he's had to walk in obedience you know what God was teaching them here you walk in obedience to my word and I will take care of your enemies anything that would try to beset you if you walk in my word I will take care of it this is God's promise this was not just a show this was a disciplinary lesson that they would know that I'm the Lord who brought you out I will take care of you and you can't go anywhere with the past so I've got to remove your past a purchase has been made and now here comes is there that are the Egyptians coming right through there oh my glory be to God and now the waters begin to cover it up on the Egyptians the Bible let's had known hid overthrew their chariots you know what the chariots was it was there our the water over through the power of failure roll it over through as a matter of fact in over through all of that of pay rose army the horsemen the horse it over through all of those powers I want you to think with me now you realize that when you look at a beast and the scripture here and you come over into revelations you realize it's a type of a power is that right so here was a power here that was coming after them a power that was sent to pursue after them these are people of a promise marching in the promise led by the pillar file and Satan is in pursuit after them let me tell you something when they come into this place and the waters closing up it is there that every elf a rose army is overthrown I want to read this here in Exodus 15 can we read it here Oh glory be to God Exodus 15 1 mama I'm coming down been saying Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord and spake singing I will sing unto the Lord for he had triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea oh there's a new song that was wrote there it fitted the inspiration of the hour you with me the Lord is my strength and soul and he has become my salvation he is my God and will prepare him and habitation my father's called and I will exalt him the Lord is a man of war the Lord is his name Pharaoh's chariots and his hosts have he cast into the sea his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red Sea and it goes on to to speak of how that God moving there among them notice here in verse 11 who is lacking to the O Lord among the gods who is Lac unto thee glorious in holiness fearful in praises doing wonders you're talking about a song you see what they were singing about was because what had been about them and after them had been consumed Omaha and they come brother branham here he places it so clearly we know that the blood he holds a sanctifying power it's not just enough that there was a sacrifice but there's a power that's been released from the blood of that sacrifice there's a power in that blood there's power to clean up a lot power to change your life as they stood there on that seashore brother and sis here was Moses he said you know maybe a little reserved person he said but that time Moses got beside himself and Miriam got beside herself because he said they can look back and they could see all of them old habits of the world was done away with come on somebody you see it was something that was real to them nobody had to tell them it was a witness to them are you with me it's a witness inside of your life that that of the past and and that of loose things that used to bond and used to bother you brother Brent said their one one old dirty habit came up out of that sea it was all drown the whole glory be to God you understand we're talking about habits it was drowned there the see the blood of Jesus Christ it packs within it sanctifying power why he's preparing them for the journey they still Don across Jordan but in here this time right here there's a Jubilee come on somebody there's a Jubilee now watch this all they had to do well huh where do you closed all they had to do was come by the washing of water by the word I want you to listen to me now real close if you ain't focused on nothing Nelson this service focus on this there's not one of them of the Israelites could destroy one of those taskmasters there's not one of them I don't care how much they tried I don't care if they would have said I'll do it on my own I'll be able to they couldn't do it God never says with your help he said stand still and see the salvation of the Lord I'll tell you what you need deliverance in your life stand still and see the salvation of God and stand still it means you walk in his word under his obedience let me tell you something listen to me now if you would have stood on this seashore right here and you would have said well I'm seeing the salvation of the Lord then Egyptians would have overtaken you but in order to stand still and see his salvation you've got to walk step by step in the word that's been open for you and when you walk in that way it's a way that's been made for overcoming in your life you with me now this is God's Way let's just close here [Music] glorious and holiness how many no he's holy raised him from the dead the Bible says in Romans one with the spirit of holiness glory it brings about a holy life a holy walk the blood cleanses you see listen friends sometimes in lives you know a person can say I don't know why and got no further here and I don't know I know I hear and I don't know this here I don't understand that don't try to figure that out just walk in the word your ain't never gonna get delivered by standing on the seashore over there you gotta walk in the way that the word has been open for you and if you walk in that word that word will bring you to the other side to where His grace is reflected sublimely and perfectly in your life you stand on the other side there as a victory sanctified cleansed and I'll tell you this right here one thing I find with the Holy Spirit he don't just leave stations and appointments here in the word for the past to where we just look at it and say been there done that but I love how the Holy Spirit brings it fresh the Prophet will work it around and he said you know what he said what took place there on the bank of that Red Sea was a good old-fashioned revival and he said you know what a good old-fashioned revival is the results of its a good wind that's blowing up on the water and we need a good wind he said to blow upon this water you know what it does it washes all the trash out if there's been in snare mats if there's been traps because the enemy can have all kinds of traps around remember traps are not habits traps and types of ensnare mats but to think of how the grace of God is able to move within our life to where that we can stand and sing the song of victory aren't you glad I'm thankful to God for his word you just remembered tonight whatever it is and whatever it would be before you or whatever is trying to pursue you it might be sickness that's trying to take your life maybe wanting to take your joy and to somehow paint your life has a life of despair and that you have no hope or this of you just remember right here tonight the Holy Spirit I'll tell you this right here tonight if you seen what I walked up here with right here tonight I walked up here as I do any other time by faith but I had with me just a few little stones in my hand when I walked up here tonight and what I thought that I was gonna be preaching tonight you asked my wife when I got home I said I feel like I'm going to school and I don't own a pencil in my life but tell me what you do I just skate I just I just said Lord you know what you've dealt with my heart on and hearing all of a sudden what I've studied and given myself but you know what I come to realize that it was God also further teaching me and he's also ministering to our needs he knows what we have needeth I'm glad aren't you I'm glad I thank God for that he knows exactly how to speak and minister to our lives I'll tell you what I would do tonight as I would any other time I would take that and say Lord you spoke directly to my heart tonight whatever the need is in your life if it's sickness if it's deliverance if it's the Holy Ghost know this tonight that God is for you and if God be for us who can be against us if God's called you in salvation you've repented you've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ then keep on walking with it let him sanctify you let him cleans up your life let him take all of the habits out of your life you said you got this habit I still do this and I still do this hey wait a minute here when you look at all that why don't you look to the one who can cleanse you and you say what do I do well for goodness sakes don't stand on the banks where the Egyptians are at keep walking through the watery walkthrough the way that he's open now he's not leading you on mushy ground this is not mushy ground this is solid dry ground and remember he was calling you he's got your back I said he's got your back and he's leading you forwards so he's got your back and he's leading you forward that looks like you're in between him you got him behind you you got him before you and he's pulling your heart he's moving you
