say day i'll say one of these moments amen those true riches that is posited by his life and brother joy one of these moments we will be changed mitchell how fast that change will come the same way that change comes by the new birth in a moment in a twinkling of an eye when you look at that in the scripture it's a moment it's that which is unable to be divided you know there's a lot of things you can divide right you keep on getting things smaller until we physically cannot divide it but then you can go to a certain machine and they can divide it like they divide atoms divide molecules but to understand that there's a moment of what god has done in your life that moment can't be divided and when this right here this body is changed it'll be a moment just like that moment it cannot be divided glory be to god you can't divide christ you can't divide him oh my don't you love him this morning amen we'll just let you have your seats for a moment it's just so wonderful to be in his presence and i know that uh coming up here possibly that we different ones you'll be starting in school how many of the kids and going to be starting school tomorrow okay all right different ones and some of you um little aaron you start in school tomorrow you lucky guy well we want to go ahead and i want to have prayer we're just going to let you sit where you're at but i want to speak not only to you but also to speak to the parents there's different things that i could you know read to you and refer to you from the scriptures and from the message but i want you to understand we're we we have things all around us that we've we know uh god has dealt with um we understand just like when the prayer requests have been mentioned here different ones in the assembly here even how god uh has has completely brought them through that of of the covid we know that uh we're not exempt or immune from sickness but we're also instructed by god not to fear it now let me just say it like this i know heart disease i know diabetes i know blood pressure i know all that stuff it's run in my family from way on back now to not fear it does not mean that i go hog wild and just eat whatever i want to eat well i've already lost you already right now you understand there's certain weaknesses that's in my body now i realize i realize that i can't you know make myself you know i where i'm going to live beyond a certain time or what that's all in god's hands but this is my desire while i'm here i want to give my very best to him i want to give my very best there's certain things that i know if i'm going to preach there's certain things i won't even eat the day before i won't even touch certain things i don't want anything to hinder that now that may seem kind of extreme to you or whatever but i don't like to be hindered even when i'm ministering but these are things that when we look at this with even the virus and that which is around us i know there's a lot of reports we've talked about that and it's just like this i've mentioned this to you before i'm not ignorant of it neither are you and i don't think anybody's ignorant of what's going on that's right come november things will start to lay down does it mean the virus is going to go away no are you with me there's a lot of things that's being hyped a lot of things that's being said a lot of fear a lot of things what's the best thing that can be done tune that out and look to jesus and i say it very clearly god didn't mean for you to live in a cave the rest of your life promise after promise is laying right here in the word a there's a there's a there's a quote i wish i could just read it here but the spirit of god comes down and deals with a man 1964 on the platform he had been poisoned with carbon monoxide poisoning he had developed a complex a fear about going back into work listen to me now the spirit of god picks that up and says sir you're poor and you've got to go back to work but he said jesus christ set you free go and be of a good cheer i'm telling you the authority of the word we're under doesn't mean we're immune from it doesn't cause us to act careless or reckless or arrogant but we are walking this is a time to live upon this word live in this word it's a time to take god at his word and the bible says lord i'm with you always. amen now i'm not talking about god didn't tell me to go walk into a coveted ward and go pray for everybody that ain't what i'm talking about but if god did tell me just like he's told the brothers who walk into the leprosy colonies then we obey god and know that god's our protection when you have to go back to work or you have to go back to school or whatever don't fret commit your ways unto the lord listen somebody sent me a little uh um a little um we call them means i think that's what you call them and it showed you know people walking in walmart with their masks but but but they said oh my goodness i better not go to church because if i go to church the devil might get me now i know that may if those of you streaming and you don't don't don't take that wrong but i just want you to understand as you go back into school and you go back into different places god told joshua don't you fear god said don't you fear there's a place of safety that's in goshen and with many different ones that you know just like i believe you know individuals trying their best to try like like we all are trying to do what we can even as an assembly and as a church to do uh the best within the situation we're not ignorant of satan's devices but we're looking to god and i i that that the scripture in the book of zechariah is what has so stood out to me where god told israel in that time of with their time of visitation that's coming he said i'll be a wall of fire around you remember it won't be the walls of jerusalem in that hour that will be a protection of 144 000 because even the orthodox jews will rise up against that 144 000. there will be a small remnant 144 000 but god says my word will be a wall of fire around about you amen so we're we're not arrogant we're not ignorant of it but the thing is that we want to do because with many of our you know different ones you know of different brothers and pastors and whatever more and you know sometimes you get into that and people say well this should have been done and that should have been done and this should have been done and nobody knows what in the world was being done or wasn't what being done but i i'll say to you right now that there's one thing about it this we will see the media is really an instrument of trying to control the people it's propaganda they want to throw things in and cite things and stir things up and this and that and you got this man standing this way and this man standing this way and um i just i say that to you because as as parents when we go back into our schools like uh like even you know for um you know our children and things like that the boys i know they're my our oldest two are not able to go back out there to the uh college the classes they tried to sign up for classes that would be on campus and then get these that are online and uh but uh you know zachary he's got some class that he'll be going to that will even be outside of the home so i know different ones that that are going back and i just i pray that god this morning will comfort you because his parents and his children there are it's going to be a different environment you've got a you know wear mask and everything else and and you know the things that you've got to comply with and i pray for those of you that's that's teachers brother danny do you have to go back brother and i you already did and i pray for those of you that's teachers because i you know every time they add something to the agenda that you got to do i mean you can just imagine trying to keep masks on little guys and let alone having big guys who are clowns with a mask you know you can just imagine that so um we we want to just keep everything in prayer and you just remember that when you walk into that classroom he said i am with you he said i'll never forsake you amen he he specifically as he told the prophet in this hour it was not listen to me that promise that he made real to him of matthew 28 don't you fear to go anywhere no i am with thee always that is a promise that is given to the believer who is walking in the word [Applause] amen god is our provider god has been seeing us through god will see us through god has brought us through and you know you look at it like you know our precious brother herb hey let me tell you something coveted didn't take him it was only an instrument in the hand of god do you realize brother branham he stands up and he preaches in the message all things he said even death is given to the believer why you and i need an escape out of this life god that's god's grace he made an escape out of here our brother he's uh he is standing in life he's not battling anymore long i know sister rita you miss him dearly and i pray for you he's such a do we all miss him but let me tell you something he's standing in life he's been running down them fields of bluegrass [Applause] with his sweetheart sister job amen and you know what he's waiting he's waiting i don't say those things lightly i say that because we recognize that when we look at all this and these things that are around us we recognize that that that even death itself to a believer it is no longer our slave or our master it is there to pull us into the presence of god now so i mean when you go to the store do you wear masks you got to wear masks now i mean i don't try to you know i just you want we're wearing masks wear a mask we were down visiting a little bit of a place here the first part of this week and just taking a few days and they very clearly just you know they let it be known well this is the governor's orders and this and that but we don't we don't enforce them real heavily here you know it's in a little remoter place in this state you know um but um and we're not making light of that and i and i let me just say this why i'm on it i might as well go ahead and say well i'm not preaching but i might as well say it while i'm on it facebook and there's other things where you want to take positions or we should have mass or we shouldn't have mass get off that nonsense why are you talking about nonsense don't get caught up in arguments like that that is nothing but fleshly and vexation show your colors as a believer and don't get caught up in that foolishness we understand if you go somewhere to wear a mask wear a mask but don't get caught up in well i'm going to take sides over here and i'm going to take sides of there let me just tell you you need to take sides with jesus if there's one thing that's going to stand out about your life it's not well i'm an advocate of master i'm an advocate of this let it be that you stand out i'm an advocate of jesus christ those are traps to draw you in resist that if you can't say well you know i got to put in my two cents when you keep doing that you're going to be broke stop doing it i mean give your energy and your zeal to god mean it just well but we might want to sing again no we'll just we'll stand and we'll go into the word but and i want to just have prayer here before we as we're reading the word and i want to have prayer for you as parents and as as children and as you're going back and because perhaps i think most of you have already went back into work and you've got different things that you have to do and you were around and work you know um but i'm grateful for the peace of god aren't you i i'm very i'm very grateful i pray he forgive me if i don't if i've not been grateful enough but i'm very grateful for his peace i'm grateful for his leadership how he has guided us and i want to i want him to continue to guide us we're trusting in him we just love him [Music] oh hallelujah heavenly father lord i i'm not very good at these things lord i [Music] many times lord my words they fail me i get nervous but i pray that god i know lord is your children this burden lord has been on my heart since all this even began lord over five months ago i thought lord there's got to be a resuming and may you give us the strength may you give us the courage give us wisdom lord god there's testimonies that even right here in this assembly [Music] where people that you caused a sickness in their home and they were homesick not they but they were caring for for that which is sick in their house if they had been there in that department at that moment they would have had to quarantine without pay but you seemed to it oh it was an inconvenience to them but you seem to it that they weren't there during that time so lord they were the only one out of that whole floor that was able to go back to work now lord those things right there when i i see it i know from their heart lord they're so thankful they see your hand of mercy [Music] but i believe that's a witness i believe that's lord of witness to each of our hearts and our lives that god you're watching out for us and we ask that you would help us to be sensitive not anxious not nervous but to be sensitive [Music] this is lord the simplicity that's given to us as believers to follow the leading of the holy spirit the lord is daddies and mamas and i know grandparents have the lord the same burden with their grandchildren lord there's children going back there's teenagers young men young women lord some of them there's things that's going to be different where they've got to do online they can't have that lord contact personally with their teachers i pray god that you would help them god i i want to say i pray that you would help them to get what they need to get and may there be such a filter on their life that would filter out all the junk because lord we realize that even in many of these institutions that are out there i knew it when i was there many of them lord they've got their own agendas we see it we see those agendas coming out in the streets and everything else now but god i'm so thankful we've got our eyes are set on another city a city whose builder and maker is god we've been born of the life of that city the father i asked that you'd give them wisdom and understanding when daniel and the rest of them were down in babylon lord it's wrote of them daniel well we know he was a servant of god but daniel he had great understanding in the sciences he had great understanding that your word tells us that but he didn't rest upon that may the lord god each and every one of the of the children the teenagers and so forth lord going to school may they look to you and say lord help me on this test help me to understand this lord there'll be teachers there in the school that god so much pressure has put upon them i feel for them not that we shouldn't be careful but god i ask lord that your protection and your comfort that god when the children would go into those classes and different things god i pray that you would just watch over them god we're looking and we're asking lord knowing that this virus it's a demon god just desiring to lord as it's moving throughout the world we just god we're looking to you lord to bring an end to that virus lord [Music] father i pray you would just give wisdom and direction for those that are at work and starting back into work be with each and every one i pray [Music] oh god may our hearts be tuned out of every other voice may it be tuned in to your voice lord we thank you for how that you've you've protected us as an assembly [Music] lord you know there's been many things i appreciate god how your people lord they've if they've come in contact with something lord they've they've they've really approached it in the right way this is un lord it's inconveniences for our natural man but i ask you to forgive us lord for our complaining because this is a real testing even of our own character right now and how that god that we would respond to it lord god if there be any that's in traps even some of those traps that i spoke of may they recognize lord forgive me i've got my spirit my mind all tangled up in these things i don't want to be tangled up in that i want to be free granted lord [Music] now father as we open the word this morning lord we can open the bible we can read it but it's going to take more than that we need you the lord the gift that you placed in my life it's not for me it's for you to use lord for your people [Music] i ask lord if there's anything lord that would hinder forgive me purge lord let the word of god have free course here this morning may you be lifted up lord in all things i pray in the name of jesus christ amen you love him you still love me well if you don't i'll pray for you jeremiah chapter 38 and i'm going to read a few verses of scripture here jeremiah 38 and verse 14. now this this portion of scripture that i'm going to we're going to read i so lord just really pressing on my heart from um as we've been reading here and and looking at this with impending judgment that was coming upon israel and we read in the earlier parts last week on ibedemalek the ethiopian and how that he heard that jeremiah had been cast into the dungeon and he lowered down with such care old rags old cloths that he could put up on the cords and be raised up there was a ebenmelec recognized jeremiah was and he recognized the word of god who he recognized he recognized god was represented in their midst and so now we come after that has been done he's been raised he's been raised up by the bed melech the king's servant now here we come to zedekiah the king which was indeed the king at this time and i want you to notice here how the king's approach this is not the first time jeremiah or hell had audience with him this is the second time but then zedekiah the king sent and took jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the lord and the king said unto jeremiah i will ask thee a thing hide nothing from me then jeremiah said unto zedekiah if i declare it unto thee wilt thou not surely put me to death and if i give thee counsel will thou not hearken unto me yes that jeremiah is asking verse 16 so zedekiah the king swears secretly unto jeremiah saying as the lord liveth that made us this soul recognizing god's the creator i will not put thee to death neither will i give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life now how many questions did he answer one he didn't answer the second question will you hearken unto me the answered one but not the second one may god bless you bless the reading of the words you're being seated i want to speak on that thought here this morning the voice of god is the mercy of god the voice of god is the mercy of god they were standing in a great place of reverence you recognize many times how that um things can be orchestrated as backgrounds that the backgrounds will actually try to say something or try to sway people in a certain way here zedekiah has has asked for audience with jeremiah now remember he's also been the one already who after they had already had a a council before right after zedekiah became put in as king that he wouldn't hearken then to zedek to zedekiah or to jeremiah and then there were men who came along and said that were connected with hananiah and they said this guy speaks treason he's speaking against the nation of israel but what you see when when when when when spiritual discernment when when when eyes are left from a people and people leave the word they'll believe anything when what happened with eve when here cain came along what did she say i've gotten a man from the lord in one part of that it was true in the sense of there's a law of reproduction but in the sense that it was god's desired will that she would give herself to that of the serpent the enemy using that tool to then bring forth cain that was not god's program but you see she had gotten away from the word to where it should just believe anything now the thing is is that the people had gotten away from the word to where they couldn't understand god had called israel to of a certain uh the name that god would use you find it in the book of deuteronomy uh jesus which is god's ideal character of israel of how that her life of how israel was to live and how they were to walk before god but she drifted from that character you see this is why it doesn't matter so much about we can look back at history and say well you know we're relying on this from history but remember what what was in the history is truly past you can't live off of the history you've got to live off of present tense jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of god when he sent moses to deliver uh the the the children of israel he never sent him with the i was right his name was not revealed as the i was or i will be but it is the i am and that's how god he reveals himself to his children in this hour and that's what draws you to him is because he reveals himself as the ever-present god the i am that i am it is a reality it might seem like a few words but god that is revealing his character his nature and that is he is the ever-present god they had lost their sense of discernment and they were taking the word that was being spoken in this time by jeremiah it had even from the time of isaiah they were looking at it as being a treasonous word you're speaking against the nation of israel and god wasn't speaking against as far as the the nation god was coming against the sin that had drew them from the character that his word had brought them out of egypt and was desiring to form inside of their life they had drifted from what god had desired it wasn't treasonous but you see this is why spiritual discernment is so necessary in our life and in our walk we have to rely on him because there are things that you and i are brought face to face with that emotionally we would side emotions can be moved even in the wrong direction that's what satan did to eve he began to talk to her then he started to touch to it touch her her emotions moved her in disobedience to the word spiritual discernment will help you to discern even though emotionally you feel pulled this way but spiritual discernment will keep you centered on the word and it'll override that emotion i mean the backdrop what a place i mean if we're looking at a photo op here my here he is standing in the third entry to the house of the lord and here he is he's asking inquiry of jeremiah i don't want you to hide nothing from me the reality of it is is that zedekiah is hoping trusting somehow jeremiah is going to change what he said originally but god don't change his mind he said i'm god and i change not men change but god don't change his nature disposition what it was before is still the same today and one thing we would look and say oh my zedekiah is here speaking to him in the uh you know the third entry to the house of the lord what a reverence but you see all of that is is uh important to reverence the house of the lord i mean we shouldn't come in here and just talk we shouldn't just let me just preach a little bit we shouldn't just come in here and plop down and just expect and say well you know what god's been giving us good services man i i can't wait till we get in there you've got to make an investment and that investment means even in you getting here and coming in here and praying and seeking out the lord not just slipping in here well you know i just praise god i barely made it try that on your job and see if it works [Applause] sweet jesus in the book of malachi they were bringing sacrifices to god that were lame blind and whole and god said go offer that to your governor your boss go offer that to them see if they'll accept that amen he deserves our very best amen he has given he didn't give a second best come on somebody jesus is not the second person of the godhead it's god himself come down he gave us himself [Applause] [Music] i think that's a little extreme those of you that work on machines you don't just punch the clock and go on over there and start working on a machine you get in there enough time they got they got things they're going to tell you like such things like they'll say hey you know uh brother joey don't call your brother but i will they say hey brother joy look that that third floor up there don't we've already got the trim taken care of on that floor up there all you got to do is start right here and on this here or when you get on the machine hey we're we got we got a repair man over there on this right here you have to get debriefed before you start into that lord i did not know we're going to go this way but you see what it is there's an investment to what you're doing don't give that first place and give god second place he deserves first place any knowledge you have any skills you have any ability you have the job you have the clothes on your back the air that you breathing it belongs to him he's allowed you to use it reverence what a reverential thing it was all my zedekiah it's here the third entry of the house of the lord but you see god is looking for a deeper reverence god doesn't want a photo op all right all right amen well i'm identified with the message having a book don't identify you with a message having a tape having a picture having your belt buckle having water visiting all the sites don't identify you with the message the only way you're identified with it is to have the living god living inside of you reference like a photo op god wants a greater reverence the reverence that god looks for is a life that would be willing to let itself down to him that he can come and tabernacle his life inside yes this is what a real true marriage and a real true union is about it's not about 50 50. right right it's about how can i please one another amen now god let me just refer to this without taking time necessarily to read it not that i don't think it needs to be read it's very important but in hebrews chapter 12 paul under inspiration he he brings the comparison of where israel was called to uh mount horeb but on that mountain remember god was going to speak to him and it thundered it rumbled even a beast that touched the mountain had to be slaughtered and israel said let not god speak anymore but let moses speak [Music] you see god's desire was that he would speak through man it would be for mankind one of the greatest stumbling blocks it would be the simplicity that would actually go beyond the reasonings and would actually be that that would overthrow the reasonings of man is god to come down in a man a person who is fallible full of mistakes uh maybe he had said this wrong or you know the men should have said this and he said this but yet it takes a real faith and faith itself is that which comes by an experience that gives you an eyesight to be able to look beyond that flesh and to recognize that that is god and that's god speaking to me god chose fallible men the infallible god chose fallible men to come down and use and speak his word through and it would be that word when the rest of him would say he's just a man ah he's just a man but there's something about it that the elect of god can recognize though that's a man but coming out of there is the worship that moves from that of mount horn where the laws were given thou shalt not and thou shalt not and thou shalt not remember the law was needed because how could there be a penalty without a law it's like out here 35 miles per hour right you don't believe they'll enforce it go 35 and one quarter over by god's grace i've never been pulled over but you understand you you know this what good would it do did not have a law but you see law was that which spoke and it was brought it was condemnation it pointed out you're guilty but this in itself what it was all part of the plan where god himself where we were held guilty our nature our nature was contrary to god's nature but down on the inside beneath that old nature there was a seed of god on the inside amen that's why it would bother you wasn't just your conscience there's a seed down there on the inside as much as you tried to fit in with the world you couldn't fit in with them you might do some of the things they do say some of the things they say partake of some of the things they partake of but you still can't fit in amen [Music] it'd be like trying this is made out of triple brick this this building on the outside it'd be like taking a triple brick and or taking another kind of brick or another color and trying to fit it in here it would stick out like a sore thumb come on eagle you were in the chicken yard they made fun of you and all those things this is why because god won't allow you to get comfortable because that's not where you belong that's not who you are [Applause] paulden brings it you're not come to mount horeb you come to mount sinai sinai or uh zion sorry my my mount sign mount zion this is where you come you come to this this living reality of the city that new jerusalem the living god dwelling in the midst of his people not just god dwelling in the man christ jesus but now that same god who came down and he paid the price he redeemed us he sent back the holy ghost so that the same holy ghost would live and continue on the work that has begun there in his life he is the apostle of our profession and the apostolic age is still in session he's still calling lies to himself the gospel is still going out he's still filling with the holy ghost he's still sending you you might wonder why am i in this department why am i going to work over there you are sent by god as a representation of the gospel of jesus christ your life is a witness that god is alive amen don't take that lightly your life is a witness that god is alive your life is a witness that god is not confined to church walls your life is a testimony that is not bound by traditions and creeds and reforms but your life is a testimony let me tell you what god does sounding out through your life you might look back and say well i wish i hadn't done that in my past i wish i hadn't done that in my past your past has been chopped off when you've been filled by the spirit of god the abstract to the title deed has come it has joined you into that real eternal germ of god there's an expression that's going forth in your life and the very things about your life somebody else might be bound with that or seemingly maybe something less but there's a testimony out of your life that they aren't going to some place over in israel mount zion but mount zion is a dwelling place where the spirit of the living god there's a representation on earth that there is another city there is another kingdom there is another king there is the king of kings and your life is an expression of it as the word has moved inside of you more than a photo op verse 24 of that i will read this one this is what we're called to and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant now listen to me carefully jesus said no man cometh to the father but by me you can't get around him you can't go over him you can't go under him are you hearing me we're gonna pick this up you can't get to him you cannot get to god you cannot get back into the promises without coming through jesus christ and he is the word aren't you glad you've been invited back home [Applause] hey the reality of it was we were on that train and they're just having to make a rest stop we were under spiritual amnesia boy let me just preach what i got in front of me but you happen to recognize something that's familiar familiar to this no familiar to this and jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of abel remember this blood speaks better things this blood has a voice this blood is not there saying uh you're guilty you're guilty you're guilty this blood says all are guilty but i've set you free will you accept your freedom [Applause] that's the sounding of this jubilee the acceptable year of the lord [Applause] and the scripture said see that you refuse him not verse 25 that speaketh for if they escape not who refused him that spake on earth much more shall we shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven whose voice then shook the earth this time notice the contrast coming from mountain horror mount sinai but now he hath promised saying yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven heavens and earth will pass away is that right there's got to come a change of administration amen the earth is a redeemable attribute of god there's got to come a passing away of the world and the heavens all of the contaminants the pollution of demons devils that are there in the atmosphere listen this is bible for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and spiritual wickedness in high satan has control of every kingdom yeah he has control of every one of them but there's one kingdom he don't have control over him and that's the kingdom of god amen he's afraid of the kingdom of god [Music] the kingdom of god is god's word made power to you in you and through you we receive a kingdom a god of a dominion that of a domain that of an authority because the very king himself by his word he comes and he sets down on the throne of our heart courage we wouldn't have this kind of a courage if it wasn't for him if we were looking at something fleshly to back us up we would not have the courage to stand but the courage comes from knowing in whom we have believed and to know who's there backing us up we got the same back-up plan that david had we got the same back-up plan that the hebrew children have we got the same back-up plan that elijah has brother there ain't nothing breach beats this plan it's not on the exchange you can't sign up for it but you can't accept it you're talking about a health plan it will change your soul and it will lead to the change of your body whereby we receive receive receive a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our god is a consuming fire remember here we are standing in this hour in a time that god would declare our position in the scriptures where we're at we're in a time of fulfillment where things have been laid as types it's now in a time of fulfilling those types god would express and identify the age the time the characteristic of this age this age is known as the lady of seeing age ladies means what people's rights yes that's what it means people are fighting for rights but if that's happening in the natural and believe me they're spiritual their spirits influencing that daniel prayed and he had to wait 21 days because the prince of persia withstood gabriel from coming right but then michael showed up let me tell you something the devil has tried to stop you might have prayed and there's prayers you pray and the devil has tried to stop it but you let christ show up [Applause] hallelujah you might be waiting on your gabriel that has a special message for your life but remember it'll be christ that'll break through and allow gabriel to come to you you see the only thing that satan would like to hold it back that's why he'll try to sit in service and get your mind on this get your mind on this and then he'll raise up your own flesh and everything else in this situation well i can't oh that don't you realize what that is that's the prince of persia that's trying to withhold you but if you'll stand right there on god's word he said ask the father anything in my name and i will do it brother that will invite michael to show up and you'll receive your answer you'll receive the deposit of the message in your soul [Applause] you can't keep back god from his children the devil can try to wind him in all kinds of turmoil and wind them in this and wind them in that but you can't keep god back from his child [Music] there ain't enough corn chucks there ain't enough pig manure there ain't enough pig pens there ain't enough to keep god back from one of his children oh if you can receive it this morning he's pulling on you [Applause] he said behold i stand at the door and knock amen you gonna let me in here you better come on over here now i know you can hear me in there and i can't hear none of you out here but if i'm standing here at the door you're not going to know i'm at the door but if i start doing this hey man oh my goodness you want better examples you pray that god will give me better ones hallelujah but if i just stand at that door and i said brother why didn't you open the door i didn't know he's out there but when i started knocking he knows somebody's out there at that door [Applause] that door is the door of your heart very nobody can open that door it don't have no latches on the outside there ain't no keyhole on the outside the only one can open it is you the knocking at your door is his voice talking to you [Applause] and that's his promise i will come in lord you don't know what kind of shape my life is in i'll come in you're talking about good housekeeping oh jesus already had it beat before they ever came out with it better homes and gardens you didn't realize that your life was meant to be a garden of eden he already had it you just let him get back inside his garden let him get inside of your life he will bring forth the fragrance of the lily of the valley he will bring forth all the sweet spices he will cause his life to so move through your life to where he finds your life a place of rest [Music] i'm proof he knows how to clean up a life [Applause] and there's a lot more in here that as well as like that but you might be sitting here as a young person somebody else said well i never did anything but you still need your life cleaned up you still need your life you still need your nature changed so that it's one with god notice as he goes on we we understand that as here zedekiah is there with jeremiah in verse 17. notice jeremiah as we continue there he says to zedekiah thus saith the lord the god of host the god of israel notice who's speaking are you with me thus saith the lord the god of hosts not host hosts earthly and heavenly amen when jacob was coming back to bethel what did he call he he comes into that place he calls it man em which is what the cap of two hosts what host was it the earthly host and there's a heavenly host there is an earthly host he is god we might look right through here god might have a handful ten now i trust it's everybody in here that god can sow our lives or so surrender that he could work through but remember it's not our hands doing it it's him working through his body but we are not alone we are encamped about by angels he's the god of hosts he's letting jeremiah know that all the angels the anointings they come with the word there's protection in the word there's defense security peace life in the word the god of hosts the god of israel look at this if thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of babylon's princes this is what they were calling treason yes as israel we want us to go out to babylon out to the king who's here see what zedekiah and many were wanting they wanted because what they had saw the chaldeans babylonians had come up and encamped around the city this is just a chapter even before that and the egyptians had come up and jehovah was king and the egyptians were able to put pressure on the chaldeans and cause the chaldeans babylonians to flee you know it's just like when somebody sometimes can get into a hot thick mess oh lord i need you oh lord i need you brother say i know i need you oh i need this but the reality of it is they don't want god they want their mess fixed y'all gonna preach with me now but you recognize if you never get what it is on the inside corrected you'll be in another mess because it's this guy on the inside that needs to be lined up when you really received a message it straightens out what's been a mess are you with me but you see they would look at it as though why in the world should we go out to babylon this is what they were calling teresa you're against us no no no god let them know even if all the chaldeans were wounded this is what he said in the word even if all the babylonians were wounded they would be back here again how god already said judgment is coming from that nation and they came back they came back now here is the mercy of god that would actually express them zedekiah's got a choice remember he's a leader right you hear me daddy husband he's a leader a leader it's time to lead leadership is not something it's many things what people want but in this day and age leadership is what they once handed to them i mean they just graduated kindergarten and they want to be part of they want to be a ceo right just makes sense right i mean you know i just started working you know wendy's how to be the boss here aren't you glad that we've grown up a little bit the older you get the more you want to try to say i don't want that responsibility i don't want the responsibility because every decision itself there's a lot of things that's tied to it you start watching the footsteps you take of how everything is tied to it a little bit more closely well that was free you won't get that from dr dobson but it will come from the word of god if thou will assuredly go forth unto the king of babylon's princes then thy soul shall live and this city shall not be burned with fire and thou shalt live in thine house but if thou will not go forth to the king of babylon's princes then shall this city be given into the hand of the chaldeans and they shall burn it with fire and thou shalt not escape out of their hand what's he asking zedekai to do put your life into the hands of the word and go out amen to the king of babylon remember where all this plays in judgment is coming do you want an escape that's right do you want mercy see this is god's mercy his voice is telling them put your life take your life and put it into the hands of god in his word what zedekiah's response zedekiah the king said unto jeremiah i am afraid of the jews the jews you're not afraid of the chaldeans he's more afraid of the jews than he is the chaldeans that i'm more afraid of the jews i'm afraid of the jews that are falling to the chaldeans lest they deliver me into their hand and they mock me isn't this just how the devil wants to paint what a real surrendered life is you're a weakling you're weak as far as in my life i'm as weak as we can be you might have all the muscles in the world you might be as big as goliath you might have legs that look like pillars you might have such a personality but let me tell you something you're no match for the devil flesh and blood cannot defeat satan flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god we're talking about spiritual powers that have been in conflict since it was back there in heaven and let me tell you something the devil didn't win in heaven he got kicked out he led aside by rebellion he told a tale a lie and he drew a third part of the angels is that right that's true this conflict has been going on down through time there's only one thing that can overcome that spiritual power it's got to be a greater spiritual power there's only one that can then overcome one who's strong that's a stronger one come on the scene i'm afraid of the jews isn't that the case of where many would say well if i do this you know my husband will leave me or my wife will leave me or what about brother so what about so and so what will my friends think what will this you see it's never about people way out there it's fear about what will so and so think it's quite simple either you want to surrender your life and dwell with god or you're desiring to go to all hell maybe jesus put a little bit of sweetener on that before you help you get it down it's quite simple you what what it is that you value what it is you value and you hold on to it where will it lead you amen it'll either bring your soul into the presence of god or it'll continue to harden your heart and harden it and harden it and harden it because you are afraid what will they say if you're going to stand on god's word god's going to back up his word amen i said god will back up his word god himself will come and stand inside of you there's not no doubt one person in here that's already experienced this sure when god got a hold of my life that friends try to call friends tried to come around hey why don't you come on out to the bar with us why don't you come on out i said i don't go them places no more well why and why not you're afraid are you afraid i said no i said they're somewhere i don't know where it's at in the word but there's somewhere in the word that said how can two or three that how can two or three agree and walk together how can they accept they agree and i said something has happened inside of my life that cannot agree nor does it desire those things well you can just drink a coke or pepsi just want to make sure they wouldn't offend me coke or pepsi i said i don't want to be in them places i have no desire for them you see what i'm talking about the gospel is not self-reform if it was self-reform every church would have a down path people would have it down path this is not a come in a craft session where you make yourself a christian this is where you come and you lay your life on the altar of god and god takes that old nature out of you and he places that new nature on the inside of you and you're not afraid then well my uncle my aunt think i'm a nut let me just tell you something it's true you're not but at least you're threaded to the right bolt you're gonna be somebody's nut you're gonna be somebody's fool robert's your girlfriend's food your boyfriend's full you're going to be somebody's fool my goodness who brought that grill in here this morning jesus said don't you fear him that can kill the body but you fear him that can kill soul and body [Music] everybody is going to have to stand before god and it might be your time before this day's up [Music] that scares me you know ought not to there's a place of safety where you can get that fear of condemnation from off of your back it ain't on your back it's there in your soul but there's one who can lift that and place his life on the inside of you brother samuel i keep coming and hearing the same thing the weather forecast hadn't changed it's going to rain amen i'm not a false prophet i'm a true prophet [Applause] false prophets promise peace false prophets pat you on the back and when they speak powdered sugar flies out of their mouth but a true prophet is come and is armed with the sword of the lord and brother it separates it chops it brings out what a real son and daughter of god is on the inside it's actually setting you free if you can receive it [Music] they'll deliver me they'll mock me probably most of you can remember you just didn't only have to go back and face family and i know like for my family it wasn't you know like i had to go back and face something strange or way out or whatever more but i still had to go back and face on the job right they knew the sam that had walked out on that friday they had walked with on that shift but when that monday came it was a different one there was a one that walked in i'm ashamed of this but i'll say it for to show how god works by his power i said god i need you to change my language i can't even control my language i've got so far within that god i need you i need your help let me just tell you something that right there even when that was prayed when god had got a whole my life there was many things of how god just just took right from my life but i never forget when i walked up on that factory floor it got up there on the second second or third floor i got ready to walk out there for the shift and the spirit of god he spoke to my heart he said i want you to notice i've changed your language hallelujah glory be to god he changed it it wasn't what i did it wasn't reform i've saved this so many times say this so many times say this so many times it's not a work of flesh and blood i'm talking about a supernatural god if you don't get nothing else out of this service it's nothing more than a supernatural god and you must meet that god when you meet him you won't be worried about who mocks you let me preach why i'm on it the reason the devil wants to try to hang that out and it'll come right to your mind right now what happens if you make a move what happens to that wife what happens to that husband what happens to your friends what are they going to say you know he's trying to do he's trying to bluff you amen he's trying to intimidate you he's just doing what galactic to david you aren't but a ruddy youth they sent you out here you ain't even fit for the dogs he was trying to get him and hinder him but david had received a word david received a word that was bigger than goliath we've received a word that's bigger than any devil out of hell we've received a word that's greater the devil wants to try to mock and try to run down i say you ought to stand in the very move in the very rushing wind of the holy ghost and let him breathe a breath of courage a breath of reality a breath of transformation from the supernatural god [Applause] [Music] hallelujah thank you lord bless the lord hallelujah jeremiah said verse 20 they shall not deliver thee that should have been it right there amen but if you're looking at jeremiah it's just a man then you question it he was a man it's true he got ready just like any other man would get ready fought sickness got weary got tired but he was god's prophet he was god's spokesman with god's message look what he says obey i beseech thee the voice of the lord which i speak unto thee so it shall be well unto thee and thy soul shall live notice is this not the gospel i'm the lord that forgiveth all thine iniquities deals with your soul first and healeth all thy diseases it's an inward work that starts a transformation and it leads to a transformation out here amen it's a change that's going on and you find that change once that change even how god is dealing of dealing and drawing a life to himself there's a change going on you might sit and say well brother samuel i know i've not received the holy ghost yet but you know there's a change going on in your life god is moving sovereignly on your life like he did on the earth at the beginning the earth was meant to be around the s-u-n but it took the esso in to bring the earth around the s-u-n it has taken the holy ghost to move and bring you and i into position in himself in the word and as we will yield to it oh we might start out like a big old as brother ram described it a clinker clunker of ice that is way out there it doesn't look like anything at all but as it begins to come around that of the sun and it's brought into position oh there's still darkness there's still chaos there's all types of voidness that's about that but if it'll stay right there the voice of god that has brought it there in position as it yielded to it it will begin to work on that life and the seeds that it's already planted there by his word it will actually cause those seeds to come out in its ordained season it's true your whole life is not going to be a garden of eden but your soul will be amen [Applause] because it's in the soul that god chose to put his headquarters it's in the garden of eden where he chose to put the union of his son and his son's bride are you with me this is why the outer two parts of our life there's got to be the headquarters the headship of the word on the inside the garden of eden then it will control the rest y'all with me amen praise the lord let me read these scriptures here out of mark 8 verse 34. and when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also he said unto them whosoever will come after me let him deny himself so jesus will never come around and pick you up by your shirt color call her however you want to say it he we don't come around and do it but he brings us to a place to where we will let ourself down now you might say glory to god brother samuel i've already denied myself i've been born again of the spirit of god wonderful that's daily though bear his cross daily oh i know if you could have had the perfect wife she'd have been everything that you wanted but god didn't give you what you wanted he gave you what you needed oh the perfect husband would have been and i understand friends you you please take this with a grain of salt oh it would have been this and that but god has placed just exactly what we needed you want some quotes for this they're not here but i can give them to you god gave moses what he needed [Music] he gave him zappora brother brown says i'd say that the desert wasn't big enough for him sometimes now don't sit there and look at me like oh my our ideas they always just mesh i mean it's just like if i set a fourth of a cup of flour and there's a half a cup needed she's the other fourth and it just comes around brother brahman said how do you know he said that high tempered wife ain't your cross that you've got a bear or that ocd husband preached brother samuel hey i'm preaching amen i'm talking about denying ourselves because you see sometimes people only look at this tonight self and my getting after this and getting after this but you ought to also remember there's a life to live every single day whosoever will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever shall lose his life give it for my sake and the gospels not for the church for his sake for his sake well i stopped wearing pants because the church preaches on i'm glad you did that i'm so glad you did that i stopped wearing makeup or or brothers you stopped wearing them britches i'm so glad you did that i'm glad you took the earrings out i'm glad you got rid of them high heels that make you seem about seven foot when you're only five foot two i'm glad for all that i'm glad brothers that you got rid of them tight britches that homosexuals make i'm glad for that but it goes a little bit deeper than that maybe i'll preach from down here the rest of time [Applause] not for the church's sake well my church says that i have to have long hair that's not what the the church stands on the word the word says this [Music] that's right when they women got to act when israel got to act in rebels this is a scripture in the book of jeremiah when they begin to act rebellious god told them all daughter of jerusalem cut off your hair you mean god believes in cutting hair no he's letting them know that that hair being cut it shows you're not under headshift that's right the bible says when you really receive the message you got power on your head are you with me well how long is it you know i just trimmed the dead ends now you know that's the dumbest argument in the world your hair don't grow from the ends it grows from your roots come on somebody while just trim the ends and it'll make it grow more long hair is uncut hair there might be a sister that her hair maybe because of age or maybe some other condition it ain't able to grow more than just down right there but it's uncut hair and that is her glory in the eyes of god but brother samuel but jeremiah we're standing in the third entry of the house of the lord shouldn't we be reverent we should we should want to reverence his word we should want to reverence the holy ghost that's speaking to us that's dealing with our life that's what we should want to reverence whether we're in the house of god or not if you act outside different than you present yourself in here you're a hypocrite you're not a genuine christian the way that you act out there and you come in here and act different and put on a show you're a hypocrite but there's a god of reality that can make you a real christian inside of here it'll make you a real christian out there why he'll give you a real holy ghost experience on the inside that'll make you a real christian amen maybe you all should just left the cold water on back there i'm trying to be funny but everyone so i gotta loosen you up so i can keep on coming this is thick stuff you're right you don't mold sons and daughters of god out of us if you're tired of living a halfway life if you're tired of being up and down and in and out come on now sometimes some of you i don't see you for months at a time and then you pop back in i don't know if you're m.i.a missing in action or where you're at oh lord jesus it's time to be a christian every single day it's time to let the devil know whose sounds you're wrong it's time for you to take a stand in the word of god stop letting your friends and your family and whoever more if they want to go that way let them go but you've got to call across jordan [Applause] don't sell out to a fashion don't sell out to an emotion don't sell out to family you be sold out to jesus christ [Applause] [Music] i know i'm preaching in a city that is mostly predominantly catholic i don't care how many baptist churches and pentecostal churches and whatever more that catholic spirit still here in this city and don't you act like a roman catholic either i'm not your holy ghost but the holy ghost is the holy ghost the word has come in power to set you free god can use your life to just as much as he can use mine [Music] i believe we ought to be respectful to the servants of god and the gifts of god but i don't believe that god is bankrupt i believe that just as much as we see hell that is all around us the heaven itself has come down let me tell you something little sister you can stand on that word and you've got jesus christ backing up that prayer [Music] your little one gets sick you've got an authority to stand there on the word of god instead i take my token and satan take your hands off [Applause] these aren't photo-op moments but these are moments that says this crown belongs to me for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul how many of these rich people oh brother samuel you don't know what i would give just to have a great big house means you gotta clean a whole lot more hold one of these mansions on the lake that's whatever one of these this or whatever more it's not the size of your house it's not how much earthly goods you've got it's how content you are with what god has given you amen this thing right here is materially minded i notice people say they ain't materially minded but i'm not going to preach there but we're going to go the reality of it is listen the first birth come because eve got materially minded she wanted something that was out there that was alluring her i know there's some things god don't have to tell you don't do it hey hey come over here don't do it you know you can't write that out of your checking account you know you got to pay you know your ties you got that and you know you're offering that's what you give them you are you know hey hey you know you can't do that connie will come down and do that but if you don't honor his word he'll let you know that you've taken something that belongs to him and you've taken it other places god ain't going to come down and do that for us we've got to do that we've got to do that in honor to his word can i have just a few more minutes i didn't see how many minutes they were i said a few more some of you are like man what shall they prophet a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul that's the truth amen i can't help but think of a song brother bill i'd rather have jesus hallelujah brother greg that's uh i'd rather have jesus than silver or gold it's not saying that that god is against you having a you know a nice house or a good job anyone is saying that's not all we're saying you know what god has all of those things but the point that god lets us know is the order is always him first that's true god has people who are wealthy so that he can point out to others who would not submit themselves to god and say look i've got people who are just as wealthy as you and they submit surrender their life to me whether you can receive it or not always think of that little sister who was in the wheelchair but the ram talks about it talks about empowered transformation and there's power transformation or god's power to transform whichever one is in the trailer park then brother brown comes around and preaches the first service on the oddball he talks about it again this little sister he's they've prayed for her so many times she's in a wheelchair but yet brother bran points out one thing about her he said she's got such a beautiful character and a sweet spirit he said i i don't understand why god hasn't healed her see the prophet didn't have the power to heal the people but he was god's agent right to pray the prayer of faith and god came down and did the work that was to build confidence for you and i yeah that god stands behind his word it will stand upon his word but think about it there could be people that say lord i would have served you but you never brought me out of this wheelchair and think about it on that day he'll say come here she won't be rolling up there in a wheelchair there won't be somebody pushing her but my he won't even nothing have to be said his daughter the testimony of her life she lived a life of victory though she was in a wheelchair she was free freedom isn't that you've got all your bills paid and everything is just right my four on 401k boy this is rising and this is rising those things make this guy feel good but it's where you've got real freedom right here that's real peace because when things get tight you've got to have ground to stand on when things aren't going just right and the doctor says you won't make it till december you've got to have some ground to stand on to say amen i know in whom i have believed you've got to have ground to stand on to say the devil cannot take me till god's finished with me and god hasn't told me that he's finished with me so i'm going to stand on his word and i'm calling you a liar that's all right that's the truth brother and sister or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation of him also shall the son of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father with the holy angels we'll just stop here on can't go on but this morning when i that's scripture whoever be ashamed of me and my words in this generation i said in this generation people can take the words that were given to a previous generation and it was part of god's working are you with me it's like a house you buy the property then they got to dig it out and pour the walls for the basement crawl space whatever you're going to do that's all a start but i don't think no one in here i think i pretty much know maybe i ain't been to everybody's house but i i'm pretty sure that no one in here is just living in walls that are put up for a basement with nothing over you i'm pretty sure of that he said brother sam what are you saying people can look back to a previous time and say well i i accept the lord jesus christ as my lord and savior that's a wonderful start that's let me just tell you god bless you i repent and you ought to repent and let me just tell you repent doesn't mean well you know that ain't really like me that's like trying to smear cream cheese on moldy bread repentance gets down and says forgive me lord i'm sorry i'm wrong that's real repentance that's a secret many people don't get what they come asking for because they don't really repent well you know how hard i have it god you know how that ain't repentance you're wanting god to feel sorry for you that's what zedekiah wanted zedekiah was hoping that he could being there in that third entry of the house of the lord that jeremiah would feel sorry for him jeremiah would be your move beyond his emotions you think it wasn't an emotional moment very emotional moment i mean we're standing in the house of the lord we're standing in a place very close to where when a man walked in there if he did not walk in the high priest if he did not walk in and his life was was under the blood and this is why they they had to tie that that cord they pull them out because they died in the presence of god i can't remember the statistic you gave me the one time brother bill where it actually goes back into it how many hundreds died between certain high priests you know why they took it lightly they're just walking in just took it casually and they died when they got there very reference place but it's going to take more than you just taken your shoes off moses took his shoes off but it takes you laying down your life and i ask you is he worth it i can't determine that for you i know how i know what has come to me but i can't decide that that's you you see now is jesus christ on your hands what will you do with him many can look back into a previous generation they look back into the time even of wesley oh well i don't smoke no more i i don't run around with women i don't smoke pot no more i don't sniff crack i don't i don't look at pornography no more i don't do this and i don't do that those are one thank god thank god for a cleaned up sanctified life but you've got to go deeper how deep to where you become like this jacket a shell that he can put on [Music] and when you go walk on the job they see you but it's who's inside you yeah who's inside you the same god who called me cleanse me fill me amen amen the reality is isn't well i don't do this no more i don't it's your life has been changed god has revealed his word to you in you all right and he's living through you amen it's where this message is not a movement that's right it's not an idea it's not what it's not what grandpa believes or grandma believes it's not what dad believes it's not what mom believes it's not what brother believes it's not what sister believes is what i believe and i believe it more than anything else it has unfolded the mystery of my life this reality of this word will break babylon from your life babylon is confusion it will break confusion from around your life what does that delight will you walk in that light whosoever will be ashamed of me and my words in this generation god's not going to judge you by a previous generation by a previous message you'll be judged by this word as you come and here you are you'll be judged by this word but i say within that can you hear there is a certainty of judgment but can you hear the certainty of god's mercy that says come unto me oh you will give you saboth for your soul if you can hear the voice of god you can hear the voice of mercy who was jeremiah god's voice to zedekiah in order for zedekiah to serve god he had to accept jeremiah i don't have time for that this morning but he had to recognize this is god's voice this is god's instrument while there's mercy i say god i want to walk in that mercy amen you don't have another day promised you don't have another moment promised i don't nobody does this might be the last sermon i'll ever minister i don't know i don't have the promise of this evening i don't have the promise of tomorrow brother samuel what would what would it be if god took you off the scene well if god's the one who brought me on the scene and brought me here then that same god will raise up a man to take and carry it on it's god's work it's god's work but the reality is is that not one has a promise of tomorrow if you find yourself like zedekiah this morning don't harden your heart right don't just don't say shh don't tell nobody shh zedekiah has told jeremiah when the princes come and ask you if we talk together don't tell i want this to be quiet why is that a car i'm afraid they'll mock me whosoever will be ashamed of me and my words in this generation he said so will i be ashamed of you when i come his coming is certain will you be ashamed or will you be one who welcomes him says come lord jesus you see how you'll be then is how you are now come lord jesus come lord jesus come lord jesus amen come into my life lord move in lord in a deeper way if there's anything in there lord that's crowding you out lord i want you to have more of my life lord help me to die lord more to myself lord i want this word to have full preeminence in my life amen bring forth the lord that garden of eden from my soul let him have three minutes in your life let's pray lord jesus lord as i told you this morning some months ago when you led me across this lord i never had this laid out this was not anything that jumped out to me at that time as far as what is spoken in here i told you this morning i'm glad you kept it from me and pushed it back lord in myself these are not the type of services or sermons things lord that i would want to preach no real man of god delights in preaching and bringing things lord that would be somewhat hard but lord jesus from my heart i know lord god that your children they can tell lord god your spirit has delivered it you've not meant them harm but you've meant to call them that they would come to you lord there's lives right here this morning you're calling you're calling you've been calling them [Music] i pray this morning lord [Music] may you help them see the certainty of the word that would lift them above fear above doubt may they see the glory of what it means to be identified with you may that lord sweep into their heart lord god i ask right now in the name of jesus christ that god you would sweep into young people's hearts sweep into the middle age lord god sweeping lord god to the older ones lord lord god if there's one lord that's not made a complete surrender lord i ask lord god here this morning may they let down lord and obey your voice lord god for things that you've been dealing with their life on you're calling them to it lord there's a hunger within their life they don't want just a photo op they don't want to just be identified with a book or tape or a picture they don't want to just be identified with the church they want to be identified with you if there's something they can say why this i'll tell you grandma or grandpa or brother samuel or this or that it ain't the person if there's anything at all that's good in any of us it's jesus christ he's the one he's the one that you want to be identified with and let me tell you something he came down and identified himself with us [Music] he came down he lived in a body that was made in the likeness of sinful flesh experienced what frustrations can feel like headaches sickness to be despised to be rejected he knows that feeling he knows what it feels like to have a black name he knows what it feels like to be the life of the jokes he knows what it's like to be mocked beard pulled from his face spit on why would he do that [Music] that he might be the perfect offering for you and me [Music] to pay that sin debt to show us the greatness of that life [Music] he would make a way before that time before that time not one of us could die spiritually as far as to lay down our life and be born again we couldn't but he made a way through calvary the victory that was won there that day [Music] was the manifestation of what took place in gethsemane [Music] before you ever would come to an altar [Music] you could come to this altar right here [Music] you're always more than welcome to come and pray but let me just say this to you before you can ever before it ever come into this altar it starts in the altar of your heart he'll meet you in the altar of your mind where you know and right there begins to struggle the battle [Music] demons are gathered all around spirits that's held your bondage habits that's held around your life devils that's told you you've tried and you'll never be able to make it [Music] let me tell you something that devil's a liar he's already been conquered he's only saying that because he's afraid there's a mighty god a greater than solomon that's here he can lift you from defeat from the darkness where mud has been packed into your life he can lift you into the victory of real light [Music] why don't you just let it start within you hallelujah say lord i'm tired of being a secret believer i'm tired of being one way at church in one way outside in the world i can't keep living two different ways i can't serve two masters the lord the master that's over my life right now he makes me do this and i don't want to do it it makes me do this and i don't want to do it [Music] why don't you just say lord i want you to be the sole master over my life you don't have to be a slave to sin any longer you don't have to be a slave to that old habit you don't have to stay there in bondage you can walk right out of here this morning as a free man a free woman you're not approaching mount sinai you're approaching mount zion mount sinai all it can do is condemn you the word could say you're guilty but there's a word here this morning that can say i loosen you i set you free i'll change your life [Music] you're in the place like zedekiah was in we're standing in a really reverent place right now in his presence [Music] you're not asked to go out to the king of babylon but you're asked to come out to the king of kings the king of righteousness the king of peace you're asked to come to king jesus [Music] i asked you this morning why don't you quit trying to lick your spots quit trying to straighten up your life quit trying to iron out the wrinkles why don't you let him take control of your life you put your life in so many other people's hands why don't you put your life in his hands if you keep it in your hands it'll be no more than just a little lad's lunch but if you'll put it in his hands he'll bring out of your life everything that he's packed inside of you why don't you let him have the right of way why don't you cast down imagination cast down reasonings why don't you call the devil a liar say i'm not gonna serve you i'm not gonna be your puppet any longer i'm responding to the voice of god to the voice of mercy look away to jesus don't look to your spouse don't look to your family don't look at the boss on the job look to jesus he's the author and the finisher of your faith make preparation for departure make preparation he will put a joy in your life that no man can give you no woman can give you he'll put a joy in your life that's real he'll put a joy in your life that's greater than every friend that you could ever have he'll put a joy in your life that the stock market will never be able to control he'll put a joy in your life that is real [Music] as our hands are bound i wonder is there one that would want to stand say lord [Music] i'm not going to be ashamed of you [Music] of him his words the person of christ lord god i've been identified with a lot of things but i want to be identified with you i don't want to just be associated with the message i want to be identified with you lord that's what the message really is that's what the message really is if i'm identified with you then i've received the message i've heard it i've come under the blood i wonder this morning would there be someone here that want to stand someone that wants to surrender your life remember he said if you stand for me if you confess me before men i'll confess you before my father god bless you he sees that he sees that stand in your heart that you've made hallelujah he's there to meet you right on your knees god bless you this morning is there another jesus has come he's calling god bless you will you stand will you stand upon his word god bless you there's another one right there god bless you sister amen hallelujah he said you'll stand for me i'll stand for you

takes situations that look hopeless we're in the presence of a living god who takes what is hopeless and he brings forth change and reality and transformation we're in the presence of the living god don't you fear little sister [Music] and we're going to stand and we're going to pray there's some that's standing here maybe there's a rededication there's some that's standing here to say i'm taking that stand right now i want to be identified with jesus christ i want to surrender my life i'm tired of the struggle i'm tired of the poor of the world i want to be identified with jesus christ in every part of my life hallelujah i want to be so full of the holy ghost till they mistake me for jesus christ when they see me coming they say pickles are christian [Music] and those of you that stood there maybe you never surrendered your life i'm going to pray with you first but i want you to know right now just no more than it was the voice of jeremiah this hadn't been the voice of samuel browning this has been god's voice speaking to you and the same god that spoke to your heart that same god is here to make good on every one of his promises i'm only here as a representation i'm only here as a veil but that god who made the promise is here to back it up and he said in his word his promise if you stand for me i'll stand for you [Music] now as we're praying you pour your heart out and say lord i'm standing right now forgive me lord god of my sins you stand right there all devils out of hell can be all gathered around but let me tell you something he's lost proud [Music] hallelujah amen in the name of jesus christ he's lost ground he's a defeated being the power and the lies that he's held over your head he's defeated in the name of jesus christ satan i rebuke you you're a liar hallelujah heavenly father lord jesus like david stood that day lord god goliath was more than a match for david as a person but david was standing there as a representative representative of the living god lord jesus i stand here and there's other full word-born spirit-filled sons and daughters of god that are standing right here this morning and lord where satan has wanted to lord god put lies and hold try to put fear upon lies but lord god his plans have been spoiled his scheme has been revealed and the magic conqueror is on the scene this morning to manifest that victory to their lives lord now father as their hearts are being poured out in a real repentance lord it's a welcoming the mighty conqueror that you would ride into their life with power oh god where you've already stripped satan oh lord jesus of his lies and every fear and every torment i ask the lord god in the name of jesus christ that is they walk into the waters of baptism i pray heavenly father that even in this moment their heart will be set to receive the baptism of the holy ghost [Applause] [Music] lord jesus i know it's not dependent on my strength it's you lord there's lives that are standing all around this building [Music] you're the love of our life [Music] you're the lovely one that's coming in plain view [Music] now father i pray right now in the name of jesus christ that god as they said they're going to stand for you maybe there's been areas that's been let down they forsake that they realize lord god as a son and daughter of god they don't have to take back nothing there's some sham guards here this morning that said that's enough devil you ain't taking no more of the crops this year no sir i'm a covenant son and daughter of god hallelujah [Music]
