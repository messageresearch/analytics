brother i know you'll be blessed by by the gift that the lord has placed in his life and uh we've been together and especially a lot with the byc and a lot of the meetings and i know a lot of the wonderful fellowship and things that we've had together and uh so we just want to just open our hearts and just pull on the word of the lord tonight the gift that god has placed there god's mindful of our need you believe that tonight how many are witnesses of that amen let's just let's just continue to sing this song as we invite brother trevor oh lord have your ways o have your way let that be

[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] my right justness oh god [Music] amen well praise the lord i believe i can preach now nothing like praying something like that before you get up in to minister the word thank you musicians appreciate it well if you would um well you're seated just stay seated and maybe i'll give you a little further introduction of who i am and then we'll stand and and uh read a scripture and and get into preaching but uh brother trevor eamon is who i am um my son zion i travel with my piano player um and i'm just thankful for that um left uh two other children at home azariah and gloriana and they're all older teenage now and and my wife anime and the puppy which amen is still a puppy which is why a lot of people are still at home but um well praise the lord yes amen thank you i received that so um but we just uh we lived there in sellersburg indiana um for the last three or four years we've been going to brother nathan bryant's church uh there in new albany and um just trying to put our shoulder to the wheel and be a help before that we were at the branham tabernacle for many years um and uh i was a sunday school teacher there for the last few years while we were there and and um like i said anywhere we are we're just trying to be a blessing amen so um how did i learn the word well yeah that's how i learned the word so i didn't know anything else until i we came into the message when i was about eight so uh i had a little bit of experience with some denomination and then we got out of that and uh before it was uh you know able to get any stick in me really and so we've just and my my father came to understand the message of the hour and brought it home to us and we've just been happy to be in the revelation of this day the word of the hour you know and so that's what i know about the word so that's the only thing i can i can preach from is is from from that angle so you don't have to worry about any any other kind of color you know so but we're going to talk about that maybe just a little bit let's see here i guess that's probably good enough introduction and i like to uh i guess by by calling i'm more of a teacher and i ran from that for a long time not ministering but from identifying myself as a teacher because i didn't want people to think i was boring and we kind of have a problem so with with thinking teachers are boring and i i'm just by the grace of god and hoping to change that reputation so praise the lord why don't you stand with me and we'll turn to this is a this is slightly just slightly a christmas message although when i would say that uh even if it were in late december it would you'd still be like that was a christmas mess but it kind of is um and and genesis chapter 3 and verse 15 you might think well that's not a normal text for a christmas message i don't do things normal you know aren't you glad that god gives unique gifts to all of us god didn't create you the way you are so that you know he could just change you he wanted to put his life on the inside of you but he created you to be the way you are so amen he wants the uniqueness that he placed he created you the way you are for a reason and god wants to use that and magnify that that's things that god put in your life so i'm just thankful you know that we're all not everyone the same right and we're not a bunch of robots but we're free in christ amen so genesis chapter 3 verse 15 i will put enmity between thee and the woman between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel if we just bow for the uh for a word of prayer lord we are thankful to be gathered together in the name of the lord jesus christ in a midweek service lord we're lord we're just happy to i know i am just so happy to just come out from the things the cares of the world that have enveloped our lives uh so much this week and to come and be in this little oasis lord jesus where we can sit by the cool stream and the waters of life lord and and take a cool drink and be refreshed lord in the presence of of almighty god and lord we know that you're here with us though we are unworthy of it oh father but you desired fellowship with us and lord we're so thankful so wash us of our every sin lord jesus and dwell with us lord speak to our hearts lord jesus and may you be pleased with every part of this service take control we ask in jesus name amen amen you may be seated so this is the first scripture in the bible the the first messianic prophecy the first prophecy that there would be a coming messiah and and so and so that's why i say well it's it's in a sense a christmas message as we think of of the coming of the messiah well that was jesus's birth jesus was the messiah he was the anointed christ and he was born there in bethlehem now this is the one the jews had been looking for ever since genesis 3 15 was was told to adam and to eve that the jews the the the seed of adam of adam and eve have been looking for that messiah to come ever since so so this is this is this is going to be the culmination event of of scripture here because what has happened here is there's been a fall and and now okay there's been a fall so so there adam and eve are and and we'll talk about it just a little bit more but but but there they are and now there's this fall and so now there's a curse and now there's a punishment but but now here given even in the punishment yet redemption is laced in the prophecy though he's sitting there telling them you're gonna you're gonna be scratching the ground and you're gonna bear children in pain but even so that seed that's coming that you'll bear in pain one day yet that is the place that that is going to bruise this serpent's head and that there will be victory over this serpent one day though maybe he has carried the day so far there's coming a day i won't let this thing stand but but my purpose is being done and i'm even now expressing who i am as a great and mighty savior as one who is love and now love can be defined you you recognize if we look at it for a moment that that we actually you know adam and eve if we think about it for a moment they're walking with god in the garden of eden every day every evening there they go lord so nice yes we were just walking down here to see the lions and and uh and get a drink of water for come with yes it's so wonderful that you came and there they are and it's like the fellowship that they have but yet we have more revelation and understanding more about who he is than they did because prior to the fall they could they could talk about the love of god but yet they couldn't have experienced it in the way that you and i do because now we can understand that the god of love doesn't just love those that are perfect doesn't just expect those to be perfect but he said it doesn't matter i am coming to reach down and pull you out of the depths of sin that's why i'm coming back because i'm gonna smite this serpent in the head and the problem that you're facing today well it's you're not gonna have that problem at one at some point now i'm going to have victory over it for you because i'm god you know i'm powerful enough to raise up stones to be children of abraham i could just wipe you off and get a new you know a new set of of adam and eve that aren't going to fall on me but that wasn't the purpose [Music] so how do you feel about your sin tonight well we should feel bad about it of course of course but god allowed it to be there to express his love to you so that you could understand the depths are you worthy of it no that makes it all the more great and makes him all the more loving [Applause] amen it's him tonight amen that's the one who we're looking for and that's the title tonight the one who is looked for we're looking for this messiah from genesis 3 15. he's the one we're looking for where can we find him and when will he come and that's what we're looking for tonight so what is that what is that talking about if we're saying we're waiting for this one to come now now the jews there at the time that jesus was born they're looking for a messiah and and they they don't have you know we can look back now and we can see the two comings of a messiah you see we're still looking for a messiah to come are we not because we understand the two comings of messiah but they at that time you know it would have been hard to understand that messiah was going to come two times yet they had scripture you know he's going to be bruised he's going to be broken and they're like well wow i don't understand how that's going to work because he's also going to come and he's going to be the king of kings and he's going to have a scepter the scepter of jacob out of genesis 49. so he's going to have a scepter he's going to rule so um don't know how that but you know what we we all do this right you know we all have a tendency to take the things that we hear really interest us and the things that don't so much well it's like god's gonna do that somehow but i mean you know king of kings here like like the whole bruising thing that's yeah probably just gonna be a little blip on the map that we're not even gonna notice because how can you be king of kings and be bruised like that how can you have the scepter and you know so we we looked at this one time i saw you know you you look at uh i think it's micah chapter 5 or it's micah 2 but i'm pretty sure it's micah 5 verse 2 that's thou bethlehem of frata where we understand that the messiah would come to be born that's when the magi went to herod and said hey and herod's like hey people that actually know these things where's the messiah to be born well bethlehem a fraud is what the scriptures say that's where messiah is coming from we'll read that chapter sometime you know okay other than bethlehem frata you're looking for someone who's a warrior to come and smack the assyrians around i mean that's if you're looking at micah chapter five that's what you're expecting so so here comes this baby boy wrapped in swaddling clothes from bethlehem [Music] but but how's he gonna like king of kings wait what that's not what we're looking for so they're looking for a messiah they they came to a place where they had a conception of what it was the word was saying and then he came and it didn't match their conception amen now aren't you so glad that we've moved beyond those kinds of things none of us do that have our own conceptions that are wrong sometimes we haven't changed that much unfortunately but by the by the blessing of god we can look at that history and take a warning from that you see it's you see what what ended up happening is over time they began to create this picture of who the messiah was and they were looking for their picture of what messiah was and then after you know after the um after the babylonians came and took everybody to captivity and assyrians took the northern kingdom to captivity you know and and so then okay now we're coming back from babylon we're renewing the temple in ezra and nehemiah and and okay this is great we're setting things up there's a change in in in what the they were looking for and they no longer were truly looking for you know a messiah they were looking for a messianic condition they were looking for what the messiah would do instead of who he was and often we get into the same place that we're looking for what messiah will do when he comes instead of looking for him and they stopped looking for him and they started looking for what he would do well he's going to drive out the romans that's what we want he's going to take care of our enemies he's going to make his kingdom here on earth even after jesus dies and rises again the disciples having spent so much time with him now he he dies he cleanses them of their their sins and he rises again and now they're like man now it's time you've been doing all this preaching and it's been great jesus really but will thou now at this time restore the kingdom they're still looking for him to drive out the romans he's like dad you missed the point you're looking for a condition of what you want instead of i'm right here and and and more than that i'm right here but i've rose again from the dead i've purchased your salvation i fulfilled genesis 3 15 the curse is not on you anymore to to where you're no longer you're not looking for just a lamb anymore but now i have went and now i'm gonna go and i'm gonna sit on that mercy seat and you are free from that and more than that i'm gonna rise again but i will come to you i will send you a comforter he will live in you he will show you things to come he will teach you what you have need of and there you are and so he's saying look not only am i going to be beside you but i'm going to be in you will thou at this time restore the kingdom of israel your sights were a little small disciples now you and i would have been in the same boat we wouldn't have known any better we know better because now we have the revelation we can look at that history and we can learn from it and we would do well tonight to do that to make sure that we're looking for him we're looking for the one who is to come and we're not looking for the condition that he would bring all right and that's really hard because we we want to get to a place where there's no sin we want to get to a place you know where our bodies don't hurt we want to get to a place where there's no tears how many want the messiah to come and do that but but why what makes that condition that condition everything that you're looking for in the millennium everything that you're looking for in the peace and rest that is to come to be the reward for the overcomer in the last days everything that you're looking for is fulfilled not because of him but in him amen not because he wills it or pushes all the problems out of the way but because he comes back the world must be that way scripture says no evil shall dwell with him so so when he when he comes you know he's coming into a heart that's cleansed by him when he comes back again and he sets his feet on the earth it will be after he has cleansed it again so so that's what we're looking for we're looking for him for him to come back so so we're in a sense though genesis 3 15 and in in a sense we can say that's been fulfilled yet we understand the coming of the messiah happens in two times so so we're looking for that that second time so there they are in the garden of eden and adam and eve you know how wonderful it is the fruit trees and you know there's the animals and they're all wonderful and you know anything they have need of it's great it's peaceful god comes down every evening fellowships with them i mean we'd love to be in this in this condition every single one of us you know so so there they are and then along comes the serpent and and beguiles eve and and deception comes and she's deceived she doesn't really understand what she's doing but she's she's deceived and and she gives to adam and you know okay here we are and now we have a fall right so so now we have a prophecy then that the messiah will come and smite the serpent and so so we can fixate on can't wait until that serpent is smitten the serpent did this to us we could we could have had all of this but we lost it because of this serpent and god said he'd send someone he'd come and he would smite the serpent and that there's not going to be sin anymore how many are looking forward to a time when there's no sin anymore like so that man i can't wait for the messiah to come to smite the serpent amen amen you know there's more to that of course you know but you you just stay with me as we play this out here you know so so so they lose these things they lose the plush garden they lose the cool streams and laying down beside the the lions they lose the fact that they had no sin they had no fears they didn't know time now they know time so they know fear they know anxiety and doubt and worry so they lost the peace that they had but but is that all that they lost did they only lose like oh the peace that i had and all the wonderful times or is there is there something else that they lost well we look in brother branham in many places i chose fellowship with god through reconciliation out of 1956 in the beginning when man used to walk in the early age with god in the garden of eden when the first man was created in the great cathedrals under the palms he and his wife with the cool of the evening come along they come out and worship god had a perfect fellowship god longs for fellowship he listened to this language he yearns he wants people to speak with him to talk with him you you might sing too much you might preach too much sometime but there's only one thing you'll never be able to overdo and that's pray now this isn't the kind of praying that's like lord help miss jones and you know put the quarter in the in the vending machine and lord i'm gonna stick like five quarters in because there's five things i need tonight so lord you take care of those things and keep me safe and wake me in the morning amen that's not fellowship that's requesting that's right now there's nothing wrong with that but there's more to prayer so the bible said i would that men pray everywhere lifting up holy hands you'll never be able to have too much fellowship with god god longs for his creature who he created in his image to fellowship with him wouldn't you have loved to have lived in the time when the great fellowship with god had with adam and eve in the garden of eden to come down in the cool of the evening and talk with them fellowship with them wouldn't that be marvelous we would all like to have that time now i believe by god's word and i can prove to you that we can come right back on them terms again with god tonight right straight back to that kind of fellowship so he also says in 1965 me not to thy own understanding eve which was no doubt an intelligent person well let me let me come back to that so so what we just read we god is yearning for fellowship right he yearns for look what did they lose in the garden of eden peace yes wonderful time yes they lost fellowship with god can you imagine the next evening adam outside the garden walking along thinking this is about the time that he used to cut him he's not here hallelujah how cheaply we give up that privilege in our daily lives how adam must have wept those first few evenings god you're not here it's not that i can't pray to you anymore but god i don't have the fellowship that i used to have adam lost that and eve lost that the greatest thing they could ever have because the source of peace the source of love the the reason the garden of eden was so amazing is because an amazing one took all of the qualities and attributes that were in him and created something and god saw it and it was good why was it good because he was so the expression of his character is put into his own creation till even he as he comes in the form of christ was the very expression and character of the heart of god and so we find in him that one that the characters that was him in the beginning and so here the garden of eden is so amazing because he made it that way and wouldn't you want to be with the one who has such quality in them to have created such a thing amen amen so so so they lose this fellowship with god and it must have been terrible but but for a moment we think so small sometimes and we think in terms of adam and eve how what they lost but for a moment did god lose anything on that day i want to read this quote to you again praise the lord wouldn't you have loved to live in that time the great fellowship with god had with adam and eve down in the garden of eden down in the cool of the evening talk with them fellowship with them when they had perfect fellowship god longs for fellowship he yearns there was a god who yearned to have fellowship with adam and eve and then adam and eve fell god lost the fellowship that he had with them you understand that god created you for fellowship to worship him to fellowship with him think about this for a moment god before he created everything was no less awesome than he is tonight he he he was he was awesomeness itself he was love embodied all that was holy all that was wonderful all that was cool all that was amazing whatever your adjective that i could never exhaust you come up with it he already was that but yet for some reason you would think man if i was that amazing do i need anyone else apparently i do because god was that amazing and it wasn't enough for him he said i want to express these things and have fellowship with someone to enjoy it with me so there they are in the garden of eden adam and eve walking in the cool of the day with god because god couldn't stay there wherever it was he was all day long but he yearned to have fellowship with those he created oh my he yearns church he yearns to have fellowship with you he created you for that you have purpose in your life because there's an amazing god who put you here to speak back to him there was a deep place within you that's now reaching out back to the deep that's there praise god for that so don't let the world get in the way of that because god is yearning for it [Applause] let's praise the lord to say i can't wait for you to come back jesus i can't wait till we can walk around in the millennium and have such fellowship jesus i am so looking forward to that but you never have that kind of prayer life now but yet we can come right back on them terms again with god tonight straight back to that kind of fellowship god is yearning for that the thing that adam and eve that the thing that had to hurt the most to lose was that fellowship the thing that hurt god the most was to lose that fellowship what a tragedy the loss of him not the loss of the condition the tragedy was the loss of him that he wasn't there with them any longer was the worst thing that happened to adam and eve that day what a tragedy it was now why did this happen eve which was no doubt an intelligent person the first right off of adam who was the son of god and eve certainly being in that spot when there had been no sin no place for sin she certainly must have had a wonderful conception of what god was this makes sense right we'll just slow down make take a moment i could use a few breaths okay she had a wonderful conception of what god was why she walked with him every day amen right you know after you've been married for 20 years you you you begin to understand the person you're married to you know you get smacked and you haven't said anything yet you know i mean i knew what you were thinking this doesn't happen to me i don't think have to anyway but you get to know one another you you understand when they're down when they're up how things are going you know it's true because you understand one another you have a conception of who they are and how they feel how they act you know eve has this with god himself because she walks with him she knows him because every afternoon she and her husband walked in the cool of the garden in the evening and talked face to face with god what an unreasonable thing that a person who would walk face to face with god and then would turn the reasoning of something that reasoned her turned to the reasoning of something that reasoned her away from the word of god so so so this is unreasonable because well if you reason away from the word of god it's just not really reasoning i mean it's certainly not sound reasoning anyway you know but here is it see see what that's doing is that's placing the idea of the intellectual like the intellectual faith in someone it replaces that for actually being with the person she knew he who he was she knew his character she had a great conception of that but the the serpent comes along and says well there's a few things you don't know you don't understand quite it's really this way and she went oh really is that why he's like he's that way well you know what she should have done and just been like huh well i'll see him [Applause] tonight sir oh let's take this home so when the devil comes to you and tries to tell you you've sinned your day of grace away you've done this you've done that you're not good enough you can't this god wouldn't that i'll see him tonight and i'll ask him because i'm on communication terms with him speaking with some young people the other day you know and well we we had some prayer line and and and brother nathan was advising some young people and things and you know when the devil's trying to get you to go this way brother branham says you just do the opposite you know when we begin and as the prayer line went on and different ones come by and and i begin to realize you know the importance you know look if you if we you know we we we understand look we read your bible and pray every day like this is it's just christianity right just knowing him someone looking for him to come well take what he's here and what you've got and so if you shun that like well are you looking for him to come it doesn't make sense so you know this is real church doesn't do his do's and don'ts is what i'm saying tonight but it's him that he's a person that you can know and we begin i begin to just think you know i understand read your bible pray look i want you to do it any time of the day and if the only time you can do it is in the in the evening that's fine but we begin to unders i just begin to think my you know if if we had a more concerted effort in the morning to lay before god and say god i know there's trials coming today i know i'm weak i know where i fail i know where the devil's gonna try to hit me except for those times when i don't know where he's gonna try to hit me and sometimes you know and then i have fallen before i realized i was hit lord and god i need you today and get into his atmosphere and get into his presence then maybe that would be much more of a deterrent to get the spirit of god around you to help you to get through your day [Music] and maybe that's just a sound principle and i'm not making a law or a doctrine or a you know you're not good enough if you don't do that but my how just a parent that came to me that if we had that maybe god you know we'd have a bit more strength in our daily walk yet through it all he loves you and wants fellowship with you so my you know so we we we want to be with him and not just have an intellectual conception of him so we want to get with him and say hey lord i'm struggling with this you know maybe there's something in the message i don't understand something in the word i don't understand well don't let that dissuade you get to know him and he'll reveal it to you you know i'll put you on the spot brother have you ever ever been wrong in your doctrine [Laughter] i mean i'm not saying major points now just like i have there's notes on the side of this bible that are crossed out now because i was like what was i thinking [Applause] i'm so glad that i've put the emphasis on knowing him rather than you know having my all my ducks in a row so their eve is his her great mistake is you know instead i'll ask him tonight she's like that's interesting tell me more and and now and now she's deceived and she falls and what is she deceived in she's deceived naughty and say hey you know um i think you should be bad i think you should uh disobey god it's not what the serpent said you know uh he came out preaching you know that's not god said well okay well we're having a spiritual discussion oh how wonderful well we could say a few things there but i'll just leave all of those things away anyway uh yeah be careful who you have those conversations with sometimes you know so she begins to have this conversation and as soon as she begins to have this conversation in her mind what's going on is she's looking at an intellectual conception an intellectual faith as substitute for the one who's coming that evening now that's crazy but yet we do it and it's easy to do and we begin to look at the word of god and we begin to take intellectual conceptions of the word of god and what god's going oh he said this and he's going to do this and he said this and he's going to do this and we create these great pictures and these great intellectual architectures and you know then we even try to help everyone else with our our architecture and you you know hey there's ways i teach things the same way every time because i feel like i this is what it does it for me i get it when i explain it this way and i think everybody ought to explain it my way why because it makes sense you know we have the the uh what was my acronym uh the mwti that's the message witnessing um technical institute you know training institute i think is what it was you know if you all come to the mwti and you know learn how to present the message together we'll have more message believers because it just works it's crazy right like that's how the world thinks that's how the devil would like to get us to think you know it didn't seem like when i was like well i do it this way and it makes sense to me and why wouldn't that benefit others well all of those things make sense like but yet if you take that too far like suddenly you've messed up the whole picture because now it's become about how you do it instead of who yes sir so so eve chooses an intellectual conception a knowledge of god that's given to her by someone else instead of knowing him and i'm so glad i am so glad that god sent us a prophet today because god knew that the church the condition of when the serpent came to the gentile church and and began to deceive the gentile church god knew that there would have to come some restoration and that restoration was not to take us into a better understanding than what the serpent had or the correct understanding but it was to say that he is here and if he's here if he's here then know him look for him not what he will do not how he will do not why he will do i don't care about the dew may i just be with you [Music] so sin enters in the tragedy of separation from god but yet through that through that tragedy god's plan is unfolding to make himself known in his fullness not understood but known in his fullness he wanted to be known so he said here i'm coming back to do this thing i am known as the one who smites the serpent and who's gonna make and take away the sin so praise god that he smites the serpent and he takes away sin but i'm not happy to just have that done for me i want to know the one that's that awesome and i want to be with him so so the character of this prophecy look it's not enough that eve had sinned and needed forgiveness she needed restoration but restoration to sinlessness is the idea that we get well we were sinners now we'll be sinless problem solved no you missed that they were missing the fellowship to be sinless that's great but to be sinless without him you could live the rest of your day sinless but never have him you can have it i want him does she just need forgiveness so she'll feel better about you know messing up she just need forgiveness so that she can one day return to a joyous luscious garden yes she needs forgiveness for all of these things but that's not the main point that's not the character of the prophecy of why the serpent would be smitten the serpent is smitten to restore the fellowship not the garden condition the fellowship so god lost the fellowship that he desired we lost the fellowship we desired and somehow along the way all of the prophecies of coming messiah are about us just being better somehow christianity has just become about us needing to be forgiven somehow the message coming has just become about needing to you know understand the doctrines right about how the word is given to you about who gave it to you about all of these things and we missed the point though all of those things are wonderful and they're there but they should look if you understand every seal that was you know that was revealed and you understand thunders but it hasn't drawn you closer to christ you haven't understood anything brother branham said in the third seal the word would come to her speaking of eve for redemption what did eve need to be redeemed back to not just sinlessness redeemed back to fellowship being restored so if your doctrines aren't bringing you back to fellowship with him something is wrong and you've missed the picture and he's going to come back and you're going to be looking for something he's like well wait no it's got to all be this way or it can't be him i want to be so close to him that even if it comes in a different way than my mind thinks i'll be like well i thought it was this way but that's him [Applause] a return to the person contending for the faith i have nothing against seminaries students monasteries and um mwti's and so forth oh i added that little part but all of that they'll never know god it's only knowing catechism and so forth like that to know god forgive him i made that too light but to know god is to know the person amen christ himself and to know him is life not to know your textbook to know your creed to know your catechism isn't life to know christ the person is life eternal and that's what we wish to know amen amen so this prophecy comes and it explodes onto the scene that he would come again though you've just sinned he the one he's coming you can look for me i will be coming why what is the what is what is the obviousness if we put ourselves into their shoes on that day they don't even recognize yet the effects even of their sin when this prophecy goes forth they're standing my understanding of it at least you know they're standing in the garden of eden what have you done who told you you were naked because you've done this thing you're gonna scratch the ground and you know you're gonna do all of these things and and pain you know and but it but but the seed is coming to smite the seed of the serpent they're like oh my goodness like this is so much but he's saying i'm gonna i'm gonna smite him to restore you what would be their first thought because i'm sending you out but don't worry i will come to restore their obvious thought would be because they just don't even get their own sin yet their obvious thought would be wait you mean we're never gonna be with you again but yo thank you you're gonna send you're gonna come and restore our fellowship not our sinlessness when jesus came and died on a cross he smote the serpent he smote the effects of sin he took care of the penalty of sin if you claim that you stand justified before his presence as if you've never done it and yet we spend so much time obsessing over it poking the rattlesnake poke poke like i don't want to sin again i don't want to sin again i don't want to say well stop paying attention to the rattlesnake and put your mind on him so the prophecy comes forth that that would be there would be restoration and it would be restoration to fellowship so then god comes and he tells us in genesis 49 that the scepter wouldn't depart from judah there were a law giver from between his feet until shiloh come the messiah shiloh peace is going to come because at that time by genesis 49 there was a lot of no peace going around and shiloh was going to come now so he begins to build a picture of who he's going to be and then as we go through the old testament we find prophecy after prophecy after prophecy unfolding further and further the same revelation that's here in genesis 3 15 but there's more color if you will added to it there's more understanding there's more character what's the character of of the prophecy that says i'm restoring fellowship and so you begin to understand he's going to come and be peace we need that we had that with you i'm going to come and be king of kings well hey you were back then you were king of us and adam was the ruler over the earth and he was king over him till isaiah 9 and 6 think of this verse as an expression of the character of the further character of this original prophecy in genesis 3 15 that the seed of the woman would come right think think of it just for a moment think of it through that lens that this is adding character to that original prophecy isaiah 9 and 6 for unto us a child is born now i can stop right there i'll finish the verse but i want to focus on that point because that's instructive to us unto us a son is given the government shall be upon his shoulder okay so now all of a sudden we're like ooh government on his shoulder you have big broad shoulders okay he's gonna rule things uh he should be called wonderful oh yeah he's great he's gonna be counselor he'll teach us the mighty god that's the one the everlasting father and the prince of peace the one we can hold on to and he's there always for us he'll be the prince of peace and it's going to be amazing and and so we begin to think about all those last things and all those last things like yeah that's the that's the one who's coming and then it's like wait and so then it's like but unto us a son is given and a child is born a son is given and we think well that's just how he's coming right that's just how he's kind of sick he's just gonna come as a baby like this some like so that's how and this is who no the whole thing is who that that he would come like why did you have you thought about before why does god choose to come to fulfill this original prophecy and hundreds of prophecies throughout the old testament he chooses to fulfill to come as coming as a baby why why didn't he just come like he could have come at 12 he could have come at 30 he could have come at 20 like he could have come at any point in time like he didn't you know i mean except for the fact that it was the seed of the woman so well okay there's that but you know so he had to come and be virgin born but he but there's a but there's there's character in that even as he comes as a baby well how did you come oh you came as a baby and you grew and you strengthened and you learned and you you were brought under discipline to train you [Music] guess what you have a god an almighty god that came and expressed his character and that he said a baby would come a son would be born and given just like you were because now i'm gonna experience what you go through so it's not look look i i'm you know what i i'm doing i am coming as a baby to deepen my fellowship with you because now i know what it's like to be you [Applause] you see the character of these prophecies expressing who he is and stopping and dwelling on those for a moment to understand that god you yearned for fellowship like that's one thing but no you yearned for fellowship so much to express yourself so fully and you did all of that but yet at the same time you came in and in a sense came as something that you weren't you weren't a baby ever so you chose to come as a baby because that's how we come so that you could know us more [Applause] and in the same time we got to know him more because we got to see his expression lived the expression of his character that jesus was the very heart of god and how god would walk on this earth was so instructive to us and we could see his heart lived out as a human but more than just that he was living as a human to be like you to strengthen his fellowship with you [Music] he was tempted in all points like as we are yet without sin he knows what you're going through he knows what it's like to be you you say no brothers too far get him get rid of him send us another preacher like i no he doesn't know what it's like to be me because he didn't sit he was tempted just like you were sir he knows what you face he's been tempted to have self-pity anybody ever have self-pity my you know i never knew i mean i never knew what temptation was until until i found out about self-pity like you have a bulging disc in your back sometime and and be in pain from that probably some people here have done that you know and you just lying there going this hurts all right god why is this hurt like i don't man it just hurts and i it's not fear god and like man you know and then you try claiming your healings like no he said i'm healed i'm healed that's what the word says that's what we're believing but i hurt man i just want to lie here and um because i feel better just being man it's not fear nobody it's so much harder to say no i don't care that that the promise is more real than my pain that's that's hard because you're tempted to sit there and go [Music] and that's just a little recent experience that i had god knows he knows what it's like everything that you go through he already knows don't don't think you're so disconnected from you're not disconnected from him he's a god of love and he's not just way out there but he's a god that said i'm going to come and i'm going to express myself just like you i'm going to know what it's like to be you why because i want to know you i want you to know me i want to have a wonderful beautiful fellowship together but he doesn't want fellowship with me i'm such a sinner that's not what he said that's not what he did amen don't let the devil tell you about that don't let the devil tell you he doesn't want you you're not good enough he died he came as a baby to be like you then die so that he could redeem you from that to bring you back to fellowship he's done everything that needs doing you just need to accept it believe it and come to him so let's do that church oh but instead you know well the god sent us a prophet and i don't mean to mock this too bad but you know like i believe that god sent us a prophet we needed that again we needed that restoration because we were just going to be in church members without a prophet coming we're just going to be church members well now prophet came and we're just church members in a different thing come out of her my people into not into the same thing that's not coming out church no come out of those that church come out of the doctrinal understanding come out of the eve's you know thinking system and come back to the fellowship i restored with you i will send you the holy spirit that will come and dwell in you and teach you and reveal you to the word and so god sent us a prophet for redemption with the word because the word comes for redemption so he sent us a prophet now now don't misunderstand me i'm not saying that this he's jesus christ and because jesus christ died for your sins but there was a redemption when eve was deceived there had to be a redemption for the deception and in our day we've had a deception come throughout all of these church ages but god has restored it brought us the word again to to bring us back in redemption because there was a deception there but what's the point of redemption what are we being redeemed to brought back into fellowship amen but yet we pride ourselves so often on you know well brother you understand this of course this thing in this thing you don't get that wait you don't you don't church the way i church brother you come with me he will leave him i eve better than he does i mean did you hear that because like that's that's literally the translation when we say my my understanding is better than your understanding so do it my way you're really truly saying i eve better than you do now again not downplaying understanding the word study to show yourself approved amen but those things bring you to him to the person to the one that's the point of our redemption of our restoration is to bring us back to him so why does he come as a child if he's just to deliver us from sin he comes as a deliverer but he comes as a baby because there's more there than just deliverance from sin there's a fellowship he wants with you an identification that he wants with you so we'll try to bring this down to a close now the message is it is i now notice when jesus came he performed that sign that musicians can come man i sure hope that clock isn't right oh good it's not woo glory whoo now notice when jesus came he performed that sign as the messianic sign before the jews now the gentiles we we the anglo-saxon we were not looking for any messiah he only comes to those who's looking for him he will only heal those tonight that believe they're going to be healed you will only save those who's got faith to be saved in he will only fill with the spirit those who are looking for the holy spirit when he comes to the earth again he will come to those who are waiting for him to come looking for him to come prepared for him to come now there were a lot of religious people in the day that jesus came but and and they all said they were looking for a messiah to come but they weren't looking for a messiah to come they were looking for a messiah to come to do this that or the other messiah himself wasn't enough in whatever way he chose to come in whatever spirit he chose to come in he had to do certain things for them because there was a condition that they were looking for not him now again please don't misunderstand me i don't throw away the word of god and say just find the person and just love him not i'm not doing that all of the word comes to reveal him all of the word is precious because it's his word that's right and and we glory that god had sent us to it and opened our eyes and given us revelation because it reveals him but he is the point that's right so i want to make sure i look back at history and what the jews were doing and how they missed it and i want to say god i want to be like simeon i want to be like anna i want to be looking for him though he could come even as a babe that i'm not expecting to the temple of god but yet i know that it's him because i have a connection with him though that doesn't un make my my my understanding of all scriptures fit all the message fit i'm human so in the intellectual so much god i don't want to just be there and be right and be righter than everybody else and be the most lord make me the most right person so that you'll come for me and it's like you know i'll update this to some of the young people language like there's no meme where anyone ever said lord make me the most rightest person so so you can come back for me and then the little tagline said no one ever no no it's like said almost everyone ever we do this we get our eyes on all the stuff and off of him and we've done it for far too long church let the word of god as you read the word of god find lord reveal to me you in all of these things draw me closer to you in all of these things he comes to the earth again he will come to those who are waiting for him to come looking for him to come prepared for him to come another place he cared came in the power of the scripture exactly the interpretation of the scripture but the people of that day that was looking for him to come missed him because they had an interpretation that they could not go from that interpretation they must have it their way and i'll just be honest enough to say god i don't want it my way i have as much as anyone a way i think it's all gonna happen and i think that it's righter than your way i honestly and truly do we'll just be honest you you forgive me that's how i feel but i know that that's not right i should have no confidence in that because i'm just human and i just want to be restored to him i don't want to serve him so much that i'm not with him i don't want to study so much that i don't see him i don't want to i don't wanna message so much that i miss him it's him church so let's get to know him not consider how he's coming if he's coming when he's coming what he will do but just to consider and to look for him the one since genesis 3 15 the one who has been looked for for all time let us not stop looking for him can we bow our hats heavenly father lord i know that i i have preached about this i've preached about this for some time lord but still recognize how bad i am at it lord how easy i am to get distracted and to not make it about just being with you father though i do want to be right i want to be correct i want to enjoy the doctrine that you've given to us but lord i don't want to forget the purpose behind it lord i pray that the your spirit would just be here lord and that just for a moment as we worship lord and was we just let the the atmosphere of the music lord jesus come and father i pray that you would just let your spirit take these words and and may each heart consider lord jesus where they have looked for you and where they have gotten off on the things lord and may we recommit ourselves and rededicate ourselves afresh tonight to to seek after you after the person to know you lord you did so much lord for our fellowship lord [Music] i want to give it back to you lord i want to i want you to receive the reward that you purchased oh god [Music] come and have your way lord jesus what else can we say father but just lord be here let the words end now lord and and may your spirit come and fellowship with each individual tonight

earlier i will praise the lord i will praise the lord amen let's stand together oh my how many of you enjoyed the word of the lord tonight oh my god oh my thank you lord jesus praise the name of the

exactly why for i can't explain with tongue or pin the spirit's groanings deep within it must be god here in my soul [Music] [Music] that's it that's me [Music] lord please come and take control i feel the poor [Music] i wait to hear the [Music] [Applause] [Music] he was drawing me to give a higher praise [Music] [Applause] me and i know for sure that i'll reach the goal because i feel the poor

in the spirit [Music] beholding his face oh there i'm gay new power to run in the race how i long to be shutting with god [Music] i believe the lord spoke real personal to us tonight [Music] brother trevor you and i didn't speak i haven't he doesn't know we haven't talked at all but how we're under the same thread the same leading of the lord you see it all comes back to that as god brought that that theme over and over it's fellowship with him there's things that my wife if you ask her right now what are certain places would brother sammy would he like this she could tell you right now you could go to her again she could tell you he wouldn't like that now she'd probably be nice to you and kind too but she could tell you he won't get excited about that kind of pie because he doesn't like it or he don't like this kind of food or this or that you know why she knows me now that just didn't happen by us living in the same house we have fellowship she knows the things that i like the things that i don't like that's the same thing with the fellowship between the lord jesus and us as a husband and a wife we know the things that he likes and he doesn't like and our desire is to please him but it all comes back to is fellowship i think to me it was just it was so tremendous and i don't just say that we don't the thing of this service tonight and any other service we just don't want to say it's tremendous and come and and leave out of here but to recognize what god has let you and i know it's like i talked about on sunday what's on the key fob you've got auto start and you've been carrying it around all the time but it's to use it use it it's fellowship to enter into fellowship with almighty god things are changed in fellowship with him i think it's just tremendous that we look at to see how we're the jews and how all these things and even as the lord brought it through brother trevor even if sometimes we're getting in to look at conditions you've heard me just you've heard me say from the pulpit before sometimes you can meet a person and they're bound with this or bound with that and ask why do you want to be free well i want to be a better husband you know that all happened but if that's the only reason you're missing the main thing it's him that's why we repent that's why we've been baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and it's about him daily walking daily with him i think it's just so it's tremendous because it's not the focus isn't on the conditions and all the you can have all the doctrines you can know all the words know how to pronounce them know all those things and all those hat it all has its place but if it doesn't draw us closer to him so we're saying how could that be known if a person if you can't recognize him speaking then it's not drawing you closer to him but everything when it draws you closer to him you become more like him you become more of the the opium of the lily of the valley wow you've got that aroma just it's of his presence that's what we desire in our life [Music] that's that's the very thing and that think about it how brother trevor just took that quote tonight and placed that not only do we desire we can say i desire that he desires it he desires it he loves to hear our voice song of solomon 2 14 o my dove thou that are at the cleft of the rock in the secret places of the stairs oh let me hear thy voice let me see thy countenance oh my think of it he stops the angels when you begin to speak and it's not just it's not just church it's not just in church it's every day every moment what a privilege that we've been brought back into to have fellowship with him to have fellowship with him i tell you i could say it like this i want more i want more i want it deepened i want it deepened i want it deepened amen let's just go before the lord just with a [Music] heavenly father lord i know i say this to you an awful lot but i thank you lord jesus thank you lord god for this word tonight lord thank you father for ministering to our hearts lord i you called to our hearts into our lives tonight lord you spoke to us lord once again [Music] lord i thought that was just i don't know there's just so many points within it so many things that you spoke to our hearts i think of over and over and lord how your prophet would come around and it said we're not waiting on the millennium to come to be sons and daughters of god we are now then we look at the privileges what what what is now what does that mean it means to be restored back to fellowship we're not waiting on
