[35:28] [Music]
[35:31] Heavenly Father
[35:34] or Jesus beneath every hand Lord
[35:38] you see our hearts father you know Lord
[35:43] the false everything Lord concerning us
[35:47] you know Lord as David said our down
[35:50] City and our uprising you know every
[35:54] part about our lives it's not just
[35:56] something but more that you are
[35:58] presently learning and you already knew
[36:01] about it before we ourselves were ever
[36:04] Express Lord in this time and in this
[36:06] hour you already knew your God how that
[36:11] you have provided for us as you have for
[36:13] every one of your children more just
[36:16] exactly what we have needed nor Jesus we
[36:20] turn our hearts Lord in our our focus to
[36:23] you this is evil father you know Lord
[36:26] what we have neither than you know just
[36:28] how to say it Lord and to speak to our
[36:32] hearts so father we would ask Lord as
[36:35] speaker and here together we want to
[36:37] just reserve and give ourselves only to
[36:40] you know that father to be a vessel that
[36:43] you would speak and hear through law of
[36:46] God we we want we desire that you would
[36:48] just work in a in a very special way in
[36:51] our hearts in our lives tonight boy
[36:53] father you know each and every need Lord
[36:55] and your God we just ask that you would
[36:57] just Lord take your word and break it to
[37:00] our hearts Lord father say what needs to
[37:03] be said Lord and father may you come
[37:05] tonight and just the Lord confirming
[37:07] your word to each of our hearts Lord by
[37:09] your presence Lord Lord we give
[37:12] ourselves to you Lord from this day Lord
[37:14] just setting aside from this life Lord
[37:17] for a few moments Lord just to be able
[37:19] order to be in your presence Lord and
[37:22] father to be able to feed from You Lord
[37:24] and hear from you Lauren we have need of
[37:27] you Lord this morning
[37:28] this evening rather help us now father I
[37:31] pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[37:37] god bless you this evening a man if we
[37:40] could turn to first Peter chapter 1
[37:43] certainly good to be back home and just
[37:46] appreciate your your prayers while we
[37:49] were we were away there and what was
[37:53] certainly merciful to us within those
[37:55] services and I feel like that I'm still
[37:59] trying to get strength back we had four
[38:03] straight services there and in that time
[38:07] so you know sometimes you start
[38:09] realizing in your body what you're able
[38:11] to do and what you're not able to do but
[38:14] God is faithful you know I appreciate
[38:21] [Applause]
[38:29] just you know we look at everything
[38:33] where we're at you know in this moment
[38:35] you know just yesterday Reverend Billy
[38:40] Graham that passed on you know I just my
[38:44] heart when I had heard of it I know
[38:46] there's you know been a lot of different
[38:48] things that you know has been said no
[38:51] doubt but I always go back to the
[38:54] message warning before judgment in 63
[38:57] and brother ban referred to Billy Graham
[38:59] he filled the Oral Roberts and referred
[39:02] to the ministry that God had given him
[39:04] and brother brems says they are messages
[39:07] of the hour one message he said of
[39:11] repentance he said God confirms that the
[39:14] other message he said of divine healing
[39:16] my Horrell Roberts God confirms that and
[39:19] he said in the message that God has
[39:21] given us God's confirming it by drawing
[39:24] the bride together
[39:26] so it all serves its purpose brother
[39:28] bran will also say it in another way and
[39:30] because when you think of it you think
[39:32] we'll Billy Graham's off the scene but
[39:33] remember the message itself that started
[39:36] within each one of those parts just as
[39:39] the message itself but the man himself
[39:40] the angel being off the scene but yet
[39:43] that message is going to continue to
[39:45] Proclamation it's going to achieve what
[39:47] God sent for to achieve so it's the same
[39:50] way with Billy Graham's message same way
[39:52] with Oral Roberts message as a matter of
[39:54] fact many times you'll find brother
[39:55] brand will actually call even Jack
[39:57] Schuler one of those angels going down
[39:59] there so what we're looking at is that
[40:01] that message is going to continue to go
[40:03] on and you know when you think of it
[40:05] there's things that sometimes we come
[40:07] across others who they they'll never see
[40:11] what God has by His grace open to us and
[40:14] he certainly didn't open it to us
[40:16] because we were smarter or better than
[40:18] anybody else you know as a matter of
[40:19] fact God made it real clear to Israel in
[40:21] Deuteronomy he said God did not give
[40:23] this to you he said because you were
[40:25] some sort of a special people above
[40:28] everybody else he said that God has done
[40:30] this because he made a promise to your
[40:32] fathers and that's why God has come in
[40:35] this hour God made a promise in his word
[40:37] and God came to fulfill that word and
[40:40] when you think of it you know when we we
[40:42] look at all of these parts that are
[40:45] there you think of how that you know for
[40:47] them tells us that this message he said
[40:49] it's not to go out there and hit these
[40:51] big nerve centers he said it's not a
[40:54] very saint he said it very plainly he
[40:55] said it's not their food and but the
[40:59] thing of it is the way that I've always
[41:00] looked at it like this and and that is
[41:03] that you know on my testimony your
[41:06] testimony the way that we live it may
[41:08] not draw somebody and everybody into
[41:12] that of where their eyes are open and
[41:14] knowing that they're a part of the bride
[41:15] but it might be our testimony that could
[41:18] really stir someone to say you know what
[41:19] I need to say we don't know the category
[41:23] we don't determine that that's already
[41:26] determined by God but only we can do is
[41:30] shine the light in that wonderful said
[41:33] it many times I'd rather you know if I
[41:36] have a choice I'd rather fellowship with
[41:37] maybe there be others that
[41:39] you know on the job in different places
[41:40] maybe we can't fellowship about the
[41:43] revealed truth of what God has given to
[41:45] us
[41:45] but if if all they know is a savior I'll
[41:48] shout with you on salvation
[41:49] oh yeah I'll shout with the own
[41:51] salvation brother branham said it many
[41:53] times he said my oneness here on this
[41:56] side and my Trinitarians over here he
[41:58] said the Brethren tonight let's weave
[42:00] our nets together and let's make a great
[42:03] cast you see the net itself doesn't make
[42:07] a salmon the salmon it's already a
[42:08] salmon all the net does is pull and
[42:11] bring in what needs to be brought in so
[42:14] any wonderful weekend just that that's
[42:16] the whole part the whole gospel is
[42:18] resting in him it doesn't mean that we
[42:20] don't do anything but we leave all the
[42:22] results to him let us just live our life
[42:24] let our light shine where we're at and
[42:25] commit all the results to him so I
[42:27] certainly think all for brother Billy
[42:30] Graham's life and really I really think
[42:34] God for that the testimony and the life
[42:36] that he lived so let's turn here to the
[42:40] word you're already there 1st Peter 1
[42:42] verse 3 blessed be the God and father of
[42:47] our Lord Jesus Christ which according to
[42:50] his abundant mercy has begotten us again
[42:53] unto a lively hope by the resurrection
[42:56] of Jesus from the dead to an inheritance
[42:59] incorruptible and undefiled that fadeth
[43:03] not away reserved in heaven for you who
[43:07] are kept by the power of God through
[43:10] faith unto salvation ready to be
[43:14] revealed in the last time may God bless
[43:17] you as you're being seated we'll just
[43:19] continue to read that portion of the
[43:20] word I don't want to keep you standing
[43:30] wherein you greatly rejoice souls are
[43:33] rejoicing is in our Redemption we've
[43:38] received the first fruits of that the
[43:41] down payment the deposit and that's what
[43:43] that's where our rejoicing is that our
[43:46] rejoicing is not in the circumstances
[43:49] and the conditions of life there's not a
[43:52] one of us here that doesn't like to have
[43:56] it at times where times where we can
[43:58] seemingly rest or relax or don't have
[44:02] things on our mind every one of us like
[44:04] those times but yet we we also know that
[44:08] within it the real true rejoicing that
[44:11] we have even when you think about it and
[44:13] coming to the house of God our rejoicing
[44:16] is not dependent upon really what's
[44:19] going on in our life think about how
[44:21] many times I want you to think it like
[44:23] think about it like this how many times
[44:25] that you know you can think of a
[44:27] situation and we don't know sitting here
[44:29] tonight what everybody is either going
[44:31] through or or or has been through or
[44:33] just come out of but nonetheless we know
[44:36] that we we all are tried and we all are
[44:38] tested but to be able to come in here to
[44:41] a place and be able to you know lay
[44:43] aside our thoughts and be able to enter
[44:45] in it to worship the Lord we know beyond
[44:48] a shadow of a doubt that there are lives
[44:49] and hearts maybe you're one that tonight
[44:51] if it went by how you felt you would
[44:54] have never raised your hands if it went
[44:57] by how you felt you you would have never
[44:58] entered into the song service you you
[45:01] just would have never entered into
[45:02] worship but there's a part about it that
[45:04] you did not allow circumstances to keep
[45:06] you back and and you begin to realize
[45:08] the value of that as a believer you
[45:10] realize that there are times that it's
[45:12] not that we're putting on but we simply
[45:15] worship because he's worthy of all
[45:18] praise and and we're not going to allow
[45:20] our feelings to just dictate to us or
[45:22] our thoughts or we're not going to allow
[45:24] that we we know that God's Word is true
[45:27] and we know that he's faithful to his
[45:29] word and and he's worthy and so when we
[45:32] look at this he's we see that as the
[45:34] scripture said that wherein we greatly
[45:36] rejoice because we know that this life
[45:39] this is just a temporary passing we're
[45:42] just simply passing
[45:43] through here even like when Israel was
[45:45] going through the wilderness that was
[45:47] just temporary that was not the finality
[45:49] that was just temporary but here Peter
[45:52] would pick this up by by the unction of
[45:54] the Holy Spirit and say wherein you
[45:56] greatly rejoice though now for a season
[46:00] if need be ye are in heaviness through
[46:04] manifold temptations that the trial of
[46:09] your faith this is the purpose that the
[46:11] trial of your faith being much more
[46:13] precious than of gold that perishes
[46:17] though it be tried with fire might be
[46:20] found unto praise and honor and glory at
[46:23] the appearing of Jesus Christ
[46:26] booming at whom having not seen ye love
[46:29] in whom though now you see him not yet
[46:33] believing he rejoiced with joy
[46:36] unspeakable and full of glory receiving
[46:40] the end of your faith even the salvation
[46:42] of your souls
[46:44] so within just this little bit that
[46:46] we've read here tonight we can see that
[46:48] the real rejoicing and the glory where
[46:51] in the scripture speak of our tests and
[46:54] our trials is not a rejoicing in the
[46:57] test or the trial itself but our
[46:59] rejoicing comes with we know that our
[47:02] destiny is certain well we don't know
[47:05] what all that's happening we don't know
[47:07] everything that's gonna come out of the
[47:09] trial but we know that God he does not
[47:12] permit a trial it's not something of
[47:15] just a confusion but it's it's very
[47:18] divinely calculated and and Satan can't
[47:21] do anything he can't touch us unless God
[47:24] permits it to come and God will allow
[47:26] him to to come to a certain measure and
[47:28] as the scripture says for a season it's
[47:31] for a period of time but yet within it
[47:34] all there's an accomplishment there's an
[47:36] achievement there's something that God
[47:38] is desiring to bring out of our life so
[47:41] within it we are rejoicing is not of
[47:44] what we know about the trial because the
[47:46] truth be known as we're going through
[47:48] the tests and trials we don't know how
[47:51] things are gonna come out many times we
[47:53] don't know how it's all gonna work
[47:55] we don't know that but we what we're
[47:57] comfort is is that he's with us and when
[48:00] it's all said and done I'm gonna be with
[48:03] him that's that's that's where my rest
[48:05] is and that's where my rejoicing is like
[48:08] when a person who could say how can you
[48:09] be happy yet you as a person might be
[48:12] setting in the midst of a situation and
[48:14] you may not have a smile on your face
[48:16] but yet you have consolation within
[48:18] because as the scripture did say here
[48:21] that you are in through you are in with
[48:24] with heaviness though for a season that
[48:26] heaviness means that word means great
[48:29] sorrow or great sadness so you can
[48:32] experience that it's not talking about
[48:34] maybe where your face itself is just
[48:36] illuminate with a smile but yet in the
[48:38] midst of it beyond but in the depth of
[48:41] it there is a great consolation that I
[48:44] am complete assurance that God is gonna
[48:47] bring me through and not just bringing
[48:49] me through but my final destination I
[48:53] have a place reserved on the other side
[48:56] I've got a place reserved in that
[48:59] wonderful you know many went through
[49:05] many great things if we just look at it
[49:07] in some of the natural things when you
[49:09] think about how that you know there's a
[49:11] lot to go into of a story behind what we
[49:14] look at the Pilgrims and them coming
[49:16] here there's a lot within that of where
[49:17] it had to go and where they had to
[49:20] journey to and how many times they were
[49:21] actually caught and the different things
[49:24] that actually took place but what was it
[49:26] that kept them moving to that place and
[49:28] and to where that they were willing to
[49:30] risk and put their lives on the line to
[49:32] even journey across in a ship in that in
[49:35] that way what was it it was the promise
[49:37] of Liberty and and that that's really
[49:40] where it is with us in our lives what
[49:42] was it that would cause the different
[49:44] ones through the Underground Railroad
[49:45] and the different the slaves when they
[49:47] were coming through and different ones
[49:49] that would lead them through
[49:50] courageously what was it what was it
[49:52] that would keep them going through the
[49:54] the moonlit and the starlit night what
[49:56] is it that would keep them looking for
[49:58] what side of the tree had the moss on it
[50:00] what is it that would keep them looking
[50:02] for houses and lanterns in the window
[50:04] what was that it was a promise of
[50:06] freedom and
[50:07] this itself was a pathway that LLL NAT
[50:11] the end of this pathway there was
[50:13] Liberty so here they were they were
[50:16] actually they were walking free but yet
[50:18] there was a promise of a greater Liberty
[50:20] than what they knew at that time and
[50:22] that's the same way that it is for us as
[50:25] believers we're walking in Liberty now
[50:27] but we're walking to that place where we
[50:30] shall be delivered into the love divine
[50:34] so this is where that what is taking
[50:37] place in our life the tests and the
[50:40] trials that we go through in them you
[50:42] know as we we've said it that we're
[50:44] either in a trial
[50:45] we're either coming out of a trial or
[50:47] we're getting ready to go into one don't
[50:51] mean to encourage you tonight but it's
[50:54] true it's true this is where that Peter
[50:58] would pick it up again at first Peter
[51:00] chapter 4 verse 12 beloved think it not
[51:03] strange concerning the fiery trial which
[51:07] is to try you as though some strange
[51:09] thing happened unto you but rejoice in
[51:14] as much as ye are partakers of Christ's
[51:16] suffering that when his glory shall be
[51:20] revealed you may be glad also with
[51:22] exceeding joy so once again our
[51:25] rejoicing is not tied to the
[51:27] circumstances it's tied to him in whom
[51:31] our soul has United with and to know
[51:34] that when it all said and done that and
[51:37] when his glory shall be revealed we may
[51:40] be glad with exceeding joy you talking
[51:42] about when that morning comes that
[51:45] moment of the rapture comes you talking
[51:47] about when we set there at the wedding
[51:49] supper of the Lamb oh you think it's
[51:52] hard to get people together now but then
[51:54] pray and say hey we're gonna pray over
[51:56] the food why don't y'all just stop
[51:57] fellowship and for a moment there's
[51:59] gonna be when when think about it
[52:01] friends the Prophet tells us here that
[52:03] then thirty to forty days upon the earth
[52:05] that scriptural you know that in the
[52:08] book of Acts it says they were here
[52:10] after his resurrection he was with them
[52:12] for forty days upon the earth and here
[52:14] they were gathered it was a group of
[52:16] people Abraham Sarah and all the rest of
[52:19] them that were apart
[52:19] that promise and here they were and and
[52:22] and there was nothing that the devil
[52:23] could do to think about it when we get
[52:25] there in that moment of time to wear
[52:27] that here we are saying blessed be the
[52:30] name of the Lord it's over it's over
[52:33] it's over testing is over we made it
[52:37] brother
[52:38] we made a sister thank you Oh God
[52:43] hallelujah and the public said he allows
[52:46] that time because he knows we as humans
[52:49] is what he said he knows we as humans
[52:51] would beginning our eyes on all of that
[52:54] but he says he allows that time that we
[52:56] have there that all of a sudden after we
[52:58] here in our time of rejoicing here he
[53:01] himself descends and then all attention
[53:04] goes to him it will be worth it all when
[53:10] we see Jesus not only are the trials of
[53:14] this life will seem so small good-o
[53:20] repeated on this fire the same word fire
[53:23] and fiery from the first part that we
[53:25] read the fire this to try you the fiery
[53:27] trial which is to try this word it means
[53:30] it's the burning by which metals are
[53:33] roasted and reduced which we were
[53:35] looking at that by a figure drawn from a
[53:38] refiners fire calamities or trials that
[53:41] test the character Brooke Graham tells
[53:46] us in Hebrews chapter four in that
[53:48] series
[53:49] he says you mustn't question anything to
[53:54] God now we want to get the benefits
[53:57] knowing we whatever the test or the
[54:00] trial we want to receive full benefits
[54:02] of it you mustn't question anything to
[54:09] God I'm not gonna ask for your hands
[54:10] tonight because every one of us have if
[54:14] I had time tonight to go through it in
[54:16] the book of Job of things and you know
[54:18] when you see it even where Joel himself
[54:20] is questioning things he's questioning
[54:23] all of this but to see it all but see
[54:26] God allows those things God doesn't we
[54:28] don't we don't come in to enter into
[54:30] this and and we're just perfect people
[54:33] that
[54:33] we're not questioning anything but you
[54:35] see this is counsel from our life this
[54:37] word that's spoken here you mustn't
[54:39] question anything to God this is not
[54:41] condemnation this is leadership we see
[54:45] the word that is come in this hour this
[54:47] is leadership glory be to God for the
[54:51] footsteps of the righteous is ordered of
[54:53] the Lord and every trial is put upon you
[54:56] to prove you and the Bible said they're
[54:58] more precious to you than gold so if God
[55:00] let a few light afflictions happen to
[55:03] you remember it's for the correction of
[55:06] you boy we need it we need it every son
[55:12] that cometh to God must first be
[55:15] chastened of God and tried and child
[55:17] trained there's no exception every son
[55:20] that cometh so not only do we have in
[55:24] the entry stages of where God is drawing
[55:27] a person to himself but even after the
[55:30] person has come to a place of a complete
[55:33] experience with God the chastening the
[55:35] trying the trials they don't stop it
[55:38] continues on because it's moving then to
[55:41] mold and shape a character now look at
[55:44] this here he says these afflictions are
[55:47] done or brought about to see what
[55:51] attitude you'll take that's one thing
[55:58] that we need our help we need help on
[56:02] our attitude I don't have time to deal
[56:04] with this either tonight but we need
[56:06] help with that and you just to take
[56:07] comfort in the scripture that there are
[56:09] many others who had an attitude but see
[56:15] God came and dealt with them you know
[56:18] one thing I love about it is God will
[56:20] not allow any worship to go to man God
[56:24] will absolutely reduce it so that our
[56:26] confidence is not in the man that our
[56:29] confidence is in God God could have hid
[56:32] all these things he could have he could
[56:35] have made this a book of man a book of
[56:37] man highlights man but the book of God
[56:39] highlights God it shows the weakness the
[56:43] infirmities of man
[56:45] by what god is highlighting without him
[56:49] we cannot do anything to see what
[56:52] attitude you'll take it's God on this
[56:54] proving ground that's all earth is is
[56:57] the proving grounds and where he's
[56:59] trying to prove you you know they have I
[57:02] believe it's out here in um in New
[57:05] Jersey they're in in naval yards that's
[57:07] a proving ground for them great carriers
[57:10] that they put out there on the seas they
[57:12] don't build a an aircraft carrier and
[57:14] then put it out there on the sea they
[57:16] actually submit things through great
[57:19] testings and trying before they ever put
[57:22] it out there see even this test and
[57:25] trial even right now that God would be
[57:28] moving in our life it's not just for
[57:30] this moment this is preparing us for the
[57:34] next step and next part in our life it's
[57:38] all things are being worked everything
[57:40] is working together it's temporary so
[57:46] here at Peter says in first Peter 5
[57:48] verse 8 be sober be vigilant this sober
[57:55] being of a collected circumspect mine of
[57:58] focus be sober and be vigilant because
[58:02] your adversary the devil as a roaring
[58:05] lion walketh about seeking whom he may
[58:09] devour
[58:12] delivered and placed in our right mind
[58:14] but to remain in the midst of this time
[58:17] in this age this is an age you don't
[58:19] have to go down to the bar to get drunk
[58:23] this is an age where there is thoughts
[58:25] there is things flying everywhere the
[58:30] cares of this world can weigh you down
[58:33] everything that you see around you this
[58:35] is why even Paul would pick this up he
[58:37] would speak about the soberness of how
[58:39] that one is to stay sober he would speak
[58:41] about how that they age men their to
[58:43] tell the younger men this is a as a
[58:45] condition of our life and over our lives
[58:48] of where we ought to to keep ourself
[58:50] there's all sorts of things that are try
[58:53] to distract us all sorts of things all
[58:56] sorts of things to try to take our
[58:58] mind in our meditation but hound that
[59:00] were directed this is leadership but
[59:03] I've got himself to us and it says whom
[59:07] speaking of the devil whom resist
[59:09] steadfast in the faith strong firm
[59:16] immovable knowing that the same
[59:22] afflictions are accomplished in your
[59:26] brethren that are in the world so it's
[59:30] not about you
[59:31] these same afflictions no matter they
[59:34] might come this way they might come that
[59:36] way but the same afflictions are
[59:38] accomplished in our brethren because
[59:40] it's God himself working his purpose out
[59:44] in our lives verse 10 you see it's
[59:51] important that we understand that what
[59:53] is what is we when we're looking at this
[59:54] in verse 9 what does that do cast out
[59:56] the wrong attitude then why does it seem
[59:59] like I'm always going through something
[1:00:00] it's cast that out see it cast out the
[1:00:04] wrong attitude what does that the world
[1:00:05] what is the wire it's God who is God God
[1:00:08] is love perfect love cast out all fear
[1:00:11] her faith in that words so descent our
[1:00:15] attitude correctly notice notice I says
[1:00:17] in verse 10 here but the God of all
[1:00:20] Grace who has called us unto his eternal
[1:00:24] glory by Christ Jesus by the anointed
[1:00:28] word of our day we have been caught and
[1:00:33] as Paul said that's the gospel of your
[1:00:36] salvation it is gone knowing we were
[1:00:40] identified with in Christ in that word
[1:00:43] and that word has been ministered and
[1:00:46] you and I there's a corresponding part
[1:00:48] within us than all of a sudden it's like
[1:00:50] you know they have these lost dogs and
[1:00:53] things that are lost and all of a sudden
[1:00:55] you find this I seen one where there was
[1:00:56] a lady here she found one after 10 10
[1:00:59] years you say what does that have to do
[1:01:00] with anything
[1:01:01] you know they chipped these these dogs
[1:01:03] now you can have a chip put in them and
[1:01:05] what they found was they got to looking
[1:01:07] at this dog she said this looks like a
[1:01:08] dog I had 10 years ago when I
[1:01:11] you know twelve years old he looks just
[1:01:13] like in characteristics and he does the
[1:01:15] same kind of stuff so what they did they
[1:01:17] took him to the vet and they scanned it
[1:01:19] and sure enough there was the chip they
[1:01:21] had put in him he belonged to them and
[1:01:23] that's why the Prophet said that gene
[1:01:26] found you that gene was already in you
[1:01:31] when the light of the hour scanned
[1:01:33] across your lap it said identified you
[1:01:38] were claimed by the light of the hour
[1:01:40] you always belong to him as the prophet
[1:01:43] said you always were saved but you had
[1:01:47] to come to the reality of it there had
[1:01:50] to be a light that could scan and bring
[1:01:52] forth what was already laying there that
[1:01:56] gene found sure so unto his eternal
[1:02:00] glory by Christ Jesus after that you
[1:02:07] have suffered a while after that's a big
[1:02:09] word in it after after the flood Noah
[1:02:13] seen the rainbow after the Lions been
[1:02:17] here the pillar of light after the
[1:02:21] Hebrew children went into the furnace
[1:02:22] after after after you've suffered a
[1:02:27] while how long's a while season how
[1:02:31] long's a season a moment how long's a
[1:02:32] moment he has it
[1:02:40] don't try to apply the day one day with
[1:02:43] the Lord as a thousand years don't try
[1:02:45] to fly that bad maybe that time will
[1:02:47] work right here but it suffered a while
[1:02:53] make you perfect establish strengthen
[1:02:58] settling to him be glory and Dominion
[1:03:02] forever and ever amen
[1:03:04] sir every trial I believe it we can be
[1:03:08] really honest tonight if our our
[1:03:10] perspective and these things of God has
[1:03:12] the Lord helping us that every trial we
[1:03:16] come out stronger than when we went into
[1:03:19] it now let me clarify that your flesh
[1:03:24] and your spirit has been reduced you are
[1:03:29] weakened but the inside man has been
[1:03:35] made stronger and that's the real you
[1:03:38] this is why after the Lord Jesus in Luke
[1:03:41] 4 Luke 4 verse 13 when the devil had
[1:03:45] ended all the temptation he departed
[1:03:47] from him for a season the very next
[1:03:50] verse says and Jesus returned in the
[1:03:53] power of the Spirit unto Galilee but
[1:03:54] there's a key important point that
[1:03:56] happened in there between verse 13 and
[1:03:58] verse 14 the angels came and ministered
[1:04:02] unto Him who were they ministering to
[1:04:08] was it that they needed to minister to
[1:04:10] the soul the soul was solid they had to
[1:04:14] provide ministry because the the the
[1:04:17] outward the temple was so weakened the
[1:04:22] spirits was so weakened but yet the
[1:04:24] ministering of angels was to do what
[1:04:27] strengthen him look with the Elijah
[1:04:29] Elijah himself after the great test
[1:04:32] there Elijah goes into the cave and I
[1:04:35] just steal Elijah but there's a
[1:04:37] circumstance that's happened within
[1:04:39] there and the Spirit of God moves to do
[1:04:42] what call him out to receive nourishment
[1:04:48] we need those times of nourishment
[1:04:52] after we've passed through a tester
[1:04:55] trial we need that times of nourishment
[1:04:57] they talk about times that when you you
[1:05:00] know you pass through different things
[1:05:01] some of you you know with medical or
[1:05:03] whatever more there were things and I
[1:05:04] can remember when I was playing football
[1:05:06] they had to stand on the scale in the
[1:05:07] morning they had a stand in the scale
[1:05:09] when we came in and from afternoon or by
[1:05:12] the afternoon and when we had to a daze
[1:05:14] and then we had to stand on the scale
[1:05:15] before we went out then we had to stand
[1:05:17] on the scale after that practice four
[1:05:18] times in one day I had to stand on the
[1:05:20] scale I'm not gonna tell you what it
[1:05:22] said but four times I had to stand on it
[1:05:24] the whole purpose of that was is to see
[1:05:27] was I taking in enough water was I am
[1:05:32] retaining enough and and then you know
[1:05:34] they would talk about you know
[1:05:35] replenishing certain nutrients in your
[1:05:37] body make sure you're getting salt
[1:05:38] because you're sweating things out like
[1:05:40] this so let's talk to you about those
[1:05:42] things why and you're out there exerting
[1:05:43] yourself there's things that you're
[1:05:45] losing you're not even realizing and in
[1:05:47] the midst of it as we go through a test
[1:05:48] we go through a trial sometimes after
[1:05:50] you come through a test or trial you
[1:05:52] look back and it seems like that you
[1:05:53] were pardon me for saying like this here
[1:05:55] might seem like you were Superman you
[1:05:57] were getting strength from you to know
[1:05:58] where he was getting strength from but
[1:06:00] it was from the Lord the Lord was
[1:06:02] helping you but after the test or trial
[1:06:04] and then it begins to pull back you
[1:06:06] begin to realize it's like the Prophet
[1:06:08] when he was under discernment after it
[1:06:10] began to pull back here it is the shell
[1:06:12] of a man that was suffering may God help
[1:06:19] us I believe that with all my heart may
[1:06:22] God help us may God help us to have the
[1:06:24] wisdom and the balance within those
[1:06:26] things as well Lord help me Lord restore
[1:06:29] me Lord refresh me Lord refresh me and
[1:06:33] you know he he loves to do that he loves
[1:06:36] to do that so here
[1:06:39] the Prophet he puts it like this I love
[1:06:41] this statement in time-tested memorials
[1:06:43] he's talking about the man who tested
[1:06:45] every part that went into that bridge
[1:06:48] down there I believe in Australia second
[1:06:51] paragraph brother he said that's what
[1:06:53] they're saying today he's talking about
[1:06:55] the bridge will never stand up he said
[1:06:56] that's what they say today this year
[1:06:58] Holy Ghost religion you're talking about
[1:07:00] it will be long that tree will burn down
[1:07:02] but it don't burn down the fire
[1:07:05] only waters it the fire only waters it
[1:07:11] hey you know some of you know right now
[1:07:14] most of us probably do that you know
[1:07:16] they talk about all these things with
[1:07:18] forest fires and whatever more but you
[1:07:20] know that there are many trees and
[1:07:21] things that they're designed that's the
[1:07:23] only way that the seed can be released
[1:07:26] that's the only way certain things can
[1:07:28] be released there's actually certain
[1:07:29] resin that's on certain leaves that that
[1:07:32] resin is a flammable substance and it is
[1:07:35] it is set there so that the fire itself
[1:07:37] can come along and it releases and
[1:07:40] brings growth there's times where a fire
[1:07:42] will come right through you know I know
[1:07:43] there's a even a big thing right now
[1:07:45] they do it and been doing it for years
[1:07:46] what they call prescribed fires where
[1:07:48] they'll get and they'll they'll burn an
[1:07:50] area up because it begins to be a lot of
[1:07:52] evasive species and a lot of things that
[1:07:54] are growing there and things get all
[1:07:56] tangled up you know and especially it
[1:07:58] works out good for deer hunters and
[1:07:59] things like that you burn up a lot of
[1:08:01] stuff and you get to a place to where
[1:08:02] you're hunting in the woods and there's
[1:08:04] no and there's no undergrowth going on
[1:08:06] and so what happens is the leaves
[1:08:08] falling down the leaves are good good
[1:08:10] organic matter makes it good for the
[1:08:11] soil but they keep building up building
[1:08:13] up building up building up so a good
[1:08:15] fire coming through there what it will
[1:08:17] do it'll actually burn up those leaves
[1:08:19] bringing them to ash which actually then
[1:08:21] mix with the soil will add to the
[1:08:24] nutrients that are there then that fire
[1:08:27] will come through at times and the fire
[1:08:29] will actually take care of certain
[1:08:31] saplings and certain things and
[1:08:33] sometimes the fire will come through and
[1:08:35] it'll be a reverse it'll actually bypass
[1:08:38] the saplings and get to the older things
[1:08:40] that are there that need to be done away
[1:08:42] with oh I'm glad that God's directing
[1:08:46] this fire I'm glad that God knows what
[1:08:49] needs to be done away with and Samuel he
[1:08:51] knows what needs to remain he knows what
[1:08:54] needs to be released and he says I'm
[1:08:56] just gonna water you a fire boy so God
[1:09:01] has his great big picture out and he's
[1:09:03] not filling it with water
[1:09:04] he's filling it with fire but don't
[1:09:09] worry remember as we looked at that fire
[1:09:11] within Moses there it did not consume
[1:09:15] the bush
[1:09:16] but the bush burned you see this fire
[1:09:19] only consumes the consumable it only
[1:09:24] allows to remain what is that God's
[1:09:26] desiring to bring forth the test and the
[1:09:29] trial is not against us but it's there
[1:09:31] many times it will release things in our
[1:09:34] life virtues that are being held there
[1:09:37] that they cannot be brought forth in any
[1:09:39] other manner the fire only waters it it
[1:09:46] only gives us new hold it only
[1:09:50] strengthens it every trial in testing is
[1:09:53] that every time a wind hits a tree and
[1:09:56] shoves it back and forth and back and
[1:09:57] forth
[1:09:58] it only loosens the roots so it can go
[1:10:01] deeper and get a better hole every time
[1:10:04] sickness strikes your home every time
[1:10:06] trials strikes your home every time the
[1:10:10] neighbors say something bad about you
[1:10:12] it's only shaking you loosening you up
[1:10:18] now
[1:10:20] if the neighbors say something bad about
[1:10:21] you and you go say something about the
[1:10:25] neighbors this ain't loosening
[1:10:32] like the wind trying to move you the
[1:10:36] wind can't move you but then again maybe
[1:10:39] we're more spiritual and you don't say
[1:10:41] it to their face you just post it on
[1:10:43] Facebook a little somebody you see we're
[1:10:49] talking in times and this right here
[1:10:52] that that it still comes down to
[1:10:54] discerning what's the spirit what's the
[1:10:56] part behind it it really comes down to a
[1:10:58] part like this gods wanting to reduce us
[1:11:01] when we feel like we got to tell our
[1:11:03] side you know what that's called pride
[1:11:07] if I tell my know God has a way so that
[1:11:13] it will all come out you don't you don't
[1:11:15] we don't have to frustrate it we don't
[1:11:17] have to frustrate you understand what
[1:11:19] I'm saying
[1:11:19] we don't have to frustrate it because
[1:11:21] what it does it just simply it puts us
[1:11:23] in a place and we're really not
[1:11:25] receiving what we ought to be receiving
[1:11:27] in that tester trying we commit
[1:11:31] ourselves to him is that right that's
[1:11:34] where to have we have that resolve
[1:11:36] within our hearts it's only shaking you
[1:11:39] loosening you up so you can get down and
[1:11:42] get a better hold on the eternal rock of
[1:11:45] God's unmovable word I'm not going to
[1:11:50] ask any of you to raise your head cuz
[1:11:51] everybody's been guilty where you're
[1:11:53] tempted about telling your side or your
[1:11:55] point or this or that we all have and
[1:11:57] there been times we've given in and I'll
[1:12:00] say Amen for all of us but you see this
[1:12:03] is part of this is God teaching us and
[1:12:05] training us thank God that there's a
[1:12:08] that life within us it can smite us it
[1:12:12] can convict us you know you know we want
[1:12:18] to live that sensitive
[1:12:28] but that's how God does it he sends
[1:12:31] those trials to test you to prove you to
[1:12:35] shake you up and to give you a new Oh
[1:12:39] hallelujah we're thankful for those new
[1:12:42] holds the Bible says concerning our age
[1:12:48] if they come and buy of me gold that's
[1:12:50] tried in the fire goes on to say buying
[1:12:54] of me white raiment that the shame of
[1:12:57] thy nakedness does not appear taking I
[1:13:01] said unto our eyes that we might see it
[1:13:06] might be applied to our hearts but you
[1:13:08] see this buying of gold money can't buy
[1:13:10] this gold the church system owns a lot
[1:13:14] of gold but this gold you can't buy this
[1:13:19] gold the only way to buy this gold is by
[1:13:22] submission
[1:13:22] it requires yielding and surrendering
[1:13:26] this gold is the very shaping and
[1:13:30] molding of our character and as we hear
[1:13:33] it over and over it's true that
[1:13:36] character it's not a gift the Holy Ghost
[1:13:38] is the free gift of God salvation is a
[1:13:41] gift of God they're right the character
[1:13:44] is not a gift it's a victory it's a
[1:13:50] victory Alleluia
[1:13:54] Gloria I think it just finds him so
[1:13:57] perfectly as but the John started out
[1:13:58] with that the first message he was
[1:14:00] speaking and it brought it right down to
[1:14:02] where we are all in a place and it kept
[1:14:04] moving within these these services it
[1:14:07] comes to a plate we're always yielding
[1:14:09] well bream says in question answers I
[1:14:11] believe it's 1954 and he talks about how
[1:14:13] he says you can study to such a place to
[1:14:16] where you're just so perplexed he said
[1:14:17] but you have to be in that place where
[1:14:20] you're yielded just as you was when God
[1:14:22] first got ahold of your life that
[1:14:24] yielding never stops you're continuing
[1:14:26] to yield to him and he what is he doing
[1:14:28] as we yield to him he steps in he's
[1:14:31] taking control it's him doing the work
[1:14:33] we don't need to be frustrated with
[1:14:35] trying to make it happen his word
[1:14:38] transforms us our confidence is in him
[1:14:41] and he is the word amen though I may not
[1:14:45] see it don't may not feel it but I know
[1:14:47] that that word will not return back to
[1:14:49] him boy amen
[1:14:52] that word is accomplishing you say no
[1:14:55] Sam I don't see it but look what it's
[1:14:57] like it's miss breath its life into you
[1:14:59] - were even that warrant you have you
[1:15:02] have such a hold and moves in you have
[1:15:04] an expectancy even though you don't see
[1:15:06] and you don't feel but it's just like
[1:15:08] it's like somebody bring new life into
[1:15:10] you it's like your life has been
[1:15:11] recharged and you find I think you know
[1:15:14] what I'm ready to keep going what is it
[1:15:17] that's doing it Jesus said my words they
[1:15:20] are spirit and life
[1:15:26] this gold of God is the prophet puts it
[1:15:28] in the lady of C an age is a christ-like
[1:15:30] character produced in the fiery furnace
[1:15:33] of affliction this is the right kind of
[1:15:35] gold now I want to just look here just
[1:15:39] for a few moments watch how Paul brings
[1:15:41] this in second Corinthians 4:17 Paul
[1:15:45] brings a comparison here between our
[1:15:47] light of our our light affliction and
[1:15:50] the glory that's received for our light
[1:15:52] affliction whilst not making light of
[1:15:56] anybody situation but he's trying to
[1:15:58] help us see that no matter what the
[1:16:01] complexity or how great the affliction
[1:16:03] is its light its light
[1:16:08] see what this is a view I relied
[1:16:10] affliction which is but for a moment a
[1:16:13] season a while how long is that he knows
[1:16:19] worketh for us these afflictions they
[1:16:24] they are not your master they are your
[1:16:29] servants they are working to bring out
[1:16:33] of us what God sees is there worketh for
[1:16:40] us a far more exceeding and eternal
[1:16:43] weight of glory while we look not at the
[1:16:46] things which are seen to help me Lord
[1:16:49] but at the things which are not seen for
[1:16:52] the things which are seen are temporal
[1:16:55] we can all recognize that the tests and
[1:16:58] trials that maybe you had last month or
[1:17:00] you had last year whatever more they're
[1:17:02] gone right here you are standing on the
[1:17:05] other side of them victorious and you
[1:17:08] didn't do a thing but yet just submit
[1:17:10] and surrender to him he brought you
[1:17:12] through he gave you grace and then he
[1:17:15] turns around and rewards you for
[1:17:17] standing faithful for the Grace and
[1:17:19] strength he gave you he didn't turn it
[1:17:24] around and begin to brag on himself but
[1:17:26] he holds you up and he says my what a
[1:17:28] trophy but what is the trophy about it
[1:17:32] is a life that is just in the midst of
[1:17:34] it submitted to him for the things which
[1:17:39] are not are seen are temporal but the
[1:17:41] things which are not seen are eternal
[1:17:43] Paul has brought that comparison the
[1:17:44] things are there light but compared to
[1:17:47] what the exceeding and eternal weight so
[1:17:53] what from the light fliction the great
[1:17:56] thing that comes forth there's an
[1:17:58] eternal exceeding weight and glory there
[1:18:01] is character that's being produced and
[1:18:04] being molded in my life the bread sama
[1:18:10] can't I get this from a seminar no can I
[1:18:14] get this just from just coming here and
[1:18:16] just hearing the word no
[1:18:21] the word gives you direction the word
[1:18:25] gives you leadership the word is giving
[1:18:28] us Direction within us on and even in
[1:18:30] our approach but you see why the word is
[1:18:32] set before us so then in the midst oh
[1:18:34] I'm getting to something right here the
[1:18:35] word is set before us God already knows
[1:18:38] what is out there before us he already
[1:18:41] knows the test or trial that's coming
[1:18:43] our way
[1:18:43] so God is setting his word before us
[1:18:45] there's a focus there's a focus that's
[1:18:49] before us these services these messages
[1:18:52] all of these things our God has dealt
[1:18:54] with us through all the collection of of
[1:18:57] the different ministers it's wrong God
[1:19:01] wanting us to focus not when we come
[1:19:03] into the trial we just say Oh wonder
[1:19:06] what's going on I don't understand
[1:19:07] what's going on I don't it's to give us
[1:19:10] a focus to do what God did not supply
[1:19:13] and give to us a word that he's already
[1:19:15] not provided a focus you see when God
[1:19:18] brought him out of Egypt he already
[1:19:20] provided a focus his work is already
[1:19:23] this is a direction we're coming through
[1:19:24] the wilderness here we're going to we're
[1:19:27] going to the promised land God's already
[1:19:29] given a direction there's a focus that
[1:19:32] we have it's more precious than gold
[1:19:36] what's how David says this in Psalms 119
[1:19:39] verse 71 it is good for me that I have
[1:19:45] been afflicted that I might learn that
[1:19:50] statutes it's good for me that I've been
[1:19:56] afflicted that I might learn that
[1:19:59] statutes I don't have them on the screen
[1:20:03] but I'm gonna refer to a few few men few
[1:20:05] men of God I really many times I enjoy
[1:20:09] Charles Spurgeon and different ones let
[1:20:12] me just read you a few other things
[1:20:14] Charles Spurgeon said in like this he
[1:20:16] says I have for my part Oh more I think
[1:20:20] to the anvil and to the hammer to the
[1:20:22] fire and to the file than to anything
[1:20:25] else I bless the Lord for his
[1:20:28] correctives of his Providence by which
[1:20:30] if he has blessed me on one hand with
[1:20:32] sweets
[1:20:33] he has blessed me on the other hand with
[1:20:36] bitters
[1:20:38] it's a looking at it Luther said it like
[1:20:42] this he says I never knew the meaning of
[1:20:44] God's Word until I came into affliction
[1:20:46] I have always found it one of my best
[1:20:50] school masters so in the midst of trial
[1:20:56] we don't abandon the word stay and hold
[1:21:01] tight to the word thy word Oh Lord is a
[1:21:05] lamp unto my feet it is a lie unto my
[1:21:10] pathway it's not talking about that we
[1:21:14] go into a study and maybe we have all
[1:21:16] the times like we have at other time but
[1:21:19] this this is a principle we want god I
[1:21:24] want to see my desire is what you have
[1:21:27] determined from my life I want to give
[1:21:29] myself to it see friends we can't take
[1:21:32] the attitude sometimes the attitude that
[1:21:35] has taken with that of and it's wrong
[1:21:38] where the thought line gets into
[1:21:39] predestination well God's just gonna do
[1:21:41] it anyway and don't matter what goes on
[1:21:42] that's not true that's not true
[1:21:45] predestination is responding to his
[1:21:48] presence God already already knows all
[1:21:54] things he already knows but within it
[1:21:58] predestination does not take away from
[1:22:01] our yielding it was like I've given the
[1:22:05] example many times where you know
[1:22:07] somebody trying to put this coat on me
[1:22:08] if I just stand here like this you're
[1:22:12] not gonna get that coat on me it's there
[1:22:15] come on but I'm gonna put the coat on
[1:22:16] you and I just stand here eventually
[1:22:18] you're gonna tell me and say Kenya can
[1:22:20] you give me your hand here can you raise
[1:22:22] your arm why am i raising Marv that's
[1:22:26] surrender there's somebody here that can
[1:22:29] help me I get the first Armand then I
[1:22:33] give my hand to his hand and he'll guide
[1:22:35] my hand in the other sleeve so it's in
[1:22:40] his presence it's recognizing his
[1:22:42] presence and submitting to it that's
[1:22:44] what brings to light
[1:22:47] predestination cuz predestination is not
[1:22:51] God pushing us through a pipe and
[1:22:54] pulling us out on the other side blessed
[1:22:57] is he that I did push and pull know
[1:23:00] blessed is he that over come well he
[1:23:05] shall inherit all things this is the
[1:23:10] same thing the life of the Lord Jesus
[1:23:12] God did not bypass this with the example
[1:23:15] son with our Redeemer the Bible is clear
[1:23:18] he learned obedience by the things which
[1:23:22] he suffered is that right so we we want
[1:23:27] to be clear that it is and always a
[1:23:28] given when we made the statement that we
[1:23:32] come out stronger we only come out
[1:23:34] stronger we only come out better when
[1:23:37] truly we are looking to him and focusing
[1:23:41] on him and God is so gracious I like
[1:23:47] teachers like this in school that
[1:23:48] believe in mastery learning that means
[1:23:50] if I got a test on a C on the test they
[1:23:53] say you take it again you got a B on the
[1:23:56] test
[1:23:56] you didn't you take it again you want
[1:24:00] the same questions but mastery learning
[1:24:04] is there is no excuse for you not
[1:24:06] learning you're going to learn you know
[1:24:11] what that did that did not put an
[1:24:12] anxious pressure on you you went into
[1:24:16] that it didn't mean didn't study I mean
[1:24:19] no doubt there was some people I
[1:24:20] probably with the school with it didn't
[1:24:21] but what it puts you at it puts you at a
[1:24:23] rest and know if I don't pass this I'm
[1:24:27] gonna redo it I know none of us say no I
[1:24:32] don't want this trial again Lord please
[1:24:37] I don't want this test again
[1:24:40] none of us new friends because what is
[1:24:43] it it's our humanity that's being
[1:24:45] reduced
[1:24:45] it's our weakness that's being exposed
[1:24:48] during the midst of it it is so we asked
[1:24:52] God Lord give me grace
[1:24:54] just give me grace give me grace Lord to
[1:24:58] to go through give me grace to stand in
[1:25:00] the midst of and when I feel like
[1:25:02] everything's caving in
[1:25:03] give me grace Lord that I can raise my
[1:25:05] hand give me grace Lord that I can say I
[1:25:08] love you Lord give me grace Lord that I
[1:25:15] will withstand an atmosphere of
[1:25:17] affecting my home in a way but yet in
[1:25:19] the midst of it Lord it would be an
[1:25:21] atmosphere given by your grace so this
[1:25:28] is where in our lives were being
[1:25:32] perfected in with this this is where
[1:25:36] James would deal with of how that my
[1:25:39] brethren count it all joy when you fall
[1:25:41] into divers temptations knowing this
[1:25:44] that the trying of your faith worketh
[1:25:46] patience but let this is the key let
[1:25:53] patience have her perfect
[1:26:06] now if they're gonna perform a surgery
[1:26:08] on me I need anesthesia I'm a baby and
[1:26:15] they're gonna pull it pull a tooth or
[1:26:17] doing cavity numb it up good I don't
[1:26:20] care my tongue slapping around I'm here
[1:26:22] any my job numb it good I don't want to
[1:26:24] feel nothing but God knows just how much
[1:26:32] anesthesia all we have to do is ask him
[1:26:37] for grace lord I need grace and he knows
[1:26:41] just how much grace to provide for that
[1:26:46] trial to where that we sit there in the
[1:26:49] chair we're not zombies come on somebody
[1:26:54] we're setting there what are we doing
[1:26:56] it's his Grace's we're looking to him
[1:26:58] lord I need your grace oh no what I need
[1:27:01] your strength what's happening we're
[1:27:04] letting patients have her perfect work
[1:27:07] Lord strengthen me in this moment lord
[1:27:10] help me Lord God when I need your help
[1:27:13] Lord seems like everything is cleaning
[1:27:16] around remember fall into divers
[1:27:18] temptations this word fall means to be
[1:27:20] encompassed about when to be encompassed
[1:27:26] means you don't see any gape any hole
[1:27:29] any exit door lord help me you promised
[1:27:35] in your work you'd make a way of escape
[1:27:36] you promised or you never leave me nor
[1:27:39] forsake me what do you know you're
[1:27:41] putting his word back there I'm standing
[1:27:43] on your word that you gave me Lord I
[1:27:47] need grace right now what are you doing
[1:27:50] in the midst of the time letting
[1:27:51] patience have her perfect work that you
[1:28:00] may be perfect and entire wanting
[1:28:06] nothing
[1:28:09] in an amazing God wants to see us grow
[1:28:16] he wants to see us grow and mature to
[1:28:19] that to match that that character of the
[1:28:23] picture that he has in his family album
[1:28:27] this time down here on earth is the
[1:28:30] growth it's a development time and God's
[1:28:34] desire within the letting patience he
[1:28:37] can't do this woman well the joy I can't
[1:28:39] do it for you you can't do it for me
[1:28:40] the thing I can do when I see you going
[1:28:43] through something or something just
[1:28:44] press on my heart maybe the Lord will
[1:28:45] wake me up in the middle of the night or
[1:28:46] put it on your heart and somehow I can
[1:28:48] say God strengthened my brother don't be
[1:28:50] with my sister I don't know what's going
[1:28:52] on but maybe they're going through a
[1:28:54] great trial in the midst of time what's
[1:28:56] it doing as a body we're feeling that
[1:28:59] and what are we doing we're praying God
[1:29:00] give strength give grace to my brother
[1:29:02] give grace to my sister why because our
[1:29:04] desire is to see one another come to
[1:29:07] maturity what burden what gave you that
[1:29:12] burden what gave me that burden he did
[1:29:15] he did that we would be perfect and
[1:29:22] entire entire not just part but entire
[1:29:26] wanting nothing God sees to it that
[1:29:34] every virtue that is sealed within us
[1:29:38] that it comes out in expression those
[1:29:43] virtues as the Prophet would tell us
[1:29:46] concerning our Mountain he said there
[1:29:49] birthed within us he would tell us don't
[1:29:54] she said you start off without a real
[1:29:57] born-again experience because without a
[1:29:59] born-again experience he said you're
[1:30:02] just adding peacock feathers to a black
[1:30:06] bird I say that to you that you're not
[1:30:09] under that we might understand this is
[1:30:10] that those virtues within themselves
[1:30:12] they are already sealed within our life
[1:30:17] but it takes these measures
[1:30:20] to release the expression and for those
[1:30:26] to grow we need him he will have
[1:30:38] achievement
[1:30:40] that's our confidence because the work
[1:30:45] that he started he finishes I don't know
[1:30:50] what I'm gonna have to go through I
[1:30:52] don't know things that I have to further
[1:30:54] suffer but the one thing I can do is
[1:30:57] look back on things and say Lord you
[1:30:59] have brought me through and the one
[1:31:02] thing that it has taught me and I'll be
[1:31:03] very honest with you it's taught me
[1:31:05] every test in every trial is my greater
[1:31:08] need so then when that when tests your
[1:31:12] trials come and those things come I'm
[1:31:16] not standing before you as all of a
[1:31:17] sudden I've got a Rolodex and perfect
[1:31:21] not that it's still a dying because our
[1:31:25] humanity does not like to be exposed it
[1:31:32] doesn't like it but God says when you're
[1:31:37] weak
[1:31:43] when you're weak I'm strong so our
[1:31:46] weaknesses are exposed but God is
[1:31:52] working all things after the counsel of
[1:31:55] his own Lord I just need grace let's
[1:32:02] just stop here tonight he's working
[1:32:06] trying of our faith worketh patience
[1:32:12] work it's working even now he's working
[1:32:18] Lord just give me great give me the
[1:32:21] strength Lord Jesus to trust him to know
[1:32:24] that he knows he's guiding it it's not
[1:32:26] that Satan is telling him what to do but
[1:32:28] remember as we looked at this in three
[1:32:29] kinds of believers we've been looking at
[1:32:31] that it's only God permitting to Satan
[1:32:34] to do what he can do Satan cannot even
[1:32:38] try to do anything else he only is given
[1:32:41] certain permissions but God permits it
[1:32:46] in order to bring out the expression in
[1:32:51] our lives and tonight maybe tonight
[1:32:55] you're going through something or you've
[1:32:56] been in the midst of something just
[1:32:59] remember this he's here to administer to
[1:33:01] you he's here to give you strength he's
[1:33:04] here to tell you hey there's cakes on
[1:33:05] the fire he's here to minister to you
[1:33:08] they ain't sent the Angels the Angels
[1:33:10] here to minister to us the strength that
[1:33:13] we have needed maybe you feel like
[1:33:14] you've lost something along the way
[1:33:15] maybe in a trial or a test but you know
[1:33:18] what he's here to minister and give you
[1:33:19] the strength because the real true
[1:33:21] reality of it is is that the inside man
[1:33:24] has been renewed when we're looking at
[1:33:27] it in the right way and we've just been
[1:33:28] submitting it to the Lord we might look
[1:33:30] like look friends in the midst of the
[1:33:32] world and the way the eyes of the world
[1:33:33] look it looks like weakness and
[1:33:35] everything else and that's true that is
[1:33:38] true but you cuz you see way the way the
[1:33:40] world has been so conditioned is the
[1:33:42] world has been conditioned to everything
[1:33:44] superheroes to a real hero always comes
[1:33:48] out on top that's fantasy
[1:33:57] as the Prophet tells us however god
[1:33:59] choose to commit a commit us to a trial
[1:34:02] to me you may commit you to death you
[1:34:04] may commit but you know what in all its
[1:34:07] great its efficient you believe that
[1:34:11] tonight but you see the way the world
[1:34:14] perceives all of this but God looks at
[1:34:17] it and says here's somebody that
[1:34:21] circumstances that's going on in their
[1:34:23] life I just I wonder how it is in the
[1:34:26] midst of a time of a service maybe a day
[1:34:29] as a day is going by and God can just
[1:34:31] step back and say what is it maybe
[1:34:41] they're going through the hardest test
[1:34:42] the hardest trial maybe things are
[1:34:45] bombard in their mind and everything
[1:34:47] else but yet they stand in the midst of
[1:34:49] it and and say Lord you're worthy Lord I
[1:34:54] need your grace I need your strength and
[1:34:56] here he is what a refreshment in this
[1:35:03] hour when this hour when hard things
[1:35:06] come up this hour this age it's quickly
[1:35:09] deserting but to see a life that stands
[1:35:12] and says Lord I'm depending on you
[1:35:17] because when you took me to be your
[1:35:23] bride you took the veil off my life and
[1:35:27] you put it upon your shoulder and you
[1:35:31] told me I'll take care of you all that
[1:35:35] you have need of don't you love him
[1:35:42] tonight let's pray
[1:35:47] Lord Jesus
[1:35:52] we order so thankful as you give us
[1:35:57] direction in your word you give us the
[1:36:00] leadership by your Holy Spirit Lord we
[1:36:03] every one of us across this building and
[1:36:07] even those that would stream of our
[1:36:09] climate leave I believe Lord that every
[1:36:11] one of our hearts as believers we want
[1:36:14] to see Lord more of a reflection of you
[1:36:18] in us Lord we realize that that through
[1:36:26] this as we see that the afflictions that
[1:36:29] come our way
[1:36:29] the tests the trials like David could
[1:36:34] say it was good that I was afflicted
[1:36:36] that I might learn that statutes Lord
[1:36:41] it's something that we as we go through
[1:36:44] things in our life we can look every one
[1:36:46] of us in your weave there's been
[1:36:48] testimonies all around us here been
[1:36:51] testimonies where you've moved on the
[1:36:54] scene healing those that were sick but
[1:36:59] then it comes to our own personal life
[1:37:01] that we might also have a testimony
[1:37:05] and I know he's the Lord that healeth
[1:37:08] all my diseases but I know that he's my
[1:37:13] provider Lord as your prophet put it so
[1:37:16] clearly you allow and permit these
[1:37:19] trials to come away than you might
[1:37:21] demonstrate your love to us you want to
[1:37:26] make it known to us as Peter said whom
[1:37:31] having not seen we love Lord how that
[1:37:39] you make known your love to us through
[1:37:43] the many various manifold temptations
[1:37:46] Lord you make yourself Oh Lord Jesus we
[1:37:54] want to say to my lord thank you for
[1:37:58] your grace thank you for sufficient
[1:38:02] grace for God there's nothing else Lord

[1:38:09] brought me safe this far it'll safely
[1:38:13] carry me through through many dangers
[1:38:16] toils and snares I have already come tis
[1:38:20] grace that brought me safe thus far
[1:38:22] grace will carry me safely Oh Lord Jesus
[1:38:27] tonight
[1:38:29] we want to just want to give ourselves
[1:38:33] to you help us forgive us lord when
[1:38:35] we've had the wrong attitude
[1:38:37] forgive us Lord when we've questioned
[1:38:39] and we've lined Lord to see sometimes
[1:38:42] those things can come and then in a
[1:38:43] moment it's turned from our lives right
[1:38:45] right in a moment Lord it's turned we're
[1:38:48] thankful that there's a greater there's
[1:38:50] a greater one on the inside nor Jesus
[1:38:55] you are our expectation you are the
[1:38:59] Blessed hope Lord you
