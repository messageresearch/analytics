Lord we're are standing Lord in obedience to your word you said ask the father anything in my name and I'll do it there's no greater name than the name of the Lord Jesus Christ [Music] where all needs are met and satisfied Lord from where salvation and healing flows and Lord as we're standing yielded hands God to be placed upon one another Lord Jesus that that same virtue that same quickening power

Heart Lord father that we have our hands Lord laid upon in this congregation Lord and father we're standing here as Believers Lord with an assurance that you're more than enough Lord you are all that

our hands laid upon one another for you said if they shall lay hands on the sick they shall recover now Heavenly Father we yield Lord of our hands Lord we yield Our Lives oh God and and I pray that Lord that you would come Lord in a wonderful way within this service this morning and minister to every need Lord God minister to every one of our hearts Lord oh God that father when we would Lord leave out of here Lord oh God not only are you the god of Miracles Lord of what can take place right here right now but you're the same God that Lord can drop your word in the Heart Lord and that word Lord is a word of Amen it's a word that it's finished Lord oh God that we can look Lord with the clarity to know that Lord there is an end to suffering Lord there is a finality Lord You're the amen now Lord God we ask these things all For Your Glory that you would be glorified in the midst of your children Lord that our faith Lord might rise oh God into the heights of the promises Lord that

and we thank you father in Jesus precious name amen and amen amen don't you love him amen amen thank you thank you musicians amen amen thank you so much I want to go right into the word of the Lord here this morning and so good to be here with you and I know different ones that uh we've had sickness among us but I'm thankful that God he still ministers to those that are sick yes he does aren't you amen so good to be uh together uh once again and hopefully Lord willing this week the books and things will be coming in I just did talk with brother George on Friday so Lord willing that will be hopefully coming in here this week and um I just also want to make mention to you um that I know sometimes that we we don't always and not everyone is here on Thursday nights but I'm going to I'm going to ask you if you're not um on Thursday nights and if you can be here be here but um we've been going through a little part I've taken a little side as side part as the Lord has just led us and just dealing with some things and I've just put it under the title of church order but these are things that I spoke um have been speaking on and there's still some some ahead of us to go on and to to work with and um it's um the Lord just really taking us in a nice just a real depth of some things that U I've just really been enjoying I've been enjoying studying them and looking at them and um just um I ask you this uh please make sure that you are aware of that and and those things and and listening to I know I know most of you do uh but uh you know sometimes I've got questions uh from uh from different ones about certain things and sometimes the questions are that are asked it I don't know if Thursdays are being listened to or not and so certain little things I can catch and so uh I don't mean to put you on the spot but I want to just say that we we need all of the word of God and uh it's just for us as an assembly what what I've been speaking on I'm not speaking for anybody else what I speak is for here for us as an assembly it's things that even the brothers and where we will base and always refer back to so um and certainly we want to just stay within the safety and the boundaries of the word of God God uh to me um I don't need any other message God has sent a message that will sweep us all the way home and I'm satisfied with that I'm satisfied with that uh you know I you continue to read over Sometimes some of the same quotes and I just was sharing with the young people there on Friday night I said you know there's times when I'll go back in when I go back into a study I just don't I just don't assume things I want to go right back through I just want to make another broad study and go back through quotes cuz there's things that I know that the Holy Spirit Will begin to Quicken out of there that I never saw before amen that's how the word of God is it just continues to come forth amen so good to see you I I know I've said that maybe a dozen times but we'll we'll keep on saying good to see everybody amen God bless you amen so Psalms 103 David said bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name bless the Lord all my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who Health all thy diseases you know I I love how that's wrote yes sir yes sir you know God could have listed them we wouldn't we wouldn't have been able to carry it around can you imagine trying to read that for a text that's right I mean of all the all the diseases could you imagine trying to read of all the things of all the sin but you notice it all comes down he forgiveth all that's he Health all abely who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with loving kindness and Tender Mercies who satisfi thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the Eagles and the Lord executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed amen may God bless you and bless that's the reading of the word as you're being seated got one more scripture I'm going to pull from here real quickly out of First Kings 18 and verse 30 and Elijah said unto all the people come near unto me and all the people came near unto him and he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down now when we look at this word and perhaps I'll come back and pick this scripture up but this word repaired is the word Rafa that means to make healthful or to heal and so what was all broken apart when God gave a word to Elijah Elijah he came on the Mount Carmel and it was a Mount Carmel Showdown but he began to assemble those stones to restore and repair the altar of the Lord he did not he he took what was broken and he brought it together yeah that's good and God there's a lot of times when we can look at things and look in situations sometimes you know it can even be from the simplest of a of looking at maybe a project or whatever and you just you can become so overwhelmed it can look and sometimes there's situations and things that you don't even know where to begin where do you start there's things that sometimes seem to be irreparable and yet as far as with man and even with all of man's in genuity and intellect it would be impossible with man there's lives that can look to be irreparable sometimes it can even look to be that as though when you see a situation and you can look and it can seem like my it's just something that is going just the opposite way and maybe it's scornful maybe it's things that's uh belittling and things that's being said and coming out of this person's mouth and you you're saying God be merciful and you you could look at a situation and think my I I don't know you know in the human mind but yet when when God has moved down in the depths of your life you recognize by a supernatural experience in your own life that's right that there's nothing beyond God absolutely because it was not you or I that changed ourselves it really wasn't us that start that was seeking God it was God seeking after us that begin to pull on our heart because there's a part of us that always was a son and daughter of God that was that part that come from God and that was magnetized to him and so when he would begin to move Upon Our Lives and all of that takes place within its time and in its season but to see that's where everything that we would base our Our Hope from our expectation is because we know that what God has done in our own lives and to know that there's no uh situation or anything that is beyond the reach of almighty God and I'd like to just speak here this morning or at least to begin to with this thought on God's provided place of healing sometimes there's things that when we look at healing and healing can be seemingly such a a simple word and we can we' speak of it and we'll say you know pray for healing for one another and we know what that means and And yet when we would begin to if I were to ask you and say what does that mean what what what is healing well in real in real simple words it would be to get back to helpfulness or back to my normal self or back to where I'm not feeling bad or to where the you know I'm no longer plagued with this illness or this disease or or this mental I'm I'm no longer uh a plagued with this and I'm I'm able to move and to and to operate and to function as as as I should and we all know what that's like you know I think when um you know back here last July I kind of wonder if our family had what some of the rest of the church got later on here in the first of the year because when we were there in the month of July and what we had last year and you know man it just knocked us off our feet and it seemed like it just something that just lingered for weeks on end and you know you in your mind you start you have a memory in your mind of what it feels like to feel well you know you you get to a place and you you start feeling like you're making two steps forward then all of a sudden you find yourself the next day you feel weaker than you did the other day and then you get a little then you find the next day you wake up and you're like wow I I feel good and maybe this is the time I can go and kind of you know do a little bit and then all of a sudden you find yourself maybe a week again and you know cough and all those things and sometimes things can can linger for a period of time and you know with healing itself because let's just all be honest we can look at it and say that well you know healings a minor brother Samuel that's true it it is a minor but I'll tell you what when you get sick it becomes major so it is a minor but yet you know what it's it's major when it comes down to the needs in our body now I want to just begin here and I'll just we just want however the Lord will just take us and direct us through this within it but within healing in itself I'm going to telling you God not only send a word and sends his word to bring healing to that of our body but God has sent a word to bring a healing to our soul because that's what's the most important thing but with that God's care has provided all that we would have need of throughout this journey because there's going to be times in our life that the best best of intentions that we've had whether we've made mistakes or whether maybe we've offended or we've offended somebody else and on and on and on and on we could go that there's times where we're going to need healing in our spirit sir and there's not a doctor that can get there to your spirit realm now psychologist and psychiatrist and I'm not listen just let me just tell you I could read you a whole Litany of course quotes brother Brown just says it like this he said instead of us being against he said the man who preaches healing him being against you know the doctor and instead of the doctor being against the surgeon and instead of the surgeon being against the chiropractor and in he said everything that helps is of god you see God can work through many different Avenues but it's God God that's right are you hearing me it's God God's the one who brings the healing it never was medicine when we take medicine or you know maybe you drink Elderberry syrup or whatever it it it it it's God who is the Healer I I I you know I I believe in all those things but it's God that is the one who brings healing in our life there's times where in situations of Life seasons of life that we we go through changes of life that we come into that we experience different things you know uh things will change hormones will change all sorts of things will will change and in that time you know we need we need a healing touch from the Lord and you know within that God doesn't always come around and you know remove necessarily all the conditions but God will bring a healing to us to alleviate or lift fear from when we feel those things coming around us brother BR tells us in uniting time and sign when God uh spoke to his heart and you remember brother brandham had a condition in his stomach that brother Bram would tell us in this way it would come in a in a in a real harsh way every seven years and he would talk about he would also deal with the cycles of seven of how that every seven years we we we deal with something we're going through something and and he deals with how that you know every time that that that nervousness and that would come within you know and affect his stomach you know brother BR would talk about how fear would come around you know I just want to say it like this I've said this over and over you know that but I appreciate the transparency of the message of the hour brother brandham himself he never tried to be a superhero he just wanted to make sure that we knew who the real superhero is and that's the Lord Jesus Christ and that's why the we recognize there's no big ones or little ones Among Us and and we don't have to ignore things but we've got a faithful and merciful high priest that when we are experiencing things in our life we can go to him amen we can talk to him and he knows all about it and you know what even if we within ourselves sometimes we maybe don't even know what to say or how do I say it how do I word it or I don't even know where to even begin I'm glad that God can come right around within a meeting within a service maybe while you're listening to a tape and all of a sudden he'll identify something that is is there that is present uh in our lives that we would have need of the healing virtues of the son of the Living God and God will make that known and then all of a sudden then then it be then we we have a reality or knowing what I need to ask for and you know brother Bram when he was standing there he said you know God came to him uniting time and sign he tells it and he says you know he says here I was and he says and every time it's come it's it's you know it's been fearful and brother Bram deals with it and he says that how he said he came to me and he told me he said it'll never make you afraid any longer now brother Bram stopped and he said now he could have taken the whole thing but instead he came and he said you're not going to fear it any longer so now you see now now watch this brother brandham never received his healing in that stomach condition in this life that is so are you with me you know you can go on the wings of a snow white dove and I walked right in the pathway and you know of where that that that squirrel would have would have jumped out and there ain't no squirrels up there but all of that that that was there you know and how God put that there listen the same God that put a ram on the mountain is a same God to put a squirrel there and so within that part of how that you know that that very it went remember the seventh one it went to jump and and brother Brad himself as as he stepped stepped back it crushed itself on one of those Tula cactuses it almost looks like a you know them them nice tasty churros you know it that's almost that's what that that's what that kind of a cactus looks like and and it it it crushed itself it died right there and to think that you know the prophet came off of that mountain with an expectation in his heart it's over yeah it's finished that's right and little did Brother Bram know that as far as the suffering and the finishing it was only a few weeks down the road and the Lord was going to take him home let me just tell you something brother brandom is not complaining on the other side hallelujah what it shows you and I is not to be hopeless as though that oh I've got things I'm going to have to carry for the rest of my life that's not true that's not what was being said but what it is is there's certain things that though that we maybe can't go back and erase this or erase that but God can bring the healing that we have need of that's right to be able to Rise Up from where we're at and make steps forward and look with a real expectation in his word to know that God has this under control because sometimes before you can ever start sometimes in certain situations with things it's like you know when somebody has a um you know they they have a condition and maybe they have a stroke or whatever more you you cannot I know I'm speaking to you know the medical individuals here uh you can't you you know you can't even start thinking about signing them up for therapy right the first thing is is you got to get them stabilized right that's right am I right you got to get them stabilized and sometimes you've got to get all of those things make sure with where's the damage at so you got to do some testing on where are the are the neurons firing is there still seizures that's going on all of those things that you know and and where where do they have movement and all those things and checks so they're really monitoring them now eventually yes they're going to have to probably they're going to have to go through therapy and all this but that's not now where healing starts with is first diagnosing that's good the issue that is so good and we want to make sure that we're not putting you out there if things are not actually in place for you to be there at that moment and you see you know man in itself can miss so many things we can miss things friends listen let me just show you how clear this is the prophet would stand right here and he would and well not right here but you know behind the pull pit and he would preach taking his text out of Revelation 6 and he would preach the white horse rider and preach that underneath the messages of the mighty conqueror but once the Holy Spirit took the cover off who that is right there it did not matter how innocent it looked but what was beneath it was exposed then the prophet could say now I know why I've always been against organization because he's showing that organization is actually a suppressing it's a conquering it's wanting to take people from what you say well how is that conquering because it's wanting to separate or get between the people and God as though that they become the mediator between God and man there's one mediator between God and man and that's the man Christ Jesus that's it and that's why when God sent a message in this end time it was was to remove the veils it was to remove uh that of man's uh ideas and and thoughts and and to bring us face to face with a living God that we can have not only a real true experience but a relationship to where that there's a fellowship that takes place between God and his people like it was on the day of Pentecost lip to ear where there's a communion that you can have and a fellowship with almighty God hallelujah because after all when we look back at the temple back there that was there in the wilderness Solomon's Temple then when they re restored it herod's Temple on and on that that we could go all of that was a type and speaking not just of the Lord Jesus but the Lord Jesus came as the perfect reflection and example of what God intended every son and daughter to be and that was that in our lives we would become a House of Prayer Hallelujah and prayer we understand it's not ceremonialism you can be praying while changing your kids diapers you can be praying while you're working on a machine we realize prayer is not a tradition prayer is is a matter of the heart it's a communication it's a fellowship with almighty God as he said my house when they had wanted to take it away he said wait a minute I don't want my house filled with all these other things my house you made it a d of Thieves but it shall be called a House of Prayer I say God if there's anything in me that is hindering that cleaning out go right down lord and in the channel That if there's anything that's not allowing me in in my life and when I say me I'm talking about me as a Son of God you as a daughter of God son if there's any channel at all Lord then father will you lead us into that area amen bring healing into that area because you understand that sometimes when even we take even certain things into our body they'll talk about inflammation and how it it caused us to act and so forth and then we're living in an age in a time right now that is simply all about treating symptoms instead of getting to the root of the problem are you hearing me instead of recognizing well why you know let's not just treat the inflammation why is it there and sometimes it really isn't a great mystery it comes down to a lot of the things that we simply eat in a very simple way on a daily basis you see sometimes the things that really affect our lives and and so forth are not great big things that are out here but it's just the simple things sometimes the simple things that we're taking in or the things that were we're not taking in what we need to do but God never sent a word to treat symptoms amen because you see when you get to the root of the problem the symptoms will go right because what what the word of God comes to do is deal with the problem certainly right and so when the prophet could stand there and say I know now why I've always been against organizational ISM what it was is is getting down to what is the root of the problem what has been there and it's the spirit of God not us listen friends it's not us it wasn't brother brandom as a man he he was the prophet to this age yes but you realize it was God operating through that gift to what you know why all that was about was not only to call us back to the word but it was to demonstrate before you and I that I am your provided place of healing in this hour I am the Lord that Health thee that's why God did that because now our faith is not is not something that's back in the history but our faith is in the living presence of the Living God who said I am the same yesterday today and forever than you and he's healer he heals in every area of our life I want you to turn with me if you would to Luke Chapter 5 I want you to look here in Luke 5 and verse 17 the Bible says it came to passed on a certain day as he was teaching that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by which were come out of every town of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem and the power of the Lord was present to heal them why was why was his presence there to heal them and behold men brought in a bed a man which was taken with apy in other words he couldn't get there on his own and they sought means to bring him in and to lay him before him so it's evident these men they knew who Jesus was and no matter whatever meeting they had been in wherever they had seen but they thought of their friend that's good yeah and it it wasn't it wasn't their friend it was them and here they're coming to bring their friend now notice when they could not find but what way they might bring him in because of the multitude they went up on the housetop and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus now I don't know if they were able to really see where Jesus was at right right that's good or they were Guided by the same Faith right that caused them to pick up that c that bed that their man that that their friend was on but they I want you to understand this what they saw in front of them was obstacles right that's good come on and hindrances things that look like there's no way possible and you know what healing itself sometimes when you get to looking at it I don't care if it's a cold I don't care if it's back pain I've been in times where my back you know you'd realize you don't know how much you realize some of you with had dealt with your back when you laugh or you sneeze you're like dear Lord I don't want to cough I don't want to sneeze and you when you stand up you just saying I'll just stand up because when you go to sit back down then the spasm and everything starts and it's just and and you know so we've all been in situations and you wonder is this going to is this going to is this going to move is it going to you know and yet we're praying we're believing and and yet in our bodies sometimes we we don't feel anything moving we don't feel anything uh uh you know being lifted and yet within everything many times it's looking beyond the present condition and looking to God who made the promise and here it is there's always going to be hindrances there's always going to be oppositions but listen when oppositions present themselves that's the time to say yes when a doctor's report comes that isn't do good that's not the time to say no it's the time to say yes Lord It's a time when when you know that gloominess wants to come around or a hindrance and you know to move within our life to hold us back and you know anybody's ever experienced you know anxiety and anxiousness and those things like that you know those things can come around it can literally almost take your breath away and it's not a and in that moment in that time I'm not talking mind over matter but you know it's a time that David himself experienced that and he said he would say what time I am afraid I will trust in thee he also said in the scripture of how that God would pick him up in the Book of Psalms and set him in a large place that scripture means it would be God that would absolutely take away what seems to be smothering him and giving [Music] space hallelujah hallelujah it's God it's God watching over his children Hallelujah the prophet tells us there when he takes us there into the Book of Revelations and how here he is one standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks he said it's though he said many have the concept as though that once God has saved us that he himself becomes disinterested and he said but that as though that he would be an onlooker he said but he's not just an onlooker he is walking in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks and let me tell you something what he spoke to that age when it was such bitter persecution it was such bitterness that was coming against them he spoke to them in the midst of that saman Ag and said I [Applause] knowall I know hallelujah hallelujah God knows all about even the suffering he knows the healing that we have need of in our lives this word word it heals yes it does soul spirit and body we've ministered here for a little bit on complexes that's not in the body that's in the spirit and you know what brother brand needed healing right come on he needed healing you know that that let that be out there for you and I because knowing we were going to come into those places we would have things within our lives that all of a sudden the spirit of God would Minister to us and we're saying Lord I want to get out here to the therapy I want to get out here but God said we got to work right here we got to make sure all everything's firing just exactly just right you see friends let me just say it like this God never complicated the gospel he never complicated our healing I just say it like this God God is the very one when we can look can say Lord I know I need healing I know I need help then the Holy Spirit if we'll just let go yes he'll take us there and you know you might not even know exactly how to pray about things anybody know what I'm talking about sometimes when you've had everything you don't even know how to pray where do I even begin I don't even know what words Lord but you know sometimes when you're looking at situations and you say well this is the need this is the need but sometimes the first need of if he healing is God going down and actually creating a faith in our hearts sometimes with healing it's God going down listen sometimes before even forgiveness can take place there's a need for healing you can't get ahead of the healing and gum to forgiveness yes forgiveness is a work of the heart yes forgiveness is an attribute of God yes it is a glor glorious powerful attribute that God has displayed over and over but he must display it through healthy healed branches and I'm sure we can read in the scriptures and fellowship on this that there's times where God expressed forgiveness we would have never even imagined it right right so you know what that you know what that says don't try to figure out what forgiveness is just say Lord make forgiveness in my life as it is in your life in your heart he because remember he's the Creator he's the Creator let me get back to my scripture here so good so notice the Bible said well verse 19 I read that verse 20 and when he saw their faith don't get nervous somebody said I heard that before but I want you to catch this verse 20 when he saw their faith it wasn't that he saw the faith of the man who was on the C he didn't bring himself there no brother BR said what it is he said when you get in meeting like this and he said here there are hearts that are believing he said God will work right in the midst of that time where faith is pulsating among other believers to bring your faith up to where it needs to be to receive what God has for you hallelujah hallelujah let me tell you something this is why when we look at this in the scripture this is why we need the Gathering in the house of God in live Ministry because let me tell you there's times like this that you may not feel so strong and you don't let's just be honest friends there's times I just was listening to brother brandham here just just yesterday and I just go right back to I thought my did I hear what I just heard I go I up and brother B said there's sometimes when I haven't been able to pray the prayer of faith it just wasn't coming I don't know about you but but I appreciate those statements I appreciate all the message but I I come back into those places there and you look and brother B actually takes this thought and he's dealing with how that when we're in a meeting that sometimes see how Satan wants to isolate you even to try he wants to try to get you on an island you were not meant to be on an island but you know what it will happen you know what starts out on an island it starts when there's a bruised Cil that's how cancer comes in cancer comes in the body but it can only take hold when there's a bruised cell cell that's offended it can only work within that way and there's only one thing that can take care of that because that cancer is a spirit are you hearing me now even when it thinks about well I I feel I feel offended do you realize that's just not well I just feel offended that's a spirit you might have a right or you might say I've got a real feeling but you've got to recognize justce much as when your sugar gets too high or your blood pressure is too great that's just not a feeling that's a Spirit come on diabetes is a blood sucking demon high blood pressure is a spirit diseases are spirits you say what what are you saying you're not saying I have a right to be offended what I'm trying to say is when that Spirit comes in it's trying to get a hold in your life to isolate you and start to work on you let me tell you we need we we we need the treatment of the radiating power of the raise of the son of righteousness are you hearing me that's the promise in his word that the son of righteousness would arise with healing in his wings we need the healing rays of the S so n moving down into our lives my my how did we get here let me go on here and he said unto him man thy sins are forgiven thee oh boy oh boy Jesus just knows how to stir the pot don't of all things you can say right now you know of all things you can say in front of these Pharisees these Skeptics these critics but he says man thy sins are forgiven thee and the scribes and Pharisees begin to reason saying who is this which speaketh blasphemies who can forgive sins but God Alone that was a duh moment recognize who is in your midst if that's being spoken who's in our midst you see these were men who were Disciples of the history of Moses but they were not Disciples of the god of Moses are you hearing me because if they had been Disciples of the god of Moses they would have been like the other Remnant waiting there and they would also know Hallelujah that when Israel failed there and made those golden calves after all was taking place down there Moses said I'm going up on the mountain to make an atonement for you he never even took a sacrifice are you hearing me now he never took a lamb he never took a ram he never took anything and you say well how can there be an atonement without a sacrifice but you God himself delivered his word and in the word is the life and Moses is going as an intercessor there on the mountain on their behalf so the true atonement is Jesus Christ now the spirit that was in the blood cell is in you and that blood is speaking better things it's the atonement living out in a people people that have experienced being [Applause] atoned they didn't know the god of Moses they knew the [Music] history these were men they knew the law but here stood one who came in in a condition that somebody took no notice of him oh yes Jesus said why reason you in your hearts verse 22 whether is it easier to say thy sins be forgiven thee or to say rise up and walk oh now now here's the question what's easier to say thy sins are forgiven thee or rise up and walk right but that you may know that the son of man hath power upon Earth to forgive sins he said to the sick and py I say unto thee arise and take up thy couch and go into thine house and immediately he rose up before them and took up that whereon he lay and departed to his own house glorifying God and they were all amazed and they glorified God and were filled with fear saying we have seen strange things today now you know what Jesus pointed out to them when he said thy sins are forgiven thee they could not see that happen right I'm going to tell you if you ask that man who was on that couch let's Fellowship around this a little bit you know what it meant when God forgave you of your sins are you hearing me there was there was a lift That Came Upon Your Life brother Aon you remember that at that Blue Sky Restaurant right there in the middle of that restaurant sins were lifted forgiven and lifted up Hallelujah hallelujah what took place in an invisible realm people could have questioned it Hallelujah that's what they were doing and Jesus said just so that you'll know what has taken place in The Invisible realm will become visible before you take up your bed and walk what happened in The Invisible by the word it came and released him from his couch GL oh friends the same God that brings healing to your soul the same God that brings forgiveness of sin the same God that heals your soul is the same God that can move through and heal your body and heal your [Applause] spirit and your life begins to reflect what's happened on the inside and ain't it funny how that devil likes to you know he like the devil likes to turn it around nowadays and say well you know uh he used to heal we know he we know he forgives sins now but about healing we we don't know that oh my but let me tell you you can't have you can't have healing and salvation without the atonement because the atonement deals with both you see when the Bible said he was wounded yes for my transgression bruised for my iniquity and the chastisement of my peace our peace was upon him his side was open out of his side went water blood and spirit on his back he had stripes on his head he had crowns for your mind battles and that blood flowed from here here was this blood flowing and from his black his back as well brother Bram said all of those streams Blended in to one string running right down his legs he's not only the one for salvation he's my healer of my body the Healer of my mind the Healer of my spirit he is all things what I have need of he is the Lord that Health all th diseases they flow down they've all met in Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the Lord this is why our main objective the prophet said is Souls because you can be healed tonight in your body and you'll be sick maybe again but once that Soul has ever come in contact with God it does not matter what comes your way that Soul has been sealed away in the presence of God now I than God for that cuz the prophet tells us he says you want to make your choice while you're in your right mind that's right he said because you never know what might happen to you some fever might fry your brain he said you might P into an accident and then you'll say things that you would not even know what you were saying it would come out here that maybe even against God and you oh what happened but the soul he said has been sealed the prophet said that's why I'm a real calvinistic thinker believing in the real true security that's why the prophet would go on to tell us in the demonology series he said you can take a man that's been converted man or woman that's been converted by the spirit of God down on the inside he said they might go into complete in insanity but their soul has been sealed Hallelujah you know what those two quotes I wish I had more time this morning to preach on it you know what them two quotes tell me that he is God over emotional distress he is God over anxiety he's God over depression he's God over the mental disturbances he is God and the seal holds the seal holds hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah he's the same yesterday today and forever oh my no wonder brother Ram could say oh how we love to see healing but oh there's nothing like seeing a lost soul come weeping their way to the altar God be merciful to me a sinner the mute will die again the paralytic will die all the sick will get sick again and die but that Soul that's saved is saved for eternity forever never to [Applause] perish let me just tell you something God has got claim over your soul and I'm want to just I'm want to let put the devil on notice the devil don't have the say so even of the trial or the test or the situation you here you are standing present and looking to God for healing listen God can drop healing just like that and then God can also drop a word and you hold to that word and that word gives you a vision to walk clear into your healing to know that I'm the Lord that Health all thine diseases let me just tell you something God will give you a confession yes you will are you hearing me God will put words in your mouth he'll let you know what to say you won't be saying words out here it W just be ramblings of a confession but that confession is coming from your soul I am the Lord that Health all thy [Music] [Applause] diseases Jeremiah 17:14 oh my we're just going to roll Jeremiah 17:14 Jeremiah said Heal Me Oh Lord and I shall be healed right save me and I shall be saved you know what that speaks of it's healing comes from God true salvation comes from God God is the one notice he's crying out heal me right I have need Lord oh my brother Bram says it like this turning pages will never do any good it takes something to happen happen on the inside any doctor will tell you if you put something on the outside and heal the sore over on the outside it only make it worse if it isn't he has to heal from the inside out that's right so do you realize where your healing is coming from the provided place of healing is in Christ and if you are in him at that day you shall know and I am in the Father the father in me I in you and you and me if we can recognize that where is that healing coming from it's coming from the inside amen and you say well what is it that releases that healing well it's like we said some Sundays ago getting water from one field to the other you got to walk work by the law of gravity and the law that you and I are called to work by is Faith and that's why faith brother BR would say it he's very clear in the message Divine Healing he said many times he said we say we believe it but we don't accept it but you see we've got to believe it and he says it like this then you accept it then you confess it and he begins to act out on your behalf now listen to me now brother BR said many times that's why he said at times where an individual could set for 10 years in the same spot believing the word but not accepting it wow you see you've got to accept it and accepted does not based upon your worthiness right it's not your worthiness listen he's already he's already made a way for you and I that we could accept the word don't argue against the pardon accept it don't even argue against Lord I have fallen so short Lord I failed so much and I've done this but look where the reason you can see where your shortcomings is at is the grace of God so you can see there is Grace to pick you from where you're at to where you need to be it is a blessing to see I need [Applause] healing Hallelujah this man could not get to where Jesus was at but he had some friends that were Believers and they knew where Jesus was at and they were going to get him in the presence of Jesus they were not trying to figure out how's his condition going to straighten out they had confidence if we can just get him there Jesus will take care of it brother and sister that's my confidence if our hearts can just be moved right here this morning by the presence of God and Faith beginning to build in your hearts in the presence of God healing of Soul the baptism of the Holy Ghost healing in the spirit healing in the body I've Got Confidence the Lord is present to heal Hallelujah Hallelujah Lord oh blessed be his name don't you love him so good hallelujah hallelujah let me grab one more scripture here Bible said a sound heart is the life of the Flesh of sound heart a helpful heart is the life of the flesh you know sometimes when there's things that take place inwardly in US it affects us outwardly that's right every one of us according to your perspective and your occupation in life whether it's from students on up we all experience stress sometimes there's things that just leaves us in a place I know at different times I've experienced that with stress I can always kind of tell you know a lot of things can go in my mind because I feel this tightness and uh you can't sleep no I want to sleep I feel tired but you get things on your mind needs yes things are buring you know you can't just go up the stress and say off that's right I'll see you at 8 in the morning I'll get up you make sure you snooze your alarm but you know as we would begin to just just look to the Lord sometimes I've had it where it's man it's been days and weeks and things and I'm W Lord I I commit this in your hand I I don't know how to solve this I don't know how to go about this and sometimes it isn't just one thing it you know working with that of the church and and things but also family and you're seeing all the seeing different things and things sometimes can just compound you you can't it's almost like it's a mixture I mean you to try to sort it out it's almost like that junk drawer in the kitchen you know it's called The Catch All it catches pizza coupons from two years ago and you know it has things no my wife's not that bad but you understand y'all yall know what I'm talking about it's like a catch all right and it can build up within us Y and it starts to affect us then you don't sleep sure right and let's just be honest get our angel wings out of here right I don't care you can say well I don't need much sleep we'll try to we'll ask the people you've showed your teeth to if whether you need that much sleep or not let's let's be honest sometimes we look and we're looking at things and we think my goodness what's going on on the job is everybody lost their mind and and everything and here we are we're just moving into those Realms like that and you know what it is stress tension and it's affected even the natural sleep and the scripture tells us he giveth his beloved rest one of the greatest greatest greatest properties of healing is sleep what a type of the Holy Ghost there's nothing greater than the rest of the Holy Spirit you might say well brother Samuel why do we experience those things in this life why do we still experience in stress if we're standing as Believers because this right here has not yet been redeemed and sometimes we in our mind we're looking at things of how to make things come together and you know what it's all then a process where we have to move into that place and it takes God by his grace to help us to say Lord I want to commit this into your hands let's just be honest sometimes we even need we need the help right there to say Lord give me what I need to be able to put it in your [Music] hands help me Lord and we have access as Sons and Daughters of God for he said I am your peace yes right and we'll find it affects our appetites oh yeah you just don't your T food don't taste the same and yeah it just I mean when when you're not feeling well I'm talking about sometimes emotionally nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing seems the same you can be setting and yet you're so distant right true trying to work through different things you say what's needed healing healing oh I I don't need appe peal I'm not against I'm not against medicine but what we need is Lord I Need Your Peace Lord father I need to feel your feathers around me right now Hallelujah I need to feel Lord your feathers I need to feel the wings of Jehovah Eagle around my life right now Lord I need to feel your presence Lord amen I need to hear from you Lord I need healing Lord prise the Lord Hall let me try to bring this down on this brother Bram is praying he says our heavenly father we bring to you this great line of sick people God just than many of these in here I trust that every one of them are your children born of the spirit washed in the blood and filled with the Holy Ghost ready for the coming and Satan can't get to them that way to make them sin he can't get them to make them doubt your word is wrong then go ahead and follow it just to the letter but then he tries to come along and afflict their body because he knows that their bodies still sin but their soul is saved their bodies got to go back to the dust but their soul goes to God so he tries to afflict that part what he can right notice that part what he can right there's only one place in your being that is off limits that Satan cannot even put Footprints there right that's your soul if you let him in your spirit it'll route that Spirit he can get that spirit all twisted around all Tor up and then he'll start going and try to haunt at that seal the prophet used these words
