[35:04] different ones you make the effort to be
[35:06] here to support the young people I want
[35:08] to say thank you I've tried to reach out
[35:10] in different ones and just to commend
[35:12] that and because that to me is very
[35:14] important uh it's things that uh we want
[35:17] to we want to see and we want to
[35:19] encourage and I want to say God bless
[35:21] you thank you for that amen I know the
[35:23] young people really appreciate that too

[35:34] they ask uh we've had them you know
[35:36] where they're driving across the state
[35:38] to be here and uh they they want to be
[35:41] here but we want to be part of that to
[35:43] create an atmosphere you know brother
[35:45] brand tells us he said that uh you may
[35:47] not be the prophet but you might be the
[35:49] minstrel that we're just to bring the
[35:52] spirit of God down that the Lord can
[35:54] begin to move and that's what we're
[35:56] interested in because that's what this
[35:58] message came to bring us is a reality of
[36:00] a living God yes sir that is not just
[36:03] something that is what we know by letter
[36:06] but we know a living God who lives and
[36:08] operates in us and through our lives a
[36:11] real relationship and so we we thank God
[36:14] for that and I want to say God bless you
[36:17] let's uh prepare let's turn into the
[36:19] word of the Lord tonight I want to say
[36:22] musicians thank you and and it's good to
[36:24] have different ones back and

[36:36] been it hasn't just been here I'll I'll
[36:37] say this to you um I didn't mention this
[36:41] I don't think on Sunday but it was quite
[36:44] quite uh astounding that when I went my
[36:46] wife sent me out for the
[36:48] supplies because by God's grace at least
[36:50] as far as I know I didn't get sick but I
[36:53] get so I'm the supply
[36:55] Runner and I go to the the story I show
[36:57] up at Myers and you know she's got the
[36:59] list of all the stuff you get for when
[37:00] you're not feeling well you know
[37:02] popsicles Box chicken noodle soup and
[37:04] all that stuff you know so I go to the
[37:07] chicken noodle soup aisle you know and I
[37:09] look in there and uh the the Shelf now
[37:13] we're not talking Walmart we're talking
[37:14] Myers Myers stocks it was it was empty
[37:18] and so my wife I said honey every shelf
[37:21] with the chicken noodle is empty I said
[37:24] so this isn't just us I said this is all
[37:27] around and it it truly has been all
[37:29] around the area I know that uh brother
[37:32] um Trevor and them and brother Nathan
[37:35] they've they had it uh right before I
[37:38] think right before Christmas or right
[37:39] coming through Christmas and then right
[37:41] after yeah yeah so it's just a presence
[37:45] but not the kind of presence you're
[37:46] looking for you
[37:48] know so but we thank the Lord for his
[37:50] mercies you know it's just reminders
[37:52] we're here in these bodies and we're
[37:54] just passing through and uh you know so
[37:57] we just thank the Lord for his mercy and
[37:59] strengthening us and bringing us back
[38:01] together his touch and uh so let's look
[38:04] here in in the scriptures in verse 13 I
[38:06] want to go a little bit further we we
[38:10] just finished out the part there on
[38:12] looking at in his hands and the right
[38:15] hand and the left hand of God uh I want
[38:17] to look here in verse
[38:19] 13 job sorry Job chapter 23 did I not
[38:23] say that I didn't say it ah we should
[38:27] have had eye contact because if you
[38:28] would have just said yeah you said it
[38:31] then we could have you know either given
[38:32] Brother Ray demerits or tardy or put him
[38:35] in the
[38:39] corner Job chapter
[38:42] 23:3 I have it right here in front of me
[38:44] sorry about
[38:45] that you all are gracious to
[38:49] me so Job chapter
[38:52] 23 and verse
[38:55] 13 job said but he is in one mind and
[39:00] who can turn him and what his soul
[39:03] desireth even that he doeth for he
[39:08] performeth the thing that is appointed
[39:11] for me thank and many such things are
[39:14] with him therefore am I troubled at his
[39:18] presence now I want you to notice these
[39:20] words therefore am I troubled at his
[39:23] presence when I consider means to ponder
[39:27] or think I am afraid of him for God
[39:31] maketh my heart soft and the almighty
[39:34] troubleth me because I was not cut off
[39:38] before the darkness neither hath he
[39:41] covered the darkness from my face and i'
[39:45] just like to just speak to you here just
[39:48] a few moments we'll start into it here
[39:50] tonight but on the thought of having the
[39:53] right perception having the right
[39:57] perception so let's just bow our heads
[39:59] in a word of prayer tonight if you have
[40:02] a need on your heart just make it known
[40:04] to the Lord and let's just invite him to
[40:06] come and just just speak to us let's
[40:08] pray for one another Heavenly Father
[40:11] Lord we are just so thankful for this
[40:14] privilege that you've granted us Lord
[40:16] thank you for Lord just touching Lord my
[40:19] brothers and sisters Lord different ones
[40:21] Lord as you're still moving Lord God
[40:23] upon the bodies Lord of different ones
[40:26] and in their Spirit Lord I pray that God
[40:29] for every one of these requests Lord
[40:31] father from cancer Lord to sickness Lord
[40:35] from the flu or other Lord infirmities
[40:38] we're thankful Lord that you are the
[40:40] Lord that Health all our diseases and we
[40:43] rest in that Lord as your children it is
[40:46] our bread Lord and we want to say thank
[40:48] you Lord and we ask that God tonight
[40:51] that you would just help us together
[40:53] Lord that we could just be one unit Lord
[40:56] that the spirit of God would just take
[40:58] control Lord say what needs to be said
[41:01] Lord and just let me to know Lord when
[41:03] it's been enough and ween just want to
[41:05] be obedient to you Lord whatever the
[41:08] path and channel that you would have us
[41:09] to go in that's what we want to do
[41:12] father we ask that you'll just minister
[41:14] to our hearts now in Jesus precious name
[41:17] amen amen God bless you as you're being
[41:19] seated
[41:21] tonight I just looking at this some time
[41:24] ago and that thought struck me on on
[41:28] perception and when you
[41:31] consider uh the word perception it's a
[41:34] way of
[41:35] regarding understanding or interpreting
[41:39] something it's a mental impression of
[41:42] something and I'm certain that we have
[41:46] all um no doubt been at a point in time
[41:50] where we've had um a perception about
[41:54] something and maybe sometimes we've had
[41:56] a perception that we thought for sure
[41:59] that our perception was as it were thus
[42:02] sayith the Lord and then we find out
[42:06] come to the place to realize my
[42:08] perception was not
[42:11] right and we can understand that there
[42:14] are things that as a Believer this is
[42:16] something as a Believer is that we as
[42:19] Sons and Daughters of God are led by the
[42:21] spirit of God there's some there's
[42:24] things about our life to where that we
[42:26] even no matter where how far you've come
[42:29] in your journey you know never to put a
[42:32] period on God and even in situations
[42:35] that sometimes where we don't have a
[42:37] definitive we might think and a lot of
[42:39] times we can think maybe we understand
[42:42] or know what's going on but like we
[42:44] looked at here for multiple parts that
[42:47] job himself did not know and still even
[42:51] in the portion of scripture we're
[42:52] reading here he job does not come to
[42:54] really understand till it gets clear to
[42:57] the end and God lets him know that he's
[43:00] been bringing job through a process the
[43:03] whole time and so job when we're looking
[43:06] at this of having the right perception
[43:08] it truly when we want to we always want
[43:11] to have the right perception that's the
[43:13] desire of our life but uh you know when
[43:16] you have sometimes the the perception
[43:19] and if it's not just exactly right it
[43:22] can have an effect Upon Our Lives you
[43:24] can have a perception you know sometimes
[43:26] of maybe how you think you know a person
[43:28] thinks about you or feels about you and
[43:31] they haven't even said anything like
[43:33] that at all but yet you'll look at
[43:35] things and and if you'll study things
[43:37] well I'm looking at body language and
[43:39] I'm looking at this and you know if
[43:41] you're not careful and you start
[43:43] entertaining that very long you'll start
[43:45] acting differently towards that person
[43:49] just based on your perception that's
[43:51] right and so we understand this is
[43:53] important and it's God's desire there's
[43:55] no way that you and I could actually
[43:57] have the right perception even
[44:00] concerning the things that are around us
[44:02] we could not even have the right
[44:03] perception of God had God himself not
[44:07] come and made himself known to you and I
[44:10] in a personal way and I want you to
[44:12] notice that every time that when job
[44:15] when here back and forth with elifas
[44:17] bildad and each of them the difference
[44:20] is even when job here in the midst of
[44:22] what he's expressing job is expressing
[44:25] that he knows God as a person I know him
[44:30] he when he had the way that God would
[44:32] would speak to him God maketh my heart
[44:35] he maketh my heart soft he is of one
[44:37] mind and who can turn him and he
[44:40] performthe job it's such a it's such a
[44:43] difference when you know God as a real
[44:47] living person and you know for a
[44:50] Believer let me just drop back on this
[44:51] for a moment as a Believer we are not
[44:54] required to understand everything but
[44:57] what we what we need what we have to
[45:00] understand God gives it to us as we have
[45:03] need of it and these are the times and
[45:05] moments in our life just like when
[45:07] brother Brandon would tell us in the
[45:08] message Shalom and he would refer back
[45:10] to the things that took place in his
[45:12] life with little Sharon Rose and hope
[45:15] and and brother Bram says I learned he
[45:17] said at that moment he said down through
[45:19] this journey that things that I could
[45:21] not understand to put my hand in his
[45:24] hand and trust him
[45:26] I think that's the greatest compliment
[45:27] that we can do is when we don't know
[45:29] what to do what's most important is to
[45:32] trust him because he knows what he's
[45:34] doing and so when I read this here with
[45:36] job you see you see things you know
[45:39] coming out of job that would be
[45:41] expressions and I I I think I've
[45:43] mentioned this before that when you read
[45:45] through the Book of Job to me it's
[45:46] almost like there's eruptions of Faith
[45:49] Like a volcano from down deep within
[45:51] that you'll look and say Here's this man
[45:53] saying this but then there's something
[45:55] that said in the midst of it that you
[45:57] know it's coming from somewhere deep
[45:59] within him and that's a part that within
[46:02] us that even when brother Bram himself
[46:04] standing there and his little girl was
[46:07] was being taken and his wife was being
[46:09] taken and brother brandham tells us he
[46:11] says it like this he says when God
[46:13] wouldn't talk to me he said then Satan
[46:15] moved right up next to me and Satan
[46:18] began to talk to me and want to tell me
[46:21] and went through a whole Litany of
[46:23] things to where that even brother ra
[46:26] said his thoughts he said he said I
[46:28] began to think about that and he said
[46:31] every bit of reasoning was going right
[46:34] along with him and saying that's the
[46:36] truth that's the
[46:39] truth he says I was about ready to say
[46:43] if that's the way he's going to be
[46:45] that's he said but there was something
[46:47] that come from somewhere deep down
[46:50] inside of
[46:51] me and I tell you that's the anchor and
[46:54] the hope of a believer is a real
[46:57] relationship with God to where that even
[47:00] in the times that our reasoning has
[47:03] given way when our reasoning itself and
[47:06] we look back and say how did I even
[47:08] entertain that thought how did I even
[47:10] maybe to express something in this in
[47:13] this way uh but then there's something
[47:16] that's down there that's an anchor
[47:18] that's more real than any situation it's
[47:23] more real than anything else around us
[47:25] there's no other way to explain it but
[47:29] God and so when I think of this of how
[47:32] the effect that job even when he would
[47:34] say in job 13 and verse 15 listen these
[47:38] very familiar words to us but job would
[47:40] say though he slay me yet will I trust
[47:45] him I will maintain my own ways shall be
[47:50] my salvation
[47:52] that's where did that come from deep
[47:55] down
[47:56] [Applause]
[47:57] within Glory he also shall be my
[48:00] salvation for an hypocrite shall not
[48:03] come before him amen think about this
[48:06] that here is job standing with such a a
[48:09] true Revelation which the prophet would
[48:12] let us a GL give us a glimpse into it in
[48:15] an age remember brother Brandon was
[48:16] being told by so many people of we got
[48:19] to get the translation right we got to
[48:21] understand the words right we got to do
[48:22] this right brother R said they've been
[48:23] arguing about this for ages
[48:26] he said what is needed is a fresh
[48:29] Revelation from the spirit of
[48:32] God because we don't need thoughts of
[48:36] man we needed God's
[48:39] thoughts and God knew what you and I
[48:42] would need in this
[48:44] hour and God would bring such a Clarity
[48:48] to you and I that we could have by the
[48:51] grace of God the right perception of the
[48:54] day of the hour of the events that we
[48:56] see taking place around us do you
[48:59] realize how blessed you are to have that
[49:02] understanding there's people I just
[49:04] walked by brush shoulders with here this
[49:06] week and they were standing around and
[49:08] saying I don't understand where all this
[49:10] transgender stuff I don't understand
[49:12] with these things I don't understand why
[49:14] why this is why can't things go back to
[49:16] how it was in World you know before
[49:17] World War II and you know there's a lot
[49:20] of people seeing it and I just say it
[49:22] like this those things like that is not
[49:24] necessarily the majority but you have
[49:27] people wondering and looking what's
[49:29] taking place but we understand it's
[49:32] seeds that's been sown that is coming to
[49:37] fruition right there are seeds that was
[49:40] swn clear back uh even before the 1900s
[49:44] when you study the feminist movement it
[49:46] goes clear back there I studied that
[49:48] some time before and in depth and
[49:50] bringing it up and there are things
[49:52] seeds but it was it scripture that is
[49:55] has already been prophesied over this
[49:58] generation prophecy can't fail and I
[50:02] thank God that God would give us Grace
[50:04] because with having the right perception
[50:07] then it affects us in our lives in our
[50:10] walk before God and so the most
[50:14] important thing this is why brother Bram
[50:16] could say the most important thing is he
[50:19] says job andam didn't even have a
[50:21] written bible but he said the most
[50:22] important thing we know the stars and so
[50:24] forth but he said they knew God by
[50:26] Revelation and that's the most important
[50:29] thing amen that's what's more important
[50:32] than being able to explain and listen
[50:34] friends I believe we ought to be in the
[50:35] word of God I believe we should Avail
[50:38] listen there are men that gave their
[50:40] lives so this could be put in our
[50:43] hands I believe that I I believe there's
[50:46] anything maybe this a side note but
[50:47] we'll drop it in free I believe if
[50:49] there's something that even this year
[50:51] let it become a habit in your life if
[50:54] it's something to aware that you know
[50:56] even of the reading of the word of God
[50:59] praying over the word of God getting
[51:01] into the message of the hour and and
[51:03] don't set unrealistic goals like I'm
[51:05] going to I'm going to read the whole
[51:06] Book of Leviticus on this coming
[51:08] Thursday no just look there's even plans
[51:10] out there that'll break it down for
[51:13] you and just so you don't think I'm
[51:15] overshooting I've been using a plan for
[51:18] years you know why so I don't get
[51:19] sidetracked and start
[51:22] studying it's a truth all it takes is
[51:24] one little moment but I I want that time
[51:27] I want that time if there's something
[51:28] I'll make a little note I'll come back
[51:30] to that when I'm done right here because
[51:32] I want to Avail myself in the word of
[51:35] God and I think that's that's something
[51:38] that we all have even an access to and
[51:41] may God help us to do that brother BR
[51:43] says when he starts out for the new year
[51:46] he says in this is revelation series for
[51:48] the new year he says you know he says
[51:50] let's make it a habit of getting into
[51:52] our Bibles amen he said let's make it a
[51:54] habit of praying he said you know and he
[51:56] talks about how you establish habits I
[51:59] mean we've all come up with habits
[52:01] sometimes we can get into bad habits you
[52:03] know you can get into everybody says oh
[52:05] I I got to change my eating habits we
[52:07] got to change and it's so easy to get in
[52:09] certain
[52:11] habits
[52:13] right so God may God help us so don't
[52:16] let the devil condemn you when you're
[52:18] trying to set up a new habit and a good
[52:21] habit don't make the enemy make you feel
[52:23] like that oh this is just FL FL L well
[52:25] sure I have to use my flesh to open the
[52:27] Bible and I'm going to read the word of
[52:30] God yeah I need to borrow my hands yes I
[52:32] have to use my mind I'm going to open
[52:33] the word of God but then we know the
[52:37] enemy's tactics yes I have to do these
[52:40] things I may have to say you know what
[52:42] I'm going to move right through it and
[52:43] maybe you have maybe you have somebody
[52:45] read it to you while you're while you're
[52:46] looking at it Whatever It Is Just Avail
[52:50] yourself in the word of God the prophet
[52:52] tell us he said no believer is more
[52:54] strong
[52:56] longer than his knowledge of and his
[52:59] adherence to the pure word of
[53:03] God so good so it's something to where
[53:07] job could have such a revelation of
[53:09] where he was standing with God that he
[53:12] could discern when his friends were
[53:15] coming around and accusing him you see
[53:18] this just wasn't people who were off the
[53:20] street passing by but these are people
[53:23] who knew Job they had actually watched
[53:26] job in
[53:27] action where job said remember in one
[53:30] place he said I'm now a byword among the
[53:32] people at one time I was a Tabet in
[53:34] other words job was one they sought for
[53:37] to come and wisdom and job would give
[53:38] them words of
[53:40] encouragement now when I look at this in
[53:43] in spite of all of that where job was
[53:45] standing and able to discern that and
[53:48] withstand all of that yet and with
[53:51] having such a grip on God but yet his
[53:55] perception about what was taking place
[53:58] let me just read a few scriptures I've
[54:00] read from some of these places here
[54:02] before but let's just let me just take a
[54:03] few words of job here in job 9:1 he said
[54:07] Lo he goeth by me and I see him not he
[54:10] passeth on also but I perceive him not
[54:13] remember he's a prophet and God's not re
[54:15] not God has not given job inspiration to
[54:18] understand what's going on that's right
[54:20] and the prophet said that's causing him
[54:22] to
[54:23] worry behold he taketh away who can
[54:26] hinder him who will say unto him what
[54:29] doest thou if God will not withdraw his
[54:32] anger the proud helpers do stoop under
[54:35] him you see his
[54:37] perception for he breakthe with the
[54:40] Tempest and multipli my wounds without
[54:44] cause he will not suffer me to take my
[54:47] breath but filth me with bitterness let
[54:50] him take his Rod away from me and let
[54:53] not his ter his fear terrify by me then
[54:55] would I speak and not fear him but it is
[54:58] not so with me job 108 thine hands
[55:03] speaking to the Lord thine hands have
[55:05] made me and fashioned me together round
[55:08] about yet thou dust destroy
[55:13] me here's a man that has a grip on
[55:17] God but his
[55:19] perception of what is taking place is
[55:23] wrong you see friends that's why that's
[55:26] why that anchor on the inside is so much
[55:28] greater because when our thinking is
[55:31] wrong that seal that cannot be
[55:36] broken let me just put it this way it's
[55:39] temper
[55:43] prooof Hallelujah that that makes me
[55:46] want to have a little spell right here
[55:48] and
[55:49] rejoice job
[55:52] 16:11 God hath delivered me to the
[55:55] ungodly and turn me over into the hands
[55:57] of the wicked you know there's a measure
[55:59] of truth to this oh yes there's a
[56:01] measure of Truth to that scripture I
[56:02] just read God hath
[56:05] delivered but not the way job's thinking
[56:08] I was at ease but he hath broken me
[56:11] aunder he all he hath also taken me up
[56:14] by my neck and shaken me to pieces and
[56:17] set me up for his mark his archers
[56:19] Compass me round about he cleaveth my
[56:22] rains suer and do not spare he porth out
[56:25] my gall upon the ground he breakthe with
[56:28] breach upon breach he runneth upon me
[56:31] like a
[56:32] giant job
[56:34] 196 know now that God hath overthrown me
[56:40] and hath compassed me with his net a net
[56:43] meaning I can't get
[56:45] out behold I cry out wrong but I'm not
[56:49] heard I cry aloud but there's no
[56:52] judgment he hath fenced up my way way
[56:55] that I cannot pass and he hath set
[56:58] darkness in my paths he hath stripped me
[57:01] of my glory and taken the crown from my
[57:04] head he hath destroyed me on every side
[57:08] and I am gone and my hope hath he
[57:11] removed like a tree wow he hath also
[57:14] kindled his wrath against me and he
[57:17] counted me unto him as one of his
[57:19] enemies he hath put my brethren far from
[57:23] me and mine acquaint ANS wife children
[57:27] Maids on and on are verily
[57:31] estranged from
[57:33] me this is Job's
[57:37] perception now I don't know about you
[57:39] but I I will just say it this way God
[57:41] had this recorded for
[57:45] me God had this recorded for me because
[57:48] this this whole this whole part as we've
[57:51] been looking at this in the Book of Job
[57:53] it really comes into a whole expanse
[57:55] that even speaks of the whole coming of
[57:58] redeeming work of the Lord Jesus it
[58:00] speaks of an end time work as well and
[58:03] how God will unfold things but yet here
[58:05] is job no why look God knows what's
[58:08] true why didn't God just break in on any
[58:11] one of these other chapters even right
[58:13] at the beginning and say job job ho ho
[58:16] ho you've got it all wrong
[58:19] right why didn't even God send somebody
[58:23] job's way to encourage him and say job
[58:28] you're thinking wrong
[58:31] right but his perception God was
[58:35] permitting it job doesn't know this and
[58:38] I know we've rehearsed this over and
[58:40] over but it's very fitting job does not
[58:44] know that this situation taking place it
[58:48] was not
[58:49] Satan calling God's
[58:52] attention it was God saying have you
[58:55] considered
[58:57] job let let let me tell you about my
[59:01] boy right probably when we look at that
[59:04] right now we're thinking Lord I want to
[59:07] be I I want to be in your um you know on
[59:09] the front of your refrigerator I want to
[59:10] be in the bragging but if it's like this
[59:13] then I prefer brother Bill I prefer
[59:15] Brother Ray I prefer I prefer my
[59:23] brother right you see we would our
[59:26] thinking that's why job job doesn't have
[59:28] any thought oh God was bragging on me no
[59:31] he doesn't know and think of it God
[59:33] didn't even step in of all these
[59:36] times and say hey hey you're thinking
[59:40] wrong you know why God was wanting to
[59:43] show the confidence that he had in a
[59:46] Believer and what I'm talking about a
[59:49] Believer was not the Flesh of job it was
[59:53] that part that came out out of
[59:55] God that word is what God had confidence
[1:00:00] in that's why the prophet in this age
[1:00:04] could go in with such Clarity in the
[1:00:07] message Victory Day and say when God
[1:00:09] allows a test to come your way he is
[1:00:12] showing he has confidence in
[1:00:18] you God letting us know
[1:00:22] this listen to this listen in the impact
[1:00:25] of this this perception familiar place
[1:00:28] out of three kinds of Believers brother
[1:00:30] B says as long as Satan can make him
[1:00:35] believe that his sickness was his God
[1:00:38] doing it he had
[1:00:41] job
[1:00:42] whipped now I don't matter what side of
[1:00:45] the Mason diction you're on whipped
[1:00:46] whooped it's the same
[1:00:48] thing beat up beat down you you we we
[1:00:51] get it right he was whipped yes
[1:00:55] because Satan had been talking to him
[1:00:58] now think of this is to me the parallel
[1:01:01] Satan could stand there and cause job to
[1:01:04] look at situations and say God's doing
[1:01:07] this to you God's against you and yet
[1:01:09] job could stand there when all the other
[1:01:12] accusations were coming and job knew I
[1:01:15] have not there's not one thing
[1:01:17] unconfessed I have made my confession
[1:01:20] there I stand on the burnt offering
[1:01:21] there's not one thing that God has asked
[1:01:24] me to do but I haven't done it that even
[1:01:26] means when he has brought conviction and
[1:01:29] I've repented of my wrongs there's
[1:01:31] nothing
[1:01:32] hallu
[1:01:34] nothing pise God and he could stand
[1:01:36] Resolute like that but here Satan's
[1:01:40] coming and wanting to make him
[1:01:43] think I tell you our
[1:01:46] thoughts and our mind this is why when
[1:01:49] brother Brandon would preach that
[1:01:50] greatest battle ever
[1:01:52] fought and he would Minister on that
[1:01:55] sure he's speaking to us to get that
[1:01:58] battle down on the inside that war like
[1:02:01] we're looking at on Sunday get that war
[1:02:04] ceased but then out from there it comes
[1:02:07] through every other channel it's working
[1:02:10] through every phase and every part of
[1:02:12] our life this is why brother BR says
[1:02:14] even for those that sick and he refers
[1:02:15] to a situation in a tabernacle he says
[1:02:17] there is Satan he said and he'll sit
[1:02:19] right there in front of you in your mind
[1:02:20] and say you can't be well it's not for
[1:02:23] you you're not going to get well God's
[1:02:26] not going to meet your need that's you
[1:02:28] say well here I am we're the Bride of
[1:02:31] Jesus Christ Satan does not look at our
[1:02:33] church doors and say oh guess I can't go
[1:02:36] in there no the enemy comes and he likes
[1:02:39] to try to distract your mind that's
[1:02:42] right it's why he'll try to take your
[1:02:44] mind out there then he'll try to take
[1:02:45] certain things of the word and say
[1:02:47] that's not
[1:02:49] you why he knows if I can just get to
[1:02:52] change that that perception a little bit
[1:02:54] because the power is in receiving the
[1:02:57] word of God remember it's not our
[1:02:59] thoughts that has life in it it's God's
[1:03:01] word by taking that into our mind that
[1:03:05] is what has life that's right yes sir
[1:03:08] and that has life and that's what we
[1:03:10] want to receive that's why we come to
[1:03:11] the house of God lord I want to receive
[1:03:13] your thoughts that's what I want I want
[1:03:16] his thoughts if I've got thoughts right
[1:03:18] now that Lord that I'm not thinking
[1:03:20] about something the right way or maybe
[1:03:22] I'm a little low in my thoughts Lord I
[1:03:24] got an expectation your thoughts are
[1:03:26] higher than my
[1:03:28] thoughts and as a Believer as a son and
[1:03:30] daughter of God we are led by the spirit
[1:03:32] of God if I'm in a valley he'll lead me
[1:03:37] out he's faithful he's a Shepherd amen
[1:03:40] that's
[1:03:42] true ra goes on in that same paragraph
[1:03:45] and said it was it wasn't God doing it
[1:03:47] it was Satan doing it the very next
[1:03:49] paragraph watch this I love this he says
[1:03:51] and the same thing today he'll try to
[1:03:54] tell you these trials and things is your
[1:03:58] God trying to put punishment upon
[1:04:01] you same devil we've got the same
[1:04:03] adversary brother Brian called him a
[1:04:05] sleo
[1:04:06] foot like the one sister said he's a
[1:04:08] good
[1:04:10] adversary It Isn't So brother said no
[1:04:12] sir he said it's Satan doing it and God
[1:04:16] permitting it to temper
[1:04:19] you to make you see look not to make God
[1:04:23] see to make you see if you are tied to
[1:04:27] this Earth by the Earth cares or whether
[1:04:29] your treasure is in heaven for wherever
[1:04:32] your treasure is there you are also your
[1:04:35] heart is where your Treasures
[1:04:38] are so you see it it ain't about are you
[1:04:41] hearing me now it ain't about what the
[1:04:43] devil says you judge it from your heart
[1:04:47] where is your heart my heart is he is my
[1:04:50] God I am his son I am his daughter I am
[1:04:54] am is she I want to please him more than
[1:04:56] anything else then bring that thought
[1:04:59] and make it bow subject to the name of
[1:05:03] the Lord Jesus Christ that's written
[1:05:06] across your
[1:05:09] heart Hallelujah to think of it in this
[1:05:12] way oh yeah we understand that
[1:05:14] correction can come as Believers and as
[1:05:17] what what believer really what of which
[1:05:19] one of us when things come do we not
[1:05:22] evaluate our life if you don't you
[1:05:24] should it should not just be assumed
[1:05:26] that everything that comes our way well
[1:05:28] this is a trial and and God's making
[1:05:30] something God God will not waste time
[1:05:32] that's true but sometimes there's things
[1:05:35] that can be called trials that aren't
[1:05:37] trials they're simply moments of
[1:05:39] Correction where we've gotten off the
[1:05:42] path and God's trying to help us to see
[1:05:44] hey wait a minute start out with this
[1:05:46] ver what brother BR very simple and be
[1:05:48] certain of God every time over and over
[1:05:50] what did Brother bam tell us one
[1:05:52] principle go back and and remember as
[1:05:54] that little lady came out she came out
[1:05:57] and there was two sticks and here when
[1:05:59] she came and got them two sticks she and
[1:06:01] herself the way that even she had been
[1:06:03] feeling and looking at things brother
[1:06:05] Ram tells us like this goes into it she
[1:06:07] had been praying God had been silent it
[1:06:10] seem seemed like God had not been
[1:06:11] hearing her prayer and she walks out
[1:06:13] there in the yard picks up those sticks
[1:06:15] and as she picks up them sticks to make
[1:06:17] that cake here she hears a voice say
[1:06:21] make me a cake first oh first she had no
[1:06:27] idea that God had sent his Prophet down
[1:06:31] there and she was a vessel that was
[1:06:35] going to feed the
[1:06:37] prophet God said I've commanded a widow
[1:06:40] woman to sustain thee she had no idea of
[1:06:44] that but what principle are we talking
[1:06:46] about brother Bram would tell us and be
[1:06:48] certain of God you go and you evaluate
[1:06:50] your life evaluate your life well how do
[1:06:51] I evaluate my life where do I even begin
[1:06:54] begin and look at seeing who and what is
[1:06:57] really first place in your life if you
[1:07:00] can look and esteem not just by we say
[1:07:03] but by our actions and all that we're
[1:07:05] doing if God is truly first in our life
[1:07:09] amen then we can judge it by
[1:07:12] that but if there's things like let's
[1:07:14] say it don't matter about coming to the
[1:07:15] house of God it don't matter about
[1:07:17] praying don't matter about reading it
[1:07:18] don't matter anything things like that
[1:07:19] then I would start right there and say
[1:07:21] Lord if there's things coming my way
[1:07:24] instead of me calling into a trial I
[1:07:26] need to First examine have I been
[1:07:28] putting all of God's word first you see
[1:07:31] it isn't leaving it out here to where we
[1:07:33] can just shape it up and shape God to
[1:07:36] make him any way that we want to make
[1:07:38] him that is not the perception that God
[1:07:41] has given you and I Jesus Christ has
[1:07:43] been evidently set before us so it's
[1:07:47] important that in our lives that we
[1:07:49] evaluate everything and if he's not
[1:07:52] first and I think we need need to make
[1:07:54] him first if somehow you've got things
[1:07:56] out of line you better get it right back
[1:07:59] in order the prophet will say it two
[1:08:01] times in the message that the law of
[1:08:03] overcoming is God
[1:08:06] first your family second yes somehow
[1:08:09] sometimes I know that family gets in
[1:08:11] front of God we get under this that
[1:08:14] we're going to be you know the
[1:08:14] philanthropist and the Samaritan and you
[1:08:17] know I'm just going to I I'm just going
[1:08:18] to love my family I don't need to go to
[1:08:20] the house of God I'm just going to no
[1:08:21] how you going to show them God and not
[1:08:23] come into the house of God you've got
[1:08:25] the order of overcoming wrong the
[1:08:28] prophet said God first family second and
[1:08:31] you
[1:08:33] last my Lord that's
[1:08:37] free but job this is this is you see
[1:08:39] it's things God doesn't complicate it
[1:08:41] it's us it's us God wants Fellowship God
[1:08:46] wants to walk with us live live in us he
[1:08:49] wants to talk with us God desires that
[1:08:53] because that's what we were brought here
[1:08:54] for now think of it job was actually as
[1:08:58] the prophet tells us he was whipped in
[1:09:00] his thoughts I don't know how the way
[1:09:02] the prophet just said it in such a way
[1:09:04] that I think it's it's simple for us to
[1:09:05] understand it he was whipped in his
[1:09:07] thoughts in other words he was defeated
[1:09:09] this is why you hear job expressing the
[1:09:12] things that he's already expressed in
[1:09:15] these verses of scripture this is no
[1:09:17] doubt why Peter in 1 Peter chapter 4:12
[1:09:20] even after Calvary Peter would write
[1:09:22] beloved think it not strange concerning
[1:09:27] the fiery trial which is to try you as
[1:09:31] though some strange thing happened unto
[1:09:34] you now I'm sure that we've got this
[1:09:37] memorized if we we we've got it
[1:09:39] memorized so much that we could probably
[1:09:40] put stars around borders on our house
[1:09:42] and we know this by heart but yet how
[1:09:45] many times when things come our way and
[1:09:47] I'm not talking about at first things
[1:09:49] can come our way and we think where in
[1:09:50] the world just coming from maybe I'll
[1:09:53] just preach to me okay I I'll try to say
[1:09:55] it and I'll turn around and try to
[1:09:56] receive it or or something but maybe
[1:09:58] it's just me but sometimes when you
[1:10:01] first look at certain things after you
[1:10:03] you've evaluated you look at it and we
[1:10:06] can and let's just be honest sometimes
[1:10:07] we get the feeling sorry for ourselves
[1:10:09] yes maybe maybe you don't but I do get
[1:10:11] the feeling sorry I don't want to go
[1:10:13] through this or what who wants to go
[1:10:14] through a test or a trial I mean I'm not
[1:10:17] looking for a signup sheet like
[1:10:18] testimonies and singing on Saturday
[1:10:20] night hey Lord I'll be the next one this
[1:10:22] week for a trial no sir buddy I know
[1:10:24] that God knows what trials I have need
[1:10:26] of I need his grace to bring me through
[1:10:29] what I'm dealing with right now I need
[1:10:31] that because God knows what he wants to
[1:10:33] mold and bring out of my life and God
[1:10:36] helped me in the meantime to have the
[1:10:38] right
[1:10:40] perception amen that's my desire not to
[1:10:42] think it's strange meaning to be
[1:10:45] surprised astonished at the novelty or
[1:10:47] the strangest of a thing to be shocked
[1:10:50] you know brother R would spend many time
[1:10:52] much time on this in the church Church
[1:10:53] ages of how he says the untutored
[1:10:56] believer struggles at some of these
[1:10:57] things and how that even he says that
[1:11:00] Israel would they thought about God's
[1:11:02] love and the ways that they thought
[1:11:04] about it what was it that that was
[1:11:06] hindering Israel was their thoughts
[1:11:09] about God's love brother Bram goes into
[1:11:11] it their perception of God's love was of
[1:11:14] a parental love but he says that's not
[1:11:18] that's not it his love is
[1:11:21] elective he says his proof of his love
[1:11:24] toward you is that he has chosen you and
[1:11:27] ordained you through the gospel through
[1:11:30] sanctification unto eternal life and he
[1:11:33] this I love this very next phrase he
[1:11:35] says so no matter what happens to you
[1:11:38] Hallelujah his love has already been
[1:11:41] shown to
[1:11:43] you so when the devil wants to question
[1:11:46] and put it to you that God doesn't love
[1:11:48] you God doesn't care about you I'm
[1:11:51] telling you God has already before the
[1:11:54] world God himself has exhibited and
[1:11:57] displayed his love God's sending a
[1:12:00] message it's not a chance that this
[1:12:03] message come across your pathway it was
[1:12:06] ordained for this moment it's not a
[1:12:08] coincidence that you've sat in services
[1:12:12] and God has so dealt so personally with
[1:12:15] your life it's not a
[1:12:18] coincidence it's a pre-planned moment I
[1:12:21] believe from the mind of God
[1:12:27] sometimes our thoughts about things cuz
[1:12:29] sometimes when we look at it brother B
[1:12:31] said we can get to thinking when we're
[1:12:33] going through the trials he said God's
[1:12:35] actually purging us and sometimes we get
[1:12:37] to thinking God's angry at
[1:12:40] us and I think there's a part of it I
[1:12:42] let me just say it like this it might
[1:12:43] seem kind of like an oxymoron but I
[1:12:45] think it's good that when as Believers
[1:12:48] we go back over and examine our life I
[1:12:50] think that's good I think it's good but
[1:12:52] I don't believe that that that as a
[1:12:53] Believer if you want to know where
[1:12:55] you're standing with God God doesn't
[1:12:57] play hide and
[1:12:59] seek you know why cuz he wants that
[1:13:02] fellowship with you more than anything
[1:13:04] so God don't play games if there's
[1:13:07] something that's got between you and him
[1:13:09] he is not looking at you as though you
[1:13:11] are the problem he is calling out the
[1:13:13] problem and letting you know as a son
[1:13:15] and daughter of God you don't have to
[1:13:17] let this remain here you've got
[1:13:19] authority over this now let's get this
[1:13:22] out of the way so we can set back
[1:13:25] together again
[1:13:27] Hallelujah right the prophet said that
[1:13:30] Dove coming back off the roost upon the
[1:13:33] lamb is that
[1:13:34] rightl oh my sure we we feel you know
[1:13:38] when you fail God or you failed or short
[1:13:40] coming I tell you you'd be in you'd be
[1:13:42] in a big trouble and a big mess if it
[1:13:44] didn't bother you you'd be in big
[1:13:47] trouble like what what was it brother
[1:13:48] Steven I thought it was beautiful how
[1:13:50] brother Steven brought that out here he
[1:13:51] says if you're interested how did he say
[1:13:53] something about if you're interested in
[1:13:54] a uh I don't want to bring disgrace to
[1:13:56] God's grace something like that and he
[1:13:58] says he said then I think you're in a
[1:14:00] good
[1:14:03] place amen yeah it was maybe we'll get
[1:14:06] him back here and have him preach it
[1:14:07] again it was so
[1:14:09] [Laughter]
[1:14:11] good but think about it all down through
[1:14:13] the scriptures look at how Abraham here
[1:14:16] here is Abraham he's just had a visit
[1:14:18] from Elohim praise God and here Abraham
[1:14:22] comes down
[1:14:23] once again in the midst of a pressure
[1:14:27] situation he goes down into another
[1:14:32] kingdom and here he is in a
[1:14:35] situation and he tells Sarah
[1:14:39] Sarah we're just going to you just let
[1:14:41] them know you're my
[1:14:45] sister seems like she's getting the
[1:14:47] short end of the
[1:14:51] deal she was was we could preach a
[1:14:54] family service on that one couldn't we
[1:14:56] but anyhow Abraham here's what Abraham
[1:14:59] says in verse 11 of Genesis 20 because
[1:15:02] when abamec asked him why did you do
[1:15:05] this why did you do this because I
[1:15:09] thought see his
[1:15:11] perception affected his
[1:15:14] actions that's so sometimes listen
[1:15:16] friends when people's actions and what
[1:15:18] what you see don't judge people
[1:15:21] altogether by their actions because you
[1:15:23] might be making a wrong perception just
[1:15:26] even based on their actions you may not
[1:15:30] know what that person is going through
[1:15:33] you may not know what path they try I'm
[1:15:36] not making excuses I'm just trying to
[1:15:38] say sometimes there's things we make
[1:15:40] perceptions about things and we don't
[1:15:43] know the background of the
[1:15:45] story that would help us to have a
[1:15:47] little bit more
[1:15:50] compassion hello I say God help
[1:15:54] us amen and amen because I thought
[1:15:58] surely the fear of God's not in this
[1:15:59] place he will slay me for my wife's sake
[1:16:02] hey there was some there was some spies
[1:16:04] that went over very familiar with this
[1:16:06] they went over to spy out the
[1:16:08] land and they got back over two of them
[1:16:11] had a good report but there was 10 of
[1:16:13] them that's right these boys had the
[1:16:16] wrong perception they came back over and
[1:16:18] they said in verse 33 we saw the Giants
[1:16:22] the sons of anic come of the Giants and
[1:16:24] we
[1:16:25] were in our own sight so then so when
[1:16:28] you would stop them did you ask them no
[1:16:32] you mean you made it sound like you went
[1:16:34] up on one of those pant legs of the
[1:16:37] giant what do you think of me I think
[1:16:40] you're a grasshopper thank
[1:16:42] you they didn't even talk to the
[1:16:47] Giants they didn't it was in their own
[1:16:49] sight sight meaning in their own mind
[1:16:53] they were already defeated in their own
[1:16:56] mind their perception of it instead of
[1:17:00] taking that and saying this is true
[1:17:02] these are some mighty big giants but
[1:17:05] what God has said is
[1:17:08] true God knew these Giants was going to
[1:17:10] be here can I preach for a moment God
[1:17:14] knew what he was getting into when he
[1:17:16] got a hold of your life he knew you
[1:17:18] before the foundation of the world
[1:17:20] brother B said he knew all your mistakes
[1:17:22] and yet he looked down and chose you God
[1:17:24] knew everything that he would work
[1:17:27] out brother B said all this was packed
[1:17:30] into me so God coming into me could
[1:17:33] bring it all
[1:17:35] out he not talking about all the
[1:17:37] righteousness packed in him he's talking
[1:17:39] about all the muck was packed in him
[1:17:42] that's right and God manifest his
[1:17:45] overcoming grace through your life
[1:17:48] Hallelujah that's amazing because yes
[1:17:51] though you're a part of a natural family
[1:17:52] tree but you're a part of the tree of
[1:17:54] life and that life putting forth another
[1:17:57] Branch it is shooting forth and
[1:17:59] manifesting His glory and victory
[1:18:01] through your life through every complex
[1:18:02] through every strain through every hold
[1:18:04] that's been down through your
[1:18:07] family 2 Kings
[1:18:11] 5:11 here was non non come to get some
[1:18:14] help I know we're familiar with this but
[1:18:16] he was wroth non you know he was
[1:18:19] expecting Elisha is going to come out
[1:18:21] and say oh great
[1:18:23] oh great warrior oh my and
[1:18:27] because
[1:18:29] Elisha did not read the text that he
[1:18:33] thought should have been read that night
[1:18:36] was not approaching things or and non
[1:18:40] said
[1:18:42] pH I don't know what in the world I'm
[1:18:44] going to
[1:18:45] do but you know what it was it was his
[1:18:48] thoughts you see how our thoughts
[1:18:51] sometimes we could think that our
[1:18:52] thoughts thoughts are so humble and yet
[1:18:56] non had a servant I don't know what that
[1:18:59] servant did maybe he dusted his shoes I
[1:19:01] don't know but God showed us its
[1:19:04] Simplicity to the word the servant looks
[1:19:07] at him what what what courage Rose in
[1:19:10] that servant to say hey hey hey hey hey
[1:19:12] hey hey wait a wait a minute wait a
[1:19:13] minute if he had asked you to do a great
[1:19:15] thing you'd have done it you'd had no
[1:19:18] problem with it think about it a servant
[1:19:21] but it shows just a simple simple
[1:19:24] Obedience of saying you know what my
[1:19:26] thoughts I'll get I forsake them Lord
[1:19:29] this is where my thoughts are on this
[1:19:30] but your thoughts are higher
[1:19:32] Lord and non himself submitted his own
[1:19:37] thoughts to God prise God you know your
[1:19:41] perception of God you know brother Brown
[1:19:43] would say it over and over it's to me I
[1:19:44] love this interesting study I've looked
[1:19:46] at it over and over at times but if you
[1:19:48] just type in the words I used to think I
[1:19:52] love love it brother Bram will go into
[1:19:55] the things that he used to think and
[1:19:59] you're familiar with one of the very one
[1:20:01] of the things that's very much mentioned
[1:20:03] brother Bram will say it over and over
[1:20:04] and that was brother Bram said I used to
[1:20:07] think I think I've got that quote
[1:20:09] Brianna hear you him let me just read it
[1:20:10] he says our God and Our Father who
[1:20:12] brought the love of our own being of
[1:20:14] your own being God I used to think you
[1:20:17] were angry with me but Jesus loved me
[1:20:21] see the conflict right but I've lived
[1:20:25] long enough to find out that Jesus was
[1:20:29] the very Heart Of God that his great
[1:20:31] heart so loved me that he gave his life
[1:20:34] for me to be a pritu for my sins and me
[1:20:38] guilty dirty Sinner and he loved me and
[1:20:41] he redeemed Me by his blessed love and
[1:20:43] give to me love for
[1:20:45] everyone Samuel why is that important to
[1:20:48] understand that you're not trying to
[1:20:50] please an Angry God who is saying ah you
[1:20:54] messed
[1:20:57] up no it's understand God
[1:21:01] himself Jesus was not the second person
[1:21:03] of the godhead it was God come down and
[1:21:08] become so much you and I that he took on
[1:21:11] Terms of
[1:21:13] Endearment Hallelujah to be called The
[1:21:16] Son of God he could be with a term of
[1:21:19] endearment to you and I brother
[1:21:23] friend a term of endearment God
[1:21:29] condescended so when you think of what
[1:21:31] God thinks about you right there God
[1:21:34] loves you God cares about you I don't
[1:21:38] care how many I don't care how many
[1:21:39] mistakes I don't care how many failures
[1:21:42] God's love is so much deeper it goes so
[1:21:45] much greater and God's love is there to
[1:21:48] override every fault every mistake and
[1:21:50] bring overcoming victory in that place
[1:21:53] in your life to where that you will
[1:21:55] narrowly look upon the Devil and say
[1:21:59] this is the man right
[1:22:04] Hallelujah a lot of areas where brother
[1:22:06] bam talked about and he used to think
[1:22:08] let me just kind of bring this down here
[1:22:10] on
[1:22:12] this sometimes even in our own
[1:22:15] minds we think somehow that we can Merit
[1:22:19] I guess going along with
[1:22:21] that Merit or earn God's
[1:22:25] favor somehow with things that we
[1:22:30] do remember brother Brandon would say it
[1:22:32] very clearly in this way he said some he
[1:22:35] said preach it as though it's salvation
[1:22:38] is Jesus plus Works he said but
[1:22:41] Salvation is of the lord it's Jesus
[1:22:47] alone works will follow your belief and
[1:22:53] the works that follow is the faith that
[1:22:56] is released to you to begin to
[1:22:59] rise it's Jesus
[1:23:03] alone now I'm me tell you how powerful
[1:23:05] that is brother Ram talks about these
[1:23:07] things being placed in himels some of
[1:23:10] these words and phrases even he talks
[1:23:13] about it in the message of how that
[1:23:15] there were certain songs that were taken
[1:23:18] away from the church of singing about
[1:23:20] the blood because they don't want a
[1:23:22] slaughterhouse religion let me tell you
[1:23:25] something singing is very important
[1:23:27] worship is very important that's why I'm
[1:23:30] just going to say that's why that all
[1:23:31] Christian singing and all all what's
[1:23:33] called Christian I don't believe that it
[1:23:35] is sometimes there's things that you
[1:23:37] begin to look at it and you'll hear
[1:23:39] things of a person who is defeated all
[1:23:42] the time we have not been ordained to be
[1:23:45] defeated all the
[1:23:47] time so what are you doing I'm listening
[1:23:50] for a message oh it don't have to be a
[1:23:52] song that's wrote by a message believer
[1:23:54] but as the message and receiving of
[1:23:56] thinking man's filter there are things
[1:23:58] that I can receive of songs that have
[1:24:01] been wrote that minister to me of who I
[1:24:04] am do you realize the benefit of them
[1:24:07] even writing those songs is about you
[1:24:09] and me because it is the anointing of
[1:24:12] the hour Charles Wesley was not the only
[1:24:15] one who wrote songs regarding the
[1:24:18] Methodist time there were others what is
[1:24:20] it it's God pouring out inspiration upon
[1:24:24] the age and it flows over onto the book
[1:24:26] of
[1:24:31] life now watch this let me just let me
[1:24:33] try try to bring this down here so we
[1:24:35] can may God help us to grasp a hold of
[1:24:37] this notice Matthew 6:7 Jesus said when
[1:24:41] you
[1:24:42] pray use not vain right
[1:24:48] repetitions as the Heathen do for they
[1:24:53] think that they shall be heard for their
[1:24:56] much
[1:24:57] speaking see this is why that anything
[1:25:00] that you're doing is trying I listen to
[1:25:04] try to gain favor with God if you're
[1:25:06] just doing it out of that measure
[1:25:08] instead of doing it because you love him
[1:25:12] this is what he asked me to do I may not
[1:25:15] understand it I may not even see the
[1:25:16] full value of
[1:25:18] it everybody with me there's things that
[1:25:20] even in my own Christian walk no doubt
[1:25:22] you're Christian walk we see the value
[1:25:25] of it it's more of a value to us now
[1:25:28] than it was when God first got a hold of
[1:25:30] our life certain things that we couldn't
[1:25:32] even understand why this or why that I
[1:25:34] didn't see the value in it but see God
[1:25:36] helps us to see eventually through our
[1:25:39] maturing the value in it amen right just
[1:25:43] like we see the value with getting to
[1:25:45] church early we begin to see the value
[1:25:47] of what it is to get into the song
[1:25:49] service we see the value of what it is
[1:25:51] to enter in and and say Yes Lord even
[1:25:53] when I don't feel like it I'm going to
[1:25:55] say yes Lord you're worthy of my praise
[1:25:57] I'm going to bring a sacrifice of praise
[1:25:58] sometimes it's not so much a sacrifice
[1:26:00] where I mean we're ready to go it's just
[1:26:02] like soon as they stand up here and if
[1:26:04] there's just a little hint of gasoline
[1:26:06] that comes by and it's
[1:26:07] like like that you know and then there's
[1:26:10] other times that my it might seem a
[1:26:12] little tight and so forth and even in
[1:26:14] your life there's my in my feelings I I
[1:26:17] don't feel maybe real good I don't feel
[1:26:19] like maybe praising but that's a time
[1:26:21] that we s
[1:26:22] sacrifice Lord you're
[1:26:25] worthy you're worthy my voice may not be
[1:26:28] there tonight or what but I want you to
[1:26:29] know Lord that I am here because you're
[1:26:35] worthy they think think about this you
[1:26:37] know and we look at this right here that
[1:26:39] sometimes it's the thought within
[1:26:41] itself as I said we sometimes have our
[1:26:45] own thoughts and our faults about things
[1:26:47] but let me say it you can't Merit
[1:26:49] anything from God it's not something you
[1:26:51] do to to Merit it from God no no he has
[1:26:55] freely given to us all things it's Faith
[1:26:59] to accept it Faith to to walk in it and
[1:27:03] to take it oh my so when the enemy comes
[1:27:07] you know it's like this let me just say
[1:27:09] it let's say here this week maybe you've
[1:27:11] had a week that you feel like man you've
[1:27:14] been bombarded and you feel like I
[1:27:16] hadn't had much take time this week
[1:27:18] maybe it been you've battled through
[1:27:20] your prayer life this week you've
[1:27:22] battled through read you've battled
[1:27:23] through a lot of things and then the
[1:27:25] enemy would like to get on your shoulder
[1:27:26] with come in here and saying well what
[1:27:28] good are you going to be in service
[1:27:30] that's good what good is it going to do
[1:27:33] you that's good and you know what you
[1:27:36] turn around and
[1:27:37] say it ain't about
[1:27:39] me it's about him He's
[1:27:44] Worthy he's
[1:27:49] worthy thank you
[1:27:51] Lord
[1:27:55] Oh Glory let me let me close on this one
[1:27:57] here out of perseverance we'll just
[1:27:59] close here tonight brother Bram says if
[1:28:02] you can find out what your place is in
[1:28:04] the plan of God even though you be sick
[1:28:08] and nearly dead you say I'm a Christian
[1:28:13] how could that be in the plan of God to
[1:28:15] be sick and nearly dead it might be in
[1:28:18] God's plan to heal you and give you a
[1:28:21] test testimony that will shake souls to
[1:28:24] the kingdom of God he lets those things
[1:28:28] happen maybe you had your ups and downs
[1:28:32] and the enemy scorching you from side to
[1:28:36] side it might have been that way but
[1:28:39] that's all in the plan of God look at
[1:28:43] job when he was afflicted sores all over
[1:28:45] him it was all in the plan of God but
[1:28:49] job to was perseverant because he knowed
[1:28:52] that he was keeping God's word nothing
[1:28:56] was going to bother
[1:28:57] him don't you love him yes oh yes God is
[1:29:03] faithful yes he is in all things yes he
[1:29:07] is I say Lord help
[1:29:09] us help me let's just stop there tonight
[1:29:12] help me to have the right
[1:29:15] perception that's what I'm trusting
[1:29:18] daily I'm trusting in in and you know as
[1:29:22] we're if we're standing on God's word
[1:29:24] that's what's most important is look
[1:29:26] back to that that God is first if God is
[1:29:29] first then we can stand right there and
[1:29:32] to Know You and I by God's grace have an
[1:29:36] Insight that job didn't have at this
[1:29:38] time job didn't understand that job God
[1:29:42] is making something out of your life
[1:29:45] he's he's molding he's shaping he's he's
[1:29:48] not he's not correcting you he's purging
[1:29:50] you job didn't have that
[1:29:52] understanding but it was to show you and
[1:29:55] I the strength of the Revelation just
[1:29:57] like it would be in our life so that you
[1:30:00] and I when we could read this in
[1:30:01] regarding job that I would say no doubt
[1:30:05] I read out of Job chapter n Job chapter
[1:30:07] 10 Job chapter 16 Job chapter 19 you
[1:30:11] could probably read out of Samuel not
[1:30:13] the book of Samuel out of here but the
[1:30:14] book of Samuel right here you might be
[1:30:16] able to read book of Samuel chapter 3
[1:30:18] and hear Samuel saying things like this
[1:30:21] or maybe read the book of Dave or the
[1:30:23] book of Brian and finding this coming
[1:30:26] out in this chapter and this but you'll
[1:30:28] also find on those other parts coming
[1:30:31] out though he slay me yet I'll trust him
[1:30:34] sir that's that's a part of the book yes
[1:30:38] it is and he's the one who gives us the
[1:30:42] strength and the right perception I
[1:30:45] think God's helped us to see that we're
[1:30:46] we're not immune from having the wrong
[1:30:48] perception but I'm grateful that God is
[1:30:51] mind ful to help us to have the right
[1:30:55] perception aren't you oh my I love him
[1:30:58] don't you just appreciate him brother
[1:31:00] Brian come and amen musicians if you
[1:31:02] come and amen just lead us in some
[1:31:05] worship here tonight so oh God thank you
[1:31:08] for your word hallu thank you for your
[1:31:12] mercy I think of this age and the time
[1:31:15] that we're living and and if it not as I
[1:31:17] said earlier if not for the grace of God
[1:31:19] Hey listen when the when the Rapture
[1:31:22] takes place brother Bram tells us
[1:31:24] there'll be those he said they'll go on
[1:31:27] having meetings he said and people will
[1:31:29] continue to come to the altar thinking
[1:31:33] they're getting saved and the Rapture is
[1:31:36] already
[1:31:37] gone said brother Samuel how can that be
[1:31:41] because the wrong
[1:31:43] perception now you and I would be there
[1:31:46] if not for God's
[1:31:48] grace it was God who came and he found
[1:31:52] you and I it's the grace of God that
[1:31:55] could sweep over a heart over a life to
[1:31:58] where God would help hearts and lives to
[1:32:01] see maybe a life could look and think
[1:32:03] man I really feel like this is you know
[1:32:05] I really love the Lord I really but then
[1:32:07] God can come right down by his word and
[1:32:09] show us that there's a deeper walk amen
[1:32:12] that it's more than just us loving God
[1:32:14] but it's to have his love in us and God
[1:32:17] by his grace you see he'll come and
[1:32:19] he'll work with us to cause our
[1:32:21] perception to come in line I I'm sure
[1:32:23] every one of us have probably been at a
[1:32:25] time and you're learning and I'm not
[1:32:27] just talking about from scripture but
[1:32:29] I'm talking about sometimes when you sit
[1:32:30] around with natural things and you're
[1:32:32] asking questions and all of a sudden
[1:32:33] it's like in school right all of a
[1:32:34] sudden you're looking at something a
[1:32:36] framework and you're looking at it and
[1:32:38] you realize I got to find the key to
[1:32:39] this so I can unlock the rest of these
[1:32:41] problems now brother bam tells us in key
[1:32:43] to the door he said there's a key to
[1:32:45] math key to science key to all these
[1:32:47] things and god holds those keys but see
[1:32:50] that same all the God who hold holds all
[1:32:52] those keys is the same God who holds the
[1:32:53] key of faith and when that key of Faith
[1:32:57] what it does it unlocks every promise
[1:32:59] thank you and so it's just like when you
[1:33:01] go into your house you don't go into
[1:33:03] every room at once you go into room by
[1:33:07] room and that key of faith when it opens
[1:33:09] up it's opening up promise after promise
[1:33:13] after
[1:33:14] promise and it's a key there's things
[1:33:18] that I I tell you just in this past year
[1:33:21] I think now we've been in it what maybe
[1:33:23] a year and a half in the Book of Job
[1:33:24] there's things some you remember when I
[1:33:26] first started pastoring I preached on
[1:33:28] that with the Book of Job
[1:33:30] but this time around
[1:33:33] I maybe I'm the only one but I've just
[1:33:37] I've looked at things I thought my never
[1:33:39] seen
[1:33:40] that I remember setting up last last
[1:33:43] last not this past November but a year
[1:33:45] ago setting up in Canada and I was just
[1:33:46] listening to I have heard but now I see
[1:33:48] and just meditating thinking about our
[1:33:50] midweek Services right back home and I
[1:33:52] remember I started listening that and
[1:33:53] the spirit of God began to deal with me
[1:33:54] I thought man I never seen it like that
[1:33:56] man never seen it like this and you just
[1:33:57] begin to go what I'm saying is is God
[1:34:00] knows when to give us the perception we
[1:34:03] need when we need it just just be
[1:34:07] standing in the right place remember the
[1:34:09] brown bear Vision never
[1:34:12] failed but Brother Brad would come
[1:34:13] around and tell us in countdown before
[1:34:16] he preaches in his presence he tells us
[1:34:19] it didn't fail but he remind us to be at
[1:34:23] the right
[1:34:24] place at the right time that's good is
[1:34:27] that right oh yes he tells us the
[1:34:29] pressure that he got under in the
[1:34:31] message that night in his presence of
[1:34:33] how he said I I went with the older
[1:34:35] brothers because I was I should have
[1:34:37] been with the younger brothers according
[1:34:39] to Vision but I was I didn't know what
[1:34:41] they might say I'm glad I'm glad that
[1:34:44] the prophet of God would allow those
[1:34:46] things to be recorded in there because I
[1:34:48] can relate to a man like that I can
[1:34:51] relate to what it is to feel pressure
[1:34:54] and to have made mistakes under pressure
[1:34:57] and be able to look and say God your
[1:34:59] grace was sufficient for the prophit of
[1:35:02] God in this hour then your grace is
[1:35:04] sufficient for
[1:35:06] me let's just be standing upon him let's
[1:35:10] make sure every part in our life whether
[1:35:12] you're here or whether you're streaming
[1:35:14] let's make sure Lord I want my
[1:35:16] perception to be right I want my life to
[1:35:19] be locked in I want to know I want Lord
