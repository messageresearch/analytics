let's just go forward in prayer before we turn to the scripture tonight amen heavenly father lord the truly father of people our constant being father lord we will always be that way as long as we're here in this flesh lord we ask that you would come now father may lord that you just as you've moved in the song service but you move down this portion of the service dear god anoint us dear god to be able to yield to you to preach your word tonight to be a help to the people lord we ask this in the name of the lord jesus christ to the glory of god amen i'd like to read from genesis chapter 12 verses 1 through 3 and i have a couple other scriptures as well what i want to speak on tonight is i just want to be a blessing now the lord said to abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that i will shoot thee i will make thee a great nation and i will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and i will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed if you turn me to ecclesiastics 11. you see asked these 11 verse 1 cast thy bread upon the water for thou shalt find it after many days also luke chapter 6 verse 38 give and it shall be given unto you good measure pressed down shaken together and running over shall men give into your bosom for with the same measure that you meet with all it shall be measured unto you again and you may receive you know every one of us we only have so many heartbeats in this life each heartbeat is one less that we've got to have every heartbeat we have is we've lost a heartbeat we only got so many more left and because your heart's only going to beat so many times then it's going to stop if the lord's a terry everyone will have to go by the way of the grave as god tarries so you only got so much time with which to do what you're going to do with your life and if you if you want to you should you should want to put your life to serving the lord many of us we've maybe had times where we weren't serving god you weren't serving god you were going along a different path and you may think well i wish i would have maybe turned earlier but you can't you can't go back and undo the past all you can do with is what you've got that lays ahead of you what you're doing right now you can you can only serve god as you serve one another as you serve as people you only love god as you love one another you show kindness to god by showing kindness to one another i serve you you serve me we serve god together the bible says in so much you've done it unto the least these my little ones you've done it unto me brother adam said if you want to be a blessing so if you want to get a blessing let's be a blessing be a blessing to someone else and blessing will return to you like casting your bread upon the water it'll return you usually reap just as you sow so let's do good talk good be kind and if people talk about us say good things and kind things about them and good things will come our way if we'll give them out i was reading where you know brother venom talked about what had happened down in houston when mr best uh came and made that challenge and you remember brother branham wouldn't go down he wasn't going to argue with him and brother bosworth said i'll take the challenge he was and brother bosworth was an older man and by brother bosworth went down there and took the man's challenge and it was a challenge on divine healing and so forth and then mr best had a photographer with him to snap and take pictures and he stuck his finger in brother bosworth's face and said take a picture and he was making all these gestures and saying take a picture and everything you know when you read about it it was just horrible how this man acted he he didn't act with the character of christ at all and the way he was treating that that elder in the lord was just horrible what brother branham said about it was he has a right to his beliefs that's what the boys in korea are fighting for so the prophet of god could look through and pass all that and make a statement like that so when someone talks bad about you just return kindness and good i know it's against this flesh but that's good for you because we know we're supposed to die to this flesh daily anyway so anytime somebody talks bad about you you just got an opportunity to die to your flesh brother branham went to speak in indianapolis indiana and uh when he got there they took up an offering for him and uh someone told him when he was on his way to the pulpit that they had taken up a love offering for him brother branham said you didn't have to do that i didn't come here for an offering i just come to be a blessing but i've got four children and a wife at home and i've got expenses and so i thank you for the offering and i pray that god will return it to you a hundred fold over he said in the great commission he said we never come for money we come to help you and to have fellowship we want to be a blessing to you and we know that you'll be a blessing to us you might not realize it friends but when when ministers come here and preach you're a blessing to them it's a blessing to get to preach here you're wonderful people to preach to you pull on the spirit of god you pull on the gift of god you make it easy to preach you make preaching enjoyable i never dread preaching here you might laugh at that but i i went to minister i was out on the road here oh 25 some years ago and uh i went to preach at a church and uh i went in there and you know a lot of times if you're out traveling and that you'll have like a uh a bag of messages sermons that you're gonna preach and you just let the lord select out of that bag you know and and unless he's going to give you something new off the cuff and uh so i came out and i thought i was going to preach one of the one of the good ones you know and boy i'll tell you what it was dead as could be and i felt like i was plowing not behind the plow but in front of it and and that whole service is that way and when it when it was i couldn't wait for it to be over i started praying while i was preaching lord please help me to get through this i'm not i'm not joking this was this is the truth and so when the service is over then i realized i had to preach that night too and i thought lord what am i going to do that about killed me this morning and you know if the people just clam up on you just sit on your net it's hard and you you have to do it all yourself and uh you got to preach amen and pull and everything else and and uh it's hard and and depending on the spirits that are out there why uh you know uh there's a hint there can be a hindrance and it hinders the thoughts from flowing so it's always a privilege when you get to come and preach at a group where the thoughts can just flow and the spirit can just flow and the people are there to receive and they're pulling that's always a privilege you're probably wondering how sunday night went well i came in there sunday night and preached a little evangelistic message full of fire and set the church on fire but that was the cause of the lord i was back there praying lord i had no idea what to speak on and uh the preacher come up to me the pastor after the service sunday night he said i was wondering about you this morning he said but you brought him on the scene tonight [Laughter] hallelujah we don't we go to be a blessing to people you know many of you uh how many remembers brother ben brother jackie ben brother benton would always say when he got up i just want to be a blessing and uh he he said that all the time and brother rowell soriano wrote a song i just want to be a blessing he wrote it for brother ben and his brother benton uh sung that song wherever he went and places he would sing that song that brother broadwell wrote i just wanted to be a blessing and i was thinking about him it's what got me to thinking about this just wanting to be a blessing to others and when you have that right attitude like that why you're not looking to receive a blessing from somebody you're looking at how you can bless them what can you do for them you know we should live every day as if we're living in our last hour if we live our each hour as if it's the last one then we're we're always going to be ready to go and if we're living each hour as if it's the last one then what are we doing during that hour what are we doing for the lord during that hour what are we doing for god's people brother brahm said let's be a blessing to others and try to do all we can for remember this is the only time that we're mortal this is the only time that we're mortal this is a time to win souls to christ this is a time to bring knowledge of the privileges that we have through the vicarious suffering of the lord on calvary healing that the sinners will come to the lord the backslidden would return back again this is a time of mortal this is a time when you can do something for one another i i don't think i'm gonna be too thinking about what can you do for me when i get in to the wedding supper but it's now when you can do something for others brother braham says in service we would see jesus he says we have come to be a blessing to you and we know that you'll be a blessing to us pardon me and through it all we pray that god and our father will be glorified in our meeting for that's the purpose we come for we come so that the lord can be glorified how is the lord glorified from his people through his people as a as a preacher i come to be a help to people not to beat them down or put them down but to help them lift them up encourage them sometimes correct them put their feet back on the right path pardon me brother branham preached the message i'll tell you the title of it in a minute but in that message he talked about if you're a sheep you're willing to be shorn of your rights and it talked about how that women of the age would say it's my privilege to wear what i want to wear because i'm an american and that's my american privilege and what i'm wearing besides they're not going to throw me off the street for it they're not going to throw me off the street for wearing pants brother brahma says yes that is your privilege but if you are a sheep you're willing to be sure of your rights sheep are willing to be shorn of what they came here with and he said i'm here to help you not to hurt you i want to be a blessing and he says all this in the message painted face jezebel and he goes on to say toward the end of that message he said i pray that you'll take this little cut up evangelistic message tonight to your hearts and go home and pray over it and say god be merciful to me and say i accept it as truth so here he preached this hard cutting message of painted face jezebel and then says i don't want to hurt you i just want to be a blessing now how is he being a blessing there might have been people who walked out of that servant and said well i'll tell you one thing he didn't bless me but he was being a blessing by making sure they didn't stray off the narrow way and so so many denominations have done they've they've left the paths of holiness that they once walked and now they've they've talked their way into accepting things of the world as being okay they still profess to holiness they still profess to be godly but when you look at him you can't tell any difference between them in the world i'm not saying that to put them down that's terrible how far they've fallen what about us where are we at brother branham was being a blessing by telling them the truth brother brandon dramatizes about micah you remember the story of micah in the bible brother branham dramatizes that and says when micah was coming the town why they met him and they said well now now listen uh we uh uh we want you to uh just watch how you speak and you know don't say anything about horse racing because the pastor owns a racehorse and he bets on him and uh now don't say anything about brotherhood since those bunco games that they have down in the church basement because you know the ladies they they go down there after prayer meeting it says not and they were giving micah a list of what he couldn't preach on brother madam says micah finally looked at him and said well what can i preach on he said i want to be a blessing they said we want you to be a blessing but said you know usually those evangelists are those fiery fireballs we think better than that of you and he said what can i preach on they said well we only got one jew in the church preach on the jews brother braham said micah wasn't a compromise he was a man of god and he come down there to preach the word of god he said but look at evangelism today in pentecost they're afraid to speak the truth i don't care if it hurts the pastor or who it hurts it's god's eternal word and we're responsible for it and the preaching of it we must tell the truth i don't care how bad it hurts but i just want to be a blessing to be a blessing you must tell the truth you know we love our children those of you that have raised children you know you love them but there's sometimes you gotta bring correction there's sometimes when you got to say okay that's enough you went far enough and you know you know how they are well you don't love me well i'm just going to run away i was talking about children not the people in church but sometimes i feel like that's how some folks are in church you hurt my feelings you don't love me if you love me you wouldn't talk to me that way you wouldn't bring that up sometimes people think a pastor gets up in the pulpit looks over the people decides what to preach and that's not the truth at all you've got on your heart what's going to be preached before you ever know who's there and i'm human i get up here and know what the lord got on my heart to preach and i can i can look out over my congregation and see different things and say lord help me i've got to say this anyhow and you know there's sometimes there's things you've got to preach on that you think as a pastor you shouldn't never have to preach on we shouldn't have to preach on i don't know what you call them leggings stretch pant things or whatever we shouldn't have to preach on belly shirts but sometimes it becomes necessary the greatest blessing is giving out brother ram said it's been 30 years that i've served the lord if there's any regrets it's the years past before i did serve the lord and i'm trusting god to help me as i journey down the lanes of life that god would lead me by his spirit and let me do something to show my appreciations for the cause that i was born on this earth for each and every one of you you were born here for a purpose you might say well i'm fulfilling that purpose but brother branham said we ought to be able to show our appreciation to god for the purpose he sent us here for that god give you the he give you the opportunity to live this life you know i had the opportunity of traveling overseas twice with my dad brother bill been with me many many times and when my dad would go whatever money he left the states with he came back with maybe not even a penny he just he just would give and i'm not making this all about money but i got a point to make and he would always say when you leave this life the only thing you can take with you is what you've done for the lord and you do for the lord as you do for others you can't take your money with you you can't take your houses your cards or any of those things but what you've done for the lord that you can take with you when you go that's the only thing that's going to mean something when you pass from this life is what you've done for the lord and you do for the lord by doing for his people and you know when you do it you don't do it expecting return even though the prophet said if you want a blessing be a blessing but you don't do it with that in mind well i'm going to see what i can get but you do it from the depths of your heart because you want to do it you're not looking for anything in return he said i pray the lord will help me and bless me so that i could be a blessing to you people i found out the greatest blessing in his life is giving something out not in receiving it but giving out what you do for others is what means so much i want to i want to read this to you he said if the devil can keep us separated and he's got a shooting at one another so he's got an open target anywhere he shoots and what's the use of shooting we're shooting one another so he can sit back and relax i have found grace in your sight through god you take my word for this brother if you want to be a blessing and get a blessing when a man has done you wrong and he has absolutely justly i mean he's done you wrong and you know that he's done you wrong he's done you evil don't mention that you take him to prayer before god and don't take it in such a selfish way as i i'm supposed to do this but stand shoulder your shoulder to his shoulder and stand in the presence of god our father a way a prayer should be made in the presence of god father here's my brethren he's justly deserves punishment for what he's done me evil and i don't see why he did it then let god go to talking to you and you'll see maybe what that man's been through maybe he didn't mean it that way i uh i kind of for myself i speak for myself i've kind of learned a lesson on pastoring that if i'm really bad sick i don't i don't mingle with the people i don't mean about covid and all this other stuff i'm talking about if i've got a really bad sinus infection i won't mingle with the people i won't let the people get around me i'll go to church i'll stay in the back because tell you what happened to me one time a a brother come to me and i was i had come to church i had my associate preaching i'd come to church and i had a really bad sinus infection and my head was hurting and uh i just couldn't hardly stand the pressure if you ever had sinus infections you know what i'm talking about that pressure just feels like that pressure's all in your face and uh i get a little short when i get that way and uh so this brother come to me and begin to attack me over what he thought my daughter's the heels he thought they were wearing weren't short enough and so i didn't have a lot of patience because this same brotherhood come to me some years before over heels my wife was wearing and i don't want to get into it but you know there was many things that were said and uh during that first go-round and then here he comes and and so i did that i just was not feeling like talking to anybody and so i was i was rather abrupt with him and it hurt his feelings and uh so he went on and left and i left and i got to thinking about it and i called him up and i said listen i had a sinus infection i was very abrupt with you i said i i raised my voice i said i wasn't feeling well and i apologize for that but what i said was the truth and so i came back in a later message and i spoke about women's hills and i said if you want to see go look at the film 20th century prophet and in the beginning of that film brother branham brings these two brothers in and they come and sit in the living room and sister meaty comes out carrying a tray with some refreshments on it i said she's wearing heels if those heels were all right for her then they're all right for everybody else brother venom never preached you had to wear flats now there are there are men that claim to be men of this message that preach women have to wear flats they can't wear their hair this way they can't wear their hair that way they can't do this they can't do that and all that you know one brother invited me to come preach my wife told me if you ever go there you're going to go without me but they bring this they bring these teachings and beliefs on from other places and injected in here when brother brandon never preached those things maybe you'll see what a man's been through maybe the devil's twisting him up somewhere and caused him to do that though he's absolutely wrong before you leave the throne of god you'll feel sorry for that man and you'll be sympathizing with that brother you know don't be so quick to judge until you see what they've been through like that old saying walk a mile in their shoes don't be so quick to condemn other people you'll be sympathizing with your brother and when you get back down to earth again you'll go over to your brother and shake his hand because you know what he's been through you can't stand as a mortal in the presence of god and condemn anybody let he that's without sin cast the first stone in other words you can't stand as a mortal in the prison of god and condemn anybody i don't believe no sir not even if he's a rank sinner i gave you a testimony on sunday about how brother david horner got delivered well before that he was like a thorn in my side and he would do things to try to see if he could get at me and so he uh came down and and talked to some folks that lived on the road where i lived and uh asked them if he could go back and hunt in their woods and i knew he was just doing it to try to get at me because i see his truck when i drove by and so i knew he was just trying to do it to be me and i and so i i thought well i'm i'll tell you what i'm going to do i'm going to pray the lord does something to him you know david sometimes got that way david in the bible king david so i got down to pray and you know i could not pray anything bad on him but what i did say was lord when i first came here to dixon i used to pray that david would get a big deer so you could know that he could know you answer prayer and i said and you would give him a big deer i said so now lord i'm praying you won't let him get any deer so that he'll know you're a god that answers prayer and sometime later he spoke to someone and he said you know i haven't got a deer this year he said now i know something's going on he said somebody used to pray the deer on me and i think they're praying the deer off of me and what about a brother that's made a mistake though i say he's wrong sometimes he's accused or wrong when he's not wrong have you ever been there been accused of wrong and you're not wrong well don't go around trying to straighten the people out you'll just make a bigger mess up pray for the person that's accused you of wrong and you're not being wrong put it in god's hands but if he's wrong take him to the throne of god and stand there shoulder to shoulder with him knowing he's immortal maybe his destination rests upon our attitude toward him and when we come back from the throne of god we'll realize we're everyone guilty and we all need help one from the other you know god can take very bad people and make real good christians out of them the bible says about saul yet while he was breathing out threatenings against the church that god came and appeared to him in the pillar of fire brother brown said god the very god that can take a little hook nosed jew like paul angry and going down there putting all the christians to death under capital punishment and could change him and make him a lovely christian that same god lives tonight and can change any things anytime he takes a notion to do it he can change people turn with me to micah chapter 3. the book of my uh i'm sorry not micah malachi sorry i said wrong malachi chapter 3. in verse 8 through 10. will a man rob god yet ye have robbed me but you say wherein have we robbed thee in tithes and offerings ye are cursed with a curse for ye have robbed me even this whole nation bring you all the tithe into the storehouse that there may be meat in my house and prove me now we're here with saith the lord of hosts if i will not open up the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it so here's something that the bible says that god's saying if you do this i'm going to bless you if you give your tithe arms i'm going to bless you for it that doesn't mean that this isn't a message of prosperity that you're going to give your tithe and offerings and god's going to make you a millionaire if god was to only bless you with money that would only be temporal it would not be eternal it wouldn't have an eternal effect on your life but god's gonna bless you with things far beyond this world's riches he's gonna look friends my father owns a cattle on a thousand hills i don't got any need of this world's uh wealth i've got wealth it's like that banker that brother branham went and visited out west and he showed brother he's told brother brown you look this far as far as you can see i own all that land he said see that little town down there i own that town i own the bank in that town i own all the land out this way and he was showing all this to brother brandon brother and says how much do you own up there [Applause] i could stand here till in the morning telling you just what happened when i seen that and what condition i was in but just as loyal as i ever could i paid tithes and i took my own money from the church here from my campaigns and i'd give a tenth and i'd give it out to the ministers i believe in paying tithes it's one of god's blessings that's proven to be a blessing you say that's old testament it's of the new testament too turn me to first corinthians first corinthians chapter 9 verse 9 through 11 for it is written in the laws of moses thou shall not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn doth god take care for oxen or saith he at all together for our sakes for our sakes no doubt this is written that he that plowed should plow and hope and he that threshes in hope shall be partaker of his hope if we have sown unto you spiritual things is it a great thing if we reap your carnal things turn me to hebrews chapter 7 verse 1. for this melchizedek king of salem priests the most high god who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings blessed him to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all verse being by interpretation king of righteousness after that also king of salem which is king of peace without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the son of god abideth the priest continually and now consider how great this man was whom unto whom even the patriarch abraham gave a tenth of the spoils and verily they that are of the sons of levi who received the offerings office of the priesthood have a commandment to take tithe other people according to law that is of their brethren though they come out of the loins of abraham but he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of abraham and blessed him that had the promise and without all contradiction the lest is blessed of the better and here men that die receive tithes but there he receiveth them of whom it is witness he liveth and as i may so say levi also who receiveth ties paid tithes in abraham for he was yet in the loins of his father when melchizedek met him hallelujah you know i when i preach i a lot of times give examples of my own life i'll tell you my faults and failures i'll tell you mistakes that i've made i'll tell you trials that i've went through how we've come out what the lord did and and i do all that to try to be a blessing uh preachers aren't superhuman they're flesh and blood just like you are you might think well they don't go through trials oh but yes they do it may be in different ways it may be over different things but they do go through it i'll tell you something pastoring a church is not an easy job and i i had a man one time you know accuse me said i was worse than an infidel said because i wouldn't work and i thought well i'd like for you to take my job for a day or two and just find out how much work it is it's it's a stressful and it takes a toll on you just like it took a toll on the lord jesus age of 32 they said you're not a man 50 years old and i said they thought he looked 50 years old at the age of 32. it takes a toll there are positions in this world that people men can have women have to take a toll on it have you ever paid attention to some of the men who have been president look at him when they first went in office and then look at him after they've been in there four or eight years and see how much they've aged in that amount of time they've aged more than eight years they've aged about double that many times over because it's stressful it's the way it is with passion it's a stressful job and the thing is you've got the you're responsible for what you say to the people you're responsible for the souls of the people and so you res you you weigh out what you're going to what what you're going to say to the people one of the things i say is i i never tried to project my opinion as being the word of god i've got opinions about things i've got feelings about things but i don't preach them unless it's the word of god galatians chapter 3 verse 6 says even as abraham believed god and it was accounted in him for righteousness know you therefore that they which are of the faith the same are the children of abraham and the scripture foreseeing that god would justify the heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto abraham saying in thee shall all nations be blessed so then they which are of the faith are blessed with faithful abraham some years ago my when my children were young and i was living up here i i remember specifically one week that uh one month that uh my wife and i we didn't have enough money to pay for our bills and we had set down and figured it out this is how much we owe this is how much we have we're this much short and we both said well the first thing when we're figuring this up we've got to take our tithe and offerings out and then see what we've got to work with and we said even though we couldn't make it meet the expense for that month said we're going to we're still going to give our tithe an offer and so we went to church that sunday morning and gave our tithe and offerings in worship and i went outside after church and i was standing out here on the walk and since he's done passed on i'm going to tell you who it was brother herb walked up to me and he said here brother jerry god told me to give this to you and he stuck something in my shirt pocket and uh i was i was too embarrassed to look at it standing there and so later we got in the vehicle to leave i thanked him for it we got in the vehicle to leave opened up it was a check and the check was wrote out for the exact amount to the penny of how short i was for that month now you tell me that god didn't tell him to do that [Applause] brother brown said this is one thing that's proven if you give your tithes and offerings you're going to get blessed god's going to take care of me i say it all the time i quote david of old i was once young but now i'm old but i've never seen the righteous forsaken or his seed begging bread and i'll tell you what there's been many times over brother herb keithley was a blessing to this congregation he blessed this church many times over he would do anything for anybody you know he was always buying and selling things he bought things that he could see the value in him he would sell them and and he would make money off i remember times of having something i needed some money and i'd call brother herb and say hey i've got something to sell and you know looking back over it i was just a young man then looking back from where i'm at now i'd say there's some times that he came and bought what i had when it wasn't worth nothing just to try to be a help well he's in a blessed place tonight my dad he helped me many times over my dad was always there for me there wasn't too much to ask you couldn't ask i could never ask too much of him he was always there to help me anytime i needed help in any way i needed sometimes when i'm studying i get to miss me so i'll be looking for a quote and i can't find it and when my dad was living i would call him up and say dad i'm looking for such a quote and he'd go and help me find it now i call it my brother we go through everything we go through as ministers to be a blessing to the people be held they're alive in some way that's how you be that your life in some way can touch the lives of others i gave you a testimony brother herb and how his life touched so many and that's what we want not that somebody would get up sometime and give us glory from the bullpen and that wasn't what i was doing if brother heard was still living i would have never said who it was because he wouldn't have wanted me to but i just wanted to share with you a truth to show you you can't give your you can't out give god if you give your time god will make sure you're taken care of you give your offerings got to make sure you're taken care of somebody has to pay for these lights somebody's got to pay for the different things and you know we can't god has given us enough to where we don't have to be in a run-down shack think about what god's done you can come here and sit comfortably there's heat in the winter there's air in the summer i remember when this group first started we were always setting up and taking down we first we went rented sister mercy remember we rented the room over at the family y we were always setting up equipment taking equipment down then we rented a church over here on gary avenue we went in of the afternoon in between their services and we we had to set up all of our pa equipment and take it all down we had to set everything up and take it down now you've got your own place you don't have to sit up and take down there was a pastor pastor adams that pastored the group that was here in this church before you bought it and you know they he was going to another had accepted an offer from another church to go past them there was only a few people left here in this assembly and he said well what are we going to do with the church and they decide they wanted to sell the church but they wanted to sell it to somebody that was going to use it as a church they said well who should we sell it to and he said well you know that group that's always renting the church off of us to come over here and baptize people so they're baptizing so many people they must need a church building my wife and i were the first ones to rent this church building i rented it to get married in in 1982. it didn't have these plaster walls in it then the block you see on the outside is what you saw on the inside and uh we needed we were just renting out of the family why and that so we had no place to to have our wedding so i i found out the pastor of this church then and came and talked to him and rented this church to get married in so this church holds a special place in mind in my wife's hearts anyway but now that you own it and it's yours it holds even a more special place in our hearts you know brother branham tells a story that was always has always been a blessing to me uh there was a man that was convicted in a town of a crime and he was related to most everybody in that town and so the people in that town told the judge that he better watch what he what he sentenced that man to because he was related to everybody in the town and the town kind of threatened him you know and the judge uh being a real fine judge of the law why he passed just sentence on the man for the crime he had committed and the people of the town begin to say we're not going to vote for you again said we hate you and they were screaming all kinds of things at him and he said yes but i'm loved at home and that's what i always feel like about this is where i started out it's home and i feel like no matter where i go where i'm at i'm always loved here hey man let's stand heavenly father i pray you take this my broken up way of speaking lord take the message that you laid on my heart father bless it to
