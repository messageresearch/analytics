what boys you our hearts rejoices because there's always when he takes a hold of the word and begins to speak and we just want to enter into all of us to that channel of inspiration and just invite him to come and speak to our hearts tonight he knows just what's on our heart he knows our needs and i'm just glad about that that he's mindful enough to come right by our way amen so if we could let's just look to the lord in a word of prayer before we turn to the word heavenly father lord as we lord are gathered here tonight lord having a great privilege lord here before us lord to come into

to you lord we know that god that you are you're the author of the word and that's what we desire lord that you'll come and speak so personally to our hearts lord your god if there be any desire doubt lord you're the dissolver of it lord you settle every dispute oh god father where fear is cast out lord and unbelief oh god is torn down lord and you are raised oh god in victory and power and lord we

ask that god that your grace and mercy lord we're just riding upon us tonight lord and just speak lord we pray o god in a very personal way we love you and we thank you now lord as we turn in the word we ask that you'll just come and open it lord we pray in jesus precious name amen and amen amen good to be here tonight isn't it amen let's just we're going to ask you turn in your bibles to deuteronomy chapter 28 and i'm going to read two verses of scripture there and then we'll let you be seated in deuteronomy chapter 2 28 sorry 28 and verse 1 and it shall come to pass if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the lord thy god to observe and to do all his commandments which i command thee this day that the lord thy god will set thee on high above all nations of the earth and all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god amen may god add his blessing to the word as you're being seated i'd like to just speak to you tonight on a thought and that is when prayer changes when prayer changes and maybe just to read of a quote of where i'm going to move to here tonight but brother branham is speaking of how he says where many are saying brother branham you pray for me today brother branham you pray for me today and brother braham says it like this he says you get over in canaan once brother and then you realize where you belong watch prayer start being turned around notice what he's saying it isn't that he brother bradman's not saying in this quote that we don't ask one another to pray for us but in other words where an individual comes to a place that that they recognize that the same god who is moving through the prophet in that hour that he's my god to that i'm not anything less i'm not a prophet you're not a prophet but god brought the realization to you and i in this hour that through that that calling of a prophet that god placed here that that gift that god sent in this hour and ordained that was to open a channel in a realm that was already here but we needed to tap into it and god sent eyes in this hour that of which that a prophet that's what distinguishes a prophet from all other gifts of the ministry because the prophet itself when god sends it remember this fulfillment in this hour is the same ministry of the lord jesus christ that's reproduced again through human flesh and it was to tap in in other words to let you and i know as god not just in the knowing because this is not a field this is not theology but god here making himself known through an open channel of his word in this hour that you and i can clearly see this is who i am so the message itself is not revealing brother branham the message is revealing jesus christ and as that revelation of jesus christ sets forth to our life then it's through that revelation that we come to the realization of who we really are and when we recognize who we are this is what brother branham is saying here and we're working towards this tonight is then you recognize where you belong over in canaan and then you watch your prayer start being turned around then so as we look at this this scripture here of what god has declared in deuteronomy 28 of how it shall come to pass there's no uncertainty about this when god has made a promise it will come to pass now sometimes there's been like as paul writes in the book of romans under inspiration because some did not believe has that hindered god not at all god knew those that would not believe but god when he spoke it he's got somebody in mind that that word is going to be fulfilled through and and it has nothing to do with that person's goodness it has everything to do with his word and who he is so god speaks not with a maybe or a might but it shall come to pass it shall come to pass that's why when the scripture says in john chapter 1 that to them that to them that received him to them gave he the power or the authority to become sons of god and that word is become means to come to pass we're always the son and daughter of god but the word must come to pass in our life it moves from just being a seed of promise from just being a desire in our life but to actually be coming it is the now theme of our life to where it's no longer just a word because remember anyone can dispute with a promise but when the promise is made manifest it settles all disputes because the word has come to pass and the word has declared itself and this is what the god is speaking through moses it shall come to pass in other words god shall surely declare his word and in the declaring of his word notice how god will declare his word if thou shalt hearken to his voice so he has to be able to hear his voice be able to recognize his voice what is the voice of the lord it is his word he speaks through his word it's the voice of the holy spirit that takes a promise and it's no longer reading it and reciting it but it's declaring this is the season this is the moment this is the time and it's the spirit of god doing that that raises up in a life and that life begins to respond to him who is the word so what is it it's the word responding to the word so now notice god's promise through that of obedience to the word of god because i don't it doesn't matter whatever that that you might you or i might do there is nothing higher in the order of god than obedience to the word of god there's nothing that you and i can grow you know we could give fruit baskets to the poor we could do everything in the world but but obedience it is greater than all of that remember when saul came back and said i've got good things to sacrifice to you here and god let him know through the prophet that i what i have spoken in my word the greatest obedience that you could have done was let your life be a sacrifice to your own will sacrifice your own will to the will of god and god said that's greater honor obedience is better than any sacrifice that's why the holy spirit would take the message enticing spirits and he would deal with that same thing in this hour where people will rely upon speaking in tongues or their fasting and all of those things are are are are our gifts and attributes of god but the holy spirit was ministering when we take an enticing spirit or rely upon anything rather than full obedience to the word of god that is an enticing spirit against the word of god so there's nothing greater that you and i can ever give to god and there's no greater respect that we can give to him than to obey his word and obedience is not something of the mind but obedience is that of the heart and you know when a person walking with god obedience doesn't mean you have to know it you have to understand it obedience is to know that god has spoken and we submit our lives to his voice and say lord you have spoken it it shall come to pass you've not asked me to figure out how you have spoken it and we yield in our heart the amen begins within a soul be it lord so god has made a promise here in this verse 1 that he will set you above in other words god will place you in position and it will be a work of the lord by his word no you cannot come into position with god outside of the word of god so it is the word that god sends in an hour in a season that will actually bring the people of god in position not to think about it when that word is moving and ministering to your life it is bringing you into the position of the word itself so that your life becomes a display or a billboard of the word of god that has been written now it has been expressed by the spirit now your life expresses that word so in position of that word it is the word of god nothing else that will bring us into position not and think of that the lord thy god will set thee on high above all the nations of the earth so god will place you by his word where you belong anybody ever been anywhere where you felt like i don't belong here i mean i felt that way many different times i don't belong here but god is letting you and i know that the word itself will actually place you where you belong because it's the word that holds the call of the homeland and it calls you back to where you belong this is why through the scriptures even we see when israel would begin gathering back to the homeland and the trumpets were sounding out there and they were coming in and gathering and under all sorts of persecution and gathering back in the land it was a supernatural gathering of the spirit of god that would begin to put into the heart of the jews to return to their homeland it was not a work of man the the the things that you see within the hearts of the individuals that they would move in there and the perseverance that they would have that was not that of man's ingenuity but it was the spirit of god that would move upon them and would actually move them beyond all of their doubts all of their unbelief all about everything that was there because god is determined to fulfill his word and all he needs is vessels that will obey him and yield to his word and god said i'll take care of the rest of it oh my i will place you where you belong i will put you in position now notice i will place you i will set you on high above all the nations of the earth and all these blessings shall come on thee and over take thee oh i love that if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the lord now notice all the blessings shall come and they will actually overtake you let me just say it like this you and i were not seeking after god god was seeking after us god is the one who came knocking and dealing with our life now how many times then maybe you looked at something in your life and said well i'm not worthy but god even knocking on your heart was letting you know it's not about your worthiness it's god's desire to do for you what only he can do these blessings shall come upon you it's a blessing the bible said blessed are they who do hunger and thirst for righteousness they shall be filled it's a blessing to desire the holy ghost it's a blessing that has come upon you and the spirit of god dealing with your life and that blessing overtakes your life let me just say this it's not you receiving the holy ghost it's the holy ghost accepting you these blessings shall overtake me oh aren't you glad when god begins to deal with our life the greatest thing we can do is open our life and say lord overtake me lord saturate me lord overwhelm my life oh god with your presence now i'm going to look at this this scripture here just for a minute or this word and all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee now this word blessings the very first plan that ever appears in the scripture is genesis 12 2 where god says to abraham i will make of thee a great nation and i will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing oh glory be to god i'll tell you every one of them parts we could just preach on it but i want to just deal with that that reality that it is god's working it is god who has already declared this is what i will do now all god asked of abraham is is to yield in obedience to me when when you can't understand yet obey me because what i have said i will perform it don't try to figure it out don't try to when i'm gonna try to understand it we see that even in abraham's life and let's just be real we can see it in our own life where we can try to understand things remember abraham had a lot of misunderstandings that had happened in the journey but brother brown could stand there and tell us in the message look abraham chose not to focus on the misunderstandings of the promise you and i've had a lot of misunderstandings in our lives about things whether it's things we've fought we believe or we've spoke but you remember abraham chose to not focus on the misunderstandings because we can only know as god will reveal his word to us and the greatest thing we can do is back to obedience then lord i don't understand this right now but you have promised it you will bring it to pass and to realize that the word coming to pass god's also got to bring us into the right condition for the word to come to pass this is not just a one-way street where i'm just waiting on god but the working of the holy spirit to bring the promise to pass is also god working on our lives in submission to him now to think of that thou shalt be a blessing this word is used here and it's a word that means a source of blessing or that which would be a praise of god thou shalt be a blessing so we recognize that god dealing with abraham that it would not be abraham's natural seed although there would be a natural lineage but it would not be through the natural seed that we would receive the blessing not to isaac but we receive the blessing of abraham through christ this blessing that we're talking about of even what god would show in tight to abraham when god would take abraham and confirm the covenant would show him a vision of calvary in genesis 15. he would show abraham the working that i what i have said i have confirmed it i will surely bring it to pass in other words if i don't do what i have said then let me be as dead as good as a dead man but how many know that god can't lie god's never made a promise that he ever had to back up on god's never made a promise and said oh man i shouldn't have made that promise i didn't realize how dark it was going to be i didn't realize how sinful it was going to be i didn't realize how bad it was going to be let me tell you something the same promise that god gave back there it still works tonight then it doesn't matter how dark it is it doesn't matter how black it is it doesn't matter the situation because god who made the promise he hadn't changed one bit his power hadn't diminished his authority as the saved all glory be to god then we can have a solidness and say it shall come to pass it shall come to pass whatever the promise is in your life you can stand with god's word and say it shall come to pass let me tell you something it's coming to pass even in your attitude right now are you hearing me it's coming to pass even as you even taking it into the natural mind marriage and dropping down it is coming to pass you are not declaring something of your own power you are declaring who god has revealed to you that he's above this [Music] so it's not abraham's natural seed that we receive the blessing through paul would write it like this in galatians 3 christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree that the blessing of abraham this blessing of abraham is the holy ghost might come on the gentiles through jesus christ you see we had no access into the covenant are you hearing me we had no access into the covenant we were like rahab we had no access into the covenant we were like ruth had no access into the covenant we were like the daughters of zolofia we had no access into the covenant there had to be one that would be able to span the breach there had to be one that could put his hand upon our life and tie us back into the promise of god that is the mystery of god the mystery of god is the holy ghost amen it's him who has come that through christ it is revealed and we are brought into position we've not been made church members we now have been brought into the reality as sons and daughters of god where we belong where we belong notice he redeemed us he he bought us back remember when uh joseph brought out the two sons of eve from manasseh and he brought him there to to israel to jacob and he asked him to bless him remember the blessing belonged to the firstborn is that right but notice how about jacob he began when he went to pray his hands were crossed now joseph is looking upon it and joseph is looking and saying hey what you're doing is not right but jacob responds to him and says it is not what i have done but god has crossed my hands i haven't done this let me say this to you it wasn't you that conferred this blessing upon your life it is not you that was good enough to confer this blessing that you would hear the voice of god and it would deal with your life it is a work of almighty god jacob stood there and testified to joseph i had not done this but god has crossed my hands it was a showing in prophecy that though the the the the blessing belonged to the firstborn it belonged to the jews the covenants all those things that were promised to them but god made a cross in there back through jesus christ the blessings the adoption everything that pertained to that of the jews it now comes upon the gentiles the mystery of christ that will lift a gentile bride in position it is the lord that has set thee on high let me tell you something you can look at that in your own life and when it says it shall come to pass you can say take that devil it might look as black it might look as impossible it might look like there ain't nothing can happen but let me tell you something when god has said something god is there to order lives even when jacob might have wanted to go this way but the spirit of god brought their hands across well we could preach there for a minute [Music] but i'm just going to stay here oh i crossed my hand so that the blessing of abraham it has come upon us through jesus christ now paul would write of this in ephesians 1 verse 3 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ now paul remember the mystery of god is made known to paul concerning the gentiles right peter saw the spirit of god fall upon the gentiles they can't dispute it right in the house of cornelius it fell down upon them right then after it fell peter remember what he was speaking he says you cannot dispute the coming of the holy spirit upon those lives who are we see when the holy spirit has come now it brought a reality because peter is one that is identified and born of the spirit of god of the word and he recognizes his position who are we to say anything against that which the holy spirit has come and did oh glory be to god and notice they walked on into the water of baptism now this is what i i want you to to notice and just let it drop in just so deep that paul is sounding out here under an inspiration of what was before the foundation of the world is now being unfolded you know our minds cannot go back to the foundation of the world our memory cannot go back there but there is a representation of a spiritual seed on the inside there's just something it raises up because we can't explain it i can't say oh i remember being there i don't remember being there but whoa when the presence of god begins to come around the presence of god to a believer is not something that's foreign even to a lot that has not been born again when the spirit of god begins to come around it's something about it it just sounds like home this is a glove that's fitting me i'm hearing that eagle above it's something about it that's taking a hold of my life what is it it's the mystery of god working in your life to draw you and call you and lift you from all unbelief so it in what you can figure out you can't know god by your mind you know god by faith to believe him for what he has said the god that deals with your life the god that works with you the greatest thing you can do is open up and invite him to speak personally what he's doing in the service let me tell you something jesus don't just sit on a pew he'll go right with you to your home are you hearing me this word will continue to speak with you blessed now let me get into the blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ so that position was already given just as much as when israel when those mothers under inspiration from god when they gave name to those children it was they were not looking through a baby book are you hearing me you know and saying you know maybe they've been thinking what am i going to call my baby but there was an inspiration of god that dropped down is that all right they were in tune with with another book and the author and there was an inspiration that dropped and do you realize that name itself when it dropped by divine inspiration held their placement in the land of promise when they went in to take the land of promise there wasn't them casting lots of who gets this and who gets this it was already determined from the mind of god and let me say this this message it was already determined in this hour when he said behold i sinned unto you elijah the prophet you are already a part of that intended target known you god knew that you would be here in this hour and he knew the inspiration of his name being revealed in this hour and the effect that he would have upon your life he knew it would stir something in you that you would say i've got to take my position i've got to have my possession a church can't do that to you there ain't enough fellowship dinners in the world to do that to you it takes the presence of almighty god coming down and he is your father [Applause] glory be to god that's why the prophet could say in the adoption series he said you cannot learn the mystery of god in a seminary he said there ain't cinnamon areas that teach the mystery of god you realize what he's saying that the mystery of god is the working of the holy ghost seminaries cannot teach that that is that is god personally coming down and unfolding himself to you oh my overriding our rebellion overriding all of our unbelief overriding all of our doubt what is it the blessing of god has come upon you to overtake you oh glory be to god not just to come upon you but to overtake you to change your life completely this is not a blessing that you only feel in church and then when you walk outside it lives off your life that's not what the blessing of god is but the blessing of god is it brings you into your rightful position of where you rightfully belong oh glory oh my notice as according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love now he chose that so because that that choosing now how could god choose that this is predestination how could god choose it because god is declaring remember his word is a finished work when isaiah was moved by the spirit of god in isaiah 53 he does not speak under the spirit of god as something that shall be but he declares he was wounded from our transgression he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him so he is declaring it in a finished work because it's a finished work from the mind of god it was already settled can't you see that the devil that's tried to torment you he's already been defeated he wasn't just defeated at calvary he was defeated from the mind of god this is the great drama the great act of almighty god that's being unfolded by the master himself hallelujah glory to god according as he had chosen us you have not been chosen to be defeatable you have not been anointed to succumb to satan's evil you have not been anointed to be defeated by lady osea you have been chosen to be victorious in jesus christ take that devil you need to say that take that devil i've not been chosen to be defeated i've been chosen to stand in victory to walk in the glory of god [Applause] according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world i know i'm going to say something pretty simple it was real simple but you know what all along this young man right here benjamin and zachary all three of them they were in me the whole time are you with me i didn't all of a sudden one day go hunt him up on the street and say hey you want to be my boy hey hey man hey tell you what i'll give you i'll give you some good candy i find out what you really like that's not predestination predestination this is a settled plan and work of god it doesn't mean that there's everything we're going to be pulled through a pipe no it's the spirit of the author of the word coming upon our life that brings us to repentance that sanctifies us and brings us in to jesus christ our rightful position you remove the spiritual seed and your life is like a cell phone without a sim card you could try to get a call you want but there's no sim card in it is that right you got to have a sim card what does that sim card do once that sim card is there in this phone i remember when i got this phone specifically i had to put that little itty bitty thing in there with my big fat fingers on my desk and i'm putting that sim card in there now you do realize on that sim card i don't know how in the world i ever read it but on that sim card is little numbers that are wrote on it and i had to call a member of verizon and let them know this is what the sim card says you see what i'm doing i am declaring what is wrote on that sim card and when that man in the network he receives that however he does it puts it on in other words i now have made it through the gate or the entryway i've been baptized into the network i am now able to receive calls i'm able to receive messages not because i've got a phone but because i've got a sim card that i can read the numbers and say this is what i belong to let me tell you what the word is doing in your life the word is letting you know this is where you belong what should i do say what the word says about you say amen to the word of god and you'll find yourself receiving texts receiving images from almighty god where you think of yourself defeated yet god will send you an image of victory a power and of glory [Music] [Applause] oh hallelujah aren't you glad about that tonight so according as he had chosen us i didn't choose him are you hearing me i didn't choose him well by the time you had to make a choice because you're on free more agency that's true but remember when he passed by my way same way it was with andrew same way it was with peter same way it was with john on and on and on and on same way it was with paul jesus never had to put him in a headlock he never had to put him a noose around their neck and drag him he just made himself known to them and they began to stir up that seed on the inside to the presence of its maker so it is not us that has chosen him he has chosen us and the choosing of god it begins to it is revealed through the word of god so how do we come into position i will set thee on high it is by the word of god and obeying the word notice having predestinated us unto the placement or position of children now that word adoption is not like we think of it here where we go out and we take somebody who is not of our loins in other words they're not of our family that's not what this word adoption means here this word adoption is your placement or your position we remember we could not get in position ruth could not get in position without boaz ruth was ordained already to be a channel that the word was going to come through i don't care if she was a moabite that seed wasn't a moabite i don't care if it was ray have the harlot that seed was no harlot i don't care if you can look at tomorrow and say how could she do that it was what was on the inside it was christ motivating her to move to take seed in that hour [Applause] [Music] how could the daughters of zolofia come into position there was nobody to bring them into their inheritance but there had to be someone of their father's tribe that would step forward and through a union of marriage they would receive their inheritance you see this is why for you and i we are we are not the husband we are not the leader we are not the ruler we as the wife of jesus christ we submit ourself to the word and the word brings us into our rightful position [Applause] having predestinated us so predestinated is that of election are you with me now i'm just trying to drag my feet a little bit here election looks back to foreign knowledge in other words god already remember this is the plan of god there is nothing that is happening that's out of order remember joseph thought it was out of order god said it's right in order you may not understand it but it's right in order everything is happening right on time all right this is god's plan this is the whole drama that's laid out right here and the inspiration of god notice election looks back to foreign knowledge knowing that god he foreknows he knows god knew friends let me tell you something god knew of even all the struggles you and i would have with coming to recognize who we are god knew let me tell you this god knew of the times that he would deal with our heart we could have sat in the meeting and we didn't yield but that didn't change his mind you realize that the experience of the holy ghost the prophet tells us in satan's eden it's not schooled into you you don't learn the holy ghost it's an experience predestinated from the hand of almighty god god knew the time god knew the place and what's most important is is that you know you've been changed [Applause] god had all of this prearranged glory be to god in the highest having predestinated us into the placement of children by who by jesus christ to himself so you see what real positioning does it brings us to the word when the spirit of god is come the real evidence of the holy ghost is it moves you into the word to where your life you're able to save from your life there's an amen within you not that you are perfect but the desires of the world has gone and the desire that burns in your heart is to please him you love him because he first loved you that ain't just a scripture that's a reality that's a divine revelation like paul can say the life that i'm living now it's a different life but i'm living it by the revelation that he loved me first and his love has been projected to me now i'm not living in defeat i'm living in the victory of love divine according to the good pleasure of his will oh glory be to god brother brown would say that predestination it looks to destiny or predestination you take the word destiny so for knowledge god having foreknowledge now for knowledge looks ahead to destiny your destiny is not in question are you hearing me it was never in question before the foundation of the world but the holy spirit came down to lift you in position so you're no longer wondering but you're looking with a real reality i know in whom i have believed and i'm persuaded that he is able to keep that which i've committed against today and let's just let's just put this in here that becomes more real every day of your life are you hearing me now as you feed on the word it's building the faith the holy spirit is taking that word as the fire of god it's roasting that lamb and that word itself is moving it's working in your life what's it doing it's building faith faith in what faith in who you are to recognize the promises that belong to you because god does not reveal us who we are and then our action is we sit on a bench that's not what the revelation of who we are does the revelation of who we are puts us into action glory be to god to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved can i just read it now brother brandon wrote it here in the or spoken in the adoption he says notice he said how that that election it looks back there and predestination looks to destiny don't forget that that election looks back here here it is see remember how god would tell israel when you come up against nations that are mightier than you because you're going to come up against some things that you can't control as far as in your natural but this is what god said god didn't god was making a deal about oh my you're afraid no god said when you are this is where i want you to look i want you to consider where god with this mighty hand and outstretched arm has brought you out of egypt i want you to remember how he crushed your enemies under his feet glory be to god when you are afraid remember when fear comes upon you when a doctor's report comes to you or something comes along my child's going this way i want you to remember that i'm the lord that brought you out i want you to remember it's i who did this so when fear comes you fight fear with the word of god and what is the word it's the working in your life you're not looking back to something a print you're looking back to see god brought me out it's a working of the word in my life i was a cockle burl i was born and sin shaped in iniquity and come to the world speaking lies born among sinners father and mother and my whole family sinners i was a of earl but all of a sudden i become a wheat grain how did that happen that's election god before the foundation of the world elected that tucker barrel and was to become a grain of wheat how does that happen god takes that of cocker bro it's ordained to become an expression of wheat so god opens up that kookaburra and he takes out the life and the nature that's there and he replaces it with wheat life talking about the blessing of abraham that he can close it right back up and though it's kookaburra on the outside it's sticky and everything else but on the inside it's wheat light so what actually bears out it's a mystery it's one of those things that you can look at in yourself you stir it still experience the cockle barrel you still experience dying daily you still experience having to repent and say lord forgive me for thinking that way or saying this what is it it is wheat life that is subduing cockerborough life what's happening wheat life is coming to pass and that war and battle will be until this wheat life has been fully developed but devil if you're listening it shall come to pass it shall come to pass even when i don't see it he's still working even when i don't feel it he's still working i am being changed by the spirit of almighty god [Music] [Applause] oh glory be to god no wonder paul could write knowing your election beloved knowing your election that it's not by chance the holy ghost has not come to you by chance it's not by chance all i was i was born in the message raising the message now it may have been a while before you receive the revelation of jesus christ but it's not by chance you're not here tonight by chance i'm not here by chance this is ordained by god are you hearing me tonight now notice even peter would write brethren give diligence all carefulness to make your calling and election sure hallelujah see god working how is election known election itself is known by the one who elected in the beginning by christ himself coming through his word and you begin to recognize and see that the same god he knew me all along let me just say it's like this as it comes to me there was there was a boy a young man and he had been in a battle and he had come under a great shock here they were as war as war soldiers they were going to be taken away and put in a mental asylum because they were shocked in their mind and here they came to us place and there was a stop that was made at this rest area or place they could get out and stretch their legs and here come one boy out of there now the bus or the train whichever it was is filled but one of them steps off of that train or that bus and all of a sudden the man who's in charge of them starts noticing immediately there's a different glory there's a different look starts coming in that boy's eyes he starts looking around you know he's looking around no doubt if we could break into his mind this is a familiar place things things look familiar here now he was set in amnesia he was under a shock he didn't know who he was and they were going to send him to a mental asylum but right there in that moment here that sergeant began to watch this young man and that young man began to walk and that sergeant just thought he would watch him he walked over this hill there was a path on this hill so the sergeant kept following he walked over that path down that path walked up another one and then as they as he walked over that one he's down by the time the sergeant gets up to that second one and he's looking he sees a little cabin and on this little cabin there was setting a man and he said the more that boy kept walking everything around him became more familiar [Applause] that's where he was born at that's a place he belonged the bus and the train was trying to take him to other places i think it'd be a good time tonight to get off the bus get off the train [Applause] and that sergeant began to look and what he saw at about that time here came that old gentleman off the couch you know why that gentleman when he ran and he embraced his son he said son they told me you had died he said but i knew you'd come home it shall come to pass he came to himself his surroundings began to jolt away that amnesia what does that the presence of god begins to break away everything else around you and you begin walking and you're walking and you're walking what's happening you're on your way home [Music] where you belong you belong in the arms of the lord jesus you belong in the promised land you belong in the land of canaan you belong in this word you belong in victory [Music] hallelujah that's where you belong the devil trying to give you everything in the world to satisfy scholarships and nothing wrong with scholarship nothing wrong with but he'll try to do everything he can to try to satisfy that thirst god put a thirst within you supernaturally that only he can satisfy him are you hearing me i'm gonna speak very plain this is why many times why people they try to search and satisfy their thirst with dating this one or mary and this one are doing this and this is why many times things end up because you know why they tried to satisfy that thirst in other ways and other means and god's the only one that can satisfy that thirst i tell you what i do i'd walk in obedience tonight and say lord i'm trying to figure i'm tired of figuring everything out because my mind has gotten me in trouble with everything so far i am not going to try to figure my way out of this i'm going to walk in obedience to your voice i'll tell you what you'll find you'll find yourself moving in position because the voice of god and obedience it brings you in position to where you will be above the world hallelujah let me just read this here tonight oh don't you love him in verse 13 and the lord shall make thee the head in the summit the beginning and not the tale and thou shalt be what above only and thou shalt not be beneath if thou hearken unto the commandments of the lord thy god which i commanded thee this day to observe and to do them you know and you might say well brother samuel then i'll tell you we don't ever have to work we're always going to be above we we we are above by the spirit of god but remember if we walk in disobedience to his word then god will allow the enemy to come around is that right it isn't god isn't sitting back like a great grandfather you know and white beard and everything else all my children can't do nothing wrong no god will correct us if we're wrong right you know what that is that's his love so that we might remain in the position of divine authority brian give me this right here and thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which i command thee this day to the right hand or to the left to go after other gods to serve them you see it shows even in that of pressures and things that would come our way but god said you just stand in the midst of everything i will make thee to be the head and not the tail you know what's powerful is that sometimes you feel like you're the tail but you're actually the head see now we're not talking about worldly standards let me let me let me qualify that we're not talking about earthly standards you see this right here is not a comic book of superman this is not a comic book of batman or whatever more or incredible hawk or incredible lives or any that's not what this is okay so in other words oh my where everybody who's a superhero man he just grabs them by the head and beats them up jesus showed us that real victory is through yielding to the word he prefigured it there through samson samson killed a lot when the spirit of god that would come upon him but he killed more in his death when he surrendered to almighty god he killed more right there at that moment he showed us in the midst of it all it's incredible when you listen to the message how can overcome that just the amount of how brother branham lays in on the humility of how that christ himself he gave himself in humility think of what calvary brought for you and i it brought the greatest victory what was there in the garden of gethsemane when every demon out of hell and torment was there and that great conference was hid was held right there in the garden of gethsemane and he said nevertheless not my will thine will be done he prayed it three times now to the way the world looks at things they could look at that and say well that ain't a conqueror that's a wimp but you see god veils his power in humility because he was after a mark it was there to defeat the enemy he was there to pay the sin price and through that submission showing you and i now have been given a liberty to submit our will to the will of almighty god my goodness my goodness you see that's the working of the head in our life the real the real tale in our life is not the devil the tale is that old cockapoo part god said i will make thee who's the v he's talking about that of his seed that of his sons and daughters notice i will make thee it speaks of creation right you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you not set you make you free we are his workmanship ephesians 2 created in christ jesus unto good works we are a new creation not the old creation reformed it's a new creation in christ jesus and the lord shall make thee the head and not the tale by dwelling and being in him so all of this god was declaring the power of the word of god moving in the life of the believer it lifts you in authority it gives you dominion and may i say this to you tonight it puts you in charge now you might be sitting here tonight and you say you don't know what i have in my life but the word has put you in charge that devil can only stay there if you allow him to do it are you hearing me the word has put you in charge as a son and daughter of god not you're going to be you are now the sons and daughters of god the word lets you know you aren't going to become good enough you could never be good enough but the word of faith which we preach is nothing even in thy mouth you have been placed back in charge of divine authority as a son and daughter of god not going to be we are now the sons and daughters of god you have authority with the word of god to say satan get out of here you're under my feet see repentance brings you it breaks the yoke of bondage upon your life what breaks the yoke the anointing is that right is that what isaiah had is that what isaiah had prophesied that the yoke of bondage the anointing shall break it what is the anointing it's the word it's christ himself coming to let you see that that yoke has already been conquered and you've got a right as a son and daughter of god to rise above whatever that bondage is you've got a right to throw it down and say i ain't no longer walking that way hallelujah you've got a right that if something is plaguing your mind well i don't care what it is you can line up every devil in the book even those that's not even named right yet he's all got it covered i'm the lord that healeth all thy diseases he's got it all covered hey man you listen let me just i'm closing here i'm not even going no more no more here right now but you recognize this is what the devil would like you to believe that you're some trodden down something you're not you're a son and daughter of god [Applause] you've got authority in the presence of god what should i do i'll tell you what i'd do esther i'd make my way to the king's throne you're not beholding a scepter of death this is a scepter that's extended to you the favor of the king has been extended to you in this hour oh what a wonderful reality it is when we're where we belong then prayer changes i'm no longer asking for things beyond me i'm asking for what i am i'm asking for what i am because i'm a part of the word let me tell you something god has placed by his word and authority in your life ask and you shall receive i believe it's his presence that stirs that up get it out of your head that you're going to be good enough someday you're never going to be good enough you can't be good enough you lick your spots all they do is stand out even more you ever tried to get a stain off one of your shirts or something like that don't put water on it the stain that goes from this big dot like that brother samuel i just grab a tie pen it's still there right you got to wash it but there is no way that you can ever get the stains of sin out you can never get it out of your life it takes the lord jesus christ to do that and let me tell you this promise right now that he will set you above that no matter what it is whatever it is that you're praying about listen already in the land as a believer when things come your way when has come your way when tests and trials come your way when you're standing before this city or this city you have been anointed to take down cities let me read you what the word says no man shall stand before thee all the days of thy life i don't care how old you get how weak you feel i don't care what you none shall be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life in other words you have been anointed you have been called you have positioned to put every devil under your foot and when the purpose of god has been fulfilled then we go home [Applause] and that's part of the blessing of abraham let's pray heavenly father lord how we thank you for your mercy once again lord oh god how that lord in such a reality lord you come and you make known to us not something that we're going to be but lord who we are already and lord god then as sons and daughters of god we can rise with the authority of the word of god lord that has spoken to us in this hour not a man's word but the word of god that has been declared by the holy spirit so lord god we're not speaking under enthusiasm we are speaking under the divine inspiration that is moved upon our heart that is stirred within our heart lord god of faith that goes beyond unbelief doubt what we could explain lord it rises into that place lord to believe you for all things now lord you know where every life and every heart is at tonight i pray that god that may every child of god in this building and those lord that are hearing it or will hear it by way of the internet may they rise and may they take their liberty in jesus christ may they take the dominion that is given to them as sons and daughters of god and realizing lord that the enemy doesn't have any charge over them i don't care if that spirit of anxiety it has to flee it don't have charge over them that's spirit of depression it don't have charge over them lord god no matter what it is lord we have been given authority as the sons and daughters of god to believe the word of god and to exercise our rights in it we don't have to make an excuse lord god we stand in the promise of almighty god and lord to stand there with a full assurance knowing that the god who made the promise we can say it shall come to pass glory hallelujah i shall see the lord i shall see his working i shall see his manifestation i shall see victory i shall see deliverance i shall see healing in my life working even now by the word of faith granted lord we pray in the name of jesus christ amen and amen hallelujah don't you love him hallelujah you're not trotted down you've been placed in charge amen you're in charge as a son and daughter of god hallelujah back where i belong walking as a son and daughter of god and looking around and i think how brother brown says at the one time he says that young man as he was walking over them hills he said he began to see a water tower in an incredible a water tower he begins to see these different landmarks and he recognizes this is home you see what the word of god as it comes to you all it asks you to walk in the light as he's in the light and we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ your son cleanses us from all unrighteousness there's an authority in your life that god has placed there let me tell you something this this message tonight did not place that authority in your life are you hearing me what's been spoken tonight the all it does is it awakens the authority that god's already placed there and when you can recognize that you could say death will get behind me therefore you don't have no right here that's why you can pray when you're asking for the holy ghost you're seeking remember you can realize it's not something of a perhaps something of a maybe you're standing in a place where you belong prayer is changing from a maybe soul to this is my promise when sickness arise prayer is different you're standing there with a promise by his stripes i am healed prayer has changed brother dave because we're aware we belong glory glory be to god don't feel good to be home hallelujah it feels good to be home oh man i love to be home i love to be home no other place i'd rather preach minister there ain't no other bed i'd rather sleep in there ain't another room there ain't no other pillows ain't nothing hey nothing to me like being home right and nothing like it when you know you're home and to think about it this world itself is not my home are you with me the reason that this guy feels at home here is because this is where god's ordained me to be to serve his purpose but but there's a greater there's a greater place that i'm dwelling a greater place than i'm receiving direct communication from and that is our conversation is from heaven i am receiving direct communication from the word of god this is my constitution and this constitution has declared freedom are you hearing me four horse riders of death tried to bring in bondage but there has been a ministry of jesus christ that has come to declare liberty and restore every promise that god had made in the book you talking about a declaration of independence this is our liberty oh when prayer changes when prayer changes don't you love him glory be to god so we're not approaching him as a pauper we're not we're approaching god with an assurance in our life whatever that need is remember you are a son and daughter of god whatever promise it is you claim that promise right now whatever it is healing job whatever remember all these we read in deuteronomy 28 god said these blessings will overtake you they're spiritual blessings to us in christ jesus let's stand glory be to god in the highest yeah i'll tell you i tell you how i feel i want him to continue to overtake me i want him to continue to overtake me until eventually he had been so overtaken like enoch i'm no longer here i'm there i want that word to so overtake in my life i want everything to be so lined up with him he the blessing has come upon me there's been an overtaking brother shane by the new birth but now that overtaking you know what it is it's a molding it's a shaping it's an active working of the holy ghost in our life to one of these moments brother carlos we're going to be changed in a moment in a drinking of an eye we are not people that's wandering around in uncertainty we're you know even those of you that are older than me even by me being younger doesn't mean that i'm guaranteeing more days and more years than you but here we are standing no matter if you are 99 years old tonight you can stand here with a full assurance to know we are living in the day of the coming of the lord we are living in the moment because the lord himself has descended in this hour in the promise of his word and you can say it shall come to pass the rapture is right you're not going to be a part of it you are a part of the rapture right now it shall come to pass it shall come to pass glory to god why don't you just say it right now it shall come to pass glory be to god oh hallelujah glory be to god in the eyes sing something for us brother brian glory be to god oh my let's just worship him here tonight thank you lord glory be to god we've been created to praise the lord hallelujah we've been created and created hallelujah almighty god as david spoke about prophecy in psalms that zion that the favor of god has been poured out upon zion her walls have been built up again the word has returned and the favor of god is poured out upon zion we have been created to praise the lord [Music] glory be to god let me tell you something this same working of the blessing of abraham ruth that's working through your life that has brought forth jesus christ what will it do it'll be handed back to naomi it will be handed back to naomi this same gospel of jesus christ will be handed back to naomi it will be handed back to the jews glory be to god and those two witnesses will stand there with the anointing and authority of god and they will open that sick seal and declare the coming of the lord to those jews what a time we're living in what a time the favor of god has been poured out upon you you know what the favor of god is and ain't anything you can merit it's not what i merit but the favor of god is his presence that has come to let you know this is who you are you belong to me you were always mine i always knew you you were you were in my mind all along when when i when i spoke my word because you are a part of that word you were a part of me i spoke your name in here now you might look and you may not find your name as far as written out by an earthly name but that ain't the name you're known in earth by that name like you're known as paul in the earth i'm known as samuel but you see our name was included by divine inspiration by the word that would be given in this hour and what the word does when it sounds out it calls your name it's just something that resonates in your heart and you say that's me if you're like me i was raised in this message all my life born i never knew nothing else but you know what i had to meet him i had to meet him i had to meet him predestinated oh yes i'm certain of that i believe that by the grace of god but you know what that is it just shows there's that pathway that god came seeking for me not me seeking for him a person could say oh i saw god i sought god no the only reason you had a desire for god because god put that in you think of the victory of the desire of the word in your life that even of all of the world and all of the pleasures of the world could not silence the voice of god's desire in your life you talk about victory you talk about victory but what about now when victory has come to lift you in victory how many here ever rode in an elevator before probably everybody escalator right i appreciate them things especially when i'm late for a plane those things that move along you know i appreciate that yeah now there ain't not there's not one person brother nobody is sitting there saying pulling up that elevator no we get in close the door [Music] what floor are you going to i'm going the second floor third floor they push the button what does it do you just rise to the place where you're going see god makes known to you where you belong what do i do just step in him step into his presence where you're at right now you don't have to step clear up here you can step right into his presence right where you're at right now and he will lift you above he'll lift you above like that escalator taking you up or taking you to your destination he will take you there amen that's why brother brandon could say in restoration of the bride tree he said you just let go and the holy ghost will take you to the baptism of the holy ghost the holy ghost will take you to your healing i don't know about you but i say lord let every finger be pried away because he will take me there whatever the need is tonight whatever it is in your life just just step into his presence right here at these moments and just let him take you right there prayer changes because you're in a time of worship you realize what you're asking for he's here and wants to do for you amen can we just worship him here can we just love him and just thank him hallelujah brother brian would you lead us please thank you lord glory [Music] overtake me with your glory [Music] overwhelm me [Music] me all [Music] let's just worship him let's just

it's by grace set your wings to the [Music] watch your mountain that's much too high oh seeds of abraham royal speak the word of god [Music] [Applause] hallelujah [Music] you can fly in a higher place [Music] do not struggle it's my grace set your wings to the winds of faith watch the eagle in the sky [Music] glory be to god in the highest [Music] [Applause] is [Music] you can fly in a higher place do not struggle for reach by grace [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's [Music] [Applause] [Music] of faith we've been made more than conquerors [Music] overcomers in this [Music] we've been made victorious through the blood of jesus christ you're having the right king or is it wrong [Music] hallelujah glory we've been made new creation in christ jesus i will make thee the head and not the tale glory be to god hallelujah let's sing this oh don't you just love him and they're just wonderful just just stepping in his presence friends the word the whole the ministering of the word his presence he's come gives his inspiration that you and i can step into that place just worshiping and just let him take you like the song said just set your wings because the power is already in the skies i tell you that that that you feel right here that's the heavenlies that has sent down right here in this building tonight it's the heavenlies that make you feel at home it's the presence of god that drives back the fear of the enemy that lets you know you're in charge you know that person that was out there and slaving away in the field when they heard that sound of the jubilee they didn't have to ask nobody can i throw this down this sounding let them know you're free that's it they could drop it right there what a reality that is in his presence we can just soar and keep soaring it
