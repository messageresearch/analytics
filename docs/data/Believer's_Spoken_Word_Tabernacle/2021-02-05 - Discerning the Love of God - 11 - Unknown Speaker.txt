daniel is the same god who's here with us tonight amen he's the same god amen so we just we're just so appreciative and so thankful for his mercy in this hour that we can know him amen think of how god revealed himself to paul thou art chosen to know the lord god amen we're chosen amen and what a glorious privilege it is certainly isn't it isn't how the world or how the carnal mind thinks it is but god it comes always according to his plan and his program and it bypasses the high mind and the wisdom of this world and it comes in such simplicity amen and if you know if it wasn't for the grace of god you and i would have missed it the brahman said if the word did not become flesh he said it would have blinded the very land to see god god his word becoming flesh is that that light itself would shine and it would reach our lives to unveil god to us now it's not just god unveiled to us it's god and being unveiled in us amen so we just we're so thankful to the lord and god bless you musicians thank you for amen the sacrifice and so good to see each and every one of you and i just want to continue to remember one another in prayer let's just look here before we as we turn to the word i just want to go to the lord in prayer and if you have a need you'd just like to make that known to the lord and i just ask that we just pray for one another and that god will just just come among us in a very special way tonight amen we haven't come here to be seen we've come here to hear from god come here that are that he would speak to our hearts and we would just yield ourselves to him and he knows what we have need of so let's just let's come together and just approach him now heavenly father lord as we are just so thankful to be here this evening lord thankful that you have made a way lord an opportunity for us and we just your god are asking that you will just lord have your way tonight lord there's many needs lord that would be upon our hearts those that we had read lord in the prayer request and there's other needs lord that are unspoken there's situations there's questions lord your god you're the only one that can really minister lord to the needs in our lives lord so we we're not asking for the right words to say we're we're simply asking for the holy spirit that you would just lord just put the words together that lord would be pleasing and that god that you would be so identified oh god in our midst here this evening and just lord the faith would just rise no matter what the need or the circumstance is lord that when we would leave from this place lord that we would walk out from here god just knowing that not only have we been in the presence of god but how that you have just so ministered to our need lord and we just lord want to invite you as we just lay aside the cares of this life and of this day lord just desiring to enter in lord to your presence lord that we might hear from you father i pray that you'll just help us lord help him help speaker and hear that we can just get out of the way lord that you can come here tonight and minister to our needs lord and speak to every heart heal those that are sick among us lord deliver the captive lord turn hearts tonight lord fill lives lord with your holy spirit o god may you just have your way we pray lord as we just lord submit ourselves to you lord and just ask for your complete lord leading and direction here tonight we love you and we thank you father in the name of jesus christ amen let's look here in first corinthians chapter 13 verse 4 we'll just read that verse of scripture and we'll just let you have your seats we've been looking here in in parts within this particular scripture or the scriptures in this chapters is dealing with charity which is the love of god it's god's own life and here as paul would write charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not and we've looked at this for some weeks on that part on envy if not and envy is where one could look at someone else and be jealous whether it be gift or whether it be something in their life or or in something in that measure and then now the next part that we would look at is charity vaunteth not itself and is not puffed up so instead of looking at someone else or looking at something else but this another another part of it that paul would write of what charity is not is that which would try to bring itself up or make itself something that it's really not so it's it's such a it's a contrast of that of of envy but yet it still is under the same operation and this is one of those other parts that paul is dealing with of what charity is not may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated we we look at this and in the in the amplified bible that latter part it deals with what we wrote or what we've read charity vaunteth not itself and is not puffed up it says it's not boastful or vain glorious it does not display itself heartily this word vaunteth that's used here it deals with that which a very simple term would be that of a braggart one who brags or who makes things known you know the scripture is very clear it says let not the left hand know what the right hand is doing there's things that that were in reality when we look at this and how god would would show and would would teach us these things of how that god many times he visits our life and god will speak to us and things that god would even use us in a in a way and in a measure and and part of that being used is also to test and see if he's going to be able to further use us because if him using us and it's truly let me just say it like this it's a very it's a glorious thing to be used of god it's a tremendous thing as many times that you step back and you realize that it was it was sometimes there's things that you maybe were saying or doing or maybe you were praying for someone you didn't feel anointed you didn't even feel like you had my that these were such great words it might have been that you were fumbling with your words and you might have left out of there and thought my i i certainly wish i would have had better words but yet god himself you'll find that maybe he moved in that situation and he moved in that way and god would move in that manner because it would be something that you or i would not in any way think and we would recognize my what i thought what i thought was going to come out or might be how i felt i maybe didn't feel worthy but god would move in such a time as that and then the test would be to come after that what are we going to do with it you know when i was there i think when i was here within um uh in jeffersonville there this past um july i think it was was it honey was it july or august i don't even remember what month it was because it was such a blur within those times but you know one thing that i can i can say that one thing that the brothers when they we were going around and you'll hear brother branham even on tape you never hear you don't hear brother branham telling about the things that was done in the meeting unless it maybe would be something that god would would somewhat inspire of brother branham to say but you don't find him and brother brown would even say i don't even you know go about in telling the things that are done because we recognize it's god will share his glory with no man and if our desire our desire as i said moments ago it's a glorious thing to be used of god and let's just be honest with one another even those times when you've prayed for someone god maybe has used you to express a word or something or whether it feels good to be used by god but it's something that we must always keep in mind that it that it did not come because that we were something or somebody or even that we were to in turn share that with somebody else because when god's not obligated to use us over and over and over as a matter of fact brother branham would tell us that sometimes even when it comes to the nine spiritual gifts brother braham says everyone who is born of the spirit is subject to any of the nine spiritual gifts at any time and he says they mill that's the terminology brother brown would use they mill throughout the body he said god might use this one tonight and may never use this person again so we just it you know the reality is is we're just thankful that god just to be a part of the economy of god and that god would use us and you know the real reality of it is is that those that maybe have been used in the greatest way no one knows about it and that's great because god does not and he will not share his glory with any man god does not let me just say it like this god does not want you or i looking after any man as though oh if i can just talk to this man if i can just go sit down in this person's living room god doesn't want us to look into man that way he wants us to recognize he's the great one in our midst and god does not want even for that that that's not even something that god would put upon a person god desires that all adoration all worship would go to him even when they come to the lord jesus and said good master and he said why call us thou me good there is one good worship him and that is god you see to recognize that it's god who is in our midst and so when we we think of this term of vaunteth it's not boastful or vainglorious or of empty glory it's this word it deals to boast oneself a self-display employing radical uh radical uh embellishments installing oneself excessively you know perhaps that each and every one of us and i'll i just say depending on our makeups and how we are but i could say that we probably each and everyone could share we've been around people that where maybe they talk and everything you would think that they ate donuts with the angels are you with me it was though that as everything is oh this is this and this and this and this and it would be in that manner now there's a lot of things that we could go into that sometimes that it isn't that god doesn't visit people we understand that he doesn't he does visit us but we're also very much aware of these things and we know that within it of how that you know it should never be that we are drawing attention to self but it's drawing attention to almighty god this is why brother rahm said when you're choosing a pastor for the church do not choose a man who is of reputation but choose one who has no reputation choose one that because then that man that individual is his desire is to serve god to serve that of the word serving the people he doesn't have a reputation that he has to keep up and so here you find in the scripture it goes on to say of this uh of the word and it's not puffed up and you know you think of that puffed up forgive me but the only thing i always get in my mind is i've looked over this is you know those puffer fish when they get into a state and you know somebody's coming after them and it's offending them and why does it do that it wants to make itself bigger to intimidate the opposing force but you see that's contrary to the kingdom of god the kingdom of god is not that we puff ourselves up to make ourselves bigger because in reality that fish didn't get any bigger it only got more full of air and so to be puffed up is to become full of a lot of hot air are you with me you see this is why it says to make proud or to bear oneself lawfully to be proud and and i thank god for his mercy that no matter let me just say it like this no matter where we've come from in our backgrounds because we recognize here tonight that there's not one of us that can say well i come out of a perfect home i had a perfect father i had a perfect mother not one of us can say that because there's one perfect parent and that's the lord jesus christ and every parent that is filled with the holy ghost it looks to him god that you would guide me even as a parent you would direct me but we recognize not just in parenting but even as a believer in christ that we are to reflect and look and to look into the word and see because the word will show our weaknesses it'll show where we're lacking and when it shows that then the desire is lord let me just yield to myself lord mold and make me because remember the bible said whosoever looketh into the perfect law of liberty you cannot look down on the word the bible says looketh into and that scripture that word means one who crouches down to see something that is so low you see the word has a way when it's coming forth and it's and it's actually being ministered it does not it's not so much where it's causing us to be puffed up but it brings us down into a place of humility to be able to look in and to see the true riches and the character and the nature of god you know what's happening there's a humbling that's going on even in our heart to say be it unto me lord according to that word we never want to vaunt ourselves or lift ourself or as it says in first thessalonians 4 that the man of sin setting he said in the temple of god as he is god exalteth himself above all that's called god that's the very precept of the world of the religion of babylon of every system of man that's the very precept of it so when paul would deal with this i want to just maybe take this approach in and how the lord would just just lead this tonight as we look at this that what charity is not and paul when if we look at this and we remember that the charity itself that paul is speaking of he's speaking of god's own life he's speaking of god he's speaking of the very nature of god and paul is not just he's not writing or speaking to them in terms of of something that he doesn't know about or what he's read about but paul's expressing of what he knows by an experience because you see this was a man right here that god took a man who knew multiple languages he was a pharisee of the pharisees he was one that was very paul was as a very as brother branham would put it an intellectual servant of god paul was very astute he he knew many things but you see in order to know god he had to be willing to loose himself from everything that he ever knew and become yoked and tied into christ you see now it wasn't just that he knew the law he knew all these things he knew that before but now he and there was an experience that unfolded what the word had spoke of and through all the time it unfolded the very character and the heart of almighty god this is why paul could write if i can say it in this way he's writing of the coming of the lord and how that the coming of the lord was so great it was so great but it was not great in the way that men and people look at it it was it came in a way that was despised by the world but yet it was a great way how god came he came in such simplicity to think of it you know i couldn't help but thinking of the words of this song that we sing brother branham he loved this song and he would have you know uh brother booth clyburn to sing the song over and over down from his glory and to think of the of this of the words what condensation bringing us redemption that in the dead of night not one faint hope in sight but god gracious tender laid aside his splendor stooping to woo to win to save my soul oh how i love him how i adore him my breath my sunshine my all in all the great creator became my savior and all god's fullness dwelleth in him god let him know in isaiah 7 14 of his coming therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name emmanuel you see we hear over and over it's true what man calls great god calls foolish and what man calls foolish god calls great let me just tell you the those who have been really connected with god down through the ages have been considered as fools or nuts or crazy people they've been considered in a way that well if god surely was going to speak or to say something he would come our way he would come through us i want you to think of this that even every time when god would send his message of deliverance through noah through moses through abraham on and on we could go and yet you would find that there were people who would stand against that word there were men of great intellect great men of great renown take moses for example god took moses in the backside of the desert and for 40 years he took out or unpacked everything that egypt had packed into him in order to bring him into a place of complete humility a place to where that god could then make himself known to moses and moses would even would even look at himself and say i'm not even fit for the job i i can't even talk right and and all of these other things but god had him in a place that he wanted him in because the place that god wants every one of his children in is in a place of humility where they recognize i can't do this on my own i can't even do it lord i need you and i need you every day lord i need you every moment of my life god brings us into those places to think every time it's been god will allow the schools of thought and intellect of man to go forth and and take promises like we just read here in isaiah brother brown tells us that many of the young girls they would they would grow throughout am i that young lady am i that young one many of them were looking many of them were watching but you recognize there was a predestinated womb there was one in whom this word was speaking of and when it was spoken to think how god would move in such a way and how it would come about they could read it but they didn't understand it and when it did come to pass they here because they were so blinded by the theology by all of that where men had taken the word and when man get a hold of the word listen to me now when man gets ahold of the word he explains away the supernatural god and if you take the supernatural god away from the word you've got nothing but a dead letter this is why the word apart from the word himself is nothing but a dead letter but it takes the word himself the holy ghost to get in the word and then the word becomes a living word it becomes a word that discerns the thoughts and intents of the heart it becomes a word that reveals itself as a mighty one as a deliverer as an overcomer the letter killeth but the spirit gives life when he came satan made sure after this come about and this man here is mary she's with child the holy ghost has overshadowed her this is god's super sign but yet the name that the devil places upon it is he is the son of a drunken roman soldier who ravished this girl are you with me and god didn't try to do anything about that either let that sink in god didn't make videos on it let me prove why this he didn't do that that's the world there are those who fall under that in the world but it didn't matter of all the lies the debauchery it didn't matter how many called him beelzebub and this and that that didn't matter you're not going to stop the elect from the light of god reaching their life i don't care how much of a bad name and a black mark and once you try to lay on it you can't stop the power of the revealed word hallelujah let satan try to puff himself up but you cannot fort nor stop the power of this word it comes in such humility it was god's super sign let me just move ahead quick and then we'll come back in this hour revelations 10 the opening scripture says and i saw another mighty angel it's a coming that's the angel of the lord that's the fullness of the holy ghost that's christ himself descending with the little book this is a book of redemption this is this is a word that is sent to call the elect of god in finishing up in this hour notice a mighty angel but yet to the world if we look at it in terms of the carnal mind it looks like wow it's something great that's out there it'll reach to the nerve centers my everybody will want it no it must follow and it will go according to everything in the past it is despised and rejected it comes in such humility the mighty god the great coming of the holy ghost in his fullness and yet the world writes it off men can look and say well you know brother branham you know he's a prophet and while we're looking at this you know just seeing him and just saying the clip here the other day you're a man he's looking at the sixth vision he's man's not even a believer as far as what we follow but you're aware of that sixth vision and brother branham says in there he says i see a great woman rising to power a few weeks ago you know i hear him at home and and a brother sends me a text and he sends me the text another pastor and he sends me the text and he sends me the picture of the inauguration and here you find the the person in the office of vice president standing there in the very dress color that the prophet saw her standing in he said i seen her standing there in a deep royal purple tell me what anybody else has on that tell me what other organization or other thing can say that [Applause] he said i saw that woman it's all tied in now look this individual said well you know i this could be i i really think you know this could be and then he goes into the part of the seventh vision where the the the the uh the nation is laid in ashes and i don't want to preach on that tonight but to look at where many will say he's a prophet but you see the reality is is they don't recognize really what a prophet is sure prophecy visions sure the prophets they god shows them things but a prophet is one whom the word of the lord comes to this is why it's not enough with just the bible [Music] you've got to have the word of the lord which is the revelation of jesus christ that comes upon that word and makes that word live and declares that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever god could have come think about this he bypassed all of the great schools brother brown stood in oral roberts things to open the mail as the mail came through and what did he say he said i'd be ashamed for them to come and see my office a little itty bitty trailer god never chose to come to the nerve centers you know why they would reject it let me tell you something this message has not been in a corner and let me just put this personal right now this message is not on trial right now it's already been put on trial god's vindicated it i'll tell you what's being put on trial is people's faith the message has already been vindicated [Music] [Applause] it's not on trial so we're not falling under the trap of the enemy to try to go back and prove it right man can't prove it it's god who proves it how does he prove it the same way he interprets his word god interprets his word so to see this of how god even how brother branham would put it in such a way god did not open up these seven sales inside of a denomination you know why they won't receive it see sometimes we we can kind of skim over things you recognize god's not going to reveal where there's no heart that's open to receive it well brother simon how do you how will the heart come open god knows if their heart can be opened and if there's a heart that can be open let me just tell you something the word will find its way there but no man no manner of explaining it is going to open one's heart that takes the presence of almighty god it may not even be a chapter that you're reciting it can be your very life and testimony of how your candle got lit and it'll open that life to a reality that there is a living god a man right here that can turn on the light my god didn't come in that manner now that's here's where we're at in this hour so when we look at this i want to read through a few scriptures here tonight in philippians 2 verse 5. don't worry i won't be much longer but i i got a little warm there verse five notice how paul would capture this the essence of god's own nature where because we're talking about charity vaunteth not itself it doesn't puff itself up charity doesn't do that now you and i have done that sometimes yep you and i have done that sometimes let this mind be in you he's talking about this character this nature let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god and word robbery's a key if you've got it in your margin you see it says it's not a thing to be grasped for in other words jesus wasn't trying to reach out for something he was what god made him he was relying and resting on what god had made him he wasn't trying to grasp and notice verse 7 here well these scriptures are just powerful but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of man this is quite incredible because as he would make himself of no reputation think of it brother brown would say it like this he said here was the king of glory who made the eye and yet the man who made the artificial eye has a reputation for making it but here's the god who made the eye here's the god who made the lake but he never made himself a reputation [Music] and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross wherefore god also hath highly exalted him so who exalted him god but he didn't exalt him until he humbled himself see god never humbled the son he humbled himself and because what was the greatest humility now he could have went along and helped elderly women cross the street and you know and baked suppers and dinners and carried them in boxes and all that right there but to realize that the humility even though that he could look upon those who were in need remember when the multitudes were following them and he would say they need something to eat all of that was something where he would take such care and the compassion of god but yet even within all of that of all that he could have done for that of humanity but yet the greatest humility in order to restore what had been lost in the fall it would require that of one who would come with such complete humility to full obedience to the word in order to bring you and i back home in order for a way to be made for us that at the very name of jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father once you think of that he made himself of no reputation i mean these are the thoughts when you think of it this is the very unfolding of this life and this character it's in such contrast to that of the world and you know us as a bible reader when we speak of the world we're not speaking of the earth the world is the system world of the world itself it entered there as satan himself he entered into that place there of the serpent and began to speak to eve and he drew eve into a place he's he's talking to her and he's he's moving upon her for her to let down but also not just to let down but now to try to present something to her this is something you don't have this is something god's keeping back from you and she begins to well have a desire for that and it's the whole part he's pulling upon to think of it what a paradox he's pulling in a place with an anointing of pride upon her life that she and herself would come into a place that though god intended and god had laid laid out in his word of that that they would multiply and replenish but as far as the mystery within it and the whole plan of god it had not been revealed as of yet to them but god god had given his word and the greatest thing that we can learn in this time is to wait on god i hope you understand what i'm saying there's things that god can speak to you like he did to abraham and said i'm going to bl i blessed you and i made you a father of many nations and the question would come how's it going to be how's it going to happen there's a lot of times you and i are faced with faith how's this going to happen when's it going to be what's it going to be like you don't have the answers for it neither do we have to feel ashamed that we don't have the explanation all we have to know is god said it and he's going to find me waiting right here for him to come and fulfill it the one that spoke it will ensure that i'm right where i need to be when that comes to pass he made himself of no reputation he could have i said he could have i want you to think of it when he came he did not come under a whole angel salute matter of fact there was that which you know it started over there to the wise men who were in the east they traveled west but they didn't get there until he was already a boy the bible never said they came to see the infant said they came to see the child is that right and the gifts what was revealed to them by the star they came with the gifts that would identify who he was on earth is that right and to think here with the great pomp and all of this that was there religious men caiaphas and all the rest of them in jerusalem mighty people but yet here the angels they come to shepherds that are out there on the hillside they come to shepherds and they make them make it known in that hour behold unto you this day is born in the city of david a king and here the shepherds themselves they come under that announcement the angels are singing and the shepherds come there there's a welcoming that's taking place the wise men the religious of that day were not there as a part of his birth as a matter of fact it bypassed them you see this is some things that we as god just chose us that we never want to become high in our thinking such as that we know something the bible said when a man thinketh he knows something he knoweth not what he ought to know you see it's discerning how the enemy would want to come in upon our lives and how god god will buy god will just bypass beyond that you realize you could sit in a service like this and say i've heard that you could finish this out you could finish that out and you might be able to finish out every scripture you might be able to finish out every quote and you would miss god god can come in such a simple way he can say what he has to say maybe in 10 minutes and you'd think i wasn't even settled in yet god can say what he needs to say he don't need a certain amount of time there's a purpose even when he called this service tonight knowing we would be here there is there is that which god wants to speak to our hearts and minister to our lives he made himself of no reputation think of it he took upon him the garment of humanity i want you to think in the scriptures there look in the scriptures and just pull it up tell no man you'll find tell no man jesus recessed that eight different times in the scripture when those that were healed here they passed through and they received their sight and they received the cleansing of leprosy and what was his what was the announcement he charged him the bible says tell no man every time tell no man he could have made himself a reputation but you see this is what's contrary to that of the world this world this system is based on this is a scriptural term pomp this is satan's pomp his pride every all that is here i will make uh you know i will ascend into the sides of the north i will be worshipped even as god he is putting himself it's a puffing up it's vaunting up it's trying to put into a place to draw attention to himself this is so contrary when god comes he comes in such humility that the very god of glory who was the very one who spoke in the beginning and the earth that he walked on he created hallelujah to think about how that even what he would experience in his own life he would experience what it was to suffer he would experience what it was to have a headache he would experience what he was to feel temptation god would condescend in such a way he would make himself of no reputation on the contrary nobody wanted anything to do with him i'm just going to preach i'll leave my notes here the bible says there was no beauty that we should desire him he was not a man that would be attractive matter of fact let me tell you what brother branham called him in the message mighty conquer he said he was a skinny spindly king skinny he was not a great big man that was you know everything you know the brother said we're all muscles and things like that he said real man isn't measured by muscles some of us can say thank god for that it's not measured by that but he says it's measured by the character see how see how contrary it is to the system of the world the system of the world is i get bigger i get tougher and muscles and they would look at look how the pharisees and even the religious zealots in that day they hated rome and they knew you should not be hating anyone but they hated them they hated them but here the lord jesus would come and say love your enemies they wanted him they looked at him in a manner come and let's overthrow rome let's overthrow this but even as he stood in pilate's hall and pilate would say he says are you king of the jews thou sayest and everything that they could say against him standing right there even in pilat's hall he would say that if my kingdom was of this world then would my servants fight for it help me preach let's not fight for this kingdom it's going down brother let's fight for that kingdom that we have received and been born of let's give everything we got now is my kingdom not of this world in temptation satan takes him up into a high mountain you know paul would write even high things won't separate us from the love of god is that right what's paul dealing with perception he takes him up and here is a natural desire after 40 days he's hungry and here's what satan does if thou be the son of god turn these stones into bread you say what's that pulling on satan is trying to get him to clown he's trying to see can i i am the son of god i am the son of god he's trying to see if what he's saying can get him puffed up now truly all three of these temptations all that's in the world lust of the eyes lust of the flesh and the pride of life and here he is that test is passed as he stands upon the word that shall worship the lord thy god he stands there on the word and here satan takes him to another place satan didn't give up he took him to another place took him to the pinnacle right there in the city cast thyself down if thou be the son of god on and on we could go and jesus he stood there thou shalt worship the lord the lord thy god only you know you know what as it says you see satan is trying to pull him in a place to where he feels like he has to prove something let me just tell you something you don't have to prove nothing to the devil are you with me stop trying to convince him you're a christian stop trying to convince him well you know i don't know about this stop trying to convince him you're the one who had the experience you're the one who knows don't have to prove nothing to him are you with me if thou be the son of god it stood in the midst of temptation he offered him a great position many can pass on through those parts brother braham takes that in the message of harvest time here the last part a position is promised a position among men i will give thee the kingdoms of the world i will give you a bishop place i will give you as a presiding elder i will give you a part in the church i will give you a part it's promised apart but the word stood the test each time that temptation didn't end he goes down in john chapter seven i've got it there but i just want to just i just want to go he comes among his brethren and his brethren come to him now the bible says they didn't believe him but here's what they said to him no man that does miracles like this and has signs keep it to himself and doesn't show it to everybody but jesus knew they didn't believe him see it's discerning and what he was trying to do here was his brethren when he met him on the mountain that was not somebody else satan was there but now right down here the discernment comes on what satan's trying to do is drawn out to puff it up sure show yourself make yourself known what's he trying to do get him to move into a place of reputation oh glory be god but how the king of glory he came down and not just listen of the scripture what we just read not only did he take upon the likeness of sinful flesh but the scripture goes on to say he took on him the form of a servant and in that he was found as a man see here he come in humanity we look and say my your god has taken upon the garments of humanity but that alone wasn't enough he humbled himself i tell you one thing you can say this is true the lord jesus lived what he preached when they started arguing about who's supposed to be the greatest among them he let him know this is the kind of things that the gentiles the world seeks after you know how the world gets great steps on this one to step on that one to step on this one to step on that that's how the world the world the world you see it's it's after position where does that motivation come from hmm i will ascend you see it's a desire for power but power without character is satanic the bible said to make the captain of their salvation perfect it was sufferings you wonder why the tests and the trials that you have to go through sometimes you wonder why sometimes like the lord jesus or maybe you've got something that's been said about you his name was a black name but he didn't spend his life trying to explain that see this is discernment he didn't explain he didn't try to do that you think it didn't hurt him let me say hurt him you think he didn't feel it come on the bible says he was tempted in all points such as we are sure brother branham lets us know he listen he had to turn his head brother the same as you have to turn your head the bible said suffered in hebrews chapter 2 that means to undergo a sensible experience brother brown would put it just as plain as this how can overcome he said jesus was tempted to take the kingdoms without suffering tempted means pulled his flesh was pulled sometimes we wonder why we have to go through the things we go through sometimes there's not one of us in here not one of us the like to feel dumb and sometimes you wonder after you come out of a situation you seem like you got a lot of words to say then well if i could have just said this then if i'd just said this if this would have come then if this would have come then is that right sometimes what it is and you say well i'm going to make sure that it don't happen again listen friends there's a part of that that maybe you don't recognize that's god there's many times you look in the scriptures jesus turned aside much more than he stood and answered they tried to press on him the bible said they pressed upon him with questions vehemently to try to getting to say something like moses struck the rock out of anger they tried to get on him he was tempted god so condescended in such a measure to be tempted he was tempted with pride charity vaunteth not itself he was tempted with pride he had no bed to lay his head someone said can i follow you he said come but the son of man doesn't even have a place to lay his head i don't have no fine place to take you to see it wasn't about a drawing he was drawing to god the bible says god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself in humility and here he is a great warrior and in the closing moments the bible says it in this manner in john 13. when he knew he knew his time has come he knew what the father had given him to do after supper is over he's already told them remember before when they were arguing he already told them i am one among you as one who serveth you see somebody that's always wanting to be served that ain't of god but i need to be this or i need to do this so people thought it this way what you need is a needle to pop that air i'm glad god can can bring that needle and pop our air aren't you down at the altar and say forgive me lord [Applause] he said i'm one among you that service here he steps forward his final moments his final moments final moments you're finished with supper he steps aside and he girds himself with an apron he takes water he gets the water he don't say hey hey brother gabriel you'll get me the water he doesn't say that he goes and gets it because anyhow he'd have to be the one to bring the water to our lives we sure couldn't get it he had to bring it to us is that right so here he comes he takes the water and he kneels down in front of them and he begins to wash their feet and peter no lord you're not going to wash my feet no lord no peter if i don't do this you have no part with me see jesus was speaking much deeper than just foot washing he was talking about soul washing are you with me here he is the lowest of low think how brother branham would say this over and over you're familiar with the message said what made him so great to me is he was able and he made himself so little miracles after miracles signs after signs wonders after wonders but he made himself of no reputation being in the form of god thought it not robbery he wasn't out there trying to prove who he was he didn't clown for the enemy trying to prove he took the form of a servant he humbled himself to the word and as god revealed to him what to do god never revealed to him hey go defend your name let's even get that black mark off of your name what they're saying about you god never told him hey this criticism you need to get this criticism away from you they're criticizing you they called him beelzebub what are you saying brother samuel jesus didn't occupy himself trying to change people's minds about him he didn't try to put on some sort of a perception neither as we said he didn't make himself a reputation but here's the king of glory standing in all humility one who stopped the wind the waves obeyed him the god of glory but yet he did not want himself at all tempted in all points let me close with this tempted in all points such as we are yet without sin there's no one of you or i can see that but he had to be that for us that we might receive that perfect life inside of us that that perfection of life inside of you or me that when we are tempted when we have got a little puffed up the spirit of god brings a correction and says you're approaching that wrong you're calling you're going about this the wrong way and correction comes into our life because he was willing to become so low think how brother braham said it he said here come the king of glory down to the lowest city jericho and he got so low that the shortest man in the city had to climb up in the tree to look down on him this is why just close brother branham would admonish us by the scripture much more but just to lay this foundation tonight the more simple you can become the more humble the more god can use you this is the things that even with what god has opened and what he's revealed to us we realize it's the mercy of god listen friends even if your heart has been turned and opened as we were saying on sunday that's the mercy of god it's the mercy of god as young people to be able to hear the word of god in this hour it's god's mercy for god to speak to our lives think of it it's not in a big some big society or somewhere but it's right here right among us god just simply just passing right here among us god's simply working and you know what it's not even by the culture it's not even by the cultural thinking of mind see that's why that where our approach listen friends our approach to this message is not of a of a mind or a thinking it's god it's god revealing himself we don't want to become educated we're to be born of the spirit of god and be sensitive to his leading to be mindful when he's speaking to be yielded to him and say oh god speak to me lord lord come by my way lord and to realize the world and the way that this though we've been born of the spirit of god this guy has got to be brought subject to the word i said moments ago and i told you it's closing too this guy doesn't like to be made to look dumb or be made to look like he doesn't know an answer is that right but sometimes that's god's program and god's way to see are you able to humble yourself even in the midst of a situation are you able to look at it you could take you could take you could take a position we've all been there you could take a position on something and really you're waiting for that breath as soon as they take that breath even if it's not a comma you're going to put a common their sentence form and jump in you know it's like waiting on the mirror go around and you're waiting for him because you're going to lay it in what is that well if you've been born of the spirit of god it certainly isn't charity but it's that flesh part this is why depending on our makeup depending on background this is why we not only need to live in the spirit we need to walk in the spirit let's pray heavenly father lord jesus as we just bow our heads and our hearts lord in your presence lord we realize that lord as we would look into this tonight we're it's not something lord that would be new that's not what we would want to do anyhow lord but father to look as you would speak to us lord upon the character and that character of life that we've received lord to realize lord jesus these are things lord that your god all through this assembly the lord that we battle we can battle with lord and it's not always something maybe that's that's known maybe that we recognize right away but lord we need you our confidence lord even as we sit down we're listening to the word of god reading we're praying lord we're looking to you because

welcome mat if you've been invited the prophet would say it like this the first door on the right is the door called pride lord jesus may there not be one here tonight lord that would keep that door
