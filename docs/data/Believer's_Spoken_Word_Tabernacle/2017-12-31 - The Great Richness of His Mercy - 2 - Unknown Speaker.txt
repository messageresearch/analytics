[Music] when the get ready [Music] [Music] yeah [Music] then [Music] [Music] [Music] what a promise what a promise they managed to think that by God's grace I believe I'm one of them that in this age in this hour where that promise has been has been unfolded and has been spoken of even all the way from the Old Testament all the shadows and types that are within there but then to see it spoken in this hour Paul ministered that but yet within it God by His grace how that we would be able would be partakers of witnessing this promise coming to pass and yet if Paul and all of those before had not ran faithful to what God had revealed to them we would not be ruined so with so they without us cannot be made perfect but you know what what what good does the heads don't do if there's no pyramid to set on a mint so it all works together for the edifying is God who's been moving down through time don't you loving this morning it's just so so good to be in the house of the Lord and I know there's so many different needs and we see different ones of you I know that we're back different ones that are meant to say that brother Dominic sister Julia back with us on Thursday they were going last weekend and we missed y'all and see different ones and we got sickness that goes around right now and you know my wife was out two weeks ago and and then you know thought that she was just defeating that thing and then even Zachary and and so they were pretty bad off and in the week here and so we just thank God though that for his touch you know sometimes we we go through those things and how she takes it a whole lot better than I did I mean I'd rather be the fellow that that just gets it Lord just if you're gonna if she had just give it to me if she just makes that house run she just makes it run this makes everything just go just right you know there's nobody can make a sandwich like my wife I can take the same ingredients and put them on bread brother Carlos they don't taste a thing so that's why I asked her say honey would you mind making me a turkey sandwich it they so good I think it's maybe just her touch a little bit of love goes in it you know something but I just heard you miss her this morning and want to say that just to mention to you remember the upcoming services we have here with brother George Smith on January 11th that's a Thursday evening and then on the Friday evening the 12th at 7 o'clock and there's just some things that I really just would have on my heart I really want brother George to be just share not only things that are taking place currently but I really want him to also share that insight that that God allowed him to have he has a real a real good angle into that on in brother Rams life and I want him to be able to share that and just seeing how things will will will go out let me just I'll stay in contact with you about it but if there are things that questions so forth that cuz I wafer there's any questions I'd like to get those to brother George beforehand and that's kind of the direction I have for that Friday night service because I usually sometimes I've been in situations where in different places sometimes overseas and things like getting they do have questions and answers and sometimes you get things I've been in youth meetings and and then things always make me nervous questions and answered I'd rather preach any day written questions and answers' you there were a lot of questions and answers I don't I don't like questions and answers so much on the spot because I like to be very thorough and an answer I try to be as great as much as I can but I want to I want if the Lord will help us be able to maybe do that on that Friday but I you know sometimes you can get into real some real things or people popping up and asking questions they would like to try to if we can get anything ahead of time you know with that we'll just kind of see I'm gonna I'm gonna talk with brother George here a little bit more as we as we're approaching that also prayer meeting this coming this coming Tuesday here at 6:30 p.m. and I'll tell you what the Lord I know I know not everyone is able to be here and say especially you know those of that that are are driving a distance but I certainly appreciate everybody joining together in that time in prayer and you know maybe sometimes there's things that comes up at 6:30 or something even for those of you that are away but even if on your heart you can just you know have some time that day or that time to make it a real special time just for different needs I'll tell you right now the Lord has has been answering prayer and it's not just just as a recent but we just see things how that God even in these these times that would come together we've had testimonies that come right just the very next service right after that others we're still praying and we're still believing and still trusting the Lord but it's a wonderful opportunity to be able to to come together and just approach and these take these needs before the throne of God and I'm so glad that God has given us that opportunity so those of you that may not be able to be here from a distance but you're here you're joining with us in prayer and in heart and we just our work because we're together and we're just we see God moving and just just a wonderful thing I also remember as their prayer request was given about those who be traveling different young people and as they're traveling in from that the winter youth retreat no doubt going so many different directions and also talked to his brother Dave earlier this morning and by the Dave kress and he had asked you know just to greet you all and to thank you or your your prayers and your love and your support sister crest she's he's week right now and they're trying to get the infection under control in her lungs you remember a week ago on well is right before a week ago last Friday when she went in to when her hip had come out again think it was a fifth time that her hip has come out and so Lord willing what they're wanting to do is put in that that permanent ball in there or the socket and that's something that it just be fused in there there was that who that that is something that they are planning on doing but before they can do that they need to get the infection cleared out of her lungs because when she was under that anesthesia last Friday even though they had waited the period of time you know for that to be cleared out of her system food and stuff like that there was some aspiration so that's what she's dealing with she's brother crest told me this morning's that she's really weak and not able to stand up on her own and walk on her own right now and and you know many of you went through a lot of afflictions yourself and just affliction itself just the ordeal let alone from all of that taking place it's enough to wipe you out you know but you had everything else on top of it and so we just lost joining with them and prayer that we just want to continue that as well also yesterday I had received a text earlier in the evening from brother Chuck Collins and I don't know where it stands now I brother Chuck just text me and had let me know yesterday that far as was sister Elizabeth whom we have been praying for and and we continue to hold on before the throne of God in prayer that they you know yesterday she was in and out of consciousness and her liver and had shut down an hour before he text me her heart rate was up and so they're just they at that point in time they were you know as it has been all along only a miracle from God we keep her here and you know I you know would think about it and just you know it laid so heavy on my heart throughout yesterday and it's been then even last night you know and just thinking of it your is a you know as they have a four-year-old and also brother Joshua and her husband Joshua Collins and just them just wonderful believers in the Lord and God knows God knows and we I tell you what we're always we're always in the will of God when we're praying for life and for healing because I it doesn't matter how bleak the circumstances I know these things when mention that even when I got the text from brother Chuck you could take a gasp because it oh but there's nothing beyond the Lord remember remember what he made himself remember how he made himself known to Martha in that time he said I am the resurrection of life she was looking for well he will raise us up that he's letting her know that I am I am the resurrection and life right now and I believe that God has made that very clear in this generation and God has made that clear to us personally and so we we have that we have that experience in our hearts and so we can we can pray with that an inner end with that family I know there's many other other requests and sickness and things like that and I've asked even the song leaders if they wouldn't have you shaking hands I hope you are okay with that brother sending you out I have faith I do but I also have wisdom I mean unless we're gonna hand out plastic gloves I know how some of y'all do you put gloves on before you shake people's hands I'm gonna call nobody's name on but that's fine I mean in this age this time that we're living in you know what it's like this why do you think when you go to Sam's Club or Walmart everybody has it now you grab a shopping cart what it but we just used to grab shopping carts now before you go in they got this big old canister of wipes right everybody's antibacterial but I believe with all my heart we do need to take precautions and I believe it was always you know hey ever I love you all being able to shake hands with one another you greet one another out there and you know it's like hey if you want to air five somebody you know or air shake or this bumper you know or however you want to do it but I you know I just I think within here we we want also to be to be careful so I hope you understand that well I think that's it unless I'm forgetting something here which that's very possible let's turn to the Bible here and and I didn't put this on the overhead but I want go to Psalms chapter 63 if we got it Psalms chapter 63 the only thing about making announcements and talking to y'all before and I feel like that gets counted against me Psalm 63 verse 1 you love the Lord O God thou art my god early will I seek thee my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh longeth worthy in a dry and thirsty land where no water is to see that power and thy glory so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary because thy loving-kindness is better than life I love that thy loving-kindness is better than life because thy loving-kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee thus will I bless thee while I live I will lift up my hand in thy name my soul shall be satisfied as with Morrow and fatness and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lip when I remember the upon my bed and meditate on the in the night watches because thou has been my health therefore in the shadow of that Wings will I rejoice my soul followeth hard after thee thy right hand upholds me but those that seek my soul to destroy it shall go into the lower parts of the earth they shall fall by the sword they shall be a portion for foxes but the King shall rejoice in God every one that sweareth by him shall glory but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped let's just bar here's a word of Prayer or Jesus we we just want to say we love you more we Lord our hearts echo this the words of this song Lord father a very familiar portion and scripture here Lord that it's very dear to our heart as all the word is but we have found this in our own lives that because I loving-kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee and thus will I bless thee I will lift up my hands and I may know God for you are worthy Lord father you see Lord God every heart every light you see those that are not able to be here Lord father for some reason there's some a circumstance there god I pray that you'll minister not only to those that are seen but also to the unseen as well I pray that God that you'll just minister to so many of these needs Lord that we have brought before you Lord and before the people and I know that God that as a people we have been praying Lord and father were just looking to you that you would move Lord father God by your presence lord for sister crest Lord God just brooding upon her body that situation that's there Lord that's nothing for you Lord Oh God you are the Lord as you set the atmospheres at the beginning Lord you parted the waters Lord father we we just believe that dear God and as they're giving her all the different antibiotics but Lord we know that medicine know it only aids in the healing Lord father healing lays in the body so we're just we're asking God that the Holy Spirit just moving Lord and given an order as it would Lord in the body that God there would just March Lord God and that Lord sickness that affliction would be cast out of our sister's body Lord I pray father and God we lift up sister Elizabeth Collins in prayer Lord I don't know Lord right now at this moment but Lord you do father and Lord we we stand even as Martha did as even now Lord God whatsoever thou ask the Lord it shall be done we believe that Lord and father we want to just say that we thank you that Lord in our hearts Lord there resides that belief Oh God Lord that when nothing can be explained when all medical science has done all that it can do and looking at all of its instruments but yet Lord we have a promise that is given to us as the children of God that by your stripes we are healed Lord and father we thank you for your mercy Lord we just ask that Lord that you'll help us now this morning Lord help me to get out of the way Lord that you could say what needs to be said Lord you you know father the needs of every one of your children that are here and we just ask that you'll take control in this service and receive glory Lord and draw Lord every one of our hearts Lord to you in a deeper way Lord and if there's one that does not know you Lord may they be drawn to you Lord so fully in surrender we pray Lord we just give ourselves to you now in the name of Jesus Christ amen god bless you being seated amen I want to just refer back into that portion of scripture out of Ephesians 2 where we have been have been looking on the great mercy of God brother Branham he says it like this and the God who is rich in mercy I read this to you last week but I want to go back into this a little bit this morning the Lord will help us he said you once in times past were dead you were dead even many here tonight one time can look back and know that you were dead but now why aren't you dead tonight as you were then you deserve to be that way because you was a sinner but God who is rich in mercy that's the thing God who was rich all these things that were but God that made the change right there God who is rich in mercy not wants you to catch this right here that made the change right there God who is rich in mercy and he said I'm so glad for that that he being rich in mercy if he was just rich in money if he was just rich in materials which he is but yet the greatest thing is being rich in mercy all what a great word that is how that we were once dead you think about it when you look over that and in Ephesians 2 and I don't believe we can ever look at it and read it enough and it just continues as a great love story and redemption and to recognize that the conditions that we were in when you you think of it that even right here is we're sitting here this morning that if it was not for the mercies of God we wouldn't be here it's the mercy of God because when we look at the scriptures and in Ephesians 2 and knowing that the conditions that truly that we were in we were dead in sin and trespasses and that is even if in our lives there was nothing that maybe that you could search out and say well I never did and I never did that and I never did that but yet every one of us were born in sin and shaped in iniquity and come to the world speaking lives every one of us needed someone we needed deliverance from that first birth because staying under that first birth that is a condemnation but yet God made a way that we could be delivered and be brought into that new birth and so when we look at this this condition that we were we were in and it was truly a situation that as we read here just moments ago when it would come down to what is deserved we deserved hell if it was God's justice and judgment that was being poured out upon us we wouldn't be here this morning but there was one who was able to take the justice and the judgment of God and that was God himself coming down and becoming one of us creating a tabernacle that he might himself pay the price that was needed and we know that God poured out his wrath upon that body there there within that God made you and I pay for our sins and to think of it that with within this here of how that God's mercy that you and I might receive of this mercy and what I want you to to look at here this morning as we go into it that God indeed is rich in mercy and God had mercy for us but as we looked in that in that quote that we were looking at that mercy itself God being rich in mercy there came a change to our life to where that mercy is not just something that we talk about but we have received a direct witness and experience of the very mercy of Almighty God so when we think of this here I want to go back into the scriptures here just for just for a moment into some places where we were because when we look at this on the richness of God's mercy we find that they enriched us there's so many that very word itself there's so many plentiful in in quantities and and so many different avenues and aspects and we we want to just look at that here for a moment because I I want to just bring us and review just a moment before I move on this morning in Exodus 33 17 here is where that the that God is speaking to Moses and Moses has made a request that he would see his faith see his glory and God speaks to Moses and verse 17 of Exodus 33 and he says I'll do this which thou has spoken for thou has found grace in my side and I know thee by name and he said I beseech thee show me thy glory and he said I will make all my goodness pass before thee and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before the now remember when we're looking at this here within the scriptures we we looked at this last week that here when we think of the mercy of God there's many many words that that the riders will try to use to convey to convey the different realities and quality of God's mercy because within it they they will write of God's in one in one sense of it they'll write of God's goodness you'll read the word goodness in the scripture you'll link of the word that we just read in Psalm 63 thy loving-kindness which is the same word as goodness it's the same word as mercy that God uses there in that that goodness that faithfulness that's steadfastness and when we we look at that we know that when as we see that that it's not just faithfulness and goodness and steadfastness alone that's the best that the riders themselves can do but as I was sharing with you last week when the the Hebrew writers the rabbis and different ones will take this word this word has said which is the word that would be used in that of mercy and they would convey that word that that that to actually speak of all or the depths of it that it's not just something of faithfulness and steadfastness but there is that steadfast love of God because if you take love out of it then you've written then you don't have the mercy of God but God's mercy is a steadfastness of love and so notice in here in verse 19 as it goes on and it says and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy so I want you to look at this that God has mercy but God's intention and desire is that that mercy would be shown and not just something that's out there but that it would be shown to those in whom God has intended to make this mercy known to so he says this this word mercy here it's a different word but look what it means it's the love love deeply have mercy be compassionate have tender affection and and to be shown compassion so we we see within this this word here that there is a depths of God's mercy and you look at it even in the depths of God's love and we look at this just in this life you can love you know you love other children just like I can love I can love your children but my children there's a different love that I have from my children then I have for your children and it's not because I'm a bad person it's just simply that I love mine there's a deeper depth of where mine is because they are my children they are from me and that's the same thing with God's love with God's mercy I tell you what the world here as we know it in this and this time people they are benefiting from God's mercy here upon this earth they may not come to know the riches and depths of his mercy like you and I by His grace have come to know but remember a lot himself he in what he received lot himself said thou has magnified thy mercy unto me in that thou hast saved me is that right but we know that within all of that as we see that there is a coming out and there's a going in when lot will save lot didn't he didn't ask and say hey can I go over where for him zat but rather lot said there's a place over here I want to go over there can I go over there and he said escape hither go quickly so the lot himself he was saved but rot was not redeemed there's a different depth of mercy in Exodus 34 here is Moses receiving God honoring this request and the Bible says the Lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there and proclaimed the name of the Lord now here he is proclaiming this name remember Jesus said I've manifested that name verse 6 and the Lord passed by before him and proclaimed the Lord the Lord God merciful and gracious long-suffering and abundant in goodness there's that word goodness again and that word above their merciful deals with one who has compassion look at this in verse 7 keeping mercy for thousands I believe that that is I'm identified their mercy that has been reserved for thousands that is innumerable an order a truth that their God has kept mercy aren't you glad look at this now forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin and that lie will by no means clear the guilty visiting the iniquity of the father's upon the children and upon the children's children under the third and to the fourth generation so hear it within this same verse of scripture we find that in these these verses here that God revealing his name his name as he is revealing it is is the attributes it's the very life so when God here manifested in Christ the Lord Jesus could say in John 17 I have manifested thy name unto those whom thou gavest unto me is that right so the manifestation of that name is here God's word that word being made flesh that word coming to pass that's God's name being made manifest every time God has made manifest of a promise God has revealed remember an attribute a characteristic of who he is even when Moses was there before God in the burning bush what did he say he said who shall I tell them has sent me they're gonna want to know your name so God reveals not just a word to him but God what God reveals to him God is there present to vindicate that that he is the I am so Moses was not just ministering a message of the I am but the I am was ministering the message of I am through Moses and he was there to vindicate the word that had been revealed I tell you right now we don't just need revelation we need vindication the promise as the Prophet stood over and over in the opening of the seals and you find him continuing to move through this again and again he said is that it's not only promised to be open to us by divine revelation but also with vindication and this is where he brings it in he keeps working with this feast the trumpet he brings it on over in the future home and he deals with a life that is sealed away with God and he said what that life is that evidence that life of the Holy Spirit is not only what has been revealed but there has been there is a vindication and that vindication is his life personally within you and I you see I want to just say it like this that there are things that when the word is presented you and I can look at this as we remain we alluded to this a little bit on Thursday night that through the minister the word there's things that where God can bring things together for you and I and we can look at it and say that's exactly the truth well I see that by bringing all that together but yet remember what our desire is is not just seeing it like that but Lord let live in me because this the the word not only the message that God has sent in this hour for you and I but all the way down through time God never intended that the word wouldn't would become merely just a Bible study or that it would become just a knowledge but God desires to perform his word through our life to where that he is our life I want you understand a book can't be my life a tape can't be your life listen this Bible can't be my life but the only thing that God has said can point me to that life and to that relationship and will foster that and encourage that but there must be that life of the word Himself living inside of me and then this word and everything that God has given it is for the edifying of that wall in that relationship outside of that that's just our our mirror of scent or knowledge of thing we don't want because knowledge can never hold anybody I'll tell you right now when I was growing up and bound in sin and out there in the world I tell you what I could argue with somebody blue in the face about serpent seed I could do that I could you know there's something about it that I just I knew that this message was a true but I didn't have the power there wasn't a relationship and knew it was true sure yeah I mean I can't I couldn't go through things been like I I came now but but even within that this is a life this is he is my life it's not something that it's just Thursday and it's Sunday and he's my life it's every day it's it's all it's all but I long for it's all but I want to do I just want to please him I don't want to miss anything it's an opportunity it's it's him and that's where the Prophet would even warn even in the message come follow me that he preaches to the graduates and he says we don't want this message he said our message it can become just theology what a warning this message it's not of all the doctrines friends that's not what it's about the life itself the life that's what it's about it's alive and the life itself will take us and correctly place us in the doctors because the doctrines are not the life the doctrines are the bark on the tree you can stand in those doctrines and those doctrines as after the life has come in and you're standing right there as he has taught you lord have mercy I don't know where that came from but keeping mercy keeping mercy he's kept mercy before you and I ever surrendered whether a young person whether you old he has reserved and kempt mercy I want you to think of this the same way that God has reserved and kept mercy for you and I waiting for us to come to the realization I need you Lord that's the same reserve that God asks of us even in Philippians chapter 2 when he would say up fill up with bowels of Mercy then we would have a reserve and and be so filled with God's mercy and and ready to ready to display that I want to say this and in this in this regard you see in the scripture here because in the hour in which we are living in which were not worth as far as time yes it's a different hour but as far as the way that spirits have worked all the way down to Scripture speaks of the mystery of iniquity was already working back there Paul himself Jude remembered Jude there he he spoke of how that there were men who were taking the grace of God and turning it into lasciviousness God didn't do that men were doing that is that right so there's a truth to God's grace just as there's a truth to God's mercy because within this in the name of Jesus Christ here is revealed the very mercy of God so through the ministering of the name because remember the Lord Jesus himself as he moved upon David in the Psalms I believe at Psalms 44 Paul picks it up in Hebrews 2 and he identifies the position where he were Christ would be walking in the midst of the Church of the Living God saying I will declare thy name unto my brethren Amen unto my relation unto my kinfolk under that of letter of that same nature so here here God's desire in proclaiming that name it's a life it's we understand it's not just a name that's given and saying on the name of Jesus Christ a Christian but there's a life that's attached to it when that name is mentioned because name would name the very word name we know in the Hebrews is Shem is character but when you mention that the word name itself in the Greek it speaks of what is it what reputation what honor comes to mind what is it that comes to mind at the mentioning of the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they meant so this is where it requires Claude to reveal his name to that generation because it's God revealing his name to be the same notice he's the same yesterday today and forever who is Jesus Christ it requires that because through that name being revealed comes the very depths of God's mercy to the people of God of whom in his reserve and yet in that age there is also that where God will also hold those guilty who spurn his mercy so so we find something that the mercy of God is not something that that it would just let down or compromise the mercy of God is not how that many would try to make it as though that you know God's mercy just you know you you can never live an overcoming life and God understands you know he remember Psalm 78 he knows that we are but flesh that is true but in that God knows know what I'm saying is that we are but flesh it's not true that we can live in overcoming life let me be very clear about that we can live in overcoming life amen it's about his name and that life be revealed to us it's just like I told the young people here just last month and we're looking I said you look at songs that are being sung I said and be careful with the songs that are being sung and you're looking at because sometimes these songs are being sung in a manner of perpetual failure they hold within them no victory are you with me it's constantly like there's no victory there's no strength there's no power that's not true the name of the Lord has been revealed to us that he is all-powerful he is the mighty God he is a deliverer he is within our strength he's a conqueror he is everything he's not been diluted the atonement hasn't weakened but as a matter of fact it's a gathering of all things together in this hour it's greater than it's ever been since the day that Christ himself walked here in flesh in that hour has the son of man is that right and here we are living in this hour after the church ages of the the Son of God and here we are in the closing out of that seven churches where God promised to visit the Gentile church again in the revealing of the Son of Man and I'm telling you right now that is a sign of a coming and a transition where Christ Himself living in the flesh of his people what an hour we're living in what a time we're living in we're living in a time where it is a time that requires decisions it requires you and I to be adamant he requires us to be focused within this hour oh my so there is this mercy that is within here coming back to this here it it is something that when we look at it when the Hebrew riders as I looked and just studying over that of the word has said and looking at it and just looking at where that their their thought line and where they were moving with these things and and it finds you know let me just kind of read I don't have any up there but let me just kind of read from a little bit you know the question had had was put forth in one of the writings that right there at the turn of the century which comes first mercy or justice and you know one of the one of the the commentators there of the the rabbi's said God gave presidents presidents means importance to the rule of mercy and joined it with the rule of justice and this is important because he says you know how much when we look at the scriptures we read God's loving-kindness God's goodness and that sometimes it loses it loses the connection with the righteousness of God because his mercy is kept it is reserved but in no way is God in his word is it written where that it would have sentimental values I want you to see understand that it's not sentimental values that where God's compassion is simply looking on you and I and saying they'll never be able to do it they'll never be able to live it they'll never destined it that right there that is excuses and it would and it speaks to God's own weakness if that's what this would imply but God desires righteousness righteousness is that in that condition that that point in that place and that state of which man is accepted before God there's only one way that you and I can be accepted before God and that's to be in Christ and in Christ is not being a part of a church in Christ is to be born of the Holy Ghost to be dwelling in the body of the word that is a living being Christ is that all right but in order for you and me to get there we need not just that mercy kept but the mercy must be revealed it must be revealed if there is mercy that's for me I need it needs to be revealed to me so here in no way you know the writer will say you know what's in it here it says you know when we look at how that his passion for righteousness is so strong that he could not be more insistent in his demand for but God's persistent love for his people is more insistent still I want you think of this for a moment hear God's desire for this righteousness think about down through time and how that God allowed the humanity to be displayed even of his prophets and of his people God allowed that to be but yet God did not stop God didn't say okay no tried man his love was insistent but his love did not cause him to compromise you see love moves him there's an object there's a goal there's a vision and love is moving there at a friend's there's things that you and I can look at within families within marriages or than everything else Church and whatever more and you can look at things even on your job you can look at things sometimes and you can become so frustrated by just what you're seeing it seems like this isn't going or this isn't happening things aren't falling right in line but remember here love itself must be the driving force with love being the driving force doesn't mean you do away with the requirements it means that love is there to to Minister what's needed in order to bring forth what's being called for it must be present there in love the we we know we can go in the scriptures with this in first Corinthians 13 love is patient love is kind tell me Holly let's have you and a pram family service I told you last night this is a family book we're his family but this is this this love this requires out of our life look just even right here within an assembly it requires love to wear that we're able to you know be when I say tolerant of things and of one another and make allowances I'm not talking about allowances for sin but to wear that within the midst of it to wear that there is a desire to see lives and others help not not not in a way uh to wear it just like a judge doubt but where that God's love is there to minister to that life if a person doesn't want to receive that that's on there a court are you with me that that's that's on their record you know as I said last week God God you know God will continue to deal with hearts continue to deal with lives but God is not going to continue to pour and continue to pour and continue to pour continue to pour remember God is here getting you and I together and ready for rapture so think of this know the sentiment is not operating out of sentimental notice this in the scripture how that it would speak of the great mercy of God let me just jump into this quote here and the message here to him brother Ram in 1958 he said I don't want justice I don't want judgment I want mercy God give me mercy not his law not his denominations not his bishops I want his love and His mercy now this is it let me just let me let me just speak on this a little bit this isn't brother branham in some way speaking as though that well I'm just unable to live right I'm not that's not what he's talking about he's speaking of I need his mercy I am a recipient of God's mercy but I need his mercies as David would say over and over his tender mercies which is that compassion where as David could say he crowded my life with tender mercies you are a work of the master and that word when God revealed the Lord God the Lord God merciful that word merciful in Exodus 34 is compassionate one with a possible exception Wow one with a possible exception you and I need that it isn't because well we're listen wewe need that listen God is molding us he is shaping us he is chastening us he's moving upon our lives we need the very mercy of Almighty God because just simply put sometimes we think we've got it and all of a sudden when we go as I said you know last week you go to shoot at the barn you come out of a service got it all lined up and instead of hitting your barn you hit another barn what we need we need merciful one who's there who new doesn't just say that's okay you can hit other people's barns that's all right no we need one with tender mercies to be able to direct us and where we can come right in line with that and show us so that what our desire is that he has stirred up that that desire can be fully come to pass in our life it requires his tender mercies that's why David could say continue that tender mercies continue he would say i loving-kindness we need that and I say that because just with just receiving the Holy Ghost it isn't that we don't need God's mercy anymore our soul has already pass under the judgment of Almighty God and we have received God's mercy when we have been born of the Holy Ghost we have received that depth of God's mercy but we need his continual mercies in the working of our lives we need His mercies and our families His mercies in our homes we need His mercies so here brother bream says that's what the world is hungry for sometimes I pay close attention out and the Lord will just have me hone in on certain words this is what the world is hunger in for I just begin to look at that word hungry you know there's a lot of things you can fill up on and it don't quench hunger is where there's a there's a craving there's a need and here the world itself satisfying with all sorts of things there's all kinds there's so much more now for people to have and have access to so much more but yet so much greater the hunger this is a fulfillment the famine in these days so it's greater but yet notice within it his love and His mercy God's mercy upon us I couldn't stand his law I can't keep his law and he knows I don't want his justice he would condemn me but I'll accept his mercy what will his mercy do change me his mercy will change my nature to where it's not just something that God is forgiving forgiving but God is able to look down and say I know you didn't mean to do it why cuz he knows your nature your nature and his nature is compatible by then what can Jesus do for you he can save you he can heal you he can give you his salvation he can take you to glory he can cover your sins he can make you love one another aren't you glad for that now to think of this here in in the Old Testament there would be where there is a time and God laid these things down in tight to where that there would be a time each each year where there would be blood that would be placed upon the mercy seat there would be a cleansing of the sanctuary each year and we know that that that atoning blood we know that it was done once a year and we know that that speaks of his Paul would tell us by the Spirit of God that once and for all once and for all he suffered he don't have to come back and suffer again he suffered once and for all he paid the price already you and I coming to him are only coming to the realization the acceptance of what he has already done for you and I he commended his love for us that while we were yet sinners he died for us it would know him you know it would be no sense for me to tell you you could be free if there was nothing there that could say you could go free but I'm only a spokesman by sent by God to say you're free and it requires faith to raise up and say I accept that I received that I received that declaration I'm free I want to walk right into that what will God have for me so this mercy seat remember the mercy seat and the cherubims were of all one beaten work we find those cherubims moving on in Ezekiel we find those cherubims moving on over there clearing the Book of Revelations John sees those terrible's we see those chair was to be the anointings and we've seen all that of where that is set up around the tabernacle in a type all of these things were speaking of God's presence God's presence is directly united with his mercy Amen it's his presence which is his word there the mercy seat is where that God told Moses I'll meet you there I'll commune with you there it's there in that secret place where God wouldn't would would would meet and personally communion and that's where he meets you and I you and I could not go in there but through the blood of Jesus Christ there has been made away through the veil of his flesh because he died and paid the price that that way might be opened up to you and I that you and I are not just staying out here in rituals underneath the lights of well today at sunny tomorrow it's dark today it's sunny tomorrow star we don't even have to come into the place of it stop there of where it's lights now artificial lights lighting of candles but the wind can blow my oh my feel shade hold my praise o'clock glory to God I feel safe and then the max wind comes along blows it out I don't feel saved anymore I don't feel praise God there is a deeper wall that goes beyond our feelings and that is they walk inside the veil of Almighty God to where you and I can meet God face to face and whether I feel or whether I don't feel there's an anchor that holds hallelujah so we don't want we don't want the Justice of God we couldn't stand God's justice but his mercy is what we want amen we want his we want his mercy and when we think of that as long I want to read this statement here sister it's about the third paragraph down below 66 there in Revelation chapter 5 but I want to read this to you here brother banner says there was a time of the cleansing of the sanctuary when it was a judgement seat as long as the blood was off the seat so when the cleansing came there wasn't many blood on that seat there was judgment the same seat that was a seat of mercy had become a judgement seat just that quick the time changed it changed but mercy held until that moment once you think of this we're now approaching that time now we are now approaching in this age of cleansing of the sanctuary and the judgments coming upon the earth as long as blood is there God cannot destroy the earth longest blood is there nobody's a sinner before God everybody's right because there's an atonement for everybody so what's God looking at the blood covering the earth for God so loved the world you can finish it then He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life a blue covering so the blood covers for all so everybody listen to me now everybody as the properties say nobody's the center before God but when that blood is lifted when that blood is lifted what is going to matter is whether you have accepted or been accepted in his perpetuation to wear when that blood when that blood is pulled away you are taken with it amen we're not talking about literal blood we're talking about his life here he meant that life that was within that blood cell his life right here upon this earth they tried to extinguish this life they tried to boil the life out they tried to do everything but they could not get that life separated because Claude had an intended purpose that this word that life was going to remain upon this earth until every one of his children were brought back home the only thing Satan was given permission to do this to do that but the only thing you could do is bring a furtherance to the gospel you with me it's trying to like trying to kill something then it multiplies it's like they like they hate tell me you know and out things I've read about with the Coyotes and things like yet they say you get after hunting the Coyotes that you know you can hunt them any time of the day they say you say start feeling pressure they start multiplying x feel pressure we're not coyotes then I think about the Prophet Telesis and we looked there in the satire and age of such a dark age such a gloomy time such a time when everything was against the Church of the Living God and I love how the Prophet with that eyes able to pick that out he said in the midst of this time right here the Church of God prospered and grew even more hallelujah you can't you can't stop the life it's not else like that little that little spring that the Prophet was talking to him not me is something behind me hey minutes alive that's behind me as long as that blood is there everybody that means with all of our heart our desire our desire is God let this word go to reach every heart every life Lord to give me that opportunity Lord let me take those opportunities to witness you know the greatest witness that you and I can have as your life you can tell somebody about this message but if you ain't faithful about it they wonder and look at you and say it must not be that good oh you know brother Sam no no you don't gotta explain the side effects list you take it it has side effects but these side effects have been the same side effects they've been affecting the believers the same way all the way down through time glory be to God it showed in our lives so look he says if you fail to accept that atonement and go into his presence then you are a sinner you're beyond that mercy you've judged yourself so she failed to receive it you judge yourself so you have the opportunity to receive it sometimes you know even with listen young ones at home with it you know when I get older this is not about when you get older this isn't like about going out and picking out a burial plot well you know what I'm gonna go ahead and pick out my burial plot and I'm gonna go ahead and get this wheel made out and all this other things no this is about getting ready to live it's about being ready to live for him to give your life to Him a service unto Him it's the greatest privilege and I just told the boys our last night who's there with him and I said you know I said the only regret I have a set of 19 years old and God got ahold my life I said there's a lot of regrets I had I wish there an even way to tell was nineteen years old probably some of you have different ages and whatever more you'd say but what we're looking at is that he's everything but while there's mercy when the cleansing of the sanctuary comes the blood goes off the mercy seat in the wrath of God falls upon the earth God be merciful to us that we be not in that day fountains with that mercies of God the rich young ruler he came face-to-face with the Lord Jesus Christ just like you sitting right here this morning we're right here face to face with his presence he had lived a good life but yet when he walked away he continued to increase see you can go out of here and you might have went out of here before and you think a pretty good week and pretty good day man sterling getting from underneath that ministering like that and that preaching man will happen what it is is conviction let's come home oh if I can just make it out another day I can just do this if I can just do that and you already look and look in the head to this right here but it's it's to respond to that because when that young that rich young ruler when he was there in hell he could look over and see Lazarus in the bosom of Abraham that was the promise of resurrection and what did he say sin Lazarus over didn't dev him dip his finger he didn't even ask for a glass you run like some of you know you know and you say I'm not gonna have another glass of water for go to bed I'm thirsty he just asked for a drop he thought man I'll get a drop there wasn't nothing for him he had despised and rejected God's mercy to him there's a lot of things let me tell you something right now there's a lot of thing I'm just going to I'm just with him there's a lot of things that can occupy your attention as young people in this hour there are so many things that can occupy your time and let me tell you what it is it's things that Satan has laid out as bait he knows that if he can fill your mind with other things and getting you meditating and thinking and dwelling on other things you've got something that you can direct your mind away from the conviction of the Holy Ghost that you sense that's a saintly and a service with anyone who's older if he can direct your mind away to something that's either coming after service or this or that he'll try to do that but remember is to respond to that conviction of the Holy Spirit that deals with your heart in your life right now very important and Satan is a chief anesthesiologist he knows how to numb you you can hear so much and allow to wear that conviction and in the ministry of the word listen friends it's not it's not the the way that the word itself as far as maybe it's spoken maybe my voice is louder than what somebody could stand here and their voice is much something that has nothing to do with it that's just me as a person but all right I can't I that's just me as a person and let me tell you something I'm no different outside than what I am here in the pulpit now I don't run around the house saying hey I want a grilled cheese but what I'm saying isn't that for me there's a passion about I'm not saying that the other person is not passion that's just how God made me and when he set the knobs he stripped the knobs huh that's a I don't know how you're gonna adjust him but what I'm saying is is that the conviction of the holy spirit it is something that is present regardless of the vernacular or how things are actually being said whether it's with a loudness or whatever his presence his word that brings a conviction it deals with hearts and deals with lives that's him speaking in His mercy for God to even call these things out that's God's mercy hmm think of this Paul lets you and I know here that we are that wild olive branch Paul writes there in the in the Romans he reminds us the Holy Spirit as Paul reminds us we were not even included mentioned in the adoption the covenants all these things these things were pertaining to Israel is that right but what Israel and no one else could see the prophets would have little as the Spirit of God would move upon him there would be insights that would come you see if they're in the life sometimes it's not just what's spoken it's in the life in Abraham's life Abraham was a Gentile is that right he was a Gentile you see that coming in Abraham's life you see even how that the Spirit of God will move upon Isaiah and said I will provoke me to jealousy among the people has not God all this was hidden and that's why Paul could speak in Ephesians and say now even in cautions one of that hidden mystery that was there but now has been revealed it was not known that you and I were there they didn't know that with Joseph and the Gentile bride God knew it and all of this was hidden now begins to come out God's mercy Joseph had not been rejected there would have been no marriage there there would have been no Gentile bride for Joseph is that right if there had been to listen to me now if there was no Gentile bride Joseph was not that there would be no restoring and helping of Israel is that right God called Ruth and in them in the scriptures there in Ruth how that Naomi speaks Ruth and she says thou has dealt has said kindly with me so here she is dealing kindly with Naomi and saying I want to go with you right and they owe me a gives the full blanket and says well you don't have to sell right you don't have to go all of this way but what she said could not derail or remove Ruth because Ruth the Prophet tells us and the Holy Ghost series Ruth had a vision there was something that caught ahold of Ruth where Ruth could see she had no promise in that land but she said my God's gonna be your God's gonna be my God where you like that's where I'm gonna go and lodge let him say why did she she had no promise there but she goes she's drawn there and she comes there she comes in the scripture here she is she lights up on beau has his field who directs her there a spirit she comes to that field and she speaks to him vomits showed me her said kindness goodness and then after the barley harvest where that Naomi has directed her delay at his feet he said unto her thou has shown me that I shown greater has said kindness in the latter than they did in the beginning why because in the beginning she chose to come to Israel but what's greater is that she chose who was there oh it's a great thing listen to me now it's a great thing to say Lord I want to serve you Lord I want to live for you that's a great thing but it's a greater thing to receive him who calls you and is drawing to your heart to sail our beyond just knowing you beyond just knowing these truth they aren't just being in a church lord I want to know the Lord that is showing has said kindness and goodness back to him who has shown it to you is all right so this mercy is reciprocated you can only show the mercy that has been displayed and you have received all right jesus said in the Beatitudes David says it in the Psalms on to the upright now will show thyself merciful blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy the right even in the prayer think of this now even in the prayer that is mentioned in the scriptures in regarding that of perfect faith where it's speaking of in our prayer forgiveness ELISA perfect faith is not just based on our forgiveness from God it's based on you and I'm living where no one else owes us well that one did I guess we just stop there today forgiveness is where you're not holding anybody else in debt because remember in that passage of Scripture the man wanted to be free he begged he begged that the king please forgive me of my debt the King never gave me his debt then he went back to one who owed him as a you paid me so he didn't he didn't just receive forgiveness he missed what it was all about it was pardon pardon that's where Jesus could say em you pray yeah remember you have any haunt should go make that right and he says the word compassion have compassion the word mercy are you with me hey listen friends we can stand against wrong but you have to have the right attitude the Scriptures all the way through all the way through the Prophet standing right there in ministering things even when the Spirit of God remember when the Prophet was calling things Rickey's and ricotta's remember that the Spirit of God corrected him come on somebody pick it on up after that you find in continuing to say Ricky Xandra Karras what's the difference what's the difference the difference is is that it is said with the love of God but you see because think about what the Prophet said many of a just as the Prophet needed him the mercy the tender mercies of God right there you and I the gospel calls out wrong the Prophet stood right there call it out wrong that's God's mercy you said brother Simon what I would have to me I've got the Holy Ghost that's because you and I are not listen when God gave us the Holy Ghost it did not make a self-reliant no sir that's that that's contrary to the nature when God feels with the Holy Spirit that is because there has been a union and we say yes Lord you are my husband you are my lord you are my provider remember he takes the veil and puts it on his shoulder showing I have complete care and oversight for your life is that right so that's these are the things these are things where the Holy Spirit will speak to us to mention and call different things I like to that we might be directed within these things and sometimes it's hard my role tired look at this Paul he deals with this let me read here in Romans 1134 as ye in times past he saw about their wild branch that was crafted in ye in times past have not believed God yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief that's what we see with Joseph down there you see that because of their unbelief we've obtained mercy even so have these also now not believe that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy back to Ruth and Naomi Ruth receives that child and gives back to that child and they only becomes nurse right this gospel returning back to the Jews it was their and unbelief but because they had rejected it mercy has been extended to us it wasn't God saying oh no I gotta find somebody no that was all in God's plan it was hidden it was hidden there I wonder how much when they would read over Hosea and Paul picks us up and Hosea Peter picks up on Hosea said and the other places and Isaiah I wonder how many times that they ran over those things concerning that of the Gentiles and they just ran over but God spoke those things with you and I in mind Oh for God hath concluded them all in unbelief that he might have mercy upon all aren't you grateful that God g-got isn't not run around and picking people out right now it's his word that goes forward that draws you and I to him watch how what's how Paul describes this in Romans nine my let me just try it let me let me just try to get here just a little further and then then we'll close it here Romans nine what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with God god forbid what huh what a way to start this this Duren righteousness was gone where he say it to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion so then it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth but of God that showeth mercy and he goes on to speak of Pharaoh I've raised him up for this same purpose that I might show my power indeed that and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth because we've been looking out Thursday night if we can see this that God permits circumstances and things to arrive that he might declare his name when the waters were bitter there in Israel and they came to a troublesome time God revealed himself here to be not just their provider but he revealed himself in an attribute of one of the compound redemptive names of Jehovah God took those situations even when amalaka DeRose God revealed himself unto Israel is that right as to hold our banner see God revealing he's making himself known to you and I he's declaring his name oh my therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he will he hardeneth what if God willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with much long-suffering the vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy which he had afore prepared unto glory so you have not just become a vessel of mercy you always were you were prepared for that you were prepared of for to receive His mercy in this hour that mercy that God has reserved behold I will send them to you Elijah the Prophet before that great and dreadful day of the Lord lest I come and smite the earth with a curse God's promised visitation of here's mercy that he kept but that mercy must be ministered to what's needed is that steadfast love that has held God to his word to his covenant now the compassion of God moves down to go to work and show his mercy on vessels of mercy you and I listen this morning prepared as a bedding ground before the foundation of the world to receive the word that God would send in this hour well the rest of the the world can reject it and they look and say I don't want anything to do with that but for you and I it's not about a do's and don'ts it's Christ it's a life there's a lot there is something to ask that all of a sudden the darkness that was we were encapsulated now is broken from around our lives that's a mercy of God you see it doesn't mean it doesn't matter if it's just mercy being held but God just don't hold mercy just to hold it mercy is held so that from that mercy God comes to minister to bring forth what he's calling it's all left up to him even us whom he hath called not of the Jews only but also of the Gentiles Moses and Pharaoh they look through the same window and once you catch this here look look kind of a prophet will use those things they look through the same window let me say to you this morning every one of you from the youngest to the oldest there is an window that is set before you what do you see when you look through this window do you see God who is faithful to his word to fulfill his promise or do you see it as bondage or do you see it as I can never live that way how do you see it do you see yourself because remember this window a window itself can be a reflection how do you see yourself when you look into this word I'm a pretty good person I do that's not what I'm asking if you're a pretty good person and that's all that's needed then Calvary's Calvary was none needed brother Samuel that's simple but it's true the mercy of God is not God coming down with blinders on it's God coming to deal and to move upon our hearts call us to repentance yes sir call us to repentance my this is where Peter could say in first Peter chapter 2 verse 9 you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood an holy nation a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness and into his marvelous light which in times past were not a people but are not the people of God which had not obtained mercy but have now obtained mercy that obtaining was not is not speaking of what we've done it's speaking of God's great mercy that has been extended to you and hi but remember if that mercy is not accepted then the only thing that's left is judgment and I say it like this here you have sometimes we come down to you come down into situations for the brown you're you know he it makes a statement here in the latter part in 63 there in July 24th he says sometimes you could come down and you see a person that has passed away and you think that person they never had an opportunity the Rebbe said that's not true he said because every mortal he said there's a voice that deals with the heart that would cause them to think caused them to consider where are you at now see even while the words being preached there's a there's a voice Marilla said before you you you can look at it I could just get out see what is that I want you to look at this now look on the Spirit of God coming help you give give you determine on what would want to cause you to get out from this present it wouldn't be the Spirit of God who's trying to draw you but let me let me just share this with you I just I'm just sharing this serving God being born of the Spirit of God it's not about you trying to keep I can't do that I can't do that this is too hard you're looking at it through the earthly lens you're looking at it through your earthly strength you're looking at it with desires still alive in your life it's not about what you can keep the Holy Ghost is the person of Jesus Christ coming to dwell in and live his life through you not you trying to live it or I'm gonna try to do this I'm gonna try to do this I mean you're saying that we shouldn't take the word and we know that's not what I'm saying what I'm saying it's not your strength it's your strength yielded and he lives his life through you it changes you from within mine that's God's mercy that's his mercy his mercy if it was not mercy if it was justice and judgment he could leave you right in the condition you're in but his mercy sends forth his word to minister to our lives that's the mercy of God to minister to us think about this as we look at this here when we've come from here this morning in looking at the grace of God the scripture says God's goodness here in Romans chapter 2 verse 4 I love this passage of Scripture the goodness of God leadeth thee it's not the evilness of God that does what brings conviction he deals with where you are and where you should be listen now remember where we were remember remember where we were looking at last week where we left off in nehemiah chapter 9 where god was speaking there through nehemiah where he was recounting where God had brought Israel and how his pardoning grace had been there the multitude of his mercies the manifold mercies of God all of this had been there when they had fallen away thou sent two saviors to deliver them and he's talking about God's manifold mercies much mercy these very things and he says thou sent us that good spirit to instruct them what what good does it do without having his leadership his mercy provides leadership that's why James could even say that even going through the midst of a test or trial if any lack wisdom let him ask God who giveth liberally abundantly God makes himself known he makes himself clear the same God I want you think of this right here the same God as he's watched over your life what's over my life and this is even speaking to someone here this morning because I realized as my voice all throughout this congregation there can be lives that have already been sealed away and yet we still stand in good need of God's mercy there's other lives that have come to the Lord but yet have not responded to fully to his call we've come to enjoy his services and come to enjoy mind the work but have you made the step to say Lord I want to repent of my sins you don't want to just come and feed on the word and don't repent you want to receive the benefits of the word don't you you don't want to have nutrient blockers in your life you want to receive the benefits you say what is that repentance you might say Oh send my order then let me ask you the other part that's coupled with that have you've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's another part of it that's the goodness of God when there were people standing there on the day of Pentecost what must we do to be saved what happened the mercy of God came forth with leadership and instruction and said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that is God's Word okay if you're sitting here this morning and you don't have that life within you God's desire is to give it to them it's not God was holding back and was holding back his desire is to fill your life that's his mercy he watches over your life watches over my life your life my life listen no matter how young you are how old you are your life there's not a promise of the next moment how many young people you read about even throughout a a week time their life taken away sometimes you read of things you think what a freak accident what a a moment what a life was snuffed out like that it doesn't age doesn't mean anything what's important is to respond when he's calling me say this to you if he's leading and he's directing you whether it's in repentance no matter what stage it is in your life he is faithful to lead you all the way I want you to catch this he didn't say that the goodness of God pointed you Leah wanted to leave he must be present and not just one who's just standing by like a greeter at Walmart go here how you doing have a good day no he said I want to go with you be with you in you dwelling you it has been your life I want to change your life I want to clean your life up I'll tell you what he changes he changes lives yes he does he cleans lives up he called tell you I didn't know longer about you searching for a dress code it's that your desire your heart is to please him things begin to fall away things begin to move away from your life is that right the things begin to come away although you know when you look at it the makeup begins to fade away all the desire to cut the hair of those things fade away the earrings drop out of the years come on somebody you understand those things God put that in his word that those things in the Book of Jeremiah in the Book of Isaiah God considered those things to be rebellion against him whoa nada no we're going there today but we're here that's the mercy of God that's not mercy that he would lend you and I know what our desire is to reflect him that's why the scripture says let the woman be clothed in modest apparel modest apparel don't mean the latest fashion modest the word means free flowing garment oh I'm talking about the goodness of God here I'm talking about his head the mercy of God that's why in everything you have to watch where you're going you have to watch let me tell you something when you go around those clothing stores I don't care if they play all their brother Sam and they play Christian music there's demons on them racks and they're just as much demons on the men's racks as there is on the women's rats now because you got all types of people designing clothes whoo that's the truth that's why it behooves you and I to pray it changes a life listen friends I mean let me just be very clear I I know I told you I'm finishing up I really am I can't even get to where I'm getting so I won't get to where I'm getting I'll just stop to where I want the goodness of God leadeth to repentance this enough I want you understand this right here when the Spirit of God speaks out and many times hear about about being in the house of God not talking about conforming to a law of a church when it deals with things within that address and how that we conduct ourselves it is not about well I'm gonna conform to that right there there's something that in the word that I think God that when God would call our attention that we're mindful of those things but you know it's more than just saying well I'm gonna do it because you know brother Sam you brought it up I'm gonna do it listen friends these are not things that brother Samuel sets around and studies on to bring up there are things I study on and bring up I might see different needs but this is what I'm trying to tell you if all they responds to is come into the house of God that gets old but you need to say Lord is there something not right with my life is there something that I'm missing to where that entry excuse becomes preeminent over being in the house of God is there something about it in my life this is the time of reflection because you won't have that later this is a time of reflection oh my may God help us we're living in a time where God's mercy has been has been extended to you and I but his spirit will not always strive with man a part of the richness of God's mercy is how God would speak to us again there's a term that he uses here in the scriptures the word mercies nehemiah uses it David uses it and it's the word that deals with compassion and God told Israel Isaiah 46 he says look at the rest of these gods that are crafting men craft them up put them here talk to him they can't talk back to him and the God is dependent upon the man and God told him he said but I have I've carried you in the womb I have watched over you I have stretched my compassion over here and God let it be known there shall be a return of salvation to Israel not because man packing an idol because God watching over his word God has watched over your life my life to bring us into this place of where we are here this morning even when we weren't even aware of it and we're going around it's bad mercy that our life was not snuffed from us before we received his Redemption yes sir didn't matter if we were sitting in a message church we needed Redemption we needed a sovereign where my sovereign god the compounding Li claim on our soul is that Alright he's watched over your life he's kept over your life but all in the midst of this time Wow now we can look back we can look to that and say God you like Jeremiah could say David could say you knew me David could say in Psalms 139 how wondrous are thy thoughts Hal innumerable more than the sands of God for before my eye was even in the womb and my members were in your book yet being unperfect yet there I was God knew of you knew of me and he watched over your life what's true my life for what for this moment for the moment where he would bring and make himself known to you aren't you glad for that mercy your life could have been snuffed out but the mercy of God watched over your life you might say brother Samuel I never back slid back on the world but have you ever back slid on his presence have you ever a black back slid where you may not have forsaken him in coming here and being here but have you ever forsook him in your attitude oh Jesus but his mercies [Applause] hallelujah and the Book of Lamentations the Prophet said well thy Compassion's and night mercies they fail not O God they are new every morning Oh My yes we need God's mercy yes we need God's mercy and we want to be receptive of his mercy that's why this morning no matter where you're at who you are where you are in here even listening to the sound of my voice that perhaps would even stream this it's important to recognize where am I at have I accepted the full provision that God has extended in this hour if I accepted it listen God desires he listen God's desire when he leads to repentance repentance it's a breaking it's a dissolving it's an a boring of those things it's a turning from that's the grace of God you know it's God's grace to even bring you to that place to where you desire to read that that's God working on your life you said by the saying I had that I had that breaking forth before I ever entered into this church that was the mercy because to think if his mercy had not moved on you like that you coming in here and hearing the word yes oh my I don't know I don't think I can do that brother Samuel even if even with me being one of his own God prepares you to receive his mercy and he knows each and every one so I say here this morning if you haven't repented you need to repent if you have not been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you need to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ don't just do it because I'm saying it I'm giving you a command by the word this is what God's waters are as the Prophet stood there in the first seal stands there in the fifth so he says follow his word follow his command all the way that's what your desire is what you're longing for when you come and you worship and you're looking for what is it you want not just to come here and worship that Living God but you want that Living God to go with you to where your life it's not just your hands that are up but your life has been raised up amen it's with conviction where the word strikes your heart where the word leads your life where there's things within your life and say Lord I want that depth of walk you love him this morning power I wonder for someone here as every head is bowed and every eye is closed I tell you this how God is working straight at this service here I believe God is mindful as he is in every service and I ask you this morning is there any here then you look at this and you were looking God's Word and the Holy Spirit is dealt with your heart and you say Lord I need to repent move to repentance not just I see that knee not just to be acquainted with it but I want to be identified with that name you see what what woman coming up here to be married would say no no no no no I I don't I don't want you I don't want your name I'll just keep my own but that woman coming up here she's coming up here because there is a man who initiated the covenant and that man has entered the room and he initiated that covenant and she's coming to take his name to bear it's like I wonder this morning even just with an uplifted hand for those that have not moved into that place coming Lord I'm surrender anymore giving my old god bless you I wonder as the holy spirit just moving throughout the congregation maybe you raise your hand and say Lord I need a deeper experience I need an ether experience I want that life it means what it is now now that you've raised your hand we're gonna pray but remember this you've responded not to brother Samuel you responded to him and remember he's not here pointing he's here to lead you so that desire that he has stirred up within your heart he's here to lead you to where that that desire becomes a reality he's a faithful God or Jesus [Music] more as we realize in this great presents Lord the Lord God has you spoke into our hearts Lord God his hands are lifted not out of fear the father were your love in steadfast love of God is ministered to our heart father [Music] Lord Jesus you you seen those hands Lord that work were lifted Lord from from young people [Music] or Jesus you're the very personal God in the midst Lord of a service like this how that you can take a word and you can so personally speak to our lives and deal with us in an individual way and yet Lord you speak to all of us we want to say thank you Lord for your love in your care and we thank you Lord for your goodness your goodness Lord leading us to repentance we thank you Father Lord God this morning for those hearts behind the hands Lord that have went up Lord unto you it's the Lord I want a deeper experience nor do you know you know the heart

would Lord grant to their desire may Lord in faith right now Lord they forsake every doubt may they recognize that not only Laura you have come and you brought conviction you would deal with their life but Lord you lead us into that which you desire for our life your mercy has not removed the desire for righteousness but rather your mercy oversees that Lord to bring back to pass father I pray

read in the opening text you are our help Lord your right hand as a poultice father we love you a commit Lord God every life every heart Lord unto you Lord may Lord the desire of their heart Lord that their faith Lord would recognize that there is nothing that can hold them back from receiving Lord when they have openly Lord God given to you Lord were you sad Lord that he that will hide his sin

maybe they're feeling Lord just like discouraged Lord I pray that God your tender mercies will reach and minister to them David said surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life I shall dwell in the house of Lord Jesus may each and every one whose father be found in the mercies of God three the name of Jesus Christ I love you love him they love one another but you appreciate his presence this is the goodness of God his goodness if he keeps back from us if he withhold from us he's withholding his mercy if all that he tells me is all blessings all good things that's not his mercy he's withholding his mercy but God doesn't withhold his mercy not only is he tell me of the blessings he tells me of the curses not only does he uplift me he corrects me that's the mercy of God this is a this is a steadfast love this is a love that where has said moments ago where though we could strain his love has never strayed from his covenant of which he sees you his love as never straight from it his love is not a sentimental it's a reality his love is the personal truth aren't you glad he kept mercy aren't you glad that he brings conviction to our hearts oh my water or water
