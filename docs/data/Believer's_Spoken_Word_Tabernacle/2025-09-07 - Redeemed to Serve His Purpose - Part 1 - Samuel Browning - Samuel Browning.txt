Just trust the Lord that he'll take care of that. Amen. There's an unspoken prayer request here. We want the Lord to answer.

So, let's just pray that brother Bill, God would uh bless him and help him. Amen. Just give him complete healing. Testimony here. I should have read this first. Good news. Uh, Brother Dave uh Crest Jr. text me this isn't the good news that he said he wasn't going to be able to be here this morning. But the reason he's not going to be here this morning is cuz he's going to pick up his dad from rehab care. So, they said, "Amen." So, Brother Dave Chris Senior, it looks like he's coming home then. Amen. And so please continue to pray for brother Dave Crest senior. God will continue to heal his knee there. Amen. We would love to see our brother and Dave, brother Dave and sister Crest back in the house of God. Amen. How many would like to have a meeting with Jesus this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. Does he mean more to you than anything else? That's why we come here this morning. Could have slept in, could have mowed the lawn, could have done anything else, but I'd rather be here at the house of God. Amen. Let's focus on him now. Let's just shut out the things of the world and all the pleasures and all the troubles and everything in this life and let's just look to him this morning for these prayer requests and for the service. Lord Jesus, we we we bring these things before you this morning, Lord. Lord, before anything was written down, Lord God, before before anything before this world even started spinning, Lord, you knew every trouble we'd ever have, Lord. Every trial we'd go through, Lord. So nothing catches you by surprise, Lord Jesus. So, but we you asked us to to bring these things before the saints, Lord, so that we could pray. He said, "We have not because we ask not." So, here we are this morning asking, Lord Jesus, and we have faith and we trust in you, Lord, that you'll undertake for every one of these needs that we've met read, Lord Jesus. And we don't ask for our will to be done, but we ask for your will, Lord. You know every situation. You know what's best for us, Lord. Uh but but until you give us a direct revelation about every situation, Lord, we go by the general orders as our brother said, Lord. So we're praying for healing, Lord. We're praying for salvation. We're praying for those to be lifted up, Lord Jesus, in their spirit, Lord. If anyone's having any kind of financial problem, any kind of trouble, Lord Jesus, I pray that you would uh grant them reprieve, Lord Jesus, and be their guide and comfort during these times. Lord, as our pastor brings, you see, Lord, also as many that's sick this morning, Lord, I just pray that those that couldn't be here this morning, Lord, you give a special blessing to them, Lord, our pastor's been studying for the word of God, Lord, to to bring it and preach to us, Lord, and we're looking forward to it this morning. We've come hungry this morning, Lord, and we're going to pull on the gift of God, Lord Jesus, and we're going to call on your name. And we believe we'll have a meeting with you here this morning. You are welcome Lord to come and make your abode with us today Lord Jesus. Just just be amongst us Lord. May your sweet Holy Spirit, your presence be amongst every child. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Church says, &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. Amen. I got something. I got something that the world can't give. World can't take it away.

We're looking forward to the word this morning. As our pastor comes, this song's been on my heart. I've been wanting to do this one. Amen. So, this song says, "Everybody will be happy over there." Amen. But I believe we've been given a promise. We can have some of that happiness on this side. We can smile and praise the Lord a little bit. Amen. So, I pray, Amen. God will grant us that this morning. There's a happy land of promise over in the great triumph where the saved of earth shall soon show soon his glory share where the souls of men shall enter and live on forever more. Everybody will be happy over there. Oh, I said everybody will be happy. Will be happy. Over there we will shout and sing God's praise. Everybody will be happy over there.

[Applause] All my sins are forgiven. [Music] been washed by his blood. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Wash by your blood. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you thankful for that this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So thankful for the grace of God once again and thankful the Lord has given us then another beautiful day, another time that we can come together and so good to see each and every one of you and um we just want to continue to hold one another up in prayer. Amen. before the Lord that truly brother Brian mentioned it already once again and um sometimes when you think that all the sickness and thing is has passed and then you have another one but um God is gracious is faithful. Amen. And uh as I said before it's just reminders that we're here in our temporary body. This is not our inheritance. We still battle sickness. We still get down. As a matter of fact, Brother Bram says the way Satan will come at us is when he knows he can no longer get to your soul. &gt;&gt; He wants to get at that body and hit anywhere that he can. But you know one thing about it, you know, you can't even have a toothache unless he first gets permission. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; From God. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can't even have, you can't, nothing can come your way unless first Satan gets permission. &gt;&gt; And that's why the prophet tells us in victory day, think of the title of that message. He said, "When God gives you a test, a trial, it shows he's got confidence in you." I know sometimes we think, "Man, I wish he didn't have that much confidence. But it's just how we look at it, you know. It's how we look at it. But God gives us grace through every test and every trial. And I want to say I want to say it like this. You're still standing. &gt;&gt; You're still standing. It's the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. It'll be worth it all. &gt;&gt; It'll be worth it all every every bit of the way. Amen. Let's just go to him in a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord, how thankful we are for these times, Lord, that we have to be able to come together, Lord Jesus. Truly they are are so precious, Lord, as we dear God, would come and gather with brothers and sisters of like precious faith. It's more than just being together with Lord our brothers and sisters. It's it's you. It's you Lord. And that's what Lord what we long for. That's the part as your prophet said. It's that love of Christ in us that loves Christ in our brother and in our sister. And so Lord, as we've come here together, you're the one who makes the difference, Lord, in this in this moment, this gathering, this meeting. Lord, I'm asking you, dear God, that you would grant every one of us the grace to be able to &gt;&gt; step beyond the cares of this life. Lord, sometimes they the pressures, the weights just of life itself can become so great, Lord. But Father, there's a place in you where we can let off the pressure. And I pray that Lord, here this morning that may you come by, Lord. Father, as we're gathered here in this place, may you touch each of our hearts and our lives. May the pressure, may it be released, oh God. May we, Lord, receive strength, Lord, that's needed, oh God. Whether it's the pressure from sin or the pressure just from the cares of life, Father, may you come, Lord. And Lord God, there be Lord a right release of that, Lord. strengthen Lord your children. May you minister Lord to not only those that are here but those that would be streaming Lord and Father would have to archive the service you see the different ones that are are battling with sickness Lord and recovering and we just ask that God that you would just continue to touch your children and give each one of them strength Lord different ones Lord that's come through surgeries and different procedures Lord be with them Lord I pray those that would be traveling God, be merciful, Lord. I pray. Watch over them, Lord. Lord, we ask that you just come now and and just give to us our daily bread, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, we need to hear from you. We want to hear from you, Father. So, we just commit this this moment, Lord, and ourselves into your hands in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. I want to go thank you musicians. I want to go straight here into the scripture and I'm going to reserve uh from reading from that place in Ruth where we were reading it. Still drawing the thought from there. Um, but I want to look here and come right back into the scripture and then we'll let you have your seats and and turn to some other places in the word of God. Amen. And in 1 Corinthians chapter 6 verse 19 and verse 20, Paul said, "What know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which ye have of God? And ye are not your own. For ye are bought with a price. Therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are gods. Now think of that redemption has all has come when when you have received the Holy Ghost by way of the new birth. Their redemption has come to one out of the three parts in your life. You're a temple three- room house. So one of those parts, the soul has been redeemed because what the soul is, that's actually God laying claim on what is his. This body, this body did not come according to God's perfect will, right? It came under sex desire, permissive will, the fall. It should have, everything should have taken place as far as our coming, our body. It should have come the way God intended it by the spoken word. Right? Then we have the the spirit realm. We received a spirit of the world, a human spirit. We bypassed our theophony, which that theophony is what will take the place of our human spirit. Can you fathom that? That one of these days when you stand there, I want you to think about it right now. You have to battle beyond and press beyond. And God gives you the grace to press beyond all of your memories, all your failures, everything. But you'll stand there in that theophony and that theophony will have no remembrance &gt;&gt; of those failures because that theophony is that word body. &gt;&gt; And then this body, well, we're still going to dwell in a human body, but it will not be one that is come through sex desire. He will call, Job said, and I will answer. He will absolutely transform this body and it'll be a glorified body. We will be a three- room house. That's why when brother Brandham went beyond the curtain of time, they said, "We're waiting to return back." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We neither eat nor drink here. Is that right? &gt;&gt; We're waiting to return back. So, in the meantime, God redeems that part that belongs to him. And through that, God's light will press through in our lives to show his victory, to show his overcoming uh grace and in the molding of our character. And when all of that is complete, we go home. So if God would have thought it was necessary in order for us to live an overcoming life, to have changed our flesh, to have changed our spirit, he would have did it. But he said, "All I have to do is get the nature When I get that nature changed to where it's my nature, then the rest will come subject to that. Amen. You know what he's done? He's placed you as a son and daughter in charge. Amen. You love him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's You can be seated. May the Lord bless his word. I want to turn to 1 Peter chapter 2 and verse 4. And let me read this here and then I'll give my my title. Peter said, "To whom coming? As unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God and precious. Ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ." Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture. Behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, elect, precious. And he that believeth on him shall not be confounded. Unto you therefore, which believe, he is precious. That's the truth, isn't it? Isn't he precious? But unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallow, the same is made the head of the corner, and a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense, even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient, where unto also they were appointed. But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood and holy nation, a peculiar people, that you should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light, which in times past were not a people, but are now the people of God, which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy. I'd &gt;&gt; like to speak on this thought. Redeemed to serve his purpose. Redeemed to serve his purpose. You'll find that how Paul would write and bringing this in in many in many places especially in the letter to the Ephesians. He'll deal with it also in the book of um Thessalonians. You'll touch on these things even in Philippians and then through Corinthians and bringing it back to a place as we read in our opening scripture to recognize that we are indeed to be the temple or the dwelling place of almighty God. Remember God's rest. He said that he would he would dwell in a temple that's not made with hands. And you would say, "Well, brother Samuel, this right here has come about according to permissive will." That's true. But yet, there's not one person upon this earth that has not come come forth from and through and by a creative act. And yet within this, it's not so much this body, but it is the part that God actually lays claim on, which is that soul that come from him. That's why brother Brandon would tell us when you're looking at predestination so clearly and he would go into the message things that ought to be and he would make the statements. You hear it in the latter the latter messages. You you you hear it all the way through the message. Brother Brandon will really take into some real real um pointed statements there in the latter part and say this is why you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour of your life and still be lost and go to hell because without that soul he said there in things that ought to be he said that soul is that real gift that come from God because that soul on the inside is that what God that's what God is working on. God's not trying to get our flesh perfected. He's not trying to get our spirit perfected. God works from the inside out. This is why that if anybody tries to start out here and and we're not talking about where you don't try, you don't apply the word when you know what what is right to do God has done and and brought that to your life. Then there is where that you take by faith and begin to apply the blood to your life to bring sanctification by the blood into your life. So there's an applying of that. We we we can't just say, "Well, I'm going to wait on God." Remember, Brother Bram says, "God will not push us through a pipe and pull us out on the other side." He said, "He's got amazing grace to save you, but you're going to have to fight for it." And he goes on and on in giving that out in Marriage of the Lamb. But where the Holy Spirit comes down is is there upon that soul to where that they're in redemption and he changes our nature and it begins to work from the inside out. And this is why that as he works from the inside out, God, he works to bring about uh change in our life. And you know, uh, I read a little thing here before. It was somebody sent me a little thing here the other day, the brother from overseas, and it was saying that, you know, when when God has come into your life, it doesn't remove the problems. The only thing that changes is is how you approach him. &gt;&gt; And so, that's a great difference in how that God would work in our life. And where where the spirit of God, he comes to abide in our life and to dwell and and to reflect himself through our lives. So, we've been redeemed in this life for a purpose. And I'm thankful because we could try to find our purpose in life. And man can try to um look for that and and and go to great lengths, but you know, our purpose can only be revealed by God himself. And that purpose, the whole purpose that we're here for, sure as father, sure as mother, we have different things, career, but that's not your purpose. your purpose, the main purpose is to serve God. &gt;&gt; And that and the way that we serve God is we serve God by his spirit dwelling within us. That brings us back into the perfect will of God. And so I want you to think of this. Here we are. Paul would write of this on an individual in in this place of of the temple of the living God. And and Paul and Peter would write of this in First Peter chapter 2. and and to and to to express this that here we are as an individual temple yet we're part of the great temple of the body of Jesus Christ and we are also a priest under God in that temple. So, I want you to think of that here. We are as an individual temple. You're a three- room house. And yet, you are also a stone or a part of the economy of God or the body of Jesus Christ, the temple of God, that holy habitation that God has been building that he might dwell in and reflect his life through us. Now, I want you to think of this within when we look at this within worship. And I want to just read a few scriptures here. In Hebrews 13:15, it says, "By him, therefore, let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually." That is the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name. I want you to notice by him. In 1 Peter chapter 2, we read this that as lively stones, you're built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; So here in John 4, he goes on Jesus here in John 4, remember at the woman at the well when she's asking this question, this was a desire within her to know concerning that of of worship. And here Jesus said, "The hour cometh, and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth. For the father seeketh such to worship him." Now I want you to understand that Jesus is standing there as the very example of what a true worshipper is. Not only is he the God of glory, the living God, not only is he come uh to be that of the high priest, he he will enter into that office, but right then and there, he's reflecting what man's purpose was from the beginning. And that was to be a living temple of the living God's dwelling place where true worship, what would be a true worshipper? Would a true worshipper be someone that just that that comes to church? That's partly right. But yet that's not the full defining part. It's one who would worship him in spirit and in truth. So not just in spirit but also in truth. So to think about this, you know, when we talk about truth, I don't want you to get confined to where you think truth is just doctrine. But you know, you can worship God in spirit and in truth as the spirit of God will deal with things in your life to convict you to let things go. Hey, you need to approach it this way. God is leading us according to his character because truth is not a doctrine. It's not a written statement. Truth is a person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I am the truth, the way, and the life." So even in that, you know, even when you brothers turn your head, that's worship. Do you realize that even when there's things that can rise up in in within, you know, a spirit get around you can, you know, try to rise up and you cause you to say something, do you realize worship is actually being able to stand right there and by God's grace hold your tongue? &gt;&gt; That's a worshipper. So worshiping is not oh how we don't want to just limit it to where it's just if our hands are being raised or we've got the right key. Worship is so much deeper than that. God meant for every moment of our life to be a worship unto him. Remember the quote I read to you last week 1963 why Christ speak brother said God goes to church every single day. God lives in his church and God reflects his life through his body. So, we're not just worshippers on Thursday or on Sunday. We are true worshippers. When we have been restored back to that purpose by the spirit of the living God, then we are true worshippers &gt;&gt; because it's Christ seated in his dwelling place. &gt;&gt; It's God who is seated there. And so now Jesus here in this scripture, he's reflecting on what true worship is. You know, one thing I love about God is God just doesn't leave his word open to interpretation. But God comes to interpret his word. &gt;&gt; He comes, you know why? Because every bit of our approach, you cannot approach God, remember brother Ram says they tell people to come to the altar and oh forget just let your mind go blank and let this brother Ram says you better not do that. He said you're allowable to get a spirit but won't be the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Right? So you come with your mind. and you you know what you're doing. You know whom you are approaching and you're coming there with that right approach that's been made. And so as you're coming there and and just channeling within that in in that place to know that there is there is something to where when we come to worship, we're not we're not just coming as far as into that of a building, but every single day of our lives, there is a worship that's to emanate from our lives. Now I want you to think of this here. Here Jesus said God is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. So the Lord Jesus was the absolute reflection. The prophet says it like this in the message indictment. He was the example of what God intended every son and daughter to be. You realize Enoch only heard conversations of what Adam had. Noah heard those conversations, but they had not Adam could only relate those. Maybe they were together in fellowship because you realize there's an overlapping of their of how they lived and in their time frame and they could only have talked about that to hear how Adam would have described it. But God was not interested in sending a description. God comes himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everybody with me? &gt;&gt; That's why when God sent this message, that's why this message, it's different from other messages. &gt;&gt; This message is not a continuation of Pentecost &gt;&gt; because Pentecost did not have the full dwelling of the word of God in their midst. Right. &gt;&gt; Supernatural had returned. &gt;&gt; That right. &gt;&gt; But but now but God's promise is I will restore. Pentecost was not the restoration. &gt;&gt; But the restoration is where that God would come and tabernacle once again within a body, a people that he has redeemed and be able to reflect his life through you and I. And there would not be one thing within the word that you and I would say, "Well, I don't agree with that." Because it's not you as the person, it's Christ in you agreeing with his own word. &gt;&gt; This is why this is the hour and the time of the adoption. It's the time of placing of sons and daughters of God. That's why it's Christ himself. He promised in this hour in the finishing of the mystery of God. And the mystery of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost in you in the very form of the person of Jesus Christ. Where now in this hour you could not have a marriage. Revelations 19. You could not have a marriage if you did not have a bride on the scene. But in this hour you have a bride on the scene. And there's been a uniting. You say, "What has brought the uniting?" It is Christ himself come down in the form of his word. And there's already been a uniting with Jesus Christ. We're not going to a wedding. We're going to the marriage supper. &gt;&gt; Remember, Revelations 19 says it is the true sayings of God that are calling us back there and taking us to the wedding supper of the lamb. The next event is not the marriage that takes place here. It's Christ through an invisible union. He's making himself known to you like he did the disciples that were walking on the road to Emmas. What did he do? He came to them and begin to make known to them according to his word that he was the fulfillment of every promise. And when they could see that and he got in there among them and begin to break the bread, you know what he was doing? His bread is a staff of life. He's the lifegiver. Here he was revealing himself to them. And how they said, "Oh, did not our hearts burn within them?" Notice the effect that it had upon them. It caused them to move and merge into the promise of the word that Christ himself would come into that portion of the word and he would meet the worshipper under the blood and that life would be imparted to them. The Holy Spirit would come now to dwell and reside in redeemed vessels. &gt;&gt; What a privilege. Can you imagine as they walked out of the upper room, they now were a continuation of what had absolutely began in the body tabernacle of the Lord Jesus Christ. The prophets did not even have that kind of a privilege. the spirit would move on them and it would pull back because he could not abide. That was the defining factor of behold the lamb of God whom thou see the spirit uh uh uh descending and abiding remaining upon the same is he. So what made the difference this time was the spirit remained and dwelt there. And see what made that possible because it was that word his word had went forth. Here he was created in the likeness of sinful flesh, but yet he was he was the Passover lamb. And God himself creating that body, that blood cell, God came down and he claimed that that part that he created that through the shed blood of that innocent one, God coming down and become one of us, God might come back into position in the heart of man. That's what the baptism of the Holy Ghost is. It's the rest of God coming in your life. And you know what the rest is? The rest is where you are no longer working, but it's you ceasing and Christ moving. &gt;&gt; It's God advancing his program &gt;&gt; through your life. &gt;&gt; And remember, he doesn't do everything like this. Right? &gt;&gt; God works. There's things sometimes that he'll it'll move right right through our lives like this. And then there's other times where it comes to certain places and it'll come to things. And what is God doing? He's bringing you from Jericho to Ai to the next city to the next city. And every city that you take, it will not be the same as the previous city. &gt;&gt; You know why? Because God wants to declare and not that we would ever get dependent in ourselves. That's what happened at Ai. &gt;&gt; I don't know how I got on this. &gt;&gt; Remember Jericho? After Jericho's battle, look how pride look how pride blew him up. We don't need everybody, Joshua. &gt;&gt; This city ain't that big. &gt;&gt; You know, it ain't that big. We're just going to go up there. It was pride. &gt;&gt; Pride had inflated. We know what Achen did. Pride. There was an effect. See, when when sin or anything that's unconfessed in your life, it'll it'll cause you to start leaning and resting to your own self, you're trying to make your own self, trying to do your own things, trying to cover your own tracks, trying to do everything. You were not meant to rely on your own understanding. &gt;&gt; Listen, friend, this is where a part of our lives and maturity where we have to start. We have to have that discernment to look and say, "God, if I'm leaning on my own understanding, if I'm resting on my reasoning, I am out of my God-given grounds, your God-given grounds of authority is from the soul outward." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Anytime you get in that spirit realm, you're probably going to be defeated. &gt;&gt; The prophet tells us, he said, "If your reasoning goes along with God's word, then all right. But if your reasoning disagrees with it, cast it down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Cast it down. I don't care how real it seems. I don't care how true it might seem. I don't care how it might seem to fit you like a god. That your reasoning is not what you're being molded to. It is the word of God that has been spoken over your life. And when you receive that word, listen to me now. The prophet says in greatest battle ever fought, "When you take that word in and that word," he said it moves and it moves down, what will it do when it gets down here? It has an atomic principle. It will blow out the flu. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why taking in the word where the prophet said as you receive the word, &gt;&gt; you become the word. It's the word blowing things out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm going to try to get somewhere here today. &gt;&gt; So notice this reflection and how that God's approach to worship. Remember even when they would come there to the tabernacle, God would have these types set up in the Old Testament and it all spoke of Christ and the appropriate approach to worship. When the worshipper would come, there was waters of separation that the worshipper would be sprinkled upon the worshipper to cleanse them from defilement. And that's what the preaching of the word is. It's a washing of water by the word. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to hear me now. Not only is the preaching of the word does it bring conviction to the sinner. Not only does it bring a conviction to our life, not only will it expose sin, but I want you to understand anytime conviction or sin is exposed, it's because God is saying, "This is my temple, and I do not want anything else in this temple to hinder our relationship." He's a faithful husband over his house. &gt;&gt; He doesn't want his children tormented. Come on. &gt;&gt; He doesn't want them tormented. You were meant to live and walk in love. &gt;&gt; And God, listen, God just don't want that to be a scripture in Ephesians 2 that you're chosen before him in love. He wants you to experience and to know his love and that working in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, sometimes the way that love is made known in your life, oh, it's even through the cleansing and the forgiveness where you look at and say, "God, forgive me. How did I make such a stupid mistake? Lord, forgive me, Lord, for this trap." And what is it? It's the love of God. And you what it is? It's a love that reaches beyond your knowledge of love. It's that love that reaches down. And what does it do? It's a sanctifying love. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a love that reaches your life to where that all of the little things about your life that you feel like like that of a wife would say, "Well, I can't really do this well. I I can't do that well." But a husband is there to project a sanctifying love. Not to be dishonest, but to project a sanctifying love. Not a demeaning. God does not listen to me. God does not get from his children by demeaning them. &gt;&gt; Y'all know what I'm talking about? Everybody's had no doubt relatives that'll guilt you. They guilt you into talking to mom on the phone. Guilt you to talking to so- and so, guilt you about this, guilt you about that, guilt you guilt you. Guilt you guilt. God don't guilt you. &gt;&gt; So I want you to understand that God don't operate that way because you know why? All you would do it is based on somebody else's guilt. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? So now when I want you to understand that that approach to worship as a worshipper comes now is to see the blood that has gone before and that he has to come under that blood. Now I want you to notice how that within this coming under that blood and coming back to that part of being a priest in the house of God. God said in Exodus 19, he said concerning Israel, "If you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then you shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people, for all the earth is mine, and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation." Now, notice God, we know that God would take the Levites, that one tribe, out of Israel. God actually took that tribe from among the other tribes to serve within the tabernacle. Now some of them what their whole purpose is you had porters you had doorkeepers you had different ones. Some some of them their responsibility was not not about music. Some of them had music. Others of them had you know uh uh the to be responsible for making sure that the fine flour was present that the oil and that all everything with the apocryphe that was that was followed correctly and and how the how bringing all the different herbs together. Each one of them had their own responsibility because it shows that this tabernacle is not something that could be manned by one man. Yet, here's here's the powerful thing. In the body of Jesus Christ, it is Christ that empowers you and I, strengthens you and I, and then turns around, lays a burden on your heart to do something. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you respond to that, and at the end of the road, you get rewarded. &gt;&gt; And it's all under his administration. It's all under his spirit. But he's using his body. God could do it all. God could just simply say, "You know what y'all do? I'll tell you what. Instead, in my tabernacle, we're going to have nothing but lazy boys set up down this side. We'll have them set up this side. Have some little L couches. I'll have some waiters in here. We'll just, you know, I'll tell you what. After I've redeemed you, y'all just sit around and you don't need you don't need to do nothing." But the reality of it is God wants to display his redemption. That's what the purpose that you and I were brought here for. And so God will inspire our hearts by his presence. This is why friends as I said before guilting guilting never works you. This is why the you know even when you talk about burdens and things like that a burden can be a tricky word because someone can say well I you know I'm burdened and nobody likes to feel within that part of burden. There's a heaviness within it. But when God gives you a burden to do something, that burden is there is a supernatural part within that to where that even when you don't feel like doing it. But it is a burden of the Lord that will propel you onward. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, you know, I mean, this is why even over the years of things, I don't want to just ask people, will you do this and do this and do that? Because because if it is, it's constant prepping. It's constant moving. It's constant. It's constant. But I believe that God gives burdens to his people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Because God's not called us to be a prod. We always got a prod. But it's the burden. It's got to be a burden. And when it's a burden, it's Christ that has initiated that burden in our heart. And you can't get away from that burden. No matter what takes place, there is a burden in your life from God. &gt;&gt; And truly, when God places a burden in your heart, you're never going to feel like, well, I can do it. But you'll you'll have a burden to do it and say, Lord, what little I can do, I'm going to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, so God in being a kingdom of priests, this scripture, God would take all of Israel, not just the Levites, but all of Israel would be designated to God as a priest, a kingdom of priest, a holy nation, a peculiar. It don't mean odd acting. It means people who absolutely have a display that they belong to somebody. Remember what what what it was that separated Israel from the rest of the people through the land. What was it when when when when Balam stood up there? Va Balum, he had everything correct. Seven altars, seven bulocks. Oh my. He had anointing. That man had discernment. He had dreams right on the dot. &gt;&gt; Is that right? But yet it was a false prophet. Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But see how God See how God permitted all that? You say, "Why did God why didn't he just take all that out of the way?" But God allowed the wilderness journey to prove what was in the heart. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Sometimes we look at things, you know, in a manner and say, you know, we realize, yes, we come over the Jordan. You always got to watch your types. We come over the Jordan in that of the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Yet the type of being in the wilderness as far as journey into my father's house are many mansions to the other side. We're still in that wilderness journey. And God allows trials. He allows situations to come about. This is why through the journey in Israel's journey, situations would prop up. Listen friends, it didn't take very long. There was some people that started out. Praise God. Glory to God. We're free from that bondage. To them, the message of Moses was only ammunition against government tyranny. &gt;&gt; They did not understand what the message was about. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were like spiritual hippies. &gt;&gt; They didn't want anybody telling them what to do. And yet, the word that brought them out is the very same word that was sent to take them in. But not everybody was going to be a part of that promise. But God never went through and said, "You're not a part. You're not a part. You're not a part. You're a part. You're not a part." God don't work that way. God just keeps manifesting his word. And the conditions of time, the test and the trials that come. Listen friends, there's tests and trials that will come. You have faced that shake you to your core to where you're ready to give up. Like the prophet said, "If that's the way he's going to be, I was about ready to say that." But there was an anchor on the inside. &gt;&gt; You say, "Why would God do that?" God is interested in proving in you as Abraham's seed like he did on Mount Mariah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God knew that lay in Abraham the whole time. &gt;&gt; But God allows the tests and trials to come for what? What's on the inside &gt;&gt; to emanate through the spirit &gt;&gt; and through the body. Now watch here just a moment how God would set this forth with this kingdom of priests. God having a people from from all of the earth, he would bring these people to himself. Now notice in in the book of if we can go to it in this way, if you'll notice in the scriptures, uh if you turn with me, turn with me to Hebrews chapter 7. And I I don't I didn't put this up there because I didn't really know exactly how much I wanted to read out of this, but Hebrews chapter 7. And I want to pull from here just a moment because in this priesthood that God himself set up this Levitical priesthood, these men had to offer sacrifices for their own sin as well as for the people. &gt;&gt; Right? But God allowed God set these types speaking of an antitype to come. And here Paul, my goodness, how Paul would set this forth within it. And Paul would deal with how in Hebrews 7, the coming of the transition of a change in priesthood. And Paul would here begin in the first three verses of of of Hebrews 7. And he would deal with this Melzdc. And he would speak of Abraham's meeting with him. And in verse three he would say without father without mother without descent neither having beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the son of god abideth a priest continually. So there's no other one when you look in verse in verse two he's king of righteousness king of peace or king of salem which is king of peace. This was none other than the prefigure of the Lord Jesus Christ, which God himself, the invisible God, stepped down in morphe and made himself known there in theophony in the midst of the king's dale where Abraham has returned from the battle &gt;&gt; there of Gideon Lot and all the rest of the kings and their possessions. And I want you to think about this for a moment. Everybody with me? &gt;&gt; I often I I just ponder this. I I ponder that Genesis 14 here is all these other kings. The king of Lady Osia, the king of Chalomar, the king of this, the king of this. And these kings are actually offering Abraham things. &gt;&gt; Let us pay you. Let us give you this. Let us give you that. And Abraham shows the motive that was behind it all. He said, "I I'm not going to take a shoe latchet lest you should say &gt;&gt; so that there wouldn't be nothing attached to it." And in the presence of all of those kings, kings are rulers. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Kings are rulers. And in the presence of it, it's almost as though that everything itself, there comes a silencing of all of that's around him. And there's a private meeting with Abram and Melzdc. And this is where that Abraham receives the the the proclamation because when he meets Melzdc, he brings to him a tithe, a tenth of the spoil. Why didn't he give a tithe to any of those other kings? What was the difference about this king than any other one? &gt;&gt; What was the difference? I'll tell you what the difference was. The difference was is Abraham was a seed elect of God &gt;&gt; and he could recognize God's provided way when it was revealed to him. He was not Abraham did not look at Melazdc as just somebody else. But notice when he gave the tenth, you know what that was in the king's lands in that time to give a tenth to take a tithe. It was to give that of an honor to bestow or to recognize one whom is there. &gt;&gt; Are you realize? Because you see, somebody could have gave tithes to somewhere else. They could have gave tithes to the shopkeeper, but it would have never been allotted to their account. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Like brother Ram explains it. Well, you know, uh, brother Ram, if I have my ties, can I go ahead and give it to this poor widow woman? Brother Ram says, no, you take out of this pocket and give to her, but give your tithings unto God in the house of God. See, you don't bring your tithings to a pastor. &gt;&gt; You don't bring your tithings to a pastor. You bring your tithings, it's unto God. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me friends? It because in reality that that is even when we do that, that's only a symbol of what God actually asks in our own lives. That God desires a tithe of our life. He desires our soul. And then once the soul then God said remember tithes and offerings then our spirit and our body becomes the offering &gt;&gt; along with the tithe of our soul &gt;&gt; and an offering remember there's not a determined amount &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; a tithe is a tenth of all but there an offering well the offering you know remember you give a the Bible would always define that it's according to your heart &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; right five however ever your heart says. Anybody want to write $5,000? Praise God. &gt;&gt; We can use it for what we're doing. &gt;&gt; But you understand it's an offering. But friends, that's only that that's only a type of what it would be within our lives. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; But notice where Abraham is. It's like a silent meeting is taking place right here where everything all their voices are being silenced out. You don't even hear it. All of this is taking place. And what is happening is is a special meeting with Melzdc. Now I want to remind y'all, brother Brown will continue to go over this. He said Abraham met me Melzdc after the battle was over. &gt;&gt; But before he got back home, you see before we get to the wedding supper, we'll meet Jesus in the air. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? After the battle is over, after the toils are over, that's the same way. After the battle is over, the wrestling out with sin, the wrestling out with yourself, then Melzdc reveals himself to be your sustainer of the bread and the wine, just exactly what you have need of, the life and revelation of the word operating in your life. &gt;&gt; Blessed be thou Abram of the most high God. &gt;&gt; Amen. not of this one and this one and this one, but this is who you're really of. This is the the person of Melazdc. This is none other than God, the prefigure of of Jesus Christ. It's the tree of life that is speaking to one of his branches. Blessed be Abram &gt;&gt; of the genetics, the DNA, the election, the predestinated plan of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Abraham recognized it. And that's why the prophet said what Abraham did there shows what every predestinated son will do in the end time. &gt;&gt; When you recognize mec &gt;&gt; and you recognize it to be eagle food, you leave that other thing and you cleave to this word. &gt;&gt; It's more than life to you. lady will see and said, "Here, I can make you this. I can make you this offer. We can make it more cushy." But the elect of Abraham's seed, oh, the pull. Oh, the pool. Because Abraham was pulled. You've seen it in other chapters. God allowed that to be shown to you and I. So you and I could look to the grace of God and be able to relate to that. There would be a pull to want to give in. Even sometimes if you have, the grace of God will not allow you to be content in that situation. &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet said, "If you once ever served God and you go away, you cannot until you get back in your place, it'll haunt you until you get back to where you belong &gt;&gt; because you're off your God-given ground. &gt;&gt; Your God-given ground is in Christ. And here Abraham, he surrenders. Now I want to bring this here and we'll try to get to I'm trying to get to a place here. In Hebrews 7 and 11, Paul said, "If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, for under the people received the law, what further need was there that another priest should arise after the order of Melzdc and not be called after the order of Aaron? For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law. Verse 13, for he of whom these things are spoken pertainth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar. For it's evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah, of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning the priesthood. And it is yet far more evident for that after the similitude of Melzdc there arose another priest who is made, this is important, verse 16, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life, for he testifith, thou art a priest forever after the order of Melzdc. This man is life himself. Jesus gave his life. But it was God come down. Our Melzdc, the same God who met Abraham. He came down in the form and the body of Jesus Christ. It was here Melzdc right here among his children revealing himself to his elect. And on the day of Pentecost, they received bread and wine. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Here we find the revealing. So notice God could have all this was made known. You can think how this no doubt it puzzled so much even with the Jews and so forth. Here you have the Levitical priesthood, Levitical priesthood, Levitical priesthood. But all of that was a type. But there was coming a priesthood that did not have a beginning in time. &gt;&gt; It was that which was from eternity. &gt;&gt; Before the devil was ever created, &gt;&gt; before there was ever any unbelief in the mind of God, the lamb was already slain because the names were put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world. So where is that lamb's book of life? That lamb's book of life was in God's thoughts, &gt;&gt; God's heart, God's loin, &gt;&gt; and God himself, he what does he do through that form of Melzdc? As he reveals himself as the living God, as the king and priest of the most high God, God coming down among us, what does he do? He begins to reveal the names of his children. He begins to reveal the perfect will and purpose of God for our lives. &gt;&gt; Do you understand what this means by this Melzdc? This is not a man going back into theories. This priest said this, this priest said this, this priest said this, this priest said this. This Melzdc is that same pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; So now we're not going back through a man. What happens now is with Melzdc, the pillar of fire, it bypasses all the traditions of man and takes us clear back to the origin to the very mind of God to Christ himself. So it's not man's mind. It's not reasoning that's casting out fear. It's perfect love that's casting out all fear. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So God coming down to become one of us. And Melkazedc here, he comes down when he takes upon a body of flesh. What tribe does that body spring from? Well, God created both blood, blood, and there of egg and sperm. God created that tabernacle, but it sprang out of Judah. How fitting because Judah means praise. It would come through God becoming one of us. Even at his birth, praise was offered up. There was worship. The angels were singing, right? There was such joy. Oh, joy to the world. There was such praise, such adoration of of of of who is among us and who is born. And it would only be the beginning of that praise and adoration because God would bring that praise into the heart of a people that would not just be a praise where they would journey on a holy day or on a feast day or on a new moon or under this requirement, but it would be a praise that would rain inside of your heart. You would not be journeying to the tabernacle to behold the shakina glory and God's presence. But now you have become a tabernacle of the living God and the shakina glory. You're a part in the in the economy of God has been deposited in your soul by the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And you know I'm not my own. I'm not the same. No, I can't explain everything. But I know one thing. There is something that changed in my life. The only thing I am obsessed with is I want to please him. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Titus 2, let me skip just to verse 14. &gt;&gt; This is what our high priest did. He gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works. &gt;&gt; Revelations chapter 1 verse 5 and 6. and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood &gt;&gt; hath made us kings and priests unto God &gt;&gt; and his father &gt;&gt; to him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. So now God what he's laid down in type of Israel being a peculiar people, a kingdom of priests, a nation, then out of that God would take the Levites. It would narrow down. Then all of that was speaking of of when God himself was actually coming to redeem and bring to himself that hidden part that's laid through redemption &gt;&gt; all the way down through the scriptures &gt;&gt; which come clear all the way from go from the garden of Eden. God begins to show it even in Eden. And a matter of fact, even in Genesis 1, laying under darkness, void, under such oppression. But now, God comes to bring release, redemption. What's he doing? He's coming to the earth to redeem what belongs to him. No other planet is spoken of or wrote of in that terms in the scripture, but that of earth. How God would redeem that and take it to himself. God showing that of redemption. Remember, even as we're looking at this, even you see uh that of how that Adam's side was opened up and out of his side, God took therefore a rib and begin to multiply with the substance that came from Adam's body. Same thing with it is in the Lord Jesus Christ where God would take from Christ. Now listen, that all how that all that was laying there is the water, the blood, and spirit. But who is he? He's the word. And God would actually go word by word and make up his bride, his people. It's it's his word that's being built and moved within our lives. Now then, how God will bring together a a a a people that he absolutely loosens through the shedding of his blood like that of in order to get Ruth, he had to redeem Naomi's estate. &gt;&gt; When he redeemed Naomi's estate, he got Ruth. Is that right? &gt;&gt; So within getting Ruth now Ruth, it would be the bedding ground in Ruth that was that was given to raise up name to that of the dead. And God has chosen the bedding ground. Remember Jesus spoke of good ground, stony ground, all those types of grounds. The prophet called that bedding grounds. And he says in the message the rapture, one of the places you were a pre-prepared ground. You are ordained to receive Christ in this hour. You say, "What is that ground?" That's that womb. That's that seed that came predestinated from Almighty God. And when that seed was laying there, the seed of God's own life comes in and the quickening power raises up a new creation on the inside. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not a new man or a man made over, but a new creation. a creation that is made by God. King and a priest. &gt;&gt; And I want you to think of this powerful king and priest. How God would put both of those together because you have it has to operate within that way. And not only does a priest have to understand what they're called to do, their position, but there's also got to be some kingly rule in that in that place as well, too. kingly rule. In other words, to say, uh-uh, this ain't how this temple operates. It's to operate like this. How many remember reading Nehemiah &gt;&gt; in the scriptures? Nehemiah was not a priest. He was a governor. &gt;&gt; He was a king. And when things started, when there was hard things that had to be done and said, "Hey, wait a minute here. Who's your daddy?" Um, well, I I I know I'm of the Levitical priesthood. No, no. Who's your daddy? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Y'all know what I'm talking about. It's right there. He did it twice. &gt;&gt; They had no proof of their lineage. And when they had no written proof of their lineage, Nehemiah said, "Get out. &gt;&gt; You're not a priest." Why? Because a priest will have documentation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There is a genealogy, a lineage, a tie in. Let me say this to you and I. You and I did not have a tie in within our own natural birth into the economy of God. We were just like Ruth. We were just like, we were like Rahab. We were like others. But Christ himself, that was a type to show that through him by the union with Jesus Christ, we are brought into union and fellowship as priests of God. &gt;&gt; We wouldn't have even had a fighting chance. Our name's on the book, but how do I get back there? [Music] &gt;&gt; I believe I'm a priest, but how do I get there? &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; How do I get back to that place? Cuz the Bible says by one spirit, we're all baptized into this priesthood. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Into one body. How am I going to get there? There had to be one that came and was made like me. Amen. &gt;&gt; There had to be one who became me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To become my kinsman, redeemer. &gt;&gt; That he might take upon himself my sin, &gt;&gt; my shame, my guilt. You know why? Cuz you can't worship with guilt hanging over you. &gt;&gt; You can't worship under condemnation. You can't worship under that weight. But Christ himself came not only to deal with sin. He came to deal with guilt. He came to deal with condemnation. He came to abolish that. What would be hanging over your head like you're like an eagle wanting to rise up and you get to a certain place and all of a sudden the bars want to smack you back down. Let me tell you something. He didn't just make a hole in those bars. He didn't just put Vaseline on your side and squeeze you through, brother. He opened up the prison and the cage that you were held in. &gt;&gt; You see, you wanted to serve God. Your desire was to serve God. Who put that desire in you? God put that desire in you. And you'll never be satisfied anywhere else outside of the house of God, the body of Jesus Christ, the revealed word of this hour. Nowhere else. You were meant to serve his purpose &gt;&gt; to be a reflection of this hour. The prophet said, "A living oracle &gt;&gt; of the living God in this hour." A manifestation of the living God in this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why Brother Bam stops at the end of Kinsman Redeemer. He says, "And after we've been made sons, sometimes he said, we forget &gt;&gt; how we got where we are. Who was it that brought you where you are? God. &gt;&gt; So go back in your mind and think. The same God that brought you into a place to where there was nothing as far as saying written of you or it was but it was hidden. But God would come and make that known to you. He would so by his presence make himself so real to you and draw you to a place of surrender. Because remember as a priest, as a priest, Aaron, Aaron wasn't the one walking around and saying, "Hey, Moses, you know, we're kin. I'll be the priest." &gt;&gt; Paul said in Hebrews 5, "No man taketh this honor unto himself. But God he said Christ glorified him notself not to be made a high priest. It was not what Christ said. It was not what has as Jesus was walking here. It was not what he was saying. Remember he what he said? He said I my father and I witness. I have a witness that is greater than the witness of man. &gt;&gt; What did what witness did he have? The same witness that he's provided and made available to every one of us. And that's the witness of the Holy Spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; To where listen, listen to me now. I'm going to close on this. To where that in your life, the way that you stand and you defeat every devil and from that place you grow is the witness of the Holy Spirit of what God has done in your life. You stand on that witness. That's a witness of the Holy Spirit. And that's the grounds that you come on. You stand on those grounds. That's the grounds you live from. Don't get out there in your reasoning. &gt;&gt; You can't worship God through reasoning. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't even worship God in imagination because if you're not careful in imagination, I know we can imagine we're somewhere that we're not. But there's also a part of imagination that the enemy will having you believe. And let me just talk it now. He'll take these quotes and scriptures and he'll start and spin these things sitting right here in the house of God and want to run you down and want to run you out of here. That's not the correct interpretation. That's not the spirit of God. That's not the witness of the Holy Spirit. The witness of the Holy Spirit is always wanting to draw you. &gt;&gt; I don't even care how bad a situation is. The Holy Spirit says, "Come. Come. Come. &gt;&gt; Don't stay away. Come." &gt;&gt; At one time it was death to stay out of the Holiest of Holies to her to come into it. Now it's death to stay out of it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why do you think you're here this morning? &gt;&gt; Just listening to the prophet last night. He said, "Oh, brother Ram, you know, I'm just a church, but I don't think I don't think God has any interest in me." He said, "Hold on a second." He said, "You you couldn't even be here at church this morning unless God's dealing with your heart." &gt;&gt; Let me just tell you something. I don't care if the offering you have, let me just say this now. &gt;&gt; The offering you have right now, maybe in your life it's like that, but give it to him. &gt;&gt; And you give that to him, he'll give you more. &gt;&gt; I wish I had some other things up here that I could use. Eventually, it'll go and eventually you'll be offering this. Wow. It all started with this. &gt;&gt; Well, worship what he's done. &gt;&gt; Worship him for what he's done, how you know him to be. You can't worship him according to what he's done for me. I can worship him according to how I know how he is and who he is to me. So, I'm going to worship him. And you know what? As you continue to worship him, eventually your worship turns into this right here. &gt;&gt; You see what's happening? It's more of himself. His life is taking over. So now through avenues of our life, he's pressing himself through what is the witness &gt;&gt; of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; That deposit &gt;&gt; from our high priest &gt;&gt; to his priest &gt;&gt; and his kings. &gt;&gt; And you have been made kings and priests unto God. &gt;&gt; Oh, I wish I could just go on right now, but I'm gonna have you stand that way. I know I'm not going to go on. Some of you say, "Yeah, right." I know I we could just I could go right through and preach it, but I'm not in a meeting right now. I'm at home. These are things I want to really lay in. Look how Brother Ram says this here. Lord, we'll pick it up next week. He says, "And made us priests, priests unto him, offering the spiritual praise of sanctified lips, spending our lives as a sweet offering unto him, worshiping him in spirit and in truth, interceding and petitioning see God working through his body. I mean, if God knew, God knew you were going through a procedure, why didn't God just Hey, but instead you ask for prayer. &gt;&gt; Somebody even comes on your heart. You're driving down the road, &gt;&gt; somebody comes on your heart, what do you do as a priest? You intercede. &gt;&gt; Let me just tell you something. To intercede for somebody doesn't mean you got to get down on these. I know as we get older sometimes it gets hard to get down. You try to find stuff to get up with. Interceding is not that you got to be on your knees. &gt;&gt; You don't even have to have a long long prayer. Sometimes where there's things where God will wake me up. It'll be right in the middle in the morning. Man, &gt;&gt; those times, you know, other times you wish you could go back to sleep, but other times you just like feel so swimming head. Anybody know what I'm talking about? Amen. &gt;&gt; But but somebody's name comes to you &gt;&gt; or there's a burden lays on my heart. What do you do? I just call their name out in prayer. &gt;&gt; Lord God, help them right now. Lord, do for them what they need. Lord, minister to them. Why? You're a priest. You're a priest. &gt;&gt; Interceding and petitioning. Petitioning meaning making requests known. &gt;&gt; No wonder the world does not appeal to us. We are a peculiar people, zealous unto good works. We have been recreated in him to be children like unto our father. Can I read you one more quote? Kind of leave this with you. Brother Rem says it like this. He says, "I guess it's not against the law in Phoenix to say hallelujah. I mean, praise our God. I I think he's worthy of every praise and hallelujah we could ring from these mortal lips. The Bible said, "You're a royal priesthood, a peculiar people offering spiritual sacrifices to God. The fruits of your lips giving praise unto him. Oh my, the fruits of your lips pouring up praise daily before the people." What a high priest we have. &gt;&gt; What a priesthood that we're in. The priesthood of the circumcision, not of flesh, but of the heart. The heart circumcised by the Holy Ghost. Then you can offer praise and adorations to God. The spiritual sacrifice, your lips pouring out praise unto him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What a privilege. &gt;&gt; Is it always easy? Do we always feel like it. No. But this is where you have to live and discern. You know, you don't serve God based on feelings. You serve him based on the witness of who he is in your soul. And from there, he's the strength. And he equips you and me to press beyond our feelings. Because sometimes the very things that's caused us to miss out on the blessings of God is our feelings. &gt;&gt; I wonder think about how the dispersion those of you that as you read through the scriptures and you notice that with all the different responsibilities that the priest would have as I told you some were responsible for making that of the anointing oil. Everybody had their responsibility. You ever heard that term look like ants on an antill? &gt;&gt; It was like when those that concrete company was out here. Different brothers. I remember that last year when you're here. I don't I'm not making light of them. I'm just saying it looked like ants on an antill. I But I never I stood right there on that porch at different times. I'd come out sometimes. I pour right in here. I didn't hear nobody telling somebody, "Hey, you do this or see somebody over here standing around on a on a broom or somebody over here on a, you know, on a shovel or somebody." No. Everybody was doing something. But what if what if one of the priests said, "You know what? I don't feel like making the meal today." I mean, after all, it's not needed today. The meal, it's needed on another day. But every day, I no doubt, maybe that happened, but you know what? Everything had to be in place in order for the tabernacle service to go forward. You know, you know what that service was about? It was about the entire body. It wasn't a service. Oh, Aaron wants us to do this. God said this through Aaron. God said this through Moses. Said it through Aaron. And it was about everything they did when they were making that fine flour. They weren't making that fine flower for Aaron. Paul said, "In all you do in word or deed, do it all in the name of Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; So, we don't want to give God anything less than our best. &gt;&gt; I mean, he he gave his best for us, right? &gt;&gt; And yet, within all of that, to be able to say, "Who are we doing this unto?" It's unto the Lord. Right? &gt;&gt; Because he said, "Let him make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them." Brother Samuel, my part, my part might be a little part. I might have this part or this part, but every part is significant. &gt;&gt; Every part is significant. Your part, maybe you don't really know what your part, your portion, or where where it is. Maybe up to this point, maybe you coming to that place to realize, look, I Lord, I I really need to get in to the body. Not just get in church. I need to get into the body of Jesus Christ. I need I need a real spiritual birth, Lord. I need that reality. I need that. God's not ashamed. Let me just tell you something. You can never bring something to God that God would blush or be ashamed. But matter of fact, what he wants you to do, one of the greatest compliments you could do is bring your needs and your requests before him. &gt;&gt; I'll even tell you this right here. I'm not interested in shaming nobody. I don't care how bad a situation would be. I stand as a Bible preacher and a believer of this message to know that there's no situation &gt;&gt; that's beyond redemption. That's right. &gt;&gt; I stand up on that and I'll stand up on that till either God takes me home or I go by the way of the rapture. &gt;&gt; There is no situation &gt;&gt; beyond redemption. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; And any minister would want to shame somebody, he needs a little correction himself because to understand the grace of God, that's what we're all here about is to call and that God's grace would so move within hearts and lives. &gt;&gt; That's my heart's desire. Yes. &gt;&gt; Is that yours, Lord? Just let me do my part. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to do my part, Lord. &gt;&gt; I want to be faithful. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just pray. Heavenly Father, oh my Lord, &gt;&gt; once again, Lord, there's ways and how that you take us. And I I just, Lord, have to believe how you would guide us on things to be said in the way they could be said. I certainly don't make Lord that every single word that that has come through my mouth as though that that was you. But there's a human element to it as well. But Father, how that you would guide us and that's always my prayer, Lord. We could hurry through an outline and hurry through a thought. Oh my. There's there's places, Lord, I would love to to get to that. But you know what we need, Lord, with a thought that you've burdened on our hearts and you've drawn us, dear God, under the great canopy of your grace. Lord, I pray this morning right here as we've we've gathered, Lord, as priests of God. Lord, to step aside from the the cares of life. I pray, Lord, I I ask you that you would bless your children. Oh, I know it's Sunday, but I don't believe they're here out of obligation. I know some are traveling, some are sick, Lord. But Lord God, those of us as we're gathered here, whether here or on Thursday, next Sunday, should you, Terry, we're not here under an obligation. Yes, the prophet tells us about post of duty, but oh God, it's not out of obligation. It's because we love you. We love you, Father. We want to hear from you, Lord. Lord God, may you, Lord, I pray now. If there's a heart or life that has only known you, Lord God, in worshiping in spirit but not in truth. if they've never come fully into that place with you, Lord, to wear under the blood by way of the new birth to know you in spirit and truth. the living God dwelling in their lives behind that old badger skin where the life of that badger has gone out and there's a new life on the inside. Lord, I pray this morning, God, maybe Lord, where they're at right now, but they're offering up what? Worship. They're thanking you, Lord, for salvation, Lord. God, no doubt other lives are thanking you, Lord. Thank you for Lord sanctifying. Thank you for dealing with me, Lord, and convicting me, Lord, in my life on this. Thank you, Lord, for dealing with me, Lord, in these areas. And then, Lord, other lives would in their worship, maybe it's not like this cap, but at one times, well, at one time, we were like that with that cap on this bottle, but we're no longer there. But Lord, neither do we just want to stay as just that little bottle I had in my hand. Oh yes, I want every bit of that, Lord God, that you've allotted for this moment. I want you to feel it, Lord. And Father, as we would thank you, Lord, and to worship you, oh God, for changing our lives. And then Lord God, as we would see the change that's been brought in our lives, then we begin to grow from that new birth, growing up unto him in all things. And we begin to worship you through the adding and increase of patience. worshshiping through temperance, worshiping you through godliness, worshiping you through brotherly kindness. Glory be to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Lord Jesus, no wonder your prophet, Lord, when he would dedicate the tabernacle there on eighth and pin and God hiding and revealing himself in simplicity, he said, "May we so characterize our worship here and worship here as though we were already over there." Oh Lord God, grant it. I pray, Father. Lord Jesus, how we thank you, Lord. Lord God, what a privilege it is, Lord God, to worship you in spirit and in truth. Sacrifices that are offered up by him, the surrendering of our lives, surrendering of our will. Oh God, worship is more than a note. more than a key, more than a frame, but worship is an expression from the very depths of our life. And Lord Jesus, it works. It works throughout our lives where it may not look the same as us standing here and raising our hands or maybe where the spirit of God has touched us and maybe something the way that we're built and it strikes us and we stand up and say, "Glory to God." Or maybe we take off running or or dancing. But yet, Lord, that's not the only way we worship. Oh, there's times for that. Absolutely. But oh God, we don't want to minimize worship because worship even in that moment, Lord God, where we're standing and we're waiting on an answer, Lord, I need an answer and we're standing there worshiping you while we're waiting. still maybe sickness in our body, maybe a doctor's report that's got a question mark over it, but in the midst of that to worship, [Music] you're the Lord that health all my diseases. By your stripes, I am healed. &gt;&gt; I'm going to worship you, Lord. Grant it, Lord God, I pray. Help us, Lord Jesus. Forgive us, Lord, for when we've minimized worship. Worship is so much deeper than just songs or music or even confined to a part of a service. Worship, worship is where you're seated in the very throne of man. and your life, Lord God. It emanates, Lord, from the depths of our hearts in thanksgiving. For we know who we are. We know who you are. And we're worshiping you, Lord, in spirit and in truth. Deity, almighty God, tabernacled in flesh. Once again, we love you, Lord. Oh my. Could we just raise our hands to him and say, "Lord, I love you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. I'm so thankful, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thankful. This priesthood that I'm in, Lord, I didn't bring myself. I didn't choose myself. I didn't take this honor unto myself, but you chose me before the foundation of the world." Thank you, Lord God. Thank you, Lord God, for revealing that my name was in the genealogy. Oh, God. Thank you for your grace, Lord, that's broke upon our hearts, Lord, to drive back, Lord God, the clouds of doubt, Lord, &gt;&gt; and where our lives are surrendered instruments unto the living God, we can raise as it were our hands like the instruments in the tabernacle, snuffer dishes, other parts that were instruments of worship. Oh God, we love you Lord. Father, grant it Lord God. May our meditation worship you Lord God. May the meditation of our heart be acceptable in thy sight. Oh God, grant it Lord I pray. May you strengthen Lord those that are weary. Touch them Lord I pray. Give them strength in their bodies Lord. maybe through the midst of trials and tests and where they're standing, but God, may your presence, Lord, God, just coming to comfort them right now that Father, as even they're going through this, they can worship you. &gt;&gt; They can worship you. They may not even be able to raise their hands. Maybe something has happened to their arms. Maybe their feet, they're not able to dance like they would want to dance, but they're able to worship you and say, "Lord, I don't care what the doctor's report says. You're my healer." Glory be to God. I don't care what what the enemy's wanted to say. I don't care what has remained down through this family tree. I'm part of that tree of life. &gt;&gt; By his stripes, &gt;&gt; I am made whole. I'm a worshshiper, Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. Oh, don't you love him? &gt;&gt; Go ahead, Brian. [Music] Here I am to worship. Here I am to bow down. Here I am to say that you're my God.
