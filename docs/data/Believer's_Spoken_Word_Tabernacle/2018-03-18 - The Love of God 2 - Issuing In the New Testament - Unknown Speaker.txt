that during that time you know just how long that they've been together as a husband and wife tremendous timing those of you that's lost a spouse you also can be able to enter in into that as well so we just want to turn our attention with the word of the Lord here this morning and just see what the Lord will have for us are you hungry it's just such a such an honor and a privilege that we can come together and to worship their true and living God one of these days these things will be nothing but just a fond memory to be a fond memory and we want to take every every opportunity we have a man and draw closer to the Lord amen let's just stand if we could we want to go right into the word Luke chapter 22 I'd like to start there in verse 13 and we'll just see where we get to here this morning verse 13 of Luke 22 the Bible says and they went and found as he had said unto them and they made ready the Passover and when the hour was come he sat down and the Twelve Apostles with him and he said unto them with desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer this was not going to be a Passover like any other Passover this was a time where fulfillment was present this had been God's longing and desire where his word it's coming to pass for I say unto you I will not eat I will not anymore eat their own until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God and he took the cup and gave thanks and said take this and divide it among yourself well I say unto you I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God shall come and he took bread and gave thanks and brake it and gave unto them saying this is my body which is given for you this do in remembrance of me likewise also the cup after supper saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood which is shed for you amen may God bless you this morning bless the reading of his word have you seen I'd like to continue to look at this thought on the issuing in of the New Testament that I would like to deal with it may be a sub thought the love of God when we think of Testament itself we know that a Testament ISM it's an arrangement it's a disposition it's a will that one desires to be put into effect and yet just like a will that any of us would have or you would make or any person the only way that the will itself can actually come into effect is for the one who has given that of the will or we would say the testator of that will for that one to die and when he would die then the very force of that Testament can come into effect when we look at this and we think of the New Testament no doubt I would say that there's many that just look at the New Testament as a book and as a collection of writings there's many times that all around us that you find situations where many carry around the Bible but they've never they've never read in the Old Testament they've never even for many that's never even heard preaching from the Old Testament I never forget some years ago and there was a group of Pentecostal ministers that came here during a service and different ones they were so struck by the ministering of from the old and into the new and how all of these types and these things were moving out through their means so much to where they they wanted to know can you train us in these things I wanted to arrange a special meeting and I you know it began to let them know it's not something that my and myself can train you it's it's God is sovereign ly giving it by divine revelation and you know that's a great privilege to be able to not just have the Bible but to be able to read it and see and recognize that it is God's God's desire and the great redemptive plan that's unfolded to you and I and it's inspired to our it's not just something that is back there or something that is to come but we see God presently for who he is and working in his word and not just him but we see and recognize ourself in the word that's a glorious glorious privilege so this test this Testament it's more than just a it's not just a mere collection of writings but the New Testament itself is that of the book of the Bible that we ruin we refer to the New Testament it's and it's the actual giving forth of God's own life we'd find were you know the the the disciples and how that Matthew Mark and Luke and John and how that they would write there of the of that of the the life of Christ that was made manifest there up on the earth and they would express many of these things and we know that it's also representative of the guards and how that all of those would be wrote within there and there are ways of the approach of how that man can actually come into a place to approach God and yet then you find how God will move up on Paul and and different others and they'll begin to write by divine inspiration but everything that they're writing when they write to the other churches of Corinth and Thessalonica angulation all the rest of their their writing of the working of God's own life moving in his own body that he has purchased and redeemed for himself and and that's the whole plan of redemption is God's desire is to bring back to himself his children and and to move from just living here within this life to a complete reconciliation to where our lives are changed and where that this earth itself receives her final stage and even to where that we move beyond them the Millennium and walking out on the ashes of the wicked to where it comes into that time of the future home God's desire is for complete and full reconciliation and we find that within this that you know when God issued in the issuing in of this new testament we look sometimes at the word new and and new itself when we look at it we realize that it's not something that is new as far as new in what's been expressed but we realized that God himself already expressed this coming even when he had spoke to Abraham and he confirmed this to Abraham even confirmed it by an oath to Abraham and when we look at that how that within it there is nothing then that could dissing all this a covenant this covenant this Testament was before the law ever came into existence and there was nothing that the law could do nothing that could dissin all it at all and you know we can begin to look at it I think about it that when we look at the New Testament itself in order to really find the origins of the New Testament we've we've got to go back deeper we've got to go back more than just when we look at Abraham because we realized that that is one of the first times that God would would utter within things concerning that and really begin to unfold it but we find ourselves where we would have to actually go back to the eternal one himself to go back into - God Himself when God Himself would just dwell alone when he was there and God would begin to think about himself and think about his attributes and think about himself becoming tangible and how that through the whole redemptive plan where the lamb was slain in the mind of God or all of it was already laid out within God it was already there determined within him and yet God himself had all of these attributes that would it would that he desired to display and we see that within it that God the whole working would be where God would bring back to himself his children through him by the process of redemption that he might be able to have fellowship with man he might be able to have communion and he might dwell in man and warship with them God's desire with all of it this this great Testament we find that when we look at it here I think of how that you think of the great eternal one and how that here God Himself that Great Spirit there was no visible form at all but how that God Himself began to form himself to where that the Bible tells us in John 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with him in the Word was God and we find that how that in the midst of that time that he gave birth to the Son of God not the body but that visible light it was not one who went out of him that was different from him but it was the very God himself that beginning to form himself in a visible form it was that white light that pillar of fire but God himself would begin to veil himself behind it was called himself already showing and condescending of how that he himself was going to take a people unto himself yet in the midst of this time there's still no Adam dust or molecule nothing but it's God and how that God himself out of God here begins to step forth and we find that the Almighty God as he comes brother Ram said it like this in preparation he said let's take a little mental trip tonight you and I let's go back before there was a star in the heaven for there wasn't anything setting way back in eternity that was God and then going out of God or God unfolding himself come below God which was the son of God or the word of God in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word war and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us the logos so it's God unfolding himself so here the Great Spirit where it cannot be seen at at all but now it takes upon that visible form so much to wear that remember in the scriptures it would describe it and say in Colossians 1 who is in the image who is the image of the invisible God it's that same one he by his son that he created the world's created the earth the Bible says in the book of Ephesians chapter 3 that he created all things by Jesus Christ he created all things by His Word and to see how that God is stepping forth within this time of how that God would begin to unfold himself to wear how that God there is a little there's an attribute that's here and we find that God begins to express his word and we see the Sun we see that coming into existence and then we find that little clinker that begins to come off of that Sun and how that even within that there is a reserved place for that clinker to come to a rest that we would know as the earth it did not determine its position on its own called already determined its in the whole layout and as a matter of fact here it was being moved upon and the word itself was putting that earth or that chunk of ice like we would know it it was putting it right in its position but to think how that in the midst of that time that the earth itself out of all the other planets all the other stars it was one that God had already recruited in that very redemptive plan to where that he himself would come down and he would dwell and that this very planet itself would become habit of where it was a place to where God would choose to display his attributes in a tangible manner and the earth itself I love this quote out of power transformation brother man tells us he said when that earth itself to think how God will transform by his word he said that earth how it was moving out there but it obeyed the Word of God and it came in and began to move around that Sun you see what the word did when the word went forth and the earth being a redeemable attribute it responded to the word and the word bought it in and around the Sun so that where that the Sun itself was the center there and to where that that life could actually begin to touch and move upon that earth oh my how that God said it right there with that earth and how that God would come down and in the midst of etter there was a choice place called the Garden of Eden out of all the earth God loved all of the earth but out of the midst of it there was a choice place called the Garden of Eden and in this Garden of Eden God would choose to set up his headquarters he would choose within this to set forth his son and his son's wife you look at it when you think of how that in that creation all here the creation begins to move along bear in the book of Genesis but then how God steps forth there in Genesis 1:26 let us make man in our own image let us make man in our own not images remember that Great Spirit has been one image one likeness here the invisible God now taking for in his word that low loss of God that that's the often II of God the word of God or my let us make man in our own image in our own likeness what you see that the word was never ever meant just to remain just as something way out here that's not visible but call it intense for his word to be made visible in our lives God wants his word to be tangible and you look at how that within everything that had taken place to think of how that God himself coming down to to dwell among his children how that God would come down there and even within when we look at Adam and we see that Adam himself how he he begins to come forth here upon the earth and God moves and God sets forth from that there and that that image God puts that spirit man into a physical he forms that body around it and how that God would set him forth and Adam Woods would stand there and he would name the animals and we know that how they were brought forth Adam was such in tune with God's mind he was speaking remember he was identified with the characteristics by the mind of God he was so in tune with it to what he was calling it that's exactly what God Himself had already and would call it it was perfect but yet before within Adam there was a long it was a longing in Adam no there was nothing of this animal life that could satisfy it nothing so god oh my to see God in His great mercy how that God moves by I don't believe that he forced at him I don't believe that he took him by the hand and and forced him but I believe he was led to a deep sleep the Bible says that the Lord caused a deep sleep to fall upon him it was it was not something of force but it was submission and out of Adam here comes one where God would take that rib part of what that substance that he created and God would go in through that spirit there and God would begin to actually be able to separate the masculine from the feminist and be able to put that into this body and then when he would wake him up he would bring this bride Adams bride unto him that he could be presented unto his son we find that when then the fall itself when all of this had taken place he want it what a time it was you know how that God got it dwell with his creation water what a lovely time it was you know they had perfect understanding of the love of God right there in the garden there was no malice there was no hatred they never they never had to deal with ill feelings they never had to deal with sickness they never had to do that they were perfect it was under God's perfection God's creation and right there they were dwelling in the love of Almighty God God had given them his word that they could live by that word but you know we find that when man himself and when the phone had taken place to where that here man he left himself there was absolutely no way back for man no way there was no way man could get back when Adam walked out here Eve she was deceived within and in how that Adam walked out playing acting out a type of Christ but yet Adam left his self no way back within that friends when we look at that don't ever let that get old that is the heart of it all because even after we have been redeemed it is still him by his Spirit fulfilling his word not by power not by mine but by my spirit saith the Lord there's no church there's no man that can fulfill the word it takes the Spirit of the Living that'll come through yielded vessels that he doesn't matter how much a person knows it doesn't matter how steady they are they still can't do nothing without the Holy Ghost coming down and the Spirit of God performing his word God was laying this down this foundation of where all of this would be laid and you know to think that he himself the very Almighty God becoming one of us you know Abraham met him Abraham met him here after the fall had taken place and he spoke with Abraham and he talked with Abraham and I want to just read just a verse of scripture to you here that out of the book of Timothy were Paul would mention this and a portion aware brother branham would tell us and who is this Melchizedek he doesn't read it but he says when you get time I want you to go back and read these verses scripture in first reverse Timothy chapter 6 verse 13 he said I charge thee in the sight of God who quickeneth all things and before Christ Jesus who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession that thou keep this commandment without spawn unrebuked unto the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ which in his times he shall show who is the blessed and only potentate the king of kings and Lord of lords who only hath immortality dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto whom no man hath seen nor can see to whom the honor and power everlasting a man who we read about Almighty God Amen we're reading about Christ dwelling in the light where until no man can approach and no man has seen him man has seen forms but man has never seen him is that right but how that when we we get to look at it how that God would unfold himself to become one of us God would unfold himself down you know the Prophet takes it like this in the message unveiling of God and you know I appreciate the times how we can look at this and it be so simple that we can hopefully by the grace of God being able to see it that he puts it like this he says it's like a great drummer and he goes on that says you know one person played referring to a play that he had saw one person played three or four parts and in order to do that he changed his maths sometimes he come out he's this character the next time he comes out he's another character but it is the same person all the time no doubt many of probably everybody in here at some point in time has actually witnessed a play sometimes in the plays themselves are you knowing that one person there might be multiple people now when we look at it you'll find how that person can come out and you know if you can set they're in a play and you can begin to look at it and say I think that's I think that's the same individual I think that and you start getting carried with that and forget about the play but you see it's an instance sometimes it's not just about not having enough cast it's that that person itself they're able to act out those different parts and that's chosen and selected and what a type that is of God it was God himself that was acting out each one of these parts it was God himself that was moving through Abraham God Himself that was moving through Isaac God through Jacob God through Joseph it was the same God that was moving through the prophets of all it was that same God who touched the believers of all who are ordained to that work it was the same Almighty God that was acting out each part of the drama remember when he walked on the road to Emmaus they didn't know who he was their eyes were holding that they wouldn't know him he wanted them to see him as the fulfillment of the word see that's the the real way of seeing the Lord Jesus Christ is to see him by way of his word and we're aware that he would take and come by his word and where he himself the Living God would come right down and begin to make himself known that he's the same God he's the same God that was back there as the same God that's here this morning that same God coming to confirm his word to our hearts a great drama that he's acting out oh my to think of this how that if brother n tells us it's the same person all the time and he says that's God he changed himself from a pillar of fire to become a man been changed yourself from that back in the spirit again that he might dwell in man God acting in a man what he really was Jesus was not no second person of the Godhead you know sometimes you ask I ask him to vigil I said what who are you redeemed by who redeemed you and they said what do you mean redemption I said who were you redeemed by you trying to sell me if you're trying to sell me three gods but I'm asking you who which one of them redeemed me and what does redemption mean is redemption just there on the cross or is redemption there of a work that moves into the innermost part of an individual that changes their nature and will eventually change their bodies if Jesus is the second person of the Godhead you're still in your sins there is no hope but it's the very God the God himself coming down and condescending to form himself moving from the pillar fire to become man then he changed himself just stay with me a moment then he changed itself from that back in the spirit again that he might dwell in man God acting in a man what he really was Jesus Christ was God acting in a man in a man in a man that's what he was he changed from the pillar of fire then he had come in which was a veil in the wilderness that God hid from Israel watch this now Moses seen the shape of his body but really he was hit all the time behind this pillar fire which was the logos that went from God God was dwelling there in that pillar of fire in man it was a visible form but yet no man had seen God is that right no man had seen God and here God is dwelling in that pillar fire but now from that pillar fire remember when Moses said asked to see his glory what did he saw he saw the Honda parts of a man remember when Moses said remember what Moses said Lord let me see your face he said I can't it's not face time yet you cannot see my face yet is that right yet the mystery is he spoke to Moses as a man face to face though what is face his presence his presence what Moses had asked to see he let him see the hind reports of a man that this would be the fulfillment that the presence of the Lord would fulfill this but zeal of the Lord would fulfill this and he would bring forth a body a temple that he himself would change from the pillar of fire to dwell in man but yet Moses could speak to him face to face presence of the Lord and that wonderful you know you've been given that same privilege to be able to speak to him face to face no matter where you're at you might be in your timing on your ironing board you might be right there in the factory you're given that privilege because let me tell you he said lo I am with thee always amen the word itself a Ministry of the Spirit has brought you into this place to where you have an access whereby that many could only go once a year but you live there that is your place where youth well it has been made for you and accessible that we can live there in his presence and talk with him and he with us what a privilege oh my the Prophet says here he goes on to say how that in them in the midst of it when we're looking at how man he left himself no way back think about when that fall had come play I've taken place there in the garden how that God stepped down and God the very love of God move down the very heart of God and said I'll make a way back for you I will give her a seed look friends they were walking out with no hope they had lambs skins on them that's true they had lambs blood but who came from that not there he gave them that they couldn't stand in his presence and where at one time they had stood in his presence but God's desire for fellowship was so expressed that he took the clothes the skins of an innocent one and slayed an innocent one and through the skins in and says come out come out and when they would walk from there the very presence of God how the Prophet would describe it that white light began to come down that great pillar of fire and it began to write out l.o.v.e the very expression of his word where I will give you a seed was the very love of God we know that there's no way that the woman herself does not possess the seed but yet God Himself said I will give you a seed look how God began to move with the foundation I know I'm referring to a lot of these places but look how God begins to move with the foundation he had a masterpiece and his son and his bride there in Eden and God begins to move back and there's a great foundation that's laid for this masterpiece you know many of you you've seen Michelangelo some of you know they have the little statutes and things like that and I remember a time I remember how old I was but it seemed like they were really selling them you knowing I still like to get my hand on one of them right now I don't know where they're at so but I they were selling them some of that some of the church there and where we were going and and you know you see on the bottom of those statues there's a foundation there's a foundation you can't just have it there without a foundation there's got to be a foundation or a platform for it to rest on and God Himself you know he he just didn't come there within a body but God began to set the very foundation of the program and how that God would lay it first of all with faith there with Abraham in an elective faith it was it was faith it was God God who called to Abraham God was determined to save man it was not Abraham looking for God but God was looking for Abraham it was not Abraham praying and seeking after God but but no doubt there was probably something within Abraham's life that it was looking at there's got to be something more than this but who gave him that God gave him bad and and then one day how that God spoke to him and and then spoke to him that you know I get the out of the land of thy kindred and my Nativity and unto a land I will show thee and and I will bless thee and I will multiply thee and all of this had promised that God had given you find Abraham Abraham you know he goes a little bit journeys a little bit and he stops down there in one spot but you see God's determination this was not based upon Abraham strength or Abraham's ability oh my but God Himself was moving upon Abraham and it would be God's faith that would so move upon Abraham to where there would be such a foundation of faith that would be laid for this masterpiece to come there through Abraham Abraham had such faith to even think about it with with Isaac you know and how that Isaac represented that of love think of them that of how Isaac you know I just thinking of that how that Isaac himself he comes up to this place and you know he submits himself to his father Abraham's walking in faith you know this is faith Abraham's not walking without faith Abraham's faith is is reaching such a time of maturity but you know there's only one way that he could have that kind of faith it's because Abraham has a real love there's only one way because you can't have faith without love I'm talking about a faith that trusts God's trust God in all things because faith worketh by love Abraham trusted God you understand what I'm saying it's like you could trust you and maybe your children or or trust you know somebody to come into your house if you're gonna be gone on vacation or something you can trust him to come into your house there's a trust but how much greater that's just an example but how much greater God trusted Abraham so God trusted him and Abraham trusted God it's just such a measure to where when Abraham said I'm gonna go up on this hill I am the lad and we're gonna come back we're gonna go worship and we're gonna come back down it was speaking of the greatness of the obedience of the very Lamb of God and through that obedience he would be raised back up among the true worshipers that were born our faith Lauria Isaac's surrendered himself father where's the sacrifice was an act he submitted himself into the hands of his father he gave himself what love then you find Jacob my brother man he really says that in the masterpiece he says Jacob means grace he said anybody knows that he said you just study Jacobs life and you study Jacobs life study Jacobs life after God transforms him when he brings out the hidden mystery of Israel then you find places in the scripture Israel's acting and then there's times in the scripture Jacob is acting you with me it's just like you and me there's parts where how it is the God part and then there's parts about us that still the Samuel part come on but the main thing about it is we have been changed we've been quickened our desire has been changed glory be to God Jacob is Grace it could only be issued in with truly divine grace and then to see how the very top of it of this foundation would be perfection and that of Joseph and here that body would set upon that perfection so this foundation of which the first masterpiece the bridegroom was brought forth is the same foundation upon which the very bride herself is brought forth by the very faith and the love and the grace and the perfection of Almighty God it's God's great determination it's God's great working and think of how that you know God he preached this to Abraham God preaches you believe that he preached to Abraham when he called Abraham Paul says he preached this gospel unto Abraham wearing that God would justify the heathen so here remember when he brings Abraham you know Abraham's coming to a place and Abraham begins to ask God he says Lord what are you going to give me what shall be mine ere I have this Eliezer of Damascus now remember you got to stay on the top when it's time to stay on it and move on when it's not time for it in this particular looking at a scripture Eliezer could not be his heir because Eliezer was not born in Abraham's house he was not of his seed there had been listen to me now listen now there were many that were bought along the journey even when you look at how God when he would issue in how Israel were to treat those who were strangers that had been brought in in wouldn't treat them bad but there was still a part of it to wear when you look at how Abraham even one down and remember he went after lot he went after a lot and all those servants that were down there they didn't come back there and and serve and and move where Abraham was at but yet he loosened them old friends there's many lives that God sets free and loosens but yet they never ever were ordained to be a part of that elective grace of Almighty God but yet thank God for salvation they can serve Him as servants but let me tell you you were never ordained to be a servant you were never ordained to be a slave I don't care how much sometimes you might think that I'm unworthy I'm this remember it was never anything based on our worthiness or your worthiness we are sons and daughters of God by the elective grace of Almighty God it's God moving through and by that very process of redemption that brings back his children unto himself it moves upon Abraham Abraham said whereby shall I know I shall inherit and God moves down and it begins to confirm his covenant unto Abraham this is how you're going to know it I think of this how that God had Abraham to separate those beasts whose bodies he had him separated showing that of the law in that of grace this covenant is a covenant of grace but God was already showing that the law would come but the notice there was no way to join that of the law and that of the grace but that little white light that logos God Himself moved right down God in Christ moved right down and right through those feasts and proclaimed I will make a way this is the confirmation of it Abraham that's a confirmation that your seed will inhabit the land I will bring forth your seed God confirmed it right there that was saddled that was to confirm it to Abraham that his faith resting and God you see friends it was not up to Abraham to get stronger it was not Abraham when we sat down with him on that day it's not Abraham gonna be sitting there saying well you know what I read the promises over and over and over and as I read the promises over and over I recited them I memorized him I talked about it and I got stronger nonsense it is not not of worse but I do believe that Abraham lived in those promises I do believe he read those promises why would you not want to read something that's about you why would you not want to rehearse something that God had said about you that's why Abraham would rehearse it - I signa remember even when Abraham would express this to the different ones on down it was not just merely the handing of a word to another but God would come and confirm his word of oath that he gave to Abraham and in each time God would say that I am the God of thy father he told Jacob I'm the God of thy father Abraham Abraham was his granddaddy but that faith or my Jacob was of the same one that Abraham was of Jacob was born of that same faith that same revelation I think of Joseph was born other - you realize if they hadn't been born of it when Jacob told him even you remember when Jacob was saying when I pass take me down there and bury me and they did think about when Joseph Joseph said don't you leave my bones here he said you take me with you when you leave when God visits you you see how he could stand there he knew the Santhal oh god it's gonna visit his people the time didn't get easier the time got harder the persecution grew great but it was at the time when the persecution was growing great that God stepped on the scene and fulfilled his word oh my it would be no Marvel when everything is easy and everything is smooth but God steps on the scene when everything is against it all opposition is rising and he declares himself to be Almighty God I tell you this morning that in whatever the need would be in your life it might seem that the mountain is so high it might seem that the river is so deep but the same God who opened the Red Sea the same God who part of the Jordan the same God that can make a tunnel through a mountain is the same God for your need for your situation he specializes in things thought impossible he makes himself known now let's look at this for a few moments there's an entrance of the law we know that Israel coming out of of Egypt that God had moved down there grace gave the promise to Abraham is that right God's grace moved down and called his man for the hour his prophet God's grace this pillar of fire he came to confirm that that is all the grace of God and he moves down there into Egypt and brings out the children of Israel then we find within this moment that there is a or Israel makes a choice they're not forced into this decision they're not forced to make this decision God had told him you'll be a peculiar treasure unto me but I was marvel I look at how that brother random will use this a few times in the message and talk about how that Israel made a rational mistake in Exodus 19 and when you look at it you you see it that there is a covenant that is given and it truly is a covenant that is given by God but Israel enters into it and it when brother raddimus he'll go into dealing with that you know that it had to be within the hearts of the people to wear that has he said they rejected grace and began to take something that they could do themselves God was speaking to him but they said don't let God speak no more and let Moses speak we all understand that's all working out and a great program and plan of God but then to see how this law itself let's focus in on this how the law itself would enter the law comes about Paul tells us it was added because of the transgressions is that right it was the law was given that sin might abound be declared so great you see it's like this out here on this roadway I try to take the youngest one of the youngest persons in here and I could ask them and say in your car if you ride with mommy and daddy or you ride anywhere else can you go as fast as you want to go well you know you can't now you can put down the pedal you can get out here on 480 and just hope you're one that don't get flagged over 480 is 160 60 I think so don't don't look by what the cars are going on there but here's a speed limit let's say right out here out 35 miles per hour right out here on this road you can go faster but what happens when you go above 35 you're gonna get pulled over in this village you go a few miles over you're gonna be pulled over you say how do you know I've seen some of you over the years and it's true it's true you know it's just like this you know certain places where you can drive and you could say ah we can go a little bit and we give it a little bit of grace you know they give a little bit of grace what's greats mean well they give about five miles over there they're okay with it you better hope they don't get a new recruit they don't know that unwritten rule but you realize that when that that law is set out here if you if you run that law what what you know what good does it do if it's out here 35 miles per hour and you've got cops that set right out here what good does it do if you if people are running up and down here 55 or 65 miles per hour 35 might be right out there he don't mean nothing you know it's like somebody say hey what does that sign me they don't mean nothing you see it's become something that it doesn't hold it holds nothing to it it's it don't mean anything they just say that it don't mean anything now God has given his word and God has given his word now we understand that the law itself it entered in to magnify said it pointed out that we indeed were sinners we were guilty let me tell you something God's Word even under the administration of grace it takes God dealing with the heart to bring conviction for a life to see I need him it's not oh they don't matter I'll read this in the word and this is what God says concerning women and God says this in our dress and God says that we should be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ oh don't pay no attention to that really that like going right down this roadway right here and saying that sign 35 miles-per-hour who cares you don't have to do that but every word that God has given must be fulfilled and he gives us the grace he gives us the grace to even come to him it's him that gives us the grace to even be cleansed and set free by the blood it's him that gives that's third stage of grace to where he'll step inside of you and I it's all him working but it's us submitting and surrendering to that word so the law itself it magnified it it spoke of the need because the law could only put you in prison that's all the law could ever do it could only put you in prison now think about it this first covenant that God gave this first covenant now the Scriptures refer to it like this as the first as the first covenant but it's when Paul speaks of it in the book of Hebrews but he's not referring to that covenant that God made with Abraham this first covenant that he made with the fathers when they came out in that Exodus and when they came out not only within this first covenant that God make this this first covenant with them that law and Israel was enjoined to that law but in this there was a tabernacle there was a first tabernacle there was a that second partner there was the holiest of all and to think of how that God God himself in the midst of his time talking with Moses there in the mount God spoke out his desire he said let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them remember God's desire is to Tabernacle inside God's desire is to dwell in side of his children and so to see how that within this how that God would lay out even within the tabernacle itself even all the parts that were laid out I go back to this scripture here in Exodus 33 7 and I'll think about when Moses walked down off the mountain God had told him get down for the people have sinned a great sin they made back golden calf you know Aaron was still under that inspiration how they made that golden calf that this be there this be that God's that brought thee out of Egypt and here there turned us there there turned aside after what God has already told them in a previous chapter I believe it's Exodus 20 were God had already expressed to them not to do such a thing but then to think we're God himself after Moses himself the Spirit of Christ steps in to intercede for the people of God to where that he comes down and remember the scriptures are very clear how that the Spirit of God Moses says who's on the Lord's side let him come and stand by me and we see this begin to take place and after God moves through the camp and removing all of those who truly had sinned against him but then Moses went up to make an atonement Moses then comes back down and in this verse of scripture how that Moses was directed by God take the tabernacle and put it outside the camp God told him and said I will not and I cannot go up in the midst of you you're a stiff-necked to people rebellious I cannot go up in the midst of you but notice his desire for relationship he did not remove it altogether he put it outside of their camp he put it outside and the Bible says that within this scripture here that Moses took the tabernacle pitched it without the camp afar from the camp and called it the tabernacle the congregation and it came to pass that everyone which sought the Lord went out unto the tabernacle the congregation which was without the camp where did Jesus die not in the camp he suffered without the gate is that right when they had rejected him come on somebody what did Stephen say when Stephens to do that day he said you stiff-necked on circumcised and ears is that right but there were some who were in Jerusalem who went out there were some who caught hold of the vision and some who went out and who became a partaker of that life well God's desire that that Tabernacle would be pitched then we come here in the scripture Hebrews 10 chapter 4 for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins wherefore when he cometh into the world he say a sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not but a body hast thou prepared me in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou had us no pleasure God himself remember when he came to Mary listen to me now he came to Mary he said Behold you're gonna be with child how is this gonna be Lord seeing I don't know a man he said the Holy Ghost shall overshadow you Gabriel made the announcement that this within you will be a work of Almighty God it will not be anything of Mary but God Himself was going to prepare a body that he himself could come and dwell in the Almighty God stepping down to take kinship with man God created that body that blood cell every other blood was polluted is that right nobody you could take the most righteous man there was not one of them not one of them not one couldn't make a way back not one of them there's only one that could do this and that's God himself in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou had us no pleasure and to think about it there are many great men there are many believers who offered these sacrifices but it did not fulfill God's desire it was given for that time but God's desire is that he would dwell in his people in Redemption is that right the Bible says in Hebrews 9:11 let me just refer to this but Christ being coming high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building this body was a creation of God by his word he spoke his word and Mary believed it why did she believe it she was ordained to believe it she didn't know that she was the vessel but God declared to her she was the vessel she was the one that where Isaiah would speak up but here God Himself coming down into her now look at this now God has come and he has come in physical form multiple times already is that right but he could have never went to Calvary that way never he had to come through and by the woman he had to be made under the law in order to redeem his visitations to Abraham he could not have just went it wouldn't have paid the price come on somebody so think about this this was not something that was a pleasure ride it was not something that anybody would just sign up for I hope you're with me this was not something that anybody would volunteer for because in order for this notice even the condescending and coming down and becoming one of us he took upon himself a body made in the likeness of sinful flesh but to think of it friends he came in that countable body the very king of glory the very one who created let the atoms the molecules the stars the very earth and the very creator himself coming down creating a body but he might step into it for redemption one bid he what drove him to that what brought him from glory what is that that's in constrains him it was love his love his desire for fellowship for communion with you and me his desire brought him down don't you realize it that your power of your need is so great the Bible says in the scriptures it says that the husband hath not power his body but the wife the wife hath not power her body but the husband don't you realize that it is your need that draws him to you and it was his need to be worshiped as Redeemer that has drawn us unto Him God he creates a body for himself to come down and dwell in the Bible says in verse seven then said i lo i come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will O God above when he said sacrifice and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not neither had his pleasure therein which are offered by the law then said he lo I come to do thy will O God he taketh away the first that he may establish the second now he can't not come back down he can't come down and rewrite his word that will not be a taking away that would be an uh-oh oops I changed my mind but he has to be there has to be one who's able to take away the first this first covenant this which he made with the fathers when they came out of Egypt the law there has he has to be able to do this that he might establish the second don't you see friends he can never walk by law and grace it cannot be law and grace they cannot be under bondage and under fear God doesn't want you to serve Him under fear God doesn't wants you looking at I'd better do this and I'll tell you what if I don't go to church but the same is liable to call me or somebody's label to call me or or somebody God don't want you serve him by law gun don't want you to do anything about all this and friends you can get so carried away by law in looking at things to where you begin to look at the things you do as though you're meriting God's favor on a daily basis let me tell you something the greatest thing that God can have is a heart that is surrendered to him that he can come down and speak to that you might know you might be a time you're walking right down the store you might be standing right in the kitchen folding the clothes but you could say Lord I Love You Lord Jesus how I thank you Lord and oh my what is that His grace will come by his miss presence moves right down it's not something that you're made to do he's not standing there saying now you tell me you love me you you offer a praise to me if you don't wash him you know no I delight to do thy will O God now you must do this no I delight to do that well Oh God well if I don't do this I'll be lost no no no that's not that's not how he wants you to serve him but his word ministers his word ministers in grace to reveal his way that we might approach him and that he alone can take his word and ride it into the very depths of our life till it's no anger I can't do this I can't do this I better not do this but when he writes it with his life it's no longer I can't I don't want to my love is to him and to him alone it's him that I desire to please time just running out on me but let me just try to drop this because I have to close in order for God to take away that first and establish that second he had to become flesh and he had to take the penalty of his own law and not just take that penalty but God himself would so subject himself in humanity that he would literally take his own laws and live by now remember when he came here he is he's the very lawgiver this is the very one who spoke to Abraham before Abraham was he's the very one who spoke to Moses on Sinai he was the very one in the midst of the bush dwelling there he's the very one that there gave the commandments that by his presence his light his finger as it were wrote the commandments and gave him and here he himself the law giver the sins and takes upon a body remember what the Pharisees and what many of them thought at that time they thought he came to destroy the law you see they didn't understand it needed fulfilled he told him I have not come to destroy it I come to fulfill it is that right here's the lawgiver himself stepping down and OMA that blessed day there at the River Jordan here comes his tabernacle his temple walking up to the Jordan here stands John a messenger preparing the way and here comes this temple this body becomes walking into the water and as John baptizes him in water it wasn't baptized because he needed to repent he was being washed as the Lamb it was also preparation for his coming ministry as high priest and as he comes up out of the water the heavens are open and out of the heavens here comes the Spirit of God descending like a dove you see it had come there when every Tabernacle had been built it was him coming to the tabernacle that announced the finish and here he comes and steps in the messenger of the Covenant steps into his temple suddenly greatest event greatest event that took place upon earth God and man had reconciled God and man had reconciled there'd be many prophets that had lived before but God was not able to reconcile with a man who was born in sin now one of them could fulfill the law but here comes the lawgiver himself all hope was lost but here he comes according to his word and the body that he had formed by his word he steps down and he makes a claim this is my body this is my body so much of my word has went forth to make this body their right form from them same elements of the earth but a blood cell now through this god himself will fulfill his own law for what for what for you and for me somebody to do that for you do that for me oh how we owe him our whole life it's not something where it comes to that of a law but it's a love affair that he could express his desire he is loved in such a manner he just didn't say it he just didn't say it he manifested it he took his own laws and lived by it thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself he manifested that he manifested that for he became one of us that he might redeem us thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart soul mind body and strength never had there been one upon the earth because I could declare that but here he stood the very love of God himself why that he might offer up and pay the price and bring this love into the heart of you and me he took his own laws and lived by them I'm closed I told you that before Jesus did not walk around this hell yeah I can't do this what was it that constrained him the same thing that constrains you the love of God I delight to do thy will O God it was resting within his heart here was the love of God on display o love of God how rich and pure how measureless and strong friends don't you see don't you see what the real true working of redemption the real true baptism of the Holy Ghost it's the love of God moving into your soul that changes you to where you no longer desire the things of the world you desire him and your desire is I do only those things that please him my desire is to live for him and if you go to do something a little wrong think something wrong that dove is there and that dove is there to bring correction what is that that's the love of God oh love of God how rich and pure do you see God's design was not that he any mortal would serve him out of law but out of a love affair to wear a life that is surrendered unto Him giving our all to him surrendering our all his vessels that he might have the right of way you love him this morning I trust I trust that the word where we've even come to in this place I trust that it could brings you to a place to say Lord I want to surrender my home I want to give you more Lord God all of me Lord Jesus I want you to have all of me Lord God living out your word through me Lord if there's Lord you see my need as you spoke this morning that it's the need in my life

glory [Applause] what's your loving day the love of God is just so overwhelming you think about it just was thinking about how Joel and you look at all this God makes known his love and his care Joel he didn't have the Bible like what you and I have he didn't have that he didn't have any chapters or anything to refer back to but he could look up and he could read in the heavens the love of God it was known to job to see how that that God all around us all around us well did Paul write by inspiration God makes known his Godhead all around us he makes you known the greatness of and yet some of the sometimes the little things that we can go right by like we take right now out of here in nature pretty soon you know daylight's were we're getting longer days right now y'all ready but play outside a little bit longer it's nice in there I like it too but you know what there's little things that starts coming out and you start seeing them buds with Dominic they start swelling on the tree
