[42:37] amen and amen
[42:40] amen thank you musicians amen God bless
[42:43] you thank you let's turn to Jack
[42:45] Zechariah Chapter 4.
[42:48] and I just want to begin just to draw
[42:50] from there just a few moments
[43:03] and I just have just a
[43:06] I want to read down through verse 10. if
[43:09] we could
[43:16] this setting is where Israel has
[43:18] returned
[43:20] back from captivity where they were
[43:23] carried away
[43:24] to Babylon and we know that that was
[43:27] because
[43:28] of disobedience
[43:31] and I want you to think of this just for
[43:33] a moment
[43:36] they were disobedient after God had
[43:39] provided everything that they had needed
[43:43] God he let him know all
[43:46] that you all that is required is to
[43:50] serve me Faithfully
[43:52] and then little by little by little
[43:56] it come into a place of full
[43:58] Disobedience and Disobedience isn't
[44:01] something that starts with big things it
[44:03] starts with little things
[44:05] and then it just keeps on compiling
[44:08] but this is what I want you to see
[44:12] is God didn't write them off
[44:16] God let them know before they ever left
[44:19] the land
[44:20] and even matter of fact before they ever
[44:22] set foot in the land in the book of
[44:24] Deuteronomy God already let him know
[44:27] this was going to take place God already
[44:30] told him in the book of Deuteronomy
[44:32] you're going to set a king over
[44:33] yourselves why God knows the ways of man
[44:39] God knows us and let me just say it like
[44:42] this God has never and never will ever
[44:45] put stock in our Humanity
[44:49] God's confidence is solely in his word
[44:55] but God said I will make a way back
[44:58] and I will bring you back into the land
[45:02] and even in this moment they've come
[45:05] back into the land I'm not preaching yet
[45:07] but they've come back into the land in
[45:10] 15 years have went by
[45:14] where they became occupied they became
[45:17] focused on other things of life
[45:22] I look at that and I think my God could
[45:25] just say
[45:26] you didn't learn the lesson the first
[45:28] time
[45:29] you're back in the same same mode that
[45:33] you were before
[45:35] but he didn't
[45:38] God made a way now it wasn't God
[45:40] overlooked it remember what God did God
[45:43] has a way of dealing with it God wants
[45:46] you and I to say the same thing that he
[45:50] says to where when he sent his word they
[45:53] then recognized oh I've got away from
[45:56] the main purpose
[45:57] what was that the grace of God
[46:01] and then this is where this comes in in
[46:04] Zechariah 4 very fitting of the hour
[46:07] that you and I are living in
[46:09] and the angel that talked with me came
[46:11] again and wake me as a man that has
[46:13] awakened out of his sleep and he said
[46:16] unto me what say is what sea is thou and
[46:18] I said I have looked and behold a
[46:20] Candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon
[46:23] the top of it and his seven lamps
[46:26] thereon and seven pipes to the seven
[46:29] lamps which are up on the top thereof
[46:31] and two olive trees by it one up on the
[46:34] right side of the bowl and the other
[46:36] upon the left side thereof so I answered
[46:40] and spake to the angel that talked with
[46:42] me saying what are these my Lord then
[46:45] the angel that talked with me answered
[46:47] and said unto me knowest thou not what
[46:50] these be and I said no my Lord then he
[46:53] answered
[46:55] and spake unto me saying this is the
[46:58] word of the Lord unto zerubbabel saying
[47:01] not by might
[47:04] nor by power but by my spirit saith the
[47:09] Lord of hosts
[47:10] and what is seen a vision of
[47:13] is this working here of the Candlestick
[47:15] which was already given by God
[47:20] when Moses gave the pattern for the
[47:22] Tabernacle but that same of the seven
[47:26] candlesticks would also be the type of
[47:29] God bringing a people out of Babylon and
[47:33] talking about you and I Babylon is
[47:36] confusion
[47:38] where we don't where your person doesn't
[47:40] know where they're standing doesn't know
[47:42] what to believe in
[47:44] God has called us out of Babylon
[47:48] and what the other ages did not know and
[47:51] did not see they were waiting on the
[47:53] coming of the Lord but you and I where
[47:55] we are standing in this moment is God
[47:58] letting us know those ages they have
[48:02] already come
[48:04] and we're standing at the end
[48:07] we are standing at the end so this is
[48:11] the parallel of where we have come to in
[48:14] this hour
[48:15] not by might nor by power but by my
[48:18] spirit saith the Lord of hosts who art
[48:21] thou o great Mountain before zerubbabel
[48:24] Thou shalt become a plane
[48:27] anybody ever seen had obstacles in your
[48:29] life
[48:30] maybe you still have obstacles
[48:33] let me just read the promise who art
[48:35] thou great Mountain
[48:38] before
[48:39] zerubbabel Thou shalt become a plane
[48:43] who is this Ruble a type of Christ
[48:47] Thou shalt become a plane who who is
[48:50] where is Christ Christ is in his body
[48:53] is that right it's Christ anointing you
[48:56] and I to believe his word
[48:58] Thou shalt become a plane and he shall
[49:02] bring forth The Headstone thereof with
[49:05] shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it
[49:10] moreover the word of the Lord came unto
[49:13] me saying the hands of zerubbabel have
[49:16] laid the foundation of this house his
[49:19] hands shall also finish it and thou
[49:22] shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath
[49:25] sent me unto you for who hath despised
[49:28] the day of small things
[49:31] for they shall rejoice and shall see the
[49:34] plummet in the hand of zerubbabel with
[49:37] those seven they are the eyes of the
[49:40] Lord which run to and fro through the
[49:42] whole Earth
[49:44] amen if God would help me this morning
[49:46] just a just a little thought that God is
[49:49] so inspired upon my heart and I want to
[49:51] speak on the depth of God's grace amen
[49:55] may God bless you as you're being seated
[49:56] this morning
[49:59] God all night
[50:03] just as I am just pondering and
[50:06] just looking as the Holy Spirit just
[50:10] just seems to just grab my heart upon
[50:12] this and then throughout
[50:14] the time and the weekend and
[50:17] you know brother Jerry when he stood
[50:18] here last week and he spoke on stories
[50:22] of God's grace
[50:24] and there's really two parts that I want
[50:26] to bring out of this and not necessarily
[50:28] maybe two services but just to try to
[50:31] drop this in here this morning in that
[50:34] of how the grace itself stands for us
[50:37] and how that Grace holds us
[50:41] and when we look at the real truth uh
[50:44] there is a real truth to Divine Grace
[50:49] um Grace that we can see today that
[50:51] would well if we could look at it that
[50:54] would no doubt be the very favorite
[50:56] topic we even see churches that are
[50:59] named in those ways Grace Church and
[51:02] Grace and I have nothing against the
[51:04] church being named that way but I
[51:06] believe there's a true Grace of almighty
[51:09] God and I believe that Grace has been
[51:11] laid out I I don't believe the grace of
[51:14] God comes uh to us in a manner just that
[51:19] without an effect and a reality that
[51:22] takes place on our life you know brother
[51:24] Branham himself when he was many times
[51:27] criticized
[51:28] and he he spoke of this of how that he
[51:32] was so criticized on the message of
[51:34] Divine Healing and he said yet he says
[51:37] I'm also very much criticized on another
[51:40] thing and that's for preaching Grace
[51:44] so when we think of that of the grace of
[51:46] God I I want you to understand that it's
[51:49] not just when we look at it with God's
[51:52] grace it's not like Joe remember when
[51:55] Jude starting out in the early church
[51:57] Jude was standing there and there was a
[52:00] call in that hour for the children of
[52:02] God to contend for the faith that was
[52:06] once delivered to the church and that
[52:09] that that faith that was delivered to
[52:11] the saints that Faith was God's own life
[52:14] the Holy Ghost so it was something that
[52:17] is something worth fighting for there's
[52:19] a lot of things that we can fight for
[52:21] draw lines for and everything else but
[52:23] always make sure what you're fighting
[52:25] for it's worth fighting for and there
[52:28] are some things that are not worth
[52:30] fighting for but there are other things
[52:33] that are worth fighting for I'm gonna
[52:35] just say it like this the things that
[52:37] are of Eternal value those are the
[52:39] things that are worth fighting for
[52:42] is that right it's not worth fighting
[52:45] you know to maintain your bitterness and
[52:47] your hold and and your position it's
[52:49] it's not worth it but it is worth
[52:51] fighting for Liberty it is worth it
[52:54] giving ourselves for the cause of Jesus
[52:57] Christ it is worth standing for this
[53:01] gospel that it might be proclaimed
[53:03] through our lives so I want to just say
[53:05] it's not like that of how that Jude when
[53:08] he said there were certain men who crept
[53:10] in unawares who were before of old
[53:13] ordained to this condemnation
[53:15] ungodly men turning the grace of our God
[53:20] into lasciviousness and denying the only
[53:23] Lord God in our Lord Jesus Christ so
[53:27] taking God's grace because Grace itself
[53:30] there is the real truth of uh real
[53:33] Divine truth of God's grace but these
[53:36] men crept in they were ungodly men to
[53:40] take a very precious truth and promise
[53:43] that God has given his church and would
[53:46] turn it into a play into something that
[53:48] would be so uh despised so defiled of
[53:53] where that would Proclaim Grace and we
[53:55] see that even now in this hour of you
[53:58] know things and misstatements that are
[54:00] made and you know God doesn't care and
[54:03] God loves you anyhow and you know my
[54:06] heart bleeds for that part of it because
[54:08] the reality is He does care
[54:12] God's not a hapless hopeless sloppy God
[54:17] he cares
[54:19] he cared enough to come and fulfill his
[54:23] word to the letter he didn't cut a
[54:25] corner even in the time where he was
[54:28] brought to a place of crucifixion he
[54:31] stayed with the word in order that
[54:34] Liberty might come to you and I
[54:37] Grace comes according to the truth of
[54:41] almighty God and I'm just saying in this
[54:44] way I don't really believe that the
[54:46] grace of God is something our natural
[54:48] mind can fully comprehend
[54:51] we undoubtedly every one of us have
[54:54] received Grace favor from someone for
[54:57] some reason maybe you've had it from a
[55:00] boss for something and you know giving
[55:01] you a time off you didn't even ask for
[55:04] maybe you've had it someone come and
[55:06] paid for your meal and you didn't ask
[55:08] for anybody to pay for your meal you've
[55:10] asked maybe there's been groceries
[55:12] that's been provided for you a bill
[55:14] that's been paid a repair of some sort
[55:16] in other words there is something that
[55:19] has taken place that there is nothing
[55:21] that you have done to require that or
[55:24] would Merit that but it was done for you
[55:27] you know you can try to argue with
[55:29] somebody and say no you don't have to do
[55:32] this you don't have to do that but when
[55:34] you're in a real situation of a real
[55:36] need you're just thankful that that bill
[55:39] has been paid you're just thankful that
[55:42] somebody paid gave you some groceries
[55:44] you see there's an element that of of
[55:47] Grace in that regard but you know yet
[55:49] the grace of God which is so much deeper
[55:52] is unfathomable to our human mind our
[55:56] finite mind it takes the spirit of God
[55:59] to reveal his grace for us and I believe
[56:03] with all my heart when we come back to
[56:05] the scripture where it says that he
[56:08] shall bring forth The Headstone thereof
[56:10] with shouting's crying Grace Grace unto
[56:13] it it speaks of a body that has come to
[56:17] completion but remember in order for The
[56:20] Headstone to come there had to come a
[56:23] Ministry that would also take us back
[56:25] down to the true foundation because in
[56:28] order to have victory in our life we've
[56:30] got to have a true foundation and that's
[56:33] what the grace does for you and I it
[56:35] reveals and brings us into the right
[56:38] foundation and that our life might be
[56:41] established in the grace of almighty God
[56:45] and so I believe this with all my heart
[56:47] that we are under the promised shout of
[56:50] Grace that has come in the shoutings of
[56:53] divine grace you know the Bible said in
[56:55] the time of the Rapture which were in
[56:57] that season that the Lord himself first
[56:59] Thessalonians 4 shall descend from
[57:01] heaven with the shout and the and the
[57:04] voice and and the Trump and we know we
[57:07] are in that promise of the shout of
[57:10] divine grace of God and then let me just
[57:13] say it when this scripture reads it says
[57:16] it is with shoutings crying Grace Grace
[57:20] unto him because within this shout there
[57:24] are shoutings of Grace it is the book of
[57:28] redemption that which has been taken and
[57:31] now it is God's thundering out it is God
[57:34] issuing out shoutings of Grace to where
[57:38] when we when I can look in the word and
[57:40] though we can see the wrong but yet
[57:43] there is Grace that is poured out Upon
[57:45] Our Lives for what to come and change to
[57:48] bring Liberty to bring Deliverance to
[57:51] our lives
[57:53] and the shoutings are God's grace to
[57:55] vindicate his word that you and I might
[57:58] believe and have faith in the Living God
[58:01] I tell you like this brother random
[58:03] would say it in the message of Grace he
[58:05] would say it like this he said we've got
[58:07] theologians today we've got doctors of
[58:10] divinity
[58:11] we've got great men all over the world
[58:13] that's smart intelligent and educated
[58:16] but it takes the simplicity
[58:19] of believing God
[58:22] to make his word speak out to show that
[58:24] Jesus Christ
[58:26] is the same yesterday today and forever
[58:29] it takes the Simplicity of believing God
[58:33] notice it says it takes a humble heart
[58:35] dedicated to God bring Jesus Christ in
[58:39] in unto present tense
[58:41] oh amen he says if it taken theology
[58:43] what would the Presbyterian or the
[58:46] Methodist or the Baptist or the Catholic
[58:48] and so forth we wouldn't have a chance
[58:50] us poor unlearned people
[58:53] but it doesn't take knowledge
[58:57] laughs
[58:59] I'll have just I was just sitting and I
[59:02] was just talking with um with a brother
[59:04] you know and um we were fellowshipping
[59:06] and uh you know and uh it's actually
[59:08] brother John Sanger and we sitting there
[59:10] and and you know the statement was made
[59:12] of how he said look how God would take
[59:15] you know that I didn't even have a
[59:16] seventh grade education and God would
[59:19] take that vessel and God would manifest
[59:21] himself through that vessel there are
[59:24] things that are spoken that science is
[59:26] just coming to understand there are
[59:29] things that are spoken that's not the
[59:31] intelligence and Mind of a man it can't
[59:35] be anything else then almighty God the
[59:38] Messiah made manifest right Among Us the
[59:41] Living God veiled once again in his
[59:44] people
[59:45] [Music]
[59:46] about that not having that what what
[59:49] chance would you have or I have if if it
[59:52] was a learned person
[59:54] you say brother Sammy you got a master's
[59:56] degree but I've sat in the room with
[59:57] people and I could get in there and
[59:59] though I might have a degree sometimes
[1:00:01] they're throwing around words I ain't
[1:00:03] never heard in my life
[1:00:04] it can literally intimidate you I've
[1:00:08] been there
[1:00:09] and I was saying and the only thing I
[1:00:10] can do is just pick up on how they're
[1:00:12] trying to use them and then I try to
[1:00:15] understand that must be what that means
[1:00:18] right are you hearing me it's not about
[1:00:20] how much how smart we are how
[1:00:23] intelligent we are it's about can you
[1:00:25] believe God's word
[1:00:28] can we humble ourselves to the word of
[1:00:31] God it doesn't take knowledge
[1:00:35] over the same I don't know that it don't
[1:00:37] take knowledge
[1:00:39] not by power or by might but by my
[1:00:42] spirit saith God Al unfold this mystery
[1:00:45] and he will cry to it who's it you and
[1:00:49] me Grace Grace with shoutings and
[1:00:53] cryings that's what the preaching of the
[1:00:55] word is that's what this message is
[1:00:58] crying out it's shoutings of Grace
[1:01:01] this message is not shoutings of
[1:01:04] condemnation
[1:01:06] it's shoutings of Grace are you hearing
[1:01:09] me now
[1:01:10] if you reject it it will be condemnation
[1:01:13] to you if you refuse to walk in it it
[1:01:17] will be condemnation to you but right
[1:01:20] now while there's blood on The Mercy
[1:01:22] Seat it is shoutings of Grace
[1:01:26] it is crying Grace
[1:01:30] forward
[1:01:32] glory be to God that's what it is today
[1:01:35] God's Amazing Grace to his people how he
[1:01:38] takes the illiterate the unlearned and
[1:01:41] shows that Jesus is the same when he
[1:01:44] came he never came to the great
[1:01:46] theologians neither did he go to Canvas
[1:01:48] as the high priest or they only
[1:01:50] condemned him but he took fishermen men
[1:01:53] who were poor and walked the common life
[1:01:56] and to there he revealed himself and
[1:01:59] said follow me I'll make you Fishers of
[1:02:02] Men to show that his grace still reached
[1:02:05] down even to the Jews to the Gentiles to
[1:02:08] call a people for his name in this last
[1:02:11] days as we've been through it Amazing
[1:02:13] Grace How Sweet the Sound
[1:02:16] now I want to say to you Grace stands
[1:02:19] for you
[1:02:23] when the fall in the beginning think of
[1:02:26] it now God had laid down for that first
[1:02:29] family that first couple
[1:02:31] there in the garden and he had told him
[1:02:35] you have to eat of this and not to eat
[1:02:38] of the tree of knowledge of Good and
[1:02:41] Evil for the day you eat thereof that
[1:02:43] day you shall die that was God's word
[1:02:46] and then we find that through deceit and
[1:02:50] subtility where Satan used a vessel and
[1:02:53] use the tool how that Eve she consented
[1:02:57] the woman consented through deception
[1:02:59] she comes back and Adam Adam himself not
[1:03:03] deceived but Adam the Bible said was in
[1:03:06] the transgression what was it that moved
[1:03:09] for Eve at that time it was Adam's love
[1:03:13] for her
[1:03:15] in the midst of her wrong in the midst
[1:03:18] of her failure it was Adam's love for
[1:03:21] her let me tell you that was a great
[1:03:23] portrayal of what was going what was
[1:03:25] going to take place what was in God's
[1:03:28] mind where you and I would stand in a
[1:03:30] place of wrong wrong as wrong could be
[1:03:33] but there is one who would stand on our
[1:03:36] behalf
[1:03:38] oh brother our life had wrinkles all
[1:03:41] over it sin stains and everything else
[1:03:43] we needed help okay
[1:03:47] we needed a savior we needed a redeemer
[1:03:51] we needed a Waymaker we needed one to
[1:03:54] come and help you and I
[1:03:58] and God came down in Genesis 3 14 and
[1:04:02] the Lord God said unto the serpent
[1:04:04] because thou has done this Thou Art
[1:04:07] cursed above all cattle and above every
[1:04:09] beast of the field upon thy belly shalt
[1:04:12] thou go and thou shalt eat dust all the
[1:04:15] days of thy life and I will put enmity
[1:04:18] between thee and the woman and between
[1:04:21] thy seed and her seed it shall bruise
[1:04:25] thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel
[1:04:30] and in verse 21 and up to Adam also and
[1:04:34] to his wife did the Lord God make coats
[1:04:38] of skins and clothe them
[1:04:40] that's why brother Branham could say
[1:04:42] grace is old Grace is as old as the
[1:04:46] world is
[1:04:47] yeah
[1:04:48] Hallelujah this Earth that we are
[1:04:51] setting on did not choose itself to be
[1:04:54] inhabited but God chose this Earth out
[1:04:58] of every other planetary planetary body
[1:05:01] that is out there and let me just tell
[1:05:03] you something his choosing did not all
[1:05:06] of a sudden make it a place that was
[1:05:09] habitable that was already reserved in
[1:05:12] the mind of God his presence unfolded
[1:05:16] the Earth to a place to where it would
[1:05:19] be happening inhabited by almighty God
[1:05:22] what is it that makes you an a habitable
[1:05:25] being it is not our works it's not our
[1:05:29] doings it's the Sovereign Grace of God
[1:05:32] brooding over our lives
[1:05:36] as the prophet could say it's not you
[1:05:38] receiving the Holy Ghost it's the faith
[1:05:40] of God coming in you and God receiving
[1:05:43] himself
[1:05:46] into his Temple
[1:05:49] God receiving himself
[1:05:53] Grace was first shown to the human race
[1:05:56] there on a dark morning Grace stepped in
[1:05:59] and provided a substitute death was
[1:06:03] required God had every right just step
[1:06:07] down at that moment and wipe them off
[1:06:09] the face of the Earth because they
[1:06:11] disobeyed his word
[1:06:16] but God's grace held
[1:06:19] God's grace didn't allow him to remain
[1:06:21] it's true that they they suffered me
[1:06:24] from uh because of that sickness
[1:06:27] centered in fear energy and all the
[1:06:30] other things entered in because of sin
[1:06:32] but God said I will make a way back and
[1:06:36] God took the skins of an innocent one a
[1:06:38] lamb and he gave that to them to cover
[1:06:41] their nakedness their guilt would be
[1:06:44] covered by the innocency
[1:06:47] of an innocent one
[1:06:49] what was God showing you and I that day
[1:06:53] was going to come through and by the
[1:06:55] real Lamb of God
[1:06:57] the True Entertainment the Lord Jesus
[1:07:00] Christ the innocent one that he would
[1:07:03] give his innocent life that that life
[1:07:06] inside of there might come back upon you
[1:07:09] and I and bring forth in our life
[1:07:11] innocency
[1:07:13] innocency
[1:07:15] how would it bring forth innocency
[1:07:17] because he comes to change our nature
[1:07:21] to where I desire to do only those
[1:07:24] things
[1:07:25] that please you Lord
[1:07:27] Isaiah 53 10. yet it pleased the Lord to
[1:07:31] bruise him he hath put him to grief when
[1:07:34] thou shalt make his soul an offering for
[1:07:38] sin he shall see his seed he shall
[1:07:41] prolong his days
[1:07:43] and the pleasure of the Lord
[1:07:45] shall prosper in his hand
[1:07:47] he shall see of the travail
[1:07:50] of his soul and shall be satisfied by
[1:07:55] his knowledge shall my righteous servant
[1:07:57] justify many for he shall bear
[1:08:01] their iniquity
[1:08:04] I see my name there
[1:08:09] not only is he my sin offering he's also
[1:08:13] the one that carried it away
[1:08:15] [Applause]
[1:08:18] therefore I will I divide him a portion
[1:08:21] with the great and he shall Devour the
[1:08:23] spoil with the strong Humanity dividing
[1:08:26] that with what has been conquered now
[1:08:28] what has been brought forth by Mighty
[1:08:30] conqueror him dividing his life Out
[1:08:33] Among his children
[1:08:34] because he hath poured out his soul unto
[1:08:38] death
[1:08:40] we speak of and it's true the new birth
[1:08:43] is a dying process
[1:08:46] he made a way that we could die to
[1:08:48] ourselves he made a way
[1:08:51] he made a way and he was numbered
[1:08:55] with the transgressors and he bear the
[1:08:58] sin of many and made intercession for
[1:09:01] the transgressors
[1:09:03] you say brother Samuel what did he see
[1:09:06] what did he see when he said in verse 10
[1:09:09] he shall see his seed and he shall
[1:09:12] prolong his days and the pleasure of the
[1:09:14] Lord shall prosper in his hand what did
[1:09:16] he see he saw me
[1:09:18] he saw you
[1:09:19] he saw your Liberty he saw your healing
[1:09:22] he saw your joy he saw your deliverance
[1:09:25] he saw it all through this one
[1:09:28] all-sufficient sacrifice
[1:09:34] Hallelujah you realize that that's
[1:09:37] what's even breaking forth and breaks
[1:09:39] forth upon our life that's what this
[1:09:41] message come to do this message come to
[1:09:43] clear away all the channels and thoughts
[1:09:45] and ideas of man that puts it as though
[1:09:48] that it's something of man's efforts and
[1:09:50] if I can only get to this but what does
[1:09:52] it do it removes all of the visions of
[1:09:55] man and it puts forth and opens up the
[1:09:58] Clear Vision into the holiest of holies
[1:10:00] that's what this Revelation does to
[1:10:03] where you can see your way back into a
[1:10:06] place a full relationship to God let me
[1:10:09] tell you the song where it says it shall
[1:10:12] be light in the evening time the path of
[1:10:15] Glory you shall surely find in the
[1:10:18] Waterway God's light today buried in the
[1:10:21] precious name of Jesus Christ young and
[1:10:24] old repent of all your sins and
[1:10:28] shall surely enter in I'm telling you
[1:10:31] the path of Glory has come to you and I
[1:10:34] we couldn't find a way but God came to
[1:10:39] you and I
[1:10:40] am what am I talking about the path of
[1:10:43] Glory
[1:10:46] it's what this evening lied he wanted a
[1:10:49] path to become part of a church or put
[1:10:51] your name on a book A book didn't die
[1:10:54] for you a church didn't die for you but
[1:10:57] God himself came down and paid the price
[1:11:02] that he might release his life back into
[1:11:05] you and I that's the real grace of God
[1:11:10] let's look how Paul writes it in Romans
[1:11:12] 5 6 for when we
[1:11:15] were yet without Strength In Due Time
[1:11:18] Christ died for Samuel
[1:11:21] [Music]
[1:11:23] be ungodly
[1:11:24] over the same I went through a message
[1:11:26] Church all my life let me read that
[1:11:28] again in due time Christ died for it be
[1:11:30] ungodly
[1:11:32] [Applause]
[1:11:35] oh yeah
[1:11:37] for scarcely for a righteous man will
[1:11:40] one die
[1:11:44] yet pure adventure for a good man
[1:11:46] someone even Dare To Die
[1:11:49] but God
[1:11:51] commendeth his love toward us in that
[1:11:54] way while we were yet
[1:11:57] somebody say it
[1:11:58] Christ died for us
[1:12:03] Worthy Worthy no no
[1:12:07] ungodly we were Sinners we were in no
[1:12:11] shape but he died for us
[1:12:14] yeah but what was the whole work about
[1:12:17] is he knew what laid beneath there he
[1:12:21] was making a way Grace was making a way
[1:12:24] that we could come forth in Victory
[1:12:28] because the ungodliness and all the sin
[1:12:32] and the attributes of sin is not who you
[1:12:35] were it's not who I was and Grace is
[1:12:40] making a way for you and I
[1:12:43] oh glory be to God
[1:12:46] verse 9 much more than being now
[1:12:49] justified by his blood we shall be safe
[1:12:52] from wrath through him for if when we
[1:12:56] were enemies woo
[1:12:58] we were reconciled to God by the death
[1:13:01] of his son much more being reconciled we
[1:13:05] shall be saved by his life
[1:13:09] you mean he ain't he didn't just die for
[1:13:11] me when I heard about it no as a matter
[1:13:14] of fact before the foundation of the
[1:13:16] world the Bible said the lamb was slain
[1:13:19] Hallelujah job there was a witness there
[1:13:23] when the Morning Star shouted for joy
[1:13:26] and and what were those morning Stars
[1:13:28] shouting about they were shouting about
[1:13:31] as the prophet tells us they were
[1:13:33] catching a glimpse of their salvation in
[1:13:36] the lamb when God would become flesh
[1:13:40] so the word itself is calling out
[1:13:43] shoutings of Grace so if the Believers
[1:13:46] receive those shoutings and become part
[1:13:49] of it then we become part of the shout
[1:13:53] and our life their shoutings of grace
[1:13:57] and mercy it's crying out Grace for our
[1:14:01] loved ones Grace for everyone you don't
[1:14:04] have to live in that same condition you
[1:14:07] don't have to be up and down and up and
[1:14:09] down there is Grace
[1:14:12] to live above that
[1:14:14] [Applause]
[1:14:18] and not only so
[1:14:20] but we also joy in God
[1:14:22] through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we
[1:14:25] have now received the atonement
[1:14:26] wherefore as by one man sin entered into
[1:14:31] the world and death by sin so death
[1:14:34] passed upon all men for that all have
[1:14:37] sinned for until the law sin was in the
[1:14:40] world but sin is not imputed when
[1:14:42] there's no law it'd be like example
[1:14:45] going up and down this road right here
[1:14:46] there's no speed limit signs and you're
[1:14:49] new to the area
[1:14:51] I know that excuse won't work but
[1:14:54] if there's no signs posted
[1:14:57] what do you do
[1:15:00] well I guess it's residential I guess
[1:15:02] you only go this fast and you go you
[1:15:04] don't know there's nothing can be
[1:15:06] imposed if there's no law
[1:15:08] but when there's a law a law is there to
[1:15:11] be imposed
[1:15:13] and the law itself sin was not imputed
[1:15:16] when there was no law
[1:15:18] but when the law had come in
[1:15:20] it shows sin
[1:15:24] nevertheless death ring from Adam to
[1:15:27] Moses even over them that had not sinned
[1:15:30] after the similitude of Adam's
[1:15:32] transgression who is the figure of him
[1:15:34] that was to come so there were those
[1:15:36] down through there could say I didn't do
[1:15:38] what Adam did
[1:15:40] right right I mean even the Pharisees
[1:15:42] said we've been out born in fornication
[1:15:45] right but there was still under that
[1:15:48] representation
[1:15:49] but not as the offense so also as the
[1:15:52] free gift for if through the offense of
[1:15:55] one many be dead much more the grace of
[1:15:58] God and the gift by Grace which is by
[1:16:00] one man Jesus Christ hath abounded unto
[1:16:05] many
[1:16:06] I'm glad it said many
[1:16:11] aren't you because my name's in many
[1:16:14] I'm one of those Minis
[1:16:16] men
[1:16:18] not as it was by one that sinned so is
[1:16:21] the gift for the Judgment was by one to
[1:16:23] condemnation but the free gift is of
[1:16:27] many offenses unto justification for If
[1:16:30] by one man's offense death reigned by
[1:16:33] one much more they which receive
[1:16:36] somebody say receive
[1:16:38] abundance of Grace and of the gift of
[1:16:41] righteousness shall reign in life by one
[1:16:44] Jesus Christ therefore as by the offense
[1:16:47] of one judgment Came Upon all men to
[1:16:50] condemnation even so by the
[1:16:52] righteousness of one the free gift came
[1:16:55] upon all men unto justification of life
[1:16:58] for as by one man's Disobedience many
[1:17:01] were made Sinners so by The Obedience of
[1:17:05] one shall many be made righteous
[1:17:09] moreover the law entered now here it is
[1:17:11] that the offense might abound in other
[1:17:14] words as the law comes in the only thing
[1:17:16] the law can say is guilty it only spells
[1:17:20] out guilty but where sin abounded
[1:17:25] Grace did much more abound that as Sin
[1:17:29] hath reigned unto death even so might
[1:17:32] grace Reign through righteousness unto
[1:17:36] eternal life by Jesus Christ Our Lord
[1:17:39] and the church said
[1:17:40] brother Graham said if it hadn't been
[1:17:42] for Grace where would we all be
[1:17:45] Sovereign Grace I want you to listen to
[1:17:47] this Sovereign Grace is from a sovereign
[1:17:50] One Sovereign Grace from a sovereign One
[1:17:53] Sovereign what can it do Sovereign can
[1:17:56] do what it wants to Sovereign Grace can
[1:18:00] only be given by one that's Sovereign
[1:18:02] and God is Sovereign so he can give
[1:18:05] Sovereign Grace therefore being
[1:18:07] Sovereign Grace don't have to ask nobody
[1:18:10] you don't have to it does what it wants
[1:18:14] to
[1:18:17] you don't have to ask can I do this or
[1:18:20] shall I do that can I must I will I
[1:18:23] doesn't do it it doesn't it does it
[1:18:26] itself
[1:18:27] I'm glad about that because if something
[1:18:29] if I would have been December had been
[1:18:31] some Askins about me some people would
[1:18:33] have said ain't no chance for that boy
[1:18:36] what do you mean ain't no chance wrong
[1:18:37] well you see you don't know that that
[1:18:38] boy tried to serve God he started out
[1:18:40] when he was 10 years old but he couldn't
[1:18:42] stay with him he was at a youth camp at
[1:18:44] 13 years old on an altar but he couldn't
[1:18:46] stay with it but what was it Grace was
[1:18:48] standing for me the whole entire time
[1:18:50] and I'm telling you right here this
[1:18:52] morning whether you realize it or not
[1:18:54] Grace has been standing for you the
[1:18:57] whole entire time
[1:18:59] through your ears outs ups and downs and
[1:19:02] through everything about it all right
[1:19:04] when you even have made up in your mind
[1:19:07] to accept the doubt that the enemy was
[1:19:10] trying to permeate your life with this
[1:19:12] must not be for me but you can't
[1:19:14] override the grace that's standing for
[1:19:17] you as a child of almighty God grace is
[1:19:21] standing not what you deserve not what I
[1:19:24] deserve but God provided His Amazing
[1:19:27] Grace
[1:19:28] Adam and Eve deserve to be wrote off
[1:19:30] they walked right over top of God's word
[1:19:33] but Grace
[1:19:35] stood
[1:19:40] God wanted to make sure we'd see the
[1:19:42] grace in this hour so he came from where
[1:19:45] he had been interceding
[1:19:48] and he's taken the book and what we're
[1:19:51] seeing is a lamb who's standing
[1:19:54] we're seeing a triumphant one he was
[1:19:56] seated in power and glory and now he's
[1:19:59] standing you know what it is he's in
[1:20:01] view of his children it's not a man's
[1:20:04] idea it's like when they were stoning
[1:20:06] Stephen and Stephen said he said I've
[1:20:09] looked up and I behold the son of man
[1:20:12] standing on the right hand what was it a
[1:20:15] standing the standing position was it's
[1:20:18] time to come home it's time to welcome
[1:20:20] home
[1:20:22] it was standing in the midst of that
[1:20:25] time of trouble in the midst of when the
[1:20:27] Rocks were getting ready to fly but
[1:20:29] there was one who was standing I'm
[1:20:31] telling you the Bible said Michael shall
[1:20:34] stand up for his people the lamb is
[1:20:36] standing for you and I in this hour what
[1:20:39] does that mean it's Christ in view in
[1:20:42] your life to where all you can see is
[1:20:45] Jesus Christ
[1:20:50] and if you can't see it from one another
[1:20:52] correctly
[1:20:53] then you're not seeing it for the depth
[1:20:55] that God wants you to see it for your
[1:20:56] own life
[1:20:58] because when you see it for your own
[1:20:59] life in the depth you need to see it it
[1:21:01] not only affects you change you delivers
[1:21:03] you feels you but it also it puts Grace
[1:21:06] in your heart for one another
[1:21:08] is that right
[1:21:09] I said God let me see that lamb standing
[1:21:11] [Applause]
[1:21:13] let me see that lamb standing Lord let
[1:21:16] me see it more and more just say how do
[1:21:17] I see it through the preaching of the
[1:21:19] word amen is the message of the hour
[1:21:21] it's ringing forth we are beholding a
[1:21:24] mighty conqueror a Victorious Swan a
[1:21:27] mighty God who is standing there who has
[1:21:29] wrecked the veil into
[1:21:31] [Applause]
[1:21:33] um
[1:21:33] Grace is Sovereign therefore he can save
[1:21:36] the vilest he can save the worst thank
[1:21:41] you Jesus he can save the impurist he
[1:21:44] can save the immoralist he can I don't
[1:21:47] know if that's a word but he can heal
[1:21:48] the sickest he can save a Wretch like Me
[1:21:52] he did what is it Grace William Branham
[1:21:55] a drunkard son that don't make any
[1:21:57] difference the grace of God save me me
[1:22:00] I'm a woman's daughter that was no good
[1:22:03] don't make any difference the grace of
[1:22:05] God saved you it's Sovereign has to ask
[1:22:09] nobody nothing
[1:22:11] right
[1:22:12] amen wondered Jesus would have talked to
[1:22:14] disciples about the woman who was coming
[1:22:16] to the well
[1:22:17] The Sovereign don't have to ask nobody
[1:22:19] nothing
[1:22:20] [Music]
[1:22:21] [Applause]
[1:22:24] oh preach with me now
[1:22:27] we can run deep on that
[1:22:31] but notice it's God's desire to have
[1:22:34] fellowship with you and I according to
[1:22:37] his word
[1:22:38] is that right so now when we talk about
[1:22:41] this Sovereign can do what he wants to
[1:22:43] do I want you to understand the Bible
[1:22:45] says that he have blotted out the
[1:22:48] handwriting of ordinances that was
[1:22:50] against us
[1:22:51] all of the evidence and everything that
[1:22:53] was against you and I it wasn't that he
[1:22:56] just tore it up but what he did he
[1:22:58] became our sacrifice
[1:23:01] because God wasn't just tearing up
[1:23:03] papers but God in the Lord Us in order
[1:23:06] for us to receive Grace there has got to
[1:23:08] be one that is that was able to stand
[1:23:11] there and take the justice of God that
[1:23:15] was due you and I and if we got God's
[1:23:18] justice we would get help
[1:23:21] is that right but we were there we were
[1:23:24] there we we died with him there at
[1:23:27] Calvary the prophet said he made me pay
[1:23:30] for my sins there
[1:23:33] yeah
[1:23:34] and when he got up on that Easter
[1:23:36] morning we got up with him
[1:23:38] [Music]
[1:23:38] [Applause]
[1:23:39] he made me pay for my sins so it wasn't
[1:23:42] just God giving me giving you and me
[1:23:44] something but there was Justice that had
[1:23:47] to be met and when there was nobody that
[1:23:49] could meet that Justice there wasn't a
[1:23:51] man in heaven or Earth there was no
[1:23:53] Prophet Sage or anybody that could meet
[1:23:56] that justice of what was required don't
[1:23:58] you understand in this hour there was no
[1:24:01] man that could meet what was needed but
[1:24:04] the lamb has stepped forward in this
[1:24:07] hour and says I am their perpetuation I
[1:24:12] their lamb for their blind eyes I am
[1:24:16] their way back home
[1:24:17] [Applause]
[1:24:19] I am your sacrifice
[1:24:22] I'm your way to Victory
[1:24:26] Hallelujah
[1:24:28] now look at this scripture in Psalms 103
[1:24:30] the Bible said bless the Lord O my soul
[1:24:33] and forget not all his benefits who
[1:24:37] forgiveth all thine iniquities
[1:24:39] who heal us all thy diseases who
[1:24:42] redeemeth thy life from destruction who
[1:24:45] promisy with loving kindness and Tender
[1:24:48] Mercies who satisfied thy mouth with
[1:24:50] good things so that thy youth is renewed
[1:24:53] like the eagles brother Brown said let
[1:24:55] me say this my sinner friend you may be
[1:24:57] here this morning a prostitute you might
[1:25:00] be here this morning a woman Chaser you
[1:25:02] might be here a drunkard or a gambler or
[1:25:05] a murderer you might be here as an
[1:25:07] impure husband or an impure wife you
[1:25:09] might be the vilest of Sinner and you
[1:25:12] say I'm past that stage of redemption no
[1:25:15] you're not or you wouldn't be at the
[1:25:18] church this morning
[1:25:19] [Applause]
[1:25:22] you need to take that and put that right
[1:25:25] back in the devil's face
[1:25:27] if there's a quote you want to put on
[1:25:29] your refrigerator put on your mirror so
[1:25:31] you stop looking at yourself and look at
[1:25:33] what the lamb has spoken
[1:25:36] you wouldn't be here
[1:25:38] oh I must be past that you never got
[1:25:40] that thought from God
[1:25:42] he said come unto me all you better
[1:25:44] Heaven lady the spirit and the bride say
[1:25:47] come
[1:25:49] oh I've done this I overstepped the word
[1:25:51] here but do you have a desire to serve
[1:25:54] God if you have a desire listen to me
[1:25:57] friends it's not condoning sin but
[1:26:00] you've got to come God's provided way
[1:26:02] and if you've got a desire it shows you
[1:26:06] haven't crossed the line
[1:26:08] okay
[1:26:10] oh I'm past the stage of redemption no
[1:26:13] you're not or you wouldn't be at church
[1:26:15] this morning Grace will make a way for
[1:26:20] you in this dark hour if you'll just
[1:26:23] accept it
[1:26:27] don't wrestle around like sometimes we
[1:26:29] do when somebody wants to pay our bill
[1:26:31] at dinner
[1:26:33] and hoping that they hold out a little
[1:26:35] longer than we say no you don't have to
[1:26:38] come on I'm right down your alley
[1:26:41] but to accept it
[1:26:43] you don't have to accept me simple word
[1:26:45] consent
[1:26:47] accept it Adam had to be willing to
[1:26:50] accept it and you've got to be willing
[1:26:51] to accept it let me tell you what it is
[1:26:53] it's the unmerited favor of God that's
[1:26:56] what Grace is
[1:26:58] Ephesians 2 8 4 by grace are ye saved
[1:27:01] through faith how could you have faith
[1:27:04] to even believe if God has not come and
[1:27:09] fulfilling his word and his presence
[1:27:11] sweeping as you hear the word being
[1:27:14] preached you know what that's doing
[1:27:15] that's the grace of God admitting to you
[1:27:19] and I that we might rise and believe in
[1:27:21] him that he's mine
[1:27:24] perpetuation
[1:27:26] he's my lamb
[1:27:30] he's my savior He's My Redeemer he's my
[1:27:36] deliverer that's what that's what it's
[1:27:38] doing and that not of yourselves it is
[1:27:41] the gift of God not of Works lest any
[1:27:44] man should boast oh
[1:27:46] Hallelujah his brother Brown said God
[1:27:49] brought Grace into our lives by his love
[1:27:52] for us
[1:27:54] now you know there's something grace
[1:27:55] can't do
[1:27:57] there is something that Grace can't do
[1:28:01] it we're in good thought right now
[1:28:04] really I know it's changed my life what
[1:28:07] can it do well here's something grace
[1:28:09] can't do here's what the prophet told us
[1:28:11] Grace cannot be bought
[1:28:14] [Music]
[1:28:17] Grace can't be sold
[1:28:20] it's Grace stay with me now it's by a
[1:28:23] sovereign one you can't bargain for it
[1:28:28] well I'll be this good you can't bargain
[1:28:30] for Grace
[1:28:33] you can say God I'll do so and so if
[1:28:36] you'll do so and so you can't do that
[1:28:38] God won't do it you can't pull nothing
[1:28:42] out of God God gives it to you by his
[1:28:46] grace
[1:28:48] so what are you saying quit working
[1:28:52] and accept it
[1:28:55] I know sometimes in them that we're
[1:28:57] trying to work out here but you're
[1:28:58] trying to work it up here in this little
[1:29:00] p matter up here you can't work it out
[1:29:02] up here it's by grace through faith are
[1:29:07] you safe do you believe that he came and
[1:29:11] he died for your sins do you believe
[1:29:13] that he rose again do you believe that
[1:29:16] he sent back the Holy Ghost and it's a
[1:29:18] holy ghost that's a nun to me to preach
[1:29:20] this word and call out Redemption to you
[1:29:23] this morning
[1:29:25] it's believe his word
[1:29:29] oh my
[1:29:31] God quit working and accept it notice
[1:29:33] brother random said you're saved by
[1:29:34] grace God does the calling God does the
[1:29:37] saving
[1:29:41] the next part you just follow
[1:29:44] the footsteps of God that's all
[1:29:47] God says repent
[1:29:51] be baptized and be baptized in the name
[1:29:54] of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[1:29:55] remission of your sins
[1:29:58] what are you doing you're following
[1:30:00] Grace thank you
[1:30:03] and just in case you don't know if you
[1:30:05] look in your rear view mirror you'll see
[1:30:07] mercy and Grace is following after you
[1:30:09] too
[1:30:10] [Applause]
[1:30:13] come on somebody
[1:30:15] oh you're saved by grace and God by
[1:30:17] Grace gives you the new eternal life and
[1:30:20] eternal life is the baptism of the Holy
[1:30:23] Ghost
[1:30:23] man would say it like this uh in another
[1:30:26] place and when they would see Jesus he
[1:30:28] said when Jesus died at Calvary he saved
[1:30:31] the whole world every human being ever
[1:30:33] would be on earth the sin question was
[1:30:35] settled once and for all when Jesus died
[1:30:38] but he will never you'll never be a
[1:30:41] beneficiary of this policy until you
[1:30:43] accept it there's nothing you can do to
[1:30:46] Merit it it's an unmerited thing that
[1:30:48] God has done for you and you just accept
[1:30:51] it by faith in the Simplicity of faith
[1:30:54] God has made it so we all could reach it
[1:30:58] rich or poor illiterate or educated we
[1:31:01] can all accept it because it's in the
[1:31:04] reach of all of us just by childlike
[1:31:07] Simplicity to believe that the finished
[1:31:10] work at Calvary included me
[1:31:13] I'm reading shoutings of Grace
[1:31:17] crimes of Grace no wonder Paul could
[1:31:21] write in Romans 5 1 therefore being
[1:31:23] justified by faith we have peace with
[1:31:25] God through our Lord Jesus Christ by
[1:31:27] whom also we have access by faith into
[1:31:32] this grace wherein we stand and rejoice
[1:31:35] in the hope of the glory of God
[1:31:39] do you realize that there's not even a
[1:31:43] chasm
[1:31:45] between you and God any longer
[1:31:51] see God span to you and I we couldn't
[1:31:54] reach him
[1:31:55] but God came to where you and I were at
[1:31:58] and then just say this God came to where
[1:32:00] I was at
[1:32:02] God came to where you were at
[1:32:04] the same if I can only get to this
[1:32:06] forget save your time you'll never get
[1:32:09] good enough all of your goodness now
[1:32:12] listen friends goodness does not mean
[1:32:14] that you're not yielding but yielding
[1:32:17] means you're accepting and you're
[1:32:19] accepting is so much greater than all of
[1:32:22] your works because when you will yield
[1:32:24] to the word then the word that's been
[1:32:26] spoken to energize faith will go to work
[1:32:30] in your life when you will just simply
[1:32:32] accept it but my condition what about
[1:32:35] your condition Grace has already made a
[1:32:38] way but I've got this right here that
[1:32:41] I've got to get straightened out what
[1:32:42] about that Grace itself will make a way
[1:32:45] to lead you because listen it's your own
[1:32:48] thinking that's got you in the mess in
[1:32:51] the first place it's following your own
[1:32:53] ways and your own doings but let the
[1:32:56] grace of God that desires to lead you
[1:32:59] fully let him lead you say Lord I'm
[1:33:02] tired of going my own way and taking my
[1:33:04] own way I'm tired of walking according
[1:33:07] to my own reasonings Lord I want to walk
[1:33:10] according to the grace of God
[1:33:15] so there's nothing between
[1:33:17] a Son of God a daughter of God and God
[1:33:20] anymore a chasm in that Chasm when that
[1:33:23] blood has been shed been repented of God
[1:33:26] and man become Father and Son there's no
[1:33:28] sin at all and he puts it in the sea of
[1:33:31] the bleach of forgetfulness and cannot
[1:33:33] even be remembered no more praise God
[1:33:36] but here's the problem
[1:33:37] we're human
[1:33:41] and we can still remember
[1:33:46] let me just tell you like this it
[1:33:48] wouldn't matter if you are
[1:33:50] the model so-called model message person
[1:33:56] and the righteous most vilest ungodly
[1:33:59] person is sitting beside you let me tell
[1:34:01] you what both of you need the grace of
[1:34:03] God
[1:34:06] that's what both of you need God's grace
[1:34:08] it isn't one needs oh they needed a
[1:34:10] whole lot more no we all need it because
[1:34:12] what God's grace come to do is to lead
[1:34:14] you and I to a death to ourselves to
[1:34:17] where you and I lose sight of our own
[1:34:19] selves and our own will and we get our
[1:34:22] eyes focused on Calvary we get our eyes
[1:34:24] focused on the lamb we need God's grace
[1:34:28] in our lives
[1:34:33] Hallelujah and this as it says in First
[1:34:36] Peter 5 12 if I can speak of the rest of
[1:34:39] the latter part of that verse this is
[1:34:41] the true grace of God wherein you stand
[1:34:48] you see God's grace hail think of this
[1:34:50] for the Wilderness I'm coming to my last
[1:34:51] Point here God's grace held for Israel
[1:34:55] in the wilderness think of it brother
[1:34:56] Jerry mentioned it when he was here I
[1:34:58] think even the first service about
[1:34:59] complaining
[1:35:02] their shoes didn't wear out their
[1:35:03] clothes didn't wear out
[1:35:05] they had food provided for him
[1:35:08] come on
[1:35:09] you you can't get no benefits like that
[1:35:12] 401K won't even pay you like that
[1:35:15] you can't get no benefits like that God
[1:35:17] provided all those things let me tell
[1:35:21] you something even through all of their
[1:35:22] complainings
[1:35:24] they're grumblings God could have easily
[1:35:27] said
[1:35:28] let's see where you get your close neck
[1:35:30] and your next set of clothes
[1:35:32] see where you get your next set of shoes
[1:35:33] from
[1:35:36] but he didn't you understand they didn't
[1:35:39] have to look far off to see God's grace
[1:35:41] it was right there right around him
[1:35:44] do you realize in your life in my life
[1:35:47] it's not something all brother Samuel oh
[1:35:49] I need to see something way out there
[1:35:50] for God's grace it's God's grace that
[1:35:52] you're here this morning it's God's
[1:35:54] grace that you've got to desire to serve
[1:35:56] God it ain't something far out right
[1:35:58] there it's right up next to you
[1:36:01] it's the Living God right personal
[1:36:04] dealing with your life
[1:36:07] leading you and I putting up with us
[1:36:10] bringing us along the way through all of
[1:36:13] our complainings
[1:36:15] oh I'd love to be able to say after that
[1:36:16] message that I had no more complaints
[1:36:18] boy the week that followed that message
[1:36:21] don't complain no more I think my
[1:36:23] complaint list went
[1:36:24] Lord I'm speaking for the rest of these
[1:36:26] angels in here too
[1:36:28] you know why you see it's fitting when
[1:36:30] the word comes forth like that we are
[1:36:32] going to be tried but I'll tell you one
[1:36:34] thing I found myself saying forgive me
[1:36:36] Lord a whole lot sooner for complaining
[1:36:39] right
[1:36:40] [Applause]
[1:36:42] [Laughter]
[1:36:45] amen but you see God's grace held for
[1:36:49] him
[1:36:50] before him
[1:36:51] even to bring them to a place to go and
[1:36:53] search out the land
[1:36:55] but they looked upon that land and said
[1:36:57] we can't do it we can't do it it's too
[1:37:00] great and so forth
[1:37:02] God's desire was to bring them fully
[1:37:06] into that place of full obedience to his
[1:37:09] word
[1:37:10] God brought it to the place
[1:37:12] of being tested by every word
[1:37:15] Abraham
[1:37:16] was brought to the place
[1:37:18] are being tested by every word of God
[1:37:21] even being tested by the word manifested
[1:37:26] in his life
[1:37:32] they were tested
[1:37:33] they never came to the full value of it
[1:37:36] but God rose up a people out of there
[1:37:39] what they said will never be able to do
[1:37:41] it God raised a people
[1:37:43] God brought a people
[1:37:46] and let me just say this to you in this
[1:37:48] hour where the church could never attain
[1:37:50] to it
[1:37:52] God in this hour by his grace
[1:37:54] brings a people to full obedience
[1:37:58] to the word of God
[1:38:02] that's God's grace
[1:38:04] to wear a people let me just say it in
[1:38:06] this way that'll simply believe God's
[1:38:08] word
[1:38:10] you know
[1:38:12] when it comes down to it let me
[1:38:14] I want I want to just hit this last
[1:38:16] Point here very quickly
[1:38:18] not only is God grace stand for us
[1:38:21] but God's grace holds us
[1:38:24] Abraham
[1:38:26] in his life
[1:38:29] I just have to skip over some scriptures
[1:38:30] but Abraham in his life
[1:38:33] he went down and he was told by God
[1:38:35] to stay in this land
[1:38:38] and Abraham left that land under
[1:38:40] pressure
[1:38:42] God could have said
[1:38:44] next please
[1:38:46] next
[1:38:48] he left the land he knew better
[1:38:52] but he left it
[1:38:54] right
[1:38:55] and he went down there and told a lie he
[1:38:57] knew better than that too
[1:39:00] right
[1:39:01] but you know it all come back around to
[1:39:04] where that you see that even through it
[1:39:07] he had to make that right
[1:39:10] and God spoke to him and said get back
[1:39:12] into the land
[1:39:13] you see that's the same grace of God
[1:39:15] that would speak to you and I when you
[1:39:18] and I would get out of line
[1:39:20] maybe you get out of line in your
[1:39:22] thinking your attitude maybe you get out
[1:39:25] of line in your prayer life your walk
[1:39:27] with God your fervency your dedication
[1:39:30] to God where God and himself could
[1:39:32] simply just out of things that's laid
[1:39:35] even in the word that we look at and we
[1:39:38] can become neglectful of it
[1:39:41] where it just starts out so so easily
[1:39:45] it's so innocently until eventually it's
[1:39:48] a problem
[1:39:50] it's a problem like oh my goodness how
[1:39:53] do we get out of this mess that we're in
[1:39:57] right but Grace itself
[1:39:59] holds for us
[1:40:01] now this is what Grace does what it did
[1:40:03] for Abraham I want you to notice this
[1:40:05] right here this grace of what it did for
[1:40:07] Abraham I don't have this on the screen
[1:40:08] I just want you to listen to it but when
[1:40:10] Abraham had said it's my sister and lied
[1:40:12] about it yet the grace of God held him
[1:40:15] because
[1:40:17] he repented
[1:40:20] he was willing to repent
[1:40:26] that's what matters
[1:40:29] Grace holds
[1:40:31] if we're willing to repent
[1:40:34] ance but if we're simply saying well I
[1:40:36] did this because so and so did that that
[1:40:39] ain't repentance that's called passing
[1:40:41] the buck
[1:40:42] but the grace of God will still hold for
[1:40:45] you and I
[1:40:47] I'm grateful for that
[1:40:49] God's grace will hold if we're willing
[1:40:53] to repent I'll tell you friends what a
[1:40:55] blessing it is to be willing to repent
[1:40:59] that's a blessing you know what that is
[1:41:02] you might say well brother Samuel God's
[1:41:04] Desiring to have a people that will be
[1:41:06] fully obedient to the word what do you
[1:41:08] think full obedience to the word of God
[1:41:10] is is it that every single time in every
[1:41:13] single area that I were always hitting
[1:41:15] the mark no it's even when we don't hit
[1:41:18] the mark that God comes and corrects us
[1:41:21] are we willing to repent
[1:41:25] that's what it is
[1:41:27] God's grace holds for you and I
[1:41:32] am
[1:41:34] let me just finish this quote and I'll
[1:41:36] stop here
[1:41:38] and anybody that's willing to repent
[1:41:41] paragraph 88 there the grace of God
[1:41:45] steal goes for you
[1:41:47] the grace of God is searching
[1:41:50] for you
[1:41:52] so that goes for you backsliders this
[1:41:54] morning the grace of God is still
[1:41:56] looking for you if you'll just repent
[1:41:59] God's grace
[1:42:01] is sufficient
[1:42:03] our goodness
[1:42:06] how precious
[1:42:07] did that Grace appear the hour I first
[1:42:10] believed
[1:42:11] I tell you his grace is not only amazing
[1:42:14] back there his grace is amazing right
[1:42:15] here this morning to me it's more
[1:42:17] amazing right here this morning than
[1:42:19] it's ever been
[1:42:21] this grace is so profound
[1:42:27] does it mean that he lets you and me get
[1:42:29] by with things no
[1:42:31] he corrects you and I
[1:42:34] he comes and lets us know when we're
[1:42:36] wrong that's part of Grace holding for
[1:42:40] you and I
[1:42:42] yeah let me just encourage you
[1:42:44] it matters what we do with it
[1:42:47] if you look at the grace of God that
[1:42:49] comes to you and just despite it listen
[1:42:54] That's A Dangerous Ground to be on
[1:42:57] but it's important when God's grace is
[1:42:59] dealing with the hardship that's what
[1:43:01] God is doing to bring us to a place of
[1:43:04] Liberty bring us to a place that even in
[1:43:07] our own lives to grow a little bit more
[1:43:09] listen friends you realize it's God's
[1:43:11] grace that would help you and I to
[1:43:12] really see ourselves for who we really
[1:43:14] are well I'm a son I'm a daughter of God
[1:43:16] I I agree with that but even we need
[1:43:19] God's grace because sometimes in our own
[1:43:21] lives we can have such a high opinion of
[1:43:25] our own selves
[1:43:28] I've got to go ahead and preach it as
[1:43:29] it's coming David had such a high
[1:43:32] opinion of his own self
[1:43:35] oh David himself here he was he seen
[1:43:38] this hear this woman she was taking a
[1:43:40] bath by the name of Bathsheba and he
[1:43:43] looked there he looked upon her desire
[1:43:45] to do you realize David broke multiple
[1:43:48] Commandments of God
[1:43:50] he lusted after another man's wife
[1:43:54] are you with me and he and he took her
[1:43:57] in adultery it was not her it was David
[1:44:01] she submitted to the word of the king
[1:44:04] are you hearing me he even encouraged
[1:44:07] her to lie go invite your husband bring
[1:44:09] him home with you and then you know
[1:44:11] because it'll cover up that which is
[1:44:13] done you see what it is within man
[1:44:14] always wanting to cover up always wanted
[1:44:17] to cover himself up because what is it
[1:44:20] since the fall it's man always wanting
[1:44:22] to justify himself and try to hide from
[1:44:26] God but God's Grace is trying to call
[1:44:29] man beyond his own means
[1:44:32] [Applause]
[1:44:34] because it only makes the stain bigger
[1:44:40] so he had your eye killed oh murder
[1:44:42] another commandment
[1:44:45] I don't know about you but I don't know
[1:44:46] how this boy still wrote in the Bible
[1:44:49] oh I know had to be the grace of God
[1:44:51] that's what I had to be
[1:44:56] now did David just get off scot-free no
[1:44:59] I don't know but he thought he had it
[1:45:01] all covered thought he had it all heated
[1:45:02] he had it all sewed up really good he
[1:45:05] had all the Pieces Just Right In Line
[1:45:07] exactly my hair your eyes dead and my
[1:45:10] everything's good you know bathsheba's
[1:45:11] in his house and he's got everything
[1:45:12] like brother Jerry brought it you know
[1:45:14] he want to make sure he got that in
[1:45:15] there so when she starts showing you
[1:45:16] know people aren't you know adding up
[1:45:18] the months and everything like that all
[1:45:20] of this he's trying to cover his own
[1:45:22] trail
[1:45:27] so then God sends Nathan the prophet
[1:45:31] Here Comes God's grace walking in shoe
[1:45:34] leather
[1:45:36] and God's grace comes to him and said
[1:45:39] Yes Man
[1:45:41] and then he took this sheet from a poor
[1:45:43] man and this poor man treated this sheep
[1:45:46] notice these terms of endearment as his
[1:45:49] own daughter
[1:45:51] fed her cared for her
[1:45:53] my David is getting all stirred up and
[1:45:57] he's ready to he's ready to pronounce
[1:45:59] judgment
[1:46:01] that's what should happen to that man
[1:46:03] that man must die
[1:46:07] brother Brown said that sounds like
[1:46:09] about us
[1:46:10] he said we're always ready quick to put
[1:46:12] judgment on somebody else when they've
[1:46:15] done wrong
[1:46:18] Church
[1:46:26] and I need God's Amazing Grace we need
[1:46:30] God's grace day by day by day you even
[1:46:33] need God's grace for people who get on
[1:46:35] your nerves
[1:46:36] [Applause]
[1:46:38] that you can have tolerance with one
[1:46:40] another
[1:46:41] come on Friends
[1:46:43] sometimes we take things and want to
[1:46:45] modify it quotified scripture fighting
[1:46:47] and everything else the truth of the
[1:46:48] matter is it's things pushing our
[1:46:51] buttons
[1:46:52] oh come on church but it's always within
[1:46:56] these things this Sovereign Grace of God
[1:46:58] stepping in for you and I
[1:47:01] am and David repented
[1:47:03] everyone nowhere else to go
[1:47:06] you want nowhere else to go but hear the
[1:47:08] grace of God stepped and said but David
[1:47:10] you're not going to die
[1:47:13] but this is what's going to happen the
[1:47:15] sword will never depart from your house
[1:47:18] now what if David at that moment would
[1:47:20] have said well that ain't Fair
[1:47:22] I made this I this happen you know I
[1:47:24] couldn't help but I I've got this less
[1:47:26] problem you know the way my passions are
[1:47:28] you know I'm a passionate man I couldn't
[1:47:30] help this but he accepted
[1:47:32] the grace of God David it means trouble
[1:47:35] it means certain things by decisions
[1:47:38] that you made but David said no matter
[1:47:41] those decisions that have been made
[1:47:43] Grace is saying I have made a way for
[1:47:46] you though there's trouble though the
[1:47:48] sword would have to be the same Grace
[1:47:51] that sounded out right now is the same
[1:47:53] Grace that'll make our way through every
[1:47:55] trouble
[1:48:00] I'll tell you
[1:48:01] it's Grace
[1:48:05] Moses
[1:48:07] he smote The Rock twice
[1:48:10] right
[1:48:11] see I'm saying I hope you understand
[1:48:13] Grace holding for us God's showing you
[1:48:16] and I it's not you or me holding on
[1:48:21] it's Grace
[1:48:23] even in these examples
[1:48:26] where Moses smote it twice
[1:48:30] and he should never have smote it twice
[1:48:33] god brother Brian says like this God
[1:48:36] should have killed him right there
[1:48:38] because he broke the scripture
[1:48:40] because Calvary the lamb only had to be
[1:48:43] smitten once the next time you speak to
[1:48:44] it
[1:48:45] but notice the grace of God remember
[1:48:48] when Moses said Lord let me go into the
[1:48:51] land let me lead him in there no I'm not
[1:48:53] going to let you do it but here in
[1:48:55] Matthew 17. we see when Jesus Takes
[1:48:59] Peter James and John under mount
[1:49:01] Transfiguration There Was Elijah and
[1:49:04] Moses talking to him I'm telling you how
[1:49:07] did Elijah God and Moses get there he
[1:49:10] got to the other side because of God's
[1:49:15] grace
[1:49:16] [Applause]
[1:49:18] and how are you going to get to the
[1:49:19] other side how am I going to get to the
[1:49:21] other side the same Rock that's right
[1:49:24] here the same Rock that's watering us
[1:49:26] the same Rock that's following us the
[1:49:29] same Rock that's leading us the same
[1:49:31] Rock one of these mornings will sweep
[1:49:33] down and we will stand there on the
[1:49:36] other side how did we get into this
[1:49:38] place of Liberty and victory because The
[1:49:41] Rock has brought us there God's grace
[1:49:44] and we accepted it Hallelujah
[1:49:49] listen friends the greatest thing you
[1:49:50] can do is to accept it
[1:49:56] it was a boy that was going to die by a
[1:49:57] firing squad
[1:50:00] he had deserted he had run away from his
[1:50:03] unit he deserved to die
[1:50:07] but he had a friend that went
[1:50:10] Abraham Lincoln said Mr President I know
[1:50:13] this boy he didn't mean to do this and
[1:50:15] so forth
[1:50:16] he wrote it on a piece of paper
[1:50:19] pardoned Abraham Lincoln
[1:50:22] he took that piece of paper
[1:50:24] to that Soulja Boy that had ran and
[1:50:26] deserted in a Time
[1:50:30] he said don't do that you're mocking me
[1:50:33] you're only mocking
[1:50:35] get out of here
[1:50:37] within so much time
[1:50:39] he was killed by the firing squad
[1:50:42] question of Rose how could this man have
[1:50:44] been killed
[1:50:46] there was a pardon that was given
[1:50:48] from the president
[1:50:51] then they decided and came to the
[1:50:53] decision a pardon
[1:50:56] is only a pardon
[1:50:58] if it's accepted yeah as a pardon
[1:51:04] and I'm going to say this to you right
[1:51:05] here this morning
[1:51:07] it's God's pardoning grace
[1:51:09] for you this morning
[1:51:12] God's pardon and Grace for you and for
[1:51:15] me
[1:51:16] it's a place an opportunity to accept
[1:51:19] that Grace
[1:51:21] to wear if there's things that you can
[1:51:23] you as a spirit of God deals with your
[1:51:24] life calling you out of a life of sin
[1:51:27] the spirit of God calling you from
[1:51:29] backslidings and wanderings and to where
[1:51:32] that you look and you say how did I get
[1:51:34] off like this my life at one time I was
[1:51:37] very fervent with God and how did I get
[1:51:39] to this place to where let me just tell
[1:51:41] you something you could look at that and
[1:51:43] try to figure that out a month to
[1:51:44] Sundays but it only started little by
[1:51:46] little but let me just tell you
[1:51:48] something right now the way to get back
[1:51:49] is little by little is to have just that
[1:51:52] faith that God is wanting to admit to
[1:51:55] your heart to say Lord forgive me
[1:51:59] for the heir of my ways forgive me Lord
[1:52:03] when I've placed other things ahead of
[1:52:06] you maybe you've complained maybe you've
[1:52:09] been waiting on your healing maybe
[1:52:11] you've been longing for your deliverance
[1:52:13] maybe that be setting sin in that way
[1:52:15] that's just loading you down but let me
[1:52:17] tell you there is sufficient Grace here
[1:52:19] this morning to take care of every
[1:52:22] problem there's sufficient Grace to deal
[1:52:25] with every doubt and every unbelieving
[1:52:27] Spirit what must I do brother Samuel
[1:52:30] believe and accept what he has done for
[1:52:35] you
[1:52:36] and let me tell you this and then you
[1:52:39] confess what he's done for you
[1:52:42] and don't ever let your confession be
[1:52:44] something different
[1:52:46] well I don't feel like a good Christian
[1:52:48] that's what the devil wants you to say
[1:52:51] but if you confess and you watch it
[1:52:54] works salvation
[1:52:56] if there's something that's out of line
[1:52:58] listen the Holy Ghost can call things
[1:53:00] out one by one by one by one but when
[1:53:02] his presence come he's the same one that
[1:53:04] was there in Africa where those women
[1:53:06] they didn't know that they were wrong in
[1:53:08] the way that they did not have any
[1:53:09] clothing on top but the spirit of God
[1:53:11] came by and it brought conviction in
[1:53:13] their life let me tell you what it is
[1:53:15] it's God's grace that's leading you and
[1:53:17] I in the way of repentance it's God's
[1:53:19] grace that's leading you and I to lying
[1:53:22] with his word that is the grace of
[1:53:25] almighty God and now it comes upon you
