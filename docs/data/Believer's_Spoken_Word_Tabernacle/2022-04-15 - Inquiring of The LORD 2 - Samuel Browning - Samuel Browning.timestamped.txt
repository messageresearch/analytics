[32:16] foreign
[32:20] [Music]
[32:42] we don't take that for granted
[32:44] [Music]
[32:45] it's just a real
[32:47] it's a real privilege to be able to
[32:49] gather together
[32:50] brothers and sisters of like Precious
[32:52] faith
[32:54] there's times that truly is just like a
[32:56] midweek service or other times that
[32:59] may not feel like it
[33:01] as times our flesh gets weak
[33:04] this is where we we have to press
[33:06] through
[33:08] obviously I know that there are times
[33:10] where there's different ones Among Us
[33:11] that
[33:12] they'd be here if they could be here
[33:16] and I don't mean they're not trying to
[33:17] single anybody out you understand what
[33:19] I'm saying it's just so that we we look
[33:21] at it in a manner that you know
[33:25] it's a real privilege to come together
[33:28] it's just something special about it you
[33:30] know I I'll be honest you know
[33:33] when we look at how special it is God
[33:35] never meant for any of us
[33:37] to be on an island to ourselves
[33:42] you know it's true
[33:44] it's an individual walk with God that's
[33:46] absolutely the truth
[33:48] it's a person identification we can go
[33:50] through the quotes and scriptures but
[33:52] God has said it
[33:54] that we are a body
[33:57] and we need one another
[33:59] and it's something special where the
[34:01] spirit of God just begins to move right
[34:04] here Among Us
[34:06] I'll tell you this right here I need the
[34:08] body of Jesus Christ
[34:10] I need my brothers and sisters I need
[34:13] one another I don't it's not necessarily
[34:15] that well I need to I need to hear
[34:17] somebody say this or something I need my
[34:20] brothers and my sisters
[34:22] if there's ever a time in an hour that
[34:24] we're living in we recognize that it's
[34:27] more precious to us right now
[34:30] than any other time
[34:32] amen this is a time where we're we're
[34:35] getting together we're getting ready to
[34:36] go home
[34:37] it's very precious the love of God in
[34:40] our hearts amen for one another to
[34:42] recognize the Living God right here
[34:44] Among Us what God is doing
[34:47] and it's just something very very
[34:49] precious that the Lord would allow us to
[34:52] be able to come together as a body be
[34:54] able to pray for the needs of one
[34:55] another
[34:57] you know of everything that we want to
[34:59] do and say and I I don't I'm not trying
[35:02] to take a time of just just giving words
[35:04] as it would come to me but let us not be
[35:07] so occupied with our own selves
[35:10] that we fail to look on the needs of
[35:13] others
[35:15] because that's the character of Christ
[35:16] that's the mind of Christ as Paul said
[35:18] in Philippians 2 look ye every man on
[35:21] one another
[35:23] needs
[35:25] this is an age it's it's things that's
[35:27] all around us not just the spirit of the
[35:30] age but even the pressures of the age
[35:31] sometimes
[35:33] and so move around us to where we're
[35:35] looking at our own needs
[35:38] we're praying just exclusively about our
[35:41] own needs
[35:42] but I can tell you this right now as a
[35:44] witness and I know there's others here
[35:46] tonight as well that when you begin to
[35:48] move Beyond just your own needs and just
[35:51] begin to pray and say you know I'm going
[35:53] to set that aside God already knows that
[35:56] I've asked about that but there's some
[35:58] needs right here there's other burdens
[36:00] that strike in my heart and you begin to
[36:02] pray for that you'll find a release for
[36:05] what you have need of in your life
[36:09] God has so said it that we're a body of
[36:12] believers
[36:13] that's why that even as we come to the
[36:15] house of God you know it's it's
[36:17] wonderful to come here and to set with
[36:19] one another
[36:20] maybe this is just a little bit don't
[36:22] mean to be touchy but just as it comes
[36:24] to me that God never intended for us
[36:26] just to come and set here but it's also
[36:30] to greet one another
[36:32] and I know some things you know come up
[36:34] but you know not just to rush right out
[36:37] after a service not just to run away but
[36:39] it's just to even shake hands or to
[36:41] greet somebody you know and say God
[36:43] bless you in the name of the Lord God
[36:45] bless you brother so and so God bless
[36:47] you Sister it's so good to see you
[36:50] it's just it's very it's very very
[36:52] important
[36:53] amen we're a body of believers
[36:56] you know you don't realize what
[36:58] sometimes well I think you do what that
[37:00] means when someone could just express
[37:02] that to you and they've gone out of
[37:04] their way
[37:05] to say God bless you amen we we are a
[37:08] body of believers
[37:10] man it's wonderful to be a part of the
[37:11] body of Jesus Christ
[37:13] I want to just say my just such a
[37:17] wonderful day we had on Sunday
[37:20] just a wonderful service
[37:22] and uh
[37:24] you know brother Carmen as I spoke to
[37:26] him we had to go quickly
[37:28] to the airport
[37:30] as soon as he got to the airport ran
[37:32] into things once again they were go here
[37:34] go there and there was all sorts of
[37:36] things that we just began to pray I said
[37:39] God you used your servant in a mighty
[37:41] way today
[37:42] Lord make a way for him Lord
[37:45] make a way for me he had to go on to
[37:47] Denver and we just are thankful God made
[37:50] a way for him
[37:52] one thing that brother Carmen he just
[37:54] continued also to say he was rejoicing
[37:57] you know and to see what God had done as
[37:58] well
[37:59] but you know
[38:02] he just kept on saying he said I felt no
[38:05] no drawback while the word was being
[38:08] delivered
[38:09] and I'll tell you what that's that's
[38:10] tremendous
[38:12] that's that's God at work within our
[38:15] lives and that's what we want to be
[38:17] we've not come here to be seen when we
[38:19] come to the house of God we've not come
[38:21] here to be seen we don't want to know
[38:22] how good we are
[38:24] we want to know
[38:26] where is our shortcomings
[38:28] the brand said that's what the preaching
[38:31] of the word is is to catch
[38:33] from where we are to where we ought to
[38:36] be
[38:37] because the word works the word moves
[38:39] the word performs sometimes those
[38:43] channels we've got to look into those
[38:44] channels and say God
[38:47] what's moving here in these channels
[38:49] where is this at and I'm glad that God
[38:51] is mindful of every single need may we
[38:55] always May our hearts always be in that
[38:57] place when we come to the house of God
[38:59] lord I want to hear I want to know what
[39:02] it is that you've got to say to me Lord
[39:05] because I want to be a better Christian
[39:06] when I walk out of there
[39:08] I don't want to be filled with with
[39:10] knowledge I don't want to be filled with
[39:12] with intellect I don't want to be filled
[39:14] with no I want to be filled and full of
[39:17] the Holy Ghost I want every channel to
[39:20] be open if there's something in the way
[39:23] then we want to pull down that
[39:25] stronghold
[39:26] we're trusting that the spirit of God
[39:28] will move right down into our lives and
[39:31] move in such a way
[39:34] that's with every service God searched
[39:36] Me Lord let the word just search me out
[39:39] let it just let it move through my life
[39:43] and when things come that way within a
[39:45] service
[39:46] you know sometimes the enemy after you
[39:49] you know you get out and Monday comes
[39:51] along sometimes it's not even until
[39:53] Monday but remember what brother Branham
[39:54] said
[39:56] he said just as much as Elijah got done
[39:58] and out from under that anointing and
[40:00] when the mind of Christ pulled back from
[40:02] him he ran
[40:06] he said this Satan will come and try to
[40:08] knock the confidence that God has
[40:10] instilled in you
[40:12] on a Monday morning
[40:14] see God's instilled that confidence in
[40:17] you
[40:18] and this is where you stand and you
[40:21] continue to pray and look to God and you
[40:24] make your confession and you stand on it
[40:26] whether in your seat or up here wherever
[40:28] it's at you stand upon that word don't
[40:30] back down from it one bit but you keep
[40:32] praying
[40:33] and you keep looking to God and you
[40:36] claim
[40:37] your deliverance
[40:40] because God is faithful
[40:43] amen
[40:45] is a faithful God
[40:48] and I just I believe that with all my
[40:50] heart I
[40:51] I'm a witness There Is Power
[40:54] there's power in prayer
[40:57] power and prayer
[40:59] prayer amen may God just just continue
[41:02] to direct us in that
[41:04] I want to
[41:07] just remind you brother Jerry will be
[41:09] here ministering for us this coming
[41:10] Sunday
[41:12] we want to remember him in prayer even
[41:13] as he's traveling up here
[41:16] and also remember myself I will be in
[41:21] Virginia this weekend Services there
[41:25] and just the Lord will just have his way
[41:29] Among Us so if you would just remember
[41:32] those Services as well and God will just
[41:37] move in a very very special way not only
[41:39] there but here also I know that the camp
[41:42] in Louisiana the youth is going on right
[41:44] now we want to continue to remember that
[41:46] in prayer God will just meet free with
[41:50] each and every every need that's
[41:52] gathered there
[41:54] a lot of pressures upon young people in
[41:57] this generation that God still
[41:59] the same God
[42:01] it's still the answer for every
[42:02] situation and every need
[42:05] amen
[42:06] let's just let's go to him in a word of
[42:08] prayer before we open to the word if
[42:11] you'd like to just stand just for a few
[42:13] moments
[42:16] whatever maybe a knee that's on your
[42:18] heart just let it be known before the
[42:20] Lord
[42:23] Heavenly Father
[42:26] Lord we're mindful Lord this evening
[42:28] then
[42:30] we're not alone
[42:32] you said Lord of two or three agree
[42:36] it's touching any one thing it shall be
[42:38] done
[42:39] that those two or three Lord
[42:42] be gathered in your name you would be
[42:44] right in our midst
[42:46] and Lord there's no greater Delight of
[42:50] our heart
[42:51] and Lord that you would walk
[42:54] right here in our midst this evening
[42:57] and Lord is a people and myself
[43:00] we reserve ourselves to you
[43:04] we've not come Lord tonight to be seen
[43:08] we come Lord
[43:10] present Our Lives to you as vessels
[43:15] God that you might minister to our
[43:17] hearts speak to every need that's
[43:20] gathered here
[43:21] Lord those that are streaming by way of
[43:24] the internet or will listen to it Lord
[43:26] will you just minister to the needs
[43:29] of your people
[43:31] whatever that is Lord that's behind that
[43:34] hand that request upon that heart
[43:36] even things that Lord that we may not
[43:39] even be aware of
[43:42] will you just come Lord
[43:44] because just a few words from you
[43:47] is all that we have made
[43:49] we ask it now Lord in the name of Jesus
[43:52] Christ
[43:53] amen
[43:57] God bless you let's turn to Joshua
[43:59] chapter 1.
[44:05] Joshua chapter 1.
[44:18] sure is nice coming to church and Son's
[44:20] still out in it
[44:23] people little little things like that
[44:24] just
[44:26] really turned me around
[44:28] I just really enjoy that
[44:31] I don't know I'm sure many of you can
[44:32] testify I don't like when it gets dark
[44:35] at 4 30.
[44:37] feel like I've got a lot more to do in
[44:39] the day and it's dark at 4 30. but I'm
[44:42] glad when that gray sky starts breaking
[44:44] and all that Gloom and all that and the
[44:46] light just keeps pushing in and pushing
[44:47] in and pushing in
[44:49] amen
[44:51] well let's look here in Joshua chapter 1
[44:53] and verse 1.
[44:56] now after the death of Moses the servant
[44:58] of the Lord it came to pass that the
[45:00] Lord spake unto Joshua
[45:03] the son of nun Moses Minister saying
[45:06] Moses my servant is dead
[45:09] now therefore arise and go over this
[45:12] Jordan thou
[45:13] and all this people
[45:15] unto the land which I do give to them
[45:19] even to the children of Israel
[45:22] every place that the soul of your foot
[45:25] shall tread upon
[45:27] that I have I given unto you
[45:31] I said unto Moses from the Wilderness
[45:34] and this Lebanon even unto the Great
[45:36] River the river Euphrates and all the
[45:39] land of the Hittites and unto the great
[45:41] sea toward the going down of the sun
[45:44] shall be your Coast
[45:48] so there's no promise
[45:50] that is exempt but every promise in
[45:55] every word belongs to you and me as a
[46:01] believer
[46:02] if God has said it
[46:04] he's already obligated himself to it
[46:09] he's not a man that he should lie he
[46:11] won't go back on his word he's going to
[46:12] have to repent and say you know I didn't
[46:15] foresee certain things coming up no
[46:17] God made a promise and God keeps
[46:23] every promise
[46:26] here's verse 5 and we'll let you be
[46:28] seated
[46:29] there shall not any man
[46:32] be able to stand before thee all the
[46:36] days of thy life
[46:38] as I was with Moses
[46:41] so I will be with thee I will not fail
[46:45] thee
[46:47] nor forsake thee
[46:50] what a promise
[46:53] I cannot fail I'll I'll not just I'm not
[46:56] I can't fail go back on any promise and
[46:59] I'll not desert you
[47:03] oh oh glory be to God may God bless the
[47:07] reading of the word as you're being
[47:08] seated
[47:09] I just want to speak just a few moments
[47:11] here
[47:12] as we were talking about inquiring
[47:15] of the Lord
[47:17] we begin to look at that thought
[47:20] last week and I want to
[47:23] move into that here just a little bit
[47:25] more and looking into the Book of Joshua
[47:28] here
[47:29] because you recognize that not only is
[47:31] Joshua a type of the Holy Ghost the
[47:35] comforter the spirit of Truth
[47:37] it also has a type as we see as
[47:40] Believers of the end time messenger
[47:43] and it also holds the type of every
[47:46] Spirit-filled believer
[47:48] brother Branham would call to the
[47:51] believer the spiritual Joshua's
[47:55] and when we recognize as we look in here
[47:58] into the word that we will find as we
[48:01] find in in every part of it that God
[48:03] would would direct us as his children in
[48:07] everything that would be done in the
[48:10] land every battle that would be won
[48:12] would be because that they have sought
[48:15] the counsel and the leadership of
[48:18] almighty God
[48:19] it wasn't a question whether they could
[48:22] win
[48:23] but the question was how
[48:27] what approach do you want us to take not
[48:29] if we're going to win we're already
[48:32] promised victory
[48:35] that's a different way when you come in
[48:37] when coming into the land it's not if we
[48:41] will succeed or is there victory victory
[48:45] is certain
[48:48] but it's following the Lord
[48:50] every step of the way
[48:53] now notice here in verse 6 and these
[48:56] scriptures here not only tonight but in
[48:58] the other times we'll have a lot to to
[49:00] do with some things but verse 6 notice
[49:03] how God would admonish them Joshua
[49:06] because it's one thing to speak to a
[49:08] person and to let them know as I was
[49:11] with Moses so will I be with thee I
[49:13] won't fail you I won't forsake you but
[49:16] now God is speaking now directly to this
[49:20] promise this assurance and now how that
[49:23] a spiritual Joshua is to take their
[49:26] lives be strong and of a good courage
[49:29] For unto this people shall thou divide
[49:32] for an inheritance the land which I
[49:35] swear unto their fathers to give them
[49:37] only be thou strong and very courageous
[49:42] that thou mayest observe to do according
[49:46] to all the laws which Moses my servant
[49:50] commanded thee turn not from it to the
[49:53] right hand or to the left
[49:56] that thou mayest Prosper whether so ever
[49:59] thou goest
[50:02] so Victory is certain but it's victory
[50:06] through and by the word
[50:09] so to take heed to it to observe it to
[50:12] to observe it means to be very to look
[50:15] very carefully look into it and take
[50:19] heed from it don't don't turn from it
[50:21] but face it head on look at the word
[50:25] have the word before you because with
[50:28] that then you your way shall prosper
[50:32] wherever you go notice wherever thou
[50:34] goest so wherever God will lead us we
[50:39] can have a confidence he's leading us
[50:41] not out of the word but he'll always
[50:44] lead us into the word so it'll never be
[50:48] anything that we have to try to stretch
[50:50] and find things like puzzle pieces
[50:52] beating them in place and you know
[50:54] somehow try to vindicate that this is
[50:56] God's will no if we will observe the
[51:00] word in the word is the spirit of God
[51:04] who gave it that he will come forth and
[51:07] guide us and when that leadership comes
[51:10] from just written word to where the word
[51:13] itself now inspired to our lives and we
[51:16] become inspired then we Prosper whether
[51:20] so ever we go in other words our lives
[51:23] are filled with the wisdom of God and
[51:25] what is the wisdom of God it's the Holy
[51:28] Ghost
[51:28] so it's the spirit of God that is
[51:31] leading us and that's what God has given
[51:34] to the Church of the Living God to lead
[51:37] us we were not to be led by our natural
[51:40] senses a lot of things can seem
[51:42] reasonable to us God's letting Joshua
[51:45] know there's going to be a lot of things
[51:47] that don't make sense to the Natural
[51:49] mind
[51:50] but if you will just give yourself to
[51:53] the word the word has within it all that
[51:57] you have need of and that giving
[52:00] ourselves to it let's just step back a
[52:02] moment what would that mean to give
[52:04] ourselves to it it means as we are
[52:07] taking in of the word praying about the
[52:10] word if we can cut in on on Joshua how
[52:13] many times that Joshua would pray and
[52:15] we'll see this in the oncoming times
[52:17] that Joshua would look to the word of
[52:20] God know the promise of God is certain
[52:22] but he's asking God what is your
[52:25] direction into this situation how are we
[52:29] going to take this city so God so Joshua
[52:33] he's looking to God and knowing if I can
[52:36] just give myself to the word then the
[52:39] word has the answer God will speak to my
[52:42] heart he'll come right through that word
[52:43] that then where he leads me no matter if
[52:46] it makes sense to me or not I'm going to
[52:49] be able to stand and my way will be
[52:52] prosperous I I will actually be able to
[52:55] walk in discernment or this word also
[52:57] means to have insight or have that of a
[53:02] discernment regarding the situation
[53:05] and there's no way that we can have
[53:07] discernment without feeding on the word
[53:10] of God
[53:11] when we feed on the word of God the
[53:13] Bible says that you know strong meat
[53:16] belonging to them that are full age
[53:18] whose exercise whose senses are
[53:20] exercised to discern good from Evil how
[53:23] many times that Joshua with no doubt
[53:26] looking into the word would pray over
[53:28] that word and praying over that word and
[53:30] God will move and direct that spiritual
[53:33] Joshua for the need and what he's facing
[53:36] and what he sees before him
[53:39] now look look here in in verse 8 it says
[53:42] this book of the law shall not depart
[53:45] out of thy mouth that's a big statement
[53:47] there
[53:48] because knowing that this we recognize
[53:51] that the Bible itself is a book of
[53:54] Prophecy
[53:55] this was only speaking to what would
[53:58] come because this book of Joshua it
[54:01] actually speaks of the Spirit-filled
[54:04] believer who is in position in Christ in
[54:08] the Holy Ghost in the word that as a
[54:11] spiritual Joshua as he would say this
[54:14] book of the law shall not depart out of
[54:17] thy mouth and brother Branham would say
[54:19] it in this way regarding thy mouth he
[54:22] said what you're saying he said just
[54:25] don't read it and walk away but speak it
[54:28] live it and teach it
[54:32] so it's it's an all so the word is not
[54:35] just something that we are passing by we
[54:38] are hearing but the word is that which
[54:41] we are taking in and we are living by
[54:44] that word we are speaking that word and
[54:46] we are teaching that word so and the
[54:49] teaching is not and doesn't have to be
[54:51] you understand not limited to a preacher
[54:53] or a teacher but remember the spirit of
[54:56] God through our lives is an actual
[54:58] witness even in a testimony for how that
[55:02] we would take the word and speak the
[55:04] word now remember when Moses he spoke
[55:06] the word before he ever saw one movement
[55:09] before he ever felt one little bit of
[55:13] wind blow God told him to face the
[55:16] opposition and speak and go forward
[55:20] and there's things that as we speak
[55:22] speak is where we're taking that the
[55:24] word of God and acting on it by faith
[55:27] how many know that the word of God says
[55:29] that he is the high priest of our
[55:31] confession and to know that how Paul
[55:33] would write of that to the spiritual
[55:35] joshuas and and God would have his
[55:38] prophet in this hour and he would say
[55:40] you know he said right now what you
[55:42] might be in a position where you can
[55:45] take it and confess it and he said it
[55:47] might be that that has not dropped all
[55:50] the way down here he said but take that
[55:52] and you keep confessing it until you
[55:56] really do believe it because you know
[55:59] this is a word that a man never spoke if
[56:03] a man spoke this word then you're I
[56:05] could doubt it we could question it but
[56:08] when we know that this is God's word and
[56:10] God has spoken it it won't be a man
[56:13] fulfilleth it'll be God fulfilling his
[56:16] word and if we can just get into that
[56:18] place of the word and go ahead and speak
[56:21] what the word is saying concerning us
[56:23] then he as our high priest can begin to
[56:26] act upon what we are saying in that time
[56:30] oh my I think that's a very powerful
[56:33] reality of where in our life because
[56:35] let's be honest friends there's a lot of
[56:37] things that comes out of our mouth I'm
[56:39] not talking about cussing God delivered
[56:41] us of those things and took that out but
[56:43] you realize when you talk negative
[56:45] brother random said you're talking the
[56:47] devil's language
[56:49] and there's all we are in compass listen
[56:52] with two Realms of our life that are
[56:55] susceptible to negativity because two
[56:58] Realms of us that's all it can see that
[57:01] what we can hear within the Physical
[57:03] Realm and then what we can then move
[57:05] into that spiritual or that that of the
[57:08] mind and we can reason an imagination
[57:10] but there's another realm that's far
[57:13] greater than those other Realms and too
[57:16] many times we live beneath our
[57:18] privileges and we start living out here
[57:21] in these other Realms but we can never
[57:23] be successful we can never make our way
[57:27] prosperous if we live in the other realm
[57:30] but we must live in the realm of faith
[57:33] and I believe their spiritual joshuas
[57:36] that can look at the word and can look
[57:38] at that promise and say God I see this
[57:41] as a promise that you have made for me
[57:43] Lord it's something that's striking my
[57:46] heart right now and I may not have to be
[57:48] able to put my finger on it right now
[57:50] but it's a promise that God is making do
[57:53] you realize that that's something that
[57:56] God will do so that you and I can begin
[57:58] to pray about it there's things that God
[58:01] begins to deal with your heart so that
[58:03] you can begin to pray about it because
[58:05] you're praying for it it shows you mean
[58:08] business with God there's sometimes
[58:10] there's things that'll just drop in our
[58:12] lap in a service and then there's other
[58:14] promises that'll lay right before us and
[58:17] God wants to see how determined and how
[58:19] bad how much do you really want it God
[58:22] will bring us to a place to really
[58:24] asking after him not begging but asking
[58:27] him to fulfill his word
[58:30] oh glory be to God you know how it felt
[58:33] when you know your boy your girl would
[58:35] walk up to you and maybe you know even
[58:37] your wife well let's just put it like
[58:38] this and the pickle jar won't come open
[58:40] and she says here honey oh with your big
[58:43] muscles and you might not have a your
[58:45] muscles might be so puny but oh you
[58:47] reach in there and you get that pickle
[58:49] jar you're praying help me Lord let me
[58:51] loosen it and all you get it loosen and
[58:53] she says thank you thank you honey
[58:56] it's something that kind of just it can
[58:58] make you feel a little good now I know
[59:01] Nana probably some of you are like what
[59:03] are we talking about here but you know
[59:04] even when a little boy a little girl can
[59:07] come to their daddy or Mama and they can
[59:09] say something and they can begin to act
[59:11] on their behalf how much greater is it
[59:14] when we can go to almighty God and say
[59:17] Lord I am not self-sufficient but I am
[59:21] depending on you for every promise of
[59:24] God for you're the one to fulfill it
[59:26] Lord
[59:28] oh glory be to God this shall not depart
[59:32] out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate
[59:36] therein day and night that thou mayest
[59:39] observe to do according to all that is
[59:42] written therein for then Thou shalt make
[59:45] thy way prosperous and then thus shalt
[59:51] have good success
[59:54] so that that word prosperous there
[59:57] is not the same word as Prosper above
[59:59] but it is a word that means that there
[1:00:02] will be an advancement or there will be
[1:00:05] a successful to bring it to a successful
[1:00:08] issue
[1:00:11] and there's not one of us that moves in
[1:00:13] a manner or or should that we're
[1:00:16] expecting failure because if you're
[1:00:18] expecting failure remember you only get
[1:00:20] what you expect as a man thinketh in his
[1:00:23] heart so is he
[1:00:25] right and anything that's that's not
[1:00:28] done in faith is sin
[1:00:29] is that right so it's where that God
[1:00:33] himself and remember there's only one
[1:00:34] source of faith faith don't come from
[1:00:36] mama daddy or nobody else faith comes
[1:00:39] from hearing the word of God
[1:00:42] are you right Mama might have a lot of
[1:00:44] good things to say Daddy might have a
[1:00:46] lot of good things to say but Faith
[1:00:48] cometh by hearing the word of God
[1:00:52] that's why we must ask and pray oh God
[1:00:54] Speak to My Heart Lord let me stay in a
[1:00:58] place that you can speak and minister to
[1:01:01] me because we realize in our journey
[1:01:04] we're not always on the up and up or in
[1:01:06] the times where we feel like shouting or
[1:01:08] on a Mountaintop but there's times when
[1:01:10] sickness comes there's times When Trials
[1:01:12] comes let's just put it simple there's
[1:01:14] times when our apple cart gets upset and
[1:01:17] we need a touch and direction from
[1:01:20] almighty God
[1:01:23] and God knew this would be here but now
[1:01:25] as a spiritual Joshua if you will take
[1:01:28] heed to this and don't let it don't just
[1:01:30] let the word be something you pass by
[1:01:32] don't just let it be something that
[1:01:34] moves past through you but let it be
[1:01:36] something you speak it you live it and
[1:01:39] you teach it because by meditating upon
[1:01:42] the word of God and taking that in
[1:01:44] dwelling upon that then you shall make
[1:01:47] your way prosperous there there will be
[1:01:50] a success and everything we can say that
[1:01:53] the success itself will be that of the
[1:01:56] word in our life
[1:01:59] is that right now truly there's a lot of
[1:02:01] things that we can say Lord I wouldn't
[1:02:03] have this job if you didn't leave me if
[1:02:05] you didn't direct me but we can only say
[1:02:08] that when we can actually testify that
[1:02:10] it hasn't taken us away from the word
[1:02:13] because if it's a job or something else
[1:02:15] a activity family whatever more if it
[1:02:18] takes us away from the word then we
[1:02:19] can't call that the blessing of God
[1:02:22] right because it'll never lead us
[1:02:24] outside of the word because when we're
[1:02:27] inquiring of God to pray about things
[1:02:29] and remember it doesn't matter how good
[1:02:31] it feels how good it looks but we always
[1:02:34] take it back to the word God has told
[1:02:37] Joshua here that a real spiritual Joshua
[1:02:40] is one whose life is regulated by the
[1:02:43] word of God it's observant with you not
[1:02:46] How Can You observe to do all that's in
[1:02:48] because there's a desire that's put in
[1:02:51] your heart to walk pleasing to almighty
[1:02:54] God
[1:02:55] that even when it gets hard and and you
[1:02:58] know you are given choices to go right
[1:03:00] or to go left but to just stand there at
[1:03:02] times and and you don't know which way
[1:03:04] to go but you stand having done all the
[1:03:07] staff you stand therefore and you look
[1:03:09] to God and say Lord I know that that's
[1:03:12] not your will and I know that that's not
[1:03:14] surreal I don't got to pray about that
[1:03:15] because it is there's things that's not
[1:03:18] even according to your word
[1:03:21] are you hearing me now but sometimes
[1:03:23] you've got to stand there and you say
[1:03:25] what do I do while I'm standing well the
[1:03:27] only way to stand is when you're on your
[1:03:29] knees praying
[1:03:32] that's the only way to really stand in
[1:03:34] the presence of God are you hearing me
[1:03:36] now because the Bible says do not come
[1:03:38] up to a high seed lest thou be told go
[1:03:40] down to the lower one but must you must
[1:03:43] go to the lower one and then let the
[1:03:45] king bid you into that place that is a
[1:03:48] higher sea so when we come to God In
[1:03:50] Prayer we are coming and looking to the
[1:03:53] will of God we're not trying to place
[1:03:55] ourselves or what we're looking at as
[1:03:57] the will of God but we want to know what
[1:04:00] is your will Lord
[1:04:02] oh glory be to God so notice verse 9
[1:04:06] have not I commanded thee that that's a
[1:04:09] big big statement have not I commanded
[1:04:13] thee who is it that has given you this
[1:04:16] direction
[1:04:17] be strong and of the good courage Be not
[1:04:20] Afraid neither be thou dismayed
[1:04:25] for the Lord thy God is with thee with
[1:04:29] us so ever
[1:04:30] thou goest
[1:04:32] what a comfort
[1:04:35] now what we just read here in verses 7
[1:04:39] and verse 8.
[1:04:41] that's a spiritual Direction
[1:04:44] that's given for good success
[1:04:47] in a prosperous way
[1:04:52] all the way through
[1:04:54] there are battles to fight
[1:04:58] there are things to be overcome
[1:05:02] there are needs that are constantly
[1:05:04] before us to pray about
[1:05:08] let me just kind of set the stage
[1:05:11] we've got to be able to take and look at
[1:05:13] these needs and pray about them with a
[1:05:17] real faith
[1:05:18] because without faith prayer is a hope
[1:05:22] so
[1:05:23] and prayer is not a hope so
[1:05:25] prayer is a Divine communication between
[1:05:28] you and God
[1:05:30] prayer has to do with promises it has to
[1:05:34] do with needs it has to do with
[1:05:35] situations even things that arise in our
[1:05:39] life that come before us that we don't
[1:05:41] know exactly what to do but to be in a
[1:05:44] spirit of prayer do you realize it won't
[1:05:46] do you much good to even sit down with
[1:05:48] me or call me if you first have not been
[1:05:50] in prayer and I know sometimes there's
[1:05:52] things come up that's so distraught
[1:05:54] maybe it comes up on a moment's notice
[1:05:56] or whatever more but let me just say it
[1:05:57] like this it is important that we are in
[1:06:01] prayer
[1:06:03] it's important that we are seeking the
[1:06:05] mind of almighty God
[1:06:07] because we want to hear from God
[1:06:12] now I want you to notice the spiritual
[1:06:13] direction that Joshua has given in the
[1:06:17] Bible of numbers 27 this is is very very
[1:06:20] important because going in to the land
[1:06:23] we recognize that it's not just
[1:06:25] something that Joshua is just kind of
[1:06:28] like on his own and you do what you want
[1:06:30] to do but there is a direction and a
[1:06:33] leadership God is a god of order
[1:06:37] God only he operates by divine order now
[1:06:40] notice here in the Book of Numbers uh in
[1:06:43] chapter 8 or 27 and verse 18 right
[1:06:47] before this verse Moses knows he's going
[1:06:50] off the scene and Moses says asked God
[1:06:53] that the people would have a man before
[1:06:56] them that would be able to go out before
[1:06:59] him and be able to come in before them
[1:07:03] that the people be not as sheath without
[1:07:06] a shepherd now we can see that how what
[1:07:09] that really as it speaks of that that
[1:07:12] there as Moses was saying that then it
[1:07:15] would be the need for a leader one who
[1:07:18] would be there and there's one leader of
[1:07:20] the Church of the Living God and that's
[1:07:23] the Holy Ghost
[1:07:25] that's God himself remember he said if I
[1:07:28] go away the comforter cannot come but if
[1:07:31] I go away I will send the comforter to
[1:07:34] you and we know that God leads us he'll
[1:07:37] lead through offices through vessels is
[1:07:40] that right God will lead through the
[1:07:42] life of a husband and so forth but
[1:07:44] remember that leadership itself is not
[1:07:48] the position but the position should be
[1:07:51] reserved for the leader himself to guide
[1:07:54] and direct under the leading of the Holy
[1:07:57] Ghost is that right because brother
[1:07:59] Brandon would tell us in the church age
[1:08:01] book that God does not lead his church
[1:08:03] by men ruling over men but he said I
[1:08:06] believe there's men that God has sent to
[1:08:09] take charge but their leadership is not
[1:08:12] by that of their own flesh but it's by
[1:08:14] the Holy Spirit delivering the word so
[1:08:18] that the church is not led by a man's
[1:08:20] ideas or man's thoughts upon things but
[1:08:23] the cherish is led by the mind of Jesus
[1:08:26] Christ that moves down Among Us oh my
[1:08:29] what a comfort that is that the Holy
[1:08:32] Ghost is speaking right here to guide
[1:08:35] and direct us
[1:08:36] oh my what a paradox
[1:08:38] think of this in numbers 27 18 and the
[1:08:42] Lord said unto Moses take thee Joshua
[1:08:45] the son of nun a man in whom is the
[1:08:49] spirit and lay thy hand upon him and set
[1:08:54] him before Elias or the priest before
[1:08:57] all the congregation and give him a
[1:08:59] charge in their sight
[1:09:02] and thou shalt put some of thine honor
[1:09:05] upon him that all the congregation of
[1:09:09] the children of Israel may be obedient
[1:09:13] notice and he shall stand I want you to
[1:09:16] take close feed to this verse and he
[1:09:18] shall stand before Eliezer the priest
[1:09:22] who shall ask counsel for him after the
[1:09:26] Judgment of yurum before the Lord
[1:09:31] oh man at his word shall they go out and
[1:09:35] that his word shall they come come in
[1:09:37] both he and all the children of Israel
[1:09:40] with him even all the congregations so
[1:09:43] this leadership and Direction when
[1:09:46] Joshua would say we go out this way it's
[1:09:49] because that Joshua has gotten his
[1:09:52] leadership from the word of God flashing
[1:09:55] forth the direction so when he's saying
[1:09:58] something he's not saying it with a
[1:10:00] maybe think out Joshua comes up to the
[1:10:03] people and says in three days we're
[1:10:05] going over he didn't say it might open
[1:10:08] it might happen but he's speaking with
[1:10:11] the certainty can't you see what it
[1:10:13] means when we can come to God In Prayer
[1:10:16] in heaven fellowship and getting
[1:10:18] ourselves before the word and meditating
[1:10:21] and praying oh my then there will come
[1:10:24] an inspiration of the Holy Ghost that
[1:10:28] brings us certainty with those questions
[1:10:30] we have believing we need the direction
[1:10:34] we're to take there comes a certainty
[1:10:36] from the presence of God
[1:10:41] oh my you say brother Samuel sometimes
[1:10:43] why don't it happen well one of the time
[1:10:45] one thing is we don't always come and we
[1:10:47] don't always inquire
[1:10:49] when situations get hard
[1:10:51] we just we we get away from the word
[1:10:55] we get away from praying
[1:10:58] come on now
[1:11:00] I think if I got a little something like
[1:11:02] that I'd be asking my wife I'd be asking
[1:11:04] my husband I'd be calling another
[1:11:05] brother or sister don't dump them all on
[1:11:07] don't dump all your problems on them
[1:11:09] the Bible didn't say dump your cares on
[1:11:11] them and said cast your cares on him
[1:11:14] come on Friends
[1:11:16] if we could go to God in prayer and
[1:11:18] we're not going there bellyaching but
[1:11:20] we're saying God this situation right
[1:11:22] now it is it is bearing upon my spirit
[1:11:24] it's bearing on my mind but I know that
[1:11:28] even now Lord whatsoever thou says
[1:11:31] there's nothing can hinder this
[1:11:35] come on I'm talking to spiritual joshuas
[1:11:40] glory be to God
[1:11:42] and then there's other times we come and
[1:11:44] we've already got the answer
[1:11:48] and because we've got the answer the
[1:11:51] urum don't light up
[1:11:53] well I'm speaking but it's you're
[1:11:55] already closed off
[1:11:57] if you're closed off he can't speak to
[1:11:59] you
[1:12:01] but it ought to be in this way let me
[1:12:03] just say it in where the rubber meets
[1:12:04] the road it ought to be this way even if
[1:12:06] you are leaning and feeling that it's
[1:12:09] like this there still should be to our
[1:12:11] lives a comma that says God if this is
[1:12:15] not in the correct channel of your mind
[1:12:18] then Lord I'm remaining remaining and
[1:12:21] leaving myself open that you can lead me
[1:12:24] because the word is a discerner
[1:12:27] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:12:30] and I've come tonight Lord I've come in
[1:12:32] the morning I'll come I I need Lord the
[1:12:35] thoughts of my heart discerned
[1:12:37] I need Lord for those questions that are
[1:12:40] before me I need your leadership
[1:12:43] now notice here as we see it let me read
[1:12:46] that again verse 21 and he shall stand
[1:12:48] before Eliezer the priest who shall ask
[1:12:51] counsel for him after the Judgment of
[1:12:53] urum before the Lord and his word they
[1:12:57] shall go out and on his word they shall
[1:12:59] come in both he and all the children of
[1:13:01] Israel with him even all the
[1:13:04] congregation and Moses did as the Lord
[1:13:06] commanded him and he took Joshua and he
[1:13:09] sent him before Eliezer the priest and
[1:13:11] before all the congregation and he laid
[1:13:14] his hands upon him and gave him a charge
[1:13:16] as the Lord commanded by the hand of
[1:13:20] Moses
[1:13:22] oh my I just think of that little song
[1:13:25] that brother Brown sings in one of the
[1:13:27] last messages he speaks leadership
[1:13:29] and he sings a song it wasn't just I I
[1:13:32] sorry I don't believe things are just
[1:13:34] coincident but in the last song that
[1:13:36] sung it is till we meet again till we
[1:13:39] meet again God be with you till we meet
[1:13:43] again
[1:13:45] oh hallelujah it's a living God that you
[1:13:49] and I have not only been introduced to
[1:13:51] by the Living God we've been United to
[1:13:54] so that we might walk in that same
[1:13:56] promise as a spiritual Joshua you see
[1:13:59] that's the difference that's the
[1:14:01] difference because you know this is why
[1:14:03] when the spirit of God would come in
[1:14:05] this hour and it would deal with you
[1:14:07] know life's saying well I've been born
[1:14:09] again but the life don't dally with the
[1:14:11] word and when the word says this well I
[1:14:14] don't think you need to do that that's
[1:14:15] not a spiritual Joshua Paul said let
[1:14:18] anyone who is a spiritual Joshua
[1:14:22] acknowledge that the Commandments that
[1:14:24] I'm writing are the Commandments of the
[1:14:27] Lord in other words to recognize that I
[1:14:30] am his messenger I am his spokesman and
[1:14:34] the thoughts that are here within the
[1:14:36] word for your life that God is speaking
[1:14:39] through my life
[1:14:41] you see a spiritual Joshua that has been
[1:14:44] born of the spirit of God the spirit of
[1:14:46] Truth leads us into
[1:14:49] all truth
[1:14:51] not away from it
[1:14:54] see this is where
[1:14:56] thank God for his Mercy in this hour
[1:15:00] to bring a certainty in our lives
[1:15:03] you know some can look at this and they
[1:15:04] can look at the message and say well the
[1:15:06] message is hard
[1:15:08] well you know what standing in the
[1:15:09] Flames of hell it don't seem too hard
[1:15:13] because remember
[1:15:15] it's to be warned that what the church
[1:15:18] is saying well you can do this you can
[1:15:20] cut your hair you can do this and you
[1:15:22] can live any old kind of life oh you can
[1:15:24] do this you know every time you do it
[1:15:25] just repent and you know it's all right
[1:15:27] there ain't nobody can overcome that and
[1:15:29] and you know it's gotten more wicked but
[1:15:31] then that might that might be something
[1:15:32] that they think or they believe and the
[1:15:35] reason they would do that is because
[1:15:36] they don't know the Living God
[1:15:39] are you hearing me friends I'm talking
[1:15:41] about the Living God that's right here
[1:15:44] Among Us you can take a life you'd be
[1:15:46] pressed to find many that would be
[1:15:48] Sanctified outside in other ranks you'd
[1:15:50] be really pressed to find out are you
[1:15:52] hearing me many can look at certain
[1:15:54] promises and say I've got certain
[1:15:56] experiences and you can sit there and
[1:15:58] see their hair bobbed off you can see
[1:16:00] other things going on and you realize
[1:16:02] that's not the birth of the Holy Ghost
[1:16:05] because the new birth will always
[1:16:07] identify with the word of almighty God
[1:16:09] because the spirit of God will always
[1:16:13] submit itself to the word of God
[1:16:17] amen what shall I do bring Joshua before
[1:16:22] Eliezer oh my and Ellie easer shall
[1:16:26] stand there with the Europe there's only
[1:16:27] one thing that can make this word live
[1:16:29] and that is the Holy Ghost
[1:16:34] oh glory be to God so we're not out of
[1:16:37] Step we're right in step
[1:16:39] with what God has called us and directed
[1:16:42] us to do notice in numbers 34 17. these
[1:16:46] are the names of the men which shall
[1:16:48] divide the land unto you Eliezer the
[1:16:51] priest and Joshua the son of none
[1:16:53] incredible you don't read that in Joshua
[1:16:55] 1.
[1:16:56] what it says in Joshua 1 is Thou shalt
[1:16:59] be strong and courageous For unto this
[1:17:01] people shalt thou divide the land why
[1:17:04] would it include Elias or the priest
[1:17:05] here because the dividing of The
[1:17:08] Inheritance is by the word
[1:17:11] are you with me that's why the Holy
[1:17:13] Ghost it's not just an experience it's a
[1:17:16] word experience an experience from
[1:17:19] passing from Death unto life a life can
[1:17:22] have many experiences but there must be
[1:17:25] an experience where that life can say I
[1:17:28] know I'm not the same person that I used
[1:17:32] to be God has changed my life that's an
[1:17:37] experience
[1:17:39] oh my notice this in Joshua 14 1 and
[1:17:43] these are the countries same statement
[1:17:46] which the children of Israel inherited
[1:17:48] in the land of Canaan which elieza the
[1:17:50] priest and Joshua the son of none notice
[1:17:53] this unity and the heads of the fathers
[1:17:55] of the tribes of the children of Israel
[1:17:58] distributed for inheritance to them
[1:18:02] so the spirit of God
[1:18:05] will never lead us outside of the word
[1:18:08] never
[1:18:11] you see that's a principle that we
[1:18:13] should always live by and as Believers
[1:18:15] we will
[1:18:17] and if we fail to really inquire from
[1:18:20] God and look at the word
[1:18:22] you know sometimes there's things we can
[1:18:25] make some decisions and haste
[1:18:28] and sometimes there's decisions you make
[1:18:30] as you see
[1:18:32] that you don't always get to just say
[1:18:33] Lord forgive me you bear those decisions
[1:18:36] with you it's not God tormenting you
[1:18:39] but it just goes to show that just
[1:18:42] because we belong to God does not mean
[1:18:44] that every decision is going to be
[1:18:46] somehow on the mark that we go to make
[1:18:48] this decision and God's going to say no
[1:18:50] no no no no no no and God just picks us
[1:18:52] up and steers us the other way but this
[1:18:54] is where we should be as children of God
[1:18:56] it's knowing I might be going this way
[1:18:59] but I still want to keep looking to
[1:19:01] almighty God because God knows the path
[1:19:05] that I'm to take and I want to be in the
[1:19:08] center of his will I don't want to do
[1:19:11] nothing that's going to hinder down the
[1:19:13] road
[1:19:15] is that right
[1:19:18] oh my but so the spirit of the Lord it
[1:19:21] will never lead us outside of the word
[1:19:22] he's the spirit of Truth he comes to
[1:19:25] lead and guide us into all truth not
[1:19:30] away from it
[1:19:31] so remember as a spiritual Joshua this
[1:19:34] is not where a person gets down to pray
[1:19:36] and say well you know God has led me you
[1:19:40] know to go to the Baptist Church no God
[1:19:43] never LED you to do that
[1:19:47] well God has led me you know to to do
[1:19:51] this you can put whatever you want to
[1:19:53] put in there or God has led me you know
[1:19:55] to take this job and and all the and you
[1:19:58] hadn't prayed first of all you hadn't
[1:19:59] prayed about it
[1:20:01] oh come on I'm talking about spiritual
[1:20:04] joshuas that are not just walking around
[1:20:06] and I feel led I feel those are
[1:20:08] Pentecostal babies
[1:20:11] I'm gonna preacher now that's
[1:20:13] Pentecostal babies well I feel better I
[1:20:15] feel this or I feel this or I feel this
[1:20:17] as though if I say I feel you can't
[1:20:20] touch it but if the word touches it then
[1:20:22] what you feel better submit to the word
[1:20:26] because it is the word that has life
[1:20:29] is that right not I feel not I feel we
[1:20:32] can have a lot of feelings
[1:20:33] this morning when I let the dogs out I
[1:20:36] had a feeling I had a feeling all right
[1:20:37] when that wind smacked me right in the
[1:20:39] face I'm feeling all right when the rain
[1:20:41] hit me it was okay it was a feeling all
[1:20:43] right
[1:20:44] but you see our spiritual joshuas were
[1:20:47] not going by feelings I might feel a
[1:20:51] certain way but that's not the authority
[1:20:53] I want to know what does the word say
[1:20:56] about it well brother Samuel I don't got
[1:20:59] time listen if we want to be in the will
[1:21:01] of God we got time
[1:21:04] to say Lord what do you say about this
[1:21:06] if Paul would go down into the desert of
[1:21:10] Arabia for three years and he searched
[1:21:13] out the experience that he had right
[1:21:16] there he wanted to see that experience
[1:21:19] in the word what was it a spiritual
[1:21:23] Joshua because his spiritual Joshua
[1:21:26] knows his experience is of god it's a
[1:21:30] word experience that it's placed in the
[1:21:32] word then the channel of divine
[1:21:35] communication is opened
[1:21:39] mama mama
[1:21:41] oh glory be to God
[1:21:43] is present
[1:21:45] to vindicate it to override it
[1:21:48] see this is where
[1:21:50] it comes into that place to say Lord
[1:21:54] help me just to follow and to lord
[1:21:57] always put the word first
[1:22:01] because you see this is the ministry
[1:22:04] right here of Joshua
[1:22:05] of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives it's a
[1:22:07] Ministry of divine Vindication not only
[1:22:10] has God revealed something to us
[1:22:12] but he's there vindicating
[1:22:15] what he's revealed
[1:22:17] like the witness that came to Abel
[1:22:18] there's a witness
[1:22:20] that's moving in our life there's a
[1:22:22] living of that word there's a there's
[1:22:23] the proving of that word it's it's being
[1:22:26] lived out
[1:22:27] through our lives you understand what
[1:22:29] I'm saying
[1:22:30] just to agree with the message is not
[1:22:32] living it through your life
[1:22:34] just to know that brother Brahm is a
[1:22:36] prophet is not not with Divine
[1:22:38] vindication
[1:22:40] are you hearing me but remember as a
[1:22:43] spiritual Joshua you must go all the way
[1:22:46] with the word
[1:22:48] it's not enough even for our life to
[1:22:50] come to know that I've been brought out
[1:22:52] of Egypt and then there's a sanctifying
[1:22:55] in their life I no more smoke I know
[1:22:57] more drink I know any more do marijuana
[1:22:59] I know more Lester no more running
[1:23:01] around here and no more do this but all
[1:23:03] of that is preparation for the promise
[1:23:06] all of those are things right there that
[1:23:10] you are laying aside because you are
[1:23:13] expecting and looking for the promise
[1:23:17] you hear what I'm saying so it's not
[1:23:19] just enough sometimes I'm afraid
[1:23:21] sometimes that some some get comfortable
[1:23:24] with well you know I'll tell you what I
[1:23:26] was an awful bad rascal you might have
[1:23:28] been an awful bad Rascal but you may not
[1:23:30] be completely changed yet because when
[1:23:33] you're changed there is a real fire on
[1:23:37] the inside of your life
[1:23:39] it's not duck and indulging the word and
[1:23:42] well I'll bathe this one and I don't
[1:23:44] obey this one I'm talking about when
[1:23:46] there is that going on listen friends
[1:23:48] that's not to put anybody down but let's
[1:23:51] stand before the urum let's get before
[1:23:54] the lair because we want a word
[1:23:57] experience the Rapture is not for those
[1:24:00] who associate with a message or can
[1:24:03] agree with it or believe it it's for
[1:24:06] those who have become the message
[1:24:09] [Applause]
[1:24:13] then we're looking into the message
[1:24:17] then there's a relationship
[1:24:20] we're feeding on the word of God
[1:24:25] so it's placing
[1:24:27] with Joshua it's putting the word first
[1:24:32] I want you to think about this here
[1:24:34] when Joshua came down
[1:24:37] in Joshua three
[1:24:39] after he sends the spies out in Joshua
[1:24:42] too
[1:24:43] he already knows
[1:24:45] the land it belongs to him
[1:24:48] the report he hears that comes back in
[1:24:50] Joshua 2. I'm going to touch that
[1:24:52] tonight
[1:24:53] he already that's that's a testimony of
[1:24:55] what God already said
[1:24:57] where fear has fallen upon them but now
[1:25:00] in order to take that promise
[1:25:03] there must be the word that is placed
[1:25:06] first so now what God has instructed
[1:25:10] Joshua to do now he comes into the
[1:25:13] application of it and remember Joshua we
[1:25:16] looked at that on that Sunday sometime
[1:25:18] ago here
[1:25:19] of how when he came down
[1:25:21] to the Jordan
[1:25:23] he was at a time
[1:25:25] that it didn't make sense to cross it
[1:25:29] you see the word of God
[1:25:31] will ask you and I to do things that
[1:25:34] don't make sense
[1:25:36] I'm going to preach just as it's coming
[1:25:38] to me right now
[1:25:39] because I'm not going to apologize for
[1:25:41] it
[1:25:42] sometimes the word asks us to do things
[1:25:44] that our feelings don't want to do
[1:25:48] what will my family think if I don't do
[1:25:50] this they might think I'm not a real
[1:25:53] good friendly Lovie Debbie Christian if
[1:25:57] I don't do this I'll tell you what
[1:25:59] they'll think if you'll stand with the
[1:26:00] word and say no I can't do that because
[1:26:04] if I do that that's going to take me
[1:26:06] away from the word
[1:26:08] I'll tell you what they'll do they'll
[1:26:10] respect you because there's a backbone
[1:26:13] to stand on the word of God
[1:26:16] this all packed in here didn't know but
[1:26:18] it's been unpacked it's kind of like my
[1:26:20] wife when she puts some nice treats in
[1:26:22] my bag and packs it and I get them out
[1:26:23] in the hotel and say glory be glory be
[1:26:26] she included some of these things for me
[1:26:30] now these may not be glory be statements
[1:26:32] but they were actually they'll help you
[1:26:33] and I
[1:26:35] because putting the word first there are
[1:26:37] things that God will ask us to do that
[1:26:40] absolutely goes against our emotions
[1:26:43] you think the Lord Jesus wasn't tempted
[1:26:46] to heal everybody there at the pool of
[1:26:50] Bethesda
[1:26:51] one laying here stepping up pardon me
[1:26:54] stepping over that one stepping over
[1:26:55] that one stepping over that one brother
[1:26:58] Adam said human compassion
[1:27:00] would have healed every one of them
[1:27:03] but Godly compassion
[1:27:05] knew there was one who was there and
[1:27:07] stepped over this one over that one over
[1:27:09] this one over this one until it got to
[1:27:12] the one who was there
[1:27:16] do you understand if we can see that in
[1:27:19] that way we have not been brought here
[1:27:21] by human compassion human endowments it
[1:27:24] has been Godly compassion that God did
[1:27:28] not have on us because we deserved it we
[1:27:31] did not deserve the mercy of God we did
[1:27:33] not deserve the love of God he came
[1:27:36] looking for me
[1:27:38] [Music]
[1:27:39] [Applause]
[1:27:42] it doesn't make sense
[1:27:44] but if you put the word first
[1:27:50] well brother Samuel show me a chapter
[1:27:52] where it's written about the pool of
[1:27:53] Bethesda when you come to the pool of
[1:27:54] Bethesda chapter 5 and verse 33.
[1:27:59] maybe that's in the book of second
[1:28:01] opinions
[1:28:03] some of y'all heard that song The Book
[1:28:04] of second opinions
[1:28:08] when I heard that a brother sent that to
[1:28:10] one night I started listening I said
[1:28:12] dear Lord ain't that the truth
[1:28:15] if you ain't heard it you need to hear
[1:28:17] it you get a good kick out of it because
[1:28:19] sometime or another we've got our our
[1:28:21] new translation of the Bible
[1:28:24] and somehow it's got two two opinions in
[1:28:26] it or two Corinthians or second opinions
[1:28:28] in it
[1:28:31] but sometimes putting the word first
[1:28:34] is not something that's wrote out here
[1:28:38] Joshua couldn't there was not a chapter
[1:28:40] on how to cross the Jordan
[1:28:44] there's sometimes there's things in our
[1:28:46] life that we come to and we don't know
[1:28:49] how to face them
[1:28:52] as a spiritual Joshua I can say Amen to
[1:28:54] that
[1:28:55] don't know how to face it whether it's
[1:28:57] in our life in my home in the church
[1:28:58] probably my own life I don't know how to
[1:29:01] face it
[1:29:02] but I have confidence in the God who
[1:29:04] gave his word
[1:29:06] that he's still the same yesterday today
[1:29:08] and forever
[1:29:10] and if I can just get my thoughts out of
[1:29:12] the way sometimes with praying the
[1:29:14] biggest part of prayer is getting myself
[1:29:16] out of the way
[1:29:19] because sometimes they answer many times
[1:29:21] the answer doesn't even come when I'm on
[1:29:24] my knees or laying on my face or walking
[1:29:25] there and praying sometimes the answer
[1:29:27] doesn't even come right then
[1:29:29] you say brother Samuel what's all that
[1:29:31] sometimes that's just really getting us
[1:29:33] out of the way really praying until
[1:29:35] we're actually able to look in the
[1:29:37] mirror as we ought to look in the mirror
[1:29:39] and say you know Lord
[1:29:41] I realize this is my thoughts on it
[1:29:45] this is my feelings on it
[1:29:47] but Lord what do you say about it
[1:29:50] what do you say about this Lord
[1:29:54] you see in those times I think about and
[1:29:57] I'm just going to pull this up here
[1:29:59] tonight and close
[1:30:01] I think about how but
[1:30:02] Dr Sam Adair he came to brother Branham
[1:30:06] now you might look at this request and
[1:30:08] you know about it you might look at it
[1:30:10] and say well what what does that have to
[1:30:12] do
[1:30:13] with the promises of God
[1:30:16] well it has everything because don't
[1:30:18] forget God said when you have forsaken
[1:30:21] houses mothers lands
[1:30:25] Etc
[1:30:26] I will give you them in this lifetime
[1:30:30] and the lifetime to come
[1:30:33] you know how brother Brandon puts that
[1:30:34] in the message forsaking all because
[1:30:36] remember Peter asked himself Lord what
[1:30:39] will we get brother Brown says it like
[1:30:40] this I love it he said you know Jesus
[1:30:43] ain't going to be outdone
[1:30:46] the glory be to God no you ain't gonna
[1:30:49] outdo Jesus
[1:30:51] it ain't like the the relative the uncle
[1:30:54] he's going to one-up you at his wedding
[1:30:55] or his daughter's wedding you don't want
[1:30:57] nothing man they're going to bring
[1:30:58] instead of limousines they're going to
[1:30:59] bring chariots with horses one up one up
[1:31:01] one up no you're not going to outdo
[1:31:03] Jesus
[1:31:08] Dr Sam Adair here he was
[1:31:12] he said
[1:31:13] brother Branham
[1:31:15] I said Billy he said I need he said this
[1:31:18] lot has come open it's the only listen
[1:31:20] it's the only lot
[1:31:22] that I can think of in this city the
[1:31:25] Earth it's the only place that I can see
[1:31:27] where a clinic can go
[1:31:32] he said I've come to pray
[1:31:35] because let's go let's go pray
[1:31:37] they got down and prayed
[1:31:40] when they got it from praying
[1:31:42] where the brand told him said
[1:31:44] that ain't the place but the place that
[1:31:46] you're going to get and the clinic is
[1:31:49] this building right over here of this
[1:31:51] certain brick building on the street or
[1:31:52] whatever I remember seeing it when I was
[1:31:54] there a few years ago
[1:31:55] and he said that's the one you're going
[1:31:57] to get and remember what Dr Sam Adair
[1:32:00] said to him he said Billy it can't be
[1:32:03] that thing is locked up in court for 25
[1:32:06] years
[1:32:08] he said I have tried to get it
[1:32:14] oh boy we could really preach this right
[1:32:16] now it's it's just like
[1:32:19] notice he tried to get it
[1:32:22] there's some things that we try to get
[1:32:24] and God lets us see that on our own
[1:32:27] human efforts we can't do it
[1:32:31] but even on things like this and he said
[1:32:34] now what's he doing saying in twits all
[1:32:36] tied up in court for 25 years he's
[1:32:39] speaking according to the senses that
[1:32:43] are there but he's not looking through
[1:32:45] faith but God has a prophet that's there
[1:32:48] that's able to see that's where you're
[1:32:51] going to Clinic it's going to be oh my
[1:32:54] and brother Graham said the only thing I
[1:32:56] know to tell you is you just believe it
[1:32:59] next morning next morning
[1:33:01] next morning
[1:33:03] next morning
[1:33:06] Billy he said I'm like the freeze to
[1:33:09] death over here
[1:33:10] what's the matter I just signed the
[1:33:14] papers
[1:33:15] for that clinic
[1:33:16] [Applause]
[1:33:20] it makes a difference when we inquire
[1:33:23] of the Lord
[1:33:27] and Joshua was one
[1:33:30] who inquired of the Lord
[1:33:35] to start it the word was going to be
[1:33:38] first
[1:33:39] oh I tell you friends these are the
[1:33:42] these are the kind of people that we
[1:33:43] want to be
[1:33:46] these are the kind of people people
[1:33:48] that follows according to the word of
[1:33:50] God
[1:33:51] this is why brother Branham would take
[1:33:53] in the church age book
[1:33:55] and brother Brandon would speak
[1:33:57] and he would talk about why the
[1:33:58] confusion has come around with the
[1:34:01] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:34:03] brother Ram you know in every age he
[1:34:04] lays that right in it just keeps on
[1:34:06] building and building and building and
[1:34:07] building
[1:34:08] Brother Brad makes a statement and I
[1:34:09] know there's no doubt probably people
[1:34:10] that's taken this off this way or
[1:34:12] whatever more
[1:34:13] but when brother Brown makes a statement
[1:34:15] and he says the problem for all this
[1:34:18] confusion
[1:34:19] is summed up in one word
[1:34:21] experience
[1:34:23] he said people have taken experiences
[1:34:26] instead of the word
[1:34:29] but he says we must go back to the Plumb
[1:34:31] line
[1:34:32] now brother Graham was not saying that a
[1:34:35] person doesn't need an experience
[1:34:37] but he's letting it be known that if
[1:34:39] it's in a word experience it's
[1:34:42] experienced from Death unto life
[1:34:44] well you might shout you might speak in
[1:34:46] tongues you might run I I don't know you
[1:34:48] you may you may not do none of that
[1:34:51] but the one thing about it is your soul
[1:34:54] has moved from Death unto life
[1:34:56] and it will be a life
[1:34:59] that the word itself will testify just
[1:35:02] like Jesus could say if you don't
[1:35:05] believe me
[1:35:06] believe it works out
[1:35:08] believe what you see coming through my
[1:35:10] life
[1:35:11] because it's an experience
[1:35:14] of the word you know how we need his
[1:35:17] leading in every in every part of our
[1:35:19] life
[1:35:20] it doesn't become less as we we get
[1:35:22] older in life you know as you get older
[1:35:25] and walking with the Lord you realize
[1:35:26] just how insufficient
[1:35:29] you really are
[1:35:30] and how much we really need
[1:35:32] you can look back on decisions and
[1:35:34] things that's come about in your life
[1:35:35] right now and you can look at things no
[1:35:38] credits you can take but you can say God
[1:35:40] help thank you for giving me Grace
[1:35:43] to be sensitive how that was done Lord I
[1:35:47] don't know you know sometimes we don't
[1:35:49] even realize maybe have the word has
[1:35:50] come to bring an influence Upon Our Life
[1:35:52] of who we're to marry or this or that
[1:35:54] and we don't even realize well how did
[1:35:56] this happen but you know as you're
[1:35:57] feeding on the word of God
[1:36:00] you're taking in the word observing to
[1:36:02] do all that he has said that word to
[1:36:04] observe means to look into it just take
[1:36:07] it in
[1:36:08] and as you're taking that end and
[1:36:09] knowing that as it's in thy mouth you're
[1:36:12] speaking it living it teaching you just
[1:36:14] so wrapped up in it then everything that
[1:36:17] the word has because let me tell you
[1:36:18] something your spouse
[1:36:20] as a real believer it's not outside the
[1:36:23] word
[1:36:25] it's in the word
[1:36:27] are you with me
[1:36:28] that's why I think uh brother Shane I
[1:36:30] may get this wrong the train sent me
[1:36:33] something years ago and I really liked
[1:36:35] it

[1:36:38] Jesus
[1:36:40] you got how do I remember the exact
[1:36:42] words you got to look so deep in Jesus
[1:36:44] to find him
[1:36:46] you're just focused in that let me say
[1:36:48] that that ain't just about your mate
[1:36:51] that's about your job
[1:36:53] with your children with everything if
[1:36:56] friends if we will take this approach
[1:36:58] with everything in our life
[1:37:02] and really inquire of the Lord
[1:37:05] taking in of the word praying and just
[1:37:09] the answer don't come while we're on our
[1:37:11] knees don't don't get don't get down
[1:37:14] God answers
[1:37:18] prayer
[1:37:19] when you're sincere God can bring it
[1:37:22] right across the pulpit
[1:37:25] God can bring it right while you're
[1:37:27] listening to the message
[1:37:31] in your sincere
[1:37:33] God will answer
[1:37:37] let's pray Heavenly Father
[1:37:40] Lord Jesus
[1:37:42] thank you
[1:37:43] for your mercy
[1:37:47] Lord we look at this
[1:37:49] knowing as you've been even speaking to
[1:37:51] our hearts
[1:37:53] and some of the Sunday services
[1:37:56] and how that Lord we are in a place
[1:37:59] just like this Lord
[1:38:01] another Ephesians
[1:38:03] and here we stand Lord is
[1:38:05] spiritual joshuas
[1:38:09] Lord God all throughout
[1:38:11] or the building the internet and other
[1:38:14] places
[1:38:15] Lord may I pray
[1:38:19] I would ask first Lord if there's one
[1:38:21] that doesn't know you
[1:38:22] in that real personal way
[1:38:25] may they Lord just take the Simplicity
[1:38:28] that you've spoke tonight
[1:38:30] that God
[1:38:32] as they would come before that word
[1:38:34] give themselves to you Lord
[1:38:37] and with the strength and the power of
[1:38:40] almighty God that Lord is moving to draw
[1:38:43] upon their life
[1:38:46] they can lay
[1:38:47] down every habit
[1:38:50] they can lay aside every week
[1:38:54] and every sin
[1:38:56] that does so easily be said
[1:38:59] they can lay it down by the authority of
[1:39:02] almighty God
[1:39:06] Lord they can
[1:39:07] invite and say Lord
[1:39:10] I want that leadership
[1:39:13] in my life
[1:39:17] may you grant that Lord May
[1:39:19] granted Lord to hearts and lives if it's
[1:39:21] never come to that place if it's only
[1:39:24] been an emotion Lord and my I'm not
[1:39:27] against emotion Lord
[1:39:29] I'm probably Lord just considered to be
[1:39:31] an emotional guy in many regards but I
[1:39:34] just
[1:39:35] I just love you Lord I don't know how
[1:39:37] else to express it
[1:39:38] sometimes Lord I I know I even get
[1:39:41] beside myself Lord I'm out there in the
[1:39:43] yard or at home
[1:39:45] driving I know I'm not the only one
[1:39:47] but it ain't by emotion Lord
[1:39:50] but it's by an experience Lord
[1:39:54] we're a person
[1:39:56] has met you face to face
[1:39:58] like Joshua he would come
[1:40:01] before Ellie's or before the euro
[1:40:05] oh God
[1:40:08] there stands Lord the word
[1:40:12] to know that God that you bring a word
[1:40:14] experience in our life you you don't
[1:40:16] produce
[1:40:18] Lord where it's a life that's back and
[1:40:20] forth in the world and out of the world
[1:40:22] no no that's that that's not what the
[1:40:25] word produces
[1:40:27] but may they Lord just invite and say
[1:40:29] Lord
[1:40:30] let the blood go deeper in my life
[1:40:33] let it go down to that Realm
[1:40:36] where there comes a complete
[1:40:37] transformation
[1:40:40] oh God may they take the grace of God
[1:40:42] that nor maybe has wooed them Lord and
[1:40:45] moved them back lord moved them out of
[1:40:47] thoughts about and Lord things that
[1:40:49] maybe they've Lord been caught up in and
[1:40:51] Lord but may they recognize it's
[1:40:54] it's Grace that's coming Lord
[1:40:59] God their life might be United and yoked
[1:41:04] you the word
[1:41:08] the word father
[1:41:11] all throughout this building those that
[1:41:13] streaming on and on
[1:41:17] Lord we have before us
[1:41:20] many responsibilities
[1:41:22] decisions
[1:41:25] things of life
[1:41:29] and Lord
[1:41:31] We Believe dear God that you care
[1:41:38] and Papa we
[1:41:40] we don't want our own thoughts on it
[1:41:43] we want to know what do you think about
[1:41:47] it what do you say
[1:41:50] oh God a spiritual Joshua's Lord
[1:41:54] we want to follow you help us
[1:41:57] God I'm asking you to help each and
[1:41:59] every one of us Lord
[1:42:01] when the way he would get rough
[1:42:04] dreary
[1:42:06] decisions become
[1:42:10] times Lord greater and
[1:42:14] times the Lord decisions we just can't
[1:42:16] snap right off
[1:42:18] but it's things Lord we have to take
[1:42:19] before you in prayer
[1:42:21] God I pray if there's one thing that we
[1:42:23] would take out of this service Lord God
[1:42:25] here tonight I believe what you tried to
[1:42:28] get to us Lord
[1:42:30] is to really inquire of you
[1:42:34] because the Lord Jesus
[1:42:37] really really want our way to be
[1:42:39] prosperous
[1:42:40] not not more money no
[1:42:43] but prosperous in you
[1:42:45] that God to know that whatever you lead
[1:42:47] us to do
[1:42:49] then we can have a confidence and we can
[1:42:51] trust you that
[1:42:53] that even when times get rough and they
[1:42:55] get hard
[1:42:57] that you're the one who opened the door
[1:42:59] and you're the one who's leading us
[1:43:01] you'll never lead us where your grace
[1:43:03] can't keep us
[1:43:04] but you'll give us strength Lord
[1:43:07] you'll make a way
[1:43:09] that our life our spiritual walk does
[1:43:11] not diminish
[1:43:13] but it will continue
[1:43:15] to increase
[1:43:17] because that's what real Prosperity is
[1:43:21] is the success
[1:43:25] of the spirit of God moving through our
[1:43:27] life
[1:43:28] I think of how your Prophet could stand
[1:43:30] there in the message of the token
[1:43:32] and he could speak and testify
[1:43:36] he said the Lord Jesus himself
[1:43:39] he has had more success in the ministry
[1:43:42] he's given me
[1:43:44] than he did in his own Earthly Ministry
[1:43:47] and he drew us back he said notice I
[1:43:50] said he had more success
[1:43:55] Lord that's what we count as success
[1:43:59] it's not our
[1:44:02] gaining of this and gaining of that oh
[1:44:04] there's things in life Lord that you
[1:44:06] give us like Paul could say enjoy those
[1:44:09] things that God has given us
[1:44:11] things the Lord sometimes you give us we
[1:44:13] don't deserve we didn't Merit it we
[1:44:15] didn't earn it Lord
[1:44:17] but you do it just because you can do it
[1:44:20] and Lord we thank you for every every
[1:44:22] blessing
[1:44:24] but Lord most of all the desire that
[1:44:26] burns in our hearts
[1:44:28] is we want to continue to grow into that
[1:44:30] stature of a perfect man
[1:44:33] Lord as your Prophet could stand at the
[1:44:35] end of that message and say I trust that
[1:44:38] this congregation and myself with them
[1:44:40] will pledge that we will not stop but we
[1:44:45] will seek and pray until we see every
[1:44:47] one of these virtues flowing through my
[1:44:50] life and our lives together
[1:44:53] Lord God knowing that there is a growing
[1:44:56] a maturing spiritual
[1:44:59] success
[1:45:01] if there's any success to be had in
[1:45:03] Samuel's life and his success Lord in
[1:45:06] any other life that they can put their
[1:45:07] put their name to it let it be
[1:45:10] that it's the success of the Lord Jesus
[1:45:13] [Music]
[1:45:14] that he's the one that has helped me to
[1:45:17] get myself
[1:45:19] my greatest enemy out of the way
[1:45:22] so that he can have a good time
[1:45:25] so that the Lord can have a good time he
[1:45:27] can have
[1:45:29] good success
[1:45:31] help us Lord
[1:45:34] help us to Lord make every decision put
[1:45:36] it before you in prayer
[1:45:38] Lord knowing that the parts of our our
[1:45:40] natural makeup Lord sometimes we we feel
[1:45:43] so pressured sometimes we feel in such a
[1:45:46] hurry
[1:45:49] I think of it Lord when one brother had
[1:45:51] spoke to me
[1:45:54] looking for a home
[1:45:55] [Music]
[1:45:56] and Lord where the things we're going
[1:45:58] with the housing market
[1:46:01] expressed expressed to me Lord some time
[1:46:03] ago
[1:46:05] said by the time we find out if there's
[1:46:08] a house on the market there's already
[1:46:10] bids they're wanting you to make a bid
[1:46:12] before you ever go to it and this is
[1:46:13] what they said out of their mouth
[1:46:16] I don't like that
[1:46:17] because I want to pray over it
[1:46:20] I want to know
[1:46:22] what does God say about it
[1:46:25] Lord Jesus in situations in times like
[1:46:28] that
[1:46:29] I don't know I can't explain it
[1:46:32] but I believe God that Lord even in
[1:46:34] situations like that that you give us
[1:46:37] Lord such a special Grace
[1:46:39] the Lord God moving in fellowship with
[1:46:42] you that even in those times that we can
[1:46:44] look and say this is not normally the
[1:46:46] time frame that I would move in but it's
[1:46:48] the dove of the holy spirit that would
[1:46:50] move in that would give us such rest
[1:46:52] such peace
[1:46:55] say I'm leading you
[1:46:58] Lord we don't know
[1:47:01] we don't know Lord we we need you
[1:47:05] Lord I'm thankful that we can come to
[1:47:07] you in prayer
[1:47:09] you don't look at a need that we bring
[1:47:11] before you and say really Samuel you
[1:47:14] mean you would ask me pray about Lord
[1:47:16] over years ago when I would pray about
[1:47:18] Lord a vehicle what do I do Lord
[1:47:21] you don't come to me you don't say
[1:47:23] Samuel really you would pray to me about
[1:47:26] that no
[1:47:28] but Lord I know that you can see the
[1:47:31] future
[1:47:33] you know what we have need of or may
[1:47:35] have wants but you know what I need
[1:47:39] Lord God you know the desire of my heart
[1:47:42] I believe that's the desire of every
[1:47:43] other believer
[1:47:45] if it's something if I could have it
[1:47:48] but if it would hinder and get in the
[1:47:50] way of you I don't want it
[1:47:53] I don't want it
[1:47:55] I don't want it Lord I value your
[1:47:57] presence Lord too much
[1:47:59] I value Lord being in your will I value
[1:48:02] Lord your visitation I don't need
[1:48:05] and want to be weighed down
[1:48:07] with things Lord on my mind
[1:48:11] like that Lord
[1:48:14] and yet Lord we have pressures we have
[1:48:16] cares of life
[1:48:17] we have things that Lord that we're
[1:48:19] faced with
[1:48:20] that sometimes seems so great
[1:48:23] but Lord the difference is
[1:48:26] those are things when they come
[1:48:28] things that Lord that we never
[1:48:30] anticipated maybe it's not a reflection
[1:48:33] of a decision we made or something we
[1:48:35] did or failed to do
[1:48:37] God I'm so glad that in everything
[1:48:39] that we can look to you Lord
[1:48:45] granted Lord Jesus
[1:48:47] [Music]
[1:48:48] I'll tell you right here tonight as he
[1:48:50] brings it to my heart as our heads are
[1:48:52] bowed right here tonight
[1:48:54] whatever the need is that would be upon
[1:48:56] your heart
[1:49:00] maybe it's receiving the Holy Ghost
[1:49:04] I think how brother Brandon would speak
[1:49:05] that word and say he would take it no
[1:49:09] doubt he caught a thought in that
[1:49:10] service
[1:49:12] brother random I've sought for the Holy
[1:49:13] Ghost for six years
[1:49:16] he said
[1:49:17] let's ask him tonight
[1:49:21] let's ask him
[1:49:23] what I take from that
[1:49:26] May that Heart Lord God
[1:49:28] may they inquire may they seek
[1:49:31] may they look to you
[1:49:33] whether here on the Internet or would
[1:49:35] hear this service Lord may they inquire
[1:49:38] of you Lord say Lord is there something
[1:49:41] Lord that's in the way
[1:49:43] Lord help me maybe Lord in their heart

[1:55:40] contact with God
[1:55:42] that know what God
[1:55:43] desire to be done
