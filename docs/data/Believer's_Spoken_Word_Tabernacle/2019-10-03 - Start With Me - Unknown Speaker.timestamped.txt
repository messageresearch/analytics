[32:18] [Music]
[32:28] the world
[32:31] [Music]
[33:00] I really mean that god bless you tonight
[33:07] just appreciate your sacrifice come out
[33:09] on a midweek night I know how it is get
[33:12] off work and run over to church you know
[33:14] I did that myself tonight had to had to
[33:16] change in the back office there out of
[33:18] my work clothes by the way that reminds
[33:21] me thank you sister Hannah for letting
[33:23] me borrow the tie
[33:24] I forgot my tie tonight but somebody
[33:26] came through for me
[33:27] amen appreciated brother Brian hooking
[33:30] me up
[33:31] amen god bless you let's stand and turn
[33:33] in the word to the to the seventh
[33:36] chapter of the book of Matthew I hope
[33:40] you're all well tonight
[33:51] Matthew chapter 7 we'll just take the
[33:53] first five verses they're very familiar
[33:55] scripture reading and something about it
[33:58] just struck me a little while back in
[34:00] kind of an unusual way and got a little
[34:04] inspiration here so the Bible says judge
[34:08] not that you be not judged for with what
[34:12] judgment you judge you shall be judged
[34:14] and with what measure you mete it shall
[34:18] be measured to you again and why
[34:20] beholdest thou the mote that is in thy
[34:22] brother's eye but should consider us not
[34:24] the beam that is in thine own eye or how
[34:28] wilt thou say to thy brother let me pull
[34:29] out the mote out of thine eye and behold
[34:31] a beam is in I know and I thou hypocrite
[34:35] first cast out the beam out of thine own
[34:39] eye and then shalt thou see clearly to
[34:42] cast out the mote out of thy brother's
[34:43] eye amen let's take Romans chapter 2 as
[34:46] well and the first four verses there
[34:52] Paul says therefore thou art inexcusable
[34:54] o man whosoever thou art that judges for
[34:58] wherein thou judgest another thou
[35:00] condemn açaí self for thou that judgest
[35:02] doest the same things but we are sure
[35:06] that the judgment of God is according to
[35:08] truth against them which commit such
[35:09] things and think us now this old man the
[35:12] judges then which do such things and do
[35:14] us the same that thou shalt escape the
[35:17] judgment of God or despises thou the
[35:19] riches of His goodness and forbearance
[35:21] and longsuffering not knowing that the
[35:24] goodness of God lead at thee to
[35:26] repentance they make you say amen to the
[35:28] reading of the word tonight amen
[35:31] don't get nervous and then don't get
[35:33] nervous but I want to take something out
[35:35] of these out of this scripture reading
[35:37] that kind of struck my heart would just
[35:39] ask the Lord tonight for his leadership
[35:41] Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for
[35:43] another opportunity to come before this
[35:45] Living Word father and we ask that it
[35:47] would be a discerner tonight Lord of the
[35:49] thoughts and intents of our heart Lord
[35:51] and wherever we're at whatever we have
[35:53] nita father you know better than
[35:54] ourselves lord and so we want to commit
[35:56] ourselves to you Lord and and let
[35:58] nothing hinder tonight the preaching of
[36:00] your word father but may the speaker and
[36:02] the hearer like get out of the way
[36:04] father and yet aside from our humanity
[36:06] for a little while Lord and let the Holy
[36:08] Ghost just come on the scene I pray
[36:10] father take complete control Lord and
[36:12] speak to us the words of life that we
[36:14] have mean of Father and Lord if we're at
[36:16] fault I pray Lord that you would correct
[36:18] us Lord for your rear we are your
[36:20] children Lord if we need encouragement I
[36:22] pray you lift us up tonight Lord
[36:24] whatever it is Lord we commit ourselves
[36:25] to you asking Lord that you would come
[36:27] because you're seated tonight amen
[36:30] so we find this scripture here you know
[36:33] that and it's one that we all know I
[36:35] think everybody just about everybody in
[36:37] the world is familiar with this
[36:39] scripture it's one of the most quoted
[36:41] scriptures I think in the Bible judge
[36:43] not that you be not judged amen amen and
[36:46] it's something that's very fundamental
[36:48] to what we believe it's very simple you
[36:50] know that whatever judgment that we meet
[36:53] out to somebody else the Bible says that
[36:55] the same judgment should be pointed back
[36:57] on ourselves and and so and so I I want
[37:00] to read this not to bring you no real
[37:03] not trying to bring a real heavy hitting
[37:05] sermon tonight or some word of
[37:06] correction or something like that but
[37:08] but the thing about it that has inspired
[37:10] me and has caused me to to just look at
[37:13] my own heart the way that it the way
[37:15] that it hit me when I was studying the
[37:17] scripture and the Lord brought a little
[37:19] bit of our attention and their emphasis
[37:21] is on any other whole amen and this the
[37:24] faults or the sins of somebody else has
[37:26] no bearing on us amen but we are not to
[37:29] judge another but to take care of our
[37:31] own self amen amen and it's something
[37:34] that really just hits us right where the
[37:35] rubber meets the road right in our
[37:37] humanity amen right right and what it
[37:40] means to be a human being because we're
[37:41] always trying to cast to cast an eye
[37:45] somewhere else and we're always trying
[37:46] to look somewhere besides our own
[37:48] problems they man and and our own issues
[37:50] but the right approach to God is not
[37:52] relative to anybody else it's not in
[37:55] relation on the other human being and
[37:57] and it's not to think of ourselves more
[37:59] highly than we ought to think but we're
[38:01] to be as sober people amen and not to
[38:04] lift ourselves up against anybody else
[38:05] compare ourselves to anybody else amen
[38:08] find our security in our relation to
[38:10] somebody else or some church some pastor
[38:13] or some ministry or some family name but
[38:17] we're but the Bible says all have sinned
[38:19] amen and we've fallen short of the glory
[38:21] of God amen and so the Bible says judge
[38:24] not because we've all fallen short we
[38:26] are all sinful born in sin shaped in
[38:29] iniquity amen whether you were wherever
[38:32] you were born onto a barstool or into a
[38:34] church pew amen we're all before God
[38:36] even amen and and on a level playing
[38:39] field before God and so so what so this
[38:42] scripture is about the right approach
[38:44] it's about the right attitude before God
[38:46] amen amen but you know the thing about
[38:48] it is such a misuse scripture and I find
[38:51] and the way that I refer to it sometimes
[38:53] is is this is the sinners favorite
[38:55] scripture judge not that you be not
[38:57] judged that's that's the sinners
[38:59] favorite scripture isn't that right -
[39:00] somebody sent me a little funny
[39:03] something today a little humorous thing
[39:06] that they sent me and they didn't know
[39:07] that I had on my heart to preach this
[39:09] tonight so I kind of took it from the
[39:11] Lord but it it was it was if you put
[39:13] judge not into google translate the
[39:15] thing that people get out is you can't
[39:17] tell me nothing can't nobody tell me
[39:20] nothing amen can't nobody tell me
[39:22] different amen and that's the way that
[39:24] it's used but it's completely wrong
[39:26] brother sister it's completely opposite
[39:28] from what our Lord is telling us in a
[39:30] very simple scripture it's not this
[39:33] scripture is not shield my brother
[39:35] sister it's not something that we hide
[39:37] behind it's something that we use to
[39:39] deflect the blame and deflect God's
[39:41] attention it's not it's not at all
[39:43] something that we use as a defense hey
[39:46] you can't judge me judge not that you be
[39:48] not judged you can't tell me different
[39:49] but this scripture should be a
[39:51] sacrificial dagger amen not a shield but
[39:54] a dagger that every Christian would take
[39:56] hold of the Word of God and take it into
[39:59] our own humanity our own heart and say
[40:01] Lord if your word is going to cut me
[40:04] then cut me Lord and judge me and let me
[40:07] be judged by the word amen and washed by
[40:09] the water of the word so that I can be
[40:11] clean before God amen and we will never
[40:14] come to that place if we if we take the
[40:16] word of God and use it as a shield and
[40:18] begin to put our attention on somebody
[40:20] else in our emphasis on any other human
[40:22] being
[40:23] amen and so we can't look at anybody
[40:25] else but the Bible says we are to work
[40:27] out our own salvation
[40:29] with fear and with trembling amen before
[40:32] God and but you know that so many
[40:34] Christians are trying to hide behind
[40:36] this scripture or behind this this this
[40:40] this word of truth and and we hide
[40:42] behind a feeling of judgment from other
[40:44] people and I know this might be a little
[40:46] different tonight but I'm just following
[40:48] the way the Lord's inspired me tonight
[40:51] that you know we get to where we feel as
[40:53] Christians and just being human beings
[40:55] and honest with ourselves that we mean
[40:58] we sometimes we feel a little bit of
[41:00] judgment from somebody else or we feel
[41:02] that somebody's looking at us a little
[41:04] bit cross-eyed or a little bit different
[41:05] and you know it causes us to to gain all
[41:10] these complexes and all this this
[41:12] defensive nature and we begin to we
[41:14] begin to feel that way toward our
[41:17] brother toward our sister and what we do
[41:19] when we begin to let those complexes
[41:21] take control in our minds is is we cut
[41:24] off the ability for God to correct us a
[41:26] man or God because our because we're
[41:29] feeling that judgment for somebody else
[41:31] and using that as a shield or as a
[41:33] distraction
[41:34] amen until God can't speak to us sending
[41:36] to it amen and and and I know it's a
[41:39] little different tonight but I know that
[41:40] it's true amen I've seen it I've
[41:43] experienced that felt it brother sister
[41:45] as a human being that's the way that we
[41:47] are amen and and all of us you know it's
[41:50] a true statement that we all struggle
[41:52] with things and we all have our
[41:53] struggles and we all have our downfalls
[41:55] and so the correct way to be a Christian
[41:58] we know is not to worry about everybody
[42:00] else's problems but focus on our own
[42:02] problems you know but you know what
[42:03] begins to happen when you get a lot of
[42:05] people that are that are around each
[42:07] other and you get it you get a church
[42:08] and we get together on Sunday morning
[42:10] some people's struggles are a lot more
[42:12] visible than others as some people when
[42:16] they're struggling
[42:17] everybody knows amen and so it just
[42:19] causes those little social problems you
[42:22] know what I'm talking about those little
[42:24] that little bit of friction you know
[42:26] because this brother struggling with
[42:28] something but it's something real deep
[42:29] secret in his heart and nobody sees it
[42:31] but you know this sister struggling with
[42:33] a little bit of worldliness a little bit
[42:35] of immodesty or whatever it is or
[42:37] worldly fashion it begins to show on the
[42:39] outside and that's where we get the
[42:41] problem say man because
[42:42] this one you know because because then
[42:45] then what happens you know if you it
[42:47] when we struggle with those kind of
[42:48] things all of a sudden people start to
[42:51] just look at you a little different and
[42:52] and you start to pick up on a little
[42:54] reaction you know but but and and what
[42:57] the problem is the devil works on that
[42:59] he works on that to cause us to begin to
[43:02] to get all defensive even though we know
[43:05] that we're wrong amen
[43:06] even though we know that we're wrong and
[43:08] yet because somebody look at us a little
[43:10] bit different that we start to get our
[43:12] or get our dander up you know and and
[43:15] and we get all these little problems
[43:16] just because Christians are not mature
[43:19] enough ain't meant to take their
[43:21] attention off of somebody else and onto
[43:23] the Word of God and on to their own
[43:25] hearts Amen before God and and you know
[43:27] I believe that I really believe that
[43:29] Christian people and church-going people
[43:31] really believe this Bible and are really
[43:34] loving and gracious people amen but you
[43:37] know sometimes when you're struggle with
[43:39] something it's so visible you can't
[43:42] blame somebody for having a reaction
[43:43] now come on brother sister you know if I
[43:46] came up to this pulpit tonight and I was
[43:48] smoking a cigarette
[43:49] amen walking all the way up to the front
[43:50] of the church I believe you're Christian
[43:52] people you'd have grace for me you'd
[43:54] have mercy amen but but but you'd
[43:56] probably look at me a little bit
[43:58] different wouldn't you hey man hey man
[44:00] is that fair tonight Amen what I'm
[44:03] trying to what I'm trying to do is just
[44:05] it's just talk about where we're living
[44:07] as human beings and we begin to feel
[44:09] these feelings from one another we feel
[44:10] that little bit of judgment we feel that
[44:12] little bit of somebody somebody looking
[44:14] down on us a little bit and most of it's
[44:16] in our imagination a mint because most
[44:18] people are really loving and they want
[44:20] somebody to get help and they want
[44:21] somebody amen to have deliverance but
[44:23] you know we begin to take those sayings
[44:25] and we begin to use that as a shield and
[44:28] the devil will use that as a distraction
[44:29] amen and then a rebellious spirit will
[44:32] come on somebody that knows they're
[44:33] wrong and they will use somebody else's
[44:35] treatment of them as an excuse say man
[44:38] rather than get help from God rather
[44:40] sister we should not be so petty amen
[44:42] and we should not be so full of
[44:44] ourselves and self-importance to to let
[44:48] the devil deceive us that way
[44:50] amen and take things that we know to be
[44:52] wrong
[44:53] and then in Pride we'll hold on to them
[44:55] because of something that we imagine
[44:57] from somebody else amen amen and so but
[45:01] and it's it's just a lie of the devil
[45:03] and it's a poor excuse brother sister if
[45:05] even if somebody really is looking at
[45:08] you with judgment that is a poor excuse
[45:10] not to seek peace with God amen and not
[45:14] to come into rest with the word of God
[45:16] and amen and being a healthy and free
[45:19] amen and delivered state as a Christian
[45:21] amen it's a poor substitute a man sold
[45:25] so tonight I don't want you to let's not
[45:27] waste our time with a shooting match
[45:29] with somebody else and worried about
[45:31] what somebody else thinks about us they
[45:33] men let's work out our own salvation
[45:34] with fear and trembling before God and
[45:37] say God Here I am in church tonight on a
[45:40] Thursday night and Lord amen and here's
[45:42] the title of my sermon tonight Lord
[45:44] start with me start with me
[45:47] amen Lord not looking at anybody else
[45:50] anybody else's problems anybody else's
[45:52] what they think about me but Lord start
[45:54] with me I believe that's what this
[45:56] scripture Amen was given by our Lord to
[45:59] cause us amen to have the right attitude
[46:01] before God amen not of what somebody
[46:03] else thinks or somebody else's problems
[46:05] or what they're preaching over there or
[46:07] what that pastor said or this drama or
[46:09] that drama but Lord start right here
[46:11] Lord amen and if there's something that
[46:13] you have for me tonight Lord I want to
[46:16] receive it and don't let anybody get in
[46:18] my way don't let any insecurities or any
[46:20] complex or any lie of the devil or
[46:23] distraction come between me and my
[46:25] victory tonight amen because I want to
[46:28] be at peace with God I want to be free
[46:30] before the Lord amen absolutely oh my so
[46:35] many Christians are trying to hide
[46:37] behind that feeling of of judgment but
[46:39] you can't you're not supposed to use
[46:41] this scripture has a shield amen
[46:43] but we stand before God tonight as an
[46:46] individual every Christian every human
[46:49] being stands before God as an individual
[46:51] not as a church not as a family
[46:54] Amen not as not as a part of a movement
[46:57] that we call message believers but if
[46:59] you're standing in the presence of God
[47:01] tonight
[47:01] you stand there alone as a sole
[47:04] individual
[47:05] person amen brother bran said that God
[47:08] always works with an individual he said
[47:11] he doesn't save you because you're
[47:13] Methodists he doesn't save me because
[47:15] you're Baptist he doesn't save you
[47:17] because you're Pentecostal he doesn't
[47:19] say because he belonged to a mrs. Church
[47:21] Amen he doesn't fit and you are saved on
[47:24] that basis that you have accepted it
[47:26] amen so therefore for God to deal with
[47:29] you he doesn't deal with you in the
[47:31] order of the church but he deals with
[47:33] you as an individual amen so as long as
[47:36] we're messing around with church drama
[47:38] and church gossiping and a back and
[47:40] forth or feuding with this one or that
[47:42] one amen we will never meet God that way
[47:45] we will never enjoy the blessings of his
[47:47] present because he doesn't meet you on
[47:49] those grounds brother sister he does not
[47:51] accept you on the grounds because you
[47:53] dress like everybody else because you go
[47:55] to a good church because you come and
[47:57] sing the songs and pay your tithe but
[47:59] the weird God accepts you is under the
[48:01] grounds of an individual who has come to
[48:04] the altar of God alone Amen and put
[48:06] there and laid their life down at the
[48:08] altar amen it's a heart that says I
[48:11] don't care what anybody else does I
[48:12] don't care what anybody else says I
[48:14] don't care what anybody else thinks
[48:16] about me I want to meet God and I want a
[48:19] reality of a real experience with God
[48:22] amen he deals with you as an individual
[48:25] God doesn't accept you on the basis of
[48:27] association Amen so if you think that
[48:30] you're anything before God because of
[48:32] relativity to anybody else Amen because
[48:35] of how you compare yourself to any other
[48:37] human being
[48:38] you're an error brother sister he only
[48:41] sees you as an individual oh but see
[48:43] that's the kind of religion people want
[48:45] today Amen is a church religion where
[48:48] they can come on Sunday morning hello
[48:50] and let everybody else mind their own
[48:52] business and and they're not my pastor
[48:54] come down my way and and try to bring a
[48:56] word of correction he bet or not amen I
[48:59] want to be left alone I just want to be
[49:01] part of the group I don't want to be
[49:03] singled out I don't want to have to
[49:05] raise my hand I don't want to have to
[49:07] say Amen I just want to come to church
[49:09] and have somebody make me happy amen
[49:10] amen and that's the Laodicean spirit of
[49:13] today
[49:14] man oh I'm just as religious as
[49:16] everybody else I sing the songs I pay my
[49:18] ties I dress like the rest of them amen
[49:21] and better than so many men Amen well I
[49:24] hope my favorite preachers preaching
[49:26] tonight cuz he never gets loud and he
[49:28] never spits and slobbers and and he
[49:31] never steps on my toes but see that's
[49:33] the problem right there brother sister
[49:34] as we get to be such a great big
[49:37] somebody and then how could you know no
[49:39] wonder you get your toes stepped on you
[49:41] got those great big toes
[49:44] amen brother branham said that we're not
[49:46] supposed to be somebody but we're to be
[49:48] a nobody before God he said God doesn't
[49:50] use somebody's but he takes nobody's and
[49:53] he makes him as somebody's if they're
[49:55] able to make themselves nobody amen
[49:58] now if you're somebody tonight where the
[49:59] bram said God can use you amen but
[50:01] you've got to forget that you're
[50:02] somebody and become a nobody and then
[50:05] God can make that nobody is somebody hey
[50:07] man do you keep up with that that's a
[50:10] little bit of a tongue twister but but
[50:12] that's absolutely right brother is it's
[50:13] that self-important layout of seeing
[50:17] spirit what is that spirit brother man
[50:19] said it's people's rights you don't have
[50:21] a right to tell me different you don't
[50:23] have a right to correct me you don't
[50:24] have a right to preach on me amen
[50:26] oh my Amen that's the day that we're
[50:30] living in amen and it's simple tonight
[50:32] it's not some deep mystery but I think
[50:34] it's the reality of our human nature and
[50:36] the just the religious spirits that
[50:38] we're dealing with today and those are
[50:40] the worst ones amen all brother Brad
[50:42] said are you saying well let the
[50:44] preacher do it but he said this is an
[50:47] individual affair that's what people
[50:49] want let the preacher do it let the
[50:50] pastor do it Amen he didn't shake my
[50:53] hand last Sunday a man he didn't come he
[50:56] didn't come over when I was sick even
[50:58] though those the fourth time I've been
[51:00] sick this month
[51:01] Amen this is an individual affair
[51:04] brother Brad said it's with every one of
[51:06] us now the preacher might do it himself
[51:08] he might pray and get a soul blest amen
[51:12] but unless the congregation has stayed
[51:14] in the same way see unless the
[51:17] congregation see the preacher can study
[51:19] and pray and prepare his heart amen and
[51:22] meditate before God but brother have
[51:23] said unless the congregation has
[51:25] stayed the same way amen he said that
[51:28] that's what makes the difference but if
[51:30] the congregation is ready to meet the
[51:32] Holy Spirit amen
[51:33] did you come ready tonight amen if you
[51:35] come ready to meet the Holy Spirit then
[51:38] he said I'll tell you sinners will weep
[51:40] their way to cavalry he said if we could
[51:42] just take it as an individual you're
[51:46] just as responsible as any of these
[51:47] ministers God is going to hold you as an
[51:50] individual responsible amen when we get
[51:52] to that place brother sister we won't be
[51:55] able to pull we won't be able to point
[51:56] fingers at anybody we won't be able to
[51:58] we won't be able to blame it on that
[51:59] preacher that old that old pastor we
[52:01] used to we used to have that taught it
[52:03] wrong and taught us different or our
[52:05] daddy that didn't treat us right amen or
[52:07] that brother that hurt our feelings or
[52:09] that deacon that that stepped on our
[52:11] toes or whatever it is there will be no
[52:13] finger-pointing before God there will be
[52:14] no excuses amen amen but the only way to
[52:18] approach God is as on the basis of an
[52:20] individual amen that's absolutely right
[52:23] but the problem is we've got so many
[52:24] religious spirits in the world today
[52:26] amen it's a plague that's been sent on
[52:28] the churches of this day amen and we
[52:30] preached this before but but you know
[52:32] that that that pale horse rider of
[52:34] confusion and and people's rights and
[52:37] lukewarmness he's not riding against the
[52:39] Pentecostal would like nothing better
[52:40] than to get you and I amen come to Seoul
[52:43] completion till we come to church on
[52:45] Thursday night and sit there like a bump
[52:47] on a log
[52:48] Amen and we're too busy thinking about
[52:50] somebody else's problems or somebody
[52:52] else's attitude can we cannot receive
[52:55] something from God amen but I say start
[52:57] with me Lord amen don't look at anybody
[53:00] else but Lord start right here
[53:02] amen and see if there be any wicked way
[53:05] in me and lead me in the way everlasting
[53:08] absolutely Amen oh my people want a
[53:11] pastor or a priest or a prophet or
[53:14] anything to stand between them and God
[53:16] and do all the work and amen it's like a
[53:18] reverse Nicolaitans spirit people want
[53:21] somebody to take control and and and
[53:23] take all the all the power and do all
[53:26] the works and amen and do everything
[53:28] before God and we'll just show up amen
[53:30] but it was not so from the beginning
[53:32] Amen there and back in the Garden of
[53:34] Eden
[53:35] amen there was no pastors and priests
[53:37] and prophets and
[53:38] betweens and intercessors but what was
[53:41] it a men was a was God and man walking
[53:44] and talking lip to ear amen God and his
[53:47] children and today by a message we have
[53:50] been brought into an adoption time amen
[53:52] and the order of this day is not a
[53:55] church experience Amen it's not but it's
[53:57] not it's not putting a penser between
[54:00] you and God what it is you as an
[54:02] individual by the revelation of this
[54:04] word having a personal amen individual
[54:08] fellowship with God hallelujah what a
[54:11] privilege amen
[54:12] children to walk with Him and and a talk
[54:14] with him my wife just sent me a quote
[54:17] earlier today how brother branham said a
[54:19] man that will tote that will that will
[54:21] follow God and hold to God and walk with
[54:24] God God will walk with that man amen
[54:27] what a message that we've had what an
[54:29] opportunity today to press beyond a
[54:31] religious experience and press beyond a
[54:34] church association and walk in the
[54:37] presence of the Almighty as an
[54:39] individual as a son as a daughter amen
[54:43] that's what we must take advantage of
[54:45] amen that's what has offered us today
[54:48] amen to come into that holy place and
[54:50] speak lip to ear to our Lord hallelujah
[54:55] the order of this day is an Eden
[54:58] restoration where God speaks lip to ear
[55:00] lip to ear fellowship with his children
[55:02] amen for the tabernacle of God is with
[55:05] men and he shall be their God and they
[55:06] shall be his people Amen that's what
[55:09] we're coming to brother/sister is a
[55:10] reality
[55:11] Amen but see a church experience carries
[55:15] deception a religious affiliation
[55:17] carries deception
[55:19] it carries complacency and laziness say
[55:22] man because there's so many people
[55:24] around to look at so many people around
[55:27] to look at but brother this quickening
[55:29] power Amen has come to assure us in to
[55:33] the reality of the presence of Jesus
[55:35] Christ amen is so real brother sister
[55:37] what did brother Brown say about Philip
[55:39] when that quickening power came that
[55:41] rapturing power amen there's Philip in
[55:44] the middle of revival where crowds of
[55:46] people are being baptized and God's
[55:49] doing a great movement on the face of
[55:50] the earth but
[55:51] he experienced the quickening power it
[55:53] took Philip away from the revival away
[55:56] from the group out into the backside of
[55:58] the wilderness and that's where God
[56:00] could use him amen that's where God
[56:02] could speak to Philip he couldn't speak
[56:04] to him
[56:05] with the throngs of people with the
[56:06] crowds amen and he can't speak to you
[56:08] that way but he's got to he's got to
[56:11] catch you and quicken you buy that
[56:12] quickening power of the Holy Ghost and
[56:15] get you to a place where he can speak to
[56:17] you as an individual amen there's not
[56:19] enough there's not enough preachers in
[56:21] the fivefold ministry to do what the
[56:23] bride is called to do hey man hey man
[56:26] there's no prophet on the face of the
[56:27] earth to carry this word by himself but
[56:30] what we have is a many membered bride
[56:32] body who is called Amen to to stand as
[56:36] the Oracle of God and hear his voice in
[56:38] her ears and speak his word from her
[56:41] mouth
[56:41] amen absolutely I believe the brides
[56:43] ministry is not a collection of
[56:45] preachers but it's lived voices amen its
[56:48] church members that oppressed beyond the
[56:50] group and pressed into the presence of
[56:52] God amen with an individual reality of
[56:55] an experience amen you believe that
[56:59] tonight amen so the hour that we're
[57:03] living in is the hour of the
[57:04] manifestation of sons amen how many
[57:06] believe we're in an adoption time we're
[57:08] an adoption time at and that that that
[57:11] means that we're not to be full of
[57:13] judgment we're not to have this
[57:15] judgmental a spirit we're not to be the
[57:19] type of people who look down on somebody
[57:21] else have problems somebody else not at
[57:24] all amen for the Bible said love your
[57:26] enemies do good to them that hate you
[57:29] bless them that curse you and pray for
[57:33] them which use you and be there for
[57:35] merciful
[57:37] as your father is merciful do you catch
[57:41] that be there so there's there's
[57:43] adoption there's sonship being merciful
[57:46] as your father is merciful amen I tell
[57:51] you that's powerful to me amen
[57:53] so see mercy is an attribute of sonship
[57:57] mercy that merciful nature that net what
[58:00] was Christ like amen amen and and he was
[58:03] the firstborn among many brethren amen
[58:06] and if he was merciful then we are to be
[58:08] merciful that's why I believe the bride
[58:10] the message that we're carrying it's not
[58:12] a message of judgment it's not a message
[58:13] of no hope Amen I don't believe we
[58:15] should pray we should preach it in a way
[58:17] that cuts everybody down and and just
[58:19] wants to scorch the earth and blast
[58:21] everybody I believe in correction I
[58:23] believe in the truth of the word but I
[58:25] believe the end time evangelism is to
[58:27] build the bride and I believe that the
[58:29] bride has been given a message not of
[58:31] indictment but of Shalom Amen hallelujah
[58:34] amen brother Brown said that the bride's
[58:36] ministry is the same as his hey man
[58:38] that's absolutely right well what was
[58:40] his ministry they came to him and and
[58:42] they thought it was going to be like
[58:43] Elijah's preaching amen
[58:45] they thought he was going to be like
[58:46] when I dropped my spit cover here
[58:49] remind me that's there amen they thought
[58:51] they thought that when he came it would
[58:54] be like Elisha Amen because Elijah came
[58:56] and he what he laid the ex to the root
[58:58] of the tree and that's why a lot of
[59:00] people think you got to preach this
[59:01] message just like an indictment amen oh
[59:03] no but you see when the word came it was
[59:06] a judgment to the world but to us it was
[59:08] peace amen and the message that the
[59:10] bride of Jesus Christ is caring to this
[59:12] world is not a message of wrath but it
[59:15] is a message of whosoever will let him
[59:16] come let him that is thirsty come amen
[59:19] and so they thought that about our Lord
[59:21] and they said well why are you gonna are
[59:22] you gonna call down fire like Elijah did
[59:24] he said no I didn't come to the world to
[59:27] destroy it I came to save it amen
[59:31] hallelujah and that means something to
[59:33] me because I believe that there's a
[59:35] bride on the face of the earth now Amen
[59:38] that has the Ministry of reconciliation
[59:39] and she has a word by a message that is
[59:43] able to save men's souls and I believe
[59:45] there are recipients waiting here in
[59:47] this world lost
[59:48] see Dan even foolish virgin which are
[59:51] waiting for the bride of Jesus Christ by
[59:53] the message of the hour to loose them
[59:55] from their very sin amen hallelujah and
[59:58] the way that it takes brother-sister is
[1:00:00] not some it's not some crazy fanaticism
[1:00:03] or some Catholic idea of bless me Father
[1:00:06] for I have sinned
[1:00:07] but brother Branham said that in us is
[1:00:08] the power to remit sins and it's just
[1:00:11] the way that Peter had it when they said
[1:00:13] men and brethren what must we do to be
[1:00:14] saved and Peter said repent and be
[1:00:18] baptized amen in the name of the Lord
[1:00:20] Jesus Christ and you shall be filled
[1:00:22] with the Holy Ghost and that's what the
[1:00:24] bride of Jesus Christ has is a life on
[1:00:26] the inside when somebody comes and they
[1:00:28] say you know you've got something that
[1:00:30] I'm looking for and I feel something
[1:00:32] when I'm around you I don't feel
[1:00:33] anywhere else and I'm looking for truth
[1:00:36] and I believe you've got something for
[1:00:38] me then you don't point them to a church
[1:00:39] and you don't point into a group and you
[1:00:42] don't hand them a book or a tape but
[1:00:44] you've got something on the inside this
[1:00:46] is that just what Peter had this is that
[1:00:49] this is what you're looking for this is
[1:00:52] that experience the reality of the
[1:00:54] presence of God amen it doesn't take the
[1:00:57] form of judgment Amen buddies ministries
[1:01:00] a redemptive ministry amen I believe
[1:01:03] we're gonna get a little more into that
[1:01:04] on Sunday so we'll just we'll just carry
[1:01:07] on tonight's that but mercy is an
[1:01:09] attribute of sonship brother Bram said
[1:01:12] when you live your life to yourself you
[1:01:14] haven't got eternal life amen and
[1:01:17] there's the problem is we we live for
[1:01:19] ourselves we live for our own glory we
[1:01:22] live for our own pleasure and and we're
[1:01:24] selfish amen because we're human beings
[1:01:26] amen but when you live that way brother
[1:01:28] Bram said that's not eternal life but
[1:01:31] eternal life is living for others soul
[1:01:33] somebody said brother Branham how can
[1:01:35] you stand let somebody call you such bad
[1:01:37] names all the time and and undergo
[1:01:39] criticism he said you don't live for
[1:01:41] yourself you live for others you live
[1:01:44] for others watch us now that you might
[1:01:47] redeem that man oh that's powerful amen
[1:01:52] you live for others that you might
[1:01:54] redeem that man I believe in a power in
[1:01:58] the bride of Jesus Christ amen that if
[1:02:01] she'll look me
[1:02:02] on herself and not live herself and lay
[1:02:05] down her selfish motives and give God
[1:02:07] the preeminence amen then he will pour
[1:02:09] into her everything that was poured into
[1:02:11] Christ and she will fulfill the Ministry
[1:02:13] of Christ and live such a life that even
[1:02:15] the people that talk bad about you and
[1:02:17] try to misuse you you have the power in
[1:02:20] you even to redeem that sinful man or
[1:02:23] that woman
[1:02:24] amen brother Brandt said you become sons
[1:02:26] and the trouble is the church has forgot
[1:02:29] they were sons we forgot who we are amen
[1:02:34] forgot that we're sons forgot that that
[1:02:37] apostolic power is still alive amen to
[1:02:40] carry something real to this world more
[1:02:43] than churchianity more than religion but
[1:02:45] a real life you're a son and you are
[1:02:48] taking Christ's place amen
[1:02:53] I hope your hearing tonight amen and
[1:02:55] what a what what what's speaking to me
[1:02:57] here I hope it is meaning something to
[1:02:59] you we got something so much more than
[1:03:01] some watered-down what would Jesus do
[1:03:04] religion some kind of a some kind of a
[1:03:06] you know be nice and be kind and and be
[1:03:09] friendly no it's a power brother sister
[1:03:12] a power of redemption that is alive in
[1:03:15] the bride through the life of Jesus
[1:03:16] Christ and the same power that saved you
[1:03:19] is in you to save somebody else the same
[1:03:21] mercy that was poured into your vessel
[1:03:24] can be poured out amen if we surrender
[1:03:26] to the Holy Spirit but not if it's
[1:03:28] clogged up with all of you and your
[1:03:32] issues and your pride and your problems
[1:03:34] and your worldly desires amen what
[1:03:38] brother have said that we need is a
[1:03:39] stripping of ourselves say Lord just
[1:03:41] just strip away everything that's human
[1:03:43] everything that's me Lord let me get out
[1:03:45] of the way Lord and not worry about
[1:03:47] anybody else but start right here and
[1:03:49] break out all the clogs start with Annie
[1:03:51] Lord and take away the bitterness take
[1:03:54] away the selfishness because if you
[1:03:55] don't start with me then how can I help
[1:03:57] somebody else amen if you don't clear my
[1:03:59] eyes of my problems amen then how can I
[1:04:02] see clearly to help my brother help my
[1:04:04] sister and all the problems that we have
[1:04:06] in churches amen just about everything
[1:04:09] that we go through on this earth is
[1:04:10] because we make ourselves too big
[1:04:13] - important hey man oh my live for that
[1:04:18] man who hates you he said live for that
[1:04:21] person who would kill you if they could
[1:04:23] that's what they did to him they killed
[1:04:26] him and he died that he might save them
[1:04:27] and that's eternal life that's eternal
[1:04:31] life you know if you can overcome this
[1:04:33] distractions of other people and all
[1:04:35] their problems you can become the very
[1:04:37] redemptive power to set that person free
[1:04:40] amen if you're little enough that you
[1:04:43] can bear their abuse and and take the
[1:04:45] judgment and the mistreatment and
[1:04:47] whatever it is
[1:04:47] amen then you can be the very power to
[1:04:50] loose that person and that's exactly
[1:04:52] what the brides called to be that's why
[1:04:54] we must humble ourselves amen you
[1:04:57] believe this tonight what I'm preaching
[1:04:59] Alleluia see see we protest innate it
[1:05:03] unto adoption and I believe that before
[1:05:06] the foundation of the world he had
[1:05:08] predestinated us to this adoption the
[1:05:11] sonship and he ordained that there
[1:05:13] attributes of mercy would be poured into
[1:05:15] human vessels today that's why the
[1:05:16] Bible's called you a vessel of mercy not
[1:05:18] a vessel of Wrath but a vessel of mercy
[1:05:20] amen which mean all that God has in mind
[1:05:22] for you is mercy amen he has decided to
[1:05:25] fill you with mercy fill you with great
[1:05:26] he's not mad at you he's not angry at
[1:05:28] you but he has shown you mercy
[1:05:30] and he did it so that you could show it
[1:05:32] to somebody else amen but the problem is
[1:05:34] were mad at our brother were mad at
[1:05:35] ourselves were mad at God amen and so
[1:05:38] we're mad at everybody else hey man
[1:05:39] but we what we're not to be full of
[1:05:42] wrath but we're to be full of mercy
[1:05:43] vessels of Mercy and there's a power of
[1:05:46] redemption in this bride that can save
[1:05:49] our fellow man I just believe that
[1:05:51] brother sister is a great component of
[1:05:54] what we are lacking what we are missing
[1:05:56] amen and what we are not laying to hold
[1:05:58] of we've had a prophet that said that
[1:06:01] our attitude toward somebody else could
[1:06:02] determine their eternal destination amen
[1:06:05] so we ought to think about ourselves
[1:06:07] different we ought to think about that
[1:06:09] the long thing different because it's a
[1:06:11] different word we've turned a corner
[1:06:12] into something powerful something great
[1:06:15] amen you can't take your humanity with
[1:06:17] it but it's all Christ
[1:06:20] it's Christ having the preeminence
[1:06:21] Christ getting the glory that's what
[1:06:24] we're desiring tonight amen and it'll
[1:06:28] take divine love it'll take divine love
[1:06:31] human love we'll never do it and you
[1:06:33] know brother branham said that we try to
[1:06:36] use God's love the same way we do human
[1:06:39] love we try to use God's love like human
[1:06:43] love but it's two different love's
[1:06:44] altogether he said even the Greek words
[1:06:48] of different ones called filial love
[1:06:49] there's a filial love a human love
[1:06:52] he said that's like the love that you
[1:06:53] have for your wife right and then you
[1:06:55] have that filial love and it's real it's
[1:06:57] a power it's a powerful force of that
[1:06:59] human love but but he said then there's
[1:07:01] a gap a love and that's the love of God
[1:07:03] and he said the difference is a mana
[1:07:05] you're walking down the street and some
[1:07:07] man said something a little off color to
[1:07:08] your life figlio love that human love a
[1:07:10] man you'd attack that man but a cop a
[1:07:14] love would make you pray for his lost
[1:07:16] soul
[1:07:17] and so and so many times I think we've
[1:07:20] got the wrong understanding of what it
[1:07:22] means to have love because it's
[1:07:24] something so far beyond that humanity
[1:07:26] it's beyond our feelings it's beyond our
[1:07:29] beyond our instincts amen it's beyond
[1:07:32] our normal reaction when somebody
[1:07:34] mistreats you and then what do you do
[1:07:36] you react you you your instinct kicks in
[1:07:38] you want to strike back amen
[1:07:40] that's what human love will do but
[1:07:42] there's a power and divine love that
[1:07:44] bypasses the humanity altogether and
[1:07:47] that's what we've got to break into
[1:07:49] that's what's promised to this bride
[1:07:50] amen the problem with human love human
[1:07:53] love has fear it has fear that's why
[1:07:56] that's why we hurt the ones we love
[1:07:58] amen amen you ever hurt somebody you
[1:08:01] love amen because uh because a fear got
[1:08:04] in there a little bit of worry so you
[1:08:06] said something out of love you said it
[1:08:08] but it wasn't right and it hurts
[1:08:09] somebody and that's why we can have
[1:08:11] problems in our churches and a problem
[1:08:14] between this brother and this brother
[1:08:15] and they love each other but there's
[1:08:18] still a problem because we're trying to
[1:08:20] operate on human love amen
[1:08:22] but and human love has fear and human
[1:08:26] love has complexes and it has
[1:08:28] self-importance a man that's the problem
[1:08:30] with human love is it's that
[1:08:32] self-importance and and so we're afraid
[1:08:35] amen
[1:08:36] uh we're afraid of being humiliated
[1:08:38] we're afraid of being some bold we're
[1:08:41] afraid of being wrong amen and human
[1:08:44] love has all those things but see we're
[1:08:46] promised a divine love amen brother Bram
[1:08:49] talked about this divine love he said if
[1:08:50] I can't disagree with a man bitterly
[1:08:53] come on somebody if I can't disagree
[1:08:57] with a man bitterly amen and still think
[1:09:01] as much of him as Christ would then
[1:09:03] there's something wrong with my spirit I
[1:09:06] haven't got the Spirit of Christ the
[1:09:09] Spirit of Christ means you could
[1:09:10] bitterly disagree with somebody and you
[1:09:12] still think just as much of them as
[1:09:13] Christ does now that's powerful they
[1:09:16] meant that's so far beyond human it and
[1:09:18] you know but we put that so far out of
[1:09:20] reach but I believe this divine love is
[1:09:22] the rightful possession of the bride
[1:09:25] amen I believe his love for us has given
[1:09:28] us the the ability to have his love for
[1:09:30] somebody else
[1:09:31] Amen I just believed that word of what
[1:09:33] we're in the day of divine love and and
[1:09:35] it's available to us in such a way but
[1:09:38] it will take a laying down of our
[1:09:40] humanity because human love is not
[1:09:42] enough amen and many times you know God
[1:09:44] has to have grace on us just like you
[1:09:46] did brother branham and this is a
[1:09:48] comfort to me when I think I put that
[1:09:49] divine love seems so far out of reach
[1:09:52] amen it seems so impossible to love like
[1:09:54] that amen but you know bro Graham told
[1:09:57] the story himself when he was out of
[1:09:59] field in a bowl rushing me man and what
[1:10:02] did that human love do went for the gun
[1:10:05] amen and that's what happens sometime
[1:10:07] when somebody says something just caught
[1:10:10] a cyst so I'm a little funny to you and
[1:10:11] you just go right for the gun hey man
[1:10:15] you just go right for that reaction
[1:10:16] comes out that humanity comes out but
[1:10:18] just wait a little while just pause for
[1:10:21] a moment then what a bro Graham said son
[1:10:23] he said something came he said not from
[1:10:25] in me he didn't say it was from inside
[1:10:28] him out nothing that he had nothing that
[1:10:30] he could muster up but he said something
[1:10:32] projected from somewhere else
[1:10:34] amen and I believe a bride of Jesus
[1:10:36] Christ that will take the time before
[1:10:37] God to say god I'm laying down my
[1:10:39] humanity I don't want to operate on my
[1:10:41] human love I don't want to operate on my
[1:10:43] emotions in my fear and my complexes but
[1:10:46] I want your love amen that's what we
[1:10:49] need brother is to just have the
[1:10:51] patience with one another once in a
[1:10:52] while to let that divine love have a
[1:10:54] chance and project Amen it caused us to
[1:10:57] say things that our humanity wouldn't
[1:10:59] say and caused us to forgive one another
[1:11:01] when our humanity wouldn't do it
[1:11:03] amen to lay down our pride and lay down
[1:11:06] our dignity amen amen and and if you lay
[1:11:10] down your human dignity Amen man God can
[1:11:13] make you a vessel for the power of God
[1:11:15] the power of his love Rodin said all and
[1:11:18] we must have love for one another
[1:11:20] you know brotherly kindness will make a
[1:11:22] real good church but it'll take divine
[1:11:25] love to put a bride together for a
[1:11:27] rapture it'll take you the vine love to
[1:11:29] bring that headstone down and build that
[1:11:31] many membered body and produce
[1:11:33] manifested adopted sons and daughters of
[1:11:35] God only divine love can do that
[1:11:36] amen brotherly kindness won't do it
[1:11:38] friendliness won't do it human love
[1:11:40] won't do it
[1:11:40] amen that's what we've got to see kit
[1:11:42] brother sister we ought to pray for it
[1:11:45] in our church amen we ought to say Lord
[1:11:47] well pour out your love Lord and don't
[1:11:50] start anywhere else but start with me
[1:11:52] Lord let me love my brother love my
[1:11:55] sister and Lord let it let it come into
[1:11:57] this church and let it start right here
[1:11:59] and and Lord let me not have any
[1:12:01] humanity about me but I want to love my
[1:12:03] brother and love my sister in a way that
[1:12:06] goes beyond humanity and and human
[1:12:08] feelings amen
[1:12:09] we ought to love one another how many
[1:12:12] know that old quote word brother brand
[1:12:13] said if God's in your heart you can't
[1:12:15] wait for the church doors to open amen
[1:12:17] you ever read the rest of that quote
[1:12:18] what he said he said if you got God in
[1:12:21] your heart you can't wait for the church
[1:12:23] to open not to hear some good preaching
[1:12:25] that wasn't what he said not to hear
[1:12:27] good doctrine he said you can't hardly
[1:12:29] wait for those doors to open to get in
[1:12:32] here and fellowship with your brothers
[1:12:34] amen to have fellowship one with another
[1:12:37] we ought to love one another church amen
[1:12:40] and I you know I travel around a little
[1:12:42] bit and and you guys I appreciate this
[1:12:44] church here because you're friendly and
[1:12:46] you're loving with one another but seems
[1:12:48] like you go some places and and that
[1:12:50] they dismiss in prayer and the people
[1:12:52] just flee the building nobody wants to
[1:12:54] talk to anybody nobody wants to shake
[1:12:56] their hands and be friendly they just
[1:12:57] want to get out of there and get to
[1:12:59] McDonald's amen
[1:13:00] but there's something about the real
[1:13:01] Bride of Christ real Christian people
[1:13:04] that that we got a love for one another
[1:13:06] and if we don't there's something wrong
[1:13:07] amen if we're not feeling that if we're
[1:13:10] not if we're not if our hearts aren't
[1:13:12] burning the love one to another then
[1:13:14] there's something wrong because if there
[1:13:16] is if there's love anywhere in this
[1:13:18] world it ought to be around the bride of
[1:13:19] Jesus Christ it ought to be in churches
[1:13:22] where the message of the hour is
[1:13:23] preached absolutely oil brother Graham
[1:13:25] said if you don't feel that way toward
[1:13:27] your brother it's time you got to prayin
[1:13:30] if the brother you think he's a little
[1:13:32] wrong or the sister what do you say said
[1:13:34] Lord don't never let the Hat root of
[1:13:37] bitterness spring up amen because it'll
[1:13:40] affect him and it'll take the Christ
[1:13:42] right out of my life you see what he
[1:13:44] said a real Christian amen the brothers
[1:13:46] of little gets a little wrong or the
[1:13:47] sister gets a little off not start with
[1:13:49] them say Lord start with me and don't
[1:13:53] ever let that little root of bitterness
[1:13:54] come in cuz that little root of
[1:13:56] bitterness that little bit of judgmental
[1:13:58] spirit will do more damage than what
[1:14:00] your brother's dealing with it'll do
[1:14:02] more damage than what your sisters
[1:14:04] dealing with What did he say would do he
[1:14:06] said it'll it he said it'll it'll take
[1:14:09] the Christ right out of your life that
[1:14:11] root of bitterness that poison acids of
[1:14:14] malice and jealousy and hatred it will
[1:14:17] take the Holy Spirit right away from you
[1:14:19] and it will run him from the Tabernacle
[1:14:22] here to kill the Spirit of God brother
[1:14:23] Branham said or do or drive it away from
[1:14:25] here hurt your pastor it'll do
[1:14:27] everything but don't you do that love
[1:14:32] one another anyhow
[1:14:34] a man that's what it that's where the
[1:14:37] hard part is is the anyhow love one
[1:14:40] another anyhow you know what a prophet
[1:14:42] said you know how a prophet instructed
[1:14:44] us this isn't this is you know this
[1:14:47] isn't from 1949 or some little some
[1:14:49] little scripture are some little closing
[1:14:51] something this is Christ the mystery of
[1:14:53] God revealed hey man this is one of the
[1:14:55] clearest places where the opening the
[1:14:57] seven seals ever been preached on the
[1:14:59] face of the earth one of the most
[1:15:00] powerful sermons ever preached and
[1:15:01] brother Branham took a little bit of an
[1:15:03] aside in there to tell you something he
[1:15:05] said love one another anyhow and talk
[1:15:08] nice about one another
[1:15:11] hey man we're going back to Sunday
[1:15:14] school tonight top nice about one
[1:15:17] another say nice things about one
[1:15:20] another
[1:15:20] amen it's not that hard but sometimes
[1:15:24] it's hard
[1:15:25] amen but but but I'll say nice things
[1:15:28] about one another
[1:15:29] they men find something nice to say
[1:15:31] about your brother nice about your
[1:15:33] sister say something nice about your
[1:15:35] pastor for the love of God amen
[1:15:37] say something nice to your pastor to the
[1:15:40] preachers to the Deacons to the to the
[1:15:42] musician say something nice and then
[1:15:44] brother Bram said and then God will
[1:15:46] bless you a man that ought to be the
[1:15:48] easiest blessing that we could receive
[1:15:50] let's just say something nice about
[1:15:53] somebody and God will bless you amen
[1:15:56] Alleluia oh my you see human love can't
[1:16:00] do it because human love carries fear
[1:16:03] it carries jealousy envy complexes
[1:16:08] self-importance and and the way that I
[1:16:10] believe that perfect love God's love
[1:16:12] casts out fear is because is because
[1:16:15] that most of our fear comes from
[1:16:17] self-importance and so it takes to
[1:16:20] laying aside of that self-important
[1:16:22] spirit to manifest the love of God
[1:16:23] because if you're too big how could God
[1:16:25] ever magnify himself in your life he
[1:16:27] can't do it but see wherever there's
[1:16:29] self-importance now there's different
[1:16:32] kinds of self-importance there's one
[1:16:33] that said oh I'm a somebody you know how
[1:16:35] could that brother say that to me don't
[1:16:37] they know who I am and how could the
[1:16:38] pastor not shake my hand doesn't he know
[1:16:40] who I am and then there's another one
[1:16:42] that says well you know well you know
[1:16:44] nobody cares about me and nobody thinks
[1:16:46] about you know and I got all these
[1:16:48] problems I'm never going to be an
[1:16:49] overcomer and I can never you know I can
[1:16:52] I'll never be anybody in a church nobody
[1:16:53] wants to hear me and then you see you
[1:16:56] know somebody somebody in the back
[1:16:58] corner and they're talking and laughing
[1:17:00] and you think yourself I know they're
[1:17:03] talking about me
[1:17:05] you didn't know that was selfishness did
[1:17:07] you but it is because it's self-centered
[1:17:10] its self-absorbed it's it's self facing
[1:17:14] Amen but we're not to be selfish at all
[1:17:16] we're to look to Jesus amen and amen and
[1:17:19] so we think that way but you know they
[1:17:20] haven't talked about you or thought
[1:17:21] about you and weeks but you're so
[1:17:24] self-important you thought you think
[1:17:26] everybody's talking bad about you and
[1:17:27] everybody's worried about you but you
[1:17:29] know the reality is most people are
[1:17:30] worried about their own problems too
[1:17:33] much to worry about you amen amen
[1:17:35] so look at yourself look at myself say
[1:17:39] Lord start with me start with me amen
[1:17:43] amens but see that it's that fear it's
[1:17:47] that self-importance that self-absorbed
[1:17:49] spirit that's what causes people to lash
[1:17:51] out so what causes a problem is because
[1:17:53] we're it's why we can't love one another
[1:17:55] cuz we're too important hey man but and
[1:17:58] and one of Satan's greatest weapons
[1:18:00] comes that way you know one of Satan's
[1:18:02] greatest tools is a what about spirit

[1:21:52] tell us where we're wrong that's what
[1:21:53] separates a son from a sinner amen
[1:21:55] that's what separates a legitimate heir
[1:21:58] of God to an illegitimate and the Bible
[1:22:00] says he scourgeth every son that he

[1:24:39] only the sick that demand attention it's
[1:24:43] only the sick he said every church
[1:24:44] member that wants attention says oh I
[1:24:46] must somebody he said just remember
[1:24:48] that's a spiritual sick person that one
[1:24:51] that wants all the attention they want
[1:24:52] everybody's eyes on them that's somebody
[1:24:53] was spiritually sick they need the
[1:24:56] attention of the Spirit of God to give

[1:25:19] amen don't don't don't don't pour it on
[1:25:22] anybody else but Lord let the blood wash
[1:25:24] me tonight start with me start with me
[1:25:28] amen amen you know what it inspired me
[1:25:33] on this on this sermon and beginning to
[1:25:37] come down to a close tonight but I was
[1:25:39] just listening to it and I believe it's
[1:25:41] where where I was inspired with the
[1:25:43] title for tonight but I was listen to a
[1:25:45] story brother Branham tells I think he
[1:25:47] tells it a few times and and it's
[1:25:48] familiar to you no doubt but but the
[1:25:50] part that struck me is a little bit
[1:25:52] manat the part that usually we focus on
[1:25:55] with this story but brother Branham was
[1:25:57] having his healing campaigns you know
[1:25:58] when miracles were being done and and
[1:26:00] and he went into a place I can't
[1:26:02] remember if it was a section of at the
[1:26:05] meeting or if he'd gone to a hospital or
[1:26:07] what it was but came into a place where
[1:26:09] there was there was there was a bunch of
[1:26:11] mentally ill people would people with
[1:26:13] serious problems so he comes in this
[1:26:15] place and hears people in
[1:26:16] straightjackets and people screaming and
[1:26:19] and in epileptic fits and horrible cases
[1:26:22] severe cases and and all around all
[1:26:25] these all these things and and you know
[1:26:27] the story how how the brother branham
[1:26:29] comes in there and and he's looking
[1:26:30] around at all these all these hard cases
[1:26:33] and bad situations and there's a young
[1:26:35] lady sitting there brother BAM turns her
[1:26:38] he said she was a nice-looking young
[1:26:39] lady look real put together just was
[1:26:41] just a lovely-looking a lady in and he
[1:26:46] she said can I help you sir brother
[1:26:47] Graham said brother Graham said well I
[1:26:50] just I don't know where to start
[1:26:52] I don't know where to start there's so
[1:26:54] many bad cases so many thing I just I
[1:26:56] don't know where to start and here's a
[1:26:58] young lady and this is what this is what
[1:27:00] struck my heart said here here she on
[1:27:03] the outside she's looking all put
[1:27:05] together the way that we put in all we
[1:27:07] put in so much effort to come to church
[1:27:09] and look all put together and look like
[1:27:11] everything's ok and we're not we got no
[1:27:13] problems and there's nothing wrong in
[1:27:15] our lives
[1:27:16] and we go to such lengths to project
[1:27:18] that image but but see there was
[1:27:20] something in her heart a desperation she
[1:27:23] said brother branham i wish you'd start
[1:27:25] with me where the band i'm i'd like you
[1:27:28] to start with me and i hear as she
[1:27:30] begins to share her life and things in
[1:27:32] her past and brought on a nervous
[1:27:34] condition and here she's a backslidden
[1:27:36] state and she and her life's in shambles
[1:27:38] and and she looked so put together that
[1:27:41] he even surprised the profit but but but
[1:27:44] see she had the desperation she had the
[1:27:46] humility to say brother branham don't
[1:27:49] start over there don't start with that
[1:27:50] one or this one but start with me
[1:27:52] amen and i I wonder if there's somebody
[1:27:55] here tonight a man with enough humility
[1:27:57] in your heart say and say Lord I know
[1:27:58] that there's a there's serious things
[1:28:00] going on and serious problems and
[1:28:03] serious needs but lord if you're gonna
[1:28:04] start with anybody tonight please start
[1:28:07] with me lord please start with my
[1:28:09] problems start here in my heart and all
[1:28:12] God I it's me Lord standing in the need
[1:28:16] hallelujah Amen it takes that
[1:28:19] desperation takes that desperation takes
[1:28:22] that willingness to be a nobody to be
[1:28:24] not a not to be important not to look
[1:28:26] put together but the humility before God
[1:28:28] sometimes even go to an altar you know
[1:28:30] we don't always go to altars anymore we
[1:28:32] don't have altar calls anymore because
[1:28:34] because we're we're too dignified you
[1:28:36] know and we're too important oh that's
[1:28:38] some old you know that's the mold
[1:28:39] Methodist tradition or something like
[1:28:41] that but but sometimes it just takes
[1:28:43] that unction there not that humility
[1:28:45] that that that willingness say Lord I
[1:28:47] don't care what anybody else thinks lord
[1:28:49] I need to make a move before God and I
[1:28:51] need to get to that altar and pray or
[1:28:54] whatever it is I need to go apologize to
[1:28:56] my wife apologize to my pastor lord
[1:28:59] and just start with me start with my
[1:29:02] problem Olivia let's all stand a man god
[1:29:06] bless you've been gracious with me
[1:29:08] tonight I want to I want to close with
[1:29:10] this quote
[1:29:12] I may have read it here but in the past
[1:29:14] it's one of my favorite quotes from the
[1:29:16] Great Commission I think it's so
[1:29:18] powerful in any church to any human
[1:29:20] being brother Graham said if you want to
[1:29:22] be a blessing and get a blessing when a
[1:29:27] man has done you wrong
[1:29:30] and he absolutely justly I mean he has
[1:29:35] done you wrong and you know that he's
[1:29:37] done you wrong he's done you evil
[1:29:41] don't mention that oh my prophet said
[1:29:46] don't mention that but you take him to
[1:29:49] prayer before God and don't take it in a
[1:29:52] selfish way and say well I'm supposed to
[1:29:54] do this but stand with your shoulder to
[1:29:56] his shoulder and stand in the presence
[1:29:58] of God our Father amen and say father
[1:30:01] here's my brother and he absolutely he
[1:30:05] justly deserves punishment because he's
[1:30:07] done me evil and I don't see why he did
[1:30:09] it
[1:30:09] watch it watch how a prophet deals it he
[1:30:13] said and then let God go talking to you
[1:30:16] let God go talking to you and and you'll
[1:30:19] see maybe what that man's been through
[1:30:21] and the devil's twisted him up somewhere
[1:30:25] and caused him to do that and though
[1:30:26] he's absolutely wrong
[1:30:28] before you leave the throne of God
[1:30:30] you'll be feeling sorry for that man
[1:30:32] you'll be sympathizing with that brother
[1:30:35] and when you get down to earth again
[1:30:37] you'll go over to that brother and shake
[1:30:39] his hand because you know what he's been
[1:30:41] through and you can't stand with a
[1:30:44] mortal in the presence of God and
[1:30:46] condemn anybody even if he's a rank
[1:30:50] sooner
[1:30:53] judge not that you be not judged amen
[1:30:58] brother Bram said we'll take him to the
[1:31:01] throne of God and stand there shoulder
[1:31:02] to shoulder with our brother knowing
[1:31:04] that he's immortal and maybe his
[1:31:05] destination rests on our attitude
[1:31:07] towards him when we come back from the
[1:31:09] throne of God will realize that where
[1:31:11] everyone guilty and we all need help one
[1:31:14] from the other and the best way to do it
[1:31:16] brother Bram said is to pray let's pray
[1:31:18] tonight amen maybe there'd be a lifted
[1:31:21] hand I could lift my hand tonight say
[1:31:23] Lord I want you to start with me Lord
[1:31:26] I've got problems I've got issues
[1:31:29] I've got fears Lord I've got complexes
[1:31:31] Lord I think too much myself
[1:31:34] and Lord I try so hard to hide from a
[1:31:38] hide my problems from everybody else but
[1:31:40] tonight Lord I'm letting down the wall
[1:31:42] I'm opening the curtain I'm opening the
[1:31:45] door to you and Lord just start here
[1:31:47] Lord and and touch me tonight o God I
[1:31:50] pray for every heart every hand that's
[1:31:52] raised Lord that your Holy Spirit would
[1:31:54] calm in a in a gentle and in a special
[1:31:57] way tonight father and speak to us Lord
[1:31:59] for we have needs we have problems Lord
[1:32:03] we have weaknesses we have issues we
[1:32:05] have besetting sins and Lord we're just
[1:32:07] asking for your help tonight Lord and if
[1:32:09] there's anyone here that's holding onto
[1:32:11] that root of bitterness Lord and Lord
[1:32:13] don't let that be a problem in the
[1:32:15] church but Lord uprooted tonight I say
[1:32:18] Lord strip for me all humanity all hurt
[1:32:21] all complexes all bitterness Lord and Oh
[1:32:24] let me be free from these things Lord
[1:32:26] and and let not me me as somebody but
[1:32:29] Lord let you have the preeminence in my
[1:32:30] life let you be the great one father and
