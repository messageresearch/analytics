[45:18] receive what I have to say I just want
[45:24] you to know that every time I stand
[45:26] before you I really feel nervous because
[45:30] you know it's not easy to preach to
[45:34] Americans in a language that I don't
[45:40] really use in my country you know I
[45:43] never preach in English in our country
[45:45] that's risen 2 weeks before coming over
[45:49] sister Chi Chi heard me reading out my
[45:53] devotions out loud in English just the
[45:58] kind of practice my loose in my town so
[46:03] if I mispronounce some of the words I
[46:07] hope you understand
[46:10] First Lord oh well first let me share
[46:16] with you for just a few minutes then you
[46:19] open
[46:20] [Music]
[46:28] or open to us and we're now work working
[46:33] with this community and I entitled the
[46:37] resettled eight community this place is
[46:43] in Mount Pinatubo in some ballast
[46:46] Philippines you remember there was a
[46:51] great eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991
[46:56] this is supposed to be the second
[47:00] biggest eruption of the century and was
[47:08] so big that the ash we live in Manila
[47:18] about four hours drive from this place
[47:21] but there was an inch of asphalt in our
[47:25] roof and in the windowsills I I was told
[47:29] that asks from this volcano eruption
[47:34] even reach as far as Indonesia and
[47:36] Malaysia was so big widespread and a lot
[47:42] of people were displaced see that's the
[47:47] kind of people that were trying to run
[47:49] away from the heat mud flow and it
[47:52] buried from what I understand 13
[47:56] municipalities in the area and the
[48:02] people that were affected the most are
[48:05] the itis itis are they're like little
[48:10] African brothers you know they look
[48:12] exactly like our our optic African
[48:15] brothers only they're smaller much
[48:17] smaller and that's how they look so they
[48:24] were displaced and government did a lot
[48:29] did their best to resettle them
[48:34] gave them grounds where they can build
[48:37] their house and you know start their
[48:42] lives anew but you see the the the I
[48:46] test this is we call them our output
[48:50] genes
[48:51] this is our this our this tribe our our
[48:55] ancestors there are the roots of the
[48:59] Filipino race they live they live mostly
[49:09] by hunting farming and were the
[49:13] government resettled them they couldn't
[49:15] do anything any of that you know so 16
[49:22] years after the eruption some of them
[49:25] started going back to where they used to
[49:27] be right at the foot of it the volcano
[49:30] and started planting things and they
[49:33] found out that years after the eruption
[49:39] the ground has become very very fertile
[49:43] and so now some of them have become
[49:47] moved back to where they used to live
[49:50] and here's how the the crater looks now
[49:59] it's a beautiful place now it's now a
[50:01] tourist spot worth a lot of tourists
[50:04] come to see the beautiful scenery now
[50:13] the brother the man second to the left
[50:19] is better Paul I baptized him 12 years
[50:24] ago in some ballast along with 70 70
[50:31] other eye tests or people that belong to
[50:34] the eye the community Aitu tribe but I
[50:40] wasn't able to do any follow-up work on
[50:43] them you know because the place was just
[50:44] too far from Manila
[50:47] and hard-to-reach but out of the blue
[50:51] two months ago
[50:54] brother Paul came to my church and he
[51:00] brought with him three of his workers in
[51:04] the church I found out that he had
[51:05] became he had become a pastor of some
[51:08] Korean church and he went to Bible
[51:12] School but he said better oh well you
[51:14] know what
[51:15] the things that I heard from you when
[51:17] you presented a message to us I held it
[51:21] dearly in my heart
[51:23] he said that was just so special and we
[51:31] came here today to learn more about the
[51:34] message and so and then he told me that
[51:41] two hundred families of his tribe he
[51:46] mainly leads this whole tribe of itis or
[51:50] Negritos we call him have moved back to
[51:55] Mount Pinatubo where they used to live
[51:57] and they are starting a community and so
[52:04] we went and visited them in some ballast
[52:09] after we they stayed in our in our
[52:13] church for about a week and I told them
[52:17] more about the message and they were
[52:19] just so so happy to learn more about
[52:22] message and after that they took me to
[52:25] some ballast and we devised a plan
[52:30] because they're asking me the request is
[52:33] for us to be able to start a church in
[52:35] the new community were there they are
[52:39] resettling so our church will be the
[52:43] first church to ever build the church in
[52:47] that community praise the Lord for that
[52:56] and we had to haha rent this vehicle
[53:04] here which is the it's a specially
[53:12] designed vehicle for the two to be using
[53:19] the car fields of Pinatubo no other
[53:23] vehicle can make it I mean even the 4x4
[53:28] vehicles the new ones they can't make it
[53:31] because the road is just too rough so
[53:34] here you can see us preparing to live we
[53:39] brought some supplies to give out to the
[53:43] people that are already residing in the
[53:47] area some of the workers in our church
[53:51] wanted me about 7 of them wanted me
[53:56] travel with me to the area and here we
[54:01] are preparing to go to the place and
[54:10] when we left it was raining hard and
[54:14] then it and then it changed became very
[54:19] hot you know and you see the
[54:26] mission-team bearing the heat of the Sun
[54:31] after the rain now here's one of the
[54:36] huts that they that Negrito Magneto's
[54:43] have started to build in the area this
[54:45] is one of them and this is the place
[54:49] they were they were pointing to me the
[54:52] place where they want us to build a
[54:54] church so we want to thank the Lord for
[54:58] that that he has made a way amen we did
[55:01] not look for it they were the ones
[55:04] the Negrito community were the ones who
[55:06] requested that we build a church in
[55:08] their area so we want to thank the Lord
[55:12] for that and he moved upon the hearts of
[55:16] the leaders but Paul was one of the
[55:18] leaders one of the illness of the whole
[55:20] community and they agreed to receive us
[55:26] and to support whatever we want to do in
[55:30] the air in the community as far as
[55:32] evangelism is concerned here are the
[55:37] some of the men in the community and
[55:42] this is pastoral arena she's a woman
[55:46] preacher
[55:47] she's with the Pentecostal Church but
[55:51] she's a good woman preacher I believe in
[55:58] women preachers you know because good
[56:01] women preachers when they see in the
[56:03] world that they can preach they stop but
[56:11] here she received us gladly and pledged
[56:15] to do whatever she could she can to help
[56:20] us in reaching out to their tribe
[56:25] hallelujah and that's another house
[56:31] there that's they've started to build in
[56:35] the area and this is the Chieftains
[56:38] house and that mainly made of bamboo and
[56:41] grass grass roof and this is the road
[56:49] here you see if you miss if you live in
[56:56] this area and you miss the they call it
[56:59] the weapon carrier it's like a war
[57:01] machine
[57:03] the vehicle that we use is like a war
[57:07] machine but it runs the route once a day
[57:11] and and if the residents miss it you get
[57:15] to rise the you get to ride the cargo
[57:17] cart you see the car back on in the
[57:19] background so instead of three hours you
[57:25] get to ride the carbo cart for about
[57:27] five hours five or six hours anyway
[57:31] because we have to go across the rivers
[57:34] you have to cross this river six times
[57:37] before we can reach the area working
[57:39] here and here are the eight children and
[57:50] this children have to walk two hours to
[57:53] go to school and wait the nearest quiz
[57:56] two hours away to reach their place you
[58:00] cannot go on this vehicle we call it the
[58:07] Skylab you know Filipinos are very
[58:13] creative there's ten people in this
[58:16] scooter
[58:17] it's just a small 150cc scooter but
[58:21] there's ten people in there in that
[58:24] scooter on that scooter or on this this
[58:32] is a tricycle there's probably 15 or 16
[58:36] people there but you see the condition
[58:41] of the roads you know when the volcano
[58:47] erupted this you cannot see any green
[58:51] thing everything was grey because of the
[58:55] asphalt and the sand that came out of
[58:57] the volcano but now it's a beautiful
[59:01] place you see it's like paradise
[59:05] so one family was given I think two
[59:09] acres of land to tell and so far there
[59:13] are two
[59:14] families that move in the area it's a
[59:19] place called bagong Silang and and in
[59:21] our language Vavoom salon and means the
[59:24] place of the new birth and you can see
[59:36] here how that pops sorry the this man
[59:42] are carrying steel ramps were putting it
[59:46] beneath the tires of our vehicle so that
[59:50] it would not stall in the mud in the
[59:54] Ratna Hartfield
[59:55] we call the mud flow la Jara all it is
[59:59] is sand and mud and ash that's how
[1:00:07] beautiful the place is now see the
[1:00:10] crater becomes a beautiful lake and
[1:00:14] here's the community right here we held
[1:00:20] the service in this building it's a
[1:00:24] multi-purpose building and when I go
[1:00:28] back we'll be will start digging a well
[1:00:31] and we we've asked them to start
[1:00:38] producing the cement blocks because
[1:00:42] there's no problem getting the sand
[1:00:45] because it's everything sent over there
[1:00:47] so we just supply cement and maybe some
[1:00:56] reinforcement bars iron and we will
[1:01:00] start building the church when we go
[1:01:02] back so please remember us in prayer
[1:01:05] okay and I thank you for supporting our
[1:01:09] missionary endeavor but the bill just
[1:01:12] sent me mission money I think two months
[1:01:15] ago for our plantation rubber plantation
[1:01:18] that we started last year and because
[1:01:23] somebody donated the 43 hectares and
[1:01:27] that
[1:01:28] about 86 acres of property to our church
[1:01:33] and we are now converting it to a rubber
[1:01:37] plantation which in five or seven years
[1:01:41] time will be ilding sap from the rubber
[1:01:45] no producing rubber and it can yield
[1:01:51] about a couple thousand dollars per acre
[1:01:55] on a per hectare two that's two acres
[1:01:59] per hectare so this project you pray
[1:02:04] with us because this project will be the
[1:02:09] Lord tarries it will be able to support
[1:02:12] the missionary work in our country and
[1:02:16] there's just so many work to be done in
[1:02:22] the island of Palawan alone were we
[1:02:24] where we have the plantation we are
[1:02:28] doing follow-up work or 60 groups these
[1:02:32] were denominational groups that came out
[1:02:34] of their organization and they has
[1:02:36] embraced the truth of the message 60
[1:02:40] just on one Island alone and there are
[1:02:44] other groups in many different parts of
[1:02:47] our country that have received a message
[1:02:49] as a result of the mr. expose seminars
[1:02:53] that we do amongst the denominational
[1:02:56] ministers in our country so remember to
[1:03:00] pray for us amen god bless you and now
[1:03:06] I'm gonna go to the message and it's not
[1:03:15] really a sermon it's just a Bible study
[1:03:21] to kind of remind you of some of the
[1:03:25] some of the scriptures that refer to our
[1:03:28] time and day that we're living in and
[1:03:31] some of the things that the Prophet said
[1:03:33] about the ministry of the bride
[1:03:39] hallelujah banaram says the bride in the
[1:03:49] last days will do the greater works you
[1:03:53] believe that hallelujah shall we all
[1:03:58] stand and read the scriptures the book
[1:04:03] of st. John chapter 14 and verse 12 says
[1:04:09] verily verily I say unto you he that
[1:04:15] believeth on me the works that I do
[1:04:18] shall he do also and greater works than
[1:04:22] this shall he do because I go unto my
[1:04:27] father now he received that the Lord's
[1:04:34] work the Lord Jesus Christ worked on
[1:04:37] earth was an unfinished work because he
[1:04:42] left the church something to do there's
[1:04:46] something for you and me to do
[1:04:48] we're not wait we're not here just
[1:04:52] waiting for him to come back there's we
[1:04:54] have to do something there is what we
[1:04:58] call a ministry of the bride
[1:05:10] in the book of Acts chapter 1 verse 1
[1:05:13] and 2 says the former treaties have I
[1:05:18] made or Theophilus of all that Jesus
[1:05:21] began both to do and teach now st. Luke
[1:05:27] I understand was the one who wrote this
[1:05:31] verse 2 says until the day with which he
[1:05:34] was taken taken up after that he through
[1:05:39] the Holy Ghost had given Commandments
[1:05:42] and to the apostles whom he had chosen a
[1:05:47] man let's pray Heavenly Father we thank
[1:05:50] you Lord for your word thank you for
[1:05:53] this evening that you have gathered us
[1:05:56] together once again to this place Lord
[1:05:58] to hear from your word father we ask for
[1:06:02] the Holy Spirit to come may you send the
[1:06:04] anointing both to the speaker and the
[1:06:06] hearer alike and we pray that you
[1:06:10] minister to us the power of the Holy
[1:06:12] Spirit made which every believer in this
[1:06:16] sanctuary this evening and may meet
[1:06:18] every meal how physical or spiritual
[1:06:22] where we commit all things into your
[1:06:24] hands and promised to give you all the
[1:06:26] praise and glory and honor in the name
[1:06:28] of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen
[1:06:31] BBC sovereign Berta Burnham expounded on
[1:06:46] the book of Acts chapter 1 and 2 chapter
[1:06:49] 1 verse 1 and 2 he said this you
[1:06:55] remember the former treatise o
[1:06:57] Theophilus have I wrote unto you quoting
[1:07:01] the book of Acts that Jesus what that
[1:07:04] Jesus began to do and continues to do
[1:07:07] his death did not stop him no sir he
[1:07:13] returned again not a third person but
[1:07:17] the same person returned back again in
[1:07:20] the form of the Holy Ghost you believe
[1:07:22] that
[1:07:22] and it continues to work on and
[1:07:28] continuous on said the book of Acts and
[1:07:31] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:07:34] and forever
[1:07:35] that's the token bambam says that's the
[1:07:39] sign and he continues on said the book
[1:07:42] of Acts so the work of God continues on
[1:07:47] through the church so when you look at
[1:07:52] the title page of the book of Acts it
[1:07:54] says the Acts of the Apostles but I'm
[1:07:56] said its it really is the acts of the
[1:07:59] Holy Spirit in the lives of the Apostles
[1:08:02] um so we read in the book of Acts how
[1:08:06] they taught the word how they ministered
[1:08:09] to the poor and heal the sick and cast
[1:08:12] out demons exactly like the Lord Jesus
[1:08:17] prophesied when he was alive said if you
[1:08:20] believe in me the works that I do will
[1:08:23] continue you will do also the works that
[1:08:26] I do the same work she will do and he
[1:08:29] didn't stop there he said greater works
[1:08:31] than they shall you do because I go to
[1:08:34] the Father our conclusion is the church
[1:08:38] now is the continuation of the Ministry
[1:08:42] of the Lord Jesus Christ on earth and it
[1:08:45] will continue on until he returns back
[1:08:48] to earth hallelujah
[1:08:50] to take the bride away there is such a
[1:08:56] thing as the ministry of the bride but
[1:09:00] what venemous asked the question would
[1:09:03] the Bride of Christ have a ministry
[1:09:06] before the rapture and the answer was
[1:09:09] sure that is what is going on right now
[1:09:14] it started when brother Branham was here
[1:09:18] you see the Bride of Christ certainly it
[1:09:22] is the message of the hour
[1:09:26] the ministry of the bride is the message
[1:09:29] of the hour hallelujah
[1:09:33] it's not some denomination that's why I
[1:09:37] wonder about these people who after
[1:09:38] hearing the message and believing the
[1:09:41] message for so many years turned their
[1:09:42] backs and give the message but God is
[1:09:48] doing something through the bride to
[1:09:51] people that have recognized their day
[1:09:53] and the age that they're living in and
[1:09:55] they received the word for their day
[1:09:58] this is the message of the hour see the
[1:10:01] Bride of Christ sure she's consisted of
[1:10:05] apostles prophets teachers evangelists
[1:10:09] and pastors is that way
[1:10:11] that's the Bride of Christ sure she's
[1:10:15] got a ministry it is a great ministry
[1:10:19] it's the ministry of the hour and I'm
[1:10:22] gonna talk about that ministry today
[1:10:24] tonight to you
[1:10:26] yeah and better BAM said then this
[1:10:28] ministry is will be so humble hey man it
[1:10:36] would be so humble so we see that the
[1:10:48] the work of the Lord continued on for
[1:10:50] 2,000 years
[1:10:52] since the day of Pentecost and at the
[1:10:56] end of two thousand years where BAM said
[1:10:59] there's gonna be a bride aged he said we
[1:11:06] are not living in a Pentecostal age
[1:11:09] no this is different age matter package
[1:11:13] said the church ages are over this this
[1:11:17] is not included in the church ages this
[1:11:20] is a different age see we're not living
[1:11:23] in a Methodist age we're living in
[1:11:25] another age we're living up here on the
[1:11:28] bride age
[1:11:30] the calling out of the church and
[1:11:33] getting it together for the rapture this
[1:11:36] is what's going on right now the church
[1:11:40] is ministering I take that bad the Holy
[1:11:43] Spirit is ministering to the bride
[1:11:47] hallelujah and getting the bride ready
[1:11:49] and getting it together for the rapture
[1:11:52] that stage that we're living in right
[1:11:55] now to my honest opinion verbum said
[1:11:58] that's exactly the truth this is Jesus
[1:12:05] in Bride form you know the
[1:12:13] denominational world they're waiting for
[1:12:15] Jesus to come back again because Jesus
[1:12:17] said I will come again what they don't
[1:12:20] know is he is here he just changed his
[1:12:28] form this is the same Jesus in bride for
[1:12:33] me let me read it to you but you
[1:12:35] remember when it went down and the grain
[1:12:38] begin to ripen that you find before that
[1:12:41] grain can ripen everything in that stock
[1:12:44] has to be dead
[1:12:46] hallelujah can't you see we are where we
[1:12:49] are standing life is in the grain again
[1:12:53] what is it just exactly like the same
[1:12:56] grain that went into the ground amen
[1:13:01] the very same grain that went into the
[1:13:04] ground the same Jesus in bride form one
[1:13:12] grain went into the ground but the wheat
[1:13:17] plant came forward and in the end a
[1:13:20] cluster of grain appeared it's the same
[1:13:24] grain the same life the same Jesus only
[1:13:28] it's multiplied
[1:13:31] it's the same Jesus in bright form
[1:13:35] hallelujah
[1:13:36] the same word sucked up through this and
[1:13:41] come out here and come to a head here
[1:13:44] and all that life come through here pick
[1:13:48] up its people
[1:13:49] now it's forming up into a head for the
[1:13:54] rapture I believe that with all my heart
[1:13:57] and then better been better been
[1:14:02] explained the word and morphe God and
[1:14:05] more feet the changing of mass God's
[1:14:08] simply changes his mask he said who is
[1:14:12] this no kiss addict he said this in this
[1:14:14] way God and Murphy mask in the pillar of
[1:14:19] fire who is that mirror fire who is
[1:14:21] behind the pillar of fire it's God he's
[1:14:24] masking himself in the form of that
[1:14:26] pillar of fire and God in morphe in a
[1:14:30] man called Jesus who is that man called
[1:14:37] Jesus none other than supreme deity
[1:14:41] hallelujah God in morphe then it says
[1:14:45] God and morphe in his church it is God
[1:14:51] changing his form changes my mask
[1:14:54] now his mask is his church hallelujah is
[1:14:59] that God above us God with us
[1:15:02] now it's God in us the condescending of
[1:15:07] God God has come descended into the
[1:15:10] hearts of believers what is it it's God
[1:15:15] himself supreme deity and morphe
[1:15:19] changing his mask hiding behind the
[1:15:22] church manifesting is very life and
[1:15:25] power through the church the believers
[1:15:29] of the message of the our Alleluia I
[1:15:33] don't know if you noticed this but it
[1:15:36] got my intention when the in the seven
[1:15:41] church ages
[1:15:44] better Banham he said that there was one
[1:15:50] that there was a man John saw a man
[1:15:53] walking in the midst of the golden
[1:15:54] candlestick we all know that's Jesus
[1:15:58] Christ right this is the son of God the
[1:16:01] Son of Man that's Jesus Christ walking
[1:16:04] in the midst of the seven Church ages he
[1:16:08] seen their meets right now but listen to
[1:16:11] what Darwin said in this quotation 1954
[1:16:16] now that's the Bible that's what the
[1:16:20] Spirit says see their candlesticks all
[1:16:23] right now the 13th verse and in the
[1:16:26] midst of the seven golden candlesticks
[1:16:29] is one like the son of man and then he
[1:16:33] expounds what one like him cause this he
[1:16:39] said the bride his bride one like him
[1:16:45] it's not really here but it's one like
[1:16:47] him hallelujah
[1:16:50] what's how it was clothed with a garment
[1:16:52] down to the foot the holiness of Jesus
[1:16:56] Christ covering her has washed us from
[1:16:59] our sins with his own blood
[1:17:01] all right great about the paps paps is a
[1:17:05] woman's breast his everyone says not a
[1:17:10] man it's a woman this son of man is a
[1:17:15] woman oh my goodness oh my goodness with
[1:17:23] a golden girdle the gospel that held the
[1:17:27] power and glory of God over the body of
[1:17:30] Christ
[1:17:32] hallelujah he's saying the person that
[1:17:35] was walking in the midst of the seven
[1:17:37] golden candlesticks
[1:17:39] is the bride
[1:17:42] is like the son of man not the son of
[1:17:46] man per se but one like the son of man
[1:17:49] one like him he's the word there for
[1:17:53] this bride must be the Word of God
[1:17:55] hallelujah one exactly like him oh my I
[1:18:01] love him don't you
[1:18:08] so now we see the combination of the Old
[1:18:11] Testament the Old Testament which is
[1:18:15] mainly the law do this don't do this
[1:18:21] it's actually the male part of the Bible
[1:18:25] the strictness of the male demand the
[1:18:29] husband you know most rules come from
[1:18:35] the father of the house and his trick
[1:18:41] too and when it comes to implementing
[1:18:43] the rules so the law is God's rules and
[1:18:51] we see the ending of the law at the
[1:18:55] ending of the law and the law ended
[1:18:56] Jesus appeared in the flesh because
[1:19:01] really God showed us that Jesus was the
[1:19:08] very idea of the law only Jesus could
[1:19:13] fulfill the law no one else could do it
[1:19:18] and we see the combination or the ending
[1:19:22] of the Old Testament with Christ coming
[1:19:26] in the form of flesh that's the
[1:19:29] combination of the law and then came the
[1:19:32] New Testament what is that that's the
[1:19:35] female part of the book grace
[1:19:41] like the mother is more gracious than
[1:19:43] the father when the children gets a
[1:19:50] spanking from the father they run to the
[1:19:52] mother they know where grace is so let
[1:20:01] me tell you what grace is actually no
[1:20:04] one could fulfill no one was able to
[1:20:07] fulfill the law to the letter so God
[1:20:12] said I'm going to change my covenant I'm
[1:20:14] gonna make you a new Anu and your
[1:20:16] agreement now a new contract what I'm
[1:20:20] gonna do
[1:20:20] I'll send my spirit into your hearts so
[1:20:25] that I will actually be dwelling in you
[1:20:28] and I will be performing and I will be

[1:21:41] we see it's the bride manifesting in
[1:21:45] flesh the Bride of Christ appearing on
[1:21:49] the scene Alleluia why because the Bride
[1:21:53] of Christ is the combination of grace us
[1:21:57] Jesus was the combination of law then
[1:22:01] the female part now grace the
[1:22:04] culmination of grace is the brighter
[1:22:06] price that's why we're here in the last
[1:22:11] H we are here if we come to the scene
[1:22:14] hallelujah come on the scene hallelujah
[1:22:20] Myrtle berm costs this the bride coming
[1:22:22] of Christ hallelujah I love it he said
[1:22:31] as Christ was the first one to raise
[1:22:33] from their problems on the profits and
[1:22:35] so forth all those type in many places
[1:22:38] he was the first fruits of this that
[1:22:40] slab of those that's left in the bride
[1:22:43] coming of Christ oh my what kind of a
[1:22:49] language is this the bride coming of
[1:22:53] Christ they talk about the second coming
[1:22:59] but Berman talks about the bride coming
[1:23:02] of Christ hallelujah coming out of the
[1:23:05] church haven't we all
[1:23:09] there'll have to be a sheep wait again
[1:23:12] wave it again that's the cluster of
[1:23:14] ripened grain

[1:23:25] but this bride is going to have a
[1:23:27] ministry in the last days
[1:23:30] Alleluia hallelujah verbum said I'm sure
[1:23:34] you see what I'm talking about
[1:23:36] it was waved over the people the first
[1:23:40] time that will come forth for the bride
[1:23:43] aids for a resurrection of a out of dark
[1:23:47] denominationalism will be a message that
[1:23:51] the full maturity of the word has turned
[1:23:54] back again in its full power and being
[1:23:57] waved over the people bothered by the
[1:23:59] same signs and wonders that he did back
[1:24:03] there of mine we have arrived this is
[1:24:11] the bride coming of Christ hallelujah
[1:24:14] denominational people they're still
[1:24:16] waiting hallelujah but he is here oh my
[1:24:23] I'm so glad that he has come he did not
[1:24:27] come back for denominational people he
[1:24:31] did not come back for religious groups
[1:24:34] but he came back for the bride
[1:24:38] hallelujah and Balram said seven church
[1:24:45] ages when the bride will get back to
[1:24:47] being a war bride she will produce the
[1:24:51] very works that Jesus produced
[1:24:55] Oh what's the purpose of the message the
[1:25:02] message came to turn our hearts back to
[1:25:06] our fathers again to bring back the
[1:25:10] original life that has been initially
[1:25:13] manifested on the day of Pentecost when
[1:25:17] they were baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:25:20] and vanna vanna explained to us but the
[1:25:22] Holy Ghost was it was a very life of God
[1:25:25] it's the very life of God manifested in
[1:25:28] Christ the very life that he manifested
[1:25:30] we are to manifest the same here on
[1:25:34] earth hallelujah and we are to become
[1:25:39] the word bright you read in the Bible
[1:25:45] where we are discouraged from marrying
[1:25:48] unbelievers don't yoke yourself up with
[1:25:52] people who don't believe hallelujah
[1:25:56] even before the Israelites came to the
[1:26:03] promised land Moses commanded them not
[1:26:05] to marry the Haydn's the hidden people
[1:26:09] that they're going to find living in
[1:26:11] Canaan hallelujah
[1:26:13] but marry amongst themselves Alleluia
[1:26:19] don't Mar the seedling hallelujah don't
[1:26:27] marry unbelievers so Jesus commanded
[1:26:31] that the word commanded at her and he's
[1:26:35] our example Jesus will not marry a
[1:26:39] denominational Church Jesus can only
[1:26:43] marry the word bride
[1:26:49] amen if you are not the word then he
[1:26:53] will have nothing to do with you you
[1:26:55] must be the word in order to marry the
[1:26:58] word hallelujah
[1:27:04] he said I'm gonna make a people likened
[1:27:10] unto myself he said in in exposition of
[1:27:13] church seven Church ages it was God's
[1:27:15] purpose too big for the people like unto
[1:27:18] himself that would be a word breifing
[1:27:23] say that with me word right it's a word
[1:27:28] bride she was chosen before the
[1:27:31] foundation of the world in him she was
[1:27:35] for known and beloved before she was
[1:27:39] ever brought forth during the ages upon
[1:27:41] the earth think of it she was redeemed
[1:27:45] by the very blood and can never be that
[1:27:48] can never come into condemnation she can
[1:27:52] never be in judgment because sin cannot
[1:27:55] be imputed into her oh my that's the
[1:27:59] Bride of Christ that's a word bride
[1:28:02] Alleluia the word bride will sit with
[1:28:09] Jesus on the throne he said this now
[1:28:14] then there will not be one person who
[1:28:17] will sit in the throne of the Lord Jesus
[1:28:19] Christ unless he has been living that
[1:28:22] word oh my that's heavy your prayers
[1:28:29] your fastings your repentance is none of
[1:28:33] your good works no matter what you
[1:28:35] present to God none of that will gain
[1:28:38] you the privilege of sitting on the
[1:28:40] throne
[1:28:42] none of your religion will grant you the
[1:28:48] privilege of sitting on the throne it
[1:28:50] will be granted only to the word bride
[1:28:54] [Music]
[1:28:55] as the throne of the king is shared with
[1:28:58] the Queen because she is united to him
[1:29:01] so only they who are of that word even I
[1:29:05] see so that's word will share that
[1:29:08] throne oh my I love that don't you
[1:29:12] brushing of the song we are all familiar
[1:29:14] with this quotation but I'll read it
[1:29:17] anyway and as he being the groom the
[1:29:22] bride has to come forth cause it is part
[1:29:25] of him I'm part of him so are you and it
[1:29:34] can only be the manifestation of the
[1:29:36] fulfillment of revelations any others
[1:29:39] has spoken of the Bible it can only
[1:29:43] manifest if it does something different
[1:29:47] from the groom then it isn't the bride
[1:29:50] because she is flesh of his flesh bone
[1:29:55] of his bone life of his life power of
[1:29:58] his power she is ten what kind of
[1:30:05] language is this it's not even
[1:30:11] grammatically correct
[1:30:12] she is him
[1:30:14] [Applause]
[1:30:20] as a man and a woman are one and a woman
[1:30:25] taken from the side she had taken a
[1:30:27] spiritual defendant of the feminist
[1:30:30] spirit from him the flesh from his side
[1:30:33] made both mechanics and dynamics the
[1:30:37] wife the bride becomes the wife
[1:30:43] hallelujah that's what she is the spirit
[1:30:46] of him and the pleasure pin and put
[1:30:49] together and made mechanics and dynamics
[1:30:52] hallelujah
[1:30:54] it's important to understand the
[1:30:58] different teachings of this message it's
[1:31:02] important to understand the sequence of
[1:31:05] events that are about to take take place
[1:31:07] in the future and that are taking place
[1:31:10] now
[1:31:11] hallelujah it's important to know the
[1:31:14] doctrines of this message hallelujah but
[1:31:17] you see all of this is just mechanics
[1:31:21] it's important to abide by church order
[1:31:26] phone cell phones off that's important
[1:31:33] yeah hallelujah
[1:31:36] but even that it's just a part of the
[1:31:39] mechanics but the Bride of Christ is
[1:31:42] both mechanics and dynamics hallelujah I
[1:31:46] don't have to explain that to you the
[1:31:48] dynamics is the power of the Holy Spirit
[1:31:50] in the church hallelujah the teaching no
[1:31:54] matter how good it is how wonderful the
[1:31:56] revelation is without the power of the
[1:31:59] Holy Ghost it's just a dead duck train
[1:32:03] hallelujah
[1:32:04] but the Bride of Christ is not dead he
[1:32:09] has both the mechanics and the dynamics
[1:32:12] to back it up
[1:32:14] hallelujah the token Bedouin said this
[1:32:18] it has to be because a woman and her
[1:32:22] husband become one they become one and
[1:32:26] so does the bride and Christ become one
[1:32:31] in another quotation a man and a woman
[1:32:34] are not two persons but they're one one
[1:32:38] person that's why when the Bible says
[1:32:42] that my glory will I not give to another
[1:32:47] and it's the father speaking but then we
[1:32:51] read in the Bible where the father gives
[1:32:53] it to the son he gives glory to his son
[1:32:57] but when he gives his glory to his son
[1:33:00] it doesn't negate his statement prior
[1:33:03] statement that he will not give his
[1:33:05] glory to another because when the father
[1:33:07] gives his glory to his son he did not
[1:33:10] give it to another person it's the same
[1:33:19] person
[1:33:23] are you ready when he gives you glory
[1:33:30] you see all this mysteries were given
[1:33:34] for our glory it's a glorious message my
[1:33:40] brothers and sisters and it's given for
[1:33:43] your glory heavenly and we always say
[1:33:48] glory to God glory to him glory to Him
[1:33:50] glory to the Lord
[1:33:51] God is saying going to you he gives you
[1:34:00] glory hallelujah
[1:34:03] and when he gives you glory when when
[1:34:06] God when Jesus gives that the church the
[1:34:09] bride glory he neither eats the cherry
[1:34:12] is glowing with another person because
[1:34:17] Jesus and the bride is one person don't
[1:34:26] be scared to take it you're not thinking
[1:34:34] they can take away any glory from him if
[1:34:36] he's giving it to you Alleluia amen
[1:34:42] hallelujah they become one and so the
[1:34:45] surprise and price become one
[1:34:47] diminishing listen to this one
[1:34:49] the ministry of the bride and the
[1:34:51] ministry of christ is the same i say
[1:34:54] amen to that
[1:34:55] [Music]
[1:34:56] [Applause]
[1:35:01] you have to become the word now how does
[1:35:05] that happen how do I become the world
[1:35:09] it's it's hard to fathom sometimes you
[1:35:12] know God is omnipotent omniscient his
[1:35:15] holiness righteous he's all-powerful how
[1:35:19] how can I be like him
[1:35:21] how can I beat the word the word is
[1:35:25] sharper than any two-edged sword and
[1:35:27] it's powerful and it's quick hallelujah
[1:35:31] how can I be the world when one said
[1:35:34] this Jesus had perfect faith he said it
[1:35:38] and it come because he was the word he
[1:35:43] had perfect faith because he was the
[1:35:45] word are you with me and you become the
[1:35:50] word one who you become the word you
[1:35:53] become the word as you received the word
[1:35:56] oh my I think that's this is simple
[1:36:01] enough for me this is not high seola gee
[1:36:06] how do you become the word you become
[1:36:09] the word simply by receiving the word if
[1:36:12] you can take the word hallelujah if he
[1:36:16] abide in me and my words abide in you
[1:36:20] then ask what you will and it will be
[1:36:23] done to you hallelujah Bertram says a
[1:36:31] man that is fully surrendered to God is
[1:36:34] omnipotent and I believe it you can be
[1:36:40] the word how by receiving the word you
[1:36:44] can be the word hallelujah you see if
[1:36:49] you say to this mountain be move and
[1:36:51] don't doubt but believe that what you've
[1:36:54] said in what you have said then you
[1:36:56] shall have what you said when you pray
[1:36:59] believe that you receive what you have
[1:37:01] asked for and you shall have it and it
[1:37:04] will be given to you time-space nothing
[1:37:08] else will ever change it you know it's
[1:37:11] done it's already over well how do you
[1:37:18] become the word by receding the world
[1:37:22] I say amen to every word hallelujah now
[1:37:33] we have this survivor because of the
[1:37:35] message it's called the revival of the
[1:37:42] bride you may ask what is the revival of
[1:37:50] the bride where is it you're looking at
[1:37:53] it I am the brides revival Alleluia
[1:38:05] it takes the Spirit of God to bring life
[1:38:09] and that life must not come out of just
[1:38:14] the intellectual revival it's not
[1:38:17] knowing all the doctrines of the message
[1:38:19] that's just intellectual knowledge it's
[1:38:22] got to come out of the Bible the word
[1:38:25] revival this revival is a special
[1:38:29] revival nothing like it hallelujah has
[1:38:33] ever took taking place in the history of
[1:38:36] Christianity this is not a healing
[1:38:39] revival this is not a crowd revival you
[1:38:44] see we see all these mega churches now
[1:38:47] sprouting and they're there all they say
[1:38:56] they're there they're taking pride at
[1:39:00] the kind of crowds that they gather they
[1:39:04] say to be qualified as a mega church you
[1:39:07] have to have 2,000 people attending your
[1:39:10] Sunday church Sunday Sunday morning
[1:39:12] service come so far from being that but
[1:39:21] we are not to make a church maybe maybe
[1:39:25] I'm my new church well this is not a
[1:39:32] crowd survivor revival this is a
[1:39:36] word revival and then Bertram said I
[1:39:40] believe we are living in a very
[1:39:42] wonderful glorious day of opportunity
[1:39:45] when peoples of this daily living are
[1:39:48] living to see the shadows of the coming
[1:39:50] of the Son of God I believe with all my
[1:39:52] heart that the world is going to burst
[1:39:54] now into the greatest revival take no it
[1:39:59] into the greatest revival that was ever
[1:40:02] known or it's going to be too into the
[1:40:05] darkest chaos that's ever been known in
[1:40:08] history now you pick your choice
[1:40:15] hallelujah I don't care what Minister
[1:40:20] turned their back on the message I don't

[1:40:42] and just enjoying the first kill of this
[1:40:46] hour feasting on the word it's a revival
[1:40:51] unlike any other hallelujah

[1:41:09] right now and the whole world knows
[1:41:13] nothing about it
[1:41:16] hallelujah

[1:48:58] expression of the very attributes of God
[1:49:02] from the foundation of the world you see

[1:50:04] manifest in Christ Christ made manifest
[1:50:07] in the bride and as God took the body of
[1:50:12] Adam the woman and she fell and God took
[1:50:15] from the body of Christ his Flash's body
[1:50:17] which is his word and it's being a bride
[1:50:20] out that won't fall by denomination or
[1:50:23] creed no sir
[1:50:25] but she is coming back with a pure
[1:50:28] unadulterated Word of God being
[1:50:30] manifested hallelu
[1:50:32] a spire when Eve was taken from Adam as
[1:50:38] he was sleeping here's Adam awaking from
[1:50:43] a deep sleep and it since this beautiful
[1:50:46] woman be late laying beside her God did
[1:50:50] not have to introduce her to Adam right

[1:51:41] t-top and it was in my mouth the

[1:52:00] is our commission woe unto you if you
[1:52:05] are not fulfilling this commission

[1:52:12] every tribe in our country there's about
[1:52:15] a hundred different tribes in our
[1:52:16] country and we will not leave any stone
[1:52:22] unturned until we find that last seed
[1:52:27] because unless we find that last seed
[1:52:29] we're not going anywhere
[1:52:33] so we're in this together this is our
[1:52:37] ministry hallelujah our ministry is to
[1:52:41] prophesy again prophesy again meaning
[1:52:46] prophesy of the same book that came open
[1:52:49] in our day not another book
[1:52:53] nothing use doctrine Alleluia but we are
[1:52:57] to say the same thing that has already
[1:52:59] been said prophesy the same the very
[1:53:02] same thing that has already been
[1:53:04] prophesied Alleluia amen now people go
[1:53:11] overboard on this in our country there
[1:53:14] are church groups that they say they
[1:53:18] want to bring back better burnham being
[1:53:19] behind the pulpit
[1:53:20] being in back in the church again and so
[1:53:24] they're just playing the CDs no-life
[1:53:27] preaching that's not the ministry of the
[1:53:30] bride they say don't you know but one
[1:53:36] said say what the tapes say yes I
[1:53:39] understand that absolutely I am
[1:53:41] absolutely understand that statement
[1:53:44] somebody has to say what the same was
[1:53:48] the peg say
[1:53:49] [Applause]
[1:53:55] you didn't say play it said say you what
[1:53:59] the we must prophesy again hallelujah if
[1:54:10] this message will find that last is
[1:54:13] hallelujah and it will have the same
[1:54:16] effect in your life hallelujah
[1:54:20] sweet in the mouth but bitter in the
[1:54:23] belly it's so nice to talk about the
[1:54:26] message so my time just stands still if
[1:54:30] you talk about the message I look at
[1:54:32] better right here when we start talking
[1:54:34] about the message time just stands still
[1:54:37] [Laughter]
[1:54:40] we don't run out of words to say message
[1:54:45] is so rich it's so deep it's so
[1:54:49] wonderful
[1:54:50] it's so beautiful to talk about holiday
[1:54:53] but once you swallow it meaning once you
[1:54:57] apply it in your life then the bitter
[1:55:00] experiences will start to come in
[1:55:05] persecutions will come people will
[1:55:08] misunderstand you call us cult
[1:55:12] hallelujah bitter in the stomach
[1:55:16] hallelujah my bad mom said if it's a
[1:55:18] bitter it will not do you any good
[1:55:22] Lois thank you Jesus so the bride age is
[1:55:32] God's happiest moment in time think
[1:55:36] about it I say a chapter 6 is to verse 5
[1:55:39] for us a young man mariette and virgin
[1:55:43] so shall thy sons marry thee and as the
[1:55:48] bridegroom rejoices over the bride so
[1:55:51] shall my god rejoice over thee
[1:55:56] we think we're excited for the rapture
[1:55:59] so is God excited for the rapture think
[1:56:09] of it this is the happiest moment in God
[1:56:12] amen
[1:56:13] that God never had in time hallelujah oh
[1:56:19] my oh my
[1:56:22] why because everything that God was he
[1:56:25] bought into Christ and everything that
[1:56:27] Christ ever was he poured into the bride
[1:56:31] hallelujah amen
[1:56:33] now here better Bronwen thought that
[1:56:38] when Jesus said greater works than these
[1:56:41] shall you do because I go to the Father
[1:56:43] he thought it meant more of the same
[1:56:49] he was just one man performing all this
[1:56:52] works this miracles but he said when the
[1:56:55] Holy Spirit was poured into the church
[1:56:57] now there's many of us performing many
[1:57:01] miracles doing many good deeds and he
[1:57:06] was explained to explain that it's more
[1:57:08] the same
[1:57:09] now the word there in the King James
[1:57:11] says greater works than this will you do
[1:57:13] for but if you'll run that back to the
[1:57:18] Greek lexicon you'll find out that it
[1:57:21] doesn't mean greater it means more he
[1:57:27] said you couldn't do greater he stopped
[1:57:31] nature He healed the sick he raised the
[1:57:34] dead he done things well there could be
[1:57:37] no more done but you could do more of it
[1:57:41] because he would be in his church as the
[1:57:45] branch has to bind in his branches or
[1:57:47] the whole world around the same thing
[1:57:51] more of the same
[1:57:53] that was his initial understanding of
[1:57:55] this scripture but they understand him
[1:57:58] progressed
[1:58:00] he didn't stop there but he said you do
[1:58:05] the same thing plus he said
[1:58:08] identification pipe identifications he
[1:58:10] said that's the message of the church
[1:58:12] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:58:14] and forever living in the church king of
[1:58:18] the church raised from the dead same
[1:58:20] yesterday today and forever performing
[1:58:22] the same works doing the same things
[1:58:25] that Jesus did that's the message of the
[1:58:28] church if the church isn't teaching that
[1:58:30] it's teaching us some false theology we
[1:58:34] should be doing the same work hallelujah
[1:58:38] all were teaching a false theology
[1:58:40] that's what Jesus commanded them to
[1:58:42] preach and then he said this I quoted
[1:58:50] that once and a man said sure we do the
[1:58:53] greater works we preach the gospel to
[1:58:57] all the world he didn't do it
[1:58:59] in his day and the man said the truth I
[1:59:03] mean Jesus did not come to Ohio and
[1:59:06] preach the gospel somebody else brought
[1:59:10] the brass for here he didn't come to the
[1:59:13] Philippines and to those strike people
[1:59:15] in Mount Pinatubo some somebody else has
[1:59:19] to go there and preach to them
[1:59:21] hallelujah adoption Darwin said this oh
[1:59:29] my I hate this I hate this that I don't
[1:59:34] have the time remember time stands still
[1:59:42] [Applause]
[1:59:47] the Spirit of God coming to men now all
[1:59:51] things has been brought coming shaping
[1:59:54] up to our headstone to the manifestation
[1:59:56] of saw of God sons of God coming back
[1:59:59] and the Spirit of God spirit about
[2:00:02] coming to this man so perfectly until
[2:00:05] their minutes will be so so close to
[2:00:07] Christ it will join him and the church
[2:00:10] together I think we discussed that
[2:00:11] already but he said something else
[2:00:14] imparting eternal life is the greater
[2:00:17] work that you do don't take my word for
[2:00:23] it let me read this now notice that
[2:00:27] greater works was to have the power in
[2:00:29] the church not only to heal the sick by
[2:00:33] prayer and cast out Devils by prayer but
[2:00:35] to impart eternal life to believers the
[2:00:41] Holy Ghost was coming and given into the
[2:00:44] hands of the church hallelujah to impart
[2:00:48] life oh that's what Carville and Calvary
[2:00:52] meant we are able we have the power in
[2:00:56] our hands to impart eternal life so
[2:00:58] those who will believe think about it
[2:01:04] Jesus Christ did not do it on earth
[2:01:06] while he was on earth no he does fall in
[2:01:12] our lot to do it after we preach and the
[2:01:18] people believe the word he will have
[2:01:23] eternal life hallelujah
[2:01:29] it took stoop degraded man that's me you
[2:01:34] me and women and lifted them up to a
[2:01:36] place to be sons and daughters of God to
[2:01:39] heal the sick and to impart eternal life
[2:01:42] by giving the Holy Ghost to obedient
[2:01:44] believers men who were once unbelievers
[2:01:48] to be made believers and impart
[2:01:50] spiritual eternal life
[2:01:52] that's the ministry of the bride
[2:01:59] Jesus Christ did not weeks the baptism
[2:02:02] of the Holy Ghost
[2:02:04] can you show me in the Bible where he
[2:02:06] did it
[2:02:07] no well BAM said the Holy Ghost wasn't
[2:02:11] there yet how could Jesus preached on
[2:02:15] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:02:16] it wasn't it hasn't come yet he said
[2:02:19] Jesus could not preach the baptism of
[2:02:21] the Holy Ghost because it hadn't come
[2:02:22] yet
[2:02:25] that's the greater works we are doing
[2:02:29] but do the same work she did he said you
[2:02:32] would hallelujah
[2:02:36] are you ready speaking things into
[2:02:41] existence is the greater works there was
[2:02:46] no record that Jesus ever did this in
[2:02:48] his time in the Bible can you find it
[2:02:52] for me it's not there
[2:02:55] did you notice one even when we made
[2:02:59] water into wine he took water first
[2:03:01] there already created substance and
[2:03:03] turned it into wine water was already
[2:03:05] there but he just turned it into one
[2:03:08] when he fed the 5,000 people he took a
[2:03:10] face that walk once swam in the water
[2:03:13] and broke it and hand it out and in
[2:03:15] multiplied creation he took bread that
[2:03:18] was one sweet and baked it into bread
[2:03:21] broke it and hung it out to the handed
[2:03:23] out to the people and it returned back
[2:03:25] again multiplied creation huh but they
[2:03:30] did not speak anything to into existence
[2:03:33] he just multiplied creation hallelujah
[2:03:37] but in the last days listen how in the
[2:03:42] last days where there is no sign of
[2:03:45] creation he speaks it into creation
[2:03:48] anyhow shows to be the same God that was
[2:03:51] in the beginning he can create squirrels
[2:03:55] he can create whatever he wants to
[2:03:58] because He is God greater things than
[2:04:01] this will you do for I go unto the
[2:04:04] father
[2:04:09] the words infallible and has to be
[2:04:13] manifested and has to be fulfilled
[2:04:15] greater than this she'll you do not
[2:04:18] multiplying not more of the same
[2:04:24] it doesn't mean more of the same but
[2:04:26] speaking out into creation it's made of
[2:04:31] made available to you now the believers
[2:04:34] of the message oh my we have arrived my
[2:04:39] brothers and sisters he says I believe
[2:04:43] I'm not going to speak it in his name
[2:04:46] but I'm going to speak it in my
[2:04:49] revelation of my faith I'm trusting that
[2:04:54] you have a revelation of your faith now
[2:04:58] you're not relying on somebody else
[2:05:00] faith you're not relying on the pastor's
[2:05:03] faith it's your own personal revelation
[2:05:07] hallelujah and you can do as well about
[2:05:11] him says I can speak it in the
[2:05:14] revelation of my faith what happened in
[2:05:17] Sabino Canyon the other day I believe
[2:05:19] that the hour is approaching when
[2:05:22] missing limbs will be restored and the
[2:05:25] glorious power of the creator
[2:05:26] I believe it's a man of he if he can
[2:05:29] make a squirrel appear that has no he
[2:05:33] here if he if a man or a woman just got
[2:05:36] a part missing and that's a complete
[2:05:38] animal in itself oh he is God limbs will
[2:05:47] be spoken back to existence
[2:05:50] that's the greater works and this work
[2:05:54] has been allotted to you believers of
[2:05:57] this age hallelujah oh my but remember
[2:06:03] you have to qualify it sheis him has to
[2:06:05] be qualified because if not this is a
[2:06:10] dangerous thing in our country people
[2:06:11] have started preaching
[2:06:15] she is him she is him come they
[2:06:19] now think that they are the Word made
[2:06:20] flesh today they became the work so one
[2:06:24] minister of this group I stood before a
[2:06:28] convention of people and tore up the
[2:06:30] pages of his Bible and trampled upon the
[2:06:33] Bible that we don't need this Bible
[2:06:35] because we are the Word made flesh today
[2:06:44] that's getting overboard
[2:06:47] that's extremism that's losing the
[2:06:51] balance of things we have to we have to
[2:06:54] have the right balance of things we have
[2:06:56] to qualify the statement she is him
[2:07:00] because Colossians chapter 1 verse 8
[2:07:02] says and he is the head of the body
[2:07:09] Christ and the bride and one person but
[2:07:13] Christ is still the head we are the body
[2:07:16] he Christ is the object of worship we
[2:07:22] are not Christ is the masculine part we
[2:07:28] are the feminine part is all right amen
[2:07:32] you need to qualify these things
[2:07:34] officiants chapter 1 verse 22 in 20 and
[2:07:37] has put all things under his feet and
[2:07:39] gave him to be the head over all things
[2:07:41] to the church which is his body the
[2:07:43] fullness of him that filleth all in all
[2:07:46] like a safe prices the object of worship
[2:07:48] we are not and skip that now here are
[2:07:54] the scriptures that pertain to the head
[2:07:56] Christ this cannot apply to the believer
[2:08:00] to the body I want you to pay attention
[2:08:07] the revealing of the Son of Man Exodus
[2:08:10] chapter 4 verse 8 this can only apply to
[2:08:13] the prophet Moses to the Lord Jesus
[2:08:17] Christ Moses was the leader of his time
[2:08:20] Jesus Christ was the leader in his time
[2:08:23] he is still our leader right
[2:08:26] he's the head of the church and it shall
[2:08:30] come to pass if they will not believe
[2:08:32] the unite their hearken to the voice of
[2:08:33] the first sign that they will believe
[2:08:35] the voice of the laughter sign Moses had
[2:08:39] two signs but Abraham had two signs
[2:08:41] now do you you can't apply it to the
[2:08:46] believer hallelujah because this is head
[2:08:51] scriptures but scriptures pertaining to
[2:08:53] the head only and as it wasn't the days
[2:08:58] of Noah so shall it be in the days of
[2:08:59] the Son of Man the revealing of the Son
[2:09:01] of Man likewise also in the days of lot
[2:09:04] even that shall it be in the day when
[2:09:06] the Son of Man is revealed the revealing
[2:09:08] of the son of man when brother Branham
[2:09:11] started discerning spirits and
[2:09:12] pronouncing people healed amen
[2:09:16] that's Christ in Berlin and it's the
[2:09:20] only one that could do that
[2:09:21] it can never be duplicated because this
[2:09:28] scripture pertains to the hand another
[2:09:34] scripture that pertains to the head
[2:09:35] jesus answered a senator if thou knewest
[2:09:38] the gift of God and who is it the
[2:09:41] selling to be give me to drink thou
[2:09:42] would have have asked of him and he
[2:09:45] would give thee he would have given thee
[2:09:47] living water only Christ can give you
[2:09:50] the punching effect of the living water
[2:09:53] of the Holy Spirit of the Word of God
[2:09:57] only Christ can do that to you you can
[2:10:02] get living water from your brother or
[2:10:04] your sister only Jesus Christ can give
[2:10:07] it to you hallelujah my love in John 4
[2:10:12] verse 17 to 19 the woman answered and
[2:10:16] said I have no husband he said unto her
[2:10:18] that was well said I have no husband for
[2:10:21] our spy husband and the one Dallas is
[2:10:24] not by her husband in that says thou
[2:10:28] truly Roman 17 sir I perceive that our
[2:10:31] prophet thou art the Son of man now only
[2:10:34] Jesus can do this this is not for the
[2:10:38] rest of the body
[2:10:39] he's only Jesus now the scripture
[2:10:45] hallelujah Luke chapter 10 verse 22 all
[2:10:49] things are delivered to me of my father
[2:10:51] and no man no where to the son is but
[2:10:53] the father and who the father is but the
[2:10:55] son and to whom who the son will reveal
[2:10:58] him
[2:10:59] this can only pertain to the head I
[2:11:02] cannot reveal the father to you
[2:11:05] I cannot give you a revelation of the
[2:11:08] word of God only God can do that Jesus
[2:11:11] the head only can do that hallelujah
[2:11:16] body scripture now this is for you now
[2:11:19] this is the body scriptures that pertain
[2:11:22] to the body is any sick among you let
[2:11:26] him call for the elders of the church
[2:11:28] and let them pray over him anointing him
[2:11:30] with oil in the name of the Lord as for
[2:11:33] you mark 16 verse 15 to 17 is for you
[2:11:40] and they said unto them go ye into all
[2:11:42] the world and preach the gospel to every
[2:11:44] creature he that believeth and is
[2:11:46] baptized shall be saved but he that
[2:11:47] believeth not shall be damned and this
[2:11:49] shall signs shall follow them that
[2:11:51] believe in my name they shall cast out
[2:11:53] Devils they shall speak with other mean
[2:11:55] new tongues and so forth is for you
[2:11:59] first Corinthians 12:10 to another to
[2:12:02] working of miracles to another prophecy
[2:12:04] to another discerning of spirits to
[2:12:06] another divers kinds of tongues to
[2:12:08] another interpretation of time this is
[2:12:09] for you greater works hallelujah
[2:12:15] first Corinthians chapter 12 verse 11 to
[2:12:17] 14 but all these worketh that one of the
[2:12:20] same spirit dividing to every man
[2:12:23] severally as he will for as the body is
[2:12:26] one and has many members and all the
[2:12:28] members of that one body being many are
[2:12:30] one body so also is Christ Christ is a
[2:12:34] many membered body
[2:12:38] by one spirit are we all baptized into
[2:12:40] one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles
[2:12:43] Americans or Filipinos whether we be
[2:12:46] bond or free and have been made to drink
[2:12:49] into one spirit first Corinthians
[2:12:53] chapter 12 verse 11 14 but all this work
[2:12:56] at that one and the sub same spirit
[2:12:58] dividing to every man severally as he
[2:13:00] will force a body's one and as let me
[2:13:08] skip that hallelujah
[2:13:16] okay now the minister of the bride will
[2:13:20] make more sense to the message this
[2:13:26] means not just playing the tapes or
[2:13:30] receiving but this man will man said if
[2:13:34] they pick up this this message and goes
[2:13:38] out with it they can make more sense to
[2:13:41] it see to bring it to a place that you
[2:13:45] would I just want to lay the seed and
[2:13:47] then hope that they may they they the
[2:13:49] pipe of ministry the believers the
[2:13:52] church the bride in this age can make it
[2:13:55] come to life lujah the eyes of people
[2:14:02] that they try to play the tapes of
[2:14:05] better Branham to them they could not
[2:14:08] even relate they don't know word in
[2:14:12] English somebody has to make more sense
[2:14:19] after the message to those people
[2:14:22] hallelujah the Son of Man is revealed
[2:14:27] through the bride
[2:14:29] now we'll skip some bit better man
[2:14:32] starts discerning and pronouncing people
[2:14:34] healed and then he said I challenge you
[2:14:39] to believe that Jesus Christ is revealed
[2:14:41] in the form of the son of man in human
[2:14:45] flesh through the bride's body
[2:14:49] you believe that I believe it with all
[2:14:52] my heart hallelujah
[2:14:55] Hebrews chapter 11 verse 14
[2:14:58] see how you important your work is to
[2:15:02] God Hebrews 11 40 God having provided
[2:15:05] some better thing for us that they
[2:15:10] without us should not be made perfect
[2:15:14] after listening the heroes of faith
[2:15:18] Abraham Elijah and so forth and God says
[2:15:24] without you they will never be perfect
[2:15:27] and then Bertram explains a little bit
[2:15:30] you get it these people who died in
[2:15:33] there are depending and waiting on us
[2:15:38] so this church has got to come to
[2:15:41] perfection in order to bring the
[2:15:44] resurrection this church has got to come
[2:15:48] to perfection to bring the resurrection
[2:15:51] and they are under Essos souls under the
[2:15:54] altar waiting for this church to come to
[2:15:57] its perfection
[2:15:59] that's when Christ does come uniting
[2:16:04] time and sign I think this is the last
[2:16:05] quotation we find that now the time
[2:16:08] comes when the trumpet sounds that those
[2:16:10] sleeping Saints back there that could
[2:16:12] not be made perfect without us they are
[2:16:16] depending on us on Brian Hebrews 11 and
[2:16:21] when they come together they unite with
[2:16:23] the living ones and the church uniting
[2:16:25] with the word then the church and the
[2:16:27] word uniting together and being becoming
[2:16:30] one the dead Saints with the living
[2:16:33] Saints uniting together to be one and
[2:16:35] all going together to United Christ
[2:16:37] under for the wedding supper of the Lamb
[2:16:43] I should end this one amen but let me
[2:16:51] just say we are fulfilling 2nd
[2:16:53] Corinthians chapter 5 verse 18 says all
[2:16:57] things are of God who has reconciled us
[2:16:59] to himself by Jesus Christ and as
[2:17:01] given to us the Ministry of
[2:17:03] reconciliation we have something to do
[2:17:08] bring sinners before his presence God
[2:17:13] there preach the gospel be a witness to
[2:17:15] somebody hallelujah I'm just so happy to
[2:17:19] be able to pitch the congregation of
[2:17:21] about 100 people in UAE in the nation of
[2:17:26] Dubai the city of Dubai one of the
[2:17:31] people but 20 different nationalities
[2:17:33] were represented in that congregation
[2:17:37] now you're listening these are all
[2:17:39] believers of the message I started a
[2:17:43] church in Dubai and 20 different
[2:17:46] denominations are believing the message
[2:17:49] in in the Middle East and you know if
[2:17:53] you look at the location you just
[2:17:55] crossed the border and it's Israel I
[2:18:00] believe what the Prophet said as the
[2:18:03] Jews brought the gospel to us
[2:18:05] we will bring the message to them
[2:18:08] [Music]
[2:18:09] [Applause]
[2:18:10] [Music]
[2:18:12] hallelu let's all stand may God richly
[2:18:18] bless you amen
[2:18:21] now you'll be able to identify your part
[2:18:24] of the body because God is now using a
[2:18:27] many membered body in this bride
[2:18:32] ministry of the bride and there is a
[2:18:34] revival taking place just right now it's
[2:18:40] not a big revival number survival
[2:18:42] miracle revival not a healing revival is
[2:18:46] the word revival
[2:18:49] it's only for the work bride why don't
[2:18:54] we just sing will work till Jesus comes
[2:18:57] [Music]
[2:19:00] amen something for us to do
[2:19:10] [Music]
[2:19:49] till Jesus comes till Jesus comes again
[2:20:00] [Music]
[2:20:04] amen hallelujah you know the word when
[2:20:08] it comes it it challenges us if all God
[2:20:15] did was come and bring a message and we
[2:20:18] were just to handle this message and
[2:20:19] that's it
[2:20:20] there's no responsibility but you find
[2:20:24] that Paul told every church he said a
[2:20:28] dispensation of the gospel is committed
[2:20:30] to me against my will that you were
[2:20:34] fulfilled the will of God amen the
[2:20:38] Prophet couldn't do that he fulfilled
[2:20:41] what God ordained him to fulfill when
[2:20:45] you think of those
[2:20:47] when I look at those what what has been
[2:20:50] said and those quotes ring in my heart
[2:20:53] that's a great responsibility
[2:20:57] brem says younger men he said will come
[2:21:00] and take this gospel and take it in a
[2:21:02] greater way than it is now that's
[2:21:06] tremendous isn't it
[2:21:07] it's not another message but it's the
[2:21:11] same God now what's been spoken becomes
[2:21:15] preeminent in the lives of the people
[2:21:21] and that scripture that God is you know
[2:21:25] how I look at that I always look at
[2:21:26] publications and I hardly ever see that
[2:21:29] that I never see that quoted in a
[2:21:31] publication but that is the truth that
[2:21:34] is where we're at in this hour in
[2:21:36] revelations 10 8 through 11 that is the
[2:21:39] ministry that is going on now
[2:21:42] amen it is that the capstone revelation
[2:21:45] that has sounded out brought the bride
[2:21:47] and Christ United as one
[2:21:51] that's the ministry that's going on and
[2:21:53] our lives you know even when you don't
[2:21:56] even say anything but our lives are
[2:21:58] prophesying out because it's the life of
[2:22:01] the blood in us that tokin life that
[2:22:04] speaks out Amen there there try to place
[2:22:08] you in a world system but we're not
[2:22:10] we're not of this world we're not of the
[2:22:13] system
[2:22:13] we're of that other world
[2:22:16] and then God has called to our hearts
[2:22:18] and when we look at that responsibility
[2:22:21] that laid upon us there's no way that it
[2:22:26] is by our strength by our might
[2:22:30] it is solemnly by the sovereign power of
[2:22:34] Almighty God Amen you love him Amen
[2:22:42] let's just let this be a prayer tonight
[2:22:44] of the words that we have we've heard a
[2:22:47] man to be glorified for him to be
[2:22:50] glorified in our life is for all that he
[2:22:53] is to be shown forth you know when he
[2:22:58] says in his word Jesus was here he was
[2:23:00] in his time of departure in John 12 he
[2:23:02] says father glorify that name and he
[2:23:05] said I have glorified it and I will
[2:23:08] glorify it again this is that hour where
[2:23:13] the name of the Lord is glorified in the
[2:23:17] bride of Jesus Christ it's his life we
[2:23:22] are bone of his bone life of his life
[2:23:24] she is him amen
[2:23:27] you know as I I told the church I was
[2:23:29] preaching on the name of the Lord in New
[2:23:30] York I said when you when you say the
[2:23:32] term giraffe you have to have a
[2:23:35] signification of what a giraffe is if
[2:23:39] you've ever seen a giraffe you and I say
[2:23:41] the word dref you don't think of a oh
[2:23:43] let me see he's trying to describe some
[2:23:45] animal and you think of a chihuahua
[2:23:47] that's not a giraffe so a name has a
[2:23:51] characteristic it has a signification in
[2:23:53] it is that right so that name to be
[2:23:56] glorified again will be the full
[2:23:58] reflection full life full manifestation
[2:24:00] of Jesus Christ amen don't you love him
[2:24:06] amen glory be to God let's let this be a
[2:24:10] prayer tonight be a man and then we'll
[2:24:12] be dismissed in the name of the
[2:24:14] amen in my glory 5p glorified
