God we we just give ourselves to you Lord in the name of Jesus Christ that you would have your perfect way father amen amen god bless you if you'll turn with me to Genesis 31 tonight just have a few verses of Scripture and then we'll let you be seated amen so appreciated the Lord and services that he gave us here this weekend and yeah and I know you had some wonderful services while I was gone and that's wonderful amen because you know though a vessel might go but the Lord doesn't go and so I appreciate brother John just being right here and then I really appreciate our brother amen and we just want to just look to the Lord it's Genesis 30:1 we'll just read a couple verses scripture and let you be seated and he heard the words of Laban sons saying Jacob have taken away all that was our Father and of that which was our fathers hath begotten all his Aldus glory and Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban and behold it was not toward him as before and the Lord said unto Jacob return unto the land of thy fathers and to that kindred and I will be may the Lord bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I'd like to just speak to you tonight on a thought on a change of countenance and before doing that I want I had mentioned to when we were taking up the mission offering on on Sunday and I think the prayer requests had come in tonight about those things that are taking place there was Ben Rusch and the things that I reported to you was some things that I had received where my understanding was at that time from was a pastor who was over there who had come back from a convention not in Russia but there in Holland and had made me aware with other ministers that there had been a a stoppage as far as what all that he knew of of a container but what it ended up being as some of you maybe read it on the website of the voice of God recordings is that is actually in reference to a few tablets and there have been men that have rose up to you know go in and put different things quotes within the message and having brother Graham say this and say that so the request came and I didn't get this request until this morning from one of one of the brothers and that is that they're asking that if we would write letters and I've already I've already been on back today writing a letter just to express what really the my heart and it is the effectual working of the message in my own life and in the message of this local assembly and so that letter then will be Lord willing will be sent I'll finish it up this evening after service and then be sent to where that they'll translate it into Russian there's other there's some other pastors that's doing it as well and I just really felt on my heart I didn't see it it came out yesterday one of the brothers posted it on a little group I'm there with and and I didn't see it until this morning and something just rose in my heart and I so I just began to write and just begin to refer many places in the scripture to the things because what we see happening is something that has has always taken place there was there was how that the religious gathered against the Lord Jesus and a council and anytime that God has moved there's always been that where in the enemy always gets brought up and gets disturbed and his kingdoms just being disturbed even when in the book of Acts you look how many times they brought accusations against Paul and they would come against that and say the house of Jason is is you know causing a disturbance and it wasn't that at all it was these men that were hired in there that were causing a disturbance so they will the Lord willing translate this into this letter along with some others into the Russian language and then it will go there before the magistrates so that they can see that this is that the message within itself is not something as far as where it's ever been declared as far as within this assembly extremism you understand that's what they're doing and and I know we can look at and say well brother Samuel you know it's just it's just how God is moving well or how things are allowed to move well the thing of it is is that we also know that that is in God's hands we cannot change that we're not trying to orchestrate anything but we want to if as long as what God would Terry and what he would have to go forth there within that work there in Russia we want the Spirit of God to be able to move and God will move on our hearts in that way so you know if they rule and say that it is you know extremism and things like that then then so be it you know but if they don't then you know so be it as well because the one thing about it God is gonna have God is gonna have his way so I I asked you just to continue to keep me in prayer because I'm just gonna work on it here after we get out of the service continue and I've already got multiple pages and you know I I just asked you just to help them just pray for me that God will just help me you know I don't know but all in order to do is I just want to do my little part because to me that's what we're standing for is there is is the message that God has sent for us but I want to just I just want to deal with this thought here on a change of countenance and Lord begin to stir my heart on this before I had before I'd went on the trip and I began to look here in the scriptures of how that when we're looking at a a change of countenance it's something that at this point in time in the scriptures that we look at it it's nothing that Laban has expressed to Jacob that he is upset with Jacob or that he has a dislike for Jacob or anything like that but Jacob is noticing the countenance the person the presence of how those things have changed toward him so there's a measure of discernment to be able to see those things and be able to recognize that Laban is not acting towards Jacob as he did before then we find that here within the scripture that how that when Jacob recognizes this change of countenance that the Lord speaks directly to him and and and ministers to Jacob or says to him return unto the land of thy father's so Jacobs not in that land but Jacob is is instructed by God to return to this land and I want you just to think of this just to drop this just for a little bit tonight because I want to really lay some background here that there is a necessary change of countenance if there had not come this change of countenance it is very foreseeable as we can look in the scriptures tonight that undoubtedly Jacob would have continued and continued and continued but God allows a change of countenance to come about and that change of accountants everything is always working for God's great counsel and you know as as the people of God you know when you think of how that the Prophet mentions there of how that many would stand up and take the promise of the hour of the coming of the Lord and brother brems says they begin to make many predictions and begin to say many different things he says but one of the things he said that they fail to recognize is that there is also other conditions that must be present within that time so it's not just us looking because really the whole Church of the Living God if we had the accessibility to go back into let's say if they would have recorded Paul's and messages and others you would have heard Paul preaching the second coming of the Lord you would have heard that urgency that was not something where the church was just living in a manner and that well he's not going to come in our day but let's just do a little bit but know every time that the Holy Spirit as visit did the Church of the Living God even as God was moving to be there to send that messenger forth there was always a people who were designated to receive that word when it came and God would stir up and deal with the hearts of the people so that when that message came here there were people that were ordained to receive it brother Graham gives us that principle we see it in the invisible union he speaks of how that when God is getting ready to send a message there's a people on earth who are desiring to line up with that word it isn't something necessarily that a people can say you know in their churches we're out of line with the word and I want to line up with the word but it is an inward longing that God is responding to and that inner longing is what God has already sown there got placed there in that bed of time and and the Holy Spirit moving in that hour is bringing the condition that's needed for that word to come that it would be received that's the same way he did with Mary that's the same way with all the way down through listen that's the same way that God deals with our life day after day service after service what good would it do for the Holy Spirit to deal with the man of God and deal with this heart and give that inspiration that's needed to speak if he went in dealing with your heart dealing with morrow what good would it be we would have nothing but just protracted meetings and services but that's not the leading of the Lord it's God that's preparing our hearts that's why there's times that you can sit right here well the word is coming forth and all of a sudden you're thinking the Holy Spirit is bringing you back and tying things together that you've heard in the message and it may not be something verbatim that said right here but the Holy Spirit is bringing things together that he has spoken to you throughout the week maybe throughout the month throughout the years what is that that is the Holy Spirit confirming his word doing just what he said he would do he said the spirit of truth will lead and guide us into all truth and will bring to our remembrance those things which he hath said this is God's working they meant and he is the great one that is here among us and God has a timing for everything and and that's where that when we look at it that we we look at the promises of God and we have a desire to see those promises fulfilled but there's always a timing we think of how that Moses when Moses you know he he saw and he read and he heard that there was to come and deliver and he had even heard that part about his own life but yet it wasn't God's timing when Moses stepped on the scene the people were not in condition to receive it so you find that how there must be a receptive and a receiving of this in order for God to move on the scene and there's no party no land that can bring us into that place except God himself God will move right through his distinct gifts and offices and all things to bring everything about as a matter of fact when the scripture says in the book of Ephesians it stands out more and more to my heart how the scripture says he worketh all things after the counsel of his own will think of this of how that God's element of time look at how that when we look back in the scripture in Genesis 29 and let's look back here just a moment of how that Jacob when he arrived in Iran they find that how that Jacob here he is once again he is he's guided the same holy spirit that guided Abraham out of the land and you know as I've said it many times Abraham didn't have a GPS he didn't have an iphone to guide him but he said get me out into a land I will show thee where's it I'll show you where it's at the only thing he had to do was follow in obedience what the voice said do and here this is all that Jacob had to do you remember Jacob coming you say well he knows to go back to the land of Haram that's true but to know that he must return that household of the kindred of Rebecca that there would have to be God Liam the same God that would lead Eliezer is the same God that's leading Jacob into this place Laurie the Bible says of Hal in verse 12 that Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother and that he was a Rebekah son and she ran and told her father and it came to pass when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son that he ran to meet him and embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house and he told Laban all these things and Laban said unto him surely thou art my bone and my flesh and he abode with him the space of a month so here is the countenance when Jacob first arrives it's a countenance of great welcoming you know it's there there was nothing that was against Jacob at that time and so know that remember when we're looking at it that the change of countenance there's sometimes there's things that you know brother Anne tells us of how that the Wills of prophecy said the Wills of prophecy turns slow but sure and some of you that are aware you know of how long that you know when there are many things where many people that have stood around the message and when things haven't happened in a certain time many haven't there have been those that said why this just can't be and how many that you know they walked away in 77 and all those things like that but yet that did not take away from the program of God the vision itself has has been made known in the vision itself it will it speaks for itself in God's declared time it's not how men want to force it it's just like that way within God's Word understanding is given not by our strength understanding cometh when it's time for us to understand those things God moves on our hearts for us to yearn and pray and desire for that what good would it do for me to call you to a table and that is prepared no matter what kind of delicacies these are on it if you're not hungry you're not gonna you're not going to eat but if there is that which is prepared and you are hungry you will respond to the cold and God knows there has got to there there's a desire that reigns within the heart of a believer and so when we look at this this change of countenance is so it's God's doing it's God turning Jacobs heart fully to go back home look at how that God says this in Genesis 28 15 we referred to this place last time we were ministering here was God when he met when he met Jacob there and beth-el and J and here God lets him know behold I am with thee and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest and we'll bring the again into this land for I will not leave the until I have done that which I've spoken to the earth so God remember when God met him here remember as we looked at this this was not some of a place that stood out to Jacob but it was the place that God desired to make himself known to Jacob and it would be a place that God would refer himself to being as the god of Bethel returned back to this place so the hell that God would would speak to Jacob I'm gonna bring you again into this land that's the same thing that God let him know in the Book of Jeremiah he's let him know in the Book of Ezekiel I am gonna bring you back into this place I will cause these cities to be inhabited once again it is God's working and God's doing and God moving in a season of time what is this it just comes back to where the Prophet could say in the message masterpiece he said anybody that reads Jacobs life the only thing he said you can see is God's grace and you know was wonderful grace is nothing that we merit grace is what is provided because grace itself is that which God is God's extension to you and I to bring to pass what he has called for now watch this in the scripture here this is God's promise and I want to draw your attention back here into Genesis 27 verse 43 where Rebekah was speaking to Jacob before he moved into that place of coming before his father you know and and saying that I am he saw and so forth notice how Rebekah says to him concerning these things you know after this has taken place and she says to him in verse 43 my son obey my voice and arise and flee doubt to Laban my brother to her own and tarry with him a few days until thy brother's fury turn away until thy brother's anger turn away from thee and he forget with that which thou has done to him then I will send and fetch thee from fence why should I be deprived also of you both in one day Who am I who was that was that Rebekah or was that the Spirit of God I will send and fetch you Rebekah notice she's moving in line with the promise of God as we looked at that she heard the time of the blessing of that prayer was to be given and she moves and Jacob is prepared to go in and receive the pronouncing of the blessing upon his life and that of the birthright to receive that pronouncement of it but notice when this then this begins to arrive Esau's countenance and how Esau is looking about Jacob causes Rebekah to rise and she says get out of here and go but not just flee anywhere notice the word is not left open lose to where we become vagabonds and Wanderers the word holds a clear direction for our life hallelujah and here she speaks to him and she has and she makes the statement I will send and fetch me from fits yet he wasn't Rebecca who is fetching him but the same Holy Spirit is dealing with his heart to return back oh my hallelujah how that our desire is to say God helped me to be in tune and in line with you you realize sometimes there's many things that you and I listen friends there's many times I've stood right here or I've been in a youth meeting or been other places and I hadn't felt spiritual about a certain thing maybe but I'm saying on preaching you've been in that same condition too and you look at a situation come to find out if things are being spoken and said that are the very answers helpful needs in people's lives but I'll tell you how standing there amazed just as much as when I do feel very spiritual about something because it's God who is in control it's God teaching you and I'm not to rest on our feelings but to rest on him who have called us I hear how the Prophet looking there in the message third Exodus and he's talking about a painting that a brother has drawn for him and brother Bram says this brother he said perhaps didn't even know it when he was making this drawing he said but he goes into the details involving that drawing he said that every one of these things the Lord when I looked at that painting he said the Lord spoke to my heart God was directing even the brother who did the painting that that that painting itself would minister to the prophets heart something that would be deemed to be maybe not so significant but yet it has a significance to your eye Jacob's got a longing to return home notice in Genesis 30 verse 25 it came to pass when Rachel had born Joseph that Jacob said unto Laban send me away then I may go unto my own place and to my own country to my country now notice here Jacob has been there the whole time the Bible of the Bible says in in hosea 12 12 is a Jacob went into the land of her own but Israel served for a wife understand that was that you can look at Jacob but beneath Jacob there was always Israel but it would take God to bring forth Israel but in the mix of the time like Jacob was out in the land of Iran him meeting and and coming into that place of where that his love and desire was for Rachel but Halima comes into a place to where leah is the first one that's married and and then you see how that God orchestrates the order and the timing of all those things and you know friends if we're not careful we miss over and we run over things and we overlook little things in our life and yet God is ministering to you and I through the little things in our life that sometimes we look beyond because we're solely interested in something has to be big it isn't something that has to be big God himself had never came to the earth to make himself big but he came and he took the form of a servant and God Himself can minister and dust minister to our lives through things many times that are not big and high in whatever more by the world but it's God coming and ministering to you and I it might be through a special it might be through a word it might be through devotion it and God might send it through a brother through a sister what is it it's God ministering to the needs of his children this is the day this is the day where the attitude of the saints despise the small things but this is a time in an hour that we recognize the value because you catch it in the small things God reveals it in other things take up senseless in his spirit notice this right here God has not told him to go back God didn't tell him right here rise up but Joseph this you notice it was a birth that had taken place a breath that had come that caused him to long to return back home it was not just a birth it wasn't a birth of Judah it wasn't the birth of build a new one if it wasn't or you know I never Talia wasn't the birth of those that struck this but it was that birth but Joseph that caused him to desire to go back home glory be to God what what is that speaking of that desire that would be within the hearts of God's children listen that longing and desire has been for the second coming of the Lord been desire has been for for our Joseph Christ to make himself known in this time in this generation longing for our honeymoon our millennium not catching away has been a longing for that and notice it was the birthing of something of that of Joseph that put him in a place to where he desired to go back home hey man it's the same way when God sends his word God has sent his word in this hour it puts a longing and the desire that is in line with God's desire what is it it's everything lining up with God's time everything the Prophet tells us how that you know that they're in the Pentecost of hell that he speaks of how that that true church he says on the resume of the ages the true church would return to being the bride she was at Pentecost we know that there must have necessity be a return of dynamic power I don't want to elaborate on this too much but that return of dynamic power it is also in line with how God moved in the book of Acts every day you know I dealt with a little subject when I was over there how the Spirit of God just led me to speak in one of the meetings we were in and I just just took the inspiration and ran with it that you know sometimes we're so interested and we're focused on the object of the picture which is Christ within the bride but you know to really get also value of that you've got to see the background or the setting of which that object is walking in and that's where when you look when we stand there on the other side it's not gonna be where you know we're looking at that we think of the martyrs we think of many different ones but when we stand there they're going to be coming to you and I and say these are the ones that came out of that last stage how did you do it what was it what is it it was same Christ in them as it is in you and you could say well it's a greater master that is true but it's still got working but what is it that causes them to say honey these are the people who came out of Lady ousia it's the setting that you came through the pressures everything that surrounded it and to find that how that there are times as you know I was expressing to them and expressed to you that every day was not a day like when Paul was preaching and he perceived that man had faith and he walked up and you know and asked Oldham and erisa every day was not that kind of a day as far as where there was a miracle taking place like that in every ministry it's not rich and we're betting there were special miracles from this man's ministry and this man's ministry it's special miracles from the hands of Paul why was those special miracles to get the attention of those that they might believe and recognize God God steel moves the same way when the need arises he steps in and moves they're right as a people of God because look friends you know that was expressing there you take a man that is anointed by God such as Apostle Paul and here he is you know standing for the truth miracles being done and all sorts of things and yet here comes a time where we're a secret is told that there are men that are wanting to take your life Paul didn't go out there and say blessed God I'm the messenger of the hour anointed with the Holy Ghost I got the word I'll speak him out of existence no sir the wisdom of God called him in that moment and said get in the basket they'll let you down over the wall he didn't look like a brain man but he was in God's will it was the wisdom of God for that moment I wonder what the people of God would they have looked at it and said oh my the message has lost power the message didn't lose power it comes that that power could be harnessed inside of the wisdom of God very men glory be to God so there's some times where you know look at it in this manner as I said the little things looks like that God sent that man that he might tell Paul in there hey they're coming to kill you get in the basket and get over the wall so what are you saying by the same hell sometimes there's times for you to stand and other times get in the basket in standard that's what I'm trying to tell you the book of Acts 28 chapters but at 828 days come on somebody glory be to God he sensed and this is what we're talking about that that dynamic power that that life that would raise a church in his resurrection power where that life the life of Christ being displayed so perfectly within the hearts and lives of the believer that's God's promise and God's promise there were people who begin to pray for that the Prophet said the believers sense this in their spirits and begin crying to God for a new outpouring such as was in the first century that was God moving them to pray for that that there would be a restoration of the gifts and so they began to pray for that and we we understand those things that had happened what was that that's a longing to return back to the place from whence they had fallen it it was a Spirit of God stirring that up to where but there was people who were ordained to come under that word and they would send themselves would be there in that word would fell within that hour but remember we and understand that that in itself was not the full restoration many thought that he was the full restoration are you with me many thought that that's what it was but it cannot be notice God's timing let me just read it he said what seemed to be the answer came has many began to speak in tongues and manifests gifts of the Spirit it was then believed that this was indeed the long-awaited restoration it was not for the latter rain can come only after the former rain which is the spring or teaching rain see this is the word when the scripture says in the book of Mark it says concerning after they had been filled with the Holy Ghost it says they went about preaching the word the Lord confirming it with signs and wonders amen the spirit doesn't go ahead the spirit follows the word amen the spirit comes behind the word too quick in that word that's why it's receiving the word and we received that word the Spirit of God comes right behind that word to make that word of life it's God confirming his word notice the latter rain Ben is the harvest rain how could this be the real thing when the teaching rain had not come the Prophet messenger who was sent to teach the people turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal father's had not yet come thus what was thought to be the restoration and the final quickening unto the rapture had not come in it was a mixture not listen it's not so much that the thinking of this is the final quickening but remember the Spirit of God is stirring the people up for that moment but God seeing the need according to his word and by his Spirit he brings leadership that the people themselves know firmly where we are planet in the junction of time in God's Word because if you're looking at one thing and saying this is it and that is not it then your expectation isn't something that God has not been declared to be this is it they're right so God brings that alignment so thus he says in it was a mixture of the unrighteous partaking of spiritual blessings and manifesting in the Holy Ghost as we kept pointing out to you and it was also devil power as men were under the control of devils yet no one seemed to realize it then to prove that it was not real these people even before a second generation had appeared organized and wrote their own scriptural doctrines and built their own fences as every other group ahead of them did oh my aren't you grateful that the Spirit of God cleanses aren't you glad for the washing of water by the word they meant that purchase ideas what brother Samuel when I was born again I lost all my dearest no you didn't because that's an idea that's still got to be washed you're being transformed your mind is being reviewed by Christ it's God removing any ideas or anything any hindrance that he would receive all the glory and preeminence notices Jacob rises in verse 26 of this chapter same thing where now after Joseph has been born and he's desiring to go give me my wives and my children speaking to Laban for whom have I served thee and let me go for thou knowest my service which I have done thee notice where Jacob sat Jacob is basing everything on his works you know what I've done my works validate me my service so he's still here his desiring to go but he's still under a place of service and Laban says unto Him I pray thee if I have found favor in thine eyes tarry for I have learned by experience that the Lord has blessed me for thy sake see Laban took knowledge of one thing that after Jacob has come that things changed around his home you know friends God even to where God would set you and I and have us to be God orchestrates everything after the counsel of his own will as long as Joseph was there in Egypt God blessed Egypt is that right god bless them it wasn't because Egypt was a great master man is because Joseph was there god bless labels of not because of Laban because Jacob was there I'd say here right now God will bless even the company and where you were because you're there that's absolutely the truth God can bless right there where a person is walking faithful to God and God can move upon that you say well why is this door closing that we commit that in the hands of God but friends let me tell you the greatest thing that a company could do was hire a real child of God it had all of me when it comes out the resume you can put on the resume and intellect out of God baptized with the Holy Ghost that's it jobs yours as a matter of fact you're the CEO right now but they don't see it in that way but see God will allow things to be blessed but notice there are times we realize of how that things will arise even within the hearts of men to where they begin to look at it that it's them that's doing it's them that doing and God will allow all of those things because in this earth we have no continuing City and if there's not things that comes to us once in a while that would bring a trial hardship a suffering then we begin to become lacks we're just like what Jacob where Jacob says come on I want to go home but then we found here again that there is a something that is presented to him in regards to staying and Jacob accepts it does he have a desire to go home he does now here is God this is a fulfillment of what God had told Abraham that I will I will bless thee God had already told Jacob I will bless thee now notice in verse 28 here Laban says appoint me thy wages and I will give it and he said unto Him thou knowest how I have served thee and how that cattle was with me he's recalling asking Laban to look at his integrity port of those little which thou has before I came and it is now increased unto a multitude and the LORD hath blessed V since my coming whoa now it's not just Laban this testifying Jacob knows the reason everything's increasing is because I'm here this is not arrogance listen friends let me just share this with you when I was still teaching school there was a thing that came out here in the state of Ohio probably most of you wouldn't know about it that Iran involved in teaching or whatever more some of you might because it involved things more than teaching but it was what they called I think of a Senate bill 5 and in Senate bill 5 there are things that they wanted to do it was when right before Strickland had come into office there and when there was there was it so it's been over 12 years ago I think 12 14 years ago and in that Senate Senate bill 5 it was things you know where they were looking to break unions and all other sorts of things and the things that they were wanting to do is as far as when it came to myself as a teacher is strip rights away to where that after I'm finished with one year of teaching then I actually I'm not promised to go back and teach 4th grade next year but I have to almost re-interview for a job because well your kids they tested this way tested that way so we're going to see if we can place you into fifth grade it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that if you even like on anybody in your job you establish a confidence you establish all of those things as time and years ago they say on average it takes forever egde of three years for a person to become comfortable and confident not just in your skill but in the surroundings that surrounds you so here how could it how could a person ever be successful at going this year you're teaching fourth grade next year you're teaching sixth grade next year teaching seventh grade and so forth but you see what it is it's people who never walk or in the boots on the ground in the classroom and you know I understand there's a lot of arguments with this and that and so forth but when I looked at it this is what I'm trying to tell you when I looked at those things there was an element of fear that wanted to grab my life because I looked at things of test scores that I had not my goodness I'll pour myself into the things I do I've never been one who just showed up and clocked out at a certain time I would work during my lunch time I would work after school staying to five five thirty what I'm saying I became I became consumed with that thing and thinking oh my goodness how how am I gonna do it but I remember standing that I'd come to a place I said wait a minute and I know it was God that brought it to my attention hold on I did not give myself this job I didn't open this door that happened the last year before I switched schools help to the other school and switching to the other school then all the sudden merit brighter pupils as a matter of fact in many of those cases out of those three years I had all of the IEP students and those who are also low performers in my classroom but to God be the glory I had tests within that room where they were passing their tests not just passing it but many even on the IV were considered accelerated who did that not me God there are things that I learned but you see it couldn't have even been that to be open to learning had it not been that God Himself would drop that upon my heart wait a minute who gave me this job sometimes you have to reverse it who you are and who's put you where you are because he now that has put you where you are it's up to him to keep you and to watch over you every door that he is open God will keep that door open hope you understand what I'm saying I'm bragging on me I'm bragging on him each time I stand up and then faculty means I testified of the Lord Jesus Christ when they read about the test scores I testified it was him but you see God had to deal with me first before I could ever be open to it notice and now when shall I provide for my own house also see he's got a longing for a house he's got a longing to separate from under labor there's a desire there's a long you see this longing to turn it's there it's present so then Laban ask him what what shall I give thee Jacob said thou shalt not give me anything if that will do this thing for me I will again feed and keep thy flock see Jacobs committing himself he's committing himself to what remain and labor but I thought he had a desire to go home he did it's just like their own over for God pouring out the gifts on the Zuza Street didn't they have a longing for that for the full restoration to come they did they did but how that they continued recalls remember look friends the doctrines that remained all of those things that remained still among the Church of the Living God doctrines of devils you with me baptizing in in and in titles that's not a doctrine of God God said that god there's one baptism one Lord one faith amen jesus said be baptized in the name of the Father Son and of the Holy Ghost the name being been of the Lord Jesus Christ God revealing his name that the name of the sacrifice the name of the true atonement the name of his children calling us by his name Jacob said I'll pass through all the flock today removed from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle and all the brown cattle among the sheep and the spotted and speckled among the goats and of all such shall be my hire some sell my righteousness answer from me and time to come when it shall come from my hire before thy face every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and brown among the sheep that shall be counted stolen from me Laban said Behold I would it might be according to thy word and the scripture tells us in verse 35 that he removed all of those that day that were the ringstraked and spotted and all of that among you know the the goats and so forth and gave them under the hands of his sons the Bible says in verse 36 he set three days journey betwixt himself and Jacob and Jacob fed the rest of Laban flocks three days journey between the flocks and here is think of what Laban is going through no doubt in his mind at this time wages remember Laban 's agreement Laban is not going to be outdone in a deal but Jacobs a shyster - Jacob had studied the tax code pretty well and Laban looks upon this and agrees to this term and you know I'm not going to take the time but the scripture goes on in verse 42 to tell us of how that the fee bore in verse 42 of that chapter were Laban and the stronger Jacobs after Jacob moving putting out the poplar branches you know and stripping him down and those things the scripture says in verse 43 and the man increased exceedingly and had much cattle and made service talking about Jacob and men servants and camels and asses but then at the beginning of the chapter we read for our text Laban sons start noticing this increase this is different they see and they view it that Jacob has stolen from our father and their words poison Laban see God allows it God allows it hey just like when the scripture says that there arose of Pharaoh who knew not Joseph brother brems says in 3rd Exodus that was the beginning of the beginning God had to allow that but you know when that arose the children of Israel increased during that time so here Jacob taking this direction and how that in verse four let me just go to verse four here and try to finish this up here for tonight jacob sins and he calls Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flocks he says I see your father's countenance that it's not toward me as before but the god of my father that's been with me and you know that with all my power I have served your father and once you think of this if there was any question Rachel and Leah Leah could have could have called his bluff on this could have said no you haven't you've done this and this and this no no but Jacob had a testimony that I have done all in my power even when your daddy wasn't looking I faithfully serve I was not an i pleaser but I faithfully served what was put out for me to do and your father have to save me and changed my wages ten times but God suffered him not to hurt me Jacob already knew God was watching out for him but now this becomes what God said in Genesis 28 Jacob sees God fulfilling it in his life now there was a lot of things that was set forth to hurt me that God suffered him not to if he said thus the speckled shall be thy wages then all the cattle bear speckled and if he said thus the ring straits shall be the hire then bear all the cattle ring straight thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father and have given them to me notice who had noticed in verse 10 it came to pass at the time that the cattle can see I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream and behold the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ring straight speckled and bristled and the angel of God spake unto me in a dream saying Jacob and I said here am I he said lift up now thine eyes and see all the rams which leap upon the cattle or ringstraked speckled and bris for I have seen all that label Laban doeth unto thee where did Jacob get that wisdom from God God directed him on those things to think about it these are not necessarily flocks that would be determined maybe to be weak or whatever because there was out remember those who were good in color there was some of those that were weak Jacob did not move in the same way so that that weakness would come on but he moved upon those that were of the strong so out of the strong then would come forth that which had been made of the ring straightened and all of those things notice those which Lathan willingly released so no value in but Jacob said I'll take those from my higher let me tell you something what the world rode off as an outcast what the world ruled out and said there's nothing to them but God said I will take them for myself I will take them I will purge yourself because it's not a decision that's been made in time but we were always a part of him a man and he came down and paid that price to bring you and I back to himself we are the purchase of his blood if the Prophet said in his sight if I had just even he said a vile concern to having the blood the literal blood he said do you realize in his sight I'm standing in front of him before something that is more precious to him in his sight than the literal blood I'm speaking to the purchase of his blood God was supplying Jacob faithful to his word belonging to returned home and all of these things God is orchestrating all of these parts to come into their place it's God's timing it's God's timing and friends when we look at this in how that God's timing is so set forth it's not God's desire for us to be anxious that's his word be careful for nothing right don't be anxious for tomorrow don't be anxious for this but the pressures and everything that around us within this age there's a lot of things that can come to try to bring anxiety and fear and anxiousness that's true the conditions that surround in Psalms 27 verse 3 those are conditions that are not conditions that are bright and shiny its conditions of darkness that are around demonic pressure but in the midst of it what what David focuses on is not that he sees it but David said in the midst of this time one thing have I desired and that one thing will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord amen it's what we choose to focus upon God is working everything after the counsel of his own will you know friends it's just wow you know it's just like we're you know a person could rise up and say well I'll tell you what it it won't do no good for the young people are not none of them to go to college or whatever more where that inspiration comes from men look at Scripture and look at these different things but the reality is is that we want to be found ready at all times the Prophet makes it very clear he said we live as if it would be a hundred years or so from now as far as in the planting and preparations but we live as if he could come within the next moment I'll tell you what to do that it takes balance because the things would want to pull you to go far out here and then there's things that could also try to push you back here you say could that could things push me back here yeah it could push you back here as well but there's a balance the Prophet told us he said if Satan can't keep you from something you're trying to push you beyond it we don't need radical ideas we just need the same God to give us strength to wait and to walk in what he has unfolded walking and just as God moved upon Jacob within those increments of time and everything had to get to a place to where Jacob no longer saw a welcoming place in the house of Labor God had to remove or see to it that the welcome mat was removed then Jacob knew is time to go home and he called his wives and said it's time to go he didn't speak to Laban he spoke to them it's time to go and they gathered themselves together and Jacob rose up God fulfilling his word all in God's timing amen you love him amen let's pray Heavenly Father or Jesus truly Lord Falls Lord in our hearts as we look at this Lord where Jacob's life we see our own life Oh God the Lord how that you move upon our hearts Lord and have moved and continue to move Lord oh my the Holy Spirit moving upon our hearts Lord there is a land beyond the river it's called the sweet forever Lord Father how we think you Lord God or the promise Lord Jesus that moves and fond our hearts Lord Oh God warming our hearts Lord in this our Lord everything Lord that is to be in its position every every little cog of the wheel Lord has a watch itself the Prophet refers to would have many wills and those wills Lord interacting with one another Lord Oh God to see these parts Lord all lined up father your prophet Lord would make mention and note at the very hour that the angel of the Lord commissioned him to go into the field and pray for the sick it's that same hour that same time Lord Israel becoming a nation Lord God these things Lord all in its timing go to when we bring it down into Jacob's life Jacob's desired timing was for Rachel first then Leah but your timing was Leah first and Rachel was to follow your timing Lord to wear that even you would seal up Rachel's room until Anna point of time Oh God everything it's all in your time lord help us Lord to be faithful help us to move help us Lord God to wait patiently and move earnestly oh god you you know each and every need the lives Lord every heart Lord has it set out before us what a time what an hour Lord as we walk in this hour this age where truly Lord it's a time where the promises that have been spoken are now being fulfilled in fullness Lord your God to where that we as the people of God are under expectation for the change of our body what I think of many of them older brothers sisters Lord that's lived Lord before us dear God how many Lord walking Lord in this way they're goners I remember Lord even before you got ahold of my life and then even after I would hear many say we never thought it would last to this time and Lord is true we look at these things Lord and we we don't see even when we look at in light of the scripture right now where the cup of iniquity Lord being filled Lord as we look at things we would look at it and say it's gotta be running over it's gonna be but Lord we know that it's not a pastime there were those Lord when Lazarus had went on Lord they said if you had been here he wouldn't have died but you were right on time right on time that God that they might see that witness that you are now not in the future but you are now the resurrection and the life Oh God help us Lord Father we don't want to try to make ourselves something we don't want to try to Lord God figure things out we want to be able to walk in the light with the desire Lord that you would open more light help us God to every light Lord that you have open help us to faithfully walk in annoyed will god I pray tonight Lord your word is went forth Lord father I pray that God that you would move your
