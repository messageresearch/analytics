[38:23] Christ amen amen you love the Lord
[38:28] tonight
[38:29] amen would you turn with me to Exodus
[38:32] chapter 4 Exodus chapter 4 and we'll
[38:41] just start reading right there
[38:51] in Exodus chapter 4 verse 1 I just want
[38:54] to read a few verses of scriptures here
[38:57] and Moses answered and said but behold
[39:01] they will not believe me nor hearken
[39:05] unto my voice for they will say the LORD
[39:08] hath not appeared unto thee and the Lord
[39:11] said unto Him what is that in thine hand
[39:14] and he said a rod and he said cast it on
[39:18] the ground in it and he cast it on the
[39:21] ground and it became a serpent and Moses
[39:24] fled from before it and the Lord said
[39:26] unto Moses put forth thine hand and take
[39:30] it by the tail and he put forth his hand
[39:33] and caught it and it became a rod in his
[39:37] hand that they may believe that the Lord
[39:40] God of their fathers the God of Abraham
[39:43] the god of Isaac and the God of Jacob
[39:46] hath appeared unto thee and the Lord
[39:50] said furthermore unto Him put now thine
[39:52] hand into thy bosom and he put his hand
[39:56] into his bosom and when he took it out
[39:58] behold his hand was a leprous of snow
[40:00] and he said put down hand into thy bosom
[40:03] again and he put his hand into his bosom
[40:06] again and plucked it out of his bosom
[40:07] and behold it was turned again as other
[40:11] flesh as his other flesh and it shall
[40:14] come to pass if they will not believe
[40:16] thee neither hearken to the voice of the
[40:18] first sign that they will believe the
[40:21] voice of the latter sign and it shall
[40:23] come to pass if they will not believe
[40:25] also these two signs neither harken unto
[40:28] thy voice that thou shalt take of the
[40:31] water of the river and pour it upon the
[40:33] dry land and the water which they'll
[40:35] take us out of the river shall become
[40:37] blood upon the dry land may God bless
[40:41] the reading of his word as you're being
[40:43] seated would you go back up to Exodus 3
[40:48] verse 16 with me I'd like to pick right
[40:51] up right there
[40:54] and here is the Lord telling Moses what
[40:59] to do go and gather the elders of Israel
[41:03] together and say unto them the Lord God
[41:07] of your father's the God of Abraham of
[41:10] Isaac and of Jacob appeared unto me
[41:13] saying I have surely visited you and
[41:15] seeing that which is done to you in
[41:17] Egypt and I have said I will bring you
[41:20] up out of the affliction of Egypt unto
[41:23] the land of the canaanites and the
[41:25] Hittites and the amorite and the
[41:28] perizzites and the Hivites and the
[41:30] Jebusites unto a land flowing with milk
[41:33] and honey and they shall hearken to thy
[41:36] voice and thou shalt come thou and the
[41:38] elders of Israel unto the king of Egypt
[41:40] and you shall say unto Him the Lord God
[41:42] of the Hebrews hath met with us and now
[41:45] let us go we beseech thee three days
[41:48] journey in the wilderness that we may
[41:50] sacrifice to the Lord our God I'd like
[41:55] to draw your attention here tonight
[41:58] as we looked at last week that signs and
[42:02] wonders the scriptures are very clear
[42:04] that has it gives God gives the
[42:07] distinction for his true church in mark
[42:12] chapter 16 that signs and wonders shall
[42:15] follow them that believe and we we
[42:19] recognize that signs and wonders as we
[42:22] see as we read here in the opening part
[42:25] of exodus form where that Moses is
[42:30] responding to the commission that God
[42:33] has has given to him where he is meeting
[42:36] God face to face and Moses speaks in a
[42:40] manner and says they're not going they
[42:43] won't believe me they'll ask who is it
[42:46] that has sent you they will ask what is
[42:49] your name
[42:50] and they that they might know that that
[42:54] that God indeed hath sent me because
[42:57] they will say the Lord hath not appeared
[42:59] unto thee and you see God in this right
[43:03] here God asked Moses to take something
[43:06] that is very very simple that he's been
[43:09] carrying around and when it is submitted
[43:13] under the obedience of the voice of God
[43:16] notice the rod and staff that he's had
[43:20] in his hand it becomes a serpent when he
[43:23] casts it on the ground his hand when he
[43:26] is obedient to the voice of God and he
[43:29] puts his hand into his bosom
[43:31] it becomes leprous you see sometimes
[43:34] when we're looking at that of for
[43:36] miracles and for signs and wonders it's
[43:38] not something that's far out here but
[43:41] it's something that's very close to you
[43:44] that God desires to be submitted and
[43:46] when it's submitted in obedience to his
[43:49] voice God can take something and is able
[43:52] to transform it as a sign and a wonder
[43:55] that's the same way that God does you
[43:57] know God will never reach down and take
[44:00] a heart but a heart must be surrendered
[44:02] to him it's not something that is way
[44:06] out there but it's simply that God would
[44:08] ask of our life and through
[44:10] by the surrender of our life that our
[44:13] life would actually be a sign and a
[44:16] wonder a paradox that you cannot explain
[44:19] what has happened within your life but
[44:22] you know that there has been a change
[44:24] that has taken place what was it it was
[44:27] simply God getting your attention and
[44:30] when he got your attention he spoke to
[44:33] you and once he speaks to you then
[44:35] there's something that rises out of your
[44:37] heart to obey what is it that is given
[44:40] to you and I to be able to obey it is
[44:43] simply that that God has foreordained
[44:46] that where when his voice his presence
[44:49] would come across our path he asked us
[44:51] for something that's so simple and yet
[44:55] out of our life it's submitted to him
[44:57] now I want you to think of a very
[44:59] familiar place that brother Ram would
[45:00] take us over and over again of how that
[45:03] Moses himself knew about the promise of
[45:06] God but yet when he got into the
[45:08] presence of the Living God it was there
[45:11] that he received and was equipped with
[45:13] what was needed in order to take the job
[45:16] because remember the job itself would
[45:19] have been a job that for the natural man
[45:21] he would've easily got discouraged a job
[45:23] that he would have easily been
[45:25] frustrated a job that he would have been
[45:27] overwhelmed that's the same way it is
[45:29] within our life because sometimes we can
[45:31] get discouraged we can get overwhelmed
[45:34] if we start looking through these eyes
[45:35] instead of looking through the eyes on
[45:37] the inside that looks into the promise
[45:40] of the Living God and says Lord the
[45:42] promise that you've made you're able to
[45:44] perform it you see you've met someone
[45:47] you've been somewhere and you know that
[45:50] there is a living power that you have
[45:52] met that's able to bring about what it
[45:54] is that he has spoken in your life you
[45:57] see that's why that each and every one
[45:59] of us must first be a sign and Wonder we
[46:02] must be a miracle a paradox of God in
[46:05] order to actually believe in miracles
[46:08] because the greatest miracle that has
[46:10] ever been much greater than even that of
[46:12] the virgin birth is that of the new
[46:14] birth and to think of it there is a
[46:16] miracle from that new birth that places
[46:19] you and I in Jesus Christ and here we
[46:21] are as a part of the body of Jesus
[46:23] Christ
[46:24] those who are promised to come forth in
[46:27] the first resurrection some of us will
[46:29] be alive and remain others of us may go
[46:32] by the way of the grave have some have
[46:34] gone ahead before us but regardless of
[46:37] not we are part of the greatest miracle
[46:39] that is getting ready to strike the face
[46:42] of the earth where there is going to
[46:44] come a literal change within the body of
[46:47] Jesus Christ what all the prophets have
[46:50] looked for what all of them by
[46:52] inspiration have been caught up though
[46:54] they were not able to be a partaker of
[46:56] it but they were a partaker of that same
[46:59] Holy Spirit that now resides in our
[47:02] heart and that same quickening power
[47:03] that has raised you and I that raised up
[47:06] the Lord Jesus Christ that same
[47:08] quickening power that packed away Enoch
[47:10] is that same quickening power that
[47:13] raised up Isaiah that same quickening
[47:15] power that raised up Jeremiah that same
[47:18] quickening power that raised up Elijah
[47:20] and Elisha and that same quickening
[47:22] power one of these days will sweep right
[47:25] over us and there will be a change in
[47:28] our life we believe that all believers
[47:33] believe there is a literal Lord Jesus
[47:37] Christ there is a literal corporal
[47:40] coming is that right so now within this
[47:44] the signs and wonders that are given
[47:47] that that Moses would ask they're going
[47:49] to ask this because they're not just
[47:51] going to take my word for it so you see
[47:54] God has a way of delivering his word God
[47:57] accompanies his word with signs and
[47:59] wonders we looked at that last week the
[48:01] Bible says at the end of march 16 that
[48:03] the Lord was with them working
[48:05] confirming the word with signs and
[48:08] wonders and miracles the Bible picks it
[48:11] up in acts 2:22 that Jesus of Nazareth a
[48:14] man approved of God among you doing both
[48:18] signs and wonders so how was his
[48:20] approval it wasn't that he could quote
[48:22] the prophets it wasn't that he knew the
[48:24] Psalms what was it that was vindicated
[48:27] God approved him in their myths by signs
[48:30] and wonders but it was not the signs and
[48:32] wonders that God was wanting them to
[48:34] focus on but rather the signs and one
[48:38] that would make them aware of the
[48:39] presence of the Living God there is a
[48:42] word a message that's getting ready to
[48:44] come forth Omaha I'm glad that God knows
[48:47] exactly what he's doing his signs and
[48:50] wonders that God gives do not come with
[48:52] a voice that would just hold people in
[48:54] the same pattern that they've always
[48:55] been in but any true sign and wonder of
[48:59] God will always call you to the promise
[49:02] of God which we've read right here in
[49:04] Exodus 3 programs said it like this if
[49:06] Moses he said when he got before that
[49:09] bush if the voice would have spoke out
[49:11] of that bush any other thing outside of
[49:14] the scriptural promise Moses would have
[49:16] never received it would it have been a
[49:18] phenomenal thing it would have booth
[49:20] above the bush being on fire would have
[49:22] been a wonderful thing but it never
[49:24] would have touched Moses life or put him
[49:26] into action let me say this to you there
[49:28] are many signs and wonders there are
[49:30] miracles that happen outside of the
[49:33] ranks of the bride of Jesus Christ
[49:34] miracles are not confined just to the
[49:37] bride of Jesus Christ's miracles are to
[49:40] them who believe signs and wonders are
[49:42] given to them who believe but I believe
[49:45] with all of my heart that they we are
[49:47] given by God's grace the signs and
[49:50] wonders to recognize his presence and to
[49:53] recognize that his word that our faith
[49:55] would rise within that word because let
[49:58] me tell you something a sign in a wonder
[50:00] is not our inheritance but a signs and
[50:02] wonders accompany us pointing us to our
[50:06] full inheritance are you with me now now
[50:09] notice this the Prophet himself when you
[50:11] think of it
[50:12] all of this wood that was given they
[50:14] wont hearken to my voice all of the
[50:17] signs that were given was so that the
[50:19] people would actually come to a place of
[50:22] submitting themselves to the voice of
[50:24] God now the voice of God was not going
[50:27] to be to where that you know they were
[50:29] just looking at Moses word but they
[50:31] would recognize that this is God's Word
[50:34] now and when we look at God's Word God's
[50:36] Word will always speak according to its
[50:39] promise now think of this of how that
[50:41] God he appears here in the midst of the
[50:44] bush and when he gets Moses attention
[50:47] now first of all God ain't going to
[50:48] speak without getting your attention
[50:51] you know it's like you and me if you go
[50:53] to start talking to me you'll probably
[50:54] wait if you say I'm not paying attention
[50:56] but once you see that you've got my
[50:58] attention hey brother Samuel hey brother
[51:00] so-and-so hey hey once you've got my
[51:02] attention then you'll say what you want
[51:04] to say you see god when he performs
[51:07] signs and wonders it is not just to show
[51:10] that he's gone but he performs signs and
[51:12] wonders to get our attention and it's
[51:15] something about it that for our life it
[51:17] gets our attention and then God Himself
[51:20] can come right behind that sign in
[51:22] wonder and begin to make known a promise
[51:25] that he has ordained for this hour and
[51:27] this time now think of this in this hour
[51:30] when you look at Moses of here he is
[51:32] he's called by God to go down there and
[51:35] there's two signs God gives him two
[51:37] signs now look these signs he was
[51:39] ordained a prophet wasn't he he was
[51:42] already born a prophet he did not become
[51:44] the prophet of God standing there in the
[51:46] pillar of fire but what happened is it
[51:49] was already ordained as a prophet of God
[51:51] but in the presence of the Living God
[51:53] God brought forth the gift that already
[51:56] was laying in Moses life even when Moses
[51:59] was sucking on the pacifier
[52:00] when Moses himself was playing with the
[52:03] toys in the floor he was already a
[52:05] prophet of God but what happened is he
[52:07] had to have an activation in his life
[52:10] because Moses himself had a lot of
[52:13] credentials Moses had credentials as a
[52:15] great general in the army of God he knew
[52:18] exactly how to fight how to conquest how
[52:20] to position armies in battle but you see
[52:22] that was not God's Way of using any bit
[52:26] of his intellect and his knowledge of
[52:28] positioning but rather God Himself would
[52:31] call Moses off to the side to where
[52:33] Moses would actually forget about the
[52:36] calling of God on his life but God
[52:38] didn't God never forgot about the
[52:40] calling on his life because it was in
[52:43] Moses that called himself in the first
[52:45] place it was God that called him and God
[52:48] that placed the credentials on the
[52:50] inside but you see without the
[52:52] credentials being activated there's a
[52:54] way to question it it's like tonight you
[52:56] know I think about enough said this many
[52:58] times when I went to school Bowling
[53:00] Green and I had obtained a bachelor's
[53:02] within teaching that batch
[53:04] degree did not make me a teacher when I
[53:08] obtained the master's degree in
[53:10] administration he did not make me that
[53:13] it only gives me the necessary
[53:16] credentials of what was already laying
[53:19] in my life I now have the proof of what
[53:22] has always laid there I believe that
[53:24] with all my heart I've got it ordained
[53:26] that I would be a teacher on somebody in
[53:28] the natural I believe that I believe
[53:30] that God ordained that in my life and I
[53:32] believe that God has just a specific
[53:35] part within our life that God knows
[53:37] exactly what he wants out of our life
[53:39] God is not the author of confusion as I
[53:42] told the young people some months ago
[53:43] when you begin to look in your life God
[53:46] it's not the author confusion he does
[53:48] not put you in this life without a skill
[53:51] in your life to be refined in order to
[53:53] support yourself because Bible says when
[53:56] God appeared regarding the Tabernacle in
[53:58] the wilderness he said that I have
[54:00] placed within Bezalel the skill of
[54:03] wisdom to know how to work with all
[54:05] manners of artifice and brass and so
[54:07] forth it is us coming to the place and
[54:10] submitting our lives to say Lord you
[54:12] know the skills that you put in my life
[54:14] Lord you know what you put in my life
[54:16] and I would be able to support myself in
[54:19] the natural but yet what we lean on is
[54:21] the Living God Oh glory be to God so God
[54:25] knows exactly what he's doing
[54:26] as Moses comes into this place and God
[54:29] would begin to speak to him where Moses
[54:32] comes forth from the presence of God he
[54:34] comes with the necessary credentials
[54:39] they're gonna ask has he appeared to you
[54:44] see he what he's asking for I've got to
[54:47] have credentials
[54:48] it's got to be credentials and you know
[54:51] what he's asking for he's asking for God
[54:53] to activate what God's already placed in
[54:56] his life he was already ordained as a
[54:59] prophet he's simply coming to a place to
[55:02] ask God to activate what's in his life
[55:05] you know that's exactly the way it is
[55:07] with your life you know what you are
[55:09] always safe you are always a believer
[55:11] you're always a she you had the
[55:13] credentials on the inside
[55:15] to live a real godly overcoming life but
[55:18] what it is you had to get in the
[55:20] presence of him who laid the credentials
[55:23] in your life and when coming in his
[55:25] presence he's able to raise up what he
[55:27] already has ordained right there in your
[55:29] life in his presence so that there is no
[55:32] other school there's no other Church
[55:34] there's no man can take glory in your
[55:36] life all the glory goes to God it's God
[55:39] who seeks you out it's God who brings
[55:41] you to himself it's God who cleans you
[55:44] up and it's God who activates the
[55:47] credentials in your life now think about
[55:49] this you know when God gives a sign God
[55:53] does not give a sign that just would
[55:55] keep us going within one great circle
[55:58] but when God speaks there's a voice
[56:00] behind what's spoken there are necessary
[56:04] credentials now to think of this that in
[56:06] many of the times you know when you look
[56:09] at when God would begin to speak you see
[56:11] when we look at that of a prophet think
[56:13] of it how many times that even brother
[56:15] Branham here he is standing here he's
[56:17] standing in there before many men that
[56:19] have been schooled and great Babel
[56:21] colleges they know a lot of different
[56:23] things but remember how many of them
[56:25] said oh my when the anointing is on
[56:27] brother Branham you I'll tell you what
[56:29] boy he's a prophet of God but you better
[56:31] watch as his teaching and brother Brian
[56:33] would come back and say you don't even
[56:34] know what a prophet is it's not the
[56:37] signs but it's the message that follows
[56:40] the signs are given to that of confirm
[56:45] remember if they won't believe the heed
[56:47] to the voice from the first sign then
[56:50] there will be given another sign and
[56:52] that they would heed to that voice if
[56:54] they still won't hearken to the voice
[56:55] I'll give them another sign you see what
[56:58] God is so focused that God will not
[57:01] leave one speck or one iota that a
[57:04] person can say well you know God you you
[57:07] never made it known to me you you never
[57:09] made known that this message was the
[57:10] truth you never made it known right here
[57:12] that Moses was that man no quite the
[57:15] contrary when God makes himself known by
[57:19] signs and wonders as God was doing right
[57:22] here with the sign of the Messiah it was
[57:24] a prophet himself is a sign that there
[57:27] is a messy
[57:28] that's going forth together the people
[57:31] into the inheritance listen to me
[57:35] brother man tells us that that belly
[57:37] gram had the message of repentance down
[57:39] path but Billy Graham did not have the
[57:42] Ministry of reconciliation in order to
[57:45] bring the people from repentance into
[57:48] the true baptism of the holy ghost
[57:50] it was confusion for Billy Graham he
[57:52] thought that them preachers were just
[57:54] lazy and that's why people weren't going
[57:56] on with God but brother Randall puts it
[57:58] back to the place he said when Paul came
[58:00] along Paul not only preached and brought
[58:03] that person from repentance but he
[58:05] brought him all the way into that of the
[58:07] true baptism of the Holy Ghost where
[58:09] that man soul was set on fire you see
[58:12] that is necessary credentials for the
[58:15] bride of Jesus Christ thank God you know
[58:17] they have their part Billy Graham that
[58:19] is part Oral Roberts has their part the
[58:21] RAM says they are messages of the hour
[58:23] but we also have a message of the hour
[58:26] and we have that message of the hour
[58:29] that God has delivered to us by and
[58:32] through His Prophet it was a promise of
[58:34] God that God has made known within this
[58:36] hour now to think of this these these
[58:39] credentials that are given let me just
[58:41] try to move through this here just a
[58:42] little bit when you think of it in Acts
[58:45] chapter 2 here the Lord Jesus he's
[58:47] raised from the great here he is he's
[58:49] walking with the disciples they do not
[58:52] know that it's him but notice what he
[58:54] does he begins to take them and point
[58:57] them in the word so that they themselves
[58:59] their confidence will be built in the
[59:02] word why because the next stage of the
[59:04] journey they are going to have to have
[59:06] faith in the word it will not be enough
[59:09] that they recognize the resurrection of
[59:11] the Lord Jesus Christ that was no doubt
[59:14] what a wonderful time those 40 days 40
[59:16] days they were there with him
[59:18] my rejoicing you never knew when he was
[59:20] going to show up didn't know whether it
[59:22] was gonna be on a fishing trip or
[59:23] whatever more you didn't know but he was
[59:25] right there with them what was he doing
[59:27] he was instructing them not just signs
[59:29] and wonders but he was instructing them
[59:32] with things pertaining to the kingdom of
[59:34] God what was he doing building their
[59:36] faith in the word because the word hell
[59:40] promised for their life so they've got
[59:43] to have faith in the word Oh glory now
[59:48] think of this here when they recognized
[59:51] here when Peter here as they're waiting
[59:54] and notice has the Holy Spirit that is
[59:58] promised it begins to descend and here
[1:00:02] when they come out in Acts chapter 2 the
[1:00:05] the the the disciples step forth and
[1:00:08] notice as they begin to come out of
[1:00:10] there they come out of the upper room
[1:00:12] they were fearful upon going in there
[1:00:15] they were hiding but when something took
[1:00:18] place in their life when that which was
[1:00:21] spoken of by the Prophet had moved into
[1:00:24] their life they no longer were fearful
[1:00:27] but they came out of there with the same
[1:00:29] one who made the promise was now living
[1:00:32] on the inside of them they were no
[1:00:34] longer they were not motivated by their
[1:00:36] self but it was that promise that God
[1:00:39] had made known to Peter when you're
[1:00:41] converted then strengthen your brethren
[1:00:43] you see it was a promise that he had
[1:00:46] made known to him by commandment he says
[1:00:48] I want you to go and wait upon the
[1:00:51] promise which you shall receive of my
[1:00:54] father you see there's got to be a
[1:00:56] moving into full inheritance here they
[1:00:59] were they were ordained witnesses chosen
[1:01:02] before the foundation of the world that
[1:01:04] these the very resurrection would be
[1:01:06] made manifest to them but notice what
[1:01:08] indeed the manifestation of the
[1:01:11] resurrection of the Lord Jesus was to do
[1:01:13] was to bring them in obedience to the
[1:01:15] word that would be commanded to go and
[1:01:18] wait until you are endued with power
[1:01:20] from on high you see there is a full
[1:01:23] inheritance the word when God gives a
[1:01:26] message a word in every generation as he
[1:01:29] has down through the seven churches it
[1:01:31] has not been a word that has left people
[1:01:33] in their condition and told them they're
[1:01:36] alright and you know God loves you no
[1:01:38] sir but it's a word that came to address
[1:01:41] the condition and call the people out of
[1:01:44] that condition and into that of the land
[1:01:47] that God was ordaining for those people
[1:01:50] you see Satan himself
[1:01:52] is so subtle he won't try to take away
[1:01:54] the word per se from people but he wants
[1:01:57] to remove the land and the land itself
[1:02:00] is the real true baptism of the Holy
[1:02:03] Ghost the new birth because without the
[1:02:05] new birth the land itself does not yield
[1:02:08] its strength it does not yield its power
[1:02:10] you can rest there within the word but
[1:02:13] yet you don't have the real full
[1:02:15] spiritual blessings that is promised to
[1:02:18] those who are really in the word and the
[1:02:21] word being the body of Jesus Christ you
[1:02:24] see God's desire is not just to bring
[1:02:26] you to a church the Prophet himself
[1:02:29] speaking in God's chosen place of
[1:02:31] worship 1965 in November he says Here I
[1:02:34] am with a message and I'm calling you to
[1:02:37] come out of this mess
[1:02:39] and if I'm calling you to come out of
[1:02:41] this mess aren't I gonna take you cease
[1:02:44] asking a question
[1:02:45] because of this message thank you jump
[1:02:49] you are you with me
[1:02:51] the the reality of the message is it
[1:02:54] does not produce wandering it is a
[1:02:58] positional placing in Jesus Christ alone
[1:03:03] somebody that's an effect of this word
[1:03:07] so within it then he asks the question
[1:03:10] where am I going to take you he said am
[1:03:11] I gonna take you to Branham Tabernacle
[1:03:13] it's as much at fault as the rest of
[1:03:16] them but he said there's only one place
[1:03:17] that I can take you there's only one
[1:03:19] place of safety and that is in Jesus
[1:03:23] Christ for he is God's chosen place of
[1:03:27] worship a rest of church is not our
[1:03:30] resting place even if we were to go to
[1:03:32] Branum Tabernacle that is not our
[1:03:34] resting place but our resting place is
[1:03:38] in the person of Jesus Christ and there
[1:03:41] by one spirit we are baptized into one
[1:03:44] body and that body is the Word of God
[1:03:48] it takes the power of God to move down
[1:03:51] and get a hold of the believers and to
[1:03:53] lift you and I out of the chaos of Egypt
[1:03:56] and point you and I to the promise of
[1:03:59] God the full inheritance that belongs to
[1:04:02] you and I and the
[1:04:03] just say like this in this hour it's not
[1:04:06] just the baptism of the Holy Ghost but
[1:04:08] the baptism of the Holy Ghost it leads
[1:04:11] itself all the way to the change of the
[1:04:13] body because there's not another age
[1:04:16] there's not another message to come
[1:04:18] after this we are at the end time we are
[1:04:21] at that time where it's time for the
[1:04:23] change and the rapture the Church of the
[1:04:25] Living God we're standing in that hour
[1:04:29] no repeater God you see Jesus he already
[1:04:33] said my sheep know my voice but you see
[1:04:37] his sheep recognize him as he comes by
[1:04:41] signs and wonders is that right but
[1:04:44] remember there's got to be a voice
[1:04:46] accompany that sign I'd wonder if that
[1:04:48] voice I don't care how it sign and
[1:04:50] wonder if that voice points back to a
[1:04:52] previous Junction it's not of God come
[1:04:56] on the signs and wonders it's not of God
[1:04:58] that's why we look for what is being
[1:05:02] said no matter what signs and wonders
[1:05:06] are done if the voice that comes and
[1:05:08] wants to look at signs and wonders as a
[1:05:10] vindication of we don't need this
[1:05:12] anymore
[1:05:13] all we need is this and all we need of
[1:05:14] that that ain't of God those signs and
[1:05:17] wonders it's not of God it's not for the
[1:05:19] people of God but the people of God
[1:05:21] notice what signs and wonders will do it
[1:05:23] accompanies the voice of God to confirm
[1:05:26] the word to our life for you and I to
[1:05:28] March with authority knowing that the
[1:05:31] very Living God is in our midst and I'm
[1:05:34] so glad and we need him to encourage us
[1:05:36] oh glory now watch this how that Paul
[1:05:41] would bring this around on condena on
[1:05:43] credentials in Romans 11 verse 13 for I
[1:05:46] speak to you Gentiles in as much as I am
[1:05:49] the apostle of the Gentiles I magnify
[1:05:52] mine office and watch what Paul's doing
[1:05:55] here many other places we could look
[1:05:58] within the scripture but Paul is letting
[1:06:00] it be known this is my office
[1:06:02] Paul is not bragging Paul is simply
[1:06:05] stating his position are you with me you
[1:06:09] see within this right here for the
[1:06:11] people of God in that hour it did not
[1:06:13] make them think of Paul has some
[1:06:15] dictator
[1:06:16] some who think no as a matter of fact
[1:06:18] for the beloved of the Lord this is a
[1:06:21] great comfort because listen you want
[1:06:23] somebody who knew who knows who they are
[1:06:26] knows where they're standing is that
[1:06:29] right you've got to have that it's got
[1:06:30] to be somebody who knows I tell you what
[1:06:32] I want somebody when somebody stands
[1:06:34] here and I invite them in I don't want
[1:06:36] somebody that says well I don't know I
[1:06:38] belong I you know I I don't know where
[1:06:40] what church I go to I you don't need to
[1:06:42] stand here in this pulpit then because
[1:06:44] you know why you don't even know where
[1:06:46] you belong you don't know where your
[1:06:47] position you don't know where it's out
[1:06:49] over the center but we're positioned and
[1:06:51] tries but we ought to know where we
[1:06:53] belong in the body of Jesus Christ we
[1:06:55] ought to know our election and our
[1:06:57] calling and make it sure we ought to
[1:06:59] know where we belong
[1:07:05] romans 15 verse 13 what's how paul goes
[1:07:08] on to this now the god of Hope fill you
[1:07:10] with all joy and peace in believing joy
[1:07:16] and peace in believing that ye may
[1:07:18] abound in Hope through the power of the
[1:07:23] Holy Ghost and I myself also am
[1:07:26] persuaded of you my brethren that ye
[1:07:28] also are full of goodness filled with
[1:07:30] all knowledge able also to admonish one
[1:07:33] another nevertheless brethren I have
[1:07:36] written the more boldly unto you in some
[1:07:38] sort as putting you in mind because the
[1:07:40] grace that is given to me of God that I
[1:07:44] should be the minister of Jesus Christ
[1:07:47] to the Gentiles ministering the gospel
[1:07:50] of God that the offering up of the
[1:07:53] Gentiles might be acceptable being
[1:07:55] sanctified by the Holy Ghost so Paul you
[1:08:00] know he's not Paul's not taken back and
[1:08:02] said well you know I just you know I
[1:08:04] know Paul is is stating here I know what
[1:08:07] God has called me to do I am the
[1:08:11] minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles
[1:08:14] when the Prophet went beyond the curtain
[1:08:16] of time what did he ask
[1:08:18] he asked will Paul have to stand and
[1:08:21] give an account and he said yes they
[1:08:24] said yes he will and he will be accepted
[1:08:27] What did he say
[1:08:28] he said I have preached just exactly
[1:08:32] what Paul preached and what did we say
[1:08:37] we're resting on that so the same voice
[1:08:42] of this message this hour
[1:08:45] it cannot dove it cannot be VA from that
[1:08:48] of the gospel of Jesus Christ that was
[1:08:51] committed to Paul but you know what it
[1:08:53] is it's called glory be to God
[1:08:55] it's called accomplishing what he
[1:08:57] started with you and ask sometimes get
[1:08:59] on projects and we bought off more than
[1:09:01] we can chew we get on a project and
[1:09:03] we're ready to start looking in the
[1:09:04] phone book who in the world can I come
[1:09:06] fix can I come to get this mess let me
[1:09:08] tell you something to God of he'll glory
[1:09:10] that started this work that started it
[1:09:13] out when he separated from the body of
[1:09:16] Jesus Christ what was needed to bring
[1:09:18] forth that body and they tell you
[1:09:20] something there has been things down
[1:09:21] through the ages where Satan is sought
[1:09:24] to come here but God's promise will not
[1:09:26] be defeated God's Word cannot be
[1:09:29] defeated God has promised that he will
[1:09:32] present to himself a glorious church
[1:09:34] without spot wrinkle or blemish you know
[1:09:38] the very power of God that cleansing our
[1:09:41] so changing our very nature that same
[1:09:44] God will produce in our life where there
[1:09:46] will not be one wrinkle what God starts
[1:09:55] he finishes how many times look what
[1:09:58] Paul look look Paul's the one he that
[1:10:01] began the good work in you shall perform
[1:10:03] it to the day of Jesus Christ is there
[1:10:07] right looking unto Jesus the author and
[1:10:10] the finisher of our faith you seek us
[1:10:12] Paul himself was not just a believer he
[1:10:15] was a believer Paul was one who had been
[1:10:18] touched by the Living God and to know
[1:10:20] that what God has said in his word he
[1:10:23] will perform and he will fulfill Paul
[1:10:26] was one who knew that there are names
[1:10:28] that were written before the foundation
[1:10:30] of the world that we were chosen in
[1:10:32] Christ Jesus and Paul knew there's no
[1:10:35] way that you and I could ever get away
[1:10:37] from it but God Himself will
[1:10:40] is the way that he would bring us back
[1:10:43] to what he has ordained verse 17 I have
[1:10:52] therefore where of I may glory through
[1:10:54] Jesus Christ in those things which
[1:10:56] pertain to God for I will not dare to
[1:10:59] speak of any of those things which God
[1:11:00] hath not wrought by me to make the
[1:11:03] Gentiles obedient by word and deed
[1:11:06] through mighty signs and wonders by the
[1:11:09] power of the Spirit of God
[1:11:12] notice this obedience and word indeed
[1:11:15] there was signs and wonders that
[1:11:17] accompanied Paul's ministry and you know
[1:11:21] as we read this last week you read in
[1:11:23] the book of Acts signs and wonders
[1:11:24] accompanied the believers for what
[1:11:28] reason
[1:11:28] just for God to show that he's God no
[1:11:30] but God was letting it be known listen
[1:11:34] to what they're saying come on somebody
[1:11:37] you say well they weren't Paul I know
[1:11:39] they weren't Paul but it was Jesus and a
[1:11:41] mini member body you with me how God
[1:11:44] started that church now Paul himself
[1:11:46] Peter recognized the commission that
[1:11:49] Paul has been entrusted with as a matter
[1:11:51] of fact Peter admonished some of them
[1:11:53] and said look there's some of y'all you
[1:11:55] don't understand what Paul's saying but
[1:11:57] just believe and recognize that God is
[1:12:00] with him because there's some who are
[1:12:02] unlearned they cannot they wrestle with
[1:12:05] what Paul was saying they try to make
[1:12:07] sense of it God does not interested in
[1:12:09] you and I'm making sense of his word he
[1:12:14] is his own interpreter you see what
[1:12:19] happens is is a time where people say oh
[1:12:22] I was told to put that on the shelf I
[1:12:24] was told if I didn't believe that just
[1:12:25] set it up there you see if I see what
[1:12:27] their belief was their faith was based
[1:12:29] on their ability to explain that's
[1:12:32] science
[1:12:32] but faith which is of God is not based
[1:12:35] on the ability of this right here to be
[1:12:37] able to explain it but faith accepts
[1:12:40] what God said because God said it and
[1:12:43] when God has said it it's gonna be how
[1:12:46] is it gonna be I don't know the Prophet
[1:12:48] said when he made known to me two signs
[1:12:50] were to come
[1:12:51] my ministry he said I didn't know how
[1:12:53] was gonna happen I didn't understand it
[1:12:56] he did not know the transitions even
[1:12:58] when brother Brennan was standing there
[1:12:59] I believe it was in Illinois and he's
[1:13:01] standing there had been ministering
[1:13:03] there the first sign the first pool and
[1:13:05] right there on the platform here comes
[1:13:07] the discernment your name is so-and-so
[1:13:08] sister I see this in this and that right
[1:13:11] been in there a transition into that of
[1:13:13] the second sign or the second pole right
[1:13:15] there he had no control over the
[1:13:17] transition can't you see in your life in
[1:13:20] my life it's not you and I that has
[1:13:22] control over the transitions all we have
[1:13:25] to do is walk in obedience to the Living
[1:13:28] God and God Himself that knows what's in
[1:13:30] our lives he will perform the transition
[1:13:33] and alert us to what's needed at that
[1:13:35] time
[1:13:35] Omaha will know when it comes time at
[1:13:38] that moment in a twinkling of an eye
[1:13:40] because we will see our loved ones that
[1:13:43] will appear to us it will be a
[1:13:45] transition in that moment where the very
[1:13:49] atoms of our body are changed God holds
[1:13:54] the transitions you see it's just like
[1:13:56] in your life when a person is soon when
[1:14:00] they're struggling they're trying to
[1:14:02] make their walk with God you can't make
[1:14:04] your walk with God you've got to submit
[1:14:07] you've got to fall in love with him
[1:14:09] you've got to let it be him and nothing
[1:14:12] else you see if you can let it be him
[1:14:15] and nothing else let's take for example
[1:14:16] let's say you got a person tonight then
[1:14:18] maybe they're bound with drugs and
[1:14:20] they've come here and they say you know
[1:14:22] what I want to be free of these drugs I
[1:14:24] just you know what I'm tired I'm tired
[1:14:26] of being a servant and a slave to these
[1:14:28] drugs now God can move for them and help
[1:14:31] them to see that he indeed is a living
[1:14:33] God and he cares about their need but if
[1:14:36] in their heart maybe they would rise up
[1:14:37] in their heart and say you know what
[1:14:39] there is something greater
[1:14:41] you know I want to get in him I know
[1:14:43] that he is my deliverance I know that he
[1:14:46] is all that I need and if I get in him
[1:14:49] and he's my all and all then I have
[1:14:51] access to deliverance I have access to
[1:14:54] healing I have access to everything
[1:14:57] because he is my all in all
[1:15:01] you see we just don't want to be riders
[1:15:04] that come along and we make God as an
[1:15:06] errand boy of what God can do for us can
[1:15:09] God do this for us and God do that for
[1:15:11] so most the time what happens with that
[1:15:12] it ends up being in grateful people and
[1:15:15] the only reason that they serve God and
[1:15:17] the only reason that they'll try to live
[1:15:18] for God is because of what can God can
[1:15:21] do for them but when you recognize what
[1:15:23] he's already done for you that he came
[1:15:25] down from glory and he came down and
[1:15:28] shed his blood and gave His life and
[1:15:30] sent the Holy Ghost after you the
[1:15:32] ministry of divine grace it reaches
[1:15:35] around your heart
[1:15:36] in a love affair and you recognize he
[1:15:38] has already done for you the greatest
[1:15:40] thing that can ever be done for you he
[1:15:43] made a way that you could come back home
[1:15:46] when that grep surrounds your heart
[1:15:49] everything else is secondary now watch
[1:15:55] how Paul would place this here let me go
[1:16:01] on Ephesians 1 Paul could say Paul an
[1:16:03] apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of
[1:16:05] God to the Saints which are at Ephesus
[1:16:07] and to the faithful in Christ Jesus
[1:16:10] grace be to you and peace from God our
[1:16:13] Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:16:15] blessed be the God and father of our
[1:16:17] Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us
[1:16:19] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[1:16:23] places in Christ he already have are you
[1:16:29] with me
[1:16:30] Paul where is Paul reading Paul is not
[1:16:33] down here on this level
[1:16:36] Paul is reading to what has already been
[1:16:39] allotted to you and I it's already there
[1:16:43] every promise but we've got to get into
[1:16:46] the land where the promise can be made
[1:16:50] manifest
[1:16:52] that we should be according as he had
[1:16:55] chosen us in him before the foundation
[1:16:56] of the world that we should be holy and
[1:16:58] without blame before him in love having
[1:17:01] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:17:04] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:17:07] according to the good will good pleasure
[1:17:11] of his will now when you look at this
[1:17:14] let me just refer to this here this
[1:17:16] quote you can read it will send it out
[1:17:18] but a blended random makes us very clear
[1:17:21] he is speaking in God's chosen place of
[1:17:23] worship and it soon when I you look at
[1:17:26] about the RAM speaking it it's the heart
[1:17:27] of the gospel
[1:17:29] God does not bring us out to just leave
[1:17:32] us but there is unexpected in that God
[1:17:35] is ministering from you see when God
[1:17:38] when we look at this book of Ephesians
[1:17:41] that were reading from this book of
[1:17:43] Ephesians it parallels that of Joshua
[1:17:46] Joshua itself the Prophet would call it
[1:17:48] the book of redemption in the Old
[1:17:51] Testament it is a place where each and
[1:17:53] every one had their place already
[1:17:55] allotted and given to him when they were
[1:17:58] being birthed remember their mother
[1:18:00] would call out the name how did she know
[1:18:02] what they because it was spiritually
[1:18:04] given to her and within that name it
[1:18:07] held within it the actual identity and
[1:18:10] location and the place when they came
[1:18:14] there that the spiritual blessings could
[1:18:16] be made manifest about their life but
[1:18:18] you see what it took God already has
[1:18:21] ordained it it's taken just submission
[1:18:24] to his will and his leading you see the
[1:18:27] whole part of signs and wonders is to
[1:18:29] build our faith in the voice of God it's
[1:18:32] to recognize his voice now listen God's
[1:18:35] voice itself this is not just confined
[1:18:37] to a certain state or a certain accent
[1:18:40] but God's voice is the very Spirit of
[1:18:44] God are you with me the same Holy Spirit
[1:18:47] is speaking the word the same God that
[1:18:50] gave Moses the credentials the same God
[1:18:52] gave Joshua credentials the same God
[1:18:55] gave credentials all the way down
[1:18:57] through even the New Testament where God
[1:18:59] would have the fifl Ministry dog would
[1:19:02] give them necessary credentials that
[1:19:04] were there
[1:19:05] would be activated just as he has within
[1:19:07] our life as spiritual believers now
[1:19:10] watch this redemption itself is two
[1:19:13] parts it's coming out of and going into
[1:19:16] so just to come out it's not enough but
[1:19:19] we must go into so when we look at that
[1:19:23] but the RAM talks about there's two
[1:19:24] different aspects of God's command and
[1:19:26] to think of that he says that as you
[1:19:29] know we're in our journey that journey
[1:19:31] that they were in it represents for our
[1:19:33] day as they were in the journey coming
[1:19:35] from Egypt into a promised land so we
[1:19:37] have come out of the world of Egypt
[1:19:39] chaos and our on our road to a promised
[1:19:41] land in my father's house are many
[1:19:44] mansions if it wasn't so I would have
[1:19:46] told you so you see where that we are
[1:19:49] headed to in the promises of God is that
[1:19:52] of where for the very change of the body
[1:19:56] in my father's house are many mansions
[1:19:58] now who has all of this Christ himself
[1:20:01] remember in Christ is the Millennium he
[1:20:04] is our headstone it is in him that all
[1:20:08] of the promises lay for the RAM goes on
[1:20:14] he says remember it's the law that
[1:20:16] brings us to recognize we're wrong but
[1:20:18] it's grace that forgives us you see
[1:20:21] there's a necessary part of law law
[1:20:23] itself will bring conviction you're
[1:20:25] wrong and you recognize my I am wrong
[1:20:28] I'm dead wrong I need help and when you
[1:20:31] recognize you need help Lord Jesus
[1:20:33] forgive me Lord God Lord I accept you us
[1:20:36] as my Savior grace steps in and it does
[1:20:40] what you cannot do grace steps in after
[1:20:44] law has done what it needs to do great
[1:20:48] steps in now let's watch this in Romans
[1:20:51] 1 verse 16 for I am not ashamed of the
[1:20:53] gospel of Christ for it is the power of
[1:20:55] God unto salvation to everyone that
[1:20:57] believeth to the Jew first and also to
[1:21:02] the Greek for therein is the
[1:21:04] righteousness of God revealed from faith
[1:21:06] to faith see what it is God giving faith
[1:21:10] and then from that faith you walk in the
[1:21:12] light that God has opened to your heart
[1:21:15] maybe God has touched your heart and you
[1:21:16] recognize I need to give my life
[1:21:18] the Lord it takes faith to rise within
[1:21:21] your heart to recognize but that's for
[1:21:24] me but I he died for my sins I'm a
[1:21:27] sinner and I need him what is it it's
[1:21:29] faith that rises within your heart to be
[1:21:32] able to even make that step and accept
[1:21:36] what he's already done and as you walk
[1:21:38] faithful within that you watch
[1:21:40] righteousness of God is revealed from
[1:21:43] faith to faith but you see if you're
[1:21:46] looking at well I got this and I've got
[1:21:48] that you're looking at the wrong thing
[1:21:49] you need to look to him because he that
[1:21:53] has called you faithful is he to perform
[1:21:57] Romans 5:10 for if when we were enemies
[1:22:00] we were reconciled to God by the death
[1:22:03] of his son notice we were reconciled to
[1:22:07] God by the death of his son much more
[1:22:09] being reconciled we shall be saved by
[1:22:14] his life see Paul is picking up that you
[1:22:19] and I were already the purchase was
[1:22:21] already made for us
[1:22:25] you just didn't recognize it the payment
[1:22:29] was already made for you but then the
[1:22:32] good news comes along it touches your
[1:22:35] heart you recognize I'm a sinner but it
[1:22:37] points that out to and says hey I
[1:22:39] already paved the way for you and then
[1:22:41] you recognize and say yes Lord Jesus I'm
[1:22:44] coming home what is it he's reconciling
[1:22:47] you to himself it is a voice
[1:22:50] accompanying a sign and a wonder to
[1:22:53] bring you to himself not just to leave
[1:22:58] you in a state of limbo and not only so
[1:23:00] but we also join God through our Lord
[1:23:02] Jesus Christ by whom we have now
[1:23:06] received the atonement how many know
[1:23:09] that Paul when he writes there I believe
[1:23:11] it's in 2nd Corinthians 3 where Paul
[1:23:13] writes about he hath made us able
[1:23:15] ministers of the New Testament you know
[1:23:19] what I'm talking about Abel no he not us
[1:23:21] not our abilities he hath made us able
[1:23:24] ministers capable equipped oh my we have
[1:23:30] been commended
[1:23:31] by the Living God has ministers of the
[1:23:34] New Testament
[1:23:35] what is that New Testament it is the
[1:23:37] word and the spirit it is the life of
[1:23:41] Jesus Christ the supreme sacrifice the
[1:23:44] groom himself he is writing his own life
[1:23:48] in the life of the believer able
[1:23:54] ministers of the New Testament now watch
[1:23:56] this second Corinthians 5:17 therefore
[1:23:58] if any man be in Christ he is a new
[1:24:00] creature old things are passed away
[1:24:04] behold all things are become new and all
[1:24:08] things are of God who hath reconciled us
[1:24:12] to himself by Jesus Christ and have
[1:24:15] given to us the Ministry of
[1:24:17] reconciliation hello Paul your boasting
[1:24:20] no Paul's just Satan Satan what he has
[1:24:22] he what's he doing is the people's faith
[1:24:25] are rising remember what he told the
[1:24:27] Corinthian church you had a lot of guys
[1:24:29] that were going around they had signs
[1:24:31] and wonders and they were saying I'm a
[1:24:33] Hebrew and I'm this and that and Paul
[1:24:35] said hold on just a moment would you
[1:24:37] bear with me in my folly they're Hebrew
[1:24:39] I'm Hebrew they're Israel I am Israelite
[1:24:42] and Paul let it be known that I have
[1:24:44] been approved among you God has approved
[1:24:47] the ministry Paul would go so far to
[1:24:50] tell the Corinthian church that I don't
[1:24:53] need letters of commendation to come
[1:24:56] unto you but you are our commendation
[1:24:59] you are our epistles that are written
[1:25:02] from within our heart notice the
[1:25:04] revelation was here and now that same
[1:25:07] revelation that was resting in the able
[1:25:10] ministers of God that same pillar fire
[1:25:13] did you shoot out by way of the word and
[1:25:15] in row upon the tables of the heart what
[1:25:18] did it do it activated the credentials
[1:25:21] as believers in the word for that our
[1:25:25] Torah be to God he has come given to us
[1:25:29] the Ministry of reconciliation are you
[1:25:32] catching this reconcile means to bring
[1:25:34] two things in harmony this Ministry of
[1:25:38] reconciliation he certainly be known
[1:25:41] that there has been a loosening of a
[1:25:43] ministry
[1:25:44] that brings harmony harmony between God
[1:25:48] and man that which is able to do away
[1:25:51] with a sinful nature that which is able
[1:25:54] to join God and man together once again
[1:25:57] as he was in Christ Jesus Jesus Christ
[1:26:01] notice here to wit that God was in
[1:26:03] Christ reconciling the world unto
[1:26:06] himself not imputing their trespasses
[1:26:08] unto them and hath committed unto us the
[1:26:12] word of reconciliation you see Paul
[1:26:18] could let him know that the ministry
[1:26:20] that you're under is not a wilderness
[1:26:22] ministry it's not a ministry that even
[1:26:27] is a ministry that points you back to
[1:26:29] the signs of Egypt come on somebody pro
[1:26:33] is letting it be known this ministry is
[1:26:36] the fulfillment and the ministry of the
[1:26:39] atonement the same life that was there
[1:26:43] in Jesus Christ that same life has come
[1:26:47] forth to be present in the believer
[1:26:53] what's this now then we are ambassadors
[1:26:56] for Christ as though God did beseech you
[1:26:59] by us we pray you in Christ's stead be
[1:27:03] ye reconciled to God
[1:27:06] glory for he hath made him to be sin for
[1:27:09] us who knew no sin that we might be made
[1:27:12] the righteousness of God in Christ 2nd
[1:27:16] Thessalonians 2:13 we are bound to give
[1:27:19] thanks always to God for you brethren
[1:27:21] beloved of the Lord because God hath
[1:27:24] from the beginning chosen you to
[1:27:28] salvation through sanctification of the
[1:27:30] Spirit and belief of the truth Wow I
[1:27:34] chose no you didn't choose he chose your
[1:27:37] choice is only reflecting a choice he
[1:27:39] already made you couldn't make that
[1:27:42] choice if he didn't make that choice so
[1:27:43] the choice that we make now reflects the
[1:27:47] choice that he already made before the
[1:27:49] foundation of the world are you with me
[1:27:52] so it's not a struggling and persevering
[1:27:55] in us
[1:27:57] it's us yielding it's not a sitting it's
[1:28:00] us yielding we're on - look at this he
[1:28:05] called you by our gospel he's letting to
[1:28:13] know there is no other gospel he has
[1:28:17] called you by our gospel evidently this
[1:28:22] gospel it was a gospel that there were
[1:28:24] other Saints who were a part of the
[1:28:28] inheritance of light as well to the
[1:28:33] obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus
[1:28:36] Christ now think of this how that Paul
[1:28:40] would place it in the book of Romans
[1:28:42] chapter 10 remember he's riding here at
[1:28:44] the first part I don't have time for all
[1:28:46] the verses but Paul was riding there
[1:28:48] those who are reading the Jews here they
[1:28:50] are they're reading they're reading all
[1:28:52] of these prophecies and Paul was letting
[1:28:53] them know you're reading I'm saying them
[1:28:55] in your mouth but what is needed the
[1:28:56] word it's not here not there the word is
[1:28:58] nigh thee even in thy mouth but what's
[1:29:01] needed faith in the word so Paul goes on
[1:29:06] to say in verse 9 in verse 8 sorry but
[1:29:09] what saith the word is nigh thee even in
[1:29:11] thy mouth and in thy heart
[1:29:13] what is it the Word of Faith which we
[1:29:15] preach you see what was being ministered
[1:29:19] if they could just say be it unto me
[1:29:25] that's all they had to say be it unto me
[1:29:28] well how don't worry about how will be
[1:29:31] it unto me that if thou shalt confess
[1:29:35] with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt
[1:29:40] believe in thine heart that God hath
[1:29:42] raised him from the dead thou shalt be
[1:29:44] saved for with the heart man believeth
[1:29:47] unto righteousness still in born again
[1:29:53] still is in the full inheritance but you
[1:29:56] got to have a start man's got to believe
[1:29:59] unto righteousness but how can he
[1:30:01] believe if the righteousness of God is
[1:30:03] not made known before you how can you
[1:30:05] know that you can live our real
[1:30:07] overcoming life if that's not preached
[1:30:09] before you you're only going to
[1:30:11] as high as it's preached that's right
[1:30:14] you want to say Lord shut the hide off
[1:30:16] of me is that right I don't want to know
[1:30:20] I want the word this standard to be
[1:30:22] preached because you know what that
[1:30:24] standard being preached when it cuts us
[1:30:26] remember God knows what he's doing he's
[1:30:29] not cutting as far as your eye he's
[1:30:31] actually liberating you and I from holes
[1:30:34] within our eye and that word if we'll
[1:30:37] let the word have preeminence in our
[1:30:39] life the word will actually free because
[1:30:41] remember the Spirit of God is not a
[1:30:44] spirit of bondage it does not bring fear
[1:30:46] but the Spirit of God brings a loosening
[1:30:50] and Liberty to the children of God it
[1:30:53] lets you know who you are well for the
[1:30:57] world with the heart man believeth unto
[1:30:59] righteousness and with the mouth
[1:31:01] confession is made unto salvation you
[1:31:03] know so many times we allow this to be
[1:31:05] placed so far back there but remember
[1:31:07] when God has done something for you and
[1:31:10] it has touched your heart maybe you
[1:31:12] stood right here and were prayed for
[1:31:13] maybe the Spirit of God has touched your
[1:31:15] heart with something that God has made
[1:31:17] known to you I'm free I'm delivered this
[1:31:19] is mine do you realize that was not your
[1:31:22] mind up here but your heart that
[1:31:24] actually was moved in a place to believe
[1:31:27] and when it's made in a place to believe
[1:31:29] you make a confession and say the Lord
[1:31:32] has healed me brother Samuel you are
[1:31:34] going to believe what happened when I
[1:31:36] confess that God had healed me the very
[1:31:38] next day I had the worst attacks come
[1:31:42] upon my life hole glory be to God
[1:31:44] that's the sure sign that you're healed
[1:31:47] that is divine healing you see that's
[1:31:51] the time to stand when the win it's made
[1:31:54] known the promise you take faith and you
[1:31:57] stand there and confess it when anything
[1:32:00] comes contrary to that you come right
[1:32:02] back to it and said but God has spoke to
[1:32:05] my heart but God has ministered to my
[1:32:07] life and you stand there right on it you
[1:32:09] know what that is that's taking faith
[1:32:11] and standing there in the midst of the
[1:32:13] promise how many times brother Graham
[1:32:16] gave the example you see a deer that's
[1:32:17] hit on the side of the road or an animal
[1:32:19] you look at it another day or two days
[1:32:22] it's swelled up and blowed up so big
[1:32:24] why it's set is that right you look at
[1:32:29] how that after a person is prayed for
[1:32:31] you watch how the enemy that'll try
[1:32:32] you'll try to set in I'll tell you right
[1:32:34] now right here there's prayer there was
[1:32:36] there was testimonies that came right
[1:32:38] out of last Thursday testimonies from
[1:32:41] right here that came of God's healing
[1:32:43] touch hey there right sister Miranda
[1:32:46] could not even bend her hand and move it
[1:32:48] together and the Spirit of God came
[1:32:50] right down and moved for our sister in a
[1:32:52] special way that wasn't me that was God
[1:32:54] that was gone that was that was what he
[1:32:56] was doing when my Aunt Linda stood right
[1:32:59] here she sent me a text on Saturday
[1:33:01] night she said Samuel she said when you
[1:33:03] prayed for me she said there was a
[1:33:05] warmth power that went right down over
[1:33:08] my shoulder she said I believe it is
[1:33:11] finished it's over with let me tell you
[1:33:14] something God knows what he's doing
[1:33:16] God knows what he's doing why would God
[1:33:19] do that
[1:33:20] he's confirming his faithfulness to you
[1:33:23] and I I don't believe that's the only
[1:33:27] testimonies to come either but you see
[1:33:30] there must be a voice that come is it
[1:33:32] it's not just to rally around it's
[1:33:34] pointing us to the Living God
[1:33:36] to let God have his way in our life we
[1:33:38] can have signs and wonders but if it
[1:33:40] don't build your faith you don't allow
[1:33:42] it to accumulate in your life where your
[1:33:44] faith rises within the Word of God to
[1:33:46] recognize that whether we're in the
[1:33:48] after service the pre service and when
[1:33:50] the word is coming forth your faith can
[1:33:52] rise within that word
[1:33:54] you see that's what signs and wonders
[1:33:56] come in that our faith would rise in the
[1:33:58] word because it is the word whereby the
[1:34:01] Spirit comes in and leads us to victory
[1:34:07] whosoever believeth on him shall not be
[1:34:10] ashamed for there is no difference
[1:34:13] between the Jew and the Greek for the
[1:34:14] same lord over all is rich unto all that
[1:34:16] call on him for whosoever shall call
[1:34:19] upon the name of the Lord shall be saved
[1:34:24] how then shall they call on him in whom
[1:34:27] they have not believed how can they
[1:34:32] believe if they haven't heard right how
[1:34:37] can they believe if they haven't heard
[1:34:41] how shall they hear without a preacher
[1:34:43] and how shall they preach how very
[1:34:45] important except they be sent oh my I
[1:34:52] want you to just to think about this
[1:34:54] just for a moment you remember when they
[1:34:58] came out of Egypt let's just close on
[1:35:02] this
[1:35:03] God's desire remember is to bring him to
[1:35:08] a full inheritance they come out of
[1:35:13] Egypt there were different tests along
[1:35:17] the way the Bible records it in various
[1:35:21] places God having saved the people out
[1:35:24] of Egypt
[1:35:25] destroyed son in the wilderness so we
[1:35:32] see that there is a journey that is made
[1:35:35] the Lord Jesus himself remember when
[1:35:38] there were many disciples that were
[1:35:40] following him in John eight What did he
[1:35:43] say if ye continue on then you're my
[1:35:50] disciples indeed in Colossians 1 Paul
[1:35:56] goes on to talk about the reconciliation
[1:35:59] things in heaven and in earth see Paul's
[1:36:04] bringing that this reconciliation it
[1:36:07] leads to the very writing the writing
[1:36:11] correcting of all wrongs and he brings
[1:36:16] the deity of Jesus Christ down in
[1:36:18] Colossians chapter 1 and Paul brings it
[1:36:22] to a place so that the people will know
[1:36:24] that this dispensation that God of the
[1:36:26] gospel that's been given to me it's
[1:36:29] given to me for you to fulfill the Word
[1:36:34] of God how can we fulfill it by
[1:36:37] believing him who has spoken it he it
[1:36:43] must be him in us to fulfill that word I
[1:36:49] want you to think of this when Moses
[1:36:53] when there were interruptions along the
[1:36:56] way that happened that God knew about
[1:36:59] God let Moses Noah
[1:37:02] I've sent mine angel before thee mine
[1:37:07] angel is here to keep you in the way
[1:37:12] he's here to bring you unto the place
[1:37:15] that I have prepared for you only obey
[1:37:19] his voice I want you to think of this
[1:37:21] here was Cornelius and them in Cornelius
[1:37:24] house
[1:37:27] they had believed and God told him he
[1:37:32] said I want you to send for one named
[1:37:34] Peter and I want you to hear what he has
[1:37:37] to say well why couldn't God just tell
[1:37:40] him why couldn't God tell her God works
[1:37:46] through his body you see that this is
[1:37:51] the this is God's desire is that we
[1:37:53] would recognize him and believe him now
[1:38:01] we have to receive the credentials that
[1:38:04] God gives to us Peter did not have the
[1:38:08] credentials that Paul had but he would
[1:38:10] have the same God that activated the
[1:38:13] credentials in his life to be able to
[1:38:15] manifest that the people could recognize
[1:38:18] it's God think of it when a policy it
[1:38:23] was a policy oh my a polishing man
[1:38:29] Paulus was preaching the first two pools
[1:38:31] I mean he was laying it out he was
[1:38:34] preaching by the scriptures Jesus is the
[1:38:39] Christ but a key point says knowing only
[1:38:43] the baptism of John you see he couldn't
[1:38:48] preach anything more than what was made
[1:38:51] known to him now you look at this we
[1:38:54] know what happens to a policy there is
[1:38:56] some real spirit field sweet Christians
[1:39:00] by the name of Aquila and Priscilla that
[1:39:01] when they're in a meeting and they hear
[1:39:03] a Paul is preaching
[1:39:05] they didn't help both themselves they
[1:39:08] this guy even deep man
[1:39:10] good lord this guy look at him first and
[1:39:14] second pull preacher no God would have
[1:39:19] never used him and it would have showed
[1:39:21] they didn't have what they thought they
[1:39:23] had are you with me
[1:39:25] but you see within it they come not
[1:39:27] goodness it's something begin to arise
[1:39:29] within their heart to wear that maybe
[1:39:31] let's say that a Paulus was standing
[1:39:33] around and maybe he was shaking the
[1:39:35] different brothers hands and everyone
[1:39:36] said my policy my goodness that was
[1:39:38] wonderful and the chromers all said hey
[1:39:40] a pulse won't go for a coffee
[1:39:43] oh yeah wonderful and we really
[1:39:46] appreciate that tonight indeed he is the
[1:39:48] Christ really really good
[1:39:50] they got him maybe they ordered their
[1:39:52] loft tapes and cappuccinos and whatever
[1:39:54] more and they had a policy round then
[1:39:56] the Bible says they begin to expound to
[1:39:58] him more perfectly the way of the Lord I
[1:40:01] asked you was appalled us not ordained
[1:40:04] of God he was was he not ordained to
[1:40:07] preach this gospel and be born of the
[1:40:09] Spirit of God he was then live didn't
[1:40:12] God just do it ah but everything you see
[1:40:14] in the book of Acts God is not making
[1:40:16] people dependent upon themselves this is
[1:40:20] a body move it is not people who are an
[1:40:24] island - of themselves that's to miss
[1:40:27] the program of God all I need is just
[1:40:32] myself that's all I need let's call all
[1:40:35] I need is the Holy Ghost
[1:40:36] that's all I need you do need the Holy
[1:40:38] Ghost but the Holy Ghost in you will
[1:40:40] make you aware that you are part of the
[1:40:42] local body and part of the greater body
[1:40:44] of Jesus Christ it does not make you a
[1:40:46] body unto yourself and it doesn't make
[1:40:50] you self-sufficient it makes you reliant
[1:40:53] on him and it makes you aware that I'm a
[1:40:55] part of a body I need my brother and I
[1:40:57] need my sister I hope you realize this I
[1:40:59] do not look like you I look at things
[1:41:01] and how that God friends these very
[1:41:03] simple principles but I've watched how
[1:41:05] God has come right along and there might
[1:41:07] have been certain things that I had
[1:41:08] questions on certain things and I can't
[1:41:10] see you know all the light on and God
[1:41:13] will bring it around maybe I'm sitting
[1:41:15] in a meeting maybe it's a minister that
[1:41:16] stands right here and all of a sudden it
[1:41:18] just illuminates in the way that it
[1:41:21] needs to be illuminated you say why
[1:41:23] would God do that cuz I don't have
[1:41:24] everything in myself that I need it's in
[1:41:28] the body you see that's holding the head
[1:41:31] from the body when you make it that
[1:41:34] everything you've got everything you're
[1:41:36] not holding the head from the body
[1:41:37] you're not looking to the head but it
[1:41:41] leads to self will I'm gonna do this I'm
[1:41:45] not know if he's provided it if I have
[1:41:48] need of it you'll make it known he'll
[1:41:50] reveal it to me when I have need of it
[1:41:52] that's the confidence and the trust that
[1:41:55] I have notice what God did listen
[1:41:58] he took Tallis from where he was at to
[1:42:04] where he needed to be
[1:42:06] then Paul watch this Paul goes up to the
[1:42:09] upper coast of Ephesus Paul comes up
[1:42:12] there and he starts preaching
[1:42:13] you realize he said hey uh yeah y'all
[1:42:20] received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:42:21] believe they said Holy Ghost there's a
[1:42:31] Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is loose now
[1:42:35] you say they were believers listen to me
[1:42:37] they were believers in John's ministry
[1:42:41] they were believers in the Ministry of
[1:42:44] the Lord Jesus but they didn't recognize
[1:42:48] unnecessary transition has come it
[1:42:53] wasn't that they didn't want to but they
[1:42:57] weren't aware that the Holy Ghost had
[1:43:02] been poured out you see this comes back
[1:43:04] to a fundamental part believing itself
[1:43:07] it's not the Holy Ghost but it is a gift
[1:43:12] it is a grace of the Holy Spirit to be
[1:43:18] able to believe to where you can believe
[1:43:22] and that same God and move right in your
[1:43:26] heart cleanses your heart takes all the
[1:43:28] world out of your life all the habits
[1:43:30] and desires and he places himself on the
[1:43:33] inside and this word becomes a Living
[1:43:37] Word to you you understand that Jesus
[1:43:41] Christ becomes your everything
[1:43:45] it's not about policing a church it's
[1:43:48] about policing him peace you're all and
[1:43:51] all as a matter of fact you make
[1:43:52] decisions based on him whether you
[1:43:55] accept this whether you go here whether
[1:43:58] you do this it comes around here because
[1:44:01] you know why he is your life and what
[1:44:09] follows your life signs and wonders
[1:44:10] follow them that believe
[1:44:14] here they are now and they receive it
[1:44:18] when they heard this they were baptized
[1:44:21] you didn't have to go any further they
[1:44:24] heard it it where's the water it's time
[1:44:27] to be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:44:29] Christ they responded to that all glory
[1:44:33] be to God has they responded to that
[1:44:35] think of this now as they heard that
[1:44:37] once they were baptized Paul laid his
[1:44:40] hands upon them and they received the
[1:44:42] Holy Ghost well was it the Spirit of God
[1:44:47] traveling through the body dolled in
[1:44:52] parting life taking people who were
[1:44:54] looking then we're looking for the
[1:44:56] Messiah babe I mean if you'd have been
[1:44:58] in the Ephesus church and you said Jesus
[1:45:01] is the Christ
[1:45:01] they were stood up and shouted but oh
[1:45:05] boy when they receive the life of that
[1:45:09] sacrifice inside of em they knew there's
[1:45:12] another step there's more they responded
[1:45:17] how about you and I to that maybe where
[1:45:21] you're at tonight you haven't went maybe
[1:45:23] you've only accepted the Lord Jesus
[1:45:25] Christ your savior maybe you have it
[1:45:27] but that'd be a start and repent ever be
[1:45:32] good start that would be necessary
[1:45:34] that's what the gospel is about not to
[1:45:36] entertain us it's to call us unto
[1:45:38] himself if you've given your life to the
[1:45:43] Lord let god clean your life up let him
[1:45:46] clean you and say lord i want to be
[1:45:48] filled up and if you've been filled up
[1:45:51] as you're looking in this word and it's
[1:45:54] showing and you're seeing yourself in
[1:45:56] the reflection of this word
[1:45:59] remember you want to continue on
[1:46:03] continue on being a faithful doer of the
[1:46:07] word
[1:46:08] not just a hearer not just to hear it
[1:46:11] but be a doer Lord be it unto me Lord
[1:46:14] let this word Lord God let it let it be
[1:46:17] immediate let it so Lord God that world
[1:46:21] I want to become more real in my life
[1:46:23] Lord I want to see more of you Lord God
[1:46:26] you see it takes the Spirit of God to
[1:46:28] show up things within our life sometimes
[1:46:31] you look at things in your life and all
[1:46:33] of a sudden God begins to take the cover
[1:46:35] off of it and you see something that
[1:46:36] didn't maybe seen you know bad but it
[1:46:38] maybe didn't seem as bad maybe it's
[1:46:40] thinking maybe it's action
[1:46:42] maybe it's certain parts about your
[1:46:44] character and the Spirit of God pulls
[1:46:45] that back and you look at it and you see
[1:46:47] it the way that really sees it and you
[1:46:50] recognize Homa Lord this is a hindrance
[1:46:53] to you
