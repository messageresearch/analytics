[37:11] seated here in verse 12 giving things
[37:18] unto the Father which hath made us meet
[37:22] to be partakers of the inheritance of
[37:25] the saints in life who hath delivered us
[37:29] from the power of darkness and hath
[37:31] translated us into the kingdom of his
[37:35] dear son in whom we have redemption
[37:38] through his blood even the forgiveness
[37:41] of sin who is the image of the invisible
[37:45] God the firstborn of every creature for
[37:50] by him we're all things created that are
[37:54] in heaven that are in earth visible and
[37:57] invisible whether they be Thrones or
[38:00] dominions or principalities or powers
[38:02] all things were created by him and for
[38:06] him and he is before all things and by
[38:10] him all things consist
[38:13] we could be talking about none other
[38:16] than God himself
[38:18] which is the Lord Jesus Christ amen and
[38:23] he is the head of the body the church
[38:26] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[38:29] the dead that in all things he might
[38:32] have the preeminence Amen let's just bow
[38:37] our heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly
[38:40] Father Lord what a privilege that we
[38:44] have to be able to come together Lord we
[38:47] are just Lord asking that Lord as we are
[38:52] assembled in the precious name of the
[38:55] Lord Jesus Christ the Lord
[38:57] if there be anything that would be
[38:59] contrary Lord to that precious name Lord
[39:04] we pray that God that right now Lord
[39:06] that it would be dismissed
[39:08] Lord God from the midst of your children
[39:11] Lord and may father you just moving
[39:14] among us in a real special way this
[39:16] morning Lord and just speak to every
[39:19] heart and each life Lord I believe that
[39:22] that's that's the purpose that's the
[39:23] desire Lord and your God to see how that
[39:26] you're able to move upon Lord God every
[39:30] life and every heart and speak to us
[39:32] Lord according to the level of
[39:34] understanding Lord that each of us would
[39:37] have Lord your God to know that your
[39:39] purpose Lord is that our lives would be
[39:42] change Lord and continually Lord to
[39:45] being transformed and changed Lord God
[39:48] into your image Lord I pray that God
[39:50] that you'll just Lord move Lord upon our
[39:53] lives and our hearts this morning for
[39:55] Lord we know that it's impossible for us
[39:57] to leave out of here the same way we
[39:59] come in the Lord we either leave closer
[40:01] to you or relief farther away but God
[40:04] we're purposed in our hearts Lord
[40:06] because Lord God
[40:08] it's your purpose Lord that we would be
[40:10] drawn closer to you Lord so help us Lord
[40:13] to receive of that word lay ourselves
[40:15] Lord upon the altar Lord and O God that
[40:19] you would move in a special way Lord and
[40:22] father Lord from our lives that there
[40:24] would come forth fruit Lord that you are
[40:26] calling for and desiring Lord and that
[40:29] your life Lord is present to enter
[40:31] John's Lord to release that for father
[40:35] we just give ourselves to you now Lord
[40:37] and what a Lord we're looking to you
[40:40] Lord for all things in the name of the
[40:42] Lord Jesus Christ amen
[40:44] may God bless you as you're being seated
[40:46] this morning I want to continue reading
[40:48] there I also want to make mention to you
[40:51] which I think probably brother bill
[40:53] already shared with you is that we have
[40:55] the fellowship dinner here right after
[40:57] the service
[40:58] Morse's people and if you need to know
[41:01] the directions or the address you can
[41:03] see one of the brothers one of the
[41:05] Deacons we certainly would love to be
[41:07] able to have each and every one of you
[41:09] and get a time just to sit down and
[41:11] fellowship you know sometimes there are
[41:13] the days and times around us it is it
[41:17] gets very busy and it's sometimes it is
[41:19] uh a rare thing for us to be able to all
[41:22] sit down and be able to be together you
[41:24] know in a time like that and I think
[41:26] it's a wonderful thing that God would
[41:28] provide for us that were would be able
[41:30] to do that
[41:31] amen so whatever time that would you
[41:33] would have I believe it would be not
[41:35] only a blessing to us but also to you as
[41:38] well so let's look here in the scripture
[41:41] in I want to continue reading here in
[41:44] verse 19 for it pleased the father that
[41:47] in him should all fullness dwell and
[41:50] having made peace through the blood of
[41:53] his cross by him to reconcile all things
[41:56] unto himself by him I say whether they
[41:59] be things in earth or things in heaven
[42:03] so the death on the cross not only the
[42:07] blood and as he descended there into
[42:11] hell it not only took care of what was
[42:13] before him but it took care of all that
[42:18] was in the past
[42:19] and it took care of all of those who had
[42:22] been waiting under the revelation that
[42:26] God had given to them of the Lamb and
[42:28] they were walking by the lamb in that
[42:30] hour that word when it came to
[42:32] fulfillment in that time they were tied
[42:34] to that word although they hadn't lived
[42:37] in the fullness of it but they were tied
[42:40] to it in the part that had been made
[42:42] known to him so when the fullness itself
[42:45] had
[42:46] come on display then it was time for all
[42:49] of those parts to come together and
[42:51] assembly in Redemption and I believe
[42:54] we're living in that hour right now amen
[42:56] when all parts are being assembled unto
[42:59] himself I believe this with all my heart
[43:02] that the opening of this word that when
[43:04] the very the Spirit of God that when we
[43:07] read there in Revelations 10 when that
[43:09] mighty angel descended him and he opened
[43:13] and his mouth and he roared as a lion
[43:16] roar it's a it's a time of authority and
[43:19] to see that that friends I believe that
[43:22] it's something that went beyond just in
[43:24] these realms I believe it's more than
[43:27] just when we look at it and we we're
[43:29] able to thank God to have it there to
[43:31] listen to the message on tape and to
[43:33] read it but let me tell you that the
[43:35] real sounding of the word it is a
[43:37] supernatural sounding it goes forth and
[43:40] it begins together just like it did for
[43:43] those animals that in the time of Noah
[43:45] no one ever had to go and round him up
[43:47] but the word supernaturally begin to
[43:49] call him into position and in that same
[43:52] God even where the Prophet could make a
[43:53] declaration when he would say that the
[43:56] sounding of the trumpets and he was
[43:58] prepared to preach that message on the
[44:00] trumpets but he just couldn't find
[44:02] unease about it but the Spirit of God
[44:04] made it known to him
[44:06] they've already been preached
[44:07] supernaturally and to find that how that
[44:09] that word that was laying there benetiz
[44:12] was ordained for Israel and this time
[44:14] for Israel to be gathered back home that
[44:17] word begin to emit and sound within this
[44:20] time in this hour there's so many things
[44:22] that are taking place all at once but to
[44:25] see how that it's supernaturally that
[44:27] beyond that of just the natural hearing
[44:30] there is a voice that's going out and
[44:32] the Spirit of God is calling to his
[44:34] children and bringing us right into
[44:37] position right in life the only thing
[44:39] that we have to do is yield to that
[44:41] voice
[44:43] my mom who oughta be to God that's
[44:46] breaking over a little bit on midweek
[44:47] but it's such a wonderful thing to see
[44:49] this that it's him who is in control of
[44:52] all these other things you you realize
[44:54] dreams that this world is moved by voice
[44:56] this world is moved by by a spirit
[44:59] that's behind it and and you see that
[45:01] even in this hour it's a blessing it's a
[45:03] blessing reality that if you can look in
[45:06] your life and you feel that pull in your
[45:08] life of the Spirit of God and you can
[45:10] find the Spirit of God moving you and
[45:12] you're in this hour it's a blessed
[45:14] reality that you can recognize your day
[45:17] and your message and to recognize that
[45:19] the message that the Lord God had
[45:22] delivered to us in this hour
[45:23] amen it is a message truly that brings
[45:27] you and I into Liberty and with not only
[45:30] glory right now but to look to that
[45:33] glory that is to be hallelujah this is
[45:39] not this is not just the all of it but
[45:42] we know that there is to come a full
[45:45] deliverance of moving from this life
[45:47] into that life glory be to God my man
[45:56] notice in verse 21 he says and you I
[46:00] just may stop here with reading and move
[46:02] on into the message a little bit more
[46:04] and you that were sometime alienated and
[46:09] enemies in your mind by wicked works yet
[46:13] now hath he reconciled so at one time
[46:18] within our lives there by that mind that
[46:24] nature that was within us that nature
[46:27] that first birth was alienating us from
[46:31] who we really were it was alienating us
[46:36] from God but only he and he alone could
[46:41] come only he could reconcile bring into
[46:45] harmony that which was there all the
[46:49] time
[46:53] Paul goes on and you know Paul's letting
[46:57] it be known of the position that God has
[47:00] as has called him to and how that God's
[47:04] desire in verse 22 that in the body of
[47:07] his flesh the Lord Jesus through death
[47:10] to present you holy and unblameable and
[47:13] run reproval
[47:14] in his sight Paul continues about that
[47:19] full reckons reconciliation in that
[47:21] expectation of the gospel that
[47:23] translation and Paul would go on to
[47:26] speak of how that the the Ministry of
[47:30] reconciliation in another place was
[47:32] committed unto Him and Paul would speak
[47:35] that how that his is was was given to
[47:38] him by God and verse 25 this
[47:40] dispensation of God which is given to me
[47:43] for you to fulfill the word of God even
[47:46] the mystery which have been hid from
[47:48] ages and from generations but now is
[47:51] made manifest to his Saints that mystery
[47:56] of God's own life which is your true
[48:00] life is our true life this mystery of
[48:04] God the mystery of God itself is God's
[48:08] own life it is not a certain mystery
[48:11] it's the mystery of Christ himself
[48:14] moving into the believer that's the true
[48:17] mystery of God is the real true baptism
[48:20] of the Holy Ghost that's why that the
[48:22] Prophet could say in the adoption series
[48:24] there is not a theology on seminary that
[48:28] can handle nor hold nor disclose the
[48:31] mystery of God but the mystery of God is
[48:33] disclosed by Christ himself
[48:36] he has messengers he has servants but
[48:39] it's him that is disclosing the mystery
[48:42] of God and it's the mystery of God that
[48:44] sweeps upon the heart of the elect and
[48:47] draws us back into that position that
[48:50] God has given us before the foundation
[48:54] of the world
[48:57] this is the true riches you could be as
[49:00] poor as jobs Turkey this morning you
[49:04] could be poor but with Christ in you
[49:07] you're rich this is the true riches it's
[49:13] the REE greatest riches because you have
[49:15] received that which is greater than the
[49:19] even silver or gold that pass away but
[49:22] the blood of Jesus Christ that happened
[49:24] shared that opening of that blood cell
[49:26] has released alive that has come back to
[49:29] you and released you and there's true
[49:31] riches in your life you're living by
[49:35] riches you know you have to have
[49:37] substance to live by is that right so
[49:40] here this rich is this life this is true
[49:43] riches my how country that is with what
[49:48] the world presents even from you see
[49:50] from the very beginning of how the Satan
[49:53] approached Eve everything was trying to
[49:55] a cause and draw her in to operate by
[49:59] her own senses and what you can see and
[50:02] feel and taste let me say this as a
[50:04] believer all of these things around us
[50:06] sometimes they seem so real it seems
[50:09] such a reality but in the midst of it
[50:12] all
[50:12] like Jonah by the grace of God were able
[50:16] to look at those things by his word and
[50:18] say I don't care how much things that he
[50:20] would try to speak truth it's all lying
[50:23] Vanity's Jonah wasn't this wasn't mind
[50:27] over matter when Jonah lived in that
[50:29] realm he had to pick seaweed out of his
[50:32] face he had to you know wipe off his
[50:34] face from whale bile and he stood there
[50:37] because how could he stand there and say
[50:39] it's all line vanities because there was
[50:43] a promise by God's Word and Jonah knew
[50:46] he was standing there by a divine
[50:49] appointment and you are not standing
[50:51] here this morning by coincidence it is a
[50:54] divine of
[50:56] [Applause]
[50:57] things can arise all sorts of things but
[51:00] yet in the midst of it be thou not just
[51:03] me neither be thou afraid but be of a
[51:06] good courage hallelujah a true riches
[51:11] that we have received in this hour and
[51:14] to see that where it leads us to what an
[51:19] expectation we have as believers you
[51:26] understand sometimes expectations help
[51:28] you to get through things sometimes
[51:33] there's things that you can have maybe
[51:35] before I'm and you have a great taxing
[51:39] time ahead of you but maybe you have
[51:41] something planned as a family and and
[51:42] this is coming up or you know if I can
[51:44] hear at the end of the week mine and you
[51:46] know you go through all this and you
[51:47] know you're going to be doing this as a
[51:48] family or or this you know or you've got
[51:50] maybe for some of us just as simple as
[51:52] there's a certain dinner planned on a
[51:54] certain night of the week you know what
[51:56] I mean the certain two way you like the
[51:57] fish fixed or whatever morning huh I
[51:59] can't wait for this and you know some
[52:01] things is just so simple with my point
[52:03] is within it friends is that even within
[52:06] that realm expectations something to
[52:08] look forward to it keeps you moving
[52:11] through all everything else that's here
[52:13] how much greater for us as believers
[52:17] that through the midst of everything
[52:19] that is here there is a great
[52:22] expectation that has entered into our
[52:25] heart that we shall be changed
[52:28] I believe I'm one of them and I believe
[52:31] I'm looking at people this morning that
[52:33] are not going to experience death I
[52:35] believe that we're living in that hour
[52:38] the Word of God declares that in this
[52:41] hour that we're living in a menace a
[52:44] promise of a of an assurance that has
[52:46] come to us but Christ Himself making
[52:49] that known to us it gives us strength to
[52:51] face the things of the day because we
[52:55] have an expectation that this world is
[52:58] not my home I'm just passing through
[53:03] the Prophet and he lays it like this and
[53:06] I want to just just really move into
[53:08] this and my thought this morning I want
[53:10] to continue to pick that up on reunited
[53:13] with another nature and I want to deal
[53:15] with that but I want to work with with
[53:18] two words and those words are delivered
[53:21] and translated when we look at this I
[53:26] want to first of all just kind of laying
[53:28] back in a purpose there's a purpose for
[53:31] everything that God does there's a
[53:34] purpose
[53:35] God does not does not operate without a
[53:39] clear true purpose which is a motive an
[53:44] objective there's that which which which
[53:47] moves God so to think that here within
[53:51] this his coming to the earth the Prophet
[53:55] would say in 1958 and I just want to
[53:58] read a few places to you I trust you'll
[53:59] bear with me
[54:00] he says the scientific world stands
[54:03] speechless on it no one can come he said
[54:05] except my father draws him first Jesus
[54:08] didn't die to save the entire world he
[54:11] wanted to but he died to save those who
[54:14] God by foreknowledge knew would be saved
[54:17] not all men will come to him remember
[54:23] the scripture says in the book of Peter
[54:25] God is not willing that willing is not
[54:29] the same as his will that's willing his
[54:31] he doesn't want no one to perish and if
[54:35] his life is within us that's the same
[54:38] desire we have so this is where in the
[54:45] men in the message Lamb's Book of Life
[54:47] the Prophet says Jesus was slain or he
[54:52] says the Bible said that Jesus here was
[54:55] was slain before the foundation world
[54:58] was ever laid he said oh and he goes let
[55:00] me go on he says what he said Jesus was
[55:02] slain before the world even had the
[55:05] first speck of Bertling now you know
[55:06] that scripture revelation 13:8 the lamb
[55:09] was slain before the foundation of the
[55:12] world when you go to see
[55:15] see a play you're not going to see
[55:18] someone then all of a sudden is handed
[55:20] lines and you have to start at Libby
[55:24] I've been in them kind of situations I'm
[55:27] not a object beyond I'm not a good actor
[55:29] how was it I'm not a good actor at all
[55:31] you know but when you're in those kind
[55:34] of situations you know they put you in
[55:35] roleplay here real quick and somehow you
[55:37] got to be able to enter in you know try
[55:39] to capture whoever this is that you're
[55:41] stepping into their shoes you got to try
[55:44] to be you know somebody else to step
[55:45] into their shoes that is not what the
[55:48] drama and the plan of God is it was
[55:53] already laid out in the mind of God and
[55:56] everyone has their part within this play
[56:00] there is no trying out for roles there
[56:05] is no well you know it's open casting
[56:08] who wants the lead role that lead role
[56:10] has already been established a man in
[56:16] each junction of time when the curtain
[56:18] would close and one would begin to
[56:20] declare this is what you're about to see
[56:22] God already had them set apart that they
[56:25] would declare when the curtain opens
[56:27] this is what you see which is now
[56:29] prophecy what will now be made manifest
[56:32] before you a man they themselves are the
[56:36] seven stars in the right hand of God
[56:38] amen so here the whole plan has been
[56:42] laid out it's it's simply God in an hour
[56:45] he is declaring to the children of God
[56:48] that have lived down through time this
[56:50] is your role this is your part and the
[56:52] actual abilities that are needed to
[56:56] fulfill that role the individuals lack
[56:58] entirely and God himself has seen it fit
[57:03] that way then it would not be according
[57:05] to our own abilities but God calls those
[57:09] who have no abilities upon their own and
[57:12] I'm talking about an ability to fulfill
[57:14] his word but God does that that he might
[57:18] receive the glory through our life
[57:22] I'm grateful for that because you look
[57:24] even in that you take meals such as
[57:26] Apostle Paul who had great astounding
[57:30] abilities but God will use Paul and and
[57:33] let Paul be set forth for our example
[57:36] too even when we would have abilities
[57:38] it's to submit all those things to God
[57:40] and say Lord without you I am nothing
[57:44] [Applause]
[57:45] the Lord Jesus had all knowledge friends
[57:48] all he had knowledge he had knowledge of
[57:50] the written word but you know it took
[57:52] the Spirit of God to quicken that word
[57:54] to him and to make it a lot even to be
[57:57] able to express what needed to be
[57:59] expressed at the right time and what
[58:02] needed to be expressed through
[58:04] manifestation at the right time all of
[58:06] those things who are set forth by God
[58:09] himself so the only thing that that we
[58:14] have to do is say what do you understand
[58:17] what are your main movements in this and
[58:19] it's like somebody directly apply said
[58:21] no no no no you're not entering in right
[58:23] now you're not getting into it you know
[58:25] it's got to be more huh I'm glad that
[58:27] God sometimes says he need more feeling
[58:30] in your life you need more expression in
[58:33] your life it's like somebody strung over
[58:35] the door I'm so happy to see you it's so
[58:38] good to see you here today it's
[58:39] wonderful nothing no you need some more
[58:42] feeling in your life but you know what
[58:45] he's not asking us to create that
[58:47] feeling but by his presence he descends
[58:51] and brings out of us the feeling that's
[58:54] needed to fulfill that part gets him
[58:57] himself
[58:58] bringing out what's necessary and then
[59:00] he turns around and says you're an
[59:02] overcomer and it's him that brought out
[59:05] of us what needed to be come out of us
[59:09] it's all to his glory amen so here Jesus
[59:15] was slain before the foundation before
[59:17] the world even had the first speck of
[59:19] dirt laid Jesus was already slain amen
[59:24] he says you know that he said God before
[59:26] knowledge when he was the word in the
[59:29] beginning he perceived the thought and
[59:31] now it's just a thought then he spoke
[59:34] and it shall be and Jesus was slain the
[59:37] very minute God spoke the word the very
[59:43] minute is spoke the word he was already
[59:46] slain the Word of God is sure when God's
[59:54] Word has been spoken it's made sure it's
[59:58] him oh my oh my that applies us so much
[1:00:04] let me move on here
[1:00:05] he says for four thousand years later he
[1:00:09] come and paid the price that God had
[1:00:12] already done back here by his word he
[1:00:16] had to come all Devils in hell couldn't
[1:00:19] keep him from coming God had already
[1:00:21] spoken that word was laying there that
[1:00:26] word had to be fulfilled
[1:00:27] there wasn't enough Devils that could
[1:00:30] stop backward from be fulfilled because
[1:00:32] when God spoke the word
[1:00:34] it was already finished it had
[1:00:36] materialized but it was already finished
[1:00:39] and if all the Devils out of hell could
[1:00:43] not stop the groom from coming all the
[1:00:45] devil's of Hell cannot stop his bride
[1:00:49] [Applause]
[1:00:53] life of his life we are filming right
[1:00:57] form they meant that's the power of this
[1:01:00] word God is not then all of a sudden
[1:01:02] disclosing word that he has not already
[1:01:05] declared but it's this hour just like in
[1:01:08] the book of Genesis where the Prophet
[1:01:10] said many think God is repeating himself
[1:01:12] God is not repeating himself God is
[1:01:16] merely declaring what I have said it is
[1:01:20] now the hour for it to come forward and
[1:01:23] that's exactly with the word has has
[1:01:26] been spoken in this generation it is
[1:01:29] called declaring it is this time for the
[1:01:32] world to come forth and he sends his
[1:01:35] word in this hour
[1:01:37] what word that word of himself but he's
[1:01:40] already declared and you and I are a
[1:01:42] part of that word listen the devil tried
[1:01:47] the devil thought he had to remember he
[1:01:49] thought he had him enable remember how
[1:01:53] the Prophet would dramatize that he came
[1:01:56] again stable then he came against
[1:01:58] Jeremiah on and on what was it it was
[1:02:00] showing that one that would be tied in
[1:02:05] with God into that original sender that
[1:02:08] sacrifice with God that life would
[1:02:10] permeate listen friends it would be the
[1:02:12] same life that would be pulsating
[1:02:15] through you and I as the believer and
[1:02:17] Satan has always been after that life
[1:02:20] but you cannot distinguish God
[1:02:26] they might take a natural life as far as
[1:02:29] in this realm where we're living
[1:02:31] but you have not destroyed you have not
[1:02:34] taken that son and daughter away the
[1:02:37] only thing that's happened is they have
[1:02:39] went into a place after serving the
[1:02:41] purpose and they are dwelling there in
[1:02:44] the presence of God just like the Saints
[1:02:47] of old were dwelling in Paradise they
[1:02:49] were awaiting for the time glory be to
[1:02:54] God
[1:02:55] think of it he said before the
[1:02:57] foundation of the world God wrote your
[1:02:59] name in the Lamb's Book of Life by his
[1:03:02] spoken word and set Christ the sacrifice
[1:03:05] to buy to redeem the same group that he
[1:03:08] had wrote their names in the Lamb's Book
[1:03:10] of Life before the foundation of the
[1:03:12] world so you see that the purpose in the
[1:03:16] coming was to redeem a sacrifice that
[1:03:20] was needed in order to buy back in order
[1:03:23] to pay the price in order to remove that
[1:03:26] separation that was between God and men
[1:03:29] that which was hindering fellowship and
[1:03:36] bring us back into that place that God
[1:03:40] intended for us to be glory be to God
[1:03:45] and now in the message when their eyes
[1:03:48] were opened he says and now if you were
[1:03:50] in the quickening at his beginning
[1:03:53] talking about in Christ that's what he
[1:03:55] come to redeem and your name was put on
[1:03:58] the Lamb's Book of Life in his thinking
[1:04:00] at the beginning and he come to redeem
[1:04:02] all names that's in that book no more
[1:04:05] not one more just what was in there and
[1:04:08] when the last name is redeemed he takes
[1:04:10] his book and claims what he has redeemed
[1:04:14] he's only they're still seating a synod
[1:04:18] upon the mediatorial work because he's
[1:04:20] waiting for that last name to be
[1:04:23] splashed in the bleach they meant for
[1:04:28] that last one to come into manifestation
[1:04:31] I'll tell you how close where the
[1:04:34] Prophet was was resting within that
[1:04:36] lookout that he was so in his own heart
[1:04:39] so alarmed there in souls in prison now
[1:04:42] he's making us aware of the hour of the
[1:04:45] time that we are living in in this hour
[1:04:48] this is a time of going home
[1:04:50] I tell you let me just say it right now
[1:04:53] with expectation don't even have an
[1:04:55] expectation of coming back to church on
[1:04:58] Thursday or on Sunday and what I mean by
[1:05:01] that is is don't live your life and
[1:05:03] bypass god's visitation we're thinking
[1:05:06] I've got another chance I've got another
[1:05:08] opportunity but this is the day of
[1:05:11] salvation this is a moment but all
[1:05:14] things ought to be settled this was a to
[1:05:17] let God have his way in your life how
[1:05:22] many times the Prophet would say it in
[1:05:24] total deliverance he said look he said
[1:05:25] you're still smoking them cigarettes he
[1:05:27] said but he said if you think by any
[1:05:30] means that well I'll come back on
[1:05:32] Wednesday night I'll come back on Sunday
[1:05:34] night he said it'll linger on with you
[1:05:36] but when you get to that point of life
[1:05:39] and death where I've got to have this
[1:05:41] Lord more than anything else I need
[1:05:43] deliverance he said when you get serious
[1:05:45] with God then God will come down and
[1:05:47] meet you right there on those conditions
[1:05:55] through expectations he's coming this is
[1:05:59] his purpose of the entirety of
[1:06:01] redemption is the Lord God laying aside
[1:06:06] his splendor I trust those are not just
[1:06:08] words to us but he laid aside his
[1:06:12] splendor when the Lord Jesus walked here
[1:06:17] upon this earth there were many miracles
[1:06:19] and signs and wonders that is true but
[1:06:24] remember his coming was miss
[1:06:27] the Prophet tells us 99% missed it in
[1:06:31] mountains mist is coming why it went
[1:06:34] over their head yet they have the word
[1:06:36] in front of them they've been reading
[1:06:39] the word they've been singing the word
[1:06:41] they've been all of these things but you
[1:06:43] see it shows that it's all of those
[1:06:45] things are wonderful I think it's
[1:06:47] wonderful to read the word and give
[1:06:49] ourselves to the word but I just say it
[1:06:51] like this friends there are things that
[1:06:53] when we read or you look across you
[1:06:55] don't understand don't try to classify
[1:06:56] it just say Lord I commit it into your
[1:06:59] hands if it is something that I need and
[1:07:02] it is something that's important then
[1:07:04] you will supply all my needs and you'll
[1:07:07] give me the understanding that I need in
[1:07:10] the right time in the right season is
[1:07:13] that right we're not lacking for
[1:07:15] anything God knows just exactly what we
[1:07:17] have neither he knows just your address
[1:07:19] he knows what you have need of in your
[1:07:21] life he's laying aside his splendor my
[1:07:28] you know when you think of that of how
[1:07:30] that God chose to do it I'm glad that
[1:07:33] God came to where he came I'm glad he
[1:07:37] didn't come where it was great kingly
[1:07:39] robes on and great you know where it was
[1:07:42] you know someone that had the same
[1:07:45] theological and intellect as that of the
[1:07:48] Pharisees I'm glad it wasn't that way
[1:07:51] you look at how God would choose to do
[1:07:53] it friends I you know I'd say what
[1:07:55] brother say no this is just your thought
[1:07:56] maybe it is but I look in this hour how
[1:07:59] that God would choose to use a messenger
[1:08:02] in this hour that was not intellectual
[1:08:05] but one who would intent I only be able
[1:08:08] to stand there think about that wasn't
[1:08:10] nothing to glory in that you only had a
[1:08:12] seventh grade education but it showed
[1:08:14] this message is not the thoughts of man
[1:08:19] it is not man's thoughts it is God's
[1:08:22] thoughts of his work man has held his
[1:08:25] word down through the ages but there's a
[1:08:28] difference in having his word and
[1:08:30] knowing his thoughts his mind men have
[1:08:34] taken words and listen now by their own
[1:08:37] evil desires subverted words to try to
[1:08:40] match and complement and okay their evil
[1:08:43] desires but God releases his thought and
[1:08:46] in his thought his his own desire his
[1:08:49] own nature his own life and it doesn't
[1:08:52] cover over it lets you and I evolve into
[1:08:56] the realms that God intended for us to
[1:08:58] walk in that's God's thoughts hallelujah
[1:09:07] God's thoughts take hold on our life I
[1:09:10] always think of the Prophet there I
[1:09:12] could just imagine here you're standing
[1:09:14] in Philadelphia and why I wanna what a
[1:09:16] message to preach mighty God unveiled
[1:09:18] before us in the Philadelphia you ever
[1:09:21] think about that brother John here he is
[1:09:23] in Philadelphia where was what was
[1:09:24] Philadelphia where the great battle was
[1:09:27] wrong and he would step back with him
[1:09:30] there that great Liberty Bell and he
[1:09:33] would say oh think of the tonight the
[1:09:35] message of the hour the expressed
[1:09:38] thoughts of Jehovah what is it was the
[1:09:44] scriptures that are laid here for this
[1:09:46] hour and Christ himself has come down
[1:09:49] and rung that word with a certain sound
[1:09:52] to our eyes and of trolling you and I to
[1:09:55] himself amen
[1:09:59] his word always finds its mark always
[1:10:03] finds his children yes sir notice of how
[1:10:07] that God laid aside that great splendor
[1:10:10] God never comes to hell of a flesh but
[1:10:13] let me just move on here his objective
[1:10:16] in to redeem is not just to leave you I
[1:10:21] want you to think of this for a moment
[1:10:23] how many times out here in the natural I
[1:10:28] just I've seen a documentary here
[1:10:32] of a individual where their brother had
[1:10:37] got out of a prison and the individual
[1:10:40] had got out of prison and we're talking
[1:10:42] about it was the whole thing dealing
[1:10:43] with documentary it was they were
[1:10:46] talking just things on miracles in their
[1:10:47] lives and this kind of struck me in I'm
[1:10:50] just looking at this and as I'm looking
[1:10:53] at it what what had taken place
[1:10:54] they let this individual out of out of
[1:10:57] incarceration they had been incarcerated
[1:10:58] for many things when they let him out
[1:11:01] they just gave him a little bit of money
[1:11:03] and just turned him on the street now I
[1:11:05] know we can look at that you know you
[1:11:07] can look at that and I can look at that
[1:11:08] we can say well I mean there ought to be
[1:11:11] thankful they're free but the point of
[1:11:14] it is is that the individual not getting
[1:11:17] the help they needed they needed help
[1:11:19] mentally and then what ended up
[1:11:22] happening is the sister here their
[1:11:25] sisters and one of the sisters took this
[1:11:28] individual in her home her brother and
[1:11:30] because her brother was not balanced the
[1:11:33] right way he ended up killing her you
[1:11:36] know I didn't even you know I'm just
[1:11:38] looking at it didn't strap me to this
[1:11:39] right here of the things I've been
[1:11:40] dwelling on God does not just release
[1:11:43] you and leave you
[1:11:46] he don't just deliver you he translates
[1:11:50] you they don't just say hey you're free
[1:11:54] and then you're looking at which way do
[1:11:56] I go what direction do I do what's that
[1:11:57] gonna make next what agency do I go to
[1:12:00] how do I go to apply for this he don't
[1:12:02] just leave you like that they man he
[1:12:06] said I will not leave you comfortless
[1:12:09] I'll not leave you like a group of
[1:12:11] orphans amen the house of God is not the
[1:12:15] house of an orphanage
[1:12:17] [Applause]
[1:12:20] his we're sons and daughters are born
[1:12:23] when sons and daughters well we're the
[1:12:26] genes of his own life or brought to life
[1:12:29] with the faith of that I my heart just
[1:12:33] broke you know and here the individual
[1:12:36] of the family they're having to deal
[1:12:37] with what has taken place and be able to
[1:12:39] forgive you know their brother and
[1:12:41] forgive those other things and that had
[1:12:43] been taking place and I you know just
[1:12:45] taking overhead
[1:12:46] of God would just quicken it to me right
[1:12:48] now God does not leave us in that place
[1:12:51] [Music]
[1:12:52] let's look at this for a moment the
[1:12:55] scripture tells us here in the book of
[1:12:57] Hebrews it became him he meant Almighty
[1:13:01] God it became him for whom are all
[1:13:04] things and by whom are all things a man
[1:13:07] this is not this is not a second person
[1:13:09] and I'm just saying this Lister and some
[1:13:11] of these things I are not new to you but
[1:13:13] for all I believe it's to be rehearsed
[1:13:15] as well as for any that would be new
[1:13:17] we are not redeemed by second person it
[1:13:21] was God Himself become one of us God
[1:13:26] created a body he pitched this tint he
[1:13:30] created this body to come and step into
[1:13:33] it with the purpose of death he purposed
[1:13:38] that that's the whole purpose here the
[1:13:40] virgin birth there that blood cell could
[1:13:42] not be a blood cell that was already of
[1:13:44] a blood that was here it was a polluted
[1:13:47] blood people were still held in bondage
[1:13:51] but it became him for whom are all
[1:13:54] things and by whom are all things in
[1:13:56] bringing many sons unto glory already
[1:14:03] sons but he's come to bring them to
[1:14:06] glory and there's only one that can
[1:14:08] bring sons to glory and that's he
[1:14:10] himself he met he comes to bring not
[1:14:14] just not just release but to bring you
[1:14:16] and I to glory bring you and I into that
[1:14:19] place that he has for us into that final
[1:14:21] full reconciliation to where that the
[1:14:24] reconciling of our soul leads to the
[1:14:26] reconciling of our bodies and the
[1:14:30] reconciling of the redeemed ransom all
[1:14:32] down through the ages and bringing many
[1:14:34] sons under glory to make the captain of
[1:14:36] their salvation perfect through
[1:14:38] sufferings amen for both he that
[1:14:42] sanctifies and they who are sanctified
[1:14:43] are all of one for which calls he is not
[1:14:46] ashamed to call them brethren God came
[1:14:49] down and became my brother
[1:14:56] that's kinfolk he came down and became
[1:15:01] my brother
[1:15:04] we were always related are you with me
[1:15:08] he manifested an attribute of himself
[1:15:11] that was always there to be savior to be
[1:15:14] deliver all those things my condition
[1:15:17] your condition it brought him on the
[1:15:20] scene to manifest those attributes amen
[1:15:24] we did not become all of a sudden
[1:15:27] kinfolk we were always careful and
[1:15:29] that's why he came was to get his kin he
[1:15:34] came to get his sons and daughters now
[1:15:38] notice this verse 12 saying I will
[1:15:40] declare thy name unto my brethren in the
[1:15:42] midst of the church will I sing praise
[1:15:45] unto thee and again I will put my trust
[1:15:47] in him and again behold I and the
[1:15:50] children which God hath given me now
[1:15:53] notice as it goes on to say in verse 14
[1:15:56] for as much then as the children are
[1:15:57] partakers of flesh and blood he also
[1:15:59] himself likewise took part of the same
[1:16:01] that through death he might destroy him
[1:16:04] that had the power of death that is the
[1:16:06] devil and deliver them who through fear
[1:16:08] of death were all their lifetime subject
[1:16:11] to bondage not to think of how this and
[1:16:16] there's things let me just move on here
[1:16:18] in just focusing on this purpose of
[1:16:20] being delivered and translated because
[1:16:23] when we find that here the Lord Jesus
[1:16:25] stands in Luke chapter four and he
[1:16:29] begins to declare when the book the
[1:16:32] scroll of Isaiah is given to him you
[1:16:36] know God knew exactly the timing he knew
[1:16:40] exactly what scroll was needed to be
[1:16:42] delivered God knew what was going to
[1:16:45] take place in that moment Jesus didn't
[1:16:47] walk in and say can I have the scroll of
[1:16:49] Isaiah it was delivered unto Him God had
[1:16:54] everything that priests they might hear
[1:16:56] they were selecting of a certain scroll
[1:16:58] that morning they didn't realize it but
[1:17:00] even in that moment it was God that was
[1:17:03] Orcas
[1:17:04] reading and bringing them to that and if
[1:17:09] we can have that realization friends
[1:17:11] that these things are not happening by
[1:17:14] chance didn't let us have grace to
[1:17:16] receive those things and say Lord you
[1:17:20] who are ordering all things let me
[1:17:22] receive and recognize and be moved but
[1:17:25] what you are doing right now Lord I
[1:17:28] don't want to be deaf to it I don't want
[1:17:31] to be ignorant to it I don't want to be
[1:17:33] complacent about it I want to move
[1:17:35] within it this rook was delivered unto
[1:17:40] him and he he opened the book but he did
[1:17:44] more than just open the pages they had
[1:17:48] opened the book many times but this
[1:17:51] opening was a different opening he took
[1:17:54] the same scroll they had read from but
[1:17:56] that scroll become all together a new
[1:17:59] scroll it was in his hands when that
[1:18:03] scroll became middle how did it become
[1:18:05] new because what was prophesied and that
[1:18:09] which had been written declared from the
[1:18:11] mind of God here God who's reflecting
[1:18:14] his mind down through earth it was God
[1:18:17] Himself standing there in a corporal
[1:18:19] body and declaring in this hour this
[1:18:22] scripture is fulfilled in this hour Amen
[1:18:28] what authority to point in this hour and
[1:18:31] say this scripture is being fulfilled he
[1:18:37] could say the Spirit of the Lord is upon
[1:18:39] me
[1:18:42] here's the purpose remember the purpose
[1:18:44] of his coming the Spirit of the Lord in
[1:18:46] verse 18 is upon me because he hath
[1:18:49] anointed me he hath anointed me fourth
[1:18:54] purpose lucky anointed Aaron lucky
[1:18:56] anointed his sons they are anointed for
[1:18:58] a purpose there's not anointing just to
[1:19:01] come and do whatever they're anointed to
[1:19:03] serve you and I have been anointed to
[1:19:06] serve the Living God amen we've been
[1:19:08] called chosen set apart and anointed by
[1:19:11] the Holy Ghost to serve the purpose of
[1:19:14] God in this hour
[1:19:15] hey man glory be to God he said he hath
[1:19:20] anointed me to preach the gospel to the
[1:19:23] poor he has sent me to heal the
[1:19:26] brokenhearted hallelujah to preach
[1:19:30] deliverance to the captives this is
[1:19:36] greater than any natural national force
[1:19:40] amen this is the lord of glory sounding
[1:19:44] forth here he is and recovering of sight
[1:19:47] to the blind to set at liberty them that
[1:19:50] are bruised this is what the Spirit of
[1:19:55] the Lord moving and bring in an
[1:19:57] anointing listen friends it doesn't an
[1:20:00] reconcile a person to a church it
[1:20:02] reconciles us unto Jesus Christ her ulis
[1:20:07] me that's where the declaration of a
[1:20:10] true Messenger of God he could stand
[1:20:12] there and say there's one desire that I
[1:20:14] have and that's to see a true
[1:20:16] relationship between Jesus Christ and
[1:20:19] his people that was the thrust that's
[1:20:21] the desire and that's the same burden is
[1:20:24] that same relationship would so permeate
[1:20:27] and hold in our lives what you thankful
[1:20:33] to God for that I'm telling your friends
[1:20:35] I'm thankful to God for that it's time
[1:20:37] and I hear the message when I'm reading
[1:20:39] the word I said take your God that
[1:20:41] you're sent a word in this hour that was
[1:20:43] free from denominational influence now
[1:20:47] let me tell you something even thoughts
[1:20:49] where you go back and you can study
[1:20:51] things on the message where the Prophet
[1:20:53] said I used to think oh my that is a
[1:20:55] wonderful phrase I used to think there
[1:20:58] are a lot of those in your lives I used
[1:21:00] to think I used to believe I used to
[1:21:03] feel what was it it was the power of
[1:21:05] Revelation appointed to this hour and it
[1:21:08] breaks all that darkness and that
[1:21:10] denominationalism why because it's a
[1:21:13] cloud of darkness and gloom it is not
[1:21:16] the true light you know how the Prophet
[1:21:22] could say I would have made a mistake
[1:21:25] but he came in the room that same pillar
[1:21:29] of fire that same pair of eyes and know
[1:21:33] this is a time for deliverance the
[1:21:37] understanding back then was fitted for
[1:21:40] that time but now here's an
[1:21:43] understanding there must come in this
[1:21:44] hour a sounding that brings liberty you
[1:21:49] love him
[1:21:51] hallelujah oh my think of what took
[1:21:54] place here at the River Jordan the
[1:21:57] Prophet said heavens and earth have met
[1:21:59] God and man is reconciled I restored
[1:22:04] Eden has begun and all the curses gone
[1:22:06] that's the greatest thing I was there
[1:22:08] look the Prophet tells us that's the
[1:22:10] greatest event is that right but at the
[1:22:14] opening of the seals he said this taking
[1:22:16] the book is the most sublime act the
[1:22:18] greatest act leads to the most sublime
[1:22:21] it must first be a reconciling there
[1:22:24] that leads to a full reconciling and
[1:22:26] calling of all those that are redeemed
[1:22:29] unto himself it's God making a way for
[1:22:32] himself to come forth
[1:22:36] well I says just like all the curse of
[1:22:39] sin is gone when the Holy Ghost accepts
[1:22:43] you so you don't accept it it accepts
[1:22:45] you see cause it's God's attribute in
[1:22:50] that beautiful you say well brother
[1:22:53] Samuel didn't know I I thought I
[1:22:54] accepted it it's him that accepted you
[1:22:57] but remember he comes and he deals with
[1:23:00] our hearts and our lives because even in
[1:23:03] our own spirit we couldn't get along
[1:23:05] with ourselves much less get along with
[1:23:11] God but God never said you got to get a
[1:23:14] new heart a new spirit on your own he
[1:23:15] said I'll give you
[1:23:17] what I gotta do just surrender to him
[1:23:21] I'll give you a new heart I'll give you
[1:23:23] a new spirit and then I put my spirit in
[1:23:26] you and calls you to walk in my statutes
[1:23:28] so it's him receiving us receiving us
[1:23:33] back to what he already knew and that is
[1:23:40] breaking upon our lives listen that's
[1:23:42] why when Paul look how Paul would pray
[1:23:44] in the first part of Ephesians in the
[1:23:47] first part of Ephesians 3 Paul would
[1:23:48] pray this way in the book of
[1:23:50] Thessalonians and in the chapter 1 Paul
[1:23:52] would pray this way in the first part of
[1:23:53] those chapters the Lawsons one an
[1:23:55] intercessory prayer that's prayed that
[1:23:58] the people would come to the depth of
[1:24:00] understanding of what God has done
[1:24:06] that's why the Prophet could stand there
[1:24:08] and Christ the mystery said oh he said
[1:24:10] I'm sure he said I don't understand it
[1:24:13] the way I need to understand it but you
[1:24:15] know what God makes it known in his time
[1:24:19] my question is do you have a desire is a
[1:24:23] hungry is a desire to know more more who
[1:24:28] more of him more of him a man oh my you
[1:24:34] see this this word it comes it removes
[1:24:36] you and I from just knowing knowing this
[1:24:40] is the truth it reveals the truth in us
[1:24:46] glory be to God see if the Holy Ghost
[1:24:50] means God's Spirit is the attribute the
[1:24:52] thought of God has accepted you because
[1:24:54] you are deigned for that purpose yet you
[1:24:57] was born in sin but God had that
[1:25:00] attribute and here you expressed
[1:25:01] yourself on earth and he comes down and
[1:25:04] get you he comes down and gets you so
[1:25:12] the purpose of his coming is to come
[1:25:15] down and get us see you're back here
[1:25:21] here is where you belong see sin has
[1:25:25] lost its power the desire of sin has
[1:25:28] gone from your heart when the Holies
[1:25:31] parrot comes in let's say no I still
[1:25:36] fall short but that the wind bring the
[1:25:38] Holy Ghost has come in the desire of sin
[1:25:43] is gone from your life you see that's
[1:25:48] where the Prophet could say in the
[1:25:49] message thirsty said you know what you
[1:25:51] are by the desire within your heart amen
[1:25:56] and only let only let Christ Himself
[1:25:59] interpret that to you glory be to God
[1:26:04] Alleluia that's why we want to look in
[1:26:07] the mirror of his word and then we don't
[1:26:10] we don't want the Eve's interpreter we
[1:26:14] want the Holy Spirit to interpret his
[1:26:17] word in our life is that right
[1:26:20] listen to me now the word of
[1:26:22] reconciliation God reconciles that soul
[1:26:26] unto himself and when the soul has been
[1:26:28] reconciled it will lead this body into a
[1:26:31] complete state of reconciliation Amen
[1:26:35] you're perfect from within God gives you
[1:26:38] that perfection within to do what bring
[1:26:40] that outer man in subjection and it's a
[1:26:42] declaration of his victory in your life
[1:26:45] are you with me Amen we're at one time
[1:26:48] there was no struggle in your life you
[1:26:51] walked according to the Prince of power
[1:26:53] the air but now something happened then
[1:26:56] been chained there something moved
[1:26:58] there's a repulsion against those things
[1:27:00] somebody with me now oh brother Samuel
[1:27:05] this don't bother me then there's
[1:27:06] something wrong sin everything around it
[1:27:15] bothers the unbeliever bothers the
[1:27:17] believer there's no desire within your
[1:27:20] heart for those things you don't even
[1:27:22] like to stay in a place even in a a
[1:27:24] break room where you know such things
[1:27:26] where that things could be said they may
[1:27:28] not even know that well I don't know if
[1:27:30] this could be said you don't even want
[1:27:31] to be around those things why you've
[1:27:36] been made free
[1:27:38] and that same God that has made you free
[1:27:41] is building you up from glory unto glory
[1:27:44] unto glory hallelujah glory be to God oh
[1:27:49] my you are a restored person this word
[1:27:54] restored means you are brought back
[1:27:58] I know it's simple you are you've
[1:28:01] written a return to a former conditioned
[1:28:04] place or position Amen you have been
[1:28:08] given something that was previously
[1:28:10] stolen taken away or lost it's back to
[1:28:14] the original owner let me just let me
[1:28:19] move with this here this word in
[1:28:21] Colossians 1:13 can I have just a few
[1:28:24] more moments verse 13 let me just trying
[1:28:28] to lay this in here who hath delivered
[1:28:30] us from the power of darkness and hath
[1:28:32] translated us into the kingdom of his
[1:28:36] dear son to be delivered as he had drawn
[1:28:39] us to himself he has rescued us not get
[1:28:50] a mission where there are people that
[1:28:51] are taken captive home I think of that
[1:28:54] one time where they had those you know
[1:28:55] them hostages were captured and they
[1:28:57] called them Assad in there of Israel and
[1:28:59] they went right in there I think it was
[1:29:00] Libya or whatever more I tell you they
[1:29:02] pulled right up in there and I remember
[1:29:03] Sadie's bins and everything else and
[1:29:05] they had everything and right down to
[1:29:07] the detail of those men that were in
[1:29:09] there holding those hostages captive
[1:29:11] they knew exactly they had the prints
[1:29:13] they had all this stuff when they went
[1:29:15] in there
[1:29:15] they took care of business and those who
[1:29:18] were held hostage were freed I'm gonna
[1:29:19] tell you I believe it was more than the
[1:29:21] intellect of the Mossad I believe that
[1:29:23] it was God who is with Israel it's God
[1:29:26] testified I whoever bless you be blessed
[1:29:29] whoever cursed you will be crushed that
[1:29:32] applies to you the son and daughter that
[1:29:35] applies to you you are blessed of the
[1:29:37] Lord when God has put his blessing of
[1:29:40] his spirit upon your life and raised you
[1:29:43] up there is nothing that can stand
[1:29:45] against the elect of God yes sir
[1:29:50] everything is precise and its director
[1:29:53] God himself knew exactly where to go
[1:29:55] when he came down everything was already
[1:29:58] laid out he went straight to the head of
[1:30:00] the serpent men had men all laid out and
[1:30:05] he came to liberate the captives to heal
[1:30:09] the brokenhearted amen to bring strength
[1:30:14] to those who were bruised you know there
[1:30:18] was a young there was a woman here in
[1:30:20] John 6 notice this ministry of the
[1:30:23] acceptable year going forth and here the
[1:30:25] Lord Jesus he meets this woman there by
[1:30:29] the well she had been coming to that
[1:30:32] well been coming to that well but this
[1:30:35] day this was gonna be a new beginning
[1:30:38] for her life she was not gonna leave
[1:30:41] from that well the same way that she
[1:30:42] came there but through the word the
[1:30:46] prophecy that had been given for that
[1:30:48] hour here stands the Messiah and it
[1:30:52] begins to speak to her notice all this
[1:30:55] cloud and gloom everything that was
[1:30:57] covering her life was not who she was if
[1:31:04] he would have tried to focus on
[1:31:06] repairing that she too walked away from
[1:31:08] there the same way are you with me it's
[1:31:12] not listen friends there are serious
[1:31:14] needs but the gospel has come to bring
[1:31:18] what is needed and when God God is alone
[1:31:22] himself is the one who brings the
[1:31:24] healing work it's not Reformation or
[1:31:27] reforming but he brought by the word by
[1:31:31] the word he stirs her to a place to
[1:31:34] where she begins to ask him about
[1:31:38] worship that was God's desire he was
[1:31:43] seeking for true worshipers to worship
[1:31:48] Him in spirit Ruth she being an election
[1:31:51] of God when the Spirit of God moving
[1:31:53] across God's desire becomes reflected in
[1:31:57] her request she's requesting what God
[1:32:01] wants to bring forth in her
[1:32:03] I see leaves they're delivered and
[1:32:10] translated she's been moved from one
[1:32:14] kind of a life to another when God came
[1:32:21] down to Egypt he came down into Egypt
[1:32:24] there with a message when he met Moses
[1:32:27] there and revealed himself in the
[1:32:29] promise of his word what did God say he
[1:32:31] said I am come down to deliver them
[1:32:34] right now come I'm gonna send you I've
[1:32:36] come to deliver them and bring them up
[1:32:39] unto a good land see the word had
[1:32:42] already been spoken it's a good land
[1:32:44] there should have been no question about
[1:32:46] the land are you with me
[1:32:49] but God allows the here go up and see
[1:32:52] the land but the land has already been
[1:32:54] declared God has said it's a good land
[1:32:59] hey man what God has said has spoken it
[1:33:03] is sure it is true but you see there
[1:33:08] were many who had been delivered out but
[1:33:11] they never got translated come on
[1:33:16] somebody they came out and they walked
[1:33:19] in the wilderness but then it came to a
[1:33:21] spot they did not recognize that this
[1:33:24] message was not Moses message he was an
[1:33:28] instrument but this was the Lord God
[1:33:31] revealing himself by his promise and the
[1:33:35] same God who made this promise real and
[1:33:38] alive as a same God who would put them
[1:33:40] in that place you know what that was
[1:33:43] that was their inheritance by then
[1:33:45] walking away they declared we have no
[1:33:47] inheritance here there's got to be
[1:33:50] something that registers within a heart
[1:33:53] of a believer and you recognize it just
[1:33:55] like what God is troweling a person and
[1:33:58] to himself he's drowning them to
[1:34:00] recognize there's something that's
[1:34:02] lacking in their life they might have
[1:34:03] been a church member for year after year
[1:34:06] after year but there's something that's
[1:34:08] missing in their life and they need a
[1:34:10] real experience with Almighty God and
[1:34:13] what is it that's something that gives
[1:34:15] them that
[1:34:16] but I know that I have there a place a
[1:34:19] body that is waiting on me I'm not
[1:34:26] talking about all the lives that Satan
[1:34:28] wants to tell you I'm not talking about
[1:34:30] all the things when he wants to tell you
[1:34:32] well it's not for you it's for everybody
[1:34:34] else he's a liar
[1:34:36] you need to stand on that word there can
[1:34:39] you say stand on what word stand on the
[1:34:41] word that has been made real and flesh
[1:34:44] in your life Amen that you know right
[1:34:48] now you're not walking by mommy and
[1:34:50] daddy's understanding but you haven't
[1:34:53] understanding that has come from God
[1:34:55] that this message is a living reality of
[1:34:59] the Lord God that had made himself known
[1:35:01] to me it's not something that's come
[1:35:05] from a pastor but it's God himself they
[1:35:12] didn't recognize that but there were
[1:35:16] those who were delivered and translated
[1:35:22] they had to wait a little bit on their
[1:35:25] translation but they had the promise
[1:35:27] it's coming how you know it's coming
[1:35:31] I've been delivered
[1:35:33] I've been delivered I'm gonna be
[1:35:36] translated there Robert I've been set
[1:35:40] free I know I'm gonna be translated hey
[1:35:42] man I know I've been resurrected I'm
[1:35:44] gonna be raptured is that right Jesus
[1:35:48] was resurrected and he ruptured his own
[1:35:52] body
[1:35:53] whoo what is it a type of his pride in
[1:35:58] this our resurrection power raising the
[1:36:04] bridle and the rapture its health from a
[1:36:06] resurrection in yourself to the rapture
[1:36:09] and change of the body hallelujah
[1:36:15] so that coming on the messiah and
[1:36:17] redeemer was to deliver and translate
[1:36:22] the people is coming from the natural
[1:36:26] land into the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:29] and from there here we stand in this
[1:36:33] hour to translate us to take us out of
[1:36:37] denominationalism to translate us from
[1:36:39] this spiritual land into that land what
[1:36:42] land in my father's house are many
[1:36:44] mansions that same killer fire has
[1:36:48] returned once again the first Exodus
[1:36:52] that pillar of fire was here the second
[1:36:54] Exodus the pillar fire was here and the
[1:36:55] pillar fire had been gone from the
[1:36:57] church but now it returns great
[1:37:01] signification in this hour listen to me
[1:37:04] he appeared through many lights and many
[1:37:06] dreams down through the church ages are
[1:37:08] you with me he appeared to Abraham in
[1:37:10] lights and dreams and visions and things
[1:37:12] but in the end time the pillar fire
[1:37:16] comes on the scene once again but it's
[1:37:18] time to be led out of this old world out
[1:37:22] of this old past house aren't you glad
[1:37:27] he just doesn't deliver you and leave
[1:37:29] you
[1:37:31] and that right but here even in the
[1:37:34] departing than one of the departing
[1:37:36] messages God be with you till we meet
[1:37:39] again
[1:37:40] leadership leadership has come is that
[1:37:45] right the leadership of the person of
[1:37:48] eternal life himself Jesus Christ
[1:37:50] Oh glory be to God my delivered and
[1:37:54] translated here think of this here how
[1:37:57] that you have those within the hour
[1:38:00] like you take Ruth Ruth was delivered
[1:38:04] and she was translated she were
[1:38:08] delivered from from that nation that she
[1:38:12] walked in her first husband he died she
[1:38:17] comes into the land with Naomi but then
[1:38:21] she can never be translated without boys
[1:38:25] but Boaz the Lord of the harvest comes
[1:38:29] on the scene and the chief Reaper notice
[1:38:33] Boaz doesn't go to anybody else but the
[1:38:35] chief Reaper you don't just go around
[1:38:39] and ask him all the others who is this
[1:38:42] he comes to the chief Reaper who is she
[1:38:44] the chief Reaper knows who she is the
[1:38:48] chief of chief Reaper says this is Ruth
[1:38:50] what's he doing he's presenting Ruth to
[1:38:54] him longer it be to God Alleluia and
[1:39:00] Ruth is translated oh my
[1:39:03] she was already always she was ordained
[1:39:07] there in the economy when you read
[1:39:09] Matthew chapter 1 when the Bible says
[1:39:11] the generation of Jesus Christ not
[1:39:14] generations the generation of Jesus
[1:39:18] Christ
[1:39:20] she's translated not all of a sudden
[1:39:23] inserted she was always there in that
[1:39:28] whole lineage the whole time but now
[1:39:32] she's been translated to where what is
[1:39:35] laid within her can now begin to express
[1:39:39] itself
[1:39:40] it's positioning Rahab she was delivered
[1:39:50] she received a word of impending
[1:39:55] judgment there right there are
[1:39:58] messengers who win and they were packing
[1:40:00] the message of Joshua is there right
[1:40:02] they were packing a message that held
[1:40:05] within it the inheritance they're
[1:40:07] packing a message that helped within it
[1:40:09] power authority to place and here she is
[1:40:16] an alien she's without the economy of
[1:40:20] Israel she absolutely has not one
[1:40:25] promise that she could lay hold upon in
[1:40:29] that land but little did she know that
[1:40:35] she also is a part of the economy of God
[1:40:40] and God sees to it that his word of
[1:40:46] deliverance comes to her heart and she
[1:40:49] receives that word and applies it listen
[1:40:53] friends it's not how much you know just
[1:40:55] apply what God had showed you apply what
[1:41:00] he showed you be faithful in that and
[1:41:02] watch as you apply that word God will
[1:41:04] bring you along amen and here when all
[1:41:09] of the walls came down here she meets
[1:41:12] and marries salmone he's not just
[1:41:16] delivered she's now transferred she's
[1:41:21] come what from one place into another at
[1:41:24] one place she was an outcast but by a
[1:41:29] word that came to make her ready a word
[1:41:33] that came to make her ready she received
[1:41:36] that word and that word made her ready
[1:41:38] he delivered her so she could be
[1:41:41] translated glory be to God the desire
[1:41:46] from being delivered to being translated
[1:41:48] Sarah was delivered and translated also
[1:41:52] now right
[1:41:53] I'm done let's tan once again I don't
[1:41:58] get to the place we want but God knows I
[1:42:01] want to get to where he wants is that
[1:42:04] right that's where I want to get to
[1:42:06] where he wants I trust that this morning
[1:42:09] we can see you can see more of yourself
[1:42:16] see you and me all we know is our first
[1:42:20] birth as far as we have all this
[1:42:23] recollection and you see everything but
[1:42:26] God God makes way and makes known to you
[1:42:28] that your new birth it was not
[1:42:31] coincidence it was not accident it was
[1:42:34] not something that anybody cultured in
[1:42:36] to you or schooled into you it was
[1:42:38] predestinated into you by the hand of
[1:42:40] God God came and sought you out he
[1:42:45] delivered you he broke the power of
[1:42:47] darkness from around your life and
[1:42:49] translated you into the kingdom of his
[1:42:52] dear son and as being and dwelling in
[1:42:55] the kingdom of his dear son you are a
[1:42:57] ruler you understand that you're a ruler
[1:43:01] we are made kings and priests unto our
[1:43:03] God by the blood of Jesus Christ yes sir
[1:43:07] you and I are called not only to offer
[1:43:10] worship unto the Lord as priests unto
[1:43:13] God priests are what set aside for
[1:43:15] service right to offer unto God but
[1:43:18] we're also Kings as well earthly man
[1:43:22] tried to mix that office you can't mix
[1:43:24] it or an under earthly strength it must
[1:43:26] be a divine strength right Uriah being a
[1:43:30] king tried to intrude into a priests
[1:43:32] office can't do it it must stay in his
[1:43:35] position but you and I here we are by
[1:43:37] the grace of God through and by the
[1:43:39] Prince of the kings of the earth we're
[1:43:41] not intruding into something we are
[1:43:43] thorned into this kingdom we are born
[1:43:46] kings and priests not what we made
[1:43:48] ourselves it's not something that we all
[1:43:50] of a sudden I want to be this it's God
[1:43:52] opening and bringing us into that place
[1:43:54] that he always had for us and that
[1:43:57] kingship is a ruling over sin flesh the
[1:44:01] devil the world
[1:44:04] it's a reality it's a truth you see
[1:44:09] Sarah in her life here look how the word
[1:44:13] came to Sarah God's dealing with Abraham
[1:44:16] he's dealing with Abraham's life but
[1:44:18] then Sarah Sarah herself had to be
[1:44:20] delivered and when she was delivered
[1:44:25] she came remember here the word comes
[1:44:28] and the word always exposes our humanity
[1:44:32] our weakness is that right that's what I
[1:44:36] want the word to do I don't want the
[1:44:38] word to tell me how strong I am because
[1:44:40] that that's not true I want the word to
[1:44:42] show me where my weak places are so that
[1:44:47] those weak places can be submitted to
[1:44:49] him so that he might become strong in
[1:44:51] him you say well but if you're weakened
[1:44:53] and wouldn't be natural God would be
[1:44:54] strong in it no not if pride tries to
[1:44:55] cover him but see when pride gets
[1:44:59] removed and recognized he's here to help
[1:45:01] us then we can submit those weaknesses
[1:45:02] that he might be strong those no longer
[1:45:05] something we're trying to hide and
[1:45:06] protect but we submitted unto God but
[1:45:09] here the word of the Lord comes and
[1:45:10] Sarah's she says how is this gonna be is
[1:45:14] she's still thinking on a natural
[1:45:15] earthly level but the word has come to
[1:45:18] lift her out of that realm and here she
[1:45:23] comes and we find where there is a
[1:45:27] change within Sarah not only is her name
[1:45:29] been changed I noticed Nelly has her
[1:45:30] name been changed but now what God will
[1:45:34] do is bring forth from within her that
[1:45:38] removal of what she didn't think
[1:45:44] possible God brought forth you with me
[1:45:49] think about what the Spirit of God has
[1:45:50] spoke to us even on faith my brother
[1:45:52] Jerry stood right here faith
[1:45:54] possessing the unknown are you with me
[1:45:58] this time I know I got faith faith is an
[1:46:01] unconscious thing hey there's another I
[1:46:03] know remember how many times where
[1:46:07] people are sitting there out there over
[1:46:09] and over and and God would allow those
[1:46:10] things to be recorded in tape he says
[1:46:13] you were healed just moments ago sister
[1:46:14] I said you didn't know you had that
[1:46:18] he didn't know that God knew Sara didn't
[1:46:23] know she had that much faith but God
[1:46:25] knew but what did the world do it didn't
[1:46:29] condemn her he lifted her lifted her by
[1:46:33] what by her union with the word that had
[1:46:36] come in that hour she received that
[1:46:42] faith that had come through Abraham she
[1:46:45] received it and this is where the
[1:46:47] scripture could say she judged him
[1:46:49] faithful through those Sarah past age
[1:46:53] was delivered
[1:46:57] she was normally delivered
[1:46:59] she was translated this is God's desire
[1:47:05] for us it's God's desire he don't just
[1:47:08] leave us he doesn't just deliver us and
[1:47:10] then just leave us just say well you're
[1:47:13] delivered know if the word comes to put
[1:47:16] us into position it comes to place us in
[1:47:23] him it comes to declare and live itself
[1:47:29] out through our lives when God anointed
[1:47:32] Joshua and Joshua moved by then it's
[1:47:34] that same inspiration that fell upon
[1:47:36] Jacob that had fallen upon those Hebrew
[1:47:38] mothers that had been clear back there
[1:47:40] from the foundation row they were in
[1:47:42] that same channel of divine inspiration
[1:47:45] and so there was impartation that was
[1:47:48] taking place of the inheritance that
[1:47:50] belonged to her that's why it's a car in
[1:47:54] different ones they can never take
[1:47:55] another place another person's position
[1:47:57] in the body it's by the allotment and
[1:48:01] choosing of Almighty God
[1:48:04] and it comes forth in that time in that
[1:48:07] season is that right you see that
[1:48:11] delivery that's where the Prophet would
[1:48:14] bring us into this place and he would
[1:48:16] tell us concerning even in this hour
[1:48:18] this is an hour where it's not just the
[1:48:22] chemistry but it's the time
[1:48:24] personal life of Jesus Christ Mini as he
[1:48:30] said can live he said this is an hour
[1:48:31] what a great is that a great deceiving
[1:48:33] hour many can live above drinking and
[1:48:37] smoking and adultery and all those
[1:48:38] things he said and still not with it
[1:48:40] how could they be not with it because
[1:48:42] listen by grace through faith are you
[1:48:45] saved they're safe they're free from
[1:48:49] those things but to be translated is
[1:48:51] where that this this Christ this Living
[1:48:54] God has become real to you it is the
[1:48:58] word of this hour you look for it
[1:49:03] all brother Simon what would be the
[1:49:05] evidence the Prophet stands and Feast of
[1:49:06] Trumpets he says that hearing that word
[1:49:08] listen not just hearing it and saying oh
[1:49:10] yeah I believe it yeah I agree with it
[1:49:12] but hearing where it is that which has
[1:49:14] made person you he said and that is the
[1:49:16] evidence of the Holy Ghost to do what
[1:49:20] receive it
[1:49:21] what is to receive it to make it yours
[1:49:25] this is mine this is my inheritance
[1:49:31] this is my inherit this is your
[1:49:34] inheritance all all that God is I was he
[1:49:40] poured into Christ all
[1:49:45] this is God's desire for us delivered in
[1:49:49] translating walking in a newness you can
[1:49:54] never go back to the same where place
[1:49:56] you were and one of these days we'll
[1:49:59] never come back you know what this might
[1:50:02] be the final service it might be the
[1:50:07] final service it might be the final
[1:50:11] moment all better say you're trying to
[1:50:13] scare me that shouldn't scare you
[1:50:16] we're not trying to play spooky games
[1:50:18] like around the fire something like that
[1:50:20] no no we're not talking about that I'm
[1:50:22] saying that this is an hour of
[1:50:24] preparation and God has sent for the
[1:50:27] word of preparation like he did to Rahab
[1:50:29] like he did for Ruth like he did for
[1:50:32] Sarah God prepares for himself let's bow
[1:50:38] our head anyone want to be remembered in
[1:50:42] prayer Heavenly Father Lord you you see

[1:52:35] our inheritance he would be mindful Lord
[1:52:38] to tell us by the leadership of the
[1:52:40] Spirit of God how we ought to walk your
[1:52:43] prophet Lord picks that up Lord God
[1:52:44] through the message of the adoption
[1:52:46] series and speaking God of how that we
[1:52:49] are to walk in this land in our
[1:52:50] inheritance
[1:52:51] I pray Heavenly Father that if there is
[1:52:54] one that's here Lord that doesn't know
[1:52:57] you this morning I pray that God through
[1:52:59] the word may they Lord God I pray that
[1:53:01] Lord that they have been brought to a
[1:53:03] place Lord yielding in their life been
[1:53:06] brought to a place to say yes Lord I
[1:53:08] want to be
[1:53:09] that Lord I want to be that kind of a
[1:53:11] man that kind of a woman Lord won't
[1:53:13] grant that word Lord that's a Lord that
[1:53:16] it would become a reality to me Lord I
[1:53:19] pray God that here this morning as well
[1:53:22] Lord gone throughout this congregation
[1:53:25] lord I pray that father God may our
[1:53:29] hearts Lord be so determined and so Lord
[1:53:34] determined with submission Lord that we
[1:53:40] might receive more of you Lord I want
[1:53:43] more Lord of you as the Prophet Lord
[1:53:48] said there in the message images of
[1:53:51] Christ he said oh my
[1:53:54] I said I'm I'm not interested on what
[1:53:56] plane I've got to come on I just want
[1:53:58] more of the Holy Ghost to take over more
[1:54:01] of William Branham I want more of him
[1:54:04] that I can be more of a servant more
[1:54:06] humbler more submissive more willing oh
[1:54:11] god that's my prayer Lord I pray God
[1:54:15] throughout this building Lord father we
[1:54:19] need more of you Lord in our lives we
[1:54:23] need more of you Lord God as we're
[1:54:27] looking at this drama the unfolding of
[1:54:29] it Lord and and and we're looking at it
[1:54:31] and we're seeing the word that's to be
[1:54:33] fulfilled we're minded to understand
[1:54:35] that beside that word is in parentheses
[1:54:38] Lord with that italicized print that
[1:54:41] gives the unction of how that word is to
[1:54:44] be carried out and father we sense the
[1:54:46] unction in a heart Lord that God it is
[1:54:49] not us to carry it out but Lord it is us
[1:54:52] to yield and you fulfill it Lord through
[1:54:55] us Lord as you did through the womb of
[1:54:59] the Virgin Lord it was you that
[1:55:01] fulfilled that word Lord and I pray that
[1:55:04] God may Lord in our lives lord having
[1:55:08] more Lord I want more of the Holy Ghost
[1:55:11] and not just something Lord just more I
[1:55:13] think of it God in in in like a room

[1:55:19] closet now I want more how are you gonna
[1:55:22] have anymore if you have it all filled
[1:55:24] up the Lord the reality is is that we're
[1:55:28] not it's not filled up with you but help
[1:55:30] us to empty out us because when we want
[1:55:34] more of you you you are looking where am
[1:55:35] I gonna put it but help us Lord to empty
[1:55:39] up us help us God to Lord the things
[1:55:43] that you're dealing with us on Lord and
[1:55:46] father to surrender Lord and submitting
[1:55:48] and laying down Lord and letting the
[1:55:50] word have preeminence in our lives or
[1:55:53] God dealing with us to draw us to you
[1:55:56] lord
[1:55:57] learn anything else any other baggage or
[1:56:00] anything else that's hindering Lord
[1:56:01] whether it be attitude thought feeling
[1:56:03] whatever Oh God not anything Lord or God
[1:56:07] we pray father that Lord Jesus
[1:56:10] may we Lord yield and lay and rest Lord
[1:56:14] upon the altar or god of your presence

[1:56:22] with more of you Lord I want more of you

[1:57:00] understand Lord God that is the word as
[1:57:02] you're dealing with our hearts Lord God

[1:57:07] to you Lord to come Lord and to release
[1:57:10] those things Lord we let them be removed
[1:57:13] from our life let the word come Lord the
[1:57:15] washing of water by the word oh god it's
[1:57:18] not a steel contaminated moss written
[1:57:20] water but it's a free-flowing
[1:57:24] god that washes us Lord ah that removes

[1:58:11] Jesus father we know that Lord God it
[1:58:15] will move just from this building it
[1:58:17] starts here it begins here Lord but
[1:58:21] father as we would even Lord venture
[1:58:23] from this building but not from your
[1:58:25] presence then god we would take that
[1:58:27] word those things as we would look in
[1:58:29] the mirror of the word not being Lord
[1:58:31] God just hearers only but doers Lord
[1:58:33] taking account of what we see in the
[1:58:36] mirror Lord looking in the word Lord and
[1:58:38] recognizing God that your desires we
[1:58:41] would be doers lord may we God fully
[1:58:43] submit ourselves Lord granted Lord dying
[1:58:46] more and more to ourselves Lord or
[1:58:50] granite Lord as your prophet spoke to
[1:58:52] his Lord
[1:58:52] that old cocklebur Oh Lord may we take
[1:58:56] Lord by the authority of the word laying
[1:58:59] our lives upon the altar Lord those
[1:59:01] things Lord that are thought to be
[1:59:03] impossible Lord may where the Lord God
[1:59:05] approach you with faith and say Lord I
[1:59:07] believe Lord God that I am a child of
[1:59:10] God I believe in my soul this I'm a gene
[1:59:13] of God a son and daughter of God and
[1:59:16] just as there can be strains in the
[1:59:18] natural from the natural tree I am that
[1:59:21] idea and a part of that tree of life and
[1:59:23] from that tree of life comes forth the
[1:59:27] strains of predestination
[1:59:29] I give myself to you Lord God Lord that
[1:59:34] your lies that the life of the vine
[1:59:36] would energize me Lord let me faithfully
[1:59:42] Lord play this part
[1:59:44] let me faithfully stamp your Lord we
[1:59:59] praise you Oh Lord Jesus
[2:00:04] oh we thank you Lord for your mercy I
[2:00:09] pray Lord John Brennan Lord may we lord
[2:00:15] us even we would leave may we leave with
[2:00:18] that place in our heart to say Lord but
[2:00:21] you spoke to my heart what you've been
[2:00:23] dealing in my life I'm gonna keep it
[2:00:25] before you in prayer I'm gonna keep it
[2:00:28] right there Lord I'm gonna stay right
[2:00:31] here Lord God
[2:00:32] it's a promise Lord as you said Lord to
[2:00:39] me I've been made more than concur
[2:00:43] with make kings and priests unto our God
[2:00:47] Lord Jesus we received that Lord
[2:00:54] I believe God that there's not one
[2:00:55] person not one there's no one in here
[2:00:58] that could say I'm content with where I
[2:01:00] am but I believe God that there each and
[2:01:03] every heart Lord there's a desire to
[2:01:05] move closer to you longing a desire to
[2:01:08] see more of you a longing Lord got four
[2:01:11] more of you Lord in their life Lord more
[2:01:15] of the supernatural or more of your
[2:01:18] working Lord or God I don't want to just
[2:01:21] Lord once in a while here but I want to
[2:01:23] hear from you Lord God Oh granny Lord
[2:01:28] Jesus I pray father
[2:01:31] this is Lord your word your promise Lord
[2:01:36] God may we be diligent lord with the
[2:01:39] word that's come to us handling it with
[2:01:42] a great responsibility Lord in which it
[2:01:44] was given becoming one with it Lord
[2:01:49] granite for Lord all that you asked us
[2:01:52] to do is submit ourselves Lord to take
[2:01:55] that word to pray over that word as your
[2:01:59] prophet started the message token he so
[2:02:02] ended it the same way he spoke of it
[2:02:05] Lord is being medicine that's in the
[2:02:07] cabinet that needs to be taken out then
[2:02:11] he ends it the same way it must be
[2:02:15] applied every day
[2:02:19] the blood must be blind
[2:02:23] as replying that word Lord the Spirit of
[2:02:26] God coming behind that word lifts us
[2:02:29] into that blood cell then comes to pass
[2:02:33] that promise when I see the Blood I will
[2:02:35] pass over you for the pass is within a
[2:02:40] smart
[2:02:41] I pray Heavenly Father grant that this
[2:02:46] morning Lord Jesus may we take that
[2:02:49] medicine Lord that word that's come
[2:02:53] sometimes Lord there's medicine
[2:02:55] oh my lord I think now and this this age
[2:02:59] Lord my children when they had coffee
[2:03:02] medicine the different things they've
[2:03:03] had to take from just a young age I
[2:03:05] thought it was something Lord we'd go to
[2:03:07] the pharmacist and they would say what
[2:03:09] kind of flavoring you want in it I've
[2:03:12] told them Lord so many times mine hey we
[2:03:16] never had flavoring you know to take
[2:03:18] things was it the way it tasted it was
[2:03:21] hard to get down
[2:03:23] once we got it down it was gonna do it's
[2:03:25] good lord
[2:03:29] it's us receiving
[2:03:32] yielding to that world applying that
[2:03:35] medicine applying the ointment Lord
[2:03:39] father you move behind it Lord having
[2:03:42] free as you as a prophet could say over
[2:03:45] and over he said the same God that saved
[2:03:48] your soul can you also heal your body
[2:03:54] can you also deliver you from that
[2:03:58] situation can can you also supply every
[2:04:01] other knee Oh his faithful Lord granted
[2:04:08] this morning Lord I commit Lord God each
