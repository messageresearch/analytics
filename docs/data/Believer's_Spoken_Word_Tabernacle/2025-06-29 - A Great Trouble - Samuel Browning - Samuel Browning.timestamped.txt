[41:38] know, I just I look at many times I'm
[41:42] always I'm thankful for another day to
[41:44] serve him, thankful for another
[41:47] opportunity to draw closer to him. I'm
[41:50] thankful for every time along the way
[41:52] that
[41:54] he corrects me,
[41:56] shows me his love and his grace.
[41:59] You know,
[42:01] I'm thankful for what he did in my life.
[42:06] Not only did he change my life, but he
[42:09] put a burden on the inside, a desire, a
[42:12] love for him. And you know what? When we

[42:22] Christ in you. Amen. It's Christ in you.

[42:31] beautiful day. And um I want to say God
[42:35] bless you to Amen. each and everyone
[42:37] that are gathered here, our visitors,
[42:39] God bless you. It's so so good to have
[42:40] you. And uh just uh different ones and
[42:45] my buddy brother Michael is here and
[42:48] sister Yokabed and Michael Jr. right
[42:51] there. And uh brother Michael um I was
[42:55] there with when you remember when I went
[42:57] to Mexico the last two times and brother
[43:00] Michael was my host. I was there and
[43:02] he's on a job over here. He when they do
[43:05] the those big petroleum plants when they
[43:08] go to idle them and shut them down and
[43:10] someone has to go in and do all of the
[43:13] repair inspection when they do that
[43:14] throughout the country. So, he's here
[43:17] for about four to six weeks and uh uh
[43:21] we're so glad to have him. And one of
[43:23] the times that he's going to be here, I
[43:25] do want him to give his testimony. It
[43:27] was really incredible. I've been
[43:29] burdened on my heart for to have him to
[43:31] give his testimony of how God brought
[43:33] him through because in one way every one
[43:37] of us, we all have our own testimony
[43:39] experience with God. But like brother
[43:42] Michael said in his he said with this
[43:45] testimony he said let it bring hope that
[43:48] there's no situation too dark or too
[43:52] great that God can't reach down. And so
[43:55] one of the services here we're trying to
[43:57] work that out and I certainly want to uh
[44:00] have have brother Michael to do that and
[44:02] we'll just follow a few things. It just
[44:04] God knows just everything right in time
[44:06] and so we're so glad to have you brother
[44:08] Michael Sister Yok. Amen. And um God
[44:11] bless you. Amen. Well, it's good to be
[44:14] together. Amen. It's good to be in his
[44:17] presence and it's just good to be with
[44:19] you all. Amen. Just good to be together.
[44:22] Amen. Could we just go to him in a word
[44:24] of prayer? Amen. And
[44:29] heavenly father,
[44:33] Lord,
[44:35] I know Lord that we're standing Lord in
[44:38] need of your grace. Lord, every one of
[44:40] us.
[44:42] Lord, I'm I'm probably the most in need
[44:45] right here this morning, Lord.
[44:49] And I'm asking, oh God, that you would
[44:52] give us together grace
[44:56] to be able to step out of the way, Lord,
[44:58] as speaker and hearer.
[45:01] Lord, I don't want to have any part in
[45:03] it, but just to get out of the way. And
[45:06] I'm asking that you would help me to do
[45:08] that this morning. Lord, help us, Lord,
[45:10] as a people that, Father, we can just
[45:14] move into that place, Lord, right in
[45:17] entering into your presence, Lord, just
[45:19] as we as the songs of Zion have been
[45:22] sung. And Lord, just an atmosphere is
[45:25] created,
[45:27] Lord. What a what a privilege it is,
[45:30] Lord, just to be gathered together. How
[45:33] I thank you, Lord, for each one of your
[45:35] children. And may you just come, Lord,
[45:38] and just just do something really
[45:40] special for us, Lord. Do something
[45:43] really special in our lives, Lord. That
[45:46] which, oh God, only you can do. Just
[45:50] draw us closer to you, Lord. Forgive us,
[45:53] Lord, I pray, of our shortcomings, Lord.
[45:57] Oh, Lord Jesus. May, Father, you just
[46:00] move in a way to minister. There's those
[46:03] in need of healing, Lord, and salvation,
[46:06] deliverance, oh God. It all lays within
[46:10] you, Lord. And we're just, God, asking
[46:12] that you'll just come in such a special
[46:14] way and take control in the service,
[46:17] Lord. For we ask all these things, Lord,
[46:20] for your glory in the name of Jesus
[46:23] Christ. Amen.
[46:26] Amen. Amen. If you would, let's turn to
[46:30] 1 Corinthians chapter 10.
[46:43] And I want to certainly tell you I was
[46:45] kind of I was torn even last to the last
[46:48] moment here just between two different
[46:52] um outlines and boy that makes me really
[46:55] nervous. Uh, I've got one part and we
[46:58] were looking I was going on going into
[47:01] some elements here within Ruth and this
[47:04] will this is actually a lot of the
[47:06] thought line within it. But God knows
[47:09] and he's mindful of our needs. Amen. So
[47:12] I certainly coveret your prayers because
[47:15] this was just something that begin to
[47:16] inspire to my heart just it's been a
[47:19] laying before me. It's been an outline
[47:20] that's laid there for months and uh just
[47:24] even so where we're at and uh well I
[47:28] kind of let you know what you see behind
[47:30] here. You don't see my nerves
[47:33] but may God help us. Amen. That's what
[47:35] we want. We want the Lord just to help
[47:37] us. 1 Corinthians chapter 10. Bri
[47:40] Brother Brian just turn it down just a
[47:42] little bit. I know that's asking a lot
[47:44] from me but uh just a tad bit. Sister
[47:46] Anna, when is Marco surgery?

[48:42] sister Ann. I was glad to glad to hear
[48:45] that that we'll it's we've got times
[48:48] where we pray in the update. So we'll
[48:50] we'll keep everybody updated here. Um 1
[48:53] Corinthians chapter 10 and verse one.
[48:56] Moreover, brethren, I would not that you
[48:59] should be ignorant how that all our
[49:02] fathers were under the cloud and all
[49:05] passed through the sea and were all
[49:07] baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in
[49:10] the sea. And did all eat the same
[49:14] spiritual meat? And did all drink the
[49:17] same spiritual drink? For they drank of
[49:20] that spiritual rock that followed them.
[49:23] And that rock was Christ. But with many
[49:26] of them God was not well pleased, for
[49:29] they were overthrown in the wilderness.
[49:33] Now these things were our examples. to
[49:37] the intent we should not lust after evil
[49:39] things as they also lusted. Neither be
[49:43] ye idolattors, as were some of them, as
[49:47] it is written, the people sat down to
[49:50] eat and drink, and rose up to play.
[49:54] Neither let us commit fornication, as
[49:57] some of them committed, and fell in one
[49:59] day three and 20,000.
[50:02] Neither let us tempt Christ as some of
[50:05] them also tempted and were destroyed of
[50:08] serpents.
[50:10] Neither murmur murmur ye as some of them
[50:13] also murmured and were destroyed of the
[50:16] destroyer.
[50:18] Now all these things happened unto them
[50:21] for insamples, and they are written for
[50:24] our admonition upon whom the ends of the
[50:27] world are come. Wherefore let him that
[50:31] thinkketh he standeth take heed lest he
[50:34] fall. There hath no temptation taken
[50:38] you. But such is common to man. But God
[50:41] is faithful who will not suffer you to
[50:44] be tempted above that ye are able, but
[50:47] will with the temptation also make a way
[50:49] to escape that you may be able to bear
[50:52] it. Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee
[50:57] from idolatry. Amen. May God bless you
[51:00] and bless the reading of the word as
[51:01] you're being seated.
[51:03] I'd like to speak here this morning and
[51:06] we'll get into the point here on a great
[51:09] trouble.
[51:11] A great trouble. We certainly know that
[51:13] we are living in a time of trouble.
[51:18] And that as David would write in Psalms
[51:22] 27 that
[51:25] he would hide me in the time of trouble
[51:29] and hide me in the secret of his
[51:32] pavilion in his presence. And the whole
[51:37] the whole point within that is that when
[51:40] we think back to the tabernacle in the
[51:42] wilderness, we come to the outer court
[51:45] and you come to the inner court and once
[51:47] into the holiest of holies
[51:50] there when that veil drops there's a
[51:52] there's a silencing of all things around
[51:55] us. Now we can still hear a lot of
[51:59] things but when the veil when Christ
[52:01] himself of the Holy Spirit the seal of
[52:04] the living God has come upon our soul by
[52:08] way of the new birth there's a settling
[52:10] there's a peace within that passes all
[52:12] understanding that no matter what
[52:15] trouble we see taking place and we do
[52:18] see a lot of trouble and it's not going
[52:20] to get any better but these are the
[52:23] things that when Jesus said when you
[52:25] begin to see these things taking place.
[52:27] Lift up your head. Your redemption is
[52:29] drawing nigh.
[52:31] The rest the world, they're in a the
[52:33] world itself is in a very nervous and a
[52:36] very tense uh moment. Just, you know,
[52:38] you you see this even with wars and
[52:40] rumors of wars and it it it's just
[52:43] continued to grow. And I I tell you that
[52:45] there's only one place of safety and
[52:47] shity and one place that in through all
[52:50] of this where you and I can actually
[52:52] draw a real peace from and that's in the
[52:55] Lord Jesus Christ. Everything else is so
[52:58] uncertain. It's so volatile. It's so
[53:00] easy. And I I believe we're standing in
[53:03] the in the times of the going home of
[53:05] the church of the living God. There's
[53:07] things that we've heard and we've heard
[53:09] that said and we've preached that we're
[53:11] standing in this hour. But I tell you,
[53:13] it's real. It's upon us in this time. We
[53:16] see all the signs of the time that's
[53:18] right around us exactly as God spoke in
[53:21] his word and prophesied it there through
[53:23] his prophet. And I think it's a time in
[53:25] an hour that if there's anything at all
[53:28] that we want to be as Lord, I want to be
[53:31] fully into you, Lord. I want that life
[53:34] to be fully I want to just I want to be
[53:37] fully in Christ and Christ have full
[53:40] preeminence in my life. And so we look
[53:43] at this of a of a great trouble and and
[53:46] taking of the scripture where we're
[53:48] looking and reading our text and know
[53:50] that it was a great background that Paul
[53:52] is referring to when they came out of
[53:54] Egypt. And we know that there for
[53:57] redemption. there's a coming out and a
[53:59] and a going into God's desire was not
[54:02] just to bring them out of Egypt and and
[54:04] just have them in the wilderness, but
[54:06] the objective was is that they would
[54:08] come into the promised land into their
[54:11] inheritance. And so God sent a message
[54:14] that brought came down in Egypt and
[54:17] began to break the holds of of what
[54:20] where Egypt and that strong power that
[54:22] was around their life. And here they
[54:24] come out and they're walking. They're
[54:26] eating of the of the mana as it's
[54:28] falling. They're drinking water from the
[54:31] rock. They're passing right through the
[54:33] Red Sea. These the the people saw such
[54:36] miraculous even when they were in Egypt.
[54:39] And then even as they're walking out,
[54:41] such miraculous. But in the midst of it,
[54:45] this is at right coming up to the
[54:47] promise is where they were overthrown.
[54:50] They were overthrown right as they came
[54:52] up and the promise was brought before
[54:54] them when the spies came back with that
[54:58] with with that of the grapes and that
[55:00] promise of the other land and and there
[55:02] were those who at that point and they
[55:04] just they had been murmuring all along
[55:06] there. There had been all of these
[55:08] things taking place all along. But you
[55:10] know out of all of those people there
[55:13] were two who were absolutely ordained to
[55:17] enter into the land. That's right. And
[55:19] I'm talking about out of those who came
[55:21] out originally. And even when God when
[55:24] God told them that when those that
[55:26] disbelieved of uh from those who came
[55:28] out from bringing back the you know the
[55:31] spies of the land and when they came
[55:33] back from that God they said oh that we
[55:35] and our children would be prey. And God
[55:38] let it be known that I will take their
[55:40] children and I'll take their children in
[55:42] whom they said would be prey. Let me
[55:44] just say this. We're we're not when
[55:46] we're coming to approach the promises of
[55:49] God, we're not coming under our
[55:51] naturalist strength. We're not coming
[55:53] under our natural ability. This isn't
[55:55] mind over matter. This isn't who has the
[55:58] best intellect. The only acceptable way
[56:01] to approach God is by faith. The Bible
[56:05] said that whomsoever cometh to God must
[56:07] first believe that he is and he's a
[56:10] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[56:12] him. And it is God who equips you and I
[56:15] as we will surrender to give us the
[56:18] strength and what is needed for that
[56:20] word to come to pass in our life because
[56:23] it's not by power, not by might, but by
[56:26] my spirit, sayeth the Lord, this
[56:28] mountain shall be removed. And when we
[56:31] consider this that they they they did
[56:34] not understand all of the miracles that
[56:36] even were displayed among them. You
[56:39] know, if if they would have understood
[56:41] it, if they would have taken it into
[56:43] consideration, it was God letting them
[56:46] know that I'm right here with you and I
[56:49] am all that you have need of. Even as
[56:52] you come into the land, all the
[56:54] obstacles that are before you, I am all
[56:57] that you have need of. But there was
[57:01] just that they they took the miracles
[57:04] and you know, yeah, they would eat the
[57:05] mana, they drank the rock, but to
[57:08] understand that it's God's care, it's
[57:10] God's love and God's provision for our
[57:13] life. And if God would would be so
[57:16] mindful to provide of the natural
[57:19] necessities of life, how much greater
[57:22] has God provided the spiritual
[57:25] necessities that you and I have need of
[57:28] to be able to live a victorious life. He
[57:32] is Jehovah Gyra. It's him that's
[57:34] providing. So when we look at this this
[57:37] this scripture that we're reading, Paul
[57:40] is very cautious of those who are even
[57:43] gathered around to say, "Let him that
[57:46] thinks that he stands take heed lest he
[57:48] fall." Now Paul is not asking them to be
[57:51] unsettled or to be uncertain. But you
[57:54] know, there's something about your life
[57:56] as a believer that when God begins to
[57:59] take a hold of your life, there's a
[58:01] reflection that comes in your life.
[58:03] There's a desire that moves in your
[58:05] heart that you want to please him. You
[58:08] want to do those things that are right
[58:10] and you know it's something that's
[58:11] ongoing. Let me just say it like this.
[58:14] Even as God begins to make himself known
[58:17] to an individual and conviction strikes
[58:19] their heart. They repent and here they
[58:22] are moving into the waters of baptism to
[58:24] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[58:26] Jesus Christ. For what purpose? Because
[58:29] to be united with him. because he said
[58:31] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[58:34] Ghost. It's about him. And then we see
[58:36] when the Holy Spirit is come even into a
[58:38] life, there's a desire now that has has
[58:42] rose up on the inside. And with that,
[58:44] it's a ferveny, a desire to please him.
[58:48] It isn't that everything boom all at
[58:50] once. But there's things that God is
[58:52] working in our life as we'll submit and
[58:54] we'll surrender because he's teaching us
[58:57] all along the way to yield to him and he
[59:00] will press his life through us. Now I
[59:04] want you just to catch this here and
[59:06] looking at this thought because there's
[59:08] two points in this scripture where it
[59:10] says that they that the very things
[59:13] neither be idoltors. And you would think
[59:16] Paul, why would Paul even mention this?
[59:18] Or even murmuring. And I think we could
[59:20] probably resolve on this that we've all
[59:23] been in places of murmuring.
[59:27] We all have. And and being in those
[59:29] places, we also have come to recognize
[59:32] and repent of our murmuring.
[59:36] God's God's been very gracious to us in
[59:38] within this. And yet he would say here
[59:42] neither even in the last scripture my
[59:44] dearly beloved flee from idolatry. Now I
[59:48] want you to think about this because no
[59:50] doubt in our minds we would look and say
[59:53] my I'm not an idoltor. I you know I I
[59:56] don't worship idols or anything. Well
[59:58] let's just look at what God's prophet
[1:00:00] says here. He says you think oh I thank
[1:00:03] God I'm not an idoltor. Wait just a
[1:00:05] minute. Let's examine it by the word.
[1:00:07] You say, "I wouldn't worship an idol."
[1:00:10] That doesn't altogether mean you worship
[1:00:12] an idol. You just have to be idol.
[1:00:15] That's ide.
[1:00:19] Yeah, that's all right. Go back home, do
[1:00:21] nothing about it. But brother, a real
[1:00:24] bornagain man or woman can't stand
[1:00:26] still. There's something in them.
[1:00:29] They've got to testify. They've got to
[1:00:32] do something. They are bound to do
[1:00:34] something. they can't hold their peace.
[1:00:38] So what's he dealing with? Because when
[1:00:40] we have that of of God's own life moving
[1:00:44] and pulsating in our life, now listen,
[1:00:46] there's a lot of imagery you could get
[1:00:48] in your mind. But let me just narrow it
[1:00:50] down to this. Where there is a pulsation
[1:00:54] and a desire for God, I want you to
[1:00:57] think there's got to be an outlet in our
[1:00:59] life. When the spirit of God has come
[1:01:01] into our life, there's got to be an
[1:01:03] outlet. When he comes into our lives, it
[1:01:06] is that that where the spirit of God
[1:01:08] comes into our lives and there's fruit
[1:01:10] that will come out of the indwelling of
[1:01:13] the Holy Spirit in our lives. It it's
[1:01:15] not just going to be a life that's idle.
[1:01:18] You know, you know how it is. You can
[1:01:19] come to a an intersection and sit there
[1:01:21] in your car and you put it in neutral.
[1:01:23] You can give it all the gas you want.
[1:01:25] It's standing right there. you know,
[1:01:27] even when it's in park, you start it up
[1:01:29] and, you know, we can push the gas
[1:01:31] pedal. It's idle or idling even if you
[1:01:34] don't touch anything. It's just it's
[1:01:35] staying in one place. And I believe
[1:01:38] that's where the Holy Spirit was
[1:01:40] mentioning through Paul and encouraging
[1:01:42] the church of the living God is don't
[1:01:45] become complacent. do not become to a
[1:01:48] place to where we look at it that well
[1:01:51] we we've got it made and my God has
[1:01:53] given us a message and even in our lives
[1:01:56] to be able to look at it and say well I
[1:01:58] you know I I know my life has been
[1:02:00] changed and I know the things that I
[1:02:02] once loved I no longer love and and and
[1:02:04] and there you know I I just love the
[1:02:06] Lord but don't allow our lives to become
[1:02:09] to a place to where it's just in the
[1:02:12] same position or same place over and
[1:02:15] over but we want to be moving moving on
[1:02:17] with God. I want you to listen to these
[1:02:20] couple of these statements here. You
[1:02:22] know, this is why that that the prophet
[1:02:24] would go on to say, he said, "We might
[1:02:25] pastor the greatest churches in the land
[1:02:27] and might be as pious as we can be. No
[1:02:30] man can put a finger on our lives. But
[1:02:32] until that soul that's on the inside of
[1:02:34] us is on fire for God. Until something
[1:02:37] in there that yearning after him, like
[1:02:40] the heart panteth for the waterbrook, my
[1:02:43] soul thirst after thee, oh God. Until we
[1:02:46] get to that type of an experience. So
[1:02:48] it's coming back down to remember a
[1:02:50] desire, a thirst. What is it that David
[1:02:54] said in Psalms 27? He said, "This one
[1:02:58] thing have I desired that I may dwell in
[1:03:03] the house of the Lord." You see,
[1:03:05] dwelling in his presence. Not just not
[1:03:07] just here, but yet it is a longing. It's
[1:03:10] a desire. And you know, that becomes
[1:03:12] more real to us. As you and I have been
[1:03:14] serving the Lord and you're pressing on
[1:03:17] in in in in in serving him, this becomes
[1:03:20] more meaningful to you and I. It's
[1:03:22] things that begins to stand out of being
[1:03:25] in the house of God. And look, I thank
[1:03:27] God for streaming, but you know,
[1:03:29] streaming does nowhere come near what it
[1:03:31] is to be in the house of God. Are you
[1:03:34] understand me? It's not something to
[1:03:36] substitute. It's not something to wear
[1:03:38] that, well, I'll catch up on it. I got
[1:03:39] other things to do. I I don't believe
[1:03:41] that we should approach God like that
[1:03:43] because we cannot have the full blessing
[1:03:45] because he said, "Seek ye first the
[1:03:47] kingdom of God and his righteousness and
[1:03:50] all these other things will be added
[1:03:52] unto you." When you put God first, then
[1:03:55] God when you put him first, then God
[1:03:57] will fulfill his word. Let me tell you
[1:03:59] something. When you put him first, he'll
[1:04:01] relieve you of the anxieties that you
[1:04:04] have about the things of this life. As a
[1:04:06] matter of fact, he'll give you an
[1:04:08] answer. He'll even move supernaturally
[1:04:10] on your behalf for even the natural
[1:04:12] things in this life. Hallelujah. He's
[1:04:15] our provider. God God did not mean for
[1:04:18] us to be taken with these things. As
[1:04:20] Jesus said, take no thought for
[1:04:22] tomorrow.
[1:04:24] Right? It didn't mean don't plan. It
[1:04:26] didn't mean not do anything. It meant
[1:04:29] don't become wrapped up with the
[1:04:31] anxieties of the next day and you say,
[1:04:33] "How can I not do that?" That's not just
[1:04:35] something you tell somebody. Hey, don't
[1:04:37] do this. Hey, don't do this. There's a
[1:04:39] remedy and that remedy is putting him
[1:04:42] first. And when you put him first, it
[1:04:45] pushes out and does not give an
[1:04:47] opportunity for those things to mount
[1:04:49] up.
[1:04:51] Hallelujah. Now, let me ask you this. If
[1:04:54] I said, "Who's the most miserable
[1:04:55] person?"
[1:04:58] There's a lot of things that no doubt
[1:05:00] would go through your mind today.
[1:05:03] Who could possibly be the most miserable
[1:05:05] person?
[1:05:07] Let me give you let me let me read this
[1:05:08] to you. The prophet says it like this.
[1:05:10] He said, "A fellow that would say,"Well,
[1:05:14] I'd go to church and I do the best I
[1:05:16] can. That's the most miserable person I
[1:05:19] know of in all of America." Is the
[1:05:22] person who says, "I do the best I can. I
[1:05:25] go to church. I hope I'm all right." The
[1:05:28] salvation of Jesus Christ is not a hope.
[1:05:34] It's a no. Let me just say this. Let me
[1:05:37] just say it very very clear. That's not
[1:05:39] God's plan is that we're just hoping
[1:05:42] that we make it. That's what Calvary
[1:05:45] made a way that there could come a
[1:05:47] divine assurance into our lives by the
[1:05:50] spirit of God that what had was done on
[1:05:53] Calvary, it settled all debts.
[1:05:57] It paid the price for every need that
[1:06:00] was in our life for salvation. Let me
[1:06:02] tell you, every habit was defeated at
[1:06:05] Calvary.
[1:06:07] Every demon spirit was defeated at
[1:06:10] Calvary. Every family strain was
[1:06:12] defeated at Calvary.
[1:06:15] Amen. Hallelujah. It was satisfied right
[1:06:20] there at Calvary. And he rose for our
[1:06:23] justification. And he brought back a
[1:06:25] message to you and I that you and I
[1:06:28] would not be left in a place of I wonder
[1:06:30] if I'm all right. I wonder if this is
[1:06:33] okay. And to deliver us something
[1:06:35] greater than just a hope so, but a no.
[1:06:38] So, I tell you right here this morning,
[1:06:40] even by the words going forth, God can
[1:06:43] deliver right in your heart. A no.
[1:06:47] It don't make you arrogant. It don't
[1:06:49] puff you up, but it gives you a
[1:06:50] stability in this life. It's the rest of
[1:06:53] Almighty God.
[1:06:55] You know when you're Christ, the Holy
[1:06:57] Spirit bears record with your spirit
[1:06:59] that you're sons and daughters of God.
[1:07:00] That's Romans 8. Old things have passed
[1:07:02] away. All things have become new. Not a
[1:07:05] borderline, you know, Christian. If the
[1:07:08] crowd's going this way, you go with it.
[1:07:10] If it goes that way, you go with it. But
[1:07:12] stay in the road. Stand in the liberty
[1:07:14] where Christ has made you free. Be not
[1:07:18] again entangled in the yoke of bondage
[1:07:20] or halfway. God said it made him sick. I
[1:07:23] would that you were hot or cold for
[1:07:25] lukewarm. He said he'd spew it out of
[1:07:27] his mouth. God doesn't want a person
[1:07:30] that's just a professor without being a
[1:07:33] possessor of the blessings of God. That
[1:07:37] is so good.
[1:07:39] Now, let me just look even at one little
[1:07:42] you look at even an an outlet of things
[1:07:45] of how that God would so work through
[1:07:47] our life. I want you to think about that
[1:07:50] probably everyone, not probably every
[1:07:52] one of us in here when God began to deal
[1:07:55] with our lives and get a hold of our
[1:07:57] life, there was discipling that took
[1:08:00] place. Oh, absolutely. Are you hearing
[1:08:02] me? It wasn't just something to wear
[1:08:04] that you were just off on your own. And
[1:08:06] what I mean is God had people who were
[1:08:11] already filled with him the comforter.
[1:08:16] And it now becomes a display like he was
[1:08:19] with the disciples where he was a
[1:08:22] comforter with them and he told them if
[1:08:26] I go away I will send to you another
[1:08:29] comforter. So you see God provides that
[1:08:33] himself with flesh on the spirit of God
[1:08:36] a discipling even in lives that are
[1:08:39] coming around young ones new ones it
[1:08:42] doesn't matter about age but to think
[1:08:44] there's got to be an outlet in our life
[1:08:46] let me just tell you it's simple to kind
[1:08:48] of look at it and say when is the last
[1:08:50] time that we thought or considered these
[1:08:53] things about even who's in our midst
[1:08:57] yeah it's good how can I be a help now I
[1:09:00] I say that because look look at Ruth and
[1:09:02] Naomi. Ruth was not just left on her
[1:09:05] own. Ruth was being guided and nurtured
[1:09:09] by Naomi. She was being she was there
[1:09:12] and there was an instruction. Naomi
[1:09:14] couldn't do it for her. But Naomi was
[1:09:16] there as one to disciple. It was an
[1:09:19] outlet. But it was Ruth that would have
[1:09:21] to make the decisions. It was Ruth that
[1:09:24] her faith would have to grow in the
[1:09:26] promise. But all the time there was
[1:09:29] discipling that was taking place. And I
[1:09:32] think that's one of the great things
[1:09:33] within our lives. I I know friends that
[1:09:36] there's a lot of things where the enemy
[1:09:38] there's a lot of things sometimes where
[1:09:40] we can become so busy with the things of
[1:09:42] this life. But I say God help us to be
[1:09:46] aware and be mindful that listen, God
[1:09:48] has called you and I into that place to
[1:09:51] disciple others. Amen. Amen.
[1:09:55] What a what an awesome thing from our
[1:09:58] children to others around us. Now,
[1:10:00] that's just one of the outworkings of
[1:10:02] the Holy Spirit where it'll work out in
[1:10:04] our life. You know, don't you love to
[1:10:06] get together and talk about the things
[1:10:08] of God? Isn't it wonderful when
[1:10:10] fellowship you sit down and you begin to
[1:10:12] fellowship on the things of God and and
[1:10:15] talk about the things of God and see
[1:10:17] there is such a such a reality within
[1:10:20] that part of discipling and encouraging
[1:10:23] someone along the way. Now I agree that
[1:10:26] the quickening power comes to raise up
[1:10:29] the sea but God has a many membered body
[1:10:32] that that life travels through and that
[1:10:35] there is discipling that takes place.
[1:10:38] Now I want you to think of this. How you
[1:10:41] got many scriptures I could go on here.
[1:10:43] But the Bible said when they had
[1:10:44] preached the gospel to the city and
[1:10:46] taught many and they returned to Lystra
[1:10:49] to Iconium and I and Antioch confirming
[1:10:52] the souls of the disciples and exhorting
[1:10:55] them to continue in the faith that we
[1:10:57] must through much tribulation enter into
[1:11:00] the kingdom of God. Many many other
[1:11:02] scriptures that we could lay in here and
[1:11:04] you read this in Paul's letters. You
[1:11:06] read it through the book of Acts of
[1:11:08] where that when the Holy Spirit would
[1:11:11] begin to direct them into a place, they
[1:11:14] would stay and they would labor right
[1:11:16] there in that place. For do what? To
[1:11:19] encourage those who were new converts in
[1:11:23] the Lord to press on. Amen. Sometimes we
[1:11:27] wonder, we wonder wonder why someone's
[1:11:29] not further along. Maybe maybe maybe
[1:11:32] it's because God there's not been
[1:11:34] discipling as it ought to be.
[1:11:37] You see, we we remember those things. I
[1:11:39] remember when God first got a hold of my
[1:11:41] life. Listen, friends, I I believe it
[1:11:42] like this. I I believe it's things that
[1:11:44] you and I can look into the word of God
[1:11:46] and say, "Lord, what would you have me
[1:11:48] do?" No, not just don't we don't have to
[1:11:50] imagine something and and we don't have
[1:11:52] to take something as though that my you
[1:11:54] know my this is sharp, this is stern.
[1:11:56] No, no, no. Let let's take it the way
[1:11:58] God wants us to see it and that is Lord
[1:12:01] what would you have me do what's my part
[1:12:04] Lord
[1:12:07] now in the message divine healing you
[1:12:11] know brother says every time you know he
[1:12:13] says every time we believe a little that
[1:12:15] little speck in here gets bigger and
[1:12:17] bigger and it'll swell out and you know
[1:12:19] he becomes to you believe all things and
[1:12:21] and as all things begin to come in love
[1:12:23] begins to come in doubt and hatred and
[1:12:26] malice and fear just flies out. It
[1:12:28] spreads out. It gets so big it bursts
[1:12:30] out the little shell. See, the more of
[1:12:33] God, the more when when the Holy Spirit
[1:12:36] is coming into our life, listen there,
[1:12:39] the world cannot remain there, but the
[1:12:42] more that that he will grow within our
[1:12:44] life, the more that we will yield, it
[1:12:47] pushes out the other things of the
[1:12:49] world. So, it's not you and I pushing
[1:12:52] them out. It's Christ in us pushing them
[1:12:55] out. Amen. Amen. Now look at this. He
[1:12:59] says, "Now you know sometimes he said
[1:13:01] you see people sit around and say,
[1:13:02] "Well, I've accepted the Lord and you
[1:13:04] take your word for it, but I can't
[1:13:06] judge. God does that. But in 10 years
[1:13:08] from now, they've never progressed a bit
[1:13:11] just staying right in the same old
[1:13:13] place." But we are to grow daily. Each
[1:13:17] day our heart hungers and keeps moving
[1:13:19] on. There is something growing inside of
[1:13:22] you. As Paul told the the Corinthian
[1:13:25] church, you're maturing. You're growing.
[1:13:27] You ought to be teachers, but you're
[1:13:29] babes in need of teaching. When you
[1:13:31] ought to be teachers, see something in
[1:13:33] there growing out, pushing out, making
[1:13:36] bigger. It's the Holy Spirit growing,
[1:13:40] and a birth, a birth happens from from
[1:13:43] the inside out. And there is a growth.
[1:13:45] And when they birth itself is on the
[1:13:48] inside, it will grow. But Christ in your
[1:13:52] heart ought to be growing daily, getting
[1:13:54] bigger, more powerful, understanding
[1:13:57] things better, forgiving, walking on as
[1:13:59] God would till Christ be formed in you
[1:14:02] the hope of glory. I say praise be to
[1:14:05] God. It's Christ him him working in our
[1:14:09] lives. When the Holy Spirit is come into
[1:14:12] our life, then by the new birth, then
[1:14:15] it's him working his way out. Listen,
[1:14:17] you do not start out as a fully matured
[1:14:20] son and daughter of God. No sir, you
[1:14:24] don't start out. This is why you can
[1:14:26] look and say, "Well, I see my life and I
[1:14:28] see somebody else's life." Don't compare
[1:14:31] yourself with nobody else.
[1:14:34] Your comparison is with God's word and
[1:14:37] how God is dealing with you right now.
[1:14:42] Nobody else. God can take right down
[1:14:44] through this service and he'll speak his
[1:14:46] word and it'll say something to you.
[1:14:49] It'll say something different to you.
[1:14:51] It'll say something different to you.
[1:14:53] But all together, he's encouraging us to
[1:14:56] grow and to press on. Hallelujah.
[1:15:00] That is so good.
[1:15:01] The battles, listen, the battles that I
[1:15:04] once had when I was first converted,
[1:15:08] those things God has given grace that
[1:15:10] those things no longer trouble me.
[1:15:14] Amen. You know why? Because there has to
[1:15:16] be a birth on the inside and the Holy
[1:15:19] Spirit. It's him growing and pushing out
[1:15:22] in our life. And you know what? It's the
[1:15:24] more you take in. It's like I said
[1:15:26] before about this, you know, like a cup
[1:15:28] of water. I know this a bottle of water.
[1:15:30] If you try to put more, if I had this in
[1:15:33] a cup and you put a bunch of ice in
[1:15:35] there, guess what's going to happen?
[1:15:38] It's going to displace the water. The
[1:15:40] water's going to be everywhere.
[1:15:41] Everybody knows you got them
[1:15:43] refrigerators now. You know, there's no
[1:15:44] such thing as the ones we used to crack
[1:15:46] the ice trays almost, you know, but you
[1:15:48] know, you can go in there and you have
[1:15:50] your kids, they've got a glass full and
[1:15:52] here they go, boy, and maybe it's
[1:15:53] Kool-Aid or orange juice and they're
[1:15:55] getting ready to put ice and they go
[1:15:56] over to the ice machine and they have
[1:15:58] that glass filled up almost to the brim.
[1:16:00] And as soon as that ice starts coming in
[1:16:03] that glass, it goes everywhere all over
[1:16:05] the tray. It's dripping down the
[1:16:06] refrigerator. It's all over the floor.
[1:16:08] Why? Because the ice forced out liquid
[1:16:12] that was in there. And let me tell you,
[1:16:14] that's what the Holy Spirit does in your
[1:16:17] life. As you'll feed on the word, it
[1:16:19] will force out malice. It will force out
[1:16:22] unforgiveness. It will force out the
[1:16:24] things of this world. What's doing that?
[1:16:26] The word of God. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:16:31] Blessed be his name. Amen.
[1:16:34] So notice when Paul would write this
[1:16:37] here in 1 Corinthians 9, know you not
[1:16:40] that they which run in a race run, run
[1:16:44] all, but one receiveth the prize. So run
[1:16:47] that ye may obtain.
[1:16:50] And every man that striveth for the
[1:16:52] mastery is temperate in all things.
[1:16:56] Right? That means he's mindful of even
[1:17:00] eating this food could throw me off
[1:17:03] tomorrow.
[1:17:04] Temperate. He's he's mindful even in the
[1:17:06] things he's Why is he mindful about what
[1:17:10] he indulges in? And it's not about that
[1:17:12] he can't have a hamburger. He can't have
[1:17:14] this a milkshake. He can't He can do
[1:17:17] what he wants to do. But what he's
[1:17:19] beginning to look at is I know what
[1:17:21] happens in my life and my walk if I
[1:17:24] indulge in those things.
[1:17:27] That's the same way that happens in our
[1:17:30] life. We begin to learn. We begin to
[1:17:32] grow in the things of God and realize
[1:17:35] that as Paul said, all things are lawful
[1:17:38] unto me. Right? But however, not all
[1:17:40] things are expedient. Right? Is that
[1:17:43] right? Not everything. Not everything.
[1:17:45] I've learned what things further my walk
[1:17:48] with God. And I've learned what things
[1:17:50] slow it down. I've learned what things
[1:17:52] help me and what things don't. I've
[1:17:54] learned even in situations of what
[1:17:56] situations to get into and what not.
[1:17:59] Right. Amen. Yeah. Yes, sir. You say,
[1:18:02] "Brother, you know, brother Samuel, that
[1:18:04] that that that's that's pretty simple.
[1:18:06] That's part of maturing.
[1:18:08] That's part of reflecting in our life
[1:18:10] and recognizing and taking dominion in
[1:18:13] our life." Amen.
[1:18:16] Now they do it to obtain a corruptible
[1:18:18] crown, but we incorruptible. I therefore
[1:18:21] so run, not as uncertainty, so fight I
[1:18:24] not as one that beatth air. In other
[1:18:26] words, Paul said, I am landing punches.
[1:18:30] I'm not just here swinging in the ring.
[1:18:34] See, back then in that day, you won the
[1:18:36] bout by how long you could dodge.
[1:18:40] I I know Muhammad Ali didn't live back
[1:18:42] in this time, but that was one of his
[1:18:44] tactics. Right? You see, he he wore
[1:18:47] down. That's how it happened to George
[1:18:48] Foreman. He wore down to a certain time
[1:18:50] and then he stepped in.
[1:18:53] This is Paul is saying the exact
[1:18:54] opposite. He's saying, "I'm not one
[1:18:56] that's beating the air. I'm not just
[1:18:58] swinging and it's not connecting. These
[1:19:00] punches are connecting." Now, how are
[1:19:03] these punches connected? Because they
[1:19:05] are being directed by the Holy Spirit.
[1:19:08] Amen.
[1:19:10] Oh, glory be to God. So, we've got some
[1:19:12] punching to do.
[1:19:15] Hallelujah. But I keep under my body and
[1:19:19] bring it into subjection, lest by any
[1:19:22] means when I have preached to others, I
[1:19:25] myself should be a cast away. My how
[1:19:30] Paul himself realized the importance he
[1:19:34] had to keep his body that meant that of
[1:19:38] flesh and spirit in subjection
[1:19:42] that meant it wanted to do certain
[1:19:44] things but he brought it into subjection
[1:19:47] to the spirit that was on the inside and
[1:19:51] he did that for this very purpose he
[1:19:53] said lest when I preach to others I
[1:19:56] would be a cast away because the word
[1:19:58] that God delivered through Paul, that
[1:20:00] revelation was perfect. Is that right?
[1:20:04] That's why Paul could say, "Whoever
[1:20:06] preaches any other gospel, let him be
[1:20:08] accursed."
[1:20:10] Right? Let let them know those that be a
[1:20:13] prophet, preacher, or spiritual,
[1:20:15] acknowledge that the things that I have
[1:20:17] written unto you are the commandments of
[1:20:19] the Lord. Amen. So we we have to look at
[1:20:22] these things and mindful of the of of
[1:20:26] where we are and what as we're walking
[1:20:28] within this life. Paul would write like
[1:20:30] this in Galatians 5. Walk in the spirit
[1:20:34] and you shall not fulfill the lust of
[1:20:37] the flesh.
[1:20:40] For the flesh lusteth against the
[1:20:42] spirit, capital S, and the spirit
[1:20:46] against the flesh. And these are
[1:20:48] contrary the one to the other so that
[1:20:52] you cannot do the things that you would.
[1:20:54] But if you be led of the spirit, ye are
[1:20:57] not under the law. So I'm not doing it
[1:21:01] because I have to do it. We are being
[1:21:03] led by the spirit of God. But there is a
[1:21:06] battle. There is a war once the Holy
[1:21:09] Spirit has taken a hold of your life.
[1:21:12] And listen, even when he's in process,
[1:21:14] there is a battle. Satan does not want
[1:21:18] to give one inch of ground. And let me
[1:21:21] tell you, he doesn't stop even when the
[1:21:23] Holy Spirit has come. That's why the
[1:21:25] prophet said you at one point in your
[1:21:27] life sapped along anyway. But one time
[1:21:31] when you said, I have the Holy Ghost, he
[1:21:33] said every gun out of hell is trained on
[1:21:36] your life.
[1:21:40] Hallelujah. It makes you look at the
[1:21:43] opposition different. Why? Because of
[1:21:45] the desire in your life.
[1:21:49] Now, let me I'm getting here to to my
[1:21:51] point. When you look at this on the in
[1:21:54] the thirst, every every individual,
[1:21:56] every person that is placed upon this
[1:21:58] earth has has a thirst.
[1:22:02] There there is a longing. And you know,
[1:22:05] you might look and say, well, only those
[1:22:07] who who have a longing for God. But no,
[1:22:10] God placed a thirst in every man. But it
[1:22:13] is it entirely depends on what that
[1:22:17] individual will yield that thirst to.
[1:22:19] That thirst is to know God. That's
[1:22:22] right. That's why God put that thirst in
[1:22:25] you. Some will satisfy it with try to
[1:22:28] satisfy it with things of this world.
[1:22:30] Try to quieten it, you know, with so
[1:22:32] many different things. Well, you know,
[1:22:33] from drinking to on and on. I mean, but
[1:22:36] you know, it can be satisfied with
[1:22:37] things. It's not even drinking.
[1:22:39] Sometimes there the substitute can
[1:22:41] become a person will worship their
[1:22:43] family.
[1:22:45] They'll worship their church, right?
[1:22:50] So it can so Satan remember his
[1:22:52] objective is to try to displace that
[1:22:54] thirst.
[1:22:56] But God has a provided way for that
[1:23:00] thirst to be satisfied. And there's only
[1:23:03] one place where that can be and that's
[1:23:04] in him. Amen. I want you to listen to
[1:23:07] this very carefully here. In 1965 here
[1:23:09] the prophet said we find God gives the
[1:23:12] control tower to you. He gives to you
[1:23:14] things that you need. The control tower
[1:23:17] in you is what directs you. And and this
[1:23:19] it runs in on this control tower and
[1:23:22] tells you what you have need of
[1:23:24] spiritually speaking. And the control
[1:23:26] tower in the body and in the soul also.
[1:23:30] So he's dealing with there's the control
[1:23:32] tower in the soul. There's the control
[1:23:34] tower in the body. The control tower in
[1:23:35] the body. It calls for the natural
[1:23:37] things of life. But that of the control
[1:23:40] tower of the soul, it's calling for the
[1:23:43] eternal things. Amen. There is a control
[1:23:46] tower in the body that tells you the
[1:23:48] need that's in your body and it's
[1:23:50] brought to you by thirst. There is a
[1:23:53] control tower in your soul that tells
[1:23:55] you the spiritual things that you have
[1:23:57] need of something in your spirit. And
[1:24:00] you by this can tell what kind of a life
[1:24:03] is controlling you. That is so good. See
[1:24:07] how many in here have been thirsty? My
[1:24:09] lord, in the past few days, my goodness,
[1:24:11] who couldn't have been thirsty,
[1:24:13] right? I mean, I was sitting there back
[1:24:16] in the office and my, you know, and
[1:24:18] sometimes in the morning I'm I'm
[1:24:19] coughing and stuff like that and
[1:24:21] everything else is dry and I realize,
[1:24:23] wait a minute here, I probably had too
[1:24:24] much coffee this morning. I need to have
[1:24:26] something a little bit different.
[1:24:30] Even though coffee is is is liquid, I
[1:24:33] needed something different. I needed
[1:24:34] some water. I need you there. We we we
[1:24:36] find ourselves you get into a place of
[1:24:38] hungry sometimes. You know when people
[1:24:40] are hungry, right? They're hungry.
[1:24:45] Like get out of their way. Don't don't
[1:24:47] put your fingers near them.
[1:24:50] Why? There's a there's a thirst. There's
[1:24:51] a call for that. You know, Jesus said,
[1:24:53] "Blessed are they that do hunger and
[1:24:55] thirst after righteousness, for they
[1:24:58] shall be filled." Hallelujah.
[1:25:02] You see, there's a desire that that
[1:25:05] desire within you and you want to know
[1:25:07] what kind of life, where am I standing
[1:25:09] at right now. You can tell where you're
[1:25:11] standing by. What kind of a what kind of
[1:25:14] a desire is controlling you? What's your
[1:25:16] desire for? That's so good. That lets
[1:25:19] you know what what's your what's the
[1:25:21] ultimate desire? Is it this this this
[1:25:24] and then God? Or is it God? And then
[1:25:27] you'll find out a lot of these other
[1:25:29] things, they won't even matter anymore
[1:25:30] because the nature of God won't even
[1:25:32] won't even cooperate with those things.
[1:25:35] That is so good. Now, watch this. When
[1:25:38] you when you can see what your desires
[1:25:41] are, you can tell what kind of a
[1:25:43] something that's in you that's creating
[1:25:45] this desire you have. There's a certain
[1:25:47] thing that you thirst for. It can tell
[1:25:49] you in your soul what this desire is by
[1:25:52] the nature of the thirst you have. Now,
[1:25:55] watch this. There is a control tower of
[1:25:58] the soul and one for the body. And each
[1:26:02] tower is a warning caller for the needs
[1:26:05] of the other. Each one calls to the need
[1:26:08] for what the caller is calling for, it
[1:26:10] sends out a wave of mourning. So in
[1:26:13] other words, when the soul is crying out
[1:26:15] for more of God, then that other out
[1:26:19] there, that other control child say just
[1:26:21] just just wait.
[1:26:24] There'll be another service. There'll be
[1:26:26] another time. You don't have to it it
[1:26:29] ain't you don't have it ain't that
[1:26:31] important.
[1:26:33] See, you're it trying to silence that.
[1:26:35] It's a warning against it. But then that
[1:26:38] body that that that that nature that can
[1:26:41] want to pull for other things and that
[1:26:44] on the inside and says, "No, don't no
[1:26:46] let don't go that way. Give give your
[1:26:49] all to the Lord." And there's a war
[1:26:51] that's going on. That's right. Yes,
[1:26:53] there's a battle that that that works to
[1:26:55] ensue. And so the the inner man is
[1:26:58] trying to warn. You know, God put a
[1:27:00] buzzer inside of your life. You know,
[1:27:02] the Bible tells us in 1 Corinthians 11
[1:27:04] even about hair. It said, "Doth not
[1:27:07] nature itself teach us these things." I
[1:27:10] don't care who a person is. I don't care
[1:27:12] whether you were raised in church or
[1:27:14] not. You know that even when as a little
[1:27:16] person, you could have went to light up
[1:27:18] a cigarette and you knew you were wrong.
[1:27:21] Yeah. Very true. When you told even your
[1:27:24] first lie, you know.
[1:27:27] I'm going to ask you what is that?
[1:27:29] That's called a conscience in your
[1:27:31] spirit. Man, that's right. Is that
[1:27:34] right? And it's God warning us. It's God
[1:27:37] warning us. You know, there is a reality
[1:27:40] that a person can actually silence that
[1:27:42] voice.
[1:27:44] Absolutely. Yes, you can. You can
[1:27:47] silence that conscience that God has
[1:27:48] given a person. Don't go that way. Don't
[1:27:51] go with those people, you know, don't
[1:27:52] get entangled with them. No doubt
[1:27:54] there's individuals sitting in here
[1:27:56] right now that because of that within
[1:27:58] just your life that God had given you,
[1:28:01] it ain't even the Holy Spirit yet in
[1:28:03] your life. But the conscience that God
[1:28:05] gave you and you realize, I I'm not
[1:28:07] going to go. These might be my friends,
[1:28:08] but I'm not going this way. What was it?
[1:28:10] A warning. Amen. A warning. God provided
[1:28:14] that before either any of us ever were
[1:28:18] were brought to a place to serving. God
[1:28:20] provided that. I I I need to I I don't
[1:28:22] need to be with these friends. I I don't
[1:28:24] need to go this way. That's God
[1:28:26] providing. Amen. Is that right? And you
[1:28:29] find out later on, you know, like some
[1:28:32] of the times here they are maybe that
[1:28:33] your friends, those that you should have
[1:28:35] been with that night, here they were.
[1:28:36] They ended up in some sort of a big mess
[1:28:39] out somewhere else. It was God in his
[1:28:41] grace that had provided that to you.
[1:28:44] That's right.
[1:28:46] But you know, you can send that
[1:28:47] conscience away.
[1:28:50] The Bible tells us in Timothy, their
[1:28:52] conscience had been seared with a hot
[1:28:55] iron.
[1:28:58] The B tells us about that Sunday school
[1:28:59] teacher. Remember, she was told what she
[1:29:02] was doing was wrong. All right. Here she
[1:29:05] was, you know, things begin to happen in
[1:29:07] the neighborhood and all of a sudden
[1:29:09] here, you know, she begin to flirt with
[1:29:11] the man next door, right? Still a Sunday
[1:29:14] school teacher. She begins to flirt with
[1:29:16] this man and everything else. Didn't
[1:29:18] have enough sense. If he was doing that
[1:29:19] on his wife, she'd just become, "Get in
[1:29:21] line. You're the next one." That's
[1:29:23] right. But you see, it's not human
[1:29:25] thinking that that's a spirit.
[1:29:29] It's a spirit. And Satan is all about
[1:29:32] trying to destroy and wreck lives and
[1:29:35] get them into a place where they don't
[1:29:36] even feel like I'm not worth anything.
[1:29:38] But let me tell you, the blood of Jesus
[1:29:41] Christ is greater than your sins. There
[1:29:45] is no sin too great. There's no
[1:29:47] situation irredeemable.
[1:29:50] [Applause]
[1:29:51] Hallelujah. All the way through the
[1:29:53] scriptures, you read of it. Rahab
[1:29:56] herself, what a situation she was in.
[1:29:59] God allowed it to be described even in
[1:30:01] the New Testament for the grace of God
[1:30:03] to you and I. Rehea the harlot, he
[1:30:06] allowed that to be expressed. Why? You
[1:30:09] and I could see that though she was on
[1:30:11] those walls, she couldn't get out of
[1:30:13] those walls. So God came
[1:30:17] and he tore the walls down. Hallelujah.
[1:30:21] Hallelujah.
[1:30:23] There's no condition that's too great.
[1:30:26] Amen.
[1:30:28] Hallelujah.
[1:30:30] Hallelujah.
[1:30:35] But that conscience
[1:30:38] now I want you to watch this. The Brown
[1:30:41] says for instance the flesh thirsts to
[1:30:43] satisfy the desires that's in the body
[1:30:46] and the spirit desires for the things
[1:30:48] that's in the soul. Desire is and many
[1:30:51] time these war against the other. And we
[1:30:54] find that's what's a great trouble
[1:30:56] today. Too many people try to live
[1:31:00] between those two desires.
[1:31:04] One of them desires the things of the
[1:31:06] earth and the other desires the things
[1:31:08] of heaven.
[1:31:10] That's the great trouble is trying to
[1:31:13] live between it and trying to satisfy
[1:31:17] it. And just just where we're at, you
[1:31:20] don't want to be a chameleon. No.
[1:31:23] blend in wherever you're at and then
[1:31:26] you're over here, you're blending in.
[1:31:28] Let me tell you, to live between is a
[1:31:30] great state of miserableness
[1:31:34] because you have no assurance.
[1:31:37] There there is no divine assurance. But
[1:31:40] so many try to live between. Let me just
[1:31:42] bring this on down to you. There's many.
[1:31:45] Sometimes we can get drawn out into
[1:31:47] this, friends, even spiritfilled
[1:31:49] believers to living between these
[1:31:52] things.
[1:31:54] We can become brought down from the
[1:31:56] heavenlies into the earthlings.
[1:32:00] And here we are between these things.
[1:32:02] And you know what? To a real eagle, this
[1:32:04] does not feel right.
[1:32:06] It doesn't feel right. We're we're
[1:32:08] Because remember, the flesh lusteth
[1:32:10] against the spirit and the spirit
[1:32:12] against the flesh. It is not a place for
[1:32:15] a conducive for a son of God to live.
[1:32:18] Amen. Listen to me. This is why that as
[1:32:21] a spiritfilled believer, this is why
[1:32:24] that you must recognize what God has
[1:32:28] done in your life and recognize your
[1:32:30] need to feed on his word. Because when
[1:32:35] you don't feed on his word and you don't
[1:32:37] give him first place in your life,
[1:32:39] listen, that don't take the Holy Spirit
[1:32:41] away from you. It don't take the nature
[1:32:43] of desire. But I'll tell you what'll
[1:32:44] happen is is that within your life and
[1:32:47] in your walk, you will become cast down.
[1:32:50] You will become distraught. You will
[1:32:52] become in a place of well, you know, I I
[1:32:54] I'm not I'm not very good and I'm not
[1:32:56] very victorious. Who told you those kind
[1:32:58] of things? You see what it is? It's
[1:33:01] where you're living. You can't live
[1:33:04] between them. As a son of God, you were
[1:33:07] meant to live from the soul realm. Amen.
[1:33:12] That's where you live victorious. That's
[1:33:14] where you bring the rest of your life in
[1:33:16] subjection to the word of God. This is
[1:33:19] why Paul said, "I find a law. When I
[1:33:21] would go to do good, evil is present."
[1:33:24] Right. How many in our lives, how many
[1:33:26] of us, you go to do something, you go to
[1:33:29] move on with God and you find evil right
[1:33:31] there to try to upset it, right? You go
[1:33:34] to make a big step. I tell you what, you
[1:33:36] know what? We're going to we're going to
[1:33:37] start really pressing in there and and
[1:33:39] we're going to be here on this day.
[1:33:40] We're going to as soon as you make that
[1:33:42] declaration, you evil is going to be
[1:33:44] there. That's right. There's going to be
[1:33:46] things to try to hinder you from and get
[1:33:50] between you and God. Amen. That's what
[1:33:53] Satan wants to do. What do you call it?
[1:33:55] When the when the world when the earth
[1:33:57] gets between that of the earth and the
[1:34:00] sun, right, an eclipse,
[1:34:03] it's where light is blocked out. And
[1:34:06] that's what Satan is in the business of
[1:34:08] doing is trying to get a wedge between
[1:34:11] you and your fellowship with God. Let me
[1:34:15] tell you friends, no matter where we
[1:34:16] stand at here this morning, every one of
[1:34:19] us need a deeper fellowship with God.
[1:34:23] And if you don't feel that way,
[1:34:25] something's wrong. I I'm I'm just
[1:34:28] speaking from my heart this morning. May
[1:34:30] God allow us to pinch ourselves. Let him
[1:34:34] that standeth take heed lest he fall.
[1:34:37] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:34:40] Oh my. That's why the prophet said, you
[1:34:43] know, I'd like to say it as Christians,
[1:34:45] you know, that you might know when
[1:34:46] you're starting to do something and
[1:34:48] everything turns against you. Oh my.
[1:34:51] Right.
[1:34:53] Sometimes how Satan will work upon how a
[1:34:55] person is made up. They're maybe they're
[1:34:57] they're made up just to be a little
[1:34:59] nervous. And here they are. they they
[1:35:01] begin to get on their heart to seek
[1:35:03] after things of God. And you know what?
[1:35:06] The devil is right there to try to keep
[1:35:08] them from it. And because he'll get on
[1:35:10] that spot and they get all nervous,
[1:35:13] he wants to let them know this is what
[1:35:15] Satan will do. Well, it's not for you.
[1:35:19] But what Satan was doing was getting on
[1:35:21] the nerves on that natural body. Are you
[1:35:25] hearing me? But you see, but don't let
[1:35:28] the devil lie to you like that. Find out
[1:35:31] if it's God's will for your life. When
[1:35:34] you look in the Bible, look in to the
[1:35:36] will for God's will in your life. Like
[1:35:38] the prophet takes it like this. He said,
[1:35:40] for somebody seeking the baptism of the
[1:35:43] Holy Ghost. Many times will people say,
[1:35:45] "Well, I sought for the Holy Ghost and I
[1:35:47] just couldn't receive it. I don't
[1:35:48] believe it's for me. Every time I get
[1:35:50] down, I get sick. I go to praying. If I
[1:35:52] fast, I get sick. If I try to stay all
[1:35:55] night, stay up, I get sleepy, I can't
[1:35:57] get off my free. Remember that is the
[1:35:59] devil because God intends for you to
[1:36:03] have the Holy Spirit. It's for whosoever
[1:36:06] will.
[1:36:08] God intends for that. He made a way.
[1:36:11] That's what Calvary made a way for. When
[1:36:14] you're prayed for for divine healing,
[1:36:16] let me read this. When you're prayed for
[1:36:17] for divine healing, the next day you
[1:36:20] find out, no doubt, the devil will make
[1:36:22] that twice as bad as it was the day
[1:36:24] before. Remember, that's just Satan
[1:36:27] trying to get you away from the blessing
[1:36:29] that God has got for you. Don't listen
[1:36:32] to that fellow. Always press right on.
[1:36:38] See, try look at it. He's a false
[1:36:39] interpreter.
[1:36:42] Amen. Oh, you didn't receive nothing.
[1:36:45] It's not for you. No. No, God made the
[1:36:47] promise for me. That's right. God made
[1:36:50] the promise. If it wasn't nobody else
[1:36:52] upon this earth, he made the promise for
[1:36:53] me. If it wouldn't been nobody else, he
[1:36:56] came all the way from glory. He shed his
[1:36:58] blood. He rose upon that Easter morning
[1:37:01] and sent back the Holy Ghost and sent
[1:37:03] this message for me. Amen. To let me
[1:37:07] know that I was in his mind before the
[1:37:09] foundation of the world. I was there. My
[1:37:12] name was on the book. my name. He saw me
[1:37:15] there when the lamb was slain in the
[1:37:17] mind of God before the foundation of the
[1:37:19] world. That's how real it becomes in
[1:37:22] your life that if it was for nobody
[1:37:24] else, if nobody else goes in the
[1:37:26] rapture, I'm going
[1:37:31] You ought to have that same kind of
[1:37:32] attitude on your job. If nobody else is
[1:37:34] going to have joy today, I am.
[1:37:36] Hallelujah.
[1:37:39] If nobody else
[1:37:42] in my home, I am.
[1:37:44] Amen.
[1:37:46] Hallelujah. Change the atmosphere.
[1:37:48] That's right. Come on, sons and
[1:37:50] daughters of God. Amateur creators. How
[1:37:52] are you an amateur creator? By the life
[1:37:54] that's on the inside of you. Amen. Don't
[1:37:57] live between. to stand right over here
[1:37:59] and say, "I'm going to take my God-given
[1:38:01] right as a son or a daughter of God and
[1:38:04] change the atmosphere." Amen. And when I
[1:38:08] talk about changing the atmosphere, it
[1:38:10] ain't about you going out there and
[1:38:11] rebuking everybody. It's about you
[1:38:13] beginning just to think about the
[1:38:15] goodness of God and worshiping him and
[1:38:18] invite him.
[1:38:20] Amen. And let me tell you something, God
[1:38:22] ain't ashamed to come down and walk in
[1:38:24] Walmart with you. That's right.
[1:38:27] There's grocery stores maybe you
[1:38:28] wouldn't want to go in, but let me tell
[1:38:29] you, if you're in there as a believer,
[1:38:31] God will come right down there.
[1:38:35] Come on, friends.
[1:38:37] When that situation was over there in
[1:38:38] Toledo at that cafeteria and the prophet
[1:38:40] of God walked in there and that slot
[1:38:42] machine, all that you you and I would
[1:38:44] look at and say, "That's not a conducive
[1:38:46] atmosphere." But there was a daughter of
[1:38:48] God right there. She was in a bad
[1:38:52] situation. One time a Sunday school
[1:38:54] teacher, one time a real devout child of
[1:38:57] God, but things had had gotten wrong in
[1:39:00] her life. But here the Holy Spirit never
[1:39:03] lost sight of her.
[1:39:08] See, she hadn't went all the way with
[1:39:10] God, but God would came looking for her.
[1:39:13] Can't you see how determined God is? God
[1:39:16] don't let you get out of his sight.
[1:39:20] You might have got cold. You might have
[1:39:21] got indifferent. You might be able to
[1:39:23] stand and say, "Man, I've been right
[1:39:25] there. I've lived between those like
[1:39:27] that. I've been here for a while, then
[1:39:28] been over here for a while, but I know
[1:39:30] what the grace of God is that has chased
[1:39:33] after my life." David said, "Surely
[1:39:36] goodness and mercy shall follow me all
[1:39:39] the days of my life, and I will dwell in
[1:39:42] the house of the Lord forever."
[1:39:45] There ain't nobody here can say, "I did
[1:39:47] this. I brought myself. I did this." It
[1:39:50] was not of our works. Amen. Amen. It's
[1:39:54] not of works, lest any man should boast.
[1:39:58] We are saved by the grace of God.
[1:40:03] Hallelujah.
[1:40:05] You get converted, everybody gets angry
[1:40:07] with you.
[1:40:10] That's right. The prophet said like
[1:40:12] this. He said, "Tomorrow, mother will be
[1:40:14] more angry than she ever was. Dad will
[1:40:17] be all upset, the school kids, and
[1:40:19] everything else goes wrong because it's
[1:40:21] Satan trying to get you to turn around.
[1:40:23] He's trying to run you off the path.
[1:40:27] So, let me just tell you, you need to
[1:40:28] just square your shoulders and you need
[1:40:30] to look that lying devil right in the
[1:40:32] face and say, "I'm not going to live
[1:40:34] between these desires no more." Amen.
[1:40:37] That's true. I'm not going to try to
[1:40:39] live and try I I I'm tell you what, I'm
[1:40:42] on the Lord's side.
[1:40:44] I'm going to take my side with God.
[1:40:48] That's where I'm going to stand.
[1:40:51] Amen. Oh my. Just like here in the
[1:40:55] scripture where Paul would would speak
[1:40:57] of. Let me just I'm trying to get here
[1:40:59] into this place. Let me just try to
[1:41:01] bring it down here. Paul came to that
[1:41:03] place in Philippians. You can read it
[1:41:05] when you get home in Philippians 3 and
[1:41:07] 7-16. And he would say, "What things
[1:41:09] were gained to me? Those have I counted
[1:41:12] lost for Christ. So it came to a place.
[1:41:14] These are not scriptures that would just
[1:41:16] oh that was when Paul was back in Sunday
[1:41:18] school. No, this is when Paul had come
[1:41:21] even to a greater maturity in his life
[1:41:24] where he could look and say this is
[1:41:27] advantage Paul
[1:41:30] disadvantage Christ.
[1:41:34] You see it gets to a place to a
[1:41:36] believer. Look, the black and white is
[1:41:40] obvious to you as a believer. White
[1:41:43] meaning what's right, black meaning
[1:41:45] what's wrong. White and black that that
[1:41:47] those are easy things, but it's the gray
[1:41:50] areas.
[1:41:52] That's true. It's the gray areas where
[1:41:53] you don't have maybe a scripture
[1:41:56] or you don't have a quote, you can't see
[1:41:58] it just outright,
[1:42:00] right? Those are the times where what
[1:42:02] this is what you have to rely on. You
[1:42:04] have to rely on your relationship with
[1:42:07] God.
[1:42:10] Amen. That's what you have to rely on.
[1:42:12] And you know, God God has a way of
[1:42:15] teaching us and tutoring us and training
[1:42:18] us so that if we're really sensitive to
[1:42:20] him, we know the things that are
[1:42:23] advantage Samuel, disadvantage Christ.
[1:42:27] Advantage Christ, disadvantage Sam. And
[1:42:30] listen, we're living in an anointed age
[1:42:32] that's all about self.
[1:42:35] The Bible said in Timothy, peerless
[1:42:37] times will come. The first thing it
[1:42:39] mentions, men will be lovers of
[1:42:40] themselves.
[1:42:42] Right? I've told you this before. Never
[1:42:44] in any other age do you hear the term
[1:42:46] selfie. Everything self. Do you, do me,
[1:42:49] do this, do that. You think those things
[1:42:52] are not, it's just not just coincidence.
[1:42:54] But we're living, we're living in a time
[1:42:55] that's all about self. Right. Every
[1:42:58] decision that's made, it's about self,
[1:43:01] right? Right. It's all about what what
[1:43:04] can it do for me?
[1:43:06] That's true. But see, that's what
[1:43:08] listen, that's what the Holy Spirit
[1:43:09] comes to relieve us of our selfishness.
[1:43:13] It draws us to a place to first of all
[1:43:16] surrender our lives to him and then take
[1:43:19] up the cross daily and die to self
[1:43:24] daily. How long we going to keep on
[1:43:26] dying? Until these bodies are changed.
[1:43:30] [Music]
[1:43:31] Until these bodies are changed.
[1:43:34] Let me remind you when God came down in
[1:43:37] flesh and visited Abraham's tent and
[1:43:39] Genesis 18, Abraham and Sarah had just
[1:43:41] had a fuss that morning.
[1:43:45] That's right. Ain't that right? But see,
[1:43:48] God came down on the scene. God was
[1:43:50] coming anyhow. However, that that was
[1:43:52] all repaired, all fixed up. I I love the
[1:43:54] prophet including those dramatization.
[1:43:56] You know why? It takes us from putting
[1:43:58] men up here as far as their humanity. I
[1:44:01] recognize that Abraham was God's
[1:44:03] prophet. Ain't that right? I recognize
[1:44:05] that in the scripture. I recognize that
[1:44:07] Abraham, father of faith. I recognize
[1:44:09] that. But God never highlighted
[1:44:11] Abraham's faith or his his humanity. He
[1:44:14] never highlighted the humanity of any
[1:44:17] other man. And as a matter of fact, he
[1:44:19] let us see the humanity of these men
[1:44:22] subject unto like passions such as we
[1:44:25] are. But what was it that was
[1:44:27] highlighted? God in them. Amen. So you
[1:44:31] and I would be able to look and take
[1:44:33] hope for the God that's in us.
[1:44:37] Hallelujah.
[1:44:39] What things
[1:44:41] I count not myself, Paul said, to have
[1:44:43] apprehended, but this one thing I do,
[1:44:45] forgetting those things which are
[1:44:47] behind, and reaching forth unto those
[1:44:49] things which are before me. I press
[1:44:51] toward the mark for the prize of the
[1:44:53] high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Let
[1:44:57] us therefore, as many as be perfect, be
[1:45:00] thus minded.
[1:45:03] Now, think of this. You can never get
[1:45:05] anywhere if you're still chained to your
[1:45:07] past. Amen.
[1:45:10] You You can't.
[1:45:13] But this is where this is what the blood
[1:45:15] of Jesus Christ comes to do. It comes to
[1:45:18] relieve you of your past. That's what
[1:45:22] the spirit of God comes to do in your
[1:45:24] life. It comes to relieve you of your
[1:45:27] past. It isn't doesn't it isn't coming
[1:45:29] out to say, "Oh, you weren't guilty. Oh,
[1:45:31] it was just I'll tell you if your mom
[1:45:33] and dad or if this hadn't been No, no,
[1:45:34] no, no. It brings us to that place of
[1:45:36] realization when we can recognize oursel
[1:45:40] as wrong but come to that place by the
[1:45:43] spirit of God coming into our life that
[1:45:45] I am free. I have truly been forgiven.
[1:45:50] Hallelujah. Now you'll have it in your
[1:45:53] listen listen. You'll have it in your
[1:45:55] memory. Sure. That's right. In the gate
[1:45:58] of memory that's in your spirit realm.
[1:46:00] You are flesh, spirit, and body. in that
[1:46:03] gate of the spirit called memory.
[1:46:04] There's a lot of memory. Some of you
[1:46:06] right now and I maybe could put up a
[1:46:07] picture and it reminds you something
[1:46:09] from your childhood where that's in the
[1:46:10] gate of memory in your human spirit.
[1:46:14] Right? But you see within that gate
[1:46:17] there's a lot of memories. There's a lot
[1:46:18] of memories that we look at and say,
[1:46:19] "Man, I don't want to go down that
[1:46:21] particular hallway. I don't want to go
[1:46:23] down that way." But listen, listen,
[1:46:24] listen. When you can recognize from the
[1:46:27] desire from within that that hallway and
[1:46:30] where I used to be that I am no longer
[1:46:33] there anymore. God's grace has come into
[1:46:36] my life. I have been freed from that.
[1:46:39] Oh, brother Samuel, you don't know how
[1:46:41] dark my hallway is. And I don't need to
[1:46:43] know how dark it is. But listen, the
[1:46:46] Lord Jesus Christ went to the lowest
[1:46:48] part of hell and he deposited the sin
[1:46:52] debt of the whole world and he rose up
[1:46:55] on that Easter morning and he sent the
[1:46:57] gospel to your life to let you know that
[1:47:00] there's no situation too great.
[1:47:04] [Music]
[1:47:05] And God will take your life where others
[1:47:07] wrote off.
[1:47:09] Others said, "Oh, nothing about that
[1:47:11] life." And God will take your life and
[1:47:13] your life will be a trophy of overcoming
[1:47:15] grace
[1:47:17] forgetting those things that are behind
[1:47:20] because the blood of Jesus Christ, the
[1:47:22] spirit of God gives you permission to
[1:47:24] forget them.
[1:47:27] I'm going to preach here now. This is
[1:47:29] coming.
[1:47:33] How many remember the woman of Zerapath?
[1:47:34] Right. Yeah. The woman of Zerapath here
[1:47:38] she came and God raised up her son or by
[1:47:43] because of the the meal barrel and the
[1:47:45] oil cruise. Right. They were ready to
[1:47:46] die. Is that right? And here she was.
[1:47:49] She she obeyed the word of God and a
[1:47:51] miracle came to where her and her son
[1:47:54] was sustained from then on. True. Right.
[1:47:58] But then there came a day that her son
[1:48:00] died. Come on, somebody help me. Stay
[1:48:03] right with me now. Her son died and and
[1:48:07] watch the devil got on her shoulder. She
[1:48:09] looked at Elijah and said, "Are you come
[1:48:12] to call my sins into remembrance?" Is
[1:48:16] that why God took my son because of my
[1:48:19] sins?
[1:48:22] But you see the spirit of God in that
[1:48:25] particular scripture right there. God
[1:48:27] took that child through Elijah and took
[1:48:30] it in the prophet's chamber and God
[1:48:32] showed her by raising her child that
[1:48:35] what you thought was against you, all of
[1:48:37] your sins have been removed. Hallelujah.
[1:48:41] That was the third pull of the word in
[1:48:44] action in her life because she said,
[1:48:47] "Now I know that the word of God is in
[1:48:51] thy mouth."
[1:48:53] Hallelujah.
[1:48:55] Boy, I tell you right now,
[1:48:59] hallelujah.
[1:49:00] [Music]
[1:49:01] You ought to put that devil under foot
[1:49:03] right now.
[1:49:05] I got beside myself and over months and
[1:49:08] months and looking at that, didn't know
[1:49:09] whenever that's going to come out, but
[1:49:11] it came out fresh right now. I tell you
[1:49:13] right now, I tell you, God, listen to
[1:49:15] me. God never sent a message to bring up
[1:49:18] and dig up your past. God sent a message
[1:49:21] that your past could be dealt with and
[1:49:24] put under the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:49:29] Oh, this situation, it happened to me.
[1:49:31] Don't let the devil try to interpret it.
[1:49:33] Let God interpret it. Look where the
[1:49:36] desire of your heart and your life and
[1:49:39] look what God is saying to your life.
[1:49:44] Hallelujah.
[1:49:46] Praise the Lord.
[1:49:51] How many know that tension's a blessing?
[1:49:56] You probably think, "Wait a minute, man.
[1:49:59] What in the world is this guy?"
[1:50:02] But, you know, I don't know for sure cuz
[1:50:05] I don't look underneath these newer
[1:50:06] automobiles. I think they got belts. I
[1:50:10] don't know. Some of these engines they
[1:50:12] got nowadays, I don't know if they took
[1:50:14] them out of mopeds and put them in cars
[1:50:15] or what, but we won't go there. But, you
[1:50:19] know, you have to have a belt upon those
[1:50:22] pulleys on that engine. And that belt
[1:50:25] has attention. You and I just can't put
[1:50:26] that belt on me if you have certain
[1:50:28] tools and you're you're you know, you're
[1:50:29] able to do that. You can, but you just
[1:50:31] can't go and snap it on. It has to have
[1:50:34] a tension about it. And if that belt
[1:50:37] happens to break or maybe one of your
[1:50:38] pulleys happen to break, you're not
[1:50:41] going anywhere. Ain't that right? So
[1:50:44] without that tension in the engine, you
[1:50:47] don't go nowhere. That's right. And when
[1:50:50] you understand it was a tension in your
[1:50:52] life and in my life even before becoming
[1:50:55] a Christian, that's what really drove us
[1:50:57] to Christ. Yeah. What caused you to
[1:50:59] start to think and to wonder? Wonder
[1:51:02] wonder why I'm here? Wonder where I
[1:51:05] should be? Why? Why is it? What's What
[1:51:06] is it that's different about me? I mean,
[1:51:08] wonderful people all around, but what is
[1:51:09] this? What what's what's it's a tension?
[1:51:12] It's something you couldn't get settled.
[1:51:14] And then when God comes into your life,
[1:51:17] it's a constant reflection in your life.
[1:51:20] Lord, am I pleasing to you? You see, as
[1:51:22] a Christian, we don't relieve tension by
[1:51:25] becoming a Christian. Is that right?
[1:51:27] Brother Ram said many times they'll tell
[1:51:29] people, "Oh, you're free from worry."
[1:51:30] That ain't true. You still do. You're
[1:51:32] concerned about what? the things of God.
[1:51:35] And it isn't sometimes, yes, we can get
[1:51:37] a doctor's report, things can come our
[1:51:39] way. Oh my. And when that doctor's
[1:51:41] report comes and we're reading it, you
[1:51:43] know what happens? The enemy wants to
[1:51:44] pull us out to live between those two
[1:51:46] desires and we start to try to start
[1:51:49] looking at it. And then all of a sudden,
[1:51:50] we get on Dr. Google and Dr. Google has
[1:51:53] all the synopsis and everything else. If
[1:51:55] you're feeling this way, oh yeah, I I
[1:51:57] think I am. And and and all these other
[1:51:59] things around us. And you see, the more
[1:52:01] that we read that, I'm not talking to
[1:52:03] ignore things and be ignorant. I'm
[1:52:05] talking about the more that we give
[1:52:06] ourselves to it, the more that we find
[1:52:08] ourselves being pulled toward that
[1:52:10] other.
[1:52:12] And the only place there is of real
[1:52:14] victory through it all is to abide in
[1:52:16] his presence and say, "Lord, I commit
[1:52:19] this unto you." And I know that's
[1:52:22] sometimes sometimes as far as in
[1:52:23] ourselves. It's not something that's so
[1:52:25] easily done. And yet we can go to the
[1:52:28] Lord and say, "Father, help me, Lord.
[1:52:31] Lord, to lay this request, Lord, before
[1:52:33] you. I trust you, Lord. I'm looking to
[1:52:36] you, Father." So, there is a blessing.
[1:52:39] Tension itself is a blessing because
[1:52:41] we're constantly in that place. Am I
[1:52:43] pleasing to you, Lord? Now, let me say
[1:52:45] this to you. That's something when the
[1:52:47] spirit of God as he moves into your
[1:52:48] life, Lord, am I pleasing you? Am I am I
[1:52:52] pleasing you, Lord, today? Is my walk
[1:52:55] pleasing you? Not just something we just
[1:52:57] take for granted. Listen friends, the
[1:52:59] rapture itself, let me just say this.
[1:53:01] The rapture itself is not going to be
[1:53:03] because of all of our good works.
[1:53:07] Do you understand that? The rapture
[1:53:08] itself and listen, the reason that we
[1:53:10] are part of the rapture because our
[1:53:12] name's on the lamb's book of life.
[1:53:16] Because some of the ways and times that
[1:53:17] we've got slothful and lazy and
[1:53:19] sometimes indifferent and all of these
[1:53:21] things and got between them desires, you
[1:53:23] know what? God could just man alive.
[1:53:26] These people, I'm telling you, after all
[1:53:27] that I've done for them and they're now
[1:53:30] right back into this place,
[1:53:33] you know why? You know, when it all
[1:53:34] comes down to it, you and I will not
[1:53:36] stand there on that day and say, "Lord,
[1:53:37] it's because I did this and Lord, it's
[1:53:38] because I did that." It will be by the
[1:53:40] grace of Almighty God.
[1:53:43] And it's the same grace that works upon
[1:53:45] our life right now as we're maturing in
[1:53:47] the Lord. It brings us into that place,
[1:53:49] Lord, am I pleasing to you? Is my life
[1:53:52] pleasing to you? I mean, you think about
[1:53:54] you think about even interactions you've
[1:53:55] had maybe on the job. Did I did I say
[1:53:57] that in the right way? Did I did I
[1:53:58] approach that way even with my wife or
[1:54:00] with my children? Did I say it in the
[1:54:01] right way? Did I did I approach that
[1:54:02] with that brother, that sister? You
[1:54:04] begin to reflect because we recognize no
[1:54:06] matter who a person is, that is a soul
[1:54:10] and I want to please you, Lord.
[1:54:17] Praise the Lord. No wonder Paul said,
[1:54:19] "They that sleep, they sleep in the
[1:54:23] night."
[1:54:25] But let's be sober and watch. We're
[1:54:29] living in an hour
[1:54:31] where people don't even have to be
[1:54:32] drinkers and could be drunk.
[1:54:36] Now, I'm not talking about drunk on just
[1:54:38] natural alcohol. I'm talking about drunk
[1:54:41] on the cares of life.
[1:54:44] Can become drunk on fashions.
[1:54:47] drunk on media, drunk. Look, the Bible
[1:54:51] tells us that that she has a cup
[1:54:55] of fornications,
[1:54:57] and all of those who sip on that cup.
[1:54:58] When you understand what that's saying
[1:55:00] in the book of Revelations, go back to
[1:55:01] the book of Proverbs, that every harlot
[1:55:03] would have a special mixture to where
[1:55:06] her mixture would separate her from
[1:55:08] other harlots. to where when they would
[1:55:11] take that cup before going into that
[1:55:13] harlot, they would take of that cup and
[1:55:15] it would so invigorate them, but it was
[1:55:18] to stand out by the mixture from others.
[1:55:22] Her special mixture would cause hers to
[1:55:25] stand out. Let me tell you, the Bible
[1:55:27] says that concerning that church that
[1:55:29] looks so holy and crosses everywhere and
[1:55:32] everything. But remember, she has a cup
[1:55:34] and that cup says you can be whatever
[1:55:37] you want to be, do whatever you want to
[1:55:38] do. Jesus loves you.
[1:55:41] It's all right. We're all going to
[1:55:42] heaven. Everything's all No, no, no.
[1:55:44] There is a provided way. The blood of
[1:55:46] Jesus Christ made a way for you and I
[1:55:49] that where we do not have to live in
[1:55:52] sin, we can live above it. And that's
[1:55:56] why we don't want that cup of
[1:55:57] fornication. We want the cup of
[1:55:58] salvation. David said, "I will take the
[1:56:01] cup of salvation. I will take of his
[1:56:04] life." Amen.
[1:56:07] You love him. Amen.
[1:56:09] Let me read this to you and I'll close
[1:56:11] here. Promise
[1:56:16] said like this. He says, "Oh God," he
[1:56:18] said, "I'm happy this morning that thy
[1:56:20] redeeming grace, thy son has redeemed us
[1:56:24] from a life of sin. And when I seen my
[1:56:26] own body withering away, getting old,
[1:56:27] turning gray, wrinkling up, yet I know
[1:56:29] that beyond this shadow here, yonder
[1:56:31] lays the body not made with hands.
[1:56:34] Yonder lays that immortal one waiting.
[1:56:36] and that someday when life is pulled
[1:56:38] from this body, I'll awake a new in his
[1:56:41] presence yonder to be with him through
[1:56:43] the ages to come. God, let every man and
[1:56:47] woman this morning that has this hope in
[1:56:50] them purify themselves from the things
[1:56:54] of the world and these little old petty
[1:56:57] things that would drag them down and
[1:57:00] keep them miserable. Amen. Let them be
[1:57:03] happy Christians serving thee. Grant it
[1:57:05] father through Jesus name thy son.
[1:57:09] I say amen. Amen. Amen. You see the
[1:57:13] grace of God moving down for our lives.
[1:57:16] Lord grant to us to lay aside these
[1:57:20] things
[1:57:21] as the spirit of God just moves right
[1:57:23] through our lives. Let's stand. Deals
[1:57:25] with our hearts. Causes us to reflect.
[1:57:28] Causes us to examine our lives. Listen
[1:57:30] friends. I don't want I don't want to go
[1:57:32] I don't want to go into a place I I
[1:57:33] wouldn't want to be a part of of a
[1:57:35] church or something where there's no
[1:57:37] reflection. I I don't want to just be
[1:57:38] patted on the back, right? I don't want
[1:57:40] to be patted on the back because listen,
[1:57:42] on the day of judgment, there's going to
[1:57:43] be a lot of disappointed people. As a
[1:57:46] matter of fact, there'll be those
[1:57:47] standing on the white throne in judgment
[1:57:48] and say, "How in the world did I get
[1:57:49] here?
[1:57:52] How in the world did I get here? I
[1:57:54] thought
[1:57:56] there'll be a lot of I thoughts." You
[1:57:58] see, but God, listen, God is not in the
[1:58:00] business of shaming us. He's not in the
[1:58:02] business of putting us down. He's not in
[1:58:04] the business of condemning us. God's in
[1:58:06] the business of saving us. God's in the
[1:58:09] business of ministering his word and his
[1:58:11] grace to our lives. You know what? God
[1:58:12] wants to see himself reflected in you or
[1:58:15] me.
[1:58:18] I want to go all the way, Lord. I want
[1:58:21] to go all the way.
[1:58:23] If I don't want to just live between two
[1:58:25] desires. I don't want to try to satisfy
[1:58:27] two things. I don't want to plurge.
[1:58:29] Listen, friends, if there's one thing we
[1:58:30] we should do. Listen, listen. Every one
[1:58:33] of us have been there, maybe. And
[1:58:34] there's other things some of us how
[1:58:35] we're natured. Man, maybe you get into
[1:58:37] building a project and man, you you get
[1:58:40] right into that project.
[1:58:42] And you know, God's made us the ways
[1:58:44] that we are. And you're not going to
[1:58:46] strip that out as far as how that you're
[1:58:48] made to give yourself and be so
[1:58:50] channeled towards something.
[1:58:53] But you know, don't ever let the natural
[1:58:55] things of this life become the first
[1:58:58] priority of your mind and your
[1:59:01] meditation.
[1:59:02] Let everything be placed underneath him.
[1:59:06] H how do how do I relieve how do how do
[1:59:08] I how do how do I relieve things in my
[1:59:11] life? Just get into him. Just get more
[1:59:13] into him. Like that I told you about
[1:59:15] those ice cubes coming in a cup of
[1:59:17] water. Just just let more get more of
[1:59:19] God in your life. just lay in his
[1:59:22] presence and taking more in. Just listen
[1:59:24] friends, uh anointing and being in the
[1:59:26] presence of God is a wonderful thing,
[1:59:27] but you need to feed on the word of God.
[1:59:30] The things even that after we've left
[1:59:32] right here this morning, even if as we
[1:59:34] dismiss from here, listen, we're going
[1:59:36] to worship here in a few minutes and let
[1:59:37] the word just let it be watered in. But
[1:59:39] don't just let it stop right there.
[1:59:41] Because if you do, that's idolatry,
[1:59:44] right? If all we do is walk away from
[1:59:46] this service and man that was a good
[1:59:48] service and don't do nothing about it,
[1:59:51] don't pray, don't ask God, Lord, what
[1:59:54] you were saying today, Lord, I don't
[1:59:58] want to live between two desires. Amen.
[2:00:01] I want to live from that realm where a
[2:00:03] son and daughter of God is called to
[2:00:04] live. I don't I don't want to I don't
[2:00:07] want to be idle, Lord. I don't want to
[2:00:08] just stay in the same place. And Lord, I
[2:00:12] want I want a real reflection in my
[2:00:14] life. I don't want to just take of where
[2:00:16] I think I am.
[2:00:18] I don't want to do that. I want to see.
[2:00:20] Lord, show me. So, you see, after a
[2:00:22] service that's like this, it isn't just
[2:00:24] something that stops right here. Boom,
[2:00:26] boom, boom. Like microwave, like instant
[2:00:27] mashed potatoes. Ma, we leave out of
[2:00:30] here. No, this is a service. It
[2:00:32] continues to bring reflection in our
[2:00:34] life. It should. Amen. It should cause
[2:00:37] us to think very deeply in our lives.
[2:00:39] And let me just tell you something. The
[2:00:40] things that God can do right here in
[2:00:42] this service and what started, it's hard
[2:00:45] to tell. There are lives that could
[2:00:47] leave right out of here this morning.
[2:00:49] And even as you're going home, maybe
[2:00:50] through the week, the Holy Spirit will
[2:00:52] come down. And maybe there's lives
[2:00:54] that's never received the Holy Spirit.
[2:00:57] But right there, maybe in the moment of
[2:00:59] just a reflection in your life, and just
[2:01:01] in that surrender, the Holy Spirit will
[2:01:03] drop right down with such an assurance.
[2:01:05] Don't limit God to just these four
[2:01:08] walls. Amen. What God starts, you
[2:01:10] continue to give yourself to and say,
[2:01:12] "I'm not going to be an idol." I D L E.
[2:01:17] I'm going to go on, Lord. Amen. And no
[2:01:20] matter where you're at within your walk
[2:01:22] with God, Lord, I want to yield that you
[2:01:26] can grow. I want more of him. Amen.
[2:01:30] Let's pray.
[2:01:32] Lord Jesus,
[2:01:36] Lord, your ways are so much past us
[2:01:39] finding out.
[2:01:43] Father, you know that
[2:01:46] months and months ago, Lord,
[2:01:51] many months,
[2:01:54] this thought, Lord,
[2:01:57] the outline,
[2:01:59] you also know, Lord, how that you dealt
[2:02:01] with my heart
[2:02:04] as we've been looking at Ruth.
[2:02:08] Father, I just
[2:02:09] [Music]
[2:02:11] I know, Lord, that you're mindful of all
[2:02:13] of our needs,
[2:02:14] [Music]
[2:02:16] Lord Jesus, in everything we we want to
[2:02:19] do our very best, Lord, for you. We want
[2:02:22] to give, Lord God, of ourselves that you
[2:02:26] might be glorified. That Lord,
[2:02:29] our lives might be helped and
[2:02:30] encouraged.
[2:02:33] Lord, we see an hour of a great trouble.
[2:02:36] Oh yeah, there's trouble all around us.
[2:02:40] But Lord,
[2:02:42] the great trouble
[2:02:44] is trying to live between two desires.
[2:02:48] Lord, I pray right here this morning
[2:02:50] throughout this congregation. Lord,
[2:02:54] it's a moment, Lord, to really make a
[2:02:57] real decision
[2:02:58] in our lives.
[2:03:00] Every time the gospel is preached,
[2:03:04] there's a decision. And there's a choice
[2:03:05] to be made.
[2:03:08] Lord, I pray may Lord, as we take from
[2:03:11] this here this morning, may that
[2:03:13] decision, Lord God, may it resound from
[2:03:16] our heart. Lord,
[2:03:20] I'm not going to be idol.
[2:03:23] Lord, forgive me for being idol.
[2:03:28] Grant it, Lord. Yes. May you just Lord I
[2:03:31] pray as your grace is moving just right
[2:03:34] among us Lord as that last quote that I
[2:03:37] read there Lord
[2:03:39] Father as sons and daughters of God that
[2:03:41] have this hope within us to purify
[2:03:44] ourselves. That's what you said in 1
[2:03:46] John chapter 3. They that have them hold
[2:03:50] this hope within us purifyth themselves
[2:03:53] even as he is pure. Lord God, we're
[2:03:56] drawing from that pure source.
[2:03:59] Lord, I thank God of how everything
[2:04:01] around us, we see the world, we see the
[2:04:04] systems, we see the crumbling, Lord.
[2:04:08] God, we see such hatred and such
[2:04:11] vitriol.
[2:04:14] Oh, but Lord Jesus, we recognize, Lord,
[2:04:18] that this
[2:04:20] this world must pass away.
[2:04:23] the system that's upon the earth.
[2:04:27] We're not of this world, Lord God. We're
[2:04:30] in it, but not of it. I pray, Lord, if
[2:04:33] there's any here this morning that is
[2:04:35] still walking, Lord, under that, Lord,
[2:04:37] may they, Lord, lift up their head,
[2:04:40] Lord. Father, if there's any, Lord, and
[2:04:43] maybe the enemy, Lord, has wanted to get
[2:04:44] on their backs, Lord, for living between
[2:04:47] two desires, may they, Lord, raise up
[2:04:49] their hearts to you and say, "Lord, I'm
[2:04:52] not going to live here no longer, Lord.
[2:04:55] I'm taking my side with Jesus. I'm
[2:04:58] taking sides with Jesus."
[2:05:02] Oh granted, Lord God, may the grace of
[2:05:05] God, I pray, Father, for every heart
[2:05:07] right here this morning, Lord, may you
[2:05:09] sweep down, Lord. I pray, God, Father,
[2:05:12] to every open heart, Lord, according to
[2:05:14] the needs, Lord, that we have, Lord, in
[2:05:17] our lives, Lord, I pray. Give strength,
[2:05:19] give grace, Lord God, to each and every
[2:05:21] heart, Lord. Oh, granted, Lord God,
[2:05:26] may they see you, Lord. Not look, Lord,
[2:05:29] at themselves. they'll never get
[2:05:31] anywhere. True, there's reflection, but
[2:05:34] Lord God, how can we rightly reflect in
[2:05:37] our lives without seeing you, Lord?
[2:05:40] Because you're the target. You're the
[2:05:42] mark. You're the absolute Lord.
[2:05:46] Oh, God. And then we can look to you.
[2:05:49] Look away to Jesus,
[2:05:52] the author and finisher of our faith. Oh
[2:05:55] God, may we take Lord the admonition in
[2:05:58] Hebrews 12. Lay aside every weight and
[2:06:02] every sin that does so easily beset us
[2:06:04] and let us run this race with patience.
[2:06:07] Lord God granted this morning, Lord.
[2:06:11] We don't want to be idle, Lord. We want
[2:06:14] to be moving on,
[2:06:17] drawn closer to you.
[2:06:20] Help us, Lord.
[2:06:22] Lord, our daily and our daily walk. It's
[2:06:25] the simple things, Lord. It's a little
[2:06:28] things, little foxes that spoil the
[2:06:30] vine. It's not great big things. It's
[2:06:32] little things that we leave undone. It's
[2:06:35] a little things, Lord, and neglect here
[2:06:37] and neglect here. Oh God,
[2:06:40] if there's one thing about it, Lord,
[2:06:42] this word, this message that you've sent
[2:06:45] us,
[2:06:47] it doesn't, Lord God, it's not here to
[2:06:49] puff us up.
[2:06:51] But father truly it's here to cause us
[2:06:54] to see you're all that we have need of.
[2:06:58] Lord, I'm depending on you, Lord, every
[2:07:01] step of the way. Yes, Lord. Lord God,
[2:07:04] you've been faithful. You've been
[2:07:05] merciful. You've been long-suffering,
[2:07:07] Lord God. Father, you've been a faithful
[2:07:10] tutor, Lord.
[2:07:13] Oh, Lord Jesus, help us. May the spirit
[2:07:17] of God just sweep it through this
[2:07:18] congregation, Lord. I pray this morning
[2:07:21] may we Lord be able to stand Lord with
[2:07:23] that declaration as Paul could reflect
[2:07:26] back and be able to declare what was
[2:07:29] advantage Paul and disadvantage Christ.
[2:07:32] He was able to recognize what was it
[2:07:35] that would impede his walk with you. He
[2:07:38] said everything is lawful but all things
[2:07:40] are not expedient unto me Lord Jesus.
[2:07:45] It's not because we have to. I want to
[2:07:48] Lord,
[2:07:50] there's things Lord that you lead us to
[2:07:52] lay aside.
[2:07:56] And Lord, sometimes it's not even things
[2:07:58] that are sinful.
[2:08:01] It's just Lord, the more
[2:08:05] more in love with you, there's things
[2:08:07] that all of a sudden we realize that
[2:08:10] just is fading out of our life. It's no
[2:08:12] longer I have to I have to have this and
[2:08:17] importance. Why?
[2:08:19] Because of you, Lord. Oh God, I pray may
[2:08:23] every heart, Lord God, may each one have
[2:08:26] that relationship with you, Lord. May we
[2:08:29] have that kind of a reflection, Lord,
[2:08:31] because it's not you, Lord God. Your
[2:08:35] eyebrows squeezed together looking down
[2:08:37] on us, Lord, to try to bring such fear
[2:08:39] in our lives. No, that's not it at all.
[2:08:43] You want us to serve you because we love
[2:08:46] you. And how can we love you without
[2:08:50] your love being projected to us?
[2:08:54] As you Lord God gave it through John and
[2:08:57] John said, "We love him because he first
[2:09:02] loved us." Oh God, I pray right here
[2:09:06] this morning, Lord, if there's a heart
[2:09:09] that's never rose to that place to
[2:09:11] believe what you did for them on
[2:09:14] Calvary.
[2:09:17] May they, Lord God, I pray. May they,
[2:09:19] Lord, even within right now, that
[2:09:21] confession move within their mouth. I
[2:09:25] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. I
[2:09:28] believe what he did for me. I believe
[2:09:32] that all sin, debt, all sin was settled
[2:09:36] right there at Calvary. I believe the
[2:09:38] backbone of Satan was broke right there
[2:09:41] at Calvary. Hallelujah.
[2:09:43] He's my lamb. I believe that he died for
[2:09:47] me.
[2:09:48] Every habit, every situation right there
[2:09:52] was met at Calvary.
[2:09:54] And he rose again for our justification.
[2:09:58] We are justified by faith by believing
[2:10:01] on the Lord Jesus Christ and the spirit
[2:10:05] of God moving in your heart to bring
[2:10:07] about that belief to stay there and to
[2:10:09] believe him and you watch. It's not what
[2:10:12] you stop. It's what believing on him
[2:10:15] will do in your life. The habits will
[2:10:18] flee from your life.
[2:10:21] Spirits will flee
[2:10:24] by believing on him.
[2:10:27] And he himself who begun the good work,
[2:10:31] he'll move right in and cap off with his
[2:10:35] faith
[2:10:37] and seal you with the spirit of God.
[2:10:42] Hallelujah.
[2:10:44] Glory be to God. Glory be to God.
[2:10:51] Hallelujah. How many say, Lord, lead me
[2:10:54] on. Lead me on, Lord. Lead me on. No
[2:10:58] matter where you're at in your walk with
[2:11:00] God, Lord, lead me on. I want to go on,
[2:11:02] Lord God. I want to go on. I don't want
[2:11:05] to live between two desires. I want to
[2:11:07] go on, Lord.
[2:11:10] I want to live, Lord God, from that
[2:11:12] realm that you've called me to live in.
[2:11:15] Listen, sons and daughters of God,
[2:11:17] remember the prophet standing on the
[2:11:19] platform, that maniac walked up there.
[2:11:21] Remember that man in the spirit that was
[2:11:23] on that man was trying to get the
[2:11:25] prophet out in that other realm. But he
[2:11:28] said at that moment he said, "I chose to
[2:11:30] think different thoughts." That poor
[2:11:34] man. He don't even know what he's doing.
[2:11:35] You know what he did? He surrendered
[2:11:37] himself to the inner man.
[2:11:40] And it wasn't that man. It wasn't a
[2:11:42] flesh and blood affair. It was the
[2:11:44] spirit that was anointing that man that
[2:11:47] was challenging the spirit of God. And
[2:11:49] it allowed the spirit of God to come and
[2:11:51] take up the challenge. Say, Lord, that's
[2:11:54] where I want to live. That's where I
[2:11:56] want to live, Lord. In my home, among
[2:12:00] the body of Christ, I want to live, Lord
[2:12:03] God, behind the veil.
[2:12:05] Amen. Hallelujah. Glory be to God. Don't
[2:12:09] you love him this morning? Lord God,
[2:12:12] just have all of us, Lord. Have all of
[2:12:14] me, Lord.
[2:12:16] M help me sing. Amen. In the name of the
[2:12:20] Lord Jesus.

[2:23:20] all the way. Yes. I'm going all the way.

[2:23:51] I'm going all the way. Hey, I'm going
[2:23:56] home.
[2:23:58] with
[2:24:00] the Lord.

[2:24:05] the line drawn the line.

[2:24:54] I'm going all the way. Oh, I am going
[2:25:00] all the way with
[2:25:03] the Lord.
[2:25:06] You know the Bible says, "They that live
[2:25:08] godly in Christ shall suffer
[2:25:10] persecution."
[2:25:12] There's one thing about it. You get
[2:25:14] closer and closer to the Lord, you find
[2:25:17] just like declarations. Remember I read
[2:25:19] that to you this morning. Soon as you
[2:25:22] you make up your mind, even from what
[2:25:24] God has spoken here, Satan's going to be
[2:25:27] there to try to contest it.
[2:25:30] But press through that. Amen. Just look
[2:25:33] him straight in the face and say,
[2:25:34] "You're a liar."
[2:25:37] The blood speaketh better things.
[2:25:40] Amen. There's no doubt throughout this
[2:25:42] service, every one of us, there's things
[2:25:44] that God has spoken that you can put
[2:25:46] right back in the devil's face.
[2:25:49] Let me tell you, he's a guy that has a
[2:25:52] bow with no arrows. That's right. Are
[2:25:55] you hearing me? Riding with a bow with
[2:25:58] no arrows. But you've been given a word.
[2:26:01] Amen.
[2:26:03] Amen. And the word is neither even in
[2:26:05] thy mouth.
[2:26:07] Amen. I'm going to press on, Lord. I'm
[2:26:10] going to press on like when the prophet
[2:26:11] came out from that vision. Keep
[2:26:13] pressing. Keep pressing. Keep pressing.
[2:26:15] Keep pressing. Amen. Amen. God bless
[2:26:18] you. Why don't you shake hands with one
[2:26:19] another as you're being dismissed? Amen.
[2:26:22] So good to have each and every one of
[2:26:23] you in our gates. God bless you.
[2:26:25] Remember the fire pit fellowship tonight
[2:26:27] at 6.
[2:26:30] Going all the way.
