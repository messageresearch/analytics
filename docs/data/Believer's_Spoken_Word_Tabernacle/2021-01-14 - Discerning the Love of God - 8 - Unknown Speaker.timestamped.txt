[34:47] needs we have
[34:49] we have questions we have things lord
[34:52] that

[34:55] mind and

[35:00] our mind but it's just upon our heart
[35:03] but god we just want to take lord
[35:06] all of those things the greatest honor

[35:47] there's not a question lord there's not
[35:49] a doubt that

[35:53] you can't move for it
[35:55] we believe that dear god lord we don't
[35:58] want to be
[35:59] so focused on one thing that we would
[36:02] overlook
[36:03] dear god your desire to deal with our
[36:06] hearts
[36:07] and our lives lord sometimes the very
[36:10] things that will unlock
[36:11] healing unlock lord the blessing of god
[36:15] so we want to be sensitive lord because
[36:17] we believe
[36:19] dear god that you you have the words of
[36:22] eternal life you know
[36:24] what's best for us you work all things
[36:26] after the counsel of your own will

[37:24] amen you love the lord amen it sure is
[37:27] good to be in the house of the lord
[37:29] tonight
[37:30] we just want to invite you to the word
[37:32] of the lord in first corinthians
[37:35] chapter 13 and i want to go back over
[37:38] there and
[37:39] just try to resume here
[37:43] in the word
[37:51] in first corinthians 13
[37:54] verse 4 it says charity
[37:59] suffereth long and is kind
[38:03] charity envy not
[38:06] charity wanteth not itself
[38:09] and is not puffed up
[38:13] i'd like to just once again just
[38:16] speaking to you on that thought of
[38:17] discerning
[38:19] the love of god i just want to read this
[38:22] quote to you before we
[38:23] let you be seated brother branham he
[38:26] says it like this in the message love
[38:28] he says if you'll learn to love
[38:32] and to be kind to everybody and to be
[38:35] gentle
[38:36] and have patience it'll even make
[38:39] your home life different it'll make your
[38:43] associations
[38:45] different god will honor you
[38:49] and i like these last words now i've
[38:52] tried it
[38:54] brother brown goes into you know many of
[38:55] the different examples
[38:58] and this is we have a fountain as we've
[39:01] looked at here and been looking at
[39:03] when we have been born of the spirit of
[39:05] god we have
[39:06] we have a fountain that we are tapped
[39:09] into
[39:10] the things of the world have passed away
[39:13] there is no desire rooted in that new
[39:16] nature
[39:17] to be envious to have malice to hold a
[39:20] grudge
[39:22] it can't be in that ground but we know
[39:25] that even after we've been changed
[39:27] there's still
[39:28] a part two parts that haven't been
[39:31] changed
[39:32] and this is why we need the god part on
[39:34] the inside
[39:36] we need a son and daughter of god ruling
[39:38] and reigning
[39:39] from the inside one who's there to say
[39:42] this cannot dwell here though we can
[39:46] sense it and we can feel it these things
[39:47] can come
[39:49] but we do not as paul would write
[39:52] give no place to the devil
[39:55] this is our desire and we in ourselves
[39:58] we we can't do this without his help
[40:02] we we're made as god would liken us as
[40:05] sheep
[40:05] we're made to rest we're made to rely
[40:08] upon him because sometimes how things
[40:10] can happen so
[40:11] subtly we might feel like we've got a
[40:13] reason or we've got a ground or we've
[40:15] got a right or we've got
[40:17] but all those things right there when we
[40:19] really are in fellowship
[40:21] with god god many times he can come
[40:24] right down
[40:25] and when we're open in that way to say
[40:27] lord search me
[40:28] search me not just well lord you know
[40:31] i've been serving you for this long or
[40:33] lord i'm a prophet or i'm a pastor i'm a
[40:35] this but
[40:36] if we just can as a sheep say lord
[40:39] search me and we have that that that
[40:42] humbleness of heart to know that
[40:44] we need his help we need his discernment
[40:47] we need his leadership
[40:48] in our life and we have that kind of a
[40:51] that's a welcoming spirit
[40:53] you realize that's the very thing that
[40:55] welcomes him back
[40:56] to take us into rapture it's a welcoming
[40:58] spirit
[40:59] how could we have that how could that be
[41:02] if not
[41:03] for him providing for us and we want to
[41:06] stay in that i believe even as the world
[41:08] gets darker and
[41:09] darker and more evil but i believe that
[41:12] in the presence of the great i
[41:14] am there is a people of god who is
[41:16] becoming more tender
[41:18] and more sensitive to his will
[41:21] amen do you love him god bless you as
[41:24] you're being seated
[41:26] i think as we read that quote we it's
[41:28] not one of us that would not desire
[41:31] that god would honor us but the honor
[41:33] that we're looking for
[41:34] is not that we would be
[41:37] accounted to be greater than anyone else
[41:40] but it's just the favor of god
[41:42] to be able to have his presence abiding
[41:46] in our life to be able to have
[41:47] fellowship with god to be at a place to
[41:49] where that
[41:50] god is so mindful and merciful to take
[41:53] control
[41:54] even in situations that arise in our
[41:56] life and
[41:57] we're sitting there and we don't know
[41:58] what either to answer or do not even
[42:01] know what to do
[42:02] but we know the scripture is true that
[42:04] they that wait upon the lord
[42:06] shall renew their strength and we know
[42:08] that there is a there is a great great
[42:10] promise in waiting
[42:12] upon the lord many places in the
[42:13] scripture as it was
[42:15] would admonish us within that and we
[42:18] look at these
[42:19] the preciousness of it of how then in
[42:21] situations i think
[42:22] when brother branham speaks to us
[42:24] regarding many of these situations
[42:26] whether it's the bees the
[42:28] the bull and i i don't know how many
[42:29] times i just keep listening over and
[42:31] over and over and over but
[42:33] the thing that i always marvel about is
[42:35] that you know
[42:37] within it all it was it was many things
[42:39] that came to brother branham and you
[42:41] you read through different parts of the
[42:43] message and you'll find where there were
[42:44] different
[42:45] thoughts that actually tried to come to
[42:47] him but brother branham even
[42:49] thoughts were when that bull came and
[42:51] that man came that maniac there
[42:53] in oregon brother branham when you hear
[42:55] him tell it is some places he's able to
[42:57] recall some of those parts and
[42:59] you might say why would that be because
[43:01] somebody had need of it right there
[43:03] and because we needed to see that part
[43:05] of it as well
[43:06] to where that brother brown would say
[43:08] that the first thing that would come at
[43:09] him would be fear
[43:11] and but yet brother branham would say in
[43:13] each of those instances he said
[43:14] but yet he said i i said i chose to
[43:17] think different thoughts and he said i
[43:18] made up my mind
[43:20] i am not going to die a coward
[43:23] and i think that is i think that's um
[43:26] there's there's such counsel that we can
[43:28] take from that and how that god
[43:30] in the midst of that time there was such
[43:33] a
[43:33] an uh uh uh a relationship
[43:36] and a fellowship that we can we
[43:39] recognize
[43:40] that even as the prophet had with god
[43:42] but that's the same thing that you and i
[43:44] have the privilege to have with god as
[43:46] well
[43:47] it's where it's a continual openness to
[43:50] god there's a
[43:50] you know the bible will speak about
[43:52] prayer and i'm just
[43:54] i'm just going to follow him now when
[43:56] god speaks a prayer
[43:57] you know prayer is not to be made a
[44:00] thing of tradition
[44:01] that i got to get down on my knees you
[44:03] can be down on your knees and yet your
[44:05] heart not even be there at all
[44:07] you see it's it's this is where paul
[44:09] would say pray without ceasing
[44:12] paul would say you know a praise
[44:14] standing
[44:15] it's not the position of your body it's
[44:18] the condition of your heart
[44:20] is our heart really prostrate before god
[44:23] because you can pray right there you
[44:26] know and it's not saying that we
[44:27] you that we should not have time in
[44:29] prayer you should have time in prayer
[44:30] with god
[44:31] but it's not just something that we
[44:33] check in and check out but
[44:35] you know it's a spirit of prayer and you
[44:37] know let me just say this to you if
[44:39] something happens and you
[44:40] seemingly like don't have that time of
[44:42] prayer that you normally would like to
[44:44] have that day
[44:45] don't stop get in your car and keep on
[44:47] in the spirit of prayer
[44:48] remember you're a priest of god you've
[44:50] got within you
[44:52] that of of a portion of the great
[44:54] creator himself and as a son and
[44:56] daughter of god
[44:56] you have the ability by his spirit to
[45:00] create an
[45:01] atmosphere as you say so what should i
[45:04] do well
[45:04] sometimes when it's even in a tight
[45:06] atmosphere and you feel tight or you
[45:08] feel like things that's hard to press
[45:10] through
[45:10] what do i do brother braham says start
[45:12] out your prayer with praise
[45:14] if we just turn it out you might say
[45:16] well i got all these requests well maybe
[45:18] that day you just need to he knows
[45:19] what's in your heart anyhow
[45:21] and there might be a lot of requests and
[45:23] then there's other days where you think
[45:25] i wanted to just praise him but you had
[45:26] a lot of requests on your heart and the
[45:28] spirit of god was
[45:29] moving on your heart to bring this one
[45:31] before the throne and bring this one
[45:33] with
[45:33] before the throne you see we're just
[45:35] priests that want to be moved by the
[45:37] spirit of god
[45:38] and we can stay in that place then then
[45:40] it's then there's then there's a real
[45:42] i believe this is a real effectual
[45:44] witness that
[45:45] we can all we can testify of that god
[45:48] will honor us
[45:49] god sovereign god comes on the scene in
[45:52] the situations that deal with
[45:54] in our home life and associations and
[45:56] and all these things that we have so
[45:58] when we when we look here a little bit
[46:00] more here this evening and i want to
[46:02] just take another part in that scripture
[46:05] and dealing with where charity envy is
[46:07] not
[46:08] now out of the amplified bible it'll
[46:10] just save me from defining words but it
[46:12] says it like this
[46:14] love never is envious nor
[46:17] boils over with jealousy
[46:21] and we recognize that that that even
[46:24] when we have been
[46:27] born of the love of god that's the agape
[46:30] that's the love of god and that
[46:32] should be the love the love within our
[46:34] life that
[46:35] that should influence all the other love
[46:38] because
[46:38] you still you never separate from a
[46:41] feeling of love
[46:42] you still have feeling of love that is
[46:44] still a part of
[46:46] the things in in associates and brother
[46:48] brown would tell us you still have
[46:50] feeling of love for your wife but even
[46:52] in having that feeling of love for your
[46:54] wife
[46:54] remember brother tells us he said that
[46:56] also love there's jealousy that can
[46:58] accompany that love as well
[47:00] but you see it's not telling us do away
[47:03] with that let me just pause here for a
[47:05] moment
[47:06] you realize the scripture tells us that
[47:08] one of the signs
[47:09] of peerless times is men would be
[47:12] without natural affection
[47:15] things listen natural affection
[47:18] things that should be natural things
[47:21] that should just be
[47:22] hey this should not it should not have
[47:24] to be anything that should have to be
[47:26] instructed
[47:27] but you see if there's a condition and
[47:30] the reason that condition
[47:32] is now that was paul when paul spoke of
[47:35] that
[47:35] paul spoke of a seed that would be
[47:38] planted but then that seed would come to
[47:40] fruition
[47:41] and it would be in fruition in peerless
[47:43] times
[47:45] the reason the reason that that seed
[47:48] could even
[47:49] move throughout the earth and be where
[47:51] it's at now is because
[47:53] of the rejection of jesus christ
[47:57] it's not all together that people reject
[47:59] the bible
[48:00] but they reject the god of the bible and
[48:03] when you reject the god of the bible you
[48:05] reject
[48:06] him who is the word he is the one
[48:10] who makes the word to live and so we
[48:13] find the result we see
[48:15] this even in the earth today and the way
[48:18] things
[48:19] are that the way that they are we see
[48:21] this this
[48:22] this but yet within that of agape love
[48:25] we'll find where paul
[48:27] would deal even in ephesians five and
[48:29] you're
[48:30] perhaps from i know familiar with that
[48:32] we've preached from that many times here
[48:34] and you've you've heard it in the
[48:35] message and on and reading it and things
[48:37] but
[48:37] how paul would speak of even that that
[48:40] relationship between husband and wife
[48:42] is to be under the direction of agape
[48:45] love and this is
[48:46] what we want all we want all of our
[48:49] associations we want
[48:50] everything of our life god i want it to
[48:53] be
[48:53] under the influence of the love of god
[48:57] in other words lord i need your
[48:59] discernment i need your wisdom
[49:01] i need your leadership in these things
[49:03] lord god
[49:04] that my life would be completely under
[49:07] the influence of agape love because
[49:09] listen sometimes feeling love itself can
[49:12] kind of get
[49:12] log jammed you know there's compassion
[49:15] but you see even compassion has to be
[49:18] ruled over
[49:19] by a godly love yet we need compassion
[49:21] don't we
[49:22] the bible would write for us to be
[49:24] compassionate but yet remember
[49:26] jesus himself a man full of compassion
[49:29] but yet he walked right down through the
[49:31] multitude
[49:32] stepped over this one stepped over this
[49:33] is a pardon me excuse me and he went and
[49:36] he healed one man
[49:37] that was there at the pool of bethesda
[49:39] what was that that was not human
[49:41] compassion
[49:42] that was the compassion of god human
[49:44] compassion would have said
[49:46] i want to help everybody and let me just
[49:48] tell you that
[49:49] that was a real desire that was there
[49:51] but you see what jesus was reserved to
[49:54] it this was something to teach us that
[49:56] it's ought to be that in all things
[49:58] we're to be reserved
[50:00] to the love of god and i believe this
[50:02] with all my heart
[50:03] even within our lives we can say well i
[50:05] have an attribute to be a husband
[50:07] i have an attribute to be a you know a
[50:09] wife or a father or a mother
[50:11] but we want the leadership of the holy
[50:14] spirit
[50:14] that god would so direct us because
[50:17] sometimes
[50:18] in our lives we can get through
[50:21] reasoning because filial love will go
[50:23] along with that to where we can
[50:25] actually forsake what is really the best
[50:29] and the right way that's why we need the
[50:32] help of god
[50:35] so envy itself i want to just deal with
[50:38] this here
[50:39] tonight and we'll see where we get if we
[50:41] can finish this part up but
[50:43] you know envy we started looking at this
[50:46] and closing out last week but
[50:48] envy itself is a it's a it's an inward
[50:51] condition that's got to be dealt with
[50:54] envy itself even when things as i we
[50:57] referred to as god brought to my
[50:59] attention give no place to the devil
[51:02] and paul would say in another place uh
[51:04] casting down
[51:06] imaginations and every high thing that
[51:08] exalteth itself
[51:10] against uh against against the obedience
[51:13] of christ
[51:14] to the pulling down of strongholds
[51:17] strongholds and that same word out of
[51:20] ephesians plays
[51:21] it deals with retreats it deals with
[51:24] it's the same word as a castle it's
[51:27] where a fort same word is
[51:28] fortress in other words where something
[51:31] becomes a basis or an excuse
[51:34] and there's a lot of things that you and
[51:35] i can have excuses or
[51:37] as brother brandon would put it that's
[51:39] your rights yeah you've got a right to
[51:41] feel this way
[51:42] you've got a right to feel that way and
[51:45] all of those things
[51:46] having rights but yet if you
[51:49] if as a lamb a lamb forsakes and
[51:52] forfeits his own rights
[51:55] this is where it takes the grace of
[51:57] almighty god
[51:58] in our life you see envy itself is a
[52:02] is something as it can come so
[52:05] so subtly it's linked there with with
[52:08] jealousy
[52:09] you find that even in heaven as we
[52:12] looked at it that in heaven
[52:14] satan was filled with envy right
[52:17] she became he wanted to he look look
[52:19] where he wanted a kingdom
[52:21] that was better than michael's
[52:24] but why couldn't he just say look i want
[52:26] you to catch this
[52:28] satan himself is referred in the book of
[52:30] ezekiel as the anointed cherubim that
[52:33] covert
[52:35] he was god's right-hand man at one time
[52:40] and what more could you ask for
[52:44] what more could you and i ask for than
[52:46] to have fellowship with god
[52:49] no matter who we are it doesn't matter
[52:52] rank status what it does
[52:53] that doesn't matter at all what matters
[52:55] is is to have fellowship with god
[52:59] and to be in the favor of god
[53:02] but that wasn't enough
[53:05] he saw this with michael and he was
[53:08] moved with
[53:09] envy and because of that envy then he
[53:12] started
[53:13] to preach another gospel he started to
[53:15] sow
[53:16] a division then to where
[53:19] that the church that was all together as
[53:22] one
[53:22] there in heaven there became a division
[53:26] all because of a t-a-l-e
[53:30] a tale is that right
[53:34] it began to tell that went out and began
[53:36] to separate
[53:37] the angels i want you to catch this here
[53:40] the angels
[53:42] which every one of them only knew what
[53:44] it was like to be
[53:46] in the presence of god all they knew was
[53:49] holy holy holy lord god almighty that's
[53:52] all they knew
[53:54] amen they were not out here in a factory
[53:57] coming in you know to church and
[53:59] then going out among the workplace no no
[54:01] that's all they knew
[54:02] was in that atmosphere but a tale came
[54:05] among them
[54:07] and that tale coming among them it
[54:10] brought a separation
[54:12] but where did the separation begin it
[54:14] first
[54:15] began in their heart with a decision
[54:18] to even listen to it
[54:25] and here satan knows
[54:28] he studies he knows how to try to take
[54:32] even a person and try to you know put
[54:35] and say
[54:36] well look what this person has
[54:40] god trusted you more maybe you would
[54:42] have that
[54:43] come on some of you know where i'm going
[54:45] brother branham walks through oral
[54:47] roberts facility walks through
[54:48] billy graham's facility what did he say
[54:51] he said i'd be ashamed for them to come
[54:53] to
[54:54] my little trainer here's what he said
[54:57] god perhaps you couldn't trust me with
[54:59] something like this
[55:02] i want you to catch this the spirit of
[55:04] god
[55:05] spoke to the prophet's heart and said
[55:07] look up
[55:09] i'm your portion
[55:11] [Applause]
[55:14] to me thank god i appreciate that being
[55:17] included
[55:18] in the message because you know why
[55:21] it shows that even though that gift that
[55:24] lay there
[55:25] here was a son of god that had been born
[55:28] of the spirit of god
[55:29] the prophet of god to this age but he
[55:32] never
[55:33] tried to act or put on he never tried to
[55:36] cover any of his mistakes i'm gonna tell
[55:38] you
[55:39] if i can say it this clear i i don't
[55:41] know of anybody else who was as
[55:43] transparent
[55:44] as the prophet of god
[55:48] very transparent in many of these things
[55:51] but notice how god moved
[55:53] and it's not one thing it shows that
[55:55] sometimes
[55:56] there are things that even to this that
[55:58] you and i could think
[55:59] well why maybe this or god maybe you
[56:01] couldn't trust me or
[56:02] or this but oh my if we can stay in that
[56:06] channel
[56:06] then the god this is god honoring us god
[56:09] coming down and saying
[56:11] but i'm your push
[56:14] hallelujah you see then satan
[56:19] this jealousy this envy it comes down
[56:24] and satan is finding somebody he's
[56:26] looking
[56:28] he sees what's going on he sees how god
[56:31] has brewed over this earth
[56:33] he sees how that the spirit of god
[56:36] has has brewed and brought forth this
[56:39] earth when it was not even
[56:41] stardust or molecule he sees think of
[56:44] this
[56:44] the tenderness of almighty god
[56:48] he sees god's affection to his own word
[56:52] what god spoke now his word is becoming
[56:55] material and how that out of all the
[56:57] other
[56:57] planets and all the other while it was
[56:59] belching with them with gases and
[57:02] volcanics it's recorded in the book of
[57:04] ezekiel
[57:04] that satan walked up and down the coals
[57:08] of fire what was he doing
[57:09] he was laying claimed satan while he was
[57:12] walking
[57:13] he was wanting to lay claim upon this
[57:16] earth
[57:17] but he's too late
[57:21] it's too late because it was already in
[57:23] god's mind
[57:27] hallelujah just like he wanted to walk
[57:29] or maybe walk in your life but he's too
[57:31] late god's already laid a claim
[57:36] and it's not a claim that's been laid in
[57:38] this moment
[57:39] it was acclaimed clear back before the
[57:42] foundation of the world
[57:44] and that god who laid the claim there is
[57:46] the same god that comes down
[57:48] to make good on that claim
[57:57] how can i get in here right
[58:01] he sees this of this family what you
[58:03] think of this here for a moment
[58:05] he sees this family sees here a husband
[58:08] and wife
[58:09] just their love for one another remember
[58:12] brother randall would just
[58:13] dramatize it there for us how there was
[58:16] such a love they would
[58:17] take one another by the hand and come on
[58:20] honey let's go up to the cathedral
[58:22] right there and gathering among the
[58:24] trees papa's getting ready to come down
[58:27] he saw such a love and such a joy
[58:30] that was among them and brother brandon
[58:33] speaks there was a perfect
[58:34] perfect understanding of the love of god
[58:36] there was not an
[58:37] atmosphere these atmospheres that you
[58:40] and i have to deal with
[58:41] that's all now because of sin because of
[58:44] the fall
[58:45] they weren't dealing with that
[58:46] atmosphere but in the midst of that
[58:49] satan was looking with envy and how can
[58:52] i break
[58:53] this up right
[58:57] you see
[59:01] envy envy
[59:04] it hates happiness
[59:07] and hates joy
[59:15] so satan here he comes comes into the
[59:19] serpent
[59:20] we know he takes that place
[59:23] and he projects a gospel but the gospel
[59:25] he projects
[59:26] is a gospel of envy do you realize
[59:30] paul's
[59:30] writes under inspiration
[59:34] in the book of philippians chapter 1
[59:37] he said there are some even right now
[59:39] that are preaching the gospel out of
[59:41] contention and
[59:42] envy you know what that was all about
[59:45] well surely there ought to be a right
[59:47] there has to should be a right motive
[59:49] but you had men going about here is paul
[59:51] paul's preaching what's right
[59:53] but notice remember what paul would
[59:55] write in the book of timothy here i am
[59:57] preaching this
[59:58] jesus christ the son of david is raised
[1:00:00] from the grave
[1:00:01] and here are the miracles here the
[1:00:02] witness of the holy spirit but yet it's
[1:00:04] because of that he was persecuted
[1:00:06] and those were preaching with envy and
[1:00:09] is though trying to present themselves
[1:00:11] of we're preaching truth nothing's
[1:00:12] happening to us
[1:00:15] but just because of the blessings the
[1:00:17] blessings do not mean
[1:00:19] the clear skies and all the oh this is
[1:00:21] where we're in the favor of god
[1:00:24] see that's been the whole thing down
[1:00:25] through the ages this is where
[1:00:27] it's like where brother bram says no
[1:00:29] wonder the church would say where the
[1:00:30] church and this and that he said when
[1:00:32] they're protected by the government
[1:00:34] and then anybody else that doesn't go
[1:00:35] along with them they just strike them
[1:00:37] out
[1:00:37] cut them off cancel them and everything
[1:00:40] else he says no marvel
[1:00:44] right it's the same spirit
[1:00:47] what started in heaven it's the same
[1:00:49] spirit that works throughout
[1:00:51] it works there to envy
[1:00:54] wow let me just try to move we find cain
[1:00:57] here it comes in cane
[1:00:58] doesn't come in able but it comes in
[1:01:02] cane
[1:01:03] and cane is roth remember where he's
[1:01:05] wroth
[1:01:07] god looks to the depth of cain
[1:01:10] outside cain might have looked fine but
[1:01:13] god asked him
[1:01:14] why is your count and it's falling
[1:01:16] that's your inward person
[1:01:19] [Music]
[1:01:20] because he witnessed god he came
[1:01:23] labored he labored did what he did but
[1:01:25] then god came down
[1:01:27] and vindicated abel sacrifice
[1:01:30] but it was not able's righteousness
[1:01:33] it was god's righteousness that had been
[1:01:36] revealed
[1:01:37] now that righteousness of god had been
[1:01:39] brought to light
[1:01:40] and cain it caused jealousy to rise up
[1:01:44] in his life
[1:01:48] that didn't come from adam
[1:01:52] that didn't come from adam so then you
[1:01:55] find here
[1:01:56] as we move just a little bit here comes
[1:01:59] the lord jesus
[1:02:02] here he is among come to his own in his
[1:02:05] own received him not
[1:02:06] here in matthew 27 17 it says therefore
[1:02:09] when they were gathered together
[1:02:11] pilate said unto them think of this
[1:02:13] pilate inherit they hated one another
[1:02:16] i hate the bible said they hated one
[1:02:18] another but notice
[1:02:20] they united against the word
[1:02:23] made flesh
[1:02:27] is that right it was prophesied clear
[1:02:29] back even in the book of psalms notice
[1:02:31] they gathered together pilate said unto
[1:02:33] them whom will ye that i release unto
[1:02:36] you
[1:02:36] barabbas or jesus which is called
[1:02:40] christ for he knew look at this
[1:02:44] for he knew pilate wasn't a believer
[1:02:50] he knew that for envy they had delivered
[1:02:53] him
[1:02:55] pilate wasn't a believer but you see
[1:02:58] even there's things
[1:02:59] even among the world the world can see
[1:03:01] things to a place and say
[1:03:03] hey what's the motive behind this
[1:03:07] you understand if this these are things
[1:03:10] that can be
[1:03:10] somewhat that can be seen by people that
[1:03:13] say what's the motive behind all this
[1:03:16] pilate knew for envy he could see it
[1:03:20] the bible goes on in the book of mark
[1:03:23] and records it in that way
[1:03:24] the chief priest got among the people
[1:03:27] and began the bible says to move
[1:03:30] the people to ask for barabbas
[1:03:35] begin to go and stir this up because
[1:03:38] because to think of it they would ask
[1:03:40] for a murderer
[1:03:42] instead of the lord jesus christ
[1:03:46] they would ask they would ask for one
[1:03:48] who was a seditionist and everything
[1:03:50] else these are scriptural terms
[1:03:52] but they would ask for him they would
[1:03:54] call for him
[1:03:55] rather than take that of the lord jesus
[1:03:57] what caused them to do that let me tell
[1:04:00] you something
[1:04:01] they didn't even know what they were
[1:04:03] doing this
[1:04:04] is where it gets to a place to where
[1:04:06] even the testimony when nicodemus
[1:04:09] came to the lord jesus he said we know
[1:04:12] thou art a man come from god
[1:04:16] for no man can do such miracles
[1:04:21] but because it wasn't in their church
[1:04:25] because it wasn't god using them
[1:04:29] it didn't come their way
[1:04:34] god specializes in that
[1:04:37] god don't like coming our way of
[1:04:39] thinking
[1:04:40] that's where it really gets tested
[1:04:42] because we can have our thoughts
[1:04:44] but don't make your thoughts god don't
[1:04:47] get in such a way
[1:04:48] it's got to come this way it's got to
[1:04:50] happen because remember
[1:04:52] sometimes the very answer to things it
[1:04:54] comes in a way
[1:04:55] you're not even expecting the way the
[1:04:58] answer will come
[1:04:59] but god always answers
[1:05:03] brother braham said because we're
[1:05:05] praying a certain way and
[1:05:07] god answers but because he don't answer
[1:05:09] the way we're praying
[1:05:10] he said then we'll say he didn't answer
[1:05:13] but he did answer
[1:05:15] i just want to be sensitive to hear the
[1:05:17] answer
[1:05:19] is that right i don't want to have a
[1:05:20] cancelled spirit on me
[1:05:22] that cancels out when he says no
[1:05:27] i i want to have a i want to have a that
[1:05:30] of the spirit of god
[1:05:31] predominated they would say yes lord
[1:05:35] lord what's your will well son i want
[1:05:37] you to go through this
[1:05:38] god give me strength don't hold my hand
[1:05:41] lord don't turn me loose give me
[1:05:43] strength day by day lord
[1:05:44] i need you lord dear god i can't face
[1:05:47] this without you
[1:05:48] but lord you said you never leave me no
[1:05:50] forsake you lord god
[1:05:52] if you go with me lord amen
[1:05:58] acts 7 9 stephen picks this up
[1:06:03] and the patriarchs this is joseph's
[1:06:06] brother
[1:06:09] moved with envy and they sold joseph
[1:06:13] into egypt
[1:06:15] but i like this part we could really
[1:06:17] preach here but god was with him
[1:06:20] i like that i like that a whole lot
[1:06:27] now god makes every one of us different
[1:06:32] is that right and i'm not talking about
[1:06:35] whether we're short
[1:06:36] round or skinny or this but even in our
[1:06:39] makeups we're different but even how god
[1:06:42] has gifted us
[1:06:43] we're different
[1:06:47] every even among the five full ministry
[1:06:51] every gift is different
[1:06:54] a pastor is a pastor but every pastor is
[1:06:56] not the same
[1:06:58] amen and evangelists and on and on those
[1:07:01] it's not the same
[1:07:03] now i want you to think of this god paul
[1:07:06] would write about this
[1:07:07] who maketh us to differ one from another
[1:07:10] who is it that is so gifted in this way
[1:07:13] or in this direction you realize
[1:07:15] why they ended up down in egypt they
[1:07:18] ended up in egypt
[1:07:19] israel ends up in egypt because of
[1:07:22] jealousy
[1:07:22] among brethren it led them into bondage
[1:07:27] you see this is why when we when you can
[1:07:30] recognize how god is moving
[1:07:32] it's something about that it should
[1:07:34] thrill our hearts
[1:07:35] it doesn't matter how old the person is
[1:07:38] it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what
[1:07:40] color it doesn't matter none of that
[1:07:42] what matters is god is moving in our
[1:07:44] midst
[1:07:46] god is speaking to our hearts and we
[1:07:49] want to be open and be sensitive to god
[1:07:51] you know
[1:07:52] as i spoke to some young people even
[1:07:54] across
[1:07:55] uh in uh in philippines and i took just
[1:07:59] a
[1:07:59] i took just some teaching in one of the
[1:08:01] morning services and dealt with things
[1:08:03] of how that god
[1:08:04] he wants how that we in the parts of our
[1:08:07] life there's parts in our life
[1:08:09] of schooling and there's parts where god
[1:08:11] works in our life he
[1:08:12] packs talents and skills in our life
[1:08:15] that he has to unpack
[1:08:16] but we want him unpacked under his
[1:08:18] leadership you know what i'm referring
[1:08:20] to i'm referring to the tabernacle in
[1:08:21] the wilderness
[1:08:22] god unpacked that those skills god made
[1:08:24] unknown in the vision
[1:08:25] but you see even within all that as i
[1:08:28] was expressing to them i said
[1:08:29] you could sit here and you might have a
[1:08:32] bachelor's degree
[1:08:33] a master's degree and your pastor
[1:08:35] standing in the pulpit
[1:08:36] he may not even have a high school or
[1:08:38] secondary school
[1:08:40] diploma but remember there's times
[1:08:42] you'll need to use
[1:08:43] your natural your that that schooling
[1:08:46] that was given
[1:08:47] but don't you ever try to use that
[1:08:49] natural schooling that natural wisdom
[1:08:51] to filter the word because remember the
[1:08:53] word
[1:08:54] it was before stardust and or molecule
[1:08:57] this is the wisdom of god and this is
[1:09:00] where humility comes into where a person
[1:09:02] can set maybe with a doctor's degree and
[1:09:05] the highest of education
[1:09:06] but yet they're able to humble
[1:09:08] themselves under the mighty hand of god
[1:09:11] and hear god's voice and take his
[1:09:13] leadership they're not
[1:09:14] resting on their scholarship or their
[1:09:17] reasonings or
[1:09:18] i understand this or i can do this or i
[1:09:20] can put this together
[1:09:21] but they're waiting on just saith the
[1:09:24] lord and they're saying god
[1:09:26] even with everything it's not my
[1:09:28] abilities that's got this
[1:09:30] this is you lord that's given me this
[1:09:32] ability
[1:09:33] i want this ability like solomon said
[1:09:35] lord
[1:09:36] thou knowest my coming in and my going
[1:09:38] out god i want you to order
[1:09:41] fully my life
[1:09:45] envy now
[1:09:50] if we looked at this in a natural way
[1:09:53] huh some things that jacob did
[1:09:56] also stirred up some jealousy
[1:10:00] you go to giving one one of your kids a
[1:10:03] special coat
[1:10:04] come on i know the spiritual type here
[1:10:06] but you understand there's also
[1:10:08] many parts to this in teaching and
[1:10:09] laying it out
[1:10:11] i'm on a quote a quote that my brother
[1:10:13] really loves brother jerry loves this
[1:10:14] quote
[1:10:15] and that is if god gives one of his
[1:10:17] children ice cream
[1:10:19] he gives them all ice cream
[1:10:24] you see god has a way if i'm
[1:10:28] my memory recall it serves me correctly
[1:10:30] about this
[1:10:32] that even how you take suzanne wesley
[1:10:34] who had so many kids
[1:10:36] but yet she was able to spend time
[1:10:39] quality time with each one of them
[1:10:42] to wear that when everything was said
[1:10:44] and done and after it all
[1:10:46] they all could think i'm mama's pet
[1:10:51] she made me feel special but then when
[1:10:54] the next one came along
[1:10:55] oh mama has the same love for him or her
[1:10:59] too
[1:11:01] it's things that we learn that you know
[1:11:04] among
[1:11:05] even among even our children they're all
[1:11:08] different even as we're all different
[1:11:09] they respond to things differently
[1:11:11] sometimes they even
[1:11:12] they think differently they have
[1:11:15] different likes
[1:11:17] sometimes they have lights and things or
[1:11:20] and i'm talking about things that they
[1:11:21] enjoy to do i'm not talking about sin
[1:11:23] but things that they might enjoy that
[1:11:26] you may not be good at at all you may
[1:11:29] not even like it all
[1:11:32] but you'll condescend why
[1:11:35] because of that child you take time you
[1:11:40] take time with them you learn
[1:11:41] you learn and you study how how
[1:11:44] can i be a friend or as brother branham
[1:11:47] would take the term
[1:11:48] buddy i understand we gotta balance that
[1:11:51] term buddy out because
[1:11:53] there's times where you gotta you gotta
[1:11:54] be their buddy but you also gotta gotta
[1:11:56] be the high tanner too
[1:11:58] that that never standards and and and
[1:12:01] things
[1:12:02] never ever leave no matter how old they
[1:12:05] are and when you're in your home
[1:12:07] there's standards it's there this is the
[1:12:09] standard in this house
[1:12:11] the token put this standard in this is
[1:12:13] the standard no bending no budging
[1:12:15] this is where it stands are you with me
[1:12:19] see that also brings security in our
[1:12:21] life i don't know how in the world we
[1:12:23] got on this
[1:12:24] that brings security in their life
[1:12:28] you know i always think my brother homer
[1:12:29] said brother homer
[1:12:31] you know he's something else he said i'm
[1:12:33] so glad he's feeling better
[1:12:35] he said you know he said i know my mama
[1:12:37] loved me he said she always stayed in
[1:12:39] contact with me
[1:12:41] he talked about every day he said she
[1:12:42] just went and gave me a whooping to
[1:12:44] start today
[1:12:46] you know brother homer you know that's
[1:12:47] got to be the truth but these patriarchs
[1:12:51] joseph's brother you see
[1:12:52] god god made the difference and i'll say
[1:12:56] it like this
[1:12:57] even when it comes into our homes and
[1:13:00] the way things are
[1:13:01] you know it's even of things to wear
[1:13:05] yeah we have to be careful with things
[1:13:07] that we don't even
[1:13:08] you talk things up to where you get
[1:13:10] people you get your wife trying to be
[1:13:12] like this sister
[1:13:13] or your husband trying to be like this
[1:13:14] this guy listen
[1:13:16] god don't want us pattern ourselves
[1:13:17] after one another
[1:13:19] i'm not interested in this church being
[1:13:21] like any other church
[1:13:22] i'm not trying to make it different and
[1:13:24] god just knows what he's doing
[1:13:27] i know so-and-so does this that's fine
[1:13:29] and good for them but i'm not them and
[1:13:31] they're not me
[1:13:33] i have to be who god has called me to be
[1:13:36] and god made
[1:13:37] just like he made you god has made us
[1:13:39] that way for a purpose and a reason
[1:13:42] this is why david could say i'm
[1:13:44] fearfully and wonderfully made
[1:13:47] man i would be so out of place i mean
[1:13:50] it's
[1:13:51] oh my goodness i mean i do everything i
[1:13:53] can do when i
[1:13:54] have power points and things like that
[1:13:56] and thank god sometimes that i can go in
[1:13:58] gears like that
[1:13:59] i love that gear but you know what i
[1:14:01] can't i can't always do
[1:14:03] the the other things unless god would
[1:14:06] have me to do it you know
[1:14:07] for for a moment i just want to be free
[1:14:11] if you just be yourself you know you're
[1:14:13] not trying to worry do i have this or
[1:14:16] do i say it like this and do i do this
[1:14:18] just be yourself and let god use you
[1:14:21] brother braham said it over and over let
[1:14:22] go and let god have his way
[1:14:25] amen you know you're just learning
[1:14:28] learning in this way if you know
[1:14:29] people have you to preach if they don't
[1:14:31] care for it they won't have you back
[1:14:32] settled it so anyhow in acts 7 9
[1:14:35] the patriarchs moved with envy and they
[1:14:38] sold joseph into egypt but god
[1:14:41] was with him you know what it speaks to
[1:14:42] you and i that even when times when
[1:14:45] envy that we can sense when envy has
[1:14:48] come against us
[1:14:49] envy envy has put us into a situation
[1:14:53] but let us remember that if god allows
[1:14:56] envy to come our way or against us
[1:15:00] let us remember god that permits it
[1:15:03] is the god who's faithful is the god who
[1:15:06] is with
[1:15:06] us and god will take that and he'll use
[1:15:09] it for his goodness
[1:15:12] because when actuality a prophetic eye
[1:15:15] was able to see
[1:15:16] that down there in this time when joseph
[1:15:19] was down there
[1:15:20] god had to work a little bit of pride
[1:15:23] out of joseph's life
[1:15:26] glory be to god acts 13 44.
[1:15:30] here's some jews at uh at antioch
[1:15:33] in presidio here's where paul and them
[1:15:37] are
[1:15:37] are preaching the bible says the next
[1:15:39] sabbath day
[1:15:40] came almost the whole city together to
[1:15:42] hear the word of god
[1:15:44] but when the jews saw the multitudes
[1:15:47] they glorified god
[1:15:50] knew when the jews saw the multitudes
[1:15:54] they were filled
[1:15:57] with envy and spake against those things
[1:16:01] which were spoken
[1:16:03] by paul contradicting
[1:16:06] and blasphemy they didn't know what they
[1:16:08] were doing
[1:16:10] they were filled with the same spirit
[1:16:13] that led that division in heaven
[1:16:18] i mean think of it who wouldn't want to
[1:16:20] see somebody
[1:16:21] these are jews witnessing god dealing
[1:16:24] among the gentiles
[1:16:25] they knew what the gem what we were
[1:16:28] pagans
[1:16:28] heathens idol worshipers hey you don't
[1:16:31] have to get too detailed
[1:16:33] to get into reading of the kind of stuff
[1:16:35] that went on and the lives and things
[1:16:36] that was just
[1:16:37] it was common just as much as packing
[1:16:39] peanut butter and jelly in your lunchbox
[1:16:42] come on somebody and the jews could look
[1:16:44] at them and say oh my
[1:16:45] oh goodness oh my you would have thought
[1:16:48] they would have
[1:16:49] you you would have thought they would
[1:16:50] have at least rejoiced and said
[1:16:52] praise god i'm going to be working next
[1:16:54] to somebody on the line now
[1:16:56] that my they're not going to have to
[1:16:57] watch their mouth and they're not going
[1:16:59] to have their pinups they're not going
[1:17:00] to do this i'm not going to do that
[1:17:03] hey come on some of you even when god
[1:17:05] got a hold of your life
[1:17:06] you had family that called you a nut
[1:17:10] called you crazy come on now
[1:17:13] you think about think about brother
[1:17:15] branham's here's his daddy
[1:17:18] his daddy told him you ain't coming and
[1:17:20] living in this house with that religion
[1:17:23] kicked him out when he got saved
[1:17:27] there had to be a decision that was made
[1:17:30] come on paul writes of this in the book
[1:17:33] of hebrews
[1:17:34] you're thought to be a gazing stock you
[1:17:36] became companion
[1:17:37] of those who were so used you're
[1:17:39] becoming outcasts and people ridiculing
[1:17:41] you
[1:17:41] people making fun of you but you had met
[1:17:44] one
[1:17:46] it become the love of your life
[1:17:50] he become the one that they can say what
[1:17:52] happened to you
[1:17:54] you could say i met jesus i met him
[1:17:59] and he took it all away don't you want
[1:18:01] to know him
[1:18:03] hallelujah you see it's something about
[1:18:07] it that
[1:18:07] here they would be filled listen you've
[1:18:09] even find this sometimes among the
[1:18:11] workplace
[1:18:12] where people will be filled with envy
[1:18:14] and you think
[1:18:15] what kind of a spirit is coming against
[1:18:17] me what what reason do they even have to
[1:18:20] disagree with me you've done nothing
[1:18:22] maybe but good
[1:18:24] i'm gonna tell them if you're an
[1:18:25] agitator then you've got what you got
[1:18:28] come on now but you understand what i'm
[1:18:31] saying
[1:18:32] when because the bible tells us we're to
[1:18:34] live peaceably with all men
[1:18:37] as much as lies within you
[1:18:42] filled with envy now notice here's
[1:18:44] another place
[1:18:45] in acts 17 4 and some of them believe
[1:18:49] and consorted with paul and simon here's
[1:18:51] some more
[1:18:52] gentiles at thessalonica and of the
[1:18:54] devout greeks
[1:18:56] a great multitude and of the chief women
[1:18:59] not a few oh my the chief women
[1:19:03] chief people not a few i mean
[1:19:06] if it would only been two or three then
[1:19:09] let they go
[1:19:10] but it wasn't a few see they were
[1:19:13] hearing the word of god they were they
[1:19:16] were hearing
[1:19:17] a trumpet being sounded to their life
[1:19:20] they realized
[1:19:21] i can go free and they just were
[1:19:24] turning loose in the liberty of god
[1:19:28] look what this did the jews which
[1:19:30] believed
[1:19:31] not moved with envy
[1:19:35] i'm talking about jews people who knew
[1:19:37] the law
[1:19:39] they could quote the word frontwards and
[1:19:41] backwards
[1:19:42] knew the prophets knew the psalms and
[1:19:44] this and ever you say just because they
[1:19:46] were jews
[1:19:47] i believe there's some implication here
[1:19:49] there the scripture is letting us know
[1:19:51] because remember it was an outcast that
[1:19:54] crucified the lord jesus
[1:19:55] they crucified him and they sung the
[1:19:57] very psalms
[1:19:58] of what was taking place but they were
[1:20:01] so blind
[1:20:02] that they didn't recognize what was
[1:20:03] taking place well how were they so blind
[1:20:06] envy brings blindness
[1:20:14] envy is a horrible thing it can bring a
[1:20:18] blindness
[1:20:19] to people don't even know the decision
[1:20:21] they're making and it's this
[1:20:22] trap they're being led right into
[1:20:26] what does that envy moon within me
[1:20:33] took unto them look at this
[1:20:36] certain lewd fellows
[1:20:39] of the baser sort these are guys
[1:20:43] that were total outcasts these are guys
[1:20:47] you didn't want around your neighborhood
[1:20:49] these are guys
[1:20:50] these jews didn't want to associate with
[1:20:53] but they knew
[1:20:54] where to go get troublemakers
[1:20:58] the bible said certain lewd fellows
[1:21:02] of the baser sort and gathered a company
[1:21:06] and set all the city on an uproar and
[1:21:09] assaulted the house of jason
[1:21:11] and sought to bring them out to the
[1:21:13] people what did that
[1:21:14] they were moved within thee
[1:21:18] brother i hear brother branham through
[1:21:20] the message as he says he says even in
[1:21:22] congress right now he said
[1:21:23] they're putting up laws he said laws he
[1:21:25] said to close us down to stop this
[1:21:28] message and to do
[1:21:29] he said you know the reason of it is
[1:21:30] they're filled with envy
[1:21:33] it's jealousy when it ought to be
[1:21:35] something they should be rejoicing
[1:21:37] they said there should be a rejoicing
[1:21:40] but it's not
[1:21:41] but do you realize what the sadness of
[1:21:43] it is
[1:21:44] it's spirits that's right it's
[1:21:48] darkness it's what paul called
[1:21:53] that present darkness
[1:21:56] and that darkness is evil
[1:21:59] demonic forces
[1:22:03] satan let it be known to jesus when he
[1:22:06] offered him the kings and the kingdoms
[1:22:07] of the world
[1:22:08] you let him know i can give you these
[1:22:12] so brother branham made it so clear he
[1:22:14] said every man that goes up there is not
[1:22:15] born again
[1:22:16] as of the devil it's on my words that's
[1:22:19] the words of the prophet
[1:22:21] is that right now i understand how
[1:22:22] brother branham brings it brother brown
[1:22:24] will even when he would pray for the
[1:22:25] presidential
[1:22:26] election he would pray in a certain way
[1:22:28] god if you give us grace
[1:22:30] that here someone comes in that there
[1:22:32] would be time for more souls in other
[1:22:34] words someone who would be favorable
[1:22:36] to that uh to that of the churches but
[1:22:39] if not
[1:22:40] then god give us grace yes
[1:22:44] as he was praying in 1960 you're aware
[1:22:46] of that that prayer
[1:22:48] they were these individuals were filled
[1:22:50] within me remember it was
[1:22:51] nero nero sat rome on fire
[1:22:55] and then turned around and blamed it on
[1:22:57] the christians
[1:23:00] he was filled with envy you see it shows
[1:23:03] that very thing among the people and it
[1:23:05] just starts
[1:23:06] and it turns around like these are the
[1:23:07] people that's the problem these are the
[1:23:09] people that's the problem
[1:23:10] but you know it gets to finally to a
[1:23:12] place
[1:23:14] to where it was like pharaoh came out in
[1:23:17] egypt and he said
[1:23:18] get out of here get out of here
[1:23:22] leave egypt
[1:23:25] adios
[1:23:29] hallelujah is that right in that same
[1:23:31] quote
[1:23:32] brother brown said see a man can live so
[1:23:34] close to god
[1:23:36] till the devil don't even know what to
[1:23:38] do with him
[1:23:40] until my sons and daughters of god the
[1:23:42] devil says i bring this
[1:23:44] i bring this i bring this i bring that
[1:23:46] and yet
[1:23:47] they still keep moving on all right dumb
[1:23:51] dumb dumb dumb
[1:23:52] devil it's not me that liveth
[1:23:55] it's christ that liveth in me
[1:24:03] now i want you to just let me just come
[1:24:05] to just a place i've just got just a
[1:24:07] couple moments here
[1:24:08] and i want to just bring us here to this
[1:24:10] place and then we'll just
[1:24:12] we'll just stop here there's no way i
[1:24:13] can even get to a place
[1:24:16] this is why brother branham makes a
[1:24:17] statement and he says no matter how good
[1:24:20] a christian is once you think of this no
[1:24:23] matter how good a christian is
[1:24:25] before the public how gracious
[1:24:29] he is to his fellow man doing not
[1:24:32] but good i don't have it up there but
[1:24:34] just listen let him confess
[1:24:36] christ as his savior
[1:24:39] and acknowledge the operation of the
[1:24:42] gifts of the holy spirit
[1:24:45] in tongues prophecy healing miracles
[1:24:48] and he will be condemned
[1:24:52] just acknowledge him as your savior
[1:24:54] you're all right
[1:24:56] but as soon as you acknowledge him as a
[1:24:58] living god that's a mosque
[1:25:01] then you'll be condemned because see a
[1:25:04] living god among us
[1:25:05] will not allow sin to remain a living
[1:25:08] god among us stands against sin
[1:25:12] is that right it calls sin out
[1:25:15] and because the devil is exposed what
[1:25:17] does satan do
[1:25:19] he works to try to rally and works to
[1:25:21] try to build
[1:25:22] envy you see this is where
[1:25:25] bill graham says c says the spirit of
[1:25:27] the world is very important
[1:25:29] the spirit of this world
[1:25:32] hates the spirit of god
[1:25:35] so what do i do don't get confused by
[1:25:37] the flesh and blood that's being used
[1:25:40] it's the spirit of the world
[1:25:43] see satan's trickery is to get you
[1:25:45] focused on the flesh
[1:25:47] the voice that's being used but
[1:25:49] recognize who's behind it
[1:25:52] is that right if you recognize who's
[1:25:55] behind it that's why brother bram says
[1:25:56] when your brother does this or your
[1:25:57] sister says that
[1:25:58] he says recognize it's not your brother
[1:26:00] it's not your sister it's the devil that
[1:26:02] made him do it
[1:26:08] how many of you have had to say honey
[1:26:09] forgive me
[1:26:11] i shouldn't have said it that way i
[1:26:13] shouldn't have done that
[1:26:15] oh my some of you must brought your
[1:26:16] angel wings in here tonight
[1:26:21] why why because the desire in our heart
[1:26:26] if you see even beyond everything it
[1:26:28] moves us into that place
[1:26:31] that's this is not who we are as i said
[1:26:32] last week we used to live at that
[1:26:34] address
[1:26:35] it used to be no don't walk through that
[1:26:37] guy's yard that guy come out on the
[1:26:39] porch
[1:26:40] we used to there used to be an address
[1:26:44] where another man used to live
[1:26:47] but that guy don't live here no more
[1:26:50] matter of fact brother carlos
[1:26:52] he had a funeral
[1:26:56] don't let me get on sunday's message
[1:26:59] he had there was a funeral service there
[1:27:02] was a funeral preaching
[1:27:04] everything but in one obituary where i
[1:27:07] put him in heaven
[1:27:12] the spirit of this world hates the
[1:27:15] spirit of god
[1:27:16] and because it can't overcome
[1:27:20] the spirit of the lord it tries
[1:27:23] to destroy the vessel
[1:27:26] in whom the spirit of truth dwells
[1:27:34] see persecution and those things it's
[1:27:36] it's a part in our life this is why
[1:27:39] in the scripture let me just try to
[1:27:42] just try to let me just end with this
[1:27:44] here
[1:27:46] proverbs 14 30 because i don't want to
[1:27:48] keep you
[1:27:49] i love this scripture a sound heart
[1:27:54] is the life of the flesh
[1:27:58] but in the the rottenness
[1:28:02] of the bones
[1:28:06] now let's say i love the scripture it's
[1:28:08] the first part of the scripture i take
[1:28:10] admonition from the second part
[1:28:12] but i love the promise and the first
[1:28:14] because the promise and the prayer
[1:28:16] first it speaks a sound heart you know
[1:28:19] what speaking of
[1:28:20] a healthful heart what's a healthful
[1:28:22] heart this doesn't mean that you've
[1:28:24] met all the american heart association
[1:28:27] they'll change their guidelines after a
[1:28:29] few years anyhow we're not talking about
[1:28:30] that but have you met
[1:28:31] god's guidelines has everything been
[1:28:35] settled in your heart between you and
[1:28:36] the lord
[1:28:38] have you entered into the rest of the
[1:28:40] lord
[1:28:41] have you entered into that place where
[1:28:43] it's the peace of god
[1:28:45] the love of god is dwelling in your
[1:28:47] heart by faith then you've got a sound
[1:28:48] heart
[1:28:49] and that soundness of heart is life to
[1:28:51] the flesh
[1:28:54] what a privilege it is you know what a
[1:28:57] privilege it is
[1:28:59] not only does the new birth
[1:29:02] make a way and it's the entrance
[1:29:06] ministered unto us it's the rest now the
[1:29:09] peace in our soul
[1:29:10] it's the token it's the seal it's the
[1:29:12] guarantee
[1:29:13] ah there in the changing of dimension
[1:29:16] but
[1:29:16] there is an effect even right now
[1:29:20] upon our bodies
[1:29:25] once you think of this you know
[1:29:28] there's a reason why satan while he'll
[1:29:31] come and he'll even try to
[1:29:33] affect us with different things this is
[1:29:35] why he'll try to come and he'll try to
[1:29:37] bring
[1:29:38] situations of stress
[1:29:41] when something is handed to you don't
[1:29:43] take it
[1:29:45] i'm not talking about the box of
[1:29:46] rattlesnakes now i'm not i'm talking
[1:29:48] about
[1:29:49] take it and put it into god's hands and
[1:29:52] when you put it in god's hands
[1:29:54] don't go and tamper with it and take it
[1:29:56] out of his hands and
[1:29:58] put it there right the bible says commit
[1:30:01] thy ways
[1:30:02] unto the lord commit it to god and i
[1:30:06] know sometimes it seems it sounds
[1:30:08] you hear brother brahm say it the
[1:30:09] scriptures would say it but i i've even
[1:30:12] said this over and over
[1:30:13] because i've found this in my own life
[1:30:15] but sometimes when it's something that
[1:30:17] it seems like it's
[1:30:18] you're just dwelling on you're wanting
[1:30:20] to resolve you're wanting to see solved
[1:30:22] you're wanting to
[1:30:24] sometimes i've even come to i've come to
[1:30:25] this place lord
[1:30:27] help me to come to a place of commitment
[1:30:30] help me yeah because i i don't believe
[1:30:33] in just
[1:30:34] well we just just committed and we just
[1:30:36] and then you actually you're still
[1:30:37] carrying it around
[1:30:39] i want to be honest with god because god
[1:30:42] god likes honesty
[1:30:44] god doesn't want us coming to him as an
[1:30:46] actor
[1:30:48] he said you just you just tell me what's
[1:30:50] on your heart
[1:30:51] we're buddies you can tell me what's on
[1:30:53] your heart we're friends
[1:30:56] is that right that's why even the
[1:30:57] scripture could say in the book of james
[1:30:59] confess your faults one to another and
[1:31:01] pray that you be healed
[1:31:03] there should be even that closeness
[1:31:05] among us as brothers and sisters
[1:31:08] let alone how much greater with god amen
[1:31:11] see god doesn't want us he wants us he
[1:31:13] wants us to be real
[1:31:15] to be genuine and so even in this here
[1:31:19] this
[1:31:20] this soundness and we see it that
[1:31:23] sometimes there's things that can come
[1:31:24] our way and this is why the devil
[1:31:27] will try to fight at your rest this is
[1:31:30] why brother branham would say it this
[1:31:31] way
[1:31:32] he says worry causes cancer
[1:31:36] temper causes cancer now you know i some
[1:31:39] of you may be doing you were too young
[1:31:40] but
[1:31:41] i i've dealt with i preached a few
[1:31:43] messages on this showing these things
[1:31:44] that the prophet preached
[1:31:46] and bringing them out in medical science
[1:31:48] even where
[1:31:49] they have people in nursing homes that
[1:31:51] are dealing sometimes with dementia
[1:31:53] sometimes you have those that that and
[1:31:56] they don't even deal with sometimes
[1:31:57] sometimes what actually uh i don't know
[1:31:59] if i got the right word exacerbates that
[1:32:01] and moves it forward
[1:32:02] is because there's a grudge that's been
[1:32:04] held there
[1:32:05] that's never been let go and one of the
[1:32:08] things
[1:32:09] that even these cancer doctors many
[1:32:11] times i'm talking
[1:32:12] sometimes facilities where people will
[1:32:14] go and they're receiving treatments
[1:32:16] one of the first things they'll deal
[1:32:18] with with these people is
[1:32:19] is to really look to see is there
[1:32:21] underlying things that they're still
[1:32:23] harboring
[1:32:24] like unforgiveness because that in
[1:32:28] itself this is this is medical science
[1:32:30] no matter how much treatment you do
[1:32:33] that right there that laying in that
[1:32:36] life
[1:32:36] will never allow the treatments to do
[1:32:38] any good
[1:32:41] this is why god says a sound heart
[1:32:44] is life to the flesh but envy
[1:32:47] is rottenness to the bones
[1:32:51] you know it's a disease then when it
[1:32:53] listen
[1:32:54] it's a disease inwardly it's things that
[1:32:57] can happen
[1:32:58] that's an inward condition this is why
[1:33:00] we need the help of god
[1:33:04] we need the help of god
[1:33:08] i think the lord is just he took us
[1:33:10] within this just a little bit into this
[1:33:12] tonight
[1:33:12] to show us god doesn't
[1:33:15] first of all god doesn't want us to be
[1:33:18] like everybody else
[1:33:19] i believe that we have to listen i
[1:33:21] believe we have to have godly examples
[1:33:23] i i believe there ought to be godly
[1:33:24] examples in the church
[1:33:27] husbands and wives i believe the pastor
[1:33:30] and his wife ought to be
[1:33:31] a real example but i'm not telling we
[1:33:33] understand we're not talking about
[1:33:35] showmanship we're talking about being
[1:33:36] natural it ought to be an example
[1:33:39] to the expression you understand paul
[1:33:43] picked this up in the book of titus
[1:33:44] he wrote to titus how that the older men
[1:33:48] are to minister to the younger men
[1:33:52] and the older women are to minister to
[1:33:54] the younger women
[1:33:55] because we recognize things that you've
[1:33:58] come through
[1:33:59] you also recognize pressures you
[1:34:01] recognize those things that's why paul
[1:34:03] would say
[1:34:04] that the older the elder would teach the
[1:34:06] younger
[1:34:07] hey we'll teach them hey be sober minded
[1:34:11] among other things the elder women teach
[1:34:14] the
[1:34:15] teach the younger ones i say elder don't
[1:34:18] don't don't get offended you older
[1:34:19] you understand teach them the bible says
[1:34:23] to love their husbands wow don't they
[1:34:26] love them they do
[1:34:28] but show them what it's all about but
[1:34:30] it's not like here we're going to get on
[1:34:31] the stage
[1:34:32] and i'm going to show it that's all he's
[1:34:33] talking about be natural
[1:34:36] let it be a display let god work in your
[1:34:39] life
[1:34:40] let it ought it's something that is so
[1:34:42] clear that's there but yet with all of
[1:34:44] those examples
[1:34:46] god doesn't want you trying to be like
[1:34:48] anybody else
[1:34:51] god doesn't want me to be like anybody
[1:34:52] else
[1:34:54] god wants you to be you but that doesn't
[1:34:56] mean set
[1:34:58] in our own ways that's that's not don't
[1:35:00] take it that far
[1:35:01] it means god has made you and i the way
[1:35:04] we are
[1:35:05] but it's to be yielded to him he's got a
[1:35:08] purpose
[1:35:09] in what he's done and this is why that
[1:35:12] even
[1:35:12] how god has made us and i think it's you
[1:35:14] know husbands and wives throughout this
[1:35:17] building you know tonight you could look
[1:35:18] and say
[1:35:19] then nobody else from me that becomes
[1:35:22] more real
[1:35:23] right nobody else from me
[1:35:30] but god he doesn't want us
[1:35:33] to be like nobody else neither does it
[1:35:35] listen to me he doesn't want things to
[1:35:37] be said in that way
[1:35:41] honey why can't you be like sister
[1:35:42] so-and-so
[1:35:46] or sweetie or honey who however you call
[1:35:48] your husband
[1:35:49] why can't you be like brother so-and-so
[1:35:52] that
[1:35:53] is setting up an atmosphere for envy
[1:36:01] why can't you do look
[1:36:05] you can see it right here we have four
[1:36:06] different song leaders
[1:36:08] and they're all different
[1:36:14] god doesn't want every one of us to be
[1:36:17] the same
[1:36:20] i know tonight some of you probably
[1:36:21] shocked he's got his suit caught on
[1:36:24] i'm shocked too but believe it or not
[1:36:26] i've preached a few times with a suit
[1:36:27] coat on the whole time
[1:36:30] but what does it god wants us to be
[1:36:34] wants us to be yielded wants to be
[1:36:36] simple
[1:36:38] we want to encourage one another
[1:36:41] i'm not interested in trying to shape
[1:36:42] one another i've said it before
[1:36:44] sometimes
[1:36:45] it's just like this when you know you
[1:36:47] come into a relationship you don't enter
[1:36:49] into a relationship because you think
[1:36:51] this is how i might better this
[1:36:52] individual you might as well forget it
[1:36:54] you're entering in with the total
[1:36:56] wrong purposes it's like somebody comes
[1:36:58] to a church
[1:36:59] well if i come and we come into this
[1:37:00] church we'll make this wrong
[1:37:04] the church is what it is
[1:37:09] see these are things that we need the
[1:37:11] discernment
[1:37:12] and it takes the desert see it not only
[1:37:14] takes the discernment of the holy spirit
[1:37:17] we want to have that receiving part of
[1:37:19] it
[1:37:20] that part that's receptive that part
[1:37:23] that
[1:37:24] puts aside these things because as we go
[1:37:27] on you'll see
[1:37:28] how this comes it narrows on down oh i'm
[1:37:31] just so grateful
[1:37:32] that the holy spirit loves us enough
[1:37:35] brother drake he loves us
[1:37:36] enough for the day he loves us enough
[1:37:39] but shane aaron he loves us enough to
[1:37:43] say hey what about this oh lord
[1:37:47] and all of a sudden you say god forgive
[1:37:49] me see you wouldn't mean and to harbor
[1:37:50] it
[1:37:51] you weren't meaning for that but see god
[1:37:53] knowing your heart
[1:37:56] that your heart's desire is to please
[1:37:58] him
[1:38:01] you'll make sure there's nothing between
[1:38:02] you and him
[1:38:04] don't you love him i just appreciate him
[1:38:07] tonight
[1:38:09] charity envy is not i don't want that
[1:38:14] that's not welcome here at this address
[1:38:16] it's not welcome
[1:38:18] and we can say that but really i think
[1:38:20] of how brother branham prayed it in the
[1:38:21] message everlasting life
[1:38:24] there in that new year's eve service in
[1:38:25] jeffersonville he says oh god
[1:38:27] keep envy from us lord keep it out of
[1:38:30] here lord
[1:38:32] keep it from among us don't even because
[1:38:34] we're not naive friends to say
[1:38:36] well envy can't get in here he got in
[1:38:38] heaven
[1:38:41] it came in the garden
[1:38:45] it shows that no matter how innocent
[1:38:48] we need the discernment of the holy
[1:38:50] ghost
[1:38:52] but samuel what does that bring us down
[1:38:54] to not even to trust
[1:38:56] our own selves
