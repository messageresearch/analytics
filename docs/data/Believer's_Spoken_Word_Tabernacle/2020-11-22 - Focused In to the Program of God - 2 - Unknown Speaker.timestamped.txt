[28:05] Eden
[28:07] came
[28:08] because one put their s head of the word
[28:12] of God Satan came to draw to draw Eve
[28:16] out ground that wasn't Solid
[28:19] Ground death everything entered for one
[28:23] decision the Bible declares in the Book
[28:26] of Romans death in entered in all of
[28:29] this everything that we see even these
[28:31] bodies that we walk in now are the
[28:34] result of that
[28:36] decision thanks be to God there was
[28:38] another decision
[28:40] made before the devil ever became the
[28:45] devil there was already before there was
[28:48] atam Stardust or molecule for there was
[28:50] anything any Angels anything God already
[28:55] set forth the plan the lamb was slain in
[28:59] the mind of God before the foundation of
[29:01] the
[29:02] world Isaiah 53 does not speak of future
[29:06] tense it speaks as a past tense
[29:11] declaration you know why when God has
[29:14] thought it it doesn't matter what Satan
[29:16] can try to do he cannot stop
[29:21] it he can't
[29:24] stop he came against Abel
[29:28] thought I had him when I got aen he came
[29:31] against Seth he came against Noah he
[29:34] came against AB on and on and on and on
[29:37] I thought I had him you know why it was
[29:39] that
[29:40] life that he could not snuff
[29:43] out let me just tell you something trial
[29:47] after trial test after test persecution
[29:50] after persecution he can't take away or
[29:53] destroy that life Hallelujah GL

[32:54] amen amen if you will turn with me to
[32:57] Genesis
[32:58] 22 going to go back they in the
[33:01] scriptures here Genesis 22
[33:06] just moments here this
[33:13] morning verse we let you read a few
[33:15] verse of scripture then we'll let you
[33:17] have your seats verse one it says and it
[33:20] came to
[33:21] pass after these things that God did him
[33:28] Abraham that word temp means to try and
[33:33] the word that's used here is a word that
[33:36] means to
[33:38] aay which deals with when they go to
[33:42] look for uh samples of of minerals
[33:47] things that will would be in a land they
[33:50] take a great big drill bit but that
[33:52] drill bit going in also has the ability
[33:56] to take out what they call a core sample
[34:00] they can pull when they pull that bit
[34:02] out they can look at that core sample
[34:04] and though you can't see it on the
[34:06] surface sometimes these things are so so
[34:10] deep and but what you can't see on the
[34:13] surface the drilling down of the bit and
[34:16] pulling out reveal what's really down so
[34:20] the Bible says and it came to pass after
[34:23] these things that God did tempt Abraham
[34:26] see God wasn't wondering is this really
[34:29] an
[34:30] Abraham God already knew this from
[34:33] before the foundation of the world but
[34:36] God always always brings his
[34:42] word always brings his word to p and we
[34:47] his
[34:48] word and he said to Abraham and he said
[34:51] behold here I am but don't you just want
[34:55] to stay available to hear God's voice
[34:56] Lord I I just want to be simple just to
[34:59] stay available to be able to say here I
[35:00] am and he said take now thy son thine
[35:04] only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get
[35:08] thee into the land of Mariah and offer
[35:11] him therefore a burnt offering upon one
[35:15] of the mountains which I will tell thee
[35:19] of and Abraham rose up early in the
[35:22] morning and saddled his ass and took two
[35:25] of his young men with him and Isaac his
[35:27] son and clav the wood for the burnt
[35:30] offering and Rose up and went unto the
[35:33] place of which God had told him then on
[35:37] the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes
[35:41] and saw the place a far
[35:45] off so God told
[35:48] him go to the mountain that I tell thee
[35:51] of Remember When God speaks his word
[35:55] it's not just a letter but it becomes
[35:58] open a vision to you it's something that
[36:02] you can't explain you just know this is
[36:05] the this is the will of God just like
[36:07] when God opens his word to you you begin
[36:10] to take steps in that word what is that
[36:13] that's God opening and showing you and I
[36:16] he's telling us but he's opening to us
[36:19] that
[36:20] path sometimes there's things where you
[36:22] can see a vision before you maybe
[36:26] sometimes you would have a dream that
[36:27] God would speak to you concerning his
[36:30] word but when we look at this of the
[36:33] word it's just it's even in the the
[36:35] simpleness of where God would speak it's
[36:39] finished maybe it's healing in your body
[36:42] and it just that that scripture it just
[36:44] drops just like that say brother Samuel
[36:47] what is that that is the Lord appearing
[36:50] in his word and giving
[36:54] sight the Bible would say on and on with
[36:57] Abraham the Lord appeared to him that
[36:59] does not mean he came in a physical form
[37:02] in that particular verse the appearing
[37:04] is God coming in his word and speaking
[37:08] to Abraham God did show up to Abraham in
[37:12] in a flesh body God did show up to
[37:14] Abraham but there are times as God would
[37:17] speak to him and that word was so real
[37:19] to Abraham he journeyed Journey he kept
[37:23] walking amen we want to just speak this
[37:25] morning once again on F focus in into
[37:27] the program God may God bless you as
[37:31] you're being seated and we look into the
[37:33] word for a few
[37:35] moments Abraham in his
[37:39] journey uh certainly was a
[37:42] journey of faith faith itself is a
[37:46] very very
[37:49] marvelous thing it's a reality faith is
[37:53] a
[37:54] revelation sometimes we realize that
[37:57] there are things that have been called
[38:00] faith
[38:01] that uh it's really been more of hope
[38:06] there's things that for both of us or
[38:08] all of us that we have a measure we have
[38:12] human Faith human Faith itself is in the
[38:16] is in the intellectual realm and it it
[38:20] is a part that sometimes we can look at
[38:23] things uh in with human faith and feel
[38:26] so sure of about it but then situations
[38:29] can arise and we say I don't know about
[38:32] this I don't know did this really take
[38:35] place or did this really or did that but
[38:37] you see this is why it we we need more
[38:41] than just human Faith we're still going
[38:44] to have human Faith there's times where
[38:46] even at time for every one of us brother
[38:48] Brandon would say it like this in works
[38:49] as Faith expressed is that every one of
[38:52] us at times have tried to reach out for
[38:54] things of healing in our body and yet as
[38:58] brother Bradon would go on to tell us he
[39:00] would say now don't throw away that
[39:02] human Faith he said but just just let it
[39:06] become real
[39:08] Supernatural Well how can it become
[39:11] Supernatural faith I can't make it
[39:13] Supernatural Faith you can't make it
[39:15] Supernatural faith it takes God to come
[39:20] down behind our human Faith then it is
[39:26] not it is not our achievement then it is
[39:29] God's faith moving in our life that
[39:31] which you can't even explain how it is
[39:35] of the ground that you're standing on
[39:37] you you can't explain it but it's it's
[39:40] that which is so real to you that you
[39:42] are willing to stand there and say it's
[39:46] finished how do you know you don't even
[39:49] see it yet I don't know God dropped it
[39:52] and your rejoicing our worship is simply
[39:56] to know when that has come it's finished
[39:59] and we're no longer we're not just
[40:01] waiting until we see the physical
[40:06] appearing or manifestation we're already
[40:10] rejoicing in that right there that we
[40:13] cannot explain but we know that God has
[40:16] dropped it it's finished it's finished
[40:19] how can you explain that I can't and
[40:22] that's not my job am it's not my job
[40:31] oh my my my
[40:33] my Abraham was looking for the place
[40:36] that God showed him up he Abraham was so
[40:40] tuned into the word to where he begin to
[40:42] Journey he was looking for that place
[40:46] his here he was he was moving in a
[40:48] direction he was moving forward and then
[40:50] the Bible says when it come to that
[40:52] place remember there was mountains that
[40:54] was there Seven Peaks that was there and
[40:58] he says when he says I will show you
[41:02] when you come to those mountains I will
[41:04] show you I will hone in on that place
[41:07] where you to go where you to stand he
[41:10] said I'll show you Abraham walked you
[41:12] see this was not Genesis 22 was not
[41:16] something that you or I would have seen
[41:18] in this full expression in Genesis 11
[41:22] when God called him out but this God
[41:25] knew lay here the whole time God allowed
[41:29] situations to arise that would that
[41:32] would actually Force what God had on the
[41:36] inside that would bring it out and allow
[41:39] it to be expressed and this is why even
[41:42] in test and trials that we go through
[41:44] this is why the the spirit would
[41:47] admonish us through Peter it says
[41:49] regarding the trial of your faith it's
[41:51] more precious than gold tried in the
[41:55] fire that after the trial might be found
[41:58] to the praise and glory of God I'm
[42:00] telling you a gold and every you know
[42:03] it's just like now you hear bits and
[42:04] pieces everybody saying oh let's get
[42:06] gold or let's get gold I'm glad that we
[42:09] already have received gold we've already
[42:12] received the true gold F gold out there
[42:15] will never do anybody any good James
[42:19] said it corrupts and becomes motheaten
[42:21] but this go is God's own life this go is
[42:26] a go that brother it is a reward that's
[42:29] released to you and I that says your
[42:31] fair your passage out of this life is
[42:34] already taken care of and in the
[42:38] meantime all that you have need of you
[42:42] have the gold the token within you to
[42:45] take every
[42:47] promise the Holy Spirit and say this
[42:49] belongs to
[42:52] me Abraham was looking for this
[42:55] characteristic
[42:57] of the word you see Abraham was looking
[43:00] to see God he wasn't this was not about
[43:03] what mountain that he
[43:05] wanted this was the one that God spoke
[43:08] to him in the
[43:10] word
[43:13] now and let me read in Romans
[43:16] 4 verse 13 it says for the promise that
[43:21] he should be the heir of the
[43:23] world was not to Abraham or to his seed
[43:26] br through the
[43:28] law but through the
[43:30] righteousness of faith for if they which
[43:34] are of the law be heirs faith is made
[43:38] void and the promise made of none effect
[43:42] remember the promise came before there
[43:44] was ever a
[43:46] law Israel received the law they
[43:49] rejected Grace Exodus 19 Grace had
[43:53] provided for them what they had need of
[43:55] they turned it down and they received
[43:56] law law being something they
[44:02] could I don't want to depend on what I
[44:04] can
[44:05] do because let's just sum it up as the
[44:07] spirit of God spoke in Isaiah all our
[44:11] works that are our own made are filthy
[44:18] RS everything outside of his
[44:22] righteousness his
[44:24] life and so here the Bible goes on to
[44:28] say in verse 15 because the law worketh
[44:32] wrath for where no law is there is no
[44:37] transgression therefore it is a
[44:40] faith you know let me just simply put
[44:43] this in this manner would you rather
[44:45] have the law here or have the law
[44:49] himself the life the
[44:52] nature living in
[44:54] you I would rather have his life because
[44:58] the life is the lawgiver himself and
[45:01] when that life is on the inside it's not
[45:04] you trying to keep a law it's God inside
[45:09] and his nature his word is being kept by
[45:14] himself Glory therefore verse 16 it is a
[45:18] faith that it might be by grace to the
[45:23] end the promise might be sure to all the
[45:26] seed
[45:27] it's unmar favor not to that only which
[45:30] is of the law but to that which also
[45:33] which is of the faith of Abraham who is
[45:35] the father of us all as it is written I
[45:40] have made thee a father of many
[45:44] Nation before him whom he believed even
[45:47] God who quickeneth the dead and calleth
[45:50] those things which be not as though they
[45:53] were who against hope believed in Hope
[45:59] right against hope against what the
[46:02] expectation was the expectation was your
[46:06] body is going to continue to go
[46:09] downhill your body is going the opposite
[46:12] direction of the promise that I've
[46:14] called for
[46:15] Hallelujah and Abraham who against that
[46:19] expected course he believed in
[46:23] expectation amen he was tuned in to a
[46:27] different expectation
[46:30] amen he knew he had an expected
[46:34] end hallelujah we're not wondering as
[46:38] children of God what will our end be
[46:40] we've got an expected end the word has
[46:44] already spoken
[46:46] Hallelujah God ha prophesied amen are
[46:51] you with me God has already prophesied
[46:54] he took his word that he spoke in this
[46:57] generation and God took that promise and
[47:00] he prophesied over our life there will
[47:03] be a
[47:05] Rapture Hallelujah I already saw you
[47:08] there that's a word that's been
[47:10] prophesied the Lord has
[47:13] spoken who can speak
[47:20] contrary not even your thoughts of
[47:23] wondering where your thoughts sometimes
[47:25] where you look at yourself can stop the
[47:28] word of
[47:30] God are you with
[47:33] me Brother Sam you're preaching that
[47:35] awful straight because it's God's
[47:37] [Music]
[47:41] word you see the bride will not be
[47:43] standing there on that day Lord didn't I
[47:46] didn't I didn't I didn't I didn't I
[47:50] remember the didn't I are the ones
[47:52] who'll say get out of here that's right
[47:55] I never knew you because the bride is
[47:58] made to rest on the promise of her
[48:03] husband he said I your provider I am
[48:05] your house band I am the protection you
[48:09] are safe in me
[48:11] Hallelujah every promise belongs to my
[48:15] household
[48:19] yeah oh my according notice oh I love
[48:23] that who against hope believed in Hope
[48:26] that he might become the father of many
[48:30] nations according to that which was
[48:33] spoken so shall thy seed
[48:37] be God laid it all the way out spoke it
[48:40] all and it's going to come to pass and
[48:43] being not weak in
[48:47] faith that ain't talking about human
[48:50] Faith human Faith he's as weak as you
[48:54] and me right
[48:57] even in even if you've got real strong
[48:59] human faith is still
[49:02] weak and being not weak in faith he
[49:08] considered not his own body now dead
[49:12] when he was about 100 years old neither
[49:15] yet the deadness of Sarah's womb let me
[49:17] remind you not only was Sarah's womb
[49:21] dead but there was a time that there was
[49:23] still a stream of life going through AB
[49:27] ABR he fathered in
[49:31] Ishmael God finally had to let it
[49:35] die God let it dry up the Bible says his
[49:39] own body being now dead he did not have
[49:42] the ability to Father any more
[49:45] childrenall he was dead that is looks
[49:48] like God what are you doing the promise
[49:51] with the promise the promise but God
[49:53] said I made the promise and I will
[49:56] fulfill my
[49:59] promise Hallelujah God was letting an
[50:02] example be made known to you and I I'll
[50:04] take every bit of hope that you can see
[50:07] from around you that your expectation
[50:10] might be fully in me
[50:14] alone hallelujah
[50:17] hallelujah God glory be to God he
[50:20] consider
[50:22] not this word considered if means he did
[50:27] not even perceive
[50:29] into to try to
[50:33] understand if I can say it like this
[50:36] God's made a
[50:38] promise he didn't ask you to devise the
[50:42] details I don't care where this saying
[50:45] came from but I'm going to say it the
[50:47] devil's in the
[50:49] details are you with me the devil's in
[50:52] the details what do you mean by that
[50:54] brother Samuel I'm saying that when you
[50:56] go to try to figure it out you're off of
[50:59] your god-given
[51:01] ground and that gets you discouraged
[51:04] that will get you down because you are
[51:06] trying to look at how you can make it
[51:08] happen you're trying to look for a aray
[51:10] of hope that's natural within ourselves
[51:13] but down on the inside here when it
[51:17] comes into that place that's right there
[51:20] we're not trying we can try to say oh
[51:22] how will this be or how can we go this
[51:24] way and don't don't don't don't don't
[51:26] don't look any other way like oh I don't
[51:28] ever go that way we all go that
[51:30] way sometimes we all thought can cross
[51:32] your mind how do you
[51:34] know thoughts can cross your mind come
[51:36] on now right your your mind didn't get
[51:39] the Holy Ghost your body didn't get
[51:42] it but one day my body's going to be
[51:44] born again just like my soul
[51:47] wasall you're praying for healing and
[51:50] the question arises how is this going to
[51:52] be is it going to be a year from now
[51:55] I'll be this way or I'll be that way the
[51:57] devil's in the details what should I do
[51:59] cast it down God promised I don't know
[52:03] how it's going to be but I'm going to
[52:04] stand on that word because every time
[52:07] God brings his word to pass it blows up
[52:09] the mind of the people cuz it's not
[52:13] according to how you have it figured
[52:17] outen why would we do that as Believers
[52:20] we've
[52:21] learned we've learned been taught by him
[52:26] trust him
[52:28] him when he came in the days of his
[52:32] flesh he walked right among them they
[52:35] even wanted to take him many times and
[52:38] they crucified him because they had a
[52:41] way figured out and he didn't come
[52:44] according to how they think he ought to
[52:46] come he didn't come cloaked in their
[52:49] religious
[52:51] Garb but what he did come he came
[52:54] clothed in the vesture of his
[52:57] word he came according to the promise of
[52:59] his word and the Very one that they
[53:02] claimed to be looking for they rejected
[53:04] him they crucified
[53:07] him but here were some that were not
[53:09] renowned people they were not on the
[53:12] who's who
[53:14] list he passed by their way he had an
[53:18] appointment he let him know there's an
[53:20] invitation for
[53:21] you me like the woman at the world me me
[53:26] but what's he doing he knows what's
[53:30] beneath down in the depths of her life
[53:33] all it takes is to get in his presence
[53:37] one
[53:38] time one time all the holds and all the
[53:42] bondage all the darkness everything else
[53:45] it was just tearing loose because why
[53:49] you can't listen to me now closely you
[53:52] can't stop God from bringing his word to
[53:55] pass amen amen as many as received him
[54:01] to them he gave the power to
[54:05] become sons of God Amen become God
[54:09] becomes his word to every generation God
[54:12] becomes it's God becoming in
[54:16] you
[54:17] Hallelujah now now and his own body now
[54:21] dead when he was about a 100 years old
[54:23] neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb
[54:25] he staggered not at the promise of God
[54:27] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[54:31] whose Faith God's
[54:35] faith God's faith this was not his own
[54:40] faith are you with me it's not your own
[54:43] faith oh brother Samuel I received the
[54:45] Lord Jesus Christ my that wasn't your
[54:47] own
[54:48] faith I believe the satification that
[54:51] wasn't your own
[54:52] faith oh I've received the Holy Ghost it
[54:55] wasn't you it was God receiving himself
[54:57] in you right amen it's all the work of
[55:01] God we are his
[55:04] workmanship it's us yielding to the plan
[55:07] and program of God
[55:11] Amen God already knows where you fit in
[55:14] this building I'm not talking about this
[55:15] building I'm talking about that
[55:17] spiritual building that spiritual house
[55:19] he already
[55:21] knows like Solomon Stones were hewed out
[55:24] from here from here from here from here
[55:26] and they brought them all together under
[55:28] what under an inspiration a vision given
[55:31] to David and God said the man of rest
[55:34] Solomon thy son will build this
[55:37] Temple Solomon took what David provided
[55:41] and he assembled those stones those
[55:44] different walks of life but they all
[55:46] came together and that's why Peter said
[55:48] we are Lively
[55:51] Stones not our life is his life not our
[55:55] glory is it's his
[55:58] glory Oh Glory was strong in faith
[56:02] giving glory to God being fully
[56:05] persuaded that what he had promised he
[56:08] was able to perform and therefore it was
[56:11] imputed unto him for
[56:15] righteousness B says it like this in the
[56:17] message look he
[56:20] says his faith talking of Abraham of a
[56:24] Believer his faith can only be based
[56:26] upon one thing that's the
[56:29] word he says now I feel like a shouting
[56:32] Baptist when you get to that word that's
[56:36] the living
[56:39] thing that's what the Holy Ghost comes
[56:43] to do make The Word
[56:48] Alive amen he makes the promise alive
[56:53] until that time the word is just laying
[56:55] there people AR can look at it oh my
[56:58] aose of God but when God comes in to
[57:02] make that Word Alive then the word
[57:04] itself is no longer a seed that's
[57:08] waiting to be raised to life but it
[57:11] already has that life in it and when he
[57:13] Broods over his word and brings his word
[57:16] to pass it has an effect upon the
[57:19] believer when they stood there on the
[57:22] day of Pentecost what was taking place
[57:24] it was God broing on the promise of Jo
[57:28] to and the brooding on that promise it
[57:31] brought forth lives vessels surrendered
[57:35] yielded that the god of that promise
[57:37] might pour himself by his word into
[57:41] their lives and they could say that
[57:44] which ye now see and
[57:48] hear is Joel too they had a word
[57:54] experience an exp expence identified in
[57:58] the word that declared
[58:02] itself Oh My My My when your mind and
[58:06] eyes can be single to that word and
[58:09] focus that in until you see exactly what
[58:13] God is doing what a wonderful
[58:16] thing Abraham saw it look at this
[58:19] Abraham saw
[58:21] it he did not look to any of the
[58:24] misunderstandings of the promise I love
[58:26] how brother Brown puts this here now
[58:27] watch he did not look to any of the
[58:30] misunderstandings of the promise there
[58:31] was a lot there was misunderstandings
[58:33] all around
[58:35] him there was misunderstandings all
[58:38] around
[58:39] him what look at this what if he would
[58:43] have looked and said here I'm 75 years
[58:46] old and such and such a voice spoke to
[58:48] me said I'm to have a baby by my wife
[58:51] she's 65 years old about 15 or 20 years
[58:55] past minut PA what would he have
[59:02] done if he would have looked at that
[59:05] what would he have done were those
[59:06] things all around they were were those
[59:09] things true they were right
[59:12] amen there's a lot of things about you
[59:14] and me that's
[59:17] true come on now we're not trying to
[59:20] change that it's to receive this change
[59:22] on the inside and rule over the other
[59:25] amen y because God will see fit that the
[59:28] other part that we are ruling reigning
[59:30] and bringing subject he said I'll change
[59:32] it just like I changed you just like I
[59:35] transformed your life what must I do oh
[59:37] God this feeling comes back this comes
[59:39] back some what must I do reain by my
[59:42] spirit Hallelujah bringing it subjection
[59:44] to the word
[59:47] amen and one of these moments you'll
[59:49] receive a body to match the work on the
[59:54] inside What would he have
[59:57] done I don't know maybe he' have joined
[59:59] a church
[1:00:00] group you know one of the subgroups we
[1:00:03] meet every Tuesday to talk about the
[1:00:05] wowy weed and the wowy Woos oh I'm so
[1:00:08] this and I'm so that anybody else ever
[1:00:11] had a problem yeah I've got problems

[1:00:15] all join hands and cry we all got
[1:00:17] problems
[1:00:20] duh d every one of us I don't care how
[1:00:22] you look this morning you know it
[1:00:25] doesn't matter how you even look look at
[1:00:26] me like oh brother Samuel he's always on
[1:00:28] the mountain top he don't ever have
[1:00:29] problems don't you let the devil paint
[1:00:31] that
[1:00:33] picture it has to battle just the same
[1:00:36] as you do has to battle through mind
[1:00:39] battles thoughts other things else
[1:00:41] things that comes up in the body and
[1:00:43] everything else has to battle even in
[1:00:45] life but there is one thing that is
[1:00:47] certain that you every one of us can
[1:00:49] look at and God helps us and and
[1:00:52] strengthens us to be more inclined to
[1:00:56] depend on
[1:01:00] him what would he have
[1:01:03] done I ain't going to throw this cuz I
[1:01:05] don't want to pick it up baby what's the
[1:01:07] use there ain't nothing going my way my
[1:01:11] wife there's the promise look at the
[1:01:13] promise look at all this I got going on
[1:01:15] in my life my wife's passed menopause
[1:01:18] look at me look at me Abraham you're
[1:01:22] looking at the wrong
[1:01:24] thing if you look at negative come on
[1:01:27] now it ain't the negative don't come our
[1:01:30] way right but if you look at the
[1:01:32] negative what you focus on you will
[1:01:34] become that's true if you feed on
[1:01:38] negative things come on this is the
[1:01:39] Bible if you feed on negative things you
[1:01:42] become
[1:01:44] negative and there's everything you look
[1:01:46] in the world today it's
[1:01:49] negative you feed on it you become
[1:01:51] negative you don't recognize it but it
[1:01:54] starts carrying over in your spirit walk
[1:01:56] you start looking at the promise of God
[1:01:59] negatively not like what I don't believe
[1:02:01] it no you start looking at it in regards
[1:02:03] to your own life you're not feeding on
[1:02:05] the right Source you've got to feed on
[1:02:07] the source of Life you've got to talk to
[1:02:10] the one and feed on the one who has made
[1:02:13] you who you
[1:02:14] [Applause]
[1:02:17] are what are you doing I'm journeying to
[1:02:20] the
[1:02:22] mountain I'm on my way to the mountain
[1:02:26] glory be to
[1:02:29] God but what did he do he never paid any
[1:02:34] attention to what the Natural Things
[1:02:38] was he looked at what God Said did you
[1:02:42] catch that he looked at what God Said
[1:02:46] looked at it it becomes such a reality
[1:02:50] to him till he didn't see nothing else
[1:02:54] but what God Said
[1:02:56] amen what was he doing just like I said
[1:02:59] last week he was focusing
[1:03:01] in the the further as he was walking
[1:03:05] with God the peripheral of things that
[1:03:08] were out here it became
[1:03:10] peripheral he kept his eyes
[1:03:14] focused he kept looking this is an hour
[1:03:18] you remember what I just read to you a
[1:03:19] quote above this last week when the
[1:03:21] Church of the Living God begins to see
[1:03:23] the things taking place that are they
[1:03:26] bind themselves tighter with the word
[1:03:29] that's the only sure ground church I
[1:03:32] said that's the only sure
[1:03:41] ground he left his home he separated
[1:03:44] himself from all unbelief anything that
[1:03:47] would try to pull him away he separated
[1:03:50] himself so he could walk along God
[1:03:53] didn't separate him
[1:03:57] he separated himself right are you with
[1:04:00] me this is why when God would say in uh
[1:04:03] was the 1 Corinthians 6 separate
[1:04:09] yourselves it's things that God had
[1:04:11] given see the word the promise that God
[1:04:14] had given him brother when that word
[1:04:16] comes in it now remember our senses by
[1:04:20] eating on the strong meat our senses are
[1:04:23] exercised to discern good and
[1:04:27] evil I mean let's face it you know in
[1:04:30] the natural eating you might say oh I
[1:04:32] really want that oh I really want to do
[1:04:34] this you know the effect it's going to
[1:04:36] have on
[1:04:37] you some of us at least you know well
[1:04:41] how much more
[1:04:42] naturally how was Abraham able to
[1:04:47] separate God gave him
[1:04:50] strength how was it when all this arose
[1:04:53] with lot and now lot this this Strife
[1:04:57] arises you see it took the discernment
[1:04:59] of the
[1:05:00] word to move I'm not going to I I can't
[1:05:03] even begin to try to explain that only
[1:05:05] thing I know I know that by experience
[1:05:08] it had to be the word that gave him
[1:05:11] discernment gave him strength as far as
[1:05:14] naturally brother B tells us and you
[1:05:16] know this to be the truth in your own
[1:05:18] self he said that was hard for Abraham
[1:05:21] to separate from lot right he loved him
[1:05:26] right but God allowed that situation to
[1:05:30] arise and the word gave
[1:05:33] discernment and here the word itself
[1:05:35] acting showing the word gave discernment
[1:05:38] and Abraham's life he said whichever way
[1:05:41] you
[1:05:42] choose you go north I'm going to go
[1:05:45] south you go east you go what's he
[1:05:49] saying I can't be tangled up with
[1:05:51] conflict
[1:05:53] right you see the word is giving
[1:05:56] discernment
[1:05:57] conflict turmoil trouble vacation in
[1:06:01] your spirit it
[1:06:03] hinders God from speaking to you you
[1:06:08] want to be like Abraham over and over
[1:06:10] Abraham here I
[1:06:13] am here I am I'm right here I'm in a
[1:06:16] place that I can receive from God now
[1:06:19] you and I both know there we can't go
[1:06:21] live in a bubble and we don't walk in a
[1:06:24] Utopia right right we don't all around
[1:06:27] us is problems and troubles and
[1:06:29] everything else and sometimes when
[1:06:30] things seem like they're going so around
[1:06:31] and then all of a sudden something comes
[1:06:34] along right we don't live in a perfect
[1:06:36] Utopia we don't live in a in a we do not
[1:06:39] live in a place that oh this is a
[1:06:42] perfect place this is a perfect
[1:06:45] condition for me to be a son or daughter
[1:06:47] of God no God says I can put my children
[1:06:50] down in the midst of Babylon like Daniel
[1:06:53] I can put they can be placed there under
[1:06:56] a hot furnace they can be placed they
[1:06:58] don't need perfect conditions out
[1:07:02] here hallah oh Glory they don't need the
[1:07:06] perfect conditions out here they're not
[1:07:08] dependent on the light of the Sun by day
[1:07:11] nor the Moon by night nor the Stars
[1:07:13] they're not even dependent on the
[1:07:15] Candlestick but they have my Light
[1:07:19] Within them that's why David said in
[1:07:22] Psalms 27 the Lord is my
[1:07:27] li who shall I be afraid
[1:07:30] of he's my salvation
[1:07:34] amen and let's just be honest he saved
[1:07:37] us and he keeps on saving us yes amen
[1:07:40] amen come on now Paul said he delivered
[1:07:43] me from the mouth of the lion right Paul
[1:07:46] was not walking in the same Lion's Den
[1:07:49] that Daniel walked but it was the same
[1:07:51] anointing that had put Daniel there that
[1:07:54] came upon
[1:07:56] that came against Paul and Paul said God
[1:07:58] ha delivered me the same Angel of the
[1:08:01] Lord out of the mouth of the lion
[1:08:07] amen God made him a promise in the word
[1:08:10] when he would go to the Gentiles I will
[1:08:13] deliver thee from the people in whom
[1:08:14] thou are
[1:08:18] sent that's what every genuine believer
[1:08:20] has to do separate him separate yourself
[1:08:23] from these doubters and unbelievers and
[1:08:26] walk with Christ it's life to you what
[1:08:29] made Abraham make that decision the
[1:08:32] promise the promise gave him strength
[1:08:36] virtue to make hard decisions that human
[1:08:40] Faith would have struggled
[1:08:42] with human Faith Can
[1:08:48] reason Abraham did such a thing 25 years
[1:08:51] later we find him still believing the
[1:08:53] promise why he had focused his mind Mind
[1:08:56] through the will of God by the word of
[1:08:59] God and
[1:09:01] believe
[1:09:02] God God had appeared to him spoke to him
[1:09:08] in his word remember it was what God
[1:09:11] said he did not have a
[1:09:14] Bible oh come out of the land of er C no
[1:09:17] that's you and me
[1:09:18] reading right but you see without the
[1:09:22] same God speaking to us the same way he
[1:09:24] spoke to Abraham we can have the Bible
[1:09:26] but we read it just like a
[1:09:28] book this is why we need the god of the
[1:09:31] word to identify himself in the word and
[1:09:35] speak to us because the word is made to
[1:09:39] speak amen what God spoke to Abraham it
[1:09:43] was only unfolding in Abraham's life as
[1:09:46] Abraham walked God was taking the seals
[1:09:48] off of his
[1:09:51] life
[1:09:53] hallelujah oh my and he had focused his
[1:09:56] mind to the will of God the word of God
[1:09:58] God stepping in his word you see
[1:10:02] listen what God steps in his word to
[1:10:05] make known is what he's calling from the
[1:10:08] very character and life that's within
[1:10:12] you and
[1:10:13] me this is not
[1:10:15] something different like where I say oh
[1:10:18] you want this box of clean brother Aaron
[1:10:20] brother says wow yes and I go okay here
[1:10:22] you
[1:10:23] go said that ain't the same same
[1:10:26] thing you with me brother Dre that ain't
[1:10:28] the same thing God when God comes to
[1:10:31] make his promise
[1:10:33] known what he is doing he is calling to
[1:10:36] that Inside Man and let that Inside Man
[1:10:40] know this is who I've called you to be
[1:10:43] are you with me I'm not talking about
[1:10:45] Eagle stories it takes an eagle to fly
[1:10:49] over Eagle Stories won't do it it takes
[1:10:53] an eagle it takes a living God it took a
[1:10:56] living God in this generation it was not
[1:10:59] the banner of a church or an
[1:11:01] organization but it was the banner of
[1:11:03] the Lord and we can say His Banner Over
[1:11:08] Me his love his standard his
[1:11:11] inside Over Me Is
[1:11:15] Love if we can focus oursel to the plan
[1:11:18] of God to what God wants for us and what

[1:20:19] is where Jesus
[1:20:21] said I walk in the world but I'm not the
[1:20:26] world Jesus Luke 15 the Bible says in
[1:20:31] Luke 15 I believe it is that the Sinners

[1:20:49] God behind your
[1:20:50] skin are you with me it's a spiritual
[1:20:53] power it's a life that's behind there

[1:27:44] Hallelujah didn't let unbelief
[1:27:47] contaminated am oh father of nation how
[1:27:51] long's it been now
[1:27:54] oh I'd say Abraham probably got to a
[1:27:57] point where he
[1:27:58] said I'm getting off of
[1:28:02] Facebook is that all
[1:28:04] right or maybe he said de friend de
[1:28:09] friend de friend de friend where is your
[1:28:14] y the Y of God Abraham he said the love
[1:28:18] of God does not put you above his word
[1:28:22] you're speaking against his word
[1:28:24] then you're above God and the love of
[1:28:27] God says love the Lord thy God with
[1:28:31] all preach brother Samuel sometimes we
[1:28:34] give too much junk place in our
[1:28:39] life whether it's junk from Friends junk
[1:28:41] from family junk from everything else
[1:28:44] it's where we have to be dialed in you
[1:28:46] see he was not going to let himself
[1:28:49] become contaminated
[1:28:52] right like you can going for a surgery
[1:28:54] or something or some kind of thing and
[1:28:57] then you all of a sudden you let this
[1:28:58] pop
[1:29:01] up and you go to start reading it does
[1:29:04] it build Faith well you know I'm just
[1:29:06] trying to find out what it is is opening
[1:29:08] a door for
[1:29:11] fear because you start me going in that
[1:29:15] direction listen if whatever the pathway
[1:29:18] that God chooses for your healing it's
[1:29:20] all a miracle from God
[1:29:26] go to one of these corpses put all the
[1:29:27] antibiotic put all the cream you want to
[1:29:29] put on them they got a cut put it on
[1:29:31] them that stuff don't
[1:29:34] heal life is the
[1:29:37] Healer medicine is an
[1:29:41] aid God ain't get against
[1:29:44] medicine and Hezekiah needed needed help
[1:29:47] God told that God go God told Isaiah
[1:29:49] Isaiah go get some figs tell him get
[1:29:52] some figs and put them on all right
[1:29:55] brother Brown would even say see he said
[1:29:57] God's not against medicine he spit in
[1:29:59] the ground he said from the elements of
[1:30:01] where medicine is made God spit on that
[1:30:04] and put it on the Man's eyes he said God
[1:30:06] is in
[1:30:07] medicine you see this is where it takes
[1:30:10] a prophet to come in this hour and
[1:30:12] balances it out where the devil say oh
[1:30:15] you don't got faith if you really have
[1:30:17] faith you wouldn't need medicine you'd
[1:30:18] say listen my faith says I need God I
[1:30:21] have God he has me whatever they AV it
[1:30:25] is a
[1:30:27] miracle
[1:30:30] Hall he looked to one thing and that was
[1:30:33] the voice that spoke to him that's what
[1:30:37] the church ought to do today look to the
[1:30:39] one thing the voice the word of God
[1:30:42] speaks churches and people they can they
[1:30:45] can speak anyway but look to the voice

[1:36:15] Hunchback he knew what it was each
[1:36:17] morning to have to get out of bed say oh
[1:36:25] had maybe got to a place he had to think
[1:36:29] about
[1:36:33] step when the Bible says he called
[1:36:35] Everything contrary as though it were
[1:36:38] not he did not it was not Abraham saying
[1:36:41] oh I don't have an ache in my
[1:36:45] back honey what's wrong oh nothing
[1:36:52] nothing no

[1:37:28] is greater than the
[1:37:33] cancer oh I had a pain in my back oh
[1:37:37] maybe I need to take a muscle relax or I
[1:37:39] need to take a a pain pain feel or I
[1:37:41] need to take something you know to
[1:37:42] straighten that back out or are you
[1:37:45] doubting no God made a
[1:37:48] promise whether I see it now or I see it

[1:38:13] legs
[1:38:15] hurting but you see listen to me now
[1:38:19] that was
[1:38:21] not the theme of the day are you with
[1:38:27] me no matter what Rose that was
[1:38:30] contrary that ache in his back or
[1:38:32] whatever that's a misunderstanding to
[1:38:35] the
[1:38:36] promise are you with me it's something
[1:38:39] that looks contrary I'm getting strong
[1:38:41] I'm getting weaker get but you see the
[1:38:44] faith of God listen this is where human
[1:38:46] Faith would fail human Faith would have
[1:38:49] succumbed to
[1:38:50] that but he not being weak in faith
[1:38:53] whose Faith was
[1:38:59] that you know how it is you you could be
[1:39:02] prayed for right here and and you and
[1:39:04] you you should have
[1:39:05] faith but think sometimes on maybe on a
[1:39:07] Monday morning oh oh that that ringing
[1:39:11] came back oh I don't know may maybe I
[1:39:14] was just in the thought yeah maybe you
[1:39:16] were just worked up yeah maybe this just
[1:39:19] what's he trying to do work on that
[1:39:21] human Faith to see if that's where if
[1:39:22] that's where it's at
[1:39:24] brother brother Samuel what should I do
[1:39:26] I just keep confessing
[1:39:28] it confess it he's the high priest of
[1:39:32] our
[1:39:34] profession confess means to say the same
[1:39:38] thing and do what confess it until you
[1:39:42] actually believe
[1:39:44] it confess it until God's faith steps
[1:39:47] down behind
[1:39:51] it you see this is why the new birth is
[1:39:54] not our faith it's God's
[1:39:59] faith you can't give
[1:40:01] up you can't quit you didn't start it
[1:40:04] this isn't your work it's an anchor this
[1:40:07] is why Paul called it an
[1:40:09] anchor an
[1:40:12] anchor that
[1:40:14] holds
[1:40:16] steadfast in the veil oh God so what do
[1:40:20] I do well if you get sick

[1:42:33] the ET se but God but God
[1:42:37] came he's the
[1:42:38] [Music]
[1:42:42] same so no matter what promise or what
[1:42:45] adversary no matter what raises its head
[1:42:48] Paul would write it like this and Paul
[1:42:49] would identify whether it's test trial
[1:42:52] all those things at the end of Romans 8
[1:42:55] he never said what shall separate us he
[1:42:59] said
[1:43:00] who because it's the enemy trying to
[1:43:03] move in different Avenues but Paul
[1:43:06] recogniz who shall
[1:43:10] separate from the love of God that we
[1:43:13] have in Christ aren't you grateful for
[1:43:14] the love of
[1:43:15] God oh I
[1:43:17] just I thank
[1:43:20] God to know that it's him
[1:43:25] if I can say it this plainly the way
[1:43:27] that the prophet said it it's become
[1:43:28] more and more real to me it's God in you
[1:43:33] believing his own
[1:43:36] [Music]
[1:43:40] word oh brother saidel I receiv received
[1:43:42] the Holy Ghost no it was God in you
[1:43:46] receiving himself into his place
[1:43:50] [Music]
[1:43:53] it's
[1:43:54] God I say this morning it's just it's
[1:43:56] just that simple if you're willing to
[1:43:59] die if you don't have that if you don't
[1:44:00] have that ground you're willing to die
[1:44:02] that's what it has to take not God will
[1:44:04] not come and add on top of your will but
[1:44:07] he wants your will
[1:44:10] surrendered and when you're willing to
[1:44:12] surrender your will what does that mean
[1:44:13] brother Samuel to where you
[1:44:15] realize I don't want no more
[1:44:19] ishmaelites I'm not qu trying to Father
[1:44:22] an ishel trying to make this happen and
[1:44:24] trying to oh I'm going to try to do this
[1:44:26] and I'm they don't last so long the law
[1:44:29] is based on times at this time go do
[1:44:33] this at this time go offer this Thou
[1:44:35] shalt not do this it's based on times
[1:44:38] Seasons it's based on the natural
[1:44:40] positionings of lights and stars where
[1:44:42] the Moon is at Harvest it's based on
[1:44:45] Seasons that are God set forth as a
[1:44:49] sign that in him when the grace of God
[1:44:52] is coming
[1:44:54] you're no longer walking those by those
[1:44:57] lights out there you're walking by his
[1:44:58] light in the season of his
[1:45:04] word what a what a rest it is it's not
[1:45:08] me it's not you trying to I got to bring
[1:45:10] forth fruit no no no what I have to do
[1:45:13] drink drink push up drink drink push out
[1:45:18] drink drink push out
[1:45:21] Samuel sometimes it just seems like I
[1:45:23] can't I can't see
[1:45:25] fruit you got your eyes on the wrong
[1:45:28] spot keep your eyes on The
[1:45:31] Voice God will allow you in situations
[1:45:36] and as older veterans I talk to these
[1:45:39] are not situations that you and I would
[1:45:40] elect necessarily to come into but God
[1:45:43] allows fruit to be made
[1:45:45] manifest in The
[1:45:47] Valleys in times of test and times of
[1:45:51] trouble and God lets it be
[1:45:54] proven whose faith is really
[1:45:58] there faith brother Aaron like they
[1:46:00] could ask brother brand brother Shan
[1:46:03] they would ask him in the car pull up
[1:46:05] next hey Billy has your religion holding
[1:46:07] you
[1:46:09] now he
[1:46:12] says I'm not holding on he's holding

[1:46:18] me glory be to
[1:46:21] God there's been times like that there
[1:46:24] will be times like that matter of fact
[1:46:26] the more that we become aware that it's
[1:46:30] him so every time when we start to try
[1:46:33] and do thing we getting away we get we
[1:46:35] getting
[1:46:36] away God has to allow that part about
[1:46:40] us just kind of die away you know God
[1:46:44] has to allow it to get to a spot in our
[1:46:45] life to
[1:46:46] [Music]
[1:46:50] where the womb on the inside the Sarah
[1:46:54] on the inside says put ishmail
[1:46:58] out are you with me put him out what do
[1:47:02] you mean put him out don't look at him

[1:47:17] Sarah's this was s i I can do this I can
[1:47:22] do that that was SAR eyes

[1:47:45] raise your
[1:47:46] hands because Isaac needs to borrow your
[1:47:49] hands right
[1:47:51] now but eventually
[1:47:53] God's going to give me an Isaac that
[1:47:55] matches the Isaac on the inside
[1:47:58] hallelujah amen a body fashion like his
[1:48:02] own glorious body you love him this
[1:48:06] morning Heavenly
[1:48:09] Father Lord behind the hearts of your
[1:48:13] children Lord perhaps there's a heart a
[1:48:16] life that's here or
[1:48:18] streaming that that's a longing
[1:48:20] it's they it's raised up in their life
[1:48:22] life there's a
[1:48:25] yearning Lord God from what they have
[1:48:28] craved or desired but never knew how to
[1:48:31] put it in words sought it in different
[1:48:35] Avenues but that thirst could never be
[1:48:39] quenched there's only one that can
[1:48:41] quench that
[1:48:42] thirst World material things of the
[1:48:45] world are never
[1:48:46] satisfied you're the only
[1:48:49] one that's how you placed it
[1:48:53] I pray God this morning that as that
[1:48:55] Lord would become more
[1:48:59] real in their life and before
[1:49:03] them Lord Jesus that's you in your
[1:49:07] word making your word your promise
[1:49:13] real it's the same life of the
[1:49:16] Messiah it's the same Lord Jesus right
[1:49:20] here Among Us the same God appearing in
[1:49:25] his
[1:49:26] word drawing upon that heart or a life a
[1:49:30] word in itself cannot do
[1:49:32] that but it's
[1:49:34] you Lord I
[1:49:37] pray may they let
[1:49:40] themselves be focused to the will of
[1:49:44] God may they Lord allow their lives may
[1:49:47] they so focus in by the word of God and
[1:49:50] say Lord

[1:49:58] life I want to be so full of your spirit
[1:50:01] Lord let the pitch from that great
[1:50:06] Eternal tree let that
[1:50:10] life come and fill every fiber of my
[1:50:14] being let that pitch that
[1:50:17] atonement let it seal me into you Lord
[1:50:20] sealing you in me
[1:50:23] granted Lord I pray for that life Lord
[1:50:27] God all the Simplicity is is them coming
[1:50:29] to the end of their way and saying
[1:50:32] Lord I don't want another ishmail I want
[1:50:36] Isaac to come
[1:50:37] forth I want the promise according to
[1:50:40] the
[1:50:41] word Grant it this morning Lord to their
[1:50:44] life and heart and
[1:50:46] Lord as we're standing here I know even
[1:50:49] on the internet different ones listening
[1:50:53] there's some different needs among your
[1:50:54] body some that are
[1:50:57] sick some Lord that are just
[1:51:00] down
[1:51:04] discouraged I pray that
[1:51:06] Lord may you minister to them in a
[1:51:09] special way may they reach out to
[1:51:12] you and as Abraham would call everything
[1:51:17] contrary may they be like Abraham Lord

[1:51:26] body I'm feeling
[1:51:29] weary Lord I need strength I need you to
[1:51:35] strengthen me like you've done before I
[1:51:38] need a fresh touch
[1:51:40] Lord dear God this is not
[1:51:47] weakness that's not that's not weakness
[1:51:49] as far as you're a weak Christian
[1:51:53] no that's a life that's dependent on
[1:51:57] you faith is not denying if there's a
[1:52:01] cancer in the body and faith is not well
[1:52:03] I don't have cancer that's not Faith
[1:52:05] that's human faith not God's faith but
[1:52:09] God's faith is able to look at something
[1:52:12] that could be so close in the sales of
[1:52:15] the body and to
[1:52:17] know there is one greater in
[1:52:21] me than cancer there's one that's
[1:52:25] greater in me than any virus any
[1:52:28] sickness any devil that could raise its
[1:52:31] head there's one in me that is
[1:52:34] greater he already forgave me of all my
[1:52:39] iniquities and he's the Lord that Health
[1:52:41] me of all my
[1:52:45] diseases greater is he that is in
[1:52:49] you as Abraham walking with balance in
[1:52:53] the
[1:52:55] promise I think of the scriptures Lord
[1:52:58] where it says if there be any sick among
[1:53:01] you how would we know that unless
[1:53:04] somebody could say brother Samuel
[1:53:06] brother Joey or brother so and so would
[1:53:08] you pray for me I'm not feeling
[1:53:10] well what they're talking about is their
[1:53:13] body these bodies are still
[1:53:16] sin these bodies are susceptible to
[1:53:19] sickness our bodies Our Spirits our mind
