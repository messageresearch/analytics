[Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] sweep [Music] is [Music] my amen no greater request that we could have tonight amen that the lord would just pass by our way amen and i believe that you know that god has this meeting it's already been arranged by him you know we we planned this week to have uh to have meetings this coming weekend and of course i've announced that here ever since last thursday that brother homer's not going to be here but this was arranged i believe by god here tonight and i believe that just i believe it's that way even for every every service sometimes we we we maybe miss that part of it but to understand that god is mindful and to know that this night he already had this night as he did every other part within his mind god has arranged it just as much as when you you've heard me say it time and time again when brother branham would talk about having the handkerchief in a certain place and the glasses in a certain place god himself has orchestrated this it is all under his leading for this moment tonight and the greatest thing we can do is you know it's just like they take a camera and they'll set it out there you know in a field and they want to try to catch that as the stars and the sky is passing by they'll open the aperture up and the eye and it'll just catch that whole progression of light and that flow across the sky we just want to capture what god is going to do here in this moment lord let my soul let my life just be like that great aperture that just takes in what it is that you desire for me to have and to experience here tonight amen we we certainly thank god for brother andrew and we appreciate him being able to be here with us and that was just kind of a range that was touch and go everything really wasn't finalized until uh until yesterday um i might have it was yesterday even or tuesday evening one of the days and i knew kind of knew about it and i was praying lord help brother justin get that car fixed so brother justin and sister rebecca are here for us with us here from brother jim schumacher there in pennsylvania there are no strangers here among us either and we're glad to have you all tonight and we just want to pull on the gift of god amen we just we want to pull and just ask that the lord will just come by and meet each and every need tonight brother grant brother andrew he's no stranger among us either you know each time i tell him you're at home you take your liberty and so we just we just want we just want god to have his way tonight so good to see each and every one of you amen i pray that god will just pour out just a great blessing amen tonight for every knee whatever your need is there's no need too small nor is there a need that's too great for god you just invite him to your to your to your heart right where you're at he'll come brother bran told us in the message the breach he said he'll advance all the way from glory like he did to blind bartimaeus that day when blind bartimaeus was setting by the wall of jericho he was sitting there brother ram describes it a cool october morning and how that there's no way that jesus could hear the cry of blind bartimaeus but it was his faith that carried the touch and it turned jesus around amen that wasn't the only time the sun had been stopped this was now the second time the sun had been stopped and we've got needs here tonight and the lord jesus is mindful and he's present amen to minister to our needs i i believe that tonight we want him to advance all the way from glory right to our lives tonight amen could we just as we just would just stand and let's just sing a song i'd like to sing that song i shall forever lift my eyes amazing it shall always be my song of praise [Music] amazing grace oh it shall war waste me my songs [Music] it was grace [Music] [Music] [Applause] oh i do not know just why he came to love me so hope and i'm glad he looks beyond [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah oh i shall [Applause] [Music] of [Music] won't sing it out from your heart [Applause] [Music] amen once again i shall forever [Applause] [Music] [Music] to you the cross where jesus died [Music] [Applause] the grace [Music] all [Music] amen how many thankful the lord done that for you amen i heard that song sung one time and i think the bride's version of that is he looked beyond all our faults and saw a seed amen amen a seed he had placed there from before the foundation of the world and men that would recognize him in the age when he would pour out his inspiration there would be a seed here to catch it amen i'm glad to be a part of that seed gene of god aren't you this evening amen where would we be this evening if it wasn't for him amen amen god bless you this evening we greet you in the name of the lord amen if you have your bibles while you're standing with us we'll go straight to the word amen we'll invite you to the book of malachi the fourth chapter and while you're turning there this evening we want to greet you in the name of the lord we sure counted an honor to be here with you all this midweek service i tell you i'm i'm a believer that's thankful for midweek services amen a little shot in the arm amen not just a little religious gathering but a place of revival a refreshing in the presence of the lord and we sure appreciate with the samuel the opportunity to speak to you tonight from the message of the hour and as he said the lord knows all things and as he was speaking there before we came out it was almost like he was reading right through my notes i even had went through the story of blind bartimaeus today and heard brother brahm tell that exact story and i believe the lord's in our midst tonight and amen we just have something on our heart this evening we pray will be a blessing and edification to the church before we read the word let's just buy our hearts together in our humble our spiritual presence tonight how he would say lord i'm expecting to hear from you tonight amen i want to hear your voice amen heavenly father lord as your believers have gathered here this afternoon lord on this midweek evening lord we know that the world is father going about their daily activities father lord finishing up their work day and school day father they're gathering in homes tonight lord around television programs and things of the world of filth and ungodliness the lord here stands before me a group of people tonight that if lord been making preparation as i heard your prophet say this morning on tape he said as he was opening in prayer he said a people that's been preparing to come here and listen father i believe there's a group of people here tonight before me that has been lord preparing themselves father not to come and hear a man or to hear lord a sermon from an individual preacher but lord they've been preparing to gather themselves together in your house to hear from heaven lord father as i've studied and prepared myself lord now father i pray you would help me to get myself out of the way lord may your anointing come in this building tonight may you drive out every spirit of the enemy lord may you drive out every evil follow god lord every demon out of hell that would try to hinder this meeting tonight in any way father may the angels of god come and take their position in this building lord may why your word is being preached tonight may healing take place lord may deliverance take place may miracles be manifested lord father may signs and wonders be wrought at the hands of your believers tonight god lord forgive us of our failures and our shortcomings lord draw us closer unto thyself and whatever is accomplished here tonight we'll be sure to stand back and give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory for it's in the wonderful name of our lord and savior jesus christ we pray and all the believer says amen and amen god bless you this evening in the book of malachi the fourth chapter amen in the fifth verse god god bless you brother justin good to see you and your wife here this evening amen i i've been praying that they would be here too i have a right home i only bought a one-week ticket here so amen but we sure appreciate them coming down this evening and we want to look here in malachi the fourth chapter a very familiar reading in the fifth verse amen the bible says behold i will send you amen now a lot of people only see william branham and malachi 4 5 and 6 but there's actually two other parts he says behold i which is god will send you which is the bride of jesus christ elijah which we believe to be william marion branham the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord notice this and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse now when he's doing this work of turning the prophet of god says or in other words he will rebuild the church again under the power of the holy spirit so he's not coming to do something apart from the holy ghost he's actually coming to fulfill zechariah 4 not by my not by power but by my spirit saith the lord so god is actually sending this ministry to the church in the last days if we can also look in the book of ephesians ephesians the fourth chapter ephesians the fourth chapter and we want to look in the eighth verse of ephesians 4. you love the lord this evening amen in ephesians the fourth chapter the eighth verse paul here are writing to the church he says now wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now that he ascended is what but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same also that ascended up far so it's not two separate people it's the same god doing this up far above all heavens that he might feel all things now amen in the 11th verse and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some pastors some evangelists and some teachers now if somebody walks up to you and hands you a 20 bill or a 50 bill or 100 bill or even a dollar bill they've given you something now the next question is what is this for why why are you giving this to me and paul comes along and answers this and says for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ now the prophet of god says or to bring the church to a living faith in christ so he's given these gifts to bring the church to a living faith of jesus christ till we all come in the unity of the faith the 13th verse and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man and to the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slate of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him all things which is the head even christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together compacted by that which every joint supply according to the effectual working in the measure of every part make an increase of the body and to the edifying of itself in love we ask the lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can be seated here this afternoon amen we thank the lord for the reading of the word of god amen amen from those scriptures tonight if the lord would help me for a few moments to see then i would speak to you on if i would title it tonight i want to speak to you on the power of your pull the power of your pull or maybe to say it like this pulling on or operating the gift that god sends to you amen i believe in this hour that god has sent some wonderful gifts to the church i believe god has sent many powerful gifts to the church and i believe that he has also sent gifts of rest he has sent gifts of peace he has sent the gift of power brother ram says he give us the gift of water which is the life of god the bread of god all these gifts he's given us but then we also find amen that god actually give gifts unto men now amen we didn't gather here tonight just to have another church service we didn't gather here just to see who was here or who didn't show up but we gathered here tonight on purpose and that is that when we would leave this service tonight we would not leave further away from god but whether we would leave closer to god now amen i know sometimes we get in our minds that maybe a thirsty night service or if you your church you have wednesday night it's just a wednesday night service or it's just a thursday night service and it's maybe not a convention it's maybe not a youth camp or a special meeting amen but i want to say that the message of the hour has made every service a revival amen the message of the hour has brought us away from the ideas of denominational revivals where that if the music is at the right speed we can have church and if the if the the right preachers in town we can have church but the message of the hour has released to us a word revival which that word is a never failing word the bible says heaven earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away so amen this revival that we're a part of this evening amen is a revival that will never pass away the prophet of god said in the second coming of the lord he said now we know that revivals only come by the holy spirit he's the one who brings revival we cannot do it ourselves he says we can only make the effort and god has to bless that effort he said and we trust that he will so amen it's not that you don't have anything to do amen we've all heard it said that the preacher didn't bring the revival in his briefcase right we've all heard it said that the the evangelist didn't pack the revival or a specific preacher amen but the holy ghost brings a revival but just when the holy ghost brings revival the prophet says amen that you've got to make an effort now that word effort amen is a vigorous determined attempt it is it is not something casual it is not something that you just look at and say well maybe i'll get involved or maybe i won't amen but you actually release yourself to the power of the holy ghost in the message the great commission he says i believe if we'll all get together and pray together and stand together that god will bless us together see if we'll get together if we'll pray together if we'll stand together amen then god will bless us together don't you think so he said i believe if he will if we'll put forth an effort now see he'd been the revival just the minister can't bring it it takes all of us together he said and you're sick people here i could pray a prayer of sick for everybody but you all helping me and we all together can pray a prayer for the sick for everybody here he said everybody in edmonton we sure can but i need you and we all need god so in order for a service to be a service of success we need god right amen we need each other we need a we need a man of god to preach the word we need a song leader to sing some songs we we need some people to say amen to the word right amen a prophet is showing you that when you come together and you pray together and you stand together then god will come down and he will bless us all together now in other words what the prophet is saying is you operate the gift now that word operation means of a person it means a control of the functioning amen or of a machine or a process or a system in the message glorified jesus the prophet of god introduces to us the term amen the operation of the holy spirit he said may those without the holy spirit be born again tonight with the holy spirit i pray father that all the sick and the afflicted everyone will be healed this night he said get glory out of the service for we commit ourselves amen to thee for the operation of the holy spirit in jesus name another place she said god in his mercy through the operation of the holy spirit reveals spiritual truth he meant the word itself in the message our hope is in god he said the holy spirit was upon the church at pentecost do you believe that amen and it come right down to the age right on down to luther amen to baptist to methodist on down through unto this age here he said it's the same holy spirit when people get amen up they get their faith up into a place that they'll get the blessings and then to realize it's there see then the same operation of the holy spirit will be operating in the church like it did back there just the same in other words he's showing you that if you can release yourself in the presence of god then it'll raise your faith to a level he meant to believe that this service is not just for the person next to you or it's not just for the preacher or just for the elders amen but this service is for every believer here tonight he's been down the message and i'm just laying the foundation if that's okay and the message things that are to be the problem of god is speaking of how that a natural birth is prepared amen so that the child is born as perfect as it can be in that message he said now thank you if god in his mercy has the mother before the little baby is born he said it's craving for some vitamins and the mother's word speaks forth amen died i want cantaloupe i want watermelon i want something other he said why he'll do everything he can to get that because he wants his child to be born as perfect as it can be and he'll do everything that he's able to do to get it he said then how much more abler is he amen he is a creator now think how able he is to prepare us a body he meant to live like his own glorious body if we want to live he said there is something in us that calls to live he said and there's something in us that calls to do right now watch this there's something in you that is calling out to live there is something in you that is calling out to do right he said then god will call somebody on the platform amen or the pulpit that will preach the absolute truth hey then let me sit like this he meant in all reality you're the ones that call me here tonight amen on sunday morning when your pastor stands behind the pulpit in all reality you're the ones that called him behind the pulpit amen it wasn't necessarily your physical being he meant but it was something on the inside of you amen that was needing something from god amen and god has provided a channel even where he can release the blessings of god upon the church of the living god he meant to recognize tonight friends that you've got a part to play in these services amen we didn't just come together to see who showed up he'd been in to sing a few songs and to hear a few scriptures and quotes we are here tonight amen for the operation of the holy spirit now the prophet laid out a powerful promise he meant that if you release yourself amen then the same holy ghost that operated in the book of acts amen would return in the church in the last days and would operate here in this church he been then what happened in those days he been the sick were healed he'd been demons were cast out they've been prison walls fell they've been demons lost their power amen people who was running from god amen the holy ghost arrested their soul let me say this tonight friends amen i think it's time to realize that god is not limited to just the four walls of this building amen he's not just limited to this platform he's not just limited to them jews amen but you may have a loved one right now that's running a hundred miles in the opposite direction of where they ought to be going but right here amen in the house of god on the thursday night under the operation of the holy ghost amen the spirit of god can drop in the building and faith can begin to build and right here while i'm preaching your faith amen can dispatch the holy ghost he meant to that wayward boy or that wayward girl and return him to the fold are you hearing me church we're not under the operation of a man we're under the operation of the son of man amen see he will call somebody amen to the pulpit that will preach the absolute truth he said see it shows that if you're a real child of god amen then you'll begin to cry out amen i know we've done away with amen i know we've done away with hollering and screaming but a prophet said if you're a real child of god when you hear the word of god you'll begin to cry out amen you'll begin to say this amen god take it away from me amen circumcise me from this take these things away from me he said because it's needed for your heavenly home that you're going to he's gone to prepare you because you've got to be a real word bride of christ in other words what the prophet is saying is we need some preachers back in the pulpit who will take the gloves off and we'll call black black and white white and sin sin and righteousness righteousness and don't worry about who it offends come on don't worry about who it hurts amen now i'm just going to take some liberty and preach here tonight if that's okay amen because i actually remember in the days when a man or god would preach against television everybody in the church would stand up and say that ain't nothing but the truth preach against high heels everybody in the church today man preach against makeup everybody said amen ain't been preaching against men wearing swords everybody said amen amen but now it's got to where the church is full of it amen so if a man of god says anything about it amen everybody wants up and they don't say amen and they don't show up hell we might as well preach that we they don't show up for two weeks i'll tell you why because they've not opened up their heart to the operation of the holy ghost listen friends if the holy ghost speaks to a man of god and reveals something in your life and it's hindering you from the promises of god and it's hindering you from a revival amen if a man of god's got the courage to say it's sin amen there ought to be some people and people in the pulpits it's got the courage to say that's the truth listen we've all been guilty at some time or another amen but thank god there's still a place to truth to repent of the things that are wrong when the word of god strikes our path something cries out god take it from it in that amazing the prophet said they actually will cry out and then god take it from me they won't make excuses of why they need it they won't make excuses of why they need it amen when a man of god hits makeup they won't make excuses of why their face is pale and they need to wear a little bit hey they'll say hell might as well preach that now and then they'll say take it away from me amen when a man of god hits unclean movies and homes they won't make excuses for why they've got them they'll say goddamn things shouldn't be there take them out of here are you hearing me amen listen friends i believe the house of god is a place of shouting i believe it's a place of rejoicing i believe it's a place where we ought to dance amen do we can't dance no more but i still believe the house of god is a place of correction i still believe it's a place amen where judgment begins at the house of god amen we're living in a time where the two spirits amen that begin in genesis the prophets that are coming to maturity we know what those spirits are they are a true spirit and they are a false spirit now when you begin to look at this you'll realize that we've all heard this statement amen that there is a true five-fold ministry and there is a falsified full ministry amen and people amazes me that people have actually tried to identify amen what a true faithful ministry is and what a false faithful ministry is amen but the amazing thing to me is is the bible identifies what a true ministry is and what a false ministry is amen the word identifies the true characteristic of the true faithful ministry it is found in second timothy 4 2 when timothy was being wrote to by paul he said preach the word amen the true identifying characteristic amen of a true ministry is preach the word the instant in season amen now watch this instant in season out of season amen smile never raise your voice always let everything slip under the rug hey then that may be what smiley face in texas says but that's not what the apostle paul said to timothy he said reprove and rebuke and exhort with all long suffering amen and doctrine see that preaching is not sugar coding amen it is preaching the word of god and it's not tickling your ears and saying things you want to hear it's saying what the church needs to hear amen that what the prophet said is the true faithful ministry amen will preach the absolute truth amen john says it this way amen then said jesus to the disciples which believed on him if you continue in my word amen then ye are my disciples indeed he says and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free amen then what is the truth amen the truth is the word amen we got young people that needs to be free we've got marriages that need to be free we've got homes that need to be free we've got churches that need to be free and there's only one thing going to set them free and that is the word of god amen by the mouth of a holy ghost-filled preacher in the season that the word is being sent and then the prophet said this way he said what we need is somebody who will say it like it is amen the prophet said other visions was contrary to the bible he said but there was a man there micah amen whose vision was with the bible he said for one man who took god's word he said his vision lined up with god's word and it was perfect it was the absolute truth and a vision must line up with god's word he said a preacher amen must line up with god's word amen then that's a amen that's a burden that's been placed upon the ministry amen how can a man that's not lined up with the word amen preach to the church of the living god and tell them to line up with the word amen but when the lamb what can i preach when the preachers lined up amen then the church will come in line amen and i'll say it like this and amen just give me some grace for a minute if that's okay god called preachers are not cystified preachers prophet of god said what we need is is this he says while we ask the ministers of this that's in this building tonight he says that believes that this message that i preached he said that these creeds and man-made doctrines today is not of god but they are of man we really ought to go back to the bible way go back to the beginning he said then i want some of those ministers to walk forward and stand here with me while we lay hands and pray for these people he said see these people that seek him for god's blessings upon their life and some of you ministers if you will that that believes this to be the vital truth of god he said don't come no other way see be a man who believes it to be the absolute truth amen that if you're going to believe the message and claim to preach the message and the prophet saying don't be a amen be a man with the message when i look up that word be a man it means to put up with something it means to take responsibility for it then a prophet comes along and says and a man running from the presence he said when you see them in this day now the word of god has made these promises of things that we see happening now then we've got the responsibility to either face up to it amen or to walk away from it he said you cannot stay neutral you've got to do something amen you can't come in the church down come in the church door and go out the same person you came in you're either further away or you're closer to god he said every time you come in or go out amen but it's easy to shirk away from the responsibility amen let me sit like this i believe it's time amen that when we hear the word we receive the word and we take responsibility amen for the word we're hearing we've had enough pitchfork sermons we've had enough sir i'm just preaching what's on my heart if that's okay we've had enough sermons where people sit there and say well that's for brother brian that's for brother samuel that's for sister so-and-so amen no amen at some time or another you've got to stand up and say that's for me amen it's the word of god if it hurts then it hurts if it cuts then it cuts amen but god take it away from me i want to be a perfect word right when you begin to look at this you realize the prophet said god amen has sent these gifts now i said like this i believe we should be thankful for all that god has sent us i think we should be thankful for all that god is sending us and i think we ought to be thankful for all that god will send us amen god has sent us some wonderful things god is sending us some wonderful things and i believe god has got some more wonderful things he been descended upon the church but if i could take a minute can i tell you a few things i'm thankful for amen i'm thankful for a living god i'm thankful for a god who is the he is the first and he is the last he is the beginning and he is the end he is the prince of peace he is the king of kings he is the lord of lords he is the god that was the god that he is and the god which shall always be i am thankful for god amen i'll tell you something else i'm thankful for i'm thankful for a messenger that was sent by god he meant to deliver a word of truth in an age of deception in an age of error he would bring the correct understanding of the oneness of the godhead of water baptism of the holy ghost to the doctrines of the apostles he would restore those things i say thank god for sending a messenger i say thank god for sending a message amen without this message we would be in a famine without this message we would be starving tonight amen but god who is rich in mercy even set in amos shall be a time of famine such has never been seen before it won't be for bread or water it'll be for hearing the word of god amen but right here in the middle of this famine there is a church in sheffield ohio and then it's not starving and she's not dehydrated and she's not barely making it amen but she's received a message and is hoping to revive them amen i thank god for god i thank god for a messenger i thank god for a message but i'm going to go a step further and say i thank god for a faithful ministry who is still under their messenger amen faithfully preaching the message that god sent us in this generation amen how many says thank god for the gifts he sent us they've been seen in every service that we're in amen i said like this is another space amen that god has given us in the book of revelation 2 verse 21 jesus speaking there in the age he said i gave her speaking of jezebel a space to repent amen of her fornication watch this and she repented not amen so the time is going to come amen then there's going to be no more time of repentance the member says well he says in the five-time church age he said see do you know that this church was actually more wicked than ahab speak of the roman catholic church he said do you know that he repre that he repented for a while and walked softly before god but you can't say that at that roman catholic church no sir she has never repented amen but as stubbornly amen destroyed any and all who tried to help her repent watch that she is stubbornly he'd been destroyed all who was helping her to repent can you imagine somebody trying to help you to repent and you're stubbornly trying to destroy him well glory to god he said that is history now watch this but god kept raising up not only the messengers to each age hating them but he raised up some wonderful helpers amen for those messengers and then he gave every age some wonderful men of god and they did everything they could to bring the church back to god he said god certainly gave her opportunity and helped to repent did she ever repent and then did she show her first fruit no sir she never did and she never will he said she is drunk amen she has lost her sins in spiritual things amen then the word of god says that i gave her space which that word space means opportunity it means a small amount of time it means a portion of time it means off times i give her a space to repent and she repented not i sent a messenger in her age and she repented not i raised the pastors in her age and she repented not i raised up evangelists in her age and she repented not amen and the prophet opens the door of why she can't repent it's because she's drunk he meant on the natural things of the world he meant she's drunk on the ideas of religion she's drunk on theology amen but here in the last days is there anybody say oh god amen don't let me get blocked on the things of the world to where i lose my ability to repent amen now put your seatbelt on i'm going to preach for a minute amen because repentance is still in the bible amen it amazes me i've talked to people amen that's looking for things to change and the one thing you tell them to do is repent and they won't do it hey i've talked to people before and they say well i'm not going to let it go i'm not going to forgive amen but i want to change amen but let me say this even a prophet had to come to a spot where he had to humble himself and say i was wrong lord i shouldn't have told that lie i shouldn't have done that amen listen repentance is in the gospel from genesis to revelation amen you know how revival start is when people start repenting even you know how revivals break out is when people get before god and they kick out all the things of the world and they open up their hearts and they let the holy ghost come back in their lives and begin to rekindle the fire old church of living god is there anybody here tonight i can say lord don't ever let me get so drunk on my job and on my work and all my career and all these things that i cannot repent come on now amen we had listen i'm not getting in politics okay hey remember we even had a president amen who said at least he knew where he was half the time amen we had a president who said he didn't repent he just did better amen let me say this that's the idea of the day we're living in that's the age we're living in amen you ain't got to repent nobody's wrong everybody's well am i preaching or what amen everybody's right nobody's wrong amen it's all gray amen there's no black no more and there's no white amen but with my god he said come out from among them and touch not the unclean thing and i'll say tonight friends what we need around the message is an old-fashioned amen st paul's revival and the bible holy ghost back in the church until every sin is forgiven until every iniquity is remembered no more are you hearing me listen friends repentance can open up more in a service than you realize [Music] now i know when you go to priesthood repentance people get quiet amen but the prophet god actually faced this in a message called looking at the unseen he was speaking and he said see lord he said here is a revival he said i've fumbled around over here ain't been trying to find the lead to say something that would break a revival it seems like lord i just can't find that spot it seems that the people still can't get into it somehow the word goes forth i'm sure the spirit is here he said lord what is the hour that we're living in is it the hour of numbness is it the hour of numbness is it the hour that the church has been lulled asleep by the things of the world and by all the kinds of things that they have listened to that they should not have listened to is that our here lord listen a prophet of god is standing before a congregation in los angeles asking them is this the hour of numbness amen let me let me preach here for a second is this the hour of numbness and he says that right before the spirit of god comes down and takes control of his voice and looking at the unseen and says this is not william branham he has nothing to do with this amen this is the lord i'm using his voice he has surrendered himself amen let me say have you ever thought about where he was standing when he said that he was standing in los angeles where in 64 he would stand there and say amen they'll find you in the bottom of the sea amen from 59 to 64 there was a messenger to an age in an age in a community called los angeles california the very messenger himself was standing there and he was preaching the word and they were going on as if everything was okay they were not repenting they were not surrendering amen and god has laid up raised up faithful messengers under that messenger listen friends she signed her doom she's done for she'll be in the bottom of the sea someday amen but there is a seed on the earth tonight amen that heard the revival the revival was not just in the first pool the revival was not just in the second pool the revival was in the third pool which was the word which was the ability to say the word is right and i'm wrong is that okay is this that our lord then he comes to hear and recognize and act and he said now who's here who is it it ain't me how can i do that don't be numb to the spirit the spiritual things it's god here amen let's just face it friends amen we come in services sometimes and all reality we're just numb we ain't been out gambling we ain't been out running we ain't been out ain't been committing adultery and smoking amen but the pressures were under the job were on the schools were in the environments that surround us it's a day when it's easy to become numb come on church amen it's a day when it's easy to sit in a message church and become numb to the things of god to become none to the spiritual things amen when i say tonight let the holy ghost come down in the church tonight and let us awaken our sixth sense amen to recognize amen who is in our midst it's not just a preacher it's not just a pastor amen but the mighty god amen elohim himself i stepped down in this building tonight he is in the church he is not here to be a spectator he is here to be a participator he is the preacher he is the singer he is the healer he is the miracle worker he is the deliverer he is the mighty god amen can we open our eyes tonight and realize he is here he's in the church listen friends the prophet stood in a message and said look he said deity is not in heaven amen deity is an earth and do you realize that wasn't any kind of deity he identified that deity as identified deity he said and in the last days they have rejected oh god they have rejected identified deity and they put him on the outside but there was a bride there was a bride who had a word to hear from the lord amen the promise of god said see then we ought to recognize who is in our midst amen when we come to services even though it's a thirsty night amen we shouldn't come to say well let's get through the service we'll just see who's here the prophet said what we bring to each service amen identifies of what we think of the service you realize what the bible says in jeremiah 33 11 that the voice of joy and the voice of gladness and the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride and the voice of them shall say praise the lord of host for the lord is good for his mercy endureth forever and of them shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the lord so in the last days there is going to be a people who is going to have the voice of joy going to have the voice of gladness going to have the voice of the bridegroom going to have the voice of the bride and here's what amazes me she's still going to have to bring a sacrifice of praise into the house do you know why it's because of the pressures of the age we're living in even the devil fights us harder on thirsty than he does any other day of the week he fights you harder on saturday than he does any day of the week you know why because he knows sunday's coming he knows sunday's coming he knows thirsty not meekness well can we just take the breaks off and preach for a minute he knows thursday night meeting is coming and he knows when you get in the atmosphere and you begin to sing the songs and you begin to hear the praise and you begin to hear the word amen you'll begin to pray together you'll begin to stand together you'll begin to sing together and before long god will come down and begin to bless the church together the devil knows he'll put forth his best effort to keep you out of the house of god amen but let me let the devil know tonight his best effort is not enough his best effort is not enough we are here in the house of god if the devil can put all his effort into stopping you from getting to the house of god and he didn't have enough to stop you then what about the pride of jesus christ when she gets in the house of god don't you think we ought to put some effort and some determination into our singing into our praise [Applause] i'm a firm believer church amen that when praises go up amen blessings come down i'm a firm believer amen that a song leader shouldn't have to stand and beg the church and pump the church and plead with the church can anybody help me sing can anybody help me clap hey man listen you want to defeat the devil well i don't feel like clapping clap anyhow you want to defeat the devil i don't feel like saying amen say it anyhow come on church i'm defeating the devil right here tonight ain't that the devil's battle me in my mind all week long amen but i'm standing in the pulpit with the word of god and the sword of the spirit with the liberty in my heart to say no matter what the devil's tone against me it hadn't been enough to stop me because i've been ordained to hear the word come on church amen if you'll put forth an effort god will bless it are you hearing me if you'll put forth but then i don't know if you will or not let me just assure you if you put forth the least effort god will bless it come on woman one widow with too much you ain't got twenty dollars you ain't got a thousand dollars you ain't even got enough for them to recognize what you put in the treasury amen but god saw it she put forth an effort see what she brought oh god what she brought identified what she thought of whose presence she was in [Music] what she let me repeat that what she brought identified though it was a little bit she identified if i just give him a little bit he's everything [Applause] if i just put what i got in it he'll bless it amen let me sit like this what are you putting in these services amen what are you putting in these meetings what are you putting in prayer time what are you putting in bible study like the boy took it the daddy took his boy to church they went in there father offering time come around the father dropped a dollar in the plate they left church little boy got in the truck and the daddy said well that was the worst service i've ever been in said the singing was too loud the pews were too hard the preacher was too long he screamed too much said they sung too much at the end little boy looked over at daddy and said well i thought it was pretty good for a dollar in other words i thought it was pretty good for what you put in it amen let me say this friends sometimes in order to get something out of something you got to put something in it there will be no withdrawals if there is no deposits is there any members here of this church tonight can say lord from this not forward i take a pledge to allegiance to the lamb of god i will put my everything in these services i will give it my all when i sing i will give it my all when i say amen i will give it my all when i clap my hands i've come here god to give you my all the prophet of god talked about the three main giants didn't he he said what did they bring they brought gold frankincense and myrrh he said in other words amen deity in service to die that nobody had to ask them what they thought about whose presence they was going to stand in nobody they didn't have to open their mouth brother and say we think he's deity in service to die they looked at what they was bringing and by what they was bringing identified without them even opening their mouths what they thought can i preach of what they thought of whose presence they was coming into the prophet said and i say that to us today the things that we bring him identifies our thoughts about him do you understand what i mean if you believe with all of your heart amen every word of that then you'll identify it by giving your all to it amen but if you believe it's a good place to associate with some better people around church and things like that he said that's just about all you'll get just a few social hours he said but if you really believe with all of your heart amen then you'll give everything that's in you to it and it identifies you that you believe the message that you believe it is to be the truth amen then there's a reason why the devil doesn't fight you during the song service there's a reason why he don't fight you during the specials amen amen they can sing for two hours and you wouldn't nod off he remember let the preacher take the pulpit and everybody starts nodding off there's a reason for that it ain't because your back's lit it ain't because you're a terrible person it's because the devil knows the potential between the preaching of the word and the pulling of the congregation he knows what happens when a man of god gets himself out of the way and begins to preach the word and the people get themselves out of the way and begin to receive the word he knows the mechanics and the dynamics come together and in a few minutes amen there'll be an ignite amen between the faith of god and the faith that's in the church and there'll be miracles and signs and wonders and deliverances and the devil don't want you to break through amen but i say tonight like a prophet said we're gonna break through he said i see a breakthrough on the audience tonight i believe that there is a breakthrough listen friends i believe there's a breakthrough in the house of god on the thursday night [Music] the prophet said see he don't want you to begin to pull amen now listen to this he said because hundreds has received thee as their savior we're so thankful for it and the sick and the crippled amen they've been healed he said and now god has come into the midst of the people and their faith somebody shout out their faith their faith has drawn out supernatural words come on church your faith is drawing out supernatural words listen these words aren't in my human body amen they're in a gift that was deposited in me before the foundation of the world i don't control the gifts you control the gift come on amen listen i've been in i have seen the gift of god be in operation listen all you got to do is start pulling and devils will start falling all you got to do is start backing the word and demons will start losing their power i've done seen it happen before a few years ago i was privileged to be in india while i was standing the pulpit preaching there was a group of pastors over on the side of the platform i didn't know any of them and they didn't know me i didn't speak their language and they didn't speak mine even but i was preaching while i was preaching brother amen something come over me and i looked at that congregation of ministers and i said preach the message if it's in a little hut somewhere amen preach the message don't let the devil tell you what you're doing is in vain i didn't know why i was saying that but when i got done there was a pastor come to me and hug my neck and through an interpreter he said tell that brother amen i have got a little church in a village in india that i was about ready to close up because i thought i was wasting my time he said but that man don't even know where that church is ain't been but god knows where oh keep that devil out of here tonight amen that i didn't know where his church was i didn't need to know where his church was but god knew where it was and god had the answer amen before he had the problem are you hearing me tonight church then while the word is being preached you may have not talked to the preacher for a week amen but i believe there's supernatural words that begins to fall out of the gift the prophet said explaining to them their life of what they have done and what they must do and what will be in that beautiful out of the gift comes the past the present and the future a man that's never met you before can explain your life that has been your explain your life it is and can preach to you what shall be now the reason why that happens is is the plot of god said there's a hidden power in the message he said that's what we're trying to bring our churches today he said with a high staple and the prettiest pews and the best dressed crowd he said that don't break the toe hold no it takes the hidden power of the spirit of god it takes the word in there to break the hold it takes the word in there to break the whole amen how many knows the part of god told a story about an attorney who was arguing a case and he had watched another attorney and he he had he had memorized everything that attorney said everything he done and he went before the judge and he stood there and cried and he boo-hooed and he beat the desk and he stomped his foot and the problem of god said the judge finally said enough is enough he said if you're going to defeat this case it's going to take some long in other words emotion was not enough [Music] to defeat the to defeat the case it was going to take something with some strength in it and let me say this i love to shout i love to dance but in this laodicean age when satan has become the god of this civil age it's going to take more than a shout it's going to take more than a dance it's going to take more than emotion it's going to take the word in the church to defeat the devil and that word will defeat the devil anywhere anytime under any conditions amen see then what god needs amen as preachers amen in churches with spiritual courage who's got the word that's got the promise and it's got the power the father said see to press it out there and watch it come to pass amen david had the promise he had the word and he had the power listen david didn't know how that rock was going to find goliath's forehead amen but he knew if i'll just sling the slingshot come on if i'll just sling the slingshot amen that rock will go out there and it'll hit goliath right square in the head and david didn't know how it was going to happen but he just knew it was going to happen can i preach he knew it was going to happen so he stood there and he went to swing in that slingshot he went to swing in that slingshot and before long he let that rock go brother said f-a-i-t-h amen listen amen david didn't go down there and pick out the place for that rock to hit amen god had done predetermined can i preach to you like it's coming to me amen how come when saul or when goliath put on all that armor amen of all the places he could have put an arm or he should have made sure his head was covered amen but he left a little place open you know why amen because god knew he hulk god left that hole open for a rock to come in there and to kill that uncircumcised philistine and right here on a thursday night amen the devil's done everything he can to protect his old sorry hide amen from being exposed and from being exposed in this service amen but the word of god is in the church there's a slingshot of faith in the house of god and it's going out yonder and i'm pressing out there i'm pressing out there and you're pulling out there and that rock will hit its destination and goliath will fall the prophet said see he just needs somebody with the courage to push it out there and then i think it's amazing amen if this is okay to continue a few more minutes in the book of revelation one you'll find that john describes the sevenfold glory of the personage of jesus christ in the fourth fold he said his voice was as the sound of many waters which you know what waters represents it represents peoples multitudes nations and tongues the prophet said his voice was as the sound of multitude speaking he said what are these it's judgment these are the voices of the multitudes of witnesses who by the holy spirit amen through the ages have testified to christ now listen to this and preached his gospel the voice of the seven messengers will be heard loud and clear amen when i watch this those faithful preachers who preach the saving power of jesus who preached water baptism in jesus name who preached the infilling and power of the holy ghost who stood with the word more than they stood with their own lives of all of them were the voice of jesus christ by the holy ghost down to the ages he said see now watch his voice his love his voice of love and care and guidance and protection was being declared through a voice of many waters he said oh if you would only see it's the waters that destroyed the world amen but it was the same waters that saved noah and also the same whole earth for noah listen to his voice the voice of his servants as he's called into repentance and to life many people want to get to life without going through repentance but the prophet said listen to the voice of his faithful servants as they call the repentance and then the life amen as you go on you'll find that the six fold amen i'm going somewhere of his personage was the two-edged sword right the prophet said like this i was up in sabino canyon and down came a sword it was a two-edged sword it was not a sword it was the king sword it was the word of the lord and the message that the patmos bishop he said out of his mouth amen watch this out of his mouth which where's his voice coming from his voice is coming from his mouth out of his mouth also goes amen a sharp two-edged sword out of his mouth amen with a sharp dredged sword which is amen the word of god amen when he comes that word somebody say that word when he comes that word will come against all nations and all men and the word of god will show who did the will of god and who didn't it will make known the secret works of every man and while he did them it will divide asunder there won't be any respect before god all will be judged by the word no one escaping it they've been listening to me tonight friends there is a judgment coming upon this nation there is a judgment coming upon this world amen but there is a people who has heard the voice of many waters they have felt the sword come on amen let me say like this amen if you've got a pastor and i believe you do who is a man of god who preaches the word of god amen let me say this don't you think it's the man it's the word it's not the man it's the word he said how do you know that he is revealing the secrets of hearts and men in the age of which we're living who else can reveal the secrets but the word himself amen it is the same spirit that was in jesus the word that is present again in the church in the last stage as a last sign amen trying to head the people off from judgement for they that reject him the word are now already coming to a judgment amen crucified him afresh now paul said that the word came in power as well as voice right like a flaming cutting sword it went to the consciousness of men like a surgeon's knife and it cut out the diseases and set the captives free amen then when the world is drunk on the things of the world amen and they lost their sins in the spiritual things of god there is a fifo ministry who is running throughout the land with a sword in their mouth oh is this okay brother samuel with a sword in their mouth amen and right here tonight amen you may not realize it but the word is cutting your conscience free like a surge's knife amen see it's not the man the prophet says it's the word amen what did he say he said who did the word lord come to the prophet and god called the prophet because they had the word of god if a man has the word of god it's not the man it's the word that people's listening to it isn't the man it's the word see notice this if the prophets jeremiah isaiah elisha if they sent us saith the lord as long as the word was coming from them they were gods and god said himself he was the one that done the announcing because it wasn't man listen to this quote it wasn't man he took the man out and put himself in there to speak then it was not jeremiah announcing like a fire set up in my bones it was not elisha announcing amen a receiving of the double portion it was not ezekiel announcing amen that they'll be they'll be horseless carriages it was not those men the god of those men took those men out and placed himself in those men and when they spoke it was not the man it was the god of the man well don't leave it out there let's bring it to today when the prophet stood and said california's going under it was not a man amen he took the man out and he put himself in when he stood there and said amen this day this scripture is fulfilled it was not a man it was god who had taken possession of a man and let me go and bring it right here to spoken word tabernacle believer spoken word church let me bring it right here when a pastor stands behind the pulpit and begins to preach the word and says today is the day of salvation today is the day of redemption it's not the man the man is not here he has surrendered himself to god and god god has taken possession of the man it's not the man announcing it's god in the man announcing in other words there's a reason why god had to take the man out because this bride will not be manhandled oh god she will not be manhandled she will be a virgin word right the prophet said there'll be no denominational manhandling in the virgin birth of the bride she is commanded by god to come out of such and touch not their unclean things become not of their vultures aren't you glad that god sent a five-fold ministry that would replay come on church amen you know why i had to send a prophet to each age it's because when they took things out of god's hands into their hands they come up with all kinds of deeds of nicolaitans all kinds of ideas amen when it become manhandled amen you know what happened when it became manhandled the church come into a poverty stricken condition amen now let me preach to you for a second even because man fell right the fall in the garden come by man right and the prophet said redemption will fall come by man as well he meant that if the church went into a poverty stricken condition by man he meant that i believe god can take another man and bring it out of the poverty stricken condition are you hearing me hey man now let's go to kentucky you want to there's a little woman sitting in her house down there and she's she's starving she ain't got money to buy coal she ain't got money to buy groceries and welfare comes in and does a check on her and they said ma'am what happened to you she said my son left and went overseas to school right he went overseas to school she said i haven't heard from him in years or seen him they said well does he not check on you he may now watch this her son moved out and when her son moved out she went into a poverty stricken condition obviously he was the he was the finances in the home he was the support in the home when he moved out she went into poverty amen now watch this amen she's sitting in poverty and welfare comes by to do a check and they say ma'am amen does your son not call you no but she said let me show you what he does send me he don't send me no money he sends me beautiful pictures called spoken word books he sends me beautiful pictures they're little telegrams and she goes over and she pulls one out so what she does is she opens up her app called the table and she pulls one out called god's power to transform and she pulls another one out called why we are not a denomination and she pulls another one out called amen why i'm a holy roller she pulls another bout called the seventh seal another one called the rapture another one called future home are you hearing me amen another one called amen things that are to be she's pulling out all these spoken word books these these telegrams and she said my these pretty books and remember said the welfare man looked at her and said ma'am them are not telegrams them are moneygrams them are moneygrams see them are moneygrams and she had been storing them away amen for a day in the future well let's preach why don't we she had been stacking them up amen for the future amen but somebody got there she was the problem of god so when they got done counting they said she was the richest woman in the county living in poverty she was the richest woman in kentucky living in poverty but you know what she didn't know that until a gift come back she didn't know that until a gift come by and picked up them telegrams and said them are not telegrams that's rapturing faith that's creation power that's spoken word authority that's devil defeat serpent bruising holy ghost field word and lemon pie come on church and here we were sitting as a bunch of poverty stricken church members up one day and down the next amendment thanks be to god he sent a gift in this generation he sent a five-fold ministry to take the word and reveal to you you're not the poorest person in the church you're the richest person in the church you say lander i want joy you've already got it tonight i want peace you've already got it tonight i want healing you've already got it tonight when a gift come by he revealed to her oh god are you hearing me she began to operate that gift well glory the blood of god said what we need to do is take advantage then come on it's time to take advantage of what god has sent in this generation i actually got to thinking the other day about something could you imagine i may have used this here before but i want to use it again i'm going somewhere with it could you imagine in your house having a broken door and you you asked your husband to fix it well let's change he's been going to fix it when deer season's over are you hearing me it's been there and it needs to be fixed so what you do is you call a handyman to come by and he starts working on the door and you know what you're watching him man two minutes he's got it fixed well in your mind you're thinking you know what that sink back here needs to be fixed too and that wall needs to be passed that plumbing needs to be repaired and we need to put with the light switch quit working and you know what you do you begin to say well while you're here would you mind to take a look at the sink and when you know that would you mind to take a look at this see what you're actually doing is you're pulling amen or you're revealing his ability to fix things oh god are you hearing me see you're not you you don't walk over and say now amen that's too much to ask i really don't want to amen don't worry about no while you're here [Applause] while you're here will you fix this and while you're here when you fix that see if we're not reserved ain't meant to pull in a natural gift then why do we become reserved to pull on a spiritual gift come on church amen what does it mean to pull amen listen this to pull means to exert force on someone or something it means to cause movement towards oneself it's to act as taking a hold of something and exhorting force to draw it towards one glory to god it means to force drawing someone or something into a particular direction or course of action then what he's saying is amen you've got the power he meant to pull on the natural gift because you want to get the full value amen then pull on the spiritual gift and get the full value out of that [Music] let me let me i'm closing here listen the prophet said see wherefore he saith he sent a gifts led captivity captive and gave gifts unto me and romans 11 29 for the gift somebody said the gifts and the callings of god are without repentance now listen to this word yes it means the grace or gifts denoting extraordinary powers distinguishing certain christians and enabling them to serve the church of christ the reception of which is due to the power of divine grace so in other words amen god has placed gifts in the body amen not to serve themselves amen but to serve the body of christ amen then let me say like this gifts of god are not earned amen gifts or god gifts of god are sent behold i will send you elijah the prophet john 1 there was a man sent from god the prophet said see he said now notice this he says watch god ordain these five offices god sent these amen why remember it's god's dress where in the church then when a true gift of god comes in the church it's not to edify the man it's to edify the church he said to bring the church to a living faith in jesus christ to the unity of the faith amen unto a perfect man that we be no more children toss to and fro he said see that the christian life should come to a stability then these gifts are not coming ain't meant to bind the church they're not coming to loose the church into worldliness they're coming to bring the church to a stability that he says we may grow up in him in all things what is all things all things is truth he said see now lord send your gifts which is secondary to all this that it might work to bring the people to the edify the church to bring us to a realization of your presence amen can i can i preach it for a second and we'll go home amen god sends a gift in the church amen a preacher amen a five-fold minister amen to bring a realization of the presence of god in the church amen the part of god says it like this in the presence of god unrecognized he says when he is not recognized amen that his power is not revealed when he is not recognized so you could be here tonight amen listen you could be in this building and have a need in your life and brother jesus christ could be standing right next to you amen and you not even recognize it amen you realize what he's standing next to you but you'll leave with the same condition but when you recognize that he's not three feet from where i'm standing when you recognize he is here when you recognize god of the old testament it's the god of the new testament is the god that's in this building when you become awake and you're not numb to who's in the midst of the church then do you realize what happens when you recognize him you reveal his power oh glory to god i feel like dancing when you recognize him you reveal his power you release his power amen how many knows when you go to an airport and there's somebody famous walking through you know what they do they veil themselves they put sunglasses on they put they put a hoodie on and then they walk all weird because they don't want you to recognize them because when you recognize them amen amen i was down to louisiana one time i think it was timothy pruitt was telling me he was out there at monroe louisiana airport one time y'all heard them duck dynasty guys hadn't you they're right there in monroe amen he said i was there and he said one of them come walking through he said he had glasses on he said he had a hood on had his head down said he was walking through there he said somebody recognized him and said well there's field and it revealed everybody to everybody who it was he said next thing there was 100 people around him amen you know why they don't want to be real because they don't want you to be drawn to him amen but that's not the way it is with god that's not the way he is not here tonight amen hiding from you glory to god he is not here in a corner somewhere ain't even hoping you don't he's wanting somebody they meant to recognize he's the mighty god he's the everlasting father he's wanting somebody ain't meant to recognize he's here he's here in power he's there in supreme power he's here in authority he's here in healing he's looking for somebody he meant to lift him out of history somebody recognized he is the mighty god and he's not a million miles away he's right here in this church tonight come on church and when you recognize him you reveal his power you release his anointing are you hearing me amen i'm going to close with this amen you realize there's three powers that's released when you recognize him i'm going to give him too quick from the scripture one amen is one with the infirmity who was bound over within herself can i buy five minutes she was bowed over then herself the bible says amen for 38 years she had been coming to church and i love this brother but one night it was a different service because the bible says jesus was actually teaching in the temple and she was sitting there bowed over if you go read christian history you will find that there was not one service she missed if anybody had an excuse not to be there it was that woman if anybody had an excuse amen not to show up and if they did show up if anybody had an excuse not to back the word it was that woman but okay brother samuel i read that one day and i about shouted my study down amen amen ancient history records that while jesus was teaching i gotta close amen let me just say this for people that gets all corporate people standing up when the preacher's preaching it actually happened a long time before we got here history records while jesus was teaching she recognized who was in the pulpit she recognized yeah that's the one they say amen is a man that's a crazy man it's the illegitimate child but she recognized brother that's a healer right there and the bible says she stood up and while he was teaching she said that ain't nothing but the truth she said that's the word lord and the bible says jesus turned and said woman thou art loosed and the prophet said what happened he said her genuine faith released his power to heal her can we go to the second one right quick it was a man named jairus amen his daughter was laying dead even but gyrus went out and he recognized who jesus was he was a secret believer but when he recognized who jesus was he come out of the closet and stepped out in full assurance this is a man of god this is god and the prophecy when jairus recognized when jairus recognized who he was it released his power of resurrection and a girl who was laying dead in the midst of the home was raised alive when one man recognized he is still the god that is able to raise the dead but here's one that blows my mind in closing it was the woman who washed jesus feet there was a gift in simon's house simon invited that gift in the house are you with me and put that gift in a corner and he's sitting in a corner and in walks a prostitute ian walks a prostitute and recognizes him he's in the corner everybody's ignoring him but she says that's him that's the one my mama told me met the woman at the whale oh god just around the menu will shout by ourselves that we have to that's the one that's the one that when they caught that woman in the act of adultery and they brought her before him to stoner that's the one that said you without seeing cast the first stone and they everyone dropped their stones she began and she's recognizing she's beginning to release something you know what the problem of god said she was releasing his power to forgive god have mercy she was releasing his power to forgive and the father said watch this he said she recognized his presence she released his power to forgive and notice this also she released the power of god to show to them unbelievers that he was a prophet for he knew who she was also release joy amen and power and eternal life oh god if you don't get anything else get this she was the condemned she walked in that house as the condemned she was the condemned she didn't have a chance she didn't have a future she didn't have hope she walked in a service on a thursday night and she was ready to throw up her hands and quit but there was a gift in the pulpit that began to say god is still god and his word is still true and his power is still here and she recognized that's the lord and the father said watch he said woman thou art forgiven watch amen she's being a prostitute but in the presence of god she went from being a prostitute oh god brother samuel she went from being the condemned to being the condemner tested no y'all y'all didn't hear that she went from being the condemned to being the condemner she was condemned before she realized whose presence she was in but when she recognized he was a prophet when she recognized he was a forgiver when she recognized he was the lamb that was to take away the sins of the world she said lord forgive me and she was forgiven and a hundred self-righteous amen pharisees condemned by the transformation of a woman who was a prostitute [Applause] what are you saying preacher i'm saying every one of us in here tonight we were the condemned we was the condemned but somewhere we come in the presence of el shaddai we come in the presence of jehovah we come in the presence of elohim and we recognize he's more than a man he's more than a prophet he's more than a preacher he's more than a teacher he's the mighty conqueror he's the resurrection he is alive he is the waymaker he is the miracle worker and you know what happened right here in the house of god that old devil that chased you in here was condemning you but right now in the house of god you've recognized yes whose presence you're in and now you are condemning the condemner pull on this presence church he's the mighty goddess the musicians are coming [Music] are you hearing me recognize the problem said see sometimes it's god using his gift and he said sometimes it's you using god's gift hallelujah i love that amen so it isn't me that stands here are you ready for this it's you that stands here and does it you out in the audience and you hear on the platform you're drawing from god's gift amen you guys are proud of god said i'm not going to rehearse it because brother samuel he brought it out before i come out but i want you to catch this the bible god said blind bartimaeus went to a church where they talked think about this he said he went to a church where they talked that the power of god power of jehovah that was in egypt was not the same today he said but while he was sitting there he remembered his mother's teachings and he said that now watch this do you realize how much power you got in the service are you hearing me the priest is in the pulpit teaching jehovah's not the same and blind bartimaeus begin to say but he is the same oh god he said every time they would lead him to the temple for service they taught this sermon jehovah don't perform miracles anymore but one day bartimaeus heard some noise and he asked what was causing the noise and the problem said watch bartimaeus began to ask can someone tell me who's passing by what's all this noise about what what's all these people shouting in the house of god what's all this commotion about what's all this noise about he said then reality began to sit on bart sit in on bartimaeus he's passing by in other words he's here amen amen and bartimaeus began to think if i could touch him of his garment he could hear my cry the prophet said what was it he said it was the pull of faith what are you saying preacher i'm saying this el shaddai was in the presence of abraham and abraham drew help pull he pulled el shaddai's strength into his own body these services are not just thursday night services they're not just sunday morning services amen el shaddai is in the building do you believe that tonight el shadia has stepped down in the building tonight to where you don't have to leave the way you come won't you stand your feet with us this afternoon [Music] you ever this is the prophet of god today as he was talking about it in luke 24. he says he says it like this he said jesus had been had been crucified he said he had rose again he said they was all bewildered they was all tore up they was all nervous he said and on the road to emmaus they were walking talking about the conditions how bad things were how dark things were and all of a sudden a stranger appeared and began to walk with him the problem god said he began to say why are you all frowning why do you look like this they begin to repeat back to him have you not heard our lord was crucified the other day [Music] he was dead he was taken off the cross and laid in a roman tomb have you not heard how bad things are have you not heard how bad my family situation is have you not heard the doctor's report have you not heard that the boss told me i got two weeks and got to find a new job are you hearing me they're walking with the resurrected christ and they don't recognize who he is [Music] but he begins to talk to him in such a way that they begin to say there's something different about him you know what the bible says the bible says that they constrained him amen amen oh my god that shout point right there they constrained him to come inside he was going to keep on walking but they said oh no come on inside come on in abide with us come inside and when he shut the door he picked up the book [Music] and begin to lose the seals begin to break the bread and they begin to recognize this is him why'd you say that because you come to church many times and i do too and we sit there and say things are horrible things are terrible things can't change this is the way it is and the in the changer the changer is standing right next to you [Music] i've been in services before and the devil be bombarded people's minds and they've testified to me brother while he was preaching the devil was speaking in my head you're a failure you're defeated i was down in south carolina one time speaking and i said listen i said the devil will take everything he can from you and i said what the devil has done he's taken your praise i didn't know why i said that there was a man sitting about halfway back he jumped up and screamed that's right that's right i said but it's time to go get your praise back it's time to get this wasn't in my notes it's time to get your worship back he was sitting there he told me this he was sitting there making up plans of how he was going to quit church because he couldn't praise god no more for all the condemnation and i said but a prominent god come along and said we can get in the presence of god and we can begin to worship god until we expel all the guilt and expel all the condemnation and right there that man got his praise back i didn't have nothing to do with that the changer was in the building the god who could change the situation amen are you hearing me tonight he's not outside he's inside amen will anybody constrain him tonight will anybody pull him into your heart because will anybody constrain the lord will anybody operate the gift of the holy ghost oh my but andrew things can't change they must remain the same i say all things change when jesus christ comes in the bill the prophet of god said it like this he said see he sent his word and he said the people that was bound was set free by receiving what god sent behold i will send you that word sin means set free means to direct behold i will direct unto you a lie to the prophet and the words that you hear will literally set you free it'll bring you out of the poverty stricken condition oh my is there anybody here tonight tired of living in spiritual poverty you're tired of just barely getting by from service to service anybody tired of just getting in the house of god and just sitting down and saying well i made it they ought to be happy i'm here is there anybody ready to say god i want to take full advantage of these services amen i wanna i wanna pull supernatural words out of brother

raise your hands but i every one of us can say god has spoken and he's challenged my life i love that amen how god comes down and he speaks so personally to our hearts and god was letting us know in this service that every service that it's not something we wonder about but we are the ones the reason god lays things on the heart causes things to go a certain way causes things i mean you know brother andrew you've been preaching for for a long time as well there's certain things that i look at sometimes when i can stand behind a pulpit sometimes whether it's here i feel like things hasn't even come together other times i've been places and i've had things laying right before me had an ipad had a steno pad and had everything laying before me and i get up there to start preaching and i don't use none of it right why because it's what is determined is based on the needs of the hearts of the people i want you to think of this every one of us in here every one of us including me when i set out there when brother andrew walked up here tonight my prayer was is god help him to be sensitive to what we have need of is that your prayer when a man of god comes across the platform then i think it ought to be the request that we would say my request would be to you is is god help me to be sensitive amen help me to be sensitive heading into that service help me to be sensitive lord when i'm sitting there and i'm hearing the word if we can get together on that and agree on that right there i'll tell you what there are some things that god will really begin to do he's being sensitive because it's not the preacher that packs it it's a work that goes on between you know brother brown said it like this in spiritual food and due season he said what it is he said there's a gift in you to believe there's a gift he said in me he said that god is placed there and he said what happens between those two gifts it's a channel and he said but in that channel that's where the secret food is at so the spiritual food in due season is that secret channel that's between the gift in a believer and the gift that god is using right there in the pulpit to be able to recognize it's not the man but it's god amen and god's speaking to our needs i'm glad that god i'm glad that god can choose different complexions to stand here in different statures whether they're wide or bubbly or thin or tall bald or have hair i'm glad god uses all sorts because what he's using isn't the frame of the man he's using the gift he put in there and i'm grateful that by the grace of god we're able to look past the frame look past everything else and hear his voice and recognize it's him i tell you what there's strength there's help there's liberty amen for each of our lives i'll tell you my goodness here i just i know that without a shadow of a doubt before we even started this service tonight god had arranged it and i can say amen to that tonight amen can we just agree right here tonight and let's just sing that song amen [Music] [Music] are you gonna love him or are you gonna praise him are you gonna worship him amen [Music] be more amen looking to the unseen operating the gift of god receive the blessing from the throne i'm the son of god i'm a daughter of god [Applause] it's gotta be believing his own words amen amen amen some morning between six and nine wanna take a rapture
