all of it is an instrument that God uses to mold and shape our character and I'm grateful to God for His mercy I know you are tonight as well to realize that there's something greater on the inside of us that's holding us that's the real peace that's the real hope that's the real patience we have as the saints of God because through it all we know that the life that is within us that same life is undefeatable that life has never been defeated it's never lost one battle Amen hail could not contain it the grave could not hold it and the earth gravitation could not hold it here it was always subject to the world and that same life living inside of your eye I'm gray I'm glad that the reality is greater is He that is in me than he that's in the world aren't you glad something's got ahold of you it's not just something it's Jesus okay I'm so grateful to the Lord for that amen where else could we go but to the Lord so we just we want to invite brother Timothy and Sean my brother Timothy is here from Ghana and so we have through Ghanians in the house tonight amen one tall one in one short life but brother Timothy is here and we just we just love brother Timothy and grateful that he was able to make a God was able to make a way that our brother could be here with us and service we so enjoyed last year and every time he's come how our brother just surrenders his gift to the Lord so I believe that God no matter what complexion God's gonna wear tonight whether he would wear a white hillbilly like me or he wears a black beanie and it doesn't matter whatever complexion he's gonna put on we want your call we want to hear from God tonight and I believe that God wants to speak to us tonight so let's just let's just pull on the gift of God I believe that God knows exactly what we need and and the Lord is mindful it's so good to see CH and every one of them amen I thought of that last few services I've been privileged to be out here and I've set back there and my it's just been good to be out here and worship with you and just to see you all walk in I've wanted to stop every one of you and shake your hands and hug the brothers next but we were just not able to do that all the time but we just we thank God for His mercy it's good to be a part of the family of God in it amen as brother Timothy comes let's keep on singing that song for it reaches to the highest mountain amen how many expecting God's going to speak tonight Lord you know my name nor do you know my heart and I'm just when I reckon I see you Lord I'm able to receive the desires that I have needed for it

Jesus to come and die for us he paid the penalty of our sins Emmanuel God in flesh we are so grateful that you did it yourself and we thank you for your grace that has brought us this far now Freddie stiffening forgive us of what that is not pleasing in your sight and low once again me that blood the blood of Jesus cleans us from every unrighteousness and when you can deceive me again a minister unto our needs we appreciate your grace we want to ask you that as many of the children that I've got it whatever they might be we ask that you be with them thank you so much in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord we ask that you be with us amen god bless you so once again it's a privilege to be in the house of the Lord and also I bring greetings to you from my family and the Castro and the believers in West Africa we just coming from the convention in North Carolina and the brothers also asked me to greet the believers Bharati news was remember the mic was then they are absolutely wherever you go agree the believers for us so god bless you once again and brother Sam for this opportunity given to me to be here this evening to fellowship together on their every word of our day we thank God for His grace and mercy we love Him because He first loved us and we believe that the good work that he has started you will bring it to completion because our God is faithful so we are just here to encourage our search because that's what the Bible said we should keep doing let's stand and read from the Gospels and look chapter one Luke chapter 1 look chapter work let's start from verse 39 shall we hear the word of the Lord he and Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste into a city of Judah and entered into the house of zekkariyas and saluted Elizabeth and it came to pass that when Elizabeth had the salutation of Mary the babe lived in their womb and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost and she spec out with a loud voice and said blessed are thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb and when is this to me that the mother of my lord should come to me for lo as soon as the voice of that salutation sounded in my mind my ears the babe lived in my womb for joy and blessed is she that believe for there shall be a performance of those things which were told from the Lord amen shall we please be seated and the Gospel of st. John chapter 4 verse 48 then said Jesus unto him as said easy signs and wonders he will not believe the nobleman said unto him say come down my child died jesus said unto him go thy way thy son liveth and the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him and he went his way and as it was now going down is his seventh matching and so they say the son liveth then inquire he of them the hour when he began to amend and they said unto him yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him so the father knew that it was at the same hour in the which Jesus said unto Him thy son liveth and he and his self believed and his whole house amen praise the Lord so once again we are grateful to the Lord for the opportunity as given to us to assemble together amen and he promised a watch worth three were gathered in his name will be dead so without any shadow that we know that the Lord is here and he comes in to minister unto his children and I just want us to encourage ourselves from the scripture that we have read blessed is he that believeth for there shall be a performance of those things which were taught a from the Lord there shall be a performance when God speaks there will be a performance there shall be a performance blessed is she that believeth for there shall be a performance the promise said when God gives a promise to you you don't have to be afraid whether it will come to pass or not he said you don't have to be afraid because God we always fulfill his word to the letter he said when God speaks hallelujah may God help us is that when the law speaks and we are afraid is that it is an insult to God a man was under the blood when a marriage was under the blood and feels afraid that God won't keep his word it is an insult to him when a man is afraid that God would keep his word it is an insult to God it is such our maker if he holds the whole world and the whole universe in his hands what are you afraid of afraid of what when we have so many examples what are we afraid of but no matter are ridiculous it looks like God we fulfill his weight and turn us in the scriptures in the beginning when God said let there be light you should remember the Bible tests are the earth was without form and void it was total darkness it was confusion it was a bad ship and God spoke the word and the power of the spoken word transformed that chaotic condition and made it a Garden of Eden [Music] the darkness fled hallelujah by the spoken word is when God sees God believes is wait sure but don't worry what does he worry no matter the situation happens look like no it doesn't matter to God because it is God and he believes his word and so we have been touched God send in a prophet God send a message and every age and every time is to bring us to that point to believe God not to resist with God not to question God it is not our problem God is going to do it because that is not your business if you promise me then it is your business to see to it that you keep the promise if you said you are going to give me something and or somebody and then what it is up to you to find a way to satisfy to construct to do what your promise it is not my business it's your business so when God gives the promise it is God's business it is not your business it's not my business because God is faithful therefore there shall be a performance remember the scripture told us in the book of Habakkuk is it the vision is for an appointed time he said even establish wait for it because it will speak at the end it will not say he may look like he's failing but it will fail because God is never in hurry we get in hurry and that make us to worry but God is never in hurry and God believes whatever he says and that is rocky does he worry [Applause] and remember that when his face is just behind it when he said let there be light is that if Matt I've taken thousands of years millions of years but that was not his problem him you know me light he never worried about that in in in the beginning the book of Genesis we have got a letter B letter B he does fix once leatherby like leather like car leather what that gather together let this be at the finish his and it does continue agree and I believe what is ice has children of God we are being expected to come to this watch to believe what our fantasies to take him at his word and to step right there and all the edges running I've been trying to do is to bring it to that point of realization believe what I said and like I said to be other people sooner I said stand up my train come on god bless you what's your name no that's not your name that's not your name what's your name ok that's not your name you could end this thing or that I want you to notice that when he was giving the name James and whatever name he didn't know about it when you give birth to a child and the baby is named that's the baby new but when the baby name is given what do we do we call it James bliss James when it does it will respond you call cinema [Laughter] listen the baby dancing no but the name is giving and we as parents we keep calling hello James hello DS and you can and Conti here suck it right off me shake here community speech that's Monday who give me the name my mama my papa give it up and give us a name [Applause] what is this sending messages to resist to call this is me that's what we're here for that's what we came to check that's why the word is preached to us because why the works were finished before the foundation of the wife you know when you give another what was finish before you came here the work was finished God has finished his work already he's trying to bring us into it to see this there is nothing you do to eat here so let us finish it and we just accept it our salvation was finished before the foundation of our healing before the foundation of the way all that we need yes provide that before you ever before there was in the creation the laughs was led in the mind of God before the foundation of the world and in fact it is finished it is finished it is finished your healing is finished the passage of elegance is finished salvation is finished the work of redemption is finished these that it is finished and we just read it up he said it is finished he said it is finished they keep looking at it that's him confessing that can testify in it amen listening don't be discouraged let's get Colleen pastor don't be discouraged Minister look let's keep raising it up this depressing Jesus key press in the world show it to the people we cannot heal but he is the healer he's the provider and the a forever provided it is just a matter of time for the manifestation of it and the man believes and said blessed is he that believeth for this'll be a performance of the face that a lot of smoking because this is already sector with the Lord brother Branham says even if Jesus Christ our Lord you cou country shall not hear me say I can't do it so I have already done it and that we are trying to do point it look at the sister look at the brother he doesn't because there is something about what you look like look look at even we read in the future joke a joke Jacob when he was saying with liver and his father-in-law and he wanted to answer he fits them in a way and they put some sticks before them the colour that he wants to the word he wonders if the colour of the ship what am i study bone he searched it and in a way that the animal just keep looking at it they look at it until when they give birth they give it to that column look unto me all ye ends of the earth look to Christ look to the word and when you look to him you become like him [Applause] [Music] listening to what there is nowhere reason can get you dead it is only to belief and we shall be a performance hallelujah Ragosa let that be he didn't doubt it he believed it he took along he might have taken millions of it that I didn't worry about it that is what he knew they will be obliged to be because it was finished before the foundation other so God is not in hurry he's waited for the manifestation of this word and he knows it will be made manifest hability and if we are sons and daughters of God we have been raised up we have been encouraged to look up to him to order to what he says and it will be made manifest no matter what they said there are not enough powers back of stroke that can stop me that'll hold him that connect is promised to fake nothing maybe not help us oh there shall be a performance hallelujah of those things that I've been struck him by the Lord and I remember when he speaks he has a program he has a purpose he has a reason remember is never in hurry it s s prayer in his own way and of a goddess the prophet of God said even when God said no is an answer to prayer [Music] listen when God says no is that the note of God is as good as his yeses therefore we should be rejoicing in the nurses and the yes is the same as to rejoice in the yes you must rejoice in the no because Marissa Elsa what is an Elsa so you rejoice o God said no Prince the Lord who you thank you Jesus Oh for saying no hallelujah because I want to be in this way [Applause] we should not be babies just because I look for this and I didn't get it so I cannot have God again I will serve the Lord no matter what I might have told you my story before when I lost my wife as I was a young man I was up to this yes ago I mean 20 since I was 36 years old and I mattered just for one year we just live about one year and yes we did I wish and everything seemed to be black back and I was am I going to face the world because I have preached yes we came out from denomination Presbyterian Chapman because we just got out together and we were young boys and gasps of preaching going to evangelism go to the villages and preacher and going to the I mean pretty in the busses preaches in the market area go to the hospital scream for people all these things were doing then we receive this message of the hour 1978 and we started preaching and condemn you are dismal nations and say then just married huh I went to the hospital I guess I just I look at sorry here comes the woman lying on this mission for me I got to the hospital I met the doctors for me to wait then necessay wait she might have happy last night I was praying god help me they come to say well yes tonight this and I stood as how am I going to face wood but in that stage standing there crying something spoke to my god don't make mistakes this is a big challenge for me but it's God don't make mistakes and so I got right there by the body and then I prayed as a god I know you don't make mistakes and I said God look if this is your will for me and we're going to save you so I was ready I don't understand but if this is your will I am going to save you it was a difficult time it was a great challenge to me I was just under 6 years old and in Africa with a lot of traditions and superstitions she died with it month of pregnancy in Africa it is a taboo forbidding abomination for such a sin to happen and then all over the towns huh yeah because we are rich and they said this why send these people and sure when it happened it went throughout our town going the first recipient of the message in our town am I going to do am I going to face it first the word it was difficult and then and they are they say yeah if he 7 got right why should this happen to him if he's 7 go this children they will be speaking big things against people now see they said this boy he cannot make it he will not be able to safeguard again he will start to drink he will start to do this but I said god help me if this is your will for me you give this right and it was the darkest hour very difficult him people come in and the summer then just coming to criticize look at me make mockery is difficult and now it was a chelate to my face and they want me to go through superstitions you have to do this rituals you have to dance do this if you don't do it the spirit of the dead we follow you ultras are difficult my father comes to me said look we can do this before you secretly nobody we don't know it you know him there no secret they will testify outside the words I said no but you know they have to take you in the in a cross from tradition they would take you midni but 2 a.m. to the ocean to the beach naked and you have to borrow see what happened I send over an oval-8 say but if you don't do it and they begin to tell me their experiences their superstitions and things they've seen and heard and taste but I said it's my god that I'm sorry if it's not able to take care of me I am ready to die I want to like them it was just a challenge attire but thank God for His faithfulness fender for his message what others were trying to pull me on the other side against the word of the Lord I had some few people that sent me no my son you have been tested Stanford and they begin to incarnate don't give up stay thank God for His grace thank God my spec finish and they said if you don't do out these things and you're married again that woman we died the same so even to get the woman to marry what's their problem because nobody wants to die hey it was not easy hell if I waited about five over four years or five years praying believe in God I married I have five children the our Libya we shouldn't give up no we should stand on what we believe just because of small fees and then I don't feel like going to church we are not serving God by feelings we are and what you stand for [Applause] [Music] with all our life like me I want my mother to baby me then I have a problem I went together I will follow that if you want I want my mother or my parent to baby me understand there is a big problem and you don't expect God to baby us all the time if we have been taught in this creatures whom he loveth he chasteneth we have been taught the messenger told us if you are longer to God God will let you to be tested he said the more longer you are the more the test and say if you have a triumph that means you find favor with God and God has confidence in you hey if I didn't God having confidence EU like a confidence in job and he said to Satan have you considered my servant job it was no job that cover the trier it was her job back off for the test it was gonna hold it if you have got that printed joke he said what about this one you have gotten this laugh but what about this one what about that one day and then listen the devil said to God is he is job 7 go for nothing he's inna because you made the edge of my job and you don't allowed nothing to touch him that I have a question how did the devil knew that there was the edge of a Jew how do you know because he said is it not because you marry Adam I so how did he know that this noise look how will anybody know unless you try to open it she must have tried and tried and tried and tried it isn't a job and remember this there is no way that I can get us because the believer has internal security if God offenses God if God allowed to arrest and trial then he wants to promote you [Music] [Applause] may God help us say sir we cannot be livid we must be made we must start a sons and daughters Lord and oneness of the faith as a soda shut death of the cross it's a sugar must endure hardness me and your Agnes be fan we should not be afraid may God give us strength and grease the Samm was sharing with me in the afternoon where he picked me from the airport about this when this navarre people their ships and whatever the midden is the one that is from coming tuna they released the ship to face to go to go into the stop not run well is the endometriosis according to the pattern that Noah I mean the dimension and the word Noah made is hot and the alcohol was meant to stand the challenges of the hour and that's what we must be married by the baptism of the Holy Ghost to start the challenges of the hour we don't run from it if in the line of duty and there is sexual a wish you start right there start on the world I know my belief and am persuaded that is able to keep our commitment to instruct girls that day that is another one - Sparrow from traction that is the time to be entrenched that is about to come to check that is the time to sing that is the time to worship God boy and sell us in prison when they were bitten and it was a privilege to suffer for him to better protect the gospel what we're doing today what will make a star so Lizzy and that every time you have to be ready everything you have to be bad before you come to church no way it should never be that way the time is to spank to go further than for us to be back and be please brother come to church no glory to God in the highest hey don't be afraid because God we do what he asked for mr. noon and I said what God said let there be light or let them what does be glad that to one side have taken millions of years slowly little by little little by little they what I begin to move because God has spoken and gonna lead to happy when he spoke about the seed of the woman in Genesis he knew net family to meet perform when instead of seed of the woman saw through the head of the serpent I put a meeting between you and the woman and your seed and he said he knew all that was going to happen he knew way sure he was nothing hurry because it will be fulfilled in their city in his path in this hour the same thing whatever God has spoken in our day in your in our lives percent us will be in this hour in the city we just have to make us as ready and there shall be a performance of a parent hey there's nothing that's not reason to doubt and to question you enjoy it he because he's the same yesterday today and forever is that I am God and I'll change yet not a siege yes so why is your world why do you worry what's your trouble then what you feel what are we afraid of oh god

to be smooth for us knowing that we are in the winner but we know like pasta hahaha go to a poor my grace is sufficient for you my strength is made perfect in style of witness God's grace is sufficient for us you believe that he God said so and we just have to say what we just have to confess what got us because remember is said he would not give us one fire too much to bear no Trier would be too much for us he would not give us one saya too much he knows what you can stop hey stop to encourage yourself God knows what I can stand he loves you too much and he cannot give you something that you cannot carry no I can go do that I can give you a problem and give you a note or said that you cannot carry never do that he loved you the devil want to tell you that it doesn't love you the devil wants you to believe he doesn't care they'd ever want you to believe that your own is too much [Applause] how can God give something that we can obey how can he give us something to much for Beth said that is a liar girl love you and God cares for you and God is mindful of you and God's watching over you hallelujah it's not is that you go to try us but it makes us it fix us like you told us gorgeous you know the condition of the age so it prepares the messenger for the age and not only by the people the man of the hour touches the people the Allah so knowing the condition of the age he prepares a message and a message and he proposed also we believe the message all that is happening today God knows about it this one said that this was God God knows all about it because if
