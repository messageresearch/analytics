evident to see different ones are sick and I just had um some that I had checked on here today that at least was aware of and uh I can see there are some others as well that um would be maybe not not feeling well so we want to just hold one another up in prayer me the Lord would just just move for each one of these [Music] needs you know I'd love I'd love to be able to have a thought that in right now in this life that we'll never experience sickness and discomfort but you know if it wasn't for that it wouldn't we wouldn't be reminded that we're still in these temporary bodies and God also manifested that attribute of healing we won't need that attribute of healing on the other side but we need it right now amen so we want to just lift up amen different ones in prayer and uh I want to also remind you of the U the the men's fellowship breakfast there um I want to say thank brother Shane for putting that together and uh that'll be at 8:00 there at at Bob Evans there in Amherst this this Saturday if you uh don't have the address it's right there and uh you might say I don't like Bob Evans join the party we're we're going there just just to have some fellowship amen and so uh we're just so thankful for that amen and I want to say thank you for um your prayers while we were gone and uh last weekend there to uh brother Nathan's there in Jeffersonville the Lord was certainly gracious to us in the services there and so let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer Heavenly Father we love you Lord Jesus thank Lord to say that we are needy would be like an understatement Lord we so need you Lord father even in the times that Lord that we would feel so strong those are some of the greatest times that we need you Lord so I pray that Lord that you would just help us here tonight Lord I know there's many Lord of your children that they would desire to be here Lord father you see Lord with the things that we would battle sickness Lord and father things Lord that would want to come and take its toll upon our bodies but how we're reminded Lord that one day there Lord be no more sickness there'll never be another prayer request Lord that is given Lord we will stand there Lord Jesus in bodies like your own Glory his body but Lord through the midst of this time may you manifest and minister to each one that attribute of healing Lord I pray dear God you know Lord the needs within each and everybody Lord each life Lord and may you just minister to them Lord those that are here those that's not able to be here Lord may you Minister strength to each one go go to them Lord right now I pray May the Holy Spirit just move upon their bodies Lord and their conditions Lord the prayer cloth that I hold preach with here tonight Lord I pray that God that as this would be applied Lord to the need Lord may you move Lord I pray upon the scene Lord as Lord we agree together as you said in your word if two or three agree is touching any one thing it shall be done now father we're standing Lord on your word there's no more no sure place that we could stand than on the word of God now Lord we ask that you would just take your word tonight speak to us Lord help us as a body to get out of the way Lord may you minister to each one Lord God according to our ability our understanding Lord may you speak to our hearts Lord I pray have your way in this service Lord and we would ask all these things Lord For Your Glory in Jesus precious name amen amen and amen amen let's look at Job 26 here tonight and I want to just read back into those verses there there and if the Lord will help us I'd like to get into the second part of that verse of verse number two but job answered verse one of job 26 job answered and said how hast thou helped him that is without power how savest thou the arm that hath no strength and that's where I'd like to just draw a little thought from here tonight on that how savest thou the arm that hath no strength amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I'd like to just speak here tonight if the Lord would help us go ahead Brandon if the Lord would help us I'd like to deal with that with that thought on uh the flowing of virtue maybe there let's try it again there we go the flowing of virtue and I just just having these thinking upon this in this manner and I want you just to think of of virtue as how that you'll see down through the scriptures in the no in the New Testament where it would be given that a virtue and how that God's Prophet would would go in to express this that this is God's strength it's God's power and it's part of of our uh the attributes or the even the virtues that would be a part of a Believer or to dwell within our lives and so we know that within this that job when he is expressing to these Brethren that came to him and remember as we have been looking at this that uh these Brethren brother brandham refers to him in 1964 Jesus came and called and he said it would be like the deacons of job's Church church and when you think of that you know that a deacon is one that would have to be proven a lot of times even how within that where a man's name could be given or recommended or feel like it and there's a lot of search that's got to be made and prayer within all that so evidently these would be men that would be of Integrity as well there would be a part within their life that would be blameless and and so we recognized that these were not men that had come to job uh and with any wrong intention but they would have been men that would have had great intentions but as we've been looking at that sometimes of the greatest intentions that we can have the discernment can be off and if there's things that we what we need what we need so greatly in this hour is the discernment of the Holy Spirit I think with the truth and all that God has given and what he's restored to us and even with the things that God has revealed in our life sometimes times there's things where we have to stop and we have to pray and then look at Lord how do I apply this it's not it's not hard you know to uh to go through and just to have a quote and we can finish the rest of it there's you know with my mind and memory I wish it was like that and other things a lot of times I can finish that uh maybe a quote that is said and then finish that out but that that's not what it is by the applying of the word of God it's where that when we can see within that and many times it isn't even necessarily where we are quoting a scripture or quoting a quote but it's actually where God is showing us how to approach a situation and it actually is the word of God that's being lived out in our lives and we're giving the right away to it and so one of the things that when we look at it that sometimes we may not feel you know as if it's just as if it's not as spiritual if I don't say a quote or if I don't say a scripture and I believe in all that but there's many times that when we look at it Lord I want to know what how do I approach this situation or how do I do I Minister there to my wife or to my husband or to family or to another brother or sister or someone else along the way and and notice how God when we begin to go before him Lord God will always have a basis and that basis will always be that of his word you you'll always find that there's something that'll move in your heart of a scripture a quote something that will come to you so it'll always be the basis of how that we were actually moving and acting upon him and so when you look here in this part of the scripture when uh when job would ask them the question how savest thou the arm that hath no strength now you and I both know that there's not one of us that can save another person remember how brother brandham was accused of being a Divine healer and he's brother Bram said well that that's that that does that didn't makees sense at all you're not a divine Savior you don't save anybody that's not I I'm not the one who heals anybody but to say that God would use a vessel to operate through in order for someone's Faith to be lifted in order to receive the the work of healing in their bodies of what God has already made available to them that's the same way it is with salvation the preaching of the word it actually brings the faith into the people to recognize the finished work of Calvary and for that reality to break upon a heart that he did it for me and that I'm saved and see that's all a work of God and God has had a channel that he could speak through Express through to bring that to you and I and so I want to just say it in this way when we look at this on the flowing of virtue that it's God's God desires there would be channels that he would operate through and that would be you and I and God would desire that that life would work and flow through the body and I want you to think of this too in order to be saved the scripture would tell us here in Romans 5:6 for when we were yet without Strength In Due Time Christ died for the ungodly so we we were without strength now down through the Old Testament you would find that God would send a word and there was an elect group of people that lived down through the Old Testament is that right and within that there was a measure of the the Holy Spirit they never experience the redeeming work of that of the new birth but they would experience the spirit of God coming upon their life as they would take that word that God would speak through that Prophet the minor Prophet would follow a major prophet calling them back to the word of God and there was an elect of God that would heed to that word and they by receiving that word would receive the strength that they needed at that time to be able to stand faithfully and that's how we read of it in the in Hebrews chap 11 by faith it's that Revelation that they received of God that strength that they received so when we were without Strength In Due Time Christ died for the ungodly so in order for this strength to come to you and I that we had need of in order to save you and I to redeem you and I it required that one would come on our behalf and it couldn't be anybody else but God him himself it was God's desire to bring this same strength his life back into his children once again and so notice when we were without Strength In Due Time Christ died for the ungodly and notice then as as the Lord Jesus would Express this even to Peter I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren so prior to conversion Peter did not have the ability to strengthen the Brethren as according to what the Lord Jesus was talking about this would come after P Peter's experience on the day of Pentecost where he would actually receive the strength that he lacked in his life well what strength did he lack he walked with the Lord Jesus he fished with him he fellowshipped with him but when it came time to stand in the midst of adversity remember he denied him three times is that right he turned he didn't have the strength God you know that was all part of Prophecy in scripture Smite the shepherd and the Sheep will be scattered that was all part of it but notice that that within this he is speaking to him that Peter when you are converted in other words when you have become a channel that the Holy Spirit can operate that my strength can flow through you to others and I believe with all my heart that not only has God intended that the strength it is it is it is absolutely to operate through the body that's how life travels that because when you look at the unic when the unic was down there remember he was reading in Isaiah and he's looking there and he's saying uh he doesn't understand in Isaiah 533 who's the prophet speaking of and God transports Phillip from the meeting in Samaria there's no way that he took a normal Transportation it was Supernatural Transportation God brought him there to where there was a need and when he begin to come near he drew near to The Chariot as the spirit led him and he begin to speak to this unic and the unic said and when he asked him how do you understand what you're reading he said how can I except some man should guide me and and Philip began in the scriptures and begin to preach unto him Jesus Christ and notice the the result was is that man he had taken him all the way not only into water baptism but that man was a fit candidate to walk as a Son of God after that why he had received strength he just didn't have knowledge that the atonement has come but that man because Phillip standing there as a vessel the life came through the body and it birthed that man into the body of Jesus Christ God intends there's no other way outside of the body of Jesus Christ and you know what his life does coming through the body it only begot it only brings forth more of his own kind Sons and Daughters of God this is why this message when we look at it it's not something that that would be altogether new but it is that which God is restoring us back to the faith that was once delivered to the Saints to where that in this hour we have been brought to a place to come in contact with Jesus Christ in a personal way to have a real fellowship and a real experience with almighty God to where his life is flowing through you and I and coming to a place to where there's nothing in the word of God that our life our soul would not punctuate with an amen that's the strength of the word of God operating in our life it doesn't matter what we look like on the outside doesn't matter what we feel like it it that that's not it at all it's the strength of God that is operating through the Believers oh my and you know the think of it is even the powerful thing when I think of it as it comes to me right now remember Sister Hatty right as she sat there in her house and you know her simple agreeing with God's word what a respect that she had and with that simple agreeing with God's word you know as I as I talk with some of the different ones that were there and to know about how her house was Sister Hattie's house would not have been a house that that any king or president would have wanted to come to you could see right through the boards to the outside yet it was a place where brother Bram loved to come and fellowship with different ones and we've been right around there to see it where it would be upon the hill and here she is standing there when the word is coming forth and she said that ain't nothing but the truth and notice her agreeance with the word of God from her heart it brought a super anointing into that room the prophet called it a super anointing he said that anointing filled the room and she was and then her request or was given to her ask what you will and she said what should I ask for and brother BR says that that's up to you and he be to lay out different things God would have given her any request of her heart but she asked for the Salvation of her boys and the prophet said right there he said God those boys who were snickering and laughing at the testimonies being told about the squirrels the power of God came in that room it broke that snickering and it brought salvation and filled them with the Holy Ghost what did that simple agreeance and obedience to the word of God let me tell you friends you want to invite the power of God and the strength of God to move down let our hearts let everything within us let it say Amen to the word of God Amen virtue will flow right through the word of God that lays transforming power and notice how the scripture would tell us in Ephesians chapter 6 finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might now over and over you find this theme throughout the Old Testament even into the New Testament even in there in the book of Zechariah where he would look at the candlesticks and say and what is this not by might not by power but by my spirit sayeth the Lord if there's any achievement or any accomplishment in our life it must be by his Spirit but it takes our yielding to God in order for God to do what he wants to do how many to say Lord help me yield help me yield Lord so when we look at this then really the strength that's in the church God in the church becomes its strength because the prophet would tell us like this in the message contest he would say you know the word is God and the word becomes our strength God in the church becomes its strength notice God in the church so when we're talking about the word we're not talking about the letter we're talking about the spirit it's the spirit that gives life the letter we can have all knowledge and listen knowledge is a part of it we need to know what belongs to us but the spirit of God is what actually gives life and brings the word of God into a place in our life to where that word is now operating in strength in our life and we see the strength of God operating in and through our lives we see our desires have changed we see a strength on the inside that's greater than our own reasoning ability because you know why because the very judgment seat of Christ has come into the heart of the believer once you have been born again of the spirit of God and there's a place where your sins are taken daily oh my thank God for that strength on the inside that operates there within our lives so it's God's strength operating within our lives God in the church now let me just read here a few places in the scripture the Bible says in that day shall the Lord of hosts be for a Crown of Glory what day is that that's this day this is the day where the crown is being set upon that of the Bride of Jesus Christ what are we crowned with we're crowned with his own life and eventually Our Lives will be crowned with that theophany body notice the Lord of hosts will be for a Crown of Glory and for a diadem of beauty unto the residue of his people and for a spirit of judgment to him that Seth in judgment brother BR said that's what he does for us at the altar and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate so where what is the gate the gate is where transactions have taken place the gate is where that the transaction was taking place for Boaz to redeem Naomi Jesus suffered without the gate so there has been a settling of every transaction so where is our strength our strength is for everyone that will turn the battle to the gate he is my source of strength this is why that within every dispute and anything the enemy wants to bring about I'm coming right back to the word I'm coming right back to the Lord Jesus Christ no lay aside my feelings because if I go by my feelings go by my thoughts Then I then I it'll never actually judgment will never be executed in the right way I'll never receive the strength that I need in that situation notice in Isaiah 33 verse 5 and 6 the Lord is exalted for he dwelleth on high he hath filled Zion with judgment and righteousness and wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times and strength of Salvation the fear of the Lord is his treasure what a powerful scripture what that that judgment and righteousness discernment and that righteousness of God's own life operating together and that in itself will bring bring about the stability within our lives I I'm thankful for the reality of the stableness of God's strength that it brings within our lives amen aren't you notice it's his strength now in in Psalms 28:7 the Bible says the Lord is my strength you'll find David write of this many many many many times the Lord is my strength and my shield my heart trusted in him and I am helped therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth and with my song will I praise him the Lord is their strength and he is the saving strength of his anointed not only is he your strength my strength but even in the midst of those times where we need saving and I'm not talking about once God has saved you it isn't that you need to be saved again but there are times that within the midst of our life whether it's a mind battle whether it's situations we're in a trap or something has come along the way but he is our the saving strength in other words there is delivering power in him when we can look to him I I tell you don't ever be ashamed to look to him well listen we always want to be honest with him I don't want to put on no face with him I don't want to act like everything well Lord everything's all right we don't have to act with him we can be right honest with him Lord I need strength Lord father I need help Lord and He is saving strength to his anointed oh God help us that's our strength that's not our weakness that's strength oh glory be to God oh my the Bible would talk about how that he gives power to the faint and how to them that have no might he increaseth strength even the youth shall faint and be weary and the young man shall utterly fail but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength and they shall Mount up with wings as an eagle they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint now yet there are times of weariness there are times of fainting but not in our soul once he's ever strengthened that Soul that's that's the great the great Paradox we have this treasure in earn vessels there's times where we might get faint where we can get weary but this is the different when his strength is coming to us I'm not depending on my strength like like you young you young men that have strength and young that's the glory of your youth the glory uh is your strength but you know we're not depending on our strength you're depending on the strength of the Lord you're not living this life because my goodness I've got this all figured out it's not your strength it's God's strength inside of you operating his word right through your life as a Young Man a young lady we would faint but God gives strength on that inside to where it's a stability it holds Us in the midst of those times oh yeah we we can get weary we can get down brother Ram talks about it over and over and over and notice I want you to think of how of this very word this is a word that you know I know it's a scriptural word but it's a word that I would say that is very uh very much in the vocabulary of message Believers it's preeminence because it's dealing with what God's desire is for is for preeminence is where that in this hour this this is the time God could not have full preeminence now listen to the words I'm saying full preeminence he couldn't have it in the days of Luther he couldn't have it in the days of Wesley he did didn't have it in Aza Street Pentecost but it is in the evening time when there has come a word of restoration in the evening time God's Own Spirit to bring us back fully to the word of God God's Own Life coming in you and I and restoring us as Sons and Daughters of God they had their part now notice Luther lived out and they were to live or give preeminence to the just shall live by faith and that's all God will hold him accountable for Wesley gave preeminence to not only justification but un sanctification that's all God will hold them accountable for when the when the gifts Begin to Fall there in 1906 at ausa Street God they gave themselves to that remember they all the way down through when God's word more and more of his light more of the light more of the word would come there would be those that would stand up and they would refute it they would reject it and you know what they were doing they were rejecting life that's the danger you know we can carry this around but if we reject life we reject the very god of the word that's there to make that word live but here in the evening time God promised that he would restore God promised there would come a real Union back to where between Christ and his bride to where the word would have preeminence not you know look at look look if if we're looking out of scripture and man can explain one part of this Bible away to where that we can look at it and say well I don't have to adhere to that then then what about the rest of it amen what about I mean what what do we believe what what scripture is Vindicated and and what do we take are you hearing me because then you see in this hour this is where the message of the hour is not the thoughts of men trying to figure out God's program it's God's program being revealed to you and I and God's program is that he might live in the church and operate his word through our lives that virtue would flow through our lives my Hallelujah preeminence in other words first place to give Chief to see it's just as simple as this as God when God begins to take a hold of a life listen let me tell you you've got a goal but you can't get to that goal if you run a race you don't get to that goal by all of a sudden just hopping there you got to come step by step part of the way let me tell you it begins with simple just a simple part of looking at the word of God and saying yes Lord I give myself to you Lord and keep reading keep praying keep giving yourself to the word of God and you'll find things in your life that you look at and say that's impossible you'll find the strength of God that'll operate right through the word of God and as you pray you'll find habits begin to be broken you'll find strength begin to move in your life it's not a mystery it's the Simplicity of Jesus Christ operating through his word hallelujah I say boo devil boo devil amen reading just simple and reading the I don't feel anything reading the word of God praying and listening to the message and say God be unto me according to that word oh my there's power in that word glory be to God preeminence notice how brother BR says this in the message the contest I just want to read the first little bit and skip to the last line he's praying and saying God make us fit servants forgive our past bless our future guide us oh Lord with thy Mighty hand Jehovah then he's asking God's blessing upon ministers L visitors be with us Lord we're servants and we give ourselves holy to you for I wonder if we couldn't say instead of 1963 for Lord 2025 what for what that the power of your spirit might have more pinenes in our life and and in our being see it's a constant it's that constant reflection that constant fellowship with him the drawing from him I want that word to have more preeminence I want him to have more preeminence in my life now notice this is where that there comes a planting of Courage every time when the Bible tells us that the word is a seed and as that word would go forth the word is actually actually being sewn now when you know when a when a seed comes forth It's got to find ground to bed in and when it ground when it comes into that bedding ground it doesn't all of a sudden produce something necessarily right away there's some trees just like what we have out here a lot of them you see that are if you walk back there in any way a lot of them that's fallen over is many of them they're not necessarily oak trees but there are other forms of trees Beach and things like that that don't have a real strong root system and then you H them growing out there with the rest of them it's not real strong but there is a planting of courage and that's what God's desire is is that the word itself would so find its Mark within our lives and then what we do with it is what matters you see Satan would love nothing more than when we walk right out of here if somehow along the way he'll try to Spring a trap upon us maybe the next day or maybe in the evening and he's what he's trying to do is take us away from that that point of reflection and giving ourselves to that word we've received and if he can't do that then through a trap what he'll try to do is come and condemn you for failing in some way but let me just say this to you that all along the way when we rub shoulders with the world and everything else we are going to fail from time to time but that is not what I'm looking at or fixated on if we fail let's come back and say Lord forgive me and then take that word that that God has sown and he's planted in our hearts and begin to water it and how do we water it with prayer and Thanksgiving that's how we do it Lord I Thank you for your word I thank you Lord for for deliverance I thank you for strength I thank you for the Holy Ghost begin to thank God you say well how can I thank God if I don't already have something yet but when you've received that Word of Promise into your life there is an assurance that comes with that that God will make good on every promise he's given so planting courage this is why the prophet would say even in that message the contest Lord help me that I might say something that would plant courage in the heart of thy people you see we don't want just something that gives us courage just for this moment I think there's times for that don't you H there's times for that you can see that a lot of times you know maybe God will take a service it might might might come right through the pastor God will use an evangelist and somehow it'll be something that all of a sudden it'll just ignite and right then and there and our faith is just spontaneous it's God sovereignly working it's not man trying to work it up it's God just sovereignly moving within that moment now to me I don't care whether God wants to do it right away or his word it's going to come through me praying and praising him and thanking him for it irregardless it's God that's going to do the work and it is just as strong let me tell you something a miracle is just as powerful if you were standing right here in need in your life and you were healed right here while the word is coming forth or you're prayed for it you know the prophet actually said it's a greater Miracle to take a promise of God like Abraham did and go for 25 years A lot of times we we don't think that way we we think of a miracle happening in a certain way but remember it's a miracle every day of your life is a miracle it's a miracle you're setting right here tonight don't let Satan try to downplay that you have fought through Devils today in order to be here and God has given you strength God has let singing come your way there's been anointed songs scriptures and and cloths and things that have been said and has given you and I the strength to stand right there every moment of the day it's a miracle friends and I tell you what it's going to be a miracle and we'll change one of these moments and it'll be worth it all but in the meantime he is the very source of our strength so we want to receive that word into our lives and allow it to be planted in us this is why the scripture would say if you abide in me and my words abide in you then ask what you will and it shall shall be done that's really incredible because when we're really abiding in him and we know to abide in him it's to be in him by his spirit and yet if a person could actually walk and live in Christ and Paul said if you live in him walk in him also so in other words I I'm thankful for what he's done in my life man that's I mean that there's a joy but as we begin to mature and grow we recognize that Lord I I I help me Lord that in everything of the word that that I'm receiving and help me Lord that that just to abide in the word of God there's a benefit for dwelling in the presence of God and his words and my words abide in you now notice then you will ask what you will and it shall be done no because this is all God's mind God's desire God's heart that is moving within our lives as Believers how would you and I even know what to even ask for if God didn't speak it to our hearts see it's God speaking it to our hearts and never said you ever leave out of a service whether here or somewhere else and it's just something has so touched your heart in such a way you just and it's not like you're trying to get it off your mind you just can't get it off your mind and here you are you're just thinking about that word and begin to pray about it it's so touched you Lord I I I just I want to just become so one with that word I want to see it live within my life Lord there's something about it Lord God I just how you spoke to me and it's things that we begin to dwell upon that and meditate upon that word and his words are there abiding in our life I tell you there's a lot of things that try to fill our lives lot of things is that right lot of things of the world there's a lot of things that I know just normal taxing business and things like that that once sometimes it just gets so much on our minds but yet there's always a battle for our attention a battle for our meditation but you know what there is a way that the word is able to abide and able also to handle all those other things of Life listen don't don't set don't set the word on the shelf and try to tackle everything of life let the word be the first priority in your life then the word will give you the strength and direction and the discernment you need with the task that you're in life now notice brother bam is talking about this this scripture in the message perfect faith and he's talking about how that the Lord Jesus that flowing from his life that's what we're talking about tonight the flowing of virtue and how that in his life he he walked in a world of perfect Faith a perfect faith in the perfect word of God it was a it was a place to where it was a complete rest and a complete trusting in what God or what the word had actually made him brother B will say that over and over what the word had actually made him and then brother Rand will also talk to us in the first part of that message and go all the way through of how that we've got to be in a position to receive this perfect Faith now we recognize that in order to be be in position it had to be the word that's brought us into position is that right and there's also those times that we realize faith for healing in our bodies the word that I I don't know how it's going to be I don't know if it's going to be operation I don't know you know if it's going to be through hands are laid on medicine I don't know how it's going to come to pass but I know that God is the Healer of that of that need in my body so when we look to God for Faith itself to be able to drop down into the bedding ground now I can't make that Faith drop you or I can't make that Faith drop we can stand right on the word of God right here tonight as you come up for prayer and we'll stand right on that word I believe it the shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover anybody else believe that I believe that that is the word of Almighty God I've witnessed God do that right here in these Services I've witnessed God touch lives in this service I've witness here just two weeks ago some of you may have already left but sister Maria stood right here she came up after many had already left there was only a hand fuel standing right here and sister Maria came right up here and she talked to me about God had already moved for her knee he said and she's telling me how that her arm remember she couldn't even lift her arm up and right there in the service the spirit of God moved moved right down and she was able to lift up her arm and she stood right here to testify about it you know what it was God moving sovereignly by his word he had already given her a promise and here it was God came by and made good on that promise and I'm going to tell you that's what the devil's mad about is those testimonies that sister Maria's given and I'm going to tell you just like I told that liar today you're nothing but a liar God's word is the truth God's word stands as a Triumph by his Strife sister Maria is healed amen I believe that with all my heart notice how God's desire is that that word that it would so flow in our lives I you know I I can't determine you can't determine when that's going to drop but what you and I are responsible for is making sure the channel is available amen that it can drop that that faith can drop Now watch how brother B talks about this virtue remember you can read this how the New Testament virtue flowing out from him they would Touch the Hem of His Garment and you know virtue and they would receive healing in their body brother Brandon would say it like this he says now if ye abide in me through him he brought the word to you and my words abide in you then walk in the same kind of a way virtues flowing from you the rivers of of God's Fountains of blessings just flowing out to the people now he goes on to say you're not imagining it because that won't do any good now you know Jesus was not working himself into a place like this now I think I think it's I think it's something that maybe if you're going to pray for somebody or pray for a situation sometimes even going into certain meetings or prayer lines or whatever more there's just certain ways and even that even how I approach certain with services and things like that cuz you never know even right here you never know exactly what you're going to be dealing with but you notice that within this part of it where virtues itself would would actually would actually flow out to the people it was something that was present in his life in other words it was kind of like you know uh this you know these Outlets we got Outlets all along the wall you got Outlets electrical outlets right there you know those Outlets there's power right there in those Outlets all I have to do is take something that's a able to channel that and plug into it now you know I can't use a European plug on that I can't use the standards they use in in in Australia I've got all those different converters that I have to use when I go places but you know what there's electric that's there what I have to do is just tap into it and that's the same way it was with the Lord Jesus virtue was already there he didn't receive virtue to minister to that need but virtue was already there and let me just say this to you with virtue being in your life it isn't altogether many times that you necessarily feel something at that moment sometimes even a word that is actually being spoken even sometimes of laying a hand and shaking hands with someone else praying for someone else many times when here after praying for different ones my goodness it's just like it'll take it right out of you I feel just like a ragd doll it's more than sometimes even when I would preach it just virtue would leave you sometimes even with counseling the way that it would just leave in that moment and and man I'm just like a ragd doll call my wife talk to me talk to me talk to me help me get home you're just weak it's gone out of you it's virtue Why did Why was it me giving out virtue no it was needs within the people that was actually drawing and drawing upon that of the Throne of God it wasn't me but my weakness is because of that in my human body that's Hallelujah but I'm saying it in this way that sometimes that virtue it can flow we're not determining how it will flow sometimes I've been in situations that even that I wasn't even intending to go one time I went to sit down and to exchange and exchange a brother you know and take a brother and I S down and I be soon as I I wasn't even attended on going I was going to ask brother the bill Wen them uh because I was real weary I was going to ask them if they would if they would help me and and take him and when I sat down at that table I turned and I just all of a sudden after a little bit of talking I looked to that brother and I said brother how's everything going and as soon as I said that all of a sudden at that moment the tears just started coming he and his wife of some things that had just that they had just been going through I had no idea and but I realized at that moment this is why I'm here this is why I felt compelled to come here and you know at that moment when I sense that I just said Lord help me if it's just to listen help me be a good listener if there's a word that you want me to say Lord God I'm Available to You Lord but I realized at that moment it was a moment it wasn't that they didn't have strength but you know what we receive virtue travels through the body is that right just like those that we would pray for even as the word is being ministered it's virtue that's flowing through the body so this this is where the secret of how that this virtue would flow through our lives abide if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it shall be done this is why the scripture would tell us that blessed is that man that doesn't set in the seat of the scornful he doesn't want he doesn't stand in the way of Sinners he's not there among the ungodly but he Delights in the law of the Lord L he meditates in it day and night and he shall be like a tree the Bible says amen that's planted By the Waters and the waters just flowing through it bearing the fruit of God in his season notice brother BR says it like this in the message the token and he just come through before he makes this statement and he's talking about when the life of God has come into your life it's not that of just a human being but you become a super super super human being because it's God's Own Strength operating through you and I anybody ever felt incapable yeah besides me anybody ever felt in incapable and we come into those places like that and you know what it's coming into a place if we can just realize it it's God us yielding to the strength that's within us that's strength that God has instilled within our lives and to and to just draw from that place to where you know what I may not know in my mind the answer to this right now but I know the God I know the god of the Bible I know the God of this message and I know what he's done in my life and that's a strength that's a source where we can draw from brother M says the life of God just flowing from you like Sparks from an anvil as you walk full of virtue and love and gentleness as the holy Holy Spirit moving and speaking one of the key things is is full of how many of you like me you have to go and you got to gas up every once in a while right I mean you know sometimes you could say how many times you got to gas up your truck depends depends on what depends on how many trips I make depends on where I'm going it's not an endless supply right I mean even with the the electric car the Teslas and whatever more what is about 430 some miles before you have to actually plug them back in so it's not endless and let me just say this to you or I neither when we look at it in our lives can we drift away from the presence of God and expect to have the virtue that's needed in our lives sometimes listen it is I want you to understand this you begin to recognize this virtue is not altogether about about you because this virtue that I'm speaking about is a is is that of God's strength that operates through our lives after we have been born again of the spirit of God and you know what it doesn't diminish it only grows greater in our lives the more that you and I can surrender but if we take the approach and say well I think you what thank God I mean God has done such a work in my life man I don't desire sin no more there ain't nothing nothing in the word of God that I wouldn't say Amen to but listen when the when life has come to you it not only has brought you to a place as a son and daughter of God but the prophet would preach the message that day on Calvary and he said I believe the church and he said brandom Tabernacle has forgotten that we are Sons and Daughters of God isin't it amazing because when Brandon Tabernacle first started out how the love of God was so thick among them and the prophet would talk about that but there was a drifting so much to where I heard the prophet here the other day he said it used to be when somebody would come to the altar to get saved he said oh my how the mothers would break up they would cry he said and now when one comes to the altar they sat there and chew chew and gum brandom Tabernacle he said what's happened they've got a away from hearing that still Small Voice you've got to stay in that place you see reality when this life has come to us it brings a burden upon your life to where the Lord what can I do for you Lord how can I reach others you see listen The Life of Christ does not come to edify selfishness it does not make us more selfish well I don't need nobody else I'm saved glory to God and going to the Rapture that is not how it's going to work it's something within our lives we we want to do something for somebody there's is a desire that moves in our life and yet Satan's desire is to so paralyze that part in our life to where we hear the preaching on the token and that is necessary without the token and the baptism of the Holy Ghost you'll never make the Rapture but listen when the token is come it is Christ that now is operating through your life and there is a flow of love there's a flow of gentleness there's a flow of virtue in other words if there's a flow that means there's got to be an inlet and an outlet God's holy spirit does not produce stagnant man-made cist is that right so he is now the strength of Our Lives he's our strength can I have just a few more moments so we didn't have last Thursday so we'll just try to put num just but I want you to think of this this word responsibility every one of us have a responsibility I have a responsibility to pray give myself to the word of God you do too I have it in a manner to to study there's responsibilities all that that I have but you know what I could do all of that but my personal walk with God I want you to understand me my personal walk with God is Not not all my studying all the studying that I do a man could study and study and study and be backsliding because he's not walking with a personal relationship with God can know so many things with scriptures and yet he's got himself so isolated away from the spirit of God what has God done that no it's where man himself failing to get in the presence of God but I tell you that that's our responsibility is to get into his presence and my responsibility is not to find something to preach I I don't go looking for things to preach but it's things that you can get into God's presence and all of a sudden there'll be something drop right here drop right here drop right there and God knows how to bring all that together even how he knows how to give you and I the wisdom and direction we need in our lives now watch this brother BM says it like this in the in the message Moses My Help Cometh From Above and I must stay in contact with God constantly if I expect to help someone else but say brother Samuel he was the prophet for this age that's true and he took that responsibility very seriously but you see where it lays before you and I I don't want to just do something in order to be a help to somebody this but it's recognizing the value of that relationship and it can be through your life that someone else would be touched by God let me just let me let me skip here let me just i' I've got to move ahead here to this to this point everybody okay I want you to think of this here and we look at virtue and I'll just close with this tonight brother Brown would pick this up here in the Statue of a perfect man and this virtue and how that it would go out flow out of the life of the Lord Jesus and you remember that within that statue of a perfect man here we have faith its virtue its knowledge its Temperance on up to the very Capstone himself this is this is what we're called to in this hour but yet it all begins with the new birth the prophet said without being born again it's just us trying to put in peacock feathers to a blackbird so it has to be him that does the adding our faith grows virtue grows but if you'll notice every one of those I wish I wish I would have put that up here tonight but every one of those those those points they don't grow independently it's all connected and based on faith It's all where faith and what is Faith it's Revelation faith is where there's its Revelation it's strength that's coming in to to to to that of the Church of the Living God it comes into that virtue and knowledge and all those things it works out in our life so it's not separate things that say I'm going to work on faith once I get Faith then I'm going to work on virtue and once I get virtue then I'm going to work on knowledge no no that's not how it is at all it's God working and bringing to pass all the way through your life because it's a continual growing in your life your patience grows your knowledge of God's word Grows Right Temperance which is self-control grows is that right brother Bram says it like this when he's talking about the the statue of perfect man and we look right here and we can see that that Lily that's over there and man how that Lily has had to struggle It Came from Beneath the pond what was it doing it was making its way up towards the light What drew it from the bottom of the pond what Drew you from beneath the muck and the gum everything that was around us it was the light and as we keep drawing going to the light what is it the light is quickening quickening quickening quickening until eventually we've overcome we're above that muck that we was born in and then as we come above that then here comes that Lily and what was the whole purpose of that Lily remember the the the scriptures would tell us consider the Lily and how that Solomon and His glory was not AR raid like one but notice it's it it speaks of that life that has come forth and then when that life has come forth look now there is a source for those bees butterflies others to draw from Brother Bram says I wonder he said what if that bee would come around to that Lily and the Lily would say insufficient funds brother BR said what if it would when some would come to us and he said they want to draw upon virtue and it comes back insufficient funds there's got to be virtue and brother BR says with that virtue he says he had virtue talking about the Lord Jesus to give to the people so it wasn't just he was just you know getting a warehouse and he was a walking Warehouse of virtue that's not why virtue was present in the Son of God that virtue was to be given out the purpose of that Lily is to give forth its life it's not for everybody to come around and say man what a beautiful thing yet we do we look at that my how beautiful that is but that's not the purpose the purpose is that it would have virtue in order to be able to give out to others brother Bram would say it like this he says look if he had virtue to give to the people he expects us to have virtue to give to the people if he had virtue he expects us to have virtue to give to the people is that right Bible said not only they shall lay hands on the sick they shall recover but sometimes it's even the words that would be spoken sometimes it's through things as we've been looking at friends when we talk about the word being made manifest sometimes there's things that get lost in that what does that mean when the word is made manifest well sure it's God's life on display but God has so many different avenues that that word will work right through and you know think about it when you look at how that in job's life job was a man who was a man of the word right he he read the Bible the Bible in the heavens he didn't have a written bible but he had that which was wrote in the heavens but he had Revelation from God and he was standing on his burnt offering is that right yeah amen but that which was working in job's life it was not something that was just kept for himself job was a man that virtue traveled through his life not just when he was in the pull pit not just when he was under that anointing as the prophet of God and receive that inspiration but through his life there was virtue that was given to others look at this scripture in job 29: 11 when the ear heard me this is job recalling these events in his life then it blessed me when the eyes saw me it gave witness to me because I delivered the poor that cried and the fatherless joob how did you deliver them how did you do that it wasn't me but I was available and there was one that was crying that was in need maybe they were in villages far away maybe God revealed what they were praying he was a prophet but then again maybe he didn't and it could be that job was just in the right place under the leading of the Holy Spirit and he would speak right there at that moment or that expression that would be given at that time and it would be God answering prayer you know what would be important it's not only for job to be yielded to God but how important it would be for that one that was in need be able to recognize when God was speaking to him you know friends one of the things that to me I Marvel many different times and we need God's grace in this CU sometimes sometimes it can be like throwing a life raft or throwing a lifes saer to somebody God's throwing throwing throwing throwing throwing and instead they just keep rejecting it no I don't want that I don't want that and yet and yet it's God reaching out listen don't look at vessels look at what God's speaking look at what God's given to you don't reject his help don't reject strength when it's coming to actually bring us from situations and and give us strength within our lives listen when I think of this this part right here of virtue I don't just look at this as a pastor I look at this as a husband I look at it as a father God did not Place me where he's placed me by accident but God helped me to be a channel that's available for virtue to travel through Let There Be virtue that would travel through to my brothers to my sisters whatever need there might be if it's something that arises in the home another brother another sister Lord let my life be that we're like them bees on that before where those bees can come and draw and can receive something from god let's stand let me read this last last part and him that had none to help him the blessing of him that was ready to perish Came Upon me and I caused the Widow's heart to sing for Joy job how did you do that well it wasn't me but it was God through me that's what that is that's a testimony of virtue flowing so when you think about this scripture that we've read here tonight how savest thou him that hath no strength well there's not one of us that has the ability to save someone else but there is a strength and there is a source that God has given us Grace to be tapped into and let me say friends if you're not tapped into it tonight there's no greater time to get tapped into it and it's to recognize Lord I need your strength I need your strength in my own life I need that strength of the word to be living in my life and just take the leadership that God has given right now through his word tonight brother bam talked about that Lily in that last little part he said that that Lily he said it must be drawing every minute of the day every minute of the day now what does that mean does that mean that every minute of the day you have to be on your knees does that mean that every minute of the day that you have to have a tape plan does that mean every minute of the day you have to be reading the word of God no but you give yourself to it and let me just say this whatever we give ourselves to it actually to create an atmosphere around our lives if you're not careful you get on too much of a string of YouTube videos it creates the atmosphere around your life there's things that all of a sudden it goes from watching this to this to this to this and all of a sudden it everything that we take in creates an atmosphere sometimes even just if you get into looking at the news very much and looking at this and this and I mean you're looking at this happen and this happened and you wonder sh can I go anywhere I mean is it safe to go to the mailbox sometimes the atmospheres it's by what we take in that's what's really important in our life is that atmosphere I say Lord let us be full of virtue but I don't want to be a I don't want to be a storage I want that virtue I want an inlet and an outlet and so every moment of the day when we're walking daily daily praying reading giving ourselves to the message things that even right here tonight after a service like this where God has planted courage in our hearts to take that word and water it with Thanksgiving with prayer let's pray Heavenly Father Lord Jesus that part Lord of yourself Lord that you desire that that life Lord would flow through our lives to others I than Lord just sometimes Lord we're so un we're we're unaware sometimes it's the things that are said sometimes Lord It's the expression I wonder when job said he caused the Widow's heart to be with joy you know the Bible tells us in the Book of James to visit the widows I wonder why it would say it like that Lord why would James why why would you allow that to be included Timothy Titus many of them is like James pastoral letters and to think Lord God that when someone would lose their companion their best [Music] friend one that they've walked with Lord for years through life and that one Lord has went ahead of them to the other side oh there's comfort in knowing where they're at they can pull from those memories that they have but there's times where they don't have someone to sit down with and have coffee with to sit down after maybe a time of an evening where where the convenience was there to sit right down maybe maybe she was sitting over on the chair or he was sitting on the chair she was on the couch whatever but they would have that Fellowship together Lord Jesus help us Lord help us to be sensitive Lord I'm asking you Lord for once again help us Lord not to get so caught up in our own little [Music] world help us Lord each Lord each of us press face pressures greater now than than it's been and it won't get any lesson any easier but Lord I believe the things that you're encouraging us is not only to pray for one another but to realize Lord Jesus of that virtue that you Lord God have placed in our lives and that we would be drawing from you surely Lord there's got to be an outlet there's got to be an outlet Lord father may we not be like a switch on the wall that has a short in it may we not be Lord God like an outlet on one of these walls that maybe Lord God some wire has been Jarred loose but I pray father may we lord be available [Music] and ready if I can say it this way welcoming reaching out Lord God lord Jesus I think as you stood there in John 6 I've always marveled at that [Music] scripture for Lord God As you stood there speaking to that woman at the well when the disciples returned back they had went to get as your Prophet called it viddles food to eat and when they came back they found what had taken place and they offered you meat to eat it wasn't that the natural man was not hungry but you spoke at that moment I have meat to eat of that you know not of and my meat is to do the will of my father Lord sometimes where the word is put in action in our lives it's not just us taking in taking in taking in that's all very important Lord we must give ourselves to you but father that other part of the will is to do the will of God help us [Music] Lord help us Lord to remember our purpose and our calling we don't have to try Lord in some way to save somebody whe they're going through the depth of trial or the hardness of trial but Lord sometimes it's just to be a good l Len sometimes it's just to be right there and say I'm praying for you Lord I look across this congregation tonight there's a number of brothers and sisters that normally they'd be sitting right here tonight Lord but father for whatever reason sickness maybe some discouragement I don't know but father I'm asking Lord God that not Not only would you touch them but may you touch them through our lives Lord whether it's text card call whatever it might be Lord as your body May the virtue of almighty God may we lord God give the right away may we draw from that virtue Lord may we draw from you that's that's the only thing that we can give to anybody Lord that would be of any value help us Lord I pray may we not neglect our responsibility our post of Duty Lord but help us Lord as Sons and Daughters of God help us Lord help us to receive Lord from [Music] you help us Lord I pray help us Lord to be able to receive from one another Lord God like your Prophet would talk about if there was certain amount of money that was offered he said you wouldn't pay no attention to the man that was given it you would simply look at what he had to offer and he would tell us don't look at the man standing in the pull pit he would speak of himself but look look to him who I'm trying to point you to Lord God grant it Lord may your presence just sweep right down lord as your word has been planted Lord God in our hearts a courage Lord I trust tonight a courage Lord in our lives Grant it Lord I pray may you minister to every need Lord in Jesus precious name amen go ahead brother Brian go ahead [Music] is a river oh and R from Deep R from deep within [Music] is a fountain that free the soul from [Music] s come to
