[30:09] oh he says when I was sick laying dying
[30:12] he was my friend
[30:14] when I'm feeling good tonight and happy
[30:16] you're still my friend when I'm laying
[30:18] Yonder dying somewhere and my chilly
[30:20] veins come up my arms like that he will
[30:22] be my friend then
[30:24] and when these brittle threads that I'm
[30:26] walking on breaks and I plunge out into
[30:28] eternity he will be my friend then when
[30:31] the Angels ages rolls on after ten
[30:34] thousand years and you've sung your
[30:36] Jubilee songs he will still be my friend
[30:38] then
[30:39] yes sir when there's no more moon no
[30:42] more sun no more Earth he will still be
[30:44] my friend then as the ages roll on oh
[30:47] how we ought to love him
[30:49] what a friend we have in Jesus
[30:54] you talking about one who sticks with us
[30:57] through thick and thin
[30:59] oh I'll tell you what he's a friend that
[31:01] sticker closer than a brother
[31:03] you know when you look at that scripture
[31:05] in the in the word of God in the Book of
[31:07] Proverbs if the Bible would say he that
[31:08] showeth himself friendly hath many
[31:10] friends and if you really get to looking
[31:12] at the context of that scripture that
[31:14] scripture is speaking of the Proverbs he
[31:15] that really compromises in order to gain
[31:18] others
[31:20] that's what it's really saying but then
[31:22] that's where this scripture comes in
[31:23] there is a friend that sticketh closer
[31:26] than a brother in other words there's a
[31:28] friend that you don't have to compromise
[31:29] on nothing
[31:31] man just be yourself just submit
[31:33] yourself to him there's one that'll
[31:34] stick with you through thick and thin
[31:37] amen aren't you glad for that
[31:39] no friend like the lonely Jesus
[31:42] no not one no not one amen don't you
[31:45] love him
[31:46] amen oh my it's so good to serve the
[31:49] Lord amen let's look in the word of God

[31:59] way I I believe he's here amen just to

[32:19] like blind Bartimaeus Lord I know you're
[32:22] passing this way
[32:24] it might seem like that yeah it doesn't
[32:26] seem like he's turning my way but if we
[32:28] just call out to him
[32:29] Jesus
[32:31] we don't know him the son of David we
[32:33] know him as the son of man
[32:34] the same Living God May flesh have mercy
[32:37] on me
[32:39] and then when the enemy could say I
[32:41] don't make no difference he doesn't hear
[32:43] and blind Bartimaeus cried out the more
[32:46] the louder

[34:52] Lord tonight we love you and we thank
[34:55] you Father in the name of Jesus Christ
[34:57] amen
[35:00] Amen in Job chapter 21 verse 1 I'll just
[35:03] read a few verses of scripture and we'll
[35:05] let you be seated
[35:06] but job answered and said
[35:10] hear diligently my speech and let this
[35:13] be your consolations or your comforts
[35:17] suffer me that I may speak and after
[35:20] that I'm I have spoken mock on
[35:23] as for me is my complaint to man and if
[35:27] it were so why should not my spirit be
[35:31] troubled
[35:32] Mark me and be astonished and lay your
[35:36] hand upon your mouth
[35:37] even when I remember
[35:40] I am afraid and trembling takes hold on
[35:44] my flesh
[35:45] amen may God bless you and bless the
[35:47] reading of the word as you're being
[35:48] seated
[35:52] you know when we
[35:55] look at this in the scripture
[35:59] job being a
[36:01] prophet of God and remember when God
[36:04] speaks about job
[36:06] he doesn't
[36:07] when he is
[36:09] testifying concerning that life that's
[36:12] on display in job
[36:14] he never
[36:16] speaks of he's my prophet but he says
[36:19] he's a perfect and an upright man
[36:22] he was a prophet indeed
[36:24] but that was a channel that God would
[36:27] work through but what God was bragging
[36:30] upon he's a perfect and upright man now
[36:34] wasn't job's flesh
[36:35] but it was that part of God's own life
[36:38] that part that was within job that had
[36:41] been displayed all through times that's
[36:45] what God had confidence in the Bible
[36:48] says when we think of this heavens and
[36:51] earth will pass away but my word shall
[36:53] never pass away
[36:55] God knows like it says in the Book of
[36:57] Psalms that we are he is mindful that we
[37:00] are but flesh
[37:01] he also knows as it says in the First
[37:03] Corinthians chapter 10 that God is
[37:06] faithful I love how that verse starts
[37:08] God is faithful that he will not suffer
[37:11] us to be tempted above what we are able
[37:15] to be tempted I'm sure with every one of
[37:18] us we would have tried to and we've
[37:21] tried to sign out we've looked for exit
[37:23] doors and everything but see God knows
[37:26] what you and I not only are able to
[37:29] endure but God is also permitting all
[37:33] those things to work out lez Paul would
[37:35] Express later in that same chapter an
[37:39] eternal weight and a molding of our
[37:41] character it's things that many times
[37:43] that we are is beyond our mind and our
[37:46] understanding but yet we unders we look
[37:49] at it and know that God what God has
[37:51] confidence in is that substance of his
[37:54] own life and his self because our flesh
[37:57] still declares its flesh
[38:00] in the midst of a trial there's times We
[38:03] complain
[38:05] there's times we wonder right there's
[38:07] times we get down
[38:09] our flesh what does it do it still
[38:11] declares that this flesh is not the
[38:13] glorified body
[38:15] amen so with and we we don't look at
[38:18] that to make an excuse but we realize
[38:20] that what God has confidence in is that
[38:22] part of himself on the inside and job
[38:25] job what he's expressing here we know
[38:29] that there's been answers that's been
[38:30] given throughout all of the tests and
[38:33] all the trials that have been uh that or
[38:36] the tests and trials that's come but
[38:37] what job has witnessed all through his
[38:40] life he has an understanding from God
[38:41] and he's also witnessed that the wicked
[38:45] man can actually appear to be blessed
[38:48] and as far as temporal goods and
[38:51] material things of this life in many
[38:54] cases can supersede and it looks to be
[38:57] they're very blessed within those things
[39:00] and though when we look at that we we
[39:03] think about how the Lord Jesus here when
[39:06] God himself would come down in
[39:09] Redemption and create their his own
[39:13] Tabernacle to come and dwell in he never
[39:16] came
[39:17] into the rich palaces or the richness of
[39:21] this Earth but as a matter of fact he
[39:24] did not even have a house to call his
[39:27] own
[39:28] he didn't even have a pillow to lay his
[39:31] head on
[39:33] but he he who was rich became poor
[39:37] and God came even when we look at within
[39:41] that manner and it would be expressed to
[39:43] you and I the admonition that we would
[39:46] see that though a person could take
[39:48] their life and they could use their life
[39:51] to gain the world but yet when they
[39:56] would take their own life and do that
[39:58] they actually lose it
[40:03] and this is why the Lord Jesus very
[40:05] sombering words he would say but who's
[40:07] willing to lose or surrender his life
[40:11] shall find it
[40:14] quite quite a contrast because from the
[40:17] beginning this world system not earth
[40:19] the system that is upon it the world the
[40:22] cosmos all that is born or comes forth
[40:26] from that of where of Temptation to be
[40:30] asked God to to know as God knows and to
[40:33] come into a place of bullying and moving
[40:37] where Pride becomes the basis of
[40:39] everything
[40:40] what a place of reflection and I want to
[40:43] just continue with that thought here
[40:45] tonight on job 21 in the midst of of the
[40:49] trial and to think about this thought
[40:51] once again what really matters
[40:54] I think that I think though that's a
[40:56] question that when everything that we do
[40:59] and everything we set our Our Lives to
[41:02] what really matters
[41:06] what is it that at the end of the day
[41:08] what really matters brother Branham
[41:11] takes an example here when he looks at
[41:13] and you'll hear him all through the
[41:15] message as he compares the poor couple
[41:18] that he married with the rich couple
[41:20] that he married
[41:22] right and he Compares those he Compares
[41:25] that and brother bran talks about when
[41:27] he went to where that poor couple was
[41:29] here they were he come up on the boxcar
[41:31] and how then it looked and everything it
[41:34] would not have been a place that where
[41:35] royalty or king would have felt welcome
[41:37] but when brother Brandon got next to it
[41:39] he heard the conversation he heard the
[41:43] care the love being expressed inside of
[41:47] that home and then he compared that to
[41:50] what he had heard up there on the Hill
[41:52] from the rich people and you know just
[41:55] uh I think it was maybe a year and a
[41:56] half ago two years ago we were
[41:58] privileged and I I guess I would say it
[42:00] put a visual to the context of what
[42:03] brother Branham described there when the
[42:04] brothers took us by in that way and
[42:06] would point out to who of of the rich
[42:08] people and what it was speaking of and
[42:10] and when you think of it they had
[42:12] everything gold-plated uh you know the
[42:15] the the works the Saints everything that
[42:17] could have been a claimed to that would
[42:20] have that would uh seemingly have
[42:23] appeased them and yet here they were in
[42:26] opposite corners of the house fighting
[42:28] with one another
[42:30] jealous of one another and brother
[42:32] Brandon says he asked himself the
[42:34] question Bill if you had to go to a home
[42:37] what home would you feel welcome in
[42:41] what home would you want to be in see
[42:44] it's it comes down to as brother Branham
[42:47] brings it he says it like this he says
[42:49] but if it's to me he says I'd say let me
[42:52] have a real true wife one that loves me
[42:54] let me live down here in a boxcar
[42:57] because I tell you happiness and
[42:59] contentment money cannot buy it money
[43:03] cannot buy love I mean we see money
[43:05] can't buy peace
[43:07] I mean we've seen that just look the
[43:09] world over money does not buy peace
[43:13] the Bible says as money cannot buy
[43:16] love or happiness and contentment it
[43:20] cannot buy that's the real things
[43:23] so the real things happen I'm thankful
[43:25] to God for that the real things
[43:28] what really matters what really matters
[43:31] think about that in everything that we
[43:33] we look at you see when we're looking at
[43:36] these these friends of job who came
[43:39] remember as we were looking at that last
[43:41] week their focus and their judgment
[43:43] everything that they were basing upon
[43:47] whether or not job was
[43:50] um was a was a righteous man or was in
[43:53] good standing with God everything had to
[43:55] deal with temporal things around him
[44:00] because you know what that was their
[44:03] experience
[44:05] their experience was based on just the
[44:08] temporal things
[44:10] but job when we read through job job's
[44:14] not not focused on the temporal things
[44:17] of Life what's job's the thing that job
[44:20] is Desiring his I'm used to having
[44:24] communion with him I'm used to talking
[44:27] with him there's a channel that he'll
[44:29] speak to me I need to talk to him job
[44:32] was focused then as job had always been
[44:36] on fellowship with God
[44:39] that's what job was focused on they were
[44:42] looking at the temporal job looked at it
[44:44] and said that's not what I'm focused on
[44:46] I'm focused on the fellowship that I
[44:49] have with him
[44:50] that's where I'm troubled
[44:53] this is why job could say in verse 7
[44:55] wherefore
[44:57] do the wicked live and become old yea
[45:00] and are Mighty in power now this is
[45:02] contrasting remember what has been just
[45:04] said in the previous chapter and I we we
[45:06] came we came up to a certain point here
[45:08] last week
[45:10] and it's contrasting because what has
[45:12] been said in the previous chapter and
[45:14] what has been mentioned just in bits and
[45:17] pieces throughout is that will the
[45:18] wicked is cut off and and they who you
[45:21] know they they go against God or they've
[45:23] sinned it's just wiped right out and job
[45:25] has stood over and over but now in a
[45:28] whole chapter he stands there and
[45:31] totally he's dismantling the arguments
[45:34] that are there by what not by what he
[45:36] said not just by his understanding but
[45:39] he's pointing things out to him I can't
[45:41] help but Wonder in the beginning of this
[45:43] chapter I can't help but wonder when job
[45:45] said let this be your consolations you
[45:47] know Brother Carlos I wonder if he's
[45:49] going to let him know when I'm getting
[45:50] ready to say might shake you in your
[45:52] boots but don't worry don't get all you
[45:54] know you're focused on your temporal
[45:55] Goods but don't say oh my goodness these
[45:57] temporal Goods could be taken oh no but
[45:59] then let me just comfort you because
[46:01] comfort those things can go on and on
[46:03] and on and on and on and on and on
[46:06] but I'll tell you
[46:09] job goes on to mention and in this way
[46:12] their seed is established in their sight
[46:15] with them in their offspring before
[46:17] their eyes
[46:18] their houses are safe from Fear
[46:22] neither is the rod of God
[46:26] upon them
[46:28] now what a contrast notice verse 10.
[46:31] their Bull gendereth and faileth not
[46:34] their cow catheth and casteth not her
[46:37] calf now remember all these things
[46:39] that's going through job's lost all of
[46:41] it
[46:42] jobs lost these things
[46:44] but job's able to point it out that on
[46:46] the contrary what you're saying is oh
[46:48] everything's taken and their children
[46:50] are taking off job said no in the
[46:51] country with a wicked he said minute
[46:53] their seed continues to prosper and
[46:55] prosper and prosper and prosper going on
[46:57] being established established
[46:58] established and even their livestock's
[47:00] going on and on and on and on and on and
[47:02] on and on
[47:04] and they send forth their little ones
[47:05] like a flock and their children dance
[47:07] they take the timbrel and harp and
[47:10] rejoice at the sound of the organ
[47:12] and they spend their days
[47:15] in wealth and in a moment go down to the
[47:19] Grave
[47:20] I want you to look at this statement in
[47:23] job 14.
[47:25] therefore they say unto God now think
[47:28] about where they're spending spending
[47:29] their life in wealth
[47:31] let me just say this brother Bram said
[47:34] there's as many Penny ears as there is
[47:36] millionaires
[47:38] because a pennier is one who's wanting
[47:40] and wanting and wanting and wanting and
[47:42] get to chasing after Chasing After
[47:44] there's nothing wrong let me just bring
[47:46] the balance here there's nothing wrong
[47:48] with goals you'll find the scripture
[47:50] admonishing you should have goals when I
[47:53] sit down I've got three young men when I
[47:55] sit down with them there's things that
[47:56] we've talked open throughout the years
[47:58] and continue to revisit goals
[48:01] there ought to be goals and ambition
[48:05] right contract that's a real contrast to
[48:07] this age that's not something that I
[48:09] know is going to be just osmosis going
[48:11] to take place with them it's got It's
[48:13] it's a continual it's a reminder it's
[48:15] not a preaching to them but it's working
[48:18] with them that's part of that
[48:20] cultivating there's got to be goals
[48:22] there's got to be expectations
[48:24] things that you pray over and asking God
[48:26] for direction but let God lead you and
[48:31] never allow your goals to be above his
[48:33] will
[48:34] allow his will to be first and then
[48:37] allow that to affect and influence and
[48:40] direct alter change bring to pass
[48:43] everything concerning those goals
[48:45] because the Bible said acknowledge the
[48:47] Lord in all thy paths in all thy ways
[48:50] and he'll direct that path
[48:52] that's the promise right so the
[48:53] scripture in only the scripture is
[48:55] always in the
[48:57] admonishing to our lives and able to
[48:59] bring it down to where we as we walk
[49:02] within in this life but yet we
[49:05] understand as I said Remember the
[49:07] Brandon makes a statement about Penny
[49:08] ears it's talking about where brother
[49:11] Brahm says within it he said if money
[49:13] itself he says is not the thing that's
[49:15] bad it's our attitude towards it
[49:19] it's our attitude towards I mean the
[49:20] Bible says the Love of Money not money
[49:23] but the love of it is the root
[49:25] it's the root of all evil right it's
[49:28] always the chasing after the next best
[49:30] thing and everything the world itself is
[49:33] set up under that principle
[49:35] oh you got the newest model guess what
[49:38] there's another model coming out
[49:40] there's only you your key fob only has
[49:42] two buttons this has four buttons why is
[49:45] it everything everything of the world is
[49:49] to promote curiosity is also to promote
[49:53] lust
[49:56] come on I'm not just talking about man
[49:58] and woman I'm talking about things
[49:59] remember when we look at lust it's
[50:02] desires that are forbidden
[50:06] to where that we the Bible said that the
[50:08] world passeth away and the lust thereof
[50:13] I think if there's anything at all that
[50:15] we look at it and say Lord If It Be Your
[50:17] Will
[50:19] If It Be Your Will Lord
[50:21] If It Be Your Will
[50:24] so notice what they say in verse 14.
[50:27] therefore they say unto God
[50:31] depart from us
[50:33] for we desire not the knowledge of thy
[50:35] ways
[50:36] this is what the wicked says
[50:39] we don't want to know your ways we don't
[50:40] care about your ways
[50:43] we don't care about it now those things
[50:45] are said not just by words but also by
[50:49] their actions
[50:50] they don't care
[50:52] they don't care now notice verse 15 this
[50:55] is also this is what's coming from the
[50:57] wicked what is the almighty that we
[50:59] should serve him what profit should we
[51:02] have if we pray unto him
[51:12] not quite the contrary the wicked will
[51:15] say what good does it do to follow God
[51:17] what do I need to follow him I've got
[51:19] everything that I have need of
[51:22] I don't need him I don't need that I
[51:25] don't you know what this is just a
[51:26] little bit too tight
[51:29] you don't need you don't need all this
[51:31] to serve God you don't need all of this
[51:33] that's a little bit too straight that's
[51:36] the spirit that has been and is yet
[51:39] still I am rich and increased with goods
[51:43] and I have need of nothing
[51:47] I've got my understanding I don't need
[51:50] the Holy Ghost
[51:52] I know God I don't need all of this I
[51:56] don't need God doesn't care about this
[51:58] God doesn't care about this that's what
[52:01] the Declaration is they don't want to
[52:03] know his ways you know what his ways are
[52:06] it's his life it's his character and it
[52:09] is life
[52:11] Hallelujah but that's because what has
[52:14] been presented in this age is a loving
[52:18] Jesus in a figment of one's imagination
[52:21] and they've got a Jesus that's crafted
[52:24] and has been crafted by schools of
[52:27] theology it's a Jesus that does not
[52:30] require a change of Jesus that does not
[52:33] require lining up with the word
[52:37] well that ain't my Jesus
[52:40] because my Jesus is the word
[52:43] amen and everything the spirit of truth
[52:46] will line with every part of the word
[52:48] that's my Jesus
[52:50] my Jesus said Heaven and Earth will pass
[52:52] away but my word shall never fail
[52:56] what a contrast to this age because it's
[52:58] an age the spirit itself that is there
[53:01] that I don't have need of nothing
[53:05] where it can even as job is saying the
[53:07] wicked can look
[53:09] I you know I know of individuals said
[53:11] and talked with them and you hear you
[53:13] hear the things the way they talk
[53:14] they're stuck and look they've been I'm
[53:17] not even going to go into the specifics
[53:18] but there are things where they've been
[53:20] successful in life
[53:22] I mean really successful
[53:24] I've got Kinfolk
[53:26] been very successful in life
[53:29] been hyped and they're they're proud of
[53:32] that which working hard I'm proud of
[53:34] that too I think I think that's ought to
[53:36] be something that merited but when it
[53:37] all comes down to the end of the day
[53:39] where is your soul going to be with God
[53:42] because it don't matter how good you've
[53:44] been well I care for my children I've
[53:46] done that that's all good but when it
[53:47] comes down to the end of the day what
[53:50] about your soul every man has to give an
[53:53] account for his own soul
[53:55] you see what Paul you know what job's
[53:57] trying to do think of job in the midst
[53:59] of this trial accusations and this is
[54:02] God's mercy not only is it repelling
[54:05] those accusations but if these men can
[54:08] really take heed to it and say you know
[54:09] what I need to live a deeper life than a
[54:13] superficial relationship that's based on
[54:16] temporal things if they can really take
[54:18] it the right way
[54:21] but you know how it is number one our
[54:22] flesh don't like hearing rough things
[54:25] but thanks be to God there's got to be
[54:27] something deeper there that says it's
[54:29] tearing me up but keep bringing it down
[54:31] because what's tearing me up it's
[54:33] loosening me from what's trying to bind
[54:35] me keep bringing it keep cutting away
[54:37] because what is it doing it's not
[54:40] cutting away at Moses Michelangelo never
[54:44] cut away any part of Moses he only
[54:47] removed what wasn't Moses
[54:54] oh my
[54:56] this is why
[54:57] Lo their good is not in their hand
[55:00] and the counts of the wicked it's far
[55:03] from me
[55:04] Joe's letting them know in jobs let me
[55:06] know in verse 16 no I I don't understand
[55:07] why that is but that's that's how things
[55:10] are
[55:12] Joe node
[55:14] that he hadn't sinned
[55:18] how many you know I could ask for a
[55:21] raise of hands as you listen to the
[55:23] message how many times you hear that
[55:25] statement over and over I don't care
[55:26] what message you let's do job no he
[55:27] hadn't sinned
[55:29] but it becomes what it is if something
[55:31] becomes so real it was ground that job
[55:34] was standing on the devil couldn't move
[55:36] him
[55:38] he couldn't move no matter what
[55:39] accusations job knew I heard God's voice
[55:41] I've done everything that God has asked
[55:43] me to do what you are charging me of is
[55:46] not right
[55:48] he knew he hadn't sinned
[55:50] it's a stand he met God's requirement
[55:52] now brother Brown said now accidents and
[55:54] troubles
[55:55] that don't happen to people because
[55:57] they're sinners
[55:58] because I've seen Sinners prosper and go
[56:01] on
[56:02] it's on the basis of Fellowship because
[56:04] a man prospers in business that'll make
[56:07] him all together a Christian because
[56:09] there's many Sinners that prosper
[56:11] but what is it our fellowship is not
[56:14] upon the basis of how much God prospers
[56:16] us but on the basis of coming under the
[56:19] shed blood and fellowship with one
[56:22] another that's the real part of
[56:24] Christianity
[56:25] that's what makes these meetings he said
[56:27] so real and special is when people can
[56:29] come under the basis of the shed blood
[56:31] we have things in common and we set in
[56:34] Heavenly places
[56:35] you know the Bible says in Proverbs 28 6
[56:37] better is the poor that walketh in his
[56:41] uprightness
[56:43] then he that is perverse or wrong in his
[56:46] ways though he be rich
[56:49] you know a rich man might be able to buy
[56:51] himself out of a lot of things
[56:53] but he can't buy himself out of
[56:56] when that fog of death starts moving up
[56:59] he can't buy himself out of that no
[57:00] matter how much money he's got he cannot
[57:02] he can't buy himself into the kingdom of
[57:04] God
[57:05] well he's donated to the poor remember
[57:07] religion that's religion salvation is a
[57:11] birth
[57:12] no matter how many fruit baskets and how
[57:14] many things brother Brandon made it so
[57:15] clear that's religion
[57:18] salvation come to do with the real deal
[57:20] with the real root of the problem aren't
[57:22] you glad for that I'm glad for that we
[57:24] don't have to walk with a covering in
[57:26] our life but there can be a real
[57:27] transformation we can walk in confidence
[57:30] so notice the rich in Proverbs 20 and 11
[57:33] the rich is wise in his own conceit but
[57:37] the poor that half understanding
[57:38] searcheth him out
[57:40] aren't you grateful for a word it's a
[57:43] living word that searches us out
[57:45] amen we're not rich and this world's
[57:48] good but but we have we have a treasure
[57:50] that searches us out we have a treasure
[57:53] that is is it is real to us this is the
[57:57] riches of his glory Christ in US
[58:00] it convicts us it directs us it leads us
[58:04] it ministers up that's what real riches
[58:06] are the poor have an understanding that
[58:09] searches him out
[58:12] Proverbs 13 7 there is he that maketh
[58:15] himself rich
[58:17] yet half of nothing
[58:19] there is he that maketh himself poor yet
[58:22] hath great riches
[58:24] amen
[58:26] and I love this Matthew 5 3 blessed are
[58:30] the poor in spirit
[58:32] for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[58:35] that's what the whole the whole mystery
[58:38] of think when Jesus came among the
[58:40] Pharisees
[58:42] they were not poor in spirit
[58:45] they did not want to surrender or submit
[58:48] themselves to the word of God
[58:50] but they argued against it but here
[58:53] all through the track record
[58:55] where people
[58:57] whose lives would have been wrote off
[59:00] reject
[59:02] a mess
[59:04] unfixable
[59:05] unrepairable damaged goods
[59:09] Hallelujah
[59:10] but Jesus could look down beneath all of
[59:13] that it was he was coming to redeem what
[59:16] lay down beneath air
[59:19] into his presence what everybody else
[59:21] had said rejected damaged goods Beyond
[59:24] repair Jesus could come right down to
[59:26] that and he'll raise up a life that is a
[59:29] trophy of his grace
[59:31] Hallelujah
[59:33] that's what real riches does in our life
[59:36] blessed are the poor in spirit for
[59:39] theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[59:41] think of Dwight Moody walking there on
[59:44] the sidewalk and here came a man it was
[59:46] a you know one to be a smart alec about
[59:48] the white Moody you know Dwight Moody
[59:50] couldn't talk right he stuttered and
[59:51] everything else and even how they made
[59:53] fun of him coming and writing in the
[59:55] meetings and saying I don't see who in
[59:57] the world would go to see him he can't
[59:58] even talk right and everything else and
[1:00:00] the white mood he looked at it God help
[1:00:03] us to be that way he looked at it and
[1:00:05] laughed he said of course not they come
[1:00:08] to see Jesus
[1:00:11] God help us because we might get on
[1:00:12] Facebook and start blasting them
[1:00:16] but they didn't come to see the one
[1:00:18] Moody they came to see Jesus and
[1:00:20] remember a smart alec coming down the
[1:00:22] road the rolling you know and Dwight
[1:00:24] Moody's walking they're walking like
[1:00:25] this and the man the mind when he said
[1:00:27] excuse me he says I don't move for a
[1:00:29] fool the white Moody tipped this out and
[1:00:31] said I always do excuse me and he walked
[1:00:33] home
[1:00:33] [Applause]
[1:00:37] what is it the porn spirit is that which
[1:00:39] is humble to the word humble ourselves
[1:00:42] in his presence that's real riches
[1:00:45] because prosperity it's not always the
[1:00:48] sign that God is with us it's many times
[1:00:51] that's deceiving because the Bible said
[1:00:52] the rain will fall on the just and the
[1:00:54] unjust Brethren would talk into the
[1:00:56] Christian businessman and you you hear
[1:00:58] this on various accounts and different
[1:00:59] messages and they got up they were on an
[1:01:02] island and you know brother Brandon was
[1:01:04] there at the meeting you know brother
[1:01:06] Brandon was there and and they got up
[1:01:08] and these businessmen they started you
[1:01:10] know testifying in the things that they
[1:01:12] were saying is I started off I had a
[1:01:14] little little itty-bitty place down
[1:01:16] there but I tell you it was it was my
[1:01:18] business nothing was good I had a
[1:01:20] horrible time but the first thing you
[1:01:22] know I received Christ and I got
[1:01:25] everything now
[1:01:28] another banham looked at that he waited
[1:01:30] till they got back to the hotel
[1:01:32] and he brought some correction
[1:01:35] because Prosperity don't mean Christ
[1:01:39] he told them he said you're trying to
[1:01:41] compare with wealthy men that's got more
[1:01:44] than you
[1:01:45] and you're going to tell them come to
[1:01:47] Christ you can have more that's not why
[1:01:50] you serve Jesus Christ
[1:01:52] it's not because I can have more of this
[1:01:54] Earth I don't want more of this Earth
[1:01:56] because this Earth has only brought me
[1:01:58] sorrow I want more of Jesus
[1:02:02] that's what I want I want more of him
[1:02:07] not more of this because you know how it
[1:02:09] is the more you have the more you got to
[1:02:11] worry about the more you got to take
[1:02:12] care of
[1:02:17] right
[1:02:19] sometimes that's why maybe we wonder and
[1:02:21] say maybe a tent would be best
[1:02:25] right I mean we find out as you get you
[1:02:27] know you get into a home you you think
[1:02:28] about a home and then you realize you're
[1:02:30] going to do homeless repairs
[1:02:32] it's part of life right
[1:02:34] true got that repair done good you're
[1:02:36] just in time for another one
[1:02:39] that's how it is
[1:02:40] right so when we look at this the uh of
[1:02:44] the prospering that's why over and over
[1:02:46] brother Brown would point out Prosperity
[1:02:48] is no sign of spiritual blessing people
[1:02:51] think a lot of times Prosperity God is
[1:02:53] smelling it's smiling down on us oh and
[1:02:55] we got you know bigger churches and
[1:02:56] God's not against a bigger building
[1:02:58] that's not what brother Brown was
[1:02:59] talking about he said God it ain't
[1:03:01] against those things but it's what
[1:03:02] they're putting stock in
[1:03:05] it's when things are put stuck in well I
[1:03:07] gotta you know I got a big house or I
[1:03:09] got a I got a this car I got this and
[1:03:11] boy I know God really loves me that's
[1:03:14] not how we judge Our Lives
[1:03:17] because remember the king of glory had
[1:03:19] no house had no place to lay his head he
[1:03:23] was an outcast despised and rejected he
[1:03:26] was not in the who's who he was not
[1:03:29] welcome in their clubs he was despised
[1:03:31] even when Simon invited him into his
[1:03:34] house Simon didn't even wash his feet
[1:03:36] didn't even anoint him with oil but set
[1:03:39] him down in the corner
[1:03:41] [Applause]
[1:03:43] he was poor but he became poor
[1:03:48] but I might become rich in him
[1:03:52] in his life
[1:03:54] or repeated God in the highest thank you
[1:03:57] Jesus Oh My think of how that even when
[1:04:01] that pressure came because you know when
[1:04:04] we look at that of prosperity and they
[1:04:06] were trying to even Prosper you know
[1:04:08] press on Micah that whole thing you know
[1:04:10] in the days that they have well they
[1:04:12] weren't having Wars and this and man
[1:04:14] everything seemed to be good and boy
[1:04:16] God's just smiling on us everything's
[1:04:18] real good but they weren't judging
[1:04:20] Nothing by the word
[1:04:22] let me tell you that's the danger
[1:04:25] because our life as a Believer I want to
[1:04:28] know where I stand with God
[1:04:31] heaven was going to come to hear the
[1:04:32] word of God it's not that I have a
[1:04:34] question but I want to know I want to be
[1:04:36] closer to him
[1:04:38] I'm depending on that Living Word that
[1:04:41] flaming sword I'm depending on the word
[1:04:43] to reveal and to direct to lead
[1:04:46] questions of God I'm depending on God to
[1:04:49] answer those questions I'm depending on
[1:04:51] leadership that I need in my life I want
[1:04:54] to know what does he say about it I need
[1:04:57] that that to me is worth more than
[1:05:00] anything else
[1:05:02] and my canoe my canoe said real
[1:05:05] Prosperity is if you believe His
[1:05:07] prophets
[1:05:07] you'll prosper
[1:05:09] Micah knew that I'm going to stay with
[1:05:12] what Elijah said
[1:05:14] and that's why brother random going on
[1:05:15] he would speak of how people think maybe
[1:05:18] you have to own a lot of worldly goods
[1:05:20] and that'll show that God is blessing
[1:05:22] you that ain't true sometimes it's the
[1:05:24] other way
[1:05:25] the man brings it on down about the
[1:05:28] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:30] because as it comes down even to that
[1:05:32] we're looking at the baptism of the Holy
[1:05:35] Ghost and one clear identity it over and
[1:05:37] over in the scripture is when the spirit
[1:05:39] in US identifies every word of God to be
[1:05:44] the truth
[1:05:45] if the spirit that we have comes out
[1:05:48] against the word of God and says that
[1:05:50] ain't necessary that ain't needful it's
[1:05:53] not the true baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:56] because the true baptism of the Holy
[1:05:58] Ghost brings forth a son or daughter of
[1:06:02] God that lives under the headship of
[1:06:05] Jesus Christ the word and is united with
[1:06:08] him as a husband and wife are one these
[1:06:11] are no longer Twain They Are One
[1:06:16] Hallelujah and that's why when we look
[1:06:19] at it look at Balaam Balaam was tested
[1:06:22] remember bear Balaam first went when
[1:06:25] they came to him he said let me go talk
[1:06:26] to God about this I'm gonna go talk to
[1:06:28] the Lord the Lord told him don't go with
[1:06:31] these men
[1:06:32] and these people they're wanting you to
[1:06:33] come against they're blessed don't you
[1:06:35] touch them
[1:06:37] so
[1:06:38] Bala went out and told him
[1:06:40] then you know here they come again well
[1:06:43] houses land gold and everything else
[1:06:46] and Balaam said oh that would be given
[1:06:49] to me yet I will not
[1:06:51] go
[1:06:53] and you know in Disobedience to the word
[1:06:55] of God that sounds good if it is stopped
[1:06:57] right there but Balaam because the
[1:07:00] desire in his heart
[1:07:02] that's why we always got to make sure
[1:07:04] what the desires of our heart are
[1:07:06] because whatever the desire is he can
[1:07:08] lay there for years but if it never gets
[1:07:10] taken care of it'll come out
[1:07:13] are you hearing me this is why we always
[1:07:15] want the desires of our heart to be
[1:07:17] remedied God let every desire be lined
[1:07:20] up with you Lord
[1:07:22] Balaam went and asked God lord what
[1:07:24] would you say God don't change his mind
[1:07:27] God don't change his mind
[1:07:29] God didn't say you know what I think
[1:07:31] something's changed different now you
[1:07:32] know I feel a little different about
[1:07:33] that now God went ahead and told him go
[1:07:36] ahead and go
[1:07:37] now after God told him that you can read
[1:07:39] in the scripture after God told him that
[1:07:41] you could ask baalem hey what did God
[1:07:43] say God told me to go ahead and go the
[1:07:44] very next scripture God sees Balaam God
[1:07:47] and the Bible said God was angered that
[1:07:50] he went
[1:07:52] why he should have known what God has
[1:07:55] said first he means and he won't change
[1:07:58] it oh what a blessing that is isn't it
[1:08:00] if God ever healed anybody he still
[1:08:03] healed people if God ever delivered he
[1:08:05] still delivers if God ever filled with
[1:08:07] the Holy Ghost he still feels with the
[1:08:09] Holy Ghost
[1:08:10] that don't change no matter time no
[1:08:12] matter what happens he's still the same
[1:08:14] God
[1:08:15] amen he prospered notice how Balaam
[1:08:18] prospered but remember this is why
[1:08:21] brother Brandon would draw our attention
[1:08:22] to it you can't judge God by Prosperity
[1:08:25] because the world prospered
[1:08:29] and Balaam was blessed
[1:08:35] argue against Balaam Balaam you're out
[1:08:38] of the will of God no way I'm blessed
[1:08:43] what God told you in his word not to go
[1:08:46] yeah but look God turned around and told
[1:08:49] me to go well this is like when brother
[1:08:51] Branham had the woman preacher on the
[1:08:52] prayer line
[1:08:53] and you know the prayer that when the
[1:08:55] woman preacher said well brother Brian
[1:08:56] you know she said God called her to
[1:08:58] preach brother Brown says I don't doubt
[1:09:00] that he did
[1:09:02] that's a good one isn't it
[1:09:05] right after he preaches rising of the
[1:09:06] Sun
[1:09:07] he said what it is he says God don't
[1:09:09] change his mind about his word
[1:09:12] because he won't take what God Said in
[1:09:14] his word and to keep going after it and
[1:09:16] finally God says go ahead and do what's
[1:09:17] in your heart because you're going to do
[1:09:19] it anyhow right
[1:09:20] right oh I want my heart cleared out
[1:09:22] I want my heart cleared out I want my
[1:09:25] heart to match his word if there's
[1:09:28] something in my heart that's not lined
[1:09:30] up Lord I'm looking to you that my heart
[1:09:33] would be lined up with your work I don't
[1:09:35] want your work to match my experience I
[1:09:38] want my experience to match your word
[1:09:42] so that I have a real word experience
[1:09:45] oh glory be to God think of it how the
[1:09:48] scripture let me just in speaking of
[1:09:50] this of of being prosperous remember how
[1:09:52] the scripture says in third John chapter
[1:09:54] 1 verse two very familiar scripture to
[1:09:56] us beloved I wish above all things that
[1:09:58] thou mayest prosper and be in health
[1:10:01] even as thy soul prospereth
[1:10:06] now no doubt many of you have seen this
[1:10:08] and it's been passed along it's it's
[1:10:09] generally every year it's a quote that I
[1:10:12] get from some way or another from from
[1:10:14] ministers overseas Brethren and so forth
[1:10:16] here we all and this is what brother
[1:10:18] Brown says at the end of Revelation
[1:10:20] chapter four it's still good no matter
[1:10:22] how many times you read it he says I
[1:10:25] wish each of you the most successful and
[1:10:27] blessful and healthy New Year that I can
[1:10:28] wish to you God be with you may you grow
[1:10:31] both physically and spiritually and
[1:10:34] financially and materially everything
[1:10:36] that God can bring upon you I pray that
[1:10:39] he'll do it
[1:10:40] but I don't know about you but there's
[1:10:42] one that stands out in there more to me
[1:10:43] than all the rest of them
[1:10:45] one that I'm interested in
[1:10:48] spiritually
[1:10:50] that's what I'm interested in
[1:10:52] because he promised he'd provide for all
[1:10:54] my needs
[1:10:55] any Witnesses has he done that
[1:10:58] he promised he would do that I he told
[1:11:00] me I don't even have to worry about that
[1:11:01] that's what he told Israel when they
[1:11:03] were going in the land you don't even
[1:11:04] have to be occupied with that and Jesus
[1:11:07] telling the New Testament Church that
[1:11:10] was going to enter into the land of the
[1:11:12] Holy Ghost he told him the same thing
[1:11:13] take no
[1:11:16] for tomorrow
[1:11:18] sufficient is the evil thereof don't get
[1:11:20] all worried about the clothing this and
[1:11:23] that and this and that he want telling
[1:11:24] them not to plan but he was sad don't
[1:11:26] make that your focus
[1:11:29] I'm your focus I'm your all in all I've
[1:11:32] got everything covered I'm the same God
[1:11:35] who didn't allow their sandals to wear
[1:11:38] out for 40 years I didn't allow their
[1:11:40] their clothes to become threadbare I'm
[1:11:43] the same God
[1:11:47] this is where it comes down to the
[1:11:49] spiritual mind something rises in the
[1:11:51] spirit within our lives
[1:11:53] you can always see the the contrast you
[1:11:55] know
[1:11:57] Jacob he saw Abel came Jesus Judas you
[1:11:59] don't see the contrast
[1:12:01] I believe with all my heart that the
[1:12:03] prosperity when we look at the scripture
[1:12:05] and you take that
[1:12:07] there were even Kings that's mentioned
[1:12:09] in the days
[1:12:11] of Israel
[1:12:13] that when Zechariah was prophesying
[1:12:15] amazing I don't know if I'm pronouncing
[1:12:18] it correctly but
[1:12:20] the Bible said God spoke to him
[1:12:24] he prospered
[1:12:26] as long as he obeyed the word of God
[1:12:29] you know God told Israel when you come
[1:12:31] into the land you'll prosper
[1:12:33] long as you walk in my word
[1:12:36] that's still a condition we might look
[1:12:38] and say we're under an unconditional
[1:12:39] Covenant but what if God allowed you and
[1:12:42] I just to keep going our own way
[1:12:45] something's wrong
[1:12:47] something's wrong because the Bible said
[1:12:48] if we don't judge ourselves he judges us
[1:12:51] God God will move in our life and what
[1:12:53] is he doing God will say hey come on now
[1:12:55] I dealt with you on these things and
[1:12:57] you're just kind of passing them by
[1:12:58] passing them bypass but I mean it I'm
[1:13:00] not going to lose a one I want you to
[1:13:03] take notice of these things
[1:13:05] because God's desire is to work and move
[1:13:09] and live and flow through our lives
[1:13:12] we're a branch so I believe within my
[1:13:15] all my heart but I believe in prosperity
[1:13:17] but I believe as a believer in my heart
[1:13:19] this is where I'm set on is spiritual
[1:13:22] prosperity
[1:13:24] amen I want to see an advancement of the
[1:13:26] kingdom of God that's I look at it even
[1:13:28] in this year how fitting God places in
[1:13:30] my heart at this time that's what I want
[1:13:32] to see I want to see an advancement of
[1:13:33] his kingdom of his body of his life in
[1:13:36] me in you that's what I want to see
[1:13:39] that's the desire is to see him on
[1:13:43] display
[1:13:44] because everything else it'll take care
[1:13:46] of it and God knows what we can handle
[1:13:47] God knows what we need we don't even
[1:13:49] have to fret about it
[1:13:52] oh my there's just a Hunger for More of
[1:13:54] him because when Eliezer could just heed
[1:13:57] to the words of Abraham the Bible said
[1:13:59] God made his way to prosper and what was
[1:14:02] it what he was looking for he found
[1:14:04] he was under the leading of the Lord
[1:14:06] Joshua tells us under the leadership of
[1:14:08] the Holy Spirit God told Joshua he said
[1:14:10] if you will heed to my word not deviate
[1:14:12] from the left or right and meditate on
[1:14:14] it day and night make in other words
[1:14:16] make the word the center of every
[1:14:18] decision of every part of your life and
[1:14:21] then Thou shalt make thy way of a good
[1:14:23] success and prosperous
[1:14:27] right
[1:14:28] because to a real believer brother
[1:14:30] ramble picked us up you know a lot of
[1:14:32] times even as those that have been
[1:14:35] around for a while and you're reading in
[1:14:36] the message you you know brother Brown
[1:14:38] was it makes a sign that he pulling this
[1:14:40] from the scripture very clearly the
[1:14:41] Cloudy Skies
[1:14:43] and storms of life are no signs of God's
[1:14:45] disapproval
[1:14:47] I don't know how many times I've come
[1:14:48] back to that quote
[1:14:52] I don't know brother Chris and I ain't
[1:14:54] the only ones I don't know how many
[1:14:55] times I've come back to that quote
[1:14:57] and in instruments that I've got it on
[1:14:59] my refrigerator it'd be a good one to
[1:15:00] put on my refrigerator though
[1:15:03] it'd be a good one to put on my mirror
[1:15:04] of a morning it'd be a good one putting
[1:15:05] next to my nightstand but it's been
[1:15:07] times when the Holy Spirit will bring in
[1:15:09] into tremendous we can get going in a
[1:15:10] certain pathway and the Holy Spirit will
[1:15:12] just drop right down and bring a quote
[1:15:14] right back to our attention a word right
[1:15:15] back and you know what it does it
[1:15:17] encourages us it strengthens us say wait
[1:15:19] a minute you know we're facing we're
[1:15:21] facing accusations like Joe faced
[1:15:25] but God has not left us alone
[1:15:29] amen I don't know how everything's going
[1:15:31] to come back but I've got a word from
[1:15:32] the Lord amen God would make it known
[1:15:35] that brights lies bright Skies Still
[1:15:37] Waters are no signs of his love and
[1:15:39] approval amen we know what those signs
[1:15:42] are because
[1:15:43] what he said what he's manifested how
[1:15:46] he's brought us to himself how he's gave
[1:15:48] us of his spirit and he's placed Us in
[1:15:51] his body
[1:15:53] amen so it's not something that we're
[1:15:55] just floating around on we know in whom
[1:15:57] we have believed we know he's working in
[1:16:00] our life we know what he's done so far I
[1:16:02] can stand on it
[1:16:04] because he's done it I hadn't done it
[1:16:05] he's done it
[1:16:06] and that's why that you know brother
[1:16:08] Brandon would pick that up over because
[1:16:10] it's the scripture seeing harvesting
[1:16:12] these things back that have laid in the
[1:16:14] scriptures that the people of God are
[1:16:16] not Material minded
[1:16:18] they're christ-minded
[1:16:25] you know sometimes there's things that
[1:16:27] we can look at in the word of God and we
[1:16:29] can see it and we can look we need God
[1:16:32] to come down and
[1:16:33] amplify it and just apply it to our
[1:16:35] lives
[1:16:36] because there's a lot of times in the
[1:16:38] word of God we can look at things and
[1:16:39] think well I ain't material minded I am
[1:16:42] christ-minded I I'm not Material but
[1:16:45] it's what what we are refocusing on
[1:16:47] what do we put our Ambitions on
[1:16:50] come on now you know there's things that
[1:16:53] we can get and it's like look I've got
[1:16:54] three boys right here I can become so
[1:16:56] wrapped up in them there's a
[1:16:57] responsibility I have and their mother
[1:16:59] has we've got to raise them the Bible
[1:17:01] didn't say raise them it said train them
[1:17:03] in other words you be an example and let
[1:17:05] them follow your example
[1:17:07] don't tell them what to do you lead the
[1:17:09] way and let them follow your leading
[1:17:11] train up a child in the way it should go
[1:17:14] right
[1:17:15] but but don't become material minded in
[1:17:20] the way that you direct them
[1:17:22] well what Lord what are you saying don't
[1:17:24] Focus their goals on Earthly temporal
[1:17:28] Ambitions let them know that the
[1:17:31] beginning of wisdom is to serve the Lord
[1:17:35] let them know that let them be that
[1:17:37] testimony
[1:17:39] somebody help me preach now
[1:17:42] see sometimes material minded we could
[1:17:43] think well I don't know you know brother
[1:17:45] Samuel dimes don't matter nothing to me
[1:17:47] at all but what are we focusing on
[1:17:50] sometimes that isn't dimes we're
[1:17:51] focusing on it's other material ways and
[1:17:54] let me tell you something I proved him I
[1:17:57] know he's a provider
[1:17:59] but the same how are we going to get
[1:18:00] here how they're going to get this I
[1:18:02] tell you what you put God first and
[1:18:03] expect the miraculous
[1:18:05] you put God first and wait and in fact
[1:18:08] the phenomenal to show up what are you
[1:18:09] doing I'll tell you what I'm doing I'm
[1:18:11] preparing for a miracle
[1:18:15] glory be to God just put your life in
[1:18:18] his hands and prepare for a miracle
[1:18:20] prepare for God to show up he is a
[1:18:23] Waymaker when you have a need he'll make
[1:18:25] a way
[1:18:27] don't just confine him to Healing your
[1:18:29] body and saving your soul but say Lord
[1:18:31] be God of everything of my life Lord
[1:18:36] let him show up in every experience
[1:18:42] Hallelujah
[1:18:44] amen we're not Material minded brother
[1:18:46] Brandon would put it that way we don't
[1:18:48] seek the treasures no we don't seek this
[1:18:49] is below we seek those that are above
[1:18:51] it's not Material it's within us that's
[1:18:54] what the kingdom of God is a rich man is
[1:18:57] rich in God not in worldly things
[1:19:01] remember in the Book of James I'm coming
[1:19:03] down
[1:19:04] remember in the book of James
[1:19:07] where it's roped
[1:19:08] they were buttering people they were the
[1:19:10] in the church in the church
[1:19:13] they had rich people coming in
[1:19:15] and they looked at the rich person said
[1:19:17] I eat something right here
[1:19:20] poor
[1:19:21] you don't got the name brands
[1:19:24] driving driving on beater you said you
[1:19:26] you stand back there
[1:19:29] you saw that one scripture that is a
[1:19:30] scripture
[1:19:32] it's you know what it shows there is a
[1:19:34] part about our flesh of sometimes what
[1:19:37] we value as real success
[1:19:41] and the things that we call success God
[1:19:44] calls foolishness
[1:19:47] is that right the Rich Young Ruler was a
[1:19:51] successful young man
[1:19:53] but it was foolish that he turned down
[1:19:55] the person of eternal life
[1:19:58] when God got to dealing with things that
[1:20:01] were in his life what was he dealing
[1:20:03] with what was holding him back
[1:20:06] brother tells us he takes us Jesus loved
[1:20:08] him he said no doubt this man this young
[1:20:11] man must have had an incredible
[1:20:12] conscience must have had an incredible
[1:20:14] character he goes through that in
[1:20:15] various parts of the message but what
[1:20:17] was it when the word began to deal in
[1:20:20] his life and what was it dealing with
[1:20:22] what's hindering you from a full
[1:20:25] surrender
[1:20:27] he turned around
[1:20:28] and the Bible said he walked away
[1:20:31] sorrowful
[1:20:33] because he had
[1:20:35] great
[1:20:36] possessions
[1:20:44] when his thinking was I got to give that
[1:20:46] up I got to let this go
[1:20:49] what what am I going to do what am I
[1:20:51] we're talking about
[1:20:53] the person of eternal life
[1:20:55] he who is life
[1:20:57] don't forget this Rich Young Ruler also
[1:21:00] knew this scripture it is God that
[1:21:01] giveth the power to give wealth
[1:21:04] that's Bible
[1:21:07] [Music]
[1:21:09] he knew the Commandments and even after
[1:21:12] his meeting with God
[1:21:14] I took a prophetic eye to tie this
[1:21:16] together
[1:21:17] that it's the same rich young man that
[1:21:19] Jesus speaks of in Luke 21.
[1:21:21] that after his encounter
[1:21:23] business started flourishing
[1:21:27] looks like he made it looks like I'm all
[1:21:28] right I didn't have to go to that
[1:21:30] extreme
[1:21:31] real good matter of fact he said you
[1:21:34] know what these barns ain't even big
[1:21:35] enough
[1:21:36] I gotta tear them down and I got to
[1:21:37] build some bigger ones glory to God God
[1:21:40] is blessing me he's blessing me and me
[1:21:42] he's having some praise breaks out there
[1:21:44] God is blessing me he's blessing me
[1:21:46] God's Got a Blessing with my name on
[1:21:48] he's got I mean he's just going around
[1:21:49] and around and around I'm believing all
[1:21:51] that but I believe in the real true
[1:21:53] spiritual blessings
[1:21:55] and you know what he said he got so bold
[1:21:57] that he said so
[1:22:00] just wrestle boy
[1:22:02] all is good
[1:22:05] all is good
[1:22:07] all is good
[1:22:10] and his life was required of him
[1:22:14] you know what he put his stock in was
[1:22:17] his riches
[1:22:19] the very thing that held him back
[1:22:21] from the kingdom of God I wonder
[1:22:23] sometimes it isn't riches sometimes it's
[1:22:25] clothing sometimes it's family sometimes
[1:22:27] it's this sometimes whatever it is that
[1:22:30] hinders a life from giving themselves
[1:22:31] fully to God it's the same thing that
[1:22:34] the Rich Young Ruler faced
[1:22:36] but oh I'll tell you what it's worth it
[1:22:38] to surrender it all
[1:22:40] because he's so much greater than
[1:22:41] anything
[1:22:42] he's so much greater than what the
[1:22:44] temporal of this world and whatever more
[1:22:46] that it could ever offer I I just want
[1:22:48] to give him
[1:22:50] everything
[1:22:52] amen let's just let's close right there
[1:22:54] tonight
[1:22:55] amen say Lord
[1:22:58] I Just Surrender oh Lord I just want to
[1:23:01] just surrendering just dedicating
[1:23:03] everything and all that I Am Lord to you
[1:23:07] what really matters when it comes down
[1:23:09] to the end of it what really matters
[1:23:12] what really matters you know brother
[1:23:14] Bram takes it up an invisible unit of
[1:23:15] the bride of Christ and he's talking
[1:23:16] about brother Lyle standing there on the
[1:23:18] platform how brother Lau has led his
[1:23:20] children you know to the Lord and things
[1:23:22] and brother but the brand goes through
[1:23:23] that and he talks about how you know
[1:23:25] those things and he says but you know
[1:23:27] where brother Lyle he said where he
[1:23:28] stands he said it's like in this life he
[1:23:31] said
[1:23:32] this life in itself he said everything
[1:23:33] that we could do will not matter much
[1:23:36] unless we've served the Lord
[1:23:40] that's what matters
[1:23:41] amen and I tell you within it all we
[1:23:44] look at this in the scripture we can see
[1:23:46] and I'm so thankful that within it that
[1:23:49] riches are not a requirement nor are
[1:23:51] riches a sign
[1:23:53] brother Brian goes through it does God
[1:23:55] is there some rich people in the kingdom
[1:23:56] sure there's some rich Paul said not
[1:23:59] many
[1:24:00] right not many
[1:24:02] but how the real rich people are those
[1:24:05] who's rich in him
[1:24:08] amen is rich in him Lord I just want
[1:24:11] more of you
[1:24:12] I want more of you help me Lord if my if
[1:24:14] I've Got My Mind on other things if I've
[1:24:16] Got My Mind on this or mind on that I'm
[1:24:19] trusting in you Lord Jesus I'm trusting
[1:24:21] in you Lord to grind me and direct me
[1:24:23] because I want to make my way prosperous
[1:24:25] I want to see more of you in my life
[1:24:28] we're not Beyond getting off track or
[1:24:30] getting our sights or getting our Focus
[1:24:32] wrong don't ever get that in your mind
[1:24:33] that oh I've got it all set no we need
[1:24:36] his leadership this is why Hebrews 4 12
[1:24:39] the word of God is quick more powerful
[1:24:42] and sharper than any two-edged sword it
[1:24:44] cuts dividing the bone from the moral it
[1:24:46] it goes down to discern the very intents
[1:24:49] of the heart I'm glad that we serve that
[1:24:51] kind of a God I I want if my intentions
[1:24:54] that are within me right now even plans
[1:24:57] that I have if God if those plans do not
[1:25:00] align with your plans I don't wanna
[1:25:03] it might break my heart it might
[1:25:05] disappoint me right brother Brown said
[1:25:08] he's told me no over and over he's
[1:25:09] broken my heart time and time again but
[1:25:11] I love him
[1:25:13] for it
[1:25:16] I want like the song says as musicians
[1:25:19] would come what you want Lord
[1:25:21] you know what's best for me
[1:25:24] you know we can look and it's nothing
[1:25:26] wrong we can look at something we can
[1:25:27] look at things and even sometimes you
[1:25:30] know how it is sometimes you've got to
[1:25:31] pray about maybe a job or promotion or
[1:25:33] something comes up but it's so good to
[1:25:35] be able to put it in prayer and say Lord
[1:25:37] what do what do you say about this
[1:25:39] because there might be things that I
[1:25:41] don't even see about it that you see and
[1:25:44] what matters most to me is is I want to
[1:25:46] serve you with all my heart
[1:25:48] that's a main priority in my life is I
[1:25:51] want more of you Lord
[1:25:53] I want to walk in your presence I I I
[1:25:55] that's my desire so Lord will you guide
[1:25:59] me because you know what I'm able to
[1:26:01] handle you know what your will is
[1:26:03] because any door that God opens up you
[1:26:06] know God will God makes a way for you
[1:26:09] and I to be able to stand in that place
[1:26:11] God provides God makes a way is that
[1:26:14] right that's why as a Believer we don't
[1:26:17] have to force any door open we don't
[1:26:18] have to butter nobody up
[1:26:20] I mean sure we should be nice to people
[1:26:22] but we don't have to butter anybody up
[1:26:23] because once you butter them up one side
[1:26:24] you better have enough butter to go to
[1:26:26] the other side as well
[1:26:27] right because what's got you your
[1:26:29] position is the butter
[1:26:32] but oh God I don't want anything that
[1:26:34] you haven't led me into if my plans
[1:26:37] don't match with your plans
[1:26:40] then Lord
[1:26:41] just take it out of My Heart Lord
[1:26:43] I I just want I want to say Amen to the
[1:26:45] word I want to say so be it Lord in my
[1:26:47] life boy that's my desires there be a
[1:26:49] spiritual prospering my life would grow
[1:26:52] in you
[1:26:54] let's pray Heavenly Father
[1:26:58] Lord
[1:27:01] a desire that rises from within our
[1:27:04] hearts Lord
[1:27:06] job was able to look with an
[1:27:08] understanding
[1:27:11] he was able to see
[1:27:14] and to know just by experiences the
[1:27:17] he saw the wicked around me he saw these
[1:27:20] things of where they had went on and
[1:27:21] things
[1:27:24] there might have been some that were
[1:27:25] cut off removed but job was letting them
[1:27:28] know that that prosperity in the natural
[1:27:30] in these things and blessings and
[1:27:35] that's that's no sign of God's blessing
[1:27:39] when I think of how your Prophet even
[1:27:41] takes it deeper
[1:27:42] oh how we appreciate Lord the blessings
[1:27:45] of God
[1:27:47] how we appreciate Lord your presence
[1:27:49] moving down
[1:27:51] that God
[1:27:53] May our hearts May every heart
[1:27:57] just welcoming you Lord
[1:27:59] in fully
[1:28:02] to where Lord
[1:28:04] there's no resting upon
[1:28:08] feeling and emotion a blessing because
[1:28:10] that's there's no life in that
[1:28:12] all of those things Lord they come apart
[1:28:15] they come with
[1:28:16] the package but
[1:28:18] we understand that Lord even in that
[1:28:21] part of it
[1:28:22] the rain falls on the just and unjust
[1:28:26] your God
[1:28:28] our hearts desire is Lord
[1:28:30] I want to be changed
[1:28:34] Lord have been changed and I want to I
[1:28:37] want to continue to be changed
[1:28:39] that's a promise the Lord is here we are
[1:28:42] in the presence of the Shekinah Glory
[1:28:45] that Shekinah dwelling in our lives and
[1:28:47] Lord we are changed from Glory unto
[1:28:50] Glory even as by the spirit of the Lord
[1:28:54] oh God
[1:28:57] may that be
[1:28:59] our ambition may that be our desire may
[1:29:01] that be Lord the consolation in our
[1:29:04] heart
[1:29:05] what really matters when we think of
[1:29:07] this year 2023 what really matters
[1:29:11] what really matters
[1:29:14] what is it that really matters in our
[1:29:16] life what because whatever really
[1:29:18] matters

[1:29:57] there's an order and there's a blessing
[1:29:59] in the order
[1:30:01] of God
[1:30:03] help us Lord that our lives where the
[1:30:05] Bible could say order my steps
[1:30:09] in Thy Word

[1:30:15] if there's some things that
[1:30:17] we've cut out
[1:30:19] or we've compromised on that we didn't
[1:30:22] need to cut out or shouldn't have been
[1:30:24] help us the Lord to cut out the other
[1:30:26] things that we've cut in
[1:30:29] and everything Lord would be right back
[1:30:31] in this place to where it needs to be
[1:30:33] may that be the focus Lord may that be
[1:30:35] in our heart
[1:30:37] as we move into this year what really
[1:30:39] matters

[1:31:17] us can look throughout the whole year
[1:31:18] and we could we have a desire but God
[1:31:21] may we reflect on it Lord may it be that

[1:31:29] and when decisions Lord are to be made
