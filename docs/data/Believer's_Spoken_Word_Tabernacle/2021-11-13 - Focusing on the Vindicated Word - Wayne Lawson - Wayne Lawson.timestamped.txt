[43:57] like to go to the word of the Lord amen
[43:59] appreciate the music tonight amen
[44:03] it's always a blessing amen the music
[44:05] goes right out in front of the word
[44:07] battle amen we will turn to the Bible
[44:10] the book of Zechariah the 14th chapter
[44:13] amen we
[44:16] turn there tonight and Zechariah Chapter
[44:19] 14 be reading the seventh verse
[44:25] Zechariah 14 and 7.
[44:30] it's a very familiar scripture to the
[44:33] message of the hour amen it's a very
[44:36] powerful scripture
[44:38] it is one of the promises of what God
[44:40] would do in the end time in our age
[44:43] in Zechariah 14 and 7 but it shall be
[44:46] one day
[44:47] we shall be known to the Lord not day
[44:50] nor night
[44:52] but it shall come to pass
[44:55] that at the evening time
[44:58] it shall
[45:00] be right we ask the Lord to bless his
[45:03] word tonight you may be seated
[45:06] I want to speak to you just a little bit
[45:08] tonight upon focusing
[45:10] on the Vindicated word focusing on the
[45:13] Vindicated word amen I I think and
[45:17] believe tonight that there's a lot of
[45:19] promises in the Bible and I thank God
[45:21] for his promises amen I remember when I
[45:24] was just coming into the
[45:26] into the message of the hour and I
[45:28] started learning some of the Bible
[45:30] scriptures that spoke of end time and
[45:33] this was one of them that always was
[45:34] very astounding to me
[45:36] was in Zechariah 14 that it shall be not
[45:39] day or night but she'll come to pass at
[45:41] the evening time that it shall be light
[45:43] it was always astounding to me that it
[45:46] would be light in the evening time that
[45:48] and and I thought isn't it something uh
[45:50] for years I I looked at that word light
[45:53] and I thought a lot about it what does
[45:55] that really mean it shall we lied in the
[45:57] evening time but you know as we as we
[45:59] went through the years and began to
[46:01] study the the scripture I found that
[46:03] this scripture could be maybe written uh
[46:06] we could say it like this that in the
[46:08] evening time scripture will be fulfilled
[46:11] uh it it shall be lie but what that's
[46:14] speaking of is that scriptures will be
[46:17] fulfilled and when scripture is
[46:19] fulfilled it becomes a lie to the age of
[46:23] the people that's living in that
[46:24] generation and that light would be the
[46:27] light of the Vindication of the word of
[46:29] God in other words it becomes a surety
[46:31] or of a truth that becomes
[46:34] unquestionable and I believe sometimes
[46:37] we need to uh if we if we maybe could
[46:40] refocus ourselves or our lives that
[46:44] there has to be a center point for our
[46:45] Focus there has to be something that we
[46:47] are keep in our view that stabilizes us
[46:50] that keeps our strength it keeps us
[46:53] reminded who we are it refreshes us in
[46:56] our lives and it produces the faith we
[46:58] need to be able to surpass the
[47:01] situations that we find ourselves in you
[47:03] know in the message of the Feast of the
[47:04] trumpets brother Ben will tell us this
[47:06] he'll tell us that you know unless we're
[47:09] constantly in the word to know what he
[47:11] see you know people is going to miss
[47:15] this end time thing they're going to
[47:16] miss what God is doing in the end time
[47:18] do you know that the people on the Earth
[47:21] and the days of our Lord Jesus many of
[47:24] them missed him amen and do you know it
[47:26] was not even prophesied to be a secret
[47:28] in his first coming but in his second
[47:31] coming he made a promise that it would
[47:32] be as a thief and a night that it would
[47:34] be a secret and so people today are
[47:36] going to miss they're going to miss the
[47:38] Vindication or the word they're going to
[47:40] miss that and the prophet said now how
[47:42] would they know unless they would stay
[47:44] constantly in the word and then he goes
[47:46] over to the Book of Daniel and he said
[47:48] but the wise shall know and the foolish
[47:49] and the unwise wouldn't know he said
[47:52] they shall know their God and how he
[47:53] shall appear in the last days to bring
[47:56] these people back to the word so the
[47:58] bride will know her husband her mate the
[48:02] revealed word
[48:03] that's why this has to happen it wasn't
[48:06] reformers Luther Wesley the Pentecostals
[48:08] scripture says it wasn't but it will
[48:10] come that is the promise for this age we
[48:12] are living in the age that his coming
[48:15] will be in see she will must be
[48:17] identified a woman must be identified in
[48:19] her husband and Christ's bride has to be
[48:21] identified with him for these two are
[48:23] one and he is the word not the
[48:26] denomination the word and we are to be
[48:29] Children of the light and the light is
[48:31] the word which is made light for this
[48:35] age now how do we know light except it
[48:38] comes from the word all right the word
[48:40] made flesh is the light of the age the
[48:45] word made flesh is the light of the aces
[48:48] what is the light this the word made
[48:50] flesh that is the light of the age in
[48:53] the rising of the sun brother random
[48:55] will say who is the son of man for in
[48:57] the beginning was the word and the Word
[49:00] was with God and the Word was God and
[49:02] the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among
[49:04] Us and if all the teaching we have and
[49:06] the confirmation of the word of God word
[49:08] by word Signs by wonders we see today in
[49:11] the Book of Luke and and he said Luke 17
[49:13] 30 and Malachi 4 and different
[49:15] scriptures were acquainted with that the
[49:17] word again is waived over the people
[49:20] that Dead traditions of man is dead and
[49:22] the Son of God is alive again with the
[49:25] baptism of the Holy Spirit right Among
[49:28] Us and is giving us life and it is
[49:32] giving us life amen I think it's very
[49:35] powerful when you start looking at
[49:37] sermon titles sometimes and brother
[49:39] animal speak one here and he'll call it
[49:41] there is a man here that can turn on the
[49:44] light
[49:45] there is a man here that can turn on the
[49:48] light see in the evening time it shall
[49:50] be light and then he announces there is
[49:53] a man here that can turn on the light
[49:55] see see only God can make his word live
[49:58] amen anybody can impersonate anything
[50:00] they can do anything they want but only
[50:03] God can make his word live he can
[50:05] manifest his own word and brother man
[50:08] said see then there's a man here that
[50:10] can turn on the light there's a man here
[50:12] that can vindicate the word in its
[50:14] season there's a man here that can do
[50:16] that there's no reason to fear because
[50:18] God has made a promise that he would do
[50:21] it in this season there's a man here to
[50:22] turn on the light he says so life is
[50:25] only by the word of God made manifest
[50:27] life comes only by the word of God
[50:31] manifest see as long as it's in the book
[50:34] like this it can still be questioned see
[50:37] as long as the word is just in the Bible
[50:40] it can still be questioned but when it's
[50:42] made manifest he said then you see the
[50:45] pride product of what is spoke of being
[50:47] manifest then the light is on the word
[50:50] see that's what brings it see when it
[50:53] comes to pass that's the life in light
[50:56] light bringing life see the light brings
[51:00] life so that's the same thing it is in
[51:03] the word the word of God and when life
[51:04] strikes it the light strikes it it's the
[51:06] word in life see every age has been that
[51:09] way how we appreciate these great things
[51:11] and how that word being Vindicated is
[51:14] the light of the spoken word of God
[51:18] now brother man was telling us something
[51:20] very clearly as long as it's in the
[51:22] Bible it can be questioned but when the
[51:24] words manifested it becomes a light and
[51:27] it becomes unquestionable can I say it
[51:29] like this it becomes an infallible
[51:31] evidence that this is God dealing with
[51:33] you see the kind of God that we serve he
[51:36] don't ask you to serve him without you
[51:39] knowing what you're serving amen we are
[51:41] not worshiping at the altar of an
[51:43] unknown God such as with all found in
[51:46] that land God is not just saying to you
[51:48] just worship you know those people say
[51:49] to you just worship just worship but
[51:52] amen but what what do you want me to
[51:54] worship amen there's there's different
[51:55] ways of worshiping the Bible said that
[51:57] you can worship and worship God in vain
[52:00] amen making the traditions of the word
[52:03] of God and and taking the effect out of
[52:05] the word amen but I find out that when
[52:08] God makes something manifested then that
[52:11] produces a place of worship to the
[52:14] Church of the Living God when God
[52:16] manifestes his word he's interpreting
[52:19] the scripture to you and that is the
[52:22] Gate of the worship of almighty God so
[52:25] if God's going to require you to worship
[52:26] he's got to make known at what Gates
[52:29] you're going to worship he's got to
[52:30] invite you to the place of worship where
[52:33] you know without a shadow of a doubt
[52:35] that you're giving worship to almighty
[52:37] God this is the season but the Bible
[52:40] said that the elect would be deceived if
[52:42] it were possible but see God is going to
[52:45] take this elect seed into a place of
[52:48] infallibility where their worship will
[52:50] be received by God and Satan will not be
[52:53] stealing the worship of this Bride for
[52:56] her worship goes directly unto God in
[52:58] this season but it's not because that we
[53:01] were somehow that we were a special
[53:03] ideal or we we somehow did something
[53:05] wonderful but God by his grace
[53:08] manifested himself so plainly that not
[53:11] even a fool would airfare in if he would
[53:14] just believe the Simplicity of what God
[53:17] has done in the season then we're living
[53:18] in look what he does when God begins to
[53:21] manifest he takes the question out of it
[53:23] amen he gives us the answer he he takes
[53:26] the question away from what does this
[53:28] mean what does this scripture mean he
[53:30] when he manifestes it now we have the
[53:33] perfect interpretation of the perfect
[53:35] word which produces the the Vindication
[53:38] of the word of God do you see what it'll
[53:40] do it'll give you a product amen I
[53:42] amazing when you hear Brother Branham
[53:45] say that it's come to a place now he
[53:47] said to disbelieve this word would be a
[53:49] sin
[53:50] that God is so thoroughly Vindicated it
[53:53] that it would now become a sin to
[53:55] disbelieve that this is God manifesting
[53:57] this and this age do you recognize that
[54:00] there is no life outside of the message
[54:03] of the hour the prophet of God said
[54:05] there is no life that can come outside
[54:08] of light light produces life and there
[54:11] can be no life outside of light natural
[54:14] or spiritual there must be and only
[54:17] light can come by the word of God God's
[54:20] word is a light when it's manifested see
[54:23] otherwise it's just a seed laying here
[54:26] then there's got to come a lie for there
[54:28] to be life in the sea in other words
[54:31] your carriers of a Siege you have a
[54:33] genetics of God inside you but the
[54:36] potential that you have is locked into
[54:38] you until God sends a light upon the
[54:41] church that would open up the potential
[54:43] that's why that the Baptist could never
[54:45] bring you to a bride the Pentecost can
[54:48] never bring you to a bride you he would
[54:50] take a greater light in this season
[54:52] because this is harvest season we're not
[54:55] living in the stock of the Hurst we're
[54:58] living when the seed and the husk are
[55:00] separating and that takes a harvest Sun
[55:03] that takes an evening light it takes the
[55:06] maturity of the word of God coming into
[55:09] this season I know it's strong amen this
[55:12] message is a strong message and I know
[55:14] there's some people so don't preach the
[55:16] message so strong they don't they don't
[55:17] want the strength of the message amen
[55:19] but it's the strength of the message
[55:21] amen that stimulates the faith of the
[55:24] bride of Christ that brings her out from
[55:26] under the shuttle listen as long as
[55:28] we're in the shock then we have
[55:31] something that is harnessing the
[55:33] potential of what God designs you to be
[55:36] you have been designed to have the
[55:39] potential of almighty God Sons and
[55:41] Daughters this is the season of adoption
[55:44] this is the season of the full
[55:46] glorification of the name of almighty
[55:49] God church I'll tell you what that name
[55:51] is tonight amen that name is in the
[55:54] bride of Christ she is now known as Miss
[55:57] Jesus Christ come on Amen and that name
[56:01] is a representation of the manifestation
[56:04] of the word of God then the bride is the
[56:07] place of manifestation in this hour it's
[56:10] got to be manifesting that word you see
[56:13] then that light begins to come over the
[56:15] church now I know I know people say to
[56:18] me all the time so you know they think
[56:20] maybe I'm a little strong on
[56:21] predestination maybe I am but I believe
[56:23] that it's one of the final birth Pains
[56:25] of the great bride Revival I think
[56:27] whenever you finally grasp the
[56:30] sovereignty of God through
[56:31] predestination that it'll take you over
[56:33] every hump it'll take you over every
[56:35] battle in your life when you recognize
[56:38] that Satan cannot change in time what
[56:42] God has done into eternity then you're
[56:44] ready to recognize God took a picture of
[56:46] me in my perfection amen and that is the
[56:49] positive positive and this is the
[56:51] negative and you'll never change the
[56:53] positive by the negative amen only thing
[56:56] will happen is it'll make a development
[56:58] of your life coming to the Perfection of
[57:01] the word of God Amen it'd be something
[57:03] if I took a picture of you right and I
[57:05] took the picture outside and I draw the
[57:07] mustache or took all your hair off or
[57:10] something like that and showed somebody
[57:11] that picture amen and they looked at the
[57:13] picture well that's something that I did
[57:15] to the picture but I didn't do it to him
[57:18] amen do you see what it is that that he
[57:21] remains the same person and and God has
[57:24] the real you he has the picture of the
[57:26] real you up in heaven and this is only
[57:29] the negative of what God has already
[57:31] done and Satan can marry can mingle he
[57:35] can hurt he can do whatever he wants to
[57:37] do but God is already determined the
[57:40] Church of the Living God where she is
[57:42] and what she's doing amen I just want to
[57:44] maybe say this I think it's beautiful
[57:46] when you start recognizing that Satan is
[57:49] already a defeated
[57:51] that this battle is already won amen we
[57:54] are not fighting they meant to determine
[57:56] whether or not we're Pride we're not
[57:58] determined Amen to fight whether or not
[58:00] we're going to be saved or lost come on
[58:02] church amen that has already been a
[58:05] determination amen that's outside of our
[58:08] ability amen I can stand here with the
[58:10] scripture all night he said you have not
[58:13] chosen me but I have chosen you Amen to
[58:16] Bear forth much fruit in its season amen
[58:19] that if he done the chosen brother bam
[58:21] said when did he do it according to
[58:23] Ephesians the first chapter he said he
[58:25] chose you in him before the foundation
[58:28] of the world and then again it is
[58:31] written in the Book of Romans the eighth
[58:33] chapter had as many as he's called he's
[58:36] Justified and many as he's Justified
[58:38] he's already glorified is that right
[58:42] amen has he already glorified this bride
[58:44] then right now we are already glorified
[58:48] in the presence of almighty God I love
[58:50] how brother Brandon and said it he said
[58:52] let the devil have all the temper
[58:53] tantrum he wants to have this body has
[58:56] already been glorified and there's
[58:58] nothing the devil can do about it I
[59:01] thank God tonight that there's a
[59:03] bloodline that Satan cannot cross amen
[59:06] that God is already identified with the
[59:08] Church of the Living God what an hour to
[59:11] serve the Lord what an hour to live it's
[59:14] an hour of light do you see that Siege
[59:16] you're a seed amen that seed that's in
[59:19] your heart amen comes from God that
[59:21] comes from God that soul that you have
[59:24] brother Brown said he is a gene of God
[59:27] Amen now that's pretty powerful so as
[59:29] much as my son or my daughter is a
[59:32] product of my life you are a product of
[59:35] the life of almighty God I know you're a
[59:37] human being and we we talk about that a
[59:40] little bit too much I think sometimes we
[59:42] ought to change our focus and take it
[59:45] off of humanity and put it upon deity
[59:48] because you're more than just a human
[59:50] amen there is a deity part of the Church
[59:53] of the Living God I think it's time to
[59:56] adjust our focus and see that we are the
[59:59] word of the age that we're living in
[1:00:01] identified by the message of the hour
[1:00:04] brother what a time to live amen what a
[1:00:07] time to live do you see this message is
[1:00:10] it is a light it man it's a Vindicated
[1:00:12] word it is a light and when it strikes
[1:00:15] the seed there's something going to come
[1:00:16] to life
[1:00:18] and it doesn't matter the conditions or
[1:00:21] the situations when the light strikes it
[1:00:23] there's a power in the seed it will
[1:00:25] manifest it will come forth and there's
[1:00:28] nothing that can keep it from coming
[1:00:29] forth it doesn't matter the situation
[1:00:31] because God has the ability in the seed
[1:00:35] already to make it manifest brother Adam
[1:00:37] uses this to make a point he actually
[1:00:39] says that one time there was a seed that
[1:00:42] was found back there in the pyramids hey
[1:00:44] man he said in one place he called it
[1:00:45] the Garners of Joseph he said they found
[1:00:48] that seed back there he said they found
[1:00:50] it stuck away and here it is thousands
[1:00:53] of years later they brought that seed
[1:00:55] out from the from the Garners and they
[1:00:57] put it in the ground put a little water
[1:00:59] on it and when the light Struck it he
[1:01:02] meant it had life in it and it come and
[1:01:04] manifest whatever God had spoke in the
[1:01:06] beginning do you see then amen that God
[1:01:09] Amen no matter how old that seed is amen
[1:01:13] the prophet will tell you that you were
[1:01:15] sealed in the womb of God's mind before
[1:01:18] the foundation in the world didn't he
[1:01:20] say it didn't he say you were in him
[1:01:22] before the foundation of the world but
[1:01:24] in this season of time amen God opened
[1:01:27] up the Garners of Joseph and took out
[1:01:30] one of his seed words and he put it in a
[1:01:32] little ground he put it in the ground
[1:01:34] that we're sitting right here tonight he
[1:01:36] placed that seed in you and then he sent
[1:01:39] the light of the resurrection of the Son
[1:01:41] of God and that seed lived it's millions
[1:01:45] of years old amen it was in the mind of
[1:01:48] God before he formed the world but it's
[1:01:50] alive tonight it's alive with life
[1:01:53] tonight this is not a dead church we are
[1:01:56] not a formal church we are not a Creed
[1:01:59] seeking church we are the body of Jesus
[1:02:02] Christ borne by the blood by the power
[1:02:04] of the Holy Ghost a light that is shined
[1:02:07] upon the church he manifies the devil
[1:02:10] I'll be fighting that light too if I was
[1:02:12] the devil I'd be trying to put this
[1:02:14] light out too I'd be trying to say this
[1:02:16] message ain't no good and has no power
[1:02:17] because that devil knows that when this
[1:02:20] bride recognizes who she is and the
[1:02:23] potential of that seed that's on the
[1:02:25] inside of her he has already lost the
[1:02:27] battle she is an invincible Army uh
[1:02:31] church I I sometimes want to ask the
[1:02:33] people of God Amen if we ain't the
[1:02:35] people then I pray you tell me who is
[1:02:38] if this ain't the season then I pray you
[1:02:40] tell me what season we're looking for
[1:02:42] there ain't nobody in the Earth today
[1:02:44] that won't say we're at the end time
[1:02:47] ever ever Baptist ever Presbyterian
[1:02:50] everybody you talk to we are at the end
[1:02:52] time we are at the end time amen that
[1:02:55] the bombs could drop tomorrow well
[1:02:57] listen if the Rapture could happen in
[1:02:59] the morning then you tell me when the
[1:03:01] bride's going to be manifesting before
[1:03:03] the Rapture amen could it be going on
[1:03:06] right now and Satan is trying to
[1:03:09] distract you with covet and mask or no
[1:03:12] mask or vaccine and no vaccine he's
[1:03:15] trying to get your attention off of the
[1:03:17] manifestation of the word of God because
[1:03:20] if the bride looks away she looks away
[1:03:22] from the promises of God she goes into
[1:03:25] the waves of the storms just like Peter
[1:03:28] did that night but if you keep your eyes
[1:03:30] on Jesus there ain't nothing that'll
[1:03:33] seek you there ain't nothing that'll
[1:03:35] hold you down there's a focus tonight
[1:03:37] and then this bride focuses on that word
[1:03:40] then the potential of her Focus will
[1:03:43] drop down into her soul
[1:03:45] brother amen
[1:03:48] somebody said well brother Wayne I don't
[1:03:50] think I'm good ground I believe you are
[1:03:52] I believe some brought 20 and some
[1:03:54] brought 60. but there was some brought
[1:03:56] 100 fold and there's some lots and
[1:03:58] there's some Abrahams and brother man
[1:04:00] said it'd take a hundred lots to make
[1:04:01] one Abraham but I think we got some
[1:04:04] Abraham seed here tonight I think we got
[1:04:06] an abrahamic Covenant over the Church of
[1:04:08] the Living God seeds that have failed in
[1:04:11] good ground didn't Jesus say that didn't
[1:04:14] he say his word would come into good
[1:04:15] ground
[1:04:17] come on now brother Brown said good
[1:04:19] ground he said that's pre-prepared
[1:04:21] ground
[1:04:23] hey man Rapture book faith is Works
[1:04:26] expressed both of them or works is Faith
[1:04:28] Express wife I'm sorry amen both of
[1:04:30] those sermons he taught us
[1:04:32] that the good ground Jesus spoke of was
[1:04:35] the church is that right now it gets
[1:04:37] confusing don't it because one time I'm
[1:04:39] calling you a ground and the word a seed
[1:04:41] and another time I call you a seed in
[1:04:43] the word light amen but if you read
[1:04:45] Matthew 13 this this helped me years ago
[1:04:48] in Matthew the 13th chapter there's two
[1:04:51] Parables laying there
[1:04:52] remember Jesus tells the parable of the
[1:04:55] word falling on the ground as a seed
[1:04:57] it's a good seed but the ground
[1:05:00] determined the growth of the seed some
[1:05:01] fell in rocks some fell in rolling this
[1:05:04] something you know something but some
[1:05:05] fell in good ground
[1:05:07] and brother man said see that good seed
[1:05:09] is the word that good ground is the
[1:05:10] believer
[1:05:11] but then in the next chapter
[1:05:14] or in the next part of the third that's
[1:05:16] the next page in my Bible but in Matthew
[1:05:18] 13 then Jesus tells a story a man of two
[1:05:21] Sowers sowing in the earth and this time
[1:05:24] the Earth is the Earth but the seed is
[1:05:27] the children of God so when one Parable
[1:05:29] you received in another Parable you're
[1:05:31] the Earth amen but in every Parable you
[1:05:34] belong to God Amen you're the good
[1:05:36] ground you're the good seed the bride of
[1:05:38] Christ the potential amen and this is
[1:05:40] what has come in this age light has come
[1:05:43] on this to make that manifest oh I love
[1:05:46] it when I see that God has come in this
[1:05:48] age for judgment he's coming this age
[1:05:51] for judgment everybody runs backwards
[1:05:53] from judgment but the Bible doesn't say
[1:05:55] Jesus come to condemn he said he come to
[1:05:56] judge amen that's a powerful thing when
[1:05:59] you catch that Revelation he never come
[1:06:01] to condemn you he come to judge you amen
[1:06:04] and this judgment he puts on your life
[1:06:06] to give you Grace is not a fixed court
[1:06:09] it's the truth amen it's the truth it's
[1:06:12] the Vindicated truth of God I'll put it
[1:06:15] I'll put it in a in a Simplicity the way
[1:06:17] I understand these things amen is when
[1:06:19] the sun begins to shine and It Shines on
[1:06:22] a field that's planted the sunshine
[1:06:24] don't change the seed
[1:06:26] the sun sign judges the seed that's
[1:06:29] laying there it makes it manifest
[1:06:32] whether it's wheat or corn a cuckaburra
[1:06:35] whatever's laying in the field the sun
[1:06:37] makes it manifest and this is the rising
[1:06:40] of the Sun and this is God's word
[1:06:43] shining on the bride of Christ and
[1:06:46] something in your heart begin to believe
[1:06:49] then that means you're not an empty Rock
[1:06:52] Amen you're not an empty piece of salt
[1:06:54] as the seed laid in you that comes from
[1:06:57] the foundation of the world Amen and
[1:07:00] that seed laying there has been waiting
[1:07:02] for this message for this season for
[1:07:05] this time brother Branham actually
[1:07:07] speaks about how Christ was the first
[1:07:09] one to raise Amen in the in the New
[1:07:12] Testament he was the first one that
[1:07:14] slept he said but in the bride coming of
[1:07:16] Christ coming out of the church there
[1:07:18] will have to be a Sheaf waved again in
[1:07:20] the last days
[1:07:21] a waving of the sheath you all know what
[1:07:24] that means it means they planted a field
[1:07:26] when the seed come to maturity there was
[1:07:28] a first portion of maturity that come in
[1:07:30] a field and they picked that sheath and
[1:07:33] they would take the Harvest what they'd
[1:07:34] do is harvest the wheat and they'd take
[1:07:36] it back barley wheat whatever it was and
[1:07:38] then they would wave it in front of the
[1:07:40] priest and that sheath being waved amen
[1:07:43] was the sign that that the seed was in
[1:07:47] its process in other words we put a seed
[1:07:49] in the ground and now it's come back to
[1:07:52] seed again the process has been
[1:07:54] fulfilled and it would be acceptable
[1:07:56] when that when that sheath was accepted
[1:07:58] the whole field got accepted is that
[1:08:01] right now we know that sheath was Christ
[1:08:04] is that right but it's Christ in this
[1:08:06] age so Christ had to have a body amen
[1:08:10] amen we're not we're not talking about
[1:08:12] deifying a man William Branham but we're
[1:08:15] talking about a seed coming to maturity
[1:08:17] amen as an answer to the mystery of
[1:08:21] godliness adoption is not a figment of
[1:08:24] imagination adoption is a reality and
[1:08:28] we're living in the season where men who
[1:08:31] are not virgin born but sin born will
[1:08:34] come to adoption by the blood of Jesus
[1:08:37] Christ in this age oh if you'll change
[1:08:39] your focus and realize this church
[1:08:41] you're never going to be an angel you
[1:08:44] were never meant to be an angel you were
[1:08:46] a son to begin with and this is the age
[1:08:50] how can I say it like this this is when
[1:08:52] attributes are going to be manifested if
[1:08:55] we say it like that it's a little easier
[1:08:57] to take some time how many believes
[1:08:59] you're an attribute you're an attribute
[1:09:01] of God so then this is the season of
[1:09:03] attributes being manifested is that
[1:09:05] right amen now what is an attribute from
[1:09:08] a man it's a son
[1:09:10] so this is the season of the
[1:09:12] manifestation of the sons of God Amen
[1:09:15] then Romans 8 is not hard anymore Romans
[1:09:19] 8 being the season of the manifestation
[1:09:21] so he's talking about you the attributes
[1:09:24] of God are manifesting in this season
[1:09:26] and the whole earth is groaning waiting
[1:09:29] for the manifestation of sons and when
[1:09:32] William Branham was standing on the
[1:09:33] earth there was the first son to
[1:09:36] maturity for this broad age and when God
[1:09:40] accepted him when God accepted him as a
[1:09:44] part of this bright season he opened up
[1:09:47] an age to the Church of the Living God
[1:09:49] and here we stand tonight we are no
[1:09:52] longer in a Pentecostal age we have
[1:09:55] moved from the shuck to the Sea we've
[1:09:57] come into the age of the manifestation
[1:09:59] of the seed life of almighty God Amen
[1:10:02] the light is shining adoption time Holy
[1:10:06] Ghost Field Time the fullness of the
[1:10:09] word time we are not worshiping unto the
[1:10:11] banners of Pentecost amen the life that
[1:10:14] was in Pentecost is now in this message
[1:10:17] and we have not lost anything that
[1:10:20] Pentecost had we've only took what they
[1:10:23] had and now it's come to potential don't
[1:10:26] tell me that God that we've lost
[1:10:28] something don't tell me this bride don't
[1:10:30] have everything Pentecost has brother we
[1:10:33] got everything they had plus a little
[1:10:35] amen what what's it about it's an age of
[1:10:38] restoration is it not this is not God
[1:10:40] taking this is God adding until the
[1:10:44] church comes to a full restoration of
[1:10:46] the word of God I believe that's the
[1:10:48] season we're living in now amen I know
[1:10:51] amen I believe it's the season we're in
[1:10:53] now amen to think of this that this
[1:10:55] first one that comes to maturity amen
[1:10:58] now the beautiful thing is is when it
[1:11:01] comes to maturity amen that it means
[1:11:04] there's a field full
[1:11:07] there's more common
[1:11:10] there's more preachers in the field
[1:11:12] come on Church there's more Believers in
[1:11:15] the field there's more Sons and
[1:11:17] Daughters of God that have come into the
[1:11:19] field I don't I don't know how to
[1:11:21] explain it other than just simple for me
[1:11:22] but when when Albert Einstein come along
[1:11:26] he was a gift wasn't he Albert
[1:11:28] Einstein's mind was a gift God sinning
[1:11:30] of the earth I believe it falls under
[1:11:32] Daniel the 12th chapter knowledge shall
[1:11:34] increase in the Earth somebody has to
[1:11:36] manifest that
[1:11:38] has to come into a human being and God
[1:11:40] gave a mind like Albert Einstein
[1:11:42] inspiration dropped upon him and he put
[1:11:44] from the Tree of Life and More Death
[1:11:46] come from it remember that amen but he
[1:11:49] opened up an age an atomic age one man
[1:11:53] by inspiration opened up an age that
[1:11:56] everybody's now following and and simple
[1:11:59] people in elementary he's reading about
[1:12:01] it amen they're they're powering ships
[1:12:04] by they're doing War by they're doing
[1:12:06] medicine bites amen it's because of the
[1:12:09] atomic age and here we have a prophet
[1:12:12] who is the first member of that bride to
[1:12:15] come to maturity and the field is now
[1:12:18] full and the LIE is a harvest light and
[1:12:21] the Reapers that have come is working in
[1:12:24] a field that is right for Harvest it's
[1:12:26] the season to preach this message it's a
[1:12:29] season to believe this message
[1:12:32] it's a season to ripen hey man come on
[1:12:35] now come on it's a seasoned Church lay
[1:12:38] in the presence of the Sun for the
[1:12:41] ripening of the word of God is that
[1:12:42] right how many times brother Graham say
[1:12:44] it separate from the shuttle lay in the
[1:12:46] sun lay in the sun lay in the sun
[1:12:47] because it's the season to get under the
[1:12:50] message of the hour it's the sunlight
[1:12:53] and it's bringing the potential of the
[1:12:56] church to its fullness that's where
[1:12:58] we're sitting here tonight underneath
[1:13:00] that light I know I I know people ask me
[1:13:02] all the time about that Harvest rain it
[1:13:05] meant because it's harvest season you
[1:13:06] know so we use the word ladder rain and
[1:13:09] it scares people to death former latter
[1:13:11] rain so most people has latter rain
[1:13:13] somewhere's way out in the future we got
[1:13:15] to go through a tribulation you know God
[1:13:17] get beat up and persecuted there's got
[1:13:19] to be a boycott all these things has got
[1:13:21] to happen this and that well you know
[1:13:22] brother bam kind of presented that in
[1:13:25] early 50s but by the time he come to
[1:13:27] Feast the trumpets of 1964 he made a
[1:13:30] corner in his ministry amen and told the
[1:13:33] church that we wouldn't go through a
[1:13:35] tribulation or a persecution as the
[1:13:38] early church but the next thing that's
[1:13:40] going to happen in the church is a
[1:13:42] change of our bodies that we are laying
[1:13:45] under the light of the change of our
[1:13:48] bodies that's what's about to happen
[1:13:50] amen inside the seed that's making you
[1:13:53] live right you inside the seed that's
[1:13:55] making you think right believe right act
[1:13:57] right inside the sea that took you out
[1:14:00] of the bar that took you out of the
[1:14:01] Baptist that took you out and also lays
[1:14:04] the potential to step from one dimension
[1:14:07] to another to change from a marker to an
[1:14:10] immortal if you keep laying in the light
[1:14:12] amen it won't be long in your gray hair
[1:14:15] it's going to start turning black your
[1:14:17] body is going to go back to what it was
[1:14:19] to begin with amen we are not looking
[1:14:22] for a lot of rain the Bible says the
[1:14:25] former and the latter will fall together
[1:14:27] we are living under the latter rain
[1:14:30] power it's rapturing Faith time it's
[1:14:34] Holy Ghost time I know I know there's a
[1:14:36] lot of people not living under it but it
[1:14:38] ain't that God didn't pour it out
[1:14:42] now y'all ask ask the simple question
[1:14:44] what does the latter rain do it matures
[1:14:48] hey man what's this evening light doing
[1:14:50] it's maturing evening light a lot of
[1:14:55] rain it's the same thing
[1:14:57] it's rapturing Faith it's harvest time
[1:15:01] it's adoption time amen the first time
[1:15:04] brother man said come forth for a bright
[1:15:06] age not atomic age of right age that's
[1:15:09] got to come some bride to have a bright
[1:15:11] age somebody's got to reach maturity
[1:15:14] somebody's got to come to it no wonder
[1:15:16] William Branham improving his word
[1:15:18] announced that we have come to the
[1:15:20] marriage of the Lamb
[1:15:22] we're not going to be married we're
[1:15:24] already married that we're not living in
[1:15:26] a flirting age we're not living in a
[1:15:29] dating age this is not amen and
[1:15:32] engagement season this is the marriage
[1:15:35] of the Lamb when the bride has become a
[1:15:37] mature woman and took on the name and
[1:15:40] manifestation of the word of God what a
[1:15:43] season to focus on his word what a
[1:15:45] season amen what a season to give it
[1:15:48] amen for the first time will come a
[1:15:50] bright age for a resurrection out of
[1:15:53] dark denominationalism will be a message
[1:15:55] that the full maturity listen to that
[1:15:57] the message will be a full maturity the
[1:16:00] word has turned again into its power and
[1:16:03] is being waived over the People by the
[1:16:05] same signs and wonders as he did back
[1:16:07] there
[1:16:09] now listen this
[1:16:10] he was the Fulfillment of that word
[1:16:13] he was the manifestation of that word
[1:16:16] and so is it today
[1:16:18] God's word has been fulfilled at that
[1:16:21] hour that's the light God manifesting
[1:16:25] himself that's the light Jesus said I am
[1:16:29] the light of the world do you know that
[1:16:32] Jesus is the light
[1:16:34] the word manifested is Jesus that's who
[1:16:38] he is today he's his word manifested in
[1:16:41] Isaiah 45 amen it's said like it's in
[1:16:44] the 22nd verse look unto me all you be
[1:16:46] saved and all ye the ends of the Earth
[1:16:49] brother takes this scripture and
[1:16:51] preaches look look away to Jesus and
[1:16:54] look unto me all of those are bases upon
[1:16:58] not looking at the Corporal body of
[1:17:00] Jesus but looking at the works of God in
[1:17:04] the season that has been Vindicated
[1:17:07] you see the works has expressed God in
[1:17:10] the age that you're living in Jesus said
[1:17:12] don't believe me believe the works for
[1:17:15] they testify of who I am is that right
[1:17:18] then search the scriptures and in them
[1:17:21] you say you have eternal life and they
[1:17:24] are those that testify of me see what
[1:17:27] testified of God in the days of
[1:17:29] Pentecost it was a Reformation of gifts
[1:17:31] amen it was a testimony that was Jesus
[1:17:34] working on those people that was Jesus
[1:17:37] manifesting in those people and that
[1:17:39] same Jesus has manifested today but not
[1:17:42] just in gifts but in the fullness of his
[1:17:45] own word
[1:17:47] he says look unto me and be saved all ye
[1:17:50] ends of the Earth look unto me amen now
[1:17:54] brother man preaches a message Look Away
[1:17:55] to Jesus
[1:17:57] now he's not talking about looking away
[1:17:59] to his Corporal body he's talking about
[1:18:01] looking away from the world and looking
[1:18:04] on the manifestation of the Season
[1:18:07] you're living in in other words look
[1:18:09] Jesus Is Right Here among us tonight if
[1:18:12] you know where to look
[1:18:15] if you know how to look for him you'll
[1:18:18] see him right here tonight you'll see
[1:18:19] him right here in this building he's
[1:18:21] here in this building I can promise you
[1:18:23] that his word promises you that but
[1:18:26] you've got to know how to look for him
[1:18:27] to find him
[1:18:29] come on now hey man I I can take you to
[1:18:32] several examples but I'll give you one
[1:18:33] quick one there's a man sitting on the
[1:18:35] porch at 75 years old remember brother
[1:18:37] man come up want to go squirrel hunting
[1:18:39] amen and the man got to talking to him
[1:18:41] he said you preachers barking up the
[1:18:42] wrong tree he said I've been living here
[1:18:44] 75 years and I've looked in the creek
[1:18:47] looked in the woods been on the hill I
[1:18:49] ain't see no Jesus here nowhere within
[1:18:51] 15 minutes brother Branham showed him
[1:18:54] Jesus in that tree
[1:18:56] within 15 minutes he taught the man how
[1:19:00] to see the father amen you can see the
[1:19:02] father in the universe you can see him
[1:19:05] in his people you can see him in his
[1:19:07] word you see what it is he taught us how
[1:19:09] to look for him amen and if a man ever
[1:19:12] sees Jesus he'll never be the same again
[1:19:16] oh yes sir if you just look at your
[1:19:19] pastor like a man Samuel Browning you're
[1:19:21] going to look and you're gonna you'll
[1:19:22] have all kinds of thoughts and feelings
[1:19:24] but if you ever look and see a gift of
[1:19:26] God
[1:19:27] if you ever look and see Jesus using
[1:19:29] that man then it'll be a different man
[1:19:31] it'll be a different you it'll be a
[1:19:33] different feeling amen because you have
[1:19:35] seen Jesus do you know the Bible tells
[1:19:37] us that if you would look unto him and
[1:19:39] be saved brother Brown says it like this
[1:19:41] he said the ends of the Earth then the
[1:19:43] Earth has ended before right
[1:19:45] days of Noah didn't the Bible say in the
[1:19:47] days of Noah the Earth perished with
[1:19:49] water
[1:19:49] so the Earth ended
[1:19:51] right at the end of the Earth what
[1:19:53] happened a junction of time brother
[1:19:55] Brown said Enoch was there Noah was
[1:19:58] there Angels were there he said it was a
[1:20:00] season 56 uh Junction time you're gonna
[1:20:03] listen to it he uses the word omnipotent
[1:20:05] and miraculous a bunch in that season he
[1:20:08] said in the junction of time angels will
[1:20:10] appear he said and the omnipotent will
[1:20:13] speak and the miraculous will take place
[1:20:15] in that season see because amen there
[1:20:18] wasn't God didn't walk down among them
[1:20:20] in the days of Noah he gave them a
[1:20:22] revelation
[1:20:23] and they were looking at that Revelation
[1:20:25] at the ends because Noah's message was
[1:20:28] Christ or the salvation of that age that
[1:20:31] was how they were being saved in that
[1:20:33] season was a message now think about
[1:20:36] this amen look unto me and be saved what
[1:20:39] about what about Rahab her her Seasons
[1:20:42] come to an end her Jericho come to an
[1:20:44] end amen but God gave her something to
[1:20:46] look at
[1:20:48] he gave her a message
[1:20:50] from Joshua Joshua himself didn't even
[1:20:53] go there
[1:20:54] she received two men preaching an
[1:20:57] end-time message that God had changed
[1:21:00] the commission from Moses to Joshua
[1:21:03] and she believed them
[1:21:05] amen she'd never seen one Miracle she
[1:21:09] had only heard but she believed what she
[1:21:12] heard
[1:21:13] I think it's powerful amen sometimes you
[1:21:16] just got to believe God
[1:21:18] that's right do you see what she did she
[1:21:21] looked and it brought salvation to her
[1:21:24] now now in the Book of Numbers the Bible
[1:21:26] tells us that it would fire his serpents
[1:21:29] in the days of Moses when the people
[1:21:31] were murmuring and complaining when they
[1:21:33] got their eyes off of God look what
[1:21:36] happened
[1:21:37] they got disgusted with angels food
[1:21:40] can you imagine men have fallen out of
[1:21:42] the heavens having drank water from the
[1:21:45] rock having eat Quail meat that just was
[1:21:47] given to you supernaturally provisions
[1:21:49] and the next thing you know this
[1:21:51] provision amen they begin to murmur and
[1:21:54] complain against God's provision of
[1:21:56] heavenly man isn't it something amen but
[1:21:58] it was testifying the humanity of man it
[1:22:01] was testifying Humanity carnality if you
[1:22:04] stay in a desert long enough you're
[1:22:07] going to have troubles amen humanity is
[1:22:10] going to get at you amen if you start
[1:22:13] drying up problems start coming your way
[1:22:15] amen Little Blessings will come but
[1:22:17] you'll start letting the humanity get
[1:22:19] you now I'm going to tell you something
[1:22:20] I thought was amazing was the Bible said
[1:22:22] amen that when they begin to complain
[1:22:24] and murmur against God God sent fiery
[1:22:26] serpents among them
[1:22:28] right and they begin to bite them if you
[1:22:31] may ever think about this that it was a
[1:22:33] serpent that bit them amen that it was a
[1:22:36] serpent that was biting them amen now
[1:22:38] now I want you to think about this just
[1:22:40] a minute you ain't got to go very far to
[1:22:42] find a serpent
[1:22:44] hey man do you recognize that this old
[1:22:46] this old Flesh on the outside of you
[1:22:48] amen ain't redeemed yet
[1:22:51] do you know Paul said that this is the
[1:22:53] evil one amen that's why he said he's
[1:22:55] always with you brother Brian said it's
[1:22:58] time to separate from taste see feel
[1:23:01] smell here the evil one that's on the
[1:23:04] outside do you see this flesh is a
[1:23:06] hybrid thing it's an unredeemed thing
[1:23:09] and it's dying constantly is that right
[1:23:12] and it'll bite you if you quit looking
[1:23:15] at the cross if you quit looking at the
[1:23:18] things of God this thing starts rising
[1:23:21] up amen do you know Jesus said it he
[1:23:24] said I have power to lay down my life or
[1:23:26] I have power to pick it up again brother
[1:23:29] Brown said what that means is as a Son
[1:23:31] of God either you can lay that sin down
[1:23:33] and leave it in your past or he said you
[1:23:35] can resurrect that thing come on now
[1:23:38] sometimes people are suffering with
[1:23:40] things they're being bit by the lust of
[1:23:43] the flesh now the passions of the flesh
[1:23:45] it's abiding effect upon the serpent
[1:23:48] it's not you see it's the dirt it's the
[1:23:52] dirt of the earth amen amen not that
[1:23:54] when you when you see this I think it's
[1:23:56] amazing because God gave a remedy there
[1:23:59] in numbers he had Moses build a serpent
[1:24:02] and put it on a pole
[1:24:04] now he made that serpent out of brass
[1:24:06] and that's significant
[1:24:08] brother Brown said it was not
[1:24:10] significantly made in other words he
[1:24:12] said it might have just been the brass
[1:24:14] helmet he said of some of some Egyptian
[1:24:17] he said it was just brass because brass
[1:24:20] represents Divine judgment
[1:24:23] he said the stick was something just
[1:24:25] they picked up it was no importance at
[1:24:27] all but it represented a dead stick of
[1:24:30] course dead sticks do you recognize
[1:24:31] you're a human and you're off of the
[1:24:33] tree of life amen and that's death look
[1:24:36] at what this look this stick amen
[1:24:38] represented amen that curse it is he
[1:24:41] that dies on the tree now look this was
[1:24:44] representing the cross in this in this
[1:24:47] brass serpent see what did it mean who
[1:24:49] knows what caused the fall to begin with
[1:24:52] it was a serpent was it not and when God
[1:24:56] judged that serpent it was a Divine
[1:24:58] judgment and he gave the woman seed to
[1:25:01] go on the cross to kill the effects of
[1:25:04] the serpent
[1:25:05] and when Moses brought up the brass
[1:25:07] serpent in the wilderness it was a
[1:25:10] representation that the sin has already
[1:25:12] been judged and who will ever look at
[1:25:15] God's judgment on sin will be delivered
[1:25:19] from the effects and the power of sin
[1:25:21] look how they was delivered they wasn't
[1:25:23] delivered by prayer meetings
[1:25:25] come on they wasn't delivered amen by
[1:25:27] good situations or attendance of church
[1:25:29] or the offering they gave they were
[1:25:32] delivered by focusing their life on the
[1:25:35] Revelation that God had judged sin
[1:25:38] brother when they looked at it they
[1:25:41] could live now in case you think amen
[1:25:43] that God raised up the brass Serpent and
[1:25:46] all the serpents lost their power amen
[1:25:48] he left the fiery serpents in the field
[1:25:50] and put an atonement up to counteract
[1:25:53] the effects is that right then there
[1:25:56] were people out there dying for serpent
[1:25:58] bites and when people dying from The
[1:26:01] Works of the flesh at the same very hour
[1:26:04] there was other people who were feeling
[1:26:06] a victory over the bite of the serpent
[1:26:09] because they were focusing their lives
[1:26:12] on the Revelation that God had judged
[1:26:15] The Serpent and through this atonement I
[1:26:17] will receive my Deliverance do you
[1:26:19] recognize that God in this season has
[1:26:22] given you something to look at he's
[1:26:24] given you the word of God in this season
[1:26:27] you see what the word is in this season
[1:26:29] it is a commandment to you or a sign to
[1:26:32] you sin has already been judged baby
[1:26:36] now we're living after the cross friends
[1:26:39] we're living after the cross you know
[1:26:41] the Bible said if Moses be lifted up the
[1:26:43] serpent in the wilderness even so the
[1:26:45] son of man be lifted up do you know the
[1:26:47] Bible said if he be lifted up he would
[1:26:49] draw all men unto him if we would lift
[1:26:52] him up tonight he would draw men to him
[1:26:54] amen what is it if we would lift up the
[1:26:57] word of God in this season and the power
[1:27:00] of that word amen that it would bring it
[1:27:02] now the problem is there's so many
[1:27:04] distractions problem is there's so much
[1:27:07] trouble there's so many distractions
[1:27:09] Satan is doing everything he can to
[1:27:11] distract the church amen and and the
[1:27:14] thing is that I believe that we need to
[1:27:16] refocus our Visions we need to refocus
[1:27:20] our minds we need to refocus our life
[1:27:22] you know I do a little bit of hunting
[1:27:24] now and then so when brother Brown says
[1:27:26] things on tape I get it and he says you
[1:27:28] know he says he said one day me and
[1:27:30] Billy Paul was standing we was looking
[1:27:31] out in the field and he said it was an
[1:27:32] antelope out there and he handed me a
[1:27:34] pair of glasses he said here Dad look
[1:27:36] through these
[1:27:37] and it was supposed to magnify what they
[1:27:40] were seeing he said but when I look
[1:27:42] through those glasses there was ten of
[1:27:44] them out there
[1:27:45] amen when you look through those glasses
[1:27:47] there were 10 of them out there he said
[1:27:50] but I knew in my mind there was only one
[1:27:53] he said so what I've done is I focused
[1:27:56] the glass until it matched what I knew
[1:27:59] to be the truth
[1:28:00] oh come on now do you see amen you can
[1:28:03] take ideas and doctrines of man and look
[1:28:07] through those at something and it'll
[1:28:10] change what you know it is you can know
[1:28:13] it is a certain thing you can know it's
[1:28:16] absolutely truth but somebody say well
[1:28:18] what about this how about this some and
[1:28:20] then they do you you see Focus can let
[1:28:22] me just put it like this they can take
[1:28:24] one God in the Bible and make him three
[1:28:26] to you if you look through their
[1:28:27] theology
[1:28:30] they can take things that are exactly
[1:28:32] clear in the vision but if you take
[1:28:35] their glasses it will distort what you
[1:28:38] know is really there so what you have to
[1:28:41] do is you have to focus the vision to
[1:28:44] match what you know to be the truth is
[1:28:46] remember when Moses is looking at the
[1:28:48] children of Israel when they're in Egypt
[1:28:49] amen now through Pharaoh's eyes they
[1:28:52] were slaves through Pharaoh's Focus look
[1:28:55] at what they were but when Moses started
[1:28:57] looking at them through a promise of
[1:28:59] Abraham they changed from slaves to
[1:29:03] Children Of Promise they changed from
[1:29:06] mud daubers to the Sons and Daughters of
[1:29:09] Abraham who were on the brink of
[1:29:11] Deliverance now if you're looking at the
[1:29:13] church Through The Eyes of pharaoh
[1:29:15] Through The Eyes of Egypt amen you see a
[1:29:18] bunch of miserable Fanatics you see
[1:29:20] people that looks like they're throwing
[1:29:22] their lives away but if you ever take
[1:29:24] the word of God and begin to focus down
[1:29:27] on the season you're living in you'll
[1:29:29] see some something different than you've
[1:29:31] ever saw you'll see the real truth the
[1:29:34] real children of God now here's the
[1:29:36] thing some people do not have the
[1:29:38] potential of focus
[1:29:40] some people's eyes are fixed
[1:29:43] and they don't have that little knob
[1:29:46] where they can focus it
[1:29:49] amen it's fixed a certain way and that's
[1:29:51] the only way they can see things
[1:29:54] but as the bride of Christ
[1:29:57] God put a focus button in you
[1:30:01] that if you will take the promised word
[1:30:04] and begin to look at it it will
[1:30:07] automatically adjust your vision to the
[1:30:10] promise that God has given in this
[1:30:12] season I'll tell you what a powerful
[1:30:14] thing that God adjusts you when you
[1:30:16] begin to look I I have several things
[1:30:18] brother M said about it but we'll just
[1:30:20] move on a little bit amen but I'll say
[1:30:22] this that when the focus of the word
[1:30:24] that's what will change you more than
[1:30:26] anything that you know of
[1:30:28] when you begin to focus in this word do
[1:30:31] you know that the thing to do in this
[1:30:33] season is the word itself amen is what's
[1:30:36] going to present to us rapturing faith
[1:30:40] the Vindicated word is what brings
[1:30:42] rapturing Faith it's what gives us
[1:30:46] identification of the presence of God do
[1:30:49] you know how to identify as presence
[1:30:51] brother Graham said you recognize his
[1:30:52] presence
[1:30:53] when the promised word for the age is
[1:30:55] manifested not the promised word of
[1:30:58] Moses or another age but the promised
[1:31:00] word of this age
[1:31:02] then you can recognize the presence of
[1:31:04] God when you start looking at the
[1:31:06] Vindicated word something must strike
[1:31:09] you he's here
[1:31:10] he's here in this place he's here in
[1:31:12] this room he's here in our hearts he is
[1:31:15] here Jesus promised to meet us in this
[1:31:19] place
[1:31:19] he promised to meet us in this
[1:31:22] Vindicated word then God is here tonight
[1:31:25] in this church
[1:31:28] you know if your eyes would come open
[1:31:30] just for a moment if your focus would
[1:31:33] change from the room from the situation
[1:31:35] from the problems of your life and you
[1:31:38] just for a moment begin to focus on a
[1:31:40] reality that Jesus is in this building
[1:31:42] right now it will change you it will
[1:31:45] change the way you're feeling right in
[1:31:47] this very moment if you could catch the
[1:31:49] Revelation that this place is full of
[1:31:52] the angels of God the Chariots of Fire
[1:31:55] are flying back and forth through this
[1:31:57] room the power of God is rolling down
[1:32:00] through here there's ways of the Waters
[1:32:03] of Revival that's pouring out of
[1:32:06] immortality splashing in to humanity
[1:32:09] tonight wave us your way to the power of
[1:32:11] God is falling in this room amen and if
[1:32:14] our spiritual conscience could just
[1:32:16] begin to focus on it Lord You're Here
[1:32:19] Lord your power is here you're here in
[1:32:21] reality then we begin to worship and we
[1:32:24] begin to worship something begins to
[1:32:26] release and the release of our marks
[1:32:28] begin to build a faith and Revival in
[1:32:31] our lives look what it is amen this
[1:32:34] message itself this message itself
[1:32:36] brings something for us to focus amen
[1:32:39] it'll bring rapturing Faith
[1:32:42] you know brother Mann tells us this he
[1:32:45] tells us in the message Look Away to
[1:32:46] Jesus I think it's a powerful Point Look
[1:32:49] Away to Jesus brother bam actually tells
[1:32:51] us of five manifestations of the third
[1:32:54] pull
[1:32:55] five manifestations of the third pull
[1:32:57] and he waves them
[1:32:59] in front of the people
[1:33:02] you know brother Ram was not a
[1:33:03] braggadocious man
[1:33:05] he wasn't one to brag so if he told us
[1:33:08] something he knew it would have a
[1:33:10] certain effect on the church he told us
[1:33:13] for the effect that it would have on the
[1:33:16] seed that's in your life do you see as
[1:33:18] long as it's in the Bible amen it can be
[1:33:21] questioned but when it becomes a reality
[1:33:23] it becomes a light to the hearer of that
[1:33:26] word look at look at the story he goes
[1:33:29] in the woods in Mark 11. remember and he
[1:33:31] creates a squirrel by Mark 11 if you say
[1:33:34] unto this mountain now you could ask for
[1:33:36] years what does it mean if you say unto
[1:33:38] this mountain what does that mean but
[1:33:40] when brother Adam was in the woods what
[1:33:41] it meant was that God had creative power
[1:33:44] that could be spoken through the lips of
[1:33:47] a man or a woman and when he spoke that
[1:33:50] word it was the light of Mark 11 the
[1:33:53] 23rd chapter 24th chapter right now he
[1:33:57] takes that and goes back to Hattie
[1:33:59] Wright's house and he brings that light
[1:34:02] over how do you write and while that
[1:34:05] light is shining on her there is
[1:34:07] something in her heart that agrees with
[1:34:10] that word and what he then it brought
[1:34:13] her up into her potential while she's
[1:34:17] hearing that message of how God created
[1:34:20] that amen there is a potential in her if
[1:34:24] you say unto this mountain be thou moved
[1:34:26] this shall be as you have said brother
[1:34:28] man said it's the first time that the
[1:34:31] third Pope ever was acted on human being
[1:34:33] he said when Hattie heard that remember
[1:34:35] she said it's nothing but the truth and
[1:34:38] when she said that's nothing but the
[1:34:40] truth brother Brian said it opened
[1:34:42] something up
[1:34:44] he said a greater anointing came on me
[1:34:47] than when I spoke the squirrel into
[1:34:49] existence it was an increase of
[1:34:52] anointing when the light struck the
[1:34:55] bright seed it was a union a man between
[1:34:58] the bride and the manifested word and it
[1:35:01] made an explosion in that life do you
[1:35:04] know some tonight church amen this
[1:35:06] message of the hour is not powerful
[1:35:10] until he gets into a Believer but when
[1:35:13] it comes into a believer's life it has
[1:35:16] the power to manifest itself in such a
[1:35:19] way that it'll shake the boots off of
[1:35:22] the devil amen I tell you what it is
[1:35:24] it's a manifesting power it'll take and
[1:35:26] change your life it'll change everything
[1:35:28] around you Satan ain't scared he's
[1:35:31] scared of us just shouting he ain't
[1:35:33] scared of a little emotion but what he's
[1:35:35] scared of is the stimulation of this
[1:35:37] Revelation that breaks in the heart of a
[1:35:39] believer in this season because it's
[1:35:42] power it's manifesting power hour how's
[1:35:45] caddy right about that power when her
[1:35:48] sons fell under that what about the
[1:35:49] tumor on sister meeting when the spoken
[1:35:52] word the tumor left her what about the
[1:35:54] resurrection of the little fish there's
[1:35:56] things to learn and all these if you
[1:35:57] focus just a little while when God
[1:35:59] resurrects a little fish by the spoken
[1:36:01] word well the man said look at how many
[1:36:03] people could he use that spoken word
[1:36:05] look at how many situations could have
[1:36:07] used it he said that God used it on a
[1:36:10] little fish he said to tell you that
[1:36:13] nothing is too little
[1:36:15] there ain't nothing too insignificant
[1:36:18] that God don't know about it that this
[1:36:20] word will not affect it'll affect
[1:36:23] everything in your life your fish and
[1:36:25] trips your hunting trips amen how you
[1:36:27] live how you talk how you walk what you
[1:36:30] do it's the light of the age manifesting
[1:36:33] on the Church of the Living God Amen
[1:36:35] I'll tell you what it'll do it'll change
[1:36:37] and I know people say well you can only
[1:36:38] have third pull if it happens in church
[1:36:40] but that's not true amen most of these
[1:36:42] manifestations did not happen in church
[1:36:45] because it's representing a life of an
[1:36:48] individual that lives every day for God
[1:36:50] look at brother Branham in the Woods
[1:36:52] fishing here he is in the woods in in
[1:36:54] hunting when the storm comes on the
[1:36:57] mountain and he speaks the word of God
[1:36:59] Amen and the storm has to go back where
[1:37:01] it came from because the word was spoken
[1:37:05] now listen amen if the devil can
[1:37:07] distract you from that then whatever
[1:37:09] storms you're experiencing that's just
[1:37:12] what you're stuck with
[1:37:14] but if you can focus on that story a
[1:37:16] little while amen then you start to
[1:37:18] believe something you start to believe
[1:37:20] that storms can change
[1:37:22] you start to believe that God can use
[1:37:25] the spoken word and change situations
[1:37:27] and I'm just one believer here tonight
[1:37:29] that believes amen that a man or a woman
[1:37:32] could be going through the greatest
[1:37:33] storms of their life but by the power of
[1:37:36] the spoken word they can drive back that
[1:37:39] storm and tell the sun to shine in the
[1:37:42] middle of their troubles I believe that
[1:37:44] amen that when this bride begins to
[1:37:46] focus on this word amen that things
[1:37:48] begin to change
[1:37:50] situations begin to change the way you
[1:37:53] feel about your everyday life begins to
[1:37:56] change if you just keep looking things
[1:37:58] will change amen I know I know I can sit
[1:38:02] here tonight and tell you we're in
[1:38:03] Revival we're in Revival and you may be
[1:38:05] the coolest you've ever been in your
[1:38:07] life you may not see nothing I'm talking
[1:38:09] about remember I'm prophesying I'm
[1:38:12] telling you by the word the bride's
[1:38:14] Revival we are in the middle of it
[1:38:16] whether it's affecting you or not is one
[1:38:19] thing but whether it's happening is
[1:38:21] another and brother let me tell you thus
[1:38:23] saith the Lord the move is on for the
[1:38:26] bride of Christ amen you might be
[1:38:28] missing it you might be sitting on the
[1:38:30] sidelines of it and somebody through
[1:38:32] theology has told you it's coming
[1:38:34] someday or this is going to happen or
[1:38:36] this is going to happen and it's changed
[1:38:38] the focus of what you're seeing but if
[1:38:41] you'll just keep looking at the promise
[1:38:43] after a while you will begin to adjust
[1:38:46] and see that this is a season like no
[1:38:49] other season the world is falling apart
[1:38:52] and the bride is standing stronger than
[1:38:55] it ever has
[1:38:57] here we are on a Saturday night and
[1:39:00] believe him and the power of God is in
[1:39:02] the church because it is the season of
[1:39:05] it it is the Revival of it I know I can
[1:39:08] tell you it's here amen but listen you
[1:39:10] got to keep looking because if you know
[1:39:12] it's here amen if you know it's here you
[1:39:14] keep looking till you get it yourself
[1:39:16] you'll keep looking if you're sure what
[1:39:19] you're hearing and saying it's here amen
[1:39:21] I'll use this example brother Adam used
[1:39:23] it he said oh Elijah remember Elijah
[1:39:26] went up on the mountain and sat down
[1:39:27] after fighting with Jezebel he said that
[1:39:29] he was so weary and tired and old that
[1:39:32] he put his head on his knees he said in
[1:39:35] his weariness and he just sat there with
[1:39:37] his head on his knees he said but he had
[1:39:39] prophesied rain
[1:39:41] he had set rain's going to come he said
[1:39:44] your rain's going to come he prophesied
[1:39:47] it was going to be there but gehaza was
[1:39:49] with him and heard the prophecy and he
[1:39:52] said to gehaza go look a Hazel go look
[1:39:55] and gehazi comes back and he says I
[1:39:57] didn't see nothing amen and Elijah said
[1:40:00] I'm telling you rain is coming and he
[1:40:03] went back he said I didn't see nothing
[1:40:04] and you know what Elijah wouldn't let
[1:40:06] him do Elijah would not let him stop
[1:40:09] looking until his Focus caught what God
[1:40:13] was doing in that very hour and when he
[1:40:15] finally saw it
[1:40:18] finally saw it he'd come running back he
[1:40:21] said I seen the cloud the size of a
[1:40:23] man's hand he didn't see a thunderstorm
[1:40:26] he didn't feel the rain but when Elijah
[1:40:29] saw a cloud the size of a man's head he
[1:40:32] said that's the rain I've been looking
[1:40:34] for good church think about it many amen
[1:40:37] it was a Vindication that his prophecy
[1:40:40] was true and he kept looking until he
[1:40:43] saw God in the moving of the word and
[1:40:46] when he saw it brother Braham said his
[1:40:48] sure revived his old heart he said he
[1:40:51] jumped up from where he was sitting he
[1:40:52] said and he must have been renewed
[1:40:54] because he outrun the Chariots onto the
[1:40:58] house of Jezreel and when he come
[1:41:00] running down the hill he come running in
[1:41:02] the middle of a cloudless day in the
[1:41:04] middle of a bright sunny sky and he's
[1:41:07] screaming get out the rain barrels get
[1:41:10] out the rain barrels I hear the sound of
[1:41:13] the abundance of rain he was announcing
[1:41:16] Rain by out oh come on Church we've had
[1:41:20] a cloud appear out here on Sunset we had
[1:41:23] a cloud come down in the evening time it
[1:41:26] shall be light and in Sunset mountains
[1:41:29] and in the evening time come the light
[1:41:31] of the son of man and when I see it I
[1:41:34] see both former in light of rain I hear
[1:41:37] the abundance of the revelation of the
[1:41:39] word of God and the season that I'm
[1:41:41] living in listen that word has struck
[1:41:44] this earth now it matters amen how it
[1:41:47] strikes you

[1:43:12] emotion I'm not I'm not a preacher that
[1:43:15] preaches emotion I preach the word and
[1:43:17] the word ought to bring an emotion the
[1:43:19] word should stimulate something on the
[1:43:22] inside of you come on Church we've been
[1:43:24] taught by a message that what happened
[1:43:26] on the day of Pentecost was not an
[1:43:29] outpouring of emotion it was an
[1:43:31] outpouring of the promises of God and
[1:43:33] when the word came in there Jay ran oh
[1:43:36] Apostle Peter stood up and said this is
[1:43:38] that that Joel prophesied should come
[1:43:41] I'll pour out my spirit saith the Lord
[1:43:43] well I'll tell you what if you've heard
[1:43:45] about a bride's Revival I'm telling you
[1:43:47] this is that you've always wondered what
[1:43:50] that is this is that it's the thing that
[1:43:54] will make you survive the darkest of all
[1:43:57] ages it's the thing that'll make you
[1:43:59] survive the coldness of laodicea and all
[1:44:02] this all this covet nonsense amen but
[1:44:05] there's a bride who has still got lies
[1:44:09] in her are still a shout in her a still
[1:44:12] a rejoicing in her because her focus is
[1:44:16] on the word of God you know hey man I
[1:44:20] tell you what amen I I I I just love it
[1:44:23] when you start looking at these things
[1:44:24] Amen brother man said he accepted it
[1:44:26] that's why that's what ex that's what
[1:44:28] made Elijah that's what made Elijah
[1:44:30] excited when he accepted the cloud as
[1:44:33] the rain
[1:44:35] when you accept the message as Zechariah
[1:44:38] 14 that's when stimulating power comes
[1:44:41] amen when you accept the message as
[1:44:44] Revelations 10 as when you accepted his
[1:44:47] surprise Revival amen then it will
[1:44:49] affect you in such a stimulating power
[1:44:52] you can say this is that that job
[1:44:55] prophesied amen you can look and say
[1:44:58] this day this scripture is fulfilled in
[1:45:01] our midst then we know God has spoken
[1:45:04] then we know there's a land somewhere
[1:45:06] beyond this land
[1:45:08] come on Church your people here tonight
[1:45:10] that you've had so many evidences and
[1:45:12] Witnesses of that other land
[1:45:16] now you all know that brother Brown said
[1:45:20] wine is stimulating power
[1:45:23] right and according to acts the Bible
[1:45:26] said of refreshing shall come from the
[1:45:28] presence of God which is a bride's
[1:45:30] Revival a refilling to the Holy Ghost
[1:45:32] the Dynamics in the church that is
[1:45:35] supposed to come in the last day and
[1:45:37] when you realize that this message is
[1:45:39] fulfilling that it will bring a
[1:45:41] stimulating power into you the way it
[1:45:43] did in the upper room when those men
[1:45:46] recognize this is the promise of the
[1:45:48] hour and it's manifesting in my life
[1:45:51] look now what they did they left there
[1:45:53] with an Evidence of the promises of God
[1:45:55] didn't they not everybody entered the
[1:45:57] land but they entered that land and you
[1:46:00] know that brother bam types that back
[1:46:02] there when the children of Israel it was
[1:46:04] at kadus barnia and he said there was
[1:46:07] there was 12 of them went over he said
[1:46:09] and 10 of them come back with a negative
[1:46:11] report
[1:46:13] amen they were looking at the promises
[1:46:16] of Abraham 400 years past they have been
[1:46:20] delivered under a mosaic prophecy they
[1:46:23] had been seeing the pillar of fire
[1:46:25] they'd had the Red Sea open they had to
[1:46:27] eat of the Manna they had tasted of the
[1:46:29] water and they were looking at the lands
[1:46:32] of promise but there were some Giants in
[1:46:34] there and they lost their focus of the
[1:46:37] promises and they started looking at
[1:46:40] Giants and they came back with a
[1:46:42] testimony we are a bunch of grasshoppers
[1:46:45] well let me tell you they wasn't
[1:46:46] grasshoppers they were the Seed of
[1:46:49] Abraham they were the promised children
[1:46:51] of almighty God and if they wouldn't
[1:46:53] have lost focus of that brother they
[1:46:55] were giant slayers
[1:46:57] my goodness I I told the church the
[1:46:59] other night I'm about to I'm about to
[1:47:01] preach a message entitled Giants and
[1:47:03] milk and honey
[1:47:04] milk milk honey and Giants
[1:47:07] it was all in that land you know what
[1:47:09] brother man said them Giants were he
[1:47:11] said it's when you go and say God has
[1:47:14] healed me he said you've got to face
[1:47:17] Giants of knowing somebody else claimed
[1:47:19] the same thing and they died
[1:47:22] he said the land is Flowing with
[1:47:24] evidence of milk and honey there's
[1:47:26] plenty of people that have claimed their
[1:47:27] healing and lived there's plenty of
[1:47:30] people that has been healed but if you
[1:47:32] focus on the giant amen then you will
[1:47:34] become incapable of possessing the land
[1:47:37] somebody claimed they had the Holy Ghost
[1:47:39] and they backslid if that's your focus
[1:47:41] then you're going to sit and look at the
[1:47:43] evidences of all the Sons and Daughters
[1:47:46] of God that are true
[1:47:48] you see then you focus on the Giants
[1:47:50] amen but there were two of them Joshua
[1:47:52] and Caleb and they come back with some
[1:47:54] milk and honey and remember when they
[1:47:56] brought that milk and honey back amen
[1:47:58] what they did was they focused on the
[1:48:00] evidence of the land Amen Let me give
[1:48:03] you a quote brother Adam said this
[1:48:04] Vindicated word is the evidence
[1:48:08] this Vindicated word is the evidence of
[1:48:12] that other land amen and if you focus on
[1:48:15] the Giants and not the evidence amen
[1:48:18] then you lose your position with God and
[1:48:21] you lose who you are and you become a
[1:48:23] layout to sin and you're right you're no
[1:48:26] match for the devil but as the son of
[1:48:28] Abraham
[1:48:29] amen we are more than able to take this
[1:48:32] land and every promise of God that has
[1:48:35] been given to us we're more than able I
[1:48:38] was listened to the message the other
[1:48:39] day brother man we've got to preaching
[1:48:41] about this milk and honey I think it's
[1:48:42] powerful he said this whole milk and
[1:48:44] honey he said they said I'll tell you
[1:48:45] what it was he said that'd make a good
[1:48:47] Pentecostal cocktail
[1:48:50] that's pretty good quote isn't it it'll
[1:48:52] make a Pentecostal cocktail so what are
[1:48:54] you talking about brother Wayne I'm
[1:48:56] talking about that they would stimulate
[1:48:58] themselves with the power of taking that
[1:49:00] other Land by drinking of the milk and
[1:49:03] honey by taking of the evidence it would
[1:49:06] bring a cocktail in them that would make
[1:49:08] them believe hey man can I come put it
[1:49:10] in natural terms when people drink
[1:49:12] cocktails they go in the world they
[1:49:13] drink a cocktail they get six foot tall
[1:49:15] and bulletproof we call it amen in other
[1:49:17] words they become invincible and then
[1:49:19] they'll fight anybody say anything
[1:49:21] become bold become careless because of
[1:49:24] what they're drinking on and brother
[1:49:25] Brown said see the milk and honey that
[1:49:28] they brought back is a Pentecostal
[1:49:30] cocktail if you want to get drunk and
[1:49:33] and you want to express yourself in God
[1:49:35] just drink of the word of God until the
[1:49:38] blessings of God flows out in you
[1:49:41] [Applause]
[1:49:43] brother brother tonight I believe that
[1:49:46] the Church of the Living God ought to
[1:49:47] have plenty to drink
[1:49:49] I don't think we ought to just be a
[1:49:51] little Saturday night a social Drinker I
[1:49:54] believe we ought to just get slapped
[1:49:56] drunk in the Holy Ghost hey man somebody
[1:49:58] told me here a while back they said
[1:50:00] brother Wayne amen amen they said
[1:50:02] something about me and all the enjoyment

[1:50:13] amen that in the days of Paul they were
[1:50:15] addicted to the ministry did you ever
[1:50:17] read that they were addicted to the word
[1:50:19] of God in other words brother William
[1:50:20] said we don't get our entertainment at
[1:50:22] picture shows we don't get our
[1:50:23] entertainment at the dance halls we get
[1:50:26] our entertainment when we come to the
[1:50:28] house of God and we drink a Pentecostal
[1:50:30] cocktail and the power of God falls in
[1:50:33] the room amen I tell you devils are
[1:50:35] slain hey can I say something to y'all
[1:50:37] tonight I believe we're more than able
[1:50:39] to do this I believe we're able to take
[1:50:41] this land I believe we're able to slay
[1:50:43] Giants I believe we're able to rise
[1:50:45] above every devil I believe we can have
[1:50:48] church in the middle of our trials we
[1:50:50] can oh I'll believe it now
[1:50:53] what am I talking about I'm talking
[1:50:55] about getting drunk It's a preacher I
[1:50:56] don't think we ought to get drunk but
[1:50:58] the man said we should amen not on the
[1:51:00] natural wine but on the new wine
[1:51:03] is that what he said y'all remember it
[1:51:05] he said same tape he he actually said
[1:51:07] this he said you know he said the other
[1:51:09] day they went down there he said it got
[1:51:11] real cold he said and there was an old
[1:51:13] drunk passed out out there in the street
[1:51:14] he said they picked him up the next
[1:51:16] morning he said they thought for sure
[1:51:17] probably had hypothermia they took him
[1:51:19] back down to the Salvation Army he said
[1:51:21] they cleaned him up and gave him bad put
[1:51:22] clothes on him brother Brown said they
[1:51:24] asked said well ain't you going to take
[1:51:25] him to the hospital somebody said oh no
[1:51:27] we no need to take that man to the
[1:51:29] hospital they said well it was it was
[1:51:30] blow freezing out there last night
[1:51:32] surely got hypothermia they said no no
[1:51:34] he had so much whiskey in his blood he
[1:51:37] said you could never freeze that man to
[1:51:38] death his his blood was full amen of
[1:51:41] intoxicating power and brother man said
[1:51:44] it like this he said I believe the
[1:51:45] church ought to get drunk enough until
[1:51:47] their blood gets full amen of that new
[1:51:50] wine is that right until the coldness of
[1:51:53] laodicea can't affect you I believe we
[1:51:56] ought to get drunk on the spirit of God
[1:51:58] and can we lose the cares of our life
[1:52:00] I'm on church this is your Revival this
[1:52:04] is your time this is for your
[1:52:07] refreshment and enjoyment
[1:52:12] what a season
[1:52:15] what an hour
[1:52:16] Amen to partake
[1:52:19] of the Vindicated word in the age you're
[1:52:23] living in
[1:52:24] if we would just look
[1:52:27] it would be changed tonight
[1:52:30] one look at it
[1:52:32] unveiled
[1:52:33] and you'll be changed
[1:52:36] it'll change you
[1:52:38] said well the way I looked at it 20
[1:52:39] years ago but do you notice the way Paul
[1:52:41] says it
[1:52:42] he said beholding him
[1:52:45] Amen in other words continually
[1:52:48] just take a look and keep looking
[1:52:50] just keep your eyes on it
[1:52:52] and Satan will lose his power
[1:52:55] just keep looking
[1:52:57] lose its power
[1:53:00] just keep looking
[1:53:02] you'll see it it's there
[1:53:05] it's here tonight
[1:53:07] it's here tonight
[1:53:09] amen
[1:53:11] amen if you just stand with me tonight
[1:53:12] as your musicians come
[1:53:16] I believe Lord look away
[1:53:22] well look away
[1:53:25] and thank God there's something to look
[1:53:27] at tonight
[1:53:30] how many of you heard brother man said
[1:53:32] he said Satan point out every old
[1:53:34] hypocrite in church
[1:53:38] every failure Satan pointed out
[1:53:44] so either you're going to live with
[1:53:45] strength
[1:53:46] are you going to live defeated
[1:53:49] and the difference is is what you're
[1:53:50] going to look at
[1:53:55] what you're going to look at
[1:53:57] if you look and live
[1:53:59] then you got to look you got to look
[1:54:01] toward that word
[1:54:03] and when you see that word you'll see
[1:54:04] the serpent on the pole
[1:54:08] you'll see your sins already been judged
[1:54:10] you see the power of the blood you'll
[1:54:11] see it
[1:54:13] you'll see what the blood did for you
[1:54:15] so how in the world brother Brown
[1:54:17] creating squirrels how is that going to
[1:54:19] help me see
[1:54:22] William Branham can't create squirrels
[1:54:25] God had to do that
[1:54:28] so what he was showing you by that was
[1:54:30] that the blood is so powerful
[1:54:33] that was able to dismiss a man's sin to
[1:54:36] the extent
[1:54:37] that he could create by the word
[1:54:41] but if God did that for one man
[1:54:45] is he a respecter of person
[1:54:48] has he changed
[1:54:50] then whatever God did he will do
[1:54:53] he remains the same yesterday
[1:54:56] today and forever I don't know about you
[1:54:58] all tonight
[1:55:00] but I'd like to adjust my focus
[1:55:05] just just adjust it thank God you got
[1:55:07] the potential to do it
[1:55:11] if you get to looking at the failures
[1:55:12] and looking at the world looking at the
[1:55:14] problems looking at the if that's where
[1:55:16] you're looking
[1:55:20] then the discouragement will swallow
[1:55:22] your victory
[1:55:24] it'll take all the victory out of your
[1:55:26] life
[1:55:29] but if you look at the word
[1:55:32] then Victory will swallow the
[1:55:34] discouragement
[1:55:36] if you can look tonight you see he's got
[1:55:38] his hands lifted in Victory for you
[1:55:39] tonight
[1:55:40] he's got his hands lifted the serpents
[1:55:42] on the pole
[1:55:43] life
[1:55:45] has been given to the church
[1:55:48] it's in your potential tonight let's
[1:55:49] just buy our hearts together
[1:55:51] gracious Lord

[1:56:42] maybe some come in here tonight they're
[1:56:44] discouraged Lord situations in their
[1:56:46] lives and problems are rising but
[1:56:50] father tonight
[1:56:53] your Prophet said that a bird
[1:56:55] could be caught with the mouth of a
[1:56:57] serpent if it would paralyze it where it
[1:56:59] couldn't fly
[1:57:01] but oh if that bird could just look away
[1:57:05] it would break the spell
[1:57:07] now I pray tonight you break the spell

[1:57:14] Believer got him looking the wrong way I

[2:03:12] to me
[2:03:14] [Music]
[2:03:19] how many appreciate the word of the Lord
[2:03:22] tonight
[2:03:24] amen
[2:03:26] amen we've come
[2:03:30] we've come to be admonished
[2:03:33] come to be strengthened and edified in
[2:03:35] the word of God
[2:03:37] and how brother Brandon would put it so
[2:03:39] clearly that real spiritual edification
[2:03:41] is the holy ghost coming into the church
[2:03:45] and taking that word and is the word
[2:03:47] itself is going forth It's the word that
[2:03:50] really brings true edification
[2:03:52] everything else outside of that is
[2:03:55] it's nothing it'll it'll leave so
[2:03:58] quickly but the word is what brings real
[2:04:01] growth and real building in our lives
[2:04:04] you know some of the things and you you
[2:04:05] think about it how the Holy Spirit took
[2:04:07] it here tonight in such a way
[2:04:09] I say it like this I don't have many
[2:04:12] other ways to say things sometimes but
[2:04:15] to me God made it so simple that you
[2:04:17] could put in your lunchbox
[2:04:19] and you take it with you because that's
[2:04:21] what this message is all about
[2:04:24] it's about reproducing deity
[2:04:27] in flesh
[2:04:29] because that pre-prepared ground that's
[2:04:32] that seed
[2:04:34] that's the womb that's the place that
[2:04:36] brother Ram says is the temple that's
[2:04:38] made without hands
[2:04:40] that you and I couldn't even receive God
[2:04:42] says God releases the faith to you and I
[2:04:45] and then it's God's faith in us
[2:04:47] receiving himself
[2:04:49] into his place
[2:04:51] in our lives
[2:04:53] what more can you and I what can we say
[2:04:57] but it's the grace of God
[2:05:00] the things that God would make so clear
[2:05:03] to us in this time the powers brother
[2:05:06] Wayne was saying that I would just
[2:05:07] matter of fact I was over here earlier
[2:05:09] today right standing right down in the
[2:05:11] middle of the aisle and those are the
[2:05:12] very words that I echoed right out in
[2:05:14] prayer is God the power of this
[2:05:17] revelation of election operating in our
[2:05:21] hearts and lives it's it's liberating
[2:05:25] when the word of God comes into our
[2:05:28] lives it liberates
[2:05:31] you you know you can a person can sense
[2:05:34] that an individual we can sense in this
[2:05:36] atmosphere it's a liberty and there
[2:05:38] should be Liberty in the house of God
[2:05:40] but that same Liberty of the presence of
[2:05:43] God that we feel here it's a liberty
[2:05:44] where it if you have something you're
[2:05:48] able to take it and lay it down that's
[2:05:49] what the Liberty in the house of God
[2:05:51] brings then you can walk on into that
[2:05:54] Liberty and have that Liberty every
[2:05:57] moment of your life
[2:06:00] that's what this message has come to do
[2:06:04] amen I I'll tell you I I just thank God
[2:06:07] I I just say Amen to it I believe that
[2:06:10] with all my heart I know it to be the
[2:06:12] truth I'm a witness of it how many are
[2:06:14] witnesses I'm a witness of this I'm not
[2:06:17] looking for the path of Glory back into
[2:06:20] sonship to come this message is the
[2:06:23] revealed path back into sonship amen it
[2:06:27] is this word that has taken us Beyond
[2:06:29] the Veil into the place of adoption
[2:06:31] this is where we're standing tonight in
[2:06:33] this hour it becomes more and more clear
[2:06:36] the further up the road we get it
[2:06:38] becomes more clear the things that
[2:06:40] brother Brandon would bring out and say
[2:06:42] right from the scripture that if you
[2:06:44] weren't the word in the beginning
[2:06:46] you can never be the word now
[2:06:49] but because you were the word in the
[2:06:51] beginning
[2:06:52] then in the presence of every other king
[2:06:55] because there's a lot of powers right
[2:06:56] now
[2:06:57] there's a king of Sodom King a lady
[2:06:59] you'll see all other kings but Abraham
[2:07:02] never released
[2:07:04] any honor to any of them other kings
[2:07:08] but he caught Melchizedek
[2:07:10] in the midst of all those other kings
[2:07:13] he released all honor to Melchizedek the
[2:07:17] surrendering of his life the paying of
[2:07:19] tribute the tithe the surrendering of
[2:07:21] all and that was represented that was
[2:07:23] prophecy that was a shadow of you and I
[2:07:28] right now
[2:07:29] where we would stand in this hour
[2:07:32] and to recognize its Melchizedek who's
[2:07:36] in our midst
[2:07:38] king of Peace king of righteousness
[2:07:42] I tell you what a privilege we what a
[2:07:45] privileged people
[2:07:47] but you see how how the Holy Spirit
[2:07:49] brought it here tonight in such a way
[2:07:52] that that's Satan's objective is to try
[2:07:55] to get the focus broken
[2:07:58] I tell you I personally believe it like
[2:08:00] this I believe all this stuff with covet
[2:08:02] and everything else I believe it was
[2:08:04] something subtly that came in
[2:08:07] and brought an attack to break the focus
[2:08:10] away from where it needs to be
[2:08:13] if if anybody could just take it in the
[2:08:16] right way and to recognize it's Satan
[2:08:19] trying to take the focus away from the
[2:08:22] Church of the Living God
[2:08:24] trying to infringe upon god-given rights
[2:08:27] that belong to us as the children of God
[2:08:30] but it's not just that Satan can come in
[2:08:32] through family he wants remember he
[2:08:34] rides in innocently on a white horse
[2:08:38] things come in very innocently with the
[2:08:41] objective to know if he can take our
[2:08:43] Focus away
[2:08:45] then he affects the power and the
[2:08:47] victory in our life I don't know about
[2:08:50] you but I believe I'm speaking for all
[2:08:52] of us I don't want to just be
[2:08:54] a surface level Christian
[2:08:58] there's no satisfaction in that I I
[2:09:00] don't I'm not satisfied with that you
[2:09:02] know how it is when there's been a time
[2:09:04] maybe something's come up in your life
[2:09:05] and and there's been things come up and
[2:09:07] I I just say I just need to get alone
[2:09:09] and talk to him you say brother Sammy
[2:09:10] you can pray without ceasing I know that
[2:09:12] but there's times where I say I just
[2:09:15] need to hear from him
[2:09:17] let me tell you let me tell you about
[2:09:19] something that just happened
[2:09:21] last weekend
[2:09:23] you know I was there in in Washington DC
[2:09:26] and the brother dropped me off at the
[2:09:27] hotel we had had fellowship and I I got
[2:09:29] to you know I was having having a little
[2:09:31] bit of problems with my leg and things
[2:09:33] my knee and things had come up from some
[2:09:35] things from the week and I called my
[2:09:38] wife I said I know I need to take a
[2:09:39] little bit of Motrin and you say brother
[2:09:41] Samuel did you pray I did I was
[2:09:42] listening to a message I claimed my
[2:09:44] healing
[2:09:45] so I went over and I thought well
[2:09:47] there's a place out here out front they
[2:09:49] told me I could go order
[2:09:50] some food from I said well I need to go
[2:09:52] I'm gonna go order a little something
[2:09:54] there and so I can take it and take my
[2:09:56] vitamins and everything else so I went
[2:09:58] there well I sat down there and you know
[2:10:00] you have to go order and I'm sitting
[2:10:01] right here at the counter and a fella
[2:10:03] looks over at me and he says hey you
[2:10:05] just passing through I said uh
[2:10:08] no I said yeah I said in one way I am I
[2:10:11] said he said well what are you here for
[2:10:12] I said well I'm here for for a meeting

[2:10:17] tell he was already
[2:10:21] Lord what do I do here do I
[2:10:24] was telling me Lord do you want me to
[2:10:25] say anything or any and he and he found
[2:10:27] out he said oh you're a preacher he said
[2:10:29] well he said I'm just lost as lost can
[2:10:31] be I'm just a lost soul I said you don't
[2:10:33] have to stay that way
[2:10:35] I said that's your choice if you stay
[2:10:38] that way well
[2:10:40] [Music]
[2:10:41] little by little different things and
[2:10:43] that man got so I didn't say nothing
[2:10:45] purposely to rile him up but he got so
[2:10:48] riled up and started
[2:10:51] swearing at me I said sir I did not mean
[2:10:54] to offend you I said but what I am
[2:10:57] telling you is this world will be judged
[2:11:00] by the word of God I said I'm sorry for
[2:11:03] every misrepresentation that you've ever
[2:11:05] had come your way but I am telling you
[2:11:08] that this world and you will be judged
[2:11:11] by this word
[2:11:13] [Music]
[2:11:14] I walked out of there you know how it is
[2:11:16] you get in this situation your spirit's
[2:11:18] all I thought
[2:11:19] I wasn't talking about the man but I
[2:11:21] thought you devil I began to think in my
[2:11:22] mind should I have come over here and
[2:11:23] got anything to eat or not
[2:11:25] I really I mean I began to think about
[2:11:27] that
[2:11:29] because I said I know what I have what
[2:11:31] I'm to minister in the morning
[2:11:34] but I just my mind I'm just telling you
[2:11:36] this by the grace of God I just said in
[2:11:38] my mind
[2:11:39] I got over there the room and I don't
[2:11:42] like eating by myself but you know
[2:11:43] that's what happened that night
[2:11:45] so I got in the room you know sometimes
[2:11:47] we sat down and I thought well I'm just
[2:11:49] going to open up my app from a local
[2:11:52] news right here I write down I said no
[2:11:55] I'm not doing that my spirit is all
[2:11:58] troubled what you do I put on a message
[2:12:01] there were already messages I want to
[2:12:02] list you I just put on a message started
[2:12:04] started eating
[2:12:06] let me tell you something I put on
[2:12:07] message after message that night
[2:12:11] it's just such a piece
[2:12:13] came right in that room it just settled
[2:12:16] it you recognize it was the enemy's
[2:12:19] advancement I didn't mean to take time
[2:12:21] with that but I'm just trying to tell
[2:12:22] you how subtle we know that that Satan
[2:12:26] will try to break our Focus
[2:12:28] but the resource that we have in this
[2:12:30] hour don't don't go anywhere else
[2:12:33] you have we have it on our phones we
[2:12:35] have it we can go and begin to listen to
[2:12:39] the message of the hour
[2:12:40] and the very thing that God spoke in the
[2:12:42] beginning of this thing constantly in
[2:12:44] that word that's where Satan wants to
[2:12:47] try to affect us
[2:12:49] you say there's some things that don't
[2:12:51] make sense to me if you lay in the
[2:12:53] presence of the sun eventually what you
[2:12:55] absorb now becomes light it becomes
[2:12:58] understanding in you God begins to
[2:13:01] connect the dots he's not left it to you
[2:13:02] and I to connect it but if we can just
[2:13:05] stay focused in that word
[2:13:07] and say God if I if I've got out of Step
[2:13:09] a little bit you know all it takes is a
[2:13:10] half step to get right back in step
[2:13:13] it takes a half step get right back in
[2:13:15] step
[2:13:16] I'm thankful to hear the voice of God
[2:13:18] and aren't you glad to have a focus in
[2:13:20] this hour
[2:13:21] little things little things subtly can
[2:13:24] come in
[2:13:25] family on and on and on things that are
[2:13:27] harmless but it's meant to try to take
[2:13:29] our Focus away
[2:13:31] from him in reality we all know
[2:13:34] there's nothing we can do in our own
[2:13:37] strength to address the storm or the
[2:13:40] situation but if we can just rest in him
[2:13:43] then he'll give us the strength not only
[2:13:46] to Wade through that storm but to speak
[2:13:49] to that story
[2:13:51] we'll have authority instead of the
[2:13:52] storm controlling us
[2:13:54] We Now by deity yielding to him he's now
[2:13:59] controlling the storm
[2:14:01] yield to him greater is he
[2:14:04] that is in you
[2:14:05] than he that's in the world
[2:14:08] amen you believe that tonight
[2:14:10] well I'll tell you his his presence is
[2:14:12] here
[2:14:13] [Music]
[2:14:15] he's here
[2:14:16] [Music]
[2:14:17] and let's just bow our heads
[2:14:22] Lord Jesus
[2:14:24] [Music]
[2:14:26] sometimes the Lord
[2:14:29] I don't feel like thank you is enough
[2:14:33] but Lord
[2:14:36] please see beyond the words and I know
[2:14:38] you do into my heart
[2:14:41] to the Heart Lord of your children it's

[2:15:09] would not allow gehaza to rest
[2:15:13] but he kept sending him back
[2:15:16] Lord God

[2:15:24] in this earth
[2:15:27] Lord that that same Holy Spirit that's
[2:15:30] crying out Lord that no matter of every
[2:15:33] obstacle and every unbelief that would
[2:15:35] come but there is a reality Lord that we
[2:15:38] can speak out and we can say and to know
[2:15:41] go look again God we're thankful Lord
[2:15:45] that you continue to reveal and make
[2:15:49] yourself known Lord to lives and hearts
