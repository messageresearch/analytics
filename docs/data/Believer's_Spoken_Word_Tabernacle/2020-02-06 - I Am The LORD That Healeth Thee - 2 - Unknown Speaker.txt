so thankful Amen for that reality amen in our hearts it's so good to be in the house of the Lord tonight god glad that the Lord has made a way for us to be together we just want to go on into the word of the Lord tonight so I want to say thank you musicians they just want to look in just a little something more tonight healing and in the scriptures where we were looking here in Exodus 15 if you'd like to turn back to there and I'm just going to read the last two verses of scripture verse 25 and verse 26 and verse 25 he says and he cried unto the Lord and the Lord showed him a tree which when he had cast into the waters the waters were made sweet there he made for them a statue and an ordinance and there he proved them and said if thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God no remember this tree is a symbol it's a symbol of the atonement the offering of the perfect Lamb of God at Calvary the tree is a symbol then here the Spirit of the Lord brings this reality of what this symbol of what it speaks of in verse 26 if Val wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord that God and will do that which is right in his sight and will give ear to His commandments and keep all his statutes I will put none of these diseases upon thee which I have brought upon the Egyptians now remember those diseases that came upon Egypt were judgments but here's what he says for I am the Lord that healeth fear so to recognize that the word is present the word became flesh and dwelt among us and now that same life coming inside of your eye it brings the word that has been sowed in our life that seed within our life it brings it into an expression just like a seed that would be in a packet of whatever type of a plant you're looking at when rain and Sun comes upon that seed it releases the germ that is already there the rain does not make it a tomato see the rain does the Sun doesn't it the germ those are only the the conditions that release the germ that's already in it and that's why coming into the presence of God does not make you a son and daughter of God it only is through the quickening power that releases that germ of life that was laying there dormant the whole time amen and that's the that's the reality then that God is present within our lives so let's just go here to the Lord in prayer tonight Heavenly Father Lord as we come to you Lord tonight and just so thankful you made a way Lord the roads Lord and some places were good other time others places Lord we're not that good but Lord we're asking tonight that even as we've gathered here Lord that father I thank you for watching over us to be able to be here Lord and we ask that God that you'll watch over us Lord even Lord when it comes time to depart Lord I pray God that you just help those that are working on the roads and I ask God that you'll just Lord move upon that of the roads Lord that each and every one of us Lord the Lord will just make it back to our home safely Lord father we're not worried Lord but we're just asking you Lord that you will go with us and watch over his father we pray we love you Lord and we thank your father so many times we take these things for granted Lord and we ask you forgive us for that Lord and we pray that God that you'll just now come and take your word speak to our hearts Lord for what we have need of in our lives Lord you know and I ask that God that as you've directed me that you'll just so direct me in this moment Lord just to say only Lord what it is that you desire to say to your children tonight and we ask in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen may God bless you as you're being seated I want to go from that portion of the scripture and I want to go into Matthew chapter 8 and I want to continue to look here tonight if the Lord will help us on that thought we were dealing with here last Thursday night on I I am the Lord that healeth thee and I want to continue to dwell on that thought because he is the ever-present God and I'm going probably tonight I may just try to go I want to just lay some things in in a manner of teaching that would not be so deep but it comes down to some things that I feel that it would be helpful to our lives to encourage us and to further balance us not that we're out of balance but it would just I believe it would help us sometimes you you hear these points discussed in in different instances and I want to just lay some of these things and tonight now that he God is he where he was he was present through the prophets he was present among the believers that even in the Old Testament that were walking according to his word God he was present in in Jesus he is present now in the body of believers that he has purchased and redeemed with his own blood he's dwelling now in his people and that is the reality that he is the ever-present God and you know is like you would say in one place in the scriptures in the in the book of Matthew that the Lord was present to heal them and I think it's important that we recognize the Lord he is the one who healeth thee very simple words but it's a reality here that where the Holy Spirit would bring us back into that line to recognize that there is no man that can heal us but it is that must be the Lord Himself God works through divine gifts God works through his body but at all is of the Lord and so you know it's just like brother Branham would say in his ministry brother Branham would say you know even in the first part of the ministry there which was declaring and remember everything was working to a place to where there would come forth a message that was the promised divine healing was that of the bait that were on the hook to get the people's attention of the Living God that was present and you find how that in brother branham's ministry that how that many of them the the very night that where he you know it starts out in his ministry many of those other ministries you find t losberne all the rest of them it all sprung out of that and I want you to think about this how al Osborne would come to brother Branham and he was so impressed by what he saw in that ministry and what he saw was the Living God remember he said do you think God would heal my prayer and brother Branham just said it like this he said he said God will hear anybody's prayer they didn't just say just anybody but he said if you're called to preach the gospel you are commissioned also to pray for the sick and to think of it you know TL I was born in one of these you know sometime the goal and I just you know you you see see him years later you know and he's on an interview and he was talking about he said you know him Pentecost he said we had never seen anything like this he said here we are he said we were used to when it came to Casting out Devils you were stomping and everything else he said but right there he said it was just right there he said it was just leave him Satan and you know what it was is coming back to is that the authority I I've witnessed things even in the casting out of Devils I've witnessed those Devils being stubborn but I will tell you this right now that there's not one devil when a person is willing to confess and they're willing to uncover that no devil can stay there I can tell you that a lot of the wrestling is is getting down to what is it where the enemy has trapped in that heart but as soon as that's exposed that devil has to leave and you see it's like brother BAM says he don't have to obey me but you gotta obey the one I stand for amen and so we find that message it follows divine healing but here when we we recognize that and we come into the scripture and I want to read this portion of Scripture here in Matthew chapter 8 here the Lord Jesus here in the ministry says when he was come down from the mountain great multitudes followed him and behold there came a leper and worshipped him saying lord if thou wilt thou canst make me clean and Jesus put forth his hand and touched him saying I will be thou clean and immediately his leprosy was cleansed and jesus said to him see thou tell no man but go thy way show thyself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded for a testimony unto them and when Jesus was entered into Capernaum there came unto him a cetera and Centurion beseeching him and saying Lord my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy grievously tormented and jesus said to him I will come and heal him and the Centurion answered lord I am not worthy that thou should has come under my roof but Speak the word only and my servant shall be healed now watch what he says here for I am a man under Authority and having soldiers under me I say to this man go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he do with it when Jesus heard it he marvelled and said to them that followed verily I say unto you I have not found so great faith no not in Israel so what's he doing he's commending the faith of that Centurion now we're going to read just a few more scriptures but even and the very first scripture that we read here out of this the leper came and worshiped him and said lord if thou wilt thou canst make me clean and the leper remember says he's a doubt wilt thou canst make me clean what did Jesus do he stretched forth his hand and touched him now I want you to just look at all of it even just in these two instances and we'll just keep reading buddy the Lord that healed the leper it was the Lord that healed the Roman centurions servant 1 hands were laid on the other the word was spoken but irregardless it was the same God performing his word and so now look out here Jesus goes on in verse 13 if let me just move on to that that one and Jesus said unto the Centurion go thy way and as thou hast believed so be it done unto thee and his servant was healed in the selfsame hour and when Jesus was come into Peter's house here comes another and all right just right after this when Jesus comes into Peter's house he saw his his wife's mother laid and sick of a fever and he touched her hand and the fever left her and she arose and ministered unto them when the even was come they brought unto Him many that were possessed with devils and he cast out the spirits with his word and healed all that were sick that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying himself took our infirmities that's our diseases and bare our sicknesses over and over we find that is when we look at this in the message God would bring our attention to these things here in this hour that you know what brother Branham would say said if you said you're gonna go to the doctor and you say to the doctor heal my arm he said the doctor would laugh at you he said because the doctor can heal your arm the Lord does the healing the doctor only sets the bone with the cast but the Lord does the healing so he said healing lll it is as a developing of cells it's a multiplication of cells but the gifts that God sends in the body is to bring the people to a recognition of the presence of Almighty God because we can recognize his presence then what we have need of can be released to you and I that's the purpose is to recognize his presence even like Elijah was with the Gaza thereand Dothan remember brother bream tells us an unveiling of God he said God did not bring the Angels down but he said what God did has changed the seeing of his servant he said the angels were always there and he said so is it the God that always was it's been here the whole time now it's loosening the eyes that we can see that God you see God didn't send a new Bible that's not what the message is it's not another Bible but the message is the inspiration of the Holy Spirit God's thoughts that our eyes have been anointed to be able to see what is in the book and to see our selves and then that right there it will build our faith in what the word has said about us that's perfect faith himself and I love that scripture himself took our infirmities I just I love that scripture it just so grips my heart himself took our infirmities you know it's the same Lord Jesus in his body right here tonight it's the same Lord Jesus in his body tonight remember what Jesus said John 5:19 what a harmony the Sun can do nothing but what do you see if the father doing and that do it the son likewise you see Jesus didn't just go around and just when what we were reading last week scripture after scripture reading that and listen that was two also there's teaching that the Lord is bringing our way on healing but it's also in building our faith there was not one disease not one thing on countless times through the scripture there's not one thing that Jesus left untouched there wasn't one sickness there was an anything could overcome but he himself took our infirmities but listen to me he just fitness we seen last night Jesus did not go around and show off he did not come and let's say you know if brother justwe was sick he did not come over there and say I'm just gonna heal you know it is based not on his faith it's based on brother just raise faith but to see the ministry and that working of that life is to do what bring the individuals personal faith to a level to receive their healing that takes the operation of the Holy Ghost and that's God's desire because remember how we are that sons and daughters of God delivered what love the father hath bestowed on us that we should be called the sons of God so to recognize as a son of God we have been given authority in a domain that domain begins right here in this body Paul would say let every man nota possess his vessel under sanctification and honor when a wrong thought comes your way you have authority to reject it and say you can't resign here when sickness or anything tries to come your way you have a right in the word just stand against that when Satan wants to make an affront and your hope you have authority to say get out you're not welcome here then token is apply to this hole as a son and daughter of God you have a right this is what the word comes to do it comes to empower that son or daughter of God on the inside this is the hour this message that God has brought to us is the answer of the challenge of this hour it is the answer and the call for what has been prayed for for what has been waited on it is God coming and fulfilling his word when all the prophets had prayed a brown they paid prayed about not only the coming the first coming and the outpouring of the Holy Ghost but they have prayed for the coming of the Lord they are praying when their there would be a renewal upon this herd they have paid for these things and now notice its paws who put the burden on their heart to pray in that way and the Saint gotta put the burden is the same God who comes to fulfill his word it's all God no glory goes to man it's all the Lord so we have this promise where he said in his word whoever two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst what a promise that we have the preaching of the word why when the ministering of the word here there's so many channels so many facets to it it's that our faith would be brought up is that we would see who we are it's that direction as the hour that we're in it sometimes just snap us out if we become a little bit dazed with situations it's to inspire and bring faith in our life and with it all with the preaching of the word it is the Spirit of God that follows behind that word and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty there's Liberty now when we recognize that the word what the word has said to us you know brother Branham would take the example in the message perfect faith and he would speak to us regarding that vision that God how God spake by the vision concerning the little boy that was raised in Finland and brother Bryan would bring that in the message perfect faith and he would speak to us and encourage us and say the same way said has God spoke through a vision in this day for that boy to be raised up he said to recognize if there was any vision he said that is not according to this the vision is wrong he said because this is more than the vision see any vision it must come in line with God's Word and what was it what was the whole part within that that our faith would be built in the Word of God that's the hope that's the Ministry of Malachi for revelations Tim seventh is that our faith would be restored turned back to original Bible faith not something that's of of the of the intellect but it is a Bible faith brought by a Bible Holy Ghost now want you to think of this here and I'm gonna read just some of these points to you because when we're looking at this brother Branham was getting ready to preach this is just a few little bit before the Lord were taking home here it is in 1965 works as faith expressed and he's getting ready to preach the rapture he says but the Lord came to me tonight he said before I was getting ready to preach that message on the rapture and he said he is said to me pray for the sick tonight and I want sure what's what brother Graham says he says so tonight he said well he said I'd like to have one of those old-fashioned prayer lines here we are with in 1965 here at the end he said I would like to have one of those old-fashioned prayer lines and we realized brother Brandon goes into that message and he's letting us know that everybody that comes through the prayer line and he he reaches Clare all the way back just because they come across it doesn't mean that they get healed when they have a prayer line but he says remember he said there's some people he said that are trying their best to work themselves into a place to be healed he said you can't do that it's by grace now if you just bear with me a moment how brother Ram will go through it's all laid out in the message but there's many times where we in our being our own makeup it yeah I'll say it like this it's easier many times for us to become anxious sometimes depending on your makeup more than others it's easy and the scripture would even regard this and tell us in the book of Philippians be careful for nothing that phrase means be anxious about nothing is that right the Lord Jesus even addressed that even in the daily cares of life don't be consumed don't be anxious for these things but brother Brown would tell us that that there that there's a difference but he goes into bringing us to a place that it must be if faith itself will drop within that heart even when they come across the prayer line even when it was discernment or when they were passing him through in the prayer line it had to be faith would drop in the heart of the individual now God has raised let me just say it like this there would be that God has a way to operate if our faith needs a little charge God does not mind giving a charge you don't look down and say well why do you need a charge of your faith but everything itself remember God is building and he knows exactly what you and I what we have Nita it's to recognize brother Ram would go into that part and say they recognize that who the Lord Jesus was when you recognize who he is then what you have need of is released to you now in mark chapter 5 verse 22 maybe I'll just move through this scriptures here quickly but here you have a man by the name of gyrus that I was a Bible reader we're very familiar with gyrus gyrus brother Ram would call him a secret believer he came to the Lord Jesus there was a need in his home his little daughter I believe you sung about it tonight his little daughter they were as she was taken medicine doctors and things like that but there was nothing she wasn't getting better you know here it was a situation that let's just say like this there might have been somebody in the house in the same subdivision that had the same situation and they took medicine and their daughter or son got better it wasn't the medicine it was the part that God was coming to bring gyruss out of the Paul said if we could say it he was a secret believer but God was coming and allowing a situation that would draw him out to make a decision well thank God for His grace but when God does that God has something to prove and make real to our hearts now notice what gyrus says here in verse 23 he besought him greatly and he says my daughter lieth at the point of death I pray thee come and lay thy hands on her that she may be healed and she shall live now hear Jesus they may move toward Genesis home in verse 27 no right in the midst of this journey here comes the woman here with the issue of blood the Bible says in verse 27 when she had heard of Jesus she came in the press behind and touched his garment for she said if I may touch but his clothes I shall be whole that was her testimony are you with me Jesus never told her that if you touch me you'll be made whole her faith declare if I can touch his garments I'll be made whole her faith are you with me now her faith could not ray say that her faith in that place was not because she was a real sharp person and she had you know a lot of memory of Scripture she had good DNA it one wasn't because what she had faith because her mom and dad and we believe in devotions and all those things it was not about her it was her faith but it was God remember she recognized God was present in Jesus Christ her faith was in the reality God is present in this ministry it's like the little black girl that was down there in the South era I believe Arkansas she got lost from her daddy I mean them the throngs of people that were there you know I think of you know I didn't go into Jonesboro but brother Matt Morris his daddy was taking me around the one that was down there preaching and showing me different things and as we went over there and you know I've just here we are down in that area and you're thinking about this she separated amongst a throng of people and she's blind but this was her testimony she comes into a place she didn't realize she bumped into brother Brennan she didn't realize that but there's one thing that she said she said if you can get me to the healer she said I'll find my daddy let me just tell you something what she recognized she recognized it wasn't brother Branham but God was prescient in that ministry she couldn't see the miracles taking place but brother supernaturally she heard and she believed God is present in that ministry she didn't have to know how was this optic nerve and how's this going to be it was that's that's not for us to figure out as a matter of fact God don't even need an optic nerve he is the creator in the scriptures you have those that did not have any eyes and God created their eyes and in this generation the same faith God created eyes and the Prophet would stop and say pardon me I forgot to ask you what color you want that is a living God present among us Oh glory be to God she is seeing Jesus he realizes virtue has gone out of him and he commends her if I just may skip a little bit he commends her daughter my faith hath made the whole goal in peace and be hold of that plank she was confident in that now here we resume in verse 35 here's the here's the ruler of the synagogue gyrus who were reading about they come running out to him now think about it and they make this statement that daughter is dead why trouble the master any longer I want you to watch this I love this portion of Scripture Jesus hearing the saying be not afraid only believe he was aware just like it is with you and I sometimes we can receive reports we can receive things that will come our way that want to bring fear sometimes we hear rumors or we hear this whether it's about your job whether it's things that you deal with within sickness or whatever it might be but notice Jesus catches that and he says be not afraid only believe he's on his way to lay hands on her and he took hope he took faith hope and charity Peter James and John the brother of James he comes into the place here they are weeping notice the atmosphere this was not an atmosphere this was not an atmosphere where healing could come the atmosphere had to be right you recognize atmospheres important atmospheres not just in part in receiving your healing but atmosphere is important in retaining your healing so a better breath says you God can heal you and he said you get out there amongst amongst a bunch of unbelievers that don't believe like you do and don't believe that God heals the sick and he said you watch that which was left you now will come back because why it's an atmosphere if you don't break away from it atmosphere is important Genesis 1 there is an atmosphere and the word has is the creating of the right atmosphere that's why it's important to be in the right atmosphere fellowship but brothers and sisters of like precious faith I don't even listen it doesn't even matter if you're on the job and we know we can't control the atmospheres in the job but listen you don't have to stay around and listen to things that are so negative and vile and everything else I know some of you work in situations and some of you just you have then an opportunity to put noise-canceling headphones on just to block out a lot of stuff around you but you know what the reality of that is is don't let that negativity come in to your mind even if it's simply just playing a little soft music hallelujah he's sending the atmosphere just right the atmosphere has got to be set just right remember they were laughing at him they everything out he Jesus put them all out of the house get out and he took the mother and father and brought them in the Bible says and he took the damsel by the hand remember javis request come and lay the hands on my daughter and she shall be made well different than what the Roman centurion spoke when he said Speak the word only is that right but notice Jesus says he said damns I saying to thee arise and she arose she she was healed what a testimony of the mercy of Almighty God and what I'm just just looking at a little point here within this just in in this many many ways brother Branham would talk about with laying on of hands he said the reason that my ministry isn't as effective in America as it is overseas he said is because in America he said people are very anxious for you to lay hands on them now just stay with me now uh-huh he said but notice he said the Roman he's prevented that's a Jewish tradition but it's scriptural are you with me it's Scripture he said but this Roman centurion did not have that tradition but the Roman centurion what he recognized remember he said I'm a man under authority he recognized God was present in Christ he recognized over every disease over every sickness you are over in all all you have to do you speak to where you talking about revelation he realized that every sickness remember it's a demon he recognized it's an angel that fell from his first estate to know somebody and he recognized that the water is above every disease above every sickness of every situation he had to apply the word glory be to God Cyrus was applying the word to come home now but gyruss was channeled in that way he had that hands for hands to be laid off but notice Jesus never said to him that come on why you have to have hands laid on when try this tradition jesus never took that approach and they just said he never took that approach in this hour either I read to you one one I read to you one place here at the end where bill addressed us or would like to have an old-fashioned prayer line again see the balance that we're looking at right here brother Branham is not in this right here and many other quotes brother Branham is not taking away from the scripture but rather it's that our faith would be positioned in the right person indeed anyone what it was they might they might need hands later on it might be a service when hands are being laid up but it might be a service where the word as it's coming forth if you can receive that word the word can come and bring healing right there in your body and in your you see it's to recognize its faith in Jesus Christ the finished work of Calvary glory be to God it's our personal faith and that finished work see brother Branham is dealing with how everything was so inclined to you know God I have hands laid on and that's why brother Graham said the idea he said it's not to touch me as a matter of fact in one place brother Brown refers the lady he said you see that picture he's talking about the picture there taken in Houston Texas where there where the the pillar of fire here the angel of the Lord we have this picture taken with us and brother Graham could say he said you see that picture right there he said not what you need to look at is is to recognize there's one right there in that picture he said not me he said that one that's representing there in that picture he said is right here he said I'm just like the brass serpent what was the brass serpent it was that of a vessel to look and live you see God makes himself real he wants our faith to be energized that's what God will come and speak so personally through his word you got a need in your life and Scott will come through and speak to that need a question you've got deep in your life and you feel like everything's exposed where did that come from that's rooted so deep in me that's caught letting you know he's making himself visible by his word that he is the same yesterday today and forever then what should I do let your faith rise and say I accepted Lord the idea through the Rebbe said the idea isn't to touch me it's to touch him over and over brother branham within the within the services and I refer to that place of the woman with the issue of blood and and here you would find different ones here they were they were believing they were praying and then we find here the Spirit of God brother banwen inter and intra vision things would be be made known to this person what a brother Brahim say he would ask us the question who did they touch he is the high priest the Bible says in Hebrews 4 that is touched by the feeling of our infirmities aren't you glad about that think about John Ryan John Ryan came he came in the prayer line he was pronounced well he goes off he still can't see comes right back around and what's you think of this the Prophet he catches his background Catholic got to give him something to do works go testify of your healing is that right so you never minimized and says man your faith is weak man oh we understand it will get into the degrees of and how faith itself yeah we move but notice he never ever condemned that he's a go testify of your healing I'll tell you right now I believe in my heart we'd have a lot more things done in our life if we took that simplicity he's the high priest of our confession well brother brother say no I'm not sure you know I can't know all the way believe it down here but believe it up here and brother Brent says you keep saying it until you believe it down here when you know that God has spoke to your heart about something that something God has made personal to you you may not see it in your life you may not even feel it in and about whether you feel it or not you gotta be like Mary Mary was positive before she was ever positive that's a quote she was positive for she was positive why what could she be positive she was positive that God's Word is positive God has spoke to me before I feel anything the world has already declared it hmm often thought you know my dad would say he said you know when that barber took out after John Ryan he said I wonder if the barber actually wanted to shake his hand about the testimony or he just one of his apron back so I could going back to you know aren't you glad that healing and miracles and the move of God aren't you glad it means something to you brother Brown talks about in the situation's you know that our president and what some many things that were going on brother Brown he brings a difference you know to where he said you know you've had people that he was talking above a certain case where you know coming right off out of the wheelchair they're not even been a prayer line no hands laid on him I think of what brother Branham says on the message in time I think it's in time the seed sign I think it was where brother Branham deals with he says I there was a woman a lady that was laying on a cot he said I walked to the platform and never touched her he said well what I did I preached the word and I held to that word and he said while the word was being preached she got up off of the cot what was all that about was for you and I the whole party comes down to is that our faith would be placed in the word if this hour we've got to have rupturing faith but the good thing about it is it isn't you or me working it up God is providing service after service day after day and more and more that keeps coming our way more as dropping we're seeing ourselves more clearly what is it it's quickening power what mercy brother Branham said this up here he's trying to get the people he said the presence of the Lord was there to heal he said this what I'm speaking of he said that's the way God likes to do it he says this this is on a higher level than just laying on of hands he says you know he goes in talking about remember how Billy Branham was was criticized about Oral Roberts and or different ones were saying well you know all Roberts can pray for hundreds and a Allen he but you only pray for a few brother brems said the difference is that's gifts of healing he said this is a prophetic gift it's different that one a gift of healing is to touch each one but this is a prophetic gift to declare he is now here is that right is is for us to recognize that he's the same yesterday today and forever now let's look let me look here let me refer this here in acts 14 verse 8 and there said a certain man here is Paul ministering in acts 14 8 there said a certain man at Lystra impotent in his feet being a from his mother's womb who never had walked and the same heard Paul speak who steadfastly beholding him and perceiving that he had faith to be healed I don't know if a man came into the meeting with the faith already or the preaching of the word brought it to that place but whatever well however it was remember it is always your personal faith that brings the results and plow perceived this man had faith who was it how could Paul perceive that because the Saint Spirit of God that was a night thing Paul in Paul's life delivering the word it was the same God that couldn't move and make known your faith is in the right place are you with me your faith is in the right place older think about it one of these mornings a man that faith is going to be right in the right place will be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye we've already heard shouter we've been a symbol by the message of the hour oh my were waiting on the voice of the resurrection are you with me to think about this the faith the perception of where it's even act within this hour oh brother sister I don't believe these things are far out there I believe it's right here I believe it's right here and I say that as a personal witness of that notice what Paul did he said with a loud voice stand upright on thy feet you know why Paul could say that cuz he perceived a man had faith to be healed are you with me but the bram could say like this to you and I he said Jesus he said even if he was wearing the suit that he gave me he could do no more for you than what your faith will release to you don't you see where the enemy wants to so hold back and make it like it's got to be somebody it's got to be this no it's Lord energize my faith but we don't have to wait listen you don't have to wait for service your faith the Bible says in the book of Jude building up your most holy faith but I am thankful that when we've been a little weak I'm so glad that God is mindful aren't you glad all brother Sandra brother branham never never never he you know he didn't want hands laid on him that was a Jewish race you haven't read all the way see this is not what I'm even bringing tonight I'm trying to bring that balance to show that within these things because you have individuals and people and I believe they mean good but they want to step it out here in a way and say when we're just going to speak the word only we believe that but we also believe laying hands on the sick that's still the scripture same as speaking the word are you with me and by an in the very very beginning of the adoption series adoption part 1 right towards the end of it brother Ram talks about how but he was sick in his house he said how I would have give anything for somebody to come over and laid hands on me and prayed for me she's a balanced brother BAM one coming against laying on hands this is where in like I said and I I look at these things my heart's desire what God moved on my heart upon these things right here is that our heart because sometimes you have people say well I'm just gonna wait I'm not coming up to be prayed for I'm just gonna wait I'll tell you right right now if I got a need I'm getting to Jesus you better believe it I'm getting to Jesus if I've got a need in my life I'm not gonna be quiet about it I'm calling some people to pray that Scripture I don't have nothing to prove I'm not to prove he proves his own word I'm not the one who decides how it comes he is the one but irregardless it is all the word remember when this was done the Bible goes on to say how that you know the people said ma the gods are come down among us and in the likeness of men brother bran would take it up in perfect faith and he said somebody's saying well I got all the faith I got all the faith the Ben says if you got all the faith why are you up in the prayer line then see he's not listened to me he's not knocking the prayer line I'm sorry I don't have the greatest speech and words to put together but I only know how to say it how I am he's not knocking that he's not saying anything against it what he's letting them know is is that don't imagine anything let God if our faith needs to be stimulated let God said Lord help out my unbelief God moves weathers honesty but I don't care I'm healed I just I know that by His stripes I'm healed flatout by His stripes I'm healed you see what's happenin and I'll say it like this the way that Satan would work he would work to try to take such a tremendous word that has been given to us but then maybe a come across in a manner as though it's prideful of you so I don't need to take ass for not just believe God that's pride I don't need to go to doctors I that's pride well I don't need I don't need hands laid on me that's pride you see the thing of it is faith being declared it's not something you're declined because what brother brems said we had to have faith so I'm just going to say that I've got faith know it's being real with the word but when we see things in the word coming out and we see our lives and Lord take me there I want to go there that's why brother Branham in on the wings of a snow I dug he said this revelation has led me to a faith I never had before I'm willing to be led how about you in order to lead me to a faith that I've never had before oh my you see there takes the stimulates that's why brother branham would say and I had a an individual is wanting to question me about the message and things like that and knew this happened and that happened and I just thought I said hold on a second I said you realize I said that they're not one vision the vision don't heal nobody I said you know that the vision don't heal nobody the vision only makes you aware of his presence this is the words the Prophet declares to us he said you can come across right here he said in here here you come through the vision you receive your healing and you can lose it by the time you go off it's not the vision that heals you see in all these things I know I'll tell ya it's hard to not preach this but all of these things that comes down to our personal faith we needed help like Sarah Sarah couldn't see yourself this is why brother Graham could say I believe it was Abraham's faith that produced the miracle in Sarah's womb but when you break over into Hebrews 11 you realize that that faith that was there in Abraham was held right there and that faith now became preeminent in Sarah's life where it said she judged him faithful she received due to mass strength to conceive Oh thankful to Almighty God that God seized what we have needeth and the releases that's what he's done in this generation that's what the message of the hour is revealed to you and I it is the same original faith that is revealed and moved into our hearts not a church faith not a church document but the same Living God the vision where the RAM says that's what remember how he would say many times he said now no no no if he feels if you v/o some would it help your face that's precious would it help your faith because it's your faith my faith that releases it you say why would that be because anything less than that we don't have what it's needed to sustain the enemy wanting to come back the good man of the house is your faith you're with me so I brother Branham could say he said I watch I think it's one of the messages title of faith in it I did I remember where those on the road here in it but anyhow brother Graham says here he says when he said you take somebody he said that's got a spirit he said they're bound they're possessed with a devil he said you better be careful he said because if you take that off and they don't have the faith to resist it it'll come right back see it's not playing around these are not playing around it's all is what is it doing why God works this way to build our face and let me tell you something the devil can try when God has healed you of something the devil can trying to come around with a pain try to come around the flow duration and say see it didn't go that's your faith you stand right there as a son and daughter God say you're a liar Your Honor I have already been made free of that you're not welcome here no more glory be to God blessed be the name of the Lord it's an operation brother Rama talk about how here they are being healed he said look he said this had just took place that wasn't my faith this is our message God provided way healed it wasn't my faith this was an operation of the Holy Ghost through me that give her faith her own faith is what made her well another place in 1965 right towards if it's two days later well he said tonight we're gonna have an old-fashioned prayer line we're just going to pray for the sick the way we used to brother Jack and brother Brown it never took away from parent lines it never took away from laying hands on the sick I even when you look at that of proverbs 31 proverbs 31 so who can find a virtuous woman write it these scriptures are more than a Mother's Day card come on this is speaking of the bride of Jesus Christ and you look at one of one of the scriptures within here one of the parts in verse 20 it says she stretched out her hand to the port yay she reaches her hands to the needy it's dealing with sickness needs mark 16 these are the general orders of the church these orders ain't changed some have tried to edit those orders and italicize them and read this one in the original manuscript well I'll tell you one thing this sure wasn't in the original manuscript about going and building schools dominations wasn't in there come on somebody that wasn't in there but these are the general orders of the Church of the Living God familiar Scripture we've been reading a lot but verse 18 they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so if lay hands on the sick is a weakness of faith then Jesus put into General Orders can y'all give me a few more moments I'm not gonna run to a nine o'clock by promised I maybe I should have said that but I'm not on 100 nine o'clock but listen brother branham takes the example in The Reader's Digest now you can even read this you can even read things right now you can pull up where they have people coming in and praying for people in hospitals and the effects of it but brother Brown talks about an example that took place over in London where Newsweek and Reader's Digest they got a hold of this of where they were talking they said all the divine healers are loose but what it was it was it was people who believed in praying for the sick and they were going in there and they were praying over the sick so what they did the scientists in different ones they wanted to see one is it that's closing were these people to get better any funny science tries to figure things out rogram said they took he said they actually took a piece of lead foil he said no anybody knows lead will reflect the lights and they took the camera and they put it on there and we're here was a believer a man that was praying for another one he laid his hands on him and began to pray and coming out of the man's hands and on that lead and coming back it was a ray of light and brother Graham said see he said God knew what he was talking about when he said they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover amen you sell about it tonight I sold the life and now I am the light amen when you sister when you have that like sister Amanda when Hattie was six there that day you laid hands on her and you prayed over her right there going out was right Ray's going out what were the light rays that is the working of the Holy Spirit a man is right in the body hey man light is in the body eyes have come and eyes have come to thy body might be full of light this is the hour where Elijah lays himself on the child God took over the body hallelujah Oh glory this is what how the scripture would say how that even Paul he rocks fish spend God brought special miracles by the hands of Paul let me just let me just move here we'll pick that scripture up for some other time but here Paul and I just without reading it you can read it tonight or at the time and that's 28 they come to the hottest the island of Malita Paul is going around getting wood he goes around and gets wood Paul wasn't going into a box rattlesnakes where the tempo of the music was worked up know if Paul was putting getting wood on the fire and there was a Viper that was in there Paul didn't reach in to grab it he reached in to get the wood and the Viper latched on him the promises they shall take up serpents come on now if they give if they come on them Paul notice where the people think of how God did this I think how God did this this one the gardener snake some of that we'd have been screaming I'm gonna call him on your names this was a Viper and the people of that are innocent how God knows to do things he'll testify of his glory right in the midst of a situation the people looked at him as this guy's got to be a murderer he's a bad guy look what happened to superstition right Oh bad guy you know I'm a super a bad guy but here they begin to realize the Bible said they had a change of mind because they saw Paul he shook it off and he kept going he's getting weakened he grew stronger you know what that did that opened an opportunity for the gospel think about it Paul would have been raising his hand saying I want to get bit by Viper no but it was an opportunity God came through and there were those of that were need of healing and the Bible says right here right here Paul Cain the Bible says in verse in verse 8 it says and the father of publix lay sick of a fever and a bloody flux to whom Paul entered in and prayed and laid his hands on him and healed him hey they recognize this is a reality there's a supernatural one present in this man's life is that right Paul laid his hands on them and then we find how that the desert that many that were with disease as they came and they came brother branham he makes a statement and I'm I'm closing I've went through a lot here brother branham here in that message God's chosen place of worship he's asking the people is anybody sick he talks about the handkerchief that are on the platform before him he prays over those handkerchiefs but here's what he asked the people to do he said I'm gonna ask you to do me a favor he said you know the Bible said these signs shall follow them that believe and they shall lay their hands on the sick they shall recover if you notice what it says they shall recover Satan wants to try to set times they shall recover blugh Benson I'm asking you as a believer to lay hands on somebody in front of you look what he says Lord the hands of these people laying on each other they are symbolizing their faith so laying on of hands does not mean you have less faith you're symbolizing your faith they're symbolizing their faith Lord in the promise they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover the ground goes on to pray and he said now everybody that accepts their healing upon the basis of the written word make your testimony by standing to your feet and say I now accept my healing in the name of Jesus Christ aren't you glad or the brand would say it this clear in token is the last nigh read in Dallas Texas he said may every person passing through here present their token that they have received the Holy Ghost that they are born again child of God that they believe it with all their heart and as they pass through may they curse that disease and affliction of their body and may they go out of here rejoicing knowing that their faith has made them whole he says Lord God as we laid as we laid the Old Testament our hands upon the sacrifice to identify ourselves with the sacrifice we lay our hands upon Jesus and identifying ourselves with him he laid his hands upon us now in the ministry identifying himself with us by signs and wonders and we are laying our hands upon the set to identify ourselves with them with our faith connected with them sickness has to go it's all connected we have identified think of what think of the reality what God has done with the message that he promised us in it has brought us back into the identity of the true sacrifice and coming into that identity he has identified himself with us he identified himself in the ministry of the Prophet we are identified in that ministry because that ministry is not outside of the body it is in the body it man's so that here he has identified himself with us so laying on her hands I know it may not been deep and I don't worry about that anyhow my point is is that when I look what was just what God just pushed pressed on my heart is the fact that this right here what however God deals with your heart you obey there's times for prayer lines some of you know you've been here long enough there's times when I have I have that the Spirit of the God of the Lord has told me a week ahead of time and I would tell you get ready on Thursday night we're gonna have a prayer line and needs of how God has met we don't just call him to caller right but there's needs when we have needs God knows what our needs are I say it like this it may and may not see a lot with when we're just in our regular services but I've said this very clearly I believe there's needs in the body of Jesus Christ the Prophet was never against the prayer lines and if somebody if somebody is against that I don't have anything against them but if they do if that's where that's where their faith is that that's between them and God but as for me and Myles we believe that the word can come we're witnesses listen you don't even have to be here to receive the Holy Ghost you can receive and write in your seat while the words being preached reality you don't even got to be in a church house Lutron say you don't got to be in a church house receive your healing he said you can be in a cornfield it shows it's not about a person God can speak to you through this ministry but my hands are not what does the work it's your faith in anyone else it's your faith the whole thing is that our faith would raise within him to stand up on his word and accept it I missing Lord I believe I believe it amen because let me just say some laying hands on the sick in just for the preachers my little darlings laid hands on me many times in a good way when I'm when I'm not been feeling well oh yeah and she's prayed my boys I've had to call him say boys I need you to pray for daddy I need I need a touch from God or else I'm not gonna be able to stand and preach let him come and pray that's the scripture man we have been given authority they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover it's our faith standing upon that word let's pray father Lord we thank you tonight for your mercy Lord Jesus we Lord we rejoice Lord and as we look through Lord in your word and Lord in many least times sometimes in a service like this it's more of a of a service Lord we're just just kind of ordering some things balancing some things revisiting Lord some things that Lord if there's anywhere where the enemy would try to take something from us or or try to push us in a certain direction Lord we want to stay balanced in your word and Lord we do not want to be a people that just says the Lord in a manner well I you know I I don't need to have hands laid on me Lord we see that that that doesn't even fit in the scripture Lord that does not fit Lord within the message Lord we don't want pride around our lives we don't want that Lord I don't know believer once that but we thank you for the balance Lord the whole focus was that our faith it is to rest in the finished work of Calvary it's to rest in you Lord we thank you for that as your profit would make known to the people over and over he would say now when when when I'm gone from this discount he said your pastor and he goes through the other ministry all them he said they pray for the sick too he said God hears their prayer just as much as he does mine Lord is building our faith in the word in you Lord Jesus we appreciate you forgive us Lord when we've Lord I'd say forgive us when we maybe have walked within pride forgive us Lord because I know that Lord were understanding sometimes lord and trying to look at these things and balance it out should I go this way if I if I don't take it this way I must not have faith and I don't want to be regarded as not having faith but I'm so glad Lord that you come to dismantle I'm glad that you come to dismantle Lord and balance everything out Lord so we can realize Lord whether you come Lord and our healing comes Lord just while the words coming forth your prophet taught us about how the white moody preaching the word he said just preaching the word people were healed right in the pews Oh God how wonderful it is Lord how wonderful you are what a wonderful what a reality Lord to see you working in our myths Lord God of needs that you have moved upon Lord you have healed Lord you're the one Lord that has done the healing you're the one Lord that has brought the deliverance Lord and father we thank you Lord God for bringing our faith into that place Lord that you would make yourself so real Lord and how the word Lord just becoming so rich and so personal Lord or God it's you building Lord our faith Lord like your prophet told us in spiritual food and due season that we would be built up build up accumulate all the things that you have done in this hour build up in our lives that it would build up a faith within us thank you Father what I pray if there's one here tonight that doesn't know you in that way but father in their personal faith their faith can say Lord I believe that's for me I believe that's for me one that needs healing in their body Lord that they can say Lord that's for me tonight Lord Lord I I'd take that tonight Lord to stand upon that tonight Lord Lord granted tonight Lord may they not depart from that but may they walk on Lord fully Lord Lord to where they meet you face-to-face and Lord knowing that that promise is formed may they walk fully Lord O God seeing that perfectly whole body and from him and walk step by step until they step into that body granite Lord in the name of Jesus Christ trust in all day believe in man say [Music] and be done if I stay god [Music] trust and obey leave him and say don't try to figure it out say hi

good thing Jesus Christ makes me whole you see what the enemy would want to come around and do whisper in your ear well you don't have much faith let me just tell you something that ain't the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost does not work to bring condemnation you don't work that way that's the enemy wanting to try to bring the word around and try to belittle you try to put you in the corner but you can look at it like this you can say heart I've got good faith in the Lord operate on my faith that it'll grow it'll grow from good better best I think that's how it goes good better best never only
