i'll let you have your seats for just a few moments and so i guess you can say you got some exercise today maybe you can eat another portion at lunchtime up and down but you know after all brother branham said he said when the churches he said there you know nothing wrong with building a gym or anything like that but brother bam said it used to be he said we're we used to get all of our exercise in church it's direct quote my goodness what a place to have exercise that would just you could cancel your planet fitness everything you know but we're so thankful to be gathered together here in the presence of the lord and um i want to on behalf of my wife and myself and benjamin we'd like to thank everyone for coming yesterday and for making the the day so special for benjamin i also want to say a real special thanks for all who helped and and labored and all the cooking and set up and brother aaron sister amanda for all the organizing and uh they just took it took it right on and uh so we just we just so appreciate that and um lord willing we have some other we have some fellowship dinners that are planned and that will be coming out to you but it will be on a sunday because i know different ones have been asking and so we'll have it at the same location and there's the next one will be in september it'll be after the meetings with brother darrell ward i believe it's on oh boy the date it's the i think it's the sunday september 19th so it'll be at the same place but it'll be on a sunday so we'll have a fellowship dinner as a church there at the same location and so i appreciate brother aaron sister amanda securing those things for us and then also the that church there it's a nice facility the facility have given us and we certainly just want to really really say thank you to them as well i want to hear this morning we had put out and my wife and i were just i was talking when i left here last week that i certainly would like to have prayer for those who are going back to school whether home schooled college going into elementary school high school wherever it is and i know there's a how do i say it this way there's a lot of things that are are are said and projected and there's a lot of things as parents right now that you have other things to try to contend with and and i can just say it in this way that in every part of your life the greatest thing that we can do for all of us is keep our focus on the lord jesus christ and i'm not just saying that to be saying it but i'm saying it because it's true that everything is to be filtered filter it through that yes and we know that in every just like in every step in every part of our life it's a life it's a walk of faith and faith is a trusting in god that even in the next step that god said take this step that i'll take that step he'll be right there to guide me and to watch over me and we're living in times for the world of uncertainty but not for the believer not for the believer there there is no uncertainty to a believer we know in whom we have believed and we are persuaded that he is able so our certainty is fixed in him and so there and uh there's a lot of there's a lot of things and i'm just you you know where i stand on these things and it's not brother samuel's standing there's things that we can look at in the message brother branham could go into certain things but it would always come back and be balanced right with the word there's so many things that's out there nowadays that's just propaganda from theories they're wanting to teach in the schools to to even a lot of the news feeds and things that are going on that just this and this and this and this is going and the sad part about it is is people ingest it and repeat it that's what's sad we are to have a filter of the word in this hour amen i am not i i just i refuse to go in that channel i stay with the word then i'd stay within that that anchor that i know and whom i have believed and that's what that's where i stand upon that upon the word and i want to say that when we start into a new new school year and some i know have already maybe started some of you will be and i want to just say it in this manner that when job without reading the scripture but pooling just from job chapter one the scripture speaks of how that job he offered up the burnt sacrifice and he's and it was in this manner in verse four if i i'm going to go ahead and read that verse 4 and verse 5 it says his sons went and feasted in their houses everyone his day sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them and it was so when the days of their feasting were gone about that job sent and sanctified them and rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all for job said it may be that my sons have sinned and cursed god in their hearts thus did job continually and that phrase is a very powerful phrase i'm not going to preach on that today but i just it's just some things that when we look at it thus did job continually it was the burnt offering which this is god's requirement which was the very type of the lord jesus christ so it was the offering up and where job's faith was anchored was in this sufficient sacrifice that god had revealed to him this is the acceptable way and so that's where job's faith was at and thus did job continually brother brown picks it up in the message the approach to god and brother brahm is dealing with how that even he himself was concerned when he thought about having to send he says at that time billy paul out there into the high schools and brother branham would say it in this manner he says you know he says we all as parents know what that feeling is and he's tying that into job when your children your very heart begins to mingle with the world and get out among the young believers he says i he says i don't suppose that billy's into church right now but he says there's a you know he says in our city we do not have a christian school and there's a bunch of worldly children girls and boys too and when i thought of sending my boy to that school knowing that everything that i drilled into him unless he becomes really converted really come to christ that is all of his nature be changed he would be swept out from under my hands as soon as he gets with this worldly bunch because the very nature in him no matter how how being a good boy having a minister father a religious home where we don't approve of any of the worldly things in our home we try to live by the grace of god like christians ought to live the influence set before him i knowed if he was lost he'd have to walk over a righteous home to be lost and i want him to have to walk look how brother of them says that i want him to have to walk over my life and he'd have to walk over the bible he'd have to walk over the blood of christ because i'll certainly by god's grace presented in front of him and i say it in this manner what a what an approach you see the burnt offering itself now the same life that was in the sacrifice comes back upon the worshiper so now our lives are alive that's lived as a sacrifice unto god so who is it it's the sacrifice the same life the lord jesus on display in our lives so this is where we have our confidence sure we have to i know some you know as we we homeschool and others have uh you know children they're going to college we have you know i guess if the doors are open or uh and some things you know back and forth but just knowing in this manner and i know some things are there's some other things that's upon upon the minds as parents even in this time and i wish i could take that off of your minds but i can't take that off of your minds but there's one who can give you a real peace he can give you a peace because it isn't removing the situation it just gives you peace in the midst of it and there's a god who who's faithful to his word and as young people let me just say to you as all of the young people when you you go out there and you're among even some of you that do things you know online and so forth like that there's all sorts of influences and there's young people those have been gathering my house you remember we've been speaking on that that scripture of follow me and just taking just a few uh services on that at our house everything satan has his guns they're trained upon you it's to try to come at you try to influence your life but just remember the training the word the teaching and what you've been under and realize that everything that when you see things taking place out there it's influences to try to pull you in a certain direction it's trying to pull you and trying to lay a hold upon you and try to put trying to push other things into you and i would just say it to you like this you need schooling the gospel does not support your literacy you should have you you should have your education but never let education become your god this is why we have society the way it is they've elevated education and men's thinking and that's what brother bram says is the sign of a communist of windows this is his words power transformation that's what communists do they elevate education and tear down god but this is why that sure we need education you need to learn how to read and write you need to learn how to do all those things but always remember look to the lord let god be the focus in your life let god be the one that stabilizes your life as as parents those that have to go out from the house you put it right in the hands of almighty god and just let me just say this to you god is always invited when we're honest are you with me he's always invited within within honesty and that is if you can say lord i'm a little fearful i'm a little bit distraught about this or i'm a little bit concerned just be honest with him and say lord will you dissolve that are you with me because it doesn't do any you know we can try to say well that if i do that that shows weakness that no no that's inviting him to come and remedy because no not one of us are exempt sometimes from feeling different things of uncertainty and discouragement or whatever that that that comes with the territory of humanity are you with me this is where we have to look to god and say god resolve this in my heart resolve this in my life lord give me strength and give me a peace through this so i'd like if you would if the if the the young people those going to college in school and maybe if mom and dad if you'd like to come up with them i'd like to just have prayer here together and we'll just have prayer and just ask god just to just to be with them amen i just i tell you i just thank the world amen of our our young people and amen our our kids i really just really really appreciate them every time we come together i know some some of the you know the children are not of aids they're not into that place where we come together and there's a and we've been gathering there at the home but i just so appreciate every one of you some of you you know no matter where you're at in school and even as a parent and no matter where it's at god is faithful god is faithful amen he sees you through he doesn't stop god doesn't stop working and saying well you're old enough now to figure out p's and q's and whatever more no even when we go into those classes one thing i always prayed when i was in college i had heard a statement back and i think brother biscuit was preaching a service in 1995 and he was just speaking to the young people in this service and he says go into the he said everything they're teaching in those colleges he said get in there get what you need and get out there's a lot more stuff it's just say brother samuel did you have a lot of stuff to read through oh yeah those of you who went to college you had to weed through a lot of stuff and there's things right now that you have to weed through within college and now some of the foolishness they're wanting to bring into the public schools and everything else right now but god is faithful what do i do put on the filter of the word just let god just pray and ask god say lord be with me today watch over me today lord guide me today say lord the peace of god let your peace be with me lord as i enter into this class as i go through this lord just guide me and be with me amen let's pray heavenly father lord jesus i thank lord as we stand here at the beginning of another school year lord for these young people lord of all ages lord jesus they are are your they are under your care lord you've you've given them lord to us as parents lord you've entrusted their lives lord and here we as parents we took them lord at the very altar lord we gave them back to you saying lord we need your wisdom on how to raise them how to guide them lord give us direction through every part of their life and lord in this moment lord as lord your the parents lord is right now where they'll be going back to school or the young people i pray that god that your presence lord would just accompany them lord god may they lord just inviting you lord just to go with them lord and i pray that father that the things that they have to gather and to glean lord father that's necessary because you know the plans that you have for their life lord i pray that god you'll just give them understanding lord i pray you would give them a peace and and give the parents a peace lord in this moment in this time o god that lord it is you that we're looking to lord and our trust is in you i pray that god that you'll just give them such a strength and such an influence of the holy ghost lord in the very depths of their life oh god that lord will stand there as a repellent o god against the world lord and all of the pressures and the systems lord give wisdom lord to us as parents and leadership lord help us to be sensitive lord god and an atmosphere as the prophet talked about that burnt offering being expressed there in the home lord in our lives oh god where an atmosphere is created lord oh god where it's an atmosphere that when they can even walk into that atmosphere there's a pressure that's led off lord god oh granted lord we need lord your strength and guidance lord and we ask these things lord for the in the glory for the glory of god in the precious name of the lord jesus christ amen amen god bless you amen god bless you thank you amen as a congregation for allowing us that moment and i know that you'll just continue to amend to keep every one of them in prayer as they as they go through amen god is faithful god is faithful you know i always i think back to um i love the uh the the witness in the scripture and i'll call it in that way the witness in the scripture of when uh david was was was running in exile and remember zaduk uh the the priest he came running after david and david told him said no go on back there and you stand there and he said i got he had confidence that the council that zaduk would give would defeat the council of afidifel we got confidence in the holy ghost we got confidence in the word of god that it will defeat every council and every influence that a fitter fell would want to try to bring that satan would want to try to bring i love that witness to us in the scripture don't you amen let's just stand if we could and uh i i know i'm fully aware that every moment that i stand here counts against my time [Laughter] brother joy i'm aware of that so i need you to help me this morning as i do each time because we need the help of god and you just you pray in your heart and pull on the gift of god and we just see how the lord will just take us i know what he's had on what's been on my heart for some time we'll just look to him and just see how he'll just take us and guide us through his word here this morning amen let's just ask the author to come and just speak to us heavenly father lord we lord sense your presence oh god that's gathered right here lord this morning with us lord and we want to say thank you lord father for this really it wouldn't be a real service without you coming lord you're the one lord that we've come to see you're the one that we've come to hear from lord and we just invite you lord jesus that you had just come in a very special and personal way may you just help me and help lord the congregation to step away for a few moments lord and just to enter into that presence oh god now lord you know every need that's gathered here you know questions that are on hearts lord even if i did know him lord i could not solve them lord but father you're more than a match for every circumstance lord you're the answer for every question lord now lord we just invite you we take every bit of our needs our care we cast them upon you lord god and we just invite you that you would just move in a very special way oh god through your word that lord that whatever lord would be the need that you'll just come lord and may our hearts and our ears be so circumcised lord to speak and to hear your word oh god we pray we love you and we thank you father in the name of jesus christ amen amen let's look in luke chapter 4 i'm going to just begin there in luke 4 and i've been we've been moving through this portion in luke chapter 4 from last week here and let's go in verse 14. did you pull up the slides in luke chapter 4 verse 14 and jesus returned in the power of the spirit into galilee i just went through a testing and a temptation now he returns in the power of the spirit into galilee and there went out of fame of him throughout all the region round about and he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord and he closed the book and gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all of them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears amen may god bless the reading of the word as you're being seated here this morning for a few moments in his presence we're looking and i want to continue to work within this thought of you have a voice and all throughout the land we realize in the time that we're living in i i think when you hear how brother branham brings it out in the message voice of god in these last days i think it's january of 63 and brother brahm is talking about how there's so many voices throughout the land a voice of politics and voice on and on and on and he says there's so many voices and brother brown as he brings it around he said every one of them voices are there trying to deaden the voice of god they're trying to deaden the voice of the supernatural because you see every voice will have an effect whatever voice we give to you know having an effect in our life you see when you think about when the spies came back from looking into the land joshua and caleb and the spies they both looked at the same thing but one of them came back and what they begin to speak brought fear is that right the people were just it it just it paralyzed them they couldn't move forward at all joshua and caleb what they came back they're looking at the same thing seeing all the same circumstances but when they came back and they began to speak it was not that which was bringing fear which but it brought faith in god who made the promise who brought us this far will take us the rest of the way and see depend on what what it was that you listen to as to the results that it produced within the life and you know the voice of god is the only voice that will bring about a real faith within our lives a voice of man can bring about a lot of intellectual faith and and belief and things but this is where that when we see this as we're speaking you have a voice it's not about our thoughts upon things it's god's voice his life that now speaks to our life whether you're a preacher or not your life still is a witness and that's what jesus said when the coming of the holy ghost by this ye shall be witnesses unto me so this is what the life now coming the life god's voice that it utters through our life and it should be it should be that which brings of encouragement of strength to one another there's things sometimes that you don't even have to know about a person as i've said this many times you know just in setting here this morning there has been battles that you had to go through in order to be here there's even thoughts no doubt you've had to battle in order to come here now thoughts of all ranges because satan just doesn't give over and just say well just go ahead the devil's never going to encourage you to come to the house of god the devil will never encourage you into a promise of god that on the contrary he'll try to do everything he can to try to bring doubt to fear condemnation worry that's that's all brother brown called it like this and greatest power fought that's what satan's army brings we're we're up against an army this is a battle satan has armies just as god has an army and he's veiled in his army by his living presence and in his army god brings faith and courage in his word then what he said he is god of his word so when we we look at this scripture and and looking at this in luke 4 you see the spirit of the lord when jesus was reading this here in in in from the book of isaiah this is he's reading a scripture but what what they are are not aware of at that moment when he is reading from there the spirit of the lord is upon me it is a declaration at that moment he is actually reading or it's moved from just a written word a revealed word a word that's tabernacled now being spoken he's actually declaring what isaiah has said this is happening right now in your midst the spirit of the lord is upon me and he lays out the work that that is to be accomplished what was it it was the spirit of god that had come upon that word that which was that was uttered there in isaiah 61 which is what was a part of all of the messianic promises that was to be displayed at the coming of the messiah here it was it was written there because he was to be the messiah and when that anointing when the spirit of god came down and brought a quickening to the word it could not express something different from the word but it expressed exactly what the word had spoken so now that word had moved from the page and that word was being spoken through a living through a vessel that was there upon earth and it was declaring this is the time this is the moment it was the spirit of god operating through his word god operates freely through his word this is why the spirit of god calls us to a word birth that's what the new birth really is it's a word birth it's not just listen many can have experiences and i don't think and i've said this over and over don't do away with your experiences but remember there can be experience to experience to experience but it must come to a place to where our lives then become anchored in the word of god and it's god's life being expressed through our life to where people that'll never read a bible they can read your life now please don't misunderstand me there's good moral people outside of these walls but that doesn't make them christians it doesn't make them elected believers of god's grace remember election has nothing to do with our merits it wasn't us choosing god it's god who lets us know i chose you before the foundation of the world that's supernatural it's god operating through those channels there god's sending his word and there's a response on the inside that raises up to hear his voice and have confidence in his voice of what he is declaring about you and about me that's a supernatural work that's a divine connection between god and his pill and his people his children so here is the spirit of god so i'll just say it in this way the spirit of the lord operating in the word is what proclaims liberty it's not just somebody saying you can be free because in the book of peter it says that there are those that here they're proclaiming liberty but they're still in bondage is that right they're they're proclaiming all you can be free you can be free but the reality is they're still bound they're still bound with that sin nature but you see liberty real liberty is not something out here real liberty is what comes in here that's real liberty to where you can live as a son and daughter of god as god intended you to live i believe there ought to be liberty in the house of god don't you i believe there are to be liberty in our homes but that liberty is the spirit of the lord and it's a liberty that's created by his own life by his word moving and it sets an atmosphere in the place in our homes and right here in the assembly now here the lord jesus when he he he comes in the middle of this scripture because he stops in isaiah 61 and i know i've got to move here but he stops in the middle of that scripture of isaiah 61 2 to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord this is the year of jubilee this is now moving from a type to an anatype this is moving from a shadow to a reality he's announcing in this time this is the jubilee this is sounding on a liberty and a freedom let me just say this this liberty and freedom was an announcement being declared through his life standing in the midst of that congregation was here the messiah here was one that was represented this is what adam fell from this is where the first adam he fell from but now stands the second adam the lord himself veiled in a vesture of flesh to declare that the restoration and the jubilee is on for the sons and daughters of god you see this declaration of the spirit of god coming in the word was a witness at that moment that it's time for sons and daughters of god to come back into the liberty of what god intended you and i to be clear back from before the foundation of the world and where they fell from in the beginning now god himself has come to bring us back into that place of the dominion in our lives to where you've got a dominion over sin the flesh the devil and the world he brings us to that place and it's the mercy of god there in verse two to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord and that's where the lord jesus he stops right there he doesn't read go any further because god's mercy there is must be an issuing of god's mercy notice this right there after that scripture here's a comma a comma is a what it's a pause but right in the midst of this right here in the midst of that look at this in that comma right there that the year of the lord look what's been taking place after hear the offering up of the sacrifice the holy ghost is sent back to seal the believers on the day of pentecost is that right searches out the elect jews before titus comes in there and they you know they come in against jerusalem there's to be a ceiling of the holy ghost it works in that hour the gospel turns to the gentiles and the gentiles are receiving god is calling out a bride that he chose in his mind before the foundation of the world is that right then to take us in rapture then the gospel comes back into that of the 144 000 and then then we find now coming a day of vengeance of our god but how much happens in that space that space of time oh thank god that there's one that has stood in the gap for you and i thank god for his grace in this hour that's why paul could say the hidden mystery that's committed unto me but you know what it's not hidden to you you recognize not because you have great intellectual understanding but you recognize that i am a part of the mystery of god i wasn't searching for god god was searching for me i might have been born in a home where the message was a standard but god visited me personally and let me know that i had you in my mind before the foundation of the world it becomes personal to you thank god for the grace that's given in the space so when we see this the messiah here the living word standing there and proclaiming the word in that hour remember brethren tells us that they could not identify him with them here they should have they should have known him and let me say that statement they should have known him jesus said you've got the writings of moses these guys could quote it right they knew it verbatim but they only knew the letter and that's why brother bram tells us in spoken words original seed they only knew the history of the god of moses they didn't know the god of moses brother george alluded to that of simeon and anna in his studio on thursday night that was a very small group but they were in tune with god they were in tune with the holy spirit that portion that was given in that time and they were waiting on the consolation of israel let me say this just as much as simeon was waiting for that moment luther was waiting for this moment wesley was waiting for this moment is that all right amen brother seymour was waiting for this moment right here brother tells us christ the mystery and the token he says they were looking forward to this time they knew it you say how did they knew it they knew it by a promise of the word that there is going to be a return of the fullness of christ himself to the church of the living god they didn't know how everything was going to take place but as believers they were expecting that because it must come for the catching away did they know all the details no they didn't know there were things that they were probing at at that time but you see it just goes to show if we can bring this down to our lunch bucket god gives to you and i what we have need of right now don't worry about you know you've heard me say this before the devil gets in the details you've heard that phrase the devil gets in the details that's why brother ram tells us regarding with abraham abraham didn't try to figure it all out and how this was going to be and how that's going to be when he went up on the mountain brethren takes us right up there in genesis 22. he wasn't going to try to figure it out if he'd have stopped to try to figure it out fear would have tried to get a hold of him how am i gonna lose this boy god gave me this boy god made a promise if he starts thinking about it in his natural mind fear could take hold right there but he didn't know how god was gonna do it but what he knew god gave him to me and god will raise him up and brother braham said see the same baptism of the holy ghost that brought a quickening in your soul you can walk to the coming of the lord and know that what god did in my soul that same god will bring a change in my body amen he is jehovah jireh our provider so what we have needed but i tell you that really just takes the pressure off if we can just say you know what god you know what i have need of he knows what i have need of there might be just a portion you get out of this service here today if you can get the thought because it's amazing how that god will lay a minute lay upon a minister's heart and this way you're studying and meditating and all that it's it's for one thought god's interested in conveying his thoughts it may not be my words that get conveyed but it's his thought that'll come through a channel and it'll resonate in your heart so it's not a work of man it's a work of god speaking lip to ear to his children to build faith in our life in the promise of where we're standing in this hour oh i love him for that don't you boy that takes the burden off as a pastor let me remember that one tomorrow morning lord under the anointing you say things but i want you to say i want you to look at it in this way you see the bible look notice the fulfillment i want you just to to catch this the fulfillment the when jesus was declaring this day the scripture is fulfilled in your ears so there was a sounding that was going out in that moment now this sounding i want you to look in in matthew chapter eight we referred to a few places at the close of last week's service but i want to go into this in matthew 8 and just refer to this scripture for a moment the bible says when the even was come they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils and he cast out the spirits with his word and healed all that were sick that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by isaiah the prophet saying himself took our infirmities and bear our sicknesses now who is he he is the word is that right he is the word made flesh so the word made flesh vindicating itself in that moment in that hour he bore our infirmities he took our sicknesses so the same god that was there manifesting the year of jubilee is on that's the same god that manifested in your life in my life in this church in your home it's the same god manifesting himself declaring the jubilee is on now he took our in from he lifted them we could go on and on through the scriptures of those who had who had had had serious conditions in their life the bible talks about the woman with the issue of blood she spent all of her living on doctors nothing wrong with doctors god allowed that to be included there for you and i to show you and i that when you've come to your end and there's nothing that can be done no more even by medicine even as you're praying and you're asking god knowing all healing comes from god but when the doctors say we can't go any further there's one who can go further than the doctor can go when you can't go no further as a parent that's one who can go a lot further than you can as a parent oh glory be to god there's a god who is mighty who is merciful who is faithful who is true who is righteous altogether oh my turn with me i don't have it up there but i want you to turn them into luke chapter 5. so as you're turning there to luke chapter 5 i want to pick up this scripture you see over and over it's it's truth that is revealed and vindicated by god's presence it's god it's it's god condescending down to become flesh now look here in luke 5 and verse 22 when jesus perceived their thoughts he answering said unto them what reason you in your heart notice this is not what they said they weren't saying oh how's this he caught the thoughts who's who is this standing here this is not just a man standing here this is god only god can discern and catch the thoughts what reason ye in your hearts whether is it easier to say thy sins be forgiven thee or to say rise up and walk which one's easier my sins are forgiven you or rise up and walk because somebody can say thy sins are forgiven thee nobody sees that come on now but you see remember in the atonement you cannot deal with sin and not deal with sickness you can't deal with sickness and don't deal with sin is that right so here is the atonement on display the word the messiah declaring the authority upon earth notice that ye may know that the son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins he said to the sick of palsy now notice he take the word is directed to the sick of palsy i say unto thee arise and take up that couch and go into thine house and he immediately rose up before them and took up that where he lay on and departed to his own house glorifying god and they were all amazed and they glorified god and were filled with fear saying we have seen strange things today now you see what jesus did he taps into it to where they can't see the unseen realm of sins being forgiven but he takes this what they cannot deny here is a man who is laying on a cot he is bound he can't get up he does not have the strength to do it there is a sickness on his body that will not allow him to get up but the lord jesus announces already thy sins are forgiven thee but he takes there a visible evidence right there then the man gets up what was god showing that when a man has really been forgiven of his sins you are delivered from the bondage and the oppression that you were headed in you're able to walk right by the word it's a word that brings a healing in the soul and the quickening power coming into that word it brings the body subject to the word so it's god god declaring the the things that around god declaring what's he doing he's drawing them to the word are you hearing me he's calling them to the sacrifice this is not like those that previously which satan did to try to throw off when the messiah would come you know you know spoke some different things and some people followed them off in the desert and they got a big old bowl of kool-aid and started drinking the kool-aid and you know then they all turned upside down you understand what i'm saying that's the same thing where the way you know the devil wanted to do with all this stuff trying to do all this is why you had all those elijah type things it was trying to come to take away because satan knows that if he can try to get people taken away and looking at that and people mark things off well there ain't nothing to it you see the devil is more a believer than many people matter of fact the bible says he believes that jesus is the son of god that's scripture right and he trembles he trembles he knows that word can't be stopped he knows that god will fulfill every word but he's busy trying to bring every interpretation and every distraction to do what tried to get people off of the real thing you say how can i be on the real thing walk in the light as he is in the light god has not entrusted to you and i that we've got to go in and try to figure everything out and make sense of everything that's an old trick and slap foot of the devil god has not called us to that but god has called us as believers and as believers we believe him you see in the hour that here we are and living in this moment this is this is the same god brother brown would take it in the message who is this melchizedek the same god the same christ would come back here and reveal himself as son of man see the very fullness of god's own life coming down and tabernacling in humanity in the flesh of his church in this last days these are scriptural promises are they not these are promises in the word he is the same yesterday today and forever that's just not a phrase that's a reality he's the same and if he'd let those jews go by with and give them that message sign and then he come to the end of the gentiles teaching and let them just go in on theology he'd be unjust he's got to do the same thing so in theology one another we had a lot of theology are you hearing me there was a lot of loose ends that were out there there were there were men that you know different things that had been stated here or there and these are the things you know the sad that how satan gets among you know and gets among people and well you know brother branham pulled from here and brother brandon pulled from here and brother brown over here correction let me correct that thought a minute these men had received inspiration from god but they didn't have a certainty on it but god in this hour elijah didn't pack stones up to the mountain are you hearing me there were already loose ends that were scattered there so what god did through the ministry of elijah this ain't lifting up a man it's god that has come down it's god that is spoken in this hour god spoke with such definite that he could say in his word who can but prophesy you can't add to this if you do it's death but god came down and it's god that began to assemble truth what was he doing restoring the altar calling us back to the original sacrifice because you can't get the holy ghost unless you come back to the word because the holy ghost will only come to the word is that right because it's the word that brings deity in our midst is that right so here these the the truths and and these things where god comes down and begins to declare this and god begins to come and declare this it's god assembling the truth unto himself is that all right so when we look at this i just you know i'll just say it like this without any any any uh apology we've received the perfect interpretation by revelation we've received that now there's things that god's continuing to unfold isn't he but we rest on that part of it right there let me just say some let me say some just real straight statements here god has not allotted us to qualify the statements of the prophet by the scripture god has not entrusted any man to try to take the statements of the prophet and say well let me see if they're scriptural this is a scriptural prophet you're wasting your time you're out from under your order it's to recognize this is a revelation brother god is not coming back down to prove this again it is a sovereign act by almighty god this message is not on trial it's already been put on trial what's on trial faith faith where is your faith at remember in the message contest brother bram said when the enemy comes he comes to check and see where is the word in your life if it's up here it could be talked out if it's only in your spirit because that's connected it can be talked out reasoned out is that right somebody talk you in oh that makes sense somebody else come here oh that makes sense but when it's something down here in the soul it's greater than every bit of reasoning it's an anchor it's a reality matter of fact you just want to be where he's at because it's jesus christ that you've met he's the one that's changed your life that's what this message did it brought a uniting between us and jesus christ when i hear this message it makes me fall more in love with the lord jesus christ i appreciate my bible even more i'm just going to say some things here god has not allotted us to qualify the statements of the prophet by the scripture that's where men get in trouble that's where interpretations start out god himself who is the word has vindicated this message that he spoke through the messenger and he backs it up himself this is a scriptural message that has been identified and vindicated by god as the scriptural fulfillment in this hour so the call here's the call this is not just a title message these messages are not just titles they are announcements a total separation god's word calls for a total separation from all unbelief are you hearing me and i'll say it like this all interpretations of man as a filter god calls us from that come on that's how they missed the messiah is that right jesus didn't say i'm one of the many ways my friend do we got an absolute or not i mean we're not wishy-washy people now notice this here it is it calls us from the interpretations of man as a filter we receive the filter of the word himself that will guide us into all truth in the scriptures that's why we receive a word filter a living experience man-made interpretations never produce godly faith never they produce intellectual faith but godly faith is the faith of god moving through the body of believers that's god's objective is that the faith of god moved through our life what is the faith of god the deity of jesus christ his own life moving through our lives now i say that within this part of it right here and i hope you understand where i am i know you and i'm sure you understand me but there's things sometimes that you you hear things where people and to me it should just be in this just being this statement here you have a question about predestination look the scriptures are all filled with predestination but it should be something quickly brother branham refers to it right here quickly those things are referred that order that ought to end the argument right there it's a scriptural message it's all the way through the scripture shouldn't be a point of contention but friends listen to me and i don't say this i'm looking down i'm saying that's why brother rem said you must burn the old leaven with fire sometimes it's even previous teachings that maybe are not even wrong teachings that could be around and i'm talking about other things of the message and sometimes it's the thinking that still gets people thinking is though this is what they have to do or they have to do this at a certain time or if they don't do this in a service man they're defeated it's a thinking that is sad but remember every thought of man must subside and it must be that of god's word that has preeminence in our lives is that right amen we want him in our midst we want his life in our midst we want him to continue to reveal and move his life among us now brother branham makes a statement here in the message blind bartimaeus uh i i think i i have this up there and i'm trying to get to a place here brother braham's talking about how do the people uh they you know there's not a rallying that was going on brother memory says in the days of solomon how that the people they israel began to rally around the gift that god had given them and you seen the effect of it it affected when they rallied around the gift it was things that even in what their purpose was was noticed remember even how the queen of sheba she noticed how solomon ascended up the stairs she noticed how the table was set she noticed how they served the meat see it was a character that was on display it had an effect on everything around them this is what the display and the application of the token does in our life christ it has an effect to bring christ on display so now to rally around that gift is what is god's word what god had given according to earth that's rallying around the word and brother brahman says it like this here he is standing here and thinking where we're at at the closing of an age and he says now he says we've had signs of laying on of hands all down for 2 000 years but now we're at the closing of the age it's something different now my ministry it's through a spirit of discernment that it might manifest jesus christ's presence that lamb that we're speaking of that's been slain let me read that part again my ministry he says it's through a spirit of discernment that it might manifest jesus christ's presence that lamb that we are speaking of that's been slain so the purpose is to make him known to the people to declare him now listen brother branham couldn't do that but he was god's chosen instrument for god to come and declare malachi 4 through that you and i can say that's the fulfillment of malachi 4. but there's another part in malachi 4. god came and visited elijah but there's a you inside of those scriptures and the same god that came there to identify that word that part that's to be acted out and made manifest through the life of the prophet now that same god is manifesting the you that's included in that verse that the you is that of the children of god that are gifted by god to hear the voice of god speaking to their lives and they respond to that word brother it shatters interpretations of man it's like the stone coming to the image it smots it in the foundation it brings the reality of jesus christ present in the lives it's a to reveal him to make him known now i want to just take here just a moment in leviticus 25 i'm just going to refer to it in leviticus 25 we were reading from that before god told them number seven sabbath's unto you this was an allotted season it's an allotted time that you need to lay out you need to make ready for this it's allotted time a season and when that when that season had come after the seven sabbath the 49 years thou shalt cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land now remember what that trumpet's going to do it proclaims liberty it still proclaims liberty you might be sick in your body and the trumpet sounds to you you're free see it still proclaims liberty it calls us into the promises of god that belong to you and i so we're called to return to our possession see the word does not speak to us and then leave and leave us right there but the word having an effect in our life it builds faith to lay down cast down lay aside every weight and every sin that does so easy but such it gives us strength to rise and to return back to our possession now within this part of it this is where i'm going with this right here that within this the sounding of this trumpet and i i've mentioned this here a few times that within it it was the priest that would ride throughout the land brother brown would say it over and over the priest would ride throughout the land because somebody had to sound the trumpet and the sounding of the trumpet was an announcement that the day of atonement was on now there had been days of atonement that had been offered up it was a looking forward to something to come but on this particular time it was announcing that they were they were able to go free god was was committing to them you can go free from where you are you can go back to your possession it was a priest a high priest would ride throughout the land sounding out that the trumpet or the shofar he was announcing by the sounding you're free now that was just a type but remember it wasn't enough that he would just stand there in jerusalem and blow it there's people clear out there that couldn't hear it there's people over here that didn't hear it it's got to be taken this gospel's got to be taken you see it's got to be preached everywhere are you hearing me now you see how the gospel how god laying it out that what the sounding would be where they that could not see the blood that was being shed and it was offered up and it was accepted but the sounding of the trumpet was the announcement that the blood has been accepted and you are accepted with the blood it was the high priest that was riding throughout the land and this high priest i want you to think of this here if in hebrews chapter 2 verse 16 here he is for he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the seed of abraham god took on himself the promise of his word is that right god only takes on the garments of his word is that right oh my my my wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to god to make reconciliation for the sins of the people so it's to reconcile to bring a reconciliation to where there were that where god and man were separate but now they would be joined together back in a union now notice in hebrews 3 1 it says wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling consider the apostle and high priest of our profession christ jesus consider him think upon him consider you know that that's every time that we even we come together and we said in the services it's to think upon him we come in and we're hearing the word it's to move our thoughts from where they're at to on him to begin to think of things that you can look at a situation i don't know how i don't know how this is going to work out or i don't know how i'm going to get past this feeling or how but god comes to put our thinking on him oh i'm so glad about that aren't you now i want you to notice this and how it brings it out here within the scriptures here in hebrews uh in hebrews 7 hebrews 7 1 it says for this melchizedek king of salem priest of the most high god who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of salem which is king of peace without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the son of god abideth a priest continually so our our high priest the lord jesus now remember hear abraham returning back from the slaughter of the kings he met melchizedek god in theocony formed is that right he met him after the battle was over and he gave to abraham bread and wine i don't know if you've ever looked at it there in the scripture but to see there's all sorts of stuff that's taken place in genesis 14. there's all types of riches and remember the king of sodom is going to give abraham here i'll give you all of this and abraham said um i won't even take a shoe latcher from you lest you should say you've made abram rich abraham's presented with the temptation of ladies he turns it down are you with me there's money involved there's things involved land all of that in genesis 14 it's a repeat of even what we see in this hour where people going after natural resources all of that lays out there in genesis 14. great battles are heading in in that moment but it's in that moment it's as if nobody else is there when god comes down and meets with abraham and yet there's all sorts of chaos and everything else all around but there's a personal meeting taking place between god and one of his children what about you this morning here we are setting in the midst of chaos you might even have chaos going on in your life and feel like man there's a lot of things in disorder but that will not stop god from coming down and having communion with you it only invites him into a place he'll bring peace where there is chaos he'll bring order where there's disorder he'll bring healing with us wounds [Applause] here he came to meet abraham this priest noticed me like unto the son of god abideth a priest continually aren't you glad for that he had to come down he had to come down it's god condensing all the way down if you go to who is this melchizedek i think i have that on the notes and if you go to paragraph 68 there brother braham says now notice the difference between him and you as a son he was at the beginning the word and in morphe body he came in and lived in that in the person in melchizedek then later we never heard no more of melchizedek because he became jesus christ melchizedek was the priest but he became jesus christ oh my now i want you to look here in hebrews 7. i'm trying to get somewhere just let me read these scriptures here hebrews 7 25 wherefore goes into here talking about our high priest he is able to save them to the uttermost that means completely he don't do halfway jobs when he starts something he finishes it god doesn't get in a situation and say boy i bit too much off here i better call the plumber brother drake come over here and fix the mess i started no no he saves to the uttermost he does a complete work brother there ain't no going back because he gets right down on the inside there's no desire to go back there's only a desire for him to save them to the uttermost that come unto god by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them for you for me brother bryan that's what it's about he ever liveth to make intercession for them look at this for such a high priest became us who is holy harmless undefiled separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens who needeth not daily as though those as those high priests to offer of sacrifice first for his own sins and then for the peoples he did this once when he offered up himself for the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity weaknesses but the word of the oath which was sense the law maketh the son who is consecrated forevermore it's not he one made a high priest by the law he was made the high priest confirmed by almighty god that he was confirmed by the word let me ask you something how are you and i confirmed by the word we're not here serving out of law you got to go to church and you got to do this and you got to do that if you're still there then you can break out of that servant mentality you can break into a real sonship a real liberty to where it's not by law but there comes a real word birth on the inside and you're made of king and priest unto god by the living word of god hebrews 8 1 oh my i tell you paul just really moves right into this of the high priest look what he says now of things that we've spoken of this is the son we somebody say we have such a high priest that's my high priest he's my high priest who is sat on the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens a minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the lord pitched and not man hebrews 4 14 seeing then that what's that word we have a great high priest i like how that goes we've got a great high priest that is passed into the heavens he conquered death hell in the grave rose up on the eastern morning what's he saying he was a fulfillment of the word and he passed into the heavens oh my he wasn't alone when he went there either the old testament saints went with him is that right jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession oh my for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like we are yet without sin let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in the time of need in the message great and mighty conqueror let me just can i have just a few more moments in about five minutes but don't tell me well let's just just really zero in on this say lord just let this drop here when he came down he was in the beginning the bible said he was the word he was the logos that went out of god and the logos in the beginning was the word and he became the word then he ascended up on that glorious day of easter he become not only the word but he become the high priest of his own word oh he said what a glorious thing brother neville just think he's not only the word but he's the high priest of his own word how could we doubt it how could we walk to him and not believe that we receive what we ask for for he is the word and the intercessor of the word the logos became the word and the word was made flesh and the same flesh that was the word received up in the glory and now's the high priest making intercession by himself to his word romans 8 34 who is he that condemneth it is christ that died ye rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for us he is the high priest of our confession he has already the word became flesh but when he ascended up on that easter morning and he sat down at the right hand of god seated in power and authority he's there as a high priest of his own word to make good on every word every promise that he ever made he's there to make good on that word there's not one word in the bible there's not one there's not one promise that that he can say well i can't do that ah i changed a little bit since then i i can't do that i still don't do it i i changed i changed the program a little bit i realized this he still fulfills his word he still fulfills his promise and as that high priest would ride throughout the land sounding it out that high priest would sound out in that sounding of the high priest was to let him know you can go free the sounding of our high priest the holy spirit he ascended on high and sent back the holy spirit and the holy spirit same god who lived in his human form are you with me the same god who came down and paid the price and redemption now comes back and what's he doing he's moving through his body moving through his believers there's a voice that's sounding out what is it it's the high priest it's melchizedek it's the living god who's right in our midst it's the living god who's sounding out through our lives you see it isn't even going as you stand before people on your job it isn't that you've got to explain all the scriptures but there's a sounding that goes out of your life the same holy spirit the same life that was in that blood cell when that blood cell was open now that same life moves back into you as a worshiper and it sounds out there's liberty they're sick by his stripes we are healed are you hearing me he's the high priest that is touched by the feeling of our infirmities let me just let me just close it here no doubt we could re i could we could have lift up hands and say how many times where you've either walked in here maybe even when you've no doubt you've listened to a message well here you come and the spirit of god would move right down it doesn't matter if it's brother samuel who it is but god will move right down and he he'll minister right to your heart and it's a need that's in your life it's a need that maybe you didn't write it down for something for people to pray for because maybe it isn't something that you would want wrote down it's just something you've got in your heart you say lord i i've got a need when you begin to place that before him he is the high priest who's touched moved by the feeling of your infirmities we're not setting here today because in our own selves we're a bunch of strong people we're not sitting here today because we're saying man you know what i got it all made i've got it all under control i know if you do you you you need a real change because one thing you realize the closer we get to him the more like him we recognize more and more yeah i don't got it in control he's got it in control he's got me in control and lord i want you to be in full control and he'll come right by through his word he'll ride right up to our life and he'll take that word and begin to sound out to our lives why he's the high priest who's touched he's moved god is moved by ministering to our needs your sickness your trial your discouragement need of the holy ghost whatever it is every redemptive blessing it's met in him so no matter what it is when you begin to just put that before god and just begin to look to god he's moved god will take a man and move him in a channel to speak to your need it's not the man it's god it's god coming and ministering to our needs he's a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmity you come right where we're at brother branham would say it even just like this what we he can only intercede on what we confess that he is see god will come right here in the service just in a gathering that we have right here god can come right to your need and maybe you've got a need you're a little discouraged he'll come right to where you're at and he'll begin to speak to your heart to encourage you god will come to another one maybe they're in need of salvation he'll come right and minister right to their need but as god comes and moves throughout the diversity throughout of all the needs that we have here the greatest thing that we could do is to take the word that he's inspiring to our hearts that's letting us know he knows about me this is god right here this is god standing right at my pew this is god standing right in my heart the greatest thing that we can do is say lord jesus i receive it he's the high priest that's touched by the feeling of our infirmities what do i do confess it you see you can only confess it as it's revealed to you but when it comes by your way and there's things that you know how it is sometimes almost takes your breath away you're just stunned it's like how did this but god it's god it's god's ministry god's in control it's god moving throughout his body he's there to plead our cause whatever the need is this morning he's there for your need and he makes himself known that he's the living god not just words but the living god the living god let me read this quote to you and i will close here out of the true easter seal brother braham says he's praying he says now you just see if he's still the high priest that can be touched by the feeling of your infirmity i never seen you in my life you're a stranger to me i know nothing about you god knows you and if he can reveal to me by his holy spirit the resurrected christ who come here and give me a temporarily resurrection by my spirit that my spirit goes away now and his spirit comes in than to let you know whether he is alive or not he said i don't know you that's that's me me and my spirit we don't know you but he knows you but he wants to borrow my body to prove that he's the resurrected christ i'm so happy to loan it to him give it to him anything he can get out of it let the high priest ride this trail again let the holy spirit move amen let him move just moving throughout his body moving to minister to needs that what we have need of whether it's healing salvation deliverance whatever that it is when it's revealed to you for your need but samuel i i don't know if i could bring this to god if god's dealing with your heart on it if god's speaking to your life just try it give it to him just say lord i accept it if it's healing whatever it is he's already got it covered he's the high priest of his word if it's fear invite him invite him right right to your hand say lord dissolve this lord he'll come you believe that he's a living god and when he comes that way that's for you and i just to invite him he's riding writing throughout and ministering to our lives let's pray lord jesus lord how we just we thank you lord for your presence lord thank you lord in the simplicity of your word with lord we see that there were there were many we read in the scriptures even places that you came into that you could do nothing because of their unbelief we see that lord to where there were those who they smoked you on the head there leading the lamb going to calvary they never received any virtue but there were others lord that by the grace of god they recognized god was present in christ lord jesus now i pray heavenly father lord you're the same god right here this morning lord there's it's true there's many things we've witnessed that you do right here lord before us but lord we don't want to miss the lord when it's those things lord where there is there's healing deliverance lord god those receiving lord of the real seal of the holy ghost we don't want to lord in any way just take that for granted and lord i don't believe that we do but we don't want to do that lord we will take that lord and to recognize it's you moving right among us lord we've seen it lord not just on a sunday because you're not confined to sundays we've seen you do miraculous things right here on thursday nights lord we're lives lord a brother coming in here his hand covered all over with blisters just one and you begin

children and lord god is a faithful high priest you move you're moved to minister on the behalf of our needs lord you're the high priest of your own word then lord as believers we can come to you lord in that way when you speak so personally to our lives it's as though lord and it is that way just like abraham was sitting there in genesis 14 there was a personal meeting going on between you and him lord may our faith rise within that lord may we rise lord to now make that word our confession [Music] the lord you begin to intercede on behalf of your own word as that word is being spoken as being confessed lord out of our life you move down lord to intercede on behalf of that word lord throughout the building we can all look at our lives and say lord i want more of you we can look in our lives and see things lord god shortcomings and things we realize that in this life this flesh will never be perfect but we recognize the lord jesus that for the word to become material in our life and that strength moving in our life overcoming grace lord god it takes the high priest interceding on behalf of his word and lord jesus this is what we're offering lord this is what we're asking for is your word to be fulfilled in our life no matter where we're at lord in this journey we're asking for your word to be fulfilled in our life lord god if there's something lord that one is struggling with may they ask you this morning as it's put right personally to their heart may the lord recognize that you'd come down right to their heart you're not ashamed may they lord just take that word bring that confession lord god right across their lips lord jesus may they invite you lord god and just look to you you you intercede on behalf of your word granted lord in the name of the lord jesus christ amen
