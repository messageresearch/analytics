the mind the lord is weary but dear god your present lord to touch us lord and to strengthen us and to direct us we just pray that you'll come lord in a very very personal way tonight lord that you would just move among us in a special way we lord we don't have any restrictions we don't have any holds lord we just want you to come and be god tonight lord just move among us speak to our hearts in a very special way lord we just lord give ourselves to you lord ask that you would just have complete control in the service we pray for the glory of god in jesus name amen and amen amen if we'll turn in our bibles there to first corinthians chapter 13 and verse 4 and we want to just move back back into this of what we've been looking at and sometimes as you're looking at things you look at it you know don't know of a service maybe one point how it'll come out maybe it'll be a service maybe it'd be multiple services you don't know but we want to just continue to look at a portion here in this verse 4 here tonight just just moving a little bit further in that part here verse 4 it says charity suffereth long and is kind and we we've looked at that it's very it's patient charity envy it's not charity bonnet not itself is not up when we looked at this i've read this over and over and i want to just continue tonight we may get a little beyond this i don't know but i want to look at that second part there with charity envy if not and as it says here in the amplified bible love never is envious nor boils over with jealousy amen may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated truly when we look here and we look into the word of god there's not there's not one of us as our as a believer and as a child of god that when we come to hear the word of the lord that we don't desire and don't long to be more like him you know brother branham would put it in the message a statue of a perfect man and he would speak of many veterans that were even sitting there along with himself and he would reiterate those words that there's always a desire to go deeper there's always a desire to live closer and we we want the word as we've been looking at it we want the word to examine our lives as we see paul he dealt with we dealt with this where a corinthian church they had many supernatural things that were taking place they had they had the gifts in their midst and the gifts the nine spiritual gifts along with the five ministerial it should be in every local assembly but paul was very very cautious that that the people not only those who were there those who had come along but also even as there would have been uh undoubtedly uh others who had come into the fold and paul was very mindful to put them that the very key uh of a whole christian life is that of the love of god and we know that the love of god it's not a thing but it is the person and the love of god it is the holy ghost and we know that we cannot as we look in the scriptures we cannot have the love of the world and the love of the father at the same time so god as he deals with our life we we come into these places as we look and examine in our lives being examined by the word of god and looking at love and how that love is to operate and i just want to say it in this manner that love itself is not it's not an emotion love itself is is not just it's not just limited to a feeling but love itself is a is a person and love itself it is also a decision that a person makes it's not only a decision that you make but it's also that which is really part of the covenant like you have a covenant within your marriage there's decisions then that you make you could take certain angles you could take certain directions because as i'm speaking to those of you who are married ben and whatever more you you know and understand there are times that you don't have all of that happy tick ticky bubbly smooth fuzzy wuzzy feelings and everything else sometimes you have the things that you want to say but you recognize wait a minute there's a choice within this covenant and so there's always a choice that is always set before us and what we desire is that our choices and our lives would be so under the influence of the holy spirit we'd never want to take that for granted we don't take that the more and more even the longer that we walk with god the less that we we we should take for granted the less and we should be even that more more aware that god in every aspect of my life i want to be under the influence of the holy spirit that is simply even where we're listening to the word you're doing your devotion you're praying and i'm not and i'm not even saying to where that i believe that we have time alone in prayer with god but i'm talking about even as you sense things that can be coming up feelings or you're feeling a certain way but you're very mindful to know that lord i need your governance right now i want to bring this subject lord i don't want to let this reign and keep on going and moving around i want to bring it lord subject to the word i want to be under your influence and i i know i'm speaking to believers tonight that have this same witness that sometimes you don't even recognize that even when you're listening to the message you're reading in the scripture or even while we're sitting here and where the words being preached you have no sometimes even any real awareness but the holy spirit is coming with such a divine influence to bring such a separation and to really to empower our lives god knows even what's ahead of us even when we get out of service he knows what's ahead of us even tomorrow god knows all these things and this is why that even when we're feeding and to be a real feeder on the word we're not it's not so much that i'm trying to retain everything in my mind but it's to give myself and allow the holy spirit to sow just let him saturate your life so then there he's the one who's ever present to guide you when something comes up you you are prepared by him i think how brother branham said i've just been listening going over the adoption series this week and brother brown says sanctify yourself he said when you would go to speak to that person that maybe has done you wrong or this or they said sanctify yourself now he's pulling that from the scripture jesus said i sanctify myself for their sake he said sanctify yourself for you know not what you might say to that person you see it's the in in a part of adoption as a son and daughter of god you recognize as a son and daughter of god that's been born of the spirit of god you realize that this guy is not perfect but there is a perfection on the inside of a son and daughter of god that works to bring this guy in subjection and there's a growing there's a maturing within our life that takes place by experiences buy trials buy tests buy all of these things brother brandon simply put it you more he says the things that happen what happened but give him a monitor's back so the somebody says something about us and they might say something wrong brother braham said it just this simple and it is the rising of the sun he said that's where we get more love love itself when we look at these when we look even at these attributes that's in here these are these are attributes of that of the love of god that come on display in the midst of times of adversity or if i can say it when it doesn't rub us just exactly the right way and the us i'm talking about is not the son and daughter of god on the inside i'm still talking about that carnal part that we bring in subjection so this is where i want to just just take here and just try to if the lord will help us just bring this together tonight we we were looking at this part on the outside because not only are we dealing with those who are around us workplace and on and on and on that are not even at present time even within the economy of god as far as within maybe the local body or within uh the kingdom of god but yet we even in ourselves have have a way that we are to really to be an example and it's not something that we to have up here oh i'm to be an example sometimes you may have to be reminded hey you know you're supposed to be an example but to recognize that there is there is a light that shines within us paul would write it like this in the book of philippians that in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation among whom ye shine as lights so the only way you can shine it's with a real brightness it shows the darkness of the crookedness and the perverseness that is all around us but let our lives be a testimony that is that of a beacon of hope it's a light that's able to point someone in the right place because people don't want religion and i don't blame them i don't want it either people don't want to just come to you know church i hear brother branham even today is listening to the message and brother brahms is kind of going through the account of gabe you know the one who saw the sunrise and the or the sunset and he made his uh surrender to the lord and remember he said i'm not going to that church down there's a bunch of hypocrites brother brahman says you're even worse than the hypocrites that are going because you're not even making a stand you see people people seen all this they've seen they've seen hypocrisy they a religion in church and whatever more this is why brother brahms said even communism has rose up because of the hypocrisy of the church so we recognize that in these things uh proverbs 24 1 i just want to deal just a little bit here with the outside then we come in in into the body and he says in proverbs 24 1 be not thou envious against evil men neither to neither desire to be with them for their heart studieth destruction and their lips talk of mischief see this is who they are this is what they're about don't be envious of them their constant meditation and musing is i it's tiny's destruction verse 19 in the same chapter very very very fitting here in the midst of this chapter it tells you not what it tells you do not be envious then it takes verses and it deals with a wise man a wise man you know and how wisdom buildeth her house and it goes through all this then it breaks back forward now it breaks again in upon that of envy and it says in verse 19 fret not thyself because of evil men neither be thou envious at the wicked now god is never in his word these things that he speaks to us he's never it's never implied that this is just something that ah it's no problem for a believer ah it's no problem you know it's just no he's this is the word and remember the word always calls us in the midst of a situation of dying to ourselves because what it is is that there's a part that could you know go in this direction but now in love this is where the love of god comes in is our love is first and foremost to god and if we've got that in the right place then we'll have love in the right respects for others even that of evil men wicked men because the scriptures are true we're not just to be like the publicans or the pharisees they love the guys who love them is that right jesus said no be you therefore perfect as you're even as your father in heaven is perfect he's talking about the perfection of that life being inside of us so this admonition it says neither be thou envious at the wicked men for there shall be no reward to the evil man the candle of the wicked shall be put out every one of us and no matter what parts of life uh sometimes you ha you come in contact and you you you have to deal with people of the world and you you rub shoulders with people of the world it say in disregards it's like a smoke that's out there that's that's that's the devils that's the demons that's out there and just as you are influenced by the holy ghost remember there's an influence there as well satan is always he's always trying he's there to influence them and trying to lay a trap and so forth for you but let me just say in this time we want to make sure we're not caught in their web the bible says return evil with good pray for them who despitefully use you sometimes those are easier to quote when you're not going through that but when you're going through it then that's where the rubber meets the road see god knew those things that's a part of the dying that's a part where of bringing that flesh subject that that man's subject to the word you see these are things that even in the world i think as i look back and brother branham is dealing with things uh incurred exodus and who do you say this is in 1964 and throughout the message he's dealing with things where you find that communistic spirit moving in of integration and all those things and brother adam he deals with it not only on a level between races but then he ties it into the ecclesiastical realm and who do you say this is and third exodus and he's dealing because remember the lambda came up had two horns civil and ecclesiastical you see these things don't work separately they work they work intertwined in a measure and so what everything that you know as it begin to deal you see even the things that you know brother brandon made this statement he said if they were slaves he said i'd be down there fighting as well but then he refers to the black minister who got up and he told the people he says i'm ashamed of you because he says you have better schools than what they have but you see what it is it's not the people it's a spirit that came in to stir up division for what purpose listen to me now to take the focus off what is really the most important and brother brand tells us in the third exodus that's the new birth that they would be that they would come to that place because you see you say well how could that hinder because god remember even as we started on sunday looking at the holy spirit will not come to a temple that's harboring those things in its life you see this is something that goes beyond it's out there in the spirit realm of how satan himself he's a strategist he works in a manner to try to place these things in to sow division to sow hatred and let me bring it down to you and i where we're at right now we're in a time these are things that's been going on now for years and some of the articles and things that i went back and just just thinking of some of these things and i went back to even certain things even back there in 2015 and it's even further back there and it deals with algorithms and things that are on the internet to where you look at one thing and there might be an article that you're reading and then you'll find what it does is then algorithm is to try to predict your thought pattern and gauge you to where now it starts offering you this it starts offering you this you know how it is open up your phone you'll find things sometimes you haven't even been looking at you just been talking come on now and it picks up on it and it suggests hey you might like these similar items well what happens it happens the same way with the things that you watch it could be things about government and everything else now if you find that on the conservative side you find it on the liberal side as well when you say what's going on it's trying to sow entrench and bring it to a place to say evil people evil people and then it's moving in such a place here oh my how can this and why do they think this and why and you see what it's doing it's pointing just an enmity and a hatred that's what it's doing it's building a hatred and a resentment and a divisiveness what's it doing it's vexation it's envy you see this is why the bible says we are not ignorant of satan's devices hallelujah this is why we must have the holy spirit and i say it like this even to the young people as you go into school those things are like petri dishes for liberals i'm just going to say it clearly they're full of the garbage of the bacteria and things of this of thinking you say what do i do you pray you said god give me the wisdom to go in there and to get what i need and to leave the rest of the stuff behind amen we need the protection and the leadership of the holy spirit let me tell you god ain't taken back by this age but he's here and he continues to increase his power his authority his influence when the enemy comes in like a flood i the lord will raise a standard against him amen we're not ignorant of how satan wants to work so not be envious you see because satan's objective even as we if i can tie this point up is where we've seen last week you've seen asaph getting off track he lost his footing he began to look and it began to be envious envious beings boiling up he began to have such a how can this be and how can that be he got off track it took him away from his god-given ground but god helped him to see if there's one thing that i could say this is why we must have the the wisdom of god and this is what if if science you see satan's a copycat he's not a creator if satan let me just tell you what the algorithms are i know algorithms that deals with math but in these things i just talked about that's on the web and how it studies you there's nothing more than satan that's laying right there to try to ensnare is that right this is why as we i did say we we need that discernment of the holy spirit in this hour and i say it in this manner he's a copycat then notice how those algorithms will predict the thoughts what about the living word of god the word of god is quick and powerful sharper than any two-edged sword it's a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart that's what we want we want the living word to come down and discern our thoughts that maybe there's things that were entertaining there's things that maybe is entertaining us things that's keeping and eating us we want the living word to make himself real and discern that in our life and say hey don't be entangled in that let it go focus on me we need the living word of god proverbs 27 4 wrath is curable and anger is outrageous but who is able to stand before envy i want you to remember this rose in heaven and it was put out well envy when we deal with this i want to just look at these contrasting parts because of this same word envious it deals with to be heeded or to boil with envy a hatred or an anger and you realize love and hatred cannot coexist is that right you see sometimes when we look at these things like with hatred and you study in the scriptures in uh in first john four it is and it deals it ties together hatred with blindness because a person that they're blind hatred is blind it blinds and this is why listen these are some things i never ministered on it here but when you look at it there's sometimes that a person can get into temporary blindness and they need the help from the lord because those feelings there should be something as a son and daughter of god you say not gonna stay here you can try to come back i'm not gonna stay here you're standing there on the word don't entertain it but resist the devil but how do you resist the devil submit yourself first to god then resist the devil and he'll flee from you envy so your envy is to be heated or boil with envy a hatred or an anger now here's the contrasting part i want to look at just bringing these two together here and moving it in into the body it's in a good sense it's to be zealous in the pursuit of good so the contrast to that of envy is that of a godly zeal when you study these words we're looking at it it deals the charity envy if not it deals the focus in that scripture is is that it that it is not uh when charity envy if not it's not to be that uh that of a wrong anger a jealous anger uh that which is boiling up you know just boiling up but rather we it needs such a balance because in the scripture we are admonished the same word where i just read that that particular uh greek word is also it is used where paul will now have the people covet earnestly the best gifts desire the best gifts so there's a part it's got to move in the right direction and i know that we can look at that and say well that's pretty simple but we want to make sure that our zeal is tempered and governed by charity because our zeal could be right on the mark but yet it's so far off then it actually falls what what looks like hey man this is righteous this is this is this is right on and god says that's envy so we want this is where we want the holy spirit to see what deals with our life to guide us and direct that zeal in the right measure because envy let me just say it like this if envy is a part of your life and that's what's still known about your address you need to get the holy ghost if you enjoy listen if you enjoy fussing if you enjoy stewing you can't take correction i'm gonna preach you blow up and you've got every little excuse and you need to be born again i'm not even talking about you dealing with the carnal nature you need the power of the holy ghost to change you on the inside and give you a power that's able to bring that man into subjection to the word [Music] are you with me this is why we're not the same creation patched up you can't put new wine in old bottles it'll blow it up so when we deal with this envy has no partner believer if this is something that is a part and said these things are a part of that life then we listen this is not condemnation but yet i want the word to sting very deeply to a place of real conviction and say god is this where i've been living where i can't take correction or i can't best or i can't that right if that's where we're living we want to be honest because this is an hour we need to be honest and i'll tell you as a parent or whatever more if you're not honest with that that spirit will work through your whole family if you can't stand correction you'll find it come all the way right down through the family right through the children it'll come out the same way we need to know that we know that we know that there is that part on the inside envy has no part in me and i don't plan on making no pact with it even when i've got a time to have a right has no pardon a believer but you see we want a real godly zeal directed from a heart of love you see it's a zeal that's directed with faithfulness faithfulness that we we recognize yes come into church yes you know as we we support the local work and all all of those things that go on but it's a faithfulness to every part of the word i don't know how many times over the years where you know i've talked to people who can they can swallow camels but they get choked on gnats i don't know how that works i know that's in the scripture and i know jesus referring to that you know when they how they would process you know their their their grapes and things like that but i i know that to be true now look at paul paul would say it like this i got to get moving he said it like this i am jealous over you with a godly jealousy that godly jealousy was not something that sought to take something from them neither was it something that sought to run them down but remember that godly jealousy was calling them to maintain what god has done in your life god's desire was you be zealous in your own walk you'll be zealous in your own life paul's godly the godly jealousy was a zeal for the body that the body would walk and maintain that liberty that god had brought to its life galatians 4 18 you know paul dealing with those who came and zealously affected the galatian church and wanting to want to bring them back from grace into law law being that oh you got to do this and follow this at this time of the year and do this but paul brings along and says they were separating you that you might zealously affect them but he says in verse 18 to our admonition it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing we want to be zealously affected the bible said iron sharpeneth iron the bible said that we are to them as the more so uh let us not forsake to assemble ourselves together even the more so as you see that day appropriate approaching right provoking one another unto love this is a kind of provoking is a life that a life that's left it's not a provoking that comes as an irritant it's that which stirs up in a godly manner not somebody saying brother bill don't you want to be like me nope no brother bill's a real believer he would catch that no he don't want to be that way verse 13 of titus 2 look for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great god and our savior jesus christ who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works this is the kind of zeal that it permeates a believer's life it's a zeal we want to please him it's a zeal of good works it's not something we're trying to manufacture no the sheep does not manufacture wool it only bears the wool it's our life we're yielding god's working in our life so it's alias unto good works now to think of this of here of where we are and god that god would open to you and i even the understanding that god has opened to our lives is quite a responsibility and some of this kind of almost borders it because all this ties together it almost comes over into that of pride but you can see how this would work in james 3 13 james asked the question who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you let him show out of good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom but if you have bitter envying and strife in your hearts glory not and lie not against the truth he's dealing with the body that's what we're in now working within that of the body so the wisdom notice is letting it be known that if you've got bitter and envy and strength in your hearts notice this isn't even anything that's said outwardly but if it remains in the heart it'll eventually show itself whatever's in the heart will come out and he's saying do not lie against the truth why truth itself is not a doctrine truth is a person this is why you can have people say well i've got the truth i've had the truth and they don't have the life of the truth or the spirit of truth why because there's it's a compound part it's not just truth as far as doctrine and teaching and word but truth is a person jesus said i am the truth the life and the way and the holy ghost is the spirit of truth who will lead and guide us into all truth is that right so what god that knowledge that uh unfolding that revelation here he's letting it be known that real true revelation it's coupled with humility it's a make it's a it's a wisdom that has meekness with it its meekness is that which is a gentleness that which gives place to that word this is where as he's describing if this is allowed to reside the holy spirit you take its flight it's greed and it moves out you see what comes with revelation revelation itself it come is coupled with humility let me just keep reading it'll it'll lay it all out here in this this verse 15 this wisdom descendeth not from above but it's earthly sensual and devilish you can always examine even things that you might see as truth you can even examine it in your homes and everywhere else examine the the influence and then you'll catch what spirit's trying to motivate you you'll catch you'll know where is the spirit coming from it might be wisdom what's wisdom wisdom is things that you could see oh this would be helpful or i need to lay this in i need to lay that in but to recognize where is it coming from what's it motivating because even if it's truth but if it's not done in love it's no good is that right hey there's been many there's been truth sometimes that's been preached in churches and and people have walked away and it was because of the delivery are you with me it was not the truth oh they were offended because of truth no it's not because they were offended because of the truth because sometimes you find those people later on and it's not they were not offended in the truth it's the delivery are you with me this is why paul said speaking the truth in love that doesn't mean spraying powdered sugar when you speak either because sometimes there's a time you need to know where you stand is that right there's things listen there's things that god has revealed to you that you might see that somebody else may not be further along but don't look down on them what do i do be an example and remember where god has brought you from and the same god you never gave it to yourself god revealed that to you so we can think about that right there then you have a heart of mercy then you come back to a place to pray for the god who revealed it to you and made it known to you and here you stand now that same god is able to stand there and make it known to that brother or sister and if god chooses to you you use you you want to make sure that you're a vessel that's free of envy that's not boiling up like oh i've been waiting to tell you this charity if not for where envying and strife is there is confusion and every evil work is that right you see the holy spirit it brings things in line and subject to the word it brings things in harmony now james goes on that says this wisdom that is that is from above is first pure it's peaceable gentle easy to be entreated full of mercy good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace my my my my mind it's just hard not to not to just elaborate on many of these parts but we want to be sowers of righteousness is that right now you know many times there's some not many times but sometimes when i'm in the middle of studying i don't read a lot of other uh i only read or i'll watch something uh if i feel that the holy spirit has directed me to pick this up or pick that up or look at this right here sometimes i'll go and i'll and i maybe will look at i have different programs and i look at a commentary it's just something sometimes it's pooled because remember we we are people of truth are you with me and god has given us a filter to bring truth through and and begin to ponder in one of these parts i'm going to read something here from from adam clark uh the commentator from years and my some time ago but i want to read this it so struck me some weeks or time ago when i read this because this is the discernment that you and i even in the time and the hour that we're living in we really need the discernment of the holy spirit in everything because let me just say the word that god has given what god has revealed to you and i of some of these things we're just reading in james it's it's a word that when we receive it in the right way we recognize uh how how precious and that we are so undeserving of the mercy and the grace of almighty god but we recognize that what god has opened to us it was it's not that our that our knowledge or our mind would be built up you see brother brahm tells us in the church age book when he talks of luther's day he said there were men in that time he said there was so much truth that was released in that age to revolutionize the world but but what happened is there were many men he said that were not hearing the truth that it might be a practical outworking in their life they were hearing it only to be able to take positions and debate and to argue and they weren't hearing it in the right way you see it's got to be within that of the right heart and direct unite this is why when brother brahm says you see them under that influence he said they are objects to be pitied now look down on are you with me and sometimes where the hang up comes with love i i know you can hear this people will throw this out i understand it's in the scripture it's in the message love is corrective we understand that but for some people that's all they know about love he's cutting people down hacking them down and oh no no nobody's telling me i won't cut nobody down sometimes that's the only part that they know that's only one part of it but there needs to be wisdom to know even in that correction sometimes that correction is not even you saying something to that person it's you having a correct spirit and a correct attitude and being a correct example amen you see these are things that even as we go in our journey with the lord we learn because sometimes we can be geared a certain way are you with me sometimes some people are more geared a certain way than others this one listen listen to this i found this very tremendous adam clark writes it like this he says many persons cover a spirit of envy and uncharitable unchair i don't have it up there but just listen a spirit of envy and uncharitableness with the name of godly zeal and tender concern for the salvation of others now remember he says they cover a spirit of envy they find fault with all their spirit is a spirit of universal seriousness that means severely critical of others none can please them and everyone suffers by them this is envy a critical spirit but notice notice it's cloaked under oh the salvation oh i want there's i want i want this to be with them i want this to be right but the reality is nobody can please them they run down everybody they cut down everybody if there's only one person in the building that's righteous god has to take a back seat to them because they have established their own righteousness you see the blessing of the message that god has given you and i is a tremendous blessing but it must be operated by heart of humility because if not it works to cut down and remember it's just like as you see sometimes people that are coming on you do not when your toddler is walking down and they fall and they're learning to walk you don't whip them they're learning to walk when you correct them is when you've told them don't touch that lamp and they go ahead and they touch that lap that's when correction comes that's how god deals with us god doesn't correct us when we're learning to walk he's there to guide us as we're learning to walk but correction comes as we learn to walk and then there's things he says don't go here don't do this don't do that then as a faithful father he comes and corrects us is that right you see it it comes to a place of such uh where we're it's so severely critical and these are things that uh you know adam clark goes on to write he says these destroy more souls by tithing mint and cumin than others do by neglecting the weightier matters of the law such persons have what is termed and very properly too sour godliness i like that when i read that i said i could i see where i see where this is remember when jesus stood there in the temple they had become so engrossed with the temple with their creeds that jesus could stand there and what was spoken in the book of psalms he could declare the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up it was for their own it had nothing to do with him it was about them are you listening this is why as as paul would write in romans 10 2 speaking of the jews he says i bear them record that they have a zeal of god look how close this is they have a zeal of god but not according to knowledge we want that governance of the holy spirit i'm just going to just going to skip here just a little bit to just just trying to get to some places you know paul had to deal with some things let me just refer to it without reading it he had to deal with some things where you had individuals in the church that um and i say in that corinth some i'm a palm of cephas i'm of this and and it really didn't matter you're not of that man it's god that man is just like this microphone god's used him but you see the spirit god it's spirit of envying god among them well i'm of this and i'm of that and i'm of this but the thing that paul was bringing him back to and where it should come down you most importantly you're to be of god we're to be of god it's not about men if god is there's a man or somebody that's been used of god to bless you remember thank god for the man being yielded and getting out of the way but remember worship god amen god god is able to use you know sometimes you hear things where people say oh my never heard so and so preach like that they never changed how they preach but maybe you changed how you listen to them you see these are things sometimes it's carnal things that move around and paul's telling them the spiritual part of it don't allow those envyings and things to come among us now he deals with this here in the book of galatians and he and he goes through it here and he speaks of how in verse 16 of galatians 5 let me just pick up there he says walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh those are some of the things we're saying at the beginning for the flesh flesh lusteth against the spirit not lordy spirit capital s the holy spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that you cannot do the things you would it's just like look there's certain things that you can be reading you can maybe feel yourself oh my goodness how can they say this okay you can feel yourself start boiling up i'm just saying it for you because i know there's certain little things there this is where you have to say wait a minute here you got to get away from this are you with me you got to get away from this because which because what it is you're it's obedience to the spirit of god the spirit of god is calling you hey don't immerse yourself in those things hey don't give yourself to those things is that right it's calling you away from that even when maybe maybe your wife has said something and you know what she could have did anything jumped up and down on your toes or whatever more but today was the day that hurt and it wasn't maybe she did anything different it's how you're taking things are you with me now what happens there's a point i'm gonna preach there's a part about you that i gotta set this i gotta lay this in line right sometimes we failed in that i say amen for you but it doesn't get away from the spirit of god calling us back and say you shouldn't have done it like that you were wrong you were wrong you go make that right vice versa wife husbands on and on and on is that right thank god we got a conviction on the inside of the holy ghost that's what you're to rejoice in thank god for the conviction on the inside and to know that that same one that convicts you say god continued to teach me lord let me be more sensitive it's not you watching like oh i ain't going to make this mistake again i'm really going to study so i don't make this mistake again no the thing is walk in the spirit because you're going to all of us you're going to come into times you're going to come into this time but walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh now as paul goes on he writes he speaks of the fruit of the spirit and he deals with in verse 22 the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such there is no law and they that are christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust thereof the affections and lust are still in the flesh but you've crucified it are you with me it isn't that it went away no right in here is where the change comes this is where the new birth comes the real crucifixion then it's then dying out to south now what is it it brings that old man into subjection the life of that old man he's gone but it brings this body this flesh that spirit what is there it brings it in subjection to the word of god this listen to me brother and sister this is why brother braham says it like this i think in faith is the victory he said that which used to rule you you now rule it it doesn't mean that there are times with this hominin this might not try to this might not try to rise let me tell you this is why we've got to stay under the influence of the holy spirit it's not a risk oh i don't want to go after the world i'm afraid i'll go back to the world that fear is passed from you as a believer when you pass from death unto life but the only fear if i can say holy reverence is i don't want to displease him and that's where there's a tension in your life i don't want to displease him because you still realize those things the genes the tendencies but this is where we keep it covered with the blood this is where we stay under the influence of the holy ghost this is why paul says in verse 25 if we live in the spirit you're born of the spirit of god you're living in the spirit you're living you're living in that battle in the holiest of holy you're living there this man this inner man is living in eternity you've already passed from death unto life if we live in the spirit let us also walk see this is part paul's dealing with the believers that your life not just where you where you to live as a christian born of the spirit of god but you're to let your life be regulated by the shekinah glory of god this is why paul would come in verse 26 and say let us not be desirous of vainglory you can see how the pride and this works together within thee provoking one another envying one another i say truly as the body you see god is using somebody we rejoice you know it's just like you you can't you you can't explain it you know even when it comes to preaching or singing special one person might preach once in a while the person preaches maybe quite a bit that's god that's in god's choosing that's how god uses it's same thing when it comes to singing special it's the same things and this is where what our when our the real zeal is that god my heart's desire is that your body would be blessed and be edified lord i mean does anybody in here think about lord today i'm gonna go hurt my body i'm gonna hit me in the in the top of the head i'm gonna nobody thinks like that hi we love ourselves too much right do you want to be comfortable i need lumbar support let me heat it i need cool i need come on now it's like a love-hate relationship but you see these are things brother brown goes into it and gives such direction and christ the mystery and i don't have time to read all this but it's there to refer to and brother branham lets us know this is i'm going to say it like this this is such a common quote but sometimes i think it's become too common you see brother and sister things brother brown lets us know he says satan won't let you stay a big sweet group we've seen that over the years you've seen that you've seen that but somehow or another we drift away and this isn't just remembering words or act like this like a robot no no no there's so much admonition in the word of god it should be such a desire that within our life brother brahman says how that satan he said he'll come in he'll shoot everything he can he's trying to do all he can he says even if he has to bring somebody in and they become a critic and he shoots them full of poison the brother brahm tells us even how to approach that don't ostracize that person are you with me they've been right here and maybe here they're going around here and going around there and going around there brother but here's what he does say see these are this is the advice he does give don't take sides with it the first thing you can do is shut it down it don't matter who it is we shut it down when it when he comes against the word of god when it comes to try to start putting doubt against somebody else in the body of christ that's not the holy ghost you don't need to be a prophet you don't even need to be that deep of a believer are you with me he said but here's what he says you stay right loving kind and sweet to one another pray for the man notice pray for the man that he'll be saved too or whoever it is pray for him but just stick one with another you know what stick means you're sticky but it's not the bad sticky it's like the little bears i heard brother graham talking about this morning they got in that molasses bucket and the little bear couldn't even open his eyes his eyes were stuck shut he got away from that tent and his brother and his mother started looking on him right he was all covered over with sweetness right this is why brother he says it like this he says if the brother you think he's a little wrong or the sister say lord don't let me never have the root of bitterness spring up brother you're not saying you're a believer oh brother shane you don't ever have to worry about the root of bitter bitterness no no no this is where the scripture says let all bitterness be put away from you situations things will come that can try to create bitterness is that right but here say lord don't ever let me have the root of bitterness spring up cause look look how this is because it'll affect him and it'll take christ right out of my life notice what the prayer what the real part about is i don't want to affect my brother who i think is wrong it's okay help me lord jesus this is where we lord help me because brother brown calls it he says the poison acids of malice jealousy envy all those things it'll run him he said from the tabernacle it'll running from your life see when you grieve the holy spirit the dove you're sealed to the day of redemption but that dove goes right out there and there's something as you as a believer because remember let me say this to scripture the bible says you are complete in him you cannot be a new creation without him right and when he pulls back his presence and his influence from your life as a believer you reckon something's not right laura what what did i say something lord did i entertain something a thought wrong why because he's sensitive to his presence it's his presence that you delight in it's his presence that you depended on is that right you value his presence this is why the scripture will go on i'm closing let us walk honestly in romans as in the day not in writing and drunkenness not in chambering and wantonness not in strife and envy i i like this you know this in many parts of the scripture it deals with put ye on the lord jesus christ and make not provision in other words occasion for the flesh to fulfill the luster up here's the son and daughter of god you're reigning and you're no weakness you're not walking oh i don't got no weakness no the holy ghost don't have no weakness the son and daughter of god on the inside you don't have no weakness but you also know the land that you're in has weakness is that right just like i know that this land around here in sheffield it's prone to flooding you know you think you're below sea level it's weaknesses you're aware of it right so you you're not gonna you you're not gonna make provision like wow just let it go but you are mindful of it you recognize these things and you put on this means to sink into the lord jesus christ sink into that he's it's mourn him this is where love fading by it's fading back into the love of god paul would write it in the same way above all things put on sink into charity which is the bond of perfectness what is it it's something that here even brother bill after when we've been born again and for years i could call my brother bill brother bill serving the lord for many years brother gomez different others and i can ask him have you stopped sinking in or putting on the lord jesus they would say no i'm learning more and more and more and more and it's all surrendering brother dave sits surely on and on you we could keep going you see this is where it's in us brother braham says the holy ghost it's in you to abstain from these things it's in you to shun shun evil and flee to righteousness he says it's in you all malice hatred strife envy and so forth come away from it for that'll take him from your heart another place he says he's talking about hear us seeing the city he said i believe it's getting ready he said to come into view this is the ending part of 65 the middle part he says this admonition live humble live loving love one another don't never get nothing among you if you see something coming up in your heart against somebody get it out of there right then but you know what that requires honest reflection in the word to recognize lord i need you and when you see something coming up remember don't let satan try to tremble it you're a believer your desire is just to please god and you see that coming up you stand as a son of god and say this is on ground that i'm in possession of as a son of god and i'm not going to give any place to the devil is that right i'm not going to give any retreat to him you see something coming up in your heart get it out real quick amen this is what requires honesty with god let me just tell you something god don't look at you and say my goodness aaron i can't believe you how could you how could you feel that way about brother samuel how how could you he's a high priest he's one who's there to listen not on the other side of the curtain that says whoa wow my goodness well who are you wow no no he's a faithful and merciful high priest he's the true one he's there to intercede on our behalf do you realize sometimes as a high priest it's not that we are always there oh lord i've sinned again lord i need another sin offering that's for the high priest is lord i've sensed this coming up in my life lord god help me lord jesus and he goes to minister on our behalf as our high priest oh my don't you love him let's stand if you wouldn't mind if you're you have to sit you go ahead and sit i some of you i know it's it's a little hard and i always say that but i want you always feel feel that comfort brother brown makes this statement here and i thought of this as i came to these points some time ago brother branham you're aware he stands there brother brown is just he's honest before the people brother brown stands there in the message the word made flesh in the india trip and he asked the people in that message and then it's followed that night as he preaches the jubilee year and brother branham he's just come back from india and brother braham has seen where how things are over there he's seen some american women to where when there was um a little indian boy he said that it just needed just needed a meal he said was you know feet was swollen and things he said and he asked these american women he said and they turned their noses and walked on away brother graham got to looking at that and they got to looking at some other things and brother brown he asked the church he says i want you to pray for me he said because i've developed a critical spirit that haunts at me he'll say it like this in that message he says i recognize this is what he calls that critical spirit he says i recognize the other day a selfish spirit coming up in me wanting to tell everybody they're wrong now love is corrective is it not but what brother branham is dealing with as he goes into that part he says i wasn't coming out here and correct and being critical he said but it was in my heart he said i seen you see this woman dressed in merle and morrowind and it's in his heart how can she dress that way you see that part of it even though how she's dressed is wrong are you with me he's not saying oh you know it's not like this worldly out here oh we just love everybody we just love everything we just love liars they don't love they're only tolerant of things that goes along with them it's all emotion it ain't love it's not talking about oh we just take everything in that's not what it is what he's recognizing is is he can't do any good for even that woman who needs she needs to meet the lord jesus not just because of what she's wearing that's wrong because every man that looked with honor and lust after she's also guilty in the act of adultery it's just so what is he doing it's to think of her soul spirit that's motivating or a man that maybe is wrong in his and going about in his way but if it's not right in here it can never be helped you first have got to have the right feeling in here see this is why we need the help this is why we need the help of the holy spirit this is why when brother brandon stood in that cafeteria in toledo and remember he looked over there and that woman here she was you know drunk and you know the way she was dressed and hear a policeman standing in a gambling machine and you you know the story most of you do and brother braham said oh god how can you let this how can you let this stand and god said come here now mind you this was not brother branham's first or second year in serving the lord okay this has been many years but you see sometimes the things listen to me brother brown tells us in these other places he said sometimes he said if you only knew he told the people in word made flesh india trip he said if you only knew the things i've had to sit and i had to listen to things that i've had to see things sometimes that could so you look at them lord have mercy the things sometimes you have to hear or see and this but you see what happens is is to be able even if god calls a man into that position he still takes god to keep him in a place to where he doesn't lose his mind and to also hold the balance to recognize this is still the inheritance of god to recognize that that woman or that man what they need is a meeting with jesus hallelujah that's why we say god we need such a such a balance we want a godly zeal but we don't want that like what we read here at the end where it's a seriousness that it's critical of everybody under the pretense of all i want to help people and it's everything is just this is wrong and this is wrong and this should be you know eventually where that leads to they start questioning their wife their wife starts questioning them where does it lead to it never stops because there's not a foundation this is why we say god search me search me that's every day of our life god keep me lined up let's pray heavenly father lord we we we appreciate you lord dear god i i think lord that stand here lord and deliver lord those things that you placed on my heart lord it just oh god i stand here with a even a greater realization [Music] of my need for you [Music] lord i i've come to realize and i know that there's veterans i speak to more that are out here there's other lord brothers and sisters they've come to find this too maybe some lord haven't realized it but may they they recognize god the effect of being under the word at first lord would want to pray if there's one that hasn't met you in that way that god that maybe these things are are just it's still their life lord maybe they come to church maybe lord is seemingly a pretty good person but i pray that lord may they may they have such an honesty with you to say god i want the love of god in my heart i want to be changed i want to be transformed and lord for the lives that you've transformed we depend on you lord we don't just lord live in the spirit we're to walk in the spirit [Music] maybe lord recognize the value lord as the reading the word of god coming to the house of god being in prayer lord when we talk about a personal walk there's a personal upkeep lord if if one of us if we didn't keep up with just the natural hygiene of life we would become very offensive with things we have to keep up with lord feeding ourselves and other things how much more on a spiritual level when jew would write with admonition keeping yourselves in the love of god praying in the holy ghost lord maybe just lord maybe tonight they can just recognize that the value of them maybe even as they're driving into work or they're getting ready lord maybe they're at their home they're getting really going to work say god order my steps this day [Music] guide me lord jesus you know what lays before me but guide me father and lord to having that confidence in the word as we're listening to the word the word is dismantling holes it's it's tearing down strongholds it's casting away spirits lord that would want to influence oh god we want to be under your influence pray that father you just lord continue to minister to our hearts to every need lord as we're gathered here we're just we're just looking to you lord we need you and we love you father we our lives would live that reflection charity and be it's number one help us father i pray in the name of jesus christ amen amen lead us in a song worship [Music] amen this is your house [Music] this is your house oh this is your house we dedicate this temple to let your glory fill this sanctuary yes lord jesus yes lord

blessed be the name of the lord oh jesus be the lord of all yes jesus [Music] jesus [Music] my [Music] [Applause] [Music] we want to sink into him [Music] [Applause] amen [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] oh don't you appreciate him hey man he's so good to us amen is so wonderful i had a prayer request here and i know did you mention about sister brenda's mom if your mom had a heart attack yeah i just had got a text here that her mom sister brenda spade her mom had a heart attack and asked that we would just keep her in prayer brother dave chris would you mind come and dismiss us a prayer and also take this request her name is sharon musselman we just want to pray for sister brenda's mother amen sharon amen they sure do appreciate you [Music] your tenderness of your holy spirit lord
