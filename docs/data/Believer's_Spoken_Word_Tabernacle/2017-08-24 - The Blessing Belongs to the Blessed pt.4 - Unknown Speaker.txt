Lord we just pray that you'll just combine speak to our hearts Lord Lord God let us be hidden behind the cross smooth father God may you just be lifted up Lord ministered every life in every heart Lord every knee Lord Oh God we just commit ourselves in your hands look have your way now father we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ let's turn to Ephesians 1 good to be in the house of the Lord Jesus chapter 1 read just that portion of Scripture here are the places tonight we want to come back and we want to look in these steal water knowing that sheep and sheep sheep will drink from still waters where they can they can see their reflection he meant and we want to look into the Word of God and see ourselves even more clearly amen you know that's that's really important when you think of the slave who when they went and looked upon that plantation you're familiar with the story there was a character that stood out that they wanted to buy but he couldn't be bought as far as this right here he had been sold but who he was could not be bought good he couldn't be bought out for anything and when you look at that what was it that cost him remember they said does he have it easier you know movies paraphrase was it easier in life that he had better milk did he sleep in a better place it had nothing to do with his physical surroundings or whether it was he knew his daddy was a king back and that that personal understanding and knowledge of truth it had such an effect on his conduct and that's the thing I believe is all my heart that is sons and daughters of God the more and more as we're looking in the Word of God I'll tell you as we're looking at this and letting God minister to our life sin it's delivered to know who we are [Music] verse 3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in crime according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he has made us accepted in the beloved we'll just let you be seated and we'll continue read here may God bless the reading of his word let's continue here in verse 7 in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an Aaron being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that's a very weighty and powerful statement there at the end and I want to just begin to look at a little bit of that tonight in that latter part that being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will let me just go on here in verse 12 down to verse 14 that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ in whom ye also trusted after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance unto the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory when we look here in these scriptures we begin to recognize that all that is spoken here it is God's solemn choosing it's God's doing we understand that it wasn't as we've looked at election and I may mention this some months ago when I had last time we spoke here on a Thursday that election and choosing is not like we remember picking teams in elementary school where you kind of get to know who can kick the kickball who can throw it who can catch it and you know you kind of avoid you you kind of avoid that they kind of get picked last and some of us may have been picked last down here we would even be when it would maybe even come to church standard or what would be considered to be high standard moral people be picked would have been picked last but God in his choosing is not choosing based on what he sees now God doesn't even elect and choose based on your decision that he had foreknowledge of your decision that's not even election you recognize that's still Arminianism that's not election but election is before he was even God he chose you before there was even a decision you made because if God chooses you based on him knowing your decision it still is you had something to do with it but election is not based on even God looking and saying I know what they're going to do but God does know what his children are going to do because they are his children they will respond to him as he makes himself known to them so the choosing of God when we're looking at this in the entirety of the scripture and brother Branham addresses this he says sometimes predestination he says sometimes people get the wrong thought on it as though that it's God that's gonna just do everything and pull you through a pipe but he said that's not the view of predestination at all predestination is even when you look at a seed that you plant out here it's already within it to be a tomato plant the Sun and the water coming upon it does not make it a tomato plant it only at the cent of water at the feeling of the warmth it begins to move and release the germ within it that was always there and so God Himself sending his word sending his life sending his presence God knows where each and every one of us were at he didn't lose one of us even in the bed of time where we would be in even when you look even sometimes in the greatness of the situations the mess and everything else but God himself knew and God knows that beneath in that seat though yet you'd be a seed in that seed is germ life are you with me in rising of the Sun the Prophet said the life is there in that seed but it needs the quickening power of God to come upon it to release that seed so then here God moves by our way but yet God can't believe for us that's where the scripture says of the gospel of our salvation when you heard it you recognize it to be the word of truth you said I believe that but yet even in the believing of that right there you've drawn to something it's something that begins to move upon your life and there's a warmth there's the scent of water it's something that begins to unfold to you this is what I'm looking for you begin to even say this is true yet you you don't even know what truth is but you begin to say this is it and here God is moving the whole time yet he won't believe for us but he stirs up and by moving of his word upon our life here then we come to a place and say I believe Lord and we start walking and you start walking in the word and as you're walking in the word the word is sanctifying the word is cleansing you you find things begin to move and drop away from your life what is that that's you yielding to God's voice and it's God sovereignly doing the work amen when we talk about sanctification it's walking on in you know sometimes people come to a place and they just want to stand still when I'm gonna get rid of this and I'm gonna get rid of this you have to keep walking in that light you've got to keep walking towards him you don't ever come to a place where you stand still and start well I'm gonna get rid of this and I'm gonna get rid of this let the Spirit of God that deals with your heart to get rid of this lay that aside that is him speaking lay aside every way every sin that does so easily beset us it's a blessing to even be stirred to desire to walk past those things that's God moving in your life what must I do yield to his voice and walk to him and you'll find that the same one who calls you strays your heart of that same one saint of as you cleanses you and that same one as you keep moving he brings you to a place that he himself remains known to you you are accepted in the beloved and you are always accepted but you and I have to come to that realization that I am accepted in him I was accepted in him before the foundation of the world I was identified there in the Lamb that was slain the lamb was slain with me and mind oh that God has done every little detail has been done with you and I in mind all the way through this great book of redemption this is God he's pouring out detail in this hour that you are not living in and how the Spirit of God moves upon the word to do what gives strength to you and I it's rapture and grace it's God that is providing for you and I strengthened this hour by pulling up these things right out of scripture that speak of the mystery of your life it's God's work it's God's work it's God moving in his time so what do we have to do wield to it is that right so here we are in the message adoption the Prophet says it like this he says he says see what kind of an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will before he was a Papa before he was gone before he was a savior before he was a healer before all this he predestinated put the lamb's name on the book look down through by his foreknowledge and seen your name and put it on there - we are identified when the Lambs name was put on our name was put on our identification is in the lamb who is the lamb it's God revealed from word to flesh it's Almighty God the deity that was in heaven came down to earth when we were could not man could not redeem himself you could not redeem yourself I could not redeem myself but God Himself the whole plan wins back to himself that there is nothing there's no one can do this but him let me say this very clearly there's only one who is responsible for the very perfection and the rapturing of his pride and that is him he is personally committed God never has ever got into anything that he said oops I bit off more than I could chew he has never because he already knew but what God knows has beneath all of the faults and everything the baggage that we've come with in life complexes and everything else God has confidence that his word will indeed prevail it's not an excuse for all these other things but it is the power that is residing in the sea that when the quickening power comes on it it will grow into the image and likeness of him who it is of whether Samuel X is very positive the gospel is positive it didn't say that he had he have begotten us into a onto it unto a deep discouragement he had begotten us unto a lively hope sure things come our ways that get us down and get us discouraged that's exactly right but that's why we need the ministering of the word that's why we need the fellowship among brothers and sisters that's why we need to walk on in the word that's why you want to pray even when you don't feel like praying even when you don't feel like coming to church when it's not convenient it is for our good not our flesh it's the man down on the inside the flash profit is nothing but the Inside Man is what's fed see the more you feed that Inside Man the more he's fed on the word the more he executes dominion over the outer man so what is it after a while we come in the world borne by sinful parents we walk around on the world you know first thing you know like that little hook nose Jew Paul you know and he was carrying out and the first thing something said here here here here I love that great theological term here you are walking about upon this earth and something comes along said give you here some of the begins to get your attention you begin to recognize there's there's something that's ministering to the longing and craving of which I have never felt a piece for I've never found anything but yet then begins to move upon your life and he says I have a father we begin to come predestinated us to our inheritance in him which was predestinated to us we inherited it before the foundation of the world because we realized Jesus never gave us our inheritance my inheritance was always right the jury preached about it on Sunday we were speaking about a funeral that inheritance always was eternal life what the Lord Jesus came is to step down and make a way that we can go to our inheritance for he is the way to that inheritance so through him we have obtained and that word obtained means to take by possession what is rightfully ours that which has been designated to us just like in the land that scripture when it says obtained when it's talking about even the possession that was in the land of promise God knew exactly where this one tribe would be this tribe would be this tribe be and God supplied and ensured that even when that that particular head of the tribe was coming forth the Spirit of God moved upon those mothers as they was giving birth and their name held the mystery of their positioning in the land they men and that name when we're looking at the revealing of his name and his name is called the Word of God as his name is revealed you and I are identified within him and it positions us in Christ is that right we come into a place to where the Bible is no longer just a book it's not just a letter it's light it holy it's it's it's truly we're not just saying this it's a love letter it holds a mystery we can we can read about answer if we see ourselves we read Nehemiah was he ourselves we don't see it in terms of history of a day gone by we see it that it's God's leadership and guidance and every part of it is rich in their and expressed that even now it's yet still even though packed in but yet it prophesied of this hour is that right now watch this here in the scripture I want to just I want to go in back into a few places here tonight and I want to come back into a few places with this and showing if we haven't been able to get to a place to where to show how God work as all things after the counsel of his own will sometimes when God is moving it's not just some time when God is working everything after the counsel of his own will there are times that it looks like it's defeated there are times that God is having steps to be taken that looks like why is this step being taken now this is within every aspect of our life this is where the trust itself trusting in the Lord who's leading and guiding our pathway God knows our knee he knows what we have Nita God even knew exactly what to say he knows even what to say God already had my already knew concerning the service he knew what words to say he already knew what I need would be sometimes when we're looking at it it don't seem like him now let me just qualify this statement as well sometimes there's things that are in our life where the judgments and decisions that we've made that are they're just flat-out mistakes I mean I don't care what kind of spirituality you try to sprinkle on they still have the stink of our own decisions our own will you understand you know it's just a mess nobody wants to learn no but so we we understand but the Bible does tell us in the book of Romans that all things work together for the good he didn't say everything is good you didn't say everything's good I'm not going to ask how many in here like chocolate cake but you're not gonna find those of you like chocolate cake say man I love flour just give me a cup of flour no sir you better put eggs with that put butter with that put everything else you need with it in order to bring out the chocolate cake but all things work together I don't want just an egg and you tell me it's chocolate cake sorry we're back to food examples watch how the Scriptures speak this and I want you to see how God sovereignly watches over to bring about bring the past his word in our life here when we look at at this place here in Romans chapter 9 Paul deals with the election of God he's speaking of this and he says within it not as though the Word of God had taken an effect for they are not all Israel which are Israel neither because they are the seed of Abraham are they all children but an Isaac shall thy seed be called and as Paul goes on he says they which are the children of flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for the seed but this is the word of promise at this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son and not only this but when Rebekah also had conceived by one even by our Father Isaac but the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that call him it was said unto her the elder I want you to catch this here it was said unto her the elder shall serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated think about this for a moment when Israel was in a situation where they called into question God's law they called God's love into question it wasn't God's love but it what it was that called it into question was their thinking how they thought God's love ought to be think of this here it is in the very first part of Malachi but you think the spiritual condition of the people the spiritual condition and and they begin to call and question the love of God and God for them and God refers them back to this place you see Conn doesn't come around and say ah you know I love you you know I love you you know I love you you know I love you God takes them to proof because God follows his own word in the book of John that said let us not love in word a deed only but it's expressive because love is not an idea I hope you with me now love is not a concept love real real love is a person not a concept it's not an idea it cannot remember even the man who wrote there on the on that wall there in that insane or in the asylum that place you your mind cannot even fathom and comprehend the love of God and God reminds Israel during this time and you know what I'm glad that God reminds you and I he'll remind us where he's brought us from he'll remind us of his care he'll remind us how he's watched over I'm glad for that because sometimes we forget but God don't forget and you begin to see that the experiences and the tests and the trials and everything he brought you for he wasn't just a bunch of happenstance and things falling around God was showing himself personally to you that he is committed and dedicated to his word and you are a part of his word [Applause] glory be to God Malachi moana says I have loved you verse 2 saith the Lord yet you say we're in hostile of this was not Esau Jacob's brother saith the Lord yet I loved Jacob God is he goes into these things I just I don't want to continue to read through that but God begins to make known of what happened with Esau because the Esau choice but then God also let it be known because of the choice that Jacob made but how did Jacob make the choice that he made it's because that choice was already made by God that's why when the person says I chose to serve God no you didn't you only reflected the choice God made that's all you did because if it's you and God said alright you're gonna serve me I'll predestinate you you still got glory in it but because before any choice any decision why are we that of election because we are of God's own loins my children are not my children because they would do this and they would do that and they would do this and they would do that they come from my loins and that's where the choosing and election of Almighty God it's not about what you can do or what you would do it was God chose you because you are a part of him and it unfolds in time now watch this here let's just watch watch God's care I want you to watch this grande just does not give his word and he doesn't watch over it he watches over his word he watches over he watches to see that that word is fulfilled that's why it is so crucial that's why the call is be in Christ's amen it's God working God moving God drawing what's God how he watches over his seed the scriptures they they tell us here in the book of Genesis and I I'm just gonna refer to a few places here and some of this a little bit of review but I just can't get away from there's just such inspiration I tell you it's just been flowing over weeks and I thought I was just gonna be able to fly to Connecticut on my own because you begin to see the sovereignty of God and God watching over everything because here when in the situation where here Rebecca she is brought to Isaac and Isaac the scripture said begin to entreat the Lord and he began to make supplication and asking God who you know to give children that his wife would be able to conceive when the scripture tells us in verse 22 of Genesis 25 that the children struggled together within her Anna and she said if it be so why am i thus and she went to inquire of the Lord you know that's what that there is a lot of things we could stop on that verse there was something going on within her she didn't put a fuss of paints a post on Facebook come on somebody about everything that was going on with him she inquired of the Lord you know why Rebecca knew that he holds the mystery of my life when I was down there and it was God the angel of the Lord that led me to the well at the time when Eliezer came there it was God that arranged all that time so she recognizes that there's nothing by chance was God what's she doing she knows her life it has been planned out by Almighty God so she's looking to him who has set the plan that he would reveal to her what is taking place right now it wasn't comfortable she was struggling within but she inquired of the Lord he has the answer the you it's me it's okay sometimes they're going you can talk with people and that's all you end up getting is people's ideas come on somebody all you end up getting this peoples doctrine ooh hallelujah but she went and inquired of the Lord to hold it be to God and the Lord look at this God honored this and the Lord said unto her two nations are in thy womb two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels and the one people shall be stronger than the other people and the elder shall serve the younger and when her days were to be fulfilled behold there were twins in her room and the first came out red all over like a hairy garment and they call him Esau and after that his brother came out in his hand took hold on Esau's heel and his name was called Jacob and he saw was threescore years old when she bare him and the boys grew now think of this it begins to talk about Esau cunning hunter man of the field Jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents lazy you recognize this well you know it God showing you don't merit it no matter how good a person is you can never merit the grace of God Esau was a much better man now that don't mean don't clean your house they don't mean brothers no you can go around and not pick up your clothes come on now don't be thinking like praise the Lord I can be a slob now no daddy what we're talking about you still be a real godly woman a real godly gentleman that all right think some of you got nervous I had to put that in the sisters are getting nervous the brothers were getting nervous we're almost going to have marriage counseling here but the ball is grew and Isaac loved Esau because he did eat of his venison but Rebekah loved Jacob I want to just just come in on this just for a few moments here's Rebecca she's a spiritual woman she catches as we seen back in Genesis 24 the time to come to the well of water she's moved upon by the angel of the Lord now being spiritual doesn't mean that things always stand out but there's something that within that can witness there's something here blue ram tells us that Abraham saw them three walking he said Abraham thought something was spiritual about them it was something resonated with an Abraham there's something about him he he didn't I didn't say anything to Abraham Abraham said my lord he bowed himself down he was made known to him here is Rebekah a spiritual woman God reveals to her what's going on inside her there's a struggle and God reveals it God reveals to her the Younger shall serve or the elder shall serve the younger and wants you to think of this Rebekah knows this and here are both boys let me ask you do you think Rebecca treated them any differently you think she gave let's say hot eggs the jacob cold eggs the esau No as far as a mother would go she was there too mother each one of them when he saw fell off of the bike with training wheels she kissed his boo-boo are you with me she even what was revealed to her listen friends this is what I'm trying to say what was revealed held grace in it grace took effect in her heart and life and grace would not allow anything you buy that would hinder the promise that's why when we went off when the Prophet tells us it's we need to pray for revelation he said it's more important to you than perhaps you realized it's not talking about knowledge real revelation is the divine imparting of Almighty God it's God unfolding himself to you and I and when that happens and as God is doing that you recognize how little you are you recognize it's not you that's done it because all of our studying and everything it won't it won't unearth it's God see then what does that do its grace working in our life so here's Rebecca here she is as moving in this time well I believe it on my heart she kept in her heart what was spoke to her she pondered those things in her heart she thought about them what God had said that the elder shall serve the younger she thought of that and to think of how that when you look at this when you look at this thought Isaac Isaac loved Esau because he did eat of his venison or Rebecca loved Jacob the message is broadcast to all is that right all who come within ear of hearing it but it is the elect to whom it is revealed though although many can hear but the message comes with the intent to lay claim on the elect so here's Jacob when we look at it here obtaining the birthright Jacobs burst is against your birth order my birth order was against me but there's a lot God was telling Israel in the book of Malachi look when everything was against Jacob I was for Jacob and I am still for Jacob hey men see it would have seemed that everything working all things after the counsel of his own will he would have seemed when we look at it because the birthright belongs to the firstborn it would just make sense naturally that Jacob would be the first one born but God's showing a mystery God showing the mystery in your life in my life that the first birth in our life was not Jacob the first birth was Esau but that which is down there hidden beneath is Jacob is the elect of God and without the Lord Jesus Christ the light of God the gospel coming along I pass away we don't stand a chance but God watches over his word here comes here I want you to think of this friends these are not things just by chance that Jacob stint tends to be out sodding pottage here he is sodding apologies he's make repairing this he knows what time that that that Esau is coming in from the field you can say well look he was planning that but I'm asking you who moved upon Jacob to do that who moved upon him God why was that because Jacob had a value of the birthright he was seeking after that birthright joka Jacob wanted the Holy Ghost more than anything he meant more to him if has the perfect places that it's true it meant more than anything job whatever the Holy Ghost meant everything to Jacob when did Jacob get that valuation of the birthright so you can see when Esau comes in and he says give me some of your father's I'm not ready to faint but as Jake as they sell me this day by birthright they're right tell me this day that birthright and Esau despises the birthday prophet does this birthright have for me you see what Jacob is what he saw was doing he was looking at the birthright but he was putting his own physical needs above the birthright oh if I get this or if I you know if I receive the Holy Ghost what could happen god it takes God to bring a person beyond that to bring them to a place to where they need that more than they need their own pride what if I if I if I begin to do this if I really begin to sell out it takes God to bring a person into that place but he saw it looks at it is then what what good what good will it do me you know the difference between Jacob and Esau Esau had no vision he had hair he had in his possession but he had no vision that's a difference we know one is not just having the word but the have vision is to have faith in that word because faith gives sight beyond Esau did not have any vision beyond that temple Esau was interested in satisfying himself he was interested in living for himself let me say this is why even when the Prophet says Esau was never a type of carnal church members that are never able to climb into the promise you know what the whole secret is is because I'm not willing to die when you're willing to fully surrender a person that's willing willing to fully surrender God will fully come in when a person gets Astrid God comes down is that right I think of how even the scripture says that that Esau he sold it look how Paul would speak about it for one morsel Paul speaks of the menial thing that he cast aside his birthright for this a mere pleasure of the world he cast it aside but for Jacob he valued it why did he value it because within him Jacob was elect did he have the birthright no but he was going to obtain it I want you to watch this how's it for the RAM place isn't the calling of Abraham I hope this touches your heart the way it's just touch mine these are familiar and statements the Prophet make Abraham is election don't forget this anyhow Abraham is God's election Isaac his justification Jacob grace anybody would know I believe in grace see what God did for Jacob and Joseph perfection he goes in the message Israel in the church are three said called election and Abraham justification and Isaac Grace and Jacob anybody that ever read Jacobs life no you have to believe in grace it's grace in Jacob they're right grace as we said is unmerited grace is what's provided God provided for Israel lamb prophet and a pillar fire is that right that's what grace did but in order to come under grace you have to receive great after receive the leadership of what grace is pointing you to is that right it was God letting him know this is their exodus out of Egypt grace lets them know they don't know how to get out but grace provides for them the way out so grace isn't has it's been such a mockery of way grace has been painted in this day it's not just new to this day the scripture speaks up in the book of Jude they turned the grace of our God into lasciviousness disgrace because real grace is not God wholeness eyes eyes closed but grace is him providing what's needed for us and we accept what grace provided and come under it over and over you hear the Prophet make the statement the Israel made their rational mistake rational mistake who keeps on going because what did they do they failed to walk in what God had provided it's the tendency within man to want to do something clear from back and in Eden making aprons of fig leaves wanting to do something instead of walking in what God that's why it's important than what God is opening within his word walk in it listen friends just to say that was a good service and you walk and you don't pray over it you don't give yourself to it you're not walking in it you're not a recipient of grace that's the destitute despite under the spirit of grace it's the spirit of grace that brings the word to us it's continent deals with our life it's up for us to submit ourselves to what grace has provided pray over those things you're not a stretch to say Lord let the word that has come that brings such positivity and makes known to us that authority Lord let it rain in my heart that I have an effect on my conduct have an effect on my mind have an effect on my behavior I have an effect on my objectives have an effect on my vision the wife was meant and sent to bring an effect and that effect as to where it becomes Christ displayed Christ shown in our lives we don't want to just talk about Christ understand to talk about just to talk about this message is not to go into rapture it must be applied daily living janely hour after hour moment after moment it's meant to be applied my where's tango what's this God working everything after the counsel of his own will the scripture says in Genesis 27 1 and it came to pass then when Isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see he called Esau his eldest son and said unto him my son and he said behold there I am behold now I am old and I know not the day of my death and he doesn't want to do going on the field if the venison prepare it and my soul may bless thee before I die the scripture says that in verse 5 Rebekah heard when Isaac's picked the east on Isaac is an instrument of the Lord you believe that God's prophet but the scripture says it came to pass that Isaac's eyes read them the blessing of the birthright it's that time look how God is working everything after the counsel of his own will he's moving everything in position it would look like why is I said going blind right now this is the time you ought to have his eyesight but God knows he know he's God's prophet but yet he's still a man blood said I'm not gonna let him use his eyesight and his intellect to make a choice hey man because my thoughts are higher than your thoughts so what was not going to do that God's choice would be made known by his personal presence and vindication he would not be by the natural oh my it would not be the natural I say of the Prophet but it was a spiritual eyesight I'm telling you brother and sister that is what you and I are under and have come under is not the natural eyesight of a man have been a prophetic eyesight God fight in line with his word and the Spirit of God has moved right down there and we can see ourselves in the word it's not the intellect of man we would not have been chosen but God said I chose you not my intellect not by the natural eyesight but by him chosen us before him in love Isaac didn't discern but God discerned it was Jacob remember how that Rebekah here she tells she tells Jacob what to do what's God doing working everything after the counsel of his own will God already is the choosing Jacob is to receive the birthright blessing if we're looking at this unfolding right even if you're not a fingernail chewer you'd be chewing them boy this is running close but God has Rebekah there and he's given that word to Rebecca and Rebecca is able to catch what Isaac is saying and she makes it known to Jacob go do this Jacob go get a kid out of the flock bring it to me I'll prepare it I know what spices and by the way go get goodly garments of Esau and put on goodly garments and by the way mother wonder what they're gonna say yeah my brother's a hairy man she and she want us to do put goat hair upon him hey man she's risen every piece of the offering that's gonna go before Isaac hey man here is Jacob coming in there what's he doing he's submitting himself it's God working all things after the counsel of his own will remember he says hello mother I can't go in there what did she say son my son hearken unto my voice what authority obey my voice she said for thy curse be upon me what is that it's the Spirit of God the Holy Spirit screaming out in Atonement I bore your judgment I bore your curse I bore your shame amen when you were away without fellowship but I have sought you out you are called the city shout out backing and drew you into myself what's Jacob doing he's walking with what is provided he's being told what to do they come out of the Upper Room the word stirs the hearts what must we do to be safe see the desire was to be saved there's leadership there what's God doing watching over his word here's the eunuch down there reading in the Book of Isaiah he's longing to understand longing for life what is God doing watching over his word God catches Philip away takes him down there and Philip draws near and says do you understand what you're reading there's no who's the Prophet speaking of himself for another God used his body to do what give leadership to his elect it's gone working in the simplicity and the sovereignty working all things after the counsel of his own will you know how the story goes on that we went through this here I'm just reviewing here tonight it's setting some stages for some things with Jacob's life but that you can see that it is indeed the grace of God that's within Jacob's life when you see after that even esau when he comes in he realizes jacob's already been there but then here Esau comes in and afterwards he's asking don't you have a blessing for me he just wants a blessing that's there really that's the only reason he looked at the birthright but he didn't have the right value of the birthright understand what I'm saying he didn't have the right value of the Holy Ghost to Esau the Holy Ghost was just enough to make him get happy at church I just want to get happy enough to where I dance I shall I feel good Jacob had a longing to be changed it's a different a different approach a different value that's why in our lives how precious it is if you find in your heart a value or the Holy Spirit a value for the Word of God Lord let your word live in me let it change and transform my life Lord from glory unto glory the scripture tells us here I'm done it's made known to Rebecca or what Esau has said that he's going to do to Jacob and Rebecca is fearful once you catch this she's fearful look at the wisdom of God here the wisdom of God is moving and it would look like no why is Jacob being sent away but there was why there was elected one that he had to get moved around and so here it's put up on Rebecca's heart she talks to Jacob but then she goes to Isaac you've got the town talk to Isaac tell him not to take I'm fearful unless he'll take one of the daughters from around here if you look what but you look what was in East halls heart the whole time he came out because the scripture says when Esau heard what Isaac and them had said unto Jacob regarding the wife he went and took a woman of Canaan or was it he despised he just didn't despise it here but it came into manifestation he despised it he despised Jacob but God had his hand on Jacob's life the birthright and already come in as far as the pronouncing upon his life by his father that order was according to God's choosing God moved everything right in line you know friends sometimes I put it just like this here without I don't want to go any further but I want you to think of this sometimes even when you bring this down to your own natural life if listen if the preaching of the word of God if it stays just in a manner to where it's just doctrinal level then it never gets down to the application understand what I'm saying it's like we could preach on we preach on the white horse rider preach on the on the red horse rider and the black horse rider but I don't want to just leave him out here in doctrine it comes down into your online our lives person the word brings discernment and there's times that sometimes there's things happen and places and things going on that we may not be able to make sense of but like what Rebecca did she inquired of the Lord she didn't tell the Lord stop this gorgeous she wanted to know first of all what's going on you know what that was it put her open for the Lord to speak to God is working everything after the counsel of his own will I don't mean to belabor that scripture but I'm going to because it is evident within Jacob's life it's evident in each one of their lives God is moving everything's sovereignly according to his own will sometimes our pathways those we come in contact with things that take place do you realize your tests and trials they're not the happens then tests and trials are not by boy what did i do what did I do to deserve this I should have been to lunch early today now at the end of the line I got the leftovers no that's not what testing trials testing trials think of how that the Prophet by the Spirit of God put him before us he said personal temptation it's the same enemy that we faith we're all tried we're all tested it's the way that he comes and he comes because even Satan studies and knows yet what he doesn't know is that real reality on the inside but through every test and through every trial its Christ in us who rises it's him working everything you believe that I want to be sensitive to his voice sometimes where we see the Spirit of the Lord moving through Rebecca the spiritual woman a type of a spiritual Church of the Living God she's catching at that moment what needs to be done and she's moved what's God doing watching over his work aren't you thankful for them not to think of how that God has watched over his work that same God he knows your need knows your situation knows mine isn't that wonderful and he's already provided all that we have to do is walk way that he is laid out before let's pray Heavenly Father Lord as we just come before you lord this evening Lord we want to save your God as we look Lord upon your word Lord we look in here tonight Lord just Lord and review some of the things that even Lord that we begin to speak about in Jacob's life and seeing that Lord that as we've looked at it that the blessing belongs to the blessed the Lord it's you bringing Lord bringing forth Lord even into our hearts Lord from us from within us Lord your God your choosing making it Lord more real Lord in our lives I pray Heavenly Father that in our hearts Lord may we walk Lord your God in that grace that you provided Lord even recognizing that when you come to correct us Lord that's your grace it's grace Lord that we would not Lord error we would not go and continue to move down a certain path my lord father I pray tonight Lord your God that you would just Lord continue to move Lord upon every heart and in each life more that the Lord the pathways and the things that Lord that you've set forth Lord here we see it in Jacob's life [Music] Lord may in all things as Rebecca she inquired a few more Jacob was resting the Lord he was looking Lord even even his fears were addressed Rebecca addressed those those fears Lord we know that that's a type of the Holy Ghost in the Church of the Living God speaking Lord to our hearts speaking or God to our lives Lord and removing Lord fear moving doubt removing worry Lord Lord speaking the word Lord God just elevates Lord increases our faith or God and you lord I pray Lord Jesus have your way Lord God may Lord for every heart and every life Lord you see every need Lord each one Lord God if there's one Lord that doesn't know you Lord may the Lord surrender Lord to your voice Lord your God heeding to it Lord Lord as you would draw their life or God step by step of the way Lord nor they walk Lord God in the light Lord God that you are opening to them Lord and in their life Lord father for every one of us Lord God it's maturing it's growing Lord it's moving on in you Lloyd there's a longer there's a desire there's a longing Lord to become more and more like you Lord we love you we thank you tonight Lord not me you just continue Lord to move in our hearts in our lives and for every need Lord father for every pathway Lord for each journey for each place Lord may we look to You Lord God and and truly say Lord I want your perfect will Lord in my life I don't want to just Lord take steps and hope the Lord that I want that assurance help me to recognize Lord Lord in those steps that I should take him in Lord then I can recognize your presence Lord that I can rest Lord in that assurance Lord with your leadership in your direction Lord God in my life granite north the precious name of the Lord Jesus amen let's dead [Music] like never before [Music] shameless and yes Lord Jesus [Music] like their father before [Music] let me go me and I will [Music] [Music] you brought me from Seoul yes four cheese's [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] but tonight you can just say hallelujah [Music] yes my god maybe like [Music] lady me and [Music] I want you to think of this when we speak of the submission to the Lord and to the presence of God how God would bring direction or life it's the Lord I just wants you to have complete control I may have that desire look at what Jacob did he let God have complete control by listening to what God was saying and then walking in it see God can't have complete control if he doesn't have complete control if God doesn't have control if you say Lord I just want you to have control we're just standing there and God doesn't have control but control is us yielding he wants us to cube to you that as we yield to him then he takes control he's a gentleman God will never and you know this you'll never tamper and touch any life without give being given permission plucky little song did brother Jerry sings there's a room in my heart where even I wouldn't go I had some things in there I didn't want no one to know but then he handed me the key with look of the look of love on his face I said I'll make you clean let me in your secret place it's letting him have control so when the word touches our hearts as it does that's letting God have control take that word and say Lord be it in me Lord be it unto me let thy will be done in my life and submit to him pray over give yourself to it that's letting God have control and you'll find like Jacob here comes with the goat hair here it comes with all these things seem God but God was leading him you believe that God was leading I [Music] Oh [Music] yes Lord like never No [Music] me [Music] say
