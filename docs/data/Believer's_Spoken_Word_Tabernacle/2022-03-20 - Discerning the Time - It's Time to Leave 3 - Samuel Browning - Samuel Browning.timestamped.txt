[44:45] of things um pictures where they've met
[44:47] with them in poland but he's putting
[44:49] together an entire video and i believe
[44:52] it'll be
[44:54] on their website so we'll get that
[44:56] information
[44:57] to you

[45:00] so if i forget that
[45:02] sister roseanne you have to remind me
[45:05] my wife i know that i can send that out
[45:08] because when i say something and
[45:09] sometimes i just get off and i forget
[45:11] about it but
[45:12] also sister linda
[45:15] cavillo we want to also continue to
[45:18] remember her in prayer
[45:21] you know she's experienced different
[45:22] setbacks but as we were there the other
[45:25] day
[45:26] and just praying with her
[45:28] and i just
[45:29] just began to just speak just speak to
[45:31] her once again on the atonement and then
[45:33] just just taking that part on jonah and
[45:36] jonah was in the belly of the well
[45:38] all of the surroundings he had he called
[45:41] them lying vanities
[45:44] that's that's how i said every one of
[45:47] these situations i said the doctors say
[45:49] this is normal and this is you know
[45:52] these things can happen i said but all
[45:54] of this is lying vanities
[45:57] and we're not going to look we're not
[45:59] going to look there and i said we don't
[46:00] have to look over to jerusalem because
[46:02] that that temple of the living god he's
[46:05] right here among us right here in this
[46:07] room right now
[46:08] the angel of the lord is right here
[46:11] and so
[46:12] we just want you just if you just even
[46:15] throughout the day and at times when she
[46:16] comes to your heart i know you have been
[46:18] you've been holding up in prayer and i
[46:20] just told her i said the church is just
[46:22] praying for you i said we're standing
[46:25] with you and and
[46:27] you know she's standing there real
[46:29] strong you know sometimes when there's
[46:30] setbacks and things like that you you
[46:32] watch you're looking and the things i
[46:34] was praying for is god don't let her get
[46:36] weak in her spirit like strengthen her
[46:38] lord
[46:39] give her resolve and courage is to keep
[46:42] pressing on there and so she has that
[46:44] resolve and we just want to keep praying
[46:47] amen and holding it before the lord in
[46:49] prayer
[46:50] amen let's look here in the word in
[46:53] psalms
[46:55] and i want to just read these scriptures
[46:57] here verse 1 if we we could a little bit
[47:00] of a lengthy reading but
[47:03] verse 1 david a prayer
[47:05] of david
[47:07] bow down thine ear oh lord hear me
[47:11] for i am poor
[47:13] and needy
[47:14] preserve my soul
[47:17] for i am holy
[47:18] oh thou my god save thy servant that
[47:22] trusteth in thee now if you notice david
[47:25] is not purporting his own holiness
[47:28] but he recognizes his holiness
[47:31] comes from god
[47:33] in whom
[47:34] i'm trusting
[47:36] be merciful unto me o lord for i cry
[47:39] unto thee daily
[47:41] rejoice the soul of thy servant for unto
[47:44] thee o lord do i lift up my soul
[47:47] for thou lord are good and ready to
[47:51] forgive
[47:52] and plenteous in mercy unto all them
[47:55] that call upon thee
[47:57] give ear o lord unto my prayer
[48:00] and attend to the voice of my
[48:03] supplications
[48:04] in the day of my trouble i will call
[48:07] upon thee
[48:08] for thou willed answer
[48:10] among the gods there is none liken unto
[48:13] thee o lord
[48:14] neither are there any works
[48:17] like unto thy words
[48:19] all nations whom thou has made
[48:22] shall come and worship before thee o
[48:24] lord
[48:25] and shall glorify thy name
[48:28] for thou art great and doest wondrous
[48:31] things
[48:32] thou art god alone
[48:36] teach me thy way o lord
[48:38] i will walk in thy truth
[48:41] and unite
[48:43] my heart
[48:44] to fear
[48:45] thy name
[48:47] amen may god bless the reading of the
[48:48] word as you're being seated i want to go
[48:50] and read just another
[48:52] passage of scripture here
[48:54] in matthew chapter 16.
[48:58] the bible says in verse 1 here that the
[49:00] pharisees also with the sadducees came
[49:04] and tempting desired him that he
[49:08] would show them a sign
[49:10] from heaven
[49:12] he answered and said unto them when it
[49:13] is even
[49:15] you say it will be fair weather for the
[49:17] sky is red
[49:18] in the morning it will be foul weather
[49:21] today
[49:22] for the sky is red and lowering
[49:24] oh you hypocrites
[49:26] you can discern the face of the sky
[49:30] but you cannot discern the signs of the
[49:34] times
[49:35] a wicked and adulterous generation
[49:37] seeketh after a sign
[49:40] there shall no sign be given unto it
[49:43] the sign of the prophet jonas and he
[49:45] left them
[49:47] and departed
[49:48] now
[49:50] when we recognize that in this time i
[49:53] want to continue the thought
[49:55] on discerning the time and it's time to
[49:58] leave
[50:00] and when we consider this of where we're
[50:02] at in this in this moment
[50:05] the spirit of this age is a spirit of
[50:09] uniting
[50:11] you know you find that
[50:13] that within nature itself there is
[50:16] always a uniting together
[50:19] before there's a flight like when the
[50:21] geese are getting together before they
[50:23] head down to the the rice paddies in
[50:25] louisiana there's always a gathering
[50:28] going on you find it in the fall
[50:30] you'll find the birds and when they come
[50:33] together
[50:34] uh in great flocks and here they are
[50:36] you'll hear them chirp and you'll just
[50:38] see them it's just many many amounts of
[50:41] them that are they are all together and
[50:44] there's a uniting that's going on in
[50:46] preparation for that flight
[50:49] and god in his infinite wisdom and mercy
[50:52] that even within nature because to
[50:54] realize that nature itself
[50:57] it testifies of god
[51:00] and how that god would so place that
[51:03] there to where
[51:04] one of them of the geese and among the
[51:07] robins and so forth the ducks
[51:09] and one of them
[51:11] is a leader
[51:13] and you know with that leader it's
[51:15] something that you don't have to tell
[51:17] the rest of the geese
[51:19] you don't have to tell the rest of the
[51:21] ducks it's just
[51:22] it's just something that is that is
[51:24] given science calls an instinct but like
[51:27] how brother banh said it he said i call
[51:29] it god
[51:30] because it's it's not something that is
[51:33] explained but it's just it just drops
[51:35] it's simple they they don't care if his
[51:38] feathers is is not as good as the rest
[51:40] of the feathers but what it is they can
[51:42] catch that that this drake in terms of
[51:45] the geese that this is the one that that
[51:48] we're to follow and and we need and we
[51:50] need to follow and to be led by this so
[51:52] anytime there's a migration you
[51:55] recognize that there is something that
[51:57] begins to move together these animals
[52:01] together in preparation for that
[52:03] migrating so before it ever takes place
[52:06] there's a uniting and then through that
[52:08] uniting then that migration takes place
[52:12] so it's not anybody just finding their
[52:14] own way but god has provided leadership
[52:18] by his grace brother brown would say it
[52:21] like this he's talking about a uniting
[52:23] taking place and he says they are coming
[52:27] to the battle of armageddon and that's
[52:30] exactly what they'll do they're uniting
[52:32] for that right now that's why we got the
[52:35] u.n and everything we have the western
[52:38] world's uniting against the eastern
[52:41] world communism and so forth it's all
[52:44] uniting together the churches are
[52:47] uniting together
[52:49] everything seems to be uniting it's
[52:52] uniting themselves together and all and
[52:55] all the while this uniting of nations
[52:58] and signs that we see was prophesied in
[53:01] the scripture earthquakes in diverse
[53:03] places and bringing the world together
[53:06] bringing the people together churches
[53:08] are being brought together but while all
[53:11] of that uniting is taking place and
[53:13] remember within that uniting there is a
[53:16] focus and there is a power that is
[53:19] moving to bring people together in a
[53:23] like-mindedness but while that is going
[53:25] on among politics among religion among
[53:29] world systems among nations there is
[53:32] another uniting that's taking place
[53:35] and that uniting is what even we want to
[53:38] look at even even to fellowship around
[53:41] here this morning and because there's
[53:44] there's two powers at work within the
[53:46] earth you have that of satan and we have
[53:50] that of god it's two spirits that that's
[53:53] at work and you think of it that how the
[53:55] holy spirit is calling a bride out of
[53:58] the church into divine fellowship under
[54:02] the blood of jesus christ
[54:04] and and now the satan is also we can say
[54:07] it the unholy spirit he is gathering
[54:10] people together by education
[54:14] theology by science he's uniting them
[54:18] together so there are two achievements
[54:21] that are coming forth in this hour the
[54:24] bride of jesus christ is the achievement
[54:26] of the holy ghost in this hour where the
[54:29] word of god has been sown for a revival
[54:33] now remember the bible is very clear to
[54:36] tell us that there is a mora a former
[54:38] rain and there is a laddering the latter
[54:41] is a maturing rain a ripening rain a
[54:44] harvest rain but in order for that
[54:46] harvest rain to come there must first be
[54:50] a former amora or a sowing rain so there
[54:53] must be seeds that have been sown so
[54:56] right now we are living in the time of
[55:00] revival we are living in a time to where
[55:03] as brother madam would put it that
[55:04] communism even in this nation the seeds
[55:07] he said have been sown before and how
[55:10] that even the seeds for romanism seeds
[55:13] for catholicism the seeds for the world
[55:16] council of churches all of these seeds
[55:19] have been sown seeds of denominational
[55:22] working and now there is also been a
[55:25] seed that has been sown in this hour for
[55:28] the bride of jesus christ to come forth
[55:31] now what seed is that that has been sown
[55:34] it's a seed wherein that the entire word
[55:37] of the bible has been planted all the
[55:41] way from genesis to revelations and
[55:44] remember by the word himself coming down
[55:48] and speaking that word and announcing
[55:51] and unfolding to us that this is the
[55:53] time this is the season it's a time of
[55:56] harvest time remember that when we look
[55:59] at the time of harvest harvest time is a
[56:03] time where wheat and tares have grown
[56:05] together but now in the time of harvest
[56:08] it's where the wheat and the tares begin
[56:11] to actually reflect what was always in
[56:14] the roots so it's a time of separation
[56:17] it's also a time of gathering we're
[56:20] living in a time of advancement and
[56:23] achievement look at how science how
[56:25] science itself the parallel between
[56:28] science and between god within this hour
[56:30] where science would have the horse and
[56:33] buggy and that would be typified by the
[56:35] message of justification in this hour
[56:38] there would also then be that of of the
[56:41] automobile which would be typed as that
[56:44] of wesley's message of sanctification
[56:46] through the blood then we find the
[56:49] airplane another mode notice what every
[56:52] one of these are are modes of
[56:54] transportation they are means to take
[56:56] you from one place to another and every
[57:00] one of them even with the airplane now
[57:02] that got off the ground it is that in
[57:04] itself was a type of pentecost where the
[57:07] supernatural begins to come back among
[57:10] the church of the living god but here in
[57:13] this hour according to his word that god
[57:16] would visit the church and just as they
[57:19] would put a man in space an astronaut
[57:22] god himself and brings down the
[57:25] astronaut that has already been there on
[57:28] the throne of god the whole time the
[57:30] same lord jesus in the form of his word
[57:34] comes down as the entire holy spirit and
[57:37] visits the church of the living god
[57:39] because we are not to be confined by the
[57:43] atmosphere and the realms of this earth
[57:46] but we are to be caught away in a moment
[57:49] and a twinkling of an eye we are to move
[57:52] into that astronaut jesus christ by the
[57:57] blood of jesus christ now it's a uniting
[58:00] that's going on brother branham would go
[58:02] on to say god is uniting his pride she's
[58:06] coming together from the east and the
[58:08] west and the north and the south there's
[58:11] a uniting time that's going on right now
[58:14] i think it's absolutely and just
[58:16] marvelous i'm always amazed at it it's
[58:18] it's not something that uh you know that
[58:21] that that new to us but it's i'm always
[58:24] amazed you know you watch how god will
[58:27] come right around and whether it's
[58:29] someone could step right in here and
[58:30] you'll find a continuity that is taking
[58:33] place right around the bride of jesus
[58:36] christ around the world a few weeks ago
[58:40] just as i walked out of the pulpit here
[58:42] i have a text from the brother daniel
[58:44] o'forey and just as we had just finished
[58:46] ministry he said my goodness he said the
[58:49] same points those very same things is
[58:52] what i just finished ministering this
[58:55] morning
[58:56] as i stood there last week you know
[58:58] ministering there with brother jonathan
[59:00] martin there and bible believers and
[59:02] just you know feeling pressed to the
[59:04] lord and i took you know a collection of
[59:06] messages here that i ministered and just
[59:08] to take points out of that and it was
[59:10] just messages that i just had preached
[59:12] on a sunday and just feeling to come
[59:14] back into that and brother jonathan told
[59:16] me he said everything he said when you
[59:18] begin to minister he said it was an amen
[59:22] coming to everything that had already
[59:24] been spoken here the past three weeks
[59:27] you know you say brothers tell me what
[59:28] are you trying to say i'm saying that
[59:31] the same holy spirit the way that he
[59:34] worked with paul and peter who had never
[59:37] met one another when they came together
[59:40] they were preaching the same thing
[59:42] because they were in contact with the
[59:44] same holy spirit i tell you it's god
[59:47] declaring the book of acts is not a
[59:50] group of people that are under the
[59:52] control of man they do not need programs
[59:55] sent to their mailbox it is not man
[59:58] trying to bring a uniting and man saying
[1:00:01] preach on this and preach on this there
[1:00:03] is the presence of the living god right
[1:00:06] here among us that's directing us
[1:00:08] according to the needs of his children
[1:00:10] i'm telling you the bible says the eyes
[1:00:13] of the lord roam through and fall
[1:00:15] throughout the earth and god shows
[1:00:18] himself strong on the behalf of his
[1:00:20] children
[1:00:21] you see there's a uniting that's going
[1:00:23] on and coming together from north west
[1:00:26] south and so forth he says
[1:00:29] she's uniting for the rapture it's god's
[1:00:32] getting her ready what is she uniting
[1:00:35] with
[1:00:35] with the word
[1:00:38] for all heavens and earth will pass away
[1:00:40] but my word shall never pass away
[1:00:43] she's uniting herself with thus saith
[1:00:46] the lord regardless of what any
[1:00:49] denomination or anybody says she's
[1:00:51] uniting herself she's getting ready she
[1:00:55] is the bride she's uniting herself with
[1:00:58] her bridegroom and the bridegroom is the
[1:01:00] word in the beginning was the word and
[1:01:02] the word was with god and the word was
[1:01:05] god and the word was made flesh and
[1:01:07] dwelt among us and that uniting is
[1:01:10] taking place
[1:01:12] just exactly according to john 14 where
[1:01:15] he said he that believeth on me
[1:01:19] the same works that i do shall you do
[1:01:22] also amen it's the same life being made
[1:01:25] manifest now notice where we're at
[1:01:27] because we're talking about the rapture
[1:01:30] we're talking about the rapture of the
[1:01:32] church of the living god to know that
[1:01:35] that is the promise in this hour that is
[1:01:37] upon us that is the promise that all
[1:01:40] have looked for and waited for they have
[1:01:43] longed for this time to come now notice
[1:01:46] what takes place here because in this
[1:01:49] uniting for rapture
[1:01:51] notice the saints themselves are the
[1:01:54] very ones who are dead in christ they
[1:01:57] rise first and when they rise then we
[1:02:00] unite with them
[1:02:02] and as we unite with them you see when
[1:02:04] they rise we unite with them because
[1:02:07] when the bride gets there to him
[1:02:09] remember he will not set his foot upon
[1:02:12] this earth
[1:02:13] the bible said we meet him in the air
[1:02:16] is that right so the dead in christ
[1:02:19] shall rise first not all the dead the
[1:02:21] dead in christ shall rise first and then
[1:02:24] we which are alive and remain shall be
[1:02:27] changed in a moment and a twinkling in
[1:02:29] an eye brother brahman says the ones
[1:02:32] that's living that's uniting themselves
[1:02:35] with the word and those that are gone
[1:02:37] already did that and it all comes
[1:02:40] together and makes one great union of
[1:02:42] the uniting going on affair now when we
[1:02:46] think about uniting with the word you
[1:02:48] know you cannot unite with the bible
[1:02:52] come on you cannot unite with the bible
[1:02:54] we can carry it around but you cannot
[1:02:57] unite with the bible but you can unite
[1:03:00] with the word i'm talking about the
[1:03:02] person of jesus christ and when that
[1:03:06] uniting takes place then that word on
[1:03:10] the inside begins to identify itself it
[1:03:14] identifies the experience in our life in
[1:03:18] the word you see because any experience
[1:03:20] that has to go outside of the word is
[1:03:23] not a true
[1:03:24] barrenly born again experience but a
[1:03:27] real experience from god is the spirit
[1:03:30] of truth baptizing us into the body of
[1:03:33] jesus christ and he said the spirit of
[1:03:35] truth will lead and guide us into all
[1:03:38] truth what does the spirit of truth
[1:03:40] produce it produces a life of truth
[1:03:43] whereby that it reflects this word in
[1:03:46] action
[1:03:47] now when we look at this this uniting
[1:03:51] it's a real culmination in this hour
[1:03:53] that we're living in
[1:03:55] iran would tell us communism has to rise
[1:03:59] all these things has to rise the church
[1:04:02] has to unite itself nations out there in
[1:04:05] the world council of churches and the
[1:04:07] bride has to unite itself under the word
[1:04:10] of god now this is very key here let me
[1:04:12] just drop this and the bride has to
[1:04:15] unite herself
[1:04:16] under the word of god
[1:04:19] in order to do that god has sent down
[1:04:23] the heavenly sign and things to prove to
[1:04:25] the church as he has to the nation now
[1:04:29] in second timothy chapter 4 verse 7
[1:04:32] pardon me just a minute
[1:04:36] paul says it like this
[1:04:38] i have fought a good fight i have
[1:04:40] finished my course i have kept the faith
[1:04:43] henceforth there is laid up for me a
[1:04:46] crown of righteousness
[1:04:48] and the crown is not something that goes
[1:04:50] on your head
[1:04:51] but that is a new body that is the body
[1:04:54] that peter said you have a body reserved
[1:04:57] in the heavens
[1:04:58] right it is that of the celestial
[1:05:01] is that right
[1:05:02] so here at the crown of righteousness
[1:05:04] see that that's a crowning notice which
[1:05:07] the lord the righteous judge shall give
[1:05:09] me at that day and not to me only but
[1:05:12] unto all them also that love his
[1:05:15] appearing
[1:05:16] so the very thing of his appearing it is
[1:05:19] of his own presence his life even now
[1:05:22] think about it down through the ages the
[1:05:25] holy spirit has been appearing in his
[1:05:28] word and manifesting that word to each
[1:05:31] of the seven gentile ages is that right
[1:05:34] we find that time to where uh the space
[1:05:37] of time to where god would let daniel
[1:05:40] know all of those junctions and points
[1:05:42] of time but within that was a mystery
[1:05:45] that paul would write about the mystery
[1:05:47] of god the hidden mystery that was not
[1:05:50] revealed to them and that hidden mystery
[1:05:53] was where that christ himself would take
[1:05:56] a bride it was a bride that was given
[1:05:58] before the foundation of the world just
[1:06:00] like it was with we understand this with
[1:06:02] joseph when joseph was in exile or he
[1:06:05] was rejected he he took a gentile bride
[1:06:10] is that right so here we find that in
[1:06:12] this and it is time jesus remember he
[1:06:15] had said upon this rock i will build my
[1:06:19] church so the appearing of what we're
[1:06:21] we're looking at even right now we are
[1:06:24] witnessing the appearing of the lord you
[1:06:27] see the appearing and coming brother man
[1:06:29] will differentiate and put the
[1:06:30] difference within those words he
[1:06:33] appearing right now is a sign of his
[1:06:36] coming he's appearing in his church in
[1:06:39] the form of the holy spirit showing that
[1:06:42] it's him because man cannot do these
[1:06:45] things it's the holy spirit that's doing
[1:06:48] it so it takes the peering the appearing
[1:06:52] recognizing the appearing recognizing
[1:06:55] that grace and may being made ready for
[1:06:57] the coming of the lord you see all of
[1:07:00] those that have they have fallen asleep
[1:07:03] and they are resting there and they are
[1:07:05] awaiting that promise of the rapture
[1:07:08] they they have been looking for this
[1:07:10] moment they lived according to the word
[1:07:13] that god gave them in that day it was it
[1:07:16] was something that so gripped their
[1:07:18] hearts and their life they lived by the
[1:07:21] appearing of god and they came into the
[1:07:25] fellowship with jesus christ by the holy
[1:07:28] ghost now notice within this preparation
[1:07:31] of the hour there's many many many types
[1:07:34] within this because the scriptures
[1:07:36] themselves holding there of the types
[1:07:39] and everything as we said before the
[1:07:41] bible itself was written for this day
[1:07:44] it was written from this moment because
[1:07:46] this bible it is not stories it's not of
[1:07:49] just it's not a collection of past
[1:07:51] events it is prophecy this is a book of
[1:07:55] prophecy in many times when you find
[1:07:58] that the prophets themselves they would
[1:08:00] speak there would be a prophesying that
[1:08:02] would go out but then you find in many
[1:08:05] other lives that though they didn't say
[1:08:07] anything out here but their lives was a
[1:08:10] prophecy of what would come to pass in
[1:08:13] the lives of others just like in this
[1:08:15] hour with rebecca rebecca's life she did
[1:08:18] never prophesied but her life prophesied
[1:08:21] that there would be a bride come in the
[1:08:24] evening time that would be stirred to go
[1:08:27] to the waters of life oh my so all of
[1:08:30] these things that that lay in here they
[1:08:33] speak even of this hour so there's a
[1:08:35] preparation for this hour in the bible
[1:08:38] in in hebrews chapter 11 verse 6 the
[1:08:42] bible says this is very important
[1:08:44] without faith it is impossible to please
[1:08:48] god
[1:08:49] for he that cometh to god
[1:08:51] must believe that he is and that he is a
[1:08:54] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:08:58] him
[1:08:59] by faith noah being warned of god of
[1:09:03] things not seen as yet
[1:09:05] moved with fear
[1:09:07] prepared an ark to the saving of his
[1:09:10] house by the which he condemned the
[1:09:12] world and became heir of the
[1:09:14] righteousness which is by faith now to
[1:09:18] think how that god god here he announces
[1:09:23] judgment is coming upon the earth
[1:09:26] but notice within the midst of that the
[1:09:29] judgment is coming god has seen the very
[1:09:32] heart of man the wickedness and seeing
[1:09:34] all the violence seen everything that's
[1:09:35] going on and and notice but before
[1:09:38] judgment can come
[1:09:40] god gives a message of mercy now the
[1:09:44] message itself when many of them would
[1:09:46] hear noah preaching the message that
[1:09:48] there is rain coming and there's going
[1:09:50] to be a deluge that's going to come that
[1:09:53] you're not going to be able to escape it
[1:09:55] now when you consider what it says in
[1:09:57] the scriptures regarding that time of
[1:10:00] noah the bible calls those waters
[1:10:03] prevailing waters is that right
[1:10:06] you tie that into the book of
[1:10:07] revelations and it speaks of the great
[1:10:10] that sets upon the waters which is
[1:10:13] a multitude of people so hear these
[1:10:16] spirits working in the earth and notice
[1:10:19] with them waters it was already spoken
[1:10:21] the waters were going to rise so that if
[1:10:24] a person could go to the highest point
[1:10:27] on earth the waters would cover even the
[1:10:30] highest point you say what are you
[1:10:32] saying it doesn't matter you could be of
[1:10:34] the highest highest moral person but
[1:10:37] that does not lead way to escape the
[1:10:40] prevailing waters of judgment good
[1:10:43] morality is wonderful but there's only
[1:10:45] one place of safety and that's in the
[1:10:48] blood of jesus christ because those
[1:10:51] waters are prevailing waters
[1:10:53] come on friends we're living in a time
[1:10:56] where people have withstood certain
[1:10:57] things and now they go along with it
[1:10:59] where we have homosexuality in the
[1:11:01] churches and everything else one time
[1:11:04] where things were stood against but what
[1:11:06] is it it's prevailing waters that are
[1:11:09] present and are trying to encroach your
[1:11:12] waters are joining together think about
[1:11:14] what it did in the days of noah there
[1:11:16] was that of a joining together but in
[1:11:19] the midst of that time what i want to
[1:11:20] focus on is god made a preparation
[1:11:25] because before god does anything he
[1:11:27] gives ample time
[1:11:29] he gives a lot of warning
[1:11:32] a lot of warning
[1:11:34] before judgment
[1:11:36] god sent a voice
[1:11:38] and he warned the people to flee from
[1:11:40] the wrath that was to come
[1:11:42] the bible identifies noah was a preacher
[1:11:46] of righteousness
[1:11:48] and think about it how he stood there in
[1:11:50] the door of the ark and he spoke that
[1:11:54] message
[1:11:55] you see we're living brother brown would
[1:11:57] say it like this we're living in the
[1:11:59] hour of preparation we're living when
[1:12:02] you're preparing the people to believe
[1:12:06] all things so god himself is the one who
[1:12:11] is present preparing his children to
[1:12:14] believe all things
[1:12:16] not just some of the promises but to
[1:12:19] believe all things
[1:12:21] that's an achievement of god that
[1:12:24] produces itself in the life of the
[1:12:26] believer and he says we believe that the
[1:12:28] message of the day the preparation time
[1:12:31] is jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:12:35] and forever so what is that preparation
[1:12:39] that preparation is the baptism of the
[1:12:42] holy ghost
[1:12:44] it's god made provision within this hour
[1:12:47] that there would be a preparation made
[1:12:50] for the children of god to be able to
[1:12:53] escape that which is coming upon the
[1:12:55] earth
[1:12:57] now when you you consider this here and
[1:12:59] you look at it his coming
[1:13:02] the bible identifies that his coming
[1:13:05] will be as a thief
[1:13:09] it tells us to watch
[1:13:12] and be ready
[1:13:15] and yet this is the mystery it's a
[1:13:18] secret work because a thief doesn't
[1:13:20] announce when he's coming
[1:13:23] right
[1:13:24] he doesn't announce hey i'm going to
[1:13:25] show up at this particular day and this
[1:13:28] particular time that's not a thief
[1:13:30] that's a robber
[1:13:32] but a thief comes
[1:13:34] in a manner of unexpectedness
[1:13:39] right
[1:13:39] now
[1:13:40] that that announcement that he said i'll
[1:13:42] come as a thief in the night he was not
[1:13:45] saying that it would be unexpected to
[1:13:48] the believer
[1:13:49] this is why paul could write and he
[1:13:51] would say you are not children of the
[1:13:54] night
[1:13:54] you are children of the day
[1:13:57] he would write that you would not be
[1:14:00] ignorant of these things that are coming
[1:14:02] upon you see god has made a way through
[1:14:06] and by that preparation of the holy
[1:14:08] spirit it's a secret work
[1:14:10] yet it is open before all
[1:14:15] it's a secret work but yet it's open
[1:14:18] before all
[1:14:20] you see when you consider it his coming
[1:14:23] as we look at that it comes as a thief a
[1:14:26] thief in the night it speaks that there
[1:14:28] would be of an unawareness and an
[1:14:30] unpreparedness a time that would that
[1:14:33] would catch people by surprise but you
[1:14:35] see god knows that even within our lives
[1:14:40] you and i could not be found ready and
[1:14:43] for that moment if god himself in his
[1:14:46] grace did not did uh give to you and i a
[1:14:50] sign in this hour and begin to deal with
[1:14:54] our lives to bring us into that place of
[1:14:57] expectation
[1:14:59] you and i would not be ready we would be
[1:15:01] like the rest you say what are you
[1:15:02] saying because to recognize as we begin
[1:15:05] to look into these things the world
[1:15:08] itself even the church world different
[1:15:10] ones they can talk about the rapture but
[1:15:12] they fail to recognize remember the
[1:15:14] migration that there has to be a uniting
[1:15:18] with the word first before there ever is
[1:15:21] a uniting with the dead in christ and
[1:15:24] then there is a going to meet him in the
[1:15:27] air
[1:15:28] so all of these are necessary
[1:15:31] successions here or folds or things that
[1:15:34] must take place it's a secret work yet
[1:15:37] it's open before all
[1:15:39] now let me just let me refer back to
[1:15:40] that scripture that we were reading when
[1:15:43] we look at look at psalms 86 verse 11
[1:15:46] david said teach me thy way o lord and i
[1:15:50] will walk in thy truth unite my heart to
[1:15:54] fear
[1:15:56] thy name
[1:15:57] now to think this is david you know as
[1:16:00] he's praying and and he's asking god the
[1:16:04] grace of god teach me and that which is
[1:16:07] taught lord that i will walk in your
[1:16:09] truth and unite my heart to fear thy
[1:16:12] name there must this is the uniting that
[1:16:15] must take place and must go on is that
[1:16:18] the heart itself must be united to god
[1:16:24] it's not enough just to know his word
[1:16:29] is that right
[1:16:30] the bible said the devil believes and he
[1:16:32] trembles that's not enough but it's to
[1:16:36] know him is life
[1:16:39] is that right and when you know him
[1:16:41] that's life it doesn't mean you can
[1:16:43] explain everything in here
[1:16:45] but when you know him who is life then
[1:16:47] there is a faith that comes into your
[1:16:50] life to be able to stand upon his word
[1:16:53] and to recognize his voice and say i
[1:16:56] don't know how but i believe it and i
[1:16:59] know i'm a part of it and you're able to
[1:17:01] stand there now listen we're not
[1:17:02] drifting from noah noah had faith there
[1:17:06] was a faith that had raised within
[1:17:08] noah's life by faith
[1:17:10] noah himself had received a message from
[1:17:14] god now that same that same faith that
[1:17:18] moved within noah and noah's heart is
[1:17:20] the same faith that would move within
[1:17:23] the hearts of all that would be a part
[1:17:26] of that working that was taking place
[1:17:28] and would enter into the ark
[1:17:31] now when they think of this
[1:17:33] in this time because we're talking about
[1:17:35] the preparation that god has made the
[1:17:38] uniting taking place before that of the
[1:17:42] change of the body first thessalonians 4
[1:17:44] 16 says for the lord himself shall
[1:17:48] descend from heaven with a shout with
[1:17:52] the voice of the archangel and with the
[1:17:54] trump of god so we recognize that all
[1:17:57] three of these it all all three take
[1:18:00] place while he's descending but all
[1:18:04] three of them they are they are three
[1:18:06] distinct happenings three distinct folds
[1:18:10] that are taking place and the shout
[1:18:13] notice it's the lord himself this is not
[1:18:16] this is not a a man's message this is
[1:18:19] the lord himself descending with a shout
[1:18:24] and that is the message that is calling
[1:18:26] to get the people together to get them
[1:18:29] ready amen for that great event of the
[1:18:33] rapture the matter of fact that's even
[1:18:35] what's taking place right now the
[1:18:37] rapture is not something we're looking
[1:18:38] for the rapture is something that you
[1:18:41] become a part of by the holy ghost
[1:18:44] because the rapture is a catching away i
[1:18:48] tell you if you're not called away from
[1:18:49] the world right now if you're not caught
[1:18:51] away from worldly habits right now if
[1:18:53] you're not cut away from the world
[1:18:56] you're not part of the catching away
[1:18:58] that's going to take place there but
[1:19:00] there's a provision there is a power
[1:19:03] that is present the lord himself to
[1:19:05] catch us away in rapturing grace right
[1:19:08] now that makes us ready for that moment
[1:19:11] oh glory be to god i'm grateful for that
[1:19:14] there is rapturing grace right now for
[1:19:17] those that are sick in their body to
[1:19:19] catch us away from sickness
[1:19:21] there is grace to catch away from
[1:19:22] depression come on church there's grace
[1:19:25] here to catch away from anxiety there's
[1:19:27] grace here that moves to catch us away
[1:19:30] you say why how can you say that because
[1:19:32] the lord the lord himself is present
[1:19:36] right here among his children according
[1:19:38] to his word it's not the corporal body
[1:19:41] but it is the entire holy spirit that is
[1:19:44] right here in the church of the living
[1:19:46] god he's anointing our faith with divine
[1:19:49] inspiration that is being poured out in
[1:19:52] this hour
[1:19:54] oh brother oh my what a time to move in
[1:19:57] this hour what a time to move in this
[1:20:00] hour a time to move on in to the word of
[1:20:03] god as the word is right here before us
[1:20:06] you see
[1:20:07] uh when we look at and you consider
[1:20:10] even this preparation that's taking
[1:20:12] place
[1:20:13] you think about the ministry of brother
[1:20:16] branham they're a malachi 4.
[1:20:18] so forth
[1:20:20] remember
[1:20:21] signs and wonders that took place
[1:20:26] unparalleled
[1:20:29] are you hearing me
[1:20:31] signs and wonder it was a promise behold
[1:20:33] i send unto you elijah before that great
[1:20:37] and dreadful day of the lord
[1:20:39] right we know there's two parts within
[1:20:41] that there was a john the baptist part
[1:20:43] and then here a last day why there must
[1:20:45] be a calling back to the original
[1:20:49] sacrifice
[1:20:50] calling it away from churchism
[1:20:53] traditions of man and calling it back to
[1:20:55] the original altar of god where the
[1:20:58] altar of god has been forsaken but there
[1:21:01] is come a repair to the altar of
[1:21:03] almighty god
[1:21:05] the truth that was scattered has been
[1:21:07] assembled in this hour and the power of
[1:21:10] god has come down among the church of
[1:21:13] the living god in this hour it's god
[1:21:16] vindicating his presence it's god coming
[1:21:18] down vindicating his word it's god
[1:21:21] coming down and expressing his love that
[1:21:24] every promise he made that you and i are
[1:21:27] partakers of that promise
[1:21:29] i tell you right now if you're sluggish
[1:21:31] at all i'd shake myself this morning i'm
[1:21:34] not talking about tiredness in your mind
[1:21:36] i'm talking about if there's anything
[1:21:38] that's holding you back from the every
[1:21:41] promise of almighty god i would shake
[1:21:43] myself this morning and i would accept
[1:21:46] that anointing of the holy ghost to move
[1:21:49] down and let that word be made alive and
[1:21:52] real in my life the lord himself who is
[1:21:55] this among us
[1:21:56] the lord himself
[1:21:59] is that right
[1:22:01] many scriptures we could go into that
[1:22:03] tile that together revelations 10 1 and
[1:22:06] on and on we can go
[1:22:08] but notice
[1:22:09] this as it speaks in revelations 19 7
[1:22:13] because with all the signs and wonders
[1:22:15] that are done
[1:22:17] if there's not a message that comes
[1:22:19] behind that
[1:22:20] then it's not of god
[1:22:24] because the signs and wonders are to get
[1:22:27] us to stand still
[1:22:30] and hear the message
[1:22:32] many of them followed jesus for the
[1:22:34] loaves and bread and they were
[1:22:36] filled naturally
[1:22:39] but when you begin to speak except you
[1:22:41] eat the flesh of the son of man and
[1:22:44] drink his blood
[1:22:46] they couldn't stand it the bible said
[1:22:48] they said this is a hard saying john
[1:22:51] chapter 6 verse 66
[1:22:54] this is a hard staying saying who can
[1:22:58] understand this
[1:22:59] and many of his disciples are you
[1:23:01] hearing me they were disciples up to
[1:23:04] that point they could say we are
[1:23:07] following the message we are following
[1:23:10] that of the lord jesus the messiah but
[1:23:12] you see the word continues to open what
[1:23:16] was the word doing the word is declaring
[1:23:18] its authority who it is that's present
[1:23:21] and when the word declares its authority
[1:23:24] it will reveal those that are following
[1:23:26] are they really part of that or not
[1:23:30] are you hearing me we're not talking
[1:23:31] about just quoting the message we're not
[1:23:33] talking about just quoting the doctrines
[1:23:35] we're talking about coming under the
[1:23:38] life and the headship of the word
[1:23:43] talking about a preparation here all
[1:23:45] right there's a preparation going on let
[1:23:47] me tell you something this preparation
[1:23:49] that noah received let me tell you there
[1:23:52] was many boats that was being built in
[1:23:54] that hour
[1:23:55] many boats that was being built there
[1:23:57] was many men that were good shipbuilders
[1:23:59] are you hearing me now but notice noah's
[1:24:02] build was not built where it was close
[1:24:05] to water but god had him build it on dry
[1:24:08] land
[1:24:09] why because noah's message was not
[1:24:12] something that had to work things up but
[1:24:14] it was a message that when he stayed
[1:24:17] with that word the water would come to
[1:24:19] that ship it would lift it up i tell you
[1:24:22] that's why the preaching of the word
[1:24:24] when will stay with the word the same
[1:24:26] holy ghost who is the word and david
[1:24:28] he'll come to that word
[1:24:31] he'll come and lift that word up that's
[1:24:33] the same way in your life
[1:24:35] he comes to lift up his word
[1:24:40] he kind of looked at knowing so what in
[1:24:41] the world are you doing
[1:24:42] building a boat clear out here
[1:24:44] but the difference with noah's built it
[1:24:47] was god
[1:24:48] constructed
[1:24:52] they could have sat there and debated
[1:24:53] with noah all day didn't matter noah
[1:24:55] kept on working
[1:24:58] he knew what god had called him to do
[1:25:02] is that right
[1:25:04] oh my you know there's probably no doubt
[1:25:06] there were people in that day that
[1:25:07] wanted to try to tell noah you turned
[1:25:09] the corner here wrong or you done this
[1:25:10] wrong but noah said i know where my
[1:25:13] instructions come from sometimes noah
[1:25:15] could say there's things that are said
[1:25:17] that i myself don't even understand but
[1:25:20] i'm following the revelation and the
[1:25:23] unction of the holy spirit oh my what
[1:25:25] was happening it was a place of safety
[1:25:28] that was there in the unseen but now
[1:25:31] becoming visible and tangible
[1:25:35] oh god help us
[1:25:37] think about this
[1:25:38] in revelations chapter 19 the bible says
[1:25:41] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[1:25:44] honor to him for the marriage of the
[1:25:46] lamb
[1:25:47] is come
[1:25:48] and his wife hath made herself ready
[1:25:50] that could not have happened in any
[1:25:52] other age it couldn't have happened
[1:25:55] but in this age the announcement the
[1:25:58] marriage of the lamb is come
[1:26:01] and his wife hath made herself ready
[1:26:04] so in order to make herself ready all
[1:26:07] the other types that are given in the
[1:26:09] scripture like esther there has to be a
[1:26:12] provision that is made that she will
[1:26:15] actually declare that she is part of the
[1:26:18] bride by submitting to the word that's
[1:26:20] given in that hour as the word will deal
[1:26:23] with her life just like it dealt with
[1:26:25] esther's life and she will become
[1:26:27] adorned with that same glory to go in
[1:26:30] before the king
[1:26:32] oh my you see she's retaking and she is
[1:26:36] receiving what has already been given to
[1:26:39] her now i want you to catch this very
[1:26:40] closely because sometimes i i'm just
[1:26:43] gonna just kind of drop back into a
[1:26:44] different gear
[1:26:46] sometimes we this is where we really
[1:26:48] need to evaluate in our own lives
[1:26:50] that we're not just coming to hear a
[1:26:53] sermon
[1:26:55] i didn't come here to preach a sermon
[1:26:57] i'm not looking for things to put
[1:26:59] together
[1:27:00] i'm not looking for things to put
[1:27:01] together i i want to move by that
[1:27:04] inspiration that god has given within
[1:27:06] this hour
[1:27:08] that's what we want to do god knows the
[1:27:10] needs of what we have need of in this
[1:27:12] hour
[1:27:13] but but sometimes i wonder if what we do
[1:27:15] is we hear it but then we don't even act
[1:27:18] upon the word
[1:27:19] you see nothing can come if you never
[1:27:22] act on it
[1:27:24] you must first believe it
[1:27:27] i can't preach on this today but in
[1:27:29] order for a miracle to take place you
[1:27:32] first must believe the word
[1:27:35] and then you must act on the word and
[1:27:37] then the miracle will follow it you can
[1:27:40] sit here and believe it but if you don't
[1:27:41] act on it there's no miracle going to
[1:27:44] come
[1:27:45] look at the woman the little woman widow
[1:27:47] of zerepath remember the word spoke to
[1:27:50] her it said bake me a cake first she had
[1:27:53] to believe the word she had to act on
[1:27:56] the word and when she believed it and
[1:27:58] act on it then the miracle came and the
[1:28:01] mill bell never ran empty the cruce of
[1:28:04] all it never ran dry why there was a
[1:28:06] miracle follows believing and acting on
[1:28:10] the word of god
[1:28:11] and noah was believing the word he was
[1:28:14] acting on the word of god what was noah
[1:28:16] doing he was preparing for a miracle to
[1:28:20] take place
[1:28:22] oh glory be to god in the highest
[1:28:25] notice in verse 8 of revelations 19 i'm
[1:28:28] trying to hurry and to her was granted
[1:28:31] that she should be arrayed in fine line
[1:28:33] and clean and white for the fine linen
[1:28:35] is the righteousness of the saints
[1:28:39] you see what sea is adorned in it speaks
[1:28:42] of how the bridegroom himself looks and
[1:28:45] looks upon her
[1:28:47] because remember that fine linen of the
[1:28:49] righteousness of the saints is a
[1:28:51] reflection of the same adornment that he
[1:28:53] wore the word made flesh
[1:28:56] and that same adornment there is in her
[1:28:59] life what is that of the fine linen it's
[1:29:01] the son of man in flesh once again it's
[1:29:04] the same power the same glory the same
[1:29:07] living god and to her was granted that
[1:29:10] she should be adorned in the fine linen
[1:29:13] which is the righteousness of the saints
[1:29:15] oh my we are not failing a creed we're
[1:29:18] not failing a tradition we are veiling
[1:29:21] the living god in our lives oh don't
[1:29:24] look at these badger skins but look at
[1:29:26] the glory that is behind the badger skin
[1:29:30] on the inside oh my it was the same
[1:29:33] glory that was originally spoken there
[1:29:36] by moses but once that revelation went
[1:29:39] forth out of moses it went to its
[1:29:42] destination which is there behind the
[1:29:45] veil
[1:29:46] where has this word made its way it
[1:29:49] makes its way into our soul it's not
[1:29:52] there under our arm it's not a picture
[1:29:54] on the wall that word is to become flesh
[1:29:57] this message was an announcement the
[1:30:00] bride is coming and the announcement is
[1:30:03] she is now here
[1:30:08] and he said to me this is what he said
[1:30:10] blessed are they
[1:30:13] which are called
[1:30:14] unto the marriage supper of the lamb now
[1:30:17] the marriage supper of the lamb but you
[1:30:20] see in order
[1:30:22] to get to the marriage supper
[1:30:24] you got to have the wedding garment
[1:30:26] in order to have the wedding garments
[1:30:28] you got to have an invitation
[1:30:29] and in order to have an invitation you
[1:30:31] had to have your name on the guestbook
[1:30:34] are you hearing me now
[1:30:36] i mean if you show up to a wedding they
[1:30:37] say
[1:30:38] i wasn't expecting you
[1:30:40] you know right away you you ask them
[1:30:42] that they need help in the kitchen
[1:30:44] you might be able to be there they might
[1:30:45] say we'll see if they've got any
[1:30:46] leftovers but you see in order there's
[1:30:48] an invitation that must be given
[1:30:50] remember the gentleman who shows up the
[1:30:52] man who shows up in the parable and he
[1:30:54] shows up and here the lord of the
[1:30:56] wedding there goes forth and said hey
[1:30:59] he noticed him without a wedding garment
[1:31:00] all said how did you get in here
[1:31:03] friend he knew him friend
[1:31:05] as a church member
[1:31:07] he knew him he was acquainted with him
[1:31:09] but how did you get in here
[1:31:11] he didn't have on the wedding garment
[1:31:13] because the wedding garment is what
[1:31:15] neutralizes all the differences
[1:31:18] what is the wedding garment it's that
[1:31:20] fine linen what is that fine linen in
[1:31:22] that wedding garment it's the baptism of
[1:31:25] the holy ghost brother it neutralizes
[1:31:28] all these things all the differences
[1:31:30] that you and i could have the
[1:31:31] differences in our makeups and
[1:31:33] everything else but the baptism of the
[1:31:35] holy ghost moving down in the word it
[1:31:38] brings a oneness a gathering a unity
[1:31:42] with one mind one purpose one heart
[1:31:47] but we're called into the marriage
[1:31:49] supper
[1:31:50] of the lamb
[1:31:51] now remember
[1:31:52] the shout that we read
[1:31:54] that's the message going forth the
[1:31:56] living bread together the people
[1:31:59] together
[1:32:00] unto him not gone into a church
[1:32:02] but gathering the people unto him
[1:32:06] the word in a uniting that's what we're
[1:32:07] reading about
[1:32:09] then comes the voice of the archangel
[1:32:11] that voice of resurrection that moves
[1:32:14] down to call forth the dead in christ
[1:32:17] just like it stood there that day and
[1:32:20] called lazarus forth in that hour
[1:32:24] and then that in itself leads to the
[1:32:26] trump of god remember what a trump is it
[1:32:28] is an assembling together so every one
[1:32:32] of these junctions is an assembling or a
[1:32:35] uniting and that trump of god is an
[1:32:38] assembling to meet him in the air to go
[1:32:41] to the wedding supper
[1:32:43] so while the tribulation is taking place
[1:32:45] upon the earth for three and a half
[1:32:47] years and israel receives her visitation
[1:32:50] the bride is caught away in the palace
[1:32:53] in a wedding supper with him
[1:32:55] then he slips away and he makes himself
[1:32:57] known to that of the jews is that right
[1:33:00] he reveals himself then he slips from
[1:33:02] there comes back up and there is an
[1:33:04] assembling there in revelations 19
[1:33:07] whereby that the faithful and chosen
[1:33:10] ride with him and come down here to the
[1:33:12] earth for the battle of armageddon
[1:33:15] oh my i wish i had some time to preach
[1:33:18] here this morning
[1:33:19] oh my what a privileged friends that we
[1:33:22] are called to in this hour but don't
[1:33:24] don't don't let that privilege and
[1:33:27] opportunity pass you by
[1:33:30] take full advantage of this moment
[1:33:33] it's god's grace that's given to you and
[1:33:35] i you might say well that seems awful
[1:33:37] hard you're dealing with this and
[1:33:39] dealing with that but that's god's grace
[1:33:41] it's grace that is present to correct us
[1:33:44] when we're wrong it's grace that comes
[1:33:47] that you and i can be led into a place
[1:33:49] of real fellowship with him
[1:33:52] notice these are the true
[1:33:54] sayings of god
[1:33:57] united so here are these true sayings of
[1:33:59] god this is how
[1:34:01] the the the bride of christ is united
[1:34:04] with him
[1:34:05] by the holy spirit she's receiving she's
[1:34:08] coming under that word
[1:34:10] she's coming under that word you know
[1:34:11] how when god begins to deal with the
[1:34:13] life and god will speak through that
[1:34:15] life and he'll convict you of your sin
[1:34:17] and let you know you're a sinner there
[1:34:19] has to be a coming under that promise
[1:34:22] that i am a sinner and i need a savior
[1:34:24] and as you keep walking with the word
[1:34:26] then the word will point out that you
[1:34:28] need a complete deliverance you need a
[1:34:31] sanctifying and the blood is present to
[1:34:34] cleanse you what has to happen you must
[1:34:36] come under that what's happening you in
[1:34:38] your life we are being reduced to fully
[1:34:41] come under the word then the word will
[1:34:44] speak to you and i and he will deal with
[1:34:46] us and say with the right thinking and
[1:34:49] just agreeing that's not enough but
[1:34:51] there's got to come a reproducing of
[1:34:53] that life to where it is christ on the
[1:34:56] inside reflecting his life what is it
[1:34:58] now there must be a coming under that
[1:35:00] word so it is a uniting with that word
[1:35:05] because no man just runs out on the
[1:35:07] street and grabs a woman that says
[1:35:08] you're going to be my bride
[1:35:11] if he does you'll be reading about him
[1:35:12] in the paper of course he'll be with all
[1:35:15] the rest of them in the paper anyhow
[1:35:17] and i'm not making a lot of that but you
[1:35:19] understand what i'm saying there is a
[1:35:20] progression
[1:35:22] right so this is why that that that that
[1:35:25] to the bride of jesus christ this rap
[1:35:28] this revelation of the rapture
[1:35:31] it is revealed to her
[1:35:34] by the grace of almighty god
[1:35:37] this is not what men have sent around
[1:35:39] and drummed up
[1:35:40] but this is god in his grace you and i
[1:35:43] would not even know nowhere to go in the
[1:35:45] word of god in this hour listen brother
[1:35:47] madam sent right there and told us in
[1:35:49] the message the rapture he said the holy
[1:35:51] spirit comes in we wouldn't even know
[1:35:53] where to look at in the word he said but
[1:35:55] the holy ghost gets a hold of the
[1:35:57] promises and he begins to lay out the
[1:36:00] picture of the hour and identify where
[1:36:03] we're at it is an operation of the holy
[1:36:06] ghost
[1:36:08] oh my so faith notice what faith itself
[1:36:11] it is that which is revealed because
[1:36:14] faith is a revelation it's something
[1:36:17] that's been revealed to you like like
[1:36:19] with abraham where it was revealed to
[1:36:21] him and when it was revealed abraham
[1:36:24] called anything contrary
[1:36:26] as though it was not
[1:36:28] when it was made known it didn't matter
[1:36:30] what it was
[1:36:32] are you hearing me now it doesn't matter
[1:36:34] where you're sitting at i don't care
[1:36:36] what even is in front of you i don't
[1:36:38] care what it is that you might see in
[1:36:40] your life i don't care how big the devil
[1:36:42] wants to make that mountain that
[1:36:44] mountain shall become a plane
[1:36:48] there's nothing that can stand in the
[1:36:50] presence of almighty god you let the
[1:36:52] pulsation of the holy ghost begin to
[1:36:55] pulsate in your heart that i am the lord
[1:36:58] i am the lord i am your redeemer i am
[1:37:02] your deliverer i am your healer i am
[1:37:05] your all in all you let him begin to
[1:37:07] pulsate in your life like that you'll
[1:37:09] watch that mountain it will fall in the
[1:37:12] presence of the lord god almighty
[1:37:15] it doesn't matter what it is in your
[1:37:17] life if it's a less devil it shall
[1:37:19] become a plane
[1:37:21] it doesn't matter what that is that's
[1:37:23] there before you there is a god that's
[1:37:26] here to take that mountain down what do
[1:37:29] i do speak to that mountain
[1:37:32] speak to that mountain
[1:37:35] hallelujah
[1:37:36] be plucked up and removed to yonder sea
[1:37:39] we're not worked up we know exactly
[1:37:42] where we're at
[1:37:45] hallelujah well i don't know if i'm
[1:37:47] worthy or not it's not about whether you
[1:37:49] feel worthy or not he has made you
[1:37:52] worthy and what he's asked for you to do
[1:37:55] do it
[1:37:59] hallelujah you want water in the vessels
[1:38:02] go fill them up you want wine go fill
[1:38:04] them up
[1:38:05] don't question it just do what he said
[1:38:07] do
[1:38:10] the bible's true you repent of your sins
[1:38:13] and you're baptized in the name of jesus
[1:38:15] christ you shall receive the gift of the
[1:38:18] holy ghost
[1:38:20] don't let the devil confuse your mind
[1:38:22] you stand right there on that promise
[1:38:24] because there's no confusion it isn't
[1:38:28] that god made a promise that he can't
[1:38:30] keep but the enemy's one to tell you a
[1:38:32] lie and tell you that it's not for you
[1:38:35] he's trying to hold things up in your
[1:38:36] mind and imagine oh i'm preaching now
[1:38:39] he's trying to hold imaginary thoughts
[1:38:41] in your mind and things before you but
[1:38:43] there is a presence of a living god
[1:38:46] right now you are under his wings you
[1:38:49] have authority to cast it down right now
[1:38:53] and pour your heart out and receive ye
[1:38:56] the holy ghost
[1:39:05] this revelation
[1:39:07] it has prevailing power in it
[1:39:11] you remember what we read in the opening
[1:39:13] chapter there psalms 86 david didn't say
[1:39:16] i'm mighty and strong he said i'm poor
[1:39:18] and needy
[1:39:21] in other words god you're my strength
[1:39:24] david already said the lord's a strength
[1:39:25] of my life no secret about it
[1:39:28] is that right so was his own strength
[1:39:33] saul did what saul wanted to do when
[1:39:35] saul wanted to do it saul had a real
[1:39:37] religion of convenience
[1:39:41] every anytime this is convenient okay or
[1:39:44] something comes up oh my goodness
[1:39:45] where's samuel uh something comes up
[1:39:47] here oh my goodness where's the pastor
[1:39:49] at oh my goodness where's the
[1:39:53] what about jesus
[1:39:56] what about jesus
[1:39:58] i i don't mean to i don't mean to hurt
[1:40:00] nobody's feeling but i'm not your holy
[1:40:01] ghost
[1:40:04] i ain't your holy ghost
[1:40:06] this ain't nicholas i can be victorious
[1:40:08] as long as i got brother samuel by my
[1:40:09] side you are victorious by the blood of
[1:40:12] the lamb you are victorious by the
[1:40:15] indwelling power of the holy ghost
[1:40:18] you've got the strength of almighty god
[1:40:20] within you that you can say i can do all
[1:40:23] things through christ that strengthens
[1:40:25] me
[1:40:26] that's right we might get weak once in a
[1:40:28] while and we might join our faith one to
[1:40:30] another you might say brother samuel i'm
[1:40:32] a little weak right now could we join
[1:40:34] our faith together and that faith be
[1:40:36] appropriated there absolutely we'll
[1:40:39] stand on that but let me tell you what
[1:40:41] we are doing together we are taking your
[1:40:43] mountain we are taking what belongs to
[1:40:46] you and god gives grace for that moment
[1:40:51] oh my
[1:40:52] it is a revelation
[1:40:55] to the bride of jesus christ a
[1:40:57] prevailing power
[1:40:59] of even when thoughts of doubt could
[1:41:01] swirl around your mind it's a prevailing
[1:41:04] power
[1:41:06] it'll direct you right into the word of
[1:41:09] god
[1:41:10] there's a prevailing power when the
[1:41:12] enemy says you're not gonna make it but
[1:41:15] there's a prevailing power that raises
[1:41:18] up on the inside i've already made it
[1:41:21] because christ jesus made it for me and
[1:41:24] i am accepted in the beloved i am united
[1:41:29] with my bridegroom
[1:41:34] oh my we're talking about access here
[1:41:36] this morning
[1:41:37] it's a prevailing power that when
[1:41:40] sickness or whatever it is that would
[1:41:42] try to come your way let me tell you
[1:41:44] friends we don't i'm not making light of
[1:41:45] one sickness i'm gonna make a lot of
[1:41:47] depression i don't make a lot of anxiety
[1:41:49] i don't make a lot of none of those
[1:41:50] things when the spirit of god is calling
[1:41:52] those things out he's not making light
[1:41:54] of it but i think in this hour that we
[1:41:57] need to take down what satan is trying
[1:42:00] to exalt and show this is powerful and
[1:42:02] i've got people under this i think we
[1:42:05] ought to hold up the banner of the old
[1:42:07] rugged cross i think we've got a message
[1:42:10] in this hour where the cross has come
[1:42:12] into view we've got a message with power
[1:42:15] to defeat amalek we've got a message
[1:42:17] that's able to drive back every darkness
[1:42:20] of devil and every demon out of hell
[1:42:22] we've got a message of divine glory and
[1:42:25] power
[1:42:27] don't take back on nothing we lift up
[1:42:29] the hands
[1:42:31] we hold up the hands what are you saying
[1:42:32] we're holding up this revealed word of
[1:42:35] the lord jesus christ because this
[1:42:37] message that god has sent is the message
[1:42:40] of jesus christ
[1:42:43] [Applause]
[1:42:46] hallelujah
[1:42:48] it's not what you can explain it's what
[1:42:50] you can believe
[1:42:54] they couldn't explain what jesus was
[1:42:56] saying
[1:42:57] i'm quoting out of the message rapture i
[1:42:59] think it's very fitting they couldn't
[1:43:00] explain it but they believed it
[1:43:03] many of them walked away
[1:43:05] they made a decision at that moment
[1:43:08] i can't walk with this no more
[1:43:12] because what this guy's saying there's
[1:43:14] things i'm finding in the bible that's
[1:43:15] contrary
[1:43:17] come friends y'all understand when jesus
[1:43:19] said except you know i've quoted this to
[1:43:21] you when he said except you eat the
[1:43:22] flesh of the son of man and drink his
[1:43:23] blood you have no life in you they could
[1:43:25] have taken scripture in leviticus 16 and
[1:43:28] said what about this
[1:43:30] but you see to discern the times
[1:43:33] is to discern who it is
[1:43:35] that's speaking to you
[1:43:39] because god himself is the interpreter
[1:43:42] of his own word
[1:43:44] he interprets it by bringing it to past
[1:43:48] and where they could have reason within
[1:43:50] it but you see even though the elected
[1:43:52] couldn't explain it they believed it
[1:43:55] what showed in their life the actions
[1:43:57] that came out of their life it showed
[1:44:00] that they really believed what
[1:44:03] was made known to them
[1:44:07] well i'll tell you just like this when
[1:44:09] we look at i've got to skip a few things
[1:44:11] you see there's that place of safety
[1:44:13] that god has made known to us in this
[1:44:16] hour and that's that place of safety
[1:44:19] that's under the blood
[1:44:21] of jesus christ
[1:44:24] you see
[1:44:26] the bible in this hour when we we talk
[1:44:28] about
[1:44:29] coming under the headship
[1:44:31] and the authority of the word just to
[1:44:34] think about it in this way
[1:44:37] if there were those in that day that
[1:44:39] could have said well
[1:44:42] i don't want to be in judgment i don't
[1:44:44] want to be under judgment but i don't
[1:44:46] want to get on noah's boat
[1:44:49] if you were going to be saved from
[1:44:50] judgment you had to walk past noah
[1:44:54] come on somebody
[1:44:55] it wasn't noah that saved them
[1:44:58] it was god saved them they wouldn't have
[1:45:01] known the judgment was coming but god
[1:45:04] found one man upon the earth that wasn't
[1:45:08] overtaken with the things of the world
[1:45:11] and god revealed himself to that man and
[1:45:14] there was a message of grace that came
[1:45:17] forth
[1:45:19] is that right
[1:45:21] now think about this here
[1:45:23] you see we're living in a time can i
[1:45:25] have a little bit more time
[1:45:28] well you know hey listen y'all don't
[1:45:30] mind waiting 45 minutes to get in a
[1:45:31] restaurant
[1:45:33] come on now
[1:45:34] you don't mind well
[1:45:36] hey it's no problem at all we'll just
[1:45:37] sit around but let's just let's just
[1:45:38] have a little time right now
[1:45:40] just give me just a few more moments
[1:45:42] isaiah chapter 4 verse 1
[1:45:45] in that day
[1:45:46] seven women shall take hold of one man
[1:45:50] saying
[1:45:51] we will eat our own bread
[1:45:54] and wear our own apparel only let us be
[1:45:58] called by thy name to take away thy
[1:46:01] approach
[1:46:02] see women are churches
[1:46:05] seven women there have been seven
[1:46:08] gentile ages
[1:46:10] and seven women will take hold upon one
[1:46:13] man
[1:46:14] who is that one man the lord jesus
[1:46:18] but notice they're telling him
[1:46:20] what they're gonna do
[1:46:24] we're going to wear our own apparel
[1:46:28] we're going to eat our own bread
[1:46:30] in other words believe our own what we
[1:46:32] want to believe
[1:46:34] and but when this was one thing we want
[1:46:36] to be called by your name to take away
[1:46:38] our reproach they realize if they're
[1:46:40] called by his name
[1:46:42] then then the reproach would be lifted
[1:46:45] but in order to be called by his name
[1:46:48] his name is his life made manifest and
[1:46:52] when his life is made manifest his life
[1:46:55] is the garment
[1:46:58] is the wedding garment is that right
[1:47:01] you see it's a clothing that comes upon
[1:47:03] that of the soul to be enshrouded with
[1:47:06] the blood of jesus christ we'll eat our
[1:47:08] own bread we'll believe what we want to
[1:47:09] believe but only let us be called by thy
[1:47:12] name that's impossible
[1:47:14] but it shows you in an hour in a time
[1:47:18] think about it where we're living in
[1:47:19] this hour and we're living in the time
[1:47:21] of ladies which is people's rights and
[1:47:25] the emboldenness to be able to even
[1:47:27] stand right in the face of the word and
[1:47:29] say this is what we want we'll take this
[1:47:32] this this and this but you give us your
[1:47:35] name but god don't operate that way
[1:47:38] god don't operate that way god does not
[1:47:41] come down to where we're at
[1:47:44] we must come to where he's at
[1:47:47] oh my you see they they want everything
[1:47:50] but they reject what brings a great
[1:47:54] certainty of the gospel of jesus christ
[1:47:56] they reject life but notice verse two i
[1:47:59] always like going to the let's go to
[1:48:01] this this next part this is where i'm
[1:48:03] identified
[1:48:04] verse two in that day
[1:48:06] shall the branch
[1:48:07] of the lord be beautiful and glorious
[1:48:11] and the fruit of the earth shall be
[1:48:13] excellent and comely for them that are
[1:48:16] escaped of israel now remember this is
[1:48:19] speaking not only of israel when israel
[1:48:21] receives that in the 144 000 but
[1:48:24] remember this also speaks of the bride
[1:48:27] of jesus christ in this hour jesus said
[1:48:30] you are the vine or i'm the vine you are
[1:48:32] the branches is that right remember when
[1:48:35] israel went astray in the book of psalms
[1:48:38] he would speak i will rise up my servant
[1:48:41] the branch and through that branch life
[1:48:44] would be restored and to think in this
[1:48:47] hour how that christ himself would move
[1:48:50] down through his word to call out a
[1:48:52] people for his name's sake and that his
[1:48:55] life would so be preeminent in the lives
[1:48:58] of the people that they would be
[1:49:00] identified as the branch of the lord the
[1:49:03] same characteristics of the lord jesus
[1:49:06] may manifest in a bride body
[1:49:10] oh my you see we're living in the time
[1:49:13] of the fulfillment of god's word of that
[1:49:16] branch that channel that god had
[1:49:18] prepared for himself in this hour oh my
[1:49:22] think of that we're living in the time
[1:49:24] as the prophet would go on to say where
[1:49:26] the entire holy spirit visits the church
[1:49:29] of the living god making god in human
[1:49:31] flesh when we're in a time where the
[1:49:33] word has been gathered up and the truth
[1:49:36] has been laid out before you and i
[1:49:38] vindicated the path of righteousness
[1:49:41] that has been laid out then god
[1:49:43] vindicating his word to bring such a
[1:49:46] certainty within the body of jesus
[1:49:48] christ you see there's a gathering
[1:49:50] that's going on
[1:49:53] it's a gathering that was promised in
[1:49:55] genesis 49 10 the scepter shall not
[1:49:58] depart from judah nor a law-giver from
[1:50:01] between his feet until shiloh come and
[1:50:04] unto him shall the gathering of the
[1:50:06] people be in ephesians 1 10 in the
[1:50:09] dispensation of the fullness of times he
[1:50:12] might gather together in one all things
[1:50:15] in christ so this is the hour of
[1:50:18] preparation
[1:50:20] this is the hour of calling into the
[1:50:23] body of jesus christ by one spirit we
[1:50:26] are baptized into one body
[1:50:29] now look at this here just in closing
[1:50:32] when you take the scriptures in this
[1:50:34] hour
[1:50:35] that appoint
[1:50:36] to this time
[1:50:38] of the lord himself the bible gives
[1:50:41] it gives as we were looking at some
[1:50:43] weeks ago some background conditions
[1:50:46] that were taking place it says as it was
[1:50:48] in the days of noah
[1:50:52] talks about the conditions that was
[1:50:54] going on
[1:50:56] then it says
[1:50:57] as and also as it was in the days of lot
[1:51:02] you see
[1:51:03] those two it would be a compounding
[1:51:06] of things that would take place
[1:51:08] the most vilest of times
[1:51:11] but remember
[1:51:12] when we look at that time of lot
[1:51:15] because i want you to think of this
[1:51:16] redemption is two
[1:51:18] parts it's a coming out of
[1:51:22] and a going into
[1:51:24] see to come out
[1:51:26] is only halfway
[1:51:28] but you must go fully
[1:51:30] in two
[1:51:32] there's two parts to redemption israel
[1:51:34] came out
[1:51:36] they were brought out of egypt but they
[1:51:38] had to go into the promised land
[1:51:41] is that right we to come out of the
[1:51:43] world
[1:51:44] but we're to go into christ
[1:51:48] right
[1:51:49] this is why when the bible would say in
[1:51:52] revelations
[1:51:53] 18
[1:51:54] of that that angel that comes down that
[1:51:57] lightened
[1:51:58] the earth with great power and glory
[1:52:01] that ministry of the third angel there
[1:52:03] in revelation is the ministry of this
[1:52:05] hour the ministry of the son of man that
[1:52:08] identifies that babylon is fallen
[1:52:12] come out of her my people and be not a
[1:52:15] partaker it goes on and on i don't have
[1:52:18] time to read that but there is a coming
[1:52:20] out of and are going into you see let me
[1:52:23] just say it in this way there's many
[1:52:25] that have come out of organizations
[1:52:27] but they've never went fully into christ
[1:52:31] there's many that's come out and learned
[1:52:32] the message but they never went in and
[1:52:34] did what the message said do
[1:52:37] the message is not doctrines the message
[1:52:40] is not teachings
[1:52:42] the message is christ
[1:52:44] then the message is get into christ what
[1:52:49] did the early church what did they call
[1:52:51] for they were introducing the people to
[1:52:54] introduce them to jesus christ to get
[1:52:57] into christ
[1:53:00] now remember paul went up there in the
[1:53:02] book of acts acts chapter 19 and he got
[1:53:05] around some believers listen they were
[1:53:07] believers
[1:53:10] are you hearing me
[1:53:11] but you see because there was a longing
[1:53:14] a call a hunger a desire for more truth
[1:53:19] god seen that knew right where they were
[1:53:22] at and god sent that so they could walk
[1:53:26] in more truth
[1:53:28] they could have said we've got the
[1:53:29] scrolls we've got all of this but you
[1:53:32] see
[1:53:32] god himself sends his servants with a
[1:53:36] message and that message just like with
[1:53:39] philip and the and the eunuch the
[1:53:41] ethiopian eunuch he read the writings of
[1:53:44] isaiah but he couldn't understand them
[1:53:47] and notice philip said do you understand
[1:53:50] what you're reading he said how can i
[1:53:53] except some man teach me
[1:53:55] it was not philip that it delivered
[1:53:58] understanding but philip was filled with
[1:54:02] the seed of life of the holy ghost the
[1:54:05] one who spoke through isaiah and philip
[1:54:08] was able to stand there under
[1:54:10] inspiration and that man who pondered
[1:54:13] who wondered remember he was a eunuch
[1:54:16] and here he came under the word of god
[1:54:20] look at him he said look i don't need to
[1:54:22] wait to get baptized there's some water
[1:54:24] right here what's stopping us
[1:54:28] see when the word was revealed he
[1:54:31] discerned the time
[1:54:36] what it meant for him
[1:54:38] it's not and it's not enough just to
[1:54:40] discern god sent a prophet why did he
[1:54:43] send a prophet
[1:54:45] why did god make this word no why did he
[1:54:47] shake that promise before this
[1:54:50] generation god was not taking up time
[1:54:53] god is not taking up time this morning
[1:54:55] god is announcing his presence and his
[1:54:58] desire that you and i would be fully
[1:55:01] united with him
[1:55:05] hallelujah
[1:55:06] that's god's desire the gathering shall
[1:55:09] be unto him
[1:55:11] and paul went up there
[1:55:14] paul began to hear him
[1:55:15] he heard and heard what they were
[1:55:16] talking about and paul said
[1:55:19] have you received the holy ghost since
[1:55:20] you believed
[1:55:22] notice because you don't get the holy
[1:55:24] ghost when you believe
[1:55:27] since
[1:55:28] you believed
[1:55:29] paul said over ephesians 1 ephesians 4
[1:55:33] in whom
[1:55:34] after
[1:55:36] you believe
[1:55:37] ye also trusted and
[1:55:40] were sealed with the holy spirit of
[1:55:42] promise
[1:55:43] after that you believe because remember
[1:55:45] the coming of the holy ghost is a
[1:55:47] miracle
[1:55:49] the baptism of the holy ghost a new
[1:55:52] birth is a miracle
[1:55:55] is that right that's what jesus look at
[1:55:56] it in john 3 it's a miracle so how can
[1:55:59] the holy ghost come he said the father
[1:56:01] will send the holy ghost in my name
[1:56:05] and the spirit of truth it reveals jesus
[1:56:08] christ it's the testimony of jesus
[1:56:10] christ and he speaks his word and what
[1:56:13] does it do it raises faith in the living
[1:56:16] word of god what is it the spirit of
[1:56:18] truth moving on your life to lead you
[1:56:21] into christ himself
[1:56:25] have you received the holy ghost since
[1:56:29] you have believed
[1:56:31] and what did they say
[1:56:33] we don't know whether there is a holy
[1:56:35] ghost
[1:56:38] but paul said how were you baptized paul
[1:56:41] knew there was limitations
[1:56:44] in the truth that they had
[1:56:46] not that the truth was limited but they
[1:56:48] were limited by the truth they had
[1:56:50] are you hearing me that's why the word
[1:56:53] itself there has to be an opening and an
[1:56:55] unfolding of the word of god in this
[1:56:58] hour
[1:57:00] and he begins to speak to them and let
[1:57:02] them know that not only was jesus here
[1:57:06] the true passover lamb the lamb that was
[1:57:08] offered up but he was there to make an
[1:57:10] announcement he was offered up already
[1:57:13] he's rose from the grave he's ascended
[1:57:16] on high and he sent back the holy ghost
[1:57:19] and i've got it and it's for you
[1:57:24] brother they received the holy ghost and
[1:57:27] a sign showing it when paul said that
[1:57:29] they were to be baptized in the name of
[1:57:31] jesus christ they got up and they were
[1:57:34] baptized in the name of jesus christ
[1:57:38] that's a work of the holy ghost who is
[1:57:41] it it was god gathering his children
[1:57:44] unto himself
[1:57:46] [Applause]
[1:57:50] are coming out and are going into
[1:57:54] he called lot out is that right think of
[1:57:57] these two parts in the scripture he
[1:57:59] calls lot out of sodom
[1:58:01] there's a calling out
[1:58:04] calling out of sodom but there's also a
[1:58:06] place to go into
[1:58:09] calls out of sodom and into
[1:58:11] the safety of the ark
[1:58:15] it's a compound
[1:58:17] compound event a coming out of and are
[1:58:20] going into
[1:58:21] i want you to think of this
[1:58:24] when god spoke in genesis 7 verse 1
[1:58:28] and the lord said to noah
[1:58:31] come thou
[1:58:32] and all thy house
[1:58:35] into the ark
[1:58:37] where i have seen the righteous before
[1:58:39] me
[1:58:40] in this generation
[1:58:44] there wasn't one drop of water
[1:58:46] could fall
[1:58:48] until they got in the ark
[1:58:53] they sat in that ark there and it was on
[1:58:54] the seventh day
[1:58:56] when the first drop started to come
[1:59:00] but the call didn't come from outside
[1:59:04] the call came from inside the ark
[1:59:08] see god speaks to you on the inside
[1:59:12] it's the holy spirit that comes by and
[1:59:14] says it says it like this
[1:59:17] it says the promise of the holy ghost is
[1:59:18] for you
[1:59:20] brother branham takes that it's that
[1:59:21] statement he says you go to start
[1:59:23] feeding on that promise
[1:59:25] he said you start feeding that white dog
[1:59:27] on that promise the holy ghost is for me
[1:59:29] he said you watch what takes place in
[1:59:32] your life
[1:59:34] are you hearing me
[1:59:35] so many times we come in we come to
[1:59:37] church
[1:59:39] and we hear
[1:59:40] and we leave and do nothing
[1:59:45] i mean we're getting quiet now we were
[1:59:47] shouting earlier that's all right
[1:59:52] but it's what we do with the word that
[1:59:54] we're hearing
[1:59:56] it's got to be something that strikes
[1:59:58] our heart now friends
[2:00:00] that's where it has to go to
[2:00:02] it's it true we have it's a green
[2:00:05] you open the channel of your mind and
[2:00:06] let the seed of the word coming down
[2:00:09] there must be an agreeing but it's got
[2:00:12] to be
[2:00:13] coming into our heart
[2:00:16] if there if all we're doing is agreeing
[2:00:18] with it
[2:00:19] it'll show
[2:00:21] there's no stability there's nothing
[2:00:23] that continues on within our life or in
[2:00:26] and out and up and down that's not what
[2:00:28] god's desire is for you god's desire is
[2:00:31] for a real victorious life
[2:00:34] now come on let's just put the devil on
[2:00:35] notice
[2:00:37] that squirmish little feeling or
[2:00:38] whatever more that that ain't god that
[2:00:41] ain't god that's doing that that's his
[2:00:42] presence and the enemy's getting nervous
[2:00:45] the enemy gets nervous in those times
[2:00:48] because he's being uncovered
[2:00:51] but it's a time to really to let our
[2:00:54] life really be united with almighty god
[2:00:58] that no we've come out of the world but
[2:01:00] it's got to be that where it come where
[2:01:02] there's a dying out in our life a real
[2:01:04] surrendering to our life not just
[2:01:06] something we say yes i believe it but
[2:01:09] something that we begin to act upon and
[2:01:11] begin to give our lives to it it's
[2:01:14] something that we want oh brother samuel
[2:01:16] if i could sit down and counsel with you
[2:01:18] you can counsel with me a month of
[2:01:20] sundays it'll never do it until you're
[2:01:22] ready to die
[2:01:26] come on friends you don't need brother
[2:01:28] samuel you need the holy ghost
[2:01:31] it isn't me you need well if i only had
[2:01:34] words from you it in brother samuel that
[2:01:36] can straighten out your life it's jesus
[2:01:38] christ that can do it it's jesus christ
[2:01:42] that can spring you out of the traps
[2:01:44] you're in
[2:01:46] this is why david said teach me teach me
[2:01:50] lord and i walk in it
[2:01:54] i unite my heart to fear thy name
[2:01:58] samuel what are you saying i'm saying
[2:01:59] friends listen
[2:02:01] god isn't god
[2:02:02] god doesn't want us to he's not calling
[2:02:04] us to be or we become like monks or
[2:02:06] something but god is calling us to our
[2:02:09] lives or on fire we're living for his
[2:02:12] coming we're ready for his coming i'm
[2:02:14] telling you right now if you would have
[2:02:16] to say when if the lord were to come
[2:02:18] this minute and you would have to say
[2:02:21] hold up i've let some things creep into
[2:02:23] my life that shouldn't be there then
[2:02:25] right now is a time to take care of that
[2:02:28] it's a time to attend to those things
[2:02:31] it's not a time to put it off and you
[2:02:33] know how people are saying well i'm
[2:02:35] waiting for california to fall in the
[2:02:37] bride won't be here
[2:02:39] sorry the bride won't be here i'm
[2:02:41] waiting on the first bomb the bride
[2:02:42] won't be here
[2:02:44] i'm waiting on this to happen the bride
[2:02:46] won't be here you must discern the time
[2:02:50] it's the presence of jesus christ right
[2:02:53] here among us discerning our hearts
[2:02:56] pouring out his life bringing conviction
[2:02:58] on lives i tell you
[2:03:01] i'll tell you how it concerns me
[2:03:04] because
[2:03:05] when the voice came in from the inside
[2:03:07] of the ark
[2:03:09] it called for noah to enter
[2:03:15] it was a work done
[2:03:17] in silence
[2:03:22] done in silence
[2:03:24] yet it was open
[2:03:26] before everybody
[2:03:30] and when noah got inside the ark
[2:03:33] no one never closed the door
[2:03:37] god closed it
[2:03:40] there's only so long
[2:03:44] of mercy
[2:03:45] while the bride is still here
[2:03:47] there's still mercy on
[2:03:50] there's still blood are you hearing me
[2:03:51] now there's still blood that's here that
[2:03:54] that door of mercy is set right before
[2:03:56] us jesus said i am the door
[2:03:59] are you hearing me you say well i know
[2:04:01] that jesus is the door remember there
[2:04:03] were two preachers that went down to
[2:04:05] sodom and they remember people couldn't
[2:04:07] even find the door
[2:04:10] come on now we've had a billy graham and
[2:04:12] oral roberts
[2:04:14] right oral roberts has carried a message
[2:04:17] to the pentecostals
[2:04:18] right brother graham called it a message
[2:04:20] of mercy
[2:04:21] billy graham carried a message right but
[2:04:24] remember it could not it could not
[2:04:26] reveal the door they staggered to find
[2:04:29] the door
[2:04:31] but you see abraham out here abraham
[2:04:34] wasn't even in sodom abraham was outside
[2:04:38] of sodom and outside of sodom he
[2:04:40] received the one that had spoke to him
[2:04:44] visited him in lights visited him in
[2:04:46] dreams visited him in visions he now
[2:04:49] received that visitation before his tent
[2:04:53] door
[2:05:00] and the door was revealed
[2:05:03] the way
[2:05:04] was opened you say what what are you
[2:05:06] saying preacher i'm saying or the way is
[2:05:09] open that door you you'd be like this i
[2:05:12] could say it like this if somebody if
[2:05:14] you you were blind
[2:05:16] let's say you were you were blind and
[2:05:18] you were
[2:05:19] you know somewhere else back there in
[2:05:21] the in in the building
[2:05:23] and here we have let's say we have the
[2:05:24] cross right up here because that that's
[2:05:26] what you're trying to get people to is
[2:05:28] back to the real reality of calvary is
[2:05:31] that right
[2:05:32] come on that's what this message reveals
[2:05:34] is the real reality of calvary and the
[2:05:36] resurrection power of jesus christ but
[2:05:39] imagine a person that was blind
[2:05:42] you and i hey we were blind
[2:05:45] the bible said that that would thou
[2:05:47] would have had thine eyes anointed with
[2:05:50] isaf
[2:05:52] brother joy let's say you were back
[2:05:54] there
[2:05:55] and i said brother joy make your way
[2:05:58] to the cross
[2:06:02] you could stumble all the way through
[2:06:03] here see i know the cross is up there
[2:06:05] somewhere
[2:06:07] you're stumbling
[2:06:08] but if i come back there
[2:06:10] and i get you by the hand
[2:06:13] and i say come with me
[2:06:16] we're going to the cross
[2:06:18] you've got a set of eyes that's able to
[2:06:21] lead you
[2:06:22] to reality
[2:06:24] come on now a prophet is a seer it's a
[2:06:27] set of eyes it lets light into the body
[2:06:31] so that we might find our way back home
[2:06:34] back to calvary that's what this message
[2:06:36] did it led us back to a real
[2:06:39] relationship with jesus christ we
[2:06:42] couldn't have found our way
[2:06:44] but god rich in mercy he came down in
[2:06:49] darkness
[2:06:50] he lighted the way and led us back home
[2:06:55] led us to a real experience led us to a
[2:06:58] place that we can be certain of god
[2:07:03] a place
[2:07:04] in christ
[2:07:07] hallelujah
[2:07:12] think about this
[2:07:14] think about it
[2:07:17] those animals
[2:07:19] come into the ark
[2:07:22] think about it
[2:07:30] monkey looked over at mama
[2:07:35] camel took camel
[2:07:37] notice
[2:07:39] they came paired
[2:07:41] male and female
[2:07:44] that speaks of the uniting in this hour
[2:07:49] they received a call
[2:07:51] to come in
[2:07:55] but the conditions of time
[2:07:59] people ate
[2:08:01] drank
[2:08:02] were so busy
[2:08:05] and they might have had legitimate
[2:08:06] excuses so
[2:08:08] i've got a family to raise
[2:08:11] i've got this i've got that
[2:08:13] they were so
[2:08:15] busy
[2:08:16] the bible says until they didn't
[2:08:19] even
[2:08:21] know it
[2:08:22] until the fight came
[2:08:28] listen friends there's witnesses here
[2:08:30] and i'm a witness to i am a personal
[2:08:32] witness of this
[2:08:35] you put god first in everything
[2:08:38] and everything
[2:08:40] god will see you through
[2:08:47] but if you put anything ahead of god
[2:08:50] it'll never come out right
[2:08:53] it's got to be god first
[2:08:56] you put his word first
[2:08:59] it's not about whether you feel like it
[2:09:00] or you put his word first
[2:09:02] if he said be baptized in the name of
[2:09:05] jesus christ for the remission of your
[2:09:07] sins repent
[2:09:08] and you shall receive the holy ghost
[2:09:10] don't let anything
[2:09:12] stand in your way
[2:09:14] put it first
[2:09:16] if there's things that's crept into your
[2:09:19] life
[2:09:20] this is god's grace to say you know what
[2:09:22] let's get it right back in order where
[2:09:24] it needs to be
[2:09:26] are you hearing me
[2:09:28] because we're living right here
[2:09:30] in the coming of the lord

[2:10:10] word we've got a promise that they shall
[2:10:13] appear to us

[2:15:10] when we can just take a glimpse and see
[2:15:12] that lord
[2:15:13] like it was the lord in the days of noah
[2:15:16] to know that god that that was prophecy
[2:15:20] for the hour and the time that we're
[2:15:21] living that there would be a place of
[2:15:24] safety that we can come into lord
[2:15:27] father that the pathway
[2:15:30] into the blood of jesus christ would be
[2:15:32] revealed
[2:15:33] the pathway oh god lord where it speaks
[2:15:37] that it would be a day lord that's not
[2:15:39] day or night
[2:15:40] but in the evening time there would be
[2:15:42] light
[2:15:43] lord to show us
[2:15:45] like the example of that man who was
[2:15:47] blind
[2:15:48] but would be led
[2:15:51] be led
[2:15:53] to calvary be led to the true atonement
[2:15:56] be led
[2:15:58] to the true relationship
[2:16:00] oh god we know that if it wasn't for
[2:16:02] your mercy

[2:16:22] so personally
[2:16:23] how you would speak
[2:16:25] to our hearts
[2:16:27] you would take lord lives by the hand
[2:16:30] that lord god that
[2:16:32] could be in need maybe it's in darkness
[2:16:36] needs to come to light it needs to come
[2:16:38] to victory

[2:16:47] let your need and lord
[2:16:49] lead them into a place

[2:17:23] so lord the question isn't
[2:17:25] if you care we we know you do we see
[2:17:28] that
[2:17:30] but now
[2:17:31] the question comes do we care
[2:17:35] do we care
[2:17:37] do we care lord enough to
[2:17:40] as these examples you gave us in the
[2:17:41] scripture
[2:17:43] where a life was willing just to
[2:17:46] submit their lives
[2:17:47] to come under like the bride coming
[2:17:50] under
[2:17:51] the headship of the word
[2:17:54] lord god what it is that you're speaking
[2:17:56] to our hearts personally and dealing
[2:17:58] with our lives
[2:18:00] lord god
[2:18:03] i pray right here this morning
[2:18:05] [Music]
[2:18:07] lord if there's one
[2:18:09] that doesn't know you in that way
[2:18:14] lord i'm certain this morning
[2:18:18] that god you're here
[2:18:21] to move
[2:18:23] to minister to that need
[2:18:27] may you lord god i pray lord just
[2:18:31] just encourage him lord
[2:18:33] strengthen the lord may they move and
[2:18:34] act upon that word
[2:18:36] if they're here lord and they're not
[2:18:38] ready to go
[2:18:40] may lord i pray not only lord that they
[2:18:42] [Music]
[2:18:44] would believe but may they act upon the
[2:18:46] word
[2:18:50] because lord truly this rapture that's
[2:18:51] upon us
[2:18:53] it's going to be one of the greatest
[2:18:55] miracles to take place
[2:18:56] [Music]
[2:19:00] lord jesus
[2:19:00] [Music]
[2:19:03] i'm reminded how your prophet would tell
[2:19:04] us
[2:19:07] there are many miracles lord
[2:19:10] healing of the body
[2:19:13] many many different miracles
[2:19:14] deliverances opening of the red sea lord
[2:19:16] there's many things that
[2:19:18] we don't have to just
[2:19:20] speak about
[2:19:21] in terms
[2:19:23] of looking back through
[2:19:25] the bible but we see the same god of the
[2:19:27] bible
[2:19:28] right in our midst
[2:19:30] where miracles
[2:19:32] have and are taking place
[2:19:36] lord
[2:19:37] the greatest miracle
[2:19:41] is when that life can be so surrendered
[2:19:43] to you
[2:19:45] to where they're willing to let down all
[2:19:47] of their will
[2:19:49] they're willing to die out to their
[2:19:51] selves
[2:19:53] lord
[2:19:54] like it said in isaiah that we read
[2:19:56] today
[2:19:57] that lord they come to a place
[2:20:00] that they're not anymore telling you of
[2:20:03] what they will do and what they want you
[2:20:05] to do
[2:20:06] but to where they come to a place
[2:20:09] to surrender
[2:20:10] for what you are asking of them
[2:20:15] lord god when they begin to act upon
[2:20:17] that word believe it and act upon it
[2:20:21] then lord god there is
[2:20:24] a supernatural working of the power of
[2:20:26] the holy ghost
[2:20:28] that'll move down in that life oh god
[2:20:31] it'll bring a transformation
[2:20:34] that'll change them
[2:20:36] from death unto life
[2:20:39] it'll be a passing
[2:20:40] from death unto life it will no longer
[2:20:43] be
[2:20:44] the same man
[2:20:46] but it will be a new man
[2:20:48] on the inside
[2:20:49] a new creation
[2:20:51] and that
[2:20:52] is the greatest miracle
[2:20:56] lord i ask right here this morning
[2:21:00] that god
[2:21:02] may you come for each of these needs
[2:21:05] there's needs lord
[2:21:07] of deliverance
[2:21:10] i'm asking lord that you'll come
[2:21:13] because lord
[2:21:15] these people they did not come to hear a
[2:21:17] sermon today
[2:21:20] they didn't come to hear that lord
[2:21:22] they come to hear from you
[2:21:25] [Music]
[2:21:26] lord god even of needs that they've had
[2:21:28] on their heart that maybe when the text
[2:21:29] was read they could look at it and say
[2:21:32] well it don't seem like maybe the way
[2:21:33] the text is going but i know that god's
[2:21:35] in control
[2:21:37] god knows my need god's able to take a
[2:21:40] hold of that gift and that life because
[2:21:41] after all that gift was placed here for
[2:21:44] me
[2:21:45] and god will step down and use that gift
[2:21:47] to speak to my life speak to my need i
[2:21:50] don't know how it's going to happen but
[2:21:51] i believe that it's going to happen lord
[2:21:53] god
[2:21:54] now lord
[2:21:56] as your children lord you've ministered
[2:21:58] to our lives
[2:22:00] now lord god
[2:22:02] we lord jesus not only want to believe
[2:22:04] it
[2:22:05] we want to act upon the word lord god
[2:22:09] we want to act upon that word father

[2:22:53] let's surrender it all
[2:22:56] i've just been pondering meditating upon
[2:22:59] that for weeks
[2:23:01] brother branham would say that like a
[2:23:02] little girl where he says you know
[2:23:04] little girl
[2:23:05] a little lady getting ready to be
[2:23:06] married
[2:23:08] and he said she's coming into that place
[2:23:09] of uniting
[2:23:11] he said she just surrenders everything
[2:23:14] she just so in love with him
[2:23:18] it don't matter he no matter what it
[2:23:20] would be
[2:23:21] that he would ask or he would require
[2:23:24] she's willing because
[2:23:26] she loves
[2:23:28] him
[2:23:28] [Music]
[2:23:29] she wants to be
[2:23:31] united
[2:23:33] with him
[2:23:34] it's a love affair it's not a law
[2:23:37] it's a love affair that's taking place
[2:23:41] you see it's like a
[2:23:42] it's a great migration
[2:23:45] see the spirit of god moving and dealing
[2:23:47] with our lives to
[2:23:49] bring us
[2:23:49] [Music]
[2:23:51] from where we are
[2:23:52] to where we need to be
[2:23:56] oh my
[2:23:57] let's just let him move here
[2:23:59] [Music]
[2:24:01] let's let him continue to move
[2:24:04] amen
[2:24:06] if you need prayer this morning
[2:24:08] we're here to pray with you
[2:24:12] if you want the holy ghost
[2:24:15] he's here this morning glory be to god
[2:24:18] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:24:21] glory be to god
[2:24:23] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:24:26] if you need strength
[2:24:28] he's here this morning as the strength
[2:24:30] given
[2:24:31] if you need a touch in your body he's
[2:24:33] here this morning
[2:24:35] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[2:24:38] oh hallelujah
[2:24:40] let's just let god have his way
[2:24:43] let's let god have his way
[2:24:45] hallelujah
[2:24:48] i wonder what the rest of the camels and
[2:24:50] the rest of the monkeys and the rest of
[2:24:51] the lines wonder what they could say as
[2:24:54] some of these lions were walking past
[2:24:59] i wonder where they're going
[2:25:02] but you know it was happened in such a
[2:25:04] silence
[2:25:05] a secret work
[2:25:09] it was something that had been already
[2:25:10] taken place
[2:25:13] they didn't even notice it
[2:25:17] same way with the people who was in the
[2:25:18] world it was
[2:25:20] it was taking place
[2:25:22] and they didn't even realize it
[2:25:25] brother branham stands in the message of
[2:25:26] desperation he says
[2:25:28] friends we need to be careful
[2:25:30] he said because
[2:25:33] the god who is passing among us
[2:25:36] if we're not careful he'll pass right
[2:25:39] through us
[2:25:41] and pass right by
[2:25:43] but i want to say pass me not or gentle
[2:25:45] save me
[2:25:47] pass me not o gentle savior
[2:25:49] hear my humble cry lord while on others
[2:25:53] thou art calling but oh jesus don't pass
[2:25:56] me by

[2:26:02] opportunity right here this morning
