able to come together here this evening amen and in his presence and we're just so grateful for his grace aren't we amen where would we be without him amen I'm grateful amen and no matter where we're you know tonight we come to the house of God we have come with an expectation how many times you've seen it that you know I I just there's been some times where there's been well I don't want to just say sometimes is a few times but there's been times where you just come here and sometimes it isn't even when I'm ministering and I it just seems like everything else around you is going on and I just say I just want to get to the house of God I know God's got something tonight or something here this morning you know and it comes on a Sunday and you know that's been the truth because he comes we have an expectation and he he ministers to us the same way that he saved our soul he comes down and he once again and that's what Paul's speaking of in the Book of Romans chapter 8 there's an expectation that we hold we have we have a hope in him and I'm glad about that aren't you amen I don't know how I if you ask me to explain how he does it I don't know but I just know he doesn't and that's what I'm grateful for amen and so we just thank the Lord for that before we go into um prayer tonight and open the word of the Lord I I want to remind or make mention to you um this uh this coming weekend Lord willing brother Alexander magulus will be standing in here for me on Sunday we have um the banquet there on Saturday evening there in uh for uh for Bluffton for the I think it's going to be in Finley is that right so I have that on that Saturday evening to speak to the young people in that banquet and then on Sunday morning uh there for the congregation so we just um this has been planned for some time and so we just asked that you'd be in prayer for that as well as also for brother Alexander that God will just in in every place God will just just use use his children and God certainly knows what we have need of and I want to also make mention to you I I forgot last week um uh and um but brother Randy is he's over in India right now and he left last Wednesday and he and I I told him I said let me know in advance before you go and he texts me the night before he left because I just wanted to even be in prayer and whatever we could do you know and and so uh he's there in India and it's going um really well and so we just he's there till the end of the month and so we just want to keep him in prayer so just that the Lord will just use brother Randy there brother Jeff Snodgrass as well asked you to keep him in prayer yesterday he just went uh to Africa and I think for a good part of the time in Malawi so brother Jeff's going to be gone there for a few weeks so I just uh just appreciate amen those Brothers going and I certainly I certainly rely on that quote if you can't go send somebody so we just I just appreciate that burden and I just appreciate the diversity in the body of Jesus Christ and it's needed and you know and so God knows exactly what what he's doing and so just to keep that in prayer so as we turn to the prepare to turn our hearts to look into the word of the Lord and tonight and um maybe we can just go to the Lord in prayer and just ask him just to just pass fire away in a special way you know I've studied and gone through and what God's placed on my heart but he knows he knows what needs to be said and he knows how to say it and and guide and that's that's every time I stand here I'm just reserved to him if he however he wants to take it and break it we want him to do that so we just invite him let's let's just talk to our father now Heavenly Father Lord as we just are so thankful for the privilege that you've given us this evening that we can come and Lord assemble ourselves together Lord around this revealed word of the hour Lord to come Lord and to look to you father Lord you know every circumstance you know every part of our life you know every need Lord and Lord we just invite you because without you father this service would be no more than just a gathering of people but you're the one who makes the difference Lord and there's a desire in our Heart Lord that you would come and speak to us you said in your word if you'll draw nigh unto me I'll draw nigh unto you that Lord this is our heart's desire that God that you would come and speak to us tonight Lord father minister to our hearts come and break the bread of life there's no one can do that like you can Lord God do it becomes personal to weaken every one of us Lord seeing ourselves in the word saying Lord our shortcomings seeing where Lord that the grace of God has come to Lord to pick us up to Lift Us Lord into certain places Lord You're just that personal and we ask that you would be that personal tonight to us Lord we love you and we thank you Lord we want to remember brother Randy Lord and brother Jeff's not grass and pray that God you'll just continue to keep your hand upon our brothers Lord just Lord you sing them Lord the burden you've placed on their Heart Lord just hearing already Lord how with Lord Brother Randy being there and just Lord the Comfort it's been Lord to Lord that brother Lord and the losing of a loved one and I pray that God that you'll just Lord use our brothers Lord in a special way I know there's more that's on the field and out there and overseas and we pray for everyone Lord Lord we just ask that you would just have your way father we commit the service the remaining of it in your hands in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen let's go to job 22 and I just um just more coming from this part of it and actually more what it is somewhere not to look more at this thought a little more here this evening on a useful life and I always think it's really tremendous on things of how that God always has something and how that there's things that when God just takes a hold of it I mean the Lord can bring multiple Parts out of it he can just bring one part and you go on and it just it's really it's what's up what God sees that we and I have need of and I was talking to my wife here the other day and I said you know for me back in November I said I'm sitting in a hotel room in Canada preparing to minister meetings and I'm just going through this on the Book of Job and I said I'm just thought I was going to be transported to job 42 you know from a certain part of it but God knows what we have need of and I just I just to me I I appreciate all the little stops that he makes we may not go chapter by chapter I don't know whatever he has in store because we've already seen that where I already had just a little blurb to refer to and then he said look at this and I oh okay and so we just we just are so thankful for that and I want to say I appreciate Silas here he's I he's been used been bringing his violin and he plays the violin and so we're trying to get him used to that right there and so uh he may not be playing real loud but I appreciate him just yielding his talents to the Lord and uh I teased his father one time real good you know brother Brian got into he said he's going to get into playing the violin he said here brother Simon let me play the song Amazing Grace for you and it's just my brother-in-law you know it's just us just teasing one another and I said yes that's true but isn't it supposed to be How Sweet the Sound [Laughter] amen but uh I just I tell you I encourage I encourage uh what what a you know any Talent we have let's just use it for the kingdom of God amen I believe that's I believe that's the thought of even what we're looking at tonight in coming Services you know job 22 verse 1 then he life as the team and I'd answered and said can a man be profitable unto God as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself and may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I want to keep you standing but as we look here at this thought of being profitable unto God and we've looked at this for a few Services now and and looking out that how that job was a very he was a useful man and this is exactly what God intense for every one of us to be and he desires that that we would be useful if you think clear back to when God placed man in the beginning before he ever put him in a flesh body but God gave direction to that to that Spirit man to multiply replenish to have dominion and to exercise of that dominion and that Dominion was not a Dominion that would be ruled out of fear or a Dominion that would be to inflict fear but that Dominion would simply be under the anointing of God's holy image leading and directing all of the other forms of life and then God put that man into a flesh body breathe the breath of life into him and he gave and he spoke to Adam and he gave him to multiply or to uh till the soil to contact the Earth and so it was an objective that God had is that that man and then we know even when God opened up the side of Adam and he brought forth Eve it never ceased to be useful Because the actual word woman means the womb of man so it was God's intended desire is that how that Adam himself how there would be a reproducing of this image it would come through and by that of the woman it would be by the spoken word and we know that that is what was that was uh the fall came not because of the word but it came because man got away from the word and I just stopped us as this is he brings it to me now if the word itself can bring creation and that's what really has taken place when we've been born again because remember when Jesus gathered the disciples at the end of The Book of John he breathed upon them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost showing that man himself that real sons and daughters of God would be born of the spirit of God by the breath of almighty God and remember the Breath of God is the inspiration of God it sets a Man on Fire it puts a man into service and so to think of how that when we look at being of a useful life we come back to this simple thought that it's a life that is really surrendered and consecrated to God I I want to be more surrendered I want to be more consecrated brother Samuel are you there yet well I look at where Paul himself would write I'm always challenged by it when Paul would speak of how that he would bring his body into subjection when Paul would also write that Brethren I count myself not as perfect but I'm striving after that Perfection then I look at that and I see that Paul Paul seen something that was really moving upon his life and remember he said I seek to apprehend lay hold of what's laid hold on me so when God has stirred up our heart God does that so that you and I might have a direction to yield ourselves elves too otherwise we're just wandering around and aimlessly and Lord what what do you want me to do and what would you have me to do but you know God has a way of the word speaking to our hearts and we can look in our lives and say Lord I need that area built up I need that and and here we are agreeing with the word and what does that do it allows that which is laying hold upon our life and US reaching back out to him and saying Lord be it unto me Lord and so we don't as as people of God we don't count ourselves to be perfect as far as my experience and your experience if we've been born again of the spirit of God then it's a fulfillment of the scripture be you therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect it's also the same fulfillment where John would write by inspiration of the love of God and says that as he is there so are we here we are a reflection of a triumphant Mighty God who came down and became one of us and that same life is being reflected here on Earth for you and I we are his victory so job was job was useful and I've read this quote and I just I want I'm going to read it again to start out with here tonight that out of the message then Jesus came and called and brother Brown said job node he had been he had been this he had influenced people and I I think that's a powerful thing because whether we whether we like it or not or whether we choose you know sometimes a person could say well I don't want nobody looking at me that's tough we don't get to choose who looks at us and who doesn't we don't even get to choose the times they look at us and The Times They don't we don't get to say hey blank screen right here you know like if if there's something I want to talk to you as a church and I tell them back there hey put up put out this signal on over the Internet because I got to speak personally here they can do that and nobody gets that out there but that's not something you and I have a choice of oh but I'm grateful for the grace of God that if we the spirit of God can direct our hearts and say wait a minute here forgive me because the wrong influence was projected why because we're under his influence and if we're under his influence it's a desire in our life to remain as a channel so he knowed he had influenced people his life had been useful God never give us our lives just to hang around this that he give it to be useful for him to do something to tell somebody else you can't talk whistle him or something see brother Brandon is opening this up that there is something every one of us have a part in the economy of God you might look or I might look and say well but what part do I have but don't measure your part according to somebody else's part your part and my part is just as essential in the economy of God and we can just recognizing that no one of us we're not we're not complete without Christ in one another so notice give some impression somewhere an impression we want is that impression of Christ and job was the type of man that was useful now I want to come into this definition here once again because it perhaps we'll pick it up here and to be useful is to be used for a practical purpose or in several ways so we don't get to choose the way that we're going to be used but there's one thing that's a common denominator in every child of God that God will be the one doing it and God will be the one getting the glory the ways that he chooses to use or I don't get to choose that we we might say well Lord I'll do this but see once again that's us putting ourselves into it and he can't use us but he can only use this when we're surrendered and see the value of being in his will not looking at something else and say oh if I could just do this remember brother Branham standing outside and we've preached on that stood outside of oral Robert's place and uh and and until Osborne's place and what did he say Lord I guess you really couldn't use me he looked at their buildings that they had marble structures and here he had a little trailer something that would be you know you would look at and say must not be too much to that Ministry I want you to think of this right here it just goes to show God's Not About Numbers God's not about buildings God's about hearts that are surrendered you could take 500 people but it ain't numbers it's life surrendered to God that's why brother Graham said you can take just one person it gets on fire for God and it'll send a Revival through that whole church yeah oh God let it be me let it be me because remember all the way through the scriptures God showed over and over again I don't need numbers I just need hearts that are surrendered because when a heart gets surrendered I mean we can go through countless examples shamgar get in Jonathan when they went up there to pursue the Philistines God said I don't need numbers I just need hearts that surrender praise God if it's 500 praise God if it's 300 but it's got to be surrendered Hearts to him practical purposes and so when we ask the question how do I become useful it's the same way job did job could have never been useful without the revelation of almighty God coming into his heart and being reflected in the sacrifice that was offered up is that right that's why brother Rams says in the Harvest Time when he saw Abel coming to offer the offering he saw the word reflected in Abel but he didn't see the word reflected and came is that right so the author of the offering it already speaks of what's been offered up here you understand what I'm saying the offering that was made before Calvary when we look at Calvary and say that's the all-sufficient sacrifice and indeed it is but remember before Calvary there was a Gethsemane Calvary was only the manifestation of Gethsemane is that right think about when the prophet would preach the message breach he'll take us back to Gethsemane and he's talking about a battle and a wrestling and out and he's tying it into Revelations 5. why because in order for Christ to become preeminent in the life of the believer it takes a wrestling of it out and getting our will out of the way because that his will might be performed and let me just say this we've covered it in a few Services I think on Sunday but when we speak of the will of God we are not just we are we are not speaking about a job we are not speaking about a house we are not speaking about a church the will of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the life of the believer and then through that will of God that's the perfect will of God and then from the perfect will of God we seek his will so that's a perfect will of God so how do I become useful same way job did and that's why that when Jesus spoke to Nicodemus he said you must be born again because without the life of the sacrifice working in US it only becomes our efforts and we've all been there even after you have been born again there's times we can thrust ourselves forward and listen this is all part of God maturing Even in our own life because sometimes seeing the need we can force ourselves out there and remember it doesn't remove you and I from being a Christian or believer but what it does if we can really look and look at the situation and say Lord teach me to wait is that right because we grow and we mature as we go on so we it's we know that God has a provided way and we think about in the book of Zechariah where when Zechariah is looking at the candlesticks and he's he's presented with a question what is this and Zechariah says you tell me what it is I don't know what it is and so he's looking at this Candlestick and God's wanting to say something to him now Zachariah is not uh uh ignorant of the candlesticks and the operation thereof he's not ignorant of it he's an Israelite he's a Jew so it's not like oh what am I seeing no he knows what he's saying he can say but that's the Candelabra and this and it's in the Holy place and but notice he's aware that the Holy Spirit has come and it's Awakening him as a man that was sleeping and says what do you see and hear one of the greatest things that Zechariah could do that even you and I could do is when God is speaking to our hearts instead of us saying I know that quote I know that scripture but we can just step back here tonight and say God what are you saying to me Lord because there's a lot of things if you listen to the message you're reading in the scriptures I'm not preaching to ignorant people I'm preaching to people that are feeding on the body word of the son of man I'm not preaching to people that are ignorant of things I'm preaching where you have read and you're in and getting in the word I Trust You Are we couldn't have the Liberty that we have we're here Among Us without the Holy Spirit moving in that way but oh how we want to stand like Zechariah and say what are you saying to me Lord because you see it isn't about like brother Branham lays it out and I don't have this quote up there but I want to just refer to certain places in it where brother bam says it's not to be better that's a natural knee-jerk reaction to a person that God when he deals with their life is they try to better themselves but that's not what it's about join a church quit their meanness and do all they can do but still not have eternal life right because it's within within that first nature to want to do something right so this is why brother bam said you can join a church you can belong to a denomination you can live just as straight as a die as a die you know like a form or a pattern the Pharisees did that but Jesus turned to them and said you're of your father the devil and he said we're trying to put it on works all the time something we can do something we can build God don't need our buildings and I believe it's more than more than talking about brick and mortar and and framing up a wood he don't need our buildings he doesn't need our contrivance he doesn't need that God needs our soul that's what Calvary made a way for because you see all creation was lost I want you to think of this as all creation was lost and we've read that in in John 3 16 and all the way through the scriptures as we see there was a a creation that was in a fallen condition and he would take nothing less than God coming down and taking our place he could not it could not be anything separate it had to be God now think of it like this brother random would put it how that God does nothing outside of man now think of that you've you've heard that statement when the prophet makes it and he'll say he could have had the son preach the gospel he could have had the moon he could have had all of that but God chose man and think of it when he says there is nothing that God does outside a man he always works through a man because he had to use a man and a man is what he had to use to display his attribute of Savior the attribute of Savior that was in God could only be displayed through a man God looked all over and think of it God as we said in the beginning he had made man in his own image in his own likeness and then God takes that image that Spirit image that Spirit man and he places him inside of a flesh body so that he's able to contact his Earthly home able to till the soil and so forth but that fleshly body was never given to him as a means to try to figure out God or as a means as though uh to try to understand him or to in a way to serve him but it was meant from that image on the inside that would serve the purpose of God and bring this outer man in subjection to that purpose now think about it Adam and Eve they had no battle like you and I have before the fall they haven't they had no battle like that at all they did not know fear did not know anxiety had no depression no sickness they knew none of those things at all and you and I can look at it in a manner and say my I wonder how that would be well think about it when you've been born again of the spirit of God there's nothing can come into that Soul there might be doubts in everything else fears can arise but think about the power of God that's in your life that's able to dispel fear that's able to put out doubt it's a place that you can look at and you can stand on Solid Ground and where no devil can put his money feed on you know you have met God you know you have met him face to face I tell you that's a place right now that speaks of that how it wasn't Eden because there once that Soul has been healed by the baptism of the Holy Ghost it can no more die than God can die it can never get sick again it'll never be sick of sin and again or sin sake it has been redeemed oh I say Glory Be The God in the highest so God turned right back around because of the choice that was made in the fall and God turns back around and he uses man as a partner remember walking down to the Jordan that day and when the heavens were opened here came the Holy Spirit descending Out of Heaven in the form of a dove is that right so this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell right it's almighty God coming down to what his Temple his Tabernacle to that body that he prepared for himself Mary didn't prepare that no man prepared that God prepared that a body hast thou prepared for me it was a Dwelling Place God pitched that tent God set that Tabernacle and that Tabernacle was to display the attribute of Savior it was to experience everything that you and I would go through to minister to the sick to minister to all of these things and to shed that blood which was not that blood that was already here and polluted it was a blood that was God's own blood and when that blood was shed there was a voice that could ring out of there the life that was in that blood begin to speak better things tame voice you're speaking tonight there's a better way than the life you're walking there's a better way than your thoughts there's a better way what is it that life that was there in the blood cell has been released and to announce to you and I you're free if you will only accept it glory be to God in the highest so God turns back around and he makes man a partner with him and he does nothing except he does it through a man is that right he said I am the Vine right you're the branches God does it through his children well how does God work through his branches well he was the first branch Jehovah's Branch my righteous Branch my servant branch is that right so he here he was coming to be an example of what God himself would now do through the rest of the body the rest of the branches so that whole work of redemption because death came by one man life came by another is that right that's Romans 5. death entered by one life entered by another one and that's why brother Bram says he does nothing besides he had to use a man for that and he'll use a man to redeem it back again now think about Mary when Mary stood there she is 18 years old she could look remember there's things moving on her heart about the promise fellowshipping with Joseph you know how brother Brown dramatizes that and here she has a meeting amen with an Angel and the angel begins to speak and rehearse that message to her she looks at herself she said how can this be I don't know a man but God lets her know the Holy Ghost shall overshadow thee you see the word when it came to Mary was not a word a question or a doubt Ma I wish I could preach right now it wasn't a word of question or doubt it was a word of divine Assurance because God it was in his mind he spoke it through the prophet Isaiah and the same God that spoke into Isaiah was there ministering through that Angel's Ministry personally to Mary if you can receive it and you understand what I'm saying there was an anointing upon Mary it was an anointing to come and to empower that life to yield and to believe beyond what her mind could even fathom you're talking about the supernatural glory be to God and she said be it unto me according to Thy Word now brother Branham and God's gifts always finds its place he says it like this God works through human beings to redeem human beings he can take you work through you to redeem Humanity he said Brother Sam I need Scripture for that well God was in Christ Reckoning siling the world unto himself and now that that that he has been as the atonement has now been offered up and he ascended there to Glory he sent back the life of the atonement which is the Holy Ghost and that same life of the atonement is in the body of Believers and what is it it's the word of reconciliation it's a word that reaches out and speaks to the life and to the heart to do what for one purpose not to unite you with the church but to unite you with Jesus Christ [Applause] he can take you work through you to redeem Humanity if you're completely dedicate everything you are I love this if you're a young woman dedicate your morals you're a young man dedicate your morals dedicate your mind dedicate your thinking dedicate your heart dedicate your soul over the same I will someday why wait someday come on now if you intend on serving God set it down right now I'm going to dedicate my thinking to God and if you dedicated to God then you've got to throw down every other negative thought and every condemning thought and everything that raises its tongue against the word of God you say what do you mean when a tongue says you're not blind you throw that down because it never came from God when it says the Holy Ghost ain't for you throw it down because it never came from God you can't entertain those thoughts and go on you've got to dedicate your thinking to the right things you're going to serve God I'm gonna give my all to God dedicate all you are and let Christ work through that now think of this how that Paul would write in Romans 6 11 likewise reckon you also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ Our Lord and let not sin rain in your mortal body well brother Samuel I I'm not gonna I don't I don't have no desire to commit any sin but don't let any rain you know what rain means dwell on it think on it Ponder on it bring it subject to the word Don't Let It Rain because if it rains it'll start permeating the thoughts and when the fit gets into the thoughts it'll start permeating the actions right it's like brother Brown tells us he said you imagine he said somebody just walks by you and he says you imagine that they got something against you because they didn't shake your hand and he said the thing of it is they may not have saw you right but he said if you don't watch you'll be the one shunning that person are you going to preach with me or not why is that that's because of that imagination and allowing a thought to reign yeah no place here I'm sorry when God got a hold of my life I am not a trash can I'm not a junkyard I am not a recycling bin I am called and anointed and ordained to be a vessel of the Holy Ghost and if there isn't nothing that's profitable if there isn't anything that's good sorry put it in the trash pile I don't want it is that all right that you should obey it in the lust thereof because it comes into mind first verse 13. neither yield ye your memory I want you to watch how Paul writes this here neither yield ye your members as instruments of our unrighteousness unto sin right it's kind of like it's kind of like this phone I got going right here okay that phone itself it will never look at the wrong things that depends on who's controlling it are you hearing me now that's why now I mean I'm all for it if a person says well I got this okay get rid of that but mainly you got to get it out of here because if you don't get it out of here it'll it'll pop up anywhere are you hearing me now so and we're talking about being useful instruments because it's just like these glasses these glasses don't pick up on their own a screwdriver doesn't pick up on its own a hammer don't pick up on its own but Paul is pointing it out right here that we should not yield our members as instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin but notice what he says here's the victory yield yourselves unto God well I thought he just wrote about not yielding my members he's going to get to that but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead you are not the same person that you used to be amen it is a new creation it is a new man on the inside of an old tattered garment it is a new man by the new creation of the Holy Spirit coming down and quickening that seed and raising it up to eternal life but you must yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead I'm not who I used to be right and notice how he puts this and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God so it's from here you live from who you really are and when you're living from here of who you really are then these members will be given in the right way you understand sometimes we want to give you want to give members I want to do this and I want to do that no that's not the order the order is first yield ourselves to God and then let God do with the members what he wants to do because anything less than a full surrender of our own will becomes an offering like Cain and how many know that Cain's offering was Will worship it was his will being offered up not God's will Abel offered up God's will but Cain it was like Paul writes in Colossians it is will worship it is willing to God what they will for him to accept I will God that you accept this I will that you accept my life I will that you accept me just like this because I've done this and I've done that and one big problem with that is still your will is that right so the only way it can happen is it's going to be a surrendering of our will to his will and let him work through us that's only can come through him by the new birth to where we actually become Tools in his hand and you know a tool itself I mean when you look at something that's become completely a tool it's like the microphone there the microphone here or you know this this microphone that's right here it's a tool but it can't do anything on its own the microphone don't stand up and say hey you know what sit down tonight I got this service covered I'm going to speak tonight no it's a tool and you know what it yields or it is in the hand of one that if I look down and said you know what I need to use this microphone tonight instead of this one well what would I do I would reach down with my hand and this microphone it will not fight me it won't say no no no you don't want to use me you don't want to use me I'm no good you can't you speak no it has no will of its own it is totally in such a place of neutrality to where back when there is my will acting upon it it now becomes the reflection of my will and that's the same way it is in our lives our lives are to be lived in such a place of neutrality brother Samuel is that possible absolutely the more the closer that we can live to God the more neutral that we can be in everything around us that he can place his hands upon us remember David wanted to be useful David you know and it was inspiration dropping on he wanted to build a house for God to come and dwell in and David Saul hey the art needs to be brought home because in the days of Saul if you know what it didn't matter in the days of Saul they used the ark like a Ouija board they used it in a manner to say you know what we're in a real hot press here in the battle hey let's let's go call let's call down to the church and let's see if everybody let's have everybody praying for us we've got a real bad situation going on they only wanted to use God when it was convenient to serve their purpose see that was the that was a difference in administration because you know what Saul was Saul was a reflection of the will of the people he could only reflect the will of the people is that right but when it came time that David here has been anointed David's come back on the throne David said we I want the art back in Jerusalem I want the word back in its rightful place I am not content dwelling in the house where I am and God doesn't even have a house to dwell in what was it it was a burden that God was putting upon David now think of it David himself never lived to see that Tabernacle be dedicated or for it to even have one place put in put in order one board or one stone but what David did with his time he knew that God had said you can't do it David but I am going to raise up your son Solomon a man of rest and he shall build that Tabernacle but in the meantime you're here to serve my will in this generation so let me tell you what I'm going to use you for you're going to be useful David yes Lord there's nothing greater I would desire than I want you to prepare there I want you to gather the stones I want you to gather all the material that's needed but Lord I won't be here to see it but God said you want to be useful yes Lord I want to use you and David was so surrendered to the will of God it didn't matter if he was alive to see his loved ones I mean it didn't matter if he would be here he knew God answers every prayer hallelujah hallelujah think of it down through the Old Testament and the New Testament because see what David David had to have and come the right channel he wanted to be useful is that right but remember David you can't bring that cart back on a mechanical device it's got to be carried on the shoulders of the Levites right it's got to be carried over the hearts in order for the word to come back to a trifle place it's going to be in the hearts of the Levi it's got to be in the hearts of God's children is that right so he had to consult the proper channel so we want to be useful David said Lord I want to be useful I don't see what's happened we're in the breakdown come God said aha he said you'll have to confer with my Prophet you've conferred with all the captains of thousands but you miss the simple Channel and that channel is something that's so common to you you think he didn't know about Nathan he did Nathan was there in his courts day after day it just shows you how simple and how common we can become to one another something that you and I would say duh it ought to be the first thing to consideration but it shows you the part about Humanity that you and I sometimes in the midst of wanting to do something we go to the wrong sources and to them to the right source and anytime you go to the wrong sources notice there was a casualty a man died because of the wrong yielding to the wrong source is that right the word's always right now think of this useful Source notice how Jesus would say in John 17 4 I have given them Thy word and that the world hath hated them speaking to you and I this is the prayer he's praying because they are not of the world even as I am not of the world so here he was in the world but it wasn't of the world you and I are in the world but we're not of it right once we have been born again of the spirit of God we're pilgrims and strangers right we might live in this American body or whatever you know it is but we are pilgrims and strangers there is a life from the other land that's moved into us we might have to we have to work we have to live everything we have to do in this world but we are not of this world oh aren't you glad for that the new birth it's severed that time and we've been tied right back into the Throne of God verse 20 neither pray I for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word so to be useful through their word so Jesus realizes this word is not going to stop when I die when I Surrender my life and offering but as a matter of matter of fact he's making a way that the word can continue and will continue the exact same way he's making a way he's making a preparation remember remember the Lord Jesus he loved the sunsets he loved the fellowship with his Brethren he wanted he wanted to stay with them he wanted to continue that Fellowship but he knew in order to establish that real relationship that was called for he would have to go away I must needs go away you're not going to understand it now but you will because if I don't go away the comforter's not going to come you see there's got to be an offering and a sacrifice in order for that life to come back down inside of you and me and then it becomes his word on display coming through our life there's nothing greater than the display of a trophy of God's grace by the time I'm not a preacher you don't need to be a preacher to preach your life preaches all the time because it's a trophy of God's grace a matter of fact it's one of the greatest testimonies the greatest testimonies of the of the word of almighty God is lives being lived think about how sad and how sorry it would be if it was only preachers right I mean you would look at my goodness I mean it's only preachers no no no no no no no the word was meant to live in the body the true Ministry is only a part in the body that's used in a way for the Holy Spirit to come through that channel to edify the body is that right in the love of God so now I want you to notice this here in Mark chapter 2 verse 16 we pulled from this a little bit last week and I want to just read some of these parts here when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with the publicans and sinners they said unto his disciples how is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners now remember they did not want to have themselves defiled they realize if we get among them we're defiled you know if you touch a dead body and on and on and on they didn't want to be defiled whatsoever but remember Jesus himself was able listen to me now he was able to live in this world he was able to walk among Sinners and yet still live an undefiled life are you with me Jesus was not going with them and saying hey let's just be buddies no that's not the reason but he was going remember the whole purpose of his coming he's on a mission right he's on a mission now notice when Jesus heard it he said to them they that are whole have no need of the physician but they that are sick so you're okay and you think you're okay remember they really needed a great great Deliverance but as far as like them committing this doing this and doing that no you remember remember how brother man puts it you couldn't put a finger on their life is that right you couldn't put a finger there right but notice Here with Jesus he said I came not to call the righteous but Sinners to repentance this is a key phrase this is very crucial Even in our our witnessing our walk among our loved ones among our family among our co-workers we have not gathered to be around them as though to become buddies I I listen friends I love I love being friendly with people one of the things I look at many times I go places and I know it's just some of my makeup sometimes if I see somebody I try to lighten it up a little bit try to talk to him a little bit you know when I go there you know to the meat counter at Fligners or whatever more and many of them you know they know me and we'll talk and things but sometimes you see where people are going through so many different things and whether it's a waiter a waitress or whatever you try to express certain things that ain't build me up that's just that's just part of my makeup I don't like seeing people down but you know there's a part of it when sometimes just a kind word just some little word that can be said I I want to leave somebody's day a little bit better after I've been there than it was before I got there it doesn't mean I got to do headstands and you know spit out things out of my mouth but just to show a little bit of kindness and a little bit of compassion to somebody oh my I would give that testimony now you've already heard it what brother Daryl told but I just can't forsake a time but notice come to call the righteous I'm not come to call them but Sinners to repentance so it shows there must be a standard when Jesus went to their house Jesus was not a compromiser Jesus was not going there because of a party he was going there because some of his children are there I believe as the children of God that we are to be led by the spirit of almighty God sometimes we wonder why why this one and why this one I've witnessed to this one and I've I've talked to this one and I don't see them coming maybe it was our efforts maybe it's not for them or maybe there has to be a time to come that God will move on their heart the greatest thing we can do is if we've been an expression keep on expressing the love of God and leave everything in the hands of almighty God don't get discouraged about it you might say well there may never ever see this message of the hour they may not be ordained to see the message of the hour but maybe they are ordained to see what little bit of life that they're able to see and the light of God and you can encourage them to be all they should be for what God's called them to be is that right so it's a standard of the Living Word now that standard never compromised Jesus never stopped being the son of man when he went in Matthew's house are you hearing me if there's some place that you're going that you've got to stop being the Bride of Jesus Christ better not be going things you're doing that well you know what let all whatever you do in word or deed if you can't do it in the name of Jesus Christ then you better not be doing it is that right so everything we do so Jesus never all of a sudden became sinful and then he came out of Matthew's house and well I'm going to repent you know I God die you know I got among all them and I just couldn't know there was a standard but remember listen to me now that standard that was being reflected through his life it was that life being useful to do what what was he calling Matthew to he was calling Matthew to that life that was within Matthew that was calling out like a deep call into a deep like those who were sitting around there what was it doing it was calling them to the person of eternal life himself and that's what the standard of the Living Word of God is in the bright body of Jesus Christ it's a standard that the world will laugh at the world will make fun at and the world will say why are you judging me we're not judging you it is the life inside of us it is the life of this word and listen we're not compromising on that word word we're not budging off of that word because that is the source of life is that right it's a standard of the Living Word I'll never forget when my when my mom you know let me just read this quote here and leave my mom wondering like dear Lord please take off his mind if it's not good if I forget it somebody said your mom your mom's job some of her bosses you got my permission to speak out it's a standard of living because you see what that you see well listen the presence of God in our life should bring conviction I know we're living in places it's just like you know sometimes you get around people and here they'll you know rip some words off we'll do something like that and sometimes you know there's nothing you can do within that moment but you know I've had them where they came in my classroom and all of a sudden they might have been a substitute teacher they didn't know me and they came in and all of a sudden here they would you know go right into a joke huh and they would look at me and say you don't you didn't like I said no I said I'm a Christian I said I don't talk like that I don't know what you are but I'm a Christian I'm not here to put you down or shame you but there's a standard somebody's got to say it right right it's just like I had a woman come by my room the one time here she was 70 some years old woman sweet sweet old lady and she came by my room one of the first years of teachers hey hey Sam guess what she said it's happy hour today I said happy hour now I knew what happened I was she said it's happy hour I said oh Betty I said I don't go to happy hour she said why not I said I'm a Christian she said well I am too I said well there's something I said that changed in me that took that out of me but I have a happy hour it's every hour of the day I got drunk one time and I'm drunk all the time Glory no brother this message just fits me notice God hates sin but he loves a sinner he loves you so much that he gave his only begotten son that he might drink the bitter cup for you he became you that you might become him he become a sinner separated from the father when he screamed my God why is Thou forsaken me he was separated from God in his death that you in your death might have God's presence he became a child of sin your sins not his own yours that you might become a child of obedience he took your place as a Time creature that you might take his as an eternal son and daughter of God don't even seem fair does it I mean to me I'm thankful for it right it'd be like if somebody you know I was able to trade in you know one of my vehicles and somebody said here here's a brand new car here's a brand new I don't know whatever you'd say and I'd look at oh my goodness my I would think man I'm getting a good deal here are you hearing me now you know it'd be like somebody taking our tricycle away and giving us a big tis 10 10 speed when we're ready to ride it man we'd look at and say I got the better end of the deal oh but think what he gained from it think what he gained he gained our fellowship through the Redemption of his blood that he can come down at any time and fellowship with your eye I know you might look at it I might look like and I say me me but you was worth it because to love somebody it's a risk how many you know what I'm talking about sometimes you might get you know let down with love but it's always a risk and Jesus said it's worth the risk to lay down my life for my sheep could I have just a minute or so let me finish on this this is where it takes remember in the standard of the word living in US were constantly brought to a moment of standing loyal you can think back through your life and even now there's decisions we come to where we've got to make a decision to stand loyal is that right it can many different ways and facets of life but brother Brandon let's just break into this a minute brother Brahm is looking at a young person in the assembly brother Brian says they're a young Christian and questions and answers that's been sitting here right before me and I know a decision that that person made and I certainly appreciate it I'm not going to say or I wouldn't say who it was but I appreciate a decision that this certain Christian regardless of even to whether it would be an associate a friend a father or mother or whatever it was they longed to stand loyal to Christ so brother brahm's not giving any specifics but he's recognizing here's a young Christian that's had to make a decision to make a stand to remain loyal to Christ whether it was father mother friend associate didn't matter who it was now I look at that if the prophet could look at that and see that I know what it I know you and I I mean what it means to one another to know that there are decisions that you and I make to stand loyal to him now you think if brother Branham saw that think about what the Lord Jesus was looking at that's myself I know it was hard on him but they made the right decision and watch how how many could say Lord I want to win loved ones right we want to see our loved ones if you don't want to see your loved ones you you need help right now watch right in this same quote that's the way you win a loved one so you mean stand loyal to what I believe even if it means not going along with them you want to win them what are you trying to draw them to well I just want to have fellowship with them I just wanna that's a selfish reason he didn't go to Calvary for himself he crucified his own will so that he might have Fellowship with you and I there would be a Divine Fellowship not a fellowship where you could have a man like Peter that all of a sudden would turn his back and run on him but a fellowship that would come inside by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the way you win of loved one is by being loyal not loyal to them because that can lead you astray is that right but being loyal is the way you win loved ones so stay to your conviction be sure that you're right with God and then ever remain there wow just stay right with it nothing can ever move you from it if you'll just stay right with it now let me finish on this now we're all going to make mistakes just remember and when you're looking at one another don't look at that other person quote same quote when you don't look at that other person's mistake so you don't do that because remember you make mistakes too anybody here mistake free I know they got everything sugar-free fat-free mistake I wish we hadn't it's like them online things that is sugar-free You Spin The Box on them a little bit a lot of times when it says fat free look at what else they've added you say how do you know because I've inspected it all right there ain't nothing free my mama told me there want no free lunches boy is that right Publishers Clearing House throw it in the trash ain't no such thing you want a brand new car ain't no such thing right because remember you make mistakes too but look to Christ who is guiding this person so instead of focusing on the person look to Christ who's guiding them well what does that do well that helps me and you remain in a useful practical way to God right I won't ask you to raise your hands because sometimes that can be awful challenging right because what we see is the flesh are you hearing me now notice but look to Christ who is guiding the person and if they need some help then you pray for them not pray Lord strike them down I can't even get the scriptures on that tonight that's the way we get along pray how many want to be useful I do like I said I think it was last week we all would raise our hands if the Lord said who'd like to walk on water for me tonight Lord I will sacrifice I will do that gladly for you I will take that burden but what if he asked the question who'd like to be useful for me tonight to go through a test to go through a trial who'd like to be useful to pray for situations who'd like to be useful see sometimes the useful remember what the definition practical purposes so the revelation of God's word comes down to walk in shoe leather to walk in our lives to be used in a practical manner that's why I love when we look at the message of the hour and I look at the seals I see the seals in the family see the church ages in the family see it in our lives see it in our homes you can bring it right down it don't stay out there indoctrine of where people are looking at like whoa look at that chart I appreciate charts but if what's there don't come down here and give me Grace and help me to live then what good is the charts but I believe that application that took the cover off of Satan I believe that same Holy Ghost is here tonight I believe he's in my life he's in your life to do what take the cover of Satan foreign I want to be used that way Hallelujah I want to read the rest of that quote but I want you know maybe I can can I redirect them it's hard and remember when you are praying for somebody else in that kind of a fix in that kind of a fix God will honor and heal you when you're praying for somebody else Lord I got needs in my life but probably throughout this building there's Witnesses every one of us that when we got our sight off of our problems and started praying about others you find your burdens lifted see that don't make sense to our mind in what makes sense to our mind is I've got all this before me this is what I need to be praying about praying about praying about and what happens we stay in our own world our own world our own world our own world our own world sure but you go to praying for others what is it it's the spirit Christ the life of the sacrifice being useful through you God will honor and heal you when you're praying for somebody else that's what Christianity is based on to help one another do for one another be kind to one another understanding to one another if you see your neighbor's mistake you see where they went wrong don't go wrong with them but just pray for them just keep praying and God will understand that he'll make everything right foreign let me come back to my point because I almost forgotten nobody reminded me about my mom my mom had some different different times where there's situations where she had a a lady that she worked with and this lady my mom could never understand you know the way that the lady would react and treat her and things you know and certain things he was passed over and and my mom you know one reason I know this is because it came out later on as testimony because I tell you and it ain't to lift them up because we no doubt her and my dad they probably had their discussions over coffee when I was snoozing it no doubt had their discussions about this in maybe in the back room and I don't know but I know the testimony of it and it's been something that's never left me because you couldn't figure out why that this why the person even would respond in the way that they would and one that my mom was a perfect person but you know what it come down to this woman she had been married multiple times it wasn't her it wasn't you understand me it wasn't her but it was a spirit upon her that caused her to be jealous it caused her to come and act in ways of malice and hatred but I'll tell you God gave Grace and my mom prayed for that person I can't remember all the rest of the testimony but God turned that relationship around and she was one right at dad's funeral wasn't she mom and she's also asked Mom even when she came there let's go out to lunch sometime and you look through all that and you might think go through that but there had to be something displayed to that that woman I don't know where she's at tonight I don't know where she's at my mom could have had everything in the world to act in a certain way and no doubt she felt her feelings trampled on you'll know what I'm talking about but you know what it's what resource you turn to it's God that gives us strength it's God that gives us the grace because through all those things he's molding us my point I'm saying within this it's a standard in our life don't take it personal don't take it personal you understand don't take it personal it's a standard in our life don't compromise just stand true and stand loyal to what you believe because Jesus said if I be lifted up I will draw all men unto me don't you love him Lord I need more grace Lord help me to help me to see and help me to operate in that way I don't preach these things because I'm already there and perfect I'm not preaching to a group of perfect people as far as in ourselves but I am believe I'm preaching to others who say Lord granted Lord in my life I want to be useful Lord help me Lord let that word let it rise in my life let my will be submitted to you let's pray father thank you tonight Lord for your mercy Lord even in the testimonies and things we've given Lord if there's anything that would be any highlight it's you that calls the Lord without you we're nothing and we can do nothing we need your strength we need your grace Lord and father like the simple examples you've given me to use of that of the microphone or screwdriver Lord we want to be so neutral help us to keep ourselves so neutral your Prophet said that's one of the key things in finding the will of God is to stay neutral help us Lord because we never know when decisions will be faced with them we never know Lord in a moment that you would want to use this we might just be going into Lord a medical place to have some sort of an exam or have something done and we think well I'm just going here today I've got this appointment at this in time or I've got this appointment to do this work for this person and that's all we know but God help us because we realize that we are here upon this Earth for a greater purpose we have our jobs we have our occupations we have the things the cares of this life that we have to attend to Lord but Lord Jesus may we always be available for you Lord to use uses help us to remain neutral Lord there's many things that can come our way to try to pull us out of being neutral many things the Lord but help us Lord we know that God we can never do this in our own strength but Lord in your presence as we're feeding on the word of God lord as we're just Lord praying and talking to you and I believe you told us Lord you've spoke to us and Lord many veterans here we realize that praying Lord is not just limited to a Time Lord in our our bedroom or a closet or Upon Our Knees but it's not really even the position of our body it's the prostration of our heart Lord God to the Lord that where we can even a prayer without ceasing when we're always Lord looking to you and talking to you is different Lord just maybe needs or even an expression of Love Lord that would go back to you help us Lord we realize that within all these things as we live in this world yet not of this world we want to walk with such a neutrality about our lives that the spirit of God is able to move down at any moment Lord and uses if there's one thing that took place in Memphis that day when that plane was grounded and Lord the prophet would come out of the hotel room that morning the next morning Lord God when we look at that and we say Lord oh I want to be led like that I believe we are I believe there's things Lord that we've overlooked many times in our own life you were showing us with that example through the messenger's life of just how yield and how neutral you want us to be to where you can move upon us for the simplest of things I think of how the prophet he didn't understand what was going on he didn't know what was taking place what I come to find out as I hear other places in the message how brother Brown was even talking how he would be in a meeting and he would be getting right across the street and the spirit of God said go back over across the street right there there's a man coming down the street with this color of suit on and this and this and this and eater and go and join yourself to this bus there's a woman here with a brown dress and this and this Lord it was to be it showed that was an example that was an example Lord not that we or to take brother branham's place no he had his spot in place it was necessary for the body but Lord he can't take our place either but he yielded himself Lord that a message could be brought you loving tonight amen Hallelujah that's that's our desire if you would like to stand you're more than welcome to always say that because I know sometimes that some of you it's maybe hard to stand but you don't ever have to but if you want to feel like it but a useful life and Lord willing will pick it up and continue to look at some other parts to it I know it's awful simple but godness does nothing outside of man sometimes the things that we're praying about I don't know about you but there's many times I've prayed about things and we need the Holy Spirit to move is that right and many times as we're praying about it Lord we need you to move now I know God can move and speak to somebody by dream right God can speak in many different ways to hearts that but be surrendered God God knows how to get attention God knows how to speak but remember he does nothing outside of man he can visit that life speak to that life but it might be that God would have you and I praying in such a way to where that moves down in our heart to act out Redemption I've said this many times among young people because sometimes with young people they can they don't mean to I know there's sometimes different things that come up and stuff and sometimes in the ages and we're in and things like that and I remember all those feelings I remember those feelings where you enter a room and you almost feel like everybody's looking at you and now I don't have a choice when I go in the room you know you don't have a choice but it doesn't have the same matter that was a season of life I needed God's grace to get through that season right but sometimes you just take a month like amongst young people there can be this group here and this group here and this group here and there might be somebody else that would come in somebody's got to be a redeemer to step out of that group and say hey come on over here hey come on come over here come over here oh brother Samuel that's that's spiritual let me give you the word it's called acting like God it's a redeemer if that Redeemer anointing was upon him and it acted the way it did how much more upon you and I it's a redeemer anointing oh God granted Lord that's my heart's desire isn't it yours Hallelujah sing for us brother Brian lead us what was on your heart Hallelujah deep deep in the love of Jesus yes Lord amen [Music] [Applause] but Lord I pray [Music] every day wow I so blessed Lord in that precious holy hallelujah oh let it be a prayer now deeper deeper and higher Holy Spirit take me deep still yes Lord here my life is wholly

tonight Lord we Look to You Lord as we even would leave Lord this building in the presence of one another the desired Lord was in our hearts is that Lord is your presence going with us and Lord bringing this word to pass in our life Lord is our will to be surrendered to your will help us Lord realizing the real battle every force of the enemy is against us to pull us out of neutrality to being neutral to the will of God but help us Lord because as we're neutral we're not neutral to be pulled into sin and neutral to be pulled over here but it's neutral to where that we are looking to you father Lord to be used of you and like Paul he was desired to be used of you he made a step in a way that Lord that he leaned towards one way and tested but he was still open to the will of God and you spoke to him and said come to Macedonia he was useful he was still neutral help us Lord in everything help us Lord we love you and we thank you Lord be with your children tonight watch over us as we go Lord our separate ways Lord whatever Lord that that purpose is that practical purpose help us to be sensitive if it's like what you closed with us tonight on to pray for something pray for a situation pray for a need Lord we want to be used however you choose to use this in a practical way For Your Glory help us father in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you tonight and go in the
