multitudes of people but your grace Lord is drawing Upon Our Hearts I'm so glad Lord I'm glad that I that Lord we can't be complacent I'm so thankful God that there's a pull there's a desire Lord

Higher Ground Lord an older song that we sing but how true it is Lord lead me on to Higher Ground oh God knowing that it's the ways lord they're not easy but you you have promised and it's true you said take my yoke upon you and learn of me for oh God my burden is light oh God it's you that like your Prophet said said that through that lining Lord upon that oxen as they're pulling that load he said as we become harnessed by the Holy Spirit through the new birth to that word then the trials themselves Lord Oh Our flesh fills it our spirit fills it but God it's lined with feathers of Jehovah Eagle we love you Lord you're faithful in every way Lord what a Heavenly Father we have what a Heavenly Father Lord every day to us is a Happy Father's Day we're so thankful that that Revelation has broken our heart Lord that we have come from God and we're going back to God and you're our heavenly father and we're your children Lord we love you and we thank you we just want to commit Lord every part of this service every word that'll be spoken I'm asking that you would guide us Lord here together there's needs Among Us that Lord no matter Lord how simple or small or how great Lord we need you Lord I'm depending on you and I'm just asking that Lord you would just give us the grace these moments Lord to just step out of the way father that's the greatest request that I have that you

up thankfully the internet and those things now but um it was on Father's Day when the Lord got a hold of my life in brother Bill's basement and next to a dog cage and um amen that to me is always a special moment amen and he's been faithful Amen in all things amen I'm so I'm so thankful to the Lord for his mercies and my amen just so so grateful to be here with you this morning and um we have also a brother Shane that's that's the first time he's heard the words Happy Father's [Applause] Day and uh I'm sure brother sea he's there's a Perpetual smile brother Sean's always got a smile on but you know it's it's just a little bit bigger and it's a little bit you know he's but and so it's so happy for them so happy to have sister Heidi here with us amen and Lily and sister Lily and M Brooks and so we'll see when he starts hearing my voice if he pipes up like he did when I first saw him he turned to look just right at me so uh we just we love you and the Lord so good to see each and every one of you and visitors we have here brother Chad and sister Chrissy amen and different ones and it's just good to be together isn't it amen and uh we just want to just look to the Lord here this morning I wonder if you'll just turn with me to proverbs chapter 20 and we'll just see how the Lord will take this this morning I want to speak on the family um and I don't know if I'll get into I'm not going to rush on this part of it but um I want to would like to speak on a thought that the Lord just just really um dropped in my heart when we were on our way traveling on the way to on the way to DC to the meetings uh last weekend and we were just right writing in the car of just just listening to the message and um this thought I'd like to speak on out of the for a family and that is on Great Men of God great men of God and I want to read here from Proverbs Chapter 20 and verse five if we could to begin it says counsel in the heart of man is like deep water but a man of understanding will draw it out praise God so we we not only want to be God gifts us to be able to receive wisdom and instruction but also that God would give us the same wisdom to know when to apply it and how to apply it because remember the the prophet would tell us and take us into the spoken words Original Seed and is very very key statement because of the hour we're living in we're not just living we're not living in the hour of just the eyes the eyes have come because remember that light might come into the body and that's where now the mind of Christ has come upon the Church of the Living God that's the Capstone that's coming into that time that's why brother bradam could say in the beginning of power transformation he says now that we've been filled with his Spirit as we have we want to be transformed by the renewing of our mind receiving the mind of Christ Christ that's that's a work that's a work that God is doing bringing each of us first of all to the new birth and then from there into mature Sons and Daughters of God that's and that in itself the maturity is not a gift it's victory so we want to be as that the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word I'll tell you he wants it applied right here he wants it applied right here in my life into situations and God give me the wisdom amen for that most men verse six most men will Proclaim everyone his own goodness but a faithful man who can find let's just do the cliffnotes version of this a faithful man doesn't need to just to speak of his goodness that's true the life testifies of itself the just man walketh in his Integrity his children are blessed after him and verse 29 the glory of young men is their strength it's why you want to be as young men young women you want to use your strength for the right things God's given you that strength it's only for a period of it's for a period of time and it starts starts waning you want to make sure you make everything count is that right there's three things that you can always do as a young person you can with your life Life's a precious thing you can either spend it waste it or invest it true that's three things that we have a choice of and the beauty of old men is the gray head now I've got a little bit of that up here right right here but not up there but the beauty and it's not just we we understand you know in another place in the scripture they'll say the Hy head that means gray headed but it's dealing with many can have white hair gray hair and don't have the wisdom right that is needed and that wisdom with that with that of time it it doesn't come through of just speaking it's experiences yes and that's why I look all around the room every one of us God bringing us through experiences and God brings you through experiences tests and trials it's not just for your molding it's to be a blessing to somebody else yeah that's right it's experiences God brings you through this just as much as it says in the scriptures those examples in the Old Testament were written for our admonition not everybody had the exact same trials experiences but we draw from them all as the spirit gives us the application is that right and that's the same thing within our lives amen may God bless you I'd like to just as you're being seated um real quick I wanted to uh kind of give a little update uh very briefly here on uh uh on my neighbor uh Gabe Vasquez he the previous Thursday June 6th the same um uh day that uh sister Ruth Hoyer had went home to be with the Lord uh Gabe had passed on as well uh at that time and you know we had as a church I know many of you had asked at different times how is he doing and um you know uh really for him to have been here throughout that time uh till June 6th it was a miracle uh that in itself was a miracle because uh in March when my other neighbor we were talking they you know since January just to give you this point since January they had to go in and they had he had a colostomy bag from that time in January uh they were actually at a point just some of the doctors that were there a place that he had went to had just come in emergency doctors and they were just hey just go home you need to go in the hospice and his wife with working in the medical field this is seems kind of you know it just so they got another um other there other doctor came in and the other doctor said whoa uh not so soon you're too young we're not giving up like this and uh so he had a a procedure done that where the colostomy bag and then having the pecs system where you're feeding you he never ate solid food from the 1 of January on it was just simply that meal that goes in the bag and then your colostomy bag and I you know in my heart I had been praying and um you know that the Lord obviously I seen his young family had desire that God would just would completely raise him up I've seen God do that there's nothing impossible with the Lord and um you know most of all I you know I wanted that assurance and that part because as they had reached out to me I wanted that Assurance just to know that you know he had he had met the Lord he accepted the Lord as his savior I you know I don't know you or I don't know to what degree and what a person is called to but if they can look to the Lord Jesus Christ as their savior they're saved and so uh I you know had received a text back there and when we were uh communicating and I had been talking and you know been wanting to get talk with him but it just it just hadn't worked out I'd sent a prayer letter a letter with prayer cloth and I have a whole letter typed out and um just to to get to them and um you know he they they took that and and and thank thanked me for that throughout the whole thing um you know it was really a miracle that he would survive till June 1st one of the key things that I was praying about with that is that Lord if if it's your will to take him then I'm I'm asking for Mercy that he would be able to go through June 1st because that's when he would receive his retirement through Ford that way his family would be able to stay in place and so uh God granted that and we're thankful for that um but one of the things that he had mentioned to me he had talked to me and I had you know I had over I seen that text but you know so many months ago and you sometimes you wonder if this is all there's probably another message that will come out of this but if there's anything at all sometimes we can get the wrong thoughts about things we can get to where that we have things that seem so real in our mind and nobody's said it nobody's done anything but we have so real in our minds as though that we think this is exactly how it is and we're well you know I wonder why wasn't he wanting to talk with me why wasn't and I thought I thought at some point my I had you know heard that he was maybe you know maybe a little Disturbed or something like that you know going through the whole situation but I traced back in my mind I thought I can't I can't get that I can't get anything settled on that and um I went back to a text that he had sent me and my wife and I were talking and um he had sent me a text he said Sam he said I am trusting in the Lord Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior and it took me clear back to a text that he had sent back in the first parts of January and I kept that text I kept on that thread that he and I had and I went back to that and the reason what took me back to that now I want this is what I want you to think I've prayed all these months thinking as though somehow that oh God May soften his heart Lord soften his heart God had already softened his heart but I was trying to figure out why can't I get to him Lord I want to get to him Lord open the door you know I don't want to just go bust in the door because he's been a very sick man some days he don't get out of bed and so I don't want I've always told him I'm here we're here for you if you ever need anything for the children or anything we're here and uh and checking on you know his wife and things and this is what his wife said and this is what spurred everything she stood in the yard on Thursday morning and we were talking and we were just you know just I was there just ministering to her and she said Sam she said she said the fortitude that he had she said I know that it was the prayers of the people she said because she said through it all she said the battle that he fought she said an example he rolled in pain just in the last week and at night she said because they hadn't given him you know maybe sufficient with pain and the doctors would come in the next morning and say how are you doing Gabe he said doctors I believe it's taking a turn for the better she said I she said I'm sitting there in the room thinking are you kidding me what I just seen you go through last night but she said he he held that to the very end and I begin to realize within that I I'm just I'm being very transparent with you that there's sometimes we can get the wrong thoughts about things and where that all of a sudden that when I come to realize God just and to me I was grateful that I could say Lord I'm glad that I have that peace that I know that he had that settled with you and I realized why wasn't it that when they were trying to get him hey just to come and to to talk with me or me to come there why wasn't it why wasn't he going into all that because you know what everything when he would look at that that was to look at as defeat does that make sense to you yes and when that happened I realized that thought it kept me praying but my thought was in it it wasn't at all that he was angry with God it wasn't at all that he did that there was which you know a person without knowing without the Lord but I I just wanted to share that there's no doubt a message that come from there many quotes I can pull from that you know in scriptures and things sometimes our imagination is a very powerful thing imagination it can make it seem very very very very very very real and yet it's not real at all but I'm grateful to God I want to say thank you for your prayers for him and uh just may God uh richly richly bless you we want to continue to keep his family in prayer um today I thought about as I looked over there and I seen him and um Gabe was just a tremendous man and um there's a lot that he he would do for me Sam here take this tool try this out try this do this and do that and you know he was you know guiding me along in certain things and but he was just he was just a tremendous man and um I thought when I looked over there and I seen that to where today's Father's Day and his daughter she's 16 and just um lovely children the little boy he's 12 and so just remember them in prayer if you would the God who just just just minister to them and and help them amen through this and uh also we want to remember continue remember the Hoyer family I know brother Ed Hoyer he was headed on his way to BC I think he's there with brother Andrew his son now so we're thankful for that and uh some things you know being connecting with the family so you just keep them in prayer I I didn't mean to take time like this cuz I don't worry I know all this time counts I know every bit of time when I stand here it counts uh but um I just would like to just speak to you here a few moments and um this morning by the grace of God and I also want to mention brother this Thursday brother Brandon cicola is going to come and Minister be ministering for us uh my family and I are going to actually take just a few days here just to get away and it's been a couple years since I had done that and um you know I just uh just as we're coming off of a ministering trip and I tell you when I I'm just to give a little background on some things uh when when I'm not here and I'm on a ministering trip I really covet your prayers uh because it would be easier for me to stay here and be at home than go and Minister because when you go when it coming out like that it's not only the travel but it's the burden on My Heart Lord what do I say to these people and many of the times I go I don't know you know sometimes God will let you know in advance what you're going to speak on and other times it's not and I just trust him I know when he's laid the burden on my heart but then it's it's almost like you feel just even a greater release than I do on a normal Monday but I just I maybe you don't understand that and that's okay but I'm just asking you to pray for me when we when we go like that because I Lord knows I would rather just stay here it would be uh be easier so we love you and I want you to say this on the other side you'll see the effect of your prayers amen amen you'll see the other effect you you are a part of it amen this of the Ministry that God has brought us together and we're a part of the same vision we're part of the same vision we're not separate Vision we're part of it we're together so I want to speak here just a a few moments and I will just lay this in here uh this morning on Great Men of God and I want to begin just with reading a the Psalm of Life by Henry wodsworth Long Fellow you're familiar brother brandham quoted this many many times in the message and and this this was written with a purpose that young men and others would recognize there's a purpose in life there's an objective in life and how that God himself molds and shapes our life this written a long time ago but brother Brandon would always draw from it and especially the last stanza you'll recognize a lot he's referred to the whole thing before but let me read this he says here here he begins on the writing of this psalm tell me not in mournful numbers life is but an empty dream for the soul is dead that Slumbers and things are not what they seem life is real life is earnest and the grave is not its goal dust Thou Art to dust returnest was not spoken of the Soul not enjoyment and not sorrow is our destined end or way but to act that each tomorrow tomorrow find us farther than today Hallelujah art is long and time is fleeting and our hearts though Stout and brave still like muffled drums are beating funeral marches to the grave in the world's broad field of battle in the bavc of Life be not like dumb driven cattle be a hero in The Strife trust no future however ever Pleasant Let the dead past bury its dead act act in the living present heart within and God overhead lives of Great Men all remind us we can make our lives Sublime and departing leave behind us footprints on the sands of time footprints that perhaps another sailing over life solom man a forlorn and ship brother seeing shall take heart again let us then be up and doing with a heart for any fate still achieving still pursuing learn to labor and to wait I want to look here in this as we look at that in that Psalm of Life it's very clear that every like brother brand would tell us every heartbeat we're we're closer we're closer if God carries we're every Every Beat is closer to that that to that moment if the Lord terries we will all go by the way of the grave and what matters within it all is that the purpose that in life and that is the main purpose and the main purpose is to be born of the spirit of God and then allow God to unfold the purpose that he has intended and brought and and intend for each of our life because our life we're we're not here for a temporal purpose Paul would would Express that from his heart what God had put in his heart we are here for an eternal purpose if God has called us to be a part of his word of himself in this hour there's an eternal purpose that God has called us to and it's God that unfolds that purpose to our life and though as we read here in that Psalm there are uh great men are not men that are mistake-free great men are not men that are perfect in themselves but great men are men that whom God would speak to and they respond to his voice and take a hold of that promise that takes a hold of their life and seek to become what God has ordained and is calling and moving in their heart to become that's great men of God this is why when Longfellow would write that there as it says even when you have uh you know a a a a you know a Shipwrecked brother a forlorn brother but they can look at another that's gone ahead and say my how that they were knocked down here knocked down here knocked down here but they got back up what was it in them that caused them to get back up and that's that's what we're that's what we're looking for is that is looking at that having a real example Great Men of God I want to just read here out of Isaiah 60:1 the Bible said arise and shine for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee now you know this written here uh by by Isaiah moved by the spirit of God but it was written promise for this hour you see not only has God stored up the wisdom that is needed for the moment but God in himself by his Spirit reaches in those deep Waters and brings out the understanding that's needed for this moment you I you I could never have found these places all the way through the scripture and you recognize that the Bible itself is a book that's written for this hour we're not just having a a a a promise that we're looking to just one promise but we recognize that the whole the prophets and sages and all have looked and longed for this hour to come this hour of the Rapture this moment because when as the Rapture is upon us the Gentile Church being C away then we recognize that Israel receives her visitation and God's made a promise he's going to bring little Benjamin back God's going to he's going to restore Israel and this is where God is going to fulfill his word of even planting her in the land God is going to bring about that Millennium it's going to lead into the future home we we are here at the time of the ending of all things and you recognize that the the the corruption and everything that we see around us if let me just say it like this if you can't see that the world itself is falling apart then you need you need your eyes renewed because the world is full of corruption and deceit things are so confused there's no longer we're living in a world that hates absolutes they call good evil and evil good they we're living in a time in an hour and let me just say this to you to understand it's not the people it's Spirits because people listen listen in a man in his normal reasoning would not even think that way this is why the prophet said in in going beyond the camp he says Satan is taking his people beyond the camp of human reasoning that's good the simple things that should be known things that you don't need the Bible to know are you hearing me simple things and yet Satan is taking people beyond the camp of human reasoning now at the same time God is taking his people Beyond human reasoning but bringing us back into the mind of Christ because now with the mind of Christ then we have a judgment that can set at the Gate of reasoning and say that's not according to the word not going to take that you see th it's important and this is where God has brought you and I too in this hour by the grace of God through the holy spirit this is the strength of the hour and let me tell you knowledge itself is not enough to stem the tide of this hour you say what do you mean by that well in the days of Noah in the days of Noah the only thing that could withstand the waters the flood waters was being in that Ark and that Ark was to be in Christ amen that Revelation that Noah had received it was a vision it was a word from God and he be to labor in that vision and what he had as a vision as a word from the Lord became became material people laughed at the vision at what he said but when the vision became material when that became material then it was time for the prophecy to fully be fulfilled and the same way the word of the Lord has come to your life by vision and you're walking by faith which is God's revealed word and that Vision in your life what others can't see what others don't know about but it has laid hold on your life it's affecting your life and your Works declare the faith that's in your life from The Unseen realm and as this word is becoming material one of these moments it'll be the final moment for the word becoming material becoming flesh in our life you understand what I'm saying the word is wanting to become flesh this is why even the Holy Spirit deals with the life to lead us into repentance to bring conviction on our life and dealing why would God deal with things that you could look at and say that's very minuscule why does God have to deal with us about dress and this and that God takes little simple things to show that there's certain things that are not hitting the Mark just to do point out for one thing what spirit is in you if that Spirit resists the word or explains the word away it's not the Holy Spirit we can have the spirit of God on our flesh we can have it on our mind listen we can even enjoy his presence sitting right here but it's got to come to where it's more than just us benefiting or what he can do for me and how he makes me feel it's got to come to where the blessing comes to the place that it is ordained to come and that's the place where the blessing becomes life that's good yes sir is that right this is how God works and he deals with our life in such a very h a very special way we're living in a time in an hour and a season we're in that you know uh uh as we said knowing them they could not in that day they did not have the strength to stem the tide they had boats they had boats they had ships yeah Noah wasn't the only one but the with Noah he had a god constructed boat there you go some of them may have had a two-l boat may had a one Lev boat they might have just had a justification some might have had a justification sanctification but Noah had a three level boat and in that uppermost part of that boat he had a window there was a door opened in heaven that said come up hither hallu are you hearing me now he had there was a strength now look what Noah did as a great man of God his family was moved around the vision that God had in his heart decisions that they made in Noah's house was based on the vision of the word are you hearing me they could have come to knowah Daddy there's another field down the way we can plow that field and still be able to work on the we can do all of this and Noah no doubt Noah was tempted and to look daddy we'll be able to have more resources daddy will be able to do this but it would have to come back to if anything is going to take away and there moves the vision from being first priority then we're missing the mark but but Daddy we might need this we might need that if God gave the vision then God Will Supply the need in this hour that's a great man of God hallelu see in this the scripture I read that gross Darkness that's spiritual that's spirits that are upon the people brother BR says in the message Shalom and he's talking about this and many times he talks about it even then going beyond the camp and things he said men are becoming more like women women are becoming more like men do you know this didn't start in this age if you trace back that feminist M movement which is to Dem masculin that's right that started back in the 1800s yeah that's right that's right there's seeds that came about and all of those things it begin to come about that's right seeds produce a crop and you say well we're talking about spirits but do you realize the Holy Spirit Travels by the word Spirits travel by words this is why be careful little eyes what you see be careful little ears what you hear that's are you hearing me Spirits travel by words this is why brother Bram could say and you must be born again false teachers produce false births because word that's why this listen this is why that a minister his life should be clean before Goden because if not if it's not clean that spirit will try I don't care how how precise that he is if there's anything in his heart that's not right it'll travel with that word that's right right that's responsibility and let me just say this that should not only be the requirement that we hold Ministry to but it should be the requirement in our lives when I say something I want the Holy Spirit to be the amen behind it not to where it reaches something in my life and it's coming out and it it's bitterness it can't go no further it can't be effective the word words words that come out of our mouth it's not the words that are effective out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh this is why David said not not only let my words but let the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight oh God this is an hour for the heart this what this message come to do was to turn our hearts back to the faith of the father and that Faith was a Bible Faith it's a faith that is produced by the Holy Spirit himself living in your life that will punctuate every word to be amen even when the word comes and it corrects our life a great man of God will stand with that word and say so be it Lord I'm wrong I'm missing the mark right here but your word is true Lord be it unto me according to Thy word yes we have to step up to the duty you just brother B says it's like a heavy this he said it's like a heavy dark fog that's over the whole earth and we see it we see it it's smothering this is what he says it's smothering out real manhood real Womanhood yes sir wow many of even teachers I've never asked them different ones I've talked to they've come up to me and different ones that's asked and they've they've spoken hey they're looking to get out of it yeah right that's right because of the way things have got to sure who would have thought a kitty litter box in a classroom or in a bathroom you say oh that's just far out listen we used to be living in a time where you could put it off as West Coast and East Coast but the worldwide web has linked everything together to where it don't matter how country buunk in the school is or how Uptown City it is them Spirits have venues to travel through and it's affecting and influencing lives amen yes true let me just say it as plain as I know how God made a man to be a man the scriptures said he made them male have you not read he made them male and female in the beginning and just in case they want to argue they've you know got all these signs on restrooms now somebody was telling me of a of a place where they've got this sign you know where it's either you know it's neutral and then they got a sign next to it I guess somebody might been trying to been funny they said they got this old ugly looking thing and they said whatever too it's Spirits friends it's Spirits it's not the people I hope you understand what I'm saying it's not the people it's no there's no Reformation there's no psychologist there's no psychiatrist there is no answer for the crisis in this hour but the coming of the Lord it's the coming of the Lord that's the only hope for this world that's the only hope for a life that's under darkness is the coming of the Lord because when the Lord has come in your life he changes you from death unto life he removes confusion from your life that's what he does [Applause] but the confusion is not because of psychologist and psychiatrist they've only Fallen under it the confusion is because of that which calls herself the mother church and every one of her daughters that's come out of her at one time they despised her and came out in reformation and great Protestant but after so long a time they begin to look back we need to go back to Mama they begin to compromise they begin to let down let me tell you when God is in your life you don't have to back down one ioda from any devil I don't care how you feel I don't care how great the situation is before you you have an authority by God's word in this hour if you'll stand for God he'll stand for you we're living in a generation that's ashamed of the son of man they're ashamed of the word to be made flesh but the scripture said if you'll not be ashamed of me and my words in this generation then I'll not be ashamed of you I tell you need to throw off shameful feelings you need to throw off shameful complexes and say I'm going to stand for God's word I'm going to stand on God's word I'm going to say Amen to the word of God you first got to agree with God's word but it Smothers it out Smothers it out to where that men and women don't want to stand like they ought to stand compromising I'm not here to ril on anybody I want you I hope you understand that I think you do I haven't watched any the video but I've seen the headlines oh the Southern Baptist convention has just had their big vote to allow women pastors when was that ever a vote when was voting on whether or not God's word still [Applause] applies you know why they do that because it started out with them rejecting God's own life look Calvary is a wonderful thing but Calvary was not meant to just be something that you look at and see he was my sin Bearer it's to realize it was also the way that was made for you that you and I could follow him in through victory that he submitted his own will to the will of God that the will of God might come to you and I that we would not be born of the will of man but of the will of God that's what he did a real stand like men ought to be and take a stand right brother BR you know he says it like this I don't have this quoted but I have it in front of me here I just wanted to refer to and he says you know see the man out there wearing velvet pink shoes and stuff like that and they become more like women women smoking cigarettes and now they got cigars and cut their hair like men and the dainty lady feminist something is gone and the real masculine man is gone all he seems to think about is something evil on the other side well brother Samuel you know it's just normal for a man to think about certain things oh it got quiet now that's just normal normal normal for what what who stand you know the Bible said whosoever lookth upon a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart sisters let me tell you something when you when you dress in a provocative way it's not the holy spirit that would lead you to display flesh you might be covered up flesh all the way up to here and all the way down to your toes but it's also how that you've covered that FL too amen come on the spirit of God leads you to Veil yourself that's that that that's a simple look at that's just even a simple litmus test to say what's the desire of my heart what's the desire of my life let me tell you God created you the way he wanted you and it's natural desire to want to look beautiful but don't let Satan that interpreter that came the don't let him interpret it are you hearing me don't let him interpret it you let God's word be the truth and every other man's word be a lie yes maybe you didn't have a father or somebody who really showed you what it was like for a man to treat a young lady maybe you didn't have a daughter or a father that actually would be able to to express to you who what your beauty was that you're beautiful you you have God I don't we're just going to go with this but you see that's that in itself God is a God that specializes in going down into areas that nely where you can look at and say that's the truth but there's something that wants to hold over and keep you from obeying it I would look down and say God go to the innermost part of my life if there's anything that's been tied up that would be hindering me from saying Amen to the word that I am fearfully and wonderfully made and every part of your word is yaying amen then God go down to the depths of the subconscious if there's something that's been said that I've retained that I'm not even aware of if there was something that was lacking in my life then God you are my heavenly father you knew I would be here Lord you're the one who cares for me nobody ever cared for me like Jesus I'm telling you God rolls up his sleeves in this hour and goes to work that's good if God would deal with a little life that had been chased by a big yellow dog when she was just a little girl and that fear had been in her life and the Holy Spirit would go down in that subconscious and relieve her from that the same spirit of God works right down in your subconscious in my subconscious to relieve us from things that either weren't said or things that were said things that weren't done or were done are you hearing me friends I'm talking about I'm talking about our heavenly father one who's there he brings healing in his wings there is healing hallelujah hallelujah so sure man in himself you can say well isn't that part still there and isn't well sure there's desires there but just see this is why it's just like when when young it could be young men that would come and you know don't matter where I'm at in camps or whatever brother Samuel I I want I want you to pray and ask God to take this lust Spirit from me and my response is God has given you a desire in your heart he's put that desire in your life now we want to bring it under the control of the holy spirit it's not saying God Strip This desire out of me that you know that you know that I there there's an attraction it's not that let it come under the Govern of the Holy Spirit that's what we want we want it to be under the governance of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah yes sir because remember the prophet himself had a cross he hung in his car and he said don't tell me he said that there's not a spirit that don't try to come over you when you see an ungodly woman he said I've had the Holy Ghost for years that's right you see our our Prophet was not he's not one he was he was a real man yes he was let me tell you something God work remember what Paul said you got many inst structures but you got one father in The Gospel is that right and to recognize that how this word has brought you and I into a place to where what it does it dismantles confusion as we feed on this word we're setting under this word because this word has not come from the origin of man this word has come from the mind of God we're not living in the hour of presuming and probing we're living in the hour we're saying that were laying loose are now tied together and we can see Christ clearly is so and let me tell you it took a great man of God to do that I'm not talking about the DNA of William brandom but I'm talking about when a man who was willing to stand there on what God had revealed to him and when every denomination when everything turned him down he wouldn't been to it they brought checks on the platform they they promised we'll buy you a jet we'll give you money but here was one listen this was an example to show that it's more than the fortitude of a man it was a revelation taking hold in the heart of God's prophet and he was ordained for this hour he was ordained for that so it's not you or me trying to compare ourselves with brother brandham but it's that quality of the Holy Spirit of the new birth in this hour that has come I've Got Confidence that the same ho ho ghost he has I've received it'll bring me to where it brought him that's the confidence not you or me comparing ourselves with brother bradam but it was to compare ourselves with the word and to recognize oh a great man it isn't that a great man's going to have all the pats on the back and thought of this way and thought of that way but a great man of God is a man that will stand for God will stand for truth he might have to stand alone but he'll stand this is why David in Psalms 144 Psalms 144 he said I will sing a new song unto thee Oh God upon a salt tree and an instrument of 10 strings will I praise Praises unto thee it is he that giveth salvation unto Kings who deliverthat that is so good that what was it what was it that made David a great man was it because that he was mistake free you heard that preached on last Sunday but what you found was is he was one who realized I am not the king exclusively here on Earth but my king is the Lord God Almighty I didn't come into this position simply because I happened to be at the right place at the right time God ordered my footsteps God has brought me through experiences and the same God hallelujah that brought David into that that same God molded David shaped David and brought him into position I never forget it brother Wendell mentioned something like it but I always think about my here was on a midweek service and my dad was ministering and it was one of those moments that just always stuck with me and I had really loved it he said God he took it it said God called David he had chosen David called him and anointed him and once David got anointed then he groomed him see this is why the anointing is different from the adoption the anointing the new birth is not your adoption we grow up into him in all things you see this is why the mind of Christ setting down and oh my don't you love him now what's what's how David David takes this approach here just give me just a few moments to lay this part in David David sees this and he says rid me and Deliver Me from the hand of strange children that word strange means foreign remember God didn't want his people mixing with the inhabitants of the land he said God told him he said if you allow the inhabitants to remain I'm warning you if you're not fellowshipping with the right ones your children are going to end up marrying them come on God had to deal with that in Nehemiah is that right when Nehemiah came back and said why are some of them speaking this some of them speaking this language a asked and some speaking this and some hey wait a minute we don't want a bunch of languages do you realize that's what God did in this hour we had a Baptist language Lutheran language Methodist language but God came and restored a pure language the language of the Holy Ghost of the word back into the Church of the Living God God changed your language he took the names of bow out of your mouth because as long as you had the names of bow you couldn't see yourself for who you really were and did not see that God and Christ are one and all that God has put in Christ he have poured into the church God took those names out how did he take the names out he took it out of your heart your heart has been turned back a language that was dead a language that was faint but God has brought a people back into the land once again the spirit of God is in the Land once again once again the people are hearing direct from God as they did at the day of Pentecost direct line [Music] Hallelujah deliver me from the hand of stranger R me I I I I don't want to see how much I can mix I don't want to see how much I can fit in I don't want I don't want that and whose mouth speaketh vanity and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood and not real strength my why David why that our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth that our daughters may be as Cornerstone Stones polished after the similitude of a palace that's separation God calls for separation listen God still calls for separation God continues to call for separation sometimes the separation maybe where you're sitting at today is not about smoking drinking and and lust and all these other things out here maybe it's it's beyond that God's calling you and I to a separation to where it's separating from see taste feel smell here conscience memory reasoning affection that's what God is calling Abraham's seed to it's separation now I know through this building right here we've all been called to that maybe just as like I expressed right here when I was talking about my neighbor God called me to separate hey hey Samuel your thoughts about it let me tell you it was wrong seemed awful real I mean I was looking at things I was so burdened but God called me to a separation now I had a choice I could continue to stay with those same thoughts or I could take what God was leading me and showing me you see so sometimes the separation just simply where we're laying it down as God deals with it oh my go to that verse 15 at the end this is the result David talks about other things happy is that people that is in such a case yeah happy is that people whose God is the Lord I want say it takes the real source to bring forth the real thing in a man or woman to bring that right example of what manhood Womanhood and Christianity ought to be you recognize that here within it brother brand would make statements and I'm just going to refer to these and he would say he says man he said you can see men that are just strapping and man I mean they're just you know it seems like they're just the absolute physique of what a man should be now listen brother brandham appre appreciated manhood you remember when when he was had that complex and was going to go off and he talked about that man who came in there and eating pancakes at the at the diner him and Billy and that man he said he let out a big I chewy brother bram's I thought yeah brother Bram wasn't an ogre he wasn't a brute but what he was seeing is is where men themselves were becoming so dainty you know why it's a spirit upon the age you know why Ahab acted the way he did because not only was he a half-hearted Believer but he married a woman that turned his heart she was taken and Smitten by her beauty but she brought her religion with her she brought her beliefs her teaching she brought it with her it all comes with every bill every debt everything comes it's a complete package is that right well some of y'all got quiet you don't know if I say Amen or not but you see this is the result no doubt Ahab was a man now remember Ahab himself was live he was raised in a home it was a lukewarm home it was a home that you know they they they were Israelites they were Jews but they weren't fervent in serving God they just they just let little things go and and begin to just explain things away and look what it did for this young man who now become a husband he was no more fit to lead a home than nothing you know why the lack of training from when he was just young oh they got quiet you realize these are things it isn't just something what's packed in us and all of a sudden one day it just all of a sudden comes out that's good but you see listen it's the same way with God how could you and I come in listen now how could you and I come into the place for Rapture if he himself was not here to lead us all the way that's right he doesn't just birth you and I but he guides us the prophet would use it like this he trains us with nail scarred hands that we might conform to His Image in our walk yes sir and he's patient with us sometimes we I don't know I don't Lord yes Lord yeah yeah Lord be yes Lord I I know that's true but God you know God don't look down and say now your heart's not in it and condemn us but he just knows it's getting there let me just keep making pass after pass over their life let me just keep working with them you know why because God God doesn't condemn you into something he doesn't shame you into something but God comes down and by his love his love is what where you can look and yell there's a shame but you're not coming out of Shame you're recognizing what's holding me back what's laying around me what have I allowed what have I permitted and yet his love is so much greater to reveal that and that he is the way Hallelujah that is the faithfulness of God that's why brother BR could say that man himself is not measured by his muscles not measured by his stature man is a man by character that's the reason he said Jesus was the greatest man that ever lived I say Amen to that greatest man that ever lived there was nothing could measure to his character no beauty that we should desire him so Jesus I hope you understand I'm not I'm Not Jesus would not have been on the cover of GQ magazine he would not have been the poster in the men store there was no Beauty we should desire him you know why it was to bring what was real true character what a real true man is a man is more than male with male anatomy a man is a man made by the spirit of God do you realize before there was a physical man with the label male the Bible says in Genesis 1:26 let us make man in our own image and our own likeness what was it Spirit man that image was lost with the fall but God came down in order to restore that real image of what a man really isall so a man is not just one who fathers children he's not just one who plays te- ball he's not just one who goes fishing he's not just one who mows the grass all of those things are duties and responsibilities but a real man is a man whose life has been brought into contact with God where he knows who he really is and he has become a servant to the Living God because that character that you and I have received an invitation to have our character molded too it said who was in the form right of God but he thought it not robbery to be equal with God took upon himself the form of a servant always love how brother Bram says it in the message total Deliverance he says he was a man completely in his physical parts he could have been a man I find that incredible that statement I've always but he said he chose to deliver himself into the hands of God you see he could have lived according to other men and how they had lived but he chose to deliver himself into the hands of God I tell you this morning there's no greater thing that you or I could ever do than to deliver oursel into the hands of God oh brother Samuel I I you know I I believe I've been born again I believe my my nature has been changed there's an amen in my heart my desire is to please God then if there is there there is a constant desire to deliver yourself into the hands of God lord I don't want to walk by my own thinking I do not want to walk by these things I do not even want to claim besetting sins as oh I Fall to this I Fall to that no I want to Proclaim that you are my deliverer Lord you are my victory Lord I refuse to walk in subjection to this I am victorious in Jesus Christ I choose I choose to confess my wrongs the prophet leads the church in that message in delivering ourselves in a total Deliverance he said if there's a wrong feeling you got against somebody if there's ANC confess sins deliver yourself into the hands of God let me tell you friends you'll never find such a liberty as when we will do that and apply that but sometimes things can get so accumulated in our life and you know when things get accumulated in our life and it hinders you in your walk with God your you let it hinder you your prayer life and Satan wants to make you feel in a certain way and so you hold back from praying and reading and getting into the message or maybe coming to the house of God because you're feeling Satan is putting you right in the corner where he wants to be because he knows within yourself in me as well there is no help within myself but my help is in the Lord he is the strength and the source of my life I don't care if you feel lower than the padding under this carpet but you get in God's presence and say Lord You're the one that's able to raise me up you're the one that's able to break the Gloom and the doubt you are my way maker Lord you're the one who opens prison doors opens up blind eyes Lord You're the same God that changes heart you're the same God that brings Deliverance I am going to present myself before you my my my his character greatest man that ever lived because a man could be ever such out here but not be an ounce of man in it I want you to understand there's some there's some real men there's men that when I say men real men they're fathers and other things like that but I want to just say that what God has intended for each of us to be is that we would bear the characteristics of God that's God's desire of what a real man is it the world doesn't Define that sometimes you know the world it you know before it was just they had such a a Persona of the way things were but yet it was still them looking at things remember brother Bram said even before he said of a husband he said husband's not a dictator to treat his wife like a doormat but neither is she to be one that's ruling over him see all of that is kept in its balance you might say well how do I bring that in its balance you first of all as the man have to be in contact with God and submitting yourself to God because it will have to be God that will be displayed through your position that'll bring your wife into position or even vice versa you say give me an example on that well I can take every example down through scriptures with men of God but but let's just talk about this hour that we're living in God sent a word through a messenger who came into his position and Authority look at the effect of that word and where it's brought you and I oh that's so good it's a word that's laid here the whole time remember the opening of The Seven Seals it wasn't something added it's on the back side of the book meaning an end time Revelation but when the seals are taken off then the nature of Christ is fully revealed to the Church of the Living God it has taken that in order to bring the church into position to what you and I ought to be it wasn't theology brother ramam said in Rising of the sun he sent that little Eagle in the barnyard he wasn't a story about an eagle that got his attention it was a living Eagle that came over him and he recognized there's something that struck him that's who I am this was a great man of God brother Brown was what 5'6 5'7 wouldn't it been something God could have sent a messenger and he would have been some strapping guy with barn door shoulders so eloquent with his words would have had education degree upon degrees you know what as powerful as this word would have been you or I would have looked right at that and thought Lord our humanness our humanness just like it does even among right here in the body where you look oh my if if I could just be like so and so if I you don't know what so and so's going through you don't know what so and so's been through you don't know the mistakes and the failures and the trials and the tests that has come in order to bring them where they are but all of those things to a child of God works together for the good and what is the good there's one good and that is God that God might be fully displayed in a greater way in our life that's the good that's come out of it here God took a man in his hand and he showed us not just on the platform though we've seen it night after night that man that had knocked many preachers out come up here and you know the story he came up here spit in his face brother Bram demonstrates it has this roll down go ahead release your hands around some of you probably got F fist clenched right now he's rolling down now brother Bram said I sized him up right I sized him up but he says there was fear that came he said but I chose to think different thoughts do you realize what Authority you have those examples through the message don't just read over them God is showing you and I don't think you're defeated because of thoughts that are coming in your mind choose to think different thoughts you're a Son of God take dominion over this God has made you in his own image and likeness you are in control I don't care how out of control you feel the situation is as long as you can be subm it into the hands of God then it invites God on the scene and God took control of that situation because God took it personal God took that challenge and brother brandham allowed himself to get out of the way you know brother brandham would have held anything against that man you know brother Bram would have held anything and said that guy what right does he have to come up here and spit on me I am a servant of God you know if he listen not what he'd said if he'd have thought that it have been a different story brother samel you say but and then all of a sudden when things are said oh brother Samuel that makes it so high you've got to recognize the power that's within you don't saell yourself short don't minimize God recognize the god that's in you the same God that's in you listen I don't care if you've got a speck you've got enough in you to whip every devil out of hell with just one spec you've got enough to stand upon God's word word and call the promise [Applause] yours Hallelujah it ain't about the quantity it's the quality if brother brandom would have held one thing you'd have read a different story he'd have been laid out there like the rest see that shows the effectiveness you see how Satan Satan wants to get you and me in that realm I didn't act out in the flesh but remember the flesh just isn't this it's the spirit as well that's right it's your spirit as well where you can keep things Harbor things and you've got things in file cabinets and you keep that's where bitterness lays and it'll affect everything else you know what bitterness does it chokes out it Springs forth then it defiles many wow my my I'm talking about a real man right I'm talking about real women it isn't something that we look at my brother BR was you know my prove your manhood brother r go ahead you know and size him up it was showing us what a real man is is one who was under the control of the Holy Ghost AM for the sons of God are led by the spirit of God and he didn't just show that on the platform it happened in his home where the enemy was stirring up trouble in the home and here he came the the same God on the platform was the same God at home might have looked a little different didn't have a suit and tie but had an apron on honey can I borrow an apron all I got some one with flowers that'll [Laughter] do doesn't matter what it is God came on the scene and the enemy was cast out of the home through prayer a real man is a man that has contact with God and can be led by God Amen that's what God came to restore that's why when the Holy Ghost has come let me just tie this up this part of it when the Holy Ghost has come the Seal of the Living God you become an ins sign an example and the prophet says it like this you become an example of Christianity manhood and Womanhood why because he breaks the confusion can I have just a few more minutes maybe two three you say Brother Sam I was raised my daddy was a man's man my you know my my my mama boy she was a good mom he comes to break every confusion and there are good things that we have seen listen friends there's things that no doubt that there are things that you can look and if you look hard enough I don't care you can go through it oh my dad was this my dad listen don't just look at all the negative because there's no doubt some positive things that you can take from too abolutely you see what I'm saying that we are people of Truth are you hearing me we're people of Truth where we don't just throw throw it all out we look for truth that's right I'm saying I'm here for truth this is a time of assembling truth right maybe maybe the only thing you can think of right now he was a hard worker he believed going to work he believed in being faithful he believe hey that that's a great quality in this age in this day and age in this day and age Ah that's a great quality right maybe your dad had to work his way up from pushing the brooms to eventually he was a foreman H in this day and age they want to start as the CEO I mean after all I've went to college book smarts don't mean anything if you can't draw out of deep Waters understanding and know how to un to KN it and all you become is somebody that's filled with a lot of knowledge with no application I don't listen to me I don't want the smartest doctor or the smartest surgeon I want one who is surrendered and his humble and is simple I'm not interested in anybody oh they made the greatest marks I'm interested in somebody that can do the job right see you say what are you saying brother Samuel I've known a lot of people that's been valid dictorian that ended up as nothing that's nothing to shy away from getting good grades but I went to school with many of them in Somey they went to college one year and dropped out you know why they were used to everything coming easy one thing that helped me from a from a teacher that I had and it gave me courage because I I looked at myself I thought dear God I'll never be able to go to college I'm doing all I can right now the one thing he told me he said he didn't tell me he was saying to the whole class to me I took it it I took it and ran with it he said with college you don't need to be smart you just need to have common sense and you need to have drive to study I took that and ran with it I thought well I can do that I can do that but you know what it took even more than that it took the Lord I say it took the Lord I hope that's all right but real real Christianity it brings us to that place of real manhood real Womanhood so I just want to I want to end it with this this part of it just to give you this thought and the Lord willing we'll pick it up I want to just say it in this way in order to kind of give you something to kind of think about great men are not born Great Men that's right they become great Men by the promise that they hold in their heart right brother Brandon made a statement and I'm leaving you with this I really am he said Abraham was the greatest man on the earth now I don't know about you but when I read that I'm I looked at it in a manner years ago when I read that I thought the prophet has said this twice in the message I know Abraham's mistakes right I know his failures I know the outcome of what took place but the reason he was the greatest man on the Earth Earth the prophet said it like this was because of the promise he was holding Hallelujah and he who was the greatest man on the earth received a blessing from him that was greater he met MDC and MDC blessed him you know what it did it brought forth there that promise just became more real yes that promise moving in his life it caused him it led him into further decisions in his life that's right yes sir you know you can't look at Abraham's life and say he did this perfect right on the dot God told him to do this he did that God told him to do this he did that you can't read that God told him to leave where he was at in the ear of cdis he still had his daddy with him had a lot with him what brother brandom call it sh every time I read this how about gag he said was a hair in the biscuit I don't like hairs in my food so I know what he's talking about man that that'll ruin the whole meal right there take it take it take it take it take it I don't want to see it no more I don't want to see it don't pull it out take it so when I read that when brother BR said it always brother B said he was always a hair in the biscuit I I that to me it brings it down simple I'm glad God gave simple terms for you and I and he showed us through Abraham's life that you know what God kept working with Abraham he was a great man I don't care if all he did was make two steps he was a great man because God had spoke to him and he had a promise and that promise he took and God would move on his heart he would make more steps Abraham how come you're still got lot around don't you know what God told you to do God knew it was going to be hard for Abraham brother Braham said that was hard to separate from his nephew no doubt the thoughts going on how's he going to make it how's he going to do it how's he brother but God allowed something to take place in order to do what bring the separation let me tell you something if you can look at that and see that to God's care in our life and as God takes and he takes a man that's not born a great man but he's working on that man he's working on that life he's working on your life and my life to bring us to the greatness that matches the promise that's been made by a great God a faithful God and in his greatness came down to the lowest that he might give us the greatest gift that could ever be given the Holy Ghost because through theol H ghost it brings you and I from the New Birth into manhood so I want to leave you with that here this morning Lord willing we will'll pick that up on this of a great man of God but I want to leave you with that they're not born great men but they become great men right amen you might look at you can look at your life right now and say I'm not what I want to be and I'm not what I ought to be but I'm not what I used to be Brother Sam what are you going to do I'm just going to I'm going to submit myself to the glory of the Lord because in his presence we are changed from Glory unto Glory unto glory and you know how he does that he makes you with this glory to be prepared to receive the next Glory that's good that's what he did from day one in creation to day two to day three each day is preparation to sustain the oncoming Glory justification made way for sanctification sanctification made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost has made a way for the person of Jesus Christ himself aren't you thankful oh yes I'm thankful greatest man that ever lived the Lord Jesus Christ and to than that in this hour where it was as in Eden there was a man who was made in the image of God and in that image God made them male and female see that's the completeness yeah within that man was hidden his bride but now in Satan's Eden in Satan's Eden here is a woman on earth here is the bride and in her heart is the hidden man of the heart in her heart in her life he is the center of my life he's my heart so hidden inside of the Bride is the groom oh my what a mystery what a mystery amen oh my footprints on the sands of time men that have went before us Great Men of God let me just say this I don't have to look outside of this room to see Great Men of God to see great women of God look we could take a whole thing on the women of God Ruth Esther maybe God allow us to do that beautiful wonderful careful I say God I want to be all that you've ordained for me to be when brother Brown would use that word real let's go ahead and stand to our feet when he used that word real I look at that carefully how brother Brown would say that he would say a real man when I say I look at that carefully I don't want you to think oh oh that's brother Samuel's int it's not my intuition we're drawn to things by the spirit of God God picks things up to us just like in the scripture you know sometimes you're listening to a message or you're reading a scripture and all of a sudden something just picks up to you like oh this word when brother Bram talks about brother Williams he said oh he said he served a purpose in life he was a real father oh he said he was a real husband he said but the main purpose is that he was gerti by the holy ghost that word real friends the world wants to put that real and all of these things reality there's nothing reality about that there's no reality the only real reality there is is in Christ that's that's the only reality there is that's what's real that's what's true and that's that's what God's desire is for each and every one of us is that we're real Believers real Christians and you can't I can't make myself that that's not that God hasn't left that into our hands but he's given us his word if we can take his word and say be it unto me Lord according to your word and let the word just transform your life let the word brother brand says ask God to put word on top of word in your life until you're there in Christ and then as you're in Christ then God keep adding Lord to my life Lord let me decrease that he might increase God give me Grace I listen friends I got my hands up God give me Grace To Die to myself Lord give me Grace To Die to myself the Bible said he was led to the slaughter as a sheep is dumb before her shearers Lord I want to be more like you yes I want Lord to become I don't want to become a great man in terms of my name is known and oh this man no I Great Men I think that's been established is to have the character of Christ I told my boys we were talking there the other night in Fellowship in the living room I said I want to tell you something I'm not interested my goal is not to be right it's to be correct cuz if that's right that's that's Pride I want to be correct meaning that if there's something out of line I want to be corrected cuz I want to be correct I want to be correct we just having a little bit of Fellowship I I believe that's the part that God calls us to that's a part of maturity listen friends maturity and coming into this as adopted Sons and Daughters of God as we grow into this and the spirit of God making out of you and I Great Men great women if I could say it great people of God and you know what's great is because of the promise promise that we hold in this hour you know what's causing you to make the decision you're making is because the promise that you've received brother BR said that's the reason that Abraham separated from lot was because of the promise he was holding not because he thought he was better than lot he had a promise that was calling in his heart for a deeper separation and that's what takes real men it takes makes real men to be able to stand there and say well Brother Sam I've got it all together that's not what God showed us the greatest man that ever lived in the closing moments of his life he GED himself yes he did and he got down he took the lowest position upon the earth a footwash flunky and he washed their [Music] feet Hallelujah let me tell you friends I believe in signs and miracles if we ever need there's Miracles there's there's there's heal there's things that we have need of we're never beyond that but let me tell you something don't ever minimize what God doing in your life and bringing you into surrender in your life and your character being molded don't ever minimize it that's the greatest Miracle because you can be sick and you'll be healed thank God for that I love to be well but you know what one day this body of God carries this body is going to have to be changed it'll go by the way of the great but that character that's what you take with you that's what you take with you and so when you stand there we stand there on the other side we're going to stand there as Miracles not only miracles now that God brought us out of the world and changed our life but we are going to stand there as miracles in the midst of Satan's Eden God has brought a people into complete submission in their character don't ever let the enemy minimize that in your life that is a son and daughter of God hallelujah who will be greatest Among Us will I be the one will I who's going to be Chief Among Us and Jesus said usually those that are chief are sitting at the table to be served he said and I am among you as one that is serving he showed us what a real man is a real woman showed us what real Christianity is it's not about me how blessed can I be how blessed can I be it's about what can I do for you Lord because remember where God called Abraham I've always loved this Abraham God told Abraham you will be blessed and be a blessing if all that if all that we look for in life is oh how I can be blessed if I go here I'll be blessed if I that's selfish it's about twofold not just to be blessed but to be a blessing amen want to be a [Music] blessing I know you understand what I'm saying if there's one little thing God if there's somebody somewhere along the way somebody with my family I look my family and one another Lord let my life be a blessing how could it be a blessing Lord let me be what you've called me to be help me to be a real man that when situations come up or something that that you correct me on help me Lord to stand there and say Lord I'm wrong I've had the wrong thoughts I've had the wrong feelings I said the wrong thing I said it maybe not the wrong thing but I said it with the wrong Spirit Lord God help me help me Lord help me Lord Jesus amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer father we thank you Lord for your mercy or truly [Music] when you Lord would speak to us on this greatness Lord we don't feel that way about ourselves it's you when we look in our lives we see what you've done Lord God I know that not only in my life but in the lives of my brothers and sisters there were things Lord that I did not know it was a yearning to live for you but I didn't it was something Lord that I thought Lord how do I get out of this I thought Lord it was something that that I would do in My Own Strength I tried that I tried it you never shamed me for it there's a desire within my heart the whole time but Lord you lead us to a place to where Lord we surrender our strength to you Lord the Bible said the glory of young men is their strength the glory Lord of the Aged the old man is the gray hair but father we can't serve you with our strength we can't serve you with our Earthly wisdom we need you [Music] Lord we need you father Lord as your Prophet told us this regarding Abraham what made him the greatest man upon the Earth at that time was not because he was a man without flaws and mistakes and failures it was because of the promise that he was holding in his life it was the promise that made him a great man not as the world as the prophet would recite to us over and over from how Paul would write to the Corinthians what the world calls great you call foolish and what the world calls foolish you call great so Lord You're the example it's what you call great we want to say what you say Name Lord God throughout this building and this congregation here this morning I pray that father that as your spirit Lord would draw Upon Our Hearts and our lives if there's one that's here Lord God that their heart Lord just being further tendered Lord and father where Lord just opening and saying Lord I I want to

they bore the ark and the Ark opened the way God was showing you and I if you put the word first in your life he's a way maker let the word be in Tabernacle deity in your life he'll open the way it
