he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light amen so let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer or Jesus we are just so so thankful Lord that you have given to us the privilege Lord to be able to gather together once again Lord we do not believe that this gathering is in vain this gathering Lord it's not called by man Lord it's been called by you Father and Lord Jesus it's you that were gathered unto and in you Lord I pray this morning Lord as we have come here Lord I pray that God may our hearts Lord just Lord just be settled in you if there be warned that would be outside of the fold of Christ Lord may you just oh god by your ransoming power and Lord this morning draw that heart Lord into a complete submission Lord may every doubt and unbelief and everything be cast aside Lord as you're lifted up Lord God where you set out draw all men unto me Lord we just asked this morning that your great presence Lord would just move among us in a special way Oh God and Lord that this service Oh God would just be by your working Lord a memorial in our hearts and lives Lord may you just have the preeminence Lord and all that said and done Lord and every thought Lord we pray your God may you just Lord now come and just perform your word Lord in our midst this morning Lord take control Lord of speaker and hear together Lord that you might be glorified in the midst of your people Lord we pray your great name Lord that name of the Lord Jesus Christ we thank your Lord for your mercies O God and Lord we just Lord ask all these things now in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen and then God blesses you being seated just before we go here into the scripture I just want to say have little Jonathan Sanchez is going to be baptized here this morning into the service amen amen what a wonderful what a wonderful decision Amen that has been made Amen god bless you Jonathan Amen I also want if I'll try to send out a link here this this coming week here for deceiving perhaps and it will be a link for a service that was over there and brother Paula Fontaine their 30th anniversary that they had I was able to make it over for yesterday morning and then come back and I was so glad that I didn't know who was gonna be speaking and it really didn't matter to me there are friends and different ones I wanted to see and things and support the meeting but brother the reason I want to send you the link for tomorrow for for Saturday morning's message it's because brother Eli and I hope I get the name pronounced brother Eli Ortiz Ortez Ortiz was one of those he spoke and brother Eli is the one who has been over the Spanish translation project where we've received the announcements our our part of it here with assembly has been the supporting of the printing of those books once they've been translated and now once they've been translated they just don't go into print but they go up onto the message hub but then there's also the program that another brother had created that where the ministers are able to go into and anybody can download and search the message brother brother Eli goes into this within brother Eli came into to oversee this within and the translators and you'll hear one of the sisters who just just turning out the books about ten books a month and you know it he goes through all the opposition and things that people were saying and all of this but what you what I want you to would like you to look at as an assembly is that you see how that God has moved where there was such a small capacity that was translated over sixty years and within five years the entire Spanish language is translated entirely and so that right there either says I'm glad I was here this morning because that was exciting to me Amen that that this and that the the message that that I so enjoy is now available and out there in the hands of of the Brethren and you'll hear I just would encourage you to to take in what brother Eli's saying because it's just tremendous what God has been able what he's accomplished through it all so if I sit here and talk about it you won't even listen tonight but I just believe you'll be encouraged within it I also want to say I just had when I was over there and I wanted was gonna go wanted to go and see brother John LaFontaine in the hospital I I just thought you know he's in the hospital wanna go see he he was getting out of the hospital when we were coming out of the service and it just has had where they're gonna put a stent in his kidney because there was some blockage that was there and brother John this is the first time but Carlos it was the first time brother John's ever been in a hospital ever stayed overnight in a hospital so you know you can have a lot of entering in in prayer even for that and because that was something that was entirely different for brother John so I text him here early this morning and just just greeted him let him know we're just we're standing with him and prayer we certainly love and appreciate him the sister Loretta very much and with that being said I want you to remember to take note and the card that we have out there for brother John the fontaine we're going to be sending that here and if you have not wrote a note or some form of encouragement there to brother John how his ministry how its touched you how it has been a blessing to you I would ask you if you would please do that you don't know what an encouragement that is greater than all the medicine that could be out there and you know it's it's it's a part within us I don't want to preach on these things right now because it could but I just trust that you'll just take that right right a little something you don't have to write a novel just just share something if you feel like you need to type it up type it up okay and then just just send it send it to us and we'll get it to brother John would that be okay there's about three of you said Amen well we want to look here in the word for a few moments and I want to looking at this thought there's many things here within the Word of God that just things you know continue to build but there's these the parts that continue to really what's pressing on my heart within this of the word is that our lives would be our lives completely every heart every life my burden for this assembly is every life is fully surrendered and fully filled with the Holy Ghost that's my burden that's always been my labor but it's just something that's just so so within this this is even a part where things that we've been looking at in the Holy Spirit just inspiring it and remember this is not a man's pathway it is God's Way he promised David under inspiration of the Holy Spirit in one of the Psalms that pertained to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ David spoke by the Spirit of God and said he shall make known unto me the paths of life and we understand that that path of life there's not just and there's not multiple paths but there is one God Himself came down when the way had been blocked off because of sin the fellowship was interrupted the man and was was removed from the garden from the what God had created and desired and placed man to be and yet when man could not get back into there God came to man and he said I am the way the truth and the life he became me that I might become him amen to come back into that fellowship as sons and daughters of God again and so when we look at this in the scripture in Ephesians 5 as we we recognize we're talking about light and we're not talking of this natural light that's only a type of the spiritual light with the spiritual light is God's own life and so when we recognize that within this the scripture says you were sometimes darkness you weren't just in darkness we were darkness but now are ye light in the Lord not just in the light but you are light we don't just want to be around like that's that's very that's me for but in order the whole objective is that we would become light in the Lord that our lives would reflect that same life so notice verse 14 where we read from that wherefore he say it so here he's speaking his word he's speaking awake thou that sleepest he is the only one that can raise from the dead and remember when they went to the tomb of Lazarus he told the disciples he's sleeping they didn't understand what he's talking about they thought he's confused but Jesus said so that you understand it he's dead but I'm going to wake him so when the Lord Jesus even in speaking of this verse arise from the dead he is calling what has laid within that life in a dormant dead state but now he's calling that to life that belongs to him and there's only one that can bring this this seed this reality to life in us and that is by the spoken word of Almighty God it takes God who knows his own to call for his own my and this is the promise notice arise from the dead self to be able it is a blessing he that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches it's a blessing to be able to hear his voice because been hearing his voice it gives direction to that inner man to rise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light it's a promise of life he will illuminate your life so now when we look here in the scriptures in Mathew chapter 6 verse 21 the Bible says it like this here is the Lord Jesus is speaking he says for where your treasure is there will your heart be also God doesn't come to deal with your head it wants your heart the message that God has sent never come to turn our heads but it came to turn our hearts for where your treasure is there will your heart be also notice the light of the body is the eye if therefore then I be single thy whole body shall be full of life but if thine eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of darkness and if therefore the light that is in thee be darkness how great is that darkness so it brings us to the reality is there a possibility that one could have so-called light within them but yet that light is darkness this scripture is speaking of the religion not God's not God's salvation this is speaking of man-made religion this is speaking of Satan's working because remember Satan has has even his own ministers that bring his own gospel Paul pulled it out and said they're not lazy they're workers they transform themselves into ministers of light but what does that light do it's a light that says you're okay God loves you you can stay as you are you know God understands and God under in other words what they're saying is God's weak God's puny God can't handle the situations in your life you know God's not able to do what he did before you know God understands this age is such an age where there's so much stuff that's available it that's a that's a gospel it lacks power but the original gospel of Jesus Christ it packs the same transforming power I don't care how wicked or how dark it has the ability to take a life and clean that life up and fill that life and make it a reflection just as he reflected himself through Peter through Paul through all of them through the messenger in this day that gospel has the power of God within it to bring a transformation in a life so we stand here this morning no compromise yes in your heart there's no compromise we don't have to compromise with sin you compromise once you'll be back at the peace table again making treaty talks again you can see that in the natural even over in the Middle East there's still having peace talks we want this settlement we want this settlement well this is not enough this is not enough let me tell you that devil is never satisfied but I can tell you this right here if you come to not just a table but the table of the Lord the altar of the Lord you come to the atonement and the sacrifice that was made for you brother there is a peace that it can be rendered into your heart will there'll never be any more talks anymore it becomes acetylene it becomes an absolute a remover of all doubts he is our peace who had broken down the middle wall of partition verse 24 what admonition no man what's how Jesus breaking this coming bringing this down a little further no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other you cannot serve God and Mammon you can't balance it out you can't live between those two desires and be victorious you have a control tower in your body and you have a control tower in your soul each one has desires desires to satisfy the body the flesh and desire to satisfy the soul and brother Brahm tells us since 1965 in the message thirst he said too many people tried to live between those two desires but the only way that to come into victory and to gain victory is that the God who placed this desire within you that he is allowed and permitted to fully bring it to pass where it's no longer just a desire but now it becomes a living dwelling reality I do only those things which please the father I desire to please him above everything else see it takes him to bring that desire because you and I did not put that desire in us he put that desire and if you can only lonely look at it let God have his way he will bring to pass the word that he has sown in your life because you can't bring it to pass I can't bring it to pass but we can give ourselves over to the Living God oh and the Bible says what a fearful thing it is to fall into the hands of the Living God that were fearful means and all inspiring that which is a great a terrible not terrible in a bad way but terrible from that of the Old Testament it's all inspiring it's just it's beyond what our mind can can see what an awesome thing it is to fall into the hands of the Living God hallelujah no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other else he will hold to the one and despise the other you cannot serve God and Mammon now when we look at this here Paul picks this up in verse in Philippians 2 verse 5 and here is the admonition that Paul by the Spirit would make sure the church let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus he's not talking about this matter up here he's talking about that life who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself I want you to catch this but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men I want to say this clearly Jesus was not made to do what he did he did what he did because he was led by the Holy Ghost he was surrendered this is that what was lost in the fall there were glimpses of this through the prophets but now the glimpses was no longer a light here a light here a light here but now all of those lights had come together to be manifested in the Son of God that this is what that first Adam was and this is what every son and daughter of God is to be no repeat of God hallelujah he made himself how did he make himself he had listened he had the authority as a son of God but remember has the authority as a son of God he also received that of power Dunamis to operate in the position that God had ordained for him to operate in are you with me now so many times we're looking at as a physician as a son of God but remember to operate in that position you must have the life that is promised in order to operate that in our lives when Jesus said I have power that's exclusive I have power to lay my life down I have excuse your power to take it back up again and that word excuse here is right or authority are you with me but then there had to come that of do Toomas which is that power to bring to pass that which is right and authority a position it had to be brought to pass in his life the same way in our life we were always sons and daughters of God but it takes the Dunamis of God to bring in reality the authority that we would have as sons and daughters of God then it makes your worth then you operate as the son and daughter of God Adam said unless melton be plucked up moved over here you come on your job and say Lord you're the one that opened the door and this right here they're staring before me I don't know how you're gonna open this I don't know what's going to take place but I'm gonna look to you I could entertain the seaweed around my head I could entertain the smell of the vile vomit in that of the whale or I can look towards that Holy Temple a son of daughter of God taking Dominion and authority by the power of God that has positioned us as sons and daughters of God to say this is my Mountain [Applause] hallelujah glory be to God oh I love this and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient it is oh Lord I want you to humble me no you humble you how do you humble me we submit ourselves to the word it can go against the grain but when we humble ourselves to the word remember real power is humility I love the statement brother branham makes in humble thyself he says real humility I said for a person that's able to humble themselves yeah that person has more power and authority than the person who'll run all over the building the brand when talking about don't run all over the building you understand what he's saying he said because you have been able to conquer yourself he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross this of obedience there was a contending Hebrews v 7 tells us this there was a war that was going on in Gethsemane but the lamb prevailed Calvary was the manifestation of a battle that had already been won I'm telling you the Bible already declared in Revelation 13:8 the Lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world Isaiah picked up by the Spirit of God in Isaiah 53 he speaks of that offering of the lamb in a past tense measure he was bruised for our iniquity not something that shall be but what has already been but in order for that to take place notice nothing could hinder that or separate that even when those are the Pharisees and the mobs they wanted to lay hands on him and take the Lord Jesus but yet they could not do it until all had been fulfilled that was spoken of him it had to wait until timer fulfillment and let me say this to you as a son and daughter of God there is not one hair of your head can be touched without God permitting it and your life cannot be taken until it's finally fulfilled the purpose of Almighty God hallelujah you know what that brings out of us as believers Lord let me live every moment for your glory I want to hear him say it is well done my good and faithful servant enter into the joys that were prepared for thee before the foundation of the world he humbled himself well wasn't he already predestinated to this moment yes but he humbled himself and he became obedient so the word that was to be fulfilled has the sacrifice he came face to face with that and notice the working of the Holy Spirit in moving there in his life it brought him into complete subjection and expression of the word he was always in subjection to the word but for the word to be made manifest remember he prayed three times nevertheless not my will van will be done because why it was not a man come of God coming down in forcing man out of the Garden of Eden but it was man rather through deception had yielded there to the voice of the enemy and sin had entered so now in order for righteousness to enter there is one is the righteousness of God that would be yielded to the voice of God that righteousness then could now come to the believer and bring us under the blood not just a covering but a blood that's able to divorce and do away with sin we're not just talking about the blood what's to be under this blood oh my he humbled himself I always love the statements brother branham makes and total deliverance he said he could have been a man for he was man but he chose to surrender his natural parts to the spirit that dwelt in him he could have been a man you could choose to be a man or a woman you say that I could choose to be a man or woman let me in this environment maybe I need to correct that wait what would be is that you being a man God made you a man and that's what God intended you to be God didn't make an oops didn't make a mistake what made you a woman that's what he intended you to be now let me clarify that statement you can either live in your five senses down here or you can let God have preeminence in your life and bring out the expression of a son of God inside of the Brethren or a daughter of God in tyneside of the sisters you can surrender your life to him and let him live his own life manifest his own DNA through your life now this these statements here brother Branham will make and I've referred to these in multiple places and when you come into here in the message the Messiah brother Branham will in during this time here in in in in and then 61 but the brandman is moving in here and he is many he's given an example in multiple messages of when God would begin to work in a person's life it's like a little white button and that's when a man would get saved now remember when a man is saved you still have all his habits he's not born again yet but as stir as always habits but then there comes then the saint to find power of the one who draws him and that's the work of the Holy Ghost as well we're not talking about January 1st turning new leaves those don't work they don't work it's only going back to it we're not talking about a Linton that you do for a month we're talking about more than giving up Pepsi and chocolate if you permit me to say it we're talking about a real Lent Linton however you say it we're talking about a reality but it's not something that you're walking around and saying I can't do this but now if there is a change that comes on the inside that says I no longer want to do those things that's what we're talking about now the only way that'll come in the only way the Holy Spirit you see God dealing with alive for him to come in he's got to be welcomed he must be the one that starts dealing with the person now God can start dealing with the person before they ever start coming to church he can start dealing with their lives he can he can start you know dealing with their hearts and many times when we're praying for different needs there's a lot of times we could get discouraged because we seemingly are not seeing godlike results but remember Calvary was a manifestation of a battle one in Gethsemane and that battle was won there where the will was surrendered the only way this can come in is by self-will he cannot the only way that God can even move within a heart is myself will we have to allow him the Bible says he's standing in Revelations 3 he's standing on the outside of the door he's knocking is that right now we understand this he's put out of the church but also remember he knocks on the individual door forgive me I maybe don't have any other it just comes to me right now any other example but I I trust that you receive it sometimes you know it puts out in neighborhoods we got a in back in our neighborhood when we live we got signs and people ignore it says no solicitors allowed sometimes I want to take that sign and just put it in front of my door no solicitors allowed in my answer in red no but we all gotta have patience but notice this God he comes and he comes and knocks on your door it doesn't matter if a person is in a pigpen Jesus will go knock on their door Oh glory Jesus don't know well that's a bad neighborhood I ain't going down there Jesus don't know no bad neighborhoods amen this this life goes to those who sit in darkness hey man he says all I need to do is an if they open that door and they'll let me come in oh my I'll bring a change in their residency hallelujah and he's nothing now he's not he don't that Jesus don't have those big Rams you know them he didn't coming out SWAT team he's not studying the lock let me see honking kick this in that ain't Jesus remember he wants us to serve Him and is that right so now when God comes in to the man brother bran likens it to a little white button starting out and you know as we look at this in the scripture you know there first starts out with a believing knot and listen to me I understand that this is very simple but I don't want you to tune me out this is how the word comes for every need you first must believe brother Branham which that would have the time he would take ffs Bosworth and those other brethren and you say well we don't need their mother brethren we just need a brother Brandon become the platform that is not what brother Graham said as a matter of fact when you begin to look at that with FF Bosworth and you many times you read in his writings its word-for-word the things that brother Branham was declaring about hanging onto your healing because you must know your faith cannot be based on anything other than the Word of God because after the meeting is over with your faith has got to stand on that word and worship in that world and when symptoms trying to come back you stand there and say but God said I've got a right to this promise this belongs to me faith says it is mine how many times brother Branham will talk about oh if we could just have a tent set up here for weeks to teach the people that's Scripture the word is given for instruction in righteousness you have knowledge of what belongs to you is that right blue Graham talks about a woman who was healed but she started feeling all sorts of pains and discomfort symptoms start arising she goes ahead and gets the operation done they open her up find nothing the brem said see if she - only been taught how to hang on to it she was healed hello somebody she was healed oh my that's a whole separate message but it's a principle I said it's a principle our faith must be based on the Word of God not on shifting sands this is why Paul would say for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ the gospel not the word the gospel because now the word that had been spoken and been prophesied has now come to pass remember Paul preached the Sun down there and acts 19 where they knew that Jesus himself he was then indeed is the Christ is that right but Paul had to come to him and let him know he said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed notice since you believed not when you believe when you believe listen in order to believe it takes a work of God your thinking changes concerning the Word of God your thinking a new heart will I give you Ezekiel 37 a new heart a new thinking towards the Word of God that's a work of the Holy Ghost but it's still not the person then it comes I will give you a new spirit which is a saint defying power of Almighty God and you feel listen listen to me now there is an experience when a person turns their heart over to God is that right you feel burdens lifted and yet a person can turn their heart over to God and hear what God has done which is a marvelous thing they still have cigarettes in their life they're still looking at all sorts of things on the internet they're still doing all these other types of things and yet they have believed new art and then I didn't experience my my sins you know it's like when you get up a burden has been lifted but as promised is also I'll give you a new spirit notice I will not you've got to go do this I'll do this they meant God let's just know I'll be the one that cleans up your life I come in there and I'll start kicking out the shorts I'll start taking out the paint off the face I'll start making your conduct and act yourself like a son and daughter go I'll take the earrings out of your ear I'll take the scissors out of your hand come on somebody they're talking about a safety bang power of Almighty God but God said I'll take the high heels off of you come on somebody God said I'll bring a transformation in your life I'll remove you from being a fornicator and an adulterer and I will change your life a new spirit will I give you what brother Samuel I only wear I only wear pants once in a while you first of all the question is have you even given your heart to God well I read the Bible ain't asking you about your religion God don't want your religion God don't want your traditions he don't want your idols I'm asking you have you given your heart to God to believe on him on what he did hallelujah listen friends if we want healing you got to stick with the prescription you got to stick with the prescription if you're going to get amoxicillin and you get that amoxicillin and it's generic but it's more than generic you don't pack within it the punch of that amoxicillin 875 milligrams you got something on the outside that says it got a punch like this on the inside of that pill but yet it don't have 875 milligrams it has been weakened you know what you will not recover but when the prescription Amen that eternal prescription is followed it'll bring the same results a man's sin has been diagnosed and yes diagnosed in every age and the prognosis is always the same Amen oh my for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith as it is written the just shall live by faith now notice Paul would go on in Romans 10 and he would speak about calling upon the name of the Lord verse 13 for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher and how shall they preach except they be sent how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things verse 13 of Ephesians one in whom ye also trusted after that you heard the word of truth somebody say after and whom you trusted after not when after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation you see let me back up here in a moment I just just feel pressed to back up this principle has said moments ago it applies to every promise of God this does not just apply for a person coming in to justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost this remember the baptism of the Holy Ghost is where now the word has gained preeminence in your life but this is the same formula for every promise of God you say what do you mean by that that even the things that pertain to our lives whether it be healing it's things that pertain on how we live and walk in a daily life it must be a scriptural foundation if not we're only hoping it's only well I just found this out this I'll just say this and it'll be that's not how sons and daughters of God operate sons and daughters of God do not operate outside of the word are you with me so it always must be according the word so I say that just feeling pressed of the Lord to say that because sometimes the enemy will try to come in and say oh well this is a this is a foundational message be careful you're not saying that it's more than a foundational message after you've heard the word of truth there's got to be promises got our ministered to us or will never come to them God called Abraham out of the land did he not he made him promises that God rehearses and Genesis 12 right there in those three verses but God keeps preaching to Abraham they're right Paul picks it up in Galatians 3 he preached this gospel unto Abraham what did the preaching do it brought and there was an unfolding by God of what God had called and declared to come to pass in Abraham's life so Abraham would have his faith Abraham's faith wouldn't rest on the Word of God when Abraham in Genesis 18 is sitting in the door of his tent why is he sitting in the door of his tent well brother Simon he just loves to sit there in the door of his tent no no he's sitting in the door of his tent he's looking for somebody he's looking for his coming he's received a promise in Genesis 12 I will visit you courting within the next year I will visit Sarah he knows in order for this to happen there's got to be a visitation does he know how it's going to come no but he's expecting it to come faith is based on the Word of God in whom also after that ye believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit a problem after that you believed after now you know what we spoke here just moments ago out of Matthew there's no room for two in your house nope ain't no room for two and Jesus ain't moving in Jesus will not move in and say you know what what cohabitate I'm greater than the devil I just moved in right there and that ain't how Jesus works Jesus said he's got to be gone he's gotta be gone or goats a mule I feel the blessings of the Lord sure sure you feel the blessings of the Lord but the real blessing is that he would dwell inside of you that this mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus see that's why the mind of Christ cannot be in a life and then life is still drinking and smoking cigarettes and looking at porn and everything else well I'm gonna preach it can't be because the Holy Ghost is not a filthy spirit he's the Holy Spirit now you understand God God is for you God is for us he's calling us to this hallelujah oh my you see somebody's got to move out well let me just say that comes my mind my wife and I we we sold our house we moved into this other house a couple years ago we get mail coming to that house from the people that live there still two years later sometimes it's some serious stuff I think it's serious stuff because they were all into the medical field and I look at things sometimes they've had deliveries and I know it was medicine fortunately the in-laws live down the street I just take it down there and put it in their door say what do you give that example for because there's mail that the mailman you know what he keeps reading 3909 Randolph try 3909 Randolph track 1301 l9 Randolph try and he sticks it in there but on that envelope is not the name of who lives at 3909 that was a name of somebody who used to live there they don't live there no more so when the mailman says oh 39 on that here this is you you look and say milk forward on yep forward on the Samuel temptation comes you look at and said nope not the right name forward off I'll bet if the address you used to do this you used to do that you used to do that direction the man that used to live here did those days but he don't live here no more forward the mail following the mail following the mail there's a new occupant at this address and if you're going to send mail to this address right here it's got to come under the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and if it don't come under the name of Jesus Christ if the word can't aim at it I can't a matter it gets forwarded our t s return to satan there would be to god we chase 'em brother joy I've got so tired of forwarding them mail I enjoy the house and all that but I'm telling you I if I collected the mail for a few months it would be like a trash bag you see what it is not everybody knows they've moved [Applause] but there's a new man in this house that's able to declare there's somebody living here differently and there's the hidden man inside of you glory be to God here will you accept this package nope got live rattlesnakes nope not sign for it not gonna take it they've got time for that I'm not taking it it's not acceptable here oh we've always delivered this mail here you might have in the past but who you delivered it to in the past don't live here no more thank you lord so the Holy Ghost coming in the Spirit of God God working in a life listen through that when a person would believe on the Lord Jesus Christ let me just say what what that means to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ it's to receive and accept his pardoning grace trevor you remember that in an hospital room that day when he came and spoke pardon in grace many of the recipe I remember when he came and he spoke pardon and Gracie let me know I went to Calvary for you you see what what you can do what I couldn't do he went and did for us so where is our faith our faith in is to be placed in him and don't take it back when God calls you and you repented of your sin that's part of the prescription you repent of your sin you recognize I am a transgression brother Samuel I've been raised in this message for all of my life will you need all the more to repent because you've been sitting around where I'll wear the right and the word of truth is you need to repent I don't care if you didn't go out of the world you need to repent when the Pharisees came to John the Baptist he said repent they looked himself in sin more they didn't realize and hear the word the kingdom of heaven is at hand it's a different Kingdom they didn't catch the change there was a transition going on and the word spoken by God was alerting them there is a change taking place oh my the brand would say like this is that if we can just let that spirit grow and take out all the roots of bitterness and press God's way through him again he can be come back in the condition that he was was when he was in the Garden of Eden oh he sent it and we can let this cosmic light because you know we have light in these natural bodies right that's how they get x-rays but if we can let this cosmic light look what he says that it could be pushed to a place to where it's not cosmic light but it's eternal light where God could dwell supremely to do our thinking do our walking you are talking then it's no longer the man it's God in the man another Samuel is that possible oh it's possible a man where God can dwell supremely they men now he's got light life eternal life is the light of God that dwells in the man and if he I love this if he will yield to the spirit more he becomes unmanned sinner like and becomes more godlike if he can what you you but God is calling for you you just let God deals with the heart makes known the realities of Calvary there's an atonement there's one who suffered you walk in that right there you yield to that here God comes moves within that life then God deals with that life one and cleaning it up and you're saying lord sanctify me Lord take these habits and all this Dominion of sin Lord take it out of my life what are you doing you're yielding you're yielding to him what does he do he comes and does what only he can do and then he says I'll put my spirit in you and I'll cause you to keep my word it won't be you anymore it'll be I in you you in me you'll stand at the amazement in your life because it's a paradox the mystery of me working in you that you can't even explain it but you're born of the Spirit of God and lack the wind you cannot tell from whence the wind cometh or whence it goeth these are the depths of God that God has called for Paul would express these depths of God and he would would pray in regards to the whole family in Ephesians 3 he put Paul in verse 14 he would talk about and say for this calls I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith he meant that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth length depth height and to know the love of Christ we heard about that on Thursday night which passeth knowledge then you might be filled with all the fullness of God bro Graham would take these scriptures here and if I'm not mistaken you I think you find even the heading in your Scofield Bible talks about the depths of God and brother Brown would label it that way the depths of God and to remember that there is a depths of Satan in the book of Proverbs you find in the book of Proverbs or her and as she mentioned but it depends on who the her is there's there's two there's two brides in the world there's God's bride Satan's bride that right one of them it says in the book of Proverbs her stairs are the way to hell her access her gates are the gates of hell but then it speaks I believe it's proverbs 7 in another place you'll find all that as you read in the book of Proverbs you'll find where it talks about her and it speaks of a woman and it's dealing with Christ dwelling in the bride of Jesus president says she hath builded a house and her house is built on seven pillars it meant it's a complete dwelling place that God might fully step in we're living in the hour where God had promised I will restore what was there on the day of Pentecost he's been working all the way through that seed of life had to go in the ground it went in the dirt come on now the dirt being the denomination's it went in there but remember that seed is a seed of the original life and he could not stay there it comes back into a place of complete full expression as it was there on the day of Pentecost so the promise of I will restore is where that God himself has laid it out this temple that he would build for his habitation God he could dwell in Luther's in Luther's ministry in justification he could dwell there in the inner life that believe by faith that debt that the Lord Jesus Christ suffered from me but remember Luther still drink and he still smoked but then more light came and here Wesley picks it up by inspiration of God had said there is a sanctifying power in the blood what is it more light is coming so now it's more light is coming what we find we find that of Luther plus more of God Wesley has had to yield he's yielded to that word now here comes to Pentecost faith being restored the gifts being restored what does it do it it's making way to believe in the supernatural because the new birth is supernatural is that right Mary left him at the feast of Pentecost they denied the virgin birth but now they must come back faith Mary type Pentecost there must come back faith in the supernatural for what reason for the new birth where the person of Christ can step fully into his bride and this is the finishing revelations 10-7 the finishing of the mystery of God she's bone of my bone flesh of my flesh laughs of my life there was little glimpses back there and justification and Luther's message the gesture Labov a oh it looks a little more and Saints back a little bit more it's like a picture you know with the Polaroid camera how many remember Polaroid cameras only five of you now remember Polaroid cameras where you take the picture and it comes out I remember my brother got one I thought it was the neatest thing in the world Oh was I here about five or something like that ma'am had been young I'm when I thought it was a neat he he ancestor mean a man they were popping in pictures and we were setting them on the coffee table we were watching here comes here comes it's coming more interview what that's exactly it's God coming more into view and the same way he's done it through the ages is the same way he does it in every son and daughter of God it is him coming into view he is the only one that is in bling hue what's happening Moses ray he's stepping forward we're stepping back he's increasing we are decreasing what's the decreasing it's us submitting to him and he's just stepping to the forefront and then the enemy comes around and wants to pick on us he wants to come he sees us and then we say my Big Brother's here my Big Brother's here the Lord Jesus Christ and he has to take notice to that life that token that blood that's on display that depth of God God's desire brother Branham would place it let me just read this statement when a man experiences the depth of God in his life it is an actual personal experience of the Spirit of God in dwelling and his mind is illuminated by the wisdom and knowledge of God through the word so what does it do it brings you this experience it brings you to the word all along it's calling you to him it's him working all along to bring us into that experience of the word and this is why Satan wants to substitute it he wants to substitute it he wants to belittle it he wants to make light of it he wants to give all other sorts of ways of well all you have to do is just just believe the message is the truth you've got to do more than that well all you got to do is come to a message church you got to do more than that well you got to do is believe that brother Graham is a prophet you got to do a lot more than that you have have to have an experience with Jesus Christ amen thank God for the experience of the new heart where you're thinking change thank God for the change of where he lifts their of sins hold and the habits of this world thank God for that that's a work of God but then that God might come and dwell it's all his work so when it's all said and done God could say you are my personal work my hands have formed you I have called you I have formed the I am thy Redeemer I have brought you to myself you are my workmanship you're not the workmanship of a church you're my workmanship you're my signature addition you're an original creation you're not a reproduction you're not an impersonation you are my masterpiece you love him this morning hallelujah I wasn't he just stop and come back tonight just lock the doors well serve some refreshments and come back you don't have to encourage me very much hey Matt now unto Him infusions three verse 29 unto Him now we're not locking the doors I just let me try to get to a point here and we'll amen let me just verse 20 now and to him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us unto him unto him according to the power that worketh in US red salmon I believe with my heart there's a release and a power remember right now this morning out here we've got automobiles right we don't have their one bicycles out here there wasn't horse and buggy but I tell you what I come to ride the bicycle I was riding one the other day I wish I had a horse and buggy it's a little bit more power you understand what I'm saying a horse and buggy it's it's got within it some power is that right but then when you get into a place of a car a car's got some more power to it right then from a car you go into an airplane that's got more power in it but the horse and buggy had power in it when you get to an astronaut a spaceship it's got a lot of power doing it I mean hey come on now you would think it's funny having somebody riding driving a spaceship down 480 right I know they go that fast but you might you would say man why are they doing a hair drive on it's not built for that that kind of power is built not just to sail around just a few thousand feet in there that kind of power was made to break gravity but there was an advancement of the power and that's the same way it is in your life there's an advancement of power when a person believes on the Lord Jesus Christ there is a power that is present there amen to make it real to you I am saved because of what he has done then you give you give more as he's dealing with your life there's a greater power that comes to do what sanctified amen then there's more power that comes to believe the supernatural then there's more power that comes when he fully steps in now on top of power on top of power don't think before your cars out here today amen I am I sure AM I'm glad I didn't have to come in a horse and buggy today more power aren't you thankful for the power of the Holy Ghost that is available and present and in your life to produce a victorious life now you know while we're on this power subject you can't feed Old Betsy rocket fuel Luther couldn't say Betsy open up I'm gonna put I'm gonna put airplane fuel on you nope had to give him what oh that's what they were able to digest at that time with the advancement of power from the advancement of the diet are you with me when they came into the land they crossed over the Bible says when they crossed over the manna ceased on the morrow and they ate of the old corn that that had went into the ground and come up in full maturity now a resurrection power hello Gloria so there's no way we can take a rapture by eating oats you can't take a rapture with just jet fuel it takes that of rocket fuel and you're with me I'm talking about malachi four promises in the word I'm talking about the evening life promised in the word brother you get that fuel in there brother Greg you put it in there and there's still that the fire of God can ignite that fuel and bring it to pass in your life oh my hallelujah there was a little lady queen of England she they took her into a place and they asked her they showed her these his closet or this bundle of his filthy rags she was at a nerd in a newspaper office they took her in there they say they're showing us she said what's this the guy at the newspaper said oh he said those are filthy rags she said I don't understand he said you will tomorrow remember she said I don't understand he said you will tomorrow the rags were filthy but the rags had to go through a process and be cleaned and once the rags were cleaned tomorrow's news would be printed on those rags I love that don't you brother will tomorrow's news would be written on the tablets I mean on that on the on the newspaper and when the Queen the next day when she looked here she is she sees this paper it's got her image on the front of that paper what she looked at yesterday that was filthy rags [Applause] [Music] it now had her image it had her complete picture and she was reading and looking at herself there have been a picture of her reproduced on what was filthy rags somebody brother David had to gather them filthy rags out of the street that's how God has gathered us he gathered us out of the streets some of us might have been more filthy than others but it didn't matter we all were still filthy but we were gathered into the place where the word becomes flesh we were gathered in a place of one who can take filthy rags and transform him and put his own image to where now he's having fellowship with his attributes his sons and daughters of God where the rest of the world said that ain't nothing but filth is it all but I know what's laying in them I bring him to myself I run him through my cleansing process and when I place my image on them the rags couldn't do it is that right but the rags you and me had to be willing to be picked up had to believe Lord that's what I want I want you I want that image on my life I got this I got that don't look at that look at him if you look at him what it is that you're looking at about giving up giving up this your focus will get off that and you receive power and that will move from your life you with me there sanctifying power in the Lord Jesus Christ as a matter of fact that's the only source I said that's the only source you said what'd I do stay under the way first of all sure into your heart to God if you haven't repent that's first and if you repent it then you stand upon that knowing that God you not dissing not just been an accident but God has called you for a purpose and that life that is drawn on you he wants to put his image on your life but son I can't do it but he can if you'll just yield to him he'll take you through the process and for those that stand as us have Mussa stand as witnesses of how he has taken us through the process he's still transforming us from glory unto glory hallelujah on the front page is that image but you know what when you read a newspaper what do you do you got to open it up and when you're reading the newspaper that on the front it still stands out to everybody but you're starting to read things that are behind it a man is like a book that's unsealed Amen you're feeding your dwelling in the land and Christ is bringing his word to pass now unto him that is able to do a burning bundle II above what we could ask or think according to his power that worketh in US unto Hilma be glory in the church by Jesus Christ amen fellowshipping the mystery of God you love him this morning I'll just say it like this of a song that we are so familiar with and we just stop there turn your eyes on Jesus look full in his wonderful face and the things of this earth will grow strangely dim look at him he has remember like the woman with the issue of blood she had it she tried everything to get rid of that but she said in her heart the Bible said she said within herself you just say that right now if I can but touch the hem of His garment I shall be made whole he did not feel her physical touch but he felt that touch it made contact with him it caused him to stop he was on his way to driver's house who touched said woman thy faith has made thee you've got faith I said you've got faith faith to raise up in that promise of God to accept God to accept what he's already done you've got faith then has forgotten more faith the righteousness of God is revealed from faith in the faith that's God for more faith what's God come with sanctifying power cleansing from all doubt and unbelief that's how it is even with the promise of God for healing it takes God to call us to that promise he calls us to it and then what does he do he brings sanctifying power to remove all doubt and unbelief to where then you're standing right there in that word and said be it unto me according to thy word and he comes and fulfills his word or if I could say it any more plainer this morning he loves you and he wants to do for you what only he can do and what he's done he wants to do more he wants to do more what should I do well first I just surrender to him I'd get my eyes off of all of everything else I put my eyes on Jesus and I look full in his wonderful things I wouldn't try to put nothing else up I just say Lord Jesus Lord I accept you as the musicians would come and play that song turn your eyes upon Jesus amen I want to have prayer for you this morning amen whatever that need is in your life maybe in your life it's to surrender your heart and life to the Lord Jesus Christ this morning let me tell you this is your day this is your day this is the day of salvation it's a day for you to surrender this is a day Amen for the cleansing power of God this is a day Amen for the fullness of God to step in this is our inheritance this is this is our promises you believe that this is our promises hallelujah I want you to sing this song with me turn your eyes a poem [Music] for let your ID symbol

oh wait [Music] that Minister that stands here not only has to be yes I was sitting back there and thinking about the baptism today I was thinking about Jonathan getting baptized and him desiring this for a little while now but I was thinking we were going to baptize it any Church could do what we're doing right now they could map you could repent and you could get baptized in the name of Jesus Christ but the important thing is receiving the baptism of Holy Spirit and you know like I don't believe he's too young I asked him how old he was he said he's 12 my daughter gave her life at 12 and at 16 she received the Holy Ghost and she's still serving the Lord so I believe that we're doing this step and it's not for him just to stand at this point is to desire it they had the baptism the Holy Ghost I remember when I when I came to the Lord and I came to a message church an older pastor preacher told me he says you need the baptism when we go and I thought I had it but I knew but I found out that that was different than what I had received in a denominational Church so I believe now that even as we baptize Jonathan that that promises for him and he he could go forward and got even baptized him now in the Holy Ghost to have that power to live that life so as we we pray father Lord that you bless Jonathan Lord and Lord your promises that he might be received the Holy Ghost the power of the Holy Ghost Lord that his desire his hunger might be holy for you we ask you Lord Jesus as he comes now confessing Lord you into his heart we baptized him now Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ where you're a man praise the Lord glory be to God I want you sing that song you asked me why I'm happy amen let's rejoice amen amen this young man out there ride it and right in the
