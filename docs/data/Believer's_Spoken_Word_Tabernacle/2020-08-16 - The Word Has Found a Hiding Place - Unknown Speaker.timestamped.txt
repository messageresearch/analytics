[40:23] we need you every moment of our life
[40:26] lord
[40:28] your god the longer that we serve you

[40:42] we need you lord in every aspect of our
[40:45] life
[40:47] every decision we don't want to make
[40:48] anything in haste
[40:51] we don't want to do anything lord god

[41:11] would come by your spirit
[41:13] and dissolve any of that callousness
[41:16] lord
[41:16] because truly lord within any heart or

[41:49] then you will take us
[41:50] lord god to whatever the need is lord
[41:53] that's
[41:53] being called for lord from our life lord

[42:02] lord healing of the body you'll take us
[42:04] lord to healing of the body
[42:06] lord jesus you're mindful of every need
[42:10] and we just ask the lord that you would
[42:12] just take control now
[42:14] speak to our hearts lord speak to our
[42:17] lives in a real personal way
[42:19] we love you and we thank you now father
[42:22] in the name of jesus christ
[42:24] amen amen god bless you this morning
[42:28] so good to be in the house of the lord
[42:30] amen we
[42:32] want to just invite you to the word of
[42:33] the lord to
[42:35] um jeremiah chapter 38
[42:39] and it's raining real good outside
[42:44] yeah i say good too i'm tired of seeing
[42:47] brown grass and
[42:48] got a few little bit of some green here
[42:51] and there and
[42:53] and uh i'm grateful for the rain
[42:56] and so um
[43:00] just want to mention to you as you're
[43:02] turning there i ask you just
[43:04] something to keep in prayer here
[43:07] um i just had been
[43:10] texting with brother roel soriano and
[43:15] there is a need and i mentioned that
[43:18] we'd go ahead and take care of a need
[43:21] for a church there in
[43:24] palauan i had met the pastor there last
[43:27] year
[43:29] they actually had to um where they were
[43:33] gathering on a piece of property and you
[43:35] know a lot of those times
[43:37] brother keener you're aware of a lot of
[43:38] those things like that over and there
[43:40] that
[43:40] it's just you you somewhat we call it
[43:43] leasing a piece of property but it's
[43:45] really not
[43:45] leasing over there and then the landlord
[43:48] comes in and finally just says
[43:49] you got to move the church so
[43:53] here was their church they picked it up
[43:57] and walked it down the street
[44:00] so when they walked that church down the
[44:02] street they they found a little place
[44:04] that where they could put as far as like
[44:06] the um
[44:08] the you know the bamboo shoots and where
[44:10] they were holding it
[44:11] and um they took it down there but then
[44:13] the brothers then had to start building
[44:15] um the the footers i guess we would call
[44:18] it
[44:19] to where those could actually sit so
[44:20] that the waters would not come in on the
[44:22] people
[44:23] so um brother roell i
[44:26] i said you know we'll we'll we'll stand
[44:29] behind that because they the government
[44:30] has allowed those brothers to
[44:32] work they can't have service but they're
[44:34] allowed them to work there on the place
[44:36] so the brothers have just been adamantly
[44:38] working
[44:39] and i want you to keep in prayer that
[44:42] and also
[44:43] that just pray and what god would lay on
[44:45] your heart
[44:46] [Music]
[44:48] let's say you know maybe from next
[44:50] weekend and to the next in the final
[44:52] weekend and by the first part of
[44:53] september i'd like to be able to
[44:55] send an offering uh also uh to brother
[44:58] o'ell
[44:59] they've got they've been doing all they
[45:01] can to try to um
[45:04] provide food for different believers
[45:06] that haven't been able to work
[45:07] right out of their local church so i
[45:10] know that
[45:11] we'll try to take care of that and try
[45:14] to help in what we can knowing god can
[45:16] multiply the need amen
[45:18] so let's just look to the lord for that
[45:21] would you do that
[45:22] would you be in prayer so let's just
[45:25] let's just be in prayer
[45:27] for that right there um jeremiah 38
[45:30] verse 7.
[45:34] boy these names always get me but i'm
[45:35] going to try it anyhow
[45:38] now when ebedmaleck the ethiopian
[45:42] one of the eunuchs which was in the
[45:44] king's house heard that they had put
[45:47] jeremiah in the dungeon the king
[45:50] then sitting in the gate of benjamin
[45:54] ibed malek went forth out of the king's
[45:56] house
[45:57] and spake to the king saying my lord the
[46:00] king
[46:01] these men have done evil in all that
[46:03] they have done to jeremiah the prophet
[46:05] whom they have cast into the dungeon and
[46:08] he is like to die for hunger
[46:10] in the place where he is for there's no
[46:13] more bread
[46:14] in the city then the king command
[46:17] commanded
[46:18] uh ebed malec the ethiopians saying
[46:22] take from hence 30 men with thee
[46:26] and take up jeremiah the prophet out of
[46:28] the
[46:29] dungeon before he die
[46:32] now in verse verse 11 i want you to
[46:35] notice something as we
[46:36] start to read this i want you to notice
[46:38] the care
[46:40] that is given to raise the prophet up
[46:44] so ibed malek took the men with him and
[46:47] went into the house
[46:48] of the king under the treasury
[46:52] and took fence old cast
[46:55] clots and old rotten rags
[46:58] isn't it something the prophet's going
[47:01] to be raised by old rotten rags
[47:06] god didn't want new rags god just takes
[47:09] old rags
[47:11] runs them through a process and places
[47:13] his image on it
[47:16] god takes rags that the rest of the
[47:17] world said they're good for nothing
[47:20] god said they'll allow me to be raised
[47:22] in this generation
[47:25] hallelujah he took fence old cast clots
[47:28] and old rotten rags
[47:29] and let them down by cords into the
[47:32] dungeon
[47:32] to jeremiah and a bed melech the
[47:35] ethiopians said unto jeremiah
[47:38] put now these old clots and rotten rags
[47:41] under thine armholes under the cords
[47:45] jeremiah did so so they drew up jeremiah
[47:48] with cords and took him out of the
[47:49] dungeon
[47:50] and jeremiah remained in the court of
[47:53] the prison
[47:53] may god bless you bless the reading of
[47:55] his word as you're being seated
[47:58] i want to
[48:01] just begin to speak to you here just a
[48:04] little bit
[48:05] this morning the word
[48:09] has found a hiding place
[48:13] now in the background of this reading of
[48:17] scripture
[48:18] you're aware that jeremiah a prophet of
[48:22] god
[48:23] and he has been ordained by god
[48:29] to take the word of the lord and to
[48:32] announce
[48:34] to israel that judgment
[48:38] is coming there were men
[48:41] as you read through this on jeremiah
[48:44] there were
[48:45] other prophets who rose up
[48:48] very anointed men saying wonderful
[48:52] things
[48:54] but the reality of it is is they did not
[48:56] have
[48:57] the word of the lord they were wanting
[49:00] to
[49:00] in every one of us every person wants
[49:04] peace and safety but there
[49:08] is no place of peace and safety
[49:11] outside of jesus christ
[49:14] every other place is like quicksand
[49:19] it gives way in the midst of a storm
[49:23] there's only one place that safety that
[49:26] where
[49:27] you can stand and weather the storms and
[49:29] that's to be
[49:30] founded on the rock of
[49:33] jesus christ
[49:36] to where your life is anchored you the
[49:39] storms will come but there's an
[49:41] anchor within your life there the
[49:43] background when we
[49:45] look at this here you find that zedekiah
[49:48] the king
[49:50] uh jeremiah has has spoke by the word of
[49:53] the lord he would seem
[49:54] so contrary to the mind
[49:58] for a man to stay and say
[50:01] uh to israel turn yourself over
[50:05] jeremiah was given by god to tell the
[50:07] people turn yourself
[50:08] over to nebuchadnezzar go out to him
[50:12] and your lives shall be spared you're
[50:14] not going to be able to stay here in
[50:15] this land you see
[50:17] he gets to a spot to where in instead of
[50:20] where the the the people heeding the
[50:23] word of god
[50:24] coming according to god's pathway
[50:28] they they want to remain in their
[50:30] condition and we find this in the nation
[50:32] you
[50:32] you let things start to happen and
[50:35] people will start to get
[50:37] religious they'll get religious for a
[50:40] little time
[50:41] they'll start praying and start reading
[50:43] their bible and
[50:44] start doing all this let me just say
[50:46] this very clearly
[50:47] that in itself without really coming
[50:50] with a real heart to seek the refuge
[50:52] is only idolatry because it
[50:56] it does not release a real anchor
[50:59] and a holding power it's only something
[51:03] to appease
[51:04] the emotion of the individual
[51:07] something more or less like an
[51:09] anesthetic to try to
[51:11] calm them uh from the nervous
[51:14] prostrations
[51:15] but to recognize that here when jeremiah
[51:19] was there think of it hananiah saying
[51:21] peace
[51:21] and safety and everything else and
[51:23] jeremiah said you know what hannah and i
[51:25] how would to god it was like you were
[51:28] saying
[51:30] but jeremiah was inspired by god
[51:33] god was bringing judgment but listen to
[51:35] me now
[51:36] when god brings judgment before judgment
[51:40] ever comes god makes a way
[51:43] of escape amen
[51:46] it's a way of mercy and this
[51:50] this is the reality when jeremiah was
[51:53] standing there
[51:54] he was a sign from god that
[51:57] judgment was on the road but
[52:00] also to the believer where others could
[52:03] look and say
[52:04] oh all this is is doom and gloom and
[52:07] this is why they put
[52:08] jeremiah in the dungeon and the king
[52:11] zedekiah
[52:12] gave them permission put him in the
[52:15] dungeon
[52:16] because the rest of them said we're
[52:18] tired of hearing this
[52:19] this man listen to me closely this man
[52:22] speaks words
[52:23] of treason against the nation of israel
[52:27] but what they failed to recognize was
[52:30] that he looked like
[52:31] he was speaking treason but what he was
[52:34] trying to do
[52:35] he was he was speaking the word and the
[52:37] door
[52:38] of mercy was quickly closing
[52:41] in upon the people these people had the
[52:45] law
[52:46] they had the temple they had they had
[52:48] all of these
[52:49] they had everything they had everything
[52:52] that you could think of
[52:53] but yet god was not with them
[52:58] god doesn't dwell in religion amen
[53:03] religion is of man
[53:07] god don't dwell in religion
[53:10] but god dwells in hearts lives
[53:14] that he has called that he has separated
[53:16] that he has cleaned up
[53:18] for himself because we are his
[53:21] workmanship
[53:23] thank you father what a what a time
[53:27] when here men had cast jeremiah
[53:30] into the dungeon get him out of sight
[53:34] do away with him let me just say very
[53:36] clearly
[53:37] you might try to get the word and the
[53:39] voice of god away from your life but it
[53:42] doesn't
[53:43] kill it it's still there it's either
[53:46] reality even
[53:47] let the word come in and the voice come
[53:50] into your life or it'll meet you at the
[53:52] judgment
[53:54] the voice right even here this morning
[53:56] you either come and let that voice have
[53:58] the right away
[53:59] or this same voice will stand against
[54:02] you at the judgment
[54:03] you heard it but you rejected it
[54:07] it's up to you either put it in the
[54:08] dungeon or say
[54:10] let's raise it out of the dungeon amen
[54:14] let's lift him up either put him away or
[54:16] lift him up
[54:17] yes think of this
[54:21] this was not a jew that lifted him up it
[54:23] was a gentile
[54:25] look how god hiding this in here it was
[54:28] a gentile
[54:29] abomination the ethiopian
[54:32] hallelujah remember it was an ethiopian
[54:36] that that journey there remember here
[54:39] was the queen of sheba
[54:40] she journeyed from where she was went
[54:43] through
[54:44] bandits because she heard
[54:47] god is moving through a vessel
[54:51] in israel you know what she come to see
[54:55] she come to seek god
[54:58] and god was made visible through solomon
[55:01] amen hallelujah she came there was a
[55:04] yearning there was a drawing
[55:06] there wasn't enough priest or excuses or
[55:09] anybody else in her land
[55:10] that could stop her she had heard and
[55:12] faith come about hearing
[55:15] and she went ready ready she went ready
[55:19] to support and get behind if she saw
[55:22] indeed
[55:22] that this was true she was going to give
[55:25] her all
[55:30] what a time i say it's a parallel time
[55:33] right now
[55:37] i say i want to be that a bad man-like
[55:43] i want to be that of badminton
[55:47] you see the bible says in hebrews 1 1
[55:50] god who at sun-dried times and divers
[55:54] manners
[55:54] spake in times past unto the fathers
[55:58] by or the correct in the prophets
[56:01] half in these last days talking about
[56:03] these last 2000 years since the
[56:05] outpouring of the holy ghost
[56:07] spoken unto us by his son
[56:10] whom he hath appointed air of all things
[56:13] by whom also he made the worlds who
[56:16] being the brightness of his glory and
[56:18] the express image of his person
[56:21] and upholding all things by the word of
[56:24] his power
[56:25] when he had by himself purged our sins
[56:28] oh glory
[56:29] set down on the right hand of the
[56:31] majesty on high
[56:33] being made so much better than the
[56:36] angels
[56:36] as he hath by inheritance obtained a
[56:39] more
[56:40] excellent name than they
[56:44] brother uh comes into this prayer
[56:48] in the message the way of a true prophet
[56:50] that he preaches in arizona
[56:52] heavenly father he said speak again
[56:55] roar forth lord with the holy ghost
[56:58] he is the prophet of the hour he's the
[57:02] prophet
[57:02] of the day trying to find his way
[57:06] into the hearts of men and women that he
[57:08] could speak
[57:10] truth notice trying to find
[57:13] his way into the hearts of men and women
[57:16] that he could speak truth remember the
[57:18] holy ghost is the spirit
[57:20] of truth amen amen and he
[57:23] speaks truth through your life
[57:28] i'm so glad he's finding something
[57:31] i pray heavenly father that he will find
[57:33] many in here tonight
[57:34] then he can use someone that's ready to
[57:37] be reverent
[57:38] when they hear the roar of the almighty
[57:41] god go forth by his word
[57:43] judgment is at hand when a lion roars
[57:46] he's coming forth every creature knows
[57:49] he better hide
[57:50] because a king is walking forward god we
[57:53] only
[57:54] have one safety zone when the king
[57:57] of kings roars that's the blood of jesus
[57:59] christ you catch that
[58:01] when the king roars that's the blood of
[58:03] jesus christ
[58:04] let me just tell you something the blood
[58:06] of jesus christ is
[58:07] not diluted like many of the preachers
[58:10] have wanted to make it
[58:12] amen they have made it diluted to where
[58:16] it's just a membership
[58:18] just confess this just just do this
[58:20] little ritual just do this
[58:22] but the blood of jesus christ it came
[58:25] to settle the debt and to deal with that
[58:29] sin
[58:29] nature on the inside i don't care how
[58:33] good you think you are you can never
[58:35] meet god
[58:36] on your goodness the only way you can
[58:38] meet god
[58:39] is through the shed blood of the lamb
[58:43] religious rituals will never do it
[58:46] you've got to know him
[58:47] as the personal god in your life that
[58:50] has changed your life
[58:52] [Music]
[58:56] hallelujah amen it might seem like i'm
[59:00] excited
[59:01] it might seem like i'm rough but if you
[59:03] could only catch it right now
[59:05] i'm letting down old clots i'm letting
[59:07] down old rags
[59:08] it's reference to the word
[59:13] reference to the living god that brings
[59:15] him on the scene
[59:19] oh he says we have a safety zone
[59:23] i pray heavenly father that you'll speak
[59:25] to hearts tonight let them know
[59:27] that they're living in the shadows of
[59:29] the coming of christ
[59:30] when nations are breaking and things are
[59:33] going on
[59:34] what they are yet in your tender mercy
[59:37] look at this we have sinned so much
[59:40] when i read this i see
[59:44] daniel chapter 9. when daniel understood
[59:47] by the books what jeremiah had said
[59:49] he began to repent come on
[59:52] he began to invite the presence of god
[59:55] when i read this i see ezra chapter 9
[59:58] when ezra when god brought him back he
[1:00:00] recognized we deserve
[1:00:02] worse than we've ever got i tell you
[1:00:05] brother god don't owe us one thing
[1:00:08] but we owe him everything we've got amen
[1:00:14] oh my it seemed like you turned your
[1:00:16] back from us and let us go away
[1:00:18] but still as you was back there in eden
[1:00:22] you make a way of estate
[1:00:26] you made a way of escape for noah
[1:00:29] you made one for moses for daniel the
[1:00:32] hebrew children
[1:00:34] you you're constantly making away
[1:00:38] and those who find it they walk in the
[1:00:41] light of god
[1:00:42] and have life those who reject it are
[1:00:45] condemned
[1:00:46] and are cast away i pray heavenly father
[1:00:49] there'll be
[1:00:49] none of those in here tonight that's
[1:00:51] cast away may they
[1:00:53] sweetly hear the roar of god
[1:00:58] the holy spirit speaking down in their
[1:01:00] hearts and saying
[1:01:02] this is i be not afraid
[1:01:05] it's i for we ask it in jesus name
[1:01:09] amen
[1:01:15] where were the rest of the men or the
[1:01:17] people
[1:01:19] when they had gathered around jeremiah
[1:01:22] where were the rest of them
[1:01:24] the rest of the people these princes and
[1:01:28] those that were gathered around the king
[1:01:31] they didn't care how they treated
[1:01:32] jeremiah right
[1:01:35] they didn't care they didn't take great
[1:01:38] precaution and
[1:01:39] lower him down in there they cast him in
[1:01:41] there
[1:01:44] you see many times people don't don't
[1:01:46] take consideration
[1:01:48] of how they're treating the word
[1:01:52] just walk right on by not not even
[1:01:54] having any any reference to the word
[1:01:56] this is why the scripture
[1:01:58] when it speaks of the shaking in in in
[1:02:00] in in hebrews 12
[1:02:02] when it deals with that shaking notice
[1:02:04] the request let
[1:02:06] us have grace whereby we might
[1:02:09] serve him with reverence we want to know
[1:02:13] the places we're walking we want to
[1:02:15] follow
[1:02:16] his leadership think of it the rest of
[1:02:18] them there was no care
[1:02:20] how they put him down in the dungeon but
[1:02:23] here
[1:02:24] if badminton this was not just something
[1:02:26] that a badmilite was you know
[1:02:28] in tune with jeremiah's person no no
[1:02:31] this man recognized
[1:02:33] that jeremiah was the prophet of god
[1:02:36] he had the word of god he was a sign of
[1:02:38] impending judgment
[1:02:40] but he recognized that word finding its
[1:02:42] place
[1:02:43] in my life and me finding safety in
[1:02:46] there
[1:02:46] then i have mercy that's my way of
[1:02:48] escape
[1:02:50] when the rest of them wanted to silence
[1:02:52] that voice
[1:02:53] it begged me like that voice was in him
[1:02:55] and above my left said
[1:02:57] let's raise jeremiah up out of this
[1:03:00] dungeon amen
[1:03:02] let me just tell you right now this
[1:03:04] morning this message though the
[1:03:06] messenger
[1:03:07] has gone off the scene but the same
[1:03:09] angel the lord
[1:03:11] the same prophet of god that anointed
[1:03:14] the prophet of god in this hour
[1:03:16] that same one is here that same mighty
[1:03:19] angel
[1:03:20] that same living god he's the same
[1:03:22] yesterday
[1:03:23] today and forever i
[1:03:27] say this morning don't let it be in a
[1:03:28] dungeon just don't let it be in a fight
[1:03:31] show
[1:03:31] but let's raise him to a place of
[1:03:35] preeminence in our lives
[1:03:38] let him be raised
[1:03:44] that's what he wants he specializes
[1:03:48] in taking lies that are ruled and cast
[1:03:51] out
[1:03:51] and the rest of the world said to
[1:03:53] nothing but dirty rags
[1:03:55] but he said you let me have them rags
[1:03:57] i'll take them through my process
[1:03:59] of justification sanctification and then
[1:04:02] i'll put my image on them
[1:04:05] [Applause]
[1:04:06] my word i will display in a life that
[1:04:09] was an outcast
[1:04:11] that was not to be rotten but i'll
[1:04:13] display
[1:04:14] my image
[1:04:16] [Applause]
[1:04:24] they could have lifted him with jets the
[1:04:26] cords but it would have
[1:04:28] it would have hurt him but the
[1:04:31] delicateness notice
[1:04:32] about alex said jeremiah you take these
[1:04:35] rags and these clouds
[1:04:36] put them under your arms then
[1:04:40] you put the cords notice jeremiah's not
[1:04:42] telling him what to do
[1:04:44] this is his own reference to the word
[1:04:48] his reverence and approach he's saying
[1:04:50] put it right here
[1:04:52] because we're come to get you out of
[1:04:53] here we'll come to lift you up let me
[1:04:55] just tell you something
[1:04:57] he's still the same yesterday today and
[1:04:59] forever
[1:05:01] when elisha and gahesa were standing
[1:05:03] there and they were encompassed about
[1:05:05] with the syrian army
[1:05:06] remember the angels of god were always
[1:05:09] there
[1:05:10] they were always there elisha didn't
[1:05:13] bring the angels on the scene
[1:05:14] but what he did by being in contact with
[1:05:17] god
[1:05:18] having the word of god he could pray an
[1:05:20] intercessory prayer
[1:05:22] that would allow the eyes of gehesa to
[1:05:24] break out of the visible
[1:05:26] and see what is the invisible oh glory
[1:05:29] be to god i think of it right now
[1:05:31] the god that i'm talking about he's not
[1:05:34] way out there a million miles that god
[1:05:36] is right here
[1:05:37] in this building this morning he's right
[1:05:40] here
[1:05:40] parts of him have been subdivided and
[1:05:43] he's living out his life
[1:05:45] inside of sons and daughters that have
[1:05:47] surrendered their life
[1:05:49] that he might be raised in power and
[1:05:52] authority
[1:05:53] amen
[1:05:56] now this man's name is
[1:06:00] it means servant of the king
[1:06:04] now there's no doubt about it he had an
[1:06:05] audience with zedekiah think about
[1:06:08] how he would place his life by going to
[1:06:10] zedekiah
[1:06:11] zedekiah had already said scriptures on
[1:06:14] up above where we started reading
[1:06:16] zedekiah was the one that also told the
[1:06:17] princes when the princess said let's get
[1:06:20] rid of him man
[1:06:21] all he's talking is treason and stuff we
[1:06:23] don't want to hear it no more and
[1:06:24] zedekiah says well go ahead
[1:06:25] if y'all go ahead you all want to do it
[1:06:27] do what do whatever you want to do with
[1:06:28] him you see zedekiah was a man it was
[1:06:30] spoke of israel listen to me
[1:06:32] it spoke of the lastness and the
[1:06:35] looseness within israel
[1:06:36] this man was a wishy-washy he didn't
[1:06:39] have any place to stand
[1:06:40] he was the same way that ahab was and
[1:06:43] the rest of them well i don't know
[1:06:45] whatever you want to do
[1:06:46] with them when a bed millet came and
[1:06:48] abandoned like say hey they cast
[1:06:49] jeremiah down there
[1:06:50] we need to raise him up he's going to
[1:06:52] die of hunger and he said well
[1:06:54] you know you you can do it i do take
[1:06:56] take take 30 men
[1:06:57] do whatever you want he wasn't willing
[1:06:59] to make a stand
[1:07:00] to commit either way brother and sister
[1:07:03] if you try to live between two different
[1:07:05] desires
[1:07:06] there's a desire within you that you
[1:07:08] want to serve god
[1:07:09] but yet there's another desire that's
[1:07:12] out here in your life
[1:07:13] that saying that's trying to call
[1:07:14] against it what must i do
[1:07:16] you must stop living between the two
[1:07:20] desires and let the desire on the inside
[1:07:23] say god raise up the daughter of god in
[1:07:26] me
[1:07:27] raise up the son of god in me
[1:07:31] amen
[1:07:34] he was a servant of more than just
[1:07:37] zedekiah
[1:07:38] he was a servant of the king
[1:07:42] amen well the rest of them didn't want
[1:07:44] to hear jeremiah
[1:07:46] i don't hear what he's got to say that
[1:07:48] man don't speak nothing he don't say
[1:07:49] nothing about positive about the stock
[1:07:51] market
[1:07:52] he don't say nothing positive about
[1:07:54] what's going to happen i don't want to
[1:07:55] hear that man
[1:07:56] you realize spirits don't die people do
[1:07:59] spirits don't die same thing when the
[1:08:02] prophet of god was here
[1:08:03] it's come right around right in churches
[1:08:05] and everything else
[1:08:06] people get tired of hearing where
[1:08:08] they're living at let me just tell you
[1:08:09] right now
[1:08:10] as a preacher i do not delight in
[1:08:13] getting down
[1:08:13] and beginning to preach on those things
[1:08:15] and rebuke and correct but i do it
[1:08:18] because of my zeal and desire to please
[1:08:21] him
[1:08:21] and to serve his people you see there's
[1:08:24] something in you glory be to god
[1:08:26] that you maybe can't even see in your
[1:08:28] life but the holy spirit
[1:08:30] that would be pulsating through my heart
[1:08:32] and delivering the word
[1:08:33] he sees a son and daughter of god if you
[1:08:36] only give him the right away brother
[1:08:38] he will lead you into the place of
[1:08:41] safety and rest
[1:08:45] let him sweetly roar
[1:08:50] that's almost seems like irony sweetly
[1:08:52] roar
[1:08:56] when's the last time you would ever hear
[1:08:57] a lion and say whoo that was a sweet
[1:08:59] roar
[1:09:02] how could one be how could it be a
[1:09:04] sweetly roar it's because
[1:09:06] the roar he's coming forth to claim what
[1:09:08] belongs to him
[1:09:10] the sweetness is he comes to call
[1:09:13] his sons and daughters the roar is to
[1:09:16] let that first nature know
[1:09:18] you better let them go the roar
[1:09:22] is to let them know let my son go that
[1:09:24] they might serve me
[1:09:27] isn't that a paradox now notice this
[1:09:31] here
[1:09:31] in john chapter 3 the lord jesus
[1:09:34] speaking of
[1:09:35] his his death and burial resurrection as
[1:09:39] moses lifted up the serpent
[1:09:40] in the wilderness even so must the son
[1:09:42] of man be lifted up that whosoever
[1:09:44] believeth
[1:09:45] in him should not perish but have
[1:09:48] eternal life notice the key is not
[1:09:50] believe on him
[1:09:52] believe in him if you believed on him
[1:09:55] that's wonderful but let it become
[1:09:58] deeper
[1:09:58] in your life to where you actually
[1:10:01] receive
[1:10:02] the power of god in your soul to change
[1:10:05] you
[1:10:08] oh my for god so loved the world that he
[1:10:11] gave his only begotten son that
[1:10:12] whosoever believeth in him
[1:10:13] should not perish but have everlasting
[1:10:15] life for god sent not his son into the
[1:10:18] world to condemn the world
[1:10:19] but that the world through him might be
[1:10:22] saved
[1:10:22] in john 12 31 now is the judgment of
[1:10:26] this world
[1:10:27] house and now shall the prince of this
[1:10:30] world be cast out
[1:10:32] now think of this this is such a great
[1:10:35] the great event that is taking place
[1:10:38] in that of the crucifixion we're in that
[1:10:41] the lord jesus himself
[1:10:42] is actually through him by the
[1:10:44] righteousness of god's own life here he
[1:10:47] has
[1:10:47] he's taken his own laws upon himself and
[1:10:50] he's now
[1:10:51] getting ready to go pay the sin that
[1:10:54] every claim
[1:10:55] that the enemy had upon us where the
[1:10:57] enemy had liens upon our soul
[1:10:59] and the enemy said no you can't touch
[1:11:01] them right now they cannot receive that
[1:11:03] right now
[1:11:04] but yet god and himself coming down he's
[1:11:07] the only one that could pay the price
[1:11:09] and remember when he's talking about the
[1:11:11] world he's not talking about the earth
[1:11:13] he's talking about the system that's
[1:11:16] upon the earth
[1:11:17] because the earth itself it shall be
[1:11:20] fully redeemed just as he has
[1:11:24] fully redeemed you and i by his spirit
[1:11:27] and taken us through the same process so
[1:11:29] notice the judgment
[1:11:31] of this world now shall the prince of
[1:11:34] this world be cast out let me just tell
[1:11:36] you right now
[1:11:37] the casting out of this prince even
[1:11:39] though he's the prince of power of the
[1:11:40] air
[1:11:41] he's over every nation he's over every
[1:11:43] government
[1:11:44] he's in control of every kingdom the
[1:11:46] kingdoms of this world
[1:11:47] have not become the cri the lords and
[1:11:49] his christ it has not happened
[1:11:51] that'll be in the millennium after the
[1:11:53] stone has smoked the image in the feet
[1:11:55] but in the meantime he is over that of
[1:11:58] the world but to faith
[1:12:00] of the grace of almighty god that god
[1:12:03] would move down
[1:12:04] through him by a divine unction and
[1:12:06] deliverance
[1:12:07] of his spirit through the blood and
[1:12:09] would absolutely
[1:12:10] cast satan out of your life
[1:12:14] that's a paradox how that god himself
[1:12:17] where satan came down in eden and
[1:12:20] spoiled one of god's daughters
[1:12:22] he got a hold of that woman at the well
[1:12:24] and noticed here she had been
[1:12:26] six husband and living with a man one
[1:12:28] even her own husband
[1:12:29] she had all kinds of scruples and
[1:12:31] troubles in her life glory be to god
[1:12:33] she was an old clot an old rag that
[1:12:36] nobody wanted around
[1:12:37] she had to go out to the well at a
[1:12:39] different time but
[1:12:40] jesus knew what was beneath him on rags
[1:12:44] jesus himself came right down in the
[1:12:47] midst of satan's eden
[1:12:48] and by his word he changed her life
[1:12:52] brother she went away from that well she
[1:12:55] did not go away from their first thing
[1:12:58] anymore she had found that
[1:13:01] which satisfied
[1:13:04] [Music]
[1:13:08] and i look at this if i be lifted up
[1:13:11] from the earth
[1:13:13] i will draw an inward impelling
[1:13:16] oh men unto me this he said signifying
[1:13:20] what death he should die
[1:13:22] now think about his death
[1:13:26] it's so stumped the enemy
[1:13:30] think how brother brown would dramatize
[1:13:31] it how that the lord jesus
[1:13:34] he said walking up the hill carrying the
[1:13:36] cross
[1:13:37] he said the devil was even looking and
[1:13:39] saying can't be him
[1:13:42] the graham said where they had strapped
[1:13:43] him on his back the blood
[1:13:46] spots begin to get bigger
[1:13:49] and bigger and he said the devil sat
[1:13:52] there and looked and said
[1:13:54] this man can't be the son of god
[1:13:57] hallelujah listen to me a son of god
[1:14:00] wouldn't put up with that
[1:14:04] but you see the enemy look at the enemy
[1:14:07] is always seeking
[1:14:09] to escape submission
[1:14:12] surrender and suffering
[1:14:15] any way he can dodge it listen to me now
[1:14:18] even jesus himself prayed to dodge
[1:14:22] the cross that's a direct quote souls in
[1:14:26] prison now
[1:14:26] he prayed if it be possible let this cut
[1:14:29] pass for me why
[1:14:30] this guy right here this humanity
[1:14:33] there's not one of you would sign up and
[1:14:35] say
[1:14:35] hey you know what i ain't had a trial
[1:14:37] one in a while i think you know what man
[1:14:39] i ain't had nothing in my house
[1:14:40] you know what god why and i didn't
[1:14:41] cancel like the rest of you're an idiot
[1:14:43] if you think that way
[1:14:45] oh god forgive me but you understand
[1:14:46] what i'm saying i mean you're crazy for
[1:14:48] thinking something that way
[1:14:50] you go to start inviting things and
[1:14:51] signing up for it now i had nothing a
[1:14:53] long time
[1:14:54] i don't want to talk that way because
[1:14:56] what i'm looking for
[1:14:57] god knows what grace that i have made up
[1:14:59] he knows the tests the trials
[1:15:01] that need to come my way to mold me and
[1:15:03] to shape me and i'm dependent on him
[1:15:05] because when a test or trial comes
[1:15:07] brother i need his grace
[1:15:10] i need his grace amen to make it through
[1:15:14] day by day so when we look at this
[1:15:18] oh my so when we look at this of how
[1:15:21] that it would be placed here
[1:15:22] notice how that in the submission and
[1:15:26] the humility
[1:15:27] i think how paul said it he was
[1:15:28] crucified in weakness
[1:15:30] but he was raised in power the only way
[1:15:34] he could ever be raised in power
[1:15:36] you know quickly we'd want to jump to
[1:15:38] the resurrection you know it's amazing
[1:15:39] many times when we talk about that
[1:15:41] even during easter time or any at any
[1:15:43] time of the year many times it is
[1:15:45] done away with or not even dealt with of
[1:15:47] how that he would deposit
[1:15:49] and unload the unload the sin dead in
[1:15:52] the lowest parts of hell
[1:15:53] and what he would do down there before
[1:15:55] ascending up now remember
[1:15:57] a lot of times we want to move to the
[1:15:59] ascension but remember
[1:16:00] before the ascension out of hell and
[1:16:03] then defeating death
[1:16:05] hell and the grave satan's trinity he
[1:16:08] first
[1:16:08] had to be a surrender of his own will
[1:16:12] to the will of god
[1:16:15] you see power is not something that's
[1:16:18] added to us power
[1:16:20] is what we receive when we surrender
[1:16:24] amen now notice this in isaiah 11
[1:16:27] 10 and in that day there shall be a root
[1:16:31] of jesse which shall stand for
[1:16:34] an inside of the people notice
[1:16:37] for an end sign and an ensign is a
[1:16:40] rallying point
[1:16:43] like many of you know the flags and
[1:16:45] things like that
[1:16:47] i think uh my my father-in-law just got
[1:16:51] zachary one of those calvary flags and
[1:16:53] he's out there in the yard you know with
[1:16:54] his
[1:16:55] uh get up on his calvary get up and he's
[1:16:58] walking around with that you know and
[1:17:00] his bayonets and everything else and
[1:17:02] he's walking around with it you know
[1:17:03] dramatizing it
[1:17:04] acting it out you realize those flags
[1:17:07] itself every one of those flags just
[1:17:08] like
[1:17:09] there were standards in that of israel
[1:17:11] every tribe had a standard is that right
[1:17:14] and the standard at that time in the
[1:17:16] standard it was a rallying point
[1:17:18] when they would go into war you know
[1:17:20] many times let's say brother joy was the
[1:17:22] general
[1:17:22] and here i am just the private that's
[1:17:24] fighting and brother joe you know
[1:17:26] is is there well wherever brother joey
[1:17:27] is at if he's over top of
[1:17:29] the platoon or the regiment that i'm in
[1:17:31] that that that standard armor bearer is
[1:17:34] going to be very close to you
[1:17:35] and so when i want to know what's going
[1:17:37] on i'm not going to be able to hear so
[1:17:39] much his voice
[1:17:40] but i am going to have something that i
[1:17:42] can look at and what i'm looking at
[1:17:45] it will tell me the direction that the
[1:17:47] battle
[1:17:48] is actually going and so god himself
[1:17:51] would so condemn sin that there would be
[1:17:54] an
[1:17:55] ensign given to the people and that
[1:17:57] inside would be that
[1:17:59] of his own life that through him by the
[1:18:02] shed blood
[1:18:02] that there would be an insight of the
[1:18:04] people to it the gentiles shall seek
[1:18:07] and his rest shall be glorious
[1:18:11] so it would be an enzyme that is lifted
[1:18:13] up now that out there
[1:18:15] you know you could look at that and say
[1:18:16] well let me see where's the battle going
[1:18:18] and maybe you got turned around
[1:18:19] anybody ever get turned around sometimes
[1:18:22] oh yeah
[1:18:22] sometimes you know i've got turned
[1:18:24] around i've been hunting in the woods
[1:18:25] and i'm telling you what somebody come
[1:18:26] to me and said
[1:18:27] no you're going the wrong way no sarah i
[1:18:29] know it's where i walked in but my
[1:18:31] bearings got turned around on me
[1:18:33] but you see there's always something
[1:18:34] that i can look at
[1:18:36] in that inside that standard that'll
[1:18:38] help me get back on track
[1:18:40] you know let me know what is actually
[1:18:42] taking place let me just say this to you
[1:18:44] the inside itself that was lifted up in
[1:18:47] this generation
[1:18:48] is jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:18:52] and forever
[1:18:52] and the very reality of god is that that
[1:18:55] ensign
[1:18:56] is so lifted in the hearts and lives of
[1:18:59] the believer
[1:19:00] to where even in your spirit your mind
[1:19:03] your body
[1:19:04] then you maybe just feel like man i'm
[1:19:06] getting all turned around but there's an
[1:19:08] enzyme on the inside of your soul if
[1:19:10] you've been sealed
[1:19:12] by the baptism of the holy ghost there's
[1:19:14] a standard
[1:19:15] in your life brother there's a display
[1:19:18] that's in your life there's a token
[1:19:20] that's on display when the battle gets
[1:19:24] thick
[1:19:25] and the battle gets hot oh this brother
[1:19:27] just had this diagnosis
[1:19:28] or this just was said to this sister or
[1:19:30] this is said to this one and you know
[1:19:32] what
[1:19:32] they could lay down they could retreat
[1:19:34] but there is one
[1:19:36] on the inside of them that knows no
[1:19:38] retreat
[1:19:39] he's met every devil he's conquered
[1:19:41] every devil
[1:19:42] and that inside on the inside brother
[1:19:45] don't you realize greater
[1:19:47] is he that is in you then he that's in
[1:19:50] the world
[1:19:51] [Applause]
[1:19:52] the inside of his life
[1:19:56] to where the rest of the world would
[1:19:58] cave but god said
[1:20:00] i'll let my standard be reflected in
[1:20:02] your life
[1:20:04] well the rest of the people want to
[1:20:06] dress and the women want to dress the
[1:20:08] way they do and
[1:20:08] men want to go off and be sissies like
[1:20:10] that and they want to go about their way
[1:20:12] but i'll take a little handmaid i'll
[1:20:14] take i'll take one of my sons
[1:20:16] and i will reflect the standard of what
[1:20:18] a son and daughter of god is
[1:20:20] and god will take standards he will take
[1:20:23] lives
[1:20:24] that the rest of the world says that's
[1:20:26] an old rag
[1:20:27] what are you going to do with that old
[1:20:28] clot i mean it's been tucked away
[1:20:31] look at it it's done lived its life but
[1:20:33] god says oh no
[1:20:34] when it gets into my hand it's able to
[1:20:37] be able
[1:20:38] to lift the standard of the word in that
[1:20:44] life
[1:20:47] isaiah 53.
[1:20:53] you see we read in hebrews 1
[1:20:58] that he upholds all things by the word
[1:21:01] of his power
[1:21:02] do you realize as he has watched over
[1:21:06] your life
[1:21:07] and my life even before we knew what was
[1:21:09] going on
[1:21:12] there was nothing could touch our lives
[1:21:16] nothing could take us
[1:21:20] because we had to come and be thoroughly
[1:21:24] redeemed amen there's no doubt about it
[1:21:28] about your life or my life there's
[1:21:30] probably little things
[1:21:32] that little things that god has shown
[1:21:33] something that the enemy picked up on
[1:21:36] maybe it prevented you from death maybe
[1:21:39] your mom
[1:21:40] it was not supposed to even carry you to
[1:21:42] full term
[1:21:44] you don't know what one the the way
[1:21:46] somehow that the enemy would have looked
[1:21:48] upon that
[1:21:49] and then would have been after that life
[1:21:51] the enemy loves to do nothing i'm
[1:21:53] preaching this morning
[1:21:54] the enemy loves to do nothing more than
[1:21:57] to try to scar
[1:21:58] lives he likes to try to put scars on
[1:22:03] lies
[1:22:04] to where those scars stand out more to
[1:22:07] the individual
[1:22:08] and they stand there as a well god won't
[1:22:11] have nothing to do with me
[1:22:13] what could be about my life but let me
[1:22:14] just tell you something in the presence
[1:22:16] of god
[1:22:17] this is more than a man speaking to you
[1:22:20] in the presence of god
[1:22:22] god knows what's down on the inside of
[1:22:24] you he's not trying to raise up that
[1:22:26] character
[1:22:27] that did this and did that and lived in
[1:22:30] the world
[1:22:31] under the influence of darkness that
[1:22:32] ain't what god come to redeem
[1:22:34] he come to redeem that seed on the
[1:22:36] inside that's laid there as a
[1:22:38] dormant seed of god and god is the only
[1:22:42] one
[1:22:42] that can call that seed forth
[1:22:46] man speaking can make you feel good but
[1:22:49] the spirit of god
[1:22:51] is what makes you aware there's
[1:22:52] something more there's something more
[1:22:55] this is what i've been longing for this
[1:22:57] is the desire in my life
[1:22:59] what is it he's calling forth what the
[1:23:01] world said is an old rag
[1:23:03] it's an old cloth who want anything to
[1:23:05] do if they have and he says there's
[1:23:07] something beneath that darkness that
[1:23:10] belongs to me
[1:23:20] then our lives brother joey are if his
[1:23:23] word are being us
[1:23:25] and we are in him then brother brian we
[1:23:28] are upheld
[1:23:29] by the word of his power brother samuel

[1:23:36] you can't can't you you can't how can
[1:23:38] you quit
[1:23:39] something you didn't start
[1:23:45] sure you do brother i feel like queen
[1:23:47] what's that mean that you're like the
[1:23:48] rest of us
[1:23:51] you're dwelling in a human body but let
[1:23:53] me just tell you something
[1:23:54] what must i do keep putting down
[1:23:56] footprints every time that god is
[1:23:58] dwelling with you dealing with your life
[1:24:00] put down another footprint what am i
[1:24:02] doing you're raising him
[1:24:04] up out of the dungeon brother little by
[1:24:06] little you might walk out of here this
[1:24:08] morning and people say
[1:24:10] i don't see jeremiah i don't see jesus
[1:24:12] raised up
[1:24:13] i don't see the living god on display
[1:24:15] but what they don't know
[1:24:16] there's a raisin going up as you're
[1:24:19] letting down
[1:24:21] he's being raised up and as you keep
[1:24:25] raising him up
[1:24:26] eventually they'll begin to mistake you
[1:24:29] for him
[1:24:30] [Applause]
[1:24:31] [Music]
[1:24:34] glory be to god isaiah 53 1
[1:24:38] who hath believed our report
[1:24:42] and to whom is the arm of the lord
[1:24:43] revealed for he shall grow up before him
[1:24:46] as a tender plant and as a root
[1:24:50] out of dry ground see this is one this
[1:24:52] is where the problem was
[1:24:54] this is where the problem was or is in a
[1:24:57] life
[1:24:58] it's with the root now you cut something
[1:25:00] back to the root guess what it's going
[1:25:02] to keep then we'll come back out again
[1:25:04] but if you ever deal with the root of
[1:25:06] the problem
[1:25:08] amen hallelujah you ever get that life
[1:25:10] and it quickens that seed
[1:25:12] out comes the root first glory
[1:25:15] and that right brother aaron now comes
[1:25:17] the root first notice this now
[1:25:19] he hath no form nor comeliness
[1:25:23] and when we shall see him there's no
[1:25:26] beauty we should desire him
[1:25:29] you know what this is doing it does away
[1:25:31] with the christian bookstore jesus
[1:25:35] has just a beautiful complexion that
[1:25:37] could be on the front of gq or whatever
[1:25:39] cosmo or whatever it is
[1:25:40] no no no no this was no beauty that we
[1:25:43] should desire him
[1:25:45] think about that what that means to you
[1:25:46] and i that means a lot to me
[1:25:49] but how that he himself he did not come
[1:25:51] being some great
[1:25:52] looking person that oh my goodness this
[1:25:55] is
[1:25:55] gq this is the man no he chose
[1:25:58] to come poor weak
[1:26:02] and lowly showing us
[1:26:06] it does not take the greatness of man
[1:26:09] but the greatness of god is so great
[1:26:11] this is
[1:26:12] real greatness what is real greatness is
[1:26:15] he could come in
[1:26:20] such
[1:26:25] look at this he is
[1:26:29] still not will be this is present tense
[1:26:33] he is despised
[1:26:36] and rejected amen amen
[1:26:39] many people can look back to a jesus of
[1:26:42] 2000 years ago
[1:26:44] but when it gets down to that same jesus
[1:26:46] is living in flesh
[1:26:48] and he wants to dwell behind your life
[1:26:50] that begins to touch on their life
[1:26:54] he is despised and rejected of men
[1:26:57] a man of sorrows acquainted
[1:27:01] with grief and we hid as it were our
[1:27:03] faces from him
[1:27:05] he was despised and we esteemed him not
[1:27:11] raytel why is he doing all this
[1:27:18] are you with me he who is higher than
[1:27:21] the heavens
[1:27:24] the bible would say in the book of
[1:27:25] isaiah sitteth on the circle of the
[1:27:27] earth
[1:27:28] he that is the greatness the king of
[1:27:30] glory
[1:27:31] would come down and stoop
[1:27:35] so low
[1:27:38] he's our example amen
[1:27:42] surely he hath borne our griefs and
[1:27:46] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[1:27:48] him stricken smitten of god and
[1:27:50] afflicted
[1:27:50] but he was wounded for our
[1:27:53] transgressions
[1:27:55] he was bruised for our iniquities
[1:27:59] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[1:28:01] him and with his stripes
[1:28:03] we are healed all we like sheep
[1:28:07] hath gone astray sheep need a shepherd
[1:28:12] all we like sheep have gone astray we
[1:28:14] have turned everyone
[1:28:17] to his own way
[1:28:20] all right all right this is the real
[1:28:22] culprit right here
[1:28:25] self and the lord hath laid on him
[1:28:28] the iniquity of the song
[1:28:32] what love is this before we were ever
[1:28:36] born
[1:28:37] he already paid the price
[1:28:40] in the mind of god before adam's
[1:28:43] standard molecule
[1:28:44] the lamb was slain
[1:28:47] [Applause]
[1:28:50] this is an unfolding of a drama of
[1:28:53] redemptive
[1:28:54] love
[1:28:59] he was oppressed yes
[1:29:02] he was afflicted yet he opened not his
[1:29:06] mouth
[1:29:08] he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter
[1:29:10] and as a sheep before her shears is done
[1:29:13] so he opened not his mouth he was taken
[1:29:16] from prison
[1:29:17] and from judgment and who shall declare
[1:29:19] his generation
[1:29:21] for he was cut off from the land of the
[1:29:23] living
[1:29:24] for the transgression of my people was
[1:29:26] he stricken
[1:29:28] he was cut off
[1:29:31] 33 and a half years old
[1:29:36] was cut off
[1:29:40] his life was offered up a lamb
[1:29:44] a lamb
[1:29:48] you didn't die of old age he could have
[1:29:50] but it wouldn't have paid the price
[1:29:54] it had to be a lamb
[1:30:00] and he made his grave with the wicked
[1:30:03] and with the rich in his death because
[1:30:05] he had done no violence neither was any
[1:30:07] deceit in his mouth
[1:30:08] yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he
[1:30:11] hath put him to grief
[1:30:13] when thou shalt make his soul an
[1:30:15] offering for sin he shall see his seed
[1:30:18] he shall prolong his days and the
[1:30:21] pleasure
[1:30:22] of the lord shall prosper in his hand
[1:30:26] he shall see of the travail of his soul
[1:30:28] and shall be satisfied
[1:30:30] by his knowledge shall my righteous
[1:30:33] servant justify many
[1:30:34] for he shall bear their iniquities
[1:30:37] therefore will i divide him
[1:30:40] abortion with the great
[1:30:44] not the pharaohs not the kings of the
[1:30:47] earth
[1:30:48] but the great and he
[1:30:52] shall divide the spoil with the strong
[1:30:57] that's you he divides the spoil
[1:31:01] the life he divides it to the strong
[1:31:07] me a mighty man almighty god speaking to
[1:31:10] you
[1:31:11] you can only let almighty god come on
[1:31:13] the inside of you
[1:31:14] the mighty god will let you know that
[1:31:16] though you are weak
[1:31:17] he becomes your strength
[1:31:21] hallelujah to the man to those who are
[1:31:23] strong he increases their strength
[1:31:26] to those who is weak he gives might
[1:31:30] because he had poured out his soul unto
[1:31:32] death and he was numbered with the
[1:31:34] transgressors
[1:31:35] and he bear the sin of many and made
[1:31:37] intercession
[1:31:38] for the transgressors i want to draw
[1:31:40] your attention here
[1:31:42] in verse 8. he was taken from prison
[1:31:46] and from judgment and who
[1:31:49] shall declare his generation
[1:31:54] notice not generations because his
[1:31:56] generation
[1:31:58] has no beginning hallelujah has no end
[1:32:02] who shall declare his generation when
[1:32:05] you open matthew chapter one it does not
[1:32:08] say
[1:32:08] now here is the generations of jesus no
[1:32:10] no here's the generation
[1:32:14] this is part of the genealogy these are
[1:32:17] the genes that are in
[1:32:19] the book are you with me and in order
[1:32:22] for the genes to come forth
[1:32:24] it's got to be the life that comes to
[1:32:27] that seed
[1:32:28] in order to bring it forth there is seed
[1:32:31] there is potential
[1:32:32] there is life that rests within you from
[1:32:35] when you dropped from your mother's womb
[1:32:37] it was in you the whole time
[1:32:40] that's why you never could be satisfied
[1:32:43] anywhere
[1:32:43] else you tried to fit in you tried to do
[1:32:47] other things
[1:32:48] but there's something about it you just
[1:32:50] couldn't fit in
[1:32:53] amen yeah there's only one place that
[1:32:56] you ordained to be
[1:32:57] and that's in him
[1:33:01] you can try to satisfy that placing but
[1:33:03] there's
[1:33:04] no other place outside of jesus christ
[1:33:08] [Music]
[1:33:11] the bible said in acts chapter 1 all
[1:33:14] great philosophies
[1:33:16] those things which jesus began
[1:33:19] to do teach
[1:33:23] it's not the acts of the apostles it's
[1:33:25] the acts of the holy ghost
[1:33:27] through the apostles
[1:33:30] vessels that he called you know and they
[1:33:33] couldn't explain listen now listen when
[1:33:36] they couldn't explain what was going on
[1:33:38] and what happened in the crucifixion
[1:33:40] blew up their thoughts
[1:33:45] it didn't happen this way i prayed for
[1:33:47] it this way i looked for it this way
[1:33:49] and they just kind of better go back to
[1:33:52] fishing
[1:33:53] i don't know just gonna go back to
[1:33:55] fishing huh i don't know what to do here
[1:33:57] tell you just i thought he was the one i
[1:33:59] thought for sure
[1:34:00] you know i thought god for sure was
[1:34:02] speaking to me in that service
[1:34:04] man i just thought jesus comes right
[1:34:06] along
[1:34:07] and he comes too amen
[1:34:11] you see their discouragement had nothing
[1:34:13] to do
[1:34:14] with the word being fulfilled it had
[1:34:17] everything
[1:34:18] to do with it coming to pass
[1:34:21] but not according to how they had it
[1:34:22] figured out
[1:34:25] i'm not just talking about the word of
[1:34:27] the hour i'm talking about the word
[1:34:29] coming into your life too
[1:34:31] i'm talking about god working through
[1:34:32] your life sometimes
[1:34:34] you even feel like as a son and daughter
[1:34:36] of god you might feel like
[1:34:38] i don't feel like nothing's going on in
[1:34:39] my life i feel like my prayers are going
[1:34:42] up and they're bouncing right off the
[1:34:43] ceiling but you realize in the midst of
[1:34:45] that time
[1:34:46] you could give up and you could run but
[1:34:48] there's an anchor on the inside
[1:34:49] there's a real faith on the inside as a
[1:34:52] son and daughter of god
[1:34:53] it doesn't matter about condition it
[1:34:55] doesn't matter how you feel
[1:34:56] there's a faith that anchors you that
[1:34:58] knows that when i pray
[1:35:00] he hears me when i pray my feelings have
[1:35:02] nothing to do with
[1:35:03] it he's the same god he said ask the
[1:35:06] father anything in my name
[1:35:07] and i'll do it that's a faith that'll
[1:35:09] stand right there
[1:35:11] and call the devil a liar
[1:35:16] hallelujah when the enemy wants to try
[1:35:19] to make his accusation
[1:35:20] here you are letting down old rags and
[1:35:23] said i will not
[1:35:24] i will not give in i will not cave in
[1:35:27] why there's a greater substance on the
[1:35:30] inside of you
[1:35:31] [Music]
[1:35:32] [Applause]
[1:35:34] the word has found the hiding place
[1:35:47] it's like elijah and elisha
[1:35:52] elijah fulfilled god had given to elijah
[1:35:57] go do this go do this go do this go do
[1:35:59] this elijah did four miracles
[1:36:01] elisha did eight it wasn't either of
[1:36:03] those men doing the miracles it was
[1:36:05] god yielding moving through yielded lies
[1:36:09] you know what god was showing through
[1:36:11] elijah's life if you just be obedient to
[1:36:13] the word i bought
[1:36:14] i brought through elijah when the rest
[1:36:16] of them in that day
[1:36:17] wanted to cast aside elijah's elijah's
[1:36:20] message
[1:36:21] they wanted to override it the prophets
[1:36:23] of baal but there was a micah
[1:36:25] that would stand in the midst of that
[1:36:27] time there was a jehoshaphat
[1:36:29] when they wanted to call those 400 men
[1:36:31] out but jehoshaphat said
[1:36:33] is there one more
[1:36:36] yeah but i hate him
[1:36:39] go bring him to us oh glory
[1:36:42] they brought him but it really wasn't
[1:36:44] their strength that brought him
[1:36:46] out it was the call
[1:36:49] from a heart of a believer like
[1:36:51] jehoshaphat
[1:36:53] that says i hear all of this i sense all
[1:36:55] this anointing and emotion
[1:36:57] but is there not one more
[1:37:02] brother and sister you don't need a lot
[1:37:04] of opinions
[1:37:05] you just need to hear the voice of god
[1:37:08] [Applause]
[1:37:11] it'll stabilize you it'll meet the
[1:37:14] challenge of the hour
[1:37:16] there ain't something that's sounding
[1:37:17] out here if you let it he'll sound right
[1:37:19] in your
[1:37:20] life
[1:37:24] elisha was a man who was known to pour
[1:37:27] water
[1:37:28] on the hands of elijah
[1:37:31] there was a need the enemy's upon us who
[1:37:34] we gonna get
[1:37:36] they said go get elisha he poured water
[1:37:38] on the hands of elijah
[1:37:40] you see he was serving the word how do
[1:37:43] you serve the word in this day
[1:37:44] oh brother samuel i have the books all
[1:37:46] displayed in my house and you know i
[1:37:47] have the tapes all polished up
[1:37:49] that ain't displaying it all right
[1:37:52] i mean i'm gonna burst some bubbles but
[1:37:54] the tape ain't the token
[1:37:56] books ain't the token but the message is
[1:38:00] get under the blood the message is the
[1:38:03] token
[1:38:04] get under the blood
[1:38:08] we got the bible on our coffee table god
[1:38:10] wants it more than just on your coffee
[1:38:12] table
[1:38:13] thank god that you've got it out matter
[1:38:15] of fact it's a powerful thing if you
[1:38:16] have an open bible in your house
[1:38:20] it's the truth the powerful thing have a
[1:38:22] bible open in your house
[1:38:27] i can't get into that right now but
[1:38:29] there's got to be more
[1:38:30] than just a bible laying there i pray to
[1:38:33] god that the lord just stirs in your
[1:38:35] heart to say
[1:38:36] that's what i want i want that god of
[1:38:39] the bible
[1:38:40] i want him to be raised out of history
[1:38:42] and brought to the forefront in my life
[1:38:46] there's people in this hour the bride of
[1:38:49] jesus christ where religion ain't enough
[1:38:53] going to a church once in a while being
[1:38:55] a part of something it ain't a social
[1:38:56] club to him
[1:38:58] this is between life and death
[1:39:01] we're looking to that inside we battle
[1:39:04] we fight
[1:39:05] we wrestle not against flesh and blood
[1:39:07] there's things that we battle
[1:39:08] against sometimes we get down we can get
[1:39:11] a little discouraged and here we'll come
[1:39:12] to the house of god
[1:39:14] and it might seem like within us my
[1:39:16] goodness all sorts of things
[1:39:17] going through our mind like why in the
[1:39:19] world am i even here but there's
[1:39:20] something on the inside of you
[1:39:22] that's looking for that inside because
[1:39:24] all of a sudden once you see him come by
[1:39:27] and him raised up it just it just
[1:39:30] illuminates something
[1:39:31] in your heart and it's something you
[1:39:33] walk out of here
[1:39:35] encouraged you walked out of here i'm
[1:39:37] ready to go
[1:39:38] i'm ready to go i'm ready to go what
[1:39:41] does that
[1:39:42] mean the living lord jesus
[1:39:47] are you willing to let down them old
[1:39:48] clots
[1:39:50] bless him in their own rights don't let
[1:39:52] pride get in the way just let them down
[1:39:58] your needs is what brings him on the
[1:40:02] [Music]
[1:40:06] scene
[1:40:10] matthew 10 32
[1:40:14] i'm trying to get somewhere here
[1:40:20] jesus said whoso therefore shall confess
[1:40:23] me before men
[1:40:26] him will i confess also before my father
[1:40:30] which is in heaven but whosoever shall
[1:40:34] deny me before men him will i also deny
[1:40:37] before my father which is in heaven
[1:40:39] think not that i am come to send peace
[1:40:43] on earth i came not to send peace
[1:40:47] but a sword i am come to set a man
[1:40:50] at variance against his father
[1:40:54] and the daughter against her mother and
[1:40:57] the daughter-in-law
[1:40:58] against her mother-in-law now this ain't
[1:41:02] jesus given permission for you to be
[1:41:03] rude to your in-laws
[1:41:06] you understand what he's saying the word
[1:41:10] the word is the person
[1:41:14] of jesus christ
[1:41:17] he is the tree of life
[1:41:20] he is the vine we are the branches
[1:41:24] he comes to identify those
[1:41:28] who are a part of his generation
[1:41:32] of his genealogy
[1:41:35] the pharisees remember what they said we
[1:41:37] have abraham to our father
[1:41:40] jesus said before abraham was
[1:41:44] i
[1:41:48] he said you're not acting like abraham
[1:41:51] abraham let down
[1:41:53] and lifted me up he rejoiced to see me
[1:41:57] in my day he said you're not acting like
[1:42:01] abraham
[1:42:02] though they could be of the flesh
[1:42:05] but they were not the children of the
[1:42:07] promise
[1:42:09] because the children of the promise
[1:42:11] remember who the children of the promise
[1:42:12] were
[1:42:12] people could not even read their names
[1:42:15] now matthew was a tax collector that's
[1:42:17] true
[1:42:19] that guy nobody wanted him around all
[1:42:20] right his own people even though he was
[1:42:22] a jew
[1:42:23] he'd count him an outcast
[1:42:27] jesus calls to be his disciples a band
[1:42:30] of
[1:42:30] outcasts
[1:42:34] this is going to be the work to announce
[1:42:38] that the jubilee is on these are the men
[1:42:42] that are going to declare that the
[1:42:44] messiah has
[1:42:45] come and now he has sent back his spirit
[1:42:48] to anoint
[1:42:49] messiahs these men
[1:42:52] why any going to the school down there
[1:42:54] to caiaphasis
[1:42:56] why isn't he going to the rest of them
[1:42:58] you know why
[1:43:00] they had put him in a dungeon
[1:43:03] when he came among them they rejected it
[1:43:08] this guy who in the world he think he is
[1:43:12] his mother impregnated by a drunken
[1:43:15] roman soldier
[1:43:17] this virgin birth stuff that was
[1:43:20] scripture
[1:43:22] that was scripture this wasn't made up
[1:43:25] jesus listen to me
[1:43:26] jesus came to fulfill what was written
[1:43:31] are you with me and it was not the man
[1:43:33] listen to me now closely
[1:43:35] it was not the flesh it was god
[1:43:38] moving through that ordained seed
[1:43:44] and that life moving through that
[1:43:46] ordained seed
[1:43:47] jesus was the ordained seed to express
[1:43:50] and reveal god to that generation
[1:43:54] are you with me he was the redeemer
[1:43:57] anointed one and
[1:44:01] that word was revealed
[1:44:04] in and through his life
[1:44:07] what did he say i do nothing but what i
[1:44:10] see the father do
[1:44:12] hallelujah that doeth the sun likewise
[1:44:14] you know what jesus was saying
[1:44:16] i am the visible form of the invisible
[1:44:20] god
[1:44:23] what his desires are i am manifesting it
[1:44:26] [Music]
[1:44:28] there is a divine connection between the
[1:44:31] invisible
[1:44:32] he was tied in with an invisible union
[1:44:35] they said you're a man you're no more
[1:44:37] you're just a man and yet you said you
[1:44:39] saw abraham
[1:44:40] they failed to recognize that the god
[1:44:42] who came in and came
[1:44:44] and visited abraham in a veil of flesh
[1:44:46] he was standing
[1:44:48] there in that veil of flesh known as his
[1:44:51] son
[1:44:51] he was veiled there according to the
[1:44:53] word and yet though they packed the word
[1:44:56] in their hands
[1:44:57] they read it in their temples they
[1:44:59] couldn't recognize
[1:45:00] the words standing there
[1:45:05] and they crucified it
[1:45:13] let me say the evilness of that spirit
[1:45:15] when
[1:45:16] lazarus was raised from the great you
[1:45:18] read this in your bible
[1:45:19] when lazarus was raised from the grave
[1:45:21] and lazarus shows up
[1:45:23] you know the bible said there were
[1:45:24] pharisees that conspired to take him and
[1:45:26] kill him
[1:45:26] lest that testimony would be spread
[1:45:30] this man's been raised from the dead
[1:45:35] you really think you're going to be able
[1:45:36] to kill him
[1:45:42] i mean in the other part of it brother
[1:45:43] brian i mean think of it
[1:45:45] you're supposed to be leaders to god
[1:45:48] come on and yet you want to kill the
[1:45:51] very works of god
[1:45:54] preach with me now brother brown said
[1:45:57] that same spirit
[1:45:58] that was there upon cain when he
[1:46:01] saw god vindicate abel's sacrifice
[1:46:05] it stirred something up on the inside of
[1:46:08] him
[1:46:08] and he rose up and he slew abel
[1:46:14] [Music]
[1:46:16] and he said that same evil spirit has
[1:46:18] come
[1:46:19] against that all the way down through he
[1:46:22] said that evil spirit no
[1:46:24] listen to me now it can't overthrow
[1:46:27] the holy ghost so it tries to discredit
[1:46:30] the vessel it's using it
[1:46:36] hallelujah aren't you glad to the holy
[1:46:39] ghost came
[1:46:42] you said i'm not able to live this life
[1:46:44] he said i know you're not able
[1:46:46] but i'm able in you amen and the holy
[1:46:50] ghost came
[1:46:50] and you're able come on
[1:46:54] now this old cane would have kept you
[1:46:56] away but there was an able down on the
[1:46:57] inside
[1:46:59] there was an able that could be led to
[1:47:01] the altar
[1:47:02] an able that could die with the
[1:47:04] sacrifice
[1:47:05] cain could not die

[1:49:24] only a spirit on them
[1:49:25] that's right right that's right this is
[1:49:27] where discernment of the word comes into
[1:49:29] place
[1:49:29] it's only a spirit that's upon them this
[1:49:32] is where you need
[1:49:33] to be equipped by the spirit of god with
[1:49:35] the word of god to stand there with a
[1:49:37] token
[1:49:37] and recognize when you're talking to him
[1:49:39] you're not talking to your son or
[1:49:40] daughter it's a spirit that would get
[1:49:42] upon him
[1:49:43] but you stand there with a token with
[1:49:45] that living word of god
[1:49:46] pulsating for your life him who was dead
[1:49:50] now is raised to life and power in your
[1:49:52] life it'll have an effect on their life
[1:49:55] i just heard brother brown i'm here
[1:49:57] early this morning
[1:49:58] in the message has changed where brother
[1:50:00] i'm saying i'm preaching he said going
[1:50:01] out here and preaching
[1:50:02] in these places and he says it seems
[1:50:05] like the word
[1:50:06] is not even taking an effect
[1:50:10] he said but then i come around and other
[1:50:11] times he said i realize
[1:50:15] it is taking effect
[1:50:18] we've all been there right seems like
[1:50:20] the word ain't taking effect
[1:50:22] remember it's not your word that's going
[1:50:24] to change anybody it's his word
[1:50:26] [Music]
[1:50:28] amen if that word can find a place in
[1:50:30] that life
[1:50:31] remember you may not see it come into
[1:50:33] expression right away
[1:50:34] you may not even live to see it come
[1:50:36] into expression oh my
[1:50:37] where's my aunt linda at she's back
[1:50:39] there in the corner and my my papa who i
[1:50:41] never met one day
[1:50:42] i'll meet him i never met him but there
[1:50:45] was a dime
[1:50:46] where here it was and where the life
[1:50:47] that she was going about and living he
[1:50:49] would stand right there he told all the
[1:50:51] family about it

[1:50:57] later how long was it aunt linda 30 some
[1:50:59] years later

[1:51:06] brother joy she reached in there
[1:51:08] she gave her heart to god she was going
[1:51:10] to a church somewhere over there in
[1:51:12] cleveland
[1:51:12] but there was a hungry there was a
[1:51:14] desire my grandma was in a nursing home
[1:51:17] my linda was going to visit in a nursing
[1:51:19] home and there was something about it
[1:51:21] she knew
[1:51:22] what grandma had was real it was genuine
[1:51:25] and grandma said i want to get back to
[1:51:26] the house of god so she would go there
[1:51:29] and bring my grandma right here in the
[1:51:31] service let me just tell you something
[1:51:33] we could have let down and say why is
[1:51:35] grandma in there why is grandma in there
[1:51:37] grandma had to be there
[1:51:40] she needed a leg here because she had to
[1:51:43] get under the water of life
[1:51:47] she had to get under the water of life
[1:51:51] sometimes we're so busy trying to say oh
[1:51:54] brother aaron if you'd only done this if
[1:51:56] you'd only done that if you hadn't done
[1:51:57] this you only done that man we're trying
[1:51:59] to band-aid people's problems
[1:52:00] we're trying to always you should have
[1:52:02] done that should have done this should
[1:52:03] have done that
[1:52:04] should have done this shouldn't have
[1:52:05] done it this way should have done it
[1:52:06] that way
[1:52:10] always one to try to correct something
[1:52:12] and prevent something
[1:52:13] listen you can do and we do all that we
[1:52:16] can do
[1:52:17] this is where we trust god
[1:52:18] [Applause]
[1:52:23] that allows us to live in this glorious
[1:52:24] rest
[1:52:29] can i have a few more minutes i'll let
[1:52:31] you know how to get started on it
[1:52:36] and he that taketh not his cross
[1:52:40] so brother drake this isn't jesus cross
[1:52:42] now this is your cross
[1:52:46] the joy this in jesus christ this is
[1:52:48] your cross
[1:52:50] what was the cross for
[1:52:55] what was the cross for
[1:52:58] that he might die to be lifted up
[1:53:03] one who was thought to be accursed
[1:53:11] listen to me closely
[1:53:13] there's a lot of things that can deal
[1:53:15] with the emotion and the spirit of a man
[1:53:18] but there's only one thing that can lead
[1:53:20] you into eternal life
[1:53:24] and that's the lord jesus christ
[1:53:27] you can have emotion you can have a lot
[1:53:29] of things
[1:53:30] and still you're just as much alive as
[1:53:33] she ever was
[1:53:35] but when you're led to that cross
[1:53:38] like paul said i am crucified
[1:53:42] to the world and the world to me
[1:53:47] nevertheless i live
[1:53:50] yet not i but christ liveth
[1:53:55] in me now think about how this cross
[1:53:59] is and followeth me is not worthy
[1:54:02] in one place of the scripture i believe
[1:54:03] it's in luke where it speaks if he
[1:54:05] taketh none up his cross
[1:54:08] daily oh my daily
[1:54:12] daily bearing the cross
[1:54:16] who are we dying to daily self
[1:54:19] yes self
[1:54:23] thoughts come our own thoughts come but
[1:54:25] the dying
[1:54:26] is where we let the mind of christ have
[1:54:29] the right of way
[1:54:32] it's dying to ourselves dying when we've
[1:54:34] taken our own thoughts
[1:54:36] instead of his thoughts taking
[1:54:40] our cross i can't take your cross
[1:54:43] paul i can't do it you can't take mine
[1:54:46] all right
[1:54:47] but god will give me grace how do i take
[1:54:50] my cross
[1:54:50] how did he take his cross yes
[1:54:55] he surrendered all right
[1:54:58] and followeth after me is not worthy of
[1:55:00] me he that findeth
[1:55:02] his life shall lose it
[1:55:05] and he that loseth his life for my sake
[1:55:09] shall find it let me just try to bring
[1:55:12] this down here
[1:55:13] he that receiveth you receiveth me
[1:55:18] and he that receiveth me receiveth him
[1:55:22] that sent me he that receiveth
[1:55:25] a prophet in the name of a prophet
[1:55:29] shall receive a prophet's reward
[1:55:32] notice in the name of what does it be
[1:55:36] mean to be in the name of jesus said i
[1:55:38] am come in my
[1:55:40] father's name is that right the name
[1:55:43] being the characteristic
[1:55:44] that of his life so it is to receive
[1:55:48] a prophet in the name or the
[1:55:51] characteristic
[1:55:52] of god working through that
[1:55:56] prophet shall receive
[1:55:59] a prophet's reward and he that receiveth
[1:56:02] a
[1:56:02] righteous man in the name of a righteous
[1:56:06] man
[1:56:06] shall receive a righteous man's reward
[1:56:10] all right i hope you understand me
[1:56:12] there'll be people
[1:56:14] and there is that you come in contact
[1:56:17] with
[1:56:18] they'll never darken a church door
[1:56:21] but the testimony of jesus christ in
[1:56:23] your life won't put them in the bride
[1:56:25] but the testimony of jesus christ in
[1:56:27] your life
[1:56:28] to where they are so inclined to that
[1:56:32] will gain them entrance
[1:56:36] because how how are you righteous are
[1:56:39] you righteous by your own works
[1:56:41] no what is the righteousness
[1:56:44] his life the atonement on display
[1:56:49] remember brother brown tells us in the
[1:56:50] church age book when he breaks down that
[1:56:52] of the book of life
[1:56:53] in the sardisian age and puts it down
[1:56:55] into the four classes
[1:56:56] the elect those who will come up in the
[1:56:58] church and then he has those whose names
[1:57:00] that were never written on the lambs on
[1:57:02] the on the book of life and then you
[1:57:04] have that class
[1:57:05] which he links gamilia into that camilla
[1:57:08] himself
[1:57:08] could not see what god was doing but
[1:57:11] gamilia told the men
[1:57:13] in that hour he said let me tell you
[1:57:15] something
[1:57:16] if this is of god and you're coming
[1:57:18] against it you got god on your hands
[1:57:21] gamilia said but if it's not of god you
[1:57:23] don't have to worry about it
[1:57:25] it'll fizzle out brother brown tells us
[1:57:28] those very words saved him
[1:57:31] right that's our mind sometimes to
[1:57:34] figure out
[1:57:35] this ain't you walking around saying i
[1:57:36] give you eternal life i'll give you that
[1:57:38] ain't what that is
[1:57:40] then what it is at all it's your life
[1:57:42] that sometimes
[1:57:43] that people you can look at and say well
[1:57:46] why don't they ever come to church
[1:57:47] why don't they ever ask anything about
[1:57:48] it why don't they ever it in that
[1:57:50] they're seeing a life or see something
[1:57:52] that's genuine
[1:57:53] and they said if there's anybody that's
[1:57:55] genuine they
[1:57:57] are genuine what is that
[1:58:02] that's the prophet the holy ghost raised
[1:58:05] out of the dungeon
[1:58:07] raised out of by the rags and clouts in
[1:58:09] our life he raised up in power
[1:58:14] are you with me now i hope i don't
[1:58:16] stumble you
[1:58:17] but i'll say it to you like this right
[1:58:19] here here it goes on to say and
[1:58:21] whosoever shall give
[1:58:22] to drink unto one of these little ones a
[1:58:24] cup of cold water only
[1:58:26] in the name of the disciple
[1:58:30] are you hearing me brother branham had
[1:58:32] medical bills paid for
[1:58:36] by individuals and by people that's
[1:58:39] right
[1:58:40] are you with me many different
[1:58:43] testimonies
[1:58:44] that you go through in here and how many
[1:58:46] were very good and very kind
[1:58:48] to that of the prophet look there's been
[1:58:50] people that's been good and kind to you
[1:58:51] as well
[1:58:53] they don't listen it doesn't mean that
[1:58:54] oh my yes so and so came over and they
[1:58:56] planted my tomatoes for me they're going
[1:58:58] to be there
[1:58:59] that's not you deciding that but i'll
[1:59:01] tell you this right here let me just put
[1:59:03] it in a way
[1:59:03] that i heard it told years ago if my
[1:59:06] wife was on the roadway
[1:59:08] and there happened to be a flat tire
[1:59:10] come on the car and you know i'm not
[1:59:12] around to be able to change that tire
[1:59:14] but there is somebody who comes along
[1:59:17] and they see
[1:59:18] that she needs help as a little lady
[1:59:21] and they say ma'am you just stay you
[1:59:23] just stay right over there go around the
[1:59:24] front of the car over there
[1:59:26] we'll help you take care of this right
[1:59:27] now okay can you pop the trunk and they
[1:59:29] go through it all and they get that tire
[1:59:31] put on there
[1:59:35] i'd be so thankful if i could find that
[1:59:39] man i'd reward him
[1:59:41] i'd reward him you know why because he
[1:59:44] helped my sweetheart out

[2:01:37] what he's doing lebron goes on to talk
[2:01:41] about this friend
[2:01:42] to be a friend of a prophet it's to

[2:01:46] the word of the lord
[2:01:50] that comes through that prophet
[2:01:56] the shunammite woman brother abraham

[2:03:19] was a friend of god yes
[2:03:22] look what it got him got him a body
[2:03:25] change
[2:03:26] all right

[2:03:33] and you know what it did it brought a
[2:03:35] change in him and sarah
[2:03:39] he was a friend of a prophet he received
[2:03:42] a prophet's reward when there were needs
[2:03:46] that arose
[2:03:47] along the way in the journey a reward
[2:03:50] was
[2:03:51] god the word that he has said he makes
[2:03:54] that word alive and real and addresses
[2:03:56] your need
[2:03:57] and your situation and you look and say
[2:04:00] brother samuel how did you know brother
[2:04:02] samuel didn't know
[2:04:04] but god the same god the living god
[2:04:07] who declared himself in this generation
[2:04:10] when the church
[2:04:11] put him on the outside but he said i
[2:04:15] stand at the door
[2:04:17] and knock and who will ever hear
[2:04:20] my voice and open unto me let down the
[2:04:24] rags in the clouds
[2:04:26] and raise up i will come into him and i
[2:04:29] will
[2:04:30] shout with him r r
[2:04:39] so what do you say about my leg
[2:04:43] the ethiopian
[2:04:48] brother brandon put it just as simple as
[2:04:50] this right here
[2:04:53] god is ever present
[2:04:58] he's waiting longing
[2:05:01] desiring to be lifted
[2:05:09] we can look back in the past
[2:05:12] it can be even in recent past
[2:05:15] you can look at daddy mama
[2:05:18] this brother or this sister but what
[2:05:21] about you
[2:05:23] you see the only way that he's lifted
[2:05:25] out of history
[2:05:26] for you is when you let down
[2:05:29] that's right and let him be lifted
[2:05:32] in power in your life now see this is
[2:05:36] your decision this morning
[2:05:37] you can leave him in a dungeon you can
[2:05:40] try to stifle that voice
[2:05:42] many people try to deal or stifle that
[2:05:45] voice that's ringing out
[2:05:46] and they become immersed in other things
[2:05:49] in their life
[2:05:50] and they try to deaden that voice
[2:05:54] there was a woman
[2:06:01] oh he's sweetly roaring there was a
[2:06:04] woman
[2:06:06] she said in a meeting
[2:06:09] and the spirit of god through the
[2:06:11] prophet gave an invitation
[2:06:13] and she turned it down
[2:06:16] she was counting on i have another
[2:06:19] opportunity
[2:06:21] i i wouldn't even give that religion to
[2:06:24] one of my
[2:06:25] cows or horses whatever she said brother
[2:06:28] branham happened to be in a meeting
[2:06:30] and he met that woman walking on the
[2:06:32] street
[2:06:34] let me just tell you something she never
[2:06:37] intended
[2:06:38] to turn out the way that she did
[2:06:44] when she met the prophet of god think
[2:06:46] about it
[2:06:48] she didn't offer him rags or
[2:06:51] a life to say god let this word be born
[2:06:55] in me
[2:06:57] but she had become so hardened she
[2:07:00] didn't offer her life
[2:07:01] she offered the prophet a drink
[2:07:05] of whiskey
[2:07:08] and the prophet said you know better
[2:07:09] than that
[2:07:11] but you see where he had got to that
[2:07:13] hardness
[2:07:14] she took a spirit and not
[2:07:17] even recognize it
[2:07:20] let me just tell you how serious i don't
[2:07:22] tell you this to scare you
[2:07:24] but i pray it puts fear in your soul
[2:07:25] that it will cause you to run to jesus
[2:07:28] if you don't know him and you haven't
[2:07:30] lifted him you might say well brother
[2:07:32] samuel i can
[2:07:32] i can stand against it and i can stand
[2:07:34] it you
[2:07:35] can't you're no match for the powers of
[2:07:38] this day but it's beyond that
[2:07:41] wouldn't you want the lord jesus to be
[2:07:44] raised
[2:07:45] in power in your life yes amen
[2:07:48] wouldn't you want the living god this
[2:07:50] message that he
[2:07:51] sent to you and i is not to be on a
[2:07:54] bookshelf
[2:07:57] it's to be on display
[2:08:01] it's the medicine in the cabinet but you
[2:08:03] got to take it
[2:08:04] it don't do you good enough to have the
[2:08:06] medicine bottle says three times
[2:08:08] a day you gotta take the medicine
[2:08:13] and he's here i said he's here
[2:08:18] you got a choice to make you can let him
[2:08:20] you can let it remain and try to just
[2:08:22] walk over remember he was in a dungeon
[2:08:24] they were walking all over
[2:08:27] brother william you know what i'm
[2:08:28] talking about over there in uh cape
[2:08:30] coast
[2:08:31] brother samson took me through there
[2:08:34] where the tribal leaders would
[2:08:35] capture other tribes people and bring
[2:08:38] them in there and sell them as slaves or
[2:08:40] whiskey and tobacco and whatever more
[2:08:43] sure the white man was down at the boat
[2:08:44] but it was the it was the men over there
[2:08:46] that were capturing their own people
[2:08:48] history books don't tell you that right
[2:08:50] but it's the truth
[2:08:53] i walked over places
[2:08:56] in that castle dungeons
[2:08:59] am i right brother william dungeons
[2:09:02] there was a church right over top
[2:09:06] of a dungeon where slaves were kept
[2:09:11] you could see we're in the earth
[2:09:15] their claws when i say claws you
[2:09:17] understand on the
[2:09:18] fingers where they are dug they are so
[2:09:20] tight put together
[2:09:24] there was a chamber system all
[2:09:25] underneath that castle
[2:09:29] brother johannes stood right there in a
[2:09:30] church
[2:09:32] dear god there's a dungeon underneath
[2:09:35] this church
[2:09:38] and that's where the slaves were and how
[2:09:40] could they have worshipped
[2:09:42] and those people down there
[2:09:46] let me just tell you something there's a
[2:09:49] worse dungeon
[2:09:51] than that dungeon there's a worse
[2:09:54] slavery
[2:09:55] than that slavery and i'm here to tell
[2:09:57] you right now
[2:09:58] you don't have to put claw marks on that
[2:10:01] floor
[2:10:02] you can accept what he who was
[2:10:05] oppressed he was afflicted he was
[2:10:08] bruised for your iniquities
[2:10:09] the chastisement of your peace was upon
[2:10:12] him he was bruised for your iniquities
[2:10:14] he's already paid the price
[2:10:18] you say what must that do let your life
[2:10:21] down hallelujah and he
[2:10:25] will raise himself in power
[2:10:28] in your life he'll
[2:10:32] give you power that you cannot even
[2:10:35] imagine
[2:10:36] because it's not earthly power it's
[2:10:39] supernatural power
[2:10:41] it's a life that changes you where it
[2:10:44] settles
[2:10:44] there's no longer war between you and
[2:10:47] god
[2:10:47] it comes to do away with the old sin
[2:10:50] nature
[2:10:52] [Applause]
[2:10:53] calvary made a way that he could come
[2:10:56] knocked at your door this morning
[2:10:58] calvary made a way he could come right
[2:11:00] to your doorstep
[2:11:02] and the message of the hour is god
[2:11:05] speaking to your heart to let you know
[2:11:08] this is the cross to die on
[2:11:11] this is to let your life be given over
[2:11:14] that his
[2:11:15] generation might be declared
[2:11:18] that he is the same yesterday today and
[2:11:21] forever
[2:11:23] and you become a servant of the king
[2:11:26] he bit me like one
[2:11:29] who walks after the leading of the king
[2:11:39] let him be raised out of history
[2:11:43] in your life you don't have to claw at
[2:11:46] it you don't have to scratch at it
[2:11:47] you just have to say lord be it unto me
[2:11:52] i give my life i surrender my life over
[2:11:56] how about it for the rest of us lord
[2:11:58] taking up my cross
[2:11:59] daily are there things that you could
[2:12:02] say lord
[2:12:03] lord god there's things that no doubt is
[2:12:06] hindering
[2:12:06] you from being fully displayed in my
[2:12:08] life lord i want to see my loved ones
[2:12:10] saved i want to see them i want to see
[2:12:12] them lord
[2:12:13] come in lord it seems like when i talk
[2:12:15] to them they just seem like they go
[2:12:16] further the opposite way what did the
[2:12:19] holy spirit
[2:12:20] say to us through the prophet in this
[2:12:21] hour he said let them
[2:12:24] see it in you yes amen
[2:12:28] amen what should i do
[2:12:32] you keep giving yourself to the lord yes
[2:12:35] amen
[2:12:35] because what they're witnessing in your
[2:12:37] life
[2:12:39] is the absolute the revelation that's
[2:12:42] taken hold
[2:12:43] sometimes we get discouraged because our
[2:12:45] words it seems like they're not having
[2:12:46] no effect
[2:12:47] we want to try to convince and we want
[2:12:49] but remember our words are not what does
[2:12:50] it
[2:12:51] jesus said my words are spirit
[2:12:54] and life it's him
[2:12:59] it's him i don't know how many times
[2:13:01] after
[2:13:02] service many times i feel like my things

[2:13:38] it's him he is jehovah jireh
[2:13:41] he's the one that packs us into the
[2:13:43] promises

[2:13:47] in our life
[2:13:49] amen oh god

[2:14:17] be the center of my life

[2:14:30] known that a son of god lives here
[2:14:32] let it be known that a daughter of god
[2:14:34] lives here i wanted to know
[2:14:36] lord god that they see you may you be
[2:14:38] lifted up lord in my life
[2:14:40] lord let you be the sinner attraction
[2:14:43] lord
[2:14:43] oh god may it not be lord god with the
[2:14:46] lord with a
[2:14:47] big words or majority of words but let
[2:14:50] it be lord god with your presence
[2:14:54] let it be lord with your presence
[2:14:57] hallelujah
[2:15:00] oh i wondered this morning you might say
[2:15:03] brother samuel
[2:15:05] you're not late you're not you're not
[2:15:06] keeping him in a dungeon but i want him
[2:15:08] to be more on display in my life
[2:15:11] i don't want this church to be like that
[2:15:12] church that i was in over there in the
[2:15:14] cape castle
[2:15:15] and they've got a dungeon this church
[2:15:17] listen it's built upon thus saith the
[2:15:19] lord
[2:15:20] it's not that upon a man it's built upon
[2:15:22] the revealed word of the hour
[2:15:24] and where the spirit of the lord is
[2:15:26] there is liberty
[2:15:27] it's the spirit of god coming down that
[2:15:30] sounds the jubilee
[2:15:31] it gives liberty to you and i it
[2:15:33] proclaims there's victory for you
[2:15:35] there's liberty there's deliverance
[2:15:38] there's healing for you
[2:15:39] this is not a place to put him away
[2:15:42] this is not a dungeon this is a house
[2:15:46] for him to make himself feel at home
[2:15:51] is that your desire
[2:16:02] experience
[2:16:07] i wonder if you've never repented before
[2:16:09] maybe you've never felt compelled
[2:16:12] but right now your heart is moved to
[2:16:14] repent
[2:16:16] lord i lay my life down
[2:16:20] perhaps you've never been baptized in
[2:16:22] the name of jesus christ that's part of
[2:16:23] repentance
[2:16:25] to be identified with your sacrifice
[2:16:29] walking into the water of baptism to be
[2:16:32] baptized
[2:16:33] in the name of the lord jesus christ he
[2:16:36] came down to be identified
[2:16:40] with you maybe you've been baptized in
[2:16:43] the name of jesus christ
[2:16:46] but have you been filled with the holy
[2:16:48] ghost
[2:16:50] that's what brings full identification
[2:16:54] with him if any of that applies
[2:17:01] reach out to him right now
[2:17:05] reach out to him
[2:17:09] you're not too far gone
[2:17:13] satan might want to tell you you're too
[2:17:14] far gone and you cross the line
[2:17:17] i say in the name of jesus christ you
[2:17:19] call that devil a liar
[2:17:25] you've not crossed the line he's just
[2:17:27] trying to torment you
[2:17:28] and keep you from that presence that'll
[2:17:31] release
[2:17:32] his life in you
[2:17:36] brother samuel i've got a decision
[2:17:37] that's so great to make
[2:17:39] look at him look at him
[2:17:42] he made the greatest decision he left
[2:17:45] glory
[2:17:46] to come down and be identified with us
[2:17:50] he took not on him not the nature of
[2:17:52] angels but he took on him the seed of
[2:17:54] abraham
[2:17:57] so from your heart you say lord
[2:18:01] i can't solve these problems
[2:18:04] but you're the answer would you identify
[2:18:08] with him this morning you're the answer
[2:18:10] lord
[2:18:11] god bless your hands you're the answer
[2:18:14] lord
[2:18:16] god bless your hands
[2:18:20] oh let's pray what a great stillness
[2:18:24] what a
[2:18:24] sweet ruler of the holy spirit
[2:18:28] oh i believe this is such an opportunity
[2:18:31] to let down old rags
[2:18:32] old clouts and raise him up
[2:18:36] i believe this is a time for fresh
[2:18:37] dedication
[2:18:39] in our lives
[2:18:42] let's go to papa right now lord jesus
[2:18:48] first of all lord i want to say
[2:18:51] we're not worthy of our own accord
[2:18:55] we're not worthy
[2:18:59] lord our own righteousness filthy rags
[2:19:01] in your sight
[2:19:04] but lord we do not come based upon it
[2:19:09] our righteousness our worthiness we come
[2:19:13] based on your word where you said ask
[2:19:16] the father anything in my name and i
[2:19:18] will do it
[2:19:20] lord jesus there are needs
[2:19:24] that are sitting here in this building

[2:19:28] we don't come to church to hear a good
[2:19:31] sermon

[2:19:36] i've come to minister will you have
[2:19:38] burned upon my heart lord
[2:19:41] god you know each and every need that's
[2:19:45] behind every hand
[2:19:46] in every life father i pray this morning
[2:19:52] lord i believe that god just as that
[2:19:56] was laid in the scripture there of
[2:19:58] abandon like lord
[2:20:00] the ethiopian a gentile
[2:20:03] the lord where the jews were in the time
[2:20:05] of exile
[2:20:07] but yet it was a gentile that recognized
[2:20:10] that jeremiah was the prophet of god
[2:20:14] he recognized they had put you in the
[2:20:16] dungeon
[2:20:18] they had wanted to silence that voice
[2:20:20] lord
[2:20:21] i'm speaking here this morning
[2:20:24] these people don't want to silence your
[2:20:26] voice
[2:20:28] but satan would like to try to silence
[2:20:30] that voice
[2:20:32] satan would like to try to sidetrack and
[2:20:35] say
[2:20:35] that's not for you you're not a part of
[2:20:38] it
[2:20:41] lord i stand here under the authority of
[2:20:45] the holy ghost by your word
[2:20:48] satan you're a liar and you take your
[2:20:51] hands off
[2:20:52] in the name of jesus christ i'm calling
[2:20:55] your bluff
[2:20:56] in the name of jesus christ you take
[2:20:59] your hands off of that son and daughter
[2:21:01] of god
[2:21:04] give them back release them
[2:21:07] in the name of jesus christ
[2:21:12] you've wanted to use them as vessels
[2:21:15] like nebuchadnezzar
[2:21:16] use the vessels of the lord that belong
[2:21:19] in the tabernacle of god
[2:21:25] but i've come to clean my vessels
[2:21:28] those vessels belong to me
[2:21:31] to be filled with my life lord i ask
[2:21:40] right now
[2:21:42] if there's one here right now
[2:21:45] that god while you've moved back with
[2:21:47] this war going on
[2:21:50] you've declared yourself as the mighty
[2:21:52] conqueror
[2:21:54] i pray heavenly father if there's a
[2:21:57] heart lord right now
[2:21:58] and they're hungering down beneath there
[2:22:00] god may they take them
[2:22:01] let that voice take hold lord god on the
[2:22:04] inside may they raise lord
[2:22:06] within that promise and say lord i don't
[2:22:09] want you in the dungeon in my life
[2:22:12] i want you to be raised in power
[2:22:17] [Music]
[2:22:19] i want to surrender my life
[2:22:22] i want to let down my life i want to
[2:22:24] lose my life
[2:22:27] that i might find it your life is but a
[2:22:30] vapor
[2:22:31] it's like a jet airplane that passes
[2:22:33] over if you look up very long
[2:22:35] the trail the vapor trail
[2:22:39] will dissipate it'll go away it only
[2:22:42] becomes a memory
[2:22:44] of where an airplane once flew same with
[2:22:47] your life
[2:22:50] come here in this life it's for one
[2:22:52] purpose
[2:22:54] that you might serve the purpose of god
[2:22:58] that your life might be filled with his
[2:23:00] spirit
[2:23:02] the same you understand i've got so many
[2:23:04] big plans
[2:23:06] but would you be willing to let your
[2:23:07] plans down
[2:23:10] would you be willing to say lord without
[2:23:13] you
[2:23:14] my plans ain't nothing but filthy rags
[2:23:18] you lord god what good would my plans be
[2:23:24] but why don't you let him take your life
[2:23:28] let him mold
[2:23:31] your character by his life
[2:23:35] inside of you
[2:23:41] lord jesus
[2:23:45] i believe i'm speaking lord god this
[2:23:47] morning
[2:23:49] to abimelech
[2:23:53] gentiles lord receiving the last call
[2:23:58] the final outpouring of the holy ghost
[2:24:01] on the gentile church this world is
[2:24:04] headed for judgment
[2:24:08] 1956
[2:24:12] billy graham more roberts brother
[2:24:14] branham
[2:24:15] crossing the country
[2:24:18] but this nation rejected the baptism of
[2:24:22] the holy ghost
[2:24:25] lord we see the reason we see the
[2:24:28] the parts of juvenile delinquency we see
[2:24:31] the people lord
[2:24:32] who absolutely hate the precepts that
[2:24:35] this nation was founded on
[2:24:37] the truth of the matter is they don't
[2:24:39] they hate you lord
[2:24:44] but that all came
[2:24:47] because you were turned out of the
[2:24:49] church
[2:24:51] well they've got creeds they've got
[2:24:53] religion
[2:24:54] they've got doctrines they've got
[2:24:56] teachings
[2:24:57] but they put you on the outside of the
[2:25:00] church
[2:25:02] they were ashamed of you
[2:25:06] it's like simon invites you
[2:25:09] but they don't welcome you
[2:25:13] we'll let you sit with dirty feet the
[2:25:15] lord
[2:25:17] i'm reminded in that house of simon
[2:25:21] your prophet told us like this he said
[2:25:24] the only reason you kept that
[2:25:26] appointment
[2:25:27] because there was a little lady lord be
[2:25:31] the god
[2:25:34] she was going to be coming and there was
[2:25:36] an appointment
[2:25:37] with her
[2:25:46] when she came in they even whispered if
[2:25:48] he only knew what kind of a woman
[2:25:51] is touching him hallelujah he
[2:25:54] put her away he can't be no prophet
[2:25:58] he don't know what kind of woman is
[2:25:59] touching her
[2:26:02] but he knew what was beneath that
[2:26:04] darkness
[2:26:08] oh god you know what's beneath the
[2:26:12] darkness
[2:26:13] you knew what was beneath the darkness
[2:26:15] of my life
[2:26:18] you know what's beneath the darkness
[2:26:22] lord jesus
[2:26:27] grant lord i pray
[2:26:33] may you be called out of history a life
[2:26:36] lord that's only been around the message
[2:26:39] only been around the word
[2:26:41] maybe it's been a family association
[2:26:43] maybe it's been a family affair
[2:26:46] maybe the reason they come to church
[2:26:47] here because dad comes to church
[2:26:50] or grandma or grandpa
[2:26:54] [Music]
[2:26:55] but god may it be something that they
[2:26:57] realize this morning
[2:27:00] i need a god
[2:27:03] i need that god raised out of history
[2:27:07] i need him raised out of history i don't
[2:27:09] want to silence that voice no more
[2:27:12] i want that voice to sound inside of me
[2:27:16] i want that jubilee to sound in my life
[2:27:20] granted lord i pray oh in the name of
