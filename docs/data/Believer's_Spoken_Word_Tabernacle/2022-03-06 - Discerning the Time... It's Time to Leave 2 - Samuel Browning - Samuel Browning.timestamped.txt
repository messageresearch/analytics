[40:25] [Applause]
[40:35] it's been almost it was almost a
[40:36] two-year journey there where he got
[40:39] hired and i think brother brian was
[40:40] somewhat like the
[40:43] kind of the company that you were in
[40:44] before and then
[40:46] the lord just made a way we were just
[40:48] praying
[40:49] and together and
[40:51] god just made a way and we're just so
[40:53] thankful he's still jehovah gyra

[41:11] on these monitors that's usually not a
[41:13] request i give just a little bit
[41:17] okay if i need them up later out there a
[41:20] little bit
[41:22] they're having to work a little bit more
[41:24] back there because
[41:25] the whole issue that was going on with
[41:27] the mics remember the popping it wasn't
[41:29] anything to do with the mics at all it's
[41:31] a separate
[41:33] thing back there that controls and
[41:35] regulates the compression of sound so
[41:37] they had to move out of that right there
[41:39] so
[41:40] they'll be working a little bit
[41:42] this morning
[41:44] but also with that of just to mention
[41:47] and not take much time with that of
[41:49] ukraine

[41:53] of you probably already have seen it
[41:55] where brother barry
[41:56] he did a
[41:58] little bit more of an extensive
[42:00] update brother there's kind of been a
[42:02] little point person inside of there or
[42:04] right inside
[42:06] where different ones have given him
[42:08] uh the videos and different things of
[42:10] what's going on there so we'll get that
[42:12] sent out by email so you can take a look
[42:14] at it that's brother barry coffey and i
[42:17] just received the text from him here
[42:19] this morning more updates and i i didn't
[42:21] even have by the time i got it and have
[42:23] a chance to go through all of it
[42:26] but i know that there is some different
[42:28] families and some that have they have
[42:30] went to holy
[42:32] and
[42:34] the
[42:35] lord willing brother barry is going to
[42:36] be going there to poland
[42:38] to try to take different funds and also
[42:41] meet and try to encourage the believers
[42:43] that are there
[42:45] they're doing the believers are doing
[42:47] really well you know last week when i i
[42:49] was here and i was
[42:51] just kind of giving the update to you
[42:53] and uh then i find out that them in
[42:56] ukraine my goodness
[42:59] there were some of them right in the
[43:00] midst of everything they got out they
[43:02] went to church
[43:06] [Applause]
[43:10] that's that to me is just something i
[43:13] was just i said oh lord jesus that's
[43:15] just tremendous yes and um they're
[43:17] they're doing the one thing about it
[43:19] that they have done
[43:21] is where they have taken in some of the
[43:23] uh
[43:25] where some of the
[43:26] you know news and things like that was
[43:28] coming in
[43:30] they got together and they just made a
[43:32] decision just to
[43:34] among themselves just say you know what
[43:36] cut it off
[43:38] just cut it off we don't need because it
[43:39] was just troubling you know you start
[43:41] looking at things you entertain it and
[43:43] it starts bringing fear and uncertainty
[43:45] because all those things are uncertain
[43:47] right
[43:48] and uh but we've got a place to focus in
[43:50] this hour
[43:51] to draw strength from and i'll tell you
[43:53] what the message of the hour is good at
[43:55] all times
[43:56] amen because the message of the hour is
[43:58] in tapes and books the message of the
[44:00] hour is jesus christ revealed personally
[44:03] as a living god he is the strength of my
[44:05] life
[44:07] amen well we could just go ahead and
[44:08] preach right now
[44:11] let's let's stand if we could and let's
[44:12] read out of the bible out of first
[44:15] thessalonians
[44:17] chapter four
[44:23] and i'm just going to read
[44:25] begin in verse 13 and
[44:28] i'd like to try to
[44:29] pick up from where we were looking at
[44:34] last week as well and just try to move
[44:36] forward on that
[44:38] on that thought and just see how the
[44:39] lord will
[44:41] just direct us here in this
[44:44] first thessalonians
[44:47] chapter 4
[44:48] and verse 13
[44:51] but i would not have you
[44:54] to be ignorant brethren concerning them
[44:57] which are asleep
[44:58] that you sorrow not even as others which
[45:01] have no hope
[45:03] for if we believe that jesus died
[45:06] rose again even so them which also sleep
[45:10] in jesus will god bring with him
[45:14] for this we say unto you by the word of
[45:16] the lord
[45:17] that we which are alive and remain unto
[45:20] the coming of the lord shall not prevent
[45:22] them which are asleep
[45:24] for the lord himself shall descend from
[45:27] heaven with a shout
[45:29] with the voice of the archangel with the
[45:32] trump of god and the dead in christ
[45:35] shall rise first
[45:37] then we which are alive and remain shall
[45:40] be caught up together with them
[45:43] that's where we get our word rapture
[45:45] caught up caught up together with them
[45:48] in the clouds to meet the lord in the
[45:50] air so shall we ever be with the lord
[45:54] wherefore
[45:55] comfort
[45:57] one another
[45:58] with these
[46:00] words
[46:02] may god bless you bless the reading of
[46:04] the words you're being seated
[46:06] god bless you mr stephanie god bless you
[46:09] i thought i heard your voice
[46:11] [Applause]
[46:24] some of you have different
[46:26] things that you know
[46:35] i just want to continue to look at that
[46:37] thought on
[46:39] it's time to leave
[46:44] when i look here how paul would write
[46:47] this promise it is written as a promise
[46:50] to the church of the living god
[46:52] it's a promise that
[46:55] all the way
[46:57] down through the ages they've looked for
[47:00] it
[47:01] they've lived their life in a way
[47:04] that that any moment
[47:06] that it could take place
[47:08] you see they didn't have the
[47:09] understanding at that time
[47:12] that it would be
[47:13] so many thousands of years or hundreds
[47:16] of years or
[47:18] they didn't have that understanding but
[47:20] that shows that there's certain things
[47:22] like that that's not necessary
[47:25] and that even is part of the mercy and
[47:27] the grace of god in our lives because
[47:31] if we did know the day or the hour
[47:35] we might have a little bit more trouble
[47:36] from our flesh
[47:38] that's good right yes are you hearing me
[47:41] yes yes because we are no matter who we
[47:43] are and what we are there's a level of
[47:46] procrastination that goes in
[47:48] and we can kind of look at it like well
[47:50] if i could just you know this is the
[47:52] date right here got this marked in on
[47:54] the calendar and this is when it's going
[47:56] to happen but you see that's that's not
[47:58] how that the coming of the lord is in
[48:01] any way right it's a promise that god
[48:04] makes and he confirms it to the heart of
[48:07] the believer and they look for that that
[48:10] word to come to pass in their age
[48:12] brother branham would say it i believe
[48:15] in the message taking sides with jesus
[48:17] or the message thy house i don't
[48:18] remember which one right now
[48:20] but brother branham makes a statement he
[48:22] says that those when they are raised up
[48:24] the those that have lived in the other
[48:26] ages when they raise up he said they
[48:28] went down running and they'll raise up
[48:32] right in stride
[48:33] they went looking for they would live
[48:36] for the coming of the lord in their day
[48:38] they didn't know there's another age or
[48:40] or this age is to come that they didn't
[48:42] know that but when we look at it within
[48:45] this hour even paul would live his life
[48:48] in that time to think how paul would be
[48:51] privileged as he could say to to move
[48:54] into that part of the third heaven and
[48:56] and receive a revelation of things
[48:58] that's not even lawful to be uttered but
[49:01] yet we recognize that god has a season
[49:05] and god has a time
[49:06] because paul did not live his life as
[49:09] though that well it's not going to come
[49:10] in my time or my generation but paul
[49:13] lived his life as did all the believers
[49:16] that this is the time right and i
[49:19] believe that's how that not only we are
[49:21] to live as believers but i believe that
[49:24] that that is how that we we are moved to
[49:26] live in this hour and i i thank god for
[49:29] the promise that we have received in
[49:31] this hour where this promise has laid
[49:34] there and it has waited until this time
[49:37] and this season and now god comes along
[49:40] to begin to make this promise known and
[49:42] make it real to the church of the living
[49:45] god and i look at this this this
[49:48] statement here where paul would say
[49:49] we're not going to have you to be
[49:51] ignorant in other words there's an
[49:52] understanding that's coming to you in
[49:55] this hour because this is the hour for
[49:57] you to understand these things
[49:59] and he would also go on to announce that
[50:01] what we are speaking to you this is by
[50:04] the word of the lord so this is not
[50:08] man's contrived idea this is not
[50:10] something to make somebody feel good but
[50:12] there is a certainty in this and you
[50:15] know
[50:15] it's not something that god does to try
[50:18] to convince somebody but the word of the
[50:21] lord comes and there's a sounding within
[50:23] that word of certainty of his voice and
[50:26] his presence that it just does something
[50:28] to the heart of the believer to bring
[50:30] them a comfort and a stability and a
[50:33] certainty that they can look at the
[50:34] promises of god no matter what they're
[50:37] facing and whatever the need is in their
[50:39] life god will take his promise and make
[50:41] it so real before them till they have a
[50:44] confidence to go after that promise and
[50:47] call that promise their own
[50:50] oh my our courage does not come from any
[50:53] other source than from the lord himself
[50:57] and so when we see this this is why
[50:59] where the scripture would say comfort
[51:01] one another with these words to console
[51:04] one another to encourage one another and
[51:06] as i said last week but when i think of
[51:09] the consolation and the strength and the
[51:11] encouragement comfort one another with
[51:13] these words i i can just only say it in
[51:16] this way that we might comfort one
[51:18] another with these vindicated words in
[51:21] this hour the message of the hour this
[51:24] is the comfort to the church of the
[51:27] living god it's that that even at times
[51:29] that we don't know what to do in a
[51:32] situation in our life and we're like the
[51:34] shunamite woman but we know if i can
[51:37] just get to my absolute now the absolute
[51:40] is not the flesh of the prophet but the
[51:42] absolute is the revelation that came
[51:45] through that and through that life and
[51:47] that's why when we can look there in the
[51:50] word of god we are not reading the bible
[51:52] with our own understanding or the
[51:54] understanding of a man that's been down
[51:57] through the ages there's been
[51:58] presumptions there's been studies here
[52:01] and studies there but in order for there
[52:03] to come a strength and a power in the
[52:06] church to bring about rapturing faith it
[52:08] would take god himself to come down and
[52:11] vindicate his word and not the thoughts
[52:14] of a man to come but the thoughts of
[52:16] almighty god no wonder brother branham
[52:18] would call out in the hour when he would
[52:20] preach falling apart again of this world
[52:23] and say what we need is a message with
[52:26] the messiahship of christ upon it we
[52:29] need it with a living god that he would
[52:31] stamp his his his own presence his life
[52:34] upon it and is that not what we're
[52:36] promised in revelations chapter 3 it
[52:40] would say thus saith thee amen the
[52:42] soviet of god this is the hour where the
[52:46] amen of god is speaking in this moment
[52:50] and what a privilege we have for in the
[52:52] book of isaiah what promises for them
[52:55] who bless themselves in the god of the
[52:58] amen and that's when we're finding our
[53:01] comfort and our strength so there's no
[53:03] other source of comfort in this hour
[53:06] the order of this rapture has been
[53:08] revealed to this generation it's sure
[53:11] it's been probed at in other times but
[53:14] then this hour is where it is revealed
[53:17] and the prophet would declare to us when
[53:19] we read the scriptures when we see the
[53:22] lord himself shall descend from heaven
[53:25] with a shout with a voice and with the
[53:27] trump all three things he does while
[53:30] he's descending and they're they're all
[53:33] in folds and increments of time and the
[53:36] first thing that he does is to shout i
[53:38] know for many this is familiar territory
[53:41] and the shout itself is a gathering of
[53:44] the people of god that shout is a
[53:46] message now notice brother branham would
[53:48] take us in the message the rapture and
[53:51] he would speak about the signs and
[53:53] wonders and the miracles that were being
[53:55] done in that hour and truly there is no
[53:58] denying of the ministry that god sent in
[54:02] this generation as a matter of fact
[54:04] brother branham would take it in the
[54:05] message token and he would say jesus
[54:08] christ had more success in the ministry
[54:11] he gave me than the ministry he had in
[54:13] galilee you see it's the same god it was
[54:17] god working in the body of jesus christ
[54:20] there it's the same god working in the
[54:22] body of jesus christ now it's god moving
[54:25] on the scene to bring the faith of his
[54:28] children into a level of rapture and god
[54:31] that's not given that to a church to do
[54:34] that a man to do that but the lord
[54:36] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[54:40] shout let me tell you something this
[54:42] message is not a thing of instability
[54:45] this message is not a wondering and a
[54:47] happening this message is jesus christ
[54:50] revealed i want to remind you satan was
[54:53] kicked out and the bible refers to it in
[54:56] revelations 9 he fell a star fell from
[54:59] heaven lucifer fell but not god god
[55:03] descends down it's under control what is
[55:06] it it's the anointing of the word of god
[55:09] in this hour to bring supreme and
[55:11] complete control by the anointing of the
[55:14] word
[55:15] the order of the rapture revealed to us
[55:18] in this hour that that shout that
[55:20] message going out because beyond the
[55:23] signs and wonders there is a message to
[55:26] be given to the people
[55:29] see this is where this is where that
[55:32] that message that voice is to the elect
[55:39] any signs or wonders that are done we
[55:42] will want to know where's the voice
[55:43] behind it
[55:45] because listen
[55:46] there can be signs and wonders and there
[55:48] are that are outside
[55:52] but as the prophet told us if it's not
[55:55] taking you into the word
[55:57] it's a denominational affair
[56:00] when god gives a sign and wonder it's
[56:02] that there would be a voice behind it
[56:04] and it's the voice itself the sign gets
[56:07] your attention so you'll sit still and
[56:10] hear the voice but not many saw the sign
[56:13] and set still but you see when you set
[56:15] steel you recognize the oh my that this
[56:19] is god moving in the fulfillment of his
[56:21] word then you can take a hold of the
[56:23] promise they that wait on the lord shall
[56:27] renew their strength this is the hour
[56:30] that god has given a renewal to the
[56:33] church of the living god by pouring out
[56:36] his own strength into the bride of jesus
[56:38] christ
[56:42] it's time to leave
[56:44] so we recognize that this message this
[56:47] is a shout it's a it's an assembling
[56:49] that that draws the people of god
[56:52] together now you know when we look at
[56:55] that i in many places i could go with
[56:56] that but i i want to just stay focused
[56:58] here with it that the shout itself it's
[57:01] a message that's getting the people
[57:02] together the living bread of life
[57:06] which what is the living bread of life
[57:08] it is the holy ghost
[57:11] is that right he is that bread that came
[57:14] down from heaven
[57:16] oh my it's not just an anointing it's
[57:18] the anointing of the word in this hour
[57:21] when we speak about the baptism of the
[57:23] holy ghost we are speaking about the
[57:25] anointing of the word that when the holy
[57:27] ghost has come into a life of a believer
[57:30] it directs us right into the word of god
[57:33] it doesn't take us away from the word it
[57:35] doesn't give us a big head it comes to
[57:38] direct us right into the word of god
[57:42] amen
[57:43] so when we look at it
[57:45] we were we were looking at and at first
[57:48] that's only it's four and i referred
[57:50] last week to how when brother brown
[57:52] would preach the message the rapture
[57:54] and he would take psalms 27 and i'm not
[57:58] going to read psalms 27 this morning for
[58:00] sake of time but brother branham would
[58:03] read psalms 27 as the text for the
[58:06] rapture
[58:08] you know because and he says it like
[58:10] this he says for a background now a
[58:13] background i will read this to you a
[58:15] background is that of events that serve
[58:19] as the scenery
[58:21] the setting
[58:23] the circumstances that are prevailing at
[58:27] a particular time that underlie a
[58:30] particular event
[58:32] now to understand it the background is
[58:35] not the focus
[58:36] if you ever went to a play or you know
[58:38] something you read or you watch you
[58:40] don't go home and talking about the
[58:41] background
[58:44] you you talk about the main event the
[58:47] characters that were there let me say
[58:50] this there's a lot of characters a lot
[58:52] of actors on stage
[58:54] there's a lot of players right now that
[58:57] have to be and in their position
[59:00] for the vision to fully come to pass
[59:02] but the other players listen to me now
[59:05] and actors they are part of the
[59:07] background
[59:09] that which is in the foreground is the
[59:12] and the focus is christ in his bride
[59:16] has the prophet could put it like this
[59:18] in things that ought to be he said the
[59:20] bride is the manifestation of the hour
[59:24] she is the living oracle of almighty god
[59:28] you know what that says that we are a
[59:31] creation of god and not a creation of a
[59:34] man we've not been schooled into this
[59:36] message we have been birthed into this
[59:39] word by the presence of the living god
[59:42] my
[59:43] my my my
[59:44] so we know that this background this is
[59:47] not what we focus on but when you see
[59:50] the background
[59:51] david would even prophesy you know
[59:54] the things coming against us
[59:56] enemies coming in
[59:58] to to consume us things that would come
[1:00:00] your way to try to swallow you up
[1:00:04] tests trials circumstances even things
[1:00:06] that we in ourselves made some bad
[1:00:08] choices
[1:00:09] but things would come around and the
[1:00:11] enemy's objective is to try to swallow
[1:00:14] you up
[1:00:15] to consume you
[1:00:16] and if it is just our strength based on
[1:00:20] our flesh alone he would have consumed
[1:00:22] us a long time ago
[1:00:25] are you hearing me because he can come
[1:00:26] in and eat on our flesh you say how do
[1:00:28] you mean by eating our flesh remember
[1:00:31] this right here is the serpent's meat
[1:00:34] come on now book of isaiah this is this
[1:00:37] is the serpent's meat right here this
[1:00:39] thing will always side against the word
[1:00:40] of god very quickly it's not an ally
[1:00:45] this thing is not not an ally that's why
[1:00:47] you've got to have the holy ghost to
[1:00:49] rule over it and bring it in subjection
[1:00:54] is that right if you take in thoughts
[1:00:55] and entertain thoughts then there's a
[1:00:57] war that starts with all sorts of
[1:01:00] propaganda that can come your way but
[1:01:02] the thing is it's not how long the war
[1:01:04] goes on but stop it when you hear the
[1:01:07] war starting when a thought comes in and
[1:01:09] it's not according to the word of god
[1:01:11] you stop that thought bringing in
[1:01:13] subjection to the word of almighty god
[1:01:16] you're not meant to be a trash can you
[1:01:19] weren't meant to be a receptacle of the
[1:01:21] devil you are a temple of the living car
[1:01:24] to be filled with his thoughts with his
[1:01:27] glory with his power
[1:01:31] hallelujah all these things around us
[1:01:36] things pressures
[1:01:37] all around us
[1:01:38] but david said here's how i'm i'm
[1:01:41] dealing with this the lord's the
[1:01:42] strength of my life he's the light of my
[1:01:45] life
[1:01:49] david could your light be blown out
[1:01:51] depends on what light you're talking
[1:01:52] about if you're talking about the light
[1:01:54] in my spirit that can get blown out with
[1:01:57] storms and winds coming by but if you're
[1:02:00] talking about the lord is the light of
[1:02:01] my life i didn't like that and that's
[1:02:04] not a lie that is man-made or can be
[1:02:06] blown out with winds of tests and trials
[1:02:09] that it should kind of light on the
[1:02:10] inside that even when i'm at my lowest
[1:02:13] yet there is a light and a presence on
[1:02:15] the inside that is greater than my
[1:02:17] thoughts it's greater than my abilities
[1:02:20] what is it the lord is the light of my
[1:02:23] life
[1:02:25] oh hallelujah
[1:02:27] one thing i've desired and that's what
[1:02:29] i'm going to seek after
[1:02:31] that is my objective david what's going
[1:02:33] to be your focus in this hour i am going
[1:02:35] to dwell in the house of the lord
[1:02:37] now david wasn't just talking about
[1:02:39] coming to church
[1:02:40] part of it but david is dealing with i
[1:02:43] want to dwell in his presence
[1:02:47] oh my
[1:02:48] david knows he will come when he's
[1:02:51] invited that's why david could say i
[1:02:53] have longed to see thy power and glory
[1:02:57] as i seen manifested in thy sanctuary
[1:03:00] you see david was prophesying of a time
[1:03:04] to where that the power and the glory of
[1:03:07] almighty god would not just be something
[1:03:09] that would be in the tabernacle but it
[1:03:12] would be with man anointing man in man
[1:03:15] living through man and so the power and
[1:03:18] glory would be veiled in a people
[1:03:22] who glory be to god so in the time of
[1:03:24] trouble
[1:03:25] the promise is this is what he'll do
[1:03:28] and everything in that scripture of what
[1:03:30] he does
[1:03:36] what he does
[1:03:37] now he don't do it without our
[1:03:38] permission
[1:03:40] he don't do it without our yielding
[1:03:43] you see what brings calm and peace to
[1:03:46] the believer
[1:03:48] is his presence
[1:03:52] his presence and what does it do it
[1:03:54] brings a yielding about in our life
[1:03:57] then what he has ordained to do
[1:03:59] he comes and accomplishes that
[1:04:02] he comes and he hides us in his pavilion
[1:04:05] he hides us in the secret of his
[1:04:07] tabernacle
[1:04:09] that he shall set me up on a rock and
[1:04:11] notice what with the power of position
[1:04:14] that is given you see when david is
[1:04:16] writing this under anointing he is
[1:04:18] speaking of a group of people that would
[1:04:21] come in the last days has adopted sons
[1:04:24] and daughters of god that would be
[1:04:26] positioned by almighty god in christ are
[1:04:30] you hearing me this morning that it
[1:04:31] would not be man positioning themselves
[1:04:34] it wouldn't be man like you know the
[1:04:35] latter rain movements and all no no it
[1:04:37] would be god himself coming down and
[1:04:40] bringing an adoption upon his children
[1:04:43] just like he did on matthew 17 when
[1:04:46] jesus took peter james and john up there
[1:04:49] there was an adoption ceremony that was
[1:04:52] being performed that's why the adoption
[1:04:54] cannot come outside of the revealed word
[1:04:57] of the hour
[1:04:59] is that right now notice this here look
[1:05:02] look at the glory of being in position
[1:05:04] it didn't being upon a rock you see all
[1:05:07] this right here
[1:05:09] david didn't say well he just took it
[1:05:11] all away
[1:05:12] he made everything just you know peachy
[1:05:14] cream and smooth and mine was just like
[1:05:16] the most light and fluffiest buttercream
[1:05:18] every day became a whipped cream day
[1:05:22] come on friend that's not what he wrote
[1:05:24] but this this is how god deals with in
[1:05:28] the midst of chaos and disorder but you
[1:05:31] see god is not interested in trying to
[1:05:33] hear me he's not interested in trying to
[1:05:36] bring order to this world you can never
[1:05:39] bring order to this world but god will
[1:05:42] bring order and desperate order and
[1:05:44] haspering order and will bring order to
[1:05:46] the sons and daughters of god because
[1:05:49] they can be touched and hear the word of
[1:05:51] god and respond to it
[1:05:54] so it doesn't stop everything else
[1:05:56] that's going on around us
[1:05:58] it doesn't stop the background the
[1:06:01] background is there and the background
[1:06:03] is not a pleasant time the black what
[1:06:05] david describes here is not pleasant
[1:06:07] things going on it's not a picnic
[1:06:10] all kinds of battles test trials mind
[1:06:12] battles on and on and on that's all
[1:06:14] around but he says now because he's been
[1:06:16] set up on a rock notice verse 6 and now
[1:06:19] notice and now
[1:06:21] because of this now
[1:06:23] shall my head be lifted up above my
[1:06:27] enemies round about me notice the
[1:06:29] enemies are still there but my head has
[1:06:32] been lifted up above them they are not
[1:06:35] the focus it is not what i'm indulging
[1:06:37] in it's not what i'm looking at because
[1:06:40] i tell you if i focus on my enemies fear
[1:06:44] can try to overtake me but now i'm set
[1:06:47] up on a rock and because of being in
[1:06:49] this place i can look above my enemies
[1:06:54] my enemies don't go away but i can look
[1:06:56] above
[1:06:58] my enemies
[1:06:59] therefore david what you're going to do
[1:07:02] well i will offer in the tabernacle
[1:07:04] sacrifices of joy
[1:07:09] this is talking about real joy
[1:07:12] not a joy the world brings
[1:07:15] joy the world brings let's just speak
[1:07:17] plain today the joy that the world
[1:07:18] brings is hey they got gas gas is real
[1:07:21] cheap right now what the water puts
[1:07:22] price on it 525 whoa that's real cheap
[1:07:27] joy that the world brings
[1:07:30] but that's not you see everybody's got
[1:07:32] joy
[1:07:34] but this joy right here is a joy that
[1:07:37] the world can't give you
[1:07:39] this is the joy of the lord this is the
[1:07:42] same joy that jesus prophesied and
[1:07:45] announced to the disciples the joy that
[1:07:48] i will give you no man can take away
[1:07:50] from you no tests no trial no demon no
[1:07:54] discouragement nothing can take away
[1:07:56] this joy from your life but as a matter
[1:07:59] of fact you will draw strength from this
[1:08:01] joy because it is a source of life of
[1:08:05] living water inside of you when you're
[1:08:07] down when you're discouraged when you
[1:08:09] feel dry you still have a well a joy to
[1:08:13] draw from
[1:08:15] oh my we are not tapped into a broken
[1:08:18] sister we are living from the living
[1:08:21] fountain of the word of god in this hour
[1:08:25] so david could see
[1:08:27] this great sovereignty of god
[1:08:30] in a place of safety
[1:08:32] it's god that has placed us there
[1:08:35] now i'ma think of this here
[1:08:37] and i want to read this this statement
[1:08:39] to you
[1:08:40] out of second-handed robot i don't have
[1:08:41] this up i just just going to refer to
[1:08:43] places in here
[1:08:45] you know thinking about the calling and
[1:08:46] the choosing and the election of god
[1:08:48] that's what brother brown is talking
[1:08:49] about in this quote
[1:08:51] and he's talking about how we can't make
[1:08:52] one hair
[1:08:53] black or white
[1:08:55] we can't add you know one cubit to our
[1:08:56] stature
[1:08:59] here's what he says in regards to that
[1:09:02] he said i'd be a discouraged man this
[1:09:04] morning
[1:09:05] if i didn't believe in the election and
[1:09:07] calling of god
[1:09:09] if i thought that this world
[1:09:11] was left to the outcome by the power of
[1:09:14] man and by the wisdom of man and by the
[1:09:17] big force and the uns whoever who never
[1:09:20] even mentioned god's name
[1:09:22] i'd be a discouraged person but i'm not
[1:09:25] looking to that for the outcome
[1:09:30] not focused on the background
[1:09:33] tuned in to the main event
[1:09:37] oh he said i look down in the pages of
[1:09:39] this old book here where god wrote it
[1:09:41] out and everything will come out just
[1:09:42] exactly the way he said it that's all so
[1:09:44] the only thing for me to do is not to
[1:09:47] line up with them
[1:09:48] but line up with calvary
[1:09:51] line up with god line up with his word
[1:09:54] stay in his word no matter how much it
[1:09:57] looks like it could be this way it's
[1:09:59] going to be the way god intends it to be
[1:10:03] it can't be nothing else for him being
[1:10:05] infinite know the end from the beginning
[1:10:07] and he makes everything come to his
[1:10:10] praises notice brother brown quotes all
[1:10:12] things will have to work together
[1:10:14] everything will have to shape right up
[1:10:16] to its place my he said if that wouldn't
[1:10:18] make the courage in a christian nothing
[1:10:21] can go wrong after all it's not our
[1:10:23] battle it's his it's not our wisdom it's
[1:10:26] his the only one thing we had to do is
[1:10:29] put our faith and trust there and set
[1:10:31] still and see the glory of the lord and
[1:10:34] how it moves around to its place every
[1:10:36] wheel moving it may be scattered from
[1:10:39] side to side but it'll move right into
[1:10:41] its right place when god speaks the word
[1:10:45] now in psalm 62 verse 5.
[1:10:50] psalm 62 verse 5 this is where brother
[1:10:52] bannon would take his
[1:10:54] text in the message shalom i wa notice
[1:10:56] the words my soul
[1:10:58] wait thou only upon god i think it's
[1:11:01] fitting not my spirit
[1:11:04] you see because in our spirit is also
[1:11:06] our mind our thoughts
[1:11:09] but my soul let the mind of christ be in
[1:11:12] us as it was in christ jesus my soul
[1:11:16] wait thou only upon god for my
[1:11:19] expectation is from him
[1:11:22] so who has given us this expectation
[1:11:25] rapture healing deliverance the baptism
[1:11:27] of the holy ghost who gave us that
[1:11:29] expectation that expectation has come
[1:11:32] from him
[1:11:34] he only verse six is my rock and my
[1:11:38] salvation
[1:11:39] he is my defense i shall not be moved in
[1:11:44] god notice in god is my salvation and my
[1:11:48] glory the rock of my strength and my
[1:11:51] refuge is in god
[1:11:55] it's a very key point when you you look
[1:11:57] around in lives and see stability it's
[1:12:00] not because the person has some great
[1:12:02] dna or great genes and boy if i can only
[1:12:05] be like them no you're looking at the
[1:12:06] wrong thing but to see the reality is
[1:12:09] there is a rock that is there or paul
[1:12:11] would call it in this term an anchor
[1:12:14] that absolutely stabilizes us in the
[1:12:18] midst of every situation it isn't that a
[1:12:20] person that's on a rock doesn't get
[1:12:22] discouraged we do get discouraged we can
[1:12:25] get down the pressures do come but there
[1:12:28] is a rock or an anchor that we are
[1:12:31] tapped into by the grace of god so it's
[1:12:34] not our strength it's his strength
[1:12:38] he's the stability of our life
[1:12:40] notice this
[1:12:42] in psalm 62 8 the next scripture trust
[1:12:45] in him
[1:12:46] at all times
[1:12:50] it's easy to trust when it's when you
[1:12:52] know when everything seems to be just
[1:12:53] right but the scripture says at all
[1:12:56] times
[1:12:58] not trust on trust in him
[1:13:01] it's speaking of the hour of the
[1:13:04] believer in this time to be trusting in
[1:13:06] him you know it's just like i spoke to
[1:13:08] one of my neighbors here last year you
[1:13:10] know and and they were they were talking
[1:13:11] to me and even the year before we had
[1:13:14] talked and they were talking about all
[1:13:15] this was going on with the pandemic and
[1:13:16] things like that so i was just waiting
[1:13:18] to see if i get my foot in the door so i
[1:13:19] can you know begin to kind of talk and
[1:13:21] identify some things well we didn't get
[1:13:23] to that point but but even last year
[1:13:26] coming along this was his statement that
[1:13:28] he made very fine man really good
[1:13:30] neighbors i really really love him
[1:13:31] appreciate him but this is his statement
[1:13:33] that he made he said i knew sometime
[1:13:35] along the line he said i told my wife
[1:13:36] it'll be all right america will get it
[1:13:38] figured out well you know it's a miracle
[1:13:40] we'll get this thing figured out you
[1:13:42] know the vaccines coming out there now
[1:13:44] look where their certainty is because
[1:13:46] the year before that i talked to him he
[1:13:49] was looking at he said you know you
[1:13:50] begin to think is this the end of it all
[1:13:52] well i started to lay certain things in
[1:13:53] but couldn't get real far you know with
[1:13:56] that but to think of it that people have
[1:13:58] such a confidence in
[1:14:00] in in america or they have a confidence
[1:14:02] in certain things and truly this nation
[1:14:04] itself is that of the greatest or was of
[1:14:07] the greatest of the free world when when
[1:14:09] you really consider it and look at it
[1:14:11] how that it was started and all that but
[1:14:13] now she's fallen
[1:14:15] she rejected the gospel
[1:14:18] the things that we are seeing now even
[1:14:20] with the hippies that are in control the
[1:14:22] same things that we are seeing right now
[1:14:24] you know where that all started that
[1:14:26] started years and years and years and
[1:14:28] years ago even the feminist movement
[1:14:31] many of them a couple couple years ago
[1:14:32] when i was going back and researching a
[1:14:34] lot of it a lot of the feminist movement
[1:14:36] and seed started clear back in the 1800s
[1:14:39] and a lot of those things that led to
[1:14:41] the sexual revolution and all those
[1:14:43] things everything the debauchery within
[1:14:45] the nation and things that would come
[1:14:47] about to where they won't even allow
[1:14:49] prayer in school i i just read a news
[1:14:52] article here the other day of
[1:14:54] of one of the school uh school teams
[1:14:56] here in ohio down around the amish
[1:14:58] country area where you know they got on
[1:15:00] them about you know you shouldn't have
[1:15:02] been praying out there and and you know
[1:15:03] leading them in prayer and i thought
[1:15:05] about it you know you you think that
[1:15:07] america you listen to them on the
[1:15:08] newscast and how they're wondering
[1:15:10] they'll talk about russia and run them
[1:15:12] down i find you guys you've got such uh
[1:15:15] uh you know a false impression such a a
[1:15:19] thought of a past reputation and they're
[1:15:21] counting on that they're looking at that
[1:15:24] my goodness putin doesn't need a whole
[1:15:26] military men he's got nukes right there
[1:15:29] it wouldn't have even lasted this long
[1:15:31] if he'd have pulled the button
[1:15:34] are you hearing me
[1:15:36] but it's such a false security in this
[1:15:39] hour that people are secure and yet
[1:15:41] they'll look at it well we're a
[1:15:43] christian nation we are no longer a
[1:15:45] christian nation they forsook that when
[1:15:48] they forsook the gospel of jesus christ
[1:15:51] and remember the gospel of jesus christ
[1:15:54] is not the bible the gospel is the holy
[1:15:58] ghost the word that has been written
[1:16:00] made manifest they rejected the place of
[1:16:04] safety and salvation and because of that
[1:16:07] they are turned to themselves the bible
[1:16:09] says that nation that rejects god has
[1:16:11] turned to hell
[1:16:13] that's the bible right
[1:16:15] so we know that even in this time of
[1:16:17] where we see things you know prayer
[1:16:19] taken out of school and everything
[1:16:21] amazed me even when i was teaching
[1:16:23] things that they wanted to try you know
[1:16:25] to control kids and oh this is going on
[1:16:28] this is going on you know and and they
[1:16:30] want to try to mitigate things well you
[1:16:32] know you can't say that it's anything
[1:16:34] you know because of the parents or this
[1:16:35] or that you can't do any of that well
[1:16:37] nobody was trying to pass the buck but
[1:16:39] you know they're trying to harness
[1:16:41] things and deal with things through
[1:16:43] education that's the god of this world
[1:16:47] and whether you realize it or not
[1:16:49] communism isn't over there the prophet
[1:16:51] announced it this this very america is
[1:16:54] honeycombed with communism
[1:16:57] it may not look like the form of that
[1:17:00] which is on display over there but let
[1:17:02] me tell you something it has within it
[1:17:04] the same cruel things
[1:17:06] some of the things that we saw being
[1:17:08] made manifest even in this past year
[1:17:10] with groups uprising and marching and
[1:17:13] all the things they've done you know
[1:17:15] what it is that's a form of communism
[1:17:17] remember there's the three isms there's
[1:17:19] fascism marxism and it all ends up into
[1:17:22] communism
[1:17:25] brother brown tells us she said it'll
[1:17:27] all come to a place to where the
[1:17:29] churches will they will come together to
[1:17:32] try to fight against this communism
[1:17:37] uh my mama i can't go into depth on all
[1:17:39] of that because i really see it to be uh
[1:17:42] you know in many different ways and many
[1:17:44] different levels i believe that the
[1:17:46] conservatives if you could call it that
[1:17:47] in this country would so unite together
[1:17:50] around things which you know we don't
[1:17:52] want to see those things people tearing
[1:17:54] down statues and everything else and you
[1:17:56] know all that all that type of nonsense
[1:17:57] that's going on but all that is because
[1:18:00] they've rejected god
[1:18:03] we're seeing the effects of it of people
[1:18:06] coming under the spirit of destruction
[1:18:08] in this hour
[1:18:11] it's a sad thing because what they need
[1:18:14] they really need to meet jesus christ
[1:18:19] but because the church has failed them
[1:18:22] god never failed them but the church has
[1:18:24] failed them
[1:18:28] trust in god at all times
[1:18:32] now notice this achievement that has
[1:18:35] taken place upon the earth you know
[1:18:37] brother brown would say in the message
[1:18:39] three kinds of believers he said that
[1:18:40] ought to be the achievement of every
[1:18:43] believer this afternoon the achievement
[1:18:45] of every believer is that god is able to
[1:18:48] keep every word that he said he would do
[1:18:53] every word that no matter what
[1:18:54] circumstances rise god is able to keep
[1:18:58] his word
[1:18:59] friends we are we are standing in a
[1:19:01] moment in this hour of a rapture and we
[1:19:03] recognize there has already been two
[1:19:05] other
[1:19:06] raptures is that right
[1:19:09] even here in the new testament but we
[1:19:11] recognize within that it will take just
[1:19:13] as it did then it took faith to bring
[1:19:16] rapture in that time
[1:19:19] and god's the one who brought faith in
[1:19:22] order to bring rapture in that time and
[1:19:26] in that season
[1:19:27] so here we are living in this moment
[1:19:30] the church in itself how many times did
[1:19:32] your brother ram say over and over he
[1:19:34] said the church is in no condition to
[1:19:37] finish out the great commission that god
[1:19:40] gave to the church because god never
[1:19:42] intended for the church to carry the
[1:19:44] word god intended for the holy ghost to
[1:19:48] pack the message the word on the inside
[1:19:51] of the believer
[1:19:53] so there had to come a time to where the
[1:19:56] holy spirit would return to the church
[1:19:58] in order to finish up the great
[1:20:00] commission of that of redemption now he
[1:20:03] goes on to make the statement in that
[1:20:05] same message and he says the reason he
[1:20:07] says that i believe he says of this time
[1:20:10] that when the bride is called out and
[1:20:12] elected and set in the book of light now
[1:20:14] notice she's called out
[1:20:15] elected and set in the book of light
[1:20:18] notice the placing that will take place
[1:20:21] there will come a sound from heaven that
[1:20:23] will take such a baptism of the holy
[1:20:26] spirit into that bride that will take
[1:20:28] her from the earth in rapturing grace
[1:20:33] oh glory be to gods because you see
[1:20:36] there is a promise there is a heaven
[1:20:38] there is a literal jesus
[1:20:41] who is coming
[1:20:44] and to announce that he's here in the
[1:20:47] fullness of his word and his spirit
[1:20:50] right now
[1:20:52] that's the first part of the procession
[1:20:55] of him doing all three while he descends
[1:20:57] the shout
[1:20:59] now to see that within that david would
[1:21:02] also write in psalms 130 verse 5. notice
[1:21:04] how he writes this i wait for the lord
[1:21:09] that's a big statement
[1:21:10] i wait for the lord now you know the
[1:21:13] only way you can wait you've got to have
[1:21:14] faith
[1:21:17] you've got to have faith
[1:21:19] like the little woman who was promised
[1:21:22] by the the owner son of the ranch i will
[1:21:25] return to you in the spring and take you
[1:21:29] for my wife
[1:21:31] so that right there there was a faith
[1:21:34] that she operated by while they were
[1:21:36] apart she operated by faith in her life
[1:21:40] that brought about a waiting you know
[1:21:42] you you couldn't move her from that it
[1:21:44] didn't matter of all the scoffers it
[1:21:46] didn't matter all of those around there
[1:21:48] that looked better than she did maybe
[1:21:49] had everything else they were more
[1:21:51] beautiful and everything but he did not
[1:21:53] choose based on outward character he
[1:21:56] chose on what is real what is true and
[1:21:59] that's that inward character and she was
[1:22:02] waiting on him to come why because he
[1:22:05] said he would
[1:22:10] hallelujah i wait for the lord
[1:22:16] my soul
[1:22:18] doth wait oh
[1:22:20] this really narrows it down don't it
[1:22:22] my soul doth wait
[1:22:25] that's where the waiting really has to
[1:22:27] come from
[1:22:28] come on friends we can receive a real a
[1:22:31] word from god but look if our flesh we
[1:22:33] get to looking at it well look you feel
[1:22:35] worse today than you did before look at
[1:22:37] you that pain is coming back your flesh
[1:22:40] can quickly subside and move away from
[1:22:42] that but in the soul itself it waits on
[1:22:46] the lord it says wait a minute i'm not
[1:22:48] waiting for it's a feeling a sensation
[1:22:50] i'm waiting for the lord and the same
[1:22:53] god who confirmed that promise to me is
[1:22:56] the same god that will cause my body to
[1:22:59] come in subjection to the confession i
[1:23:02] have received and i'm living under
[1:23:05] my soul doth wait and in his word
[1:23:09] do i hope oh there is no greater place
[1:23:12] to be is there
[1:23:15] how's it going to be i don't know but he
[1:23:16] said so
[1:23:20] you know brother samuel that sounds a
[1:23:22] lot like abraham's seed that's exactly
[1:23:24] what abraham's seed is
[1:23:26] he said so
[1:23:28] that's the purpose of the word of god
[1:23:30] coming in this hour and the baptism of
[1:23:33] the holy ghost that's made visible
[1:23:35] before the people and coming into our
[1:23:37] lives is to bring a certainty in the
[1:23:40] life of the believer so when things rise
[1:23:43] up you can put your foot on that devil's
[1:23:46] neck and say i am certain of god
[1:23:54] hallelujah
[1:23:55] oh my my soul verse 6 waiteth for the
[1:23:59] lord
[1:24:05] more than
[1:24:09] they
[1:24:10] that watch
[1:24:12] for the morning
[1:24:17] i say
[1:24:18] more than they that watch for the
[1:24:20] morning
[1:24:22] now there's no doubt i'm speaking across
[1:24:24] this room no matter if you're young or
[1:24:25] old
[1:24:26] there's times we've had sleepless nights
[1:24:28] and we went to bed and we thought man
[1:24:30] i'm tired tonight and you realize you
[1:24:32] just crossed the boundaries there you
[1:24:35] overtired
[1:24:37] you better get that way you just get
[1:24:38] over time you're restless and you're
[1:24:39] looking at the clock at two o'clock
[1:24:41] three o'clock
[1:24:48] because we know i got to get to sleep
[1:24:49] morning's coming
[1:24:51] right
[1:24:52] well because we know hey morning's going
[1:24:54] to come for sure that that's one thing
[1:24:56] he got to be punched in at this certain
[1:24:58] time i've got i've got to get up
[1:24:59] morning's coming but david is speaking
[1:25:02] of something in his life that's more
[1:25:06] certain
[1:25:07] than the morning coming
[1:25:11] oh my my soul waited for the lord more
[1:25:15] than they that watched for the morning
[1:25:16] so to the believer
[1:25:18] the coming of the lord is more certain
[1:25:22] than the morning
[1:25:24] the coming of the lord is more certain
[1:25:27] than the next second on your watch the
[1:25:29] coming of the lord is more certain than
[1:25:31] the next minute hour day week month year
[1:25:34] it's more certain to you and you are
[1:25:38] looking more to it your expectation is
[1:25:42] more if we had a scale right here your
[1:25:44] expectation in the coming of the lord
[1:25:47] not that you don't have other
[1:25:48] expectations but you said this is the
[1:25:51] height of my expectation i'm expecting
[1:25:54] this more than this because this may
[1:25:57] never come but this right here the
[1:26:00] coming of the lord is certain
[1:26:03] can i preach for a minute the baptism of
[1:26:06] the holy ghost is more certain to you
[1:26:09] than the next second
[1:26:10] [Music]
[1:26:13] hallelujah
[1:26:15] the coming of the lord with healing
[1:26:17] virtue is more certain to you than the
[1:26:20] next hour
[1:26:23] what are you talking about the focus not
[1:26:25] the background
[1:26:31] oh brother branham he picks this up 1959
[1:26:35] who is this i'm just going to refer to
[1:26:37] it
[1:26:37] he's talking about how different things
[1:26:39] have come up israel becoming a nation
[1:26:41] all those things happening and how it
[1:26:42] paralleled there in his ministry and he
[1:26:45] says like this i want you to listen to
[1:26:47] these words in 1959 he said i don't see
[1:26:49] nothing at all left according to
[1:26:51] scripture
[1:26:52] of course
[1:26:53] there may there may be many things maybe
[1:26:56] the lord's not letting me know
[1:26:59] but i don't see nothing left but just
[1:27:00] the coming of the lord
[1:27:02] now see that's 1959 and you and i can
[1:27:04] look and say well you know the seals had
[1:27:06] to be open
[1:27:08] and this had to come about but you see
[1:27:09] it was more than just messages to be
[1:27:11] preached
[1:27:14] this is what when we have an insight
[1:27:16] into this right here the prophet has not
[1:27:18] brought a message to you and i because
[1:27:21] that is not how it was revealed and made
[1:27:22] known to him that it's a message of
[1:27:24] delay
[1:27:26] are you hearing me this is not a message
[1:27:29] of delay in other words you say what is
[1:27:31] a message of delay a message of delay is
[1:27:33] to push back his presence right now and
[1:27:36] looking for something to come that's
[1:27:38] already here right now to prepare us for
[1:27:41] the next moment
[1:27:44] so that results in a delay are you
[1:27:46] hearing me now can i preach a moment
[1:27:48] that's what can delay things coming in
[1:27:50] your life that's what can delay the
[1:27:52] coming of the lord in your life that's
[1:27:54] what can delay healing that's what can
[1:27:55] delay those things if you push away
[1:27:58] right now his presence that's trying to
[1:28:01] deal with things in your life and you're
[1:28:03] pushing away and you're waiting for
[1:28:05] something to come maybe i'll be at a
[1:28:07] camp meeting here maybe i'll be at a
[1:28:08] meeting there maybe i'll be at a meeting
[1:28:10] there remember the coming of the lord is
[1:28:13] a greater expectation than the morning
[1:28:16] coming
[1:28:17] we don't want to push it away but we
[1:28:19] want to stand in this hour that today is
[1:28:22] the day of salvation that this is the
[1:28:25] moment of my visitation right now i am
[1:28:29] part of this end time generation that
[1:28:31] this revelation has been waived over my
[1:28:35] life this reality has come has struck my
[1:28:38] heart
[1:28:39] [Music]
[1:28:41] delay no longer
[1:28:45] you see that's the urgency of the
[1:28:46] message time should be no more
[1:28:51] we're not living under a delay
[1:28:54] now i can't bring him from glory you
[1:28:57] can't bring him from glory
[1:28:58] i can't say rapture next minute that's
[1:29:00] not what it is but every promise that we
[1:29:03] are to take between now and the next
[1:29:06] moment
[1:29:07] there should be no delay
[1:29:10] i just say right now lord god all
[1:29:12] through this building my hands up
[1:29:13] included lord god take every bit of
[1:29:15] sluggishness out of our lives take every
[1:29:18] bit of delay out of our lives and let us
[1:29:20] operate not as people of the delay but
[1:29:22] people that are possessing the promises
[1:29:25] that god has given in this hour because
[1:29:28] that of the rapture is a possessed a
[1:29:31] promise that is possessed by the
[1:29:33] believers
[1:29:35] oh my
[1:29:37] notice he said i don't see one thing
[1:29:39] left according to the scripture of
[1:29:40] course there may be many things but the
[1:29:42] lord's not letting me know
[1:29:44] but i don't see nothing left
[1:29:46] but just the coming of the lord
[1:29:50] i mean we could go through this building
[1:29:51] and how many of us could think well we
[1:29:53] didn't think it would be here this year
[1:29:58] right
[1:29:59] but you see it it's how we live
[1:30:02] living in a manner it don't matter if he
[1:30:04] comes today
[1:30:05] tomorrow
[1:30:07] it don't matter
[1:30:08] and it's still joy
[1:30:11] it's joy brother say how can you say
[1:30:13] that look at everything that's going on
[1:30:15] in the world let me get to a minute i
[1:30:17] got a little prescription right here
[1:30:21] how can you say that
[1:30:23] you you it depends on where you're
[1:30:25] focused
[1:30:27] you know
[1:30:28] [Music]
[1:30:31] you see it's like this it's like you
[1:30:32] know
[1:30:33] sitting behind somebody in church i see
[1:30:35] some of you sometimes you you move out
[1:30:36] behind somebody you move in between a
[1:30:38] couple because maybe you can't see
[1:30:40] around the brother you know see you see
[1:30:41] over top of see you know you might be a
[1:30:43] little shorter i see you'll kind of get
[1:30:45] in position kind of squeeze through so
[1:30:46] you can see why it means just something
[1:30:48] about it you want to see maybe whoever
[1:30:50] is ministering up here and it isn't that
[1:30:52] you're focused upon them but you just
[1:30:53] want to see it right
[1:30:56] and you're trying to move around and get
[1:30:57] in position
[1:30:58] well you and i were not in position to
[1:31:01] see the coming of the lord in the right
[1:31:03] way
[1:31:06] it wouldn't matter we didn't have enough
[1:31:07] strength because it was not in our
[1:31:09] ability or we were not gifted to catch
[1:31:12] that you see god works in a way so that
[1:31:15] it takes one thing to cause the reaction
[1:31:18] in something else brother adam described
[1:31:20] it as a prophet in this age i believe
[1:31:22] it's impersonation of christianity he
[1:31:24] said that a prophet in this season a
[1:31:26] prophet is one who is designed to go
[1:31:29] beyond the realm of emotion beyond the
[1:31:32] realm of music beyond all those other
[1:31:34] realms and climb up into the realms of
[1:31:37] god and to see where we need to be and
[1:31:40] then come back down here and tell us he
[1:31:42] also said that a prophet is one who can
[1:31:44] stand there and he has strength to pull
[1:31:47] himself up on the fence to see what's
[1:31:50] going on in the circus and come back in
[1:31:53] and tell the other people
[1:31:56] oh my now you see in order for that to
[1:31:59] are you hearing me now in order for that
[1:32:01] to be believed in order for that to be
[1:32:03] true then that revelation of who that is
[1:32:07] in that hour has got to be confirmed to
[1:32:09] you you see it's got to be confirmed in
[1:32:12] your heart that this message is not a
[1:32:14] message of a man it's not an extension
[1:32:16] of pentecost it's not a it's not like
[1:32:18] moody it's not like calvin it's not like
[1:32:21] any of them it is the message of the
[1:32:23] hour that god promised a full
[1:32:25] restoration in this time back to the
[1:32:29] original baptism of the holy ghost and
[1:32:32] when that revelation is caught then it
[1:32:34] stops the questioning of the prophet's
[1:32:37] words
[1:32:42] because this is why think of it the
[1:32:43] message the rapture brother braham said
[1:32:45] prophecy two or three are to judge that
[1:32:48] in the church
[1:32:49] but he said nobody sets before a prophet
[1:32:52] to correct him
[1:32:55] that's rapture condition
[1:32:58] a person may not understand it but god
[1:33:01] has not entrusted any man
[1:33:03] to correct the prophet of god
[1:33:07] because if you want to talk about
[1:33:08] correction they could have hung jesus
[1:33:12] what do you mean
[1:33:14] eat the flesh of the son of man and
[1:33:16] drink his blood they could have taken
[1:33:18] you back to their bible to their quotes
[1:33:20] to their scriptures and they could have
[1:33:22] said moses said that you're not to eat
[1:33:24] the blood you're not to eat that because
[1:33:26] in the blood is the life which is the
[1:33:28] atonement but you see to the believer
[1:33:31] though they couldn't explain it but yet
[1:33:33] they believed it
[1:33:35] it was something about it that was
[1:33:37] taking a hold in their life that had
[1:33:39] already even though that hadn't lifted
[1:33:42] them into the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:33:44] but it had already taken a hold of their
[1:33:47] lives that they knew that this is the
[1:33:49] promise that god made through moses
[1:33:54] brother samuel what are you saying i'm
[1:33:55] saying that that's the kind of faith and
[1:33:58] reality that must be in the hearts of
[1:34:01] the believer
[1:34:04] because god sent this message with you
[1:34:07] and me in mind
[1:34:10] this message is not about brother
[1:34:12] branham
[1:34:13] this message is of jesus christ and his
[1:34:16] righteousness it is to announce that the
[1:34:19] bride is not coming she's here
[1:34:22] [Applause]
[1:34:28] my mama
[1:34:32] i feel like saying whatever he said amen
[1:34:36] let me try to finish this quote
[1:34:40] i don't see nothing at all left
[1:34:42] according to the scripture of course
[1:34:43] there's many things maybe the lord's not
[1:34:45] letting me know
[1:34:46] but i don't see nothing left but just
[1:34:48] the coming of the lord now watch this
[1:34:50] oh he said how i i just like to check up
[1:34:54] and you get to reading in the papers and
[1:34:56] listening to the newscasts
[1:35:01] now you know right now sister reed if i
[1:35:03] read something right here right now if i
[1:35:05] read after this and say and you get to
[1:35:07] reading the papers and listening to the
[1:35:08] newscast and boy your faith just grows
[1:35:11] and it just strengthened you would know
[1:35:13] right now say you're lying
[1:35:15] i know her well enough she'd say it
[1:35:17] you're lying that is not what it is
[1:35:19] because i know
[1:35:21] newscasts and newspapers and this doctor
[1:35:24] and whatever more they don't build faith
[1:35:28] now watch this is the prophet right here
[1:35:30] speaking he says now i like to check up
[1:35:34] just like no doubt probably some of you
[1:35:35] have been watching the events and things
[1:35:37] like that like i have little videos here
[1:35:38] and there and watching this reading
[1:35:40] reports seeing the different things and
[1:35:41] believers in ukraine and all these
[1:35:43] things going on now notice what he says
[1:35:45] oh i just like to check up he says and
[1:35:47] you get to reading the papers and
[1:35:49] listening to newscasts it makes you real
[1:35:52] nervous
[1:35:54] and then
[1:35:55] you sit down and think
[1:35:57] before it can all happen
[1:36:00] we're going home
[1:36:08] we're saying he didn't tell us to be
[1:36:10] ignorant
[1:36:11] but the bible says when you see these
[1:36:14] things come to pass
[1:36:16] subscribe to that channel subscribe to
[1:36:19] that news feed subscribe to this
[1:36:21] subscribe to that no when you begin to
[1:36:23] see these things come to past
[1:36:27] lift up your head
[1:36:30] your redemption draweth
[1:36:33] not
[1:36:34] [Applause]
[1:36:41] isn't that wonderful
[1:36:44] and that's tremendous you can just put
[1:36:46] it all down and
[1:36:47] after it all when you get done with that
[1:36:49] newscast maybe some of you say you know
[1:36:51] what
[1:36:52] i don't need that feed on my phone
[1:36:55] because that type of stuff right there
[1:36:56] is feeding me with fear feeding me with
[1:36:58] wrong things feeding me with this
[1:36:59] feeding me come on friends
[1:37:02] you say brother samuel what are you
[1:37:03] talking about well let me just show and
[1:37:04] share with you the brothers that got
[1:37:05] together in ukraine you see the brothers
[1:37:07] can't go out for food and stuff it has
[1:37:09] to be the sisters make the runs outside
[1:37:11] of the places where they're at to go get
[1:37:13] the food
[1:37:15] so the sisters themselves because you
[1:37:17] know there's such a tightness within
[1:37:18] there all the men had to stay put
[1:37:21] and there's a lot of you know a lot of
[1:37:22] the russian soldiers that's actually got
[1:37:24] in there you've probably seen it this
[1:37:25] morning they just assassinated a man who
[1:37:27] went to the first peace talks on the
[1:37:28] side of ukraine but he's a double agent
[1:37:30] ukraine just assassinated him today
[1:37:33] now to all you have in russian soldiers
[1:37:36] and this is why the ukrainian brothers
[1:37:37] as they said you you can't go out and
[1:37:39] talk or trust anybody because you have a
[1:37:41] lot of russians that have infiltrated in
[1:37:43] plain clothes
[1:37:44] so you know you have the sisters they're
[1:37:46] the ones that have to go if they get
[1:37:47] money if money's to be withdrawn most of
[1:37:49] the money right now they're able to do
[1:37:50] everything by phone but if they go to do
[1:37:52] anything they got the sister's got to go
[1:37:53] out and and go take care of that and do
[1:37:55] it
[1:37:56] so the sisters
[1:37:58] they which would be natural who when
[1:38:00] where witness be natural or the sisters
[1:38:02] because of things that they were
[1:38:04] receiving and hearing from news that
[1:38:06] begin to be concerned like what's going
[1:38:07] to happen with our family what's going
[1:38:08] to happen with the kids and we're going
[1:38:10] to go into school and all those things
[1:38:12] right
[1:38:14] they begin to you know and so the very
[1:38:16] thing what wisdom that these brothers
[1:38:18] got together and you know in that time
[1:38:20] as they're gathering together the one
[1:38:22] thing that they made a decision of
[1:38:23] course you know everybody had to go
[1:38:24] along with it but was to do what cut off
[1:38:27] all of that
[1:38:31] now let me tell you something what they
[1:38:32] cut off
[1:38:33] and what they're feasting on is the word
[1:38:35] of the hour brother that ain't
[1:38:37] propaganda that's life
[1:38:39] [Music]
[1:38:40] propaganda will bring fear and
[1:38:42] uncertainty
[1:38:43] do we do this don't we don't do this do
[1:38:45] we do this do we don't do that do we do
[1:38:47] come on friends hey listen that's not
[1:38:49] just over there that's been right here
[1:38:52] right here in this nation right now
[1:38:56] you wait as things go on you wait as
[1:38:58] time goes on watch certain things will
[1:38:59] pop back up oh we need to watch out for
[1:39:02] this certain things it's all propaganda
[1:39:04] that's going on listen we're not
[1:39:05] conspiracy people are you hearing me but
[1:39:08] it's a reality in this hour that there
[1:39:10] is one focus that we have as the bride
[1:39:13] of jesus christ and that is in the
[1:39:15] coming of the lord and the promise is
[1:39:18] he's coming in my life today he's coming
[1:39:21] in my life tomorrow he's coming the next
[1:39:24] day if he tarries and one of these
[1:39:26] moments the coming of the lord a sweet
[1:39:29] will come over my life
[1:39:32] and we'll be changed in a moment
[1:39:35] and a twinkling of an eye
[1:39:44] right now
[1:39:45] i think that to be
[1:39:47] such admonition in this hour
[1:39:50] of things because the things that you
[1:39:52] read you look at you take in
[1:39:54] it's very important that we see because
[1:39:56] before it can all happen
[1:39:58] we're going home
[1:40:01] brother brown would say it in the
[1:40:02] message identification he says
[1:40:04] in my humble opinion 1963
[1:40:08] just in condition this world is just in
[1:40:10] condition for the coming of the lord the
[1:40:12] rapture the next thing
[1:40:14] and all that lacks could happen
[1:40:16] within an hour
[1:40:19] so for the church
[1:40:21] of the living god the next thing that
[1:40:23] we're looking for
[1:40:25] is the rapture
[1:40:27] oh brother tell me i'm looking for him
[1:40:29] to close the churches i'm not i'm
[1:40:31] looking for the rapture
[1:40:34] are you hearing me now oh i'm looking
[1:40:36] for this
[1:40:38] you better be looking for the rapture
[1:40:40] because if you're looking for the
[1:40:41] rapture you're right focused on the
[1:40:44] right thing you're not looking at
[1:40:45] background things and trying to make
[1:40:47] presumptions and put this together and
[1:40:50] put this together because the prophet
[1:40:51] himself even grew in understanding in
[1:40:54] the ministry on those things is that
[1:40:56] right
[1:40:57] so as we continue on and we're looking
[1:40:59] at those things now look when we
[1:41:01] recognize this is the very next thing
[1:41:03] that we're looking for is the rapture
[1:41:05] that's the promise
[1:41:07] that belongs to us as believers
[1:41:11] oh glory be to god that's why when
[1:41:13] brother bannon was asked a question in
[1:41:15] 1964 questions and answers brother
[1:41:17] branham will the church have to go
[1:41:20] through a persecution like the early
[1:41:22] church he said no sir the next thing is
[1:41:27] the rapture
[1:41:31] you say brother samuel what's the danger
[1:41:32] what's the danger and looking at
[1:41:34] anything else it's because you get your
[1:41:36] eyes off the lord jesus
[1:41:40] well our focus is in the coming of the
[1:41:42] lord the very next thing the very next
[1:41:44] thing that takes place is the very the
[1:41:46] chains of the bodies is to be waiting
[1:41:49] and looking for our loved ones to appear
[1:41:51] because the prophet tells us when they
[1:41:53] appear the scripture said they arise
[1:41:56] first and when they arise and we see
[1:41:59] them oh the rest of the world won't see
[1:42:01] them but we will see them
[1:42:04] and we'll know our change is on its way
[1:42:07] why we've been looking for that
[1:42:12] so we're not focused on the background
[1:42:16] we're focused on
[1:42:17] what's happening in the foreground
[1:42:21] this is why let me
[1:42:23] just try to get to a spot
[1:42:28] you didn't turn me off yet did you
[1:42:33] don't don't dial them things down on me
[1:42:39] there's just not enough services
[1:42:44] this is not enough time
[1:42:48] but when we see where we're at in this
[1:42:50] hour
[1:42:53] daniel interpreted the dream
[1:42:56] of nebuchadnezzar
[1:43:00] god gave nebuchadnezzar that dream
[1:43:03] and showed the end from the beginning
[1:43:07] oh i just feel him so wonderfully
[1:43:10] he gave it that dream to him
[1:43:13] and even though he had the dream
[1:43:16] he couldn't interpret it
[1:43:19] but the god who gave it
[1:43:22] had a channel upon earth
[1:43:25] that was there in that moment in that
[1:43:28] season that could interpret that dream
[1:43:33] and when he interpreted that dream
[1:43:35] remember it was calling
[1:43:37] death to come upon all of the the you
[1:43:40] know the astrologers and all them and
[1:43:41] the kingdom but it was daniel who would
[1:43:44] stand in the gap and daniel would stand
[1:43:47] there and say don't be so hasty
[1:43:49] there is a god in heaven who reveals
[1:43:52] these things let us ask for the mercies
[1:43:55] of god
[1:43:56] so daniel said i ain't got too big i
[1:44:00] still know my abcs and the way that i
[1:44:02] approach god for anything is prayer and
[1:44:05] fasting yes i'm sorry
[1:44:08] my position and what god has ordained me
[1:44:10] to be i know the little things that
[1:44:12] brought me here i stay with the little
[1:44:14] things i'll take that swing shot i'll
[1:44:17] stay with where god brought me from and
[1:44:19] i'll stay with prayer and fasting when
[1:44:22] things come up that i don't have the
[1:44:23] answer to i'll pray and i'll fast and i
[1:44:26] look to the god who is rich in mercy to
[1:44:29] reveal his secret of life to me
[1:44:35] daniel receives from god
[1:44:38] the the the the king had this
[1:44:42] he had the dream
[1:44:43] let me tell you something this has it
[1:44:45] tells the end from the beginning
[1:44:48] are you hearing me
[1:44:50] all those characteristics of those
[1:44:52] kingdoms that was described within that
[1:44:54] image it's all laid out right here and
[1:44:56] you can see that same spirit that wormed
[1:44:59] its way and worked through you know
[1:45:01] coming up under the name of a pagan rome
[1:45:04] and now into because it's been wormed
[1:45:05] all throughout all the nations
[1:45:08] are you with me what started out listen
[1:45:10] now what started out as an objective by
[1:45:13] nimrod after coming after the flood an
[1:45:15] objective to create a religion and
[1:45:17] objecting to be worshiped and objective
[1:45:20] for another another place another way
[1:45:22] remember what was once an objective is
[1:45:25] now in worship
[1:45:27] in the world
[1:45:29] is that right
[1:45:31] the god of this evil age is education
[1:45:37] satan is the god of this evil age
[1:45:40] brother branham would tell us and i
[1:45:41] think this is good for young people and
[1:45:43] everybody alike brother brown would say
[1:45:44] no he said i'm not against education
[1:45:47] but he said remember he said you go get
[1:45:49] what you need to get
[1:45:51] he said i'm not against reading and
[1:45:52] arithmetic and all those things like
[1:45:54] that he said but don't ever let
[1:45:55] education take the place of god
[1:46:00] come on friends you know there's things
[1:46:01] that come about in your life and there's
[1:46:03] a lot of things that come about as
[1:46:04] education the doctors can tell you this
[1:46:07] will happen and this will happen and
[1:46:08] that'll happen and you know what you can
[1:46:10] look at it not disrespecting that man
[1:46:12] but then you've got to make a choice are
[1:46:14] you going to take what that man has said
[1:46:16] education is the best and the far as his
[1:46:18] intellect can go education stops with
[1:46:21] the mind of man but remember the
[1:46:24] supernatural is of god it moves to do
[1:46:27] things that are thought to be impossible
[1:46:29] it supersedes the reasoning of man
[1:46:32] that's why the battle that we still face
[1:46:34] in this hour is a wisdom versus faith
[1:46:37] battle
[1:46:39] it's an age-old conflict
[1:46:41] and it comes at us are you hearing me
[1:46:45] in many different forms
[1:46:47] oh brother samuel i came out of
[1:46:49] denominationalism that don't mean that
[1:46:51] battle ain't still before you
[1:46:53] we've got to battle that every day and
[1:46:55] every moment of our life
[1:46:57] it'll come in every every sort of form
[1:47:00] and every sort of way
[1:47:03] is that right
[1:47:04] now notice this how that this image
[1:47:07] would be
[1:47:08] but daniel would receive that just like
[1:47:11] it he wouldn't do no good just to have
[1:47:13] that dream if there wasn't somebody that
[1:47:15] can interpret it
[1:47:18] but daniel couldn't know it
[1:47:20] only god could know it
[1:47:23] but daniel hadn't had faith in god
[1:47:27] you know why he knew god
[1:47:32] he just didn't know about god
[1:47:35] daniel wasn't in babylon facing this
[1:47:38] moment with a sunday school experience
[1:47:41] is that all right to say it that way
[1:47:44] he he wasn't just something he knew
[1:47:45] about the god of the message well i know
[1:47:47] about him i know he's done this no
[1:47:50] daniel made a statement in that hour it
[1:47:52] came from his heart don't let the king
[1:47:54] be hasty because he didn't just know
[1:47:57] about god but he knew him personally he
[1:48:00] knew that god is the interpreter god is
[1:48:03] the revealer
[1:48:04] [Music]
[1:48:06] and he was able to stand there in the
[1:48:08] gap in that hour you talking about a lot
[1:48:11] of pressure there was a lot of pressure
[1:48:13] on daniel there was a lot of pressure
[1:48:15] his his flesh felt there's a lot of
[1:48:17] pressure but he gathered the brethren
[1:48:19] together and he said let's pray and
[1:48:22] let's call on the mercies of god
[1:48:26] i'll tell you what an example in this
[1:48:28] hour pressure coming on but what a time
[1:48:31] to get together and call on the mercies
[1:48:33] of god
[1:48:36] and daniel saw
[1:48:38] this image
[1:48:39] of where it would come to
[1:48:42] now think about this
[1:48:43] the gentile kingdom
[1:48:46] and where we're at we're at the end
[1:48:50] we're at the end
[1:48:53] remember it started out the legs of iron
[1:48:56] that fourth empire
[1:48:57] rome
[1:48:59] it was iron in the legs but when it got
[1:49:02] down into the feet
[1:49:05] it spread
[1:49:08] it spread under a covert manner
