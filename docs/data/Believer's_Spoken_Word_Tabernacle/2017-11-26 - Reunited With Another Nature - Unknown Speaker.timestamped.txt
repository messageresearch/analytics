[49:16] Lord in our lives we pray Lord we just
[49:19] ask Lord for every request Lord those
[49:21] that were mentioned and unknown and also
[49:24] unspoken Lord in the service Lord and
[49:27] some that are not able to be your Lord
[49:29] sickness in their body I pray God that
[49:31] you would visit them Lord and minister
[49:34] Lord to their bodies Lord and strengthen
[49:36] them Lord in this moment I pray Lord we
[49:39] ask all these things Lord that may our
[49:41] hearts Lord
[49:42] warmed by your presence Lord may you
[49:45] come among us Lord and change us Lord
[49:47] change lives Lord God I pray this
[49:50] morning Lord we just love you and we
[49:52] thank you Lord in the name of Jesus
[49:55] Christ amen amen let's look in the
[49:59] scriptures here - first John chapter 3
[50:01] say we certainly greet each and every
[50:04] one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[50:05] Christ
[50:17] first John chapter three we'll just read
[50:20] a few verses of Scripture will let you
[50:21] be seated behold what manner of love the
[50:29] father hath bestowed upon us that we
[50:34] should be called the sons of God
[50:37] therefore the world knoweth us not
[50:39] because it knew him now beloved now are
[50:44] we the sons of God and it does not yet
[50:47] appear what we shall be but we know that
[50:51] when he shall appear we shall be like
[50:53] him for we shall see him as he is and
[50:57] every man that hath this hope this
[51:00] expectation in him purifies himself even
[51:04] as he is pure amen I'd like to begin
[51:10] speaking to you here we've been dealing
[51:12] with the thought and I'd like to just
[51:15] title this this morning just leading
[51:17] into it a little bit on reunited with
[51:20] another nature may God bless you bless
[51:24] the reading of his word as you're being
[51:25] seated
[51:32] when we think of this and we've been
[51:34] looking at that of the new birth how did
[51:40] the Lord Jesus has spoke to us you must
[51:42] be born again and we know that that that
[51:48] particular passage of Scripture there is
[51:51] without many that read that and the new
[51:54] birth itself is taught in many different
[51:57] ways according to what people themselves
[52:00] would understand or what they would know
[52:03] but we realized in the in the simplicity
[52:06] of it all that in the new birth is to be
[52:09] born again and as simple as it can be
[52:12] it's a new life it's not the same old
[52:16] life remade and reaping and relived but
[52:20] it's a new life that begins within the
[52:24] same old temple so when we look at this
[52:29] in the scripture in first John chapter 3
[52:33] verse 1 the Scriptures tell us here what
[52:38] manner of love the father hath bestowed
[52:39] upon us that we should be called the
[52:42] sons of God when we look at this in the
[52:45] scripture we recognize that this is not
[52:48] something that is being bestowed or
[52:51] another word for bestowed there is to
[52:53] confer it's not something that is just
[52:56] being stuck upon us as though that in in
[53:01] in some manner that we are are something
[53:05] that we are truly not but Andheri but in
[53:09] reality within everything this is the
[53:13] effect of the love of God that has come
[53:17] to raise up that which God always knew
[53:22] and the whole plan of redemption of what
[53:25] it was all tied to it's not something
[53:28] that where when we look at it that you
[53:31] know when a person can look and and have
[53:34] a thought and say well you know we're
[53:36] sons of God but remember a son in itself
[53:39] but son PAC's the DNA it packs the name
[53:42] it packs the life of the father impacts
[53:44] all of those thing
[53:45] of the bloodline and when we we look at
[53:48] this in here in the scriptures as as as
[53:52] it is mentioned here beloved now are we
[53:55] the sons of God not not we will be but
[53:59] we are now the sons of God and to find
[54:03] that how when we look there in verse 3
[54:06] every man that hath this hope this
[54:08] expectation in him purifies himself even
[54:12] as he is pure and we find that that
[54:14] expectation that as a believer that once
[54:18] God has brought that change that
[54:21] quickening into that life we have an
[54:23] expectation because that mystery as
[54:27] being unfold in our life there is come a
[54:29] change in our life and this is where
[54:32] John could say it does not appear what
[54:35] we shall be but we know that when he
[54:38] shall appear we shall be like him the
[54:41] confidence is is because who he is now
[54:44] in all that he is we are we're not just
[54:49] a part of him we are who he is the
[54:53] scripture is very clear as it lays out
[54:55] here every man that has this same
[54:57] expectation within him purifies himself
[55:00] even as he is pure
[55:02] you realize you cannot be purified but
[55:05] but only according to the measure of
[55:08] purification
[55:09] that's ministered what the purification
[55:12] is ministered when we look back in the
[55:15] days of Luther there was a level of
[55:17] purification that they could come to it
[55:20] was a purification of the gesture live
[55:22] by faith and there were things that
[55:23] Luther was able to do under that word
[55:26] that was revealed but yet those who came
[55:29] under that word are a part of the body
[55:31] just as much as Wesley when he came
[55:34] there's a level of the word that comes
[55:36] and brings a further purification and it
[55:39] kept moving been in the restoration of
[55:41] the gifts and then to see how that God
[55:43] himself coming in this hour in entirety
[55:46] not just to release to you and I apart
[55:49] although we have the Holy Ghost in a
[55:51] portion but it's to release within us
[55:54] the fullness and the full reality of
[55:57] everything that was ever against us has
[56:00] been stricken off and there is a
[56:02] fullness that is moved upon our life in
[56:05] Redemption it's a full as a word that
[56:09] brings a purification in our life it's a
[56:12] word that brings a real true
[56:15] sanctification from within a word that
[56:19] brings a change and it's a word that
[56:21] continues to change us it's a word that
[56:24] continues to purify a word that
[56:27] continues to cleanse and you realize if
[56:29] it's a word a letter will cleanse it has
[56:33] to be a Living Word to bring a flimsy
[56:36] steel water will not cleanse it must be
[56:40] flowing running water that's the promise
[56:44] of the Lord Jesus Christ that this water
[56:47] his word is a living water and we are
[56:51] washed by the washing of water by the
[56:54] word so to receive this this this
[56:59] adoption or the placement as the
[57:01] scripture would say in in Ephesians 1 to
[57:04] have the adoption of sons by Jesus
[57:07] Christ that placement and you know
[57:09] placement is everything it's everything
[57:12] it makes it makes a difference because
[57:14] without the placement that expression of
[57:18] what God has sown with in your life can
[57:20] never be expressed
[57:23] so what God has placed their placement
[57:26] itself taking from one place to the
[57:28] other and worries transferring or moving
[57:32] to is that that which is within can come
[57:34] forth in expression so here this
[57:37] adoption of sons by Jesus Christ unto
[57:41] himself so when we look at this in in as
[57:46] we've covered that here in 1st John 3
[57:49] we were always sons of God and Frank's
[57:54] Alyssa this can never be stated enough
[57:57] it can never be you know a person could
[57:59] say part on it's not heart on this is
[58:02] the Word of God this is the declaration
[58:04] this is this this is the whole thing of
[58:06] redemption that we can
[58:08] recognized at sons and daughters of God
[58:10] and the sons and daughters of God our
[58:12] beginning is not here in time we don't
[58:15] end here in time this body is a time
[58:19] body but God himself has moved in our
[58:22] life and we're no longer a time being
[58:25] we're a preacher of eternity amen
[58:29] God starts at color and has been
[58:31] expressed in this hour so this manner of
[58:37] love that he has bestowed upon us is not
[58:40] that he has made of something that were
[58:43] not but this manner of love has come to
[58:46] do what only his love can do and that's
[58:49] to release the true identity of who you
[58:52] and I always were in familiar passages
[59:01] in the book of Galatians Galatians 4:1
[59:03] Paul says that the air as long as he is
[59:07] a child differeth nothing from a servant
[59:10] though he be Lord of all now he's
[59:14] already an heir he's already a son but
[59:19] he difference nothing from a servant
[59:23] what is a servant what hell is the
[59:25] servant a servants always were waiting
[59:27] on tell me what to do okay I'll do this
[59:29] tell me what to do okay I'll do this
[59:30] tell me what to do I'll do this a
[59:32] servant is not clued into what it's all
[59:36] about that's what Jesus said a man must
[59:39] be born again without being born again
[59:42] he can never understand see the kingdom
[59:45] of God
[59:46] it's just something of tell me to do
[59:48] this tell me to do that okay I won't do
[59:50] this okay I won't do that
[59:51] and listen friends we need the Holy
[59:53] Spirit to remind us to deal with our
[59:57] life we need the preaching of the word
[59:59] to put that outer man in check we need
[1:00:03] the preacher in the word now listen
[1:00:05] here's how the preaching of the word
[1:00:06] it'll put that out or matichek it'll
[1:00:08] bring correction buddy while does it do
[1:00:11] it it does it by
[1:00:12] lifting the real you on the inside
[1:00:15] because you are the one that is ordained
[1:00:19] and anointed by God to rule over that
[1:00:21] outer man correction comes but with
[1:00:27] correction comes authority if we heed to
[1:00:30] that than authority comes so though he
[1:00:35] be Lord of all my having all of this
[1:00:38] within but yet he's under tutors and
[1:00:41] governors until the time appointed of
[1:00:44] the Father
[1:00:45] so everything in time I want you just to
[1:00:48] catch this here everything very simple
[1:00:51] principle but everything it is it is
[1:00:54] there appointed in a designated season
[1:00:57] of time friends if we can if we can
[1:01:00] truly take this this is a principle all
[1:01:03] the way through the scriptures if we can
[1:01:05] rest within that our faith rest within
[1:01:07] the word that no matter what it is that
[1:01:10] you're praying about whether it's lost
[1:01:12] whether it's loved ones that you don't
[1:01:13] see here your desires listen the desire
[1:01:16] is to pray but understanding this here
[1:01:18] if everything is in God's hands if
[1:01:22] you're praying you're committing it to
[1:01:23] the Lord you're looking faithful then
[1:01:25] God is able to move on them and God
[1:01:28] moves at his appointed time he won't be
[1:01:32] late he won't be early it'll be ready
[1:01:34] disappointed
[1:01:36] and when God is moving things along
[1:01:39] sometimes it doesn't seem to move along
[1:01:41] maybe fast enough for us but remember
[1:01:44] here God is the one who is in control
[1:01:46] God will bring forth every one of his
[1:01:50] words in its season anytime the word has
[1:01:56] gotten ahead and I don't say the word
[1:01:57] where people got ahead of the word in
[1:01:59] him with the wrong necessarily with
[1:02:02] wrong desire to try to get ahead of God
[1:02:05] but it's that thing's trying to make
[1:02:07] things happen that God is the only one
[1:02:10] can make those things happen
[1:02:13] what can't do it not you and I listen
[1:02:15] this handkerchief may have to be right
[1:02:17] here but you can't put it there you
[1:02:20] might know it has to be right here you
[1:02:22] know the degree of the heart the spirit
[1:02:24] where it needs to be you can say I just
[1:02:26] don't see it there yet I just don't see
[1:02:28] it there yet you can't put it there
[1:02:30] it has to be God sovereignly move upon
[1:02:34] those things that everything will come
[1:02:36] in line and everything will line up with
[1:02:38] this time it's not a coincidence than
[1:02:42] even the star there that supernatural
[1:02:44] star in the sky it's not a coincidence
[1:02:46] that God has he wrote his Bible in the
[1:02:49] heavens and all these things were lined
[1:02:51] up it's not a coincidence that the stars
[1:02:54] were lined up and those different things
[1:02:55] at certain times of birth upon this
[1:02:58] earth it's not a coincidence it is
[1:03:00] called aligning everything in his timing
[1:03:06] my momma when we think of that you know
[1:03:09] friends when you look at those things
[1:03:10] more and more that we look at the word
[1:03:12] it creates should create within us more
[1:03:15] and more of a reality to know that Lord
[1:03:18] it must be you and it is you doing it in
[1:03:21] my life
[1:03:22] so help me to get out of the way
[1:03:27] so just as your natural birth has been
[1:03:31] pre-planned your spiritual birth has
[1:03:34] been pre-planned by God
[1:03:35] God knew exactly what time what age
[1:03:37] gotten to exactly the moment God already
[1:03:41] had all that plant even so verse 3 when
[1:03:46] we were children were in bondage we were
[1:03:50] children but we were in bondage under
[1:03:53] the elements of the world but when the
[1:03:57] fullness of the time was come God sent
[1:03:59] forth his son made of a woman made under
[1:04:05] the law whose the law that of sin and
[1:04:09] death he had to come under the penalty
[1:04:12] of his own law couldn't come through
[1:04:15] sexual birth because there there would
[1:04:19] be no redemption in that but there had
[1:04:20] to be a birth that of a virgin birth
[1:04:23] which is separate from the sexual birth
[1:04:26] that took place in the beginning showing
[1:04:29] showing in the ministry of the son of
[1:04:32] man coming there is another birth coming
[1:04:35] in the ministry of the son of man that's
[1:04:38] why the prophet could stand there and
[1:04:40] preach a message the birth pains and say
[1:04:43] that this earth is to be delivered of a
[1:04:46] new birth according to Malachi 4 why
[1:04:49] it's coming with the fullness to bring a
[1:04:52] deliverance
[1:04:55] hallelujah away when God since his word
[1:04:58] it comes to bring life verse 5 to redeem
[1:05:10] them that were under the law that we
[1:05:14] might receive the adoption of sons I
[1:05:18] want you to consider this this you know
[1:05:21] brother Branham lays heavily on this in
[1:05:23] the in the message future home and he
[1:05:24] intermittently continues to come back to
[1:05:26] it of how that when the Lord Jesus was
[1:05:29] here upon this earth here coming with
[1:05:35] the purpose of redemption and Satan
[1:05:38] tempted him in in in many in greatness
[1:05:43] of weakness and in many different places
[1:05:46] and there on the mountain tried to
[1:05:48] assert authority over him
[1:05:51] how would he assert authority by giving
[1:05:54] but the Lord Jesus stood there and would
[1:05:58] not take that gift because there had to
[1:06:01] be a purchase it had to be clear there
[1:06:11] could not be any in debt meant that is
[1:06:14] even felt or since that could not be
[1:06:17] anything that had to be a purchase and
[1:06:20] rather the Lord Jesus made that decision
[1:06:22] what that you and I could truly walk
[1:06:25] free and clear and this could not be
[1:06:29] gifted it had to be purchased and yet
[1:06:32] you and I received the gift of eternal
[1:06:35] life he purchased not what you and I can
[1:06:39] receive hallelujah we could have never
[1:06:42] received it if he had not purchased it
[1:06:45] when they tried to get Abraham a place
[1:06:47] to bury their of Sarah Abraham would not
[1:06:51] receive it they tried to give it to it
[1:06:54] how many people you know setting even
[1:06:56] right here in this congregation you
[1:06:58] wouldn't take something somebody's given
[1:06:59] you come on somebody
[1:07:02] why because to give it it means you
[1:07:05] don't got to spend your finances you
[1:07:07] don't got to go out and do it or
[1:07:08] whatever more you'll take it I'll be
[1:07:12] honest for you but the Lord Jesus he
[1:07:15] could have taken this you know what this
[1:07:16] would have meant no suffering it would
[1:07:20] have made an easier road but he would
[1:07:23] not succumb to the gift of just giving
[1:07:27] it there had to be a purchase why
[1:07:29] because with redemption redemption
[1:07:32] requires a purchase and Men there is an
[1:07:38] object that was there was a reason of
[1:07:40] his coming the Prophet tells us he did
[1:07:44] not die to save the entire world though
[1:07:47] he wanted to but he came for those who
[1:07:51] was in his foreknowledge but the grace
[1:07:56] of God spills over from the Lamb's Book
[1:07:58] of Life
[1:07:59] and there are many that are not sons and
[1:08:02] daughters but many that receive they are
[1:08:05] able to enter into after the white
[1:08:08] throne judgment into eternal life that's
[1:08:13] the grace of God I don't have any can
[1:08:16] have a problem with that I'm thankful
[1:08:19] for that
[1:08:20] that's grace it spill over this is not
[1:08:22] look at the Bible didn't say it came in
[1:08:24] a little bit of grace but it was
[1:08:26] abundant grace it spilled if the fall
[1:08:31] had not come listen friends what we see
[1:08:33] in Revelations to him he doesn't just
[1:08:35] say a book was opened he said a little
[1:08:38] book what is that of the Lamb section
[1:08:43] but thanks be to God that from that lamb
[1:08:46] section there if there had not been a
[1:08:49] fall there would have never been
[1:08:51] millions of people that would have ever
[1:08:54] lived upon this earth but in the midst
[1:09:04] of that like we begin looking at this
[1:09:05] back in December of last year these
[1:09:07] things God never lost sight of one the
[1:09:12] book passed back into the hands of the
[1:09:15] original owner what did the lamb's
[1:09:17] section it passed back into the hands of
[1:09:22] the original verse six says and because
[1:09:28] ye are sons God had sent forth the
[1:09:32] spirit of his son into your hearts
[1:09:34] crying Abba Father
[1:09:37] wherefore thou art no more a servant but
[1:09:42] a son and if a son then an heir of God
[1:09:45] through Christ
[1:09:46] now lets you to catch the setting the
[1:09:49] background in many of these instances is
[1:09:51] very important as well Paul you know is
[1:09:54] dealing in this in this whole book of
[1:09:57] where men have come in and Paul called
[1:10:00] him false brethren these men had come
[1:10:03] under the influence of Peter and yet
[1:10:05] Peters are genuine elect of God but
[1:10:08] Peter had his own thoughts come on
[1:10:11] somebody
[1:10:12] we've seen how Peter you know was
[1:10:13] sitting there eating with him and he had
[1:10:15] his bacon and he was eating his sausage
[1:10:17] and his bratwurst and his pork chop and
[1:10:19] then some brothers came over the hill he
[1:10:21] grabbed the breath freshener wanted to
[1:10:23] clear his breath of bacon and he
[1:10:25] to make sure there was no grease on it
[1:10:26] why you say it well well he had a he had
[1:10:29] a dealing before he went to Cornelius
[1:10:30] house I know what I'm talking about
[1:10:32] he's after Cornelius's house you see
[1:10:35] that's why the washing of water by the
[1:10:37] word it comes to class Peter didn't
[1:10:39] needed so Clancy had oughta been
[1:10:41] regenerated he needed his sub-conscience
[1:10:43] that teaching that belief he needed that
[1:10:47] washed away because it was troubling him
[1:10:54] Paul is dealing with this letting them
[1:10:58] know you're not servants any longer but
[1:11:01] those that are under the law we're then
[1:11:04] in this in that particular that you
[1:11:06] don't know you don't understand what God
[1:11:09] is doing but the grace of God has come
[1:11:11] to lift you from that where is that we
[1:11:15] are above the Lord you say how can we be
[1:11:17] above the law because it is his law now
[1:11:20] written in our hearts by the Spirit of
[1:11:24] Almighty God this scripture is a very
[1:11:30] very tremendous scripture in verse 6 and
[1:11:33] because you are sons look at this this
[1:11:36] is a cause and effect because you are
[1:11:39] sons God has sent forth the spirit of
[1:11:43] his son into your hearts because you not
[1:11:47] become but you always were sons this is
[1:11:51] to come this is the reason of the coming
[1:11:53] of the Holy Spirit is to do what is to
[1:11:58] raise up and to bring into realization
[1:12:02] the sons and daughters of God now look
[1:12:06] at this
[1:12:07] in the message of some earning in church
[1:12:09] age brother Branham says now comes a
[1:12:12] higher triumphal capstone on the baptism
[1:12:15] with the Holy Ghost
[1:12:16] our triumphal capstone this is our
[1:12:20] triumphal capstone it's not only where
[1:12:23] we're at in the pyramid but it is also a
[1:12:26] signification this is our triumphal
[1:12:29] capsule
[1:12:30] this is that reality breaking in upon
[1:12:34] our lives in our hearts in the real true
[1:12:37] reality of what the real baptism of the
[1:12:41] Holy Ghost is all about the REM says
[1:12:50] there it is Jesus Christ came forth died
[1:12:54] upon the cross the cross and
[1:12:57] accomplished redemption restoring to
[1:12:59] original owner by means of purchase or
[1:13:02] paying the price and thereby placed us
[1:13:05] as sons he did not make us sons for we
[1:13:09] were already his sons but he placed us
[1:13:12] as sons hallelujah
[1:13:19] there's something that is there within
[1:13:21] your life to be able to receive that
[1:13:25] word to be able to receive the Holy
[1:13:30] Ghost it's just like there's all kinds
[1:13:32] of signals going through here right now
[1:13:33] I don't have my cell phone on me I don't
[1:13:38] have it on me it's back in my office
[1:13:40] there's all kinds of signals going
[1:13:42] through here there's signals that's
[1:13:44] going from my belt back but you don't
[1:13:46] have in your possession your own
[1:13:48] position the receiver to pick it up but
[1:13:52] if you have the receiver then you're
[1:13:54] able to receive the transmission of the
[1:13:57] waves that are invisible but yet you're
[1:14:00] able to receive them there must be
[1:14:02] something already there that's able to
[1:14:07] receive the Holy Ghost that's why the
[1:14:13] Prophet over and over and you find and
[1:14:15] even continue to grow as the message
[1:14:17] unfolds in the latter ages why he says
[1:14:20] that the Holy Ghost he said he can fall
[1:14:23] he said it and if he said that word he
[1:14:26] said it could make that Holy Ghost it
[1:14:28] can make a church member it can make a
[1:14:29] good person he said but when it comes to
[1:14:32] lining up of the word they'll never do
[1:14:34] it
[1:14:35] see understand that's why what a person
[1:14:38] says the Holy Ghost listen friends the
[1:14:40] Holy Ghost is a necessity that is what
[1:14:43] brings you and I into the body are you
[1:14:46] with me
[1:14:48] but in the reason it brings you and I
[1:14:50] into the body is because of that real
[1:14:53] gift from God that lives within our life
[1:14:56] that's soul that's why the Prophet would
[1:15:01] warn in things that are being talked
[1:15:03] about things that we enjoy and that we
[1:15:06] like we like mountains some of us like
[1:15:07] mountains someone was like playing some
[1:15:09] of us like this something like that and
[1:15:10] brother Graham talks about how that God
[1:15:11] would so lay those things out knowing
[1:15:13] what we like what we would desire he
[1:15:16] said but all those things are temporal
[1:15:19] and that's where he could say in that
[1:15:22] same message he said the baptism of the
[1:15:24] Holy Ghost is a temporal gift if
[1:15:31] powerful huh he wasn't making light of a
[1:15:35] Holy Ghost
[1:15:35] he's showing as he goes on to say that
[1:15:38] the real gift is that soul that come
[1:15:42] from God because the Holy Ghost is sent
[1:15:44] to quicken and raise up that purpose
[1:15:47] that was purposed in God from before the
[1:15:49] foundation of the world
[1:15:53] this is why this is why friends that we
[1:15:56] we understand that the life of the Holy
[1:16:01] Spirit the working of the Holy Spirit in
[1:16:04] our life that of the word of redemption
[1:16:06] is not a demonstration it's an action
[1:16:13] it's not something that just here and
[1:16:15] there that shown no no it's a living
[1:16:17] action brother Ram goes on to say here
[1:16:23] he says for as long as we were in the
[1:16:26] world in the flesh we could not be
[1:16:28] recognized as his sons we're still here
[1:16:31] but we're not in the world as far as in
[1:16:35] that nature
[1:16:37] we couldn't be recognized the sons and
[1:16:40] daughters of God yeah we were held
[1:16:43] captive by the devil but we were sons
[1:16:47] nonetheless and here this and because
[1:16:52] your sons God had sent forth his spirit
[1:16:55] and into your hearts whereby you cry
[1:16:58] father father upon whom did the spirit
[1:17:01] fall at Pentecost sons at Corinth upon
[1:17:05] sons while they heard the word he said
[1:17:09] so what is the baptism with the Holy
[1:17:11] Ghost it is the spirit baptizing you
[1:17:14] into the body of Christ it is the new
[1:17:17] birth
[1:17:18] it's the Spirit of God coming remember
[1:17:21] here he is revealing his name by way of
[1:17:25] his word it is the Spirit of God coming
[1:17:29] in and filling you after you have
[1:17:31] repented having heard his word and been
[1:17:33] baptized in water has an answer of a
[1:17:36] good conscience toward God so God makes
[1:17:40] away that through the shedding of the
[1:17:44] blood the price is paid for now the life
[1:17:47] that was within that blood cell is
[1:17:49] loosed now is the issuance of a
[1:17:54] preaching of the acceptable year of the
[1:17:57] Lord it begins to sound and declare not
[1:18:01] something that is coming but now it is
[1:18:05] sounding what has taken place and delet
[1:18:09] you and I know we are a part of that we
[1:18:13] are the reason and here to think of it
[1:18:20] as a son of God I want you to just to
[1:18:22] think of this for a moment as a son and
[1:18:24] daughter of God we can look at that all
[1:18:27] as a son always a daughter but there has
[1:18:30] to be something that brings you and I to
[1:18:35] the realization of who
[1:18:43] it can't be anything that's strange
[1:18:47] think back to some weeks ago a month ago
[1:18:50] we were dealing with that on the sheet
[1:18:51] jesus said my sheep they know my voice
[1:18:53] and a stranger they will not follow say
[1:18:58] they know my voice what is his voice his
[1:19:00] word how do they know because he's the
[1:19:04] Shepherd that the Sheep always why sheep
[1:19:09] so it can't be something strange but you
[1:19:12] get that sheep on familiar grounds and
[1:19:16] the sheep will recognize who it is
[1:19:21] before that time it's walking in amnesia
[1:19:27] think about them boys who were on the
[1:19:30] train that from the battle battle that
[1:19:35] started in heaven fell upon human beings
[1:19:37] they were from that battle they were
[1:19:40] being escorted to an asylum see they
[1:19:45] weren't they will say a request that was
[1:19:47] made known and they were letting parents
[1:19:49] know your boys that some of your boys
[1:19:54] that if they're missing you haven't
[1:19:56] heard from them and so forth they're
[1:19:58] headed to the asylum and you had parents
[1:20:01] the Prophet dramatized it how you had
[1:20:03] parents that we're riding in to try to
[1:20:05] claim and looking different descriptions
[1:20:07] of their sons but here when that train
[1:20:10] stopped all of those soldiers got off of
[1:20:16] that train but in that stop something
[1:20:21] happened
[1:20:22] we're one of those soldiers who was on
[1:20:25] that train bound for the asylum but when
[1:20:28] he got off of there
[1:20:29] he started to look
[1:20:33] and it started to consider things around
[1:20:38] him what was it it was his surroundings
[1:20:42] he began to look at the trees then he
[1:20:45] begin to look at that water tower and
[1:20:47] the man who was there gliding him
[1:20:49] because they had to watch and they could
[1:20:51] go off astray but the man who was there
[1:20:53] watching him he started watching this
[1:20:55] young man and this young man started
[1:20:57] walking and he took a trail the guard
[1:21:00] did not show him that trail he got into
[1:21:03] a familiar place and when he got in that
[1:21:05] familiar place his amnesia started to
[1:21:09] live from him and he started walking
[1:21:12] over this hill
[1:21:13] what was it it was familiar territory
[1:21:16] and as he was walking in this ground it
[1:21:19] was leaving him and then that that guard
[1:21:22] he saw where that soldier here it is a
[1:21:25] father was sitting on the porch and that
[1:21:27] father runs out and embraced that son
[1:21:30] and said they told me you were there but
[1:21:32] son I knew you weren't dead
[1:21:36] what was that it was a familiar place
[1:21:39] that brought me amnesia who ever
[1:21:42] intended something that God in himself
[1:21:44] where his presence by his word heaven
[1:21:47] itself heavenly places
[1:21:50] sets down right amongst believers and
[1:21:53] what does it do it is a familiar place
[1:21:55] bill you may not be able to explain it
[1:21:58] but you recognize this this is where
[1:22:06] something begins to take hold and nisha
[1:22:10] breaks away hallelujah
[1:22:16] a water tower a familiar place so God
[1:22:21] would deliver his word to our lives so
[1:22:25] this word when you think of how that
[1:22:27] that water tower and those things think
[1:22:31] of that in terms of how Paul speaks of
[1:22:34] the gospel the gospel of your salvation
[1:22:37] after having heard you believed and
[1:22:42] second Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 13
[1:22:44] you see because we need the word to come
[1:22:48] to us is that right the word always
[1:22:53] comes to the predestiny we need the word
[1:22:58] to come to us right Paul says but we are
[1:23:03] bound to give thanks always to God for
[1:23:05] you brethren beloved of the Lord because
[1:23:07] God had from the beginning chosen you to
[1:23:12] salvation through sanctification of the
[1:23:14] Spirit and belief of the truth we are
[1:23:19] believing this morning because we were
[1:23:23] chosen to believe
[1:23:26] understand this choosing is not a making
[1:23:28] you this choosing is simply conferring
[1:23:32] who you are it's not all of a sudden God
[1:23:37] saying now you're going to believe you
[1:23:38] were chosen in him Amen now you are
[1:23:44] chosen to salvation through
[1:23:47] sanctification of the Spirit so the word
[1:23:50] itself the Spirit of God coming to bring
[1:23:53] a real purification a real
[1:23:56] sanctification the revealing of the
[1:23:59] truth as the truth comes in our mist it
[1:24:01] deals with the heart where a person
[1:24:05] could say that's the truth
[1:24:07] then follows into repentance there right
[1:24:10] now listen friends he could take a break
[1:24:13] and take a process of time but it can
[1:24:16] also happen in just one moment all
[1:24:19] things things hallelujah sanctification
[1:24:26] of the Spirit and belief of the truth
[1:24:27] where until he called you by our gospel
[1:24:31] to the obtaining of the glory of our
[1:24:35] Lord Jesus Christ so the gospel sounding
[1:24:38] pause letting you know not another
[1:24:40] gospel not just any gospel or do not
[1:24:43] just any Jesus will do
[1:24:45] hey man it's got to be not imagination
[1:24:48] not an imaginary Jesus but a real true
[1:24:51] living Jesus he meant the real true
[1:24:55] living atonement that's the real gospel
[1:24:57] of Jesus Christ amen that has been
[1:25:00] sounded down through the ages and
[1:25:02] polar's letting it be known that you
[1:25:04] were called you who were chosen to this
[1:25:08] have been called by our gospel what is
[1:25:10] that gospel the gospel is the word
[1:25:13] preached in power and demonstration
[1:25:18] could already be to God
[1:25:20] to uh to the obtaining of the glory the
[1:25:23] honor of the Lord Jesus Christ Peter
[1:25:26] says in first Peter chapter 1 verse 1
[1:25:28] Peter an apostle of Jesus Christ to the
[1:25:31] strangers scattered throughout Pontus
[1:25:33] Galatia Cappadocia Asia and Bithynia
[1:25:38] strangers
[1:25:39] sure we are pilgrims and strangers we're
[1:25:43] not of this world
[1:25:45] Peters Linden been no new strangers that
[1:25:47] were scattered abroad verse to elect
[1:25:51] according to the foreknowledge of God
[1:25:53] the Father through sanctification of the
[1:25:56] spirit under obedience and sprinkling of
[1:25:59] the blood of Jesus Christ let me say
[1:26:00] this very clear election will always
[1:26:04] declare itself in the presence of the
[1:26:07] word it will always manifest submission
[1:26:10] in the word when you had those who after
[1:26:16] they had heard the word here when Peter
[1:26:19] spoke in the house of Cornelius they had
[1:26:22] received the Holy Ghost but remember
[1:26:24] when it was made known to them of being
[1:26:27] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:26:30] even though they were already filled
[1:26:32] with the Spirit of God showing they were
[1:26:34] in let and that seed was quickly they
[1:26:37] were in full submission to the word
[1:26:41] because the Lamb of God Himself was in
[1:26:44] full submission so the Lambs of the Lamb
[1:26:47] book are in full submission it select
[1:26:52] for this the election elected to the
[1:26:55] word elected to the placement in John
[1:26:59] chapter 1 verse 9 the Lord Jesus says
[1:27:03] this was the true light here which
[1:27:07] lighteth every man that cometh into the
[1:27:10] world lieth so man need to be lit so the
[1:27:18] first verse itself is not the lighting
[1:27:20] you must be lit but not just lit with a
[1:27:26] man-made fire it's gotta be a holy
[1:27:31] it's gotta be that light which is
[1:27:34] himself he was in the world and the
[1:27:40] world was made by him and the world knew
[1:27:42] him not
[1:27:45] he came into his own and his own
[1:27:48] received him not but as many as received
[1:27:51] him to them gave he power to become the
[1:27:56] sons of God even to them that believe on
[1:27:59] his name let me deal with the scripture
[1:28:03] here just a little bit
[1:28:05] this word powers that of the authority
[1:28:10] that of power that of jurisdiction to
[1:28:13] give to you what rightfully belongs to
[1:28:18] you and one time your life was being
[1:28:23] ruled as Paul portrays this is Ephesians
[1:28:28] Titus so forth that we were walking
[1:28:32] under the Prince of power of the air the
[1:28:34] motions of sin worked in our members we
[1:28:39] were dominated by that first nature we
[1:28:44] were and yet within us residing within
[1:28:48] us there was an authority but it was not
[1:28:52] authority that had been quickened it had
[1:28:55] not come to light yet within us a
[1:29:00] jurisdiction is is laying there but
[1:29:02] there had to be something one who would
[1:29:06] bring forth what was resting there the
[1:29:10] whole time and not just bring it forth
[1:29:14] but that you and I would know there the
[1:29:18] whole time it was always a son and
[1:29:21] daughter of God what is it coming into
[1:29:23] it's coming to that and moving in that
[1:29:26] real identity of who you really are
[1:29:28] [Music]
[1:29:31] listen friends is just as it just as
[1:29:33] simple that sin as sin can rule over a
[1:29:37] life but when God has moved in and lift
[1:29:39] life up sin no longer is your ruler you
[1:29:43] become the master it's no longer a
[1:29:49] nature that's ruling you and you're
[1:29:50] under it being moved along but now it is
[1:29:54] a reality of a jurisdiction as a son and
[1:29:57] daughter of God that hey this is my
[1:29:59] possession this is who I am
[1:30:06] [Music]
[1:30:08] my to them but as many as received him
[1:30:13] these are not just an idea of him this
[1:30:16] this will not bring transforming power
[1:30:18] but to receive him the person itzá
[1:30:23] recognize him in his day of visitation
[1:30:26] remember the probably takes us back to
[1:30:29] Luther's time and he talks about how
[1:30:32] much word was spoken in that hour of the
[1:30:35] word itself if the word would have been
[1:30:38] taken in of what it would have done
[1:30:40] within the people's lives he said but
[1:30:42] many were not hearing it in before
[1:30:44] practical out working they were hearing
[1:30:47] the word in an academic manner they were
[1:30:52] just hearing it in a matter of I agree
[1:30:54] with Samson this and they were hearing
[1:30:55] it and they were debating and arguing
[1:30:57] and holding others in contempt and
[1:30:59] everything else it was not for practical
[1:31:01] outworking let me tell you something
[1:31:03] when the word is coming forth whether
[1:31:05] I'm sitting here I'm listening at home
[1:31:07] and reading in the scriptures that word
[1:31:09] is coming forth for me I don't want to
[1:31:13] be in a state to where I know this I
[1:31:16] know that I know this listen friends
[1:31:17] there's many tapes I could finish the
[1:31:19] paragraphs go high know exactly where
[1:31:22] the prophets voice will go that's not
[1:31:24] what we're talking about you can get
[1:31:27] that from listening to it many times but
[1:31:28] it's never cease we're God's help we'll
[1:31:31] move down in our days that stand up out
[1:31:34] of that message and God speaks and
[1:31:37] delivers in that time when you think
[1:31:39] where this
[1:31:42] [Applause]
[1:31:46] it's not us listening to the word in an
[1:31:49] academic manner it's for practical out
[1:31:52] working and the only way it can be for
[1:31:54] practical out working
[1:31:56] it must be submission to them gave he
[1:32:02] power to become the sons of God I love
[1:32:05] this word become this word become means
[1:32:09] come to pass it means to be fulfilled it
[1:32:15] means to arise it means to be married to
[1:32:19] this word become means to cause to be
[1:32:24] gene paraded that's how the definition
[1:32:26] is you say you're putting this and no
[1:32:29] I'm not I'm just reading a definition
[1:32:31] given to me that is to be come into
[1:32:34] being
[1:32:36] it's to be come into existence begin to
[1:32:41] be begin to be received being to come to
[1:32:45] be come to come to pass happen to arrive
[1:32:49] come on the stage none of these things
[1:32:56] they just they disconnect right out to
[1:32:58] be made to be finished to be performed
[1:33:00] to be wrong so when the scripture says
[1:33:03] but as many as received him to them gave
[1:33:07] he the authority to become or
[1:33:10] come to pass the sons of God to be
[1:33:14] fulfilled the sons of God to come into
[1:33:17] being the sons of God glory be to God
[1:33:22] hallelujah this word become that is used
[1:33:25] here it's the same word that's used
[1:33:27] throughout the New Testament when it
[1:33:29] speaks of things being fulfilled and I
[1:33:31] would speak in there and I'm just gonna
[1:33:33] skip over these things but many of the
[1:33:35] places in the scripture where it would
[1:33:37] speak about that this was done that it
[1:33:39] might be fulfilled what was spoken by
[1:33:42] the Prophet this same word that's the
[1:33:44] word that you've become all of these
[1:33:46] things were done that it might be
[1:33:47] fulfilled let me say this to you the
[1:33:49] message that God
[1:33:51] in this hour it has called that it might
[1:33:54] be fulfilled and that you and I might
[1:33:56] come to pass that is late here and been
[1:34:02] wrote for this talent and the Holy
[1:34:04] Spirit has sweep over our life that you
[1:34:07] and I might come to pass that what God
[1:34:09] has spoken concerning you and I what he
[1:34:12] thought hook you and I might be
[1:34:14] fulfilled in us that they come come to
[1:34:17] pass
[1:34:19] the very next word that holds this
[1:34:22] meaning the very next scripture which
[1:34:26] were born not of blood nor of the will
[1:34:29] of the flesh nor of the will of man but
[1:34:31] of God
[1:34:34] here it is verse 14 and the Word was
[1:34:38] become flesh was made flesh that very
[1:34:42] word it would come to pass that word
[1:34:45] that was spoken is now come to pass the
[1:34:49] word that was now backward in flesh that
[1:34:52] word has become light in our lives no
[1:34:57] longer aware that we're waiting on
[1:34:59] listen friends we're not waiting on
[1:35:01] prophecy there are things that God will
[1:35:04] fulfill in his own time but remember in
[1:35:06] this hour the Prophet cautioned when he
[1:35:09] stood there and what is the attraction
[1:35:11] on the mouth and the whole time the
[1:35:13] Spirit of God moving through the Prophet
[1:35:15] to cause the people's attention to look
[1:35:18] away to Jesus not become centered and
[1:35:22] focused on him as a person but be
[1:35:24] focused on him who is standing in our
[1:35:28] midst Jesus Christ the Son of man why
[1:35:32] because the Son of man has come to take
[1:35:35] his bride
[1:35:37] hey Maddie come to unite with her in a
[1:35:40] union so his whole part was I must
[1:35:42] decrease that he might increase hey man
[1:35:48] as I said my ministry in spoken words
[1:35:50] original see as it would be standing
[1:35:53] there and declaring behold here he comes
[1:35:56] the Lamb of God see a prophet identifies
[1:36:00] the Word of God the presence of God on
[1:36:03] earth in that time God as a spokesman to
[1:36:07] catch what is taking place and as that
[1:36:09] were coming in God's order what happens
[1:36:12] a vision a reality
[1:36:13] it begins to move upon the people and
[1:36:16] what takes place what starts as a
[1:36:18] prophecy now comes to pass see if we
[1:36:26] make the message about brother Branham
[1:36:28] then everything is there and it's still
[1:36:31] prophecy this message is not prophecy
[1:36:36] it's become fulfillment it is being
[1:36:41] fulfilled in our lives even as we speak
[1:36:48] because the one who spoke it is here
[1:36:51] fulfilling it that's where the scripture
[1:36:57] when it when when the Lord Jesus picks
[1:36:59] up in the book of Matthew and he speaks
[1:37:01] about that stone which the builders
[1:37:03] rejected has become the head of the
[1:37:05] corner this is the Lord's doing it is
[1:37:08] the Lord's doing fulfilled come to pass
[1:37:13] it's God is bringing his word to pass
[1:37:16] this is where the Prophet could say it
[1:37:19] has changed from the Prophet to his
[1:37:21] prophecy our focus is there in that of
[1:37:26] the prophecy
[1:37:28] a man who lives that prophecy that's
[1:37:31] Christ who read that prophecy its Christ
[1:37:33] in you Christ in me
[1:37:34] [Music]
[1:37:36] Alleluia this message is not a calling
[1:37:38] together to get a church this message is
[1:37:41] a calling together to make a people
[1:37:43] gathered unto Him for his namesake
[1:37:46] it's the finishing of all Redemption a
[1:37:49] menace of canonization it's that final
[1:37:52] move of God coming right among the
[1:37:55] Gentiles to call out of people for his
[1:37:57] namesake
[1:37:58] but that Junction look how things are
[1:38:00] transitioned over the times and how that
[1:38:03] God honing right in now on a group of
[1:38:05] people the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:38:09] among us in the message God who is rich
[1:38:11] in mercy my the prophet said I believe
[1:38:16] that a man when he's born into this
[1:38:18] world when you're a little baby born
[1:38:20] into the world you could not have been
[1:38:21] here without being the foreknowledge of
[1:38:23] God because he is infinite and he knows
[1:38:27] all things
[1:38:28] when that little baby is born into the
[1:38:30] world there is something in that baby if
[1:38:33] he is ever going to have life there is
[1:38:35] something in there in that child then
[1:38:38] that he comes to sooner or later that
[1:38:41] little seed is in him something we come
[1:38:46] to say brother Samuel I read I read the
[1:38:51] scriptures and that seed came in that's
[1:38:53] contrary to the word the seed you didn't
[1:38:57] do anything you didn't do it you didn't
[1:38:59] do anything for that seed that seed is
[1:39:03] placed within you it was already from
[1:39:06] God's mind there was already a body a
[1:39:08] celestial body there and here God
[1:39:11] deposits that seed that matches a
[1:39:14] representation over there that matches
[1:39:17] what was in his mind and that seed is
[1:39:20] placed there from there as you come into
[1:39:23] this world a little somatic
[1:39:29] it's resting there the whole time yes
[1:39:36] sir in the message Easter seal then when
[1:39:42] the Holy Spirit come and you're on earth
[1:39:43] and listen friends I could just refer to
[1:39:45] many of these places here and there's a
[1:39:46] lot of things I do but I want to read
[1:39:48] these things to you because this is not
[1:39:51] my ideas this is the truth of election
[1:39:58] this is the truth of who and you you and
[1:40:01] I really are what this does is take it
[1:40:07] out of your hands and out of my hands
[1:40:09] and it brings us to the realization of
[1:40:12] whose hands it's always been and if it's
[1:40:15] all if it's always been in good hands
[1:40:17] with him didn't mean it to come out like
[1:40:26] that but it did
[1:40:27] that's blessed assurance right there
[1:40:31] then when the Holy Spirit come and
[1:40:33] you're here on earth walking around here
[1:40:35] as a sinner but way down in your lives
[1:40:37] there is something you don't know what's
[1:40:40] taking place but you're hungry you don't
[1:40:46] know what's taking place but you're as
[1:40:48] you're hungry there's got to be
[1:40:50] something that can satisfy there's got
[1:40:53] to be something that can quench this
[1:40:55] hunger this longing that I have no he
[1:41:00] said I heard that presbyterian brother
[1:41:02] the baptist talking back there are free
[1:41:03] will Baptists preaching all my fellow
[1:41:05] brother he said there's something in you
[1:41:07] something that you never put in there
[1:41:12] it's something that you couldn't desire
[1:41:15] to be in there
[1:41:20] why cause it's contrary to your first
[1:41:23] nature contrary it's something that's
[1:41:29] contrary to your own nature
[1:41:31] it's the foreknowledge of God taking
[1:41:33] place God's Word when the prodigal son
[1:41:39] was down there in the Pigpen before he
[1:41:42] ever left the Pigpen he was always the
[1:41:47] son but here was the age of the Lord
[1:41:50] begin to deal with his heart and he
[1:41:52] begins to consider going back home
[1:41:55] what's happening the foreknowledge of
[1:41:58] God is taking place
[1:42:01] just let me still down in the Pigpen
[1:42:04] but there has to be something that stirs
[1:42:08] him up that's why the preaching of the
[1:42:10] gospel you know that isn't just
[1:42:12] something that happens by osmosis but
[1:42:14] God has chosen to save through the
[1:42:17] foolishness of preaching Amen it's a
[1:42:22] word oh my what is it it's just as God
[1:42:25] Himself did in the beginning he stood
[1:42:27] back and spoke his word and believed his
[1:42:30] a word amen it's God within your app
[1:42:34] raising up and catching it yep that's me
[1:42:37] that's me that's me let me tell you
[1:42:42] friends the Word of God the message that
[1:42:44] God has sent us it is not about do's and
[1:42:46] don'ts I believe if we have the doer on
[1:42:51] the inside we'll do the things we ought
[1:42:53] to and we won't do the things we should
[1:42:55] and I believe if we do do the things we
[1:42:57] should not believe the doer and the
[1:42:58] inside will help us do the things and
[1:43:00] correct those things that we did wrong
[1:43:01] cause we got the doer on the inside some
[1:43:08] you have to replay that one to find them
[1:43:11] but he says if we look here of how that
[1:43:14] the Holy Spirit would seek us out let me
[1:43:16] let me move on from that quote in
[1:43:18] Ephesians 5:8 the scripture says for ye
[1:43:22] were sometimes darkness but now are you
[1:43:24] light in the Lord walk as children of
[1:43:28] light at one time darkness but now are
[1:43:34] you light
[1:43:35] what's happened he has come to light you
[1:43:40] up has to be substance there to light up
[1:43:47] substance that we'll be able to take
[1:43:50] that that light as it's coming in and be
[1:43:53] able to reflect it the prophets were
[1:44:00] reflectors is that right they they were
[1:44:05] they were ordained to catch what was
[1:44:09] taking place in that time and reflected
[1:44:12] down to the children of God who were in
[1:44:16] that time in that hour and the children
[1:44:19] of God the elect of God have was in the
[1:44:22] ability to catch that and will reflect
[1:44:25] Jesus Christ not reflecting ourselves is
[1:44:30] reflecting this is where the scripture
[1:44:34] could say in Isaiah 60 it says arise and
[1:44:38] shine a right come to pass be fulfilled
[1:44:43] arise shine for thine light is come and
[1:44:49] the glory of the Lord is risen
[1:44:54] that light to light you and I are where
[1:45:00] the world itself passes away and here
[1:45:06] where there's a birth that takes place
[1:45:09] on the inside where this right here the
[1:45:12] message the word is no longer it's not
[1:45:15] just words it's not just do's and don'ts
[1:45:17] it's not just but it's a love affair it
[1:45:22] struck your heart where your whole
[1:45:23] desire is Lord at all cost and
[1:45:26] everything Lord Lord Jesus I want you to
[1:45:30] be the center of Troy you recognize him
[1:45:35] for me he really yes let me let me move
[1:45:41] here let me move on down here go down to
[1:45:44] that message communion towards the
[1:45:47] latter part then let's give some places
[1:45:50] the RAM says here it says our whole
[1:45:54] being is changed we're different people
[1:45:59] we don't live like we used to we don't
[1:46:02] think like we used to
[1:46:05] there's been a change that has taken
[1:46:08] place within our life he says like in
[1:46:12] the book here the spot we were talking
[1:46:14] about the two books being worn the first
[1:46:18] book of life coming up was when you were
[1:46:20] born
[1:46:20] that was your natural birth but then one
[1:46:23] time way back down in there there was a
[1:46:26] little grain of life he says I was
[1:46:29] explaining it to some sisters it's
[1:46:30] afternoon see there's a little grain of
[1:46:33] life laying down there that you wonder
[1:46:37] where did it come from
[1:46:39] what these strange things he says I was
[1:46:43] saying this taking for myself like you
[1:46:45] was going to say William Brannon well
[1:46:47] forty years ago the William Branham
[1:46:49] isn't the same one tonight
[1:46:50] if someone back there would say William
[1:46:53] Branham he was a rank rascal see because
[1:46:56] I was born of Charles and Ella Branham
[1:47:01] that first breath coming under that
[1:47:05] first breath as everyone was there has
[1:47:08] to come a change they Menon you can't
[1:47:12] bring that change
[1:47:13] I can't bring that change but the gospel
[1:47:16] the word sounds up the Holy Spirit
[1:47:19] coming out through the word brings that
[1:47:21] place to draw you and I to himself its
[1:47:28] yielding to him that he would perform
[1:47:31] what he already knows voices but in
[1:47:38] their in their nature I was a sinner in
[1:47:41] their nature I was a sinner I came to
[1:47:44] the world a liar and all the habits of
[1:47:46] the world laid right in me but down in
[1:47:49] there too was another nature presence II
[1:47:53] predestinated was in there by God in the
[1:47:56] same body two nature's in there well I
[1:48:00] catered to the one as it grows a good
[1:48:04] has a baby data the first thing you know
[1:48:07] I become a liar I've become everything
[1:48:09] else that's a sinner because I raised up
[1:48:12] that way but down in there was a little
[1:48:14] speck of life all the time the whole
[1:48:18] time that see that other nature was
[1:48:21] laying in there the whole time it was a
[1:48:27] long-lost relative you needed to be
[1:48:31] reacquainted to be free tonight glory be
[1:48:41] to God there's examples the Holy Spirit
[1:48:44] has had me pick out of the news from
[1:48:45] clear back at the first part of the year
[1:48:46] that we'll get to by God's grace but I'm
[1:48:48] just looking at here just the other day
[1:48:50] of Hallie this woman she begin to
[1:48:52] realize she said you know what I had two
[1:48:54] babies that were born to me I had two
[1:48:56] boys that were born and and she was she
[1:48:59] kept them you know for for for a little
[1:49:01] bit of their life they don't remember it
[1:49:02] but she had them for a little bit of her
[1:49:04] life and and then she had to give him up
[1:49:06] for adoption but she began to do
[1:49:08] inquiries and try to find and find out
[1:49:12] where
[1:49:12] these boys where are they at and so she
[1:49:14] begin to post different things through
[1:49:16] different forms of media Facebook and
[1:49:19] things and there was things posted out
[1:49:21] there about you know certain things like
[1:49:23] we lived in this location and all these
[1:49:26] other little things trying to put little
[1:49:27] fillers out and then have DNA testing
[1:49:30] done and there was a man that he hadn't
[1:49:34] to be looking at this you know and for
[1:49:35] him he's looking at things himself and
[1:49:37] and and he knows there's something about
[1:49:40] his life he was adopted he knows that he
[1:49:43] knows that but he doesn't know who his
[1:49:44] parent is so he begins to reach out and
[1:49:47] whatever the sites that they haven't and
[1:49:49] he has a DNA testing that's done and
[1:49:51] here comes a match of DNA that's made
[1:49:56] and then the contact is made and sure
[1:49:59] enough not only is a DNA MMA match but
[1:50:02] everything else lines up and here
[1:50:04] Sarah's are reacquainting after 57 years
[1:50:07] here they are reunited or let me tell
[1:50:10] you when the Holy Spirit comes down by
[1:50:13] Leila's word it's God's seeking to
[1:50:16] reunite and their being a reuniting that
[1:50:19] you and I would reunite with another
[1:50:21] nature that real you and I who's on the
[1:50:24] inside that he would be raised up that
[1:50:27] real son and daughter of God that we
[1:50:30] would recognize who we are we're not
[1:50:33] Church members we are the bride of Jesus
[1:50:35] friend we are sons and daughters of God
[1:50:38] [Applause]
[1:50:40] Maddi blog placed in this word for the
[1:50:43] salary became sensing he came to seek
[1:50:46] you and I listened there must be a DNA
[1:50:48] match there must be a match there must
[1:50:53] be the world must see the word Amen it
[1:50:57] must be the wife that's already residing
[1:50:59] there and the word that comes on the
[1:51:01] scene in this hour it's a DNA match
[1:51:03] that's why the Bride of Christ and this
[1:51:05] hour could not be born again under a
[1:51:08] loser messenger Wesley message of
[1:51:10] Pentecostal message it takes a bad
[1:51:12] message of the fullness of Jesus Christ
[1:51:15] coming in this our DNA
[1:51:19] yes upon earth in this hour Alleluia
[1:51:24] it's the inspiration of God poured out
[1:51:30] but the Prophet he goes on to say he
[1:51:36] said I think of how many times I would
[1:51:39] be out there in the summer time he said
[1:51:42] I'd be out there I'd get my sticks and
[1:51:43] put them down for a little windbreak
[1:51:45] where if it rained and lay there and
[1:51:47] have the pole sticking in the water
[1:51:48] fishing mild dog laying there
[1:51:51] I'd say lookee here you know last winter
[1:51:53] I camped right here one night I built a
[1:51:55] fire right here when I was waiting for
[1:51:57] my old dog here to treat I had a fire
[1:52:00] here it was froze five inches deep in
[1:52:03] the ground but little flour where did
[1:52:06] you come from well and where did you
[1:52:09] come from who come out here and planted
[1:52:11] you what hothouse did they bring you out
[1:52:13] of what about where'd you come from
[1:52:16] see that little flower I'd say why he
[1:52:18] was froze everything I I built a fire on
[1:52:21] top of there
[1:52:22] besides the freezing element there was a
[1:52:24] heat element laying there on a big old
[1:52:26] log where I burned you and here you are
[1:52:29] and you're alive where'd you come there
[1:52:34] was a lot of fires that was on this
[1:52:38] lot of fires black coldness but beneath
[1:52:43] fair there was a flower beneath there
[1:52:47] was a lily beneath all the mud and the
[1:52:51] gum and everything else packed into us
[1:52:53] was a lily glory be to God I real Lily
[1:52:59] ordained for the light and what the
[1:53:02] light does the light comes across that
[1:53:04] lily it's down there beneath the pond
[1:53:06] the light comes up that Lily starts
[1:53:10] growing towards the light
[1:53:13] what's it doing its pressing its way to
[1:53:16] overcome how by the strength of the
[1:53:21] light the light is giving it the
[1:53:23] authority to say it's time all right
[1:53:28] it's time come to pass
[1:53:30] it's time be fulfilled the light is
[1:53:34] giving the authority to that Lily to
[1:53:38] come forth and that Lily presses right
[1:53:41] through all the mud all the muck all the
[1:53:44] gum it pushes and pushes through all of
[1:53:46] that until it sets on top of the water
[1:53:49] it began way down deep but it sets on
[1:53:54] top of the water and it gives forth its
[1:53:56] radiance it was that all the time
[1:54:00] but the light gave it a thority to come
[1:54:02] forth that's what the Holy Ghost dogs it
[1:54:06] gives you authority to live as a son and
[1:54:09] daughter of God it gives you authority
[1:54:11] to stand there on your land and say I
[1:54:13] don't have to live this way any longer
[1:54:16] it's a gospel it's a word that sounds to
[1:54:18] you and say I don't have to be under
[1:54:20] this any longer
[1:54:23] then let you know there is Liberty glory
[1:54:28] be to God and after you're walking in
[1:54:31] Liberty it makes you aware of your
[1:54:33] jurisdiction all the grounds that belong
[1:54:36] to you every promise belongs to you all
[1:54:42] the grounds are given to us as the
[1:54:45] believers oh he said what was it I'm
[1:54:50] closing what was it
[1:54:52] there was another William Branham in a
[1:55:02] little spot of eternal life down there
[1:55:05] from the genes of God the Word of God
[1:55:08] that was placed in there he said each
[1:55:11] one of you can think of those similar
[1:55:13] things let me just finish it out he says
[1:55:17] I look up at the trees and I think leaf
[1:55:19] I saw you fall off last year why are you
[1:55:22] back there again where'd you come from
[1:55:24] what brought you here
[1:55:26] I see it was that eternal life working
[1:55:29] in the body then one day as I walked on
[1:55:33] that voice talking he'll never smoke
[1:55:36] drink so forth and the young fellows and
[1:55:38] all got order see there was something
[1:55:40] moving you see that's why even in your
[1:55:47] life you find a separation in your life
[1:55:50] you find separation from things that you
[1:55:54] wants to walk with and things that you
[1:55:55] once were inclined with things begin to
[1:55:58] they begin to lose it begins to lose its
[1:56:00] interest what is it it's God moving
[1:56:08] it's gone moving God bringing forth his
[1:56:12] sons and daughters
[1:56:15] listen Church there's never been a
[1:56:17] church there's never been a pastor a
[1:56:20] proper sofa or whatever that gave birth
[1:56:23] to sons and daughters of God but the
[1:56:27] Shepherd himself he's always on duty
[1:56:30] when they use art with lamps amen he is
[1:56:35] always the one by one spirit we are
[1:56:37] baptized into one body he's the one
[1:56:40] coming through that word listen he'll
[1:56:42] use a preacher he use a prophet he'll
[1:56:44] use a minister you'll use things listen
[1:56:46] God can you he'll use nature
[1:56:49] what will the nature do the nature
[1:56:51] itself doesn't bring the birth the
[1:56:53] nature only brings the realization to
[1:56:55] there is a living God he is he is true
[1:57:00] he is real he's the Living God and I
[1:57:03] want to give my life
[1:57:05] what's it it's all him drawing you and
[1:57:07] me into submission yes he says but yet
[1:57:13] all at once I looked up and I said I'm
[1:57:16] not the son of Charles and Ella Branham
[1:57:18] there's something calling he said like
[1:57:21] my little eagle I'm not a chicken I'm
[1:57:23] not a chicken there's something Abhyanga
[1:57:24] somewhere we're great eagle whoever you
[1:57:26] are open up I want to come home there's
[1:57:29] something in me calling then I was born
[1:57:34] again that little life was laying there
[1:57:37] the life of water was poured upon it
[1:57:40] then it begin that seed that life that
[1:57:45] was always there now when the life of
[1:57:48] the word comes upon it it brings that
[1:57:52] seed that was
[1:57:55] that mystery in your life is revealed by
[1:58:00] the mystery of God coming in and the
[1:58:03] mystery of God comings in reveals to you
[1:58:06] and I is Christ in us no longer the same
[1:58:14] people that little life was laying there
[1:58:18] the light with water poured upon it
[1:58:19] begin to grow that old life was forgiven
[1:58:21] put in the sea of God's forgiveness to
[1:58:23] never be remembered against me now we
[1:58:28] stand justified as though we had never
[1:58:30] sinned in the presence of God always was
[1:58:35] laying there I tell you friends this is
[1:58:39] why the word itself as it comes forth
[1:58:41] here within this hour it's a deal with
[1:58:44] our lives let me just I say this very
[1:58:47] very firmly the word itself God's
[1:58:52] purpose and God's desire is not that we
[1:58:54] would just come to church leave out of
[1:58:57] church come back we just kind of go
[1:59:00] through life God's desires that you
[1:59:02] would have victory in your
[1:59:07] that it's not something that you have to
[1:59:10] do but it's a love affair outside it's
[1:59:14] what you live for you live for him day
[1:59:16] in and day out your desire is to please
[1:59:19] him not to please yourself that life
[1:59:24] moves to raise you up it's only him that
[1:59:28] can separate and bring that separation
[1:59:30] only him that can bring that reuniting
[1:59:33] with that other nature that real you on
[1:59:38] the inside I say this morning that he is
[1:59:43] able he is able to do and perform his
[1:59:48] word just exactly what he said and bring
[1:59:52] it to pass in our life
[1:59:56] let's pray Heavenly Father Lord Jesus
[2:00:05] sometimes the Lord I just feel like the
[2:00:08] Lord the word it comes out Lord just so
[2:00:11] chopped-up Lord and all over the place
[2:00:14] it's not on your account Lord I look at
[2:00:19] myself the Father I pray that Lord that
[2:00:23] the fault the word itself alone
[2:00:27] would strike Lord each of our hearts
[2:00:32] Lord that he would bring comfort Lord to
[2:00:36] our lives as children of God but I pray
[2:00:40] that it would bring conviction Lord to
[2:00:43] hearts and lives God to realize more
[2:00:47] that there is a deeper life Lord I pray
[2:00:52] that God that he would stir within each
[2:00:55] of our hearts because even Lord as we
[2:01:00] can look Lord in our lives and for those
[2:01:02] Lord those of us law that is passed from
[2:01:06] death unto life
[2:01:08] Oh God may Our Lives Lord truly be lived
[2:01:13] with conviction like that Lord of that
[2:01:17] young man who was in the field he was
[2:01:21] Lord he was operating in that field with
[2:01:23] conviction when the rest Lord would look
[2:01:26] upon him Lord and see his life Lord yet
[2:01:31] it was with conviction Lord and he was
[2:01:34] moving Lord it was a character Lord that
[2:01:37] stood out from all the rest not
[2:01:38] something than Lord that he had to do
[2:01:41] but it's because he recognized who he

[2:07:16] [Music]
[2:07:18] for
[2:07:20] [Music]
[2:07:31] [Music]
[2:07:33] born again born again there's really
[2:07:35] been a change in me born again there's
[2:07:39] really been a change in me
[2:07:41] amen Oh ain't that wonderful it brings a
[2:07:46] change down on the inside the desire
[2:07:48] it's completely changes our life has
[2:07:52] changed
[2:07:53] Oh God
[2:07:57] [Music]
[2:08:28] yeah
[2:08:30] [Music]
[2:08:49] [Music]
[2:09:06] [Music]
[2:09:37] [Music]
[2:09:41] hallelujah I don't know yet so true so
[2:09:46] clear the real truth what tells you and
[2:09:49] I that we have been born again is the
[2:09:53] identity we find in the Word of God
[2:09:58] the message clearly reveals to us the
[2:10:01] real birth it lets you and I know that
[2:10:06] real true reality now listen friends a
[2:10:09] person could say I felt this or I felt
[2:10:11] that those are all wonderful things but
[2:10:14] everything else after it's the life that
[2:10:17] follows because remember the Prophet Lee
[2:10:22] that are very clear in the hour that
[2:10:24] we're standing in the Holy Spirit comes
[2:10:27] with a plummet in his hand a plumb line
[2:10:32] it measures all of Jerusalem to see
[2:10:34] everything isn't up to the standard of
[2:10:37] where it needs to be and the Prophet
[2:10:40] when he makes that declaration he says
[2:10:43] what has caused all the confusion he
[2:10:46] says the reason is his experiences he's
[2:10:50] not saying that you don't need an
[2:10:51] experience but he's saying all these
[2:10:55] experiences he said but let us come back
[2:10:57] to the word as our plumb because the
[2:11:01] word will always declare a true
[2:11:04] experience after Paul look after what
[2:11:08] happened to Paul Paul didn't know what
[2:11:10] it what had taken place he knew he had
[2:11:12] met Jesus but here he went into the
[2:11:16] desert three years and he looked into
[2:11:20] the word I hope you're hearing me those
[2:11:23] things of God helps me to tarry on
[2:11:24] there's a lot of things I've already
[2:11:25] been studying before the Philippines on
[2:11:27] these things if you look into it don't
[2:11:30] look and look at your thoughts of
[2:11:32] yourself don't look at your wanderings
[2:11:35] what do I do
[2:11:36] look into the world the word tells you
[2:11:41] the word reveals to you who you are
[2:11:45] the word gives you solid ground to put
[2:11:47] your feet upon is that right Paul looked
[2:11:52] into the word and what Paul looked into
[2:11:54] the word Paul said that experience was
[2:11:55] of God and when he knew that experience
[2:11:59] was of God Paul went running so don't be
[2:12:04] entertained with your thoughts look into
[2:12:07] the word remember the Prophet said
[2:12:09] concerning his jacket he said my jacket
[2:12:10] doesn't match my pants he said but
[2:12:12] there's one thing that I'm glad that
[2:12:14] does match my experience matches the
[2:12:17] word that's what's important our
[2:12:20] experience matches the word and you know
[2:12:21] what your experience is your experience
[2:12:24] my experience is my experience but in
[2:12:27] each of those that true experience
[2:12:29] brings us in to the body of Jesus Christ
[2:12:33] nobody taught it into us
[2:12:35] nobody schooled it into it in that
[2:12:41] wonderful God seeking you and I out and
[2:12:44] so when the word is dealing with your
[2:12:46] heart even as I said is it dealing with
[2:12:48] a loved one allow God that word is
[2:12:50] sitting under that word and the presence
[2:12:52] of that word and that life sometimes you
[2:12:54] can't even get a word in maybe with
[2:12:56] loved ones but you know what you are the
[2:12:59] light jesus said you are the light the
[2:13:08] light has come to light you up you are
[2:13:11] the light of this age the prophets that
[2:13:13] your duty is to express God he said the
[2:13:16] church you're setting it is - it is for
[2:13:18] you - your duty to express God it's your
[2:13:20] duty to express God in your neighborhood
[2:13:22] your duty to express God on your job you
[2:13:24] are the light is that right it's the
[2:13:29] expression sometimes it's not what we
[2:13:31] say it's our life
[2:13:33] let let let that light burn so bright
[2:13:36] that all the people see is the light and
[2:13:37] they don't see me
[2:13:38] that's my design Lord let it not be me I
[2:13:41] want him to see you is that right I
[2:13:44] don't want to see the jeans of browning
[2:13:46] I want to see the gene of God amen and
[2:13:50] the genes of browning I want those genes
[2:13:52] are browning I can't wait so there's a
[2:13:54] change there right the old sticky Kaka
[2:13:58] bro part that it's still there but
[2:14:00] thanks be to God there's a hidden power
[2:14:02] a strength on the inside I reach in here
[2:14:09] even just keep on rolling for these
[2:14:11] things
[2:14:12] amen I trust that the Word of God I
[2:14:14] trust that the word has been an
[2:14:17] enrichment to your life
[2:14:19] I trust the Friends of God strengthens
[2:14:21] you in your life and you walk maybe you
[2:14:24] walked in here discouraged you walked in
[2:14:25] with something in your life but you walk
[2:14:27] uneasy wait a minute this is my
[2:14:29] jurisdiction

[2:14:32] daughter of God I don't have to lay
[2:14:34] underneath this this has no part in this
[2:14:37] ground so thankful to see mr. Shirley
[2:14:46] [Applause]
[2:15:02] also it doesn't remind you I've been
[2:15:05] sending up the text is much just trying
[2:15:08] to send it out as much as I could

[2:15:12] didn't I don't we have an update rather
[2:15:13] Chuck keeps sending me things quite
[2:15:15] frequently I don't have an update as of
[2:15:18] right now this this morning but you know
[2:15:20] it's just it's been like a rollercoaster
[2:15:22] there's been things that even after we
[2:15:24] left out of your prayer meeting on
[2:15:25] Tuesday night I no sooner made it to my
[2:15:26] car on Tuesday night at a prayer meeting
[2:15:28] and I received the text and and it was
[2:15:31] things to where the doctors had just
[2:15:32] given up hope and the doctors the one
[2:15:34] we're not gonna take the case and we're
[2:15:35] not gonna do this you know it's just
[2:15:38] those things if humanly it would be a
[2:15:41] safe place for us to entertain that but
[2:15:44] you know what there's something there of
[2:15:47] how that God gives us the strength to
[2:15:50] look beyond that to know that and all
[2:15:52] these things God it's in his hands the
[2:15:56] doctors we don't we were thankful
[2:15:59] thankful to God for the doctors they've
[2:16:01] done all they can do yeah they're doing
[2:16:03] all they can do they they wouldn't want
[2:16:04] to see her die or I want to pass on but
[2:16:07] you know it's it's always been and it is
[2:16:10] in God's hands so I'm just asking you
[2:16:12] whether you know the text comes out or
[2:16:14] not I just I send it a lot of times it's
[2:16:16] brother Chuck will relay things to me
[2:16:18] that keep sister Elizabeth Collins in
[2:16:20] your prayers
[2:16:32] I want you to forgive me I just had
[2:16:37] something on my heart and it was been
[2:16:41] burned on my heart to get up
[2:16:43] give a little testimony and sing I I I
[2:16:48] didn't do it
[2:16:49] and I'm sorry but I want to share
[2:16:52] something with you that I was thinking
[2:16:53] about this morning it I'd shared with
[2:16:55] her brother out in the parking lot and
[2:16:58] there's thinking back of before I was
[2:17:01] becoming Christian before God changed my
[2:17:03] life I was thinking about going down the
[2:17:06] road over there and urine on my old
[2:17:08] Harley Davidson and I wasn't good shape
[2:17:13] and I wasn't even holding on to the
[2:17:15] handlebars and that was one of those I
[2:17:17] let go it just kept going it didn't back
[2:17:19] off but I think of all those things that
[2:17:22] we each could of the grace of God in our
[2:17:25] life if I'd hit a bump I might not have
[2:17:27] been here talking to you but the grace
[2:17:30] of God and it's mercy and then you know
[2:17:34] one day he moved us from here and over
[2:17:36] to Bayview and he began to deal with my
[2:17:38] heart and I didn't know what was God but
[2:17:40] I told surely won't even honey turn off
[2:17:42] the television it's turned off on a
[2:17:44] sweeter Bible there was something in
[2:17:46] there from a child my family was
[2:17:48] Pentecostal dad was a preacher but he
[2:17:50] had strayed there was something that
[2:17:52] they had said that I would read my Bible
[2:17:55] and you know but I didn't know him but
[2:17:58] there was something that said it stuck
[2:18:00] with me it said before Jesus comes
[2:18:02] there'll be squishes it has to be
[2:18:04] fulfilled so God was pulling but I
[2:18:09] couldn't stop drinking and smoking I I
[2:18:11] just I would try I couldn't do it but I
[2:18:15] went down I would went down to Virginia
[2:18:17] I my sister and then they God had
[2:18:21] already brought him into this message
[2:18:22] and and they were saying you know God
[2:18:25] sent a prophet that's all over sure and
[2:18:27] they said talking through and I said
[2:18:30] would you like to hear some how it and I
[2:18:31] said okay and they put a message on and
[2:18:35] it was this day the Scriptures fulfilled
[2:18:37] that caught my heart that sounded real
[2:18:41] and I begin to listen and and you know
[2:18:44] as I listened and it come to the last
[2:18:46] and that discernment
[2:18:47] I said that's God that's real that man
[2:18:50] couldn't be doing it he couldn't know
[2:18:51] that God has to be showing him that and
[2:18:54] you know right then God took drinking
[2:18:56] and smoking out of my life he just tuck
[2:18:58] it away you know what they just did it
[2:19:02] and from there on he began to walk with
[2:19:05] me and deal in my life and I just I know
[2:19:07] all of you has a testimony but I just
[2:19:09] wanted to share that with me I'm sorry
[2:19:11] God forgive me it was on my heart and I
[2:19:14] didn't do it or Jesus calmly Lord we
[2:19:18] just thank you with all our beings Lord
