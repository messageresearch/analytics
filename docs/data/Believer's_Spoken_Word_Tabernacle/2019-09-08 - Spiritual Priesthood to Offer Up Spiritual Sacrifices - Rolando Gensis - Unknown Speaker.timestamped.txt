[37:41] has already went forth behold the
[37:44] bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him
[37:49] amen
[37:51] thank God for ears to hear what the
[37:54] Spirit say it to the churches hey man
[37:57] you know the Bible tells us in the last
[37:59] days is said it'll be a famine and have
[38:01] been in the Book of Amos and it will not
[38:03] be a famine it said for bread and water
[38:05] but it'll be a famine for the hearing of
[38:08] the word of God and when you think of it
[38:11] it's not just hearing scriptures and
[38:14] chapters and and so forth but it's
[38:16] hearing so that famine is result of the
[38:20] inability to hear but to be able to hear
[38:24] then you're able to feast you're able to
[38:28] feast and find and hear and receive and
[38:31] be benefited I'll tell your friends more
[38:33] and more that and when I look at it in
[38:35] God's grace and what God continues to
[38:37] unfold I see more and more it's the
[38:39] grace of God that's all I see it's God's
[38:42] grace it's nothing I've done it's
[38:44] nothing I could do it's nothing I've
[38:46] merited but it is simply the grace of
[38:49] Almighty God it's not that many of us
[38:52] it's not that we have some great astute
[38:54] mind to be able to understand things we
[38:57] could read and read the scriptures you
[38:58] realize that brother Bram tells us he
[39:00] said you can listen to this message he
[39:02] said you can listen to it 24 hours a day
[39:05] every day of the week but if the Spirit
[39:07] of God is not on the inside to teach you
[39:09] he said you'll never understand it the
[39:14] Pharisees they didn't understand it they
[39:16] knew the word but they did not know the
[39:18] author of the word how precious it is to
[39:21] know the author of the word then when he
[39:23] shows up you're always going to
[39:25] recognize you
[39:27] amen we're waiting on his coming aren't
[39:29] we and I believe he's coming this
[39:32] morning y'all believe he's coming this
[39:36] morning now he may not come this morning
[39:38] in his corporal body and us be raptured
[39:40] but he's gonna come here this morning
[39:42] he's going to speak to us and this whole
[39:45] gathering is us getting ready and the
[39:48] preparation for that coming of the Lord
[39:51] you realize that this right here is a
[39:53] great type right here Paul laid it down
[39:56] by us coming together in the house of
[39:58] God we are gathering unto Him that one
[40:00] of these days one of these days when the
[40:04] dead in Christ shall rise we which are
[40:06] alive and remain will be getting
[40:08] together here on this earth this is only
[40:12] a rehearsal of what's gonna take place
[40:16] amen aren't you grateful to the Lord
[40:18] amen it's so good to be a Christian I
[40:21] just thinking of that this morning I
[40:22] woke up and I said Lord what a privilege
[40:25] it is to serve you
[40:26] it's a greatest privilege it is to serve
[40:29] the Lord and you know I just say it like
[40:31] this and I pray you don't misunderstand
[40:33] me but if there was not a heaven to go
[40:35] to there was nothing after this I
[40:38] wouldn't change what I'm doing for one
[40:41] thing I wouldn't change how I'm living
[40:43] I'm not living this way because of
[40:45] something I live like this because I
[40:48] love him he changed me is that how you
[40:52] feel
[40:53] amen well we're just we're just so
[40:56] appreciative of the Lord I want to say
[40:58] as we're getting ready to lift up the
[40:59] mission offering here first of all I
[41:02] need to apologize to you because I told
[41:04] you I was gonna send you that link where
[41:06] they talked about the Spanish
[41:07] translation project and I I started
[41:10] working on it and getting that link for
[41:12] you and then got sidetracked and so I I
[41:15] have it for you two to give out to you
[41:17] so that you can look at that or brother
[41:20] Eli had brought last Saturday their
[41:22] brother Paul's and I want you if you get
[41:24] a chance to to listen to that and I'm
[41:27] just so thankful to the Lord for what
[41:29] God has done I think what brother Eli
[41:32] had mentioned that they're still have
[41:34] the remaining 200 they're already
[41:35] translated they're just processing that
[41:37] right now
[41:38] it should be here by the Lord willing by
[41:40] the beginning of 2020 every single
[41:43] message in Spanish will be uploaded

[41:54] our little part that we've had has just

[42:03] things that we have right now we kind of
[42:05] have in some instances we use our
[42:08] devices and we use a lot of other things
[42:09] like that but there is so many of those
[42:12] places they don't even have devices to
[42:15] use when you get out into the country in
[42:17] other places like that and that's why
[42:18] the need has went forth and different
[42:21] brothers are even printing they're doing
[42:24] a lot of printing we're coming out of
[42:25] China they found places to print that
[42:27] then get it shipped to other places
[42:28] because there's no longer any printing
[42:31] going on and I didn't know if you were
[42:32] aware of that the voice of God is no
[42:34] longer printing the message its handing
[42:36] out tablets but we there's many that
[42:40] still need the word in a printed and it
[42:43] needs the Holy Ghost to quicken it amen
[42:47] so we just want to just want to keep

[45:51] amen god bless you as you give I want to
[45:54] ask have a brother here this morning a
[45:58] friend and brother that brother Jerry
[46:01] and myself when we went to the
[46:03] Philippines there two years ago brother
[46:06] LAN LAN we had a camp meeting that we
[46:09] started with and over in the island of
[46:12] caballo and you can only fly in there
[46:15] right now on two different days of the
[46:17] week and fly in and out so we were there
[46:20] with the saints of God just had a
[46:22] wonderful time with brother LAN LAN and
[46:25] and his his family and the believers
[46:27] that were gathered there and others that
[46:29] came in brother LAN LAN was has reached
[46:32] out to us this year and been able to
[46:35] come by and to share the Word of God
[46:37] with us and what God has put on his
[46:39] heart and I I just want to say I so
[46:41] appreciate our brothers burden and
[46:44] vision there's been a lot of outreach
[46:46] and and work that our brother has done
[46:48] and a lot of things even he was sharing
[46:50] with us here the other night when the
[46:53] typhoon high end had hit into the
[46:55] Philippines and not all not all the
[46:58] Philippines was was taken down by that
[47:00] that typhoon but there were certain
[47:03] places and certain islands that were
[47:07] really really affected because of its
[47:09] pattern and the Lord just allowed our
[47:11] brother to be used and they were able to
[47:14] go and minister to the different needs
[47:16] of the Saints that were there and how
[47:19] the many of them had lost everything
[47:21] they had and then how that God you know
[47:24] had used them in the local assemblies
[47:26] and one of the testimonies that brother
[47:28] LAN LAN had received from even local
[47:30] people is that even with what God had
[47:34] equipped them to be able to do there
[47:36] were things that the government and no
[47:38] one else had been able to do that and
[47:40] you know how it is in many of those
[47:41] cases government can send in food they
[47:44] can send in supplies sometimes
[47:46] unfortunately there's not always the
[47:48] people above who's honest and they lock
[47:51] it up and instead of giving it out it's
[47:53] locked up so you know we the one thing
[47:56] that was tested testified is how that
[47:58] God had taken just the group of
[48:00] believers that they hadn't been able to
[48:01] minister to the needs of his children
[48:03] I'll tell you what we
[48:05] still we're serving a God who can take
[48:07] you can take just loaves and fishes and
[48:10] can multiply it to see that it meets the
[48:13] needs a men he's more than enough any
[48:16] amen so we just want to just welcome
[48:19] brother LAN LAN here this morning and
[48:20] his family is just a just a real
[48:24] blessing I'll tell you every one of them
[48:26] are just really talented musicians and
[48:28] can sing so we just want to welcome
[48:31] brother LAN LAN and just ask that God
[48:33] will just just make him feel at home
[48:35] here
[48:35] this morning and we want to pull on the
[48:38] gift of God I believe that God knows
[48:40] what we have need of God can take God
[48:43] can take a man that is from clear the
[48:45] other side of the globe and God will
[48:48] direct that man to speak exactly what
[48:51] you and I have need of that's the kind
[48:53] of God we serve amen
[48:56] so let's just let's let's just look to
[48:58] the Lord as our brother would come amen
[49:00] and brother LAN LAN we're glad to have
[49:02] you here this morning with us amen come

[52:21] that we have yesterday last night and
[52:34] just pray for me hallelujah and I regret
[52:43] everybody to please stand then
[52:56] let us open our Bible in the book of
[52:58] Romans chapter 15
[53:11] from verse 1 up to verse 4
[53:22] and before we will approach the world
[53:24] let us bow our heads and let us approach
[53:28] the author of this word their Heavenly
[53:32] Father once again we thank you Lord God
[53:34] for another opportunity that you have
[53:37] given me giving us Lord God to read and
[53:40] to hear you word and Lord God Alleluia
[53:44] as we know Lord Jesus that there is a
[53:47] scripture that is written in this Bible
[53:50] Alleluia that is not under your the
[53:53] inspiration of the Holy Spirit and Lord
[53:56] God Alleluia and our human mind cannot
[53:59] understand it it is impossible for us to
[54:02] understand it without the Holy Spirit
[54:05] Alleluia to teach us Lord God and I pray
[54:08] this morning
[54:09] Alleluia that q.l sent down the Holy
[54:11] Spirit to anoint you word annoying
[54:14] dearest instrument and also Lord God the
[54:17] hearer in the name of Jesus Christ we
[54:20] pray amen Alleluia Romans chapter 15
[54:24] verses 1 to 4 says within that our
[54:28] strong October the infirmities of the
[54:31] weak and not to please ourselves let
[54:35] every one of us please his neighbor for
[54:38] his good to edification for even Christ
[54:41] please not himself
[54:43] but as it is written the reproaches of
[54:46] them that reproached thee fell on me
[54:49] and verse more for whatsoever things
[54:52] were written aforetime were written for
[54:55] our learning that we through patience
[54:58] and comfort of the Scriptures might have
[55:01] hope one thing one more scripture in a
[55:07] first Peter chapter 2
[55:10] let us read verse verse five
[55:20] it says ye also as lively stones are
[55:25] built up a spiritual house and house
[55:30] and holy priesthood to offer up
[55:32] spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
[55:35] by Jesus Christ and me the Lord at
[55:39] blessing upon the reading of his word
[55:40] and you may be seated in the presence of
[55:43] the Lord
[55:44] Alleluia so brother Samuel and brother
[55:53] Jerry they had been in my place and they
[55:57] had been a great blessing to the
[55:59] believers in our islands and the nearby
[56:03] places there hallelujah and actually the
[56:09] church had been expecting for them to
[56:13] come this year but because of lack of
[56:18] communication I do not have
[56:22] any communication with brother Samuel so
[56:25] it seems there is a conflict on the
[56:27] schedule Alleluia and maybe this time
[56:32] they could not be able to come to our
[56:34] place but we know that there is always a
[56:40] time for everything and I am still
[56:42] hoping and praying that God will bring
[56:47] them again to the minister to us
[56:51] Alleluia so this morning I would like to
[56:57] speak on the subject spiritual
[57:00] priesthood to offer up spiritual
[57:02] sacrifices Alleluia spiritual priesthood
[57:09] to offer up spiritual sacrifices now we
[57:15] see in the Old Testament that the
[57:18] priests drr peculiar people and the lib
[57:26] hallelujah D are a group of people who
[57:30] lived not for themselves but the belief
[57:34] Alleluia are dedicated and a consecrated
[57:38] lives Alleluia to serve God and to serve
[57:41] their brethren Alleluia and didn't care
[57:47] so much on the things of the world
[57:50] Alleluia but
[57:54] they live
[57:57] hallelujah in the temple and didn't even
[58:00] have portion on the land
[58:03] Alleluia but their portion is gone
[58:06] hallelujah although they don't have
[58:08] portion or inheritance and natural
[58:12] inheritance which is the natural land
[58:15] but God took care of them
[58:18] Galleria poor God is their portion
[58:20] Alleluia and they didn't care so much on
[58:23] material things but they are more on the
[58:26] spiritual side Alleluia and in our time
[58:33] Alleluia if we read Revelation chapter 5
[58:38] after the lamp had taken the book from
[58:42] him that sat on the throne hallelujah
[58:45] and and the Bible said that he had made
[58:47] us unto our God kings and priests and we
[58:51] shall reign on the earth hallelujah so
[58:55] we are and as a Apostle Peter say that
[58:58] we are and a peculiar people we are a
[59:03] chosen generation a peculiar people a
[59:06] royal priesthood Alleluia and to offer
[59:09] up spiritual sacrifices there is a
[59:13] ministry that we are going to do
[59:14] hallelujah is to to open up spiritual
[59:18] sacrifices now natural Israel is type 2
[59:25] the church which is the spiritual Israel
[59:28] Alleluia and this time I would like to
[59:32] take an example Israel's journey from
[59:37] Egypt into the Promised Land and burnham
[59:41] said that many people refer the promised
[59:45] land to the Millennium and he said it is
[59:48] not hallelujah the promised land had
[59:51] Wars and killings the Millennium won't
[59:54] have any words or killings hallelujah
[59:58] and the promised land it referred to the
[1:00:01] Holy Spirit the battleground
[1:00:03] hallelujah so once we became a part of
[1:00:08] that body baptized by one spirit
[1:00:11] into that body Alleluia and brahbrah ham
[1:00:16] say that we are not on a picnic we are
[1:00:20] on a battleground not like us these
[1:00:24] megachurches
[1:00:25] you know sometimes we can hear them
[1:00:27] their members are Wendy testifies that
[1:00:30] since I become a part of this big church
[1:00:34] I became a Christian I don't have any
[1:00:37] problem hallelujah
[1:00:40] I am always happy and you know no
[1:00:43] brothers and sisters once we separate
[1:00:47] hallelujah became separated from Satan
[1:00:51] hallelujah and then he became our enemy
[1:00:56] or we become his enemy then all the
[1:01:00] forces of Satan is pointing on us 24/7
[1:01:05] so we are on this we are not on a picnic
[1:01:08] and we are on a battleground hallelujah
[1:01:11] now in Israel's journey to the promised
[1:01:15] land there were three stages as we have
[1:01:19] also the same Christa gist of grace for
[1:01:24] the church hallelujah from justification
[1:01:27] sanctification and baptism of the Holy
[1:01:29] Spirit baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:31] justification hallelujah after they left
[1:01:34] Egypt by believing the world disapper
[1:01:38] acted themselves from the Egyptians
[1:01:39] disappear separated themselves from from
[1:01:42] the world and then the next stage is
[1:01:45] after the cross Red Sea that was
[1:01:49] sanctification hallelujah and killed
[1:01:54] everything from Egypt was killed were
[1:02:00] killed be handed hallelujah and they
[1:02:02] were sanctified through the blood
[1:02:04] hallelujah that kills all the human
[1:02:07] desires of evil
[1:02:08] and then the last stage is the baptism
[1:02:12] of the Holy Ghost that was when early
[1:02:15] after the cross Jordan and started to
[1:02:19] possess the promised land
[1:02:21] hallelujah but brothers and sisters as
[1:02:25] Barbara Ham say that the redemption is
[1:02:29] in two parts or twofold number one is
[1:02:34] coming out and the number two is going
[1:02:38] in early ie it is not only coming out
[1:02:42] and then God for so claim in the
[1:02:45] wilderness but God is trying to bring
[1:02:48] them hallelujah to possess or to enter
[1:02:51] into the Promised Land but before after
[1:02:55] the cross Red Sea or he came out of
[1:02:59] Egypt and before the inter into the
[1:03:02] promised land
[1:03:02] they have go OPS's a process of
[1:03:06] sanctification Alleluia and God sent
[1:03:10] down his word to his prophet Moses
[1:03:14] hallelujah and those who refused God was
[1:03:19] cleansing them hallelujah God will not
[1:03:22] allow any man to enter into the Promised
[1:03:24] Land without first cleansing them
[1:03:26] cleaning them
[1:03:27] Alleluia and that's why the Bible says
[1:03:30] that all we had God destroy them in the
[1:03:34] wilderness because of unbelief it means
[1:03:38] to see they refused the word hallelujah
[1:03:40] that God was giving twist his prophet
[1:03:44] Alleluia so in God destroy them in the
[1:03:48] wilderness those who refused the word
[1:03:49] and after only brothers and sisters
[1:03:51] Alleluia it is the word that cleanses us
[1:03:54] Alleluia
[1:03:55] and that's why press and sisters we also
[1:03:58] have the same thing in our age area and
[1:04:01] you know God sent the message it is not
[1:04:05] only for us to have a strong doctrine
[1:04:09] that we can debate with other religion
[1:04:12] but every time you come to church
[1:04:15] Alleluia God is Attali cleansing as
[1:04:18] cleansing us Alleluia Ephesians 5:26 it
[1:04:22] says
[1:04:22] he might sanctify and cleanse it with
[1:04:25] the washing of water by the word
[1:04:29] hallelujah so the missus that we are you
[1:04:32] know it is preparing us it is cleansing
[1:04:35] us hallelujah now by the baptism of the
[1:04:39] Holy Ghost hallelujah then
[1:04:43] we are born again hallelujah we are born
[1:04:46] into the body hallelujah and for by one
[1:04:50] spirit we're all baptized into that one
[1:04:52] body and if we see brothers and sisters
[1:04:56] the greatest battle that happened in a
[1:04:59] time of Israel was not hallelujah after
[1:05:03] the cross
[1:05:05] rinsing or hallelujah they came out of
[1:05:09] Egypt but the greatest battle that
[1:05:12] happened in the time was when the cross
[1:05:16] children early after the cross Jordan
[1:05:20] not windy had just lived or came out of
[1:05:24] Egypt but windy start hallelujah to
[1:05:27] possess the promised land
[1:05:29] hallelujah then the battle was
[1:05:34] intensified hallelujah and we also have
[1:05:38] the same promise in the day of Pentecost
[1:05:41] of Apostle Peter said and the promise is
[1:05:47] unto you and unto your children and
[1:05:49] hallelujah once we started to possess
[1:05:51] that promise the life in the Holy Ghost
[1:05:54] hallelujah then the battle will be
[1:05:57] hallelujah intensified and you know
[1:06:01] brothers if you will just read the book
[1:06:04] of just wow that wind is not told how
[1:06:07] long we wait to possess the land and
[1:06:09] then Holloway conquered Jericho and
[1:06:12] other dia yeah yeah but how yeah windy
[1:06:18] he started Toto conquer them and then
[1:06:22] the kings of the land the the organize
[1:06:25] themselves hallelujah and it became the
[1:06:29] battles became more harder and harder
[1:06:31] that's the same thing brothers and
[1:06:33] sisters to our to our time hallelujah
[1:06:37] now
[1:06:39] natural battle
[1:06:41] hallelujah I believe that there are some
[1:06:45] of you here that became a soldier
[1:06:49] Marjorie he was a I I know he was a
[1:06:56] soldier before early and I don't know if
[1:07:00] there are some other brothers here
[1:07:02] Alleluia and the natural battle you will
[1:07:09] hardly win a battle without a proper
[1:07:14] team or or coordination Alleluia there
[1:07:20] must be a proper teamwork with each
[1:07:23] other
[1:07:24] Alleluia a proper communication a proper
[1:07:28] coordination that's why brothers and
[1:07:31] sisters the Philippines being an ally to
[1:07:34] the United States every year we have
[1:07:38] this we called it in our in our language
[1:07:43] Balikatan exercises poly-cotton military
[1:07:47] exercises every year they are doing it
[1:07:51] in the Philippines in the this time they
[1:07:53] are doing it in the South China Sea
[1:07:55] hallelujah as you know you know what is
[1:07:59] happening now in in the the South China
[1:08:02] Sea and
[1:08:05] Balikatan means shoulder-to-shoulder
[1:08:09] there is there is no worry and yet they
[1:08:12] are practicing to have a a good be more
[1:08:17] hallelujah so that in case the
[1:08:22] Philippines is being attacked by by an
[1:08:26] enemy or
[1:08:28] Olivia the United States is being
[1:08:31] attacked by any any country Alinea be
[1:08:35] already hub Olivia da da that P more
[1:08:39] they already know what to do
[1:08:42] hallelujah because we have been
[1:08:44] practicing it for so many years all away
[1:08:47] and the same things brothers and sisters
[1:08:49] hallelujah
[1:08:50] we are in this great battle and every
[1:08:55] believer every part of that battle we
[1:08:58] should have hallelujah proper
[1:09:02] teamwork earlier with each other
[1:09:05] Alleluia and when I I was looking and
[1:09:10] watching YouTube how this American
[1:09:15] forces invaded Iraq or Afghanistan
[1:09:20] beyond haba you know they have the
[1:09:24] ground forces with the with tungsten on
[1:09:27] them with them and then they also have
[1:09:30] they artillery we have the Air Force and
[1:09:33] we needed some missile then there is the
[1:09:37] there are ships Olivia from the Navy
[1:09:40] that can launch missile Alleluia and
[1:09:43] even though how how what kind of bomb
[1:09:47] training the ground forces behave
[1:09:50] hallelujah
[1:09:52] the hub dad the bullet proof and they
[1:09:56] have these night-vision goggles and full
[1:09:59] of ammunition and high-powered guns but
[1:10:02] brothers sisters if we are just
[1:10:04] depending on them on their training on
[1:10:06] their ability without an Air Force
[1:10:09] hallelujah they cannot win the battle it
[1:10:13] would be hard for them to win the battle
[1:10:15] and then sometimes they say that those
[1:10:19] who dominate the air alia be win the
[1:10:23] battle and you can see that that China
[1:10:27] they have millions and millions of
[1:10:30] soldiers while the American forces I
[1:10:34] think they only have more than 300,000
[1:10:37] active soldiers and we have more than
[1:10:43] 400 reservists but the submission the
[1:10:48] civilian we have every one of them they
[1:10:50] have guns
[1:10:51] hallelujah but we have hala we had the
[1:10:54] biggest
[1:10:56] air force in the world Alleluia and
[1:10:59] didn't operate you know
[1:11:01] although the China they have millions of
[1:11:04] soldiers but because we have a power
[1:11:08] from above
[1:11:09] Alleluia and he believed he will win the
[1:11:14] battle hallelujah
[1:11:16] and the same thing brothers and sisters
[1:11:18] know how good we are how righteous we
[1:11:21] are how ability we have if we don't have
[1:11:24] a power from above earlier a power
[1:11:27] communica a proper communication
[1:11:29] hallelujah to the power above we will
[1:11:34] never win the battle
[1:11:36] Samson he was known Elisha Hawaii of his
[1:11:39] strength but when he lost his contact
[1:11:42] hallelujah to God hallelujah he lost the
[1:11:46] battle hallelujah now on the ground
[1:11:51] forces
[1:11:53] we have to fight shoulder-to-shoulder
[1:11:57] hallelujah
[1:11:58] although he feel upset to his fellow
[1:12:02] soldier just like in mean I was young we
[1:12:08] have a military camp near to our place
[1:12:12] and sometimes they when they don't have
[1:12:16] any operation be good to houses and some
[1:12:20] places and you know drinking and after
[1:12:24] drinking windy they get drunk and
[1:12:26] sometimes the you know fight with each
[1:12:29] other and they feel they have some
[1:12:32] differences but when we go hallelujah to
[1:12:36] the battle we have to forget everything
[1:12:39] hallelujah we have to support one with
[1:12:42] each other we have to fight
[1:12:43] shoulder-to-shoulder we have to protect
[1:12:46] his fellow soldier hallelujah
[1:12:49] as well as his fellow soldier can
[1:12:52] protect him too it's the same thing with
[1:12:55] us brothers and sisters and we should
[1:12:57] know who is our enemy Illya sometimes
[1:13:00] you feel upset with the with brothers or
[1:13:02] with sister but brother sisters you need
[1:13:05] to support them we need to support with
[1:13:08] each other
[1:13:09] hallelujah now hallelujah and so I bar
[1:13:19] Burnham say that eternal life is living
[1:13:22] for others Alleluia it is not just for
[1:13:26] yourself when you got eternal life he
[1:13:28] said he was just one man the perfect man
[1:13:33] He gave His life and he made an example
[1:13:35] for you now what must we do now the
[1:13:39] first thing I want to say is Jesus never
[1:13:42] lived for himself
[1:13:44] his life was spent for others the same
[1:13:48] thing Paul was saying and on the on the
[1:13:51] scripture that we read in hallelujah in
[1:13:53] Romans chapter 15 hallelujah his life
[1:13:59] was spent for others that's perfectly
[1:14:01] eternal life when you say you go to
[1:14:04] church and you know good things that's
[1:14:06] fine but when you live for your life
[1:14:10] Olivia to yourself you have an eternal
[1:14:14] life for eternal life is living for
[1:14:18] others that's why Paul said we then that
[1:14:21] are strong alleluia ought to bear the
[1:14:24] infirmities of the weak hallelujah
[1:14:28] hallelujah and not to please ourselves
[1:14:34] we then that are strong those who are
[1:14:37] strong alleluia ought to bear the
[1:14:40] infirmities of the weak and the question
[1:14:46] is how can you bear the infirmities of
[1:14:50] the weak
[1:14:52] when you yourself this week
[1:14:55] hallelujah we knew yourself are our
[1:15:01] babies children hallelujah that's why
[1:15:08] one of the reason that God gave us the
[1:15:12] fivefold ministry hallelujah is in order
[1:15:16] for us to not to remain children if you
[1:15:21] read in efficient chapter 4 verse 11 he
[1:15:23] says and he gave some apostles and some
[1:15:25] prophets and some evangelists and some
[1:15:28] pastors and teachers the purpose is for
[1:15:32] the perfect thing of the Saints for the
[1:15:34] work of the ministry for the edifying
[1:15:38] edifying of the body of Christ the word
[1:15:42] perfect or perfect it doesn't mean that
[1:15:46] you don't have any mistake because the
[1:15:50] Prophet said as long as we are in this
[1:15:52] place we always have this sticky nature
[1:15:56] that's why God will you know change this
[1:15:59] this body hallelujah we always commit
[1:16:03] mistake but the word perfect here it
[1:16:07] means full grown matured hallelujah to
[1:16:12] be an adult and not to remain children
[1:16:15] for the perfecting of the Saints for the
[1:16:18] work of the ministry in order for us to
[1:16:19] be you know full grown to be matured
[1:16:22] Alleluia till we all come in the unity
[1:16:25] of the faith and of the knowledge of the
[1:16:26] Son of God unto a perfect man and to an
[1:16:30] adult and a matured man unto the measure
[1:16:33] of the stature of the fullness of Christ
[1:16:36] so that Alleluia we henceforth be no
[1:16:40] more children but adult only about
[1:16:44] matured Alleluia toast
[1:16:48] those to and fro and carried about with
[1:16:51] every wind of doctrine by the sleight of
[1:16:53] men and cunning craftiness whereby they
[1:16:56] lie in wait to deceive in order for us
[1:17:00] not to remain children Olivia that's
[1:17:03] that is our hallelujah being a minister
[1:17:07] being a pastor it's always our desire
[1:17:10] how do we have to see the church to see
[1:17:13] the believers Alleluia being matured in
[1:17:16] the faith established in the faith
[1:17:17] Alleluia
[1:17:19] that's why even Paul one time Alleluia
[1:17:23] in he wrote his epistle tada believe the
[1:17:26] Hebrew believers in Hebrews chapter 5
[1:17:28] verse 2 lb says for when for the time ye
[1:17:32] ought to be teachers he have made that
[1:17:35] one PTO again which be the first
[1:17:39] principles of the Oracles of God and ye
[1:17:43] are become such as have need of milk and
[1:17:46] not of strong meat I've been living and
[1:17:50] being pitching you Alawis and supposed
[1:17:53] to be you should have been much
[1:17:56] you became matured and here now you are
[1:17:59] still needing milk and not strong meat
[1:18:02] hallelujah you are still children
[1:18:05] hallelujah you really supposed to be a
[1:18:07] pitcher Alleluia
[1:18:09] that can can help those those that are
[1:18:12] weak but now you said Oh hallelujah how
[1:18:18] comes you are still
[1:18:21] children still needing mirror hallelujah
[1:18:25] now here are some signs of being a babe
[1:18:31] or being a child
[1:18:34] in first Corinthians chapter 3 verse 1
[1:18:38] he said and I brethren could not speak
[1:18:42] unto you as unto spiritual spiritual
[1:18:46] means you are mature I cannot speak to
[1:18:50] you being a matured one a spiritual one
[1:18:53] but as an to kernel kernel a beam
[1:18:58] but as and to Colonel even as unto babes
[1:19:03] in Christ for being in Christ no problem
[1:19:08] you are already in Christ but you are
[1:19:11] still a baby why because you are still
[1:19:15] Colonel Alleluia
[1:19:17] you should be spiritual you should be
[1:19:20] spiritual is a sign of being hallelujah
[1:19:25] a matured one
[1:19:27] hallelujah but carnality is childish oh
[1:19:33] babe I have video with milk and not with
[1:19:36] meat for hitherto we were not able to
[1:19:39] bear it neither yet now are you able for
[1:19:43] ye are yet colonel hallelujah
[1:19:45] so here are some some some manifestation
[1:19:50] of carnality which is a sign of being a
[1:19:53] babe for where whereas there is among yo
[1:19:57] inveighing and strife and divisions are
[1:20:01] ye not carnal and work as men for while
[1:20:05] one says I am a ball in another I am of
[1:20:08] apollos are ye not carnal hallelujah so
[1:20:13] we can see brothers and sisters that
[1:20:14] carnality Alleluia is a sign of being a
[1:20:19] babe
[1:20:19] Paul is attaching carnality to being a
[1:20:24] babe hallelujah and Hebrews chapter 5
[1:20:27] verse 13 he says for every one that uses
[1:20:30] milk is unskillful in the word of
[1:20:33] righteousness for he is a babe
[1:20:36] hallelujah
[1:20:38] and a babe is unskillful imagine
[1:20:43] brothers and sisters we are on this
[1:20:45] great battle and you both on the
[1:20:47] battlefield hallelujah and
[1:20:51] you are bringing somebody video to help
[1:20:54] you on the battle and you are bringing
[1:20:57] babes hallelujah so what what do you
[1:21:01] think would happen in the battle you are
[1:21:04] expecting you are meaning you know you
[1:21:07] bring you ha
[1:21:12] a lot of soldiers and all of them are
[1:21:15] babes hallelujah so how can be help
[1:21:22] earlier instead of a support
[1:21:26] they are just burden all of the way
[1:21:33] because babe carnality hallelujah the
[1:21:39] same thing and here is the sign of being
[1:21:43] a matured one
[1:21:47] John chapter 21 verse 18 he says verily
[1:21:51] verily I say unto thee when thou was
[1:21:54] young now goodness thyself and locust
[1:22:01] whether the wouldest but when thou shalt
[1:22:05] be old thou shalt stretch forth thy
[1:22:07] hands and another shall gird thee and
[1:22:10] carry thee whither thou what is not when
[1:22:14] a man is young whatever he wants to do
[1:22:19] he will do it we're even wherever he
[1:22:24] wants to go he will go and nobody can
[1:22:28] pitch him it is his will
[1:22:31] Alya he will do whatever he is Willis
[1:22:34] and then hallelujah
[1:22:38] when
[1:22:39] thou shalt became all hallelujah he just
[1:22:45] stretch forth thy hands hallelujah and
[1:22:49] somebody were good you and he will bring
[1:22:53] you into places where you don't want to
[1:22:57] go it means to say that when a man
[1:23:00] became all
[1:23:03] it is no longer he's no longer doing his
[1:23:07] own will but it is somebody's will ania
[1:23:12] is done in his life
[1:23:16] hallelujah just like Paul hallelujah in
[1:23:23] all his intellectual earnings he wants
[1:23:28] to do his own whim hallelujah and he was
[1:23:33] thinking he is supporting God he is
[1:23:36] supporting the believers and Christ said
[1:23:40] Jesus said you are persecuting me
[1:23:43] hallelujah
[1:23:52] but brothers resistors after Paul was
[1:23:56] converted
[1:24:02] after he became converted Alleluia and
[1:24:08] the you know brothers and sisters before
[1:24:11] he was thinking that he was doing the
[1:24:16] will of God
[1:24:18] allelujah he is so jealous for his his
[1:24:22] group he so jealous for his religion
[1:24:25] hallelujah and he is even using the same
[1:24:30] Bible hallelujah
[1:24:37] but you just said all you are kicking
[1:24:40] against the pricks you are persecuting
[1:24:44] me hallelujah he is persecuting the very
[1:24:48] god that he thinks you are serving but
[1:24:53] one day all was changed became converted
[1:24:58] hallelujah and one of his account this
[1:25:01] is Galatians chapter 2 verse 20 I am
[1:25:05] crucified with Christ nevertheless I
[1:25:08] live but it's no longer I that liveth it
[1:25:13] is Christ that lives in me leave it in
[1:25:15] me and the life which I now live in the
[1:25:18] flesh hallelujah live in the flesh I
[1:25:21] live by the faith of the Son of God who
[1:25:23] loved me and gave himself came early and
[1:25:26] that's why brothers and sisters
[1:25:27] sometimes he wants to go into this place
[1:25:30] but the Holy Spirit tells him told him
[1:25:35] not to go but you have to go this way
[1:26:02] it is no longer his will but somebody's
[1:26:05] will he is living

[1:34:41] the Bible says that there is there was a
[1:34:45] rock following them hallelujah
[1:34:48] and they are I believe brothers and
[1:34:51] sisters that at the time on on Kadesh
[1:34:54] Barnea Alleluia that be were not only
[1:34:57] for me but this is not a doctrine that I
[1:35:01] am you know they were not just two
[1:35:05] million in at the time because they left
[1:35:10] Egypt there were two million Israelites
[1:35:14] that left Egypt
[1:35:17] hallelujah and let me give you an
[1:35:21] example
[1:35:23] 32 years ago when I got married with my
[1:35:27] wife we were only two
[1:35:31] and after 13 years or 15 years we became
[1:35:38] 9 in the period of in that you know in
[1:35:45] just in 15 years
[1:35:46] how about the is 40 years how many do
[1:35:52] you think but I am NOT going to give you
[1:35:54] any figure you might say over Lennon is
[1:35:57] making a doctrine hallelujah and in our
[1:36:01] time especially here in the United
[1:36:05] States the people didn't want to help
[1:36:08] many children because the reason is it's
[1:36:13] hard to support them but in the
[1:36:17] wilderness hallelujah they don't have to
[1:36:22] worry because God is supplying all their
[1:36:26] needs maybe some of them they got 15
[1:36:30] children
[1:36:32] were children ten children Alleluia and
[1:36:35] they don't have to worry didn't let
[1:36:37] their children go to go to school they
[1:36:40] don't buy food they don't work they just
[1:36:43] eat sleep hallelujah
[1:36:46] they wake up there is already the manna
[1:36:49] you don't have to worry if they have a
[1:36:52] lot of children hallelujah and then when
[1:36:56] they were Alleluia in in
[1:37:00] right at the Jordan River hallelujah and
[1:37:06] Moses hallelujah sent them to search the
[1:37:11] land
[1:37:16] and then when they came home I believe
[1:37:19] processes data Moses chose a 1 in every
[1:37:25] tribe let me say in every 500,000 Moses
[1:37:33] just one hallelujah and like for example
[1:37:39] if if barrage theory is going to choose
[1:37:41] a brother in this come in his
[1:37:44] congregation to represent discharge I
[1:37:47] believe he is not going to choose
[1:37:49] somebody who is just a new in you know
[1:37:53] who's just new in in the congregation
[1:37:56] maybe I believe he is going to he is
[1:37:59] going to choose a matured brother
[1:38:03] hallelujah a matured one that will
[1:38:06] represent his church early and this I
[1:38:09] believe this is what Moses did to the
[1:38:12] congregation of Israel hallelujah he
[1:38:14] chose one in his tribe and then there
[1:38:18] were 12 spies that he sent to search the
[1:38:21] land and then after searching the land
[1:38:25] numbers chapter 13 verse 26 and they
[1:38:28] went and came to Moses and to Aaron and
[1:38:31] to all the congregation of the children
[1:38:33] of Israel and to the wilderness of Paran
[1:38:35] to Kadesh and brought back word unto
[1:38:39] them and unto all the congregation and
[1:38:41] showed them the fruit of the land and
[1:38:43] they told him and said we came unto the
[1:38:47] land whither thou sendest us and surely
[1:38:50] it floweth with milk and honey
[1:38:53] and there is the fruit a bit
[1:38:56] here is the problem in Alleluia
[1:39:01] truly the word that is true
[1:39:04] hallelujah you know nobody had been
[1:39:08] there hallelujah
[1:39:11] nobody had send the land yet but how
[1:39:16] they did know that the land is flowing
[1:39:19] with milk and honey that the land is fat
[1:39:21] it was only the Word of God described
[1:39:24] the land and when they discovered it
[1:39:27] praise God
[1:39:28] you might say the Word of God is true we
[1:39:31] imagined but resisters if you are going
[1:39:34] to to buy one pound of grapes this time
[1:39:38] maybe it's only one cluster is one one
[1:39:40] pound but during that time one cluster
[1:39:43] of grapes there were two men carrying it
[1:39:47] Moses prophet Moses the Word of God is
[1:39:50] true
[1:39:51] hallelujah but and for me hallelujah
[1:39:55] there is no reason that we are going to
[1:39:58] doubt the Word of God and then God told
[1:40:01] him hallelujah you go possess the land
[1:40:04] the brains alia that the sole of your
[1:40:07] foot shall played upon that land is
[1:40:10] yours don't be afraid for the battle is
[1:40:13] of the Lord hallelujah but brothers and
[1:40:16] sisters
[1:40:19] when they came back and they already
[1:40:22] have the fruit of the land the proof of
[1:40:25] the Word of God hallelujah bursting take
[1:40:28] nevertheless the people that be the
[1:40:32] people be strong that dwell in the land
[1:40:35] and the cities our world and very great
[1:40:38] and moreover we saw the children of n up
[1:40:42] there the Amalekites dwell in the land
[1:40:45] of the South the Hittites and the
[1:40:47] jebusites and the Emirates dwell in the
[1:40:49] in the mountains and the Canaanites
[1:40:51] dwell by the sea and by the coast of
[1:40:54] Jordan and calleb still the people
[1:40:58] before Moses and say let us go up at
[1:41:01] once and possess it for we are well able
[1:41:04] to overcome it but the man that went up
[1:41:09] with him said we not be able to go up
[1:41:13] against the people for they are stronger
[1:41:16] than we hallelujah and they brought up
[1:41:20] an evil report of the land which they
[1:41:23] had searched unto the children of Israel
[1:41:25] saying the land through which we have
[1:41:27] gone to search it is a land that ended
[1:41:30] up inhabitants thereof and all the
[1:41:34] people that we saw Alleluia in E in it
[1:41:38] are men of great stature
[1:41:42] and they're resolved the Giants the sons
[1:41:44] of enna which come of the Giants and we
[1:41:48] were owner on our own sight as
[1:41:51] grasshoppers and so we were in their
[1:41:55] sight
[1:41:56] imagine brothers and sisters men
[1:42:00] hallelujah who's supposed to be a
[1:42:04] matured ones hallelujah indeedy obscene
[1:42:09] be witness hallelujah the power of God
[1:42:13] in the wilderness
[1:42:15] and instead of holding just believing to
[1:42:18] what the word says then they start to
[1:42:22] give report hallelujah
[1:42:24] basing on their feelings on their
[1:42:28] emotions on what they see
[1:42:31] Alleluia of these other five senses
[1:42:35] missing the report they were basing on
[1:42:38] what they feel in their you know their
[1:42:43] fear hallelujah
[1:42:46] Colonel feelings and instead hallelujah
[1:42:51] to be a support instead to give aa
[1:42:53] courage to the people awliya because the
[1:42:58] debased hallelujah they depend on under
[1:43:02] emotion on their carnality instead of

[1:43:28] when the Gabe report basing on their
[1:43:32] carnality hallelujah it didn't help the
[1:43:37] congregation numbers chapter 14 verse 1
[1:43:40] and all the congregation lifted up their
[1:43:43] voice and cried and the people whip that
[1:43:46] night and all the children of Israel
[1:43:48] murmured against Moses and against Aaron
[1:43:50] and the whole congregation said unto
[1:43:53] them would God that we had died in the
[1:43:56] land of Egypt or would God we had died
[1:43:59] in this wilderness and wherefore hath

[1:44:16] good maybe it is better for us go to the
[1:44:21] world hallelujah why did we have that
[1:44:25] kind of decision

[1:49:11] all the congregation made stone with
[1:49:14] them with stones and the glory of the
[1:49:16] Lord departed in the tabernacle of the
[1:49:18] congregation before all the children of
[1:49:20] Israel and they rose up early in the
[1:49:23] morning and got them up into the top of
[1:49:25] the mountain saying lo we be here and
[1:49:28] we'll go up unto the place which the
[1:49:31] Lord had promised for we have seen and

[1:49:57] before you and ye shall fall by the
[1:50:00] sword because ye are turned away from
[1:50:02] the Lord therefore the Lord will not be
[1:50:05] with you but they presume to go up unto
[1:50:09] the hilltop nevertheless the Ark of the
[1:50:11] Covenant of the Lord and Moses departed
[1:50:13] not out of the camp then the Amalekites
[1:50:16] came down and the Canaanites which dwell
[1:50:19] in that hill and smote them and
[1:50:22] discomforted them even unto former
[1:50:28] millions maybe thousands maybe died at
[1:50:32] that time
[1:50:34] what is the reason hallelujah
[1:50:37] because of these people this spice that
[1:50:43] should be that we should supposed to be
[1:50:46] supposedly we should be a support a help
[1:50:50] hallelujah and because of their
[1:50:53] carnality and brought negative report to

[1:51:00] deaths it costs death for a lot of sin
[1:51:05] sir israelites
[1:51:06] elderly and brothers and sisters

[1:51:20] know the brother is like this the
[1:51:22] sisters like this
[1:51:24] don't allow any negative report to come
[1:51:28] in to the congregation you might be
[1:51:30] thinking this is just a simple thing
[1:51:32] hallelujah but brothers and sisters you
[1:51:34] don't know hallelujah
[1:51:37] what would be the result it might cause
[1:51:40] several deaths are we a spiritual death
[1:51:44] in the congregation don't allow any
[1:51:47] negative report Alleluia
[1:51:55] because of their carnality carnality is
[1:51:59] like children we hallelujah
[1:52:09] that I believe brothers listeners we
[1:52:10] have a lot of just went
[1:52:23] just what's up there five
[1:52:29] you
[1:52:30] versus two and five at that time the
[1:52:35] Lord said unto Joshua make these sharp
[1:52:38] knives and circumcise again the children
[1:52:41] of Israel the second time and just what
[1:52:44] made him sharp knives and circumcise the
[1:52:47] children of Israel at the hill of the
[1:52:49] foreskins
[1:52:51] and this is the causeway Joshua did
[1:52:55] circumcise all the people that came out
[1:52:57] of Egypt that were males even all the
[1:53:01] man o'war died in the wilderness by the
[1:53:04] way after they came out of Egypt
[1:53:06] and all the people that came out were
[1:53:11] circumcised but all the people that were
[1:53:13] born in the wilderness by the way as
[1:53:16] they came forth out of Egypt then we had
[1:53:19] not circumcise our brothers I'm sorry
[1:53:22] too for mentioning about these things
[1:53:25] but I believe that God did not put these
[1:53:29] things in a Bible without any
[1:53:33] significance or important things for us
[1:53:37] to know hallelujah now originally God's
[1:53:42] covenant to Abraham was to circumcise
[1:53:45] every male child after they were born
[1:53:48] areaa eight days after they were born
[1:53:52] hallelujah and I don't know how you do
[1:53:55] it here in in the Philippines in the
[1:53:57] United States we do it different in in
[1:53:59] the Philippines but for us believers we
[1:54:04] there
[1:54:06] circumcision or no circumcision it has
[1:54:10] nothing to do with our salvation because
[1:54:13] our circumcision is not in the flesh but
[1:54:16] it is in the heart
[1:54:19] Alleluia so by the baptism of the Holy
[1:54:21] Spirit so circumcision is a type of the
[1:54:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost hallelujah and
[1:54:29] then here is a thing brother sisters
[1:54:32] Yeshua was commanded to make not only
[1:54:36] prepare knives but make a sharp sharp
[1:54:40] knives hallelujah to circumcise all the
[1:54:46] men aboard earlier for Israel
[1:54:51] and the reason is all the men that came
[1:54:56] out of Egypt they were all circumcised
[1:54:58] but the men that were born in the
[1:55:01] wilderness
[1:55:02] nobody was circumcised the question is
[1:55:07] why
[1:55:09] hallelujah when they were in Egypt it's
[1:55:14] been it has been and when they were in
[1:55:18] Egypt they were busy people being
[1:55:24] enslaved earlier be are obligated you
[1:55:28] know to work but when they have the male
[1:55:32] child we still have time to circumcise
[1:55:36] the child and why is it that when they
[1:55:40] were in the wilderness we'll really have
[1:55:42] the profit maybe they can remember now
[1:55:45] the Covenant of God to Abram they have
[1:55:47] the pillar of fire the you know they go
[1:55:51] to the to the tabernacle and the Bible
[1:55:54] said new one was being circumcised
[1:55:58] hallelujah in the wilderness one of the
[1:56:02] reason is circumcision is the type of
[1:56:05] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and in the
[1:56:08] wilderness it was not the baptism of the
[1:56:10] Holy Ghost it was the period of
[1:56:13] sanctification so nobody was get
[1:56:18] circumcised in the time
[1:56:21] and then when they entered into the
[1:56:25] promised land after crossing Jordan it
[1:56:28] is now
[1:56:29] Alleluia the time of the type of the
[1:56:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost and map is him
[1:56:35] of the Holy Ghost circumcision Alleluia
[1:56:37] is the same to us
[1:56:39] hallelujah they must have to do it and
[1:56:42] then one thing more when you circumcised
[1:56:50] and infant whether he liked it or not
[1:56:54] he can do nothing when the parents are
[1:56:58] circumcised a child we will just cry and
[1:57:02] it is not his own decision it is the
[1:57:08] decision of his father and his mother
[1:57:11] that's why brother sister Alleluia
[1:57:17] sometimes before we we heard this
[1:57:20] missings I mean the parents are
[1:57:23] Christians and the children also are
[1:57:25] Christians because the you are born in
[1:57:29] Alleluia in in a pair in a Christian
[1:57:32] home but brother sister saying that we
[1:57:35] have the Prophet that tells us that
[1:57:37] everyone must be born hallelujah
[1:57:41] everyone must decide it is his own
[1:57:44] decision not the decision of the father
[1:57:47] or the decision of the mother it is your
[1:57:49] own decision and there is Moses is
[1:57:52] Joshua with a sharp knives hallelujah
[1:57:56] and you have to decide whether if you
[1:57:59] are going to face that sharp knife or
[1:58:01] not or reject that sharp knife because
[1:58:06] it is hurt Allah we are no anesthesia
[1:58:08] that's the same thing we do in in the
[1:58:11] Philippines hallelujah when we were
[1:58:14] about 8 to 12 years old that's the time
[1:58:18] that the time of our circumcision and we
[1:58:21] we go to the certain some of them they
[1:58:23] go to the hospital with anesthesia but
[1:58:26] for us in the province we just go to a
[1:58:31] certain farmer and then we got this
[1:58:33] sharp very sharp knife or Motiti and it
[1:58:37] hurt to cut the flesh but you have to
[1:58:41] face it hallelujah you know the Word of
[1:58:45] God is quick and powerful like - indeed
[1:58:48] short it's hurt you know when the pastor
[1:58:51] begin to you know earlier it hurt to our
[1:58:54] outward man but your outward man must be
[1:58:59] cut hallelujah hallelujah
[1:59:05] so he can live in us Olivia and there is
[1:59:10] mostly a here's just one before you can
[1:59:16] hallelujah
[1:59:17] you cannot possess the land without the
[1:59:21] baptism of the Holy Ghost hallelujah
[1:59:24] so just watch chapter 1 verse 1 to 9 now
[1:59:34] after the death of Moses the servant of
[1:59:36] the Lord it came to pass that the Lord
[1:59:37] speak unto just what the son of nun
[1:59:39] Moses Minister saying Moses my servant
[1:59:42] is dead now therefore arise go over this
[1:59:46] Jordan thou and all these people and to
[1:59:49] the land which I do give to them even to
[1:59:54] the children of Israel now just why

[2:00:01] the one to bring them

[2:00:25] of this Lebanon even unto the great
[2:00:27] river the river you prepare all the land
[2:00:29] of the Hittites and unto the the great
[2:00:32] sea toward the going down of the Sun
[2:00:34] shall be your cost there shall not any
[2:00:39] man be able to stand before thee all the
[2:00:41] days of thy life as I was with Moses so
[2:00:44] I will be with thee I will not fill thee
[2:00:47] nor forsake thee so how is he going to

[2:18:34] shall reign on earth he said that kings
[2:18:38] and priests plural every son and
[2:18:43] daughter of God
[2:18:45] he had made us kings and priests for
[2:18:50] what purpose purpose to offer up
[2:18:53] spiritual sacrifices not only the pastor
[2:18:57] brothers and sisters but we also have
[2:18:59] hallelujah to offer up he had made us to
[2:19:04] be a priest kings and priests for a
[2:19:07] purpose hallelujah
[2:19:09] what is the job of the depressing the
[2:19:12] old assignment is to save for the
[2:19:14] Brethren Alleluia that's why Romans have
[2:19:18] to offer up as a first Peter said
[2:19:21] chapter 2 verse 1 ye also as lively
[2:19:24] stones are built up a spiritual house
[2:19:26] house as an holy priesthood to offer up
[2:19:31] spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
[2:19:33] by Jesus Christ hallelujah you know
[2:19:37] brothers and sisters when we talk about
[2:19:38] sacrifices
[2:19:41] like for example if you fail to come to
[2:19:46] church and you are happy to come that is
[2:19:48] not sacrifice you are need hallelujah
[2:19:52] but when you fail I don't like to go
[2:19:55] this time and that's the time that you
[2:19:58] have to make sacrifice
[2:20:04] and when you feel that I don't like that
[2:20:07] sister now you know he's doing like they
[2:20:11] got a lot of weaknesses and and I don't
[2:20:14] like that brother then that's the time
[2:20:16] that you had to offer up sacrifice to
[2:20:20] bear if you think you are matured enough
[2:20:22] then you are the one who ought to bear
[2:20:25] the infirmities of that brother of that
[2:20:27] sister Alleluia
[2:20:33] last verse that I'm going to share this
[2:20:35] morning I'm going to read Deuteronomy
[2:20:38] chapter 3 18 to 20 and I commanded you
[2:20:44] at that time saying the Lord your God
[2:20:46] had given you this land to possess it ye
[2:20:50] shall pass over armed before your
[2:20:52] brethren the children of Israel all that
[2:20:55] are meat for the war but your wives and
[2:20:59] your little ones and your cattle for I
[2:21:02] know that ye have much cattle shall
[2:21:05] abide in your cities which I have given
[2:21:08] you until the Lord have given rest unto
[2:21:11] your brethren as well as unto you and
[2:21:14] until they also possess the land which
[2:21:17] the Lord your God had given them before
[2:21:19] Jordan and then ye shall and then shall
[2:21:24] ye return every man unto his position
[2:21:27] which I have given you now here's the
[2:21:30] thing brothers resistors when the wealth
[2:21:34] to Canaan land and to possess it they
[2:21:42] did not Israel did not possess it at
[2:21:45] just one time hallelujah we have to
[2:21:49] fight in every inch hallelujah
[2:21:55] like for example after conquering this
[2:21:59] portion here
[2:22:00] Oh Carrie you mean you position this is
[2:22:04] now your because the bible says joshua
[2:22:06] he divided the land according to the
[2:22:09] word of god that he has given to moses

[2:22:14] dividing the land there there there was
[2:22:17] already a pattern early okay whose is it
[2:22:22] Reuben and then we conquered this
[2:22:25] portion here okay hop tribe of Manasses
[2:22:27] it and then though login and fight for

[2:22:41] since their inheritance Alleluia

[2:23:05] already have occupy or possessed your
[2:23:07] inheritance
[2:23:09] but you have to fight hallelujah
[2:23:13] you still have to fight not for your own
[2:23:16] battle but for the battle of your
[2:23:19] brethren until every single seed of
[2:23:24] Abraham can possess their own
[2:23:26] inheritance and after that you can go
[2:23:31] home to your wife and your children and
[2:23:34] enjoy your position hallelujah what is
[2:23:39] our position is our lives in the

[2:24:44] give the time
[2:24:56] [Applause]
[2:25:11] love that amen it's challenging
[2:25:18] it's challenging to our hearts and if
[2:25:20] the Word of God is not challenging and
[2:25:23] it's not the Word of God but it's
[2:25:25] challenging to our hearts amen and to
[2:25:28] see that that strength you know and as
[2:25:31] it was spoken that they which are strong
[2:25:33] must bear the infirmities of the weak
[2:25:35] it's not our strength I think the Lord
[2:25:39] was so clear on pointing that out as
[2:25:43] Paul remember Paul would tell us dude
[2:25:45] they that measure themselves by
[2:25:47] themselves are foolish we measure
[2:25:51] ourselves by the working of the Word of
[2:25:55] God in our lives we measure ourselves by
[2:25:58] him is that right yeah I think that was
[2:26:02] so tremendous how the Lord brought that
[2:26:04] out that the nuggets that laid within
[2:26:07] there you find individuals that were
[2:26:10] matured or seemingly matured in a lot of
[2:26:13] things but one thing that was lacking
[2:26:16] when they went over and when they went
[2:26:18] over to spy out the land it was - and
[2:26:20] they were missing the maturity of the
[2:26:23] life of the promise in their lives and
[2:26:26] there isn't the church itself this
[2:26:29] church and the church throughout the
[2:26:32] world of the Lord Jesus Christ it's not
[2:26:34] our strength is not in our knowledge but
[2:26:38] the strength is the Holy Ghost that's
[2:26:42] our strength you remember when Israel
[2:26:44] elected Saul to be king they elected him
[2:26:47] because he patterned like the other
[2:26:50] nations but remember when God took the
[2:26:54] kingdom from Saul he said the strength
[2:26:56] of Israel will not lie and God took
[2:27:00] David just a little ruddy boy but in
[2:27:05] David's life David might have been only
[2:27:07] this tall but he had a place for God
[2:27:09] that was so big and the strength of
[2:27:13] Israel could step right in David's life
[2:27:15] that's he's our strength
[2:27:18] amen aren't you happy Amen how many say
[2:27:21] Lord let me be strong let me be strong I
[2:27:25] want to be stronger Lord in you
[2:27:28] a man I want to be stronger in you he
[2:27:31] meant because the reality is you're not
[2:27:33] going anywhere without me and I'm not
[2:27:37] going anywhere without you
[2:27:39] amen we are our brother's keeper amen
[2:27:43] let's just stand and amen let's just so
[2:27:47] thankful to the Lord for that we
[2:27:48] certainly appreciate brother lanlan Amen
[2:27:51] just yielding to the Lord and the Lord
[2:27:53] just speaking through our brother amen
[2:27:55] and let's lay this to heart
[2:27:57] let's lay the Word of God to heart don't
[2:27:59] just let it be a service and we just go
[2:28:01] out every but take it to heart and and
[2:28:03] let it be the prayer that resonates in
[2:28:06] our hearts Lord I want to be stronger I
[2:28:09] don't want to be where my prayers when
[2:28:12] I'm praying it's always about me but my
[2:28:18] prayer it turns to where it's not so
[2:28:20] much about me but it's praying for
[2:28:23] others amen it's recognizing those means
[2:28:27] recognizing when someone disagrees with
[2:28:30] us someone when doesn't see eye to eye
[2:28:32] maturity is not maturity isn't that
[2:28:35] there isn't any wrong or there's not any
[2:28:38] mistakes or there won't be anything that
[2:28:41] bothers but maturity is recognizing
[2:28:44] Satan's working it's recognizing that
[2:28:48] amen and recognizing the God who lives
[2:28:51] in us as greater amen let's sing that
[2:28:54] turn your eyes upon Jesus
[2:28:57] Amen or turn your eyes upon Jesus in his
[2:29:13] wonderful face and the face will
[2:29:30] strangely dim in the light of his glory
[2:29:39] and grace keep your eyes on Jesus look
[2:29:57] for
[2:30:00] is wonderful face and the things of will
[2:30:15] strange

[2:30:23] of his glory and ray once again turn
[2:30:30] your eyes or turn
[2:30:34] your eyes upon Jesus look full in his
[2:30:47] wonderful face and the things other
[2:31:00] weirdo strain
[2:31:02] [Music]
[2:31:08] of his glory and rays let go and let God
[2:31:20] have his wonderful way let go and let
[2:31:30] God his way your sorrows will vanish
[2:31:44] your night turn
[2:31:47] today let go and let God have his way
[2:32:01] amen we want to be stronger in the Lord
[2:32:04] amen and I think as it was so clearly
[2:32:08] spoke to our hearts this morning was
[2:32:10] taking heed to all the Word of God
[2:32:12] brother Bram tells us like this he said
[2:32:15] there's an old believer that can be more
[2:32:17] spiritually healthy or strong than his
[2:32:22] knowledge and adherence to the Word of
[2:32:27] God amen so we just don't we need the
[2:32:30] knowledge we need to know what God
[2:32:32] requires of us but then the adherence to
[2:32:35] it and that is be it unto me according
[2:32:36] to thy word as God deals with our hearts
[2:32:41] and we let go see the way many of the
[2:32:43] times in our thinking our strength is
[2:32:46] what we can do but we realize our
[2:32:49] strength is nothing it's not our
[2:32:53] strength that that brings a change it's
[2:32:55] not our strength that'll get us out of
[2:32:56] here
[2:32:57] but it's the strength of the Lord so
[2:32:59] that adherence is Lord be it unto me
[2:33:02] according to your word what God deals
[2:33:04] with our hearts as he speaks to our
[2:33:06] lives in the word as it comes to wash us
[2:33:08] and to cleanse us the man is to give to
[2:33:11] that word say Lord be it unto me we
[2:33:14] don't want to walk out here cuz we know
[2:33:15] we can't walk out of here the same way
[2:33:16] we walked in we walk out of here closer
[2:33:19] when we walk out of here further away I
[2:33:21] want to walk out closer amen I want to
[2:33:25] walk out closer I want to walk out with
[2:33:27] a greater determination in my heart Lord
[2:33:29] I want to do that which is pleasing to
[2:33:31] you
[2:33:32] those things that you've brought right
[2:33:33] down to my pathway this morning I want
[2:33:36] to adhere to it I want to give my life
[2:33:38] to you Lord I want to submit to that
[2:33:42] word amen is that your desire amen let's
