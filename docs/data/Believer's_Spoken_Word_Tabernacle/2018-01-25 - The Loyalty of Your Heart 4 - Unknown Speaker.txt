strength to keep up with her also keep my unsaved loved ones or salvation sister Mary pray for their salvation by children praying for my parade wheels blood sugar was five hundred ninety-eight intervention please keep muckman sister Michelle and probably barber Bobby partner in prayer they're both very sick people for the nearest church they had tonight grateful we can be that that you're so mindful of all our needs gone before we even ask God you've already have the solution God to every problem God Heavenly Father we are just one want to come into your house got to give you praise God to forget about ourselves God forget about though the day or the week God and just give all our attention to you God God cuz you're worthy of all of all of this praise God Heavenly Father we we just want to bring all these requests to your throne God and we want you to grant healing grant deliverance somebody needs God that's what mansion God we just want to place all those such a feat and as I was up other Sam you'll be coming soon god we just want to put just use him to speak to us go we we all have requests in the hearts answers that we're looking for and god you're so mindful and you always give us what we need at the time that we need ago we just want to to consecrate on you to tonight God we place everything in your hands a Nima of the Lord Jesus Christ amen I know I didn't mention but air horn but we'll be praying for him Julie's dad let's think I saw a victory number 532 Oh victory in Jesus my story our saving name on calories it saved a wretch like me [Music] I'm infected blood that I repent Oh [Music] I Saviour [Music] [Music] and all my love in him I heard about this we may delay [Music] [Applause] [Music] like this and then I cry Aaron aiming to be the [Music] [Music] my name forever [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Hey [Music] let's see I heard [Music] [Music] [Music] life [Music] I can do again [Music] [Music] oh sorry [Music] you ain't got to be [Music] [Music] verified in berry [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and [Music] [Music] you believe that why'd you believe that because you're a believer you know why you're a believer cause he ordained you to be a boy and he has brought forth what he has ordained let's just turn in the word of the Lord tonight the Romans chapter 5 verse 1 in the house of the Lord Romans chapter 5 verse 1 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of God and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience and notice at verse 2 there is glory we are rejoicing waiting in expectation in the coming of the Lord but then with an understanding in verse 3 and not only so not just rejoicing and glory in that but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience this word worketh here which we want to deal with a little bit more tonight tribulation worketh patience it's to cause or to work out to perform accomplish or achieve so it's in you but it must be worked out we all have to have that work down when does it reach it's in when we are changed it's there in us and to be worked out of us and patience experience and experience hope and hope maketh not ashamed just like the song we said God can do it again our expectation we're not ashamed there's also experiences that have come in our life as brother Ram tells us that when you go through sickness or whatever it is that you've been through going through those things are given to us that we might also have a testimony it's just like how can you tell somebody he's a savior if you don't know is how do you know him to what degree do you know him to be a savior is that right so it's to know to what what degree and then it's a testimony brother M says it's no longer you saying huh I you know I know him to be a healer but you know by experience music Amen and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God He shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us let's just tonight Heavenly Father Lord Jesus as we take Lord a few moments now Lord from the times and the schedules of this life of this day lord god I pray that you would help us each and every one Lord that in our minds spirit Lord our I pray that God that you would just Lord speak to us Lord in this moment help us the Lord to steal away from all of the cares Lord the tests the trials and Lord may we just Lord be able by your grace Lord - Lord come away Lord for a moment Lord and be refreshed Lord and be strengthened and be directed Lord God Father in you Lord Lord Jesus we believe that Lord and know that you know where each of us are at 1 you know what each of us have need of you know what we're facing or what we will face the Lord and father you prepare us Lord you give us strength lord grace Lord to be able to move through all of these things and cares of life Lord you give us the Grace and strength that we need Lord we just commit ourselves to you ask that you would just have your way tonight and speak to arts in a very personal way in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen may God bless you bless His Word and bless you as you're being seated I want to look here tonight and going back into this quote we've been looking at out of three kinds of believers and when you you look at it that everything that within our lives that once an individual has been born of the Spirit of God we we no longer as us going by our own nature it's not us trying to perform the Word of God by our own nature but it is God Himself that is performing his word in our life and admit has to be him it has to be him to do it as a matter of fact even of the greatest amount of what we would deem to be humility yet God himself through the Prophet tells us in desperation he said that even taking off our shoes would not satisfy what God is calling for he said the only thing that will satisfy is a life that would bring forth the fruit of the Spirit and the fruit of the Spirit is that of the life that would be working through the actual branches that are designed to give a true witness and a true reflection of the life that is within the violin as we looked at it last week that the trial itself is also a time of purging where many that would have you know the orchards in different places around us there is a time of purging or cleansing pruning back that the tree itself might continue to receive the light it needs in the middle as well as to continue to bear more fruit and God Himself he he knows exactly what what he's doing within our life there's there's not one of us that when we were born again that we came out fully mature but we have received the maturity of the promise of the life that has been ministered to us in this day and we come to maturity under that word and in that word that we have been ministered to and birthed by so when Paul would talk about the gospel of our salvation we know that God is very precise in that there is a word his word that is allotted for each day in each time and when that word itself the people of God um whom that word is ordained to be reflected through in their life that word by the Spirit of God will seek out the children of God and then by by the Spirit of God we are birthed into the body of Jesus Christ which is the Word of God which is Christ himself and so living out that word when we are coming into that it requires us and coming into a continual yielding just like we heard ministered here on Sunday you you never stopped yielding you don't yield and say well I come to the altar and then I yield it and my life has been cleansed up and I've yielded and and I've received the Holy Ghost but that right there equips you the Holy Spirit equips you to go into deeper realms of yielding than you've ever could go within your own natural ability so it takes it takes the Spirit of God to move within our lives for us to be able to come into those places and be able to bring our lives in subjection and submit ourselves unto his word and to his care and so when we're looking at this and I think of that word patience of how that tribulation worketh or works out patience itself and the very word patience is that of the steadfastness or the constancy the endurance in the new testament it's the characteristic of a man who has not swerve from his deliberate purpose and his loyalty to faith and piety by even the greatest trials and sufferings patiently in steadfastly waiting for a patient enduring sustaining and perseverance now this loyalty of faith it doesn't mean that you and I may not come to what we would think I'm at my breaking point but as far as our humanity our humanity would reach a breaking point and it does reach the breaking point as a matter of fact the test in the trial exposes our humanity and the test and trial exposes that you and I are not in glorified bodies we are in earthen vessels vessels that are still fragile and it exposes the weakness of our life there is not one of us in here that likes to faint or look about our weaknesses but yet it's our weaknesses that we come to have made known there's no weakness in your soul if you're born again there's no weakness in my soul if I've been born again but where the weakness would lie what is God trying to do is God trying to perfect my flesh no he's trying to perfect the character of my life and the only way he can protect and perfect that character is by the indwelling of his own character his own life he molds and he shapes our life I'm sure that if we could have had our way we would have rather have had character somehow wrapped up and given to us as a gift because if it was given as a gift there'd be no dying there would be nothing that we would have to do it would be simply handed to us and when we would stand there on that day we would be able to tell the Lord I would praise you but I have nothing to declare that I have overcome because when you gave me the Holy Ghost everything right there I was already overcoming perfect but that's not the truth of the matter the truth of the matter is when we are born of the Spirit of God we have overcome the world we don't have to go through a list of things but we have within us the life that has overcome the world this present state and cosmos this system this administration that's upon the world of which you and I came into this earth under but the grace of God that life has moved upon us to raise us up into that other realm and into a place to where God can begin to deal and mold and shape and bring out what is placed in our life that what you want I want that I want that continual development so when we're looking at it you look at how brother Branham makes a statement here in three kinds of believers and he says sometimes believers put to the test and not sometimes but every time for every Sun that cometh to God must be chastened tried and child trained and remember the trials the dusty roads the hot Sun of persecution but though he says remember the trials the dusty roads the hot Sun of persecution but the loyalty of your heart beats that material what material your character so the loyalty of my heart the loyalty of your heart is actually beating out the character into the mold or the shape that God Himself is desiring but it's not my it's not me it's not you but it's the loyalty of the heart what loyalty are we talking about because loyalty itself can be across all sorts of things but the ban tells us himself Cain was a loyal believer seeing very very very powerful statements he said Cain himself who was humble humble how was Cain humble what level could came come to Cain could only come to a certain level of humility but Cain could not humble himself to the life of the word of what the word was calling for in that hour you know there's a greater humility for you and I it's not something that we've attained to and these things that we're looking at and we set back and say okay seatbelts buckled I'm rapture ready I'm ready to go I'm waiting on everybody else that's not the work of the Spirit of God in our life when they were born by the Spirit of God even during the time of Luther when their birth they were not automatically born fully mature but they had to come into the full image and stature of the word that was spoken within that hour how did they do it by continually yielding to the working of the Spirit of God that had come through the word in that hour and the Spirit of God you say well why didn't the Spirit of God just do it why don't he just give why don't it just be the Spirit of God why does it have to be the word because the people of God the elect are moved by the Word of God and the Spirit directs the people to the word so that the people have an expectation of what is to be fulfilled within that hour so Gramps I'm so thankful for that so the loyalty of heart it's more than just being loyal to to something it's having a loyalty to Christ himself not just loyalty to a church we understand that you can be loyal to a church you can be loyal to principles you can be loyal to standards that's not the loyalty that we're talking about here the loyalty we're talking about is that of an invincible union where Christ himself has come and made the heart of the individual his very own throne and it is a union whereby Paul would talk in reverent Romans a it is the love of Christ that is dwelling on the inside and that's where Paul could say who who can separate us from the love of Christ not what who can separate us so when we're looking at it if this is the power of the indwelling of his Union in this union in our lives we love him because he first loved us right so the loyalty of your heart beats the materials so when the test or trial comes our way the loyalty of the material under loyalty of the heart underneath the tester trial actually is beating out the material that is there until he says she's ready to go in the mold what is it that you and I are gonna take with us a character our character and yet now the Lord Jesus would speak even at the end of this age come and buy of me gold that's tried in the fire and yet he won't accept none of your money it don't matter how rich somebody is he don't heal up that kinda it's not how you buy this the only way you buy it is through submission the only way this kind of gold is bought is through humility so notice he says God's children is made up correctly on his word for they are living examples and the Word of God living through them the trial he said it comes to shake you to put you to the very bottom to see where you'll stand they tested tried every son that cometh to God and Joe went through the trials and tests and his children taken everything else taken the church members come accused him of being a secret sinner and tried to say everything against him but yet he wouldn't listen to any of it he knowed he had met God's requirements he know there's no need of Satan trying to tempt him he knowed it was the devil and as long as Satan can make him believe that his sickness was his God doing it he had job quit you know there's certain things that you can know that it's God doing it I mean Satan coming at you you can know that the sickness that you got coming you can know and say this sickness or maybe somebody at work is rubbing you the wrong way or somebody in church or whatever more and you can know hey wait a minute that's not my brother my sister that's not my boss that's not my husband that's not my wife that is the enemy that's one thing to know about it but it's also Nene it's also needful for us to know that Lord God I need you to also make sure that my life is in the right condition in conduct during this time that's where we need help but that's the very purpose of the trial to do reduce us from our strengths glory be to God anybody like to be told their weaknesses if you do I'll tell you to come on up here and we'll pray the line devil off of it because that's not true nobody likes to hear weaknesses nobody likes to have what you know how they always when I was going through the teaching thing constructive criticism I think some people man they just they need to have an office constructive criticizing is that right I mean they could be the CEO of the company that might be a good project man we can make apps and everything else and everything else constructive criticizers not what kind of school could we have well we definitely have one that God don't want to be in but when job one struck that revelation penny was not God he was only going through his trials to make him something it wasn't God doing it it was Satan doing it and the same thing today you'll try to tell you these trials and thing is your God trying to put punishment upon you it isn't so no sir it's Satan doing it and God permitting it to temper you to make you see if you are tied to this earth by the earth tears or whether your treasure is in heaven for where your treasure is there you are also that's right your heart is where your treasures are so as he said this very this very tempering us is to temper us it's this trial is to temper us and to make us see if we're tied to this earth by earth cares there's a lot more earth cares than just than just finances I want you to understand there's a lot more to earth cares than that earth cares goes so deep to understand that we're talking about even the vessel you're dwelling in we're talking about things we're talking about feelings we're talking about all of those things come along with earth cares you know it are even our treasures our treasures that let me just go on let me just move on it'll get there in the in the word temper itself I don't want to lose time here on the word temper notice I begin to look at this some weeks ago and looking at this temper and I know I've got people here that understand this a whole lot more than me so then maybe they can hold an a class after I'm done here tonight but they get over the part of it with tempering to temper something because brother Graham's elders these are only given to temper us and to temper something is to improve the hardness and elasticity of steel or other metal by reheating and then cooling it think you mean you can't do it any other way no it's got to be read it and who going into a trial coming out of a trial going into a trial coming out of a trial the good news is is that if you're heading out of a try if you are in the trial now you're getting ready to exit I don't know how long but you're on your way out and the good thing about it is if you're out of a trial you're getting ready to head into one kind of like it says you meet yourself coming and going so it's 2:10 for you now notice it's to improve the consistency or resiliency of a substance by heating it or adding particular substances to it so the steel or or whatever it is them that the different iron alloys or certain things they within themselves though they have the qualities that are within them that's needed to actually be able to serve or to perform certain duties or to be used as an instrument or something in that measure yet depending on what the purpose is that the person has in mind when they purchase the steel or the iron alloy or what have you there the purpose that it's going to be used for will determine the process that it goes through it will determine even how that they will calculate the heat and how they will pool it and what did they do it slowly or whether they do it rapidly it will all determine the purpose I don't think there's a piece of steel or pieces of iron that could talk do you I don't think there's a piece of steel so why in the world are they doing this to me answers why in the world am I going through this it's not up to him it's not up to the steel look I don't see the steel or the iron it's no more than just an instrument whereby that someone would have a desire or a purpose to actually come by and take that piece of iron or steel and shape it here's the common objectives of heat treatment to increase strength increase hardness improve toughness I'll pick up some of these in a moment improve machining which that machining is to be able to take raw material and cut it into a desired shape and size so it objective one of the objective is to be able by machining is to take the steel and there's an image there's a precise pattern and be able to stamp that right on so that's the desire for machining also for for mobility which is the capacity to be shaped to improve ductility or increased ductility to improve elasticity or the ability to change I may believe that God wants us to change that's the desire that's what the Spirit of God comes back in the service as he's moving on our lives and then it don't stop in the service it continues to go with us is that right we don't leave him on the doorstep a command Lord Jesus one mold shape continue to work in my life this isn't a name that claimant it's done when God brings his word across our life it requires us dying to ourselves if you recall even one of the things that the Spirit of the Lord had spoke to brother John here on Sunday when brother John was sinned when he was dealing with how that certain things would come about in our life certain things that we don't even ask for that come to our doorstep and those things mites might show up and one of the things that he mentioned he said pray unpeeled until that's exactly what the Prophet tells us in the revelation series and throughout he talks about of bitterness comes or these other things What did he say do get a cropping hole and grub it out wow that means it's going to take work even if I agreed with that word and there's things that that might be building up and then I sense it maybe Monday morning what do I do stay right in prayer why am i staying right in prayer because what God has said is where he is faithful to perform that word and that's why I'll stand on it that's my promise but I can be free glory be to God tempering tempering is used to increase the toughness of iron alloys particularly still on tempered steel is very hard but it's too brittle for most applications wow it's it's so hard but if it's untempered it's brittle and I don't mean we're going to break it like a frosted flake or something but it's brittle it cannot be it's not usable when I think of how that God works and moves and deals with our lives sometimes we wonder why there's some wide that and why that but yet God has a purpose within it all he knows the machinability he needs out of our life he knows the ductility he knows the elasticity he knows before mobility he knows the hardness that he needs out of our life he knows that Oh Lord I hope you don't leave me in this fire too long no he knows how long he he knows what he's trying to achieve in that time so I'm tempered steel is very hard but it's too brittle for most applications tempering is commonly done after hardening to reduce excess hardness now tempering is used to alter let me look at this definition of altar altar itself means to change or calls to change in character or composition typically in a comparatively small but significant way you know when you look at it I've been watching some different things upon this as I've been studying on for some time and you look at how that they'll even take certain things were they in a machining have taken the steel they've got everything to where they had had brought it to a certain place and then they stamp out an image of a of a knife and I was watching ones just on knives just that's one of those that I was looking at and you find that how that after they have taken it through a process of heating and cooling and heating and cooling and they're doing all of this because there are molecules in the way that the structure of things is within that particular steel that's there they want those to be aligned in a certain way there's a purpose that they have so they'll actually take them through even the temperatures that they allow they'll take them from a time where it is so hot and then all of a sudden they'll cool it down and then they'll put it in a deep freeze hey listen some of you and I have went from the fire we've cooled down and all of a sudden it feels like we've been in a deep freeze you feel like your prayers are not being answered you seemed like you hadn't felt God in a long time don't you're coming out of there his purpose was just to do what cool and get you ready for the purpose that he's serving in your life Laura he knows he's over at all will repeat oh god oh man I noticed this with hardness hardness and I'll just want to take these individually hardness itself is the quality or condition of being hard now we understand you know I think it's in the Word of God where Paul would tell Timothy endure hardness is that right he didn't say become hard he said endure it we can easily become hard but I'm so thankful that the Spirit of God can move over in renewal and remake us aren't you we could become hard and callous not even knowing it but yet the Spirit of God can come right by and tenderize us again aren't you glad for that but you see this hardness is not about so that we would become hard but it's to where that this hardness there is a certain level that they would need to take it to in order to resist mechanical indentations or abrasions that would be on the steel or there's iron alloy what it is that they're trying to get out of it the purpose will determine the hardness that it needs to be at so you understand when you look at somebody else and I may not have went through the exact trial that you went through and you haven't went through the trials the exact trial that I have went through that means nothing God has a purpose of what he's doing Paul told the church of the living god in Corinthians and Thessalonians on and on and on of how that the working of the Spirit of God the trying and all of those things come he said at the Apostles here and he's talking about how that God working in their life God worked in their life for a certain measure there are things of how God was working out in their life that was pertaining to them same way he works in you same way he works in me one thing about it the purpose that he's called us to it will come forth that's one thing for sure that Oh glory now in ductility when we're all gonna be pretty smart after this huh don't apply for you to agree though ductility to make pliable able to be drawn out like that of a wire so there's purposes there's need still for their iron alloys there's purposes and need for wire and those things I think of what it is it is it on the interstates right now whether they have replaced a lot of those in the medians right there and it was a young young man I think of the young man I don't know about 18 20 20 years old that designed all that where you have those the the steel or iron I don't know exactly what it is but you know how it has that little when you're driving down the road it looks like they're kind of sinking down to the grass and they have a little bit so that if there's an accident you know kind of catch and and so forth and it all of those things that had to be stretched all of those things had to have a certain ductility to it but yet that same thing has to have a certain toughness to it it can't you know it would be like just like a bungee cord right would where you go over any other Lane and then fly back see it can't do that well what determines how they've made it for the purpose its intended so this making Platteville in other words it can be shaped a toughness something that is strong enough to be able to withstand adverse conditions or rough or careless handling this ain't even about any about others handling us carelessly it's about us wearing sometimes that we've handled carelessly in our own lives of things but yet there's a toughness that though we may have handled things carelessly there's a toughness to be able to stand there who did this god it's better to say who's doing it God Christ in you and me the hope of glory strength the quality or state of being strong how maybe you'd like to write over a bridge where something's weak I said I'll tell you what I used to hate them wooden bridges in West Virginia we go we would go up the holler to visit everybody my uncle's they were driving them bridges British on them bridges they I know them bridges were they they were they were about you know from here to there then things looked about this wide though when we were riding in the car I could look out the door and I know I could see the creek you know what I didn't see anyone bridge you know they didn't have rails on them so you're going you went up the holler and you had to cross the creek everybody lived on a little place from the hill and across the creek right there I never liked those things at all but I know there was a certain certain level of support it's just the same way on bridges when they have built different bridges when I've studied on that here over the past days and things like that there are certain things that they have tested within those bridges and they have constructed them in a certain way the metal and everything else that they put in it and even what they are doing and the metal that is put in it is already determined for the purpose that it's going to serve I'm telling you right now that within your life the Holy Spirit in your life it is built within you to be able to stand as an anchor and I'm telling you within you you have within you the power to overcome you have within you the ability to surrender yourself and for Christ to shape and mold your life sure you don't see yourself the way you want to see yourself but remember God Himself is not working just looking at you he's working on your life by the vision that he already has so love you he doesn't see you necessarily as a work in progress although he is but he sees you and I as a finished product and that's why he can bring his word to you and I was such a strength and can bring his word with such a share it's why because his word cannot return back to him it cannot it will accomplish they many might have to women did the work and work and work and then test after test after test and trial after trial but it will bring forth what he has ordained and it will all be to his glory because you and I can say we can't say I yielded we say Lord thank you for helping me use you know what I needed glory tempering involves heating the metal to a precise temperature below the critical point and is often done in air vacuum or inert atmospheres that's all of these atmospheres where they just can't move this can't move I mean you know you've got a role before you the Red Sea at their back you just can't move you don't have no farting there's no other door there's not like a hey lean on that wall there will be an opening right there no those times when each and every one of us you face things on your job or you face things in other ways that you sit there and you look and you knew in five hours six hours I'm gonna have to get up and I'm gonna have to go and face it you are trusting the Lord but it still didn't mean that you enjoyed it or you liked it or you look forward to it but yet it was a time you're saying lord I need your strength again today Lord what help me in this situation I don't know how to approach this person Lord I don't know what to do in this situation Lord I need your strength help me Lord and he's hands-on he don't let you jump in the fire he puts you in it this tempering is not remotely like mechanical process and there's all of a sudden everything comes about and grabs joy up true and here joy let me go it picks him up and then it puts him down enough in the fire no no he's hands-on he's still old-school it's old-time religion it's old-school he still works on our act the same way he worked on the each and every one down through the ages he doesn't do it by mechanical Affairs he himself is present oh ma the temperature is adjusted depending on the amount of hardness that needs to be reduced so the temperature it's not everybody the same temperature the temperature depends on the amount of hardness what's hardness remember we're getting into a place to where that it's resilient not brittle that it's got to come for whatever the purpose is and how that God has such precision he knows how the Bible says what we're able to bear is that right he knows exactly where to bring you and I into that place to where that this hardness or this where we're actually able to take an impression and his life is continuing to move and in our lives being impressed as his life is moving through us and yet he also knows how to where our lives are not able to be abraded or abrasions of st. in that powerful God knows that he knows this hardness of what is needed in our lives he knows just how to heat it remember your tests and your trial was personally tailored just like mine is for me personally Taylor Taylor I can't give you my trial I can't give you my test I'll tell you this right here friends whether you believe it or not that over the years even even within pastoring if I could I would lift people's tests and trials and take them all on myself I don't say that for a hero it's just I don't like to see it I don't like to see in people when they're suffering and they're going through things but yet I realize if I were to sweep in and try to do if I could I would so mess up the program I would mess it up so so bad why because it's my human thinking of and my human compassion of it oh how we need our human compassion to be under the compassion of God oh my because remember human compassion with a hole healed everybody at the Pool of Bethesda but godly compassion excuse me pardon me excuse me pardon me pardon me why here was one person that's godly compassion notice he says it goes on while it varies depending on the metal type generally low temperatures will reduce brittleness while maintaining most of the hardness while higher temperatures reduce hardness which increases elasticity and plasticity but causes some yield and tensile strength to be lost so in other words what it comes down to is how to remove brittleness and yet make it so that it's easily able to be shaped but yet if it's deformed it won't stay in the deform state that's plasticity to be able to withstand deformity hook or repeat of God hallelujah now to think of how that even in our lives that things can come our way feelings can come our way other things can happen and even in the midst the tester trial that even our conduct is not superior I'll say Amen for all of you because within it then what is it even in the midst of it may be our attitude or our thinking or whatever is all out of sorts and out of life but yet God by His grace has so moved upon our life to prepare us even for that moment to where that even there is no deformity nothing can be retained he will bring us out of that glory be to God it is essential mine to heat the metal gradually I don't know about you but sometimes I've had tester trials and things are right on the dot they're coming right out at 2,000 degrees you have to then you've had others at me just who's trying to get hot it's gradual what is it it's about his purpose he knows what we need now I know in our flesh in our flesh we want to run from it a meshach Shadrach and Abednego we're not up there jump around say hey I'll go in the fiery furnace no but God was gonna make himself known in a greater way they didn't know that they were going to be delivered out of that fiery furnace but they did know we're gonna be delivered out of your hand one way or another they were standing on God's Word that furnace that they went into was not gradually heated when they went into it it was already heated seven times hotter whoa but in the hottest time that's when he made himself known to them like no other pareidolia oh my these are our promises this these are not print these are not battle stories they mend these are Testaments of Christ working in the lives of believers that you and I might receive comfort and patience from these scriptures they walked in their home i no doubt they had heard they heard God they prayed they talked to God they had a personal relationship with God but in there they walked in bound but in their the bands that was upon their life was loosed on their feet and on their hands they weren't able to do the things that they wanted to do they were not able to walk the way that they desired and wanted to walk but in that fiery furnace it moved away those bands now you explain this to me how did it burn the bands off of them didn't singe their clothes you tell me that the trials of God are not precise they are precise he knows exactly what he's doing when you can look at it over the times where I've been studying looking at this you can take how the arrangement would be in that metal but after it comes through the process of what it's designed to be and they're able to take a picture there and break it down of the structure of that material all of that was laying in it you understand what I'm saying the trial didn't put it in there the trial brought the arrangement of what was already there the trials not putting more in you the trial is bringing out of you what's already there Oh glory it's essential to heat the metal gradually to avoid the steel being cracked the metal has been held at this temperature for a fixed period how long well sometimes the trials are a day sometimes the trials are a week sometimes the trials are a month sometimes the trial is much longer sometimes there's been trials that we've go through that it isn't something that abruptly starts and abruptly stops sometimes there's things that continues its like residue lingers it keeps on lingering but yet God is faithful and bringing you through it it's a fixed period fixed period I've often said this many many times here in preaching a message even years and years ago of how that you take Paul and Paul could look at the Ministry of the Lord Jesus Paul himself was not there apart as far as walking with Him in his earthly ministry but Paul was privileged by divine revelation to understand the anchor that was within that life of what stood the test and all of the temptu trials and everything that he went through because Paul could ride it that he suffered he was tempted in all points such as we are yet without sin Paul could write of this of this of this greatness of this sacrifice our a blessed Redeemer becoming one of us and facing literally facing the very things that you and I would face yet without sin but then you take Peter and Peter who was right there Peter could right there in the book of Peter and he would write about but this beard being pulled from his face Peter would write about you know the treatment that he received Peter saw that but yet within both of it for both of them what was the the reality with is that the anchor itself held the life held the life it stayed steadfast in the midst of it so waiting until the residue of the trial is over to schedule to give a testimony oh you're forfeiting times of victory victory is not when we come out of the trial we have victory during the trial are you with me that's God's desire that's God's desire he supplies to us he has given to us of his victory we are his victory both say no I don't know about that what is that doing that's testifying of the light and faithfulness of God who dwells within you I don't know how he's gonna do it but he's bringing me through he's wonderful he's wonderful I don't know how he's gonna bring this all out work all this out but I know he's gonna do it as a matter of fact not gonna let me declare it right so he's able to stand as a high priest for what I'm confession because he's not the high priest of Ghana he's the high priest he is glory a fixed period in that amazing sometimes that people can look at other people I'm just filming that's not I want to talk about anybody else out there they're in animation you can look at this person in that person you could look at things and this person talks about their job and this person talks about their job and it amazing how you could look at something and there could be a tendency within the human Humanity part of it to think well I could do that I mean I mean you work in an office go hide in the cubicle you understand what I'm saying there's things that sometimes we look at things like that's just simple you just do this you see what the problem is you're too ascended you need to convince it you see this isn't like the precedent who walks into steel mill with his great suit from China and he walks in and hats on his hat and boy he's waiting to see how the steel workers are doing that guy in planning to get dirty he knows when he leaves there he's got steak and lobster and everything else waiting on him he know that he does not have to worry and contend about the heat and worried about do i duck when the steel beams flying over he don't have to worry about that so it's easy to make policy about things you don't know no this isn't a political convention this is a convention of the delegates of heaven it's easy you know like they say boots on the ground if boots have been on the ground and you've done what you're doing then they'll know certain policies don't work those of you that know that work even in the nursing home and things like that you know they want you to be able to do everything you know hey you guys can take care of one person the whole wing at ain't nothing to it just you know just spit the pills down to them catch the peel down there you see the types of things that take place there's no look at it it's that without any feeling within it oh god that's even another part of tests and trials that sometimes we get too big for our own britches and God has to reduce us down to a place to say wait a minute go poke your hole in a bucket of water and see if the whole stage there and just find out how big you are it's easy to look at somebody else's life and somebody else what they're going through and say that's easy buddy suck it up it's easy to do that but that is not the way of our Lord I'm talking about character I'm talking about condescension when those types of things happen you're proving a hardness that's brittle it's very damaging to the body let's let's let's look at the word here just a moment while we're on this when one member suffers we all suffer when one member rejoices we all rejoice unless you're not part of the body that comes with being part of the body when somebody comes over and steps on my foot guess who says I'll not my big toe my mouth says out how does my mouth say out because I have nerve endings in the bottom right there in my time it travels up to my brain notice all these systems working together it travels up to my brain and my brain sends out a response comes right out why I'm part of this my mouth brain the nervous system all of that is part however if I have my foot and my foots out here you could jump up and down on it all day if I had just had a prosthesis you could jump up and down on my foot all day you know why I'm just artificially connected come on somebody you see this is part God allows tests and trials why we are not to be artificially connected as believers we need one another as well preach whether we're on it a rough guideline nun noticed this a fixed period of time a rough guideline is one hour per inch of thickness who well it just depends on what he's trying to get done sometimes our thickness we're thick in certain places God says this needs to be a little thick in that area I want you to think of this I've heard the Prophet here today just saying with Joseph well Joseph being down in Egypt and as he was mentioning these things and the message three kinds of believers and I thought back even to the message Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ brother Graham talks about how that he said Joseph here he was a believer he believed in the vision of what God had given him to wear that the sheaves were going to bow down before him he knew God had given him that vision but yet now once you look at this now even though that Joseph he was ordained for that and that purpose was in his life that was to be served but yet he still had to go through everything in Egypt and the Prophet says it like this in prisoner of Jesus Christ what it was he said it was a little bit too much pride that was there see God picks up not great conglomerations he's able to look into the structure and say ooh that molecule and those things aren't aligning just right that that's not gonna serve that's not what I wanted for so what do we need we need a little bit more eat right now and then we'll let him cook what should we do should we put him right in the bucket right away no they need to just air cool on this one this isn't a gradual start and stop trial this is gradual you see there's other times where they'll stick this this steel this iron though they'll put it and what they'll do when they heat it to a critical point there's certain things that they're looking for and what they'll do is they'll touch it on a magnet because they want it they don't want to cool it so quickly that it loses the properties of magnetism everything is so precisely and God knows exactly what he's doing the thing that I thought that I can just say for me is Lord it's right here you know what you're doing and what it is that you desire to bring out of my life my burden yes it's for the whole body pray for the whole body but I cannot perform in you neither can you performed in me what is already there God must bring it out let me just finish this and we'll close a rough guideline is one hour per inch of thickness during this time the internal stresses in the middle are relieved and that's remember during one time this time of heating so the time of heating the internal stresses are relieved I think I'm starting to understand though the outward man perish the inward man is renewed I think I'm starting to see the metal is then cooled in still air you're loving let me read you just a couple scriptures notice how Peter places it I mean I may just kind of skip over just a little bit in verse 6 of first Peter 1 speaking of wearing you greatly rejoice we've kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation and verse 5 ready to be reviewed on the last time worrying you greatly rejoice where is our rejoicing that we are part of his coming there's a lot of everything else that looks bleak dismal and dark but the light as a rose our rejoicing is is that we know our salvation is nearer our deliverance isn't here though now for a season if need be who determines if we need be you know so it's it's not having a sign-up sheet for trials because none of us would do that nobody would do that voluntarily willingly go in the fire no because we don't even know we don't even see these needs in our life it's not us telling God God you know what I need more of this so put me over there who God says it's hardness just thing you're right this is telling me who art thou clay to tell the Potter who have formed thee how to form yeah well or do you know exactly no no it's just the measure the fixed period of time just even the temperature and we are placed there if need be you are in what's that word heaviness sorrowful now wait a minute I mean the me understand this I'm to conduct myself with joy admits my trials count it all joy right rejoice greatly but yet I'm pleased and you replaced if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold sorrows oh but I think there's something that we have to understand this is not sorrow in without hope this is not solving with I don't know what's going on I don't know it's sorrowing but out of this sorrow is gonna come forth growth we have a direction to know that's why that's why there's no contradiction in the word we glory in tribulations and yet here it says you're in heaviness greatly sad and sorrowful through variegated various testings and trying's well what variegation will have what form what color it depends on what he sees needs be verse 7 that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth the trial the trial is what it's more precious than gold it's more sweeter than gold what kind of gold the gold that perishes because the trial itself does not produce perishing Gold in our lives it brings forth the gold of his christ-like character so the trial is more precious than gold who would trade gold for a trial we don't see that to be any we could look at that I don't see that to be equal at all but God's letting us know that our trial it's more precious because look gold itself can buy a lot of things gold itself can get you access to a lot of things is that right but yet it comes to an end it has a limitation but the trial is forming in us bringing forth that gold Christ's like character from our lives that is to be raptured he's doing it he's not giving it to us he's molding us though it'd be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ this scripture very clearly declares how long the tests how long the trials how long must we go through how long must there be sufferings and times and things we come into how long until until until the finally it's ready to go into the mold what mold well we know the material is that christ-like character but what mold the body that he has prepared for us it must be shaped just listen to me just as the pyramid City is a pyramid you and I in our lives the ages are a pyramid the bride right the entirety of a bride and you and I as individuals are to be pyramids reflections are there going into that city it's not handed to us but as the Prophet tells us he said you must first be born again and when you are born again then all of those virtues come forth coming from our life otherwise we know it's peacock it's black bird trying to add peacock feathers so what must it be the divine nature on the inside and he brings us to what a crowning moment the achievement you know I just heard brother Brennan say today you know you hear about brother brand when your brother brand speaks to us in the church age book and he talks about how that the Lord Jesus Christ was his crowning achievement he talks about that in Christ the mystery of God revealed and then as I heard the Prophet say today I just just astounded me when he makes the statement and three kinds of believer he said God's greatest achievement is for a person to believe the greatest achievement why God does what he does is that we might believe you see there's things that God asked of you and I to be to trust him even earlier and there's things that he asked us even now to believe and to trust him and to know that I don't have to say Lord take me out of the heat right now Lord no he knows what we can say is Lord would you just give me grace right now maybe send down the Angels to fan a little bit because this test or this trial is quite a bit and he knows he knows when the tester trial is over there's angels Elijah there's angels to minister to you angels came and ministered to Elijah when he came out of that is that right what did they tell him rise when the Lord Jesus came down from the temptation there in Matthew 4 what did the Bible say angels ministered unto them at the end before going to Calvary before Pilate saw at the end angels came and ministered to you might be here tonight you you might be at that point where angels themselves maybe they are ministering to you you know sometimes you there's things that we go through with tests and trials and there's different things that we might feel like we've lost a little something but when we've gone through a test or trial God has brought us through it isn't of the Lord that we've lost we might have lost the thing that we've lost is more of what we needed to lose more of ourselves now the truth of the matter is we all speak up don't we Lord I want more of you I want more of you but it'd be like this room right here if this room was filled up with boxes all the way to the ceiling and you say I want more I want more he says well where am I gonna put but you see within our lives it's worth God by His grace the character being molded and formed what's it doing it's spreading out it's spreading out where one time your patient starts like this and he grows your temperance starts like this and then it grows all of those virtues are in you not nature given there can be people there naturally given the bent l's he said that's the problem with the tabernacle now there's two different kinds of faith but that water the Holy Ghost must make its way down to the foundation what did he cloth call that the new birth being born again and then from there the life you begin to grow begin to grow so Lord what must I do just keep surrendering to him he brings out every one of those virtues in our life and it's not where we're going by checklist check of manifested patience check temperance check virtue know it's ongoing it's called maturing tribulation worketh work works out brings forth patience I didn't get to it tonight but brother Ram tells us clearly he says a matter of fact he said there's no other way for you to have patience then by your faith being tried I thought patience was already in me it is the trial doesn't add anything to you the trial brings forth what's already there but it takes the trial to bring it forth say Lord just help me to stand still help me just to stand still Lord to be molded to trust you see the part of the trial is to trust him he knows what he's doing he knows the degree of the temperature he knows just the cooling process he know you know I'm glad aren't you and if he knows this is where our our trust must come our trust sale or my life it's not just a song I think of it our paths have crossed look at our paths across but who's to say that your path may not always be here mr. Smith who's to say that our paths were not always I'm not talking about leaving the Lord you understand god knows what he's doing in our lives he knows how he's preparing us in shaping us sometimes God will mold and make look if God took that long to mold and make John for six months of service six months of service who was the one putting in all the work God the Lord put in all the work for just a moment's worth of service think about the woman who cleaned out that barn nobody knows her name nobody knows her name but she felt on her heart to go clear out that barn and have a meeting there you say well brother Samuel cleaning ain't much I've tried it I might be a clean fanatic and a clean nut but you know what I get tired when you come to wiping down the baseboards and everything else and cleaning all that stuff your back hurts and everything else hurts no wonder you want to go out to eat afterwards sorry for setting you up brothers but you know cleanin ain't easy I mean to think about it you know I remember when I was in the college dorm you we every Friday man I told my roommate that I had I was in Friday mornings when I get back from morning class it's clean time I don't want dust bunnies all over this floor I don't want to moving all around I want this place cleaned up we're gonna clean it I'm helping you but you know how it is when you have that hard floor like that you know those floors that they have like at school cafeterias it's so hard to clean them things and keep them clean it just looks like they manufacture dust bunnies and all these other things and to think about how this woman came in there and she cleaned that place she took that a burden upon her heart from the Lord you know what she cleaned that place as if the Lord Himself was coming and he did come he did come to think of it how God prepared her you said brother Samuel what does that have to do with the tester trial for her to be yielded and sensitive enough for God to speak to her on something that she would not overlook and say what could that be God prepares he knows what he's doing sound up to me to figure that out it's just up to me to submit to it he knows what he's doing I should go ahead I'm so glad Lord you have it in control but what I'm more grateful for what what causes me to rejoice is to have that trust nor Jesus we never know we never know Lord test or trial or water rises we never know we never know Lord they angle that it's going to come we never know that Lord Jesus our confidence Lord using you as Paul could say to trust in ourselves was the sentence of death we are not trusting in ourselves not in our flesh but we are trusting in you that's our comfort Lord is in you I think of how the Prophet would speak of it in the message the comforter he said job was a man at all that he you had spoke to him about a burnt offering of offering up the burnt offering he said that's all that job had not making light of it but that's what was made known to him and Joe stood on what you had made known was the accepted way so in all of the test all was coming he knew where he was standing with you but it was through the tests to trial where job needed direction we've seen that Lord mentioned that Lord many times I'm so thankful that Lord God that you've never chose to hide the humanity of man Lord that's never bothered me as a matter of fact I can relate to it I'm so I'm so thankful that you didn't hide these things in the scriptures Lord and cover over the humanity I'm glad even in our day that you did not have the humanity of our prophet you allowed it things Lord to even be caught and recorded on tape even things that he would express of his own life of things that he himself was dealing with you allowed that and we can see those things Lord we can watch the Lord how alive our son of God with Lord move and coming into that maturity Lord how we thank you so much it gives us great hope Lloyd because we know that you are the same God and this word Lord God we are under yes maturing us Lord it's sheathing us it's molding us Lord perhaps right now there's things that you can are working Lord in each of our lives I believe that with all my heart Lord then Lord how our character Lord being molded Lord through trials we come and how we rejoice Lord in the ministering of the word and Lord as we feed upon your word but we realize Lord that the word itself is that we might have a direction and we have a faith within that word that you will lead and guide us all the way through the Scriptures tell us Lord Paul would be quick to tell the Corinthians and the Romans and different ones he would be quick to tell them that the examples and that we also ought to receive comfort and patience from the scriptures but how thankful we are that these are included for us it comforts us when we see of these things Lord God that our brethren our sisters glowing through trials as Hebrews 11 would call it trials of cruel mockings the Lord God how that you've brought forth from each of their lives just what it is that you purpose this is our confidence Lloyd help us sword many times the Lord God it's not a problem of being strong we're too strong too I think of how your profit in the message perfect strength three times three times he mentions for his own life I'm too strong I'm too strong I'm too strong for what God is calling for me to do Lord Jesus I thank you for that Lord that's the same thing Lord God that I can say from my life I'm too strong works was strong Lord but father you know you know if need be you know just what we need lord help us lord help us Lord enough to complain forgive us when we have complained Lord there's a part of that humanity Lord it might start out complaining but all of a sudden maybe a thought that will come and we will redirect it and begin to take in of that word and say but yet the Lord is on my side the Lord is my health Lord God you're bringing me through this when I come out of this Lord I won't be weaker as far as spiritually I'm gonna be stronger weaker naturally in my natural man I need to be weaker there but to be stronger in you help us Lord the wonder Paul when he caught that inspiration and it struck his heart and he realized what a blessing a blessing not but there that event of his eyes that he was glorying in his eyes being awful but Paul recognized that that coming and going in that trying and testing he realized that in the midst of it he was molding him it was making him it was keeping Paul in a place to where you could speak to him and using Lord God help us lord help us Lord Jesus that we remain in a place where you can speak to us and use a sword for your glory Lord we give ourselves to you Father for every need in every life that's here tonight you've gone for every need for every unspoken request the Lord for each part I'll pray father in the name of Jesus Christ that you would just touch them strengthen them in the midst of this time Lord maybe it's hot right now it's getting hotter but lord I pray that may the angels of God knowing that they're standing at attention lord give us the grease give us the grace to be able to go through but yous told Paul my grace thank you Father in the name of Jesus [Music] [Music] [Music] let it be a prayer now [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] ah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and God bless your dismissed in the name of the Lord God [Music] the blessing I keep searching for a way out seems like [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and God will mold you and make you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music]
