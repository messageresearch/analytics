[42:49] Samuel for giving us the opportunity

[43:14] pray if there's any out sick or
[43:17] different needs, we just pray the Lord
[43:18] be with them where they're at. And just
[43:22] my wife had a little surgery at the
[43:24] beginning of this week, so she's still

[43:46] that's okay to just stay in this channel
[43:48] of Exodus. That's where I've been. So,
[43:51] just pray it's a blessing. It says, "And
[43:52] the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in
[43:55] the land of Egypt, saying, this month
[43:58] shall be unto you the beginning of
[43:59] months. It shall be the first month of
[44:01] the year to you. And speak ye unto all
[44:04] the congregation of Israel, saying, In
[44:06] the 10th day of this month, they shall
[44:08] take to them every man a lamb, according
[44:11] to the house of their fathers, a lamb
[44:13] for a house. And if the household be too
[44:16] little for the lamb, let him and his
[44:19] neighbor next unto his house take it
[44:20] according to the number of the souls.
[44:22] Every man according to his eating shall
[44:25] make your count for the lamb. And your
[44:27] lamb shall be without blemish, a male of
[44:30] the first year. You shall take it out
[44:32] from the sheep or from the goats, and
[44:34] you shall keep it up until the 14th day
[44:37] of the same month. And the whole
[44:39] assembly of the congregation of Israel
[44:41] shall kill it in the evening. And they
[44:44] shall take of the blood and strike it on
[44:46] the two sidepost, and on the upper
[44:48] doorpost of the houses, wherein they
[44:50] shall eat it. And they shall eat the
[44:52] flesh in that night, roast with fire,
[44:54] and unleaven bread, with bitter herbs
[44:56] they shall eat it, and eat not of it
[44:59] raw, nor soden at soden at all with
[45:02] water, excuse me, but roast with fire,
[45:06] his head with his legs, and with the
[45:07] pertinence thereof. And you shall let
[45:09] nothing of it remain until the morning.
[45:12] And that which remainth of it until the
[45:14] morning, you shall burn with fire. And
[45:16] thus shall you eat it with your loins
[45:18] girded, your shoes on your feet, your
[45:20] staff in your hand, and ye shall eat it
[45:22] in haste. It is the Lord's
[45:25] Passover. For I will pass through the
[45:27] land of Egypt this night, and will smite
[45:30] all the firstborn in the land of Egypt,
[45:32] both man and beast, and against all the
[45:34] gods of Egypt, I will execute judgment.
[45:37] For I am the Lord. And this blood shall
[45:40] be to you for a token upon the houses
[45:42] where ye are. And when I see the blood,
[45:45] I will pass over you, and the plague
[45:48] shall not be upon you to destroy you.
[45:50] Amen. When I smite the land of Egypt. If
[45:53] we could just bow our heads for a word
[45:54] of prayer. If you have a need, just make
[45:56] it known unto the Lord this morning.
[45:59] Heavenly Father, we thank you, Lord, for
[46:01] your grace and your mercy. Father, your
[46:03] presence that's here in the building,
[46:05] Father, already even as we just seen how
[46:08] you orchestrated the songs, Father.
[46:10] Lord, what a precious blood. Father, we
[46:13] thank you for this assembly, Lord. And
[46:15] what a precious people they are to me,
[46:18] Father, and I know they are to you. And
[46:20] Lord, I pray that you just minister to
[46:22] the needs of their heart this morning,
[46:24] Father. Lord, I don't know their needs.
[46:26] And Father, I pray that you would just
[46:28] close my lips from saying anything that
[46:30] you wouldn't have us to say. And Father,
[46:32] once again, we ask that you would open
[46:34] them, Lord, in your mercy and grace to
[46:36] speak to that which your children have
[46:38] need of, Father. and we'll be sure to
[46:40] give you the glory for you're the only
[46:42] mighty one amongst us, Lord. You're the
[46:44] only one who can discern the thoughts of
[46:46] the heart, Father. And Lord, we pray
[46:48] that you have your preeminence this
[46:50] morning and we'll be sure to give you
[46:52] the glory, Lord. May you just give us a
[46:54] special grace, Father, as we commit
[46:57] these things in your hands in Jesus
[46:58] name. Amen and amen. You may have your
[47:01] seats this
[47:05] morning. Amen. And it's just pray just
[47:10] the Lord give us grace. We'll just take
[47:11] a few moments on these things and try
[47:13] not to hold you long today. But just
[47:16] want to take a little thought out of
[47:17] that text on it. It's applying time.
[47:20] It's applying time. Speaking of the
[47:22] token that we're going to get to on it's
[47:25] applying time, but just for a few
[47:26] moments to to lead up to where we last
[47:29] time we were here, we spoke on that that
[47:31] conference that Moses had at the burning
[47:33] bush. Amen. brother Brian, how he he met
[47:36] that pillar of fire in that bush and he
[47:38] began to commune with it and begin to
[47:40] receive a commission from that pillar of
[47:42] fire that that voice of that fire would
[47:44] come into a prophet and begin to
[47:46] minister to the people that which they
[47:48] would have need of in that season. And
[47:51] as he's beginning to have that
[47:52] conference, of course, he's beginning to
[47:54] wonder, well, what shall I say? Or or or
[47:57] how sh how shall they believe me? And
[47:59] the Lord begin to talk to him and tell
[48:01] him what was going to take place and
[48:03] tell him how it was going to be when he
[48:05] went down there. And he begin to show
[48:06] him that he would give him two signs.
[48:08] And the signs, of course, there would be
[48:10] a voice to follow the sign. But those
[48:12] signs would be to to catch the attention
[48:14] or to vindicate that God had sent him.
[48:17] And they begin to give him a sign of of
[48:20] of a judgment rod that would be in his
[48:22] hand that he could cast it down and it
[48:24] would turn into a serpent and he could
[48:26] take it up again and it would turn back
[48:28] into a rod and it would be the the
[48:30] judgment rod. And of course, brother
[48:31] Brandon would say that the name of the
[48:33] Lord is the rod that was in the hand of
[48:35] Moses is the name of the Lord in the
[48:37] hands of the church today. And so that
[48:39] would be his first sign. And he said if
[48:41] they wouldn't listen to the voice of the
[48:42] first sign, they would hear the second
[48:45] sign. And he began to show him how he
[48:46] could take his hand and put it in his
[48:48] bosom and take it out and it would be
[48:49] full of leprosy. And then he could take
[48:52] it again and put it back in and pull it
[48:54] out and it would be cleansed. And
[48:56] brother Brandon picked that up and begin
[48:58] to say that it shows that a judgment rod
[49:01] is not to be handled with the hand of
[49:03] leprosy, but it's to be handled with
[49:06] clean hands. Amen. He's showing that a a
[49:08] minister of this gospel or or somebody
[49:11] that would handle this word should not
[49:13] handle it, amen, with dirty hands of the
[49:16] world, but they should handle it with
[49:17] cleansed hands that have been cleansed
[49:20] by the blood of Jesus Christ. Amen. And
[49:21] brother Brandham would get so uh
[49:24] appalled and disgusted and begin to tell
[49:26] about those like Jimmy Osborne and Elvis
[49:29] Presley that would come up and even I
[49:31] believe he said Jimmy Osborne had got on
[49:33] the station and you know there he was
[49:35] singing his worldly music maybe the
[49:37] night before and then get up and read a
[49:38] scripture and testify. And brother Bram
[49:41] said, "These things shouldn't be so, but
[49:43] this word should not be handled in an
[49:45] unclean mouth or with unclean hands, but
[49:47] it should be handled by the hand that
[49:50] had been dipped, amen, in the blood of
[49:52] Jesus Christ." Amen. That we were all
[49:54] born in sin. Amen. And we were all
[49:55] shaped into iniquity. So, we came into
[49:57] the world with dirty hands. But he said,
[49:59] "You shouldn't handle this word with
[50:01] dirty hands." But God wants somebody
[50:03] with clean hands. Amen. God's looking
[50:05] for a clean church. Amen. People that'll
[50:07] handle this word. Amen. in in a delicacy
[50:10] and an honor and a respect because it's
[50:13] Christ. Amen. It's we're not handling
[50:15] the words of some man. These are the
[50:17] words of God. He said they should be
[50:18] handled with clean hands. Amen. Just
[50:21] like he would take the ashes of the red
[50:22] heer and the waters of separation. He
[50:24] said those those ashes were to be kept
[50:27] in a clean place and handled by by by by
[50:30] the priest and those with clean hands.
[50:32] They weren't kept in a dirty place. They
[50:34] weren't just stored anywhere, but they
[50:36] were stored in clean vessels and handled
[50:39] with clean hands. And that's my desire
[50:41] today as the Bible talks about having
[50:43] clean hands and having a pure heart. I
[50:46] believe that's my desire this morning.
[50:47] Lord, don't ever let me, Amen, handle
[50:50] this word with a dirty conscience or
[50:52] dirty hands of the world. But Father,
[50:54] sanctify me, Lord, by this word that I
[50:57] might deliver it to your people in a
[50:59] cleanly way. Amen. Not to get up here.
[51:01] Amen. And and brother Brandham talked
[51:04] about how you should study to show
[51:06] yourself approved. He said how you
[51:07] shouldn't just uh uh someone in the bar
[51:09] room one night and then put him in the
[51:11] pulpit, you know, just in a week or two.
[51:13] He said you should study to show
[51:15] yourself to prove. Not a fly by night,
[51:16] but to be sure that that vessel has come
[51:19] through the cleansing of the washing of
[51:21] the water of the word before they would
[51:23] ever handle, amen, the word of God or or
[51:26] or or you know, to get up and make a
[51:29] mockery of it. But but it should be a
[51:31] clean thing. Amen. I believe that's what
[51:33] Pilate wanted. Amen. Because he had the
[51:36] blood of Jesus on his hands. But he
[51:38] tried to wash it in the water of just
[51:41] some church or some creed or putting his
[51:44] name on a book. And you can't wash the
[51:46] blood of Jesus off your hands. Amen.
[51:48] With the water of just a natural water,
[51:51] a natural church or a natural, amen,
[51:54] dryeyed confession. But it would take
[51:55] the blood of Jesus. Amen. to wash the
[51:58] sinner's hands. Amen. And give him a
[52:01] clean heart. And I believe it's
[52:03] available this morning. And it it can
[52:05] only come by the blood. Amen. It can
[52:07] only come through that washing of the
[52:09] blood that a people could have a clean
[52:11] hands and a pure heart. Amen. And and I
[52:15] so love it. Brother Brandon beginning to
[52:16] show these two signs given to Moses. And
[52:19] he said if they don't heed to the first
[52:21] sign or the second sign that he should
[52:23] take water out of the river and pour it
[52:26] on the land and it would become blood.
[52:28] Amen. And he be even would tie that to
[52:30] how the disciples would go into the land
[52:33] and if their message wasn't received and
[52:35] they were persecuted and cast out. He
[52:37] said they should uh uh shake the dust
[52:39] off their shoes or wipe the dust off and
[52:41] leave because I it's showing that
[52:43] there's been a rejection of the word.
[52:45] There's been a rejection of the message.
[52:47] And he said if the those two signs were
[52:49] rejected, there would come a drenching
[52:51] of blood showing that those who would
[52:54] reject it and turn it away that there
[52:56] would come a drenching of the blood.
[52:59] Amen. That that they would have to wash
[53:01] their dust from the feet and move on
[53:03] because they wouldn't receive it. And
[53:04] brother Bram said if they won't hear
[53:06] that, just take water and pour it upon
[53:08] the ground. And that was the sign that
[53:10] they'd be drenched there in their own
[53:11] blood. And another place he said their
[53:14] their blood's already drenched in it.
[53:15] Then Egypt is finished. We've had the
[53:17] first and God the second. I wonder if
[53:19] the next isn't the drenching of the
[53:21] blood and showing that it was a serious
[53:24] time that judgment was coming. And it
[53:26] was important, Amen, that those that
[53:28] would receive the messenger and the
[53:30] message for that hour would be safe. But
[53:32] those that would reject it, amen, of
[53:34] course, they would begin to go into
[53:36] judgment. And so, and so Moses begins to
[53:39] receive this commission from that pillar
[53:41] of fire. And he goes to his
[53:42] father-in-law and ask if he can return
[53:44] to Egypt. And the Lord begins to show
[53:46] him that it's time to go. All those that
[53:49] sought your life, they're they're
[53:50] they're no longer living. They're dead.
[53:52] It's time to go down into Egypt. And so
[53:55] he begin to saddle up on that on that
[53:57] mule with his wife and with his
[53:59] children. And as brother Brandon begins
[54:01] to dramatize that so many times about
[54:03] that one-man invasion. There he is
[54:06] riding down that dusty road with his
[54:08] family and that staff in his hand going
[54:11] down to take over. Amen. A one-man
[54:14] invasion. And and the Bible says Moses
[54:16] took his wife and his sons and set them
[54:18] upon an ass. And he returned to the land
[54:20] of Egypt. And Moses took the rod of God
[54:23] in his hand. And the Lord said unto
[54:25] Moses, when thou goest to return into
[54:27] Egypt, see that thou do all those
[54:30] wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put
[54:32] in thine hand, but I will harden his
[54:34] heart, that he shall not let the people
[54:36] go, and thou shalt say unto Pharaoh,
[54:37] thus sayeth the Lord, Israel is my son,
[54:41] even my firstborn, and I say unto thee,
[54:43] let my son go, that he may serve me. And
[54:46] if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I
[54:48] will slay thy son, even thy firstborn.
[54:51] So we see how the scene is being set
[54:53] that that what the reason that that last
[54:56] plague was going to be the death of the
[54:57] firstborn was because Israel was God's
[55:00] firstborn. Amen. A as as as the Bible
[55:04] talks about Ephraim and Manasseh as they
[55:06] would come forth out of that womb and
[55:08] Jacob was going to bless him. I believe
[55:10] it was and and that one hand stuck out
[55:12] and they and they and they uh I believe
[55:15] tied the ribbon around it showing that
[55:17] that would be the one to receive the
[55:18] blessing. But then they ended up pulling
[55:20] that hand back in and the other son came
[55:22] out first showing that it would be the
[55:24] cross. Amen. Where Israel would be the
[55:27] firstborn. But the blessing would go to
[55:29] the Gentile at the cross. Amen. Because
[55:31] Israel would reject the Messiah. Amen.
[55:35] Amen. For our sakes that the Gentile
[55:37] people might receive the mercy of the
[55:40] blood and God would take onto him a
[55:42] gentile bride. Amen. But Israel was the
[55:44] firstborn. Israel, Amen, would be the
[55:47] firstborn. But that gentile bride came
[55:49] in under that cross and receive the
[55:51] blessing. Amen. I'm thankful for that
[55:53] cross, for that blood. Amen. That we
[55:56] might re that we might have a part in
[55:58] this. But Israel was to be a firstborn.
[56:00] And so God is is beginning to tell him
[56:02] that if you don't let my firstborn go,
[56:04] then I will slay your firstborn. And so
[56:07] he begins to go down into Egypt. And the
[56:09] Bible says it came to pass by the way of
[56:13] in the end that the Lord met him and
[56:16] sought to kill him. And that's when
[56:17] Zapora took a sharp stone and cut off
[56:19] the foreskin of her son and cast it at
[56:22] his feet and said, "Surely a bloody
[56:23] husband art thou to me." So he let him
[56:25] go. And he then she said, "A bloody
[56:27] husband thou art because of the
[56:29] circumcision." And someone asked brother
[56:31] Brandham that what does that scripture
[56:32] mean that God aimed to kill Moses or his
[56:35] son? And brother Brandham begins to
[56:37] bring out that circumcision was given as
[56:40] a sign to Abraham. A and Moses had
[56:43] forgot to circumcise his own son. Here
[56:46] he is going down. Amen. To take part in
[56:48] a deliverance. Here he is going on his
[56:50] journey down to Egypt. But the very
[56:53] delivering sign of circumcision he had
[56:55] failed to execute and God was going to
[56:57] kill him because he got so caught up in
[57:00] the journey and so caught up in what he
[57:02] was going to do that he forgot the seal
[57:04] of circumcision. And brother Brandham
[57:07] begins to bring out I mean my how how
[57:09] people are trying to go into all the
[57:11] world and and build schools and and and
[57:14] build seminaries and try to get people
[57:16] saved and they're forgetting the seal of
[57:19] circumcision. He said there they go and
[57:21] they're amen leaving husbands and wives
[57:24] and it's becoming amen they're not
[57:27] handling it with clean hands. It's
[57:29] they're making it a dirty thing. And
[57:31] amen. And and yet maybe it looks like
[57:33] good works to go into all the world and
[57:35] try to try to spread the gospel, but
[57:37] they're forgetting the seal of
[57:39] circumcision. And God said, Amen. We
[57:42] Amen. I He said here, "God, send us a
[57:46] zapora." Amen. Because the church is
[57:49] trying to go on and they're forgetting
[57:50] the seal of circumcision. And he said,
[57:52] "God, send us a zapora." Amen. That
[57:55] would would put a stop to it. And it
[57:57] saved Moses's life because God was
[58:00] angered at Moses and ready to kill him
[58:02] because he was forgetting the seal of
[58:04] circumcision. But Zapora said, "Hold it,
[58:06] Moses." Amen. Wait, you're forgetting
[58:08] something. And so, he would have to
[58:11] circumcise his son before they would go
[58:13] down to Egypt. But but we want to notice
[58:15] this because Gersham and I don't I don't
[58:17] know if the scripture says exactly that
[58:19] that's that that's who they were talking
[58:21] about but but it would have been Moses's
[58:23] son and I assume it would have been his
[58:25] firstborn that he had forgot to
[58:27] circumcise. So here they were
[58:29] circumcising his firstborn. See this was
[58:32] a prophet's son and he was going to be
[58:34] circumcised at that time before they
[58:36] ever got into Egypt. But we're but but
[58:39] we're heading towards the token now. And
[58:42] at the time of the token, that
[58:44] circumcision wasn't going to be enough.
[58:46] Or else, why would the token be
[58:47] required? So, there was there there was
[58:50] a time where Moses's son was actually
[58:53] circumcised, which was the covenant that
[58:56] was given to Abraham, but but but
[58:58] there's coming a change where God is
[59:01] going to require more than a
[59:02] circumcision, but he's going to require
[59:04] a token. Even as brother Brandon would
[59:06] begin to dramatize that on that Passover
[59:08] night that those priests and things
[59:10] would raise up and think, well, I'm a
[59:12] circumcised Jew and and this and that.
[59:15] But he said, God didn't say when I see
[59:17] the covenant. God didn't say when I see
[59:19] the circumcision. God said when I see
[59:20] the token, I will pass over you. I must
[59:23] see the life. Amen. Not just to say,
[59:25] well, I'm a believer, but I don't know
[59:27] about that message. I don't know about
[59:29] the days of miracles still being in
[59:31] action. I don't know about all this, but
[59:33] I'm a believer. He's saying, "No, it's
[59:35] more than that. You must have a token of
[59:37] the Holy Ghost upon your life." Amen.
[59:40] Brother Bram said, "No matter how much
[59:41] anyone could prove he was a Jew and a
[59:43] covenant Jew by circumcision." That
[59:45] didn't do anything about it at all. It
[59:47] took the token, not the covenant. He
[59:49] never said, "When I see the covenant
[59:51] sign, when I see the token." So he said,
[59:53] "Today, you might be a professed
[59:55] Christian. You might be a covenant with
[59:58] covenant with Christ. But unless that
[59:59] token is displayed in this late hour
[1:00:02] that we're coming to now, there's no way
[1:00:04] for him to pass over, the token must be
[1:00:07] displayed. Amen. And brother Brandham
[1:00:10] said, "A Jew could furnish the evidence
[1:00:12] that he was in the covenant, but the
[1:00:14] token wasn't there. The covenant was
[1:00:16] without any effect." Amen. The token had
[1:00:20] to be there for the covenant to be in
[1:00:22] effect. Amen. Maybe there was a time
[1:00:24] when they had lived under that
[1:00:26] circumcision, but now they're coming
[1:00:28] into a time where the co to token must
[1:00:31] be there to show that the covenant is in
[1:00:33] effect. I love it because brother
[1:00:35] Brandon would begin to perform wedding
[1:00:37] ceremonies and he would begin to perform
[1:00:39] vows between a husband and a wife and he
[1:00:42] would, you know, say, "Will you take
[1:00:43] this man? Will you take this woman?" And
[1:00:45] they would say, "I will." And then
[1:00:47] brother Brandham said,"I will require a
[1:00:49] token of you that this covenant betw
[1:00:51] twixed you that's been made will always
[1:00:54] be kept." And they would have to have a
[1:00:56] token to show that that covenant would
[1:00:58] be kept. Amen. And there was a time when
[1:01:00] this bride existed under a
[1:01:03] denominational Pentecostal age. And
[1:01:05] maybe there was a time where those
[1:01:07] things were okay. But now they're coming
[1:01:08] into a season where God is calling out a
[1:01:11] bride and an exodus. And he's bringing a
[1:01:14] uniting between husband and wife because
[1:01:16] the word has come down and is and is
[1:01:19] uniting with amen the female part the
[1:01:22] bride that's here on the earth and it's
[1:01:24] a marriage and a prophet standing on the
[1:01:26] scene saying amen will you take this man
[1:01:29] to be your husband and will you take
[1:01:30] this woman to be your wife and I will
[1:01:32] require a token to show that this
[1:01:35] covenant will be kept and in effect.
[1:01:36] Amen. I won't just require, we're not
[1:01:38] under a mean just a justification or
[1:01:41] sanctification, but he said, I will
[1:01:43] require a token. If you want to be
[1:01:45] called the bride, if you want to escape
[1:01:47] the tribulation, then you must have a
[1:01:49] token to show, amen, that you are in
[1:01:51] this union, that you are in this
[1:01:53] covenant with Christ. Oh my, I I believe
[1:01:56] it's a token time. Amen. And and so even
[1:01:59] though they circumcised his son, they
[1:02:03] were coming down into a change where the
[1:02:05] token would be required. And so God
[1:02:08] gives Moses these signs and he begins to
[1:02:10] go down into Israel and he gathers the
[1:02:13] elders of Israel and and they believe on
[1:02:16] Moses. But of course, Pharaoh's heart
[1:02:18] begins to harden and he says, "I won't
[1:02:21] let the people go." And he begins to
[1:02:22] increase the labor, amen, of the
[1:02:25] children of Israel. and begins to say,
[1:02:28] you know, where they have to gather
[1:02:30] their own straw and the different
[1:02:31] things. He begin to increase the labor,
[1:02:34] but God said, I'll multiply my signs and
[1:02:36] wonders in the land of Egypt. And so
[1:02:39] Moses ministry begins to come down and
[1:02:42] he begins to cast down that that
[1:02:44] serpent. He begins to exercise those two
[1:02:46] signs to the people of Egypt. Amen. I a
[1:02:51] and Pharaoh's heart would begin to get
[1:02:53] hardened. And so God would begin to pour
[1:02:55] out those plagues. The water would turn
[1:02:58] to blood. The frogs would come. The the
[1:03:00] gnats would come. The flies would come.
[1:03:02] The livestock would begin to die. The
[1:03:04] boils would come. The hell would come.
[1:03:06] The locust would come. Darkness would
[1:03:08] come. And then it would finally come
[1:03:09] down to the death of the firstborn. And
[1:03:12] and these aren't just history lessons,
[1:03:14] but these are types that are laying in
[1:03:16] scripture. I mean, showing what would
[1:03:18] take place in this end time. And brother
[1:03:20] Brandon begins to say, "Wait till I
[1:03:22] preach on those plagues opening up,
[1:03:24] showing that there would be a judgment
[1:03:25] that would come in this end time. There
[1:03:27] would be plagues that would be poured
[1:03:29] out. That would be horrible sights that
[1:03:31] would come as a judgment in this end
[1:03:33] time." And brother Brandham said, "Oh,
[1:03:35] brother, you better get to go while
[1:03:37] there's time to get to go. Don't pay any
[1:03:40] attention to this outside." And I'm so
[1:03:42] thankful. Amen. There they were. And
[1:03:44] judgment was coming. There they were. A
[1:03:47] a and the plagues were being poured out
[1:03:49] in the land of Egypt. But God had
[1:03:51] provided a chosen people a land that was
[1:03:54] called Goan. He said, "You better get to
[1:03:56] Goan." Amen. While there's time to get
[1:03:59] to Goan, there stood an angel of mercy
[1:04:02] saying, "Get to go. Escape hither. Come
[1:04:05] quickly, for I can do nothing until you
[1:04:07] come hither." And God be to gather his
[1:04:10] children into the land of Goan. It was a
[1:04:13] place of comfort and plenty. It was a
[1:04:15] region of Egypt and it was in Egypt. It
[1:04:18] wasn't outside of Egypt. It was in
[1:04:20] Egypt, but it was east of the Nile Delta
[1:04:23] and it was granted to Jacob and his
[1:04:25] descendants by the king of Egypt and
[1:04:27] inhabited by them until the Exodus. You
[1:04:29] see that Jacob and his children were
[1:04:32] living in Canaan, but there was coming
[1:04:34] famine in Canaan. There was coming,
[1:04:36] Amen. There was no food any longer in
[1:04:39] Canaan at all dried up, but there was a
[1:04:41] Joseph that was in the land. And so they
[1:04:44] said, "We'll go down to Joseph to see if
[1:04:46] we can get some food for our livestock
[1:04:49] and for our family." And so they went
[1:04:50] down to Joseph and and Joseph would
[1:04:54] begin to tell them that thou shalt dwell
[1:04:57] in the land of Goan, and thou shalt be
[1:04:59] near unto me, thou and thy children, and
[1:05:01] thy children's children, and thy flocks,
[1:05:04] and thy herds, and all that thou hast.
[1:05:07] Amen. Famine was in Canaan, Canaan. But
[1:05:10] when they got into Gan, there was
[1:05:12] spiritual food in due season in Goan.
[1:05:15] Amen. Plagues were be about to fall in
[1:05:19] Egypt. But there was safety in
[1:05:22] Goan. Oh my. Brother Bram says the
[1:05:25] spirit. He says perfect of the church
[1:05:28] today. The only place spiritual food is
[1:05:30] given out is in the kingdom of Jesus
[1:05:34] Christ. I mean, that's where there's
[1:05:36] food. Joseph uh Jo goan in Exodus 8:es
[1:05:42] 20 to 23 we'll just read the 22nd and
[1:05:46] 23rd verse it says I will sever in that
[1:05:48] day the land of goan in which my people
[1:05:52] dwell that no swarms of flies shall be
[1:05:54] there oh my to the end thou mayest know
[1:05:58] that I am the Lord in the midst of the
[1:06:00] earth and I will put a division between
[1:06:03] my people and thy people tomorrow shall
[1:06:06] this time be. Amen. He said, "The
[1:06:09] plagues are going to fall, but in the
[1:06:11] land of Goan, I will put a division. I
[1:06:14] will sever you, Amen, from the judgments
[1:06:17] of Egypt. I will sever you from the
[1:06:20] famine of Egypt. I will put a division
[1:06:22] between you and the judgments of Egypt.
[1:06:25] There'll be no flies in Goan. There'll
[1:06:27] be no hell in Goan. There'll be no fleas
[1:06:29] in Goan. But I will hide you away. And
[1:06:32] in my pavilion, you'll be hid away in
[1:06:34] the time of trouble. And I like how it
[1:06:37] said, "I will put a division." I mean,
[1:06:39] it wasn't going to be a man-made
[1:06:41] division, but it would be a division
[1:06:42] that would come from Almighty God. It
[1:06:45] wasn't a wall that they were going to
[1:06:46] build around it. It wasn't an armed
[1:06:49] force that was going to stand around it,
[1:06:51] but there would be a supernatural
[1:06:53] division that would be placed there by
[1:06:55] Almighty God. Oh, sometimes man tries to
[1:06:58] bring the division. And they begin to
[1:07:00] separate between different classes of
[1:07:02] people. And if you have a mean rich or
[1:07:04] poor and they begin to divide them and
[1:07:06] amen maybe if you if you look good or if
[1:07:09] you don't look good and man would begin
[1:07:11] to divide that way but that's not how
[1:07:13] God divides. Amen. But in the kingdom of
[1:07:16] God amen he said even the unc on
[1:07:18] uncumbly parts amen would be bestowed
[1:07:20] abundant honor. Amen. In God's kingdom
[1:07:23] he said there'll be no schism. There'll
[1:07:25] be no division because God grants honor
[1:07:28] to the unhonorable. Amen. and he's able
[1:07:31] to take every part, amen, and give it a
[1:07:33] place in his kingdom. But when man tries
[1:07:36] to divide, they'll they'll say, "Well,
[1:07:38] uh uh you have to be a certain class to
[1:07:40] to to be in this position." But that's
[1:07:42] not how God divides. But God separates
[1:07:45] by his
[1:07:46] word. That's how God separates. Brother
[1:07:49] Bram says when it comes to the
[1:07:50] separating time, the word done the
[1:07:53] separating. So it is today the word done
[1:07:55] the separating. Amen. Man doesn't do the
[1:07:58] separating. Amen. I I don't come up here
[1:08:01] and say, "Well, you're in and you're out
[1:08:03] and you're in and you're out." No, I
[1:08:04] just preach the word and it's the word
[1:08:07] that does the separating. As the Bible
[1:08:09] says, how can two walk together except
[1:08:11] they be agreed and and brother, I may
[1:08:14] lose some friends in this journey. But I
[1:08:16] don't want to lose a friend because I I
[1:08:18] went off the the handle and I got mad
[1:08:20] and I got angry and I got upset at them.
[1:08:22] But if I ever have to leave some friends
[1:08:25] behind, I want it to be because I'm
[1:08:28] walking with the vindicated word for the
[1:08:30] hour. Amen. I wish to God, Amen, that
[1:08:33] every man and woman on the earth could
[1:08:35] walk with this word. But if I have to
[1:08:37] walk alone to walk with this word, then
[1:08:39] I'll walk alone. Amen. And I'll let the
[1:08:41] word do the separating because it's the
[1:08:43] word that's magnetized me in this hour.
[1:08:46] And I say it's nothing but the truth and
[1:08:49] it's a separating time. Amen. And if you
[1:08:51] don't want to be identified with the
[1:08:54] judgments of Egypt, amen, then you don't
[1:08:56] want to be identified with those
[1:08:58] denominational systems because that's
[1:09:00] Egypt and they're going into judgment.
[1:09:02] Amen. But this is a time to separate
[1:09:05] from the world and the things of the
[1:09:07] world and say, "I believe the message of
[1:09:10] the hour. I'm not here to water it down.
[1:09:12] I'm not here to make it lukewarm and
[1:09:14] formal and powerless. Amen. I'm in goan
[1:09:17] and I'm enjoying a feast of a seven
[1:09:20] course meal and I will not. Amen. Like
[1:09:22] that old Balam doctrine to say we're all
[1:09:25] one. Let's come together. Let's all be
[1:09:27] one. Amen. But that's not how God
[1:09:29] operates. Go. Amen. Brother Brham said
[1:09:31] they weren't brothers. They were half
[1:09:33] brothers. Amen. And we're not all the
[1:09:35] same. We're not brothers with the
[1:09:37] Methodists and the Baptist and I mean
[1:09:39] and the Pentecostals. We are a separated
[1:09:42] people called out by the message of the
[1:09:45] hour. As that Revelations 18 voice said,
[1:09:47] "Come out from among her, my people that
[1:09:50] you receive not of her plagues." Amen.
[1:09:53] And if you don't want to receive of her
[1:09:54] plagues, you've got to have a
[1:09:57] separation. Oh, God called Abraham to a
[1:10:00] separation. Amen. God called a prophet
[1:10:03] to a separation. He said, "You're
[1:10:04] walking with too many. To walk with me,
[1:10:07] you'll walk alone. We are not the same."
[1:10:09] Amen. There's got to be a separation as
[1:10:12] God would separate the sheep and the
[1:10:14] goats and God would separate the wheat
[1:10:16] from the tears. And I like how Joshua
[1:10:18] said it. Amen. Choose I if it seem evil
[1:10:21] unto you to serve the Lord, choose you
[1:10:24] this day whom you will serve. Whether
[1:10:27] the gods which your father served that
[1:10:29] were on the other side of the flood or
[1:10:31] the gods of the Amorites in whose land
[1:10:33] ye dwell. But as for me in my house, we
[1:10:36] will serve the Lord. Amen. That's how I
[1:10:39] feel tonight. Ask for me in my house. We
[1:10:41] will serve the Lord. Amen. And then he
[1:10:44] said, "Farther down now, therefore, put
[1:10:46] away, said he, the strange gods, which
[1:10:49] are among you and include, incline your
[1:10:52] heart onto the Lord God of Israel."
[1:10:55] Amen. It's a separating time. Choose you
[1:10:57] this day who you will serve. Amen. Do
[1:11:00] you believe the message or don't you?
[1:11:02] Amen. Are you the bride or aren't you?
[1:11:04] Amen. It's time to put a stake down in
[1:11:07] your land and say, "This is who I am."
[1:11:09] Amen. This is what I believe. This is
[1:11:11] what belongs to me. This isn't a time to
[1:11:13] sit on the French fence. Amen. Judgment
[1:11:15] is coming. Amen. This is token time.
[1:11:18] Amen. The the world is gathering into a
[1:11:21] world council of churches, but a bride
[1:11:23] is being called out and separated for a
[1:11:26] rapture in a millennium, saying, "Come
[1:11:29] out of her, my people, and be ye
[1:11:31] separate." Oh, like Elijah said, "How
[1:11:33] long haul ye between two opinions? If
[1:11:36] the Lord be God, follow him." But if
[1:11:38] bell, then follow him. And the people
[1:11:41] answered him not a word. My what it
[1:11:44] would have been like to be there on that
[1:11:45] mountain that evening. Amen. When Elijah
[1:11:48] makes that proclamation, if God be God,
[1:11:51] then serve him. And if Bale be God, then
[1:11:53] follow him. And the people answered not
[1:11:55] a word. Amen. But brother Brandon would
[1:11:57] begin to show how God had a 700 elect
[1:12:01] people down there and they were still
[1:12:03] out in those systems. But that Elijah
[1:12:05] ministry was going to call them out of
[1:12:07] those systems. And it would be an elect
[1:12:09] people that would not bow to the image
[1:12:11] of Bale. And this message, oh, there's a
[1:12:15] 700. There was a bride. There was a
[1:12:17] number, a multitude of people that would
[1:12:19] begin to come out of those denominations
[1:12:22] and said, "Elijah, you're not alone.
[1:12:24] Elijah, we're with you. We won't bow to
[1:12:26] this bell. God is God and we'll serve
[1:12:29] him. Amen. And this message is right and
[1:12:31] we'll serve the message of the hour.
[1:12:33] This is not time to bow our knee to a
[1:12:36] denominational spirits and begin to give
[1:12:38] away our land. This is a separating
[1:12:40] time. Amen. To say this is what I
[1:12:43] believe. Oh God, give us clean hands.
[1:12:46] Amen. that we would, if we call
[1:12:48] ourselves a message church, that we
[1:12:50] would handle the message with clean
[1:12:51] hands and not begin to let little things
[1:12:54] come in, little gray areas. Amen. You
[1:12:57] begin to let spirits get in and before
[1:12:59] you know it, oh my Amen. Uh uh those
[1:13:03] denominational spirits begin to creep
[1:13:05] in. Amen. But that's not who we are.
[1:13:07] That's not what we're here for. We're a
[1:13:09] bride. We are message believing, message
[1:13:13] sons and daughters of God. And we are
[1:13:15] not here, oh my, to to to Amen. Just
[1:13:20] spread our fence into the Egyptian
[1:13:21] lands. But oh God, hide us away in Goan.
[1:13:26] Separate us, Lord. Divide us. Amen. For
[1:13:30] rapture. Oh, there'll be a time when
[1:13:32] it'll let him that's filthy be filthy
[1:13:35] still, and him that's holy, holy still.
[1:13:37] The world will go worse and worse, but
[1:13:40] God's spirit will get greater and
[1:13:42] greater. Oh, that's the side I want to
[1:13:44] be on. Amen. My that's the side I want
[1:13:49] to be on. As God would separate the
[1:13:51] light from the darkness. As it says in
[1:13:53] Genesis
[1:13:55] 1:4, God saw the light that it was good.
[1:13:59] And God divided the light from the
[1:14:01] darkness. He sent the light to separate
[1:14:03] darkness from light. And brother Brham
[1:14:06] said, "Let there be light." And God
[1:14:07] separated the light from the darkness.
[1:14:09] And I believe that we are now living in
[1:14:11] that hour again when God is separating
[1:14:14] light from darkness. In shalom, skipping
[1:14:16] down, he says it's light time. It's
[1:14:19] light time coming for the believers, but
[1:14:21] it's gross darkness for the people. He
[1:14:24] said in shalom, the only light that we
[1:14:26] can have today in the church is God
[1:14:28] vindicating his light to this
[1:14:29] generation. He said it's coming a time
[1:14:32] when the light in the darkness will have
[1:14:34] to be separated one from the other.
[1:14:36] church in its order will take the order
[1:14:38] of the day and Christ and his lightword
[1:14:41] promise will go in the rapture and turn
[1:14:44] on the light. He said and the word of
[1:14:46] God made manifest always separates the
[1:14:49] light from the darkness. People can rise
[1:14:51] up with this that or the other isms can
[1:14:54] rise. Communism, fascism, all other isms
[1:14:57] can rise. Superstition cults whatever it
[1:15:00] might be might rise. But when that king
[1:15:03] light of the Bible raises up all
[1:15:06] superstitions and things, but you see,
[1:15:08] we know it's there, but until it's
[1:15:10] vindicated, proves it's light, then we
[1:15:12] have no right to argue against that
[1:15:14] because it shuts out all the other light
[1:15:17] out. Amen. God sends the light to
[1:15:21] separate, Amen. light from darkness. and
[1:15:23] at the rising of the sun. Amen. We who
[1:15:26] once walked in dark denominational light
[1:15:29] have been separated under the message of
[1:15:32] the hour. That we're no longer walking
[1:15:34] in confusion. We're no longer arguing
[1:15:37] about what the scripture means, but
[1:15:39] we're walking in clear vindicated light
[1:15:42] and it's shining down upon us and we
[1:15:44] know where we're at and we know what we
[1:15:46] believe. Amen. Because when the ninth
[1:15:48] plague of darkness fell upon Egypt,
[1:15:51] there wasn't darkness in Goan, but Goan
[1:15:54] was in light the whole time. Oh, arise,
[1:15:57] shine. Thy light has come, and the glory
[1:16:00] of the Lord is being revealed upon you.
[1:16:03] Amen. Darkness shall be upon Egypt and
[1:16:05] gross darkness upon her people. Amen.
[1:16:08] But thy light has come. Oh, little
[1:16:10] bride, you're not walking in darkness,
[1:16:12] but you're walking in the light. Oh my.
[1:16:15] and you're not going to judgement.
[1:16:18] Exodus 9:26 said, "Only in the land of
[1:16:20] Gan, where the children of Israel were,
[1:16:23] was there no
[1:16:24] hell. Oh my, he that heareth my word and
[1:16:28] believeth on him that sent me shall not
[1:16:30] come into the judgment, but has already
[1:16:33] passed from death onto life." Brother
[1:16:36] Brandham takes that goion and he's
[1:16:37] showing that it's a type of the church
[1:16:40] going in the rapture just before the
[1:16:42] tribulation period that the church
[1:16:44] wouldn't go through the tribulation. He
[1:16:46] said when you see the plagues falling
[1:16:48] they were in Egypt, wasn't they? God was
[1:16:50] bringing his people out to the promised
[1:16:52] land. Is that right? And Israel never
[1:16:54] received one plague. Just as the plagues
[1:16:57] before it went, they went into go. Is
[1:16:59] that right? And the sun never did dim
[1:17:01] out. No mosquitoes come. Oh glory.
[1:17:05] That's a reason to shout. No mosquitoes
[1:17:07] come. No frogs was there. No lice was
[1:17:10] there. No storms was there. No lightning
[1:17:12] was there. No killing on the cattle was
[1:17:14] there. Everything they had was preserved
[1:17:17] in goan. Is that right? It's a type of
[1:17:19] the church going just before the
[1:17:21] tribulation period. Jesus said when you
[1:17:23] see these when these things begin to
[1:17:25] come to pass, lift up your head. Your
[1:17:27] redemption is nigh. He said I believe
[1:17:29] the moon and sun and stars that they
[1:17:31] said that. Go ahead and read it. said,
[1:17:32] "And men run and hid themselves and fell
[1:17:34] upon sought to kill themselves and
[1:17:37] couldn't do it and everything." He said,
[1:17:38] "I believe that that takes place just
[1:17:40] before the tribulation." I mean, he's
[1:17:42] showing that a bride wouldn't go through
[1:17:44] the tribulation. And and and I don't
[1:17:46] know how dark it'll get before the
[1:17:48] rapture. I I don't know just how dark it
[1:17:50] might get. I don't know just what it's
[1:17:52] going to look like on the threshold of
[1:17:54] that morning. It may get dark, but
[1:17:56] whether it's dark in this land or not,
[1:17:59] whether Amen. Whether judgment is
[1:18:01] beginning to leak out upon the earth or
[1:18:03] not. Amen. The bride is hid away in go.
[1:18:06] And he said, Amen. Amen. There shall no
[1:18:09] evil befall thee in Psalms 91. Neither
[1:18:12] shall any plague come n thy dwelling.
[1:18:14] Amen. That's he said, flee to go. Amen.
[1:18:18] Amen. Darkness is here. Plagues are
[1:18:20] coming, but oh little bride, you which
[1:18:22] are in goan, you shall not, Amen. be
[1:18:25] judged with the wicked, Amen. But you
[1:18:28] shall receive a way of escape. Oh, an
[1:18:32] angel of mercy calling us out. Amen.
[1:18:34] Brother Brand said, "The Egyptian
[1:18:36] doctors, which was far smarter, far
[1:18:38] smarter than ours today, could not stop
[1:18:40] the plagues of God. Neither could their
[1:18:42] soothsayers or their impersonators. It
[1:18:45] took Gan in the power of God to hold his
[1:18:48] people under the blood of the lamb. Oh
[1:18:51] my friends, I'm not looking for the best
[1:18:53] doctors. I'm not looking for some great
[1:18:56] bomb shelter or some great stockpile of
[1:18:58] food and water. But brother Brandham
[1:19:00] said it took Gan in the power of God to
[1:19:03] hold those people under the blood of a
[1:19:05] lamb. Oh my. And that's where I'm
[1:19:07] investing myself this night. I'm not
[1:19:10] looking. Amen. Amen. to see how much I
[1:19:12] can build up and and how many cans of
[1:19:14] food I can put on the shelf. And when
[1:19:16] I'm looking to get under the blood of
[1:19:18] the lamb for this hour and say, "Lord,
[1:19:20] hide me away under that blood. For you
[1:19:23] said, Lord, that under that blood, we
[1:19:25] wouldn't be partakers of the plagues of
[1:19:27] this world. Lord, judgment may be
[1:19:29] coming, but rapture will come before the
[1:19:32] tribulation comes. And the bride, Amen,
[1:19:35] will not be judged with the wicked. Oh,
[1:19:38] but she'll be caught away in a moment,
[1:19:40] in the twinkling of an eye. Oh, because
[1:19:43] God is gathering his
[1:19:45] people. He was gathering his Israelites
[1:19:48] into his provided place at that time.
[1:19:52] And as Moses's message begin to go
[1:19:54] forth, Israel begin to gather into go.
[1:19:58] God had provided a place for them to
[1:20:00] gather. Oh my brother Brandham say when
[1:20:03] Moses began his ministry in Israel with
[1:20:05] great signs you see Israel quickly
[1:20:07] gathered from all over Egypt to go and
[1:20:10] coming back to the home place because
[1:20:12] they know something was fixing to
[1:20:13] happen. Oh what a type. It's a gathering
[1:20:17] sign. Don't you you see how brother
[1:20:19] Brand would talk about how those animals
[1:20:21] I mean when when earthquake was about to
[1:20:23] strike would gather in the middle of the
[1:20:26] field away from the walls because their
[1:20:29] instinct would tell them something's
[1:20:30] coming and a a a and what caused those
[1:20:34] animals to get into Noah's ark that day
[1:20:37] something some call some instinct begin
[1:20:39] to gather them into the ark and so amen
[1:20:43] a amen those children of Israel amen
[1:20:46] were scattered for a and and they went
[1:20:48] out into the world when Titus would
[1:20:50] besiege the city and a and they would
[1:20:53] even amen tragedy would come and so they
[1:20:56] were scattered. Amen. A and and because
[1:20:59] of that cross amen the firstborn was
[1:21:02] crossed that the gentile might come in.
[1:21:04] Amen. When Jesus come and died on the
[1:21:06] cross, they rejected him and crucified
[1:21:09] him and and Jesus would come and say,
[1:21:11] "How oft would I have gathered you as a
[1:21:15] mother does her brood, but she would
[1:21:17] not." You see, they rejected the
[1:21:19] gathering at that time because the
[1:21:21] gentile bride must come in. Oh, but God
[1:21:24] would say, "I will gather you again. Oh,
[1:21:27] I will gather you again, my children."
[1:21:30] And in the 1940s, those planes begin to
[1:21:32] return back to Israel. At the same time
[1:21:35] that our prophet was receiving a
[1:21:37] commission from an angel and as they're
[1:21:39] gathering back to their homeland, uh,
[1:21:41] Brother Brandon begin to preach a
[1:21:43] message which would be the shout that
[1:21:46] would begin to gather a bride into her
[1:21:48] homeland. The message of the hour. Amen.
[1:21:51] What? It's a gathering sign. Amen. The
[1:21:54] bride is gathering under the revealed
[1:21:56] word. Amen. Because judgments are
[1:21:58] coming. But judgments won't come except
[1:22:01] a hand of mercy would come first, demon
[1:22:04] to give a way of escape to those that
[1:22:06] would desire a way of escape. And this
[1:22:08] message begin to gather you into the one
[1:22:11] provided place. Amen. Not just a certain
[1:22:14] church, not a certain denomination, but
[1:22:16] by one spirit. We're baptized into one
[1:22:19] body. Amen. By one spirit, we would be
[1:22:22] gathered into one body under that lamb,
[1:22:25] which is Christ. Gathered into Christ.
[1:22:28] all by one spirit baptized into one
[1:22:31] body. For there's one Lord, one faith,
[1:22:34] one baptism, one name, one provided
[1:22:38] place. There's one head that this bride
[1:22:41] is gathered under. And it's the headship
[1:22:43] of the revealed word. I said where I'll
[1:22:46] put my name. That'll be my provided
[1:22:49] place. Amen. Where I, brother said, what
[1:22:52] is the life? The name. He placed the
[1:22:55] name on the person. He's showing that at
[1:22:58] the Passover night that there would be a
[1:23:01] provided place that the people could
[1:23:02] gather and that would be where he puts
[1:23:05] his name. Amen. And of course, his name
[1:23:08] is Jesus. And he put that name on on
[1:23:11] Christ and that by one spirit we might
[1:23:14] be gathered into Christ. And he begins
[1:23:16] to take that to the token showing that
[1:23:18] when you come up to someone's house and
[1:23:21] before you knock on the door, you look
[1:23:23] at the sign on the door to make sure
[1:23:25] you're at the right house. and it says
[1:23:27] Hatfield. It shows that I mean that
[1:23:29] that's the name that that family has
[1:23:32] gathered under in that house. And it's
[1:23:35] showing that the blood on the door was
[1:23:37] the the life is the name. Showing that
[1:23:40] if that life was on the door, it shows
[1:23:43] that that was they were under that name
[1:23:46] of Jesus. They were gathered under the
[1:23:49] life of that name and they were gathered
[1:23:52] in Christ. They might have been in
[1:23:53] different houses. Amen. Every family
[1:23:55] might have been in a different house,
[1:23:57] but they were all under that same name,
[1:24:00] all under that same blood. And that's
[1:24:02] how we're gathered this morning. We
[1:24:04] might be spread out across the world,
[1:24:06] the bride. Amen. But we're gathered
[1:24:08] under his name. Amen. We're in God's
[1:24:12] provided place of
[1:24:14] worship. Oh my. Under one head. And
[1:24:18] we're gathered at the table around the
[1:24:21] lamb. As the Bible said, wherever the
[1:24:24] carcass is, there the eagles will be
[1:24:26] gathered. Amen. And there they were
[1:24:28] preparing that lamb for Passover. Amen.
[1:24:31] But there may be come a time where that
[1:24:34] mother would say, "Amen, children, it's
[1:24:36] time to gather. The lamb is ready. It's
[1:24:39] time to gather. You've been waiting and
[1:24:41] waiting and waiting, but it's time to
[1:24:43] gather around the carcass of the lamb."
[1:24:46] Amen. in this last day. Amen. The Holy
[1:24:49] Spirit began to say, "Amen, the carcass
[1:24:52] is here. We're not feeding on
[1:24:53] yesterday's mana. We're not feeding on
[1:24:55] leftovers, but the the word of the day,
[1:24:58] the the bleeding word. Gather around it,
[1:25:01] my children, and feed on the on the word
[1:25:05] of life."
[1:25:08] Oh my, we're all feeding on the same
[1:25:12] lamb. And brother Brandon would say you
[1:25:14] would get a lamb according to the house.
[1:25:16] But brother Brandham say in the other
[1:25:18] terms every family killed a lamb but it
[1:25:20] all represented one lamb showing that
[1:25:22] we're all feeding on the same lamb. And
[1:25:24] it I it's it's the unfailing body word
[1:25:29] of the son of man that we're feeding on.
[1:25:32] And and it said that you shall let
[1:25:34] nothing of it remain until the morning
[1:25:37] and that which remainth of it until the
[1:25:38] morning you shall burn with fire. He
[1:25:41] said, "What was left over, don't let it
[1:25:43] stay till morning to come into this
[1:25:46] other age." He said, "Burn it with fire.
[1:25:49] Be destroyed." That the age that you're
[1:25:51] living in, the message of this age, it's
[1:25:53] got to be brought out of the scriptures
[1:25:55] and vindicated and proved by God that
[1:25:58] it's God doing so. So, so, so th the
[1:26:00] those children as they gathered around
[1:26:02] the table, they knew that they weren't
[1:26:05] eating leftover lamb because a prophet
[1:26:08] had instructed them, don't let it remain
[1:26:10] until morning, but burn it with fire.
[1:26:12] And so, when a prophet come in this age
[1:26:14] and he begins to store up spiritual food
[1:26:17] for the bride, we know that we're not
[1:26:19] eating on the word for another age.
[1:26:21] Amen. Because the prophet commanded,
[1:26:23] Amen, don't let those ages, Amen,
[1:26:26] remain. But this will be the word for
[1:26:28] this age. This will be the message for
[1:26:30] this hour. You'll be eating on the
[1:26:33] carcass. Oh, not a it's a fresh meat for
[1:26:38] the season. And you'll eat it. Amen.
[1:26:40] Cooked with fire. And you'll eat it with
[1:26:43] a staff in your hand and the shoes of
[1:26:44] your feet. Amen. Showing, Amen. that the
[1:26:47] that that you that you're ready to go.
[1:26:50] Amen. You're not eating it. Just Amen.
[1:26:52] laid back somewhere, but you got the
[1:26:54] staff in your hand, the shoes on your
[1:26:56] feet. You're dressed in the armor of the
[1:26:59] word like Paul would write about in
[1:27:01] Ephesians 6. Put on the whole armor. I
[1:27:03] mean, you got you got your shoes on, you
[1:27:05] got your helmet on, you got the staff in
[1:27:07] your hand, and you're eating it ready to
[1:27:10] go.
[1:27:13] And they shall take of the blood and
[1:27:14] strike it on the two sidepost and on the
[1:27:16] upper doorpost of the houses wherein
[1:27:19] they shall eat it. Where are you going
[1:27:22] to eat it? Under the
[1:27:24] blood. Where are we eating this this
[1:27:27] lamb word? We're eating it under the
[1:27:29] blood of the lamb. I mean, we're under
[1:27:32] the blood feeding on the body word of
[1:27:35] the lamb that shed his blood
[1:27:38] because it's it's it would be a time
[1:27:40] where the last plague was about to
[1:27:42] strike. Right. And brother Brandham
[1:27:45] said, "Thus sayaith," or the Bible said,
[1:27:46] Moses said, "Thus sayaith the Lord,
[1:27:48] about midnight will I go out into the
[1:27:49] midst of Egypt, and all the firstborn in
[1:27:52] the land of Egypt shall die from the
[1:27:54] firstborn of Pharaoh that siteth upon
[1:27:55] his throne, even unto the firstborn of
[1:27:58] the maid servant that is behind the
[1:27:59] meal, and the firstborn of the beast.
[1:28:01] And there shall be a great cry
[1:28:02] throughout all the land of Egypt, such
[1:28:04] as there was none like it, nor shall be
[1:28:06] like it anymore, showing this last
[1:28:08] plague was about to fall, and it would
[1:28:09] be a plague of natural death." Amen.
[1:28:12] which was only a type of the last plague
[1:28:15] that would fall in this age and it would
[1:28:16] be a plague of spiritual death. Amen.
[1:28:19] That that that the churches they're
[1:28:21] having protractive meetings but there's
[1:28:23] no revival. The life is leaving. Amen.
[1:28:26] The shock and coming into the sea there.
[1:28:28] Amen. Amen. Death is striking. Amen.
[1:28:31] Those organizations it would be the last
[1:28:34] plague that's hit the Pentecostal
[1:28:36] church. Brother Bram said is spiritual
[1:28:37] death. Amen. The Pentecostal church. I
[1:28:40] mean, there was a time where that was
[1:28:42] the word for the season. But as brother
[1:28:44] Brandon's message is going forth, he's
[1:28:46] saying, "Death is striking even the
[1:28:48] Pentecostal church." And that's why he
[1:28:50] was calling a bride. Come out of her, my
[1:28:53] people. Come out of the Pentecostal
[1:28:55] church and come into the bride age.
[1:28:58] Amen. Leaving the Pentecostal age where
[1:29:00] death is striking and coming into a
[1:29:03] place where there is life. Amen. He
[1:29:07] said, "Not it might strike, but it will
[1:29:08] strike. If you're not under the token
[1:29:10] and not might it strike, it will strike.
[1:29:14] It's going to strike. I mean, if you're
[1:29:16] not under that token, you say, "Well,
[1:29:18] well, well, well, I I won't bow to those
[1:29:21] systems. I won't bow." I mean, I that's
[1:29:24] okay. I'll just I'll just live this way.
[1:29:26] I I don't know about that message, but I
[1:29:28] certainly won't won't bow to that beast.
[1:29:32] Oh, but the Bible said, "All that dwell
[1:29:34] upon the earth shall worship him whose
[1:29:37] names are not written in the book of
[1:29:38] life of the lamb slain from the
[1:29:40] foundation of the world." Amen. A and
[1:29:43] those that would try to stand up against
[1:29:45] her in that time of tribulation, they
[1:29:48] would put her to death. Amen. Amen.
[1:29:50] Amen. It's going to require token to
[1:29:53] withstand. Amen. and to not bow in this
[1:29:56] in this time. Because the Bible said
[1:29:59] that in Revelations
[1:30:02] 22, behold, he said, I gave her space to
[1:30:05] repent of her fornication, and she
[1:30:07] repented not. And behold, I will cast
[1:30:09] her into a bed and then that commit
[1:30:11] adultery with her into great tribulation
[1:30:13] except they repent of their deeds, and I
[1:30:15] will kill her children with death. And
[1:30:18] all the churches shall know that I am he
[1:30:20] which searchth the reigns and hearts.
[1:30:22] and I will give unto every one of you
[1:30:24] according to her works. He's showing
[1:30:26] what will be the punishment of that
[1:30:28] harlot and her children. He said it
[1:30:30] would be
[1:30:30] twofold. He said she would be cast into
[1:30:33] a bed of tribulation and also he would
[1:30:36] kill her children with death. He said
[1:30:39] that would what would be the cause of
[1:30:41] her death? He said usually death comes
[1:30:44] by hanging or drowning. Death comes by
[1:30:47] something. But he said the cause of her
[1:30:49] death would be death. Amen. that he
[1:30:52] would kill her children with death. I
[1:30:54] mean, what is that last plague? It's
[1:30:56] spiritual death. I mean, that all of
[1:30:58] those children as they begin to take on
[1:31:01] that mark of the beast and come into
[1:31:04] denominationalism that they would be
[1:31:06] killed with death. I mean, what was that
[1:31:09] last horse rider? It was a pale horse
[1:31:11] rider. And he said the name of that
[1:31:13] rider was death. I mean, death sat on
[1:31:16] that pale horse. Death would ride in
[1:31:19] this last age and it would kill the
[1:31:22] mother and her children. Amen. But there
[1:31:24] would be an eagle anointing to withstand
[1:31:26] the pale horse rider that God would make
[1:31:29] a way to escape spiritual death. Amen.
[1:31:32] To those overcomers of that age that
[1:31:36] they would not be hurt by that second
[1:31:38] death. As the Bible said, "Blessed is he
[1:31:41] which hath taken part in the first
[1:31:42] resurrection that the second death has
[1:31:45] no part with him." I mean, if you've
[1:31:47] been born again by the spirit of God,
[1:31:50] oh, you can't be hurt by that plague of
[1:31:53] death. Oh, but you come under the
[1:31:55] message. And I think it's so powerful
[1:31:57] that I mean, I I like to if I see a
[1:32:00] negative, I like to look for the
[1:32:02] positive. And if there would be a
[1:32:04] judgment to a mother and her daughters
[1:32:08] because they would take on the mark of
[1:32:10] that beast. Amen. What about under this
[1:32:13] token? I believe, amen, that not only
[1:32:17] can there be salvation to a mother, but
[1:32:20] a mother can claim her children under
[1:32:23] this token mark. Amen. That a mother
[1:32:26] could not only apply the token to
[1:32:28] herself, but she could begin to apply it
[1:32:30] to her household. Amen. That like Rahab
[1:32:34] hung that scarlet cord out of that
[1:32:36] window. Oh, a mother today can hang that
[1:32:41] blood over her home and say, "God, I
[1:32:43] claim them." Amen. God, if that harlot
[1:32:46] could be killed and her children with
[1:32:47] her, then I believe I can be saved and
[1:32:50] my children with me because I'm under a
[1:32:53] different mark. Oh, death can't strike
[1:32:56] that word. There's only one place where
[1:32:59] spiritual death can't strike, Brother
[1:33:01] Dave. That's under this word. Oh,
[1:33:04] there's one place of worship under that
[1:33:06] lamb. And that's the word today. Amen.
[1:33:09] Not under a dead letter, but get under
[1:33:11] the word. Oh, as the Bible said, in the
[1:33:14] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:33:17] with God and the word was God. And the
[1:33:19] word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[1:33:21] What was it? It was Jesus. And he was
[1:33:23] the lamb. As John would say, behold the
[1:33:26] lamb of God. That was the word made
[1:33:29] flesh. And he was the lamb. And the word
[1:33:31] came to Calvary and bled for you and for
[1:33:34] me. Amen. that the word could bleed for
[1:33:37] you. And there's only one place that
[1:33:39] death won't strike and that's the
[1:33:41] bleeding word of God today. Brother
[1:33:43] Brham said, "Can a denomination bleed?
[1:33:46] Can a creed bleed?" No. That's why
[1:33:48] there's no safety under those
[1:33:50] denominations. But he said, "This bride
[1:33:52] has been washed by the water of the
[1:33:54] bleeding word." Oh my. There's safety
[1:33:58] under the bleeding word. Oh, that you've
[1:34:00] been washed by the word bled for you.
[1:34:02] The word came to Calvary and the word
[1:34:05] shed his blood and been for you that you
[1:34:08] could get under the word for your day
[1:34:10] and it would wash you and death could
[1:34:13] not strike you because death had already
[1:34:15] struck the lamb.
[1:34:18] Oh my, it's going to require death.
[1:34:20] Something's going to have to pay for
[1:34:21] your sins. Amen. Something's going to
[1:34:24] have to pay for it. And the only way
[1:34:26] that death's not going to strike you is
[1:34:28] if death has already struck what you're
[1:34:30] under. Amen. And if you are in Christ,
[1:34:33] death has already struck the lamb. And
[1:34:35] so death can't strike you because you're
[1:34:37] under. And when the lamb that has
[1:34:39] already been struck as that stinger of
[1:34:42] death went into that lamb and it would
[1:34:45] lose its stinger forever, then it would
[1:34:48] be a promise to all those that would get
[1:34:50] under that lamb that you would not have
[1:34:52] to pay for your sins and your
[1:34:54] iniquities. You would not have to pay
[1:34:56] for the mistakes of yesterday and last
[1:34:59] week and last month and last year. But
[1:35:01] there would be a place that you could
[1:35:03] get under and say, "Oh my Lord, let the
[1:35:06] let the judgments fall, Lord. I have
[1:35:09] already paid the penalty because I was
[1:35:12] in you when you died on Calvary." Oh,
[1:35:15] were you in him? I mean, were you there?
[1:35:17] I mean, he hadn't separated himself yet,
[1:35:20] but I believe I was there when he went
[1:35:22] to Calvary. Oh, I was there when his
[1:35:26] blood was shed. And so, death has
[1:35:28] already struck that blood. And I'm under
[1:35:31] that blood. It'll be the token that'll
[1:35:33] make a difference. They said, "But
[1:35:35] against any of the children of
[1:35:38] Israel, oh shall not a dog move his
[1:35:41] tongue against man or beast that she may
[1:35:46] know that the Lord does put a difference
[1:35:48] between the Egyptians and Israel."
[1:35:53] All that token was the difference. What
[1:35:54] made Israel different? It was the mark
[1:35:57] of that spiritual leadership of the
[1:35:58] pillar of fire. What made diff what was
[1:36:01] the Sam Samson's difference? It was that
[1:36:03] hair that he possessed which was his
[1:36:06] Nazerite vow and the difference between
[1:36:08] this bride and the rest of the world is
[1:36:10] the mark of the seal of God. There's two
[1:36:14] marks you know like in that Jubilee
[1:36:16] those that would reject the gospel
[1:36:18] trumpet sounding would take a marker in
[1:36:21] their ear that they would not hear amen
[1:36:23] the word any longer but they would be
[1:36:25] deaf into it. But brother Bram said,
[1:36:27] "God marks his when they come. God marks
[1:36:30] his by vindicating his promised word
[1:36:33] through them." That's exactly St. John
[1:36:35] 14:12. And another thing you want to put
[1:36:38] down, Mark 16, Jesus said, "These signs
[1:36:40] shall follow them that believed him. And
[1:36:42] there's two marks. There's the mark of
[1:36:44] the beast and the seal of God." Oh, and
[1:36:47] it was the mark of the token that would
[1:36:49] make the difference. Right. Amen. You
[1:36:52] said God, brother Bram said that he made
[1:36:55] a preparation. What did he do the first
[1:36:57] time? He never changes his order. Now,
[1:37:00] that's important because if you could
[1:37:02] ever find the order of God, you know,
[1:37:04] brother Shane, God never changes that
[1:37:07] order. And he said the first time when
[1:37:09] he got when he made his preparation, he
[1:37:11] sent a prophet with a
[1:37:13] message. The first thing he done to the
[1:37:15] people, he sent a prophet with a
[1:37:16] message. The next thing he done to
[1:37:18] identify this prophet, he sent a pillar
[1:37:21] of fire for identification to identify
[1:37:23] it. And the next thing he sent was the
[1:37:27] token. There's God's order. Prophet
[1:37:30] vindication token. Amen. And and and I
[1:37:34] don't remember if I read this last time,
[1:37:35] but when Brother Brand's talking about
[1:37:37] how Moses got to the Red Sea and Moses
[1:37:39] would begin to command the people, stand
[1:37:41] still. I mean, and and you'll see the
[1:37:43] salvation of the Lord. Don't don't cry.
[1:37:45] Ye need not fight in this battle. The
[1:37:46] Lord shall fight for you. And brother
[1:37:48] Brandham's saying follow instruction,
[1:37:50] not the emotion. Because if they were
[1:37:53] follow the emotion, they would have been
[1:37:54] running around the banks of that Red Sea
[1:37:56] wondering how shall we escape and how
[1:37:59] shall we do this? But he's saying follow
[1:38:01] instruction, not emotion. And so when
[1:38:03] God is making preparation, he has an
[1:38:06] order. And he sends a vindicated prophet
[1:38:09] into the land because God, his word only
[1:38:12] comes through a prophet. And so when he
[1:38:15] sends a prophet and that prophet begins
[1:38:17] to instruct a people on how to escape.
[1:38:21] Amen. Then we're not following our
[1:38:23] emotion because it would have been a
[1:38:25] very scary time I'm sure for the
[1:38:27] firstborn son to say, "Daddy, are you
[1:38:29] sure? Daddy, are you sure?" Amen. That
[1:38:32] we're going to be okay. Daddy, are you
[1:38:34] positive that we're going to be safe?
[1:38:36] And he would say, "Yes, son. This was
[1:38:39] according to thus sayaeth the Lord. This
[1:38:41] was according to what the prophet told
[1:38:43] us. And and as a man, as a human,
[1:38:46] sometimes I have trouble making
[1:38:47] decisions. It's not always my strong
[1:38:50] suit. My mother-in-law got me a sign. I
[1:38:53] I have it at my work that says, "I I
[1:38:56] used to think I was or I I used to think
[1:38:59] I was indecisive, but now I'm not sure."
[1:39:03] So, and that's about how I am sometimes.
[1:39:06] I I I it's hard for me sometimes to pull
[1:39:09] the plug on something because I wonder,
[1:39:10] well, is that really the right decision
[1:39:12] or not? And you wonder and you toss and
[1:39:14] fro. But when you're under a prophet,
[1:39:16] you don't have to do that. I mean,
[1:39:18] because he already gave us the
[1:39:20] instructions and all we have to do is
[1:39:23] follow it. I mean, we don't have to
[1:39:24] wonder, well, is this the right
[1:39:25] decision? Am I doing the right thing? I
[1:39:27] mean, if it's the instructions of a
[1:39:29] vindicated prophet, then you have, thus
[1:39:31] sayeth the Lord, you're doing the right
[1:39:33] thing. And you can let off the pressure
[1:39:35] because you've met the requirement of
[1:39:38] the hour. You don't have to be
[1:39:40] uncertain. And here stood our prophet.
[1:39:42] And and I think it's so powerful. Amen.
[1:39:45] The day that we're living in because if
[1:39:47] you look at the parallel of Moses and
[1:39:49] brother Brandham, you see how they both
[1:39:51] had a supernatural birth. You see how
[1:39:53] they both got their commission from a an
[1:39:55] angel. You see how they both, Amen, had
[1:39:58] a standing in the gap experience. You
[1:40:00] see how they both had two signs. You see
[1:40:02] the parallels. But now Moses is coming
[1:40:05] to his token time. And brother Brandham
[1:40:09] says in the token speaking about Moses,
[1:40:12] I believe it he's saying, "Then the
[1:40:14] prophet said, I have heard from God
[1:40:16] there will be a token and you put the
[1:40:18] blood upon the door. Slay the lamb. Put
[1:40:20] the blood upon the door and that'll be a
[1:40:22] token because death is fixing to
[1:40:24] strike." And then he says, "Let me tell
[1:40:27] you today as his servant, unless the
[1:40:30] token is on the door, there is a
[1:40:33] spiritual death going to strike." I I I
[1:40:35] I may be crazy, but I don't believe
[1:40:37] Brother Brandon was just preaching about
[1:40:40] Moses. But brother Brandon was standing
[1:40:42] as Moses stood. Moses was only the type
[1:40:46] of what was happening in this age. And
[1:40:48] there brother Brandham I'm standing
[1:40:50] saying so say I onto you that this is
[1:40:53] the time where the token must be
[1:40:54] applied. Amen. That was the token then
[1:40:57] but this was the token now. It it wasn't
[1:41:00] just preaching about the token but this
[1:41:02] was the the fullness the the antitype of
[1:41:06] what was typed back there in the book of
[1:41:08] Exodus. And brother Brandham said we've
[1:41:10] been given a token which is an antitype
[1:41:12] of that type of that natural token.
[1:41:15] We've been given the supernatural
[1:41:18] supreme token. All that that
[1:41:21] foreshadowed has been given to this
[1:41:24] generation that has been given the
[1:41:26] token. Now we have the Holy Ghost as our
[1:41:29] token. You see, brother Brandham
[1:41:30] preached the token four times. And then
[1:41:32] he he preached desperation after the
[1:41:34] first one. And he begins to explain what
[1:41:36] the token was. He begin to explain that
[1:41:38] the token would be the sign that the
[1:41:40] blood was applied. He begins to show us.
[1:41:43] And brother Brandham said this is I
[1:41:45] believe with all the message that I ever
[1:41:47] brought that absolute was ordained of
[1:41:51] God outside of of course the regular
[1:41:53] commission like the seven seals and
[1:41:55] things. This was directly the word of
[1:41:58] God that was directly the word of God.
[1:42:00] I'm talking about a message to preach. I
[1:42:02] believe that was the one that's needed
[1:42:04] to follow those seven seals. He said
[1:42:07] this was uh he said this morning message
[1:42:09] was to me the highlight message of my
[1:42:12] entire ministry. He said that was the
[1:42:14] capping off time. He said now the same
[1:42:17] thing about this token. We've talked
[1:42:19] about the we've talked to the token all
[1:42:21] the way along in desperations. He said
[1:42:24] but now is the manifestation of the
[1:42:26] token. I mean you see what's happening.
[1:42:29] Brother Brandham standing here and he's
[1:42:31] come to a place in his ministry. Amen.
[1:42:34] where it's no longer, Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:42:37] Just a a preparation time, but it's
[1:42:40] coming to a token time. Brother Brandham
[1:42:42] said, "No other time could this type of
[1:42:45] a message ever happen. It could not have
[1:42:47] come in Luther's day. Couldn't have come
[1:42:49] in Wesley's day. Couldn't have come in
[1:42:51] Pentecostal day. It couldn't do it.
[1:42:53] There's been no such thing happened. And
[1:42:56] yet, we are promised in the Bible that
[1:42:57] we're at the end. Nothing could happen.
[1:42:59] It couldn't have happened till this
[1:43:01] time. And it's happening for a sign.
[1:43:03] wonder what is the sign. And then
[1:43:06] farther down, he said, "See, the hour
[1:43:08] sign is here. There's a token that's got
[1:43:10] to be applied. In no other time could it
[1:43:12] have come." Notice God's preparation for
[1:43:15] that time. We know what the Bible said.
[1:43:18] All those things happened. For
[1:43:20] examples, he said, he said, "You see to
[1:43:24] us, notice when God got ready to judge
[1:43:26] Egypt, first he made a
[1:43:28] preparation. Judgment was about ready to
[1:43:31] pour out on Egypt. But God had a prophet
[1:43:34] there to make preparation and he was
[1:43:37] instructing the people how to escape.
[1:43:40] And we had a prophet standing in this
[1:43:42] day saying judgment is coming. Those
[1:43:44] things happened for our example. And the
[1:43:48] prophet be to instruct a bride how to
[1:43:51] escape the judgment that were going to
[1:43:53] come because that token had to come in
[1:43:57] the evening time. Not in the morning.
[1:44:00] Not in the preparation. In the 14 days
[1:44:02] of the keeping of the lamb, Israel knows
[1:44:04] something was coming. Brother Brandham
[1:44:05] said the token never come into existence
[1:44:09] until the evening time. And this is the
[1:44:12] evening time of the age that we live in.
[1:44:15] This is the evening time for the church.
[1:44:17] This is the evening time for me. This is
[1:44:19] the evening time for me my message. I'm
[1:44:22] dying. I'm going. I'm moving out. In the
[1:44:25] evening time of the gospel, we've come
[1:44:27] up through justification and so forth.
[1:44:30] But this is the time that the token has
[1:44:33] got to be applied as they watch what
[1:44:36] come after those seven seals. Amen. This
[1:44:38] would be the one to follow the seven
[1:44:40] seals. Amen. Because God was calling a
[1:44:42] bride out of all of those denominational
[1:44:45] ages and saying, "Amen." Amen. It might
[1:44:49] have been good enough to join a church
[1:44:51] in that time. It might have been good
[1:44:53] enough to shout in that time. It might
[1:44:55] have been good enough just to live a
[1:44:57] sanctified life in that time. But this
[1:44:59] is token time. Amen. God is calling out
[1:45:02] a bride. The seals have been opened.
[1:45:05] Amen. The lamb. Amen. Come and took the
[1:45:08] book out of the hands. Who is worthy to
[1:45:10] take the book? And I looked and I saw a
[1:45:13] lamb as it was slain. Amen. Not just a
[1:45:17] lamb in a whole condition, but that lamb
[1:45:19] was slain. That Passover lamb was slain
[1:45:22] on Calvary. Amen. That his blood would
[1:45:24] be shed. that that life could return
[1:45:27] back upon a people that she might come
[1:45:30] under a token. Not just to talk about
[1:45:32] the token. They've looked for it for
[1:45:34] years and years, but this is it. I mean,
[1:45:36] brother Brand saying, "It's here. It's
[1:45:38] token time now." I mean, it might have
[1:45:41] been enough under the Pentecostal age
[1:45:43] just to get under a baptism in your
[1:45:45] spirit. But he's saying now, this token,
[1:45:48] it's the Holy Ghost himself. It's the
[1:45:51] life that you must get under. Amen.
[1:45:54] Brother Brandon could say you can have
[1:45:55] the baptism of the Holy Ghost every day
[1:45:58] of your life and go to hell. What's he
[1:46:00] speaking of? If it's just on your
[1:46:02] spirit, then you're you're under a
[1:46:04] circumcision. You're under a requirement
[1:46:06] of a past age. But the requirement of
[1:46:09] this age will be have a true baptism of
[1:46:13] the Holy Ghost which would be God coming
[1:46:16] into that gene seed and quickening that
[1:46:18] soul to life where the very person of
[1:46:21] Jesus Christ would inhabit a bride body.
[1:46:24] Amen. That the revealing of the son of
[1:46:26] man that God would reveal himself in a
[1:46:29] bride until they wouldn't just mean they
[1:46:32] wouldn't just be justified. They
[1:46:34] wouldn't just be sanctified. Oh, but a
[1:46:37] prophet could declare she is him. Amen.
[1:46:40] Life has returned. Amen. My ministry is
[1:46:43] to declare him. He is here. The
[1:46:45] requirement is changing. Amen. Like
[1:46:48] brother Bram said about Amen. They used
[1:46:50] to say speaking in tongues was the
[1:46:51] evidence. But brother Bram said, "No,
[1:46:54] it's not the evidence. It's just like
[1:46:55] when you go down to the store to buy a
[1:46:58] shoe." He said, "You don't just go and
[1:47:00] just buy the tongue." He said, "No, you
[1:47:02] buy the whole shoe and you get the
[1:47:05] tongue with it. Tongues wasn't the
[1:47:07] evidence. Amen. Amen. But the the
[1:47:10] evidence of the Holy Ghost in this age
[1:47:12] would be to receive the word for your
[1:47:14] day. Amen. There might have been a time
[1:47:16] where God just required Amen. this
[1:47:18] portion. There might have been a time
[1:47:20] where God just required the second
[1:47:22] portion, but now we have the whole shoe.
[1:47:25] And he's saying you got to have the
[1:47:27] whole shoe on if you want to be saved.
[1:47:29] And that's what the token was. He's
[1:47:31] saying there was a time where it was
[1:47:33] okay just to be justified. There was a
[1:47:35] time where it was okay just to be
[1:47:37] sanctified. But now, I mean, you must
[1:47:39] have the whole shoe on. Now, you must
[1:47:42] have the fullness of the Holy Ghost in
[1:47:45] your life if you want to escape. Amen.
[1:47:47] The judgments. Oh, you must escape into
[1:47:51] that blood. Oh, that lamb come. You know
[1:47:55] that Exodus Passover, that was the first
[1:47:58] Passover. That was the first communion.
[1:48:00] That was where the type was being laid
[1:48:03] out of a natural lamb that would be kept
[1:48:05] up, examined, and killed in the evening
[1:48:08] time before the congregation showing
[1:48:11] that the true lamb would come and he
[1:48:14] would come during the feast of Passover
[1:48:16] on a good Friday and he would be
[1:48:18] examined. And then before the
[1:48:20] congregation, Pilate and Caiaphas and
[1:48:23] these priests would examine the lamb and
[1:48:26] then they would kill him at evening time
[1:48:29] in front of the whole
[1:48:31] congregation showing that we were moving
[1:48:34] away from the lamb of the blood of a
[1:48:37] natural lamb. And we were moving into
[1:48:39] the supernatural blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:48:43] Oh, because the blood of a natural lamb
[1:48:46] couldn't return upon the people. That's
[1:48:48] why they were under a natural token.
[1:48:51] That's why they were under just the
[1:48:53] chemistry of the blood. That's why they
[1:48:55] had to apply the blood upon the door
[1:48:57] because the the life couldn't return
[1:48:59] upon him because the lamb didn't have a
[1:49:02] soul. Amen. But when our lamb came by
[1:49:06] one offering he entered in to forever
[1:49:09] perfect a bride. And brother Brandham
[1:49:11] said he was the king of souls. He wasn't
[1:49:14] just an ordinary man. the King of souls,
[1:49:18] the lamb of God, came to Calvary and
[1:49:21] shed his blood as it began to burst
[1:49:23] forth out of his being that this life
[1:49:27] could return upon the believer. That in
[1:49:30] this season, we wouldn't apply the
[1:49:32] physical blood of Jesus Christ, but the
[1:49:35] life of the blood would have to be
[1:49:37] applied upon a people that you could
[1:49:39] return. Amen. that this message I mean
[1:49:42] it went through a period where it was
[1:49:44] examined by the world and it was
[1:49:46] rejected in indictment and it was
[1:49:49] examined. I mean but there come a time
[1:49:51] where the prophet would come to the time
[1:49:53] in his ministry where it would be token
[1:49:56] time. He said oh I mean it is token
[1:49:59] time. Amen. We are not living under the
[1:50:03] preparation time anymore. It is time to
[1:50:07] get under the token. Not under the
[1:50:09] natural token. Oh, but it's time to get
[1:50:13] under. Amen. The life of Jesus Christ.
[1:50:17] Oh my. Oh my. There was a season where
[1:50:21] all that they could display was a
[1:50:23] natural blood. But in our season, we can
[1:50:26] display the full
[1:50:28] manifestation of the word of God. And
[1:50:31] I'll say this, what will you do with
[1:50:34] this Jesus called Christ? What will you
[1:50:37] do with this blood? I mean, if we can
[1:50:41] see the season we're living in, we can
[1:50:43] see that we have the life. We have the
[1:50:46] blood. And so, the question is, what
[1:50:48] will we do with that blood? Brother
[1:50:51] Brandham said, "He's on your hands. What
[1:50:53] are you going to do with him?" This
[1:50:55] Jesus called Christ. Christ is the
[1:50:57] anointed word. See, what are you going
[1:50:59] to do with it? It's the message of the
[1:51:01] hour. Brother Brandham spoke the token
[1:51:03] in 63 and he said, "We speak on this
[1:51:06] tomorrow night if it's possible and
[1:51:08] please the Lord, blood on the hands."
[1:51:11] You see, one night he was going to speak
[1:51:13] on blood on the door. And then the next
[1:51:15] night he said, "If it's possible, I'm
[1:51:17] going to speak on blood on the hands."
[1:51:19] He's saying, "Dallas, listen to reject
[1:51:22] the blood of Jesus Christ, the token of
[1:51:24] his blood. If you see it and reject it,
[1:51:26] you're going to face the judgment with
[1:51:29] his blood on your hands. Oh my. You're
[1:51:32] either going to have the blood on your
[1:51:34] door of your heart or you're going to
[1:51:36] meet him with blood on your hands. But I
[1:51:38] don't know about you, but I don't want
[1:51:40] to meet him with blood on my hands. I
[1:51:42] want to meet him with blood on my heart
[1:51:44] and clean hands. I want to meet him with
[1:51:46] clean hands and with a pure heart. So I
[1:51:49] say, God, if this is the applying time,
[1:51:52] if this is the season of the token, then
[1:51:55] Lord, give me I mean, if I had a natural
[1:51:58] jar, if you had a natural jar of the
[1:52:00] blood of Jesus Christ sitting here this
[1:52:02] morning, what would you do with it? I
[1:52:05] mean, what would you do with it? You'd
[1:52:07] probably call your family. You'd call
[1:52:09] your children. You'd say, "Come. I I
[1:52:12] I've got the blood. Come. We'll we'll
[1:52:14] sprinkle it upon you if you're sick.
[1:52:16] We'll sprinkle it upon you if you need
[1:52:19] saved. Amen. But we're not living under
[1:52:21] that season. But in this season, this
[1:52:24] blood would be a word of life. Oh, as
[1:52:28] John 6:63 said, "The words that I speak
[1:52:30] unto you, they are spirit and they are
[1:52:33] life." 2 Corinthians 3:6, "He hath made
[1:52:37] us able ministers of the New Testament,
[1:52:39] not of the letter, but of the spirit."
[1:52:41] Amen. Amen. If was Pet was Peter
[1:52:44] speaking a dead letter or was he
[1:52:46] speaking a a bloody word when it said
[1:52:49] while Peter yet spake these words the
[1:52:51] Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard
[1:52:53] the word. Amen. So you see this morning
[1:52:56] if I had a literal canister of the blood
[1:52:58] of Jesus Christ it wouldn't do me no
[1:53:01] good because that's not what we're
[1:53:02] living in. But we have amen bleeding
[1:53:06] word of life. Amen. To begin to apply to
[1:53:10] the children of God. So that's what I'm
[1:53:12] doing when I step up behind the sacred
[1:53:15] desk. I say, "Lord, give me clean hands.
[1:53:17] And Lord, give me a pure heart. And
[1:53:19] Lord, give me a bloody word that I could
[1:53:22] begin to preach a bloody word to your
[1:53:24] children." And it would be as if a spray
[1:53:27] of the blood of the lamb would be
[1:53:29] spraying across across the congregation
[1:53:32] saying, "Lord, save them. Lord, heal
[1:53:34] them. Lord, put them under this token.
[1:53:37] Lord, draw them unto yourself. We don't
[1:53:40] want to leave a hook behind. Lord, give
[1:53:42] me clean hands and give me a bloody
[1:53:44] word. And Lord, let me spray it across
[1:53:47] the congregation. Oh, because I know
[1:53:49] that the Bible says faith cometh by
[1:53:52] hearing and hearing of the word of God.
[1:53:55] And that's how this blood is applied.
[1:53:56] It's applied with hissup. And I know
[1:53:58] that if we can just preach this bleeding
[1:54:01] word, amen, hard enough and strong
[1:54:04] enough that there's going to be a
[1:54:05] mother, amen, that'll receive faith and
[1:54:08] grab her hiss up and say, "Lord, I'm
[1:54:10] applying it for my children. I'm
[1:54:12] applying it for my prodigal Lord." Amen.
[1:54:16] As we preach this bloody word, oh,
[1:54:19] people could begin to apply it for the
[1:54:21] Holy Ghost. People could begin to apply
[1:54:23] it for their healing. People could begin
[1:54:25] to apply it for their salvation. And I
[1:54:27] think it's time, Amen, to take the blood
[1:54:30] off of the shelf and begin to apply it
[1:54:32] over our homes. Brother Brand said it's
[1:54:34] applying time. Death is going to strike
[1:54:36] one of these days. Amen. But we are in a
[1:54:39] season where we have the blood. And I
[1:54:42] say, let's apply it. Let's apply it with
[1:54:44] faith. Amen. And we aren't applying it
[1:54:47] to a day gone by, but we are applying it
[1:54:50] under the instructions of a prophet. And
[1:54:53] the prophet instructed us that Jesus
[1:54:55] Christ is the same. yesterday, today,
[1:54:57] and forever. Amen. This word is not
[1:55:00] applied. Amen. Just off into the
[1:55:02] millennium or just off into some history
[1:55:05] book. But this blood is a present tense
[1:55:07] blood. Amen. Oh, you couldn't begin to
[1:55:10] call it present tense.
[1:55:12] Oh, it's a simple faith. It don't
[1:55:14] require some orchid. Brother Brandham
[1:55:16] said some great big workup complicated
[1:55:18] thing. It's a simple faith. You begin to
[1:55:20] claim it and say, "It's for me. It's for
[1:55:23] me. If it worked for brother Brandham,
[1:55:26] it'll work for me because I hold the
[1:55:27] same token and you begin to present that
[1:55:30] token. Oh, it's yours. You have a right
[1:55:34] to it. When you have that token, it's
[1:55:36] purchasing power. You know, there'll
[1:55:39] come a time in the tribulation. Amen.
[1:55:41] Where there will be a people and they
[1:55:43] won't be able to purchase because
[1:55:45] there's going to be a boycott. They
[1:55:47] won't be able to buy or sell unless they
[1:55:50] take on the mark of the beast. But you
[1:55:52] know what? The time that we are living
[1:55:54] in, it's a time where we won't be able
[1:55:57] to purchase without the token unless you
[1:56:00] get under the mark. You won't be able,
[1:56:03] amen, to purchase the promises of God.
[1:56:05] Because brother Brandham said, Amen.
[1:56:08] Because he is here, we have the right to
[1:56:11] all that he purchased for us. Notice
[1:56:13] what was the token to do to purchase.
[1:56:16] It's a price has been paid. When you
[1:56:18] have the token, you have a right to
[1:56:20] present that token to anything that he
[1:56:22] purchased for you. And brother Brandham
[1:56:24] said, "No one can buy without it. It can
[1:56:27] only be purchased by the token." Amen.
[1:56:30] You see, if you want to ride on the bus,
[1:56:32] you can't bribe this driver with a $20
[1:56:35] bill. He said, "You got to go through
[1:56:36] the blood and get the token. But if you
[1:56:39] get the token, I don't care if you're
[1:56:41] rich or you're poor. I don't care if
[1:56:43] you're ragged clothes or the best suit
[1:56:45] in the world. That driver cannot tell
[1:56:47] you that you're not allowed on that bus
[1:56:49] because you say, "I have the purchasing
[1:56:52] power of the token." And I'm going to
[1:56:54] tell you this morning, you cannot
[1:56:56] purchase a rapture without this token.
[1:56:58] You cannot purchase a mean a marriage
[1:57:01] supper without this token. You cannot
[1:57:03] purchase a mean thy and thy h believe in
[1:57:06] thy and thy house shall be saved. But
[1:57:08] that requires a believer because this
[1:57:11] word works for believers. Oh, those
[1:57:14] uncircumcised Philistines tried to
[1:57:15] follow the children of Israel through
[1:57:17] the Red Sea. But that promise didn't
[1:57:19] work for them because they weren't under
[1:57:21] the circumcision of the children of
[1:57:23] Israel. So, they were drowned in the Red
[1:57:25] Sea. And that's why this word works for
[1:57:27] you because you are under the covenant
[1:57:30] and you have the token in your hand and
[1:57:32] you can enter into God's great variety
[1:57:34] store and he already paid for
[1:57:36] everything. I mean, it's without money
[1:57:38] and without price. You don't have to
[1:57:41] purchase it. He already purchased it.
[1:57:43] All you have to do is accept the token
[1:57:45] by faith and be born again into the
[1:57:48] kingdom of God. And then you can walk
[1:57:50] into that variety store and say, "Hey,
[1:57:52] what am I going to purchase today? What
[1:57:54] am I going to get off the shelf today? I
[1:57:56] need healing, then purchase it. I need
[1:57:59] salvation, then purchase it. I need
[1:58:01] deliverance, then purchase it." And then
[1:58:04] present your token with your prayers and
[1:58:06] clean up your homes. Brother Brandham
[1:58:08] say you apply it and then you get the
[1:58:10] trash out of the house. I mean that's
[1:58:12] sometimes maybe that's the stage where
[1:58:15] we get to sometimes you're applying it.
[1:58:17] But if you're applying for the promise
[1:58:19] then make room for the promise to come
[1:58:22] and get the trash out of your homes and
[1:58:24] throw out the nonsense and throw out the
[1:58:27] makeup and the the addictions and the
[1:58:29] televisions and throw out all the
[1:58:30] nonsense and say, "Lord, I'm desperate.
[1:58:33] I'm desperate for my children. I'm
[1:58:35] desperate for my family. Lord. Oh, and
[1:58:37] you begin to believe that there's a
[1:58:39] living God who's able to meet the need
[1:58:42] because the word works for you because
[1:58:44] you and the word have become one and you
[1:58:47] operate as one with the word. You say,
[1:58:49] "Brother Isaac, what if I ask for the
[1:58:51] wrong thing?" Have Have you ever tried
[1:58:53] to force yourself to stick your hand in
[1:58:55] your fire in a in a fire? You and your
[1:58:57] hand are one, right? Amen. But but it's
[1:59:00] going to be very hard for you to
[1:59:01] override your brain and just to stick
[1:59:04] your hand in a fire just to show that
[1:59:05] you can do it. It you're not just going
[1:59:08] to stick your hand in a fire just to
[1:59:09] show that you can do it. It's going to
[1:59:11] be very hard for you. But let's say you
[1:59:13] your your your child runs into that
[1:59:15] fire. You're not even going to give it a
[1:59:17] second thought. Your hand will reach in
[1:59:19] and grab that child out of the fire. And
[1:59:21] that's what brother Brandham's saying.
[1:59:23] You and the word have become one. And
[1:59:25] you're not just going to exercise your
[1:59:27] power just to show that you can do it.
[1:59:30] But if your child and begins to run away
[1:59:32] from the Lord, you won't think twice
[1:59:34] about it. But you'll grab that token and
[1:59:36] you say, "Lord, I'm going after my
[1:59:38] child. I'm going after my joy. I'm going
[1:59:41] after my peace. I'm going after my
[1:59:43] inheritance. Lord, I've lost it, but you
[1:59:46] gave me the ability to purchase." Amen.
[1:59:50] If you believe, all things are possible
[1:59:52] to them that believe. speak to this
[1:59:54] mountain and it shall be moved. Ask and
[1:59:56] you shall receive. Seek and you shall
[1:59:58] find. Knock and it shall be open unto
[1:59:59] you. Oh, we've seen we've seen where
[2:00:03] they let them into the
[2:00:05] stores and they give them what's called
[2:00:07] a shopping spree and for 5 minutes
[2:00:10] they'll run like chickens with their
[2:00:11] head cut off to fill their
[2:00:14] carts as full as they can with the most
[2:00:17] expensive things. But you know what?
[2:00:19] We've been given 247 access to this
[2:00:22] whole variety store.
[2:00:24] And I say, what are we doing with this
[2:00:28] blood? What are we doing with this
[2:00:30] hissup in our hand? What are we doing
[2:00:33] with the instructions of a prophet to
[2:00:37] say, "This is what you can do. This is
[2:00:40] what you have access
[2:00:41] to." Oh
[2:00:43] my. What an hour to be alive. Amen. It's
[2:00:47] it's token time.
[2:00:49] It's applying time. It's evening time.
[2:00:52] And I know it's dark. And I know there's
[2:00:55] famine in the land. And I know that
[2:00:57] there's death in the land. Oh, but we
[2:01:00] heard a prophet cry out, "It shall be
[2:01:03] light. How about the evening time?"
[2:01:07] Oh, those that are gathered in that
[2:01:09] secret place in that
[2:01:11] ocean said, "It shall be light about the
[2:01:13] evening time." At the evening
[2:01:16] time, oh, God would manifest his
[2:01:19] resurrection like he did to his
[2:01:21] disciples. He didn't do it in the
[2:01:23] morning, but at evening time, he began
[2:01:25] to reveal himself to him. It was at
[2:01:28] evening time when
[2:01:30] Eleazar would meet Rebecca at a well and
[2:01:34] begin to draw her to the waters of life
[2:01:38] and reveal to her the revelations. It
[2:01:41] was at evening time that Isaac would see
[2:01:45] Rebecca coming across that field. It was
[2:01:46] at evening time when the son of man
[2:01:49] would be revealed. It was at evening
[2:01:51] time when the same sun that rose in the
[2:01:54] east would set in the west. It was at
[2:01:57] evening time, oh when God would say,
[2:02:01] "We've looked for it." Or God that that
[2:02:04] the whole world groans for the
[2:02:05] manifestation of the sons and God.
[2:02:07] They've looked for it and looked for it.
[2:02:09] But at evening time, sons of God would
[2:02:12] be manifested. At evening time, they've
[2:02:15] looked for the token and looked for it.
[2:02:16] But at evening time, the token would be
[2:02:19] here. It'd be at evening time. I think
[2:02:21] it's a powerful thing to
[2:02:23] recognize not only the requirements of
[2:02:27] your season. You first you got to
[2:02:28] recognize your season. We're in the
[2:02:30] season of evening time. And you
[2:02:32] recognize the requirement of your
[2:02:34] season. It's a greater requirement than
[2:02:37] any age. For where much is given, much
[2:02:39] is required. And God's going to require
[2:02:41] more of this age than any other
[2:02:44] age. He's going to require perfection
[2:02:46] because those in Hebrews 11 said, "They
[2:02:48] without us cannot be made perfect." And
[2:02:50] God would require that capstone life,
[2:02:53] that
[2:02:54] perfection. But not only do we recognize
[2:02:56] the requirements of our age, but we
[2:02:58] recognize the blessings of our season.
[2:03:02] That this is a season where a Hatty
[2:03:04] Wright could say that's nothing but the
[2:03:06] truth. and it could be unlocked to her
[2:03:10] salvation for her two boys. This is a
[2:03:12] season in the evening time, just like in
[2:03:15] the evening time of Moses ministry,
[2:03:17] there could become a creation and a
[2:03:19] taking
[2:03:20] away. In our evening time, we've seen
[2:03:22] God come down and speak squirrels into
[2:03:24] existence and speak storms out of
[2:03:27] existence. It's it's evening time and
[2:03:30] it's a time where I believe all things
[2:03:33] are possible. I believe it's a time for
[2:03:35] us to claim our rights. Amen. It's a
[2:03:38] time. It's a token
[2:03:40] time. As the musicians
[2:03:43] come, Amen. It's a desperate time.
[2:03:47] But it's not a hopeless time. We're not
[2:03:49] left without a a token. There's there's
[2:03:52] still a blood. Oh, one
[2:03:55] day that last one will come
[2:03:58] in. Oh, and this bride will be taken up.
[2:04:02] It's been typed, but one day it'll be
[2:04:05] manifested. Oh, but while there's yet
[2:04:07] blood in the bucket to
[2:04:09] [Music]
[2:04:11] apply, Brother Bram said, "I'm asking
[2:04:13] you as an
[2:04:15] individual, what do you do with the
[2:04:17] blood of Jesus Christ? What will we do
[2:04:20] with this anointed word of God that's
[2:04:22] right before us today that we know is to
[2:04:24] be the Christ, the promise of the hour?
[2:04:27] What will you do with it?
[2:04:31] What will you do with it with every head
[2:04:32] bowed, every eye
[2:04:34] closed? Brother Bram said, I feel it in
[2:04:38] your
[2:04:39] minds. You see, why will I know? How
[2:04:42] will I know? The tokens applied. Brother
[2:04:44] Bram said, look, what were you and what
[2:04:47] are you? There's how you know. See, what
[2:04:50] was you before this token was applied?
[2:04:53] What is you after it's applied? What was
[2:04:55] your desires before? What is your
[2:04:58] desires after?
[2:05:00] Then you know whether the token is
[2:05:01] applied or not and these other things
[2:05:02] just automatically go with
[2:05:04] that. You see that's one thing the token
[2:05:07] means. It means assurance. Brother
[2:05:09] Brandham said next thing after next
[2:05:11] thing was he sent a prophet. He
[2:05:12] vindicated it. Then brother Bram said
[2:05:14] the next thing was after that was a
[2:05:17] consolation. You knew it was right. You
[2:05:20] was at peace. Brother Brham said in the
[2:05:22] token oh what a positive
[2:05:25] token. There cannot be any more token.
[2:05:28] He said, "If you could only catch the
[2:05:30] thought of it, if I had the power this
[2:05:32] morning with words to express and place
[2:05:34] into your soul that's on the not your
[2:05:36] ears, but your soul and you could see
[2:05:39] the guarantee of it." He said, "It takes
[2:05:42] he said it makes you so
[2:05:44] relaxed. It makes you so
[2:05:47] relaxed." Oh, if you can realize you're
[2:05:49] under the token like that little boy
[2:05:51] could say, "Daddy, are you positive?
[2:05:54] Daddy, are you sure?" Could say, "Yes,
[2:05:56] son. We followed the instructions of a
[2:06:00] prophet. I'm sure it's a positive token.
[2:06:04] And when you have that token, it's the
[2:06:05] assurance of rapture. It's the assurance
[2:06:08] of resurrection.
[2:06:11] Like sometimes in
[2:06:12] those those those talent competitions,
[2:06:16] if they're really good, they'll give
[2:06:18] them a a buzzer and they'll be able to
[2:06:20] bypass and go into the into the final
[2:06:24] rounds because the judge granted them a
[2:06:28] pass. Oh my. And this token, it's a free
[2:06:32] pass. It's a free pass. We won't have to
[2:06:35] go through the rounds of tribulation. We
[2:06:37] won't have to go through the rounds of
[2:06:38] judgment. But he'll pass over us and
[2:06:41] we'll be able to go straight and escape
[2:06:44] those rounds and go straight to the
[2:06:45] marriage supper, go straight to the body
[2:06:48] change, go straight to the
[2:06:50] millennium. Oh, it's a free pass this
[2:06:52] morning. And if you have it, you can let
[2:06:55] off the pressure. And if you have it and
[2:06:58] you're safe, then you can begin to apply
[2:07:00] it for your children. Begin to apply it
[2:07:02] for your loved ones. Begin to apply it
[2:07:04] for your joy, for your your family. It's
[2:07:07] not meant to be a secret thing. It's
[2:07:09] meant to be on public display like
[2:07:10] Rahab's scarlet cord. It's meant to be
[2:07:13] on the lentil in the doorpost of your
[2:07:15] heart that everyone might see. Amen.
[2:07:18] That the token is applied. Amen. That
[2:07:20] everyone might see. And I want the world
[2:07:22] to see this morning that I believe this
[2:07:25] message of the hour. I want the world to
[2:07:27] see this morning that this brother
[2:07:29] Brandham, this messenger, I mean, he
[2:07:31] came from God as a seventh angel and
[2:07:33] it's nothing but the truth. I want the
[2:07:36] world to see that. I believe, amen, for
[2:07:39] my wife. I believe for my son. I believe
[2:07:42] for my loved ones. I believe, amen, that
[2:07:44] God has a bride and I'm a part of that
[2:07:47] bride. I believe I'm going out to
[2:07:49] purchase a refilling of the Holy Ghost.
[2:07:52] I'm presenting my token right now with
[2:07:55] my prayer. Lord, you said that we could
[2:07:58] ask that our joys might be full. Lord,
[2:08:00] that we don't have to just ask and live
[2:08:03] in a life of mediocrity, but we can ask
[2:08:05] for our loved ones. We can ask for joy
[2:08:08] unspeakable. We can ask for a peace that
[2:08:10] passes all understanding. We can ask to
[2:08:13] know that we know that we know that
[2:08:14] we're safe from the judgments. We can
[2:08:16] ask, Lord, and believe that the mountain
[2:08:18] that's in our way will have to be moved,
[2:08:20] Lord. We can ask. We can purchase, Lord,
[2:08:23] because you've given us purchasing power
[2:08:25] and said, "Come into my variety store
[2:08:27] and purchase anything you have need of."
[2:08:29] And Father, maybe there's a maybe
[2:08:32] there's one in this building this
[2:08:33] morning that feels like they fell in the
[2:08:37] fires, Lord. But Father, Lord, as as a
[2:08:40] body, Lord, we go after those lost
[2:08:43] lambs. And Father, we say, Lord, as you
[2:08:46] extended your arm to Peter as he be to
[2:08:48] sink in the waves, Lord, it was a
[2:08:50] desperate time for Peter, but in
[2:08:52] desperation, he cried out and the hand
[2:08:54] reached out and pulled him out of the
[2:08:56] waters. And Father, we're crying out in
[2:08:58] desperation, Lord. I pray if there's one
[2:09:00] in here without the token this morning,
[2:09:02] Lord, that they wouldn't leave here
[2:09:04] without receiving, Lord, the fullness of
[2:09:06] the baptism of your spirit. Lord, that
[2:09:08] if there's one in here that's got a
[2:09:10] wayward child, Father, we are sending
[2:09:13] out the promise for that child. We're
[2:09:16] we're claiming them, Lord. We're
[2:09:18] purchasing them, Father. Lord, we're
[2:09:20] setting a table for him, Lord. We're
[2:09:22] believing that all things are possible,
[2:09:24] Father. And if you said that we could
[2:09:26] purchase it, then Father, we're going to
[2:09:28] break out, Lord, the checkbook tonight,
[2:09:30] this morning. Lord, we are not under an
[2:09:34] empty bank. But Lord, you would bankrupt
[2:09:36] heaven to fulfill your word. And Father,
[2:09:39] we're going to start writing the checks.
[2:09:41] Lord, I don't believe it's a time to
[2:09:43] leave the the hissup in the bucket on
[2:09:46] the shelf, but Lord, I believe it's time
[2:09:48] to take it off the shelf. It's the
[2:09:50] season for it, Lord. It's the season for
[2:09:52] the manifestation of sons of God. It's
[2:09:55] the season of adoption. It's the season
[2:09:57] of the token. Lord, I believe it's the
[2:09:59] season where prodigals are going to come
[2:10:01] home. I believe it's the season where
[2:10:03] missing lens can be restored. We
[2:10:05] recognize our season, Lord. We recognize
[2:10:08] our season.
[2:10:10] Oh, I pray every son and daughter, God,
[2:10:12] in this building, even those on the
[2:10:15] stream, Father, Lord, that they would
[2:10:17] begin to apply this token and clean up
[2:10:19] their homes, Father, and clean up their
[2:10:21] lives and believe that you're a living
[2:10:25] God with living signs and living
[2:10:30] wonders. Oh Jesus, we don't want to
[2:10:33] apply it to somebody else, Lord. We want
[2:10:36] to apply it to ourselves. Father, what
[2:10:38] good is our faith if we don't put it
[2:10:40] into action? But Lord, I believe that if
[2:10:43] it worked for Brother Brandham, it'll
[2:10:44] work for me. If it worked for Brother
[2:10:47] Samuel, it'll work for
[2:10:49] me because it's the same blood, the same
[2:10:52] token. I pray you grant every desire of
[2:10:55] the hearts this morning. Lord, may we
[2:10:57] not complicate it, Father. try to reach
[2:11:00] out and build up some great big pressure
[2:11:02] of faith. But Lord, in the simplicity of
[2:11:06] taking at your word, just say, "Lord, I
[2:11:08] accept it." That's how we apply the
[2:11:10] blood in this day. It's not, Lord, by a
[2:11:13] a a a natural brush. We apply this blood
[2:11:16] by accepting it, Lord, that it would be
[2:11:19] applied to our
[2:11:21] hearts, cleaning up, Lord, making
[2:11:24] room for the promise to be fulfilled.
[2:11:28] Thank you for it, Father. We commit him
[2:11:31] into your hands in Jesus
[2:11:33] name. Oh yes. Amen. As the brother
[2:11:36] sings, oh, why don't you just go to
[2:11:38] applying the
[2:11:40] word? Oh, we love you
[2:11:43] saints. We love you saints.
[2:11:48] [Music]
[2:11:53] Hallelujah. Oh spirit, come make us
[2:11:56] humble.
[2:12:00] We turn our
[2:12:03] eyes from evil
[2:12:07] things. Oh Lord, we cast down our
[2:12:11] idols. Give us clean
[2:12:15] hands. Give us pure
[2:12:19] hearts. Let us not lift our souls to one
[2:12:24] another.
[2:12:26] Give us clean

[2:13:19] knees. Oh spirit, come make us
[2:13:22] [Music]

[2:13:29] eyes from evil
[2:13:33] things, Lord. We cast down our
[2:13:37] idols. Give us clean
[2:13:40] hands. Give us pure hearts.
[2:13:45] Let us not lift our souls to
[2:13:50] another. Give us clean
[2:13:54] hands. Give us pure
[2:13:58] hearts. Let us not lift our souls to one
[2:14:04] another. God, let us be a
[2:14:08] generation that
[2:14:11] seeks your face.
[2:14:14] Oh God of
[2:14:17] Jacob, come let us be a
[2:14:22] generation that
[2:14:25] sees your
[2:14:27] face. Oh God of
[2:14:31] Jacob, God let us be a
[2:14:35] generation that
[2:14:38] sees seeks your face. Oh God of
[2:14:44] [Music]
[2:14:45] Jacob, come let us be a
[2:14:49] generation that
[2:14:52] sees

[2:15:15] Moses, told him what to
[2:15:20] say to the children of
[2:15:25] Israel in goion that
[2:15:30] day. Stand take the
[2:15:35] blood. Strike the post and the door.
[2:15:41] from pass through each of the
[2:15:45] night and smile all the

[2:15:55] let
[2:16:00] God in the
[2:16:02] [Music]

[2:16:12] Oh

[2:16:16] hallelujah and glory to
[2:16:19] [Applause]
[2:16:21] God. The blood of his spirit rise that
[2:16:27] the death
[2:16:29] angel make. Yes. The sweet Holy
[2:16:36] Spirit is the token
[2:16:41] today. And all that are under it.
[2:16:47] Oh, God said will be
[2:16:51] saved. Yes. Outside of his
[2:16:57] story will be
[2:17:01] found. Oh, if you want your
[2:17:05] love, keep on praying. You better get
