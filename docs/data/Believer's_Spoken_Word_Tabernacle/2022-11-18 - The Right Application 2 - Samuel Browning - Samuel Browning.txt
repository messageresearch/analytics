in prayer here brother Stephen West asked me just to pass this along to you regarding his mother she's been he just he texts me here about an hour ago and let me know that his mother is she just had had a heart surgery bypass surgery here just on yesterday and he just said that they have the balloon they've removed from her heart she's up drinking juices and water she's doing very good so he asked me to thank you for your prayers continue we just want to continue to keep sister in prayer the Lord will just continue to move for her in a special way and I know there's many different many different needs that are among us as well and other needs too and I'm just so thankful God's mindful of every need amen whether it's spoken or it's unspoken God's mindful of it yeah I tell you I'm just so thankful that before anything could ever arise or anything take place I'm grateful that he's already got everything covered aren't you he's got it all covered you find that every time that there was the um a situation arose God used the situation as an opportunity to just make himself known in a greater way and the situations would never be situations that we in our Humanity would choose but God knows in His Infinite Wisdom and each time you find when Israel would come into a situation God was not without an answer for that but he would reveal another one of his compound Redemptive names and he would make himself known I'm God in this situation and God right here right now and I'm just thankful for that because we know all of that it spoke of the Lord Jesus Christ and to know that no matter what the situation is God's got it covered got it covered he's not far off somewhere he's right here with us I just say Lord I want to draw nigh to him I want my thoughts I want my mind I want my heart I want everything to draw nigh to him just to welcome him like the songs that we were just singing here I just want to set at your feet Lord and like that of el Shady eye I just want to want to draw from you Lord Abraham says it's not it's not the milk from the breast that actually brings the calming to the baby it's hearing that heartbeat and that's what that's what it is getting close to God and draw nine to God and it's just it's hearing him amen aren't you grateful amen I'm glad that God's made a way for us amen let's just go to the Lord in a word of prayer before we open the word Heavenly Father Lord we are standing here this evening Lord what an opportunity Lord that we have and you've given to us Lord that God in the midst of this in Time Lord that we're living how we thank you Lord for your grace Lord that God not only as you would send the promise of the evening light but oh God that we would be partakers of that Grace Lord in this hour Lord and father that's the Lord and we are so grateful because the Lord if Grace is removed from the equation then we don't have a chance whatsoever Lord but we're thankful God for your grace that comes Lord Upon Our Lives to correct us to teach us to lead us to fill us to deliver us Lord oh God we are just so thankful for the grace of God and Lord Jesus we just asked tonight Lord that you'll just draw near to us Lord our desire Lord is the songs of Zion have been sung and we've come Lord and we've gathered the sacrifice Lord has been made Lord together in your presence Lord to lay aside all of the cares and the toils of life and even as we've entered into this place tonight Lord to even lay aside those thoughts of our mind or thoughts Lord that are oppressive to us the Lord or depressive Lord we just lay them aside at your feet Lord we cast all our care upon you for you care for us Lord and we just the Lord Jesus stand here tonight Lord oh God in need of your touch Lord we need to hear from you once again Lord but God just a word from you Lord would mean more Lord than countless words that could be spoken Lord so we ask that God that you'll just reserve us the Lord that it might be just you that would speak what is necessary Lord and guide us the Lord in the pathways Lord that you see that's needful for us as your children Lord for we lord stand here o God like eaglets Lord waiting on the great Jehovah jeego to move town the Lord with nourishment Lord in our hearts and our lives oh God we are waiting upon you Lord for the Lord is we will wait upon you Lord then Lord we receive a renewal Lord of strength and refreshment Lord and we will Mount up with wings as an eagle Lord because Lord of your goodness Lord oh Father we look to you tonight Lord may you just move for every need Lord thank you Father for the Deliverance Lord for brother Stephen's mother Lord and we ask that God you would continue to minister to her Lord and strengthen her Lord in her body Lord I pray o God for the different needs and the assembly Lord God oh Father different ones the Lord that Lord are in need of your touch Lord we ask that God you'll go right to them Lord we pray father we just invite you Lord we lord we believe we know that Lord you are here Lord how we sense your presence oh God and we just submit ourselves Lord God that you would just take control in every part lord of the service Lord in Jesus precious name Hallelujah Hallelujah glory be to God Hallelujah let's turn in our Bibles to First Peter chapter 4. in verse 12. this is a familiar scripture to us I just want to ask you to be in prayer Lord willing early tomorrow morning I leave out for Canada for the weekend and then I'll be back here in on I think our flights are supposed to my flight's supposed to come back in early on Monday I just ask that you'd just be in prayer for that God give us just safe traveling Mercies to be with brother Ivan Carr brother Carmen Mills and we're just going there just to minister to them the saints that are there so we just just covet your prayers and just for the meetings and secondarily I would ask that I would have just the flights you know I sometimes I don't like the layovers you have them but I don't when it comes to sometimes there's been situations where they'll come to me and say oh sorry we're not going to be able to get on that flight and that's a I said no no no no no no no no no I gotta get back I gotta get back and you know sometimes God in His Grace has allowed situations to where we are able to get on a flight somewhere like the last time I was coming back out of Texas and you know it just to me is no place like home and uh and when I say home I'm not just talking about my house I'm talking about you all I'm not just talking about my house if if it wasn't for you all and the burden that God is placing my heart well then what what would what would home be what would home be and so let's look here just real quick in verse 12 of First Peter chapter 4 verse 12. beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened to you but rejoice inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings how many can say Lord I need help but Rejoice I got both of my hands up I need help Lord because you see there's a part of me now understand this there's a part of me just like there is of you that my flesh does not want to Rejoice nor does it ever welcome test or trials is that right but here once that part when we can recognize where we're our standing is with God then that's where we can Rejoice because you realize you cannot lose with the Lord so our rejoicing is not about the test or the trial but our rejoicing is we cannot lose with God Amen in as much as you are partakers of Christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding Joy may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I'd like also to refer to another scripture here that we're familiar with in an earlier part of Peter where Peter would speak from verse 6 and he would deal with what we are the direction of where we are headed because we are we are headed we know where we're standing in this hour we are looking right here for rapture and we are this is an age and a moment that we are promised that so we are greatly rejoicing in that we know not just the promise of the Rapture but we know in whom we have believed as the Saints of all ages because this scripture was written to all of the Believers there of all ages but to think of where we are standing in this moment just as much as the Believers before us there is a certainty about our heart and our life and that's what I pray is with every life tonight wherein you greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire and might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ whom having not seen ye love in whom though now you see him not yet believing ye Rejoice with joy and speak of herbal and full of Glory so nowhere is the trial joyous nowhere is the test joyous now I know I'm speaking to you because I've talked to some of you back there I've talked to people on the phone and I know right now there's not one Angel setting in here tonight because you ain't you ain't never going to be an angel you are intended to be a human right and we know how when things come about on our lives no matter how long we've been serving God now it's always easy when we can look at somebody else and see something and I don't want to just say that it's it's easy but you know it's it's it does US good to remember of where God and the God's comfort and his care and how he has brought us through you know sometimes we don't know with circumstances and situations and we can maybe look at somebody who's sick or who's suffering and we can just tell them you need to have faith in God you need to believe but let's turn the table what about when you're sick let's turn the table let's just come and let's preach at you and say have faith you just need to have faith but don't put that Tylenol bottle down you just need to have faith what's wrong with you let's turn the tables you see sometimes this is why listen that even when sickness and trials and things comes our way God knows what he's doing to temper and move out Pride that can get stuck in our life let me just tell you our first birth is a product of Pride and reasoning and there is always a battle against Pride is that right there's always it and that's why even Paul could say lest I would become exalted above the abundance of the revelation God has seen that I need Divine assistance to keep myself in a place where he can reveal more to me aren't you glad for divine assistance I'm so thankful even though God entrust you and I that we would keep our lives in such a place but God says I know the weakness of humanity God doesn't have question of his life or the strength within us but God knows that you and I what we have need of at different times that will cause us to keep looking up and be in a place where he can use us I'm grateful for that aren't you I'm not grateful for the test or the trial per se as far as everything that goes on around but I'm grateful for his grace that carries us through now notice brother Brown would say it like this in the Ephesian Church age this is just one of the statements that brother Brandon would make and you know this regarding tests and trials persecution and trials are a natural normal part of the Christian Life there is only one thing you can do about them commit them all to God judge not and leave their outworking and final judgment to him oh I'm grateful that means that I don't have to figure out what's going on I can just commit it to him my God that's not entrusted you nor me that we would have to understand if we understand then why do we need faith but we didn't we don't we walk we trust in the Lord now I want to just continue to deal with this thought here just a moment on the right application and you know we could go on and on with this part of it we looked at it last week how that many of job's uh friends that came to him the things that they were expressing job was able to say to them over and over I know the things that you're saying I know them I'm not inferior to you I know these things that you are rehearsing but job was standing there and realizing these guys are like eye surgeons trying to perform heart surgery it ain't applying to the situation that's why Joe could say over and over they are not giving an answer even when Ella who would come and rebuke them along with job and he would rebuke them because they were not giving an answer or the right application now there's many examples that I could give here tonight as things that the Lord just bring into my heart even last week before I spoke of things that we could see even in the message and perhaps here in one of the services we'll get into it that we can see what a blessing it is that when the right application comes and understanding opens to a heart that is wandering and maybe thinking something a certain way let me just give you one remember on deep calls to the Deep the sister that comes up there and she comes up and brother Brian says oh he says I I see you said uh oh he says there's a darkness that that's following it wasn't any darkness in her but he says what it was it was a lying Spirit she wasn't a liar but what it was there was a man professing to be a Divine healer that had called her out and called her a witch it wasn't true but because she got to entertaining that now brother Ben said from that one thing he says it has affected the church he said it's even caused a sickness within your pastor now I can preach on that for a little bit right there there's no doubt that the you know we don't know all that was going on but what was happening the wrong application was bringing that disturbance but the right application brings freedom the right application brings Liberty remember like we looked at last week if you just had the blood of the Lamb you wasn't complying it right it had to be applied upon the door pose and upon the lentils of the door it had to be applied in the right way and when it was applied then there was Liberty then there was security we could really look at the blood without fear are you hearing me now yeah yeah all of the word of God remember the word became blood the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us so in the right application of the word is present we are looking at the blood and there's no fear nor condemnation but if it's not applied correctly it brings fear torment confusion lack of confidence now I'm not just talking about upon our soul it should be there upon our soul God came in this hour to bring a right application where many things had been called the new birth right shaking hands name on a church book oh I felt this or I felt that or chills ran down there but God brought the right application why that's what's needed for The Exodus Hallelujah so with that I'm so thankful that God has given Grace and access that we might be able to apply the word correctly I would say that probably every one of us in here can actually be able to say you know what there's things I thought at one time I no longer think that's true you grow right if you're not growing you're not maturing right so I thank God for that now I want to just look here at a few things that job when job is looking here in the midst of the trial I want to just go into some of these places here where job here is job I want you to remind I want to remind you here is a prophet of God here is one that has received visitation from God here is a man that is has a revelation of the sacrifice that if I will offer this sacrifice God will honor his word and I can stand upon that so we're not just talking about a man who has come into church and then you don't seem until a Revival comes around and then he pops back up and Manny looks like he's got the Victory and then the Revival's over and he's gone we're not talking about that kind of a man we're talking about one who is solidly positioned by God himself are you hearing me now we're talking about a man that God called a testimony meeting about it's one thing if I called a testimony meeting it's another thing if God called a testimony meeting and God just didn't call one of them he called two testimony meetings and he bragged on job what was he bragging on not job's flesh not Joe's Flash he was bragging on that part of himself that lay within job that job had surrendered to and it had taken a hold upon his life he was bragging on his word because God knows within our flesh is nothing there's no flesh and glory in his presence 6 verse 1. job answered and said oh that my grief were thoroughly weighed and my Calamity laid in the balances together for now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea how many knows that you can't number the Sands of the sea God's job said if you take grief and collect and come to the Sea over here my grief and Calamity would tip the skill and the sands could be lifted up wow therefore my words are swallowed up in other words I'm not having any reprieve for my words that I'm giving forth there's no reprieve now in between all these moments here that are taking place how long how many minutes were there hours were there I don't know in between all of this right here there's no doubt there are moments in here that you can read and infer job was praying and seeking after God verse 4. for the arrows of the Almighty are within me the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit the Terrors of God do set themselves in a ray against me I want you to think of this in verse 4 as you look at this he has already he's just declared that what is in my life and has taken place is the arrows of the Almighty he's not called it the arrows of the devil but it's the arrows of the almighty are drinking up my spirit in other words I don't want to go on living I can't even focus on or even think about the next moment the things that I once had Joy about I no longer have joy let me say this to you before I go on his removal of Joy had nothing to do with the circumstances that was around him his removal of joy is because of this right here he thought it was God doing it the joy of the Lord is my strength the Terrors of God do set themselves an array against me listen if God's for you who's going to be for you if God if God is the Bible said if God is for me who could be against me but if it looks like God is against you who's going to stand up come on now therefore now let us go here in Job chapter 7 verse 11. therefore I will not refrain my mouth I will speak in the anguish of my spirit I will complain in the bitterness of my soul now I want you to think of this here job is not saying I am a bitter person he's speaking of the circumstance my brother and sister because Satan's desire would love to see that of that of the trial and things come our way that were actually embitter a person to where just to get around him leaves a bad taste in your mouth would it be a refreshing is that right I mean when Paul wrote to to Philemon just a letter to when he wrote that to Flame and he said thou art a refreshing to the brother then that what the testimony you want to be out of your life I don't want it to be when I come around oh good lord Here Comes brother Samuel he's as negative as all can be Lord have mercy let me out of here anybody like being around negative people do you feel refreshed hello somebody now come on now listen sometimes we can be prone to that in our Humanity there's things to recognize it's not looking at all together saying God I want you to strip this out of me permanently I can show you throughout the years right here where brother Branham would gather with his wife and say I've purposed in my Heart Holy Ghost series we purpose in our heart across the dewfold never to let a negative thought come in my heart again end of 1959 December right adoption series May 1960. Lord God excuse to blast out every negative thought out of my heart you know what it shows that negative can come and sometimes we can be more susceptible to it but all how we need the washing of Water by the word God is not interested in perfecting our Humanity what he's interested in is that as a son or daughter of God his glory is manifested in a Reign Over Our Frailty say God help me I will complain in the bitterness of my soul Now watch how job perfect you know sets these questions am I a c now he's asking this is what he's putting forth before God am I a c or a well that thou set us to Watch Over Me In other words that I've got boundaries I don't know about you I've never seen a whale come out and walk on water I've never seen a whale come out on the land right and then the sea itself has borders and boundaries when it goes to encroach the moon will say no get back get back get back get back and job said what is this there's this something I can't get out of now I know I might be expressing it in this way but remember let me get I'll get to something here a little bit more you can see the frustration and the confusion that is there within job's life in this time when I say verse 13 my bed shall comfort me my couch shall ease my complaints let's interpret this right here when I say my phone watching a couple YouTube videos will ease my complaint it's going to sleep you know it was one thing you know my my daddy would it was in a way he just had a way about it and God allowed him to have it that way but my daddy was one that could say I'm stressed I'm you know I'm he I knew when he was really stressed because he'd go take a nap I'm not built that way when I'm stressed sleep goes far from me now that's just me that's how I'm built but you know when you think about my bed oh my bed oh my bed will come from me I can sleep and escape this my couch shall ease my complaint but this is what job says Lord then thou scarest me with dreams and terrifies me with visions God wasn't doing that a bit it's what job allowed in his mind while he was awake are you hearing me now we're going to preach with him while he's here just listen these are things remember Brother Brad tells us with the subconscious it's what you entertain things that you entertain that's why it's so important that not only do you open the day the morning with the lamb calls it out in the evening with the lamb it doesn't mean oh brother Sammy you tell me I'll never have a bad dreamer I'm not telling you that but I am telling you this that when you come out of it no there is the Lamb who is there and watching over you and you know by your heart's desire this is my desire and thank God for the way of Escape glory be to God in the same way there's an escape out of that dream there's an escape out of every test and every trial and one of these mornings there'll be an escape out of this Mortal body glory be to God so that my soul here's what happens so that my soul chooseth strangling and death rather than my life I loaf it I would not live always let me alone for my days are vanity hmm what is man that thou shouldest Magnify Him you know what's incredible when you read through all this here is you still find the humanity that we can see in our own selves that part about us that's still self right still about self and that's why we have to die to ourselves daily let a man take up his cross daily and follow me it's a continual mortification and crucifixion of self oh how easy it is in the midst of this time to revert to self verse 17 what is man that thou shouldest Magnify Him and that thou should have set thine heart upon him and that thou shouldest visit him every morning and try him every moment how long will thou not depart from me nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle now he's talking to the Lord I have sinned what shall I do unto thee Oh thou preserver of men why hast thou set me as a mark against thee so that I am a burden to myself oh my why does thou not pardon my transgression and take away my iniquity for now shall I sleep in the dust and thou shalt seek me in the morning but I shall not be remember prophet of God but he doesn't know that this is actually God's approval he doesn't know this isn't chastening it's got approving he doesn't know that it's God actually purging oh my God he doesn't know he doesn't understand that that he's looking at it in a way of manner he goes he noticed he knows that there's no one greater than God he knows he has met God's requirement but he doesn't understand what is taking place and not I say this he's no different than you or I true oh brother Samuel I've got the Holy Ghost well brother Bram tells us and be certain of God that how the first thing that we're to do is to examine our own life this first thing before we're going to ask for prayer or let's examine our own life he said when we've met God's requirements then we can be certain of God now one thing about it God is not one who plays hide and seek God don't play around with people he don't play in hide and say yes yes guess what it is guess what that is not God whatsoever God is very direct if there's an issue God's direct and he doesn't say it may be sore could be this that's not how God works amen so the first thing is we look and say Lord what's going on what's taking place what's what's what's going on in here brother says it like this in three kinds of Believers you're familiar with this statement sometimes he said Believers are put to the test sometimes not sometimes every time every son that cometh to God must be chasing trial child tried tried and child trained remember he says the trials the Dusty Rhodes the hot son of persecution you know those words right there we could preach a month on that Dusty Rhodes the hot son of persecution what is that where's the water at where's the refreshing where's the refreshing Lord where's the refreshing the hot sons of persecution but you know if God if everything was a golly Wisher and water flowing all the time we'd never appreciate over and over God works by a law of contrast right that's why brother Brandon says he said I that's why I believe he said we'll enjoy heaven so much is because we lived in this life at one time and it's the contrast of these things notice he says but it's the Loyalty of your heart that beats that material until she's ready to go into the mold what is the loyalty of our heart not our thinking job's thinking is out of line but it's his heart standing there on the word of God that's beating it into the place to where it's ready to go into the mold look at God's children it's made up correctly on his word for they are living examples and the word of God living through them the trial comes to shake you to put you to the very bottom to see where you'll stand well he says job went through the trials and tests his children taking everyone out everything else taken the church members come accused him of being a secret sinner tried to say everything against him but yet he wouldn't listen to any of it he knowed he had met God's requirements and we'll look at that in just a moment he knowed there's no need of Satan trying to tempt him he knowed it was the devil now watch this statement here he knowed it was the devil and as long as Satan can make him believe that his sickness was his God doing it he had joked with I don't know about you I've looked at this quote I could quote this quote I can go through it I've preached on this matter of fact I think from when even I'm preaching on job went through those who remember when I first stepped in as Pastor back there in 2002 I preached on a series going through things with job and even when reading through that and pondering on that statement as long as Satan could make him think it was his God doing it he had job with I think about it I just know it's the Lord just here within the past weeks and so forth actually months I've pondered this quote I've looked at it it hadn't been me I know it's been God that's brought it to my attention just to ponder over it just to meditate on it because here is a prophet of God but yet in these scriptures that I've read and will read you're reading a man who is whipped all right what's he whipped by his thoughts you think your thoughts don't matter your thoughts do matter oh brother Samuel the Mind means nothing I there's too much in the word of God and the prophet even tells us you can't even be born again unless the word travels through your mind and you accept it and believe it and brother Brahm says after he says that spoken words Original Seed he said I believe Saint Paul would shout when he heard me say that to an angel so lose your mind you don't lose your mind that's why brother Rams says when you come to the altar oh clear out your thoughts clear out your thoughts brother Rand said you're just opening yourself up to an evil spirit it ain't clear out your thoughts it's Center your thoughts on him that's why brother random said with a worker who comes to get along somebody again the receiving the Holy Ghost he said begin to quote the promise to them y'all hear me quote the promise to them well if that's how it is with receiving the Holy Ghost how about any other promise as long as Satan can believe make him believe that his sickness was his God doing it he had Joe whipped but when job once struck that Revelation that it was not God he was only going through his trials to make him something it wasn't God doing it it was Satan brother Brown said the same thing you're trying to tell you his trials on things as your God trying to put punishment upon you I won't ask you to raise your hands but this applies It Isn't So it's Satan doing it and God's permitting it for what reason to temper you why do you temper things to make it stronger right so a 10 percent makes it stronger to make you see not God to make us see if we are tied to this Earth by the Earth cares or whether your treasure is in heaven oh God help us I want you just to look at this I'm just going to kind of skip around here a little bit because it just job 9 9 17. I just want to break in on a couple of scriptures here because many of these parts will apply even into other times here notice Joseph in verse 17 for he speaking of God breakth me with and multi my wounds without calls he will not suffer me to take my breath but filleth me with bitterness once again job is not speaking of bitterness of Soul as far as I have become a bitter person remember what Jesus prayed he did not pray father let me not become bitter he said let this bitter cop s from me right I listen if he could pray that way how much more brother Graham tells us some souls in prison now he puts it in this way and it might kind of cause some people to struggle my brother Adam says Jesus prayed to dodge the cross why he even said now John 12 now is my soul troubled Hebrews 5 he he he he heard in that he feared he cried what was it it was God's subjecting God so subjected himself to become one of us that God experienced what it is to go through a trial what it is to be tempted what it is to be tested God so subjected himself he didn't have to do that but he did it but he might understand him and say I know how you feel and not just somebody patting this on the back but he ministers to us what we have need of you say brother Samuel I'm a sister how could he know there's only three gates that every Temptation can come through lest the flesh or pride of life and lust of the eyes all those right all those right there three gates and he experienced every Temptation and every trial such as common to man but he overcame there was listen to the scripture and yet he sinned not there was no unbelief that could that could come out because you want to know why there's no unbelief in the word and I might be jumping ahead of myself but inside a child a son and daughter of God when the Holy Spirit has come there is no unbelief in that seat that has been quickened are you with me it is that that brings discernment when Satan would want to come around our lives we're not perfect but our Perfection is in him notice this in job 10 verse 1. this one let's move ahead here my soul is weary of my life I will leave my complaint upon myself I will speak in the bitterness of my soul once again job is describing his appeal in this whole chapter watch how job will read this chapter job is appealing to The Compassion of the Lord um to even make an appeal to God's compassion this has to be somebody who knows his compassion are you with me let me just let's just read it here just just a little bit in verse 2 I will say unto God do not condemn me show me wherefore thou condemn us with me isn't it incredible job doesn't know job this is my approval but job looks at it I'm condemned wherefore thou contend us with me is it good unto thee that thou should have suppressed that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands and shine upon the counsel of the wicked hast thou eyes of Flesh or seeth thou as a man sees are thy days as the days of man or thy years as man's days that thou inquirist after my iniquity and search it after my sin thou knowest that I am not Wicked and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand thine hands have made me and fashioned me together about yet thou destroy me oh my my now who's she all talking to he's speaking his heart is being poured out there is his complaint in other words his request to appeal to The Compassion of almighty God Lord You're the one who's brought me here now to destroy me Lord what's what's going on notice I remember I beseech thee that thou Hast made me as the clay and wilt thou bring me into dust again hast thou not poured me out as milk and curdled me like cheese thou has clothed me with skin and flesh and has fenced me with bones and sinews oh my that you see even in that scripture thou Hast clothed me with skin and flesh and has fenced me with bones and sinews job recognizes this flesh is not who I am but I am an attribute of your skunk I've been brought here and this right here is not who I really am this right here [Applause] tell me what's Speaking In This Moment and I'll tell you it's the same one that spoke out of Peter and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God it's the same one in you the same wanted me that'll reach out and identify with the word regardless of circumstances Hallelujah I say How great is our God [Applause] thank you Jesus verse 12 has granted me in life and favor what's he saying Lord You're the one who's given me life you're the one who's giving me favor it's not what I had job have done and by visitation hath preserved my spirit glory be to God and these things hast thou hid in thine heart I know that this is with thee these things that are taking place you have hid in your heart I know it's with you I know you have the understanding Lord that I like about this you see the difference with job ain't running away in other words it doesn't matter what comes he can't get job off his hands you know why because job is connected and United with him are you hearing me I hope this don't offend nobody but this right here job is not like brother Ram talks about and I believe it's a marriage of the Lamb an artificial lamb a limb where you have maybe he said like an arm you give you an arm or a leg or something that's artificial or teeth or something or hair you get in a bad situation that hair can come off them teeth can come out that leg can fall off that arm can come out we are not artificial Christians that are just pumped in place we are born of the spirit of God into the body of Jesus Christ glory be to God in the highest oh my verse 14. if I sin then thou markest me and that will not equip me from my iniquity Joe knows there's only one place of safety and that's under the blood only one place I can have fellowship and that's under the blood if I be Wicked woeing to me and if I be righteous yet I will not lift up my head of confusion here is a man in job 29 that would speak oh that I could go back to how it was years ago days ago when I would come into the market and they would ask to speak to me they would implore of the wisdom that has come to me but notice here is a man who has been used by God to help others but in his circumstance brother William he said I'm in confusion I don't know what's going on I don't understand but in that all Satan can't budge him remember walking I of a man does not understand what's going on but this man his soul is united with God and that's what's most important because our flesh will never stand I spirit will never stand our mind will never stand but once that Soul has been sealed by almighty God nothing I said nothing can separate us from the love of Jesus Christ that we have in almighty God [Music] confusion I don't know but you see even in his confusion that had nothing to do with his soul do you remember the scripture we read that the trial of your faith not your flesh not in my spirit not my mind the trial of your faith well Lord I don't feel very very victorious in this our flesh will never feel victorious in a trial our spirit will never feel victorious in a trial our mind will never feel victorious in a trial but our soul it rejoice in the victory that is wrought in Jesus Christ [Applause] so don't let the devil are you with me now don't let the devil beat you up with well I'll tell you you ought to be you know to stepping in and praise breaking and everything else if you really had it going through a test or trial My Flesh don't feel that way but my soul on the inside my soul is doing a two-step my soul because you know what I don't know what all is going to go around but I know one thing I'm no one whom I have believed and I'm persuaded that he is able to keep me so just because I'm not doing a two-step here don't mean they're in a two-step and a praise break going on on the inside [Applause] [Music] I am full of confusion one thing I look at all this right here is God just continues to pour out and open things even as I'm standing here reading is one thing I can appreciate and it shows that job's a real man of God he's honest he's honest he ain't trying to cover it up or he's just he's just on I'm full of confusion therefore I tell you what I wonder if we get to the other side if we're going to be able to go up to job and say job I know that that was something that you would have never wanted to have wrote but I want to thank you for obeying the inspiration of the Almighty and writing that down even the things that it showed your Humanity because I receive strength and comfort in my life to understand me better glory be to God therefore see thou mind Affliction let me just try to bring this get down to us Point here and I'll just I'll just close it off because there's just no way for it increases thou honest me this is what he's speaking of the Lord thou honest me as a fierce lion and again thou show us thyself marvelous upon me thou renew us thy Witnesses against me and increaseth thine England Nation upon me changes and War are against me changes yeah even job's surrounding kindred his friends his buddies his buddies are texting him you need to get right to God and you know the Bible says what job said even the maid in his house hey we need some more sheets over here I'm reciting scripture my wife's breath is strange unto me [Music] Tim but that is a trial changes are all around me not the Lord knows not one of us likes change some of us like change a whole lot less than others right some of us you change you change one thing in the day Lord help us we're going to have to have a breakthrough and pray through to get through the rest of the day maybe I'm speaking about you maybe I'm just talking about me it's true come on now some of you know exactly like that is too got this planned out we're going to pick up our Fork at 3 55. we're going to put the fork in the knife and the stake it at 405. and then one at 402 we're going to get the butter and we're going to put the I don't call nobody's names now but I understand that and if things don't go according to plan Lord of us there's changes going on oh my I said God help us help us that even in that you know why you say why would God allow things to happen that way changes with things to let you and I see I've got it in control I've got it in control I've got Glory that's greater than your plan and then my plan Hallelujah Even This Moment was in my plan wherefore then has thou brought me forth out of the womb all that I had given up The Ghost and know I had seen me wait a minute here brother Richard is this the same fella here just scriptures ago that has just got done testifying thy favor and thy Lord thy favor thy Grace thy Spirit hath preserved me same fellow same one Oh Glory same one oh man I had given up The Ghost and know I had seen me in other words oh that I had not have even lived I should have been as though I had not been I should have been carried from the womb to the Grave or not my daesh view who's this all about him but Joe what about your wife you got to live for foreign who who I got to live for it's about me oh forgive me let me get back into the scripture here but this is part of it this part around you and I that you and I can see or if we could just God help us to take encouragement tonight it shows this part is around us but God gives us Grace to Reign Over It you know what the prophet said concerning this thing he said as long as you live once you've been born again he said you will have a carnal sticky nature about you that will bother you well who's bobber and who the Cardinal sticky nature is bothering the son or the daughter of God I don't know about you but there have been things right out through there and so forth even last week when the Lord blessed me with that deer there at the beginning of the week and I'm right in the midst where that thing fell and there's all kinds of them torn bushes and things all around there I went through there and them things sometimes they can cut right through hunting pants and that stuff's strong I had a gasket come up right here from that my wife looked at me she said what was that was that from the night I said no that probably was from one of them Thorns but you know how things are so easy to get stuck come on friends we can get stuck in a train of thought we can get stuck in certain things like a burr on the lake come on now we can get stuck but thanks be to God there's one to free us feed a god and one of these days when this life has been fully developed bye bye bye bye carnal sticky nature glory be to God oh my God oh glory be to God Hallelujah are not my days let me just these next couple scriptures and we'll close are not my days for you cease then and let me alone that I may take comfort a little remember job brother Brandon lets us know job is an older man right now my days are with you I've only got a few days left Lord let me have comfort let me have comfort before I go whence I shall not return even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death a land of Darkness as Darkness itself and of the shadow of death without any order where the light is as Darkness remember the problem just ends it like let's just stop here but you know brother bran preaches a message in the Hebrew series reaches more part one and apart two parts in one service or one day preaches Hebrews chapter 3 and then that night he preaches Hebrews chapter 4. brother Branham in the beginning of Hebrews chapter 3 he's dealing with how that God brought Israel out in the wilderness and they come straight to the Red Sea that God opens up a way and he said how God made a way through that he said and he said no doubt he said the people thought praise God we've just come through one big trial we're on our way it'll just be we'll just breeze on through to the promised land I wonder you know God doesn't come alone and tell us oh Joshua you sure you want to serve me it's going to be hard boy I'm going to make it tough on you I'm going no it isn't that at all it's him he comes it's him we do not fall in love with circumstances around us it's him it's him and that's what's important that we fall in love with him that we meet him because he's the one that opens up the Red Sea he's the one that sweetens bitter Waters he's the one that brings water out of the rock he's the one that nourishes us when we need nourishment it's him and in him it's all things that we have need of blessed be the Lord Hallelujah so we realize it's not just easy sailing but neither do we neither do we look at and say oh oh I don't know no In This Moment I worship Him for who he is if I or you were to look at tomorrow or even the things today maybe things are afflicted with things you're going through test your trial situations and family or not if you were to look at that how could you rejoice you couldn't but you can rejoice in him you understand you can invite his presence down to say Lord I know that you're still with me though the circumstances around me though I maybe haven't heard your voice Lord I know you're with me I know if it was not for your visitation my spirit would not have been preserved I know that I couldn't stand here tonight if it wasn't for your visitation in my life so I may not know what's going on around me but I know Lord that you're in control [Applause] this might just be jumping ahead just a little bit into the point but the Bible says in the opening brother Greg when those trials struck struck job he sin not nor charged God foolish and let me go on and say this right here because they just kind of just give a little prelude for some other things in the midst of all that brother William all this that we read he still is not sinning against God but there is no unbelief in the sacrifice Glory [Applause] though in my flesh it might grow weak though my spirit might grow weary but in my soul there is no unbelief no I don't understand what's taking place but yet what God says is true and every words Every Man's word is a lie including my own thoughts [Applause] glory be to God Lord Jesus thank you Lord for your word of encouragement Lord your presence Lord Jesus as your presence Lord already Lord just moving Lord even Lord as we come here and we've gathered the Lord together through the songs and then through the ministering of the word Lord Jesus thank you for ministering to our needs Lord thank you for speaking Lord so personally to our lives Lord God I I just Lord you know I I didn't know even weeks ago I kept praying Lord are you going to have me to go through that of those things of job I didn't know Lord I just waiting just praying and taking notes and looking at things and but Lord God I I'm just so thankful yeah I'm so thankful Jesus Lord you know and I'm sure that Lord God that same inspiration and Lord your spirit has moved right here I'm certain of that to every heart Lord that God you have so Lord minister to our hearts and our lives Lord how faithful we are Lord God for truly Lord there is no flesh that can glory in your presence Lord God oh Father in our flesh we're not making excuses but our flesh is weak Lord God but father it's in that of our soul lord we're the strength of the Lord is and that's why like David we can say the Lord is the strength of my life Lord Jesus no doubt Lord maybe one he or some here we've all come into these places Lord sometimes when the Lord God as we can take it back in the scripture Lord think it not strange when the fiery trial was to come Lord God our Humanity our Humanity still we'll go back to what's going on I don't understand that oh God but I'm so glad that you became one of us you made a way Lord and been through that way that Lord we might become Lord to you and you are a faithful and merciful high priest one who can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities for you yourself were encompassed around about with infirmity you know what it is Lord God to feel Lord and these things would come Lord our way but oh how you are so faithful Lord to intercede Lord on our behalf Lord I pray tonight God may it be Lord from every heart Lord that would go up may every lie Lord that the enemies wanted to try to whisper every thought Lord that he's tried to put Lord in the minds of Lord of my brothers or my sister or my mind Lord oh God may we cast down every imagination Lord and bringing Lord every thought Lord Into The Obedience of Jesus Christ for the Lord You're not against us Lord You Are For Us Lord Jesus oh God I pray father help us Lord help us Lord that in the midst of these moments Lord to look to you I realize the Lord that we can be in a variety Lord of situations it might be a test it might be a trial Lord it might be something Lord maybe that you're correcting us Lord we we don't I'm not trying to put Lord a finger upon something but this is what Lord I believe that you would lead us to is that in the midst of the situation Lord let us be sensitive and looking to you because Lord if it's correction I need to be corrected and I want to be corrected Lord I want to be able to discipline myself to the word of God I want to please you Lord father if it's a trial Lord that has come or a test I just read Lord God where your Prophet said that this regarding job it was you bringing out the qualities that are in a Believer Lord God help us the Lord that the qualities Lord that you see in US Lord there's only one way they can ever be brought out and that's through tests and trials Lord help us Lord help us help every one of us the Lord when you were here in the days of your flesh you prayed three times let this cup pass from me if it be thy will I'm so glad that you didn't answer that prayer I'm glad that you were willing to take your bitter cup oh God but you understand Lord Lord God I'm grateful that you by your grace would deliver us Lord from acting but rather we can come into your presence unashamed Lord when we can pour out our heart before you and ask for strength you don't despise us you don't look down on us but when we can look and say Lord give me strength Lord give me Grace Lord for this moment Lord Lord though my flesh wants to escape it Lord but give me Grace Lord just like that it came out of job at that moment Lord like other
