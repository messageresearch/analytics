[49:44] I want to read one scripture was one
[49:45] scripture in 2nd 2nd Corinthians chapter
[49:48] 11 and verse 1 I was going to continue
[49:51] on this morning with the thoughts on the
[49:53] rapture that I've ministered on the last
[49:54] time the revelation and for some reason
[49:57] the Lord just kept bringing me back to
[50:00] this little thought of doing this today
[50:03] so I'll share some things with you here
[50:05] in a moment but second Corinthians
[50:07] chapter 11 and verse 1 you need to know
[50:12] where that's at it's after 1st
[50:14] Corinthians I just had to say that I'm
[50:21] sorry
[50:23] 2nd Corinthians 11 verse 1 said would to
[50:26] God that ye would bear with me a little
[50:29] in my folly and indeed bear with me amen
[50:35] may God add his blessing to the reading
[50:38] of his word god bless you you may be
[50:39] seated this morning the word bear there
[50:46] Paul was speaking and he says I wouldn't
[50:49] 'god that you would bear with me that
[50:52] word bear means to to to suffer with to
[50:55] bear with - to endure and the word folly
[51:00] that paul uses there is a word that
[51:06] means if I can say it correctly
[51:08] foolishly foolishness senselessness the
[51:15] definition of folly thoughtlessness
[51:18] recklessness this is the Apostle Paul
[51:23] wanting you to suffer with him for a
[51:26] while to endure him for a while while he
[51:29] gets a little frolic he he talks a
[51:34] little bit about himself and about the
[51:37] things that he has done and if I could
[51:41] say it this way it's the Apostle Paul
[51:44] asking for a little bit of grace and
[51:47] forbearance so that he can talk about
[51:51] some things that he's accomplished in
[51:54] his ministry and what he's done talk
[51:58] about his life
[51:59] and if you would give me that same grace
[52:04] this morning I feel like I'm at home
[52:07] here
[52:09] I this is like a second home to me and I
[52:14] feel totally relaxed when I come here I
[52:17] appreciate you all I love you all very
[52:19] dearly and we're thankful to the Lord
[52:22] for our relationship through the years
[52:25] some of you have known us many many
[52:26] years others maybe not so long maybe
[52:29] that's good but we were hard to get rid
[52:33] of once you once you get acquainted with
[52:37] us so if you would just be kind enough
[52:40] this morning to to bear with me I would
[52:43] like to give you a little testimony if I
[52:48] can of myself and I've had this on my
[52:51] heart to do for some time coming
[52:54] different times and and I I remember
[52:56] asking brother Sam if I ever gave my
[52:58] life testimony here and he said I don't
[52:59] I don't remember you doing it if I did
[53:02] then you're gonna hear it again you just
[53:07] pretend like you never heard it I
[53:08] pretend like everything many of you have
[53:09] known bits and pieces of our life or
[53:13] through the years and some you know some
[53:16] good things some not-so-good things that
[53:18] have happened but I want to I want to
[53:21] take this morning if you don't mind and
[53:24] just talk a little bit about what God
[53:28] has done in my life and how I am what I
[53:30] am and how I got where I'm at so I want
[53:34] to start back and just do my little life
[53:36] story I'd like to have it on tape
[53:39] anyways I I've spoken at a couple places
[53:41] but I want to get it pull it together
[53:43] some once said one time they wanted to
[53:46] make a little package out of it I don't
[53:48] ever do that but I'm doing it because I
[53:51] want to encourage you I know life is
[53:56] short and I remember hearing brother
[54:01] Branham say when he was 50 years old or
[54:08] more I haven't done anything for Christ
[54:12] and I thought to myself Lord if he
[54:15] hasn't anything
[54:17] what could we possibly do you know but
[54:20] that was that was a genuine feeling in
[54:22] his heart that he wanted to accomplish
[54:25] more that he wanted to do more he felt
[54:27] like there was more out there and that
[54:28] was before the I think that was back
[54:30] before the third pole was even came into
[54:32] existence perhaps and he was feeling
[54:34] like you know I need to do more and we
[54:37] all feel that way you know saying is I'd
[54:39] rather rust out then I'd rather wear out
[54:42] then rust out because we there's always
[54:43] something you can do for the kingdom of
[54:45] God but when you look back on a ministry
[54:49] with brother Brandon spoke on his life
[54:50] story and you look at his beginning and
[54:53] how God protected him right from the
[54:55] beginning you that they would have
[54:57] starved to death in that cabin and and
[54:59] and died there that winter but the hand
[55:02] of the Lord is in our lives and I don't
[55:04] think there's a one of you sitting here
[55:06] this morning that can't point back and
[55:07] say God was with me here and he directed
[55:09] me here and he helped me here and he led
[55:11] me here you're here this morning because
[55:13] of the leadership of the Holy Spirit in
[55:15] your life and what God has done we've
[55:16] all got a testimony but the bantam said
[55:19] if you can't tell anything else tell how
[55:21] your how your fire got lit that's the
[55:24] only testimony you got it so I wanna I
[55:26] want to just share with you how the fire
[55:29] got living the LaFontaine family that
[55:33] okay that'd be all right this morning
[55:35] it's not a deep deep related message but
[55:40] I think you're hearing that anyways if
[55:43] you're like us over there our church
[55:47] we're I think the ministries our
[55:49] greatness that's ever been that I've
[55:50] ever heard it just seems like God is
[55:53] zeroing in and giving us exactly what we
[55:55] have need of so I thought you know maybe
[56:00] we can just relax today I like to tell
[56:06] people I was born at a very young age
[56:10] I was that's the truth
[56:19] and so I'm gonna be myself today I was
[56:24] born in Port Heron Michigan November the
[56:28] 21st you want to write that date down
[56:30] for my birthday 1943 I'd like to send a
[56:35] little log cabin I helped my daddy bill
[56:37] but I can't say that that wouldn't be it
[56:39] wouldn't be like and I like that's what
[56:44] I used to say I was believe it or not
[56:52] when I was born I was a preemie I only
[56:56] weighed four pounds and some ounces I
[56:58] don't know what the ounces of where they
[56:59] might have been 200 I don't know but
[57:01] they never did tell me I was four pounds
[57:03] of something I have never by the grace
[57:05] of God I'll be 74 next month in November
[57:09] I have never by the grace of God spent
[57:11] the night in a hospital as a patient not
[57:16] even when I was born now there's not a
[57:19] lot of people that can say that
[57:21] but it's only His grace
[57:23] I I worry you know I think about what
[57:27] would happen if I had to go in I that
[57:29] that kind of freaks me out a little bit
[57:30] there was a time when a lady tried to
[57:32] put me in a nurse practitioner said you
[57:34] need to go to the hospital need to go
[57:35] now and I said I have never been to the
[57:37] hospital to spend the night as a patient
[57:39] and I don't want to go now so she let me
[57:42] go home anything called me that night
[57:44] about 11:00 o'clock make sure I was all
[57:46] right he talked about the nice nurse
[57:47] practitioner so I I've never done that
[57:51] but I was born in a nursing home that's
[57:54] what they used to have back then
[57:57] birthing home I guess is what it was
[57:59] called where you would have midwives and
[58:00] different ones come in and mother
[58:01] decided to go there and for some reason
[58:03] I was that's where I was born I was not
[58:05] raised in church I did not know the
[58:09] value of church mom and dad were not
[58:10] churchgoers they were there were sinners
[58:14] dad was what I would call an alcoholic
[58:17] he done a lot of drinking in his past
[58:20] mom both both of them drank both of them
[58:22] smoked and dad was in the Coast Guard so
[58:27] he was like with the sailors and stuff
[58:29] he could cussed with the best of them
[58:31] and he did often and that was kind of
[58:33] embarrassing at times once I became a
[58:35] Christian especially I remember one time
[58:37] we were sitting at the camp meeting in
[58:38] Ann Arbor and they saying with dad and
[58:40] we were sitting in the cafeteria there
[58:42] and everybody was around us going around
[58:43] and we were talking and I said oh by the
[58:45] way dad I'm gonna drop the kids off so
[58:46] you can watch him for a while well he
[58:47] started cussing right the lunchroom and
[58:50] a camp meeting your goals dad I said dad
[58:53] I was only kidding but you know kid I
[58:57] guess with people they got a mouth like
[58:59] that but anyways that that was my
[59:01] upbringing we just never found I guess
[59:04] the time or or anything to to to go to a
[59:09] church there were good people I don't
[59:13] want to paint a bad picture of them but
[59:15] they drank a lot dad would often we'd go
[59:17] to town for shopping and mom and I when
[59:19] I was just a little kid we'd go and
[59:20] they'd always want to stop by the beer
[59:23] garden on the way home dad would to have
[59:25] a drink before he came back to the house
[59:26] and so here I was just a bit four or
[59:29] five years old little butch running
[59:31] around with him you know and so they
[59:33] would drag me into the into the VFW it
[59:35] was a VFW I for years I
[59:37] thought it was very few women that's
[59:39] what it meant because there was no
[59:40] hardly any women there's all guys you
[59:41] know but I found that it was veterans of
[59:43] foreign war and that's why dad I guess
[59:45] joined it but I would he would drag and
[59:47] finally I got the place I got older I
[59:49] said no I said let me sit in a car I
[59:51] don't want to go in there so I sit in
[59:52] the car sometimes an hour 45 minutes an
[59:54] hour waiting for them to go in and have
[59:56] a little drink and come back on and I
[59:58] learn to hate I learned to hate alcohol
[1:00:01] I saw what it did to my family I saw
[1:00:04] what it did to my mom and dad and I just
[1:00:06] you know I just said no I said I I don't
[1:00:09] want anything to do with that but other
[1:00:10] than that there were good parents I
[1:00:12] don't ever remember a time I don't ever
[1:00:16] remember a week go by that dad didn't
[1:00:18] bring a paycheck home for our family to
[1:00:21] put a roof over her head to put food on
[1:00:23] her table and to meet our needs he was a
[1:00:25] very very good provider when it come to
[1:00:29] that he was a hard worker I remember
[1:00:31] many at times he would go out in
[1:00:33] inclement weather he was a Salesman he
[1:00:35] he sold cooked coffee for years and he's
[1:00:37] so life insurance in most all of his
[1:00:39] life and he was always a good provider
[1:00:41] mom on the other hand was a homebody she
[1:00:43] never wanted to go anywhere she never
[1:00:44] wanted to do anything she just want to
[1:00:46] stay at home and she'd always I don't I
[1:00:48] don't not remember ever coming home from
[1:00:50] school and all the years of my school
[1:00:52] life without her being in the house when
[1:00:54] I got home that's really something to
[1:00:57] say and I think that helped mold our
[1:01:00] lives in in the end to what they are
[1:01:03] today because they were good parents
[1:01:04] when it come to that dad loved to hunt
[1:01:06] he loved to fish he taught me to do that
[1:01:08] we went hunting together went fishing
[1:01:10] together went the ball games together he
[1:01:12] likes sports and so as far as a
[1:01:14] providers they were good that way they
[1:01:16] were good people and I got my humor from
[1:01:18] my mom she was the funny one of the
[1:01:23] family dad was all serious and you know
[1:01:25] taking care of business but mom mom just
[1:01:27] was a crack-up she just uh I just bless
[1:01:31] her heart she got me laughing so much he
[1:01:33] would just and we needed it we needed a
[1:01:35] lot of laughter back in those days
[1:01:36] because there wasn't a lot going on you
[1:01:37] know to be good about baseball was my
[1:01:40] love I love baseball my grandfather
[1:01:43] played professional ball and I wanted to
[1:01:46] be just like him he played years and
[1:01:48] years back

[1:01:51] Minnesota Twins before all that
[1:01:52] transpired he played when there was no
[1:01:55] padding in the glove
[1:01:56] you just had a piece of leather there
[1:01:57] that's when he was playing ball so I
[1:01:59] wanted to be like him so I said you know

[1:02:22] grandpa they're all oh yeah butch is
[1:02:24] gonna do it which is going to do it he's
[1:02:25] gonna be the ball player and then one
[1:02:27] day I was sitting in church I was about
[1:02:29] 13 14 years old sitting in church and
[1:02:31] something got ahold of my life sitting
[1:02:35] in a Baptist Church in Wadhams Michigan
[1:02:38] and the Holy Spirit spoke to my heart a
[1:02:42] nephew said it's your time I'll never
[1:02:49] forget coming to the offer I didn't know
[1:02:53] just the center I was a bet in a Baptist
[1:02:56] Church and the Baptist he can come and
[1:02:58] pray with me and he said this is how to
[1:02:59] pray Lord Jesus forgive me for my sins
[1:03:03] and I prayed after he prayed I'll tell
[1:03:05] you what when I got up from that altar
[1:03:08] and I walked away I was a different
[1:03:10] individual I felt like a heavy load had
[1:03:13] lifted off my shoulder I felt like I was
[1:03:17] free I used to swear I used to steal I
[1:03:20] used to lie I used to cheat all that
[1:03:23] went away at that one experience at an
[1:03:26] altar of God and all of a sudden
[1:03:32] baseball all of a sudden baseball became
[1:03:35] my second love and Jesus Christ became
[1:03:41] my first let me tell you something this
[1:03:43] morning he wants first place in your
[1:03:45] life if you got anything else going
[1:03:48] around this there it ain't gonna work he

[1:03:55] place I didn't want to go to church I'm

[1:03:58] was church night I want to be in the
[1:04:00] house
[1:04:00] of God my dad thought I'd flip my mind
[1:04:02] he thought I'd lost my mind grandpa got
[1:04:04] so disappointed in me
[1:04:05] oh no but this ain't gonna happen and
[1:04:07] sure enough it didn't happen you don't
[1:04:10] have to watch me on Sundays or the
[1:04:14] weekend hitting the ball I'll come and
[1:04:16] speak for you I'm so glad to be a part
[1:04:23] of the family of God I'm so glad for
[1:04:25] what he done but he took all that away
[1:04:28] and I was about probably I think about
[1:04:29] 13 14 years old and a Baptist preacher
[1:04:31] had come to the door and said anybody
[1:04:33] want to go to church here I remember
[1:04:35] saying I do I was in the back room I
[1:04:36] said I do dad kind of cranked his head
[1:04:38] around and that's what happened I
[1:04:39] started going to church with that
[1:04:41] Baptist preacher and and and he picked
[1:04:44] up me picked up my picked up my uncle I
[1:04:46] had an uncle called bebop why are you
[1:04:52] laughing let me tell you you would be
[1:04:57] glad to call bebop if your name was
[1:04:59] Myron Koppel Berger
[1:05:04] it was his name well my mother I don't
[1:05:10] know where it all came from but
[1:05:12] nicknames was her pet peeve
[1:05:14] she just loved nickname to give an
[1:05:19] example I've got a a nephew named jinx
[1:05:25] cousin named jinx rather I got an aunt
[1:05:28] named boots an uncle named Jeep a niece
[1:05:31] named pumpkin John Paul was called
[1:05:35] Charlie Brown oh pretty better kill me
[1:05:39] for this I know he is Sharon was called
[1:05:43] Polly Ike was called Jake
[1:05:47] these were nicknames that's what they
[1:05:49] called us and I was butch and my little
[1:05:54] brother was stink I was glad to be
[1:06:00] called hoods but nicknames were I don't
[1:06:04] know why they just they just stuck with
[1:06:06] us all through the years I didn't even
[1:06:07] know what my name was that I got in
[1:06:08] school I really did they call called
[1:06:10] John la Fontaine for roll call and I
[1:06:13] just sat there Java Fontaine here nobody
[1:06:18] in somebody put me sitting at you said
[1:06:22] no they said John I said yeah that's
[1:06:24] your name isn't didn't know what I was
[1:06:27] butch I thought butch was a name so I
[1:06:38] always I always knew there was a God
[1:06:43] there was I call it a God consciousness
[1:06:46] about I knew when I did right from wrong
[1:06:50] I knew I was doing wrong it didn't stop
[1:06:52] me from doing it but there was something
[1:06:54] there and I think just about every true
[1:06:57] believer can say there was a God
[1:06:58] consciousness there there was something
[1:07:00] there that we knew when it was right and
[1:07:04] when it was wrong but it just took a
[1:07:05] conversion it took a new birth to take
[1:07:08] that to take that stuff away baseball
[1:07:13] kind of went by the wayside and I
[1:07:15] I started carrying my Bible to school
[1:07:17] every day I take my Bible of school and
[1:07:20] walk the halls with it and bring it home
[1:07:21] at night and funny
[1:07:22] dad was an insurance man and he he was
[1:07:25] well-known throughout the community and
[1:07:27] everybody talked to everybody and he
[1:07:29] comin to me one day and he said he said
[1:07:31] I gotta talk to you said this carry in
[1:07:33] your Bible the school said I don't want
[1:07:34] you to do that no more taking it there
[1:07:37] and bring it back I don't want you to do
[1:07:38] that no more don't don't be taking your
[1:07:40] Bible and bring it and take it I said ok
[1:07:42] so the next morning I get up I got my
[1:07:44] Bible I put it in my school bag I went
[1:07:47] to school and I put in the locker I
[1:07:49] walked the halls with it put in the
[1:07:51] locker I walked the halls with and put
[1:07:52] it a locker I never went back and forth
[1:07:53] with it no workers he didn't want me to
[1:07:55] go back and forth so I did what he said

[1:08:01] went to a school that was pretty tough
[1:08:04] school it was there was it was
[1:08:05] integrated it was pretty tough and I
[1:08:07] remember one day I I was walking the
[1:08:09] halls and I was just a little runt I was
[1:08:11] just I wouldn't
[1:08:12] I wasn't very big anyways and a bunch of

[1:08:16] call him brothers just by the grace of
[1:08:17] God got a got me slammed up against a
[1:08:20] locker in the hallway and they start
[1:08:23] pushing me around and all of a sudden
[1:08:24] this walking carpet stepped between me
[1:08:26] and them I mean this guy was like 6 foot
[1:08:29] 10 and 250 pounds and he said leave him
[1:08:35] alone he's my friend I didn't know who

[1:08:43] life but I had a friend

[1:09:13] border and put here and McDonald's hired
[1:09:15] him on the weekends to walk their
[1:09:17] parking lot and keep order so that the
[1:09:20] kids and the gangs and think of that
[1:09:21] nature didn't come in there and and tear
[1:09:23] up the place so James was was was it was
[1:09:26] kind of like a bodyguard if you want to
[1:09:28] say that a bouncer for McDonald's if you
[1:09:30] want to say that and his nickname was
[1:09:32] cowboy everybody called him cowboy

[1:09:48] a hold of mine invited over he preached
[1:09:49] for me once he got a church he invited
[1:09:51] me over and I preached for him so it's a
[1:09:54] small world here was cowboy in Butch and
[1:09:56] they were getting together and they were
[1:09:58] having fellowship and it was a wonderful
[1:09:59] thing you know there were not he's he's

[1:10:04] influence in my life a great brother and
[1:10:05] and God always has the way of protecting
[1:10:08] you I remember another time I was we had
[1:10:12] a the black river was behind our house
[1:10:15] and about two fields back to the back
[1:10:16] forever
[1:10:17] I remember going down there with my
[1:10:18] aunts and some of the neighborhood
[1:10:21] people we have now we used to go down
[1:10:22] there swimming in the Black River well I
[1:10:23] couldn't swim but I like to splash
[1:10:25] around in the water and I I don't know I
[1:10:27] was probably maybe eight years old or
[1:10:29] something like that maybe a little older
[1:10:31] or younger I mean and we were down there
[1:10:33] and somebody was and we were bouncing
[1:10:36] around here and I fell backwards in the
[1:10:37] water and I remember going down in that
[1:10:40] water and all I could think about was
[1:10:42] it's all over I'm gonna die and all of a
[1:10:46] sudden arms come down under that water
[1:10:49] and scooped me up and pick me up and
[1:10:50] carry me back to the bank and save my
[1:10:53] life because God's gonna take care of
[1:10:57] you
[1:10:58] until he's done using you here in this
[1:11:01] area I remember another time we were
[1:11:05] standing out by the road ready ready to
[1:11:06] go through a school event or something
[1:11:09] like that and we're standing out there
[1:11:10] by the road we're walking back we're
[1:11:11] pitch black out in the country we live
[1:11:13] out in the country pitch black you
[1:11:14] couldn't see two feet in front of you
[1:11:16] and something spoke to me and said step
[1:11:17] back I step back and a car went flying
[1:11:21] past me with no lights on God hasn't got
[1:11:27] his hand on his elect don't you let the
[1:11:32] devil push you around God has got his
[1:11:35] hand on his left he is going to take
[1:11:39] care of you I never forget these things
[1:11:48] 17 years old getting ready to go into a
[1:11:55] high score of 16 actually and dad got a
[1:11:57] transfer from Michigan to Oklahoma City
[1:12:01] Oklahoma I had to leave all my friends
[1:12:04] all my upbringing all my I went to
[1:12:06] school with him all my life over there
[1:12:08] there were bosom buddies and I had to
[1:12:10] leave all that my senior year and go to
[1:12:12] Oklahoma City it was a different world
[1:12:16] all new friends and little did I realize
[1:12:18] God was training me for a ministry that
[1:12:22] was going to cause me to have to leave
[1:12:23] friends here leave friends here and go
[1:12:25] and meet new ones and do things it was
[1:12:27] the beginning of a move in my life that
[1:12:29] God was using my first week in Oklahoma
[1:12:34] City u.s. grant high school to seniors
[1:12:39] got in a fight decided to settle it
[1:12:41] after school one of them lost went to
[1:12:44] his car got a gun and shot and killed
[1:12:45] the other one welcome to the Wild West I
[1:12:49] said it's given me to death I just a
[1:12:54] country bumpkin from Michigan I didn't I
[1:12:57] never saw anything like that
[1:12:58] everybody was toting guns down there and
[1:13:01] hunters and you could see them racks in
[1:13:03] the back of the cars I never I had never
[1:13:05] experienced anything quite
[1:13:06] yeah there was something I had a whether
[1:13:08] was we started somewhere back in there
[1:13:14] that I started going to church with our
[1:13:16] neighbor a Baptist Church and I'd met a
[1:13:19] girl in high score name was Julia you
[1:13:22] might be doing this you guys I want to
[1:13:25] make this tape and I want to want to do
[1:13:27] it right but I'd met a girl in high
[1:13:29] school she was a similar god girl name
[1:13:31] was Julia and I got to like in her a
[1:13:35] little bit so we started you know I
[1:13:38] can't say the word dating because I'm
[1:13:40] not allowed to say that any more than a
[1:13:41] message but we started we started
[1:13:45] running around together and what would
[1:13:49] happen was every Sunday night we got to
[1:13:52] a place that that we both had services
[1:13:55] Sunday night so one Sunday night I'd go
[1:13:57] to her church and next Sunday night
[1:13:58] she'd come to my church so we started
[1:14:00] doing that we started going you know you
[1:14:02] know how you are wondering when you're
[1:14:03] not dating but you're you're real close
[1:14:05] to something like that
[1:14:05] and all of a sudden your your ear add to
[1:14:08] lift her life one Sunday and then you're
[1:14:10] back here in your own assembling next
[1:14:11] Sunday know how that is Josh there's an
[1:14:18] attraction on the mountain you know you
[1:14:19] gotta so we started doing that and I
[1:14:23] never forget the first time that I ever
[1:14:29] ever went to her church I was a Baptist
[1:14:35] boy most of my experience my life and
[1:14:41] the music started we went down in the
[1:14:43] congregation I remember walking to the
[1:14:45] back door we said about halfway down
[1:14:46] somewhere halfway marking on this side
[1:14:49] the fuse went all the way to the to the
[1:14:51] wall I think that we came down to smile
[1:14:52] and I went a little halfway down we got
[1:14:55] in the middle of the aisle I'll never
[1:14:56] forget Julia was sitting between me and
[1:14:58] the island between me and the next thing
[1:15:00] was the wall and I wasn't gonna get out
[1:15:03] that way so I thought I wanted to make a
[1:15:04] way but there was Julia and then about
[1:15:06] 14,000 people and that pute well there
[1:15:09] wasn't quite that many but there was a
[1:15:10] bunch of people between me and that
[1:15:11] aisle and me I'm a little claustrophobic
[1:15:14] anyway so I was I was uptight anyways
[1:15:17] the music started we were just sitting
[1:15:18] Aaron and the music started and all of a
[1:15:20] sudden people started singing to the
[1:15:22] music and they started clapping their
[1:15:23] hands well that didn't freak me out I
[1:15:26] thought well you know what I got rhythm
[1:15:28] I you know I felt like I had rhythm
[1:15:29] every every Saturday morning Saturday
[1:15:33] afternoon American Bandstand would come
[1:15:35] on the television with Dick Clark and
[1:15:37] and they played all the rock and roll
[1:15:38] songs and all the songs and I take my my
[1:15:40] sister who was 14 years younger and I
[1:15:42] wouldn't I take her to my arms we dance
[1:15:44] all over the living room and I had
[1:15:45] rhythm so I didn't mind clapping my hand
[1:15:47] I thought that was cool you know our
[1:15:49] Baptist Church didn't do that but we did
[1:15:50] that at her church and I really enjoyed
[1:15:53] it and then and then we got to sing of a
[1:15:55] good and all of a sudden the choir got
[1:15:56] up the choir don't have to sing a
[1:15:58] special and this is what really got to
[1:16:00] me they got up start singing we're
[1:16:02] nearing the show beautiful show my
[1:16:08] goosebumps come all over me I thought I
[1:16:10] didn't even know what the rapture was
[1:16:12] but I could have been in it right then
[1:16:13] man alive I never heard nothing like
[1:16:16] that
[1:16:16] and then all of a sudden somebody down
[1:16:18] in front on this side started speaking
[1:16:21] in tongues gibbering and carrying on I
[1:16:24] punched you I said what's that said he's
[1:16:28] speaking in unknown tongues I said let's
[1:16:32] go
[1:16:34] oh just stay quiet this way I said I
[1:16:37] kept looking at those 14,000 people so
[1:16:42] pretty soon he stopped and then somebody
[1:16:45] over here in front got up and started
[1:16:47] talking I said this is the middle of a
[1:16:51] service they were singing and they
[1:16:53] stopped singing this was going on and
[1:16:55] she said he's interpreting what he said
[1:17:00] I said that's cool she said no no it's
[1:17:05] okay
[1:17:06] well then we stayed the service and
[1:17:07] business so then their very next morning
[1:17:09] I get up probably like up the Raiders
[1:17:11] we're not call my pastor on phone so I
[1:17:12] got to talk to you so I went down to the
[1:17:14] Baptist Church met with my pastor I said
[1:17:16] this this this and this I said this one
[1:17:18] on and their tongues and interpretation
[1:17:20] and I said ain't right is that I know
[1:17:21] that ain't right he said no no no no
[1:17:24] that's not right said that you want to
[1:17:26] stay away from that stuff that's holy
[1:17:27] rollers and I said I knew it I knew it I
[1:17:32] knew it it just could be right so I
[1:17:37] started studying because I wanted to I
[1:17:39] like this girl and I wanted to help her
[1:17:41] I wanted a shorter she was wrong and get
[1:17:45] her straightened out so she could join
[1:17:46] the Baptist Church so I started studying
[1:17:50] out in my I opened my Bible to the book
[1:17:52] of Acts because everybody said that's
[1:17:53] where that's where all this stuff yeah I
[1:17:55] don't think I ever heard the word
[1:17:56] Pentecost until I met her I probably did
[1:17:58] I don't ever remember even hearing the
[1:18:00] word Pentecost
[1:18:01] so I started again I come to Acts
[1:18:04] chapter 2 verse 1 and when the day of
[1:18:06] Pentecost was fully come as I say what I
[1:18:11] think when the day of Pentecost was
[1:18:14] fully come anything that's fully come
[1:18:16] can't come no more it's already come
[1:18:19] it's full it's done it's complete it's
[1:18:21] kaput you can't have any more what's the
[1:18:24] fullest for what are you gonna eat if
[1:18:25] you're for nothing so I called you on
[1:18:29] the phone I said yeah I got to talk to
[1:18:30] you right now so I went over and met
[1:18:32] with her I said listen this is it here's
[1:18:34] the scripture and I boy I was a banty
[1:18:36] rooster I said I was ready to go I
[1:18:38] remember one time in our Sunday School
[1:18:39] room and her son is bringing the Baptist
[1:18:41] Church they had one of these Papa's that
[1:18:43] was on wheels that little pompous that
[1:18:44] they use and I was we
[1:18:46] around when they going up and down the
[1:18:47] island somebody said what are you doing
[1:18:49] said well I'm a roving preacher I said
[1:18:50] I'm going everywhere I didn't know what
[1:18:53] God had in store for me but look what
[1:18:55] happened
[1:18:57] so I set her down and I said look at
[1:19:00] this when the day of Pentecost was fully
[1:19:03] come I said Julia it's already come it's
[1:19:05] full it can't come no more it's complete
[1:19:08] it's done it's kaput what do you think
[1:19:13] about them apples
[1:19:15] and she sat there quietly nice just calm
[1:19:19] and she said well let me ask you one
[1:19:22] question well I was a theologian by then
[1:19:24] so questions were gonna ask away off man
[1:19:27] I can handle it you know come on bring
[1:19:29] it on
[1:19:31] she looked at me and she said if it's
[1:19:33] done it's complete it's full and it's
[1:19:36] over and it's finished and it's kaput
[1:19:39] like you say how come people are still
[1:19:42] getting it
[1:19:48] I don't know what I wanted to that's
[1:19:52] what I told her all I know is I wanted
[1:19:54] to if it's real in this genoise I want
[1:19:56] what they got and so we went on to
[1:20:02] graduate together grot graduation that
[1:20:05] year I'll never forget we instead of
[1:20:07] going to the prom
[1:20:08] Julia and I went out and hit golf balls
[1:20:10] on a go on the golf range we were
[1:20:13] Christians we didn't dance hello
[1:20:16] I remember as a young person going up
[1:20:21] and I'll get through it the probably in
[1:20:22] a little while but our young people
[1:20:23] didn't do it either our bachelors young
[1:20:24] people didn't dance either so they would
[1:20:26] they would have a youth banquet that's
[1:20:28] where I got acquainted with youth
[1:20:29] banquets our Baptist group and all the
[1:20:31] Christian churches in the area would
[1:20:34] have a youth banquet combined together
[1:20:35] on prom night so they didn't have to go
[1:20:38] to the prom and we would have the
[1:20:40] speaker's come in sometimes we'd have a
[1:20:41] sports figure come in or somebody to
[1:20:43] come in and speak to us our young hearts
[1:20:45] and we had a time to dress up or look
[1:20:46] nice that's where that's where I got it
[1:20:48] in my mind from me being a kid we went
[1:20:50] to we went to these youth banquets and I
[1:20:52] thought my this is a wonderful thing and
[1:20:53] I begin to incorporate it into the
[1:20:56] message some years back but but I always
[1:20:58] always looked and honored what I felt
[1:21:01] like was what God wanted me to do as an
[1:21:03] individual and I couldn't do the things
[1:21:05] that were doing
[1:21:06] I remember I was in speech class I took
[1:21:07] speech I used to be real shy for the
[1:21:09] bill I would this is the truth I would
[1:21:12] not get up to the blackboard and work
[1:21:14] out a problem even if I knew the answer
[1:21:17] because I'm scared I used to feel like I
[1:21:21] had a hard time talking to people can
[1:21:23] you believe that I really hit so I
[1:21:30] decided when I was a senior in high
[1:21:31] school I decided well I'm gonna take a
[1:21:32] I'm gonna take a speech class I thought
[1:21:36] I need help so I took this speech class
[1:21:40] and learned some principles and so our
[1:21:43] decisive grade in the class was to give
[1:21:46] a speech to the people in the class so I
[1:21:49] just say well I don't know what I'm
[1:21:50] gonna speak about but I've got to do
[1:21:52] that now I got to get up for other
[1:21:53] people and I got to talk so dad was an
[1:21:55] insurance man so I went to dad and I
[1:21:56] said dad tell me all about it selling an
[1:21:58] insurance policy I don't know how to
[1:21:59] sell
[1:21:59] policy so he sat me down we went through
[1:22:02] all those things I rolled up my speech
[1:22:03] and I got up and I had everybody get a
[1:22:06] piece of paper out and I started into
[1:22:07] this spill about the insurance and
[1:22:09] everybody needs insurance we got to have
[1:22:10] this and gotta have that and what I want
[1:22:11] you to do is put your name down put your
[1:22:13] address down put your put your this down
[1:22:15] that down and everything and said okay I
[1:22:17] said now sign at the bottom says you
[1:22:18] just signed up for a policy and I got an
[1:22:21] A and that was easy because I was just
[1:22:25] talking about something that I knew that
[1:22:27] you worked for dad but I had to break
[1:22:30] through the ice of being scared not
[1:22:34] afraid but I'm gonna tell you what the
[1:22:38] Holy Spirit can give you boldness like
[1:22:41] you ain't never seen what he comes into
[1:22:44] your life so there we were we were
[1:22:46] finishing up high school we graduated
[1:22:48] and I had I had a great job when I when
[1:22:56] I was in high school I had a I worked

[1:23:04] supermarket and I made fifty cents an
[1:23:08] hour
[1:23:10] 1961 bagging groceries and carried him
[1:23:14] out to the car I got a raise when I
[1:23:18] graduated just 60 cents an hour that's
[1:23:22] what I work for I thought you hate gonna
[1:23:26] cut it I can't even afford the insurance
[1:23:29] I just sold the whole class for 60 cents
[1:23:32] an hour so I joined the United States
[1:23:34] Air Force took a ride with the guys got
[1:23:39] all signed up everything come back told
[1:23:40] mom she was out in the on the garage

[1:23:44] horseshoe out in the garage because it
[1:23:46] didn't freeze enough to have worry about
[1:23:48] frozen pipes and I think so we had a
[1:23:50] worker out in the garage and the old
[1:23:51] kind of ringer washer where you did it
[1:23:53] by hand and everything she was out there
[1:23:54] there's a mom I said I got to talk to

[1:25:11] to pass you know the green beans or pass
[1:25:13] the potatoes they'd say their
[1:25:15] terminology was thank you for the beans
[1:25:17] I said I didn't make him I didn't bring
[1:25:21] him I said thank you for the taters
[1:25:25] well they meant would you please pass
[1:25:27] the potatoes it was a foreign language
[1:25:31] it really was it was it was a foreign
[1:25:33] language and this was the first time I
[1:25:34] really ran into segregation was was down
[1:25:37] in North Carolina because I when I got
[1:25:39] there I got on a city bus and right away
[1:25:41] when I got in the bus that said blacks
[1:25:42] to the back I never saw that in my life
[1:25:46] there were restaurants and
[1:25:48] establishments in the city of Goldsboro
[1:25:49] North Carolina at that time that they
[1:25:52] had it posted interval blacks not
[1:25:53] allowed not welcomed and I remember back
[1:25:58] in the 70s going with a little family
[1:26:00] over here and just not too far from you
[1:26:03] got down here to call the Johnson family
[1:26:05] there they were in the message the
[1:26:06] Johnson family they believed at that
[1:26:08] time they believed the message I don't
[1:26:09] remember where they are on a precious
[1:26:10] family I went down to we were going down
[1:26:12] to North Carolina it's a special
[1:26:13] meetings down there and we decided to go
[1:26:15] together and went together we're in a
[1:26:16] restaurant down there in the south
[1:26:17] somewhere to eat something and and we
[1:26:19] got sit down and somebody come up said
[1:26:20] said your
[1:26:22] come here but they're not I'll talk
[1:26:24] about their 70s I said what are you
[1:26:27] talking about I'm gonna go get cowboy
[1:26:29] you're gonna wake you out man
[1:26:32] it was that strong and that powerful
[1:26:35] well I've never experienced anything
[1:26:37] like that I we grew up together we had
[1:26:40] great times and not-so-great times one
[1:26:42] of my first fistfights and only fist
[1:26:43] fights was with a little black boy and
[1:26:45] he could box me and that kid could fight
[1:26:49] he was something else about he he would
[1:26:51] have cleaned my clock of the teacher
[1:26:52] hidden tongue but I was holding my own I
[1:26:56] just I hadn't fallen yet anyway so so I
[1:27:01] went in the I went in the United States
[1:27:02] Air Force and I arrived on a Saturday or
[1:27:08] Friday night it was I think Saturday I
[1:27:09] got up and I started looking in the
[1:27:11] phone book for a church to go to and I
[1:27:14] was a Baptist but I knew Pentecost was
[1:27:16] right because I knew that's what I
[1:27:19] needed I needed that experience so I'm
[1:27:22] looking in the phone book and I'm going
[1:27:23] through the pages and all of a sudden my
[1:27:24] eyes fall on Pentecostal free will
[1:27:27] Baptists it's it glory to God I can hit
[1:27:31] both of in one Pentecostal Fremont back
[1:27:34] except who and I never thought it so I
[1:27:39] call the pastor up I said hey I'm
[1:27:41] excited I want to come to your church I
[1:27:42] mean I just got to the Air Force Base he
[1:27:44] said we'll have a car there for you in
[1:27:45] the morning don't worry I'll come pick
[1:27:46] you up and we're taking so I started
[1:27:47] going to the Pentecostal Free Will
[1:27:49] Baptist Church and I decided I want to
[1:27:51] sing in the choir because we're nearing
[1:27:52] destroy I wanted that I wanted that
[1:27:54] experience so I'm standing up singing in
[1:27:57] a choir one day at the Pentecostal Free
[1:27:59] Will Baptist Church and I got a little
[1:28:00] happy and I started clapping my hands to
[1:28:02] the song and two guys on either side of
[1:28:04] me grabbed my hands and put it on my
[1:28:05] side say we don't do that here I said we
[1:28:08] don't know I said I'm in the wrong place
[1:28:15] so I realized then they were more
[1:28:17] Baptist than Pentecostal no matter what
[1:28:20] they said so I had a couple buddies that
[1:28:23] I admit in in in in the military and the
[1:28:25] service they're in the Air Force one of
[1:28:27] them was I called him big bill and the
[1:28:28] other was a little bill because the
[1:28:29] reason they did that one was big one's a
[1:28:30] little but big bill and go bill there
[1:28:33] they called me one day and said hey
[1:28:35] we're going to revival meeting over at
[1:28:36] the Church of God wouldn't want to come
[1:28:37] with us I said sure I'll come with you
[1:28:38] so went over the revival meeting that
[1:28:40] night at the Church of God and something
[1:28:45] got ahold of my life like I never had
[1:28:46] before I receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:28:50] Ghost I had a powerful experience that
[1:28:54] night the altar there netilat Church
[1:28:57] come away from there again a different
[1:28:59] man different than what I was before I
[1:29:02] couldn't I couldn't just believe it all
[1:29:04] but I had that experience and I knew it
[1:29:07] was real I remember brother Branham
[1:29:08] singing a message called the great
[1:29:09] coming revival and outpouring of the
[1:29:11] Holy Spirit in Chicago in 1954 he said
[1:29:14] look the Holy Spirit when he has come he
[1:29:16] will lead and guide you into all truth
[1:29:19] and will show you things to come from
[1:29:24] that time I've watched the hand of God
[1:29:26] from the Baptist Church to the
[1:29:29] Pentecostal church to the oneness church
[1:29:33] to the message where I've landed not
[1:29:38] looking for anything else
[1:29:39] believe I got everything God's got for
[1:29:42] this generation and for this time I was
[1:29:47] excited I was on fire
[1:29:49] I had fire shut up in my bones i sat
[1:29:52] down and I wrote my mom and dad a letter
[1:29:54] I said dear Mom and Dad I prayed over
[1:29:57] God dear Mom and Dad
[1:29:59] you got to quit your smoking quit your
[1:30:01] drinking put your cussing you got to
[1:30:04] repent and give your heart to Jesus
[1:30:06] Christ and start going to church love
[1:30:07] butch
[1:30:10] I put that in Volvo I put a step on it
[1:30:15] I leave my hands on and I prayed over I
[1:30:17] said God a North this letter let it be a
[1:30:19] blessing to them God move on their
[1:30:21] hearts Lord in Jesus name I set it off
[1:30:23] well mom would write me every week mom
[1:30:25] had impeccable handwriting they used to
[1:30:27] hire her from companies where we lived
[1:30:30] up in Michigan to write out their
[1:30:32] invitations to sales and things like
[1:30:34] that because her handwriting was just
[1:30:35] beautiful every week I'd get this
[1:30:37] beautiful handwriting from a week went
[1:30:39] by two weeks went by all of a sudden
[1:30:41] this letter comes at us now mom's
[1:30:43] handwriting as a dad I said to really
[1:30:48] got to the core of it so I open his
[1:30:50] letter up it didn't even say dear just
[1:30:52] said push don't bother to come home you
[1:30:57] make up your own bed dad well I was
[1:31:02] Christ you know sometimes you do
[1:31:05] everything you feel is right you try
[1:31:07] everything you feel is right and all of
[1:31:09] a sudden it doesn't work right
[1:31:22] hello one two three
[1:31:24] god bless you nice to meet you we'll
[1:31:30] edit that but you see what were they
[1:31:36] don't come home but yeah yeah yeah I get
[1:31:40] that a lot
[1:31:49] sometimes you do everything you try
[1:31:52] everything you think it's just right it
[1:31:53] still doesn't work so I got a real
[1:31:56] lesson that day how not to treat your
[1:32:00] parents I remember one time when when I
[1:32:05] get this great revelation about
[1:32:06] Christmas I called him and I said don't
[1:32:11] you buy a thing for our kids we don't
[1:32:12] celebrate that he that holiday hold for
[1:32:17] wisdom God where's the whistle crushed
[1:32:20] him crushed him so they started getting
[1:32:22] around it
[1:32:23] Isaac had a birthday on the 28th of
[1:32:25] December has it every year by the way
[1:32:27] same date and so they wouldn't send any
[1:32:31] money for Christmas they'd send it for
[1:32:32] iyx birthday and say bye everybody a
[1:32:34] little something well years later I
[1:32:37] realized how stupid I was and that's not
[1:32:40] the right approach not the right
[1:32:41] attitude and I finally found out what
[1:32:43] the Prophet did and how he handled
[1:32:45] things and everything like that so I
[1:32:46] went to the mall I don't know we wasn't
[1:32:48] leaving her where it was I went to the
[1:32:50] mall and went up said I agree Santa
[1:32:51] Claus is lab and I had to take a picture
[1:32:56] and send it to mom and dad Happy
[1:32:59] Holidays to you know I figured but you
[1:33:01] know you get you get sometimes lopsided
[1:33:04] sometimes yet you get off-kilter
[1:33:06] sometimes you've got to learn that the
[1:33:09] Holy Spirit needs to really lead you and
[1:33:11] not you try to lead the oldest way
[1:33:13] because sometimes you can get totally
[1:33:16] out of the out of the will of God and
[1:33:17] out of the mind of God and it's a it's a
[1:33:19] terrible thing when you do that when
[1:33:21] you're doing you try to get ahead of God
[1:33:22] and again what's going on so he sent me
[1:33:27] this letter and I just crushed me and it
[1:33:29] was it was in February of 1962 I was 18
[1:33:35] years old when the Lord called me into
[1:33:38] the ministry never forget it I was so
[1:33:44] Wednesday night prayer meeting at our
[1:33:46] Church of God there in Goldsboro North
[1:33:48] Carolina and everyone was praying around
[1:33:50] the altar after service and I decided I
[1:33:53] was going to go upstairs and one of the
[1:33:54] Sunday
[1:33:54] school rooms and so I walked around went
[1:33:57] upstairs and there was a light about a
[1:33:59] block away or two blocks away there was
[1:34:01] a little street light that was shining
[1:34:03] had enough light in the room that I
[1:34:05] could see to get around the seats and
[1:34:07] everything so I didn't turn the light on
[1:34:08] but I I knelt down and I started praying
[1:34:10] there that night February 1962 and all
[1:34:16] of a sudden with my eyes closed the the
[1:34:18] the room just became illuminated like a
[1:34:21] pillar fire like a light great light was
[1:34:23] in this room well I remember the
[1:34:27] presence of God coming and I was praying
[1:34:28] and I started speaking in tongues and
[1:34:30] all of a sudden I started interpreting
[1:34:32] and I heard this voice say go do the
[1:34:35] work of an evangelist you go and I'll go
[1:34:37] with you
[1:34:39] and then after several minutes or
[1:34:42] whatever it was it kind of waned and
[1:34:44] went away I come down that night and I
[1:34:47] said I believe the Lord's called me to
[1:34:51] the Ministry well my pastor heard me
[1:34:52] telling big bill what had happened in
[1:34:55] the room and so he said we got the youth
[1:34:57] meeting this coming Saturday night I
[1:34:58] want you to preach let's find out if
[1:35:02] you're called or not I guess I buddy
[1:35:03] yeah we see what's going on so I I said
[1:35:05] sure yeah here I was I was ready to
[1:35:07] preach right I've been called for a half
[1:35:09] hour and sure so I learned from him I
[1:35:15] learned from his wife his wife the girl
[1:35:16] in the preacher and so I had about with
[1:35:19] her too I mean I I knew how she preached
[1:35:22] I knew who he preached in so I could
[1:35:23] vary between I could fall I'm sure so I
[1:35:25] went to the you went to the youth
[1:35:27] meeting and ever forget it what did he
[1:35:28] believe in that day it was in the
[1:35:29] fellowship hall of our church and and
[1:35:32] and the Pope was setting up here and
[1:35:34] they were back there did I do that again
[1:35:35] did I knock that off the game huh oh
[1:35:40] it's right down there would you pick it
[1:35:42] up for me sighs I'll tell you what we'll
[1:35:44] get rid of this put it right on there
[1:35:46] where it belongs
[1:35:54] I'm already kidding I'm only kidding you
[1:35:57] know that I'm sure you sure you know
[1:36:02] that not that didn't use me okay
[1:36:09] I'm telling you 74 even up here I can
[1:36:14] feel it so I'm in this youth meeting and
[1:36:18] they do the songs over there and I'm
[1:36:20] standing up there not preaching in the
[1:36:21] pulpit and and and I'm preaching away to
[1:36:24] the young people just going like a
[1:36:25] Gatling gun because that's what we did
[1:36:26] in the south we just we spit it out fast
[1:36:29] as we can spit it out and I'm saying it
[1:36:30] and all of a sudden I had an out-of-body
[1:36:32] experience and I remember stepping back
[1:36:35] from my body and watching me in the
[1:36:38] pulpit preaching and I was just going in
[1:36:41] a preaching and I stood back the other
[1:36:42] said is that me am I saying that I
[1:36:46] remember vividly I'm never doing it I
[1:36:49] was watching myself and I was standing
[1:36:50] there watching myself in after a few
[1:36:53] minutes I stepped back into my body and
[1:36:55] I went in to finish the service I never
[1:36:57] had that before never had a sense I
[1:36:59] don't believe but I had an out-of-body
[1:37:00] experience and I knew I knew that God
[1:37:04] had anointed I watched the anointing I
[1:37:06] knew what the anointing was because I
[1:37:09] had experience for myself firsthand I've
[1:37:11] never seen anything anything quite like
[1:37:13] that well it was in it was in January of
[1:37:18] 1963 that I first heard about William
[1:37:22] Branham January 1963 just before the
[1:37:27] seals were open there was a brother and
[1:37:30] sister Woodard that had come to two
[1:37:32] goals for North Carolina is set up a big
[1:37:34] tent and they were Church of God
[1:37:36] evangelist he would preach one night she
[1:37:38] would preach the next night and they set
[1:37:40] us down during the day young people and
[1:37:42] start talking about William Branham and
[1:37:44] how that he was a prophet of God and how
[1:37:46] that God was going to come to
[1:37:47] Jeffersonville he was going to come to
[1:37:48] Jefferson feel and God was going to
[1:37:50] reveal the revelation of the seven seals
[1:37:52] and I'll never forget they said we're
[1:37:53] gonna go early we're gonna get there
[1:37:55] every morning early we're gonna stand in
[1:37:56] line we're going to get
[1:37:57] see we're going too fast all week
[1:37:58] because we want to hear this revelation
[1:37:59] well that planted a seed in my heart
[1:38:03] that this must really be an important
[1:38:07] person in her being a woman preacher I
[1:38:11] thought later I thought about how in the
[1:38:13] world of could she but she may have quit
[1:38:16] preaching after that I don't know but it
[1:38:19] planted a seed in my life that I knew
[1:38:23] this must be a great man I got out of
[1:38:29] the Air Force in 1963 after two years
[1:38:36] with an honorable discharge I talked to
[1:38:40] my superiors and different ones about my
[1:38:42] ministry God had called me too I was
[1:38:44] already holding revival meetings around
[1:38:46] the state and different churches so they
[1:38:50] finally saw fit to let me out two years
[1:38:52] early with an honorable discharge so I
[1:38:54] could do what they called community
[1:38:56] services a looting for community
[1:39:01] services
[1:39:03] your community I'm yeah I'm giving you a
[1:39:06] service no that's and and I did I got
[1:39:09] out and started rate right away with the
[1:39:12] full-time ministry preaching and going
[1:39:15] around and doing those things one of the
[1:39:17] one of the meetings that we had there
[1:39:22] one of my revival meetings it was I
[1:39:25] think it's Smithfield North Carolina
[1:39:28] we've been having you know when you had
[1:39:30] revivals back in those days you didn't
[1:39:32] have Friday Saturday and Sunday a
[1:39:34] weekend meeting or you know to service
[1:39:36] on Sunday where our special meetings
[1:39:37] this week okay we have a we're gonna
[1:39:40] have Sunday morning Sunday night Friday
[1:39:42] night Saturday night Sunday night sure
[1:39:44] we're gonna know that wasn't a revival
[1:39:47] that wasn't the meeting back then the
[1:39:49] meetings were four five six weeks they
[1:39:51] would go constantly I used to take a
[1:39:54] Monday night rest night so that people
[1:39:56] could go to the grocery store and get
[1:39:57] their groceries and do their laundry and
[1:39:59] get caught up on things around the house
[1:40:00] because they've been to church every
[1:40:02] night of the week so we were in the
[1:40:06] middle of that revival and God was
[1:40:07] really moving people were giving coming
[1:40:09] to the Lord giving the hearts to God and
[1:40:10] I remember I went out for a lunch and
[1:40:13] one of the Deacons home or one of the
[1:40:15] trustees home I can't remember what it
[1:40:17] wasn't invited me over for lunch so
[1:40:19] we're dinner Sunday afternoon and I was
[1:40:20] standing in his living room and there
[1:40:23] was a door here the kitchen was back in
[1:40:25] that part of the house and everybody had
[1:40:26] gone back down I was standing a living
[1:40:28] room looking looking in a mirror the
[1:40:30] culture was in front of men are just
[1:40:31] standing looking here and all of a
[1:40:32] sudden an open vision broke in front of
[1:40:35] me and instead of that mirror I was
[1:40:38] looking at the service and there were
[1:40:41] people all around the altar they were
[1:40:43] praying everywhere people were crying
[1:40:45] and the Holy Spirit was moving and I
[1:40:47] remember looking up at the clock on the
[1:40:49] walnut said 12:00 midnight and all of a
[1:40:52] sudden the vision went away boom there
[1:40:53] was the mirror there was a couch there
[1:40:55] was a living room and people started
[1:40:56] coming back in I've never had one before
[1:40:59] or since but I know what it was now to
[1:41:05] have an open vision it wasn't too many
[1:41:08] nights later two or three nights later
[1:41:09] exactly what I saw that day came to pass
[1:41:13] in that revival me
[1:41:15] because god no lie his word is always
[1:41:19] the truth
[1:41:20] that's why brother banner can have such
[1:41:22] confidence when god's shouldering those
[1:41:24] things to speak it
[1:41:25] that's thus saith the lord because god
[1:41:27] don't lie so one of the meetings that we
[1:41:35] had in north carolina i'm sorry i'm
[1:41:36] taking so long
[1:41:37] I won't take I won't take long ger than
[1:41:41] I and I take but I'd met a couple an
[1:41:47] older couple there was a brother and
[1:41:48] sister would I believe West's brother
[1:41:52] sister Wes was their name they were the
[1:41:54] Church of God that I was preaching at
[1:41:55] and so they had a son who was in the Air
[1:41:57] Force he was in Madison Wisconsin and he
[1:42:00] was a pastor of a church in Madison
[1:42:02] Wisconsin he was stationed there and I
[1:42:03] guess on a full-time pretty full-time
[1:42:05] basis but he pastored a a Church of God
[1:42:07] and so they said I think my son would be
[1:42:09] interested in you coming up there so
[1:42:11] they gave him my address and and gave
[1:42:14] him my address so I was in back in
[1:42:17] Michigan but this time and at Mom's
[1:42:18] house and I got a letter from this
[1:42:20] brother West who was in the service over
[1:42:22] there Madison said I want you to come
[1:42:23] and hold me a revival
[1:42:25] so Church of God I said that's good so I
[1:42:28] went through Madison Wisconsin in I
[1:42:31] think was February of 64 that he invited
[1:42:35] me I went and we went at crazy times I
[1:42:37] know but went up there I think was
[1:42:38] February of 1964 that that I went to
[1:42:42] went to Madison Wisconsin and preached
[1:42:48] brother West a revival meeting at that
[1:42:53] time and there's where I met sister
[1:42:54] Loretta her brother Virgil used to come
[1:42:57] there to the church and he called her up
[1:43:00] and said this this evangelist is over
[1:43:01] here he's a great guys great preacher he
[1:43:03] got to come in here him so I was sitting
[1:43:05] on a platform one night waiting for
[1:43:07] service to start and all of a sudden he
[1:43:09] she got off on work she caught a cab she
[1:43:11] came in Brigid was with her and I looked
[1:43:13] at her I said whoa my heart sunk
[1:43:17] I said this has got to be the most
[1:43:19] beautiful woman I've ever met in all my
[1:43:22] life and I'm gonna marry her it was love
[1:43:26] at first right sight I fell in love with
[1:43:33] her I said lord I I've never seen
[1:43:37] anything such such a beautiful but I'd
[1:43:39] been told by her brother that her dad
[1:43:41] where she went to church across town was
[1:43:44] a oneness preacher independent Jesus
[1:43:48] name
[1:43:48] oneness preacher and they didn't believe
[1:43:51] in the Trinity they believed in Jesus
[1:43:53] only baptism in the name of the Lord
[1:43:55] Jesus Christ
[1:43:57] well that wasn't gonna work with her in
[1:43:59] that church and me and Church of God so
[1:44:03] I decided to have a little serious
[1:44:06] conversation with Loretta so the first
[1:44:10] time I met her was that night I walked
[1:44:13] back from the platform after we preached
[1:44:15] she was standing in the back with her
[1:44:17] brother and I walked up to her and the
[1:44:18] first thing I said to her sugar Hanson
[1:44:21] now what's this stuff about one God
[1:44:23] great way to start a relationship she
[1:44:30] she said excuse me you know I could kind
[1:44:33] of already she's so precious and so you
[1:44:36] know during the course of this meeting
[1:44:39] her dad and mom and her brother start
[1:44:42] comes you have eight brothers seven of
[1:44:44] them were still at home and started
[1:44:45] coming the revival meeting you had two
[1:44:47] sisters they started to come to revival
[1:44:48] meeting and all of a sudden her dad who
[1:44:50] was this one this preacher had this one
[1:44:52] that stirred invited me a Trinitarian
[1:44:54] Church of God to come over to his church
[1:44:56] and hold him a revival oh this is
[1:45:01] strange but I got to get this girl so I
[1:45:06] said sure I really didn't need to pray
[1:45:09] about that Loretta went to that church
[1:45:11] that's where I need to go so I said I'll
[1:45:14] be over there about three weeks later
[1:45:16] four weeks later I went to Madison to
[1:45:19] her dad's Church but I stayed with
[1:45:21] brother West because I didn't know these
[1:45:23] one of those people you know I knew
[1:45:26] brother West he was he was he was a
[1:45:27] brother he was the air force man he was
[1:45:29] he was my so I stayed with brother West
[1:45:32] in trinitarian brother and I held them a
[1:45:34] revival across town well like I said
[1:45:37] revivals didn't last you know just a
[1:45:38] week or two we probably went for weeks
[1:45:40] there with their dad name and the whole
[1:45:41] time that were there the whole first
[1:45:44] time were there I started studying the
[1:45:46] the Godhead because I wanted to show her
[1:45:49] I had to show her where she was wrong
[1:45:51] here I go again
[1:45:52] I had to short what she was wrong and I
[1:45:57] used to tell her she's sitting back
[1:45:58] there she'll tell you this is the truth
[1:45:59] I said I used to say if you join the
[1:46:01] Church of God this week we'll get
[1:46:03] married next week and we'll start
[1:46:05] traveling you can sing play the piano
[1:46:06] for me we can have a good time traveling
[1:46:07] for the Lord they should tell her that I
[1:46:09] need somebody to sing else who would
[1:46:11] play the piano that's the bottom line
[1:46:14] what more reason is there to want to
[1:46:17] marry a guy then he needs your piano
[1:46:19] playing and he needs your vocals I don't
[1:46:22] sing parts I don't sing any I don't have
[1:46:25] that gift to sing el tor or tenor I just
[1:46:28] don't do that I'm just got the big mouth
[1:46:30] I sing lead you will be the alto you
[1:46:34] would be the piano player I will be the
[1:46:36] leader of the whole so I started staying
[1:46:41] where dad gave me a track I never forget
[1:46:43] her dad gave me a track that he had was
[1:46:45] called the bread of life and it was all
[1:46:47] the Scriptures of the Godhead from
[1:46:50] Genesis all the way through the
[1:46:51] revelations and I took it because I knew
[1:46:54] well this will keep me from having to
[1:46:56] look all these things up so I started in
[1:46:58] this track and I started writing these
[1:47:00] scriptures down and I started going to
[1:47:01] them in the Bible and Cyrene is I gotta
[1:47:03] prove her wrong I got pretty well after
[1:47:04] about a week or two of that God gave me
[1:47:09] the revelation of the oneness of the guy
[1:47:12] and I started preaching it before the
[1:47:16] revival was over staying at brother
[1:47:19] West's house didn't go over real good he
[1:47:24] said what are you doing he said you said
[1:47:27] what what about this this there's one
[1:47:30] god stuff what are you doing I said I
[1:47:32] said well if you mean do I believe in
[1:47:34] one god yeah I believe in one God no I
[1:47:36] don't believe in three anyway he told me
[1:47:39] in his house I said you believe in three
[1:47:41] said yeah I believe in through your
[1:47:42] father
[1:47:43] holder go I said well I guess the
[1:47:45] difference I believe when I get to
[1:47:46] heaven I'm gonna see why so I'm gonna
[1:47:47] see three big people up there well he
[1:47:51] came to me later I apologize I want you
[1:47:52] know but he was upset you know because I
[1:47:54] was going with not dating I was enjoying
[1:47:58] the company of this of this other one
[1:48:02] this girl so by the end of the revival
[1:48:05] when they revival closed we had a big
[1:48:07] baptismal and I was the first one in the
[1:48:09] water to get baptized the Evangelist got
[1:48:14] baptized first I preached myself right
[1:48:18] into the altar and right into the
[1:48:20] revelation gave my heart to the Lord
[1:48:26] all over again got baptized in the name
[1:48:28] of the Lord Jesus Christ and started
[1:48:30] going out preaching among the oneness
[1:48:32] churches then well finally it was quite
[1:48:37] a time I'd done all of that I preached
[1:48:40] all in weeks and and I hit the I hit the
[1:48:42] water
[1:48:43] her dad actually her dad went on to go
[1:48:47] to a brother bands meeting down in
[1:48:48] Jeffersonville and they when they did
[1:48:50] the marriage and divorce series at the
[1:48:51] high school down there he attended those
[1:48:54] that series of meeting so he got
[1:48:56] acquainted with brother branham's
[1:48:57] ministry quite well and he brought back
[1:48:58] a little 45 album I don't know if any of
[1:49:00] you remember those but that's the first
[1:49:01] time I heard brother Brandon was on a 45
[1:49:03] album they had his voice on there and
[1:49:07] his ministry on there so that was the
[1:49:09] first time I got to hear and well I kept
[1:49:11] working with sister Loretta Ann's trying
[1:49:12] to convince her with everything inside
[1:49:16] of me that she should marry her be the
[1:49:17] best thing she ever done in her life
[1:49:20] after several months I think I finally
[1:49:23] convinced her that she she loved me
[1:49:28] it wasn't easy guys
[1:49:31] I would I would be out in meetings and
[1:49:33] she would write me letters and say this
[1:49:34] is never going to work or two we're
[1:49:36] incompatible we're too different it's
[1:49:38] never gonna work I take a money a night
[1:49:40] off like I did a lot of times in my
[1:49:41] revival I Drive for hours to come and
[1:49:44] see her and be there when she got off
[1:49:45] work and she'd walk out of Martinelli's
[1:49:46] market she said what are you doing here
[1:49:49] duh what don't we have an on D or
[1:49:53] something what's going on here you know
[1:49:56] she wasn't easy on me but I had
[1:50:00] perseverance brothers they got a
[1:50:03] persevere finally I said wilt thou and
[1:50:09] she wilted and we got married during the
[1:50:13] fourth mark that down Jude the fourth in
[1:50:16] 1965 I went to pick her up one day a
[1:50:21] couple days and few days before we got
[1:50:22] married I never forget I went to pick
[1:50:24] her up and they said she's not here I
[1:50:27] said worry she said well we saw her
[1:50:28] walking down the road strange you know
[1:50:30] so I drove down the road and I come up
[1:50:32] to a place down where the highway wasn't
[1:50:35] everything and she was in a phone booth
[1:50:36] making a phone call and she was just
[1:50:39] coming out I pulled up I said what
[1:50:40] you're doing is that I was trying to
[1:50:41] call brother Branham just see if we
[1:50:43] should get married but he wasn't home
[1:50:48] he's out in a meeting sister media told
[1:50:50] her he wasn't there I said you don't
[1:50:53] have to worry about it honey
[1:50:54] I got this no problem at all it's the
[1:50:58] will of God don't you worry about it
[1:51:01] so she's been worried about her no she
[1:51:03] hadn't worried about it Santa
[1:51:06] so we finally got gotten got those
[1:51:09] things resolved and got married and we
[1:51:13] went on our honeymoon we we decided
[1:51:15] we're gonna drive over here to Cleveland
[1:51:16] we've done a lot of preaching in the
[1:51:18] Cleveland area and oneness movements
[1:51:20] over there independent Jesus named
[1:51:21] churches and brother there was a brother
[1:51:23] Deaton over there they had a church he
[1:51:24] was an old snake handler from down south
[1:51:26] at snake bites on his hands where the
[1:51:28] snakes is a bit there before him he was
[1:51:29] an old-timer and he had a son he had a
[1:51:33] son named Danny Danny Deaton Danny gave
[1:51:35] his heart to the Lord and in a revival
[1:51:37] meetings there and he's a pastor over
[1:51:39] there today I think in the UPC church
[1:51:41] he's still over there pastoring good a
[1:51:43] great great man of God I love him with
[1:51:45] all my heart and we went around around
[1:51:47] about about this message he was set for
[1:51:49] hours and talked and he just couldn't
[1:51:51] see it and I said well I'm not here to
[1:51:53] give you a revelation by any means so
[1:51:54] he's a good brother he loves the Lord
[1:51:56] but I appreciate him and I just pray for
[1:51:58] him they got that'll help him you know
[1:52:00] and gotta lead him and guide him and
[1:52:01] direct him so we got married in 1965 and
[1:52:05] we went on a honeymoon and I preached I
[1:52:07] preached on our honeymoon
[1:52:09] well the Dayton fell down I was in town
[1:52:11] I was there on a Sunday morning he said
[1:52:13] you're preaching this morning brothers
[1:52:17] young people kids guys if God's called
[1:52:20] you to preach probably not a real good
[1:52:23] thing to do it on your honeymoon but we
[1:52:27] haven't stopped since that day it's been
[1:52:32] our life it's been our goal everything
[1:52:35] we do but I got enough money by
[1:52:37] preaching here that Sunday to go to
[1:52:39] Niagara Falls we hadn't planned to go on
[1:52:40] the hanger Falls that that's that was a
[1:52:42] big deal you know so they said why don't
[1:52:44] you go to Niagara Falls just down the
[1:52:45] road here so I got that money went to
[1:52:47] Niagara Falls and we had a great time at
[1:52:49] that in Falls we got pictures you know
[1:52:51] it was freezing it was so cold and it
[1:52:54] still in June it was cold
[1:52:56] the flowers weren't blooming yet or
[1:52:57] anything like that it was it was cold
[1:52:58] but we went we went to Niagara Falls we
[1:53:01] could see we're there we took pictures
[1:53:02] yeah I remember taking pictures and she
[1:53:03] all the money we had in the world was in
[1:53:05] her purse and she left her purse sitting
[1:53:06] by the side of Nagra Falls while we went
[1:53:08] off walking somewhere
[1:53:12] everything we've had was in there we
[1:53:14] would have been Niagara Falls residents
[1:53:16] if she hadn't found it but we went back
[1:53:18] there after I don't know half-hour or
[1:53:20] whatever it was we went back to her and
[1:53:22] it was still sitting there untouched so
[1:53:27] we were we're very thankful for that
[1:53:29] so we went there got to go there got to
[1:53:31] got to enjoy that and they had they had
[1:53:34] blessed us when we got married they had
[1:53:41] given us a car
[1:53:42] brother brother the Indians sisters
[1:53:46] husband and her in her had given us a
[1:53:49] 1955 Chevrolet those were great cars at
[1:53:52] a 1955 Chevrolet but they had they had
[1:53:54] problems with the headlights they would
[1:53:55] rust out he ever know anything well our
[1:53:57] device generally and and and we had we
[1:54:00] had what I call the UFO light because we
[1:54:05] had it we had it tied together with
[1:54:06] baling wire
[1:54:07] trying to hold on the headlights one
[1:54:09] light would shine right up in the trees
[1:54:11] and the other went right down the side
[1:54:14] of the road that's the truth it's a
[1:54:18] truth I called him he left all night
[1:54:20] well we could get by pretty good on the
[1:54:23] road ones because we would you when you
[1:54:24] see the edge of the road with that light
[1:54:26] that was going along to hearts then
[1:54:27] finally the door lash over here and the
[1:54:30] passenger side after john paul was born
[1:54:31] the door wouldn't shut anymore so we had
[1:54:34] to tie the door shut it wouldn't latch
[1:54:36] anymore way to tie the door shot and we
[1:54:38] had to untie it and get out and tie it
[1:54:39] and get in when we got in so once John
[1:54:42] Paul was born he was born in 1966 he was
[1:54:44] born in Ann Arbor Michigan we decided
[1:54:46] you know what we had better do something
[1:54:48] about a vehicle because this is not
[1:54:50] going to work what if he's out there
[1:54:51] someday and it happens you know the door
[1:54:53] would fly open and and some you know you
[1:54:55] see this loop there works John Paul II
[1:54:57] he's gone
[1:55:01] so I don't remember what we got what we
[1:55:03] decided we had to do something and we
[1:55:05] were just you know our life was just
[1:55:06] that it just it was it was the grace of
[1:55:09] God that kept things going along John
[1:55:12] John Paul was born in 66 and April and
[1:55:14] Sharon come along in 1968 she was born
[1:55:18] in May of 1968 and so it was about 71 we
[1:55:22] moved to Lima area and that's where
[1:55:24] Isaac was born in 1972 Isaac was born in
[1:55:27] Lima Ohio got to meet all the people
[1:55:29] down there and it was that winter
[1:55:31] I think of 72 that we had our first
[1:55:34] youth banquet ever down there and people
[1:55:36] came from all around Indiana different
[1:55:38] places
[1:55:38] brother Neville's daughters came up from
[1:55:40] Jeffersonville I remember the big youth
[1:55:42] banquet I loved it we did two years in a
[1:55:44] row we did it one year in Lima next year
[1:55:46] and Wapakoneta and that's where we got
[1:55:48] it started through that through the
[1:55:49] through the country and this time that
[1:55:51] now they got them everywhere they got
[1:55:52] youth banquets that go to all the young
[1:55:53] people we ever had nothing like that
[1:55:55] until we in the message I'm talking
[1:55:58] about back in those days until we we
[1:55:59] decided to have our own we started those
[1:56:01] and then the camps began to come along
[1:56:03] and God began to bless our lives we
[1:56:11] moved to Illinois in 1974 I think it was
[1:56:19] we started working in a coffee house a
[1:56:21] little little ministry storefront where
[1:56:25] you work with kids on drugs and kids off
[1:56:27] the street we go in there and Friday
[1:56:30] Saturday night and take our guitars and
[1:56:32] instruments so we play music and sing
[1:56:33] and kids would drop off the street we
[1:56:35] had we put we started a 24-hour love
[1:56:38] line we called it the love line and we
[1:56:41] put it in our house
[1:56:42] and we put brochures all over the city
[1:56:45] if you're depressed if you're thinking
[1:56:47] about suicide if you've got problems
[1:56:48] call call it well we'd get calls in our
[1:56:50] home my kids tell me about it still at
[1:56:52] all hours of the night people would call
[1:56:54] and say I'm gonna get him inside suicide
[1:56:56] I'm gonna do this order that what you
[1:56:58] said why would anybody do that because
[1:56:59] we loved him we wanted to help and my
[1:57:02] motto was if I could help somebody even
[1:57:06] if I could just get them off in drugs
[1:57:09] if they never came to my church if they
[1:57:11] never saw what I'm saying
[1:57:12] I remember going as a senior in high
[1:57:15] school in Oklahoma I remember going to
[1:57:18] my first gospel concert ever
[1:57:19] and and the Brotherhood man was supposed
[1:57:22] to be there by the name of Tony Fontaine
[1:57:23] he was a great recording artist at that
[1:57:25] time I guess and his dad had passed away
[1:57:27] they couldn't come and a little lady
[1:57:28] come called door seekers came to that
[1:57:31] meeting and sing that dance she sang a
[1:57:33] song that said if I can help somebody as
[1:57:38] I pass along then my living shall not be
[1:57:47] in vain that's stuck in my heart and
[1:57:54] from that that we came my mold of him I
[1:57:56] Drive God if I can just help somebody I
[1:58:01] can't give him a revelation but you know
[1:58:04] we had several young people that came to
[1:58:05] the church came and went on with God
[1:58:08] because of those little meetings if we
[1:58:10] can just help somebody as we pass along
[1:58:14] 1976 was the was the year of the
[1:58:18] Centennial Bicentennial was it 1976 I
[1:58:20] think it was and we had a big old school
[1:58:23] bus we painted blue
[1:58:24] we rolled on the side of it what are we
[1:58:28] right on the side of it Jesus Saves I
[1:58:29] think we put on the side of it we put a
[1:58:31] sound system in it speakers on the
[1:58:33] outside set of drums in the air so I
[1:58:35] like to play the drums and Paul was
[1:58:36] playing the guitar and they were singing
[1:58:37] going down the road in the Bicentennial
[1:58:39] parade they were singing gospel songs
[1:58:41] and come to come to the the the
[1:58:44] storefront come to the coffeehouse we're
[1:58:46] gonna have meetings tonight we're gonna
[1:58:47] have a good time just things we did
[1:58:49] crazy things we did because we love
[1:58:52] people that was a big thing back in
[1:58:55] their 70s and we wanted to help
[1:59:00] so finally we Bicentennial year we got
[1:59:04] it called us through a series of things
[1:59:06] oh my I could tell you there's so many
[1:59:08] things I could tell you but it's time to
[1:59:09] go so many things that I could tell you
[1:59:11] well it's time to go on
[1:59:12] but anyways I thought about the
[1:59:19] coffeehouse and the things that that God
[1:59:21] led us into for thereon but it wasn't it
[1:59:22] was in there 19 1990 1976 that we
[1:59:26] started traveling full time we live we
[1:59:29] left our things and storage there in you
[1:59:33] know in the basement of a church there
[1:59:34] and Rockford Illinois and we started
[1:59:37] traveling full-time across the United
[1:59:39] States and Canada seven and a half years
[1:59:43] we traveled full-time two years out of
[1:59:46] those seven and a half years we didn't
[1:59:48] even have a home everything was in
[1:59:50] storage during those two years and we
[1:59:53] had no home we just kept going from
[1:59:56] place to place revival to revival meet
[1:59:58] and we had a great time and we meet new
[2:00:00] people and go on the road and this one
[2:00:02] to recommend another brother we'd go on
[2:00:03] the road if we didn't have anywhere to
[2:00:04] go we'd go visit mom and dad hey thought
[2:00:08] you might want to see us having been
[2:00:09] around for a while so we're here - how
[2:00:11] are you saying well students I can get
[2:00:13] my next meeting book we'll be leaving
[2:00:14] but nice to had moment is so we ended up
[2:00:20] we ended up traveling that long and then
[2:00:24] 1979 sherry was born we're living in
[2:00:29] Tucson and she kind of just added to our
[2:00:32] group about two and a half years old
[2:00:34] three years old she started singing and
[2:00:38] heading south saying it's a sin but she
[2:00:41] she didn't like traveling when the Sun
[2:00:44] went down sherry would just freak out
[2:00:47] when the Sun was going down time out
[2:00:50] time out time out down on Mount a steel
[2:00:52] in the word motel I melt down la mode I
[2:00:55] want motels you doing shut out you know
[2:00:59] we would do all night in the van we'd
[2:01:01] travel all night we'd go everywhere
[2:01:02] everything we do a motel on my
[2:01:04] non-dominant at Cal then it started to
[2:01:09] get expensive when you had to stop and
[2:01:11] get Terry a motel every night it was we
[2:01:13] learned what that was all about for sure
[2:01:15] but we sang at youth meetings and sang a
[2:01:17] camps all over Georgia Ohio Michigan
[2:01:18] Louisiana Arizona and we just because we
[2:01:22] had a genuine love for the for the youth
[2:01:24] I usually always tell young people true
[2:01:26] there's two things about young people
[2:01:27] that I like to establish with them first
[2:01:29] of all first thing is there's not two
[2:01:31] messages there's only one message
[2:01:34] there's not a message for the adults and
[2:01:36] a message for the young people it's one
[2:01:38] message and we've got to believe a
[2:01:40] church whether we're young or whether
[2:01:42] we're old God sent a message he gave a
[2:01:44] message for us to believe there's in the
[2:01:53] spring of 64 I got to back up that God
[2:01:57] gave me a dream about brother Branham I
[2:01:59] never was in his meetings I never got to
[2:02:03] go because I was holding revivals he was
[2:02:05] holding meetings I guess I just didn't
[2:02:08] realize the importance the spring of
[2:02:12] 1964 God gave me a dream and in that
[2:02:14] dream I was with brother Branham in an
[2:02:16] auditorium we were we were back in the
[2:02:18] vestibule the front of the auditorium
[2:02:20] and we were talking brother Branham I
[2:02:22] was standing there talking I'll never
[2:02:23] forget it and I remember I can't
[2:02:27] remember the subject I can't remember
[2:02:28] what we were saying but I remember
[2:02:30] hearing on the loudspeaker where brother
[2:02:31] Branham please come to the platform it's
[2:02:33] time for you to speak and he looked at
[2:02:36] me and he said brother I've got to go
[2:02:37] now they're calling for me and I said
[2:02:40] that's fine brother Branham I remember
[2:02:42] him going back toward the back headed
[2:02:43] back to the back I went in the
[2:02:44] auditorium went up in the balcony and I
[2:02:46] sit down he came out on the platform a
[2:02:48] little little man that he was he started
[2:02:51] preaching the word and all of a sudden
[2:02:53] the Holy Spirit spoke to me and said
[2:02:55] hear ye him
[2:02:57] that's my Elisha
[2:03:03] do you think there's anything in the
[2:03:05] world that's gonna get me to deny that
[2:03:10] or say that's not right or he's wrong
[2:03:13] I'm not gonna say that that's his Elijah
[2:03:15] I found out who he is I didn't
[2:03:19] understand everything I couldn't
[2:03:21] understand the message and things he was
[2:03:22] preaching a lot of times I matter of
[2:03:23] fact I preached I preached unto serpents
[2:03:25] heap of the bill for a year before I
[2:03:27] realized twins were born from treated
[2:03:29] for mothers the light bulb hadn't gone
[2:03:33] off yet funny when the light bulb went
[2:03:34] off all that makes it more simple it's
[2:03:38] not important if you understand it do
[2:03:42] you believe there's a lot of things I
[2:03:46] may not understand but I believe I
[2:03:48] believe God sent a prophet for me I'm
[2:03:53] gonna hear you him just like the the
[2:03:54] word said that day this is my Elijah
[2:03:57] here you him and from that moment on I
[2:04:00] started hearing him and so we're in
[2:04:02] these meetings and going on and that
[2:04:07] meeting the me just the second thing I
[2:04:12] tell young people feed your experience
[2:04:15] don't just go to camps and go to special
[2:04:17] meetings and have an alter experience
[2:04:19] and never feed it you got to read your
[2:04:20] Bible every day you got to pray put your
[2:04:23] nose on the book find out what he said
[2:04:24] because you're young men are gonna be
[2:04:26] leaders someday you're gonna have a
[2:04:27] family
[2:04:28] you've got Terry's you're gonna be the
[2:04:30] husband you're gonna be the one bob says
[2:04:34] the wife desires to know anything let
[2:04:35] her ask her husband at home what are you
[2:04:37] gonna do when your wife comes to you
[2:04:38] start asking you questions my wife did
[2:04:42] come to me one day and said where was
[2:04:46] where was Adam when the serpent was
[2:04:48] beguiling Eve I said I don't know thank
[2:04:58] God I'm not sure where he was
[2:05:00] yeah it's questions they're gonna ask
[2:05:03] you questions and you better know what's
[2:05:05] in that message because you're gonna
[2:05:08] have to answer the questions put your
[2:05:11] nose in the book listen to the tape
[2:05:13] here what God had to say he spoke to you
[2:05:16] in this generation and he wants you to
[2:05:19] hear it for sure many of our young
[2:05:21] people going on to be preachers already
[2:05:24] in this message and many more will come
[2:05:26] and be deacons and trustees and song
[2:05:28] leaders and in the women we come wise
[2:05:31] maybe you're gonna be a pastor's wife or
[2:05:33] a deacons wife or a trustee is what you
[2:05:36] need to learn what you believe and why
[2:05:40] you believe it because you need to give
[2:05:41] a be able to give an answer for the hope
[2:05:42] that lieth within you let me try to wrap
[2:05:48] this up with a 1983 we moved to Canada
[2:05:53] and I started pastoring the church up
[2:05:56] there in Ontario and once I once I got
[2:06:03] there I realized and I'm gonna close
[2:06:05] this in about ten minutes guys once I
[2:06:09] got there I realized that you know it
[2:06:10] wasn't good enough to try and put the
[2:06:14] you know that's somebody else answer I
[2:06:15] used to I traveled in evangelist you
[2:06:17] somebody statements like people ask me
[2:06:19] questions so we'll ask her pastor that's
[2:06:22] the easy way out for the evangelist ask
[2:06:24] your pastor but I realized I couldn't do
[2:06:28] that no more I was the pastor that was
[2:06:31] scary it was scary I remember one time I
[2:06:36] was preaching from brother who had gone
[2:06:38] overseas and I was taking his services
[2:06:41] for him and a brother come to me after
[2:06:43] service said can I talk to you and I
[2:06:44] said sure so we went to the office and
[2:06:47] we sit down here sigh I need to talk to
[2:06:49] you something need your advice I said ok
[2:06:52] this is one time I was going to give my
[2:06:54] advice he said 20 years ago when I was
[2:06:59] younger I murdered my best friend I
[2:07:03] killed him I was drunk and nobody knows
[2:07:07] it what should I do
[2:07:13] you know what I told him ask your pastor
[2:07:17] when he gets home and I'm so thankful I
[2:07:20] could do that sometimes we think we're
[2:07:24] somebody we're not anybody it's only the
[2:07:27] grace of God that keeps us going
[2:07:30] but he was convicted and God was
[2:07:33] speaking to his heart and I said I know
[2:07:36] there's an answer but I said you need to
[2:07:38] talk to your pastor and get his advice
[2:07:40] and do what he says but now I was
[2:07:44] pastoring I got down in my bedroom floor
[2:07:48] I locked the door I told my wife I said
[2:07:50] to rather don't bother me if I never
[2:07:52] come out of this bedroom don't bother me
[2:07:54] I got down on my knees and I put my
[2:07:58] Bible in front of and I said god I need
[2:08:01] answers and I need him now and I'm not
[2:08:06] leaving this room until you speak to me
[2:08:09] I said I hear brother Jelani Jenkins I
[2:08:14] hear brother Bissell I hear these other
[2:08:16] preachers preaching all over the place
[2:08:17] and they're they've gotten revelation
[2:08:19] they're preaching things that I don't
[2:08:20] understand God I need to know what's
[2:08:24] going on I started reading a little
[2:08:28] message that I had laying there and all
[2:08:31] of a sudden God dropped the revelation
[2:08:33] in my heart and this word began to open
[2:08:36] up to me brother Branham said it's a new
[2:08:38] book brother let me tell you what it's a
[2:08:40] new book when God opens your eyes to it
[2:08:42] you can't see nothing but it God gave me
[2:08:46] a revelation right there on my knees in
[2:08:49] that bedroom I was so happy I didn't
[2:08:51] even have to miss supper I got to come
[2:08:54] out I got from God that day everything I
[2:08:58] needed to talk about this message listen
[2:09:04] friends this is real this isn't
[2:09:07] something fake this is the real genuine
[2:09:10] thing 1984-85 we started having youth
[2:09:14] camps we had the winter youth retreat up
[2:09:17] there several years in Canada that's
[2:09:18] where it started many years ago but the
[2:09:21] Lonnie brother Geoff Jenkins brother
[2:09:23] then Williams and all them used to come
[2:09:25] there and then went Dan and Dan down
[2:09:27] there and in in Louisiana and him and
[2:09:29] Tim decided they were gonna have a camp
[2:09:31] down there they called me on the phone
[2:09:32] said we want to have a Louisiana youth
[2:09:34] camp but we're not going to have it
[2:09:36] without you
[2:09:37] I said well you guys can do it no said
[2:09:39] we won't even do it if you don't come so
[2:09:40] first two years of Louisiana camp I went
[2:09:42] and preached there for them and helped
[2:09:44] them get it rolling well look what's
[2:09:45] happened their camps everywhere God is
[2:09:48] begin to move and begin to open up
[2:09:50] things for the young people and and and
[2:09:52] do things all over the place and I
[2:09:55] realized that the buck stops here I'm
[2:09:57] closing finally 487 somewhere in that
[2:10:02] area 88 we started having we started
[2:10:05] having marriage seminars I never forget
[2:10:09] the first one we had was on Toledo John
[2:10:12] Paul wasn't even married yet so he
[2:10:13] volunteered the baby said all the kids
[2:10:15] in his church so that his adult couples
[2:10:18] could come that that was hilarious Paul
[2:10:24] doesn't do well with babies so the next
[2:10:29] year he still wasn't married we had two
[2:10:30] in a row there in Toledo he still wasn't
[2:10:33] married the next year but he decided he
[2:10:34] wasn't gonna babysit anymore so he tried
[2:10:37] to sneak into the meeting I never forget
[2:10:41] it we're having this meeting we're
[2:10:44] talking to the couples and all of a
[2:10:45] sudden this janitor walks in the door
[2:10:47] with his monkey Dunkey hat on and he
[2:10:50] brings a ladder in he sets the ladder in
[2:10:52] the middle of the room he goes up like
[2:10:54] he's changing a light bulb I said what's
[2:10:59] going on and I said check this guy out
[2:11:02] so they went back he was Paul he had
[2:11:04] snuck into the meeting in disguise and
[2:11:06] was changed pretending like you wanted
[2:11:08] to hear about the couples things yeah so
[2:11:12] the couple guys got him scored him out
[2:11:14] of the room and we went on with our
[2:11:15] meeting and next thing I know the cook
[2:11:17] shows up in the back of the room with a
[2:11:19] mustache and a hat and he's standing
[2:11:22] back there and I said the is there
[2:11:24] something you needed and
[2:11:26] just want to be it I said that's not a
[2:11:29] cook he was Paul tried to sneak back
[2:11:33] into the meeting again hey hey this
[2:11:36] quarter-mile because these meetings are
[2:11:38] so good you want to be at a couple's me
[2:11:39] have you ever had one we had them all
[2:11:40] over the country after that we started
[2:11:42] to have a couple's meeting and
[2:11:43] everywhere we ever went so let me just
[2:11:45] let me stop we left Canada after about
[2:11:47] 75 years eight years start traveling
[2:11:50] again I think we cover about three years
[2:11:52] and then we moved to Arkansas and we
[2:11:54] stayed in Arkansas for about ten years

[2:12:38] Murfreesboro Tennessee for two and a
[2:12:39] half years and guess what when we moved
[2:12:48] from Murphy's world's 1/2 years ago I
[2:12:49] put an application in at a place for the
[2:12:52] two-bedroom with a garage so mom and I
[2:12:54] would have placed out of the cold
[2:12:55] it was handicapped accessible lower

[2:13:17] very far so anyways that's that's pretty
[2:13:20] much it now what the question I guess on
[2:13:23] my heart this morning as I close this is

[2:13:33] can I help you how can I be a blessing
[2:13:37] to you I don't know what the future
[2:13:44] holds Church we live in perilous times I
[2:13:46] look at the the storms the fires
[2:13:56] hurricanes I've never seen a day like
[2:14:03] this just seems like earthquakes one
[2:14:06] after another storm I believe we're
[2:14:09] living in the very edge of the coming of
[2:14:12] the Lord Jesus Christ I wouldn't want my
[2:14:14] lines tied up now I'd want to make sure
[2:14:17] everything was in order because just any
[2:14:21] day now our Lord is coming I don't want
[2:14:28] to miss it
[2:14:35] the key you don't get nothing else today

[2:15:01] most important thing in your life that
[2:15:05] you need to be sure of you may not

[2:15:15] that you know that you've been filled
[2:15:16] with the Holy Ghost and you're on your
[2:15:19] way to glory let me close by reading a
[2:15:26] scripture Romans 12 verses 1 and 2
[2:15:31] Romans 12 verses 1 and 2 speaks it like
[2:15:38] this I beseech you therefore brethren by
[2:15:41] the mercies of God that you present your
[2:15:45] bodies a living sacrifice holy
[2:15:46] acceptable unto God which is your
[2:15:50] reasonable service and be not conformed
[2:15:56] to this world but be transformed by the
[2:16:00] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[2:16:03] what is the good and acceptable and
[2:16:06] perfect will of God what about you
[2:16:15] I'm doing my part that I feel God wants
