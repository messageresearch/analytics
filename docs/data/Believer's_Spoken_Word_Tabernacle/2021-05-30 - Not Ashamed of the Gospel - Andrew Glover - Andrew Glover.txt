for a few moments amen and just have a few little housekeeping things to take care of before we just invite brother andrew out and i want to say it's just been really thankful for brother andrew and sister moriah that they would make the sacrifice to be here with us in these meetings and truly as brother andrew the lord used a brother friday and saturday it's really throughout that there was the statements that were made on friday night and then it continued to amplify even last night we're not gathered around a personality this message that god has sent to us god revealed himself to the prophet gave the revelation the word that need to be spoken and the same mighty angel that revealed himself to the prophet is the same mighty angel that's here with us revealing his word to our hearts we're not looking to any man to give me sense about the message no no no no no there's only one who has been lifted up in our midst and that's the lord jesus christ and that's what this message has done it has lifted up the lord jesus christ to draw the children of god into the place that god has ordained for them to be in him from before the foundation of the world amen and from this uniting from this time we go to that other land amen we receive the token for our destination and assurance that over there we are going over there we have a reservation that's already been made the reservation was already set before the foundation of the world amen when the lamb when the lamb was thought of we were in that thinking we are the sons of god who shouted for joy we know what we're shouting about we're shouting about the salvation of the lord of the lamb of what he has brought to our lives it's not a historical event it's a reality to us we were included we were in him we got up with him on that easter morning and now we are seated in power with him by the baptism of the holy ghost amen it's it's a reality that those things as god just continues to make that more and more real to you and i because god's desire in our in our lives in our walk is that our walk would not be dependent upon any mortal but our walk would be solely dependent upon him amen and he's faithful who's who began the good work to finish it amen as we've looked at it here in some of the sundays god doesn't set that i sit down and say oh boy i got into this this is this is bigger than what i can deal with no no god knows all he asks is us to surrender us yield god steps in when we surrender and he then comes and does through our yielding what he's already sown within our life amen so we just we just want to just i'm just so thankful about that it's god who's right here in our midst it's him who's leading us amen so we just i want to just as i said thank you to brother andrew and sister mariah for coming and i just really appreciate how brother brother andrew just yielded to the lord in his stand for this message and sister mariah how old is brother andrew 25 i i know i've asked that many different times because to me he don't preach like he's 25. you know i told him the other night and i got back to the office i said i think i'll just start carrying briefcases i'll charge you all those ipads for you just give me your ipad i'll charge them for you and get it set up for you know but i'm thankful how god has every unique gift in the body and god knew that you and i would need that it's just like when you think of you sisters and brothers when you go to do your landscaping or you decorate your home you need certain things of contrast and it causes other things to stand out and god has a god he's a god of variety god made us the way he wanted us and there's a certain way and a reason why god has us the way he has us all we need to do is just yield to what he's chosen to be amen and that's you know that's all god asks but well anyhow i just i just so appreciate the goodness of the lord i tell you i just i don't know i just love bathing in his presence and i want to say thank you to all the the visitors that have come to the meeting as well because truly you you came here because there's a hunger and a desire in your heart for more of god and we appreciate you coming it it it's it's real encouragement it means a means a whole lot to us and see different ones and make the sacrifice to be here and as you make sacrifices through the meeting it just it just means a whole lot just to look out there and just to see you so uh you're just i want you to know you're a blessing to us amen so also one thing right now uh where's also is brother shane back here with you or you're going to do the accountant too you think you need brother shane you all sure you don't need your wife's help because that your help mate and i know both of you what we need is i need just um for the young people we need a a head count here because of some of the activities and what we're planning right after church for the young people so we need a count because we're going

we're good amen so well we just want to turn our attention here to the word of the lord and and how many just enjoyed the presence of the lord the word of the lord amen and you remember you stand right there that even monday morning rolls around or even after the end of this service the things that god has inspired to your heart whether it's right there at your seat or whether you've come up for prayer brother braham you'll find him over and over he'll tell the people he said no satan is going to try to come back he said but you resist him and you resist him by that authority that god has placed in your heart amen god is faithful to his word so let's just let's just once again and just as god would just give us strength this morning and maybe we'll just have a word of prayer because i know we might be a little weary i know brother andrew but let's just let's just really ask god as we go to prayer here and just god that he will just come and just strengthen us for these few moments because i believe with all my heart god's not finished god is not finished at all there's work to be done and we want him to come amen heavenly father lord we thank you for these services lord they would be nothing but protractive meetings if it wasn't for you lord although we could lord ask lord as i ask brother andrew back at the first part of september for these meetings this year lord yet you already had them in your mind so we thank you lord that how that you deal with our hearts to influence us lord god in the ways to make decisions that is according to your will lord each and every

ghost i'm asking lord that you'll refill every one of our hearts lord i'm asking lord if there's any that are still sick in their body i'm asking lord god that father they would receive a divine touch

open up lord the channels and the thoughts you've given me this morning lord hold my mouth to anything i shouldn't say open it to that which would be done to you and we'll be to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory for it's in the wonderful name of our lord and savior jesus christ we pray and all the believers said amen and amen the book of mark the eighth chapter the 34th verse here and when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also he said unto them whosoever will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whoever whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospels the same shall save it for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation of him also shall the son of man be ashamed i in that isn't that something of him also shall the son of man be ashamed when he cometh glory of his father with the holy angels i also want to look this one with you in the book of romans the first chapter book of romans the first chapter here paul is going to pick up in romans 1 and he's going to use the same word that jesus uses there in mark 8. in romans 1 the chapter 1 and the 13th verse he said now i would not have you ignorant brethren that often i purpose to come unto you but was led hither too that i might have some fruit among you also even as among other gentiles i am a debtor both to the greeks and to the barbarians both to the wise and to the unwise so as much as in me as i am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at rome also now paul says this for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ amen could we say that together this morning i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god unto salvation notice here to everyone that believeth to the jew first and also to the greek amen we ask the lord this morning to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you may have your seats here this morning amen from those scriptures i would like to speak to you and if i will title this thought today i want to speak to you for a few moments here on unashamed of our identification unashamed of our identification and i was just recently listening to the tape the problem of god preaches in december of 1959 and he calls it identified with christ identified with christ and in the end of that sermon amen just to read this quote and maybe lay a foundation if that's okay he said we are standing in the shadow of the just justice of god every time that two or three are gathered together in the name of jesus christ he promised he would be in their midst now i don't know i guess part of the prayer cards is taken up some of you may still have them many of you don't even have prayer cards but it doesn't matter whether you have or whether you have not amen if you're sick you're sick and if you're if this god amen who wrote this bible then do you solemnly believe in him how many will say this morning i solemnly believe in the god who wrote this bible he said if you will solemnly believe in him if he shall return again into our midst to prove himself besides amen of the preaching of the word that he's here he's been convincing sinners that he's here if he's here to heal the sick and would reveal the cause as he did when he was here on earth then will you gladly accept your healing if you will he said just raise your hands just everywhere now he said and if he will do so and will identify himself you should be ashamed not to identify yourself with him then amen you should do it now the prophet of god here is saying there is an order to these services he said there's a there's a testimony then there is the preaching of the word he said now we've come to the time where we're going to pray for the sick he said when what we're going to do is we're going to ask the god who wrote the bible he meant to come into the midst of the church and to confirm amen that he is the one that wrote the bible and he is the one here to perform amen the desire of the heart if he should come in here amen and do these things then would you amen identify yourself with him now i'll ask you this morning amen if the god who wrote the bible was to come into this building this morning which i believe he is here he meant would you be ashamed to say that's my lord would you be ashamed if you saw somebody come up to an altar and bow down and begin to pray and ask god to set him free from some spirit he meant in that that spirit of that oppression lift up off of their lives and they would begin to rejoice and begin to praise god would you be ashamed amen to say that's my lord doing that if you would see somebody amen that had no no victory and the power of god would come in the meeting this morning and would fill that vessel with victory would you be ashamed he meant to say that's my lord doing that i i don't believe we're ashamed here this morning but i believe we are amen if i can sit this way we are proud amen to be identified with the lord jesus christ we there are many gods we could be identified with we could be identified with buddha or muhammad amen and all those gods are dead this morning but we are here he met identified with the one true and living god amen and his name is the lord jesus christ said me let me say this with everything within me this message did not come amen to replace the lord jesus christ it came to reveal amen the lord jesus christ and to put an assurity in the heart of the believer that they are not ashamed he meant to be identified with the god of abraham isaac and of jacob now in psalms 119 verse 1 david says amen blessed are the undefiled in the way amen who walk in the law of the lord blessed are they amen that keep his testimonies and that seek him amen with the whole heart amen now they they also do no iniquity amen they walk in his ways amen now has commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently oh that my ways were directed to keep thy statues amen david said then shall i not be ashamed amen when i have respect unto all thy commandments amen amen david is saying when i have respect unto all thy commandments i will not be ashamed isaiah will say it like this in chapter 50 and verse 7 for the lord god will help me amen how many believes the lord god will help you amen the lord god will help me therefore amen shall i not be confounded amen therefore have i set my face amen like a flint and i know that i shall not amen be ashamed there's one thing i know this morning i shall not amen be ashamed i shall not amen walk in the ways of iniquity i shall not amen serve god half-heartedly but rather i will seek he'd been to serve the living god with my whole heart amen when i begin to think about the age we're living in it's an age of identification the problem of god will say we're living in a day when identification is required identification amen it's not an option today identification is required you say oh it's an option no it's not amen amen you call amen your your power company to pay your power bill you got to have identification amen you call to pay your credit card bill you got to have identification amen dave ramsey folks don't trip out on us okay hey amen you call to make your car payment amen you've got to have your identification right amen now watch this it's amazing to me it's an age of identification he said unless you're known at a bank you can't cast your check unless you have something he meant to identify yourself he said i'll he said my wife here she can't cast her check he said because she don't drive she has no social security number he meant nothing to identify herself he meant you've got to be you've got to be some official amen identification and i think it's just the time that we're living in if you notice amen you go to a certain denominational church amen like methodist presbyterian lutheran or something amen and you have to something amen to identify yourself if you're even going to speak amen you have to have a credential or a card or a fellowship card or something amen to identify yourself as where they know where you come from and what you're going to say at the platform you have to be identified he meant it's an age of identification then then your identification is in a surety he meant to that denomination that you're not going to say anything amen that's going to cross their traditions you're not going to you're not going to teach any doctrine that's going to cross their bylaws amen they want to see that fellowship card amen in this age of identification we're living in it's also a time of an identity crisis think about that in a time where more identification is required amen than ever before is also a time he meant of an identity crisis now the word identity crisis means amen a period of uncertainty amen and confusion in which a person's sense of identity amen becomes insecure amen typically due to a change in their expected aim they meant a role in society now amen do you realize there is a pressure in the world today to become ashamed amen of who you are and your identity there there is a pressure amen i'll tell you it's not just coming from the schoolhouse amen it's not just coming from the government's house amen it's coming all the way from the white house amen there's a pressure that's coming down amen and it's a pressure and let me just say it like this it's the most craziest thing i've ever heard of he meant it's a pressure upon people to be identified or to be ashamed of their identification you say what do you mean well there's a pressure for a man amen to become ashamed that he's a man and there's a pressure for a woman to become ashamed amen that she is a woman we're living in a society amen where they say that we're going to do away with any type of gender identification even to the point now he meant to we're in high school they are talking about taking the word freshman he meant out of high school because it identifies he meant an entire age group as a boy let me say this world is crazy amen it's an age where there's a pressure he meant on a man to be a man and a woman to be a woman but i'll say it like this what is happening in the natural amen is also happening in the spiritual and there is a pressure coming up from the pits of hell he meant upon the church of the living god he meant to back off for being the bride he meant to be a backing off of being messiah he meant to back off of quoting a prophet he meant to back off of preaching the message amen i'm going to preach here this morning they've been there's a pressure upon churches ain't meant to back off of having services there's a pressure up on preachers ain't meant to back off of dealing with sin amen and ungodliness and unrighteousness in the house of god amen but is there anybody here this morning that will say i am not ashamed amen to be a son of god i am not ashamed to be a daughter of god amen if i am an american amen i bear her shame and i bear her glory but at the end of the day i am not ashamed he meant to be an american are you with me this morning amen i am not apologizing for being american i'm not apologizing for being a man i'm not apologizing for being a u.s citizen i'm not apologizing amen for the convictions of my heart and if that is in the natural amendment we need some people in the spiritual amen that will stand up and say i'm not apologizing they meant to say i believe the full gospel i'm not apologizing they meant to say i believe god still heals cancer i'm not apologizing amen to say i believe he still gives the holy ghost i'm not apologizing i'm not backing up i'm not blessing i'm not turning red in the face i'm not pulling back on my convictions i know what i believe i know where i stand i know where i come from i know god made me what i am and i'm not ashamed of it it's an age of pressure it's a it's a time of pressure now the problem god says then what has happened in the natural amen is also happening in the spiritual amen you realize if a person chooses to be a democrat there's a pressure amen to be ashamed to be in that amen if a person chooses to be a republican there's a pressure to be ashamed to be in that if a person chooses to be independent amen there's a pressure of being amen but let me just say this amen i didn't choose to be republican i didn't choose to be democrat didn't choose to be liberal or conservative amen i chose to be a christian amen because that's the only sure foundation that there is left in the world that's the only surety that is there left in the world and i'll say it like the bible said amen i am not ashamed amen of the gospel of jesus christ it is my identification now amen when the bible picks this up jesus said whosoever amen therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation amen of him also amen shall the son of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father with the holy angels now amen to me brother samuel there's a paradox right there they've been that there's going to be a pressure amen to be ashamed of the son of man in an adulterous and sinful generation amen now if there is a pressure upon you amen to believe this message amen to be ashamed of this message let me just tell you where that pressure is coming from that pressure is coming from a society amen that a boy don't even know what bathroom to use and the coral don't even know what bathroom to hear oh well we might as well preach here we're here ain't we hey amen let me tell you that pressure is not coming from a holy source it is coming from a wicked and an adulterous sinful generation amen i think it's time amen we check the source amen of the pressure that's coming upon us amen i'll tell you what if there's a pressure coming upon you amen not to be a message believer not to fulfill amen the potentials that god placed in your life that pressure is not coming from god it is coming from a wicked and an adulterous sinful generation is there anybody here say this morning i'm going to turn a deaf ear i'm gonna turn a blind eye amen to this wicked and adulterous sinful generation and realize this pressure is not coming amen from righteousness it is coming from unrighteousness now when the prophet picks up mark the eighth chapter he automatically begins to preach a message called amen ashamed one word and he calls it ashamed he said see now this word ashamed could also be translated into embarrassed amen and shamed can be translated into embarrassed he said now see you are faced with something that you're embarrassed about you are faced with something that you are embarrassed about he said being ashamed he said another thing being ashamed does amen is it shows that you are not sure of what you're talking about if you really know what you're talking about and have the assurance that you know what you're talking about then you can tell anybody and you're not ashamed he said but if you feel put out amen out of place it shows that you are if you feel put out if you feel out of place amen it shows you are now let me just say this this bride is not unsure of what she believes amen this bride amen is not out of place amen with what she believes as a matter of fact paul would tell timothy amen nevertheless the things which also i suffer i am not ashamed amen for i know in whom i have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which i have committed unto him amen against that day now do you realize if you're not sure amen when you come up against the dead hook when you come up against the spirit when you come up against an evil thing amen if you're not sure of where you're standing amen then that thing will begin to pressure you amen to back off of your conviction he said remember you don't know what troubles are amen till you hit their witch doctors on every side and the devil and don't think they don't know what to do see you better know what you're talking about when you stand before them but i know in whom i have believed amen is there anybody here this morning that can say i am not afraid amen of the devil amen you said with that that's pretty bold no amen that's a conviction you ought to have i am not afraid of the devil i am not afraid of an evil spirit amen i know they may try to push against me amen but when you know who you are you can stand there and you can say satan in the name of jesus christ i rebuke forget thee behind me come on church there is an authority in this bride that we don't have to put up with the devil amen we can defeat the devil we don't have to make room for the devil my bible said neither give place to the devil amen but cast him out is there anybody here this morning that'll say i'm going to cast him out i'm going to cast him out of my mind i'm going to cast him out of my home i'm going to cast him out of the church i'm going to cast the devil out with an assurity amen that he's got to go are you all hearing me amen i've stood there and i've seen demons raise up amen but i've also seen them fall back down and amen i've seen demons manifest themselves and i've seen them speak out of people i've heard demons say things like i will not come out amen i will stay here you have no authority over me i was in new zealand one time and a girl possessed of a demon amen laying there on the floor slithering like a snake and i laid down beside her on my knee and began to pray with about five other brothers and sisters there trying to hold her down amen and i said satan in the name of jesus christ by the authority of the word amen i cast you out and that demon rose up in that girl and said what word amen what were you talking about and i looked over brother samuel and there was a bible laying there and i said sister you pick up that bible and you lay it on that girl's body and i said in the name of the lord jesus christ who wrote this word and in this word it said go into all the world and preach the gospel amen casting out their votes amen and that demon come out of the girl amen because i was not embarrassed amen i was not ashamed of the god who sent me there and that same god amen has put a commission in the heart of the pride this morning old church of the living god quit being embarrassed to the devil and defeat the devil you ain't got to back up to no spirit amen we are not ashamed amen we have a surety this morning when brother man preaches that message is shamed amen now jeffersonville actually retitles it in the subtitle and calls it ashamed of him amen ashamed of him now watch this people will actually tell me well brother andrew i'm not ashamed of jesus christ but i am ashamed of this message and then you'll hear people say well i'm not ashamed amen to carry a bible amen but i am ashamed to talk about jesus amen but let me just say this jesus and the word are the same jesus and the word are the same he meant so to be ashamed of one is to be ashamed of the other to to be ashamed of one is to be ashamed of the other now let me just show you the continuity amen john 1 says in the beginning amen was the word and the word was with god and the word was god amen so you couldn't be ashamed of the word without being ashamed of god and you couldn't be ashamed of god without being ashamed of the word because in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god skip down to john 1 14 and the word was made flesh amen now people can say well we're not ashamed of the word but we're ashamed of this man called jesus amen but to say you was ashamed of the man called jesus was the same as saying he was ashamed of the word he meant because the message and the messenger are one amend the word and the bringer of the word becomes one we find out when a man comes sent from god amen ordained of god with the truth thus saith the lord the message and the messenger are one and the same amen see a denominational man under a denominational auspices he and the church is the one a theologian under theology amen made by the nomination the church of theology and the theologian are one he said then when a man comes with us saith the lord he and the message is one amen notice when elijah come with fossett the lord he and his message became one just as jesus when he come he was the word amen jesus was the word amen of john 1 1 jesus was the word amen notice this so the word of god and the messenger of the age amen was the self same thing all the time and the prophet said that's right he meant jesus was the word and the word was jesus and they were the self same thing all the time see then the word was prophesied and jesus was the fulfillment of the prophesied word he was the he was the one that the prophet said would happen amen a virgin shall conceive and bear a child that was all the way back in the beginning when god said amen the woman's seed shall bruise the serpent and he'll bruise her heal amen all these prophecies had been given amen from david cried he meant in the rest on down he said he was that word manifested now do you realize there were people on that day that were not ashamed amen to teach the prophecies they were not ashamed amen to read what isaiah said and what genesis 3 said and what zacharias they were not ashamed he meant of the prophecy but when the fulfillment come they was ashamed of the fulfillment amen let me say this you cannot be ashamed of the fulfillment and be proud to be identified with the prophecy amen the prophecy and the fulfillment are the self same thing oh when god gives a word of promise amen he fulfills it see when god give the word of promise concerning jesus amen he fulfilled his own word of promise in romans 9 verse 9 the bible says this is amen the word of promise at the time will i come amen and sarah shall have a son amen do you realize sarah had been battled the thought of being embarrassed amen she battled the fault amen of being ashamed of the word of prophecy how can you say that preacher amen because she she told abraham you go have the child by hagar amen i'm old and you're old and there's no life left in my womb there's no milk left in my veins he meant she was ashamed amen but when god said the word of promise amen would come through sarah amen there was nobody else could take her place there was nobody else that could fulfill her old church of the living god this morning don't you see amen you are a part of the word of prophecy you are a part of the word of promise and nobody can take your place the same way it is with the virgin mary the word of promise came amen to the virgin mary but that word of promise was he himself to be made manifest amen god was made manifest he himself amen acted at that time and fulfilled his own word of promise in the virgin it was an angel that it brought her the message but the angel's message was the word of god isaiah 9 6 he fulfilled at the time all that was written of him because she accepted his word amen to her she was not ashamed he meant of the word that the angel brought as a matter of fact the angel's message brought a boldness to mary he meant to go home and say joseph amen i met an angel amen and the prophet said the same angel that came to mary was the same angel that came to joseph in a dream amen and released to him amen the power to believe amen that all things are working according to the prophetic cogs of the almighty god oh church amen the same angel amen that meant william branham in a cave is the same angel of the lord that is in this building this morning amen i can't make this message real to you a preacher can't make it real to you ain't been but the angel of the lord can take this message amen and make it so real to your heart that it will drive back every spirit it'll drive back every fear it'll drive back every nervousness it'll drive back everything that the devil is plaguing your mind with when it comes to believing what you believe and standing on what you are now i hope this is okay this morning amen the word of promise cannot fail amen think about that the word of promise amen cannot fail jesus was tempted and how can overcome above any man that had ever been tempted in the wilderness for 40 days but how did he overcome amen by the word amen what is the word of promise to every christian here it is greater is he that is in you then he that's in the world the word of promise to every believer is greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world amen then how do i overcome not me but the word that's in me and the word is god then i overcome the things of the world because it's the word in me and if you abide in me and my words in you then just ask what you will he said just keep pressing up amen you're coming to the top as sure as anything amen you've got to come to the top now think about this just keep pressing amen just keep coming up he meant pressing based on what but we're pressing based upon the word of promise now watch this the prophet said the woman with the issue of blood amen she didn't even have a promise amen but she had faith amen see amen notice this try to consider what the word means amen faith is by the hearing the word and the word of promise if you don't have a promise then you venture out upon your own faith but if you can take a promise of god then that's god's promise to you the woman that touched the aim of his garment had no promise of that but her faith amen without a promise got her healing amen her faith without a promise got her healing then how much more are we to get our healing by faith in the promise that god is manifesting and vindicating before us and has brought it to us by his word and has come around and has confirmed it himself amen see that if he would come in the midst of the church and do what his word said he would do that he would heal the sick he would reveal the secrets of the heart he would discern the spirits he would have known he'd been the unknown things he would make him known amen he would break out amen of the visible realm into the visible realm he meant by the power of the word of god amen then is there anybody here that would say god if you manifest your word you've indicated your word you've confirmed your word i am not ashamed to be identified with the living reality of the presence of god in the church of the living god listen friends i am not identified to be associated with the revealing of the son of man amen when i hear a prophet on tape begin to discern i'm not ashamed amen i'm not embarrassed amen i'm not blessing amen i know of a surety that that vision or that discernment is not going to fail amen because it's not a man on the scene it's the son of man they've been fulfilling his promised word amen then what is christ amen christ is the word and christ is revealed or made manifest in his own word now the prophet said it's just written word to us it's a reality it isn't just written word to us it's a reality amen we are in him now i love this and we are enjoying it amen amen now we behold him and we see him the word manifesting itself in this morning church we are inside of christ now as then all true believers see him amen the word of promise of this day openly manifested that's a big word if you can get it see all true believers that's in the word see god openly how many believers do we have amen amen amen we've got a little bit of sleepers here this morning we got him believers amen how many believers do we have here amen all true believers amen see god openly manifest amen the veil has been rent our old denominational traditional veil amen must be rent again in order to really see what it is you've got to come out from among that stuff you'll never do it they'll keep pulling that veil before you every time but here it is written and here is made manifest amen do you see it amen can you answer that this morning do you see it amen do you see him amen the veiled christ the mighty god unveiled in the church in the living god and there's a people here that'll say father i'm not ashamed to be identified with the revealing of your presence in the age in which i'm living in amen do you realize in luke chapter 4 amen that jesus was the word of promise amen but he became then the word of promise fulfilled and the prophet picks this up and says notice the messiah standing in the platform to identify himself with the word of promise for that age and there were people there that was embarrassed by his actions amen there were people there brother brian that was embarrassed when jesus picked up the scroll of isaiah there was people there that was embarrassed when he said behold amen this is written of me they was embarrassed when he read they was embarrassed when he spoke he meant furthermore when he closed the scroll handed it to the priest walked over and sat down in the messiah's chair they were really embarrassed then amen but you know what jesus was not in paris they meant jesus was not blushing they meant jesus was not nervous jesus was not unsure brother samuel when he read isaiah 60. there wasn't one bone in his body there wasn't one nerve amen that was trembling or questioning should i be doing this amen shouldn't i be reading this amen should not be saying this amen there would oh glory to god amen there was not one ounce he meant of a son of surety in his body he knew who he was he knew what the word said about it and with confidence brother boaz he could read the scroll he could say the word he could close the scroll he could sit down in the chair and when he stood there and cried this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears he didn't see it with a question mark he said it with an exclamation amen because the word that had been veiled through the eyes of tradition and prophecies have now been fulfilled i'm about to bust her i'm not to preach one or the other amen do you see why there's some people in the land today that when they hear the word they believe the word and there's not one ounce amen of nervousness in them there's not one ounce amen should i say amen or should i not when you hear the word what are you saying preacher i'm saying it's time to go sit in your chair are you all hearing me oh preach preacher thank you i believe i will it's time to go sit in your chair amen there was a chair in the temple it was called messiah's chair it had been sitting there for years because they knew messiah would come and someday messiah would fulfill his chair someday messiah would take his position he meant everybody that got near there amen they put a pressure upon them you better not sit in that chair you better not claim that position you better not preach that open word you better not declare the seventh seal amen that's not for you amen but when jesus come in there he was not a hybrid he was not a coward he was not a blessed prophet he was not the blessing word he was the word amen of promise with power [Applause] what are you saying i'm saying when you know who you are there ain't enough demons of intimidation amen to back you off of fulfilling what god has called you to do well let's just preach here this morning when you know who you are there ain't enough demon powers out of hell to make you second guess your position to make you feel embarrassed amen to worship god oh oh glory to god you know when you want to raise your hand so bad but you feel an old devil pressing you you know what that devil's doing he's trying to stop you he meant from fulfilling he'd been the position god saw you in from before the foundation of the world and that same old devil if he would have had his way he wouldn't let jesus sit in that chair amen but there was not enough devil's brother that could stop jesus and there's not enough devils that can stop the bride today when she recognizes he meant the word is eagle food and she hears from her theophany and it releases her from the prison bars of man's interpretation to step into the fulfillment of the vision oh come on eddie biscuit put the checkered shirt on amen come on preacher amen preach the message come on brother branham stand there and declare the word is revealed it's been announced in the heavens it's been announced upon the earth it has made manifest [Applause] ah god i'm about to put another door in this church where do you want it are you all hearing me it's time to play the part you've been sitting on the sidelines long enough you've been backing up and blessing and cowering around like oh god it's time to step in your position the curtains the curtain call has been given amen unveil what has been failed unseal what has been sealed release what has been bound hey i am not ashamed to be identified with the perfect interpretation of the word jesus would have never sat in the messiah's chair on private interpretation there would have been a question should i sit or should i not well let's just preach a minute there would have been a reserve there should i go or should i not but the identification of god is the word then everything that jesus did in the temple that day he could identify it by the word oh god brother samuel he didn't do one thing that was not in the word because he was the word [Applause] the word and jesus were the self same thing jesus could not do one thing different than what was in the word and be the fulfillment of the prophet's word but because he was the word he meant he was bound to that word amen therefore the description he did was what the word said he would do my the identification of god is the word then what does identification mean well the word identification means the action amen or the process of identifying someone or something are you ready for this amen the fact of being identified let's say that together the fact of being identified see that identification is not an opinion there's got to be a fact there's got to be a boldness there there's got to be a courage there amen to say this is the way it is amen see identification then is based upon facts and not opinions it was not an opinion that jesus was the messiah it was not an opinion that that was the scripture pertaining to him it was not an opinion that he should sit in that chair it was a word fact well let's just preach it for a minute then that tells me that it is not an opinion that i am the bride of jesus christ it is not an opinion that a prophet said you believe for your house and thy and my house shall be saved it is not an opinion amen that your sins are in the sea of forgetfulness it's not an opinion when jesus said if you abide in me and my word abide in you ask what she will that's not an opinion even that is a fact it's a fact this morning amen denomination amen it's not christianity amen christianity is not denomination amen denomination changed amen the identity of christianity do you realize that they meant denomination changed the identity of christianity the prophet said it's very much a popular thing today to say i am a christian see but do you believe the word of god where it said these signs shall follow them that believe he said oh even ministers faces will bless see are you ashamed of saved divine healing are you ashamed of the full gospel are you ashamed of your pentecostal experience he said that is the word being made flesh in you god help me church amen are you ashamed of divine healing are you ashamed of the full gospel are you ashamed of your pentecostal experience a prophet said that is the word made flesh in you see then what the word made flesh is is the light of the age when you see it that's why i probably would say we thank the o god to be the light bearers of this age to be ready to manifest even somebody say ready to be ready to manifest amen the promised word for the age that we're now living in we believe that the holy spirit is here on earth now trying to find hearts to manifest and to bring to pass by vindicating the word that he's now prophesied for this day and this hour see that when god gives a word that word has to live itself out for every generation the word lived itself out in the days of moses it lived itself out in hebrews 1. he said but the church got it so twisted up those prophets those daring messengers of god they come without any church without denomination without organization without anything and they defied kings kingdoms churches and everything they was brought before the priest they wasn't ashamed because they had directly thus saith the lord when they were brought before priests they were not embarrassed they had thus saith the lord he said if you notice the prophet in one sense of the word in the old testament when he said thus saith the lord now watch him he goes right into the phrase of taking the place of god you notice when he placed out before him thus saith the lord he fell right into god oh mercy and he acted as god then he gave his message which was god speaking through him thus saith the lord amen then there was a power behind the word of thus saith the lord because it was not the seth william branham or thus says samuel browning it was thus saith the lord which means the lord has said thus all them prophets of old of the old brought that message and you know what it did brother it embarrassed the kings amen it embarrassed them it embarrassed them philosophers it bears them pharisees amen it made the people feel uncomfortable and the prophet said the people even they would feel uncomfortable because they were supposed to be leaders and religious men and and when when the word came forth in that manner it exposed them and they felt ashamed or embarrassed but that tells us how that preachers amen will hear the tapes and they will sit in their studies he said you will hear these things but because of the nomination you will be embarrassed to go to your pulpit and preach it amen i'll say this god sent malachi 4 and this message they meant to embarrass and make every denominational feel uncomfortable amen on their teaching of what christianity is are you all with me this morning they meant to embarrass the false teachings of what they said christian identification was remember it says it like this he said many times you say i'm a christian have you received the holy ghost since you believed they say well they're embarrassed about that he said and many times christians back up when it comes to shouting and divine healing he said they back up they want to announce they got a denomination they won't announce that because they're not ashamed of it he said but when it comes to being a christian that can take god's word just the way it is then they are ashamed he said now that's just recently amen come into that watch this in the days of luther to recognize luther as a father luther while it almost meant death by catholic church days of wesley to know you had defied the england church was almost penalty of death by the angles to announce you were a methodist in the days of pentecost it was a shame because you was quickly counted a holy roller or some tongue speaker now they organized and went right in with the rest of the group now watch this when malachi 4 comes he is going to restore amen true christian identity he is going to say they have changed the identity of christianity to where you say am i a christian i'm a baptist i'm a methodist i'm a lutheran i'm a pentecostal he said but that wasn't so at the beginning now watch this he said now here's the identification amen wherefore i give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of god amen calleth jesus a curse and that no man can say that jesus is the lord but by the holy ghost see then the holy ghost is the identity of christianity the holy ghost is the identity of christianity beth methodist is not the identity amen baptist is not the identity pentecostal is not the identity the holy ghost is the identity of christianity do you realize intellectuals is not your identity well come on church let's preach amen intellectuals is not your identity your intellectual conception of this message will not release a power in you to fulfill the word that god called you to fulfill well brother andrew i just need the intellectuals well let me tell you what about moses amen moses knowed all the intellectuals but god had to take him amen over to the bush and take it all out of him amen i caught this the other day and i about had to run away amen brother gideon moses had to be led to the to the burning bush he wasn't led to a morgue he wasn't led to a clock church service he wasn't led to some intellectual speech and then he was gathered around the burning bush and when he got to the burning bush the burning bush realized he was full of intellectuals so you know what the prophet of god said he said god took all the intellectuals he went out of moses and he said this then he put some faith in him from the fire oh glory to god he took all the intellectuals out of him and he put some faith in him from the fire whatever moses lacked amen was in the burning bush whatever moses needed was in the burning bush let me say this brother sister whatever moses got out of that burning bush cost an 80 year old man amen to go home and to gather his wife and children and saddle up a mule and take off down to egypt and say where you going moses i'm going down to egypt what are you going to do 80 year old man i'm going down to take over come on church whatever moses got is what i want whatever moses got is what the church or the living god needs now i'm going to take the breaks off and i'm going to preach her for about two minutes we don't need no more intellectuals we don't need no more youtube preachers we don't need no more ideas and seminaries and a bunch of head knowledge what the church of the living god needs is some fire they meant some fire to come in the church until it burns out ever i'll tell you what we need we need some fire amen to burn out of our young people we need some fire ain't meant to burn out of our preachers well yeah i'm just going to preach i'm on a bus i'm sick and tired amen to 65 preachers that ain't got a backbone ain't got guts to preach nothing you all knew i want no when you invited me up here amen where is the men of god that's got a backbone just stand for the word whatever moses got it took every ounce of cowardism out of him whatever moses god it took every bit of being ashamed of the commission upon his life [Applause] you ever seen somebody get something and you wanted it you ever seen somebody get something and you want to aim it what it done for one you ever said that did it for them they'll do it for me y'all ever heard the cathedral quartet the singers and then i grew up listening to him and y'all know if you listen to it much you'd hear george johnson and glenn payne go back and forth yeah i am 25 but i do like southern gospel i am one of the youngest at the national quartet convention but i do like it are y'all hear me and then they go back more than each other well one day oh george told a story on glenn he said glenn was watching his wife one night take her take her medicine she's standing there taking over me over medicine he said what's that one pill there do for you she said well i take that pill and it makes me feel young again he said how

of it amen i want all of it oh glory to god i tell you this morning church this message amen i just don't want a dose of it i want the full prescription i want the power with it i want the word with it i want the anointing with it i want the full prescription until it releases ain't been a chemical in my body amen called faith and my body has changed in the moment [Applause] are you all hearing me what are you saying brother jimmy i'm saying if he did it for one it'll do it for another if it give moses courage it'll give brian courage if it give moses boldness it'll give samuel bolas if it give moses a backbone it'll give every preacher in this message of backbone to stand before the pharaohs of uninterpreted word and unlock preach somebody stand before man-made doctrines and say let my people go now i'm going to take a sword out here for a second amen because i feel led to i'm sick and tired of modern day pharaohs they've been working god's people under their own ideas and their own interpretations and their own opinions and then there's a moses in the land today that still got the guts to say let my people go let them serve god in the grace in the liberty in the purity of holiness [Applause] oh god something come out of that fire glory and god in moses he said and that's what we need tonight is another visit to the burning bush do you know whatever moses got what's not natural it was supernatural are y'all hearing me whatever moses got had passion in it had fire in it had zeal in it god have mercy yeah i'm just gonna preach i remember brother donny reagan said one time i was a kid i never forget it he said people go to message churches he said they go in with a long face and they come out with a longer one he said they come out and they go to the restaurant and they look at somebody and say don't you want what i got he said no if it makes me look like that and act like that i don't want no part in it are y'all hearing me hey you know what i don't want no theology that takes my dance away i know you think i'm pentecostal but that's all right hey man i'm not gonna let you think i'm a little bit hey if you're gonna call me pentecostal i'm gonna give you something to work with i'm not gonna let you be a liar i'm gonna give you some material to work with amen i'm not ashamed amen of the power of god ain't no devil gonna take my worship ain't no devil gonna take my liberty ain't no devil going to shut my song up ain't no devil going to shut my praise up i got it on the same sands that moses got it on now whatever moses god the prophet said it was a supernatural experience he said now watch this moses stood on the back side of the desert somewhere where he met god himself now we preach that before a man preaches in a pulpit he needs to meet the pillar of fire on the backside of the desert then what good does it do for a preacher to meet the pillar of fire when the church ain't met call himself a preacher until they stood on their sacred sands and and fellowship one-on-one with a pillar of fire amen in all the world burn out then what about the pews you demand the pulpit amen can we get a little bit out of the pew sometimes well it's sunday morning we might as well preach that we are y'all hearing me hey man if this man come in here and begin to preach like some people worship it wouldn't be no time you'd have him in a deacon's meeting come on if he come in this pulpit and just half-heartedly put some scriptures in close together you'd be all wadded up and tore up and blowed up well i want a deacon's meeting and i want to know what's occupying brother samuel's time he ain't preaching like he used to he ain't laboring like he used to amen there must be sin in his life everybody oh well can i ask you something amen why aren't you raising your hands like you used to why don't you shout like you used to why aren't you running the aisles like you used to why aren't you giving it all you have i'll tell you why you're not doing it it's because you let some intellectual spirit of formalism get on you and you lost your liberty but i declare today is the day with liberty is restored to the children of god with a passion with a zeal with a fire with an anointing that says ain't no devil blessing in me ain't no devil turning me around i'm going through i'm going to get my all i'm going to put my heart in the service i'm going to put my mans in the search [Applause] oh that devil didn't like that but i really don't care amen if you're going to demand the pulpit you ought to put some out in the pews [Applause] i never didn't like that but i really don't care because i think it's a downright shame we got men of god in labor for hours to bring a sermon and people show up and sleep [Applause] i think it's a downright shame we got holy ghost-filled men that take time away from their families and take time away from their wives ain't meant to get in the presence of god and to bring a word to the church and we got people now won't even show up on wednesday nights they won't even show up on thursday nights well they got time to go fishing and they got time to go hunting and they got time to go work out and they got time to go play ball but they ain't got time to come to house of god you need to meet the burning bush go to the burning bush and let all the intellectualism be burned out of your heart until a firing knot oh i know what i'm talking about ain't been you people that get all wha can i take some liberty here you get all wandered up about how loud the speakers are you didn't get tore up at the bar room when they was blasting your eardrums out oh well brother andrew i'd come to church but then pews are too hard you didn't get mad when you set 12 hours and watch a bunch of boys kick a dead pig across a football field and say well the pew hurts my back the problem is where your heart is where your treasures is is where your passion will be i went to god this morning that the holy ghost would come in this building until every passion until every zeal until every fire would be restored with a love to serve god go ahead and break out of it right now go ahead and break out go ahead and give god some praise go ahead right now put that on formal battle out of the house of god push that old unbelieving spirit out of the house of god puts that devil out it says that days of miracles has passed and the holy ghost don't fall no more i believe he's fallen here this morning like he did in the upper room i believe he's killing people like he did on the day of pentecost i don't believe god has changed his word is still true his power is still here he is still the almighty god he is still the captain of the host of the lord and he's here amen to fight your battles he's here to overcome your devils [Applause] give him some praise [Applause] let the intellectualism go let the fire of the holy ghost come back in the church [Applause] oh i see it breaking right now i see it breaking right now he said lander what are you getting right dude i'm getting ready wave a white flag of victory i'm getting ready waving a white flag of victory right here in the house of god on a sunday morning we got some victory hey we're not ashamed we're not embarrassed we know who we are we know where we come from we know what we believe we know where we're going and there ain't no devil can talk us out of the victory in the house of god he said andrew why are you waving a white flag amen because my prophet said the angels of god right now are waving white flags of victory he said the devils are waving black flags to defeat he said you know why the angels are waving white flags of victory because souls are getting saved bodies are being healed i say like this prodigals are coming home if the angels can wave a white flag about a victory they're not even receiving then don't you think the church or the living god has got a right on a sunday morning to wave a flag of victory [Applause] oh glory are you all hearing me this morning i'm talking about victory [Applause] victory in the church [Applause] victory in our hearts [Applause] y'all hear me victory [Music] hey berlander i got the victory but the devil's going to take it from me i say that devil's a liar i said that devil is a liar are you all hearing me the devil is a liar this morning i believe this message amen can put something in you the same way it did moses now can i tell you what happened with moses the problem that god said when moses met that burning bush he said all the atheists in the world couldn't talk him out of it could not explain it away he met god for himself he knows he was there and he knowed what happened brother brother brian when i read that the other day all the atheists in the world could not talk him out of it you know what i said i said then brother how many atheist is in the world can i can i tell you according to our sociologist amen ariel kaiser and and jew ham thank god my name is andrew but according to these sociologists amen their review of numerous global studies on atheism there are 450 to 500 million positive atheists and agnostics in the world are you ready for this according to seven percent of the world's population with china having the most atheist in the world 200 million convinced atheists what's 450 plus 500 9 50. all right amen what's 9 50 plus 200 11 50. right there you could be oh god are y'all hearing me whatever moses got if he was standing on the road to egypt and he met all 1150 million positive and convinced atheists and agnostics in the world when it was all said and done and the dust had settled brother doug they still would not had enough to make moses ashamed of who he was what are you saying i'm saying moses could a man of 1150 and they all stopped him and they started one by one by one and moses one atheist by another he wouldn't have got weaker he had it got stronger by the time he got on the other side of the atheist and the agnostics he would have still believed that whatever was in that fire is in my soul and i am the one to go down to pharaoh and say let my people go oh brother sister this morning is there something in your soul i said is there something in your soul that if this service was dismissed and you went out in the parking lot amen crank these monitors up for me you went out in the parking lot and you met eleven hundred and can brother samuel you know what amazes me in that sociologist report you know what they reported they reported two words that the prophet talked about positive and convinced that's good thank you positive and convinced 450 to 500 million positive atheists 200 million convinced y'all know where i'm going with this brother braham said what is an absolute it is an assurance it is a positive well moses was sure and positive of the god he met and he was convinced that what he meant was more than a bush but there was a god in that bush well i say this morning church i am positive that as a nine-year-old boy i meant more than an altar call as a nine-year-old boy i meant more than just a preacher i met the same pillar of fire [Applause] oh and i heard a prophet say when you met him there is nobody that can talk you out of him if you don't know him this morning there's somebody i'll talk you out this message if you don't know the god of this message amen some preacher will talk you out of it amen but if you know that you know it don't matter how gifted it don't matter how anointed it don't matter how supernatural it appears to be there will be a lie detector in your soul that will say that's not the god of the bible now now let me just say this amen i know some of you think right now amen that moses got a little carried away amen but my prophet said we're in the calling out when the calling out time comes when it comes to time you'll have to come out and stand for the word and say i don't belong to any of it why would he be ashamed of you because you're claiming to be he is child when you won't follow him and that's the way it is with so-called christianity are you ready for this if you name it a name of the nomination they accept the fatherhood of the denomination but when it comes to accepting the fatherhood of the word of god christ know they're embarrassed but can i tell you what my elder brother paul said can i can i tell you what my elder brother paul said here's what he said this i confess paul wasn't an embarrassed coward paul walked right out there and he looked right in their faces and he said the way that is called heresy i confess unto you that's the way i worship the god of our fathers you know what the word heresy means the word heresy means heresy means crazy and it means idiotic crazy and idiotic now i know some people sit there and they say well that that preacher's crazy that preacher's heresy that preacher is idiotic and paul said to king agrippa i'm not mad amen amen king agrippa tried to embarrass paul paul was out there dancing and rejoicing i believe he was waving a white flag a victory he was having a good time and old king agrippa come out there and said paul the way that you're worshiping is a way of heresy you're a madman paul said i'm not mad i'm the happiest i've ever been i'm not crazy you just think i am and you know why some of you quit worshiping it's cause somebody thought you was a crazy worshiper somebody thought you was a heretic somebody thought you was a fanatic amen is there anybody here that would say god restore the zeal of worship in my heart till i forget [Applause] what anybody says you say brother andrew i don't believe the marriage mary if mary was here this morning amen the blessed virgin she wouldn't be acting like this well you spoke too soon the prophet said they was all drunk on new wine and some of you sisters here did you know the blessed virgin mary was in that oh well brother andrew we're going to find us a new route we're going to come over and sip a little drink and we're going to take the communion a little secretly amen we're going to we're going to put our name on the robe the brother said you'll have to come the same route let the blessed virgin mary come he said are you ready for this the blessed virgin was right there and acted just as idiotic as the rest of them did just as drunk i don't mind telling you in the past few months i've been around some drinkers can i talk to you a little bit about some modern day drinkers i know we got so polished and so primed and brother michael we got so fancy amen that we don't want no more holy ghost drunks amen and you know why them holy ghost trunks are getting on your nerves it's cause you ain't drunk yourself well glory to god i heard a prophet say what we need is a drunk church what we need is a drunk preacher what we need is a drunk puppy what are you saying i'm saying if you get so drunk you'll forget the devil against you you'll forget the spirits fighting you you'll forget who don't like you come on church you let a man go in a bar room and he hates the guy next to him get him drunk enough he'll be hugging his neck oh god that that would happen in the church of the living god some of you also tore up at somebody else in the church but won't you just get drunk one time and you'll be dancing down the aisles together just get drunk one time and act as [Music] idiotic you know what i'm not ashamed of this new wine i'm not ashamed of this holy ghost stimulation of revelation can i testify to you for a minute amen i'll tell you what god's doing he's raising up a generation of young people around this message that's not ashamed of the outpouring of the holy ghost now this may this may bump your theology but let it bump your theology and still love me when i'm done okay you're looking at one young preacher that's not going to preach to squash it i'm going to preach to build it devil didn't like that did he i'm going to preach it's okay to get drunk on the holy ghost i'm going to preach it's okay to get so lost in the holy ghost that they gotta pack you to your car i'm gonna preach it's okay to lay in the yard and roll like a holy roller [Applause] that devil don't like that right now does he oh no amen uh no i i i i'm just preaching okay amen i'll say this amen we we're so trying to put the holy ghost in so many different directions that ain't even funny that god told me not long ago simply then what we need to do is we need to put together a powerpoint on the holy ghost i said no what you need to do is preach a powerful point about the holy ghost come on church amen the young people don't need to learn and they need an experience they need to meet the same gods you met they need to meet the god of abraham and isaac and jacob and william branham and paul i'm not against teaching not against presentation but i am against releasing an anointing upon the young people to believe that this message is a bunch of head knowledge and a bunch of psychology and a bunch we'll do 10 steps ain't no 10 steps there's one step let's receive the holy that's ghost i've seen some drunks here lately can i testify to you for a minute was that in oklahoma the other day in a youth camp holy ghost just come down man i'm talking on the first night the holy ghost fallen not the second third night of that camp i tell you what there was a brother samuel there was an outpouring i'm just leaving my notes right now there was an outpour of the holy ghost there was a girl got so drunk on the holy ghost she forgot who she was she forgot where she was at she forgot how she got there brother samuel she got so drunk and the holy ghost she was literally laughing in the they spirit her back to her dorm they set her down in her bed she had been fighting the devil oh god for several years but that night in the meeting the holy ghost released her that therefore and you know what that devil told her brother doug that devil said you'll never go free i'll always have you [Music] you'll never go free i'll always have you she got so i saw the video she got so drunk in the holy ghost she was sitting on her bed in her dorm he met with all the sisters around her praying laughing at that old devil and she fell over laughing and she come up and she laughed and she said is this the devil that said he would never let me go [Applause] she said is this that little old devil that said he would never let me go he's a small devil he's a puny devil you know what she done she got so drunk on the holy ghost till that devil that he'd been holding her become a laughingstock you say brother andrew that ain't very scriptural amen well i'll read you isaiah 14 is this the man that said he would cause nations to tremble is this the man oh glory is this the man that said he would make his that would he would make us stars above the stars of god the bible said they shall narrowly amen translate narrowly and somewhere through the lineage you'll find laughingly they shall laughingly look at him and say is this the man well i'm closing this morning church but that old devil's had you crying too long he's had you nervous too long he's had you blush well help me church he's had you blushing too long it's time to quit crying it's time to quit blessing it's time to look that devil's claire in the face [Applause] [Music] i'm scared i'm nervous i'm embarrassed the devil's got something on me [Music] when you've come under the token of the blood of jesus christ comes upon you then you finally get the victory are you under the token how many people this morning is under the token you're not ashamed to let the world know i am under the token then the devil says you ain't got no right to praise god if you're under the token the token is your right to praise god i'm gonna drive that home the token is your right to rejoice the token is your right to lift up holy hands brother the token is your right to lead song service with liberty i sit back in the office and i heard that holy rolling song leader up here that pentecostal guy up here i thought my god i want to see this i turned it on on my phone on youtube you know what he was up here doing he is up here dancing and jumping back and forth and i thought my god i'd hire that guy and take him to some orgs i preached in well brother andrew what are you saying i'm saying whatever he got give him some joy whatever he got give him some victory well brother andrew i think if we get a little victory in the church it might turn into wildfire quit worrying about wildfire when you ain't got no fire at all but you know what i saw i saw a young boy on fire for god with a love in his heart amen dancing back and forth here i'll tell you what this message will do more than put intellectualism in your head it'll do more than put quote books under your arm it'll put joy in your feet it'll put sound into your face this message comes to restore our doctrine to restore our church order to restore our churches but i'll say what else it did this message restored the dance [Applause] oh if this message can restore the way we baptize and we're not get out of order baptizing if this message can restore the way we have communion and we don't get out of order having communion then don't tell me this message can't restore the victory dance to the church and the church not get out of order yeah yeah i'm preaching now you're so scared of that dance you're so scared to let go and just give god some praise but let me just tell you something there ain't one key of music going right now do you realize that's what i love there's not one key of music going right now and people's got joy in the house of god he's down there ain't no music playing but we got joy we where's down there we're just down there in those tent meetings of the day and the power of god followed the brother samuel i mean liberty coming you some of y'all's there ain't been the holy ghost moving in the church you know what i got to thinking i got thinking we've got guys that's built ministries that says you can't preach the message and have this kind of worship but i told somebody i said you know what i like about this it's message preaching with pentecostal worship hello where brother enter the world took our dance let me say this we didn't take the dance from the nomination they took the dance from us as a matter of fact let's go to jeffersonville for a minute and let's take a prophet sitting by the pulpit and let's see him watch two sisters amen come dancing he meant down the aisle he meant shouting and he got all stiff-necked and starchy and said oh and my tabernacle acting like that well i won't have none of that he said i was sitting there criticizing them got like something y'all was doing us right now amen i sitting there criticizing them and i was trying to work up a way to prove that there shouldn't be no dancing in church and he said about that time [Music] [Applause] the spirit of god spoke to my heart and said don't judge them if you had the victory they had you'd be out there with them if you had the victory they had you would be out there with them and the prophet said amen before i could catch myself i was out there with him and he said you know what dancing is and then dancing is a sign that victory is in the church [Applause] my bible said david david danced before the lord now don't make fun of me okay but david got out there and he got to dancing even down the south we say dancing dancing up here but it's the same thing he got to dance until he danced his way right out of his clothes his old judgmental critical wife come out there on the front porch oh god and she said david you know what he said this is the word she used you are embarrassing the ark of the lord is returning hallelujah yes yes yes i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry i wondered for a long time what david said brother michael when his wife told him he was embarrassed at her until i heard a prophet say david was out there dancing because he had victory do you realize when david was dancing the ark hadn't even come back yet he was just dancing because he knew it was going to happen and he said david's wife said you embarrassed me and he said brother said he took another little dance and he turned around he looked up at her and he said didn't like that watch this oh glory you didn't like that amen then watch this and in closing this morning is there anybody here that wants to look at that old critical devil and say didn't like that amen watch this you don't like me raising my head you don't like me clapping i'll clap louder you don't like us having an altar call we'll have one every service we are the sons and daughters of the liberty of victory i am not ashamed of my testimony i am not ashamed of my salvation i am not ashamed of my redemption i am not ashamed of the upper room experience i'm not ashamed of the gospel go ahead and give him some praise praise him like a confident people praise him like a victorious people praise him like an overcomer pleasing like a cockerel i'm not ashamed i'm not ashamed i feel no pressure [Applause] i'm not embarrassed there was some faith come out of the fire brother if i go get an ice cube i'll freezer and give it to you is he going to warm you up no if i go get a stick of fire hand it to you is he going to warm you up then whatever come out of that fire i can't get away from this followed moses out all right come on lord moses didn't second guess another day i i didn't get to it but the lord gave it to me and i'm gonna give it to you and musicians are coming moses met the pillar of fire but said one place he got down on his knees in the presence kicked off his shoes do you realize the prophet said when moses went down to egypt down there with a confidence when he walked up before pharaoh oh god i love this when he walked up before pharaoh he never one time said excuse me can the children of israel go never one time said excuse me can i take god's seed out of here to fulfill the vision of abraham when he saw the seed in a strange land can i excuse me mr pharaoh do you mind if i take right up there and squared his shoulders back looked at pharaoh in the face and said let god's people go they were said okay i'll let him go but leave some behind moses said we ain't leaving a hoof behind he said well you ain't leaving moe said okay well in the morning you'll wake up and it'll be a swarm of flies see you in the morning walked back to his tent and started studying again turned the third exodus back on woke up the next morning open the tent door flies all over the place come on walk right through the flies down to pharaoh and said morning pharaoh good morning moses you ready to let god's people go yeah but this is the condition nope in the morning you'll wake up and all the water will turn to blood see you later he wasn't embarrassed of his commission woke up the next morning went down there turned the water on and there come blood pharaoh said moses next day pharaoh you ready to let god's people go no

may not mean my stupid it about made me tear my office down moses never got on his knees before pharaoh and asked to leave israel because he had been on his knees before jesus christ therefore he

the grocery store you can walk right into your class you can walk right into the kitchen and you can have real joy in your life and when situations come that want to try to dampen that joy that's a time right there to just go ahead and praise the lord it's a time you know the scripture says it's a sacrifice of praise it's not too hard to praise god when you feel like it but when it's the times that you don't feel like it well i don't feel too anointed but that's a time to reach out because he's worthy it's because of what he's done and you know what i'm talking about you press just a little bit beyond that that's what happened right here this morning it was the word that spoke to your heart and drew you to just let you see that no matter what it is that could bump against you if you just press beyond that amen there is a strength and a power within you just like it is within that airplane to break the sound barrier you're built to break the sound barrier amen you're built as a son and daughter of god amen oh i just love him don't you i just appreciate what he's done for us in this in these services amen you know you think about it in services that we have the very first thing that moses asked when he went in there he was instructed by god to ask pharaoh he said i want you to tell him i want the people to go on a three-day journey and go sacrifice of course pharaoh wouldn't let it go but there's a time there's special moments that we have like this special times of a real renewing a re-dedicating a reconsecrating and a time where god just comes down and does a real deep work
