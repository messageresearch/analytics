as we come to open your word and read from it this morning we pray Lord as we open the word and read from it dear God may you open our understanding dear God May Lord that you speak to us in a way this morning dear God that would just be a an encouragement and help to your body of Believers this morning we ask for you to receive all glory from this service we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen uh amen while you're standing be turn with your Bibles to First Corinthians uh chapter 13 I want to read uh one verse of scripture there verse uh 12 for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as I am knowing amen you may be seated i' like to speak on this morning is through a glass Darkly Paul as Paul writes this here the the actually the translation of the word glass is actually mirror uh and so Paul is saying that we as we behold what we are beholding now the revelation we have uh you you realize God wanted to reveal himself first in Christ uh but then God wanted to reveal himself in you the believer and so as we look at ourselves to see the revelation of God actually in us with a changed life Paul is referring to that we're like as looking in a mirror but he says it's like we're looking through one Darkly and the word Darkly means that it what we're seeing is something that is obscure an uh that it's uh the reality of what we're trying to see is actually obscured because of the the mirror uh it also Al translates to the word enigma or like a a riddle it's something that we're looking but we can't see it clearly and you realize the uh uh analogy analogy that uh Paul is using here because you you find that what was mirrors in that day well you know in our at some point within uh man's modernization in that mirrors became glass with reflective thing behind the glass and that and you know your image would begin to come a little more clearly looking at it but at that time they actually would use metals and they would polish those metals to get uh to be able to see the reflection so looking at their uh uh if you ever tried to look at your reflection in in in metal or something like that it it it is not as clear as your common mirrors that you use today but that was the mirrors that they had then the first mention actually of mirrors in the Bible is in the the uh uh the days of Moses when God instructed him to make a labor of brass uh to put in the the Tabernacle uh for the the the priest to come and to wash in that labor before going into the holy place and that it says they gathered the looking glasses of the Israelite women to take and make uh the to melt them down and make this brass labor well the looking glasses and that's the word it uses there in the Old Testament the looking glasses were actually made of brass and that it was polished brass and that's what the people would look in but as you look in a reflection like that you know your image would be kind of obscure you know uh it wouldn't be that clear and that's what Paul is referring to to that uh as we look through a glass Darkly with a mirror we're we're actually trying to see the revelation of Jesus Christ of what's Happening Here but what we see and what's pointed out to us all the time is this old Badger skin that we live in and and and that's what we're looking at and this Badger skin doesn't look anything like what God's word says that we look like you know uh the the Bible tells us that there was coming a time when the shadow became the reality that God was going to take and and the the word was no longer going to be on tablets of stone put into uh the the beautiful Arc of the Covenant but that it was going to be wrote in the hearts uh of of his his Believers and but we look at when it was on the tablet of stone in the the Ark of the Covenant and you look at the description of the Ark of the Covenant it was something very beautiful and and and it was to reflect that what was actually the word of God on the inside was a very beautiful thing but that thing of beauty that represented God was hid behind a veil of badger skin which was a representation of the human flesh so the word of God revealed the the revelation of God that happened in your life to change you and that has made you what you are today it's still hid behind this wall of badger skin and flesh and so when we look in the mirror to see God in us so we look and we see our faults we see our failures we see the temptation of our flesh we see all the failures of our flesh that's good so we really can't see when we looking in this glass dark we're not actually seeing reality we're seeing what came about for mankind because of the Disobedience of the word of God in the garden that caused the fall and caus from that day forward man would die and so our bodies we look at it friends if they our bodies do not reflect what as actually the real lust or what's taking place in our heart because we have eternal life Hallelujah we can no more die than God can [Applause] die but when we look here we see a flesh that's dying you know I I look at some people and God bless you if you fall in this category and and and you look at them and and you can look at them and say well this is what they looked like when they were 20 and you look at them and say they still look the same they're just older friends I I don't know what happened to me I don't look anything like I looked when I was 20 if you saw a picture of me at when I stood here at 20 years old and got married and looked at me today you know I'm getting ready to turn 62 you look at me today and you say that is not the same guy so what I see in the mirror is not what I remember it what I'm looking at today and what you look at it's not what you were now you young people God bless you but I'll tell you if time terries you're going to begin to realize more and more what I'm talking about right oh yeah oh friends look yesterday evening I I I was getting out of the shower and I was trying to dry off and I I reached I'm not going to do it again but I reached with my right and back like this just to drve my back and just that little motion pulled something in my arm and it hurt me all night long I'm like what in the world this never i' never had these kind of problems before this body is not a reflection of what God's word says we are going to be it is a reflection that of sin and death Hallelujah imperfect Humanity brother Brandon makes this statement he says it's in the message of the comforter he says you do not see me he said you see my body you don't see me I don't see you because I only see your body he said this is my hand but who is me he says that owns the hand he said this is my body but who is me that that that own that's in that body it's a spirit I and if I'm born again it's God's holy spirit God's word living in us so we brother R said when you look you see this you see this R says that's not really me right this body is growing old dying and everything but the real me on the inside isn't dying [Music] it's come alive looking at this body is like looking in a mirror and seeing an imperfect image of who you really are that's good you know you uh uh if you ever been to maybe carnivals or things like that they'll have what they call a a house of mirrors or a funny house or whatever and that and you go in there and they got all these different kind of mirrors and you look in those mirrors and they kind of distort you and they can make you look skinny and make you look fat and they can you know distort your image and all that and we're looking at a distorted image when we look at ourselves now I'm not now I want to move Beyond just the the physical looking at our body to to actually look at how we look at ourselves and we see our we see that we make mistakes we see that we have faults we see that no matter how H how much we want to be good you know as Paul says I I want to be good but evil is always present I I I've got to fight with this thing of this flesh and it's because friends when you got a change in your soul there was no change happened to your flesh that's right that's good so brother Brenham says he says my worst enemy is William brandom he was talking about his flesh when I would do good Evil's present Hallelujah so when we when we take a look at ourselves and and we see that uh the times that we can look and we say well boy you know I was feeling pretty much like a Christian there until just the other day and and then I I this or happened and that boy I don't know and you know and S friends look Satan comes to tell you these things and he wants to he wants to stop you from coming to church he wants to stop you from serving God but look what he'll do when it gets close to the day for service how how many times especially during the week sometime right before you know Thursday to come to service and that something happens and the next thing a thought throw goes through your mind I don't even feel like going to church now that's right that's right you're look quit looking at your Humanity friends look as brother as I I said last Sunday brother says we are not perfect in this life and we never will be perfect in this life and and looking at our human but but you actually are perfect the Bible says but it's not talking about you and your Humanity here it's talking about what happened in your soul by by the the the sacrifice that we have become part of of Jesus Christ right so as we we look at this we look at ourselves we think on ourselves sometimes we can't believe what we're seeing yeah because it's not it's not the perfect realization of who we are Hallelujah that's good as as I read to you last Sunday brother B I'm talking about the the sacrifice and the the red heer you know he says God looking through the blood of the Lord Jesus sees you a red sinner white as snow right right so what we need to do is we need to start looking at how God looks at us amen see uh brother B said if we could only look and see as God sees how much different things would look to us right amen hallelujah now in Revelations 3:14 I want to draw something from there uh it says here in the scripture and unto the angel of the Church of L toy and write these things sayth the amen the faithful and true witness praise the Lord now and I'm sure you're very familiar with this no doubt I've read the church age book and things but I I just want to focus on this a little bit that that meaning of the word actually true there the word true there is not referring to the opposite of false what it is referring to is actually an expression of uh of of perfect realization in contrast to partial realization all right so uh you know Jesus says here to John I am the the the the true witness all right so in other words I'm the perfect realization so so the the Bible says uh in John Moos Jesus says Moses gave you not uh the bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven so they received Mana that that God uh would would come down from heaven for the children of Israel when they were journeying in the in the wilderness and so they would go out and they would gather up this Mana this bread Angel bread uh they would gather it up and but they were instructed you know gather up eat what you're going to eat for that day but don't don't try to keep any over because if you do it's going to canker it's going to get worms you know and and and but to point to what the see that was a partial realization or a shadow of what God was pointing to when the promise would be fulfilled that that the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent the coming of Christ so it was it was a shadow pointing to that and so here they would gather that bread but as a a shadow pointing to the perfect realization that that was to come the priest went out and on the first day gathered the first time the bread fell took it put it in the in in in the golden Omar took that and that was put into the holies of holies into the presence of God and that bread unlike the bread that was out there in the well that bread never decayed that bread never got worms in it what was it it was the shadow pointing at the perfect realization that was going to come and then that's when the perfect realization come that's what Jesus was saying I am the bread that came from [Applause] Heaven your fathers did eat Mana in the wilderness and there everyone dead he said but I am the bread that came from heaven in other words I am the perfect realization of what that was point pointing to I am the true witness of the bread Hallelujah he says uh Jesus says in John 15:1 I am the True Vine Hallelujah I am the True Vine the perfect realization of the life of God Glory Hallelujah Paul writes in Hebrews 9:24 for Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for us so what Paul is writing here he's saying he's pointing at the there at that time they had the the temple in Jerusalem and they had they had it was set up just like the Tabernacle and the Wilderness had been and here they had the three courts and he says Christ has not entered into that there in the temple because that was just a pointing at what the true was but he has entered into the true holies of holies he has in gone into heaven to stand before God himself in place for you hallelujah hallelujah John in first John John writes because the darkness is pass the True Light now shineth what what what's this Darkness the darkness was all the shadows and type that they were living in the law that they were keeping right it was it was like looking at it in a glass Darkly it was the in the darkness it was in the shadow but but John says now the true light or perfect realization of the light now shines now Israel had light in in when they were in Goan they were at one point the only place that there was any light right literally all of Egypt Darkness fell over it right but then spiritually they had light that that that that because Moses uh you know the the the the scriptures relative to the Messiah that Moses wrote the Revelation pointing to the coming of the Messiah so so they had light that was given to them and then uh the prophets they brought light by by the the prophecies uh pointing to the coming of the Messiah but it but it was brother brand said but it was I it was partial right it was light but it was not the True Light that John talked about that would come and what he was saying is the that was light pointing to light was partial realization but when Christ came it was he he was the light it was no longer prophesying that pointing to the light but he was the the the the person of the light brother says this but he says but now the Fulfillment of the light has come and what was but glowing word was now broken forth into the brightness of God manifested among his people a pillar of fire gave light at night and that was wonderful but now the light of life was manifested in the fullness of the godhead bodily amen amen so he as John writes he was the True Light he was the perfect manifestation of light Hallelujah Moses was a manifestation of the light right but friends Moses was just as much a sinner as all the rest of them right Moses had need every year for the for the sacrifice for his sins just like all the rest of the people did right but the the Bible when it writes of Christ he will it says he was without sin he was he was the perfect sacrifice brother brother bandam he speaks about uh uh uh Joseph and and he speaks you know said Joseph represented a like a Perfection and that but he says but even Joseph himself was not the complete perfect uh reflection of Christ he said Moses he wasn't the perfect reflection of Christ he said he brother BX says in one place said Joseph was the closest Lord but when Christ came it was the perfect it was Perfection brother benam says in the Philadelphian Church age in the church book he says when Christ the perfect substitute was given his blood was shed then the life that was in Christ came back upon the repentant Sinner and that life being the perfect life of Christ sinless righteous then the guilty one could go free for he had no desire to to sin the life of Jesus had come back upon him so when they were were sacrificing the heph and and these sacrifices Paul called it the blood of bulls and goats uh when they were making these sacrifice the reason there was a necessity for a sacrifice uh continuing to to give these sacrifices is because the life of the sacrifice could not come back upon the believer and change them it couldn't take the desire away but why Christ could be the perfect sacrifice and why that his sacrifice could actually uh uh uh uh uh be be once and for all and we never need another sacrifice because the life of our sacrifice came back upon the believer that's the change that's happened in you when you receive the Holy Ghost it was the very life of God that is in you [Applause] now and you trying to look at yourself to see the very life of God that's in you to try to see the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit that's in you you're looking through a glass Darkly that is so good yes sir that is so good Hallelujah you're you're seeing you're seeing it but it's still an obscure thing no matter how much you can see the revelation of it in the word no matter how much you can see the revelation of the message it's still an obscure thing because it's not act this body is not the reality of it yet you're you're only one part of your being you're a Triune being only one part of your being is the reality of it and that's your soul Hallelujah brother Venom says this in the latest sin Church age he says uh whom we having not seen we ye uh ye love in whom though now you see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory he said we haven't seen him but we have felt him we know him as much much as our limited senses can let us but one day it will be face to face Hallelujah and he said he says he's coming at the end of the age he says we are in partial realization but that partial realization will be made perfect realization complete realization Hallelujah we have been looking through through a glass Darkly but soon we shall be face to face for we shall be like him wonderously like him he said we are complet in him that's true he would not lie about that but one day we will be changed in the atoms we will put on immortality we will be swallowed up in life Hallelujah then will we realize realization amen hallelujah hallelujah glory to God he is the faithful and true witness brother Bram says that's good he said some he said some uh Believers and and and Christians and people in that he says they believe that that God he he created man and then after created him became such a impersonal God that he just kind of stood back and just let happen whatever was going to happen to man and that he just folded his arms brother random said and and stood back it was uh if we were uh as if we majored in believing in a great Creator who having created lost all personal interest in his creation that is beautiful he said now I that that is how many people are apt to think but that is the wrong thinking for where God is governing the Affairs of men right now he is both Creator and sustainer sir and then brother renam goes right in to to Colossians uh one and he says for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are on earth visible and invisible right whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities of powers all things are created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist he says the he says he is a sovereign God by his own counsel he purposed The Plan of Salvation of his own elect which he fornew the son died upon the cross to establish a means of Salvation and the Holy Spirit carefully executed the will of the father he was working all things at this moment according to the purpose of his own will he is right in the midst of it all he's in the midst of his church this great Creator savior God is Faithfully working amongst his people right now as the great Shepherd of the sheep right amen hallelujah he said he is true to us amen he will lose none of us but rais us up at the last day I'm glad that I'm resting on his faithfulness and then he quotes being confident of this very thing that he which had begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ how do I know that I I that I am going to have that perfect realization be that perfect realization of the revelation of God in a child of God first of all I I've got the title deed right hallu I I I I've received this the the spirit right hallelujah amen I've got the proof it's the spirit amen next it's because he is the word and he said that this work that he started in me he will finish it hallelu so it's not on me and you we believed and friends the reason you believed and accepted it is because brother R says he brought about salvation for his elect that's right you know people say you know God's a god of love God is love the Bible says they say oh Jesus he just loves everybody it says for God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son friends I want to tell you something God loves his own but to be just to be just he had to make a provision that for anybody that would accept it would have the opportunity otherwise friends he couldn't be just and actually bring to judgment those that wouldn't accept unless everybody had the opportunity right but look friends when when God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son it the Bible tells us it's like a treasure that was that that when they found this treasure they hid it in a field and then in order to obtain the treasure they went out and purchased the entire field that's what God given his only son for for for the Salvation offered to the entire world he purchased it for everyone but he did it because he wanted you were the treasure in the world or in the [Music] [Applause] field when you look at that uh passage in in the Bible that I just referred to about the treasure in the field it goes on Jesus is given these Parables and it and and it goes on to say the gospel is like a great net that is cast out and when the net is pulled in it brings in all manner of creatures that are pulled in with this gospel net brother Brandon when he preached on it he said you know it that gospel net he said it'll pull in Turtles it'll pull in snakes it it'll pull in all these other things and that you know mud puppies and everything else he said but that's not what God's casting the net for what God's casting the net for is his elect SE the [Applause] fish remember Jesus saying follow me I'll make you Fishers of Men brother R said don't worry about them Turtles don't worry about them snakes he said they'll crawl out of the boat or the church and they'll go right back out there that's what Jesus given his Parable but the gospel net was saying look he cast The Gospel net out yes but really what he was going for was his elect because he knows they are the only ones that will believe it accept it amen and they're the only ones that are redeemable look friends he he he speaks to the the priests and and and the the the Jewish uh religious men of that day Jesus did they they called him belah the very one that they would read the prophecies and and read those prophecies and those prophecies poting to him and the Fulfillment the perfect realization of those prophecies they looked at it and couldn't see it that's right brother Ram said you know why he said because they didn't have any representation he said their representation was not over there in heaven no he said but the difference of the woman at the well who in this life her reflection of of humanity in this life she was an ill famed woman she was married and divorced and married and divorced and married and divorced and from man to man and Jesus says and the man you're with now you're not even married to him so the her reflection when she came to the well was was a was not a reflection C of of of anything perfect but brother Ram said what was the difference between her and the priest at the temple that called Jesus bsub said she had representation over [Music] there and that's why her living as a as the Bible says an ill famed woman that she could look and say I believe you're the Messiah that's right she didn't have she didn't have all the teaching and and education and everything that the priest down at the temple had no doubt she might not have even been able to actually if she'd had got a hold of old testament's roles she might not even been able to actually read them so when she she was quoting it to to Jesus she says our fathers say right right that we shall that that uh it says the Jews say you should Worship in Jerusalem she said our father said we should Worship in the mountain what do you say Jesus looking there and say okay look that was a partial realization the the temple the mountain was a partial realization he said the day is coming and now is when you shall worship Him in spirit and in truth there that word truth is again you're going to worship Him in complete realization perfect [Music] realization hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord First John 3 John writes he says beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be right but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is amen it does not yet appear That's why we're we're looking it's like us looking into a a mirror and we're seeing an obscure reflection right a glass Darkly an obscure reflection of who we really are but one day the Bible says for we know that when this Earthly House of this Tabernacle and the Earthly house this Tabernacle that is the Obscure reflection of who we really are when this this obscure reflection is dissolved praise God we have a building an house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens right so how do you know that you have that there you know that's one of the things that I don't know uh you know my parents you know they can't came into the revelation of this message when I was just a real young boy I mean I can remember before we came into it but I I was just a young boy and and that and and and and things but as I begin to grow older and that you know and you've got to have an experience everybody's got to have an experience for himself don't matter who your daddy and mommy is and as I begin to come older you know Satan could never convince me this message wasn't true I I I got a re ation of that when I was a child this is true but you know what he was always trying to convince me but you not one of them Satan never tried to convince me there's not going to be a Rapture he never tried to convince me that that that Jesus wasn't coming again he never tried to convince me there wasn't going to be a marriage supper of the Lamb Satan didn't try to convince me that the message wasn't true he just always tried to convince me that I wasn't part that I wasn't one of them as the song says and and what he would do is even coming up as an older you know teenager and that I I would look at I would look at desires I would look at the The Faults of My Flesh I would look at all of my mistakes I and I I would at different times CU friend look I I wasn't always growing up and that I wasn't always under my dad's Ministry there was times I was other places in that and but coming up and hearing different preachers camp meetings and places I attended and different things like that I I I begin to get this the what I need to do is I need to get the Holy Ghost but I had this idea if I get the Holy Ghost that's going to make me perfect I won't I won't I won't be bothered by these things anymore I won't make mistakes anymore and and I would look at at other men in that and I I would see them and the way they projected themselves they kind of projected themselves that they were perfect and I was like I I I'll never make that I'll never be like them and I would say look uh I would look in the Bible and I would see where it said Jesus was tempted in every way such as knowing to man yes and sometimes when I would make that expression and say that whoever I was making the expression to would say yes but without sin and man that would just beat me back down again because I was looking at and saying look Jesus knows what I'm going through yeah but then I was getting beat back down about that yeah but you know you're not one of them because he done it without sin you ain't never going to be able to do that but then you look in the word and the word tells you that's true you're not is that I read to you last Sunday John said If any man says they don't have sin they're a [Music] liar look we were freed from the desire of sin the real you the one you cannot see in this reflection is free of [Applause] sin but we're still Shackled by this body we're still Shackled by this Humanity this veil of humanity yeah yeah amen and and and Paul writes and lets us know look what that means is the real you on the inside has got to die to this flesh every day you got to crucify the flesh Paul says hallelujah hallelujah amen so but there's coming a Time that the Bible tells me that I'm going to become not just an obscure reflection of what's took place in here but this outside these other two uh uh uh Realms of my being you're a Triune being remember brother said that right so the other two parts of that Triune being that makes up you is going to finally come up and match what's the real you that's on the inside hallah Hallelujah he says Earnest he says we grown earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from Heaven remember what I said about the woman at the well the priest of the temple she had representation over there he he didn't brother B actually says in another place he says you know people say well my god of love surely he wouldn't destroy his children and and brother Ram says you don't understand the love of God you don't even know what love is he says you are correct God will not destroy his children he said but Satan will destroy his children that's so good and then brother BR it's a man that he's talking to I think it was a Jehovah Witness something but anyway brother bam says whose child are you Hallelujah whose child are you true God's not going to destroy his children he came and made a way for his children but whose child are you and then brother renham says look what what what you are is actually a reflection of who you are there in in some other realm your life he said is actually a reflection of what you are in some other realm he says if it's from the realm of there then you in you in your life is a reflection that of that real you that's there he said but if the life in the individual is a reflection of of what they really are and it's from down there he saids and that shows whose child you are right and then I'll take you back to the quote that we refer to so often when brother Ram talking about that representation that the woman at the well had and that and he says when you heard this end time truth amen and accepted it to be true and believed it he said you heard from your theophany or your representation or your house that is from the heavens that you are going to be clothed withl when this reflection this obscure reflection is is dissolved the Bible says if so being clothed Paul said we shall not be found naked right look friends right now we look at our Humanity here and and you know and and we there's times look we actually begin to feel like Adam and Eve felt in the garden when they they you know when they had sinned I'm naked Hallelujah but what we're not naked we are clothed with his word we are clothed with his spirit and one day you know we stand here we we're not going to be standing in this body but we be standing in the perfect realization that new body Hallelujah and Paul says for not that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that immortality would be swallowed up of Life Paul says again now I say Brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither doth corruption inherit incorruption but I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed amen the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed corruptible must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality corruption shall be shall have put on incorruption and this mortality shall have put on immortality then shall uh be brought to Pastor saying that death is swallowed up in Victory your Humanity that you live in today is actually a reflection of death true that's why it's I'm telling you it's not a reflection of who you really are hallelujah hallelujah but one day amen that that death is going to be swallowed up in the victory that Jesus Christ bought and paid for Hallelujah friends I'll tell you what when when when it when I did get the Holy Ghost and it was revealed to me that look that it was my soul the real me that got it not my flesh Hallelujah and and and it was so plain in the word that it it never said when you got the Holy Ghost in here that all of a sudden your flesh was going to become perfect right it didn't say you were going to become you were never going to make mistakes you were never going to have failures you were never going to commit sin right amen as Paul writes in Ephesians 4 said you know we've been sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise says grieve not the spirit of God whereby you've been sealed right putting off from you all malice and strive and envy and and clamoring and and and and evil speaking and right meaning you got the Holy Ghost but what helps you to crucify this flesh daily yeah it's because there's been a change Happening Here you've got the Holy Ghost so brother R says the man down in the engine room runs the ship amen friends thank God it ain't the man up here running the ship cuz this man gets all messed up sometimes but it's a man down in here that's running the ship am sometimes a man up here Satan he's got an inroad there greatest battle ever fought he chose the [Music] Mind Satan tries to convince you of this convince you of that and all that you know but the man down here says nope that's not true that is actually not the true refle ction of who I am that's right Glory Hallelujah my coming to church my reading my Bible my listening to the messages and things that's actually still just a partial realization of who I am the perfect realization is that it's not just me hearing the words it is I am the [Music] [Applause] word I and my father are one [Applause] Hall Jesus praying says that that he says that they as you as I and you are one father that that they will be one like me and you are with USU hallelujah amen hallelujah Lord 2 Corinthians 3 Paul writes but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord amen God so we we are we are like beholding it Paul says within a glass right and he says we're being changed from glory to glory amen so there's been there's been a change that's happened in you but you're not perfect yet you're not the perfect realization of the revelation of Jesus Christ in his bride yet you're a partial realization of it right now living in this life but so we're being changed from glory to glory but brother bam says he says listen to what he says partial reality will become perfect realization complete realization we have been looking through a glass Darkly but soon it shall be face to face we have been going from glory to glory but soon it will be right in the glory and this and and His glory we will shine and we shall be like him brother says he says in that same meage he says one day going from perfect from uh uh partial realization to perfect realization one day we will be changed in the atoms so this Humanity that we see ourselves in today how did that come to be well I I take you back to Genesis when when man uh disbelieved God's word and sinned and death entered in right there was a when God spoke to him said in the day that don't eat of the tree you can eat of every tree the fruit of the fruit of the Trees of the garden except the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil for in the day you eat thereof that day you shall die so their their molecular structure of the atoms of the body that God created for Adam there in the garden couldn't die it was created in a perfect realization but something happened to it when he sinned right right God told him when if you do that something's going to happen and from then you're going to die right right so something happened to man's body and then he began to die from that day forward yeah as as as as we look at the realization or or revelation of this you know Peter says one day with the Lord is as a thousand years God said in the day you Eater of that day you will die you look in the Bible muusa lived to be the longest of any human being ever 900 and some years old he didn't quite make it to a thousand he didn't make it to one complete day in the eyes of God no one has lived a complete day in the Lord since the fall but that's why we're promised that we're going to after the marriage supper we're coming back down here and we're going to have a a time of a millennium and and the time period of that Millennium is specific by the scriptures to be a thousand years years or one day Hall and see Satan is not destroyed at that time because God wants him there to witness that man can live perfect without sin for one entire day in God and what's going to prove that to the devil he can't have any effect on US during that day why can't he have an effect on us because today he can have an effect on you because you're in your human spirit in this flesh body right you get sick in your body yes brother B talks about the gates of the spirit how Satan comes and if if you let him with your thoughts and all these things he he'll kind of try to clog up those channels so that so the word of God that you're hearing that to get Faith get gets caught and blocked off in those channels right but in the time of the Millennium hallelujah we're going to be living in the perfect realization look man's molecular structure the structure of his atams it was changed that's why he died right to give you a further Testament of this when God cursed the serpent he said cursed you're going to be from this day forward on your belly you're going to craw thust shall be your meat all the days of your life you're going to be crawling around in dust now and he says and I'm going to put enity I'm going to I'm going to put an enity where your seed can no longer mingle with the seed of the woman I'm going to put a separation there Hallelujah and so what happened to the serpant right then when he was cursed I can see it now right there in the garden a transformation a body change happened the structure of his atoms began to change right there before their eyes and he went from being a a being that was the most subtle beast of the field that walked upright like a man to being what we look at that resembles a snake to us today amen it changed the molecular structure of the Serpent's body right and because man's molecular structure was changed look when Adam was created he didn't need a Healer right when Adam was created he didn't need a savior he wasn't lost God didn't create his child lost right amen hallelujah but when he sinned then he needed a savior then he needed a Healer then he needed a sacrifice then he needed he needed someone to come that could actually have one hand on God and one hand on Mankind and bridge the gap between the humanity of man in his Fallen State and the perfect God Amen so so the perfect realization of God came down and touched Humanity thank you became us and by becoming us was actually able to take our place and provide a way back to life for us hallelujah one day M says we're beholden in the glass Darkly now he says we're being changed from glory to glory but one day we're actually going to be in the glory we're going to be become the Glory Hallelujah we're going to be like him he says our atoms are going to be changed friends when when you think say what happens when we receive the body change brother Jerry what just the reverse of what happened to Adam in the Garden of Eden when he sinned prise it's still going to be you know brother man says our bodies are made up out of 16 elements your glorified body will be made up out of the same 16 elements this body's made up by the difference is going to be it's going to be a redeemed 16 elements look friends the price for the Redemption of the Earth's already been paid right now what's happening in our souls is a reflection we are redeemed but our bodies in this earth which the price for the Redemption of all that was also paid is not a reflection of that Redemption right now right am right within the Redemption friends it was for you to live forever never grow old right never you know be in a body that was never sick that never grew old that could not die Paul Paul says when when when we come to that complete Redemption he says to Wi the body change yeah yeah Jesus blood wasn't just shed just for us and our Redemption but his blood dropped on the earth to redeem the Earth which was which is where our 16 elements come from to make a Redemption for your body to pay the price that that you would have a body change yes sir [Music] hallelujah hallelujah oh my one day friends Hallelujah the dead in Christ are going to arise amen let let me tell you this we know according to the scriptures when a Believer dies from this life that there's a body waiting on them a theophany right and they go to that theophany and and there they live what we refer to so much about beyond the curtain of time in that Dimension yeah of of the saved but brother Ram says they don't in that theophany body they don't eat they don't sleep so how in a world if we were in a body just like that stuck just in that body as glorious as we make it to be how in a world could we enjoy the marriage supper of the Lamb amen see here's what I'm pointing at friends look when a Believer dies and leaves here and goes into the theophany there's still not the perfect realization of it yet it's still a partial realization it is it is not complete realization yet and that's why the scripture says they without us are not made perfect right brother says look those that are there in the theophany beyond the curtain of time said they got to come back here and pick up a glorified body what does that mean they got to come back here and be clothed upon with with with the 16 elements the redeemed 16 elements of this Earth and then we're changed we we step into off the ovy and our changed but it's not us dropping this flesh and looking down and saying well that's my old flesh look at here I got another body NOP it changes the moleular structure of the flesh you're in it goes from being old to being young again Hallelujah your hair comes back and [Applause] everything I'm not going to look like this 62y old Jerry Browning again brother R says I'm going to go back to looking like the fella that none of y'all can see that this fell is not a reflection of that looks nothing like that [Music] guy you said about the but around the age when you're like 20 years old hallelujah praise the Lord amen but friends you know you know what is you know we talk so much about we'll we'll never die then we'll be in a body that won't die we we we we'll you know we won't get sick anymore and all those things are one wondrous and glorious you know what the most wonderful thing to me about it is it's not just going back to being young it's not getting rid of all the aches and pains of this flesh body the sicknesses and the ailments and the and and all those things it's not just that you said finally every part of me is going to match what's happened to the real me in here amen that's right amen it's going to be able to be to be able to dance around in front of the devil for a thousand years and say look you can't have no more effect on me hallelu oh devil you want to know what kind of chain you're abound by you're looking at it now hallu I am a link in that chain gory it's a chain of circumstance you can no longer affect any part of [Music] me brother Donnie I heard him say some years ago he said the devil's torned me so much he said I want to be right there with God at the end of the Millennium and after the Judgment I want to be able to personally help kick the devil down into the pit yes sir take that devil hallelujah praise the Lord I'll tell you what friends he if you're anything like me and I know you are we're all in this human flesh he beats and pounds on us constantly greatest battle ever fought he beats and pounds on us in our minds he beats and pounds on us by bringing sickness and illness into this flesh body hallelujah thank God for Divine Healing thank God for the faith amen amen hallelujah when I get into a service like this and I really get into the word and God just opening this up and the the the revelation of this and pointing me not not to what it appears like uh that I am in this Humanity but a pointing out to me who I really am boy that begins to feel glorious that gets me excited that's why you hear me talk so much about the body change it's like I said it's not just getting rid of this frail human body it's being like him am even as he is it's actually no longer beholding it in the glass Darkly but being face to face with it Hallelujah let's stand amen Heavenly Father we thank you this morning for your word thank you God it just father the revelation of you in in us they God it's just it's what is Father the Revelation it wasn't stopping with just you coming down and flesh as your son and and taking the uh on our sin and taking our place but it was that the life could come back into us and us be be able to be changed from Glory unto Glory until that final day dear God the complete Redemption is folded and we stand there just like you are hallelujah it's so wonderful Lord to see you in us God it's it's wonderful God to see you came down and became us but it didn't stop there you did that so we might become you amen hallelujah hallelujah without Sinise God hallelujah thank you Lord praise God lord the tempter is not going to be done away with when we go into the Millennium but we'll be like you so Lord no matter what he tries we'll be able to live like you live when you lived here without sin Hallelujah yeah and Lord it didn't even stop there we've still got all the eternities no more time after that time will be completely wiped out never to be no more there'll never be a night we won't have need for for clocks and watches and all those things because it'll be an eternal day hallu forever and ever and ever eternity rolling God age after age after age no end God what's going to be Lord when we're when we're a thousand years out from the judgment and the time when the the devil is been thrown into the pit and death and sin has been completely wiped out and destroyed and a thousand years beyond that will just be started yes amen hallelujah how beautiful Lord thank you today Lord so many times Lord You remind us of just who we are yes yes sir Lord to look in your word the reflection that's in your word what your word says we
