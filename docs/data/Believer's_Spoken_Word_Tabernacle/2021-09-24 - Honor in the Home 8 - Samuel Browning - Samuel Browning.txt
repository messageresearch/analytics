amen what a wonderful time to be living amen glory be to god amen we just want to turn our attention into the word of the lord here tonight and uh i didn't give you these scriptures but if you could just before you put the other scriptures in the bank or however you're going to do it give me ephesians chapter 5 and i want to read through ephesians 5 and we'll start there and just pulling from first corinthians 13 as well i just want to read ephesians 5 under that thought and just for some time tonight just to kind of preserve that and go into some things here [Music] just ask you to be in prayer for us or willing to leave out yourself and some brothers leave out tomorrow morning early for men's meeting and be their gathered brothers and ministering and so if you're just just would be in prayer for us as well that god will just go with us be with us direct us and amen may each of our lives not only just be really edified as well and brother nathan erickson will be here on sunday and we certainly are just grateful to have brother nathan that he would be able to be here his ministry is just such a blessing to the bride of jesus christ and that's just been a real blessing here to us as an assembly so lord willing brother nathan will be here as well on on on sunday morning so everybody love the lord amen let's go to the lord in a word of prayer heavenly father lord jesus we are just so thankful lord this evening dear god that you have given us a privilege and an opportunity that lord we can be able to come together be able to gather lord in your name o god in your presence lord father how we are are thankful for one another but lord it's in your presence that there is fullness of joy it's in your presence lord that we find strength lord we find direction we find encouragement lord we just lord invite you lord tonight lord as you're here that you would just come and just speak to our hearts in a very personal way lord you see father the things lord you know what you've laid on my heart lord and and i just ask that you help me to get aside lord and get out of the way lord that's that's my greatest concern here tonight lord that you can just step down lord and just speak and minister to our needs lord may the spirit of god lord divine revelation just come lord i pray breathe upon the word o god tonight lord and speak to our hearts lord for every need that's here lord o god for body spirit and soul may you just come lord i pray and minister lord healing lord and to every need we pray tonight lord we love you and we thank you now in the name of jesus christ amen what's in ephesians 5 verse 21 i want to just just read from there and just using this we've been coming from here and i just want to start here and just bring this as a background in verse 21 it says submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he's the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband amen may god bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated i just want to just continue to speak on that that thought here on honor in the home and we've been pulling from this in first corinthians 13 from the love of god and a lot of things that can be had as brother branham would would put it he says we have a lot of things he says we have a lot of theology we have a lot of there's a lot of other uh evidences and different things he said but the main the main evidence that we we rest and we can look at is the love of god and remember the love of god it's not a feeling but the love of god is god himself it's the holy ghost this is where paul would write of it that the the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost john would write that if you any man love the world or the things of the world the love of the father is not in him and john would go on to write god is love so it's this is a love we're not born with this we're born here in this earth and we we learn as we come into that of a filial love and that's that's where that we are able to climb to there are the fostering and everything that takes place with between a husband and wife and children and so forth and we we learn those things and you know i just say it you know within this manner there are things that you know you take for example whether it's ducks or or whatever type of the animal and you know it's things that within it remember brother brown said science would call it instinct such as that duck will take out for the water nobody has to teach it or train it to go in that way it just takes out for him brother braham says science calls it instincts he said i call it god and so when we recognize even to how you know the geese or different ones will start moving together to fly south for the winter and so there are things that within that that when now we look at us and in our lives there are things that we that god has placed within us attributes that we don't uh come into or uh i guess say uh go out and bring these attributes into our life such as husband and wife and father and mother they are already packed within our lives it's just like whatever in reality what what god has for you as a young person what god has for you to do that's already packed in your life it's like a suitcase but it must be unpacked but there's one to unpack it and that's the one who packed it so we let god unpack what he has packed within our life and it's not the the things like brother bam talked about all the mud and the muck that's part of the first birth but we're talking about what god packed within that part of the seed that was buried beneath that of the dirt when the spirit of god moves upon that seed and the quickening power of god has come the experience of passing from death unto life it begins to unpack a son and daughter of god and then everything else that is there it begins to unpack itself as as we are in the presence of almighty god and so when we when we are are looking at at these things with that of the love of god we we recognize that the love of god as paul would write of it it is it is the most it's one of the most important things in our life is the holy ghost there is nothing more important brother brahman says with all the purposes in life if we miss that purpose we've missed everything it's and that is the number one main purpose in our life is to be united with jesus christ not just to know the message not just to know a church not just to know god sent a prophet but the objective in life is to be united with jesus christ in the power of his resurrection because when that is taking place i tell you you're talking about arrest it doesn't matter what comes your way it doesn't even matter the things that are out there you can rest in the lord to know that god has everything under his control and those are things you know think of how paul when paul could step away when he was on his way you know there even to jerusalem and paul on his way and he would call you know the elders and he would speak to them and let them know that you know this is my time of departure is nigh here and you know he lets him know there's going to be grievous wolves and men's going to arise from among you speaking perverse things to think of this that in one way you or i would look at that and say well let's shelter that off but paul had such confidence in the revelation and the sovereignty of god that a child of god cannot be deceived because god has given his word for what we have need of in this generation let me just tell you this that no matter what the enemy as he could try to raise his head up god's already got it covered god has sent his word in this generation remember brother ram says when the enemy comes in like a flood that the spirit of god raises a standard against the enemy and he does it by making that word more real and more sure how could you make it more real and more sure is when you meet the god of the word and now that word is now living on the inside of you by the power of the holy ghost that's the standard that backs the enemy down and that is the love of god as it moves within our life and you know love itself brother brown would write it would express it in this way love makes you do things i want you to think of that i'm not going to read these quotes but it's just the statements that brother brown makes love makes you he says in desperation because love itself he said we'll drive your faith out onto the battlefront it shows and you know very well just as i do there are times when the other realms are in opposition to that of the love of god there's things that can try to come into your spirit realm there's even thoughts even thoughts of disdain we can go on and on but this is one thing for sure when the love of god is there nothing can overthrow or get past the love of god he said brother samuel what are you saying i'm saying that there is nothing that can go on if it's wrong where the love of god won't bring you back to the word of god and bring about a repentance in your life and say i'm wrong that's what the love of god does it's active so love it makes you do things now you understand what i'm saying in that i'm not talking about living a life of sin i'm talking about things that even at times in our spirit that can get a little uh uh out of line or our thoughts or our feelings sometimes or we can be hurt we can be offended i'm preaching to humans tonight right well those things can happen like that and maybe not even intentional but thanks be to god for the love of god on the inside it has within it a cleansing power that is able to release the hurt and all that is within it and place it there in the hands of god through the blood of jesus christ thank god for the love of god there's nothing so great as the love of god oh my i wish i had more time just to speak on it maybe we'll take more thursdays on it but let's look here in ephesians five and i want to just i want to deal with this here tonight just to some things as we're looking at ephesians 5 and you know remember when we're looking at this and paul would write it paul is under this inspiration what an example that he has set before the church of the living god of how that a home should operate and i i want you to just to catch this here for a moment you know let me just let me just kind of give this and not not in a way as a disclaimer but just to put it out there i realize that in every sense sometimes you know i'm speaking to older speaking to all sorts and all ages we all can grow but i also realize there's young ones coming on and these things are just don't come by osmosis and paul was very very particular to tell titus speak these things teach these things tell timothy now as i said before this is part of pastoral work i love it amen see in ephesians 5 when paul would write of this under inspiration what an example that he's taking from is that of the lord jesus and his and his bride the church because remember it's his life that his life his love that is projected into the church that he sees reflected back to himself in other words the bride of jesus christ is the bride of jesus christ because not just because we were for ordained before the foundation of the world but because his spirit the holy ghost has come and brought us to him and raised up that seed on the inside that declares itself in our life to be a part of the bride of jesus christ how do we know because our lives and our hearts are submissive to the word of god when the word said turn here we turn there and our lives our testimony reflects jesus christ in all that we do and all that we say and so when we're looking at this great love story this great romance i want you if you would turn in the bible here go back to psalms 22 with me and i'm going to just deal with here tonight a little bit if god will give me just grace and i want to really deal with psalms 23 in the home psalms 23 in the home and look at psalms 22 and 24. now in looking at psalms 22 23 and 24 these are all messianic psalms they all speak of the work of redemption by god coming down and taking upon flesh in chapter 22 without me reading it here tonight it discloses the suffering of the lord jesus in other words life had to be surrendered laying down his life so he found a woman who was worth dying for are you with me he found one that he was worth dying for you see this is where when we look at john 3 16 remember it's the same way when boaz purchased there all of naomi's estate but he did so to get ruth are you hearing me he did it to get ruth and so within this here you find that then in psalms 22 the suffering and of the giving of life and what i want to say is it's a releasing and a laying down of life how could you and i enter in to his life how could we enter into the holy ghost how could we do that except god become flesh and he lay his life down and pave the way so that we could be united with him under the blood by the holy ghost you see it took god coming down and laying down his life oh glory be to god so then notice if you look in the scriptures you have your bible open i don't have this there on the slides but if you have your bible open then you notice in verse 22 of psalms 22 i will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the congregation well i praise thee that's that's him walking in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks that's him proclaiming that name the victory the character the life he is now now he's give his life now he's raised in life to release that life back to you and i to declare his name when when that of a woman and a man comes together what is she doing she's taking on his name is that right so now where there was a separation there in eden now through christ we are still restored back to the original headship of the word is that right now let's look at this here in psalms 23 and i'm just going to just deal with this a little verse by verse and i want you to notice here in psalms 23 verse 1 the lord is my shepherd i shall not want so here in psalms 22 there's a life that's given psalms 23 leads into the caring for what has been purchased and brought to himself which then from the caring in psalms 24 leads to the positioning open up you everlasting gates open up who is the see you can't get that position without all of this the giving and the caring it leads into that third part to reign as king of glory that's the same way that it is even within a marriage it's giving caring and that in itself gives position are you with me oh glory be to god so you see when we look at this in psalms 23 1 the lord is my shepherd that's pretty personal he's my shepherd i shall not want completely satisfied i don't have eyes for no other i'm satisfied the lord is my shepherd i'm content he's my i shall not want because he's my shepherd notice i want you to notice as a shepherd a shepherd will seek out in lives and seek out the right pasture shepherd is not one that's just haphazard of going around it's seeking out the right places the right to to to go to move into and the sheep in the right seasons and so forth as well as what it is that even we're able to handle at a certain time how many know that's true god knows what we're able to handle you know brother branham even wrote brother brown would speak of that in the um the sumerian church age and he would write about those those 10 days and how that that would speak of 10 years you know with dicletion and the emperor and the martyr that would take place brother brahman says god wrote that in there but he did not want to scare the church of the living god and see god would write and see god is so attentive to our needs and to our care he knows what to release just as we have need of it my my my oh my he doesn't god doesn't want to upset the church think of brother branham let me just talk just as he's leading brother brown would tell us in christ the mystery he would give us a little a little view into it and he would speak about the gift and how that the gift and it was more than a gift it was a prophet because it wasn't a gift it was a prophet and that that operation of there of the son of man in a son of man remember what a stewardship that was held in that time to where brother branham himself could say if certain things were disclosed it would get out amongst the people it could cause penitentiary offenses i mean to think if this one's connecting with this one oh boy i tell you what you need more than beacons you need billy clubs on them and holding their thing you see god knows god knows what what is able to be held you see god's desire within it he knows what you and i have need of and what we can handle this is where john john 16 12. let's listen here to the shepherd as he speaks i have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now he knows he's mindful of if i speak this right now you're not going to receive it you're not going to get it and it's not going to do any good it might trouble you god's not interested in the word troubling us he's interested in the word guiding us leading us bringing us to victory he's very attentive but you cannot bear them now how be it when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth this is the evidence of the holy ghost not speaking in tongues not prophesying not praying for the sick and they're healed not preaching not understanding mysteries this is the evidence of the holy ghost because the love of god it is in love with god it is the spirit of truth that leads us into the word this is why a person can live a good clean moral life and still not have the spirit of truth what does the spirit of truth do the new birth it brings a hunger and a thirst and a desire for the word of god and the things of almighty god that's what the spirit of truth does it leads us into all truth he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches is that right now when we look at this the lord is my shepherd i shall not want how many of you had questions still got questions right sometimes we come into things in our life we pray for things and it doesn't it doesn't come about we got questions god is not bothered about questions even when someone passes on and we say what i don't know why why god isn't bothered that's not unbelief oh brother samuel you shouldn't mourn you need to know your bible the bible says we do mourn but we don't mourn as others come on now don't try to take those things away keep yourself balanced in the word we do mourn but we don't mourn as others who have no hope are you with me so now when we come into time there are times we have questions in our life there are times listen we we don't have altogether recorded here in the scriptures i wonder how many times sarah had questions wonder how many times uh brother noah's wife had questions are you hearing me wonder how many times each of them they had questions god's not bothered with questions but he did make a way god did make a way that questions can be addressed and this is where paul would say in first corinthians 14 and he's remember paul he's dealing with let the woman keep silence in the church she's not to speak she's not to preach in the church of the living god she's not to exhort help me now maybe i can bring it on down she's not to be an instagram preacher a facebook pastor hello somebody she's not to be that at all are you with me now now you know he goes on to say if they will learn anything let them ask their husbands at home that's a big responsibility it's a responsibility as a husband to be the spiritual leader of his home the lord is my shepherd i shall not want brother samuel these are big shoes to fill but if you got the big god on the inside he's more than a match for your shoes no matter if you wear size 7 or size 52 he can fill her psalms 32 psalms 23 2. the next scripture he maketh me to lie down in green pastures not barren places notice he maketh me this is not a demand his presence as he brings me into this place he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still water this speaks of a calming and the lord knows we need calming there's times we need calming in our life and he he leads us into green pastures see places where we get nourishment and as when we look at this even this this picture of this we're even talking about where the pests of the bugs and things would you ever watch wildlife sometimes i've watched deer even in our backyard and i've watched them out here when when hunting out here and you see them and the flies are coming on them and they're constantly that tail just flipping and flipping you've seen horses right i mean the mane on the horse we look at and say oh that's a beautiful tail that tail is there for getting them flies and everything else off because them flies are like a pest and like a nuisance this in this scripture he himself will actually has the authority and ability to remove even the pests [Laughter] aren't you glad about that whoo he making me to lie down in green pastures he leaded me beside the still waters questions and answers number three in 1964 brother branham i love the lord but for the past year i have been faced with a problem seeing sometimes i'm almost been out of my mind what is it please pray for me and my husband my brother you know he's going in and he says it's signed a sister in christ i'm just going i'm going to get into reading in here in just a moment but he's he's just he's looking at it and he's saying now if there's something you've done wrong just just confess that make it right and you know if it's something condemning you if it's something from way in the past just just make it right make it right and go on and then he picks up and he says he says but if there's nothing you've done that can be condemned of it's perhaps your nerves it could be many things that happened maybe some trouble back in your life maybe it's a woman here might be in the menopause time and i'm just going to pause here just for a moment there's times at different times that i've just witnessed here over over the years at times in the holy spirit just waking it up and hear it maybe i'm in maybe speaking with some things or dealing with some things and all of a sudden we just drop down wait a minute there's some things going there this is this is a condition that's going on behind the scenes and that menopause that's a real condition now what i'm going to say is this sister rebecca branham she she did a video and it was it was insight into the times where brother branham was uh speaking with her because there were times where sister rebecca and when sister media was going through this time right here but brother branham worked with such wisdom to explain the things that was taking place and going on because when brother brown goes into this and if and if you'd like to see that it's it's it's available we can get you the link because i would suggest i would highly suggest that if you're into the into this time or coming into the time it would be good to watch because it's very very good on how brother branham worked with this this was a situation that that home where there was a little of a contention here seemingly between sister media and sister uh rebecca but here the spirit of god come down and gave such wisdom without taking either side gave such wisdom to help her to see what's taking place this is really not your mother but he didn't tear her down either so that sister rebecca still had greatest respect for her mother it's just powerful i tell you you tell me god don't have the answer for what we have need of he sure does so if you'd like to have you can contact my wife or myself we'll get you the link i would i would just love for you to to to see that and it'd be oh brother samuel my wife no you might need to see it too maybe it's a woman here might be in menopause time that's when everything is wrong with her and there's nothing wrong with her yet everything's wrong with her and she's not just putting on she really feels that it's just as real any person that's nervous is that way oh so now he's also dealing with anybody who's nervous is that way so we got two conditions menopause we have nervousness and even how that those things can move together and notice he says and that and and any person that's nervous is that way and don't never disagree it's okay help me jesus because it's like [Music] i have to use examples as they come to me it's like my you know my father-in-law told me you know when he was working there as a uh as an lpn you go into the you go into the the room of the residence here they are uh with dementia and alzheimer's and they're up at three in the morning they're getting ready because they're gonna go milk the cows what should you do you don't tell them oh there's no such thing as that you're here don't argue with them just help them get their clothes on hey yeah we got to milk them cows today we got to go do that because you know what happens when you argue it creates attention and they get angry are you hearing me now so when we look at this don't disagree this is an understanding that comes to it and the understanding is you won't understand but just understand that you don't understand [Laughter] and you husbands to your wife when they're in that time of life if she ever was your sweetheart you let her be right then cause she needs you she really needs your help she needs somebody to help her and understand her if we can say it like this she needs a good ear a good ear and an open heart is that all right and that's not something i would say this that's not something to wait until until till this time of life that's good right now talk to her take her up in your arms like she was your sweetheart she should be and understand her because she's going through a time that her entire makeup is changing and you must be good to her at that time i want you to look at this in psalms 94 19 let me just go through some scriptures here here as he makes us to lay down green pastures beside the still waters in the multitude david said in the multitude of my thoughts my anxieties within me thy comforts delight my soul david's not saying oh my that you know there's not times of anxious moments but he's saying what combats that anxious moment thy comforts delight my soul psalms 4 or psalms 4 philippians 4 verse 6 be careful for nothing that means be anxious for nothing that's easy to tell somebody hey don't be anxious don't be anxious like that's going to be like the you know hey don't be anxious like all of a sudden because you said it somebody's not going to be try that on yourself come on somebody oh you just got to take the word what about you taking the word when you go through something oh come on you're not in any pain what about when you're in pain [Music] well that was free be careful for nothing be anxious for nothing notice david i love this scripture psalms 56 3 what time i am afraid i will trust in thee david's real david was an honest man i mean there might be times he tried to hide things but when he got in the friends of god and there are things that came out you're the man david said forgive me lord amen david was there before god and what david is writing there is times that fear that we can be afraid there's times of uncertainty but what time i am afraid i will trust in thee this was a decision to be made because you know why david had confidence in one that he could trust in taking the focus first peter 5 6 humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care all your anxieties upon him for he careth for you look at this in psalms 63 7 because thou has been my help therefore in the shadow of thy wings will i rejoice did you catch that because that has been my help in every every other time you have been my help massacre the one who has come to my aid so now david says therefore in the shadow the protection of thy wings will i rejoice david do you mean there's no more tests there's no more trials do you mean there's no more times that you won't feel afraid no that's not what i'm saying at all what i'm saying is because thou hast been my help before that when things arise i am going to rejoice under your wings because you'll lead me to green pastures you cause me to lay down beside the still waters oh glory be to god my soul followeth hard after thee thy right hand upholdeth me psalm or philippians 3 verse 10 paul would write that i may know him in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings it's like the vows that are said sickness sorrow things are good tough times and on and on all that comes in it's a it's it's a vow a word it's what what our lives have come into right here when that covenant is being entered into and notice the fellowship of his sufferings you know the things that you go through even when it comes to of a church comes to a marriage the things you go through if you allow god it'll make you stronger you don't come out weaker job said i know when i shall come forth from all of this i'll come forth as pure as gold that's what job said entering into it is that right i mean we're not taking in all the the account of down through time where job starts looking at himself and trying to start justifying himself but in the beginning joe knew when i get when i come out of this i'm going to come forth pure is gold he's recognizing there's one who's over this there's one who's watching over and there's a fellowship of his sufferings there's a time even you know sometimes we look at things and say god why am i going through this or lord this you know maybe there's things you prayed about you've been praying about and things you're waiting on and the doctor report you still got the same doctor report same doctor report and then the enemy let's just jump on his case a little bit then the enemy wants to come along and say well if you had faith that booger knows the quotes all right but let me just put it to you like this faith itself isn't always that it brings the promise to pass right then neither is faith itself oh that that is what's exhibited then after a period of time the promise comes to pass faith is being exhibited that no matter what takes place god is and what he said he is just and faithful in all his actions it's easy to have faith and say whoa glory to god when prayers are being answered are you hearing me and i don't want to just say easy to have faith but what about it when it comes down to times when prayers themselves are things that you're praying about and it seems like that there's no answer coming that's a time that really requires faith as well just as much faith as miracle working faith don't have time to go into examples on that but let me just say it like this because we i mean i'm challenged by this i'm challenged by this leadership leadership itself it isn't always having the answers brother brahma just said it very cleanly he said if you talk to a man he's got all the answers you better get away from him simple as that you got everybody they know they get away from them because that's wrong is that right i mean we can go on and on through the scripture leadership isn't always having the answers but it's having confidence in the living god who's guiding you and he is the answer he don't just have an answer he is the answer and he'll operate through his ordained channel to provide leadership it's like when as paul would write but i would have you to know that that the head of every man is christ the head of the woman is the man the head of christ is god leadership leadership is to seek him and recognize his leading if you're seeking after his will the greatest thing you can do is say god let my heart my spirit let everything be neutral just tell me to be sensitive just help me to be sensitive because let me just say this how many times are there's things right that we have need of in our life there's not a scripture wrote out right oh thou thou shalt take a trip to phoenix there this i wrote out in the scripture right there's things that you're that you can be asked to do and you're like lord lord i i need a word sometimes it isn't a word as far as that there's road out here but what you have need of is the word himself to come down and really bring a real peace within your heart and for that situation he leadeth me beside the still waters it leadership is to seek him recognize his leading and yield to it let me try to let's try to pick up verse 3 here in psalms 23. we may not get through all this here tonight psalms 23 3 he restoreth my soul indeed he restores our soul by that of the new birth but even in times and situations that transpire in our life like job job got to a place brother brahm said the messengers of satan were coming to him to try to get him to doubt his message trying to get him to doubt it because job job being a prophet knew knew there's an answer he knew that but he didn't know what the answer was job was being affected it wasn't just the trial itself as it goes on it's affecting you know what that trial did when you really can look at job it is a situation that brings to light and view the fragileness of humanity when god said there's a man who's perfect and upright he wasn't talking about the flesh of job he was talking about that job which was one of the sons that shouted for joy before the foundation of the world because this flesh and our spirit it can crumble sometimes under the midst of situations and trials that come our way there's an anchor on the inside that holds us and he restoreth my soul samuel these are big words for husbands and but remember you got a big god there's a big god not out here but that that great big god would make himself so small that he would come and dwell in that part of his word that channel that he reserved for himself in this hour in your life think of this he restoreth my soul second corinthians chapter one verse three oh hallelujah look how paul would write this blessed be god even the father of our lord jesus christ the father of mercies and the god of all comfort there's sometimes there's a lot of words or things that can be portrayed as comfort that's not comfort it's not comfort at all because it really doesn't minister to the situation but the god of all comforts so we're talking about a comfort that's higher than that of just human compassion yet we need human compassion are you hearing me now paul wrote in romans in first in first timothy there that this is the hour in this time where men are lovers of themselves truth breakers and without natural affection in other words let me put it in layman's terms instead of ducks going naturally instinctively by god to water they don't know where to go sometimes it's examples listen you don't learn to love by osmosis it's the examples that's put even in front of us and before us are you hearing me now remember in the random when he saw the pentecostals you hear brother ramble talk about this in a message bill graham didn't know what to think of how they were hugging one another and shaking one another and said god bless your brother so good he ain't never he had never seen anything like that before are you hearing me but he learned it brother brown had never even seen expressive worship remember they were dancing right out there on the floor and remember brother branham was sat and he said here i was in the seat of the scornful but then though god began to deal with his heart upon that of the word he started patting his foot oh my he was right out in the aisle dancing with those sisters [Applause] come on now you see when we look at it there's things that we we have to learn and i want to continue to learn and grow you know i thank god for the example i really do of of my of my father and of my mother i thank god for that i i'm grateful for a godly example but i don't limit it to the example that i've seen are you hearing me and because why that's limiting god there are things that it could go higher it can go higher it can go higher it can go deeper let me finish this second corinthians 1 verse 4 who comforted us he's the god of all comfort who does what comforteth us in all our tribulation so he's very attentive to what's going on he doesn't remove the tribulation but he's there to comfort us through that we notice that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble oh so experience through the fellowship of sufferings it builds within our life to be even more sensitive to these needs i've never let me just say this here let me pause here for a moment you know when my wife has had i think it was from when we were honey was it like a year right after we were married or within that year you had a kidney stone attack or whatever more never experienced anything she had never experienced anything like that and um i i mean you're you're just looking at it here i am praying satan i rebuke you in the name of jesus christ you know right and i'm not saying that losing i'm just saying i here i am i'm praying and i'm praying many times we had to go to the hospital oh brother samuel was that a weakness of faith no that was the pathway that god wanted sometimes god has to humble us down a little bit tap us down but you know i i couldn't understand you know that pain by god's grace i had some pain when i played football but thanks be to god i never had any serious injury i thank god for that i think some things i deal with today from that but i never had anything then i couldn't really relate to that i didn't look down and tell oh get up come on but it was a lot of things that then as i had to take i had to take her word for it and looking at i could see she was in pain you know not just been that but then when there had to be some times that came along my way with my back oh times when i'm walking through the school and i'm like this i get out of the car and i'm like this walking the whole day i can't even stand up straight and you got parent-teacher comments don't sit down because you set down the spasms just stand up wait for the next person to come in even when you teach the whole day but you what you say what are you saying brother saint that in through that god's comfort through that experience it allowed me to have a deeper understand not just for her but for others as well you see something's got to let you go through things sometimes and what he allows you to go through is not just about you but it's also that we might have a greater feeling one for another right let me close this here this is not gonna be sunday where i keep saying you know that we might be able to comfort them which are in any trouble by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of god i love this this quote let me read it this is brother neville praying brother branham's asked by the neville to pray and here's brother here's brother neville's words father the great problems and the trials of tomorrow will seem as nothing as we're able to hold thy hand and walk through with thee brother brahman said truly lord but the devil says we pray lord that thou would give us a deep seated compassion one for the other knowing that while one is in the deepness of trial and the hardness of testing that we too one of these days shall go through like circumstances god give us the spirit of jesus in us till we feel for each other enough until there will be unity between us until we can serve thee together restoreth my soul you know we write and i just close here you find it in the scripture and i i don't i'm not going to take any more time with it but you find in the scripture of the refreshing and how that paul would write of of the refreshing that they would receive in the midst of tests and of the midst of trial we know what refreshing is refreshing it's just as what it says it's like a it's just it's refreshing it's when you're beside the still waters you're it's a refreshing there's a it just has a way of bringing a cleansing and a you know it just uh puts a pep in your step and yet at the same time it just eases all the tension and paul would write of different ones philemon on and on different ones of how that the church of the living god was refreshed by you my brother god intended that by the refreshing of the holy ghost in our life that we would be a refreshment one to another even in our homes even in the assembly to be a refreshment one to another he restoreth my soul just like he did job when job had come through all of the tests and the trial and how things come around at the end the things that god lays down for job to do even at the end as it's all said and done it's god who restored his soul some through the midst of the greatest test and the greatest trial that's where the vows are proven this is where a christian life is really it's it's it's one thing a person can live so oh i tell you everything's going so good it's going so good it's going but what about when things themselves start going a different way that's what really shows christianity that's what really shows the goods are you with me i mean it's not about it's even in the times when we don't i think paul was singing about this tonight as he was ad-libbing in some of those verses even the times when you don't feel like it but he's still worthy even in those times he's worthy may god help us in our homes and our church in our lives may god help us but then just as we looked at a few verses tonight lord willing we'll pick it up next thursday here on psalms 23 but to see this psalm in the midst of the home because it's a song of care one who has given his life now his life comes forth to minister care to our lives he cares about you even he cares for a life that is bound with sin he cares he cares enough to set you free he cares enough to bring complete deliverance he cares enough to bring healing to your life he's already done it if you just accept the care he cares do you pray heavenly father lord as we just come before you lord jesus just as lord in looking at these things lord just as inspiration lord just flowing just lord as it were just finding myself lord as though my breath is taken away and then at times lord just just lord my heart just just like a great big grape lord being crushed and just lord we're just just lord just tears of thanksgiving coming out we can see this care we can see father this in our lives lord how that you minister to us lord thank you lord for such an example lord i pray that you're god that for each of our lives help us lord i pray to live in that example i pray god is there's young men coming on lord some lord now they're no longer newlyweds but lord here they here they are in in a time lord in their lord in the beginnings of the marriage and growing and just everything lord just coming together i pray god that you would just continue lord not only for them but the young men that are sitting here lord young ladies all together lord god across this building lord that father this word oh god it would just lord so resonate as such direction such a leadership lord for our lives and lord if there's a heart here or listening that doesn't know you with that claim the lord is my shepherd i shall not want lord may this be a moment lord that they really would consecrate their lives oh god to yield to giving themselves lord to surrender that they might receive that satisfying portion god guide and direct i pray every husband every father lord grandfather lord alike oh god father husband wife lord i pray oh god even as we've looked lord we you've had us looking very heavily upon husbands looking at this responsibility because it is a great responsibility lord for the home but i pray god for every wife [Music] i pray father for every wife and every mother may lord even in their lives you'll be a life that is worthy worthy little god to god up to receive lord may lord every one of us look together to you lord because we can't look at ourselves but we can look to you father and your word as it comes to challenge our hearts we can look to you and we can say lord jesus be it unto me according to thy word lord let it be fulfilled in my life lord guide and direct me lord the appointments your will and what you have for my life oh god guide and me lord let me be sensitive lord because it's not that i have to have all the answers but it's that i have you lord and you have me you are the answer for every question and every situation help us lord like david lord he was very honest what time i am afraid i'll trust in you oh god so many things lord that could come around but there's a confidence because that has been my help [Music] i will reside rejoice under the shadow of thy wings oh granted lord i pray help us lord i pray tonight we love you and thank you now lord in the name

tells this testimony over and over in every message you can listen to love projected divine love every one of us and brother sherrod was a close friend of brother branham and a close friend of brother oral roberts brother sherrod said if i ever get the feeling bad i'll just call brother oral he'll pray for me i'll get better he said i also got brother branham as a friend i'll call him i'll get better you see he had nothing wrong with having confidence in prayer are you hearing me now [Music] a situation came up on his kidneys he went to brother oral had a steak dinner with him brother

goes to the hospital he's laying on the bed and they're getting ready to take him he's getting ready to be put under the last words that come out of his mouth he said lord you know i love you brandon said the doctor's report was such an atmosphere came into that room he still had to have the surgery are you hearing me are you hearing me he still had to have the surgery but there was such an atmosphere in that room brother graham said see what the what it was he said he'd got his eyes on man and he said it had to come back to i love you lord. so no matter what the need is i love you lord i got confidence you i love you lord i love you lord above everything no matter what it is i love you lord and the presence of god came in the room such a successful surgery i'm glad that that example was told to us aren't you it just shows very simply sometimes we get so complex with things and it comes down to simply saying i love you lord i love you lord i love you lord you know what love is a lot of things inside of love we can start unpacking it it's trust it's confidence that's what all gets unpacked inside of love i love you lord i don't understand this love is not about that i
