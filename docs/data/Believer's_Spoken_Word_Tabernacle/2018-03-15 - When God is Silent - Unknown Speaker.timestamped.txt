[39:30] even Lord a word that would be dropped
[39:32] Lord to encourage Lord within that
[39:35] particular need

[40:20] mature sons and daughters of God help us
[40:23] Lord tonight we pray in the name of
[40:25] Jesus Christ amen amen
[40:29] thank you musicians let's look here in
[40:33] the word in Hebrews chapter 13 and just
[40:37] read a few verses of Scripture then
[40:39] we're gonna let you have your seats
[40:50] in verse 5 of Hebrews 13 let your
[40:54] conversation be without covetousness and
[41:00] be content with such things as you have
[41:04] for he saith or he hath said I will
[41:08] never leave thee nor forsake thee so
[41:14] that we may boldly say the Lord is my
[41:18] helper and I will not fear what man
[41:22] shall do unto me may God bless you
[41:27] tonight as you're being seated I just
[41:34] want to look here just for a few moments
[41:37] in the words we've been looking at this
[41:39] on trials for some time now I certainly
[41:43] believe that in our lives that we
[41:46] understand that within trials that's how
[41:48] our character is actually molded and
[41:51] it's made with under trial their
[41:54] sufferings there's tests and there's
[41:56] many different ways that a trial or a
[41:59] test can't um can come to us and
[42:02] sometimes within of a trial it's it's
[42:06] not altogether where we would look at
[42:09] things like for example what took place
[42:11] with Joel or even in situations were
[42:14] Paul and some of the disciples and them
[42:17] found themselves in we know that there
[42:20] are also times that when situations
[42:23] would arise within the life of a
[42:25] believer that there is a promise that
[42:28] God has given and as a believer will we
[42:32] stand upon that promise but yet in some
[42:35] is sometimes there are times where it
[42:37] actually comes down to the trying of our
[42:39] faith and it's a time when God is silent
[42:42] and that's what I want to deal with
[42:44] tonight when God is silent because there
[42:48] are times that we understand that that
[42:51] comes to it and there's a trying of our
[42:54] faith at times when God is silent we we
[42:57] all want to hear from God
[42:58] we all want to hear we we want to know
[43:01] when we're in the midst of a situation
[43:03] maybe even when we're praying about
[43:06] something concerning the will of God we
[43:08] want answers and we want we want not
[43:12] necessarily I would say answers but we
[43:14] want to know what what does he think
[43:16] about it what what does he want from
[43:18] this and you know sometimes when we're
[43:20] looking at it you know God our answer us
[43:22] you know in a way that is he knows how
[43:25] to speak to us personally God knows how
[43:28] with each and every one of you how to
[43:29] speak to you to build your faith God
[43:31] God's not gonna ask you or me to walk
[43:34] after somebody else's faith and somebody
[43:36] else telling you you know I brother Joey
[43:38] you need to do this and need to do that
[43:40] I I need to have that inspired to me God
[43:42] may speak to somebody but I need to have
[43:45] that personal witness within my heart
[43:47] and within my life because I can't go
[43:50] back to that person and say hey did you
[43:53] say that God spoke to you because I'm
[43:54] gonna be tried on where I move and
[43:56] whatever I I do I'm gonna be trial so
[43:58] I've got to know that that was
[43:59] personally from God and God knows how to
[44:02] speak to us and that's why brother
[44:04] Branham would tell us when he's asked a
[44:05] question about how do you find the will
[44:07] of God regarding something and brother
[44:09] Bramblett said well he said God deals
[44:11] with me in a certain way maybe by vision
[44:13] and he said I'll pray about something
[44:15] and I wait a little bit and then he said
[44:17] I may feel towards it and then I'll keep
[44:19] praying and then I feel a little bit
[44:21] more towards it and I'll keep praying
[44:22] and and perhaps God will open a vision
[44:25] to him now you remember that brother
[44:27] Branham within even his self he'd got to
[44:29] such a place he wanted everything to be
[44:32] just like this just like this and
[44:35] there's an element to that that's
[44:36] absolutely wonderful we all want to be
[44:39] hitting the mark is that right but then
[44:41] there's a part of it that it can also be
[44:43] we understand even when we get to
[44:45] looking at our natural are not natural
[44:47] makeup sometimes our natural makeup can
[44:50] be the biggest hindrance but yet when
[44:51] it's yielded into the hands of God it
[44:53] can be one of the greatest things
[44:55] because when brother Branham himself he
[44:56] said he was melancholy a melancholy
[44:58] person is a real perfectionist things
[45:01] has got to be hitting in a certain way
[45:02] and that's a wonderful thing but yet as
[45:05] it's surrendered into the hand of God we
[45:07] also understand how their brother
[45:09] Bentham he felt many times even when the
[45:11] the the the message was going forth he
[45:14] himself had actually be started to
[45:16] develop a complex because he felt that
[45:19] the people ought to have believed it he
[45:22] felt they ought to have done this and
[45:24] and they ought to have went went
[45:26] according to it and and he what happened
[45:27] in the way that he thought that it ought
[45:29] to happen and we understand that he was
[45:31] he was he was troubled within that and
[45:33] he was looking for for it for an answer
[45:36] in a direction from God and then you can
[45:38] find how that brother Bannon was praying
[45:40] in his life about how to conduct his
[45:41] meetings you know he's he's seeing how
[45:43] this one's conducting and how this one's
[45:45] conducting it and and the angel of the
[45:47] Lord how he told him he said he just
[45:49] conducted as you feel led you know it
[45:53] really comes down to having confidence
[45:56] in in that God is with me and and that's
[45:59] the thing that when we look here at this
[46:01] scripture we can desire a lot of things
[46:05] but just to be content to know that God
[46:07] has said I'll never leave you nor
[46:10] forsake you there are times that we feel
[46:12] him and oh how we love to feel his
[46:14] presence there's times when we pray and
[46:16] how his presence comes down and it just
[46:18] lifts us up we love those times but you
[46:21] know it's also in the times when we're
[46:23] praying that maybe you don't feel his
[46:25] presence and when you're going about
[46:27] something and it's not like it has in
[46:29] times past that's a time when you're
[46:31] being tested within a situation you're
[46:34] being tested in that moment to be able
[46:36] to stand within that time and said I
[46:37] know he still is here he's never left me
[46:41] he's never forsaken me
[46:42] this is his word I know where I'm
[46:45] standing on his word I know where my
[46:47] heart is that and I can rest within this
[46:49] and and here we are standing with a
[46:51] Content nurse and then we can say the
[46:53] Lord is my helper
[46:55] he is my helper so when you we think of
[46:59] this when God you know is is silent you
[47:03] know sometimes we we can get all nervous
[47:06] when we're not getting an answer in we
[47:08] got speed-dial going our speed texting
[47:11] going or speed speed facebook and go on
[47:14] our speed twitter going or oh i'm not
[47:16] getting an answer just just just wait
[47:18] he's c silent but he's allowing faith to
[47:22] be tested so when we're looking at this
[47:25] you know
[47:25] sometimes we we feel like in a manner
[47:27] that maybe God ought to be answering
[47:29] like this and we we get into those
[47:31] situations and sometimes how God will
[47:33] move in their situations just just
[47:35] moving just like this and then all of a
[47:37] sudden God will pull back and you find
[47:39] you look at your thing man why don't the
[47:41] answers come in just like they were
[47:43] before why isn't this evident God's
[47:45] checking your faith he's testing your
[47:48] faith is your faith in the time or the
[47:52] duration or the schardt and shortness of
[47:54] the answer coming or is your faith in
[47:57] him you understand what I'm saying is
[48:01] our faith in an answer came like this or
[48:04] is our faith in Him this is where how
[48:07] God will actually bring about and
[48:10] display the great qualities that lay
[48:13] within the lives of a believer and he is
[48:15] the great miner and refiner of waters
[48:18] potentials just showing forth as
[48:20] realities in our life
[48:21] now what you just to think of this where
[48:24] brother Branham goes through this and
[48:27] I'm not gonna read from it so I'm not
[48:28] gonna ask him to put on the screen but
[48:30] remember how brother Branham wouldn't we
[48:32] refer to it a couple of weeks ago how
[48:34] that with the stats cliff family when
[48:35] they were praying about you know their
[48:37] little baby and and wanting you know
[48:39] believing that God would raise it up the
[48:42] doctor believe God will raise the baby
[48:44] up but then how that the Lord spoke to
[48:46] the Prophet he said and don't touch that
[48:48] he said don't go over there and the Lord
[48:51] went ahead and he took the little baby
[48:52] home and brother Branham you know the
[48:55] the lady is questioning in her heart
[48:57] she's questioning you know brother
[48:59] Branham we've prayed and nothing took
[49:00] place and and you know and and do we
[49:03] have faith and brother Graham said oh
[49:04] you've got great faith you've got great
[49:07] faith and and and you know what she's
[49:09] looking at it because you see where
[49:11] she's looking at it and she needs help
[49:14] is that faith itself having great faith
[49:17] does not always equate a miracle or God
[49:21] moving in a manner as far as in this
[49:23] case that healing comes within that
[49:26] manner but here her faith is
[49:28] demonstrated not in the raising of the
[49:31] baby but her faith is demonstrated if
[49:34] that in the midst of it that even when
[49:36] God's God Himself said no
[49:39] I'm not gonna heal him I know what's
[49:40] best her faith stood still in God
[49:45] brother Rama says that's real faith blue
[49:51] beretta made his statement right after
[49:52] and then he says anybody that's a big
[49:55] statement anybody can have faith when
[49:58] mountains are moving now there's times
[50:01] for mountains to move there's times when
[50:04] mountains need to move and God
[50:05] stimulates our faith is that right
[50:07] there's times for that but then he said
[50:10] what about it window when the when the
[50:11] mountains aren't moving he said when
[50:13] we're praying you said and everything
[50:14] seems to go backward he said that's when
[50:17] it takes real faith to be able to stand
[50:20] and that's something that that God alone
[50:24] has has placed within us an anchor that
[50:28] holds us in the midst of that time if
[50:30] you can just remember this thought I'm
[50:32] not going to elaborate on it tonight but
[50:34] just remember this thought Paul said in
[50:37] my flesh there is no good thing in the
[50:43] midst of tests in the midst of trial
[50:45] your flesh and your spirit feels the
[50:48] impact but it is not out of our flesh or
[50:51] out of our spirit that God is pulling
[50:54] out believer qualities but God is
[50:57] bringing out the qualities of a believer
[51:00] that dwell within that soul which is
[51:03] that gene which is that germ that has
[51:05] been quickened this earth and frail
[51:09] weakened vessel it displays its weakness
[51:12] in the midst of these times but here how
[51:16] that within the midst of it we realized
[51:19] that with patience as we've been talking
[51:21] on this with patience and the loyalty of
[51:23] our heart that patience itself is not
[51:26] something that is just handed to us this
[51:29] is a great virtue of patience even faith
[51:32] was not handed to us but faith itself is
[51:35] that which is born within our hearts
[51:37] there's got to be something that will
[51:38] stir our faith first of all to believe
[51:41] in God and then God comes down and it
[51:44] moves from just a faith that we have up
[51:46] here to a faith to a living faith that
[51:48] Paul could say the life that I'm not
[51:51] living
[51:52] I live by the faith of the Son of God
[51:54] who loved me and gave himself for me
[51:58] and so that faith is that is an anchor
[52:01] it's a residence within our life that
[52:03] holds steady in the midst of everything
[52:05] and this is where as the Prophet would
[52:08] tell us that patience itself is the very
[52:10] outcome of faithfulness and he he refers
[52:14] to the book of James where the trying of
[52:16] your faith work as patience and it says
[52:18] let patience have her perfect work that
[52:21] you might be entire perfect and wanting
[52:25] nothing and the Prophet said God hey so
[52:27] highly regards this outworking of our
[52:30] patience and he says it like this he
[52:33] said God's will is for for us is
[52:36] perfection
[52:37] now remember that perfection is not our
[52:39] flesh that perfection is not our spirit
[52:42] but that perfection is our waiting on
[52:46] God and waiting for God this is the
[52:52] process of character development that's
[52:58] a powerful statement this is no
[53:01] character development is not an insta
[53:03] pot meal you can't put it in and all of
[53:07] a sudden it it instantly you know it's
[53:09] like it it comes up overnight the
[53:12] character itself to think about this if
[53:15] I can I can just say it like this
[53:17] character itself holds no retirement
[53:20] plan in this life character itself holds
[53:24] no eventual drawing from Social Security
[53:28] in this life character were here in this
[53:31] life and it's in this life that our
[53:34] character is molded and shaped and when
[53:37] God Himself our purpose has been served
[53:39] that character has been fully developed
[53:42] then he himself who has brought it forth
[53:45] fully delivers that character that gold
[53:49] and brings it home because this life is
[53:53] just for that development so we're never
[53:56] going to come to a place to where we can
[53:58] kick our feet up and say we're done with
[54:00] tests and trials you're Fleshman like
[54:03] that and my flesh would like that
[54:05] we would but the reality of it is when
[54:09] we realize our journey here is just for
[54:12] this purpose to develop christ-like
[54:15] character after we have been born by his
[54:17] Spirit then it's God it moves and
[54:20] directs us through the very process of
[54:22] character development and through this
[54:25] time of character development there's
[54:27] times when God is silent you know I
[54:37] think the worst thing it is you just sit
[54:38] around the room nobody's talking some of
[54:42] you probably in your house has never had
[54:44] that I hadn't called nobody's name but
[54:47] I'm just tell you right now when you
[54:48] hear silence silence sometimes you know
[54:51] you think they can somebody talk you
[54:54] know somebody talk silence itself is one
[54:57] of silence is a time you know if
[54:59] nobody's talking you just come into a
[55:01] room or you just sit there there's a lot
[55:02] of things that can try to go through
[55:04] your mind there's a lot of things that
[55:08] can come during the time of silence it's
[55:12] a time of being tested on what God has
[55:17] given now watch how the Prophet takes us
[55:19] through this in the filler and
[55:20] Philadelphian church age here and we'll
[55:23] just kind of base on this for a few
[55:24] moments tonight he takes us into the
[55:27] scripture at revelations chapter 3 verse
[55:29] 10 because thou has kept the word of my
[55:32] patience I also will keep thee from the
[55:35] hour of temptation which shall come upon
[55:37] all the world to try them that dwell
[55:40] upon the earth he said what does he mean
[55:44] by the word of his patience and if it
[55:47] takes us to Hebrews 6:4 when God made
[55:49] promise to Abraham because he could
[55:51] swear by no greater he swore by himself
[55:53] saying surely I will bless thee and
[55:55] multiplying I will multiply thee and so
[55:58] after he had patiently endured he
[56:02] obtained the promise the RAM says you
[56:05] see the Spirit is speaking about the
[56:08] Word of God which is given to us to wait
[56:11] for the fulfillment of that word
[56:13] required patience even as it did in the
[56:17] case of Abraham he
[56:18] as seeing him who is invisible he was
[56:22] patient and then the word finally was
[56:25] fulfilled this is the way God teaches
[56:29] his people patience so God gives a word
[56:33] of promise but that word of promise is a
[56:36] word of patience
[56:38] God gives that word to a generation God
[56:42] gives that promise and then God allows
[56:45] what looks like my it's coming right
[56:47] away it's going to be fulfilled yet we
[56:49] recognize it is at hand but at hand
[56:52] means that the Living God who isn't
[56:55] present to fulfill that promise there is
[56:57] a maturing of that promise but the
[57:00] maturing of that promise cannot override
[57:03] or go beyond the people who are a danger
[57:07] of that promise but the God who made
[57:09] that promise is the light of that
[57:11] promise and the light of that promise
[57:13] must mature the people because the
[57:16] people are the literal reflection and
[57:19] manifestation of that promise which is
[57:22] of the Living God the light of God
[57:24] lighting up that promise in the hearts
[57:27] of the people so the promise itself this
[57:30] is why the promise itself there is a
[57:33] continual maturing within that promise
[57:36] and as the Bible says even concerning in
[57:39] that time that he will keep thee in the
[57:41] hour of temptation when their pressures
[57:45] and things that even in that time that
[57:47] we're going on and brother Graham said
[57:49] even there will be a time that will come
[57:50] upon the earth he said when people are
[57:52] actually pressured under the very place
[57:55] of you know worshiping and giving
[57:58] themselves over to those beast systems
[58:00] and he says they'll look at it and say
[58:02] well at least I can serve God in these
[58:05] systems he said and they'll be pressured
[58:07] under the hour of temptation but the
[58:11] promise is for us in this hour that
[58:13] those as you are looking to that word of
[58:16] patience you've kept it I will remember
[58:19] the and I will hold thee in the hour of
[58:22] temptation and they're wonderful this is
[58:29] the way God teaches his people patience
[58:32] what's this wife he fulfilled his word
[58:35] in physical manifestations the very
[58:38] instant
[58:39] you prayed you would never learn
[58:42] patience Wow
[58:46] but would become even more impatient
[58:51] with life
[58:52] now what's this would become even more
[58:56] impatient with life it's not just even
[59:01] in your spiritual walk it's with life
[59:04] you'd become impatient with your family
[59:07] impatient with wives husbands and
[59:09] impatient with one another impatient
[59:11] when you go to the grocery store why in
[59:13] the world biases taken so long they have
[59:16] 30 cash registers and to open and
[59:19] they've got ten self serves if you only
[59:24] want to cash registers open just build
[59:26] to something you know what I'm talking
[59:29] about when you look at it if God did it
[59:36] this way I'm going to tell you right now
[59:38] there's every one of us in here like
[59:40] instant prayers we like instant things
[59:43] happening in our lives every one of us
[59:45] but you know what instant things don't
[59:48] always don't always produce character
[59:51] instant things you know God can do
[59:53] something instantly within a service for
[59:56] a heart and alive and here they are is
[59:58] they're walking on with God things will
[1:00:00] take place right on and then as they
[1:00:02] begin to mature in the Lord they feel
[1:00:03] like my you know what's happened to me
[1:00:05] when I first started serving God it
[1:00:08] seemed like I prayed and bow the answer
[1:00:10] came and I prayed about this pal the
[1:00:13] answer came and my this happened and the
[1:00:15] answer came you know what's happened
[1:00:17] Lord if I have I've fallen away from you
[1:00:19] have I gotten cold no it's just God has
[1:00:22] been maturing you to a place to realize
[1:00:25] all of those things that took place were
[1:00:29] necessary in that time and he will show
[1:00:32] up like that when it's necessary for us
[1:00:35] again but you see you cannot equate that
[1:00:39] as though what God must not be with me
[1:00:41] God must not be with me hold brother
[1:00:43] Samuel but what Gideon
[1:00:45] but apply that in the right context when
[1:00:47] Gideon said if God be with us where be
[1:00:49] all the miracles God you get in was
[1:00:51] standing there in that time after there
[1:00:53] had been such a space where God himself
[1:00:56] his presence had not been made manifest
[1:00:58] among them and God needed to manifest
[1:01:01] his presence so he had somebody that
[1:01:04] could ask him to manifest his presence
[1:01:07] somebody who could look in the word and
[1:01:10] say if God is the same God who opened
[1:01:12] the Red Sea where is that God at right
[1:01:15] now
[1:01:15] there has to be that two started friends
[1:01:19] if there wasn't God moving like that in
[1:01:22] your life in the beginning you need to
[1:01:23] check up come on somebody God moves in
[1:01:31] that manner to stir that faith I'll tell
[1:01:37] you what if you can receive it tonight
[1:01:38] it'll help you this right here will
[1:01:40] really help you you know it'll allow you
[1:01:42] to back the devil up and give him a
[1:01:44] black eye to where you're not beating
[1:01:47] letting yourself be browbeat on things
[1:01:50] we would become even more impatient with
[1:01:54] life let me show you the truth even more
[1:01:57] fully set forth Hebrews 11:17 he said by
[1:02:01] faith Abraham when he was tried offered
[1:02:04] up Isaac and he that had received the
[1:02:07] promises the Word of God offered up his
[1:02:10] only begotten Son there it is Abraham
[1:02:13] was tried after he received the word of
[1:02:17] promise
[1:02:18] most think that as soon as we pray in
[1:02:21] Jesus name over the good promises of God
[1:02:24] that there could not be a trial but here
[1:02:29] it says that Abraham was tried after he
[1:02:33] received the promise they'll repeat of
[1:02:37] God he received that promise and how the
[1:02:41] Prophet brings around here when we pray
[1:02:43] over that promise if there's a promise
[1:02:45] that God has given to you you say you
[1:02:47] don't know my situation you don't know
[1:02:50] what I'm going through but I am certain
[1:02:52] that God has already provided a word for
[1:02:55] it
[1:02:56] I am certain that he's still God even
[1:02:58] over your situation where maybe you
[1:03:01] can't find a scripture for it but I'm
[1:03:03] telling you he's still the same God who
[1:03:05] meets needs he's still the same God you
[1:03:08] saved my brother Samuel I can't turn
[1:03:10] this situation God never asked you to
[1:03:12] try to change somebody else God asks you
[1:03:15] to stand on his word and hold that word
[1:03:17] and say god you're God of your word and
[1:03:20] Lord God I submit myself to you and I'm
[1:03:22] looking for you to come on the scene I
[1:03:27] tell you friends sometimes the reason
[1:03:30] God can't even come on the scene it
[1:03:31] because our attitude on things we get so
[1:03:36] impatient we get huffy brother Brent
[1:03:41] says we pray and we ask him and he don't
[1:03:42] answer and he said we get disgusted with
[1:03:44] him who him powerful statements
[1:03:48] conference with God what happens with
[1:03:51] that we well you know I you said what
[1:03:53] brother said no how can that be I don't
[1:03:55] get disgusted with God let me ask you
[1:03:57] are you still praying his fervent are
[1:04:01] you still reading are you still holding
[1:04:02] on this further or if you left or if you
[1:04:04] let back on some of that right there you
[1:04:06] see that's only the enemy to try to come
[1:04:09] at you and try to discourage you from
[1:04:10] the promise but remember you're not
[1:04:12] going to receive strength and
[1:04:14] encouragement for the promise coming to
[1:04:16] pass by removing yourself from the very
[1:04:18] promise giver and the life source of him
[1:04:21] you've got to keep moving on and
[1:04:23] standing there and say God made this
[1:04:25] promise I'm a believer and I'm looking
[1:04:28] to God to fulfill this I know the
[1:04:37] simplicity where the Prophet spoke of it
[1:04:39] regarding Abraham and I think sometimes
[1:04:41] that we let those little things bypass
[1:04:43] us where it talks about where the
[1:04:46] brother branham will dramatize how that
[1:04:48] Abraham made ready he said go ahead and
[1:04:51] buy up the diapers go ahead and get the
[1:04:52] bird out pens go ahead and get these
[1:04:54] things what was Abraham doing he was
[1:04:57] making ready for the promise oh god help
[1:05:05] us but here it says they Abraham was
[1:05:07] tried after he received the promise
[1:05:09] that is exactly correct according to the
[1:05:11] psalmist referring to Joseph in 105
[1:05:14] verse 19 until the time that his word
[1:05:17] came the word of the Lord
[1:05:20] tried him who Oh glory be to God God
[1:05:26] gives us exceeding great and precious
[1:05:29] promises he has promised to fulfill that
[1:05:33] can you agree with that he's given us
[1:05:35] great and exceeding promises this I mean
[1:05:37] you don't know my situation but I'm not
[1:05:39] talking about your situation I'm talking
[1:05:41] about the remedy for your situation I'm
[1:05:44] not talking about your trial I'm talking
[1:05:46] about the God who is over all of that
[1:05:48] he's given us exceeding and great
[1:05:52] precious promises and not does he just
[1:05:55] give us promises he fulfills them he's
[1:05:58] not like you or I where we promised
[1:06:00] somebody to call somebody I'll call you
[1:06:02] we'll get together we'll do this and
[1:06:04] then time and everything else gets in
[1:06:05] between God is not like that God when he
[1:06:08] made a promise God will come to his
[1:06:10] problem matter of fact the Prophet said
[1:06:12] electus and the patriarch Abraham he
[1:06:14] said God will bankrupt the heavens to
[1:06:17] keep one promise to one of his children
[1:06:21] hallelujah that's God's faithfulness to
[1:06:24] his word oh my but from the time look at
[1:06:29] this but from the time we pray until the
[1:06:34] time we get the answer we must learn no
[1:06:41] know what to receive patients into our
[1:06:46] souls remember jesus said that receive
[1:06:48] you patients into your souls possess
[1:06:49] your souls with patience possess your
[1:06:52] souls with patients to receive patients
[1:06:55] into our souls for only in patience do
[1:06:58] we possess life he says may God help us
[1:07:02] to learn this lesson even as we know the
[1:07:04] people of this sixth age learned
[1:07:06] patience we read the history of lives of
[1:07:09] these great Christians what a contrast
[1:07:11] we see between their lives and ours for
[1:07:14] they were so patient and quiet and today
[1:07:18] we are all but overcome in over impes
[1:07:23] and haste we don't get any help from the
[1:07:33] world around us see the atmosphere
[1:07:38] everything around it totally speaks
[1:07:40] against this remember the the actual
[1:07:43] spirit of this age is a spirit that has
[1:07:46] to that that is battled you didn't
[1:07:49] battle it before you were moved by it
[1:07:51] now you battle against it soft easy
[1:07:55] living and yet what does the what does
[1:07:58] that soft easy living everything else we
[1:08:01] find that this age is the age of a
[1:08:03] heightened neurotic age everything's
[1:08:07] promised easier and you know those of
[1:08:09] you know working the more technology
[1:08:11] they come out with the more people you
[1:08:13] lose to work with you and the more they
[1:08:15] demand of you you're not becoming easier
[1:08:19] they demand more out of you all of the
[1:08:23] pressures everything that comes along
[1:08:25] with it every time there's an
[1:08:26] advancement of the tree of knowledge the
[1:08:28] pressure continues to mount or glory
[1:08:34] that's why we need our release in the
[1:08:38] Tree of Life
[1:08:40] he is our release of the pressure now we
[1:08:45] could just spend on that at some time
[1:08:47] but over impatience and haste my mind
[1:08:54] you know job job was tried and when
[1:09:01] LeBron tells us how that the people came
[1:09:04] to job those those brethren really Bram
[1:09:07] tells us he said if job himself if it
[1:09:09] had been just intellectual faith he said
[1:09:12] joke could arrest it and resorted to his
[1:09:15] reasoning but they could not move job
[1:09:18] off of his sacrifice and he said the
[1:09:25] reason is that he said they could they
[1:09:27] could talk about all these things and
[1:09:29] they could put all these things out he
[1:09:30] said but the difference was with job job
[1:09:33] had fellowship
[1:09:36] job had fellowship with God this was not
[1:09:39] something that had been handed to job
[1:09:42] junk knew it by personal revelation but
[1:09:45] this is my absolute this was Christ this
[1:09:50] is this is God's provided way it was a
[1:09:52] burnt offering but he had this is what
[1:09:54] it was it's not you can look at and say
[1:09:56] well that was a word of a burnt offering
[1:09:58] but let me tell you something job and
[1:10:01] any man any ordained believer with faith
[1:10:04] in the word that's given to them and
[1:10:06] their have faith in that word to make
[1:10:08] that word live it'll back the devil up
[1:10:11] every time I don't care how small the
[1:10:14] promise might see if it's faith in that
[1:10:16] promise for God to move it'll back the
[1:10:19] devil up every single time because it's
[1:10:22] faith in the Living God who made that
[1:10:24] promise Alleluia what about us we're not
[1:10:30] we're not living under a pipe or a
[1:10:33] shadow we're living in what was spoken
[1:10:35] about and that has come to pass through
[1:10:38] Calvary and now living in the finishing
[1:10:40] of all times over my it ought to be then
[1:10:43] within our lives to say Lord what you
[1:10:45] had promised Lord I know that you are
[1:10:48] fulfilling in Lord even now in my life
[1:10:56] the Bible tells us don't cast away your
[1:10:58] confidence it had great recompense of
[1:11:03] the reward it says you have need of
[1:11:07] patience then after you have done the
[1:11:11] will of God that you might receive the
[1:11:13] promise for a little while and he that
[1:11:15] shall come will tarry will come and will
[1:11:18] not tarry God allows tearing don't allow
[1:11:23] silence
[1:11:24] it proves faith it proves faith there
[1:11:31] are scriptures that we've been reading
[1:11:33] from here for some services at different
[1:11:36] intervals but out of Romans chapter 5
[1:11:40] the Romans chapter 5 it speaks of how
[1:11:44] that in verse 3 we glory in tribulations
[1:11:49] also knowing that tribulation worketh
[1:11:52] patience and patience experience and
[1:11:56] experience hope and hope maketh not
[1:12:01] ashamed because the love of God is shed
[1:12:04] abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost
[1:12:07] which is given unto us now we look at
[1:12:14] this and how that you know when we're
[1:12:16] looking at the tribulations that they
[1:12:18] come upon the trials the test its
[1:12:21] tribulations that worketh patience and
[1:12:24] patience experience and experience oh
[1:12:26] and to know that all of this there's one
[1:12:29] great hope that you and I have and that
[1:12:33] hope is in the coming of the Lord but
[1:12:36] look at this right now if look at this
[1:12:38] we've got a hope and expectation and the
[1:12:40] coming of the Lord that we are a part of
[1:12:43] his coming by the baptism of the Holy
[1:12:45] Ghost because he's coming back for his
[1:12:47] own we have a promise within that and
[1:12:50] that promise notice it's faith but now
[1:12:53] through those those tribulations
[1:12:56] tribulation has brought about patience
[1:12:58] and patience itself has brought about
[1:13:00] experience and experience hope it's just
[1:13:03] like within this room here tonight there
[1:13:05] is no doubt many that when a maybe a
[1:13:07] life starts out in their first person or
[1:13:10] first journeys in their walk your
[1:13:11] patience might be like this but then
[1:13:14] after time that patience grows and
[1:13:15] remember we want to let patience have
[1:13:17] her perfect work it's God developing God
[1:13:21] the Bible says he's not gonna put more
[1:13:23] on you than what you're able to bear
[1:13:25] he's not interested and drowned in you
[1:13:27] sinking you he's interested in bringing
[1:13:30] out what he knows lays within you
[1:13:32] hallelujah
[1:13:34] he knows what lays within your life so
[1:13:37] he's bringing it all about be
[1:13:38] experiences in your life those
[1:13:40] experiences are testimonies those
[1:13:42] testimonies in your life experiences you
[1:13:45] go through are not just about you they
[1:13:47] are witnesses and testimonies and works
[1:13:50] of God that can be expressed and for the
[1:13:52] edification of the body and
[1:13:55] them experiences it brings about hope
[1:13:58] within our life what expectation that
[1:14:01] here when something itself even would
[1:14:04] come along and might seem greater than
[1:14:06] what the last one was but yet there is a
[1:14:08] hope within it that says I know that God
[1:14:11] is my helper I know he never left me
[1:14:15] he never forsake me he's bringing me
[1:14:17] through this he's gonna see me through
[1:14:19] this I don't know how what everything
[1:14:22] I'm gonna have to go through every briar
[1:14:24] patch and everything else but I know
[1:14:26] that God is with me and I know God will
[1:14:29] see me through what is that expectation
[1:14:33] that's the same kind of expectation for
[1:14:36] the body change we've got to have that
[1:14:38] same kind of an expectation daily in our
[1:14:41] life it's an expectation of the Living
[1:14:43] God you can't look at yourself you can't
[1:14:46] look at your neighbor you've gotta look
[1:14:48] unto Him who is the author and finisher
[1:14:51] of your faith David said it like this
[1:14:55] David said in Psalms 119 verse 16 uphold
[1:15:00] me according unto that word that I may
[1:15:02] live and let me not be ashamed of my
[1:15:05] hope
[1:15:06] hold down me up and I shall be safe and
[1:15:09] I will have respect under the statutes
[1:15:12] continually in Psalms 25 verse 1 David
[1:15:16] said unto the Lord do I lift up my soul
[1:15:20] o my god I trust in thee let me not be
[1:15:24] ashamed let not my enemies triumph over
[1:15:27] me
[1:15:28] yay let them that wait on thee be
[1:15:30] ashamed let them be ashamed what's
[1:15:33] transgress without cause you know what
[1:15:35] David is doing he's following the word
[1:15:37] the Bible says in James 5:14 if any of
[1:15:40] you be afflicted let him pray let him
[1:15:46] pray Lord let me not be ashamed Lord I
[1:15:49] lift up my soul to you Lord let not my
[1:15:53] enemies triumph over me Lord glory be to
[1:15:57] God even to where FF Bosworth said at
[1:16:02] the very end how he so believed in
[1:16:04] divine healing and he prayed God would
[1:16:08] not let him go be in
[1:16:09] SiC and God took him home anyone sick
[1:16:18] you see the promises let me not be
[1:16:21] ashamed hope maketh not ashamed because
[1:16:24] the love of God is shed abroad in ours
[1:16:27] now we might have certain expectations
[1:16:31] but there's a deeper expectation that
[1:16:34] holds us certain things don't turn out
[1:16:37] maybe the way that we want it to turn
[1:16:39] out we prayed for here and and and the
[1:16:43] healing does not come maybe in the
[1:16:45] timeframe that we're looking for or even
[1:16:48] in the way come on somebody what about
[1:16:53] the woman who was prayed for there in
[1:16:56] the meeting where the presence of God is
[1:16:58] moving in the services and she went on
[1:17:01] home to her God had already spoken and
[1:17:05] here she is making up the beds the next
[1:17:08] day here she is up there on the hill you
[1:17:10] know you've heard the story here she is
[1:17:12] up there testifying and what happens in
[1:17:15] the midst of that time not only her but
[1:17:17] her neighbor then what it is has been
[1:17:20] healed her condition and her neighbor
[1:17:22] with that that growth that she on all
[1:17:24] her had fallen off what happened God
[1:17:26] came on the scene the angel the Lord was
[1:17:29] passing through the neighborhood to make
[1:17:31] good on the promise that he had made
[1:17:33] with her the night before and they no
[1:17:36] doubt about it she probably walked out
[1:17:38] of that meeting she didn't feel no
[1:17:39] different but she has holding on to
[1:17:43] God's Word and had a hope her brother
[1:17:52] Samuel I don't want hope I want faith if
[1:17:54] you've got faith you'll have hope you
[1:18:01] can't have faith and not have
[1:18:02] expectation Psalms 27 verse 14 wait on
[1:18:10] the Lord be of good courage and he shall
[1:18:13] strengthen thine heart wait I say on the
[1:18:18] Lord
[1:18:22] hmm Psalms 37 verse 34 wait on the Lord
[1:18:27] and keep his way and he shall exalt thee
[1:18:30] to inherit the land when the wicked are
[1:18:32] cut off thou shalt see it no notice
[1:18:34] verse 39 the salvation of the righteous
[1:18:37] is of the Lord he is their strength in
[1:18:39] the time of trouble and the Lord shall
[1:18:42] help them and deliver them he shall
[1:18:44] deliver them from the wicked and save
[1:18:47] them because because because they trust
[1:18:51] in him not because you're worthy
[1:18:55] not because I'm worthy but he shall
[1:18:59] deliver from the wicked he shall say
[1:19:02] because they we trust in him had nothing
[1:19:10] to do about your worthiness had nothing
[1:19:13] to do about my worthiness Romans 8:24
[1:19:17] for we are saved by hope but hope that
[1:19:21] is seen is not hope if you can see it
[1:19:26] you're no longer hoping for it
[1:19:28] for what a man seeth why doth he yet
[1:19:30] hope for it but if we hope for that we
[1:19:34] see not then we do with patience wait
[1:19:37] for it
[1:19:40] no doubt you might have come into this
[1:19:43] building tonight or any other other
[1:19:44] times and maybe tonight here you come in
[1:19:47] this building you might have felt lower
[1:19:49] and more down than than the padding
[1:19:51] under this carpet right here tonight you
[1:19:53] might have felt down and discouraged
[1:19:55] maybe within yourself but here is
[1:19:57] something that raised us up within you
[1:19:59] said if I can only get there to the
[1:20:01] house of God I believe that God's gonna
[1:20:03] speak to my heart God's going to
[1:20:05] minister what is that that's hope and
[1:20:07] you are saved by hope and how God comes
[1:20:09] down right by his word and ministers
[1:20:12] right to your life it's God coming down
[1:20:14] why because you trust in him you're not
[1:20:16] trusting in a man you're not trusting in
[1:20:19] his ability but you're trusting in the
[1:20:21] Living God to confirm his word and
[1:20:24] fulfill it that's real hope
[1:20:27] sometimes you're praying about things
[1:20:29] brother Graham says you know you pray
[1:20:32] for it and you know he says
[1:20:35] sometimes he says he don't answer he
[1:20:39] might answer in the first five and four
[1:20:41] if he don't answer in the first five
[1:20:42] hours he says wait another if he doesn't
[1:20:45] answer today he'll answer tomorrow the
[1:20:50] devil said he didn't answer today he'll
[1:20:52] answer tomorrow he'd be done answering
[1:20:55] this week he will next week you see what
[1:20:58] that is that's expectation he will
[1:21:01] answer you're not going to take that
[1:21:05] promise away from me if it hadn't
[1:21:08] happened this hour he's going to answer
[1:21:09] me next hour if they don't answer me the
[1:21:12] next hour I'll stand there and say he'll
[1:21:14] answer me tomorrow if it ain't this week
[1:21:16] it's gonna be next week if it ain't this
[1:21:18] month that's gonna be next month if he
[1:21:20] don't come today he'll be coming
[1:21:22] tomorrow if he don't come tomorrow he'll
[1:21:24] be coming the next day but he is coming
[1:21:27] and I'm going with him he is gonna
[1:21:29] fulfill that promise
[1:21:31] and I'm part of that promise he made
[1:21:33] that promise with me in mind he still
[1:21:39] answers Psalms wonder Philippines 1:20
[1:21:48] according to my earnest expectation and
[1:21:50] my hope that in nothing I shall be
[1:21:54] ashamed but that with all boldness as
[1:21:57] always so now also Christ shall be
[1:21:59] magnified in my body whether it be by
[1:22:02] life or by death for to me for me to
[1:22:06] live is Christ and to die is gain now
[1:22:11] what we've just done here for a few
[1:22:14] moments is taken has the Scriptures
[1:22:18] themselves it says in Romans 15 for
[1:22:20] whatsoever things were written aforetime
[1:22:22] were written for our learning that we
[1:22:25] through patience and comfort of the
[1:22:29] Scriptures might have hope you and I
[1:22:35] have promises and examples that God has
[1:22:39] so inspired within the hearts and lives
[1:22:41] of believers who went before us to
[1:22:43] inspire us and comfort us in the midst
[1:22:46] of our time
[1:22:48] brother bream tells about this woman I'm
[1:22:50] coming to a close here he tells about
[1:22:52] the woman here the widow of Zarephath
[1:22:54] you know brother Brenner has a way of
[1:22:58] dramatizing it he said though no doubt
[1:23:00] he said here she was biting her lip
[1:23:02] still they would bleed he said she had
[1:23:04] been praying and looking to God for God
[1:23:07] to move in brother Bram said it like
[1:23:08] this he says you know God has a way of
[1:23:11] answering prayer he has a way of
[1:23:14] answering prayer he don't always it
[1:23:16] isn't always in the same timeline the
[1:23:18] same timeframe and the same way but he
[1:23:21] has a way of answering prayer and notice
[1:23:24] how that she's been praying now the
[1:23:26] scriptures when we look at it in the
[1:23:28] script the scriptures don't give a whole
[1:23:29] a whole lot of background about this
[1:23:31] woman they just all of a sudden break in
[1:23:33] when it's time for Elijah to go to her
[1:23:36] but yet in all of this of what she's
[1:23:38] been doing she's a believer brother
[1:23:40] brems says that she is even after the
[1:23:42] Lord had taken her husband home she had
[1:23:44] wanted to just stay true there to the
[1:23:46] vow and he said that you know not not
[1:23:48] that she had to as far as than that but
[1:23:49] the brother man says she just wanted to
[1:23:51] you know stay single and meet her
[1:23:52] husband and glory and brother Graham
[1:23:54] said that for weeks he said that Beryl
[1:23:56] kept going down kept going down kept
[1:23:58] going down I want you to catch this for
[1:24:00] a moment she's praying and what she's
[1:24:03] praying and asking God for the opposite
[1:24:07] is happening instead have what she's
[1:24:09] praying for I'm praying for my children
[1:24:14] but it seems like they're getting
[1:24:15] farther away things I'm praying about it
[1:24:18] on the mill bearing didn't it's going
[1:24:20] down down down come on somebody she was
[1:24:26] constantly praying and the Prophet said
[1:24:28] it like this he said it looked like
[1:24:30] there was no hope in sight nowhere in
[1:24:36] sight you get that there was no hope in
[1:24:39] sight nowhere in sight but here she's a
[1:24:44] believer what she sees she knows it's
[1:24:49] going down now notice how that you know
[1:24:52] brother Ram says this is where he said
[1:24:54] it comes to us that where when you know
[1:24:57] that you've met God's requirements he
[1:24:59] said she had met God's
[1:25:01] requirements she was living separated
[1:25:03] from the systems of that day she was
[1:25:05] living a pure and clean life she knew
[1:25:08] she and met God's requirements and he
[1:25:10] said this is it seems like you know when
[1:25:12] you've met all of God's requirements and
[1:25:14] yet he's still silent he doesn't say
[1:25:16] anything she's praying and God didn't
[1:25:20] say just hold on I've got a man coming
[1:25:22] down here and this is gonna take place
[1:25:24] it were no longer be hope because why I
[1:25:28] hope with what you already know she
[1:25:33] didn't know how the outcome was going to
[1:25:37] come he said but notice if you know
[1:25:40] you've met his requirements and you've
[1:25:42] done all you know to do then faith
[1:25:45] doesn't waver it just sits still and
[1:25:49] thinks positive whew sit still and
[1:25:56] doesn't think positive how'd it hear she
[1:26:00] was in the midst of it looked like he
[1:26:02] was silent but he said God sometimes
[1:26:05] does that to see what kind of a reaction
[1:26:07] that you're gonna have he talks about
[1:26:09] how that people will walk across the
[1:26:11] platform and you know you're prayed for
[1:26:13] and hands are laid on you and you go on
[1:26:16] off the platform and you're still
[1:26:17] dealing with the same symptoms over and
[1:26:20] over what did the Prophet tell us don't
[1:26:21] look at your symptoms I'm gonna tell you
[1:26:26] friends let me tell you how the devil
[1:26:27] does it you can be prayed for for
[1:26:29] something you can even sit down and talk
[1:26:30] with me about something but you've got
[1:26:32] to have faith that God Himself answers
[1:26:35] and you've got to stand upon that
[1:26:36] promise but the moment that you back
[1:26:38] away from that promise
[1:26:39] and allows the enemy to move right back
[1:26:41] in and take that ground and he can stand
[1:26:44] there you know what he's trying to do
[1:26:45] he's trying to build in you a complex
[1:26:47] against the promise that God has
[1:26:49] ordained for you to where you will
[1:26:51] actually start drawing back when a
[1:26:53] minister anointed by the Spirit of God
[1:26:55] to preach that word there'll be
[1:26:57] something within you the wrath of a
[1:26:59] complex are drawn back you don't even
[1:27:01] know why in the world you're getting all
[1:27:02] nervous and everything about it who is
[1:27:04] it it's Satan building a complex but
[1:27:07] you're gonna realize that promise is met
[1:27:09] and fulfilled in the promise of faith
[1:27:11] not
[1:27:12] what I feel not about what I said it's
[1:27:15] not about any of my symptoms it's what
[1:27:17] God has already said hallelujah when
[1:27:24] he's silent Who am I this is where the
[1:27:28] Bible says they that wait upon the Lord
[1:27:30] shall renew their strength
[1:27:32] and they shall mount up with wings as an
[1:27:35] eagle they shall run and not be weary
[1:27:37] they shall walk and not faint
[1:27:42] brother bran puts it down there in the
[1:27:44] midst of this when you're looking at it
[1:27:46] you think about even the Hebrew children
[1:27:49] when they come down let's just take a
[1:27:50] little detour here you come down to the
[1:27:52] Hebrew children they themselves did not
[1:27:56] have an answer from God about the fiery
[1:27:58] furnace they didn't have one answer but
[1:28:01] what they did say is we're not going to
[1:28:04] bow to you they had met every
[1:28:07] requirement sins was confessed and they
[1:28:10] were standing there and you know what
[1:28:12] God in the midst of it was silence but
[1:28:14] God when he gets ready to move he moves
[1:28:18] the whole time he was right there they
[1:28:22] didn't see him but he was there with
[1:28:24] them he was there with them when they
[1:28:26] were even brought before the king come
[1:28:28] on somebody in there what the Lord Jesus
[1:28:30] told the disciples he told him he said
[1:28:32] and to us would fear not when you're
[1:28:34] brought before kings and magistrates and
[1:28:37] different things don't you take take a
[1:28:39] thought of what you're gonna say it'll
[1:28:41] be given to you at that moment why
[1:28:42] because he is present I'll never leave
[1:28:45] you nor forsake you the Lord is my
[1:28:48] helper I will not fear what men can do
[1:28:51] unto me the whole time
[1:28:56] brother brems said no doubt Satan was
[1:28:58] telling them this is your end well both
[1:29:01] Samuel what would it matter well he
[1:29:05] wasn't going to turn him away he wasn't
[1:29:07] going to turn him away from what from
[1:29:09] what the anchor was with him but the
[1:29:11] midst of it is Satan doesn't know your
[1:29:14] destiny oh I wish we could get that
[1:29:16] tonight
[1:29:18] that gavel does not know your destiny
[1:29:20] the devil does not hold your future he's
[1:29:24] never held your future let me tell you
[1:29:27] something God is not the one whispering
[1:29:29] on your soldier shoulder about something
[1:29:31] of where you're gonna be like the rest
[1:29:33] them and you're gonna fall away and
[1:29:35] you're gonna do this and that ain't from
[1:29:36] God that's from the devil and you know
[1:29:40] what the devil anointing your flesh just
[1:29:43] sit there and try to get in on you but
[1:29:45] remember brother sister that's not God
[1:29:48] that is the devil that devil does not
[1:29:51] hold your future discern that spirit and
[1:29:56] will stand it and cast it away with
[1:29:58] perfect love in a perfect God who said
[1:30:02] his word he don't know me don't own that
[1:30:07] destiny he don't know the outcome of
[1:30:09] this trial get on your shoulder and say
[1:30:13] I'll tell you what they're gonna do
[1:30:14] they're gonna fire you that ain't of God
[1:30:16] boy I tell you we're just gonna go with
[1:30:18] it
[1:30:19] gets on your shoulder and says you know
[1:30:21] what this is gonna take you out this
[1:30:23] sickness gonna take you out that ain't
[1:30:24] of God hallelujah let me tell you
[1:30:30] something when God leads you it'll
[1:30:32] produce the same results as it did in
[1:30:33] Polycarp you with me he's the same God
[1:30:38] providing supreme grace for the supreme
[1:30:40] hour you say brother send the handle I
[1:30:42] know it can you say it again I sure will
[1:30:44] when Satan comes it produces fear but
[1:30:48] when God speaks it produces faith and
[1:30:50] that's one way you're able to discern
[1:30:53] between the enemy and God Alleluia
[1:31:01] glory hallelujah
[1:31:04] [Music]
[1:31:05] Omaha he seemed to be silent but the joy
[1:31:10] was no text coming in none brother ray
[1:31:14] that thread was dead there was no there
[1:31:18] was no likes on the Facebook post of
[1:31:22] we're gonna stand we're gonna stand for
[1:31:24] you nothing
[1:31:28] he was sad but God was allowing their
[1:31:33] faith to be demonstrated to be shown in
[1:31:40] the midst of this time this is the
[1:31:45] promise having done all to stand stand
[1:31:48] therefore he said let's jump back to
[1:31:52] this Widow and let's finish it the RAM
[1:31:57] talks about this Widow and he said
[1:31:58] here's what she had said that
[1:32:01] nevertheless whatever you do Lord I love
[1:32:06] you just the same and I trust you you
[1:32:12] say brother Samuel that ain't written in
[1:32:13] the Bible I believe it you know why
[1:32:16] we're talking about the qualities of a
[1:32:17] believer we're talking about the desire
[1:32:20] within every one of our hearts in our
[1:32:21] lives let me tell you something reading
[1:32:25] about this widow of Zarephath we read
[1:32:27] one little passage it's not even in a
[1:32:29] whole entire chapter it's a part of a
[1:32:32] passage but brother Joey her life had
[1:32:34] been chapters is that her brother Dave
[1:32:37] her life had been chapters but we don't
[1:32:40] read about the other chapters but the
[1:32:42] other chapters no doubt there was
[1:32:43] molding shaping making even for this
[1:32:46] moment so don't get this chapter here
[1:32:50] and say this is who she was
[1:32:52] all the time as far as they believer yes
[1:32:55] but she had to be matured there was no
[1:32:59] doubt she went through other times in
[1:33:01] her life that no doubt she would not
[1:33:04] have wanted on display but God chose to
[1:33:07] select an archive what you and I needed
[1:33:11] to minister comfort to us notice it said
[1:33:17] this is enough for me how the brother
[1:33:18] BAM he enters into this he says it seems
[1:33:21] strange when a person has done all that
[1:33:23] they can do and that they have fulfilled
[1:33:26] every request that God has asked them to
[1:33:29] do and still he is silent when you have
[1:33:32] done all that God has requested to do
[1:33:34] and still he is silent just be sure that
[1:33:37] you know God and remember faith is
[1:33:41] silently waiting he's only testing your
[1:33:44] faith to see what you'll do God does
[1:33:47] that he says this little woman I like
[1:33:52] this this little woman know that she had
[1:33:56] met all these requirements and spiel God
[1:33:59] was silent it seemed like he didn't even
[1:34:02] care for her are you with me seemed like
[1:34:06] he didn't even care for her he didn't
[1:34:09] care whether she lived or died let me
[1:34:12] put it like this it would be like you
[1:34:14] calling me or texting me and I never
[1:34:16] responded maybe I've done that but she
[1:34:23] would start wondering I'll text this guy
[1:34:25] I've called this guy I've text this guy
[1:34:27] I've called this guy and in the midst of
[1:34:30] silence what starts working I don't
[1:34:33] think he loves me as much as he loves
[1:34:34] the rest of him you know he looks at you
[1:34:37] a little funny you know sometimes you
[1:34:40] know how it is I mean he'll go right
[1:34:41] past you in the vestibule
[1:34:43] he won't even shake your hand who's
[1:34:46] leading you to think that way
[1:34:49] well listen I just feel but who's
[1:34:52] leading you to feel that way
[1:34:54] well it seemed like you see what silence
[1:34:58] will do it seems like he didn't even
[1:35:01] care for her he didn't care what care
[1:35:04] whether she lived or died but all the
[1:35:06] time God was working she didn't know
[1:35:10] about it but God told her logic he dried
[1:35:14] up the book reached out his hand and
[1:35:16] stopped the brook from running and
[1:35:17] Elijah said Lord why did you stop the
[1:35:20] brook and he said I've commanded a
[1:35:22] little woman to feed you he already
[1:35:24] commanded her and she didn't know it
[1:35:29] amen you've already been ordained to
[1:35:32] stand in this hour
[1:35:33] you've already been ordained to overcome
[1:35:36] you've already been all day to see
[1:35:38] through this trial you're ordained to go
[1:35:41] through this trial this test has not
[1:35:43] come upon you just out of something
[1:35:46] strange but God has ordained this very
[1:35:49] tile this very test and it brings out
[1:35:51] the quality it brings out
[1:35:53] what is on the inside let's stand just
[1:36:01] as he commanded her she didn't even know
[1:36:03] she did not know but God told her Liza
[1:36:08] I've commanded a widow woman to sustain
[1:36:10] you God had to allow everything to work
[1:36:12] out you know she was tried right when he
[1:36:15] came they're gonna bake me a cake first
[1:36:19] that was a trying that was trying she's
[1:36:23] been praying God increased the mill
[1:36:25] barrel and now comes putting me first
[1:36:29] it wasn't Elijah the man this was God
[1:36:32] speaking through his servant this was
[1:36:35] the word coming put me first
[1:36:37] no wonder brother Ram tells us in
[1:36:39] enticing spirits I love this quote
[1:36:40] brother brems says you show me a man he
[1:36:43] said a factory worker you showed me a
[1:36:44] housewife you show me anyone he said
[1:36:47] that'll put God first he said in
[1:36:48] everything I'll show you a person
[1:36:50] that'll come out on top no matter all
[1:36:52] the devil can put on them why cuz God is
[1:36:55] first gods first she didn't know it
[1:37:05] God's eyes was on her she didn't feel it
[1:37:09] she didn't even see any results going on
[1:37:11] but God's eyes was on him that's why I
[1:37:13] love how I believe it was Ellie who that
[1:37:15] said the job he withdraws not his eyes
[1:37:17] from the righteous as he said in the
[1:37:20] book of Zechariah said his eye he said
[1:37:22] he that toucheth you toucheth the apple
[1:37:23] of his eye this is what God thinks about
[1:37:27] you is what he thinks about me this is
[1:37:30] what he thinks about his word regret
[1:37:33] said he might have commanded you a
[1:37:35] testimony of your healing you may not
[1:37:38] know it but just hang on
[1:37:40] he said God might have commanded there
[1:37:42] to be that over where he said there an
[1:37:45] angel or something he said we'll come by
[1:37:48] God promised to answer he said in May
[1:37:51] and maybe this night before the healing
[1:37:53] service starts tonight might have been
[1:37:54] God seen your condition today he might
[1:37:56] have heard your prayer would just be
[1:37:59] sure stand there
[1:38:03] in the midst of it all as you're
[1:38:05] standing there and God is silent because
[1:38:07] here's where sins in this kind of a dis
[1:38:10] trial where he's silent you've taken his
[1:38:13] word and you're standing there and God
[1:38:17] is silent be sure it's God and wait wait
[1:38:24] on the Lord and he will strengthen your
[1:38:27] heart he is faithful to his word let me
[1:38:33] tell you something right now I can't
[1:38:36] read it to you tonight but I believe
[1:38:37] it's in John chapter 6 when you read it
[1:38:39] in job chapter 6 when job was going
[1:38:41] through the midst of that testing of
[1:38:43] that trial
[1:38:43] you know what the enemy wanted to do the
[1:38:45] enemy wanted to take away expectation
[1:38:47] job said at the beginning of that trial
[1:38:49] he said I know he said that God he said
[1:38:52] when I come forth from this I shall be
[1:38:54] pure as gold but around job six job
[1:38:57] started talking about what he was hoping
[1:38:59] for you know what job was hoping for to
[1:39:01] be taken out of the earth yes sir
[1:39:05] well brother Samuel that's before Joe
[1:39:07] got that mighty revelation that I know
[1:39:09] my Redeemer liveth read on after that
[1:39:11] chapter you find even after that chapter
[1:39:14] that job continues on but Joe needed
[1:39:18] that revelation just like you and I need
[1:39:20] revelation stimulation to move on job
[1:39:25] was the one saying all the day I wish
[1:39:27] that they had been they never would have
[1:39:28] said a man child was born I wish that I
[1:39:31] was taken out of this earth but listen
[1:39:33] friends listen
[1:39:34] God's desire through this particular
[1:39:37] trial is to display his glory it would
[1:39:43] be no Marvel for lives to serve Him for
[1:39:47] us all of us if everything was going
[1:39:50] just right it would be no Marvel
[1:39:54] everybody would want it just for that
[1:39:56] reason but you see what it is is that
[1:39:59] even in the midst of the suffering and
[1:40:02] in the midst of it God Himself just
[1:40:04] looked to him
[1:40:06] trust in him say Lord all of my feelings
[1:40:09] when you feel down when you feel
[1:40:11] discouraged you feeling that way
[1:40:13] listen just turn to him be like David
[1:40:15] what we
[1:40:16] right here tonight from the word let me
[1:40:18] not be ashamed Lord let me not be
[1:40:20] ashamed my hope is in the Lord God my
[1:40:24] expectation is in you Lord Jesus you're
[1:40:27] gonna see me through I might have been
[1:40:29] prayed for five years ago but this is my
[1:40:31] year I might have been prayed for last
[1:40:34] week this is my week or brother Samuel
[1:40:38] that's a hope no that's not a hope so
[1:40:39] that's expectation Abraham when God made
[1:40:44] the promise it was 25 years later but
[1:40:49] hey bruh him the Bible said he grew
[1:40:51] stronger you answer me this question
[1:40:53] what part of Abraham grew stronger that
[1:40:57] ordained part on the inside it's Earl us
[1:41:01] not that outer man that grew stronger
[1:41:03] cuz that outer man stood there at the
[1:41:06] very brink of Genesis 18 and laughed
[1:41:10] when God said you're gonna bring forth a
[1:41:12] son through Sarah tell me who grew
[1:41:15] stronger we would look at that and say
[1:41:17] he didn't get stronger
[1:41:18] he grew a weaker no he grew stronger the
[1:41:20] inside man was growing stronger the
[1:41:23] outside man was growing weaker and the
[1:41:26] inside man took control of the outside
[1:41:29] man that's the same thing happening in
[1:41:33] me and you it's the same things
[1:41:35] happening in me and you circumstances
[1:41:38] and things that go beyond our abilities
[1:41:40] to try to fix them and control them and
[1:41:42] everything and God's letting you and I
[1:41:43] know you can't do nothing about it I got
[1:41:47] it in control it's like trying to adjust
[1:41:51] things and it's stripped I can't turn it
[1:41:54] it's stripped God said but I've got it
[1:41:56] in control he's silent maybe tonight for
[1:42:01] some of you some of us he's been silent
[1:42:04] certain things you're praying about
[1:42:06] but remember his eyes on you and it's
[1:42:09] not from a distance he's right there
[1:42:12] with you he said I'll never leave you
[1:42:15] nor forsake you he's right there to
[1:42:18] strengthen you and strengthen me sure
[1:42:21] brother Samuel sometimes I've got week
[1:42:23] sometimes law I've wavered sometimes
[1:42:26] brother Samuel I haven't thought
[1:42:27] positive he under
[1:42:29] that but he's also the mediator he's the
[1:42:33] high priest that is touched by the
[1:42:35] feeling of your infirmities and here he
[1:42:38] is by way of his word to encourage you
[1:42:40] that I'm right here the whole time
[1:42:43] I've been with you the whole time I'm
[1:42:46] right here walking with you I'm seeing
[1:42:48] you through this but lord I haven't got
[1:42:51] any text from you in a while I'm right

[1:43:08] just pray or Jesus

[1:43:21] lives you know what we have need of you

[1:43:32] to our hearts Lord perhaps here tonight
[1:43:37] I believe in Lord not only here but
[1:43:40] maybe some that are streaming or well
[1:43:42] archived even this service somebody Lord
[1:43:45] God where there are maybe a time right
[1:43:49] now and they're looking in their praying
[1:43:52] they yet Lord as it were your seemingly
[1:43:57] silent Lord perhaps tonight Lord God one
[1:44:01] that would have been praying and looking
[1:44:03] for something maybe there's a promise
[1:44:05] Lord of their healing
[1:44:07] maybe it's deliverance Lord children I
[1:44:10] don't know but you know what that
[1:44:11] promise is Lord financially what
[1:44:14] whatever the need is Lord father tonight
[1:44:17] there there is nothing that's beyond you
[1:44:20] nothing Lord we believe that tonight
[1:44:24] Lord we see that even where the very
[1:44:28] laws of this earth and of gravity and
[1:44:32] other things Lord to see that God how
[1:44:34] that you're able to move were there was
[1:44:36] a young man one time the Lord was born
[1:44:39] without eyes but yet father you created
[1:44:44] not only the eyes but Lord they even
[1:44:47] have that of the the sockets and
[1:44:49] everything developed and the nerves Lord
[1:44:51] we could go on and on and how that we
[1:44:53] had to be connective tissue to the brain
[1:44:55] and all of that had to be connected but
[1:44:57] God by one creative sovereign act you
[1:45:02] sped on the ground put the clay and
[1:45:05] rubbed it upon his eyes and there was a
[1:45:08] sockets that there was eyes that came
[1:45:10] there everything developed Lord God
[1:45:13] by the very creator himself Lord here
[1:45:18] tonight perhaps those are streaming Lord
[1:45:23] there's things that they're holding on
[1:45:24] to promises Gordon maybe there have been
[1:45:29] they've been waiting but has there
[1:45:30] waiting Lord may they take refreshing
[1:45:33] and comfort Lord and I pray then Lord if
[1:45:38] their confession seems to have ceased it
[1:45:43] seems to where that Lord they're not
