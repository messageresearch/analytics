garden and you know they came to get him he said you know why didn't you get me when i was in the temple why didn't you take me then why didn't you get me these different places and uh he said well now it's your hour and it's the power of darkness is why you're allowed to do these things and the thought just kind of struck me that you know it was their hour in the power of darkness but that didn't stop the resurrection he still rose his plan still went forward even the things they did to him was all part of a a four purpose so i just uh that that just kind of struck me how even though you know god let them have have have the power and said hey this is your hour you know go ahead and do what you're going to do it's not going to stop my plan it's not going to stop the resurrection let's just go before him in prayer dear lord jesus we just come before thee in prayer and lord once again we live in another dark age lord here it is you know satan's eating and becoming more and more

you amen we missed you last week amen they say a picture is worth a thousand words well but i want to say this that um i just um we're thankful you know that we have the ability just a little bit lower been a little bit softer for me right now we have just um thankful i thought about this for the brothers that have worked so diligently to be able to make it available to streaming or when we do have needs and we're not able to be here and be able to go back into the services and look at them and watch them and all the efforts that they put in for that and i just i wonder if we just couldn't give just a praise offering to the lord and at thanksgiving brother sean and brother brian have just done such a wonderful job and we just we thank god for that i thank god for that burden amen that that is there it's such a blessing to us um just a reminder here this coming thursday there won't be any service and preparation for the meetings that are coming up here this weekend and i know there's a meeting in the conference room right after the service for the sisters i heard that was announced and also there's announcements that we've posted on in the restrooms it's coming out to you email i think it's on facebook but it just has the breakdown of itinerary of everything that's taking place this weekend so what i would ask if if you would make yourself aware of those things so if someone comes to you and says where's that youth event at and and you don't look and say youth event youth event where where's oh we're having a fellowship dinner can you hear me back there make sure that you look over it's in the restroom there we're also going to have some copies because of the addresses so people can punch in the addresses for things that way that when we have visitors that are coming in here because from my understanding right now uh at least from south carolina that's not even including from anywhere else it's they're bringing a bus so there's a group of people coming in from south carolina here for these meetings so that's exciting amen you know brother branham said it like this when he first saw the pentecostals and he saw him and he began to see how that they were just coming together he said i saw him in the hotels he said they were just hugging one another he said people were so happy said they were spending he said parts he said you know they had to spend parts of their living to get here to a meeting he said but it's like there was no condemnation among them such love he said and something struck my heart and said i believe that this is just how it's going to be before the rapture bees swarm and have a revival amen the geese get together is that right before the great migration and we're going somewhere there's a there's a purpose there's a rapture here upon us and this is just a little foretaste of glory what a privilege that we have and i'll say as an assembly a privilege just to be able to host something for a few days to serve god's people i think that's wonderful i also want to make known to you if you if you don't know what to do then just say find out from brother aaron sister amanda i asked everyone say hey what what can i do like what paul said on the road to damascus what would you have me do lord what can i do to help out what what can we do in any way and so i i know you will and we want to just make the visitors and different ones who will be coming in i know you will do that we always want to make them feel welcome as they're here and i just i think that's it at this point in time but i want to sing this this course before we go into the word this morning also lord willing on the saturday evening service i've just had this on my heart for months now since i had asked brother benny to come he's on the saturday evening service and i spoke with brother benny about it lord willing we're going to have a prayer line on that saturday evening so i ask you to be even in prayer regarding that as well amen there's needs among us and there's a god who's mindful of every need it doesn't matter what the need is he's god if we just could sing this little course if you would before we turn to the word of the lord i've asked brother brian to lead us in that lord i need you i need you right now oh hallelujah oh my could we just enter in now and sing this i need you lord right now hallelujah oh i need you lord i need you lord right now hallelujah [Music] and i worship at your throne [Music] let's just sing it again let's just really enter in from my heart i need you lord i need you lord right now oh i need you lord i need you right [Music] [Music] i need you lord i need [Music] heavenly father that is so true lord we need you we need you lord right now lord jesus as we've come lord into this this moment lord father we ask o god this morning that you would be lifted up lord we ask o god that for every need that's gathered among us lord the request that's upon the hearts of your children would you just lord come by our way lord speak to our hearts lord may faith rise within us lord may you help us lord as speaker and here to just be able to step aside that you might be the the theme right here that oh god that is where you've so impressed yourself upon our hearts and our lives that lord should you tarry when we would leave from the presence of one another and from this service your presence has so impressed our hearts and our lives and so captivated us oh god to where every desire and every ambition is lost in you and it becomes you and you alone father just minister to every need now lord we need you lord i need you lord that you'll come use the gift that you placed in my life help me to get out of the way lord that you might be able to minister to your children help us father we pray now we love you lord we thank you for your mercy in this hour thank you for that precious blood thank you for the grace that's given to us lord sovereign grace for a sovereign hour thank you father we love you we give ourselves to you now lord in jesus precious name amen amen you love the lord amen if you'll turn with me in the scriptures to mark chapter 5. and i'm going to read if you don't mind here there's a few verses of scripture that i just have to read and draw our context from this morning mark chapter 5 and verse 21. and when jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side much people gathered unto him and he was nigh unto the sea and behold there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue gyrus by name and when he saw him he fell at his feet and besought him greatly saying my little daughter lieth at the point of death i pray thee come and lay thy hands on her that she may be healed and she shall live jesus went with him and much people followed him and thronged him and a certain woman which had an issue of blood 12 years and had suffered many things of many physicians and had spent all that she had and was nothing bettered but rather grew worse when she had heard of jesus came in the press behind and touched his garment for she said if i may touch but his clothes i shall be whole i want you to notice in both of these instances they knew if i could just get to jesus my case is settled that's faith and straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague and jesus immediately knowing in himself that virtue that strength had gone out of him turned him about in the press and said who touched my clothes and his disciples said unto him thou seest the multitude thronging thee and sayest thou who touched me and he looked around about to see her that had done this thing but the woman fearing and trembling knowing what was done in her came and fell down before him and told him all the truth and he said unto her daughter thy faith hath made thee whole go in peace and be whole of thy plague if the lord will help us i'd like to speak this morning on the pursuit of your need may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated pardon me i i see there's some different one visitors and maybe faces god bless you welcome and some of you i maybe recognize ben i think i recognize you but it's good to see each and every one of you amen this thought when we look at this the pursuit of your need and i want to just lay in this morning so you can see a direction of where i'm going is is when we're looking at with a need and we see that there's faith in order to receive anything from god we must have faith and i want to lay some things in this morning that really deal with what is the basis of faith and the ways and the measure and the way in which that need what we have need is of how that is obtained from god and i when we look at this the word uh just from our our thought the pursuit of our need to be in pursuit it's the action of following or pursuing someone or something and in order to pursue something it's got to be important to you it's got to be something that is worth following it's something that there is a drawing that's causing you to follow that someone or that something and i know that when we think of the word need when we see this the word need it means to require something because it's very essential or it's very important it's also circumstances in which something is necessary or would require some course of action it's a necessity and so when we think of a need and most of the time things that would accompany when we would have a need or a person has a need there is even a sense of urgency or desperation it comes forth it seems to come up even in the conversations it's things that's upon their mind and what's in the forefront because the need itself is what goes beyond everything else that is around us or life you this is what you become focused upon this need and so it's something when we look at this and i would raise this question to start with this and to think of it in this manner that with every need and no matter what that need is god is the satisfier of that need that's in your life and i want to just begin with a question like this that brother branham would pose in the message what was first the savior or a sinner what was first the savior or a sinner the savior was first which is more powerful savior or sinner if a savior can take away the sin he's more powerful well why did he let sin happen in the first place to show that he was a savior which was the most powerful a healer or a sickness a healer then why did he let sickness come to show that he was a healer oh brother bram said i feel religious right now that's why that's his attributes so when you think of that he says that's why he lets trouble come that's why he let sorrow come to show that he is joy that's why we got a night to prove there is a day that's why we got temper to show there is peace it's pro and con so the attribute all of this here for as a healer as a savior deliver all of those are attributes to meet our needs and those attributes were before there ever was a need before there ever was a sinner he was a savior is that right before there was ever a disease he was already the healer before there was anyone ever bound he was already the deliverer before there was anyone who was lost he was already the shepherd so before our need he was and he is all things that we have need of in psalms 42 7 david would tap in by inspiration a very familiar scripture deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy spouts all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me brother branham would say it like this he says now if you're looking for god that shows that there's something somewhere here that you're looking for before there is a desire in here there has to be something create that desire before now look very simply before there was a fin on a fish's back before there was a fin on a fish's back there had to be a water first for him to swim in or he wouldn't have had need of the fin see it's it's only the fourth thought it's already been prepared god put that fin on him to swim in the water so there had to be a water first before there was a fin on his back before there was a tree to grow on the earth there had to be an earth first for it to grow into or there wouldn't have been no tree to grow it would make no sense simply in your home yard or whatever if you could want the most beautiful bush shrubbery tree but if you have no place to plan it what good does it do to have it before you go and purchase it you must first make sure you have room for it and of course a lot of times we we go ahead and say oh i realize i i didn't need this bush oh oh i thought i needed this picture here oh i didn't need this picture there's no more space to put it but that's us and our finite mind not god god is infinite god already had it planned before notice even in that of creation when you go back to genesis 1 before god ever brought forth the botany life the previous day was already made and came to a preparation to sustain the word that was to come next so it's we find it's a constant unfolding but what unfolds there's already been preparation that's been made ahead of time and that's all from god notice he says if there's a desire in the human heart for more of god how many have a desire for more of god if there's a desire in the human heart for more of god there's got to be more of god somewhere to respond to that deep calling to the deed he says now if there's something in your heart that tells you that there is divine healing in god well now before you could have that in your heart there has to be a creator to put that in your heart and and brother brown we'll go into a simple example that was present within the medical part at that time where they could not figure out why there was a little boy who was eating the petals off of a bicycle chewing them up and they could figure out what's going on and they begin to test and what it was is this little boy lacked sulfur in his body and the reason he was chewing on petals was not because he was infatuated with petals it's because in that pedal with sulfur now i'm going to ask you who directed him to that a little fella was it was there a scientist sitting around and say oh you have sulfur uh you have a need of sulfur let me just tell you where sulfur's at uh it's right here in the petal there was a already there was a desire there was a lacking in his life and that lacking is what was causing that craving but before he could ever have that craving there was already a source to satisfy it if there's something in the human heart craving divine healing there's a fountain open somewhere when he says think about it when you were back yonder just with a lukewarm experience and your heart began to crave for more of god there just had to be a fountain opened somewhere and god sent it and when you're craving for a divine healing there's got to be there's a creator putting that creation in your heart it's calling out deep unto the deep because there's a fountain somewhere so it's god creating that desire that longing in your heart for him he already has your need covered now i want to say it in this way god has a purpose for all his works which we've just been looking at this god has a purpose god is not an author of frustration things are not just well this is just happening because no it doesn't work that way god is a god of purpose everything from there even when we look uh from the beginning even where the stars themselves the bible says that every star it has a name it even speaks of even the constellations that are put there the scriptures were referred to in the book of micah in the book of psalms and how that the bible would say that the heavens declare the handiwork of god there's a story that is told the story of redemption is told right there right through everything of the skies and it's reflected here even in earth it's all wrote out and god is a god of purpose everything that he it does as we were looking there in genesis 1 everything is unfolding the very purpose of god let me just say it like this when you go to see a drama how many have you ever seen a drama a play before okay that drama or play it's not something that's just being ad-libbed at that moment that drama has already been wrote someone has composed it someone has thought it through and there is someone that could pick it up and they begin to identify parts for that play and when you sit there or i sat there what we begin to behold is that drama which was already wrote it's acting out the plot the scenes the villain and who all it is let me just say this this drama has been already from before the foundation of the world in the mind of god in revelations chapter 13 the scripture tells us that the lamb was land before the foundation of the world when we read isaiah 53 it says he was slain he was bruised and yet he was not even manifested on this earth as the lamb of god but isaiah 53 isaiah was picked up into the realms to see it was a finished work but that drama had to be acted out and so that's the very thing that's taking place even now it's an unfolding that's why the things as a as a believer we're not looking around to the events or things in the world and say oh my what's going on but we can see because in the the bible is a book of prophecy the bible says what have what what is hath already been the spirits and things that we see upon the earth today it was already back there in the days of sodom as it was in the days of lot and noah we we see all of this it's unfolding in this time but all while all of that wickedness and evil is unfolding there is a great reality of the righteousness of god that's being unfolded among his children in this hour we're being caught up in that in everything he does or brings to pass it's because of that which he purposed in himself second timothy chapter 1 verse 8 be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our lord nor of me his prisoner but be thou a partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of god who hath saved us i want you just to look at this verse very clear carefully who hath saved us and called us with an holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in christ jesus before the world began but is now made manifest by the appearing of our savior jesus christ who hath abolished death and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel now when you put it in in into the into that perspective this purpose and grace it was already established there in christ jesus before the foundational world the purpose that you and i are here upon this earth right here this morning was already established in christ before the foundation of the world to say it if you have eternal life or come to eternal life you always were and you were in his thinking before the foundation the world as a matter of fact brother branham would put it as simple as this he says for you there's some part in you that's eternal and that eternal only belongs to god and in god was his thinking of you setting right where you're at now in his thinking i stood at the pulpit because he's infinite and knows all things therefore he could tell the end from the beginning because he's eternal and you being a son of god or a daughter of god then you were in his thinking at the beginning and when the holy spirit come listen to this carefully when the holy spirit come and you're on earth walking around here as a sinner but way down in your life there is something you don't know what's taking place but you're hungry [Music] who put that desire there within you sunday school teacher didn't do it pastor didn't do it god put that desire in you and that desire come from him oh my oh he says there's something in you something you never put in there it's something that you couldn't desire to be in there it's something that's contrary to your own nature it's the foreknowledge of god that's taking place think of it he says jesus was born the son of god to be emmanuel god's full expression in a man and he found him in perfect obedience down at the river jordan being baptized by that prophet and as soon as he obeyed him and walked out of the water the heavens opened to john and he saw the holy ghost descending from heaven and he said this is my beloved son perfect obedience the spirit had sought him out in obedience oh wayward man or woman this morning when you're sitting here and there's something in you telling you this is right it's the holy spirit seeking you out to bring you to a knowledge of truth of this hour that we're living in now that it's not of an hour gone by but it's a present god right now it's the holy spirit something in you that will tell you this is right what is it it's the holy spirit what's he doing he's coming to minister to the need he's coming to minister to that need and when he comes listen to me when he comes to minister to that need that need that was within our life am i trying to fit in here try to satisfy with this try to satisfy with this try to satisfy with this but when he comes along what happens is he begins to pull upon that need and you begin to recognize that this is who i have really been looking for and what i've been looking for all my life what is it grace has come to you when you or i could not find him or find our way or make sense of the need that lay in our life but god knew where you were got nowhere i was and god comes by your way he begins to stir up that need that's on the inside that only he can satisfy in genesis 1 in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth period and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters there's a purpose god created heavens and the earth and how this creation notice even how everything is coming into its place it's the earth even at that moment here without form it's it's void it's just it's covered over with darkness and there's just like a sign of judgment here it is but yet beneath that darkness there is seed beneath that darkness there's a purpose and beneath that darkness there's a god above it all that is going to move back the darkness and change this earth from a chaotic state lacking order and lacking purpose it's going to reveal the purpose of the earth itself who can do that but god a man of the earth was without form and what happened the spirit of god began to move it began to brood upon the earth oh brother adam would say it like this and believe in god he said do you know what how did god make the earth this earth that you're sitting on this morning people don't want to believe in faith how did god make the earth he spoke it you see it he spake and the word come into existence and this world this morning is the spoken word of god and he believed his own word are you with me now here it is watch it if god and you're an offspring of him and god is in you he will believe his own word can i read that again if god you're an offspring of him i did not become just the son of james and pat browning i was in my daddy and my great great granddaddy in my great great great great granddaddy it was all way down and let me tell you as a son and daughter of god it's not a happenstance we were in the loins of god's mind before the foundation of the world brother samuel i don't know if i can believe that if you're a believer there's something that's greater than your belief it's god's belief that begins to move in your heart i mean think about it in the days of noah when noah said it's going to rain they could shoot the moon in those places come on friends they weren't just like you know cavemen walking around with rocks and and campbell suit cams with yarn tied around they were advanced civilization is that right but to find out that that within that they could prove noah what you're preaching about there is no proof out there but noah had a greater proof than any scientific part and that proof was god had spoke to his heart and they had a choice everybody had a choice whether they wanted to believe it or they didn't want to believe it but the message that came was not for everybody it was preached as though all would be saved but god knew there was an elected part that was going to go in that ark no one ever had to make one renovation no one ever had to say you know what we need to build a bigger housing complex in this ark because there's more people than god ever intended god built the ark with the specification knowing everyone that would be there they already had a place in that ark before that ark was ever mentioned before it ever came in to manifestation their place was already there from the mind of god let me tell you something you might be wondering why you're sitting here this morning but there's already a place that's been allotted to you in jesus christ and this word that god has sent in this hour it pulls upon your heartstrings hallelujah and if god you're an offspring of him and god is in you he will believe his own word though it can't be seen felt taste or anything you'll believe it why for god in you will believe his own word then you don't look at things you see you look at things that god said the bible says in hebrews 11 3 through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god now let me just begin to just move into a place here faith is not blind that's called hope faith is vision faith is sight faith has a reason faith has a purpose faith is a substance are you with me now through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear romans chapter 10 verse 16 think about faith here but they have not obeyed the gospel for isaiah said lord who hath believed i report think about when the lord jesus stood there his life god was confirming every word that was spoken regarding the messiah right through his life it was no longer a written a written canon of scripture but now it was flesh it was acting out it was no longer something in the drama to be it was now being acted out that part when when jesus said lord i come in the volume of the drama or the volume of the book which is written of me i come to do thy will oh god is that right to see when he stood there yet many that were reading the script they looked and they saw him and they said you're bill's above you're a chief of devils huh and they they they walk so piously so confident within their religious as a matter of fact within their life you don't read anywhere in scripture where you can get a glimpse as though that they had any need of what the messiah was what they were longing for was a messiah that would vindicate them they wanted a messiah that would match what they wanted but the messiah are you hearing me now but the messiah jesus never came to match what they wanted he came to meet the needs that were within his subjects hallelujah look at this so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god so faith of the vehicle the agent by which faith comes is by hearing the word of god now there's a lot of big difference between listening at something and hearing it a person could listen to the gospel as a drunk a dope addict a prostitute all those other things and listen to it and say yeah it's true they listen to it they could hear it but when you really hear it you understand it and when you're on you say how do i know i understand it it changes your life there's a change that moves on the inside there's something that reaches down to minister to that need that you've tried to satisfy in a battle or bottle tried to find it in a woman tried to find it in a man tried to find it in a job tried to find it in a stock tried to find it in all the sorts and things but it can never ever be satisfied because there's only one and that is the living god who put that thirst in you that need and there's a pursuit for that need in your life when he comes across and begins to touch begins to stir that need up in your life so faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god let me refer to one place in the scripture there was a little woman in joshua too by the name of rahab and i just want you to watch this here is the word going forth she's here in the promised land the scriptures what she begins to give account to those two spies who come in there she says we have heard all the lord has done before you we've heard about the red sea being dried up we've heard about the kings of zion and all the rest of them the bashan and all of those kings that god has brought down we've heard these things she said and our hearts have melded and neither is there courage in any man because of you for the lord your god he is god in heaven above and in earth beneath now notice everybody in jericho is hearing this they're hearing the moving and the working of the lord there's no question in jericho who is the lord and speaking of they were filled with other deities they had all gods all around there in jericho but there was no question on who was the greatest their gods were gods of walls gods that they had to pick up and put a pedestal and they had to pack their god around and put their god on the pedestal and they were the ones that made their god but how much different it was from that of the children of israel how much different it is between you and i and them because we did not make god god hath created us it is not i who have to find a place for him it is him that has found a place for me it is not i that have to pack him around he packs me around i don't have to prop him up he props me up [Applause] we've heard these things they all heard remember faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god now they knew judgment was coming their courage in their hearts was melded right they were nervous but here's the difference rahab's hearing the same thing there's no courage that this city is going to stand but here's something that begins to move in her heart this was always there but now when it came time and the lord is moving into the land she was there behind those walls she was trapped behind those walls but she was hearing the same report and when she heard that report she asked them a question show kindness and mercy to me and to my house and give me a true token there was a reason now now here a faith that begins to move while the rest of them doubt was taking place there is a faith that begins to move within her heart and notice that faith begins to move and when these spies come there this is where then now what's already moving that longing that she's had that desire that you know where she's had to try to find it this way satisfied here satisfied there but nothing could satisfy but now when here she hears the lord is moving and it's just something that just stirs within her if i can just just get into his presence if i can just receive from him there is a need that was already in her life but now when she begins to hear it begins to stir up a pursuit of that need to where that need begins to take priority over every other need in her life and she says give me a true token she had a desire to be free i want you to think of this faith itself it's based on some reason you've got to have some reason some purpose thinking of our texts that we've read it's got to be the right motive and that reason and that motive has to be him in first peter chapter 3 verse 15 it says sanctify the lord god in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear so what's the reason you're doing what you're doing what's the reason you're walking as you walk what's your reason that you abstain from this what's your reason see your reason your reason it declares the faith and faith declares the reason now just listen to this because there's needs that you and i would have in our life there's no doubt setting in this congregation this morning there's lives and hearts that need to meet the lord jesus you need a savior there's lives that need the full work of redeemer and to receive the holy ghost there's live setting here this morning you see the holy spirit look savior is to save you from your sins save is to it is a repentance and it cuts off the past sin but what the holy ghost does see sanctifying comes in to cleanse out the desires and the holy spirit comes to redeem and remove anything that was ever against you not just your past but your nature your life has been changed from the inside out not a 10-step program not a five-step program but it's called meeting jesus face-to-face give me a true token hallelujah notice a reason and i hope so notice brother brandon picks this up in a paradox and he says you know of course he says you can't have faith unless you've got some reason you've got to have a reason first there's got to be a purpose just like when you come to the house of god or anything you do there's got to be a reason there's got to be a reason and what does that do when you've got a reason you've got a purpose that's faith faith must have a reason so faith isn't just something that's just well it's just it's just out here no faith has a basis you can't have faith unless you've got some reason he said i tried to say last night some people's faith is in their textbook some people's faith is in something else but depends on where your faith is i want to believe god's word what he says is true then i've got to see whether it's his will or not now let's just get down on this if it's his will i gotta check out my objective to it and then my motive in doing it my motive is your motive is what's your motivation behind it why why do you want god to give you the holy ghost why why do you want to be saved why what's the motivation behind it it would seem like that that that should not even be a non-question if that that if a person is asking for that but you see what matters is what's the reason because if there's no reason behind it no real true motive then it's not faith it will not come to pass god had a reason when he stepped forward and everything began to unfold remember this purpose and grace was in him before the foundation of the world this reason was in him he has a reason in everything that he's doing notice he says i if i do it he says if i do it and i say and ibraheem gives an example here is this okay i really just want to lay this in here this teaching he says i'm going over the mountain here there's a mountain before me there's a million people on that side perishing and i got 100 million over here i'm preaching to well if i can't get over around or under the mountain or nothing and yet something in my heart keeps telling me go over the mountain go to them go to them and i can't get it over then jesus said thou shalt move this mountain are you hearing me now there's a need who put that who put that in his heart god put that in his heart the need that we need was already there but god stirs that up because as an instrument to go preach the gospel and god says go over this mountain here and he's looking at the mountain that mountain's awful high i don't know if i can even get around i don't know if i can get through it i i don't know but he's but what it comes back to is that i didn't put that in here god put that in there then if god put that in there then i can say to this mountain be thou removed it says now the thing of it is he says i never created that and there's something created it's a before good cause paragraph 99 now the first thing he says i'll have to say well if i go over there and this side can only pay me so much a month and over here he says my motive's not right my objective's not right i will be catching it something's putting it in his heart go over there god's putting it in his heart go over there but if his motive even though god's putting in his heart if his motive's not right it's not going to work god is a very detailed god very purposeful he will not share his glory with no one now this is really where we get down to faith we're talking about coming to needs pursuit of needs he says if i go you know i go over there he says well now what if i say in paragraph 100 now i don't care about the money but when i get over there someday you know what i don't care about the money but someday when i get over there the ages to come they'll pick up a great big monument and say brother branham the great missionary still my motive is not right but when i don't care if they ever know who went over there here's the key he's just in my heart then i'll speak to that mountain and it'll happen it's got to amen so in other words i'm not just coming to receive the holy ghost because everybody else is i'm not just coming through a prayer line because everybody else is i'm not just coming to the altar because everybody else is i'm not just coming you know for healing because well you know i don't know what else to do but there's got to be a reason there's got to be a purpose and that has to be him oh brother samuel i want my marriage straightened out so i'm going to serve the lord wrong motive it's true the lord jesus can either straighten out your marriage or give you grace to walk alone but we don't put those things ahead of him seek ye first the kingdom of god and all these other things shall be added unto you hallelujah the same god that rises that need within your life to cause you to pursue that need that same god can take you as an instrument as a channel as a conduit of his power his love his mercy and work on your spouse work on your family he said if i be lifted up from this earth i will draw all men unto me it's got to be about him he says see your motive and your objective depends on who you are and what business that's where the church misses it he says so far they get worked up in an emotion first thing you know in enthusiasm and you don't stop to check it back here again you check there for sure then it's thus saith the lord see whether it's right i would say it like this it would be good that even before we come to the house of god then we come with a real reason and we come with a real purpose not just showing up i wonder what i i just wonder you know i wonder how the service is going to go today that's not the right reason and you sure won't get nothing you say how do i get something because you're coming with the reason that i want to hear from him i've got needs in my life and there's something in me i want more of him see brother samuel what if there's a lot of other things that's clouded out there there can be satan would love to fill your life with earthly carnal material things that you could argue and say it's not sinful but anything that starts crowding out him or lessening that desire or your fervency it's building unbelief and doubt you want to have your life filled with things that build faith are you with me that's the reason we read our bible and we pray is to bring us into a place to be sensitive for god to speak to us not that we would be able to walk around and quote this scripture and quote this quote that's not the purpose the purpose of being in the word and being in prayer is so that we remain sensitive to him now jesus said i'm coming down here but in matthew 21 i want to finish laying this in is that okay the scripture we've read this for many times here jesus has come verse 18 in the morning as he returned into the city he hungered and when he saw a fig tree in the way he came to it and found nothing there on but leaves only and said unto it let no fruit grow on thee henceforth forever and presently the fig tree withered away this listen to me now it wasn't even the time for this fig tree to have fruit on it but it had a false representation leaves were still on it are you hearing me shouldn't have been any leaves on it but the leaves were a false representation because when the leaves are on the trees he knew when leaves are there there ought to be fruit that's why in this hour when the holy spirit would send the word he's seeing things he saw things among the churches and he's looking will i find faith upon the earth will i find fruit what's he doing this is the season for fruit this is the season let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the lamb has come this is the season for the rapture this is the season of the fullness of the holy ghost this is the season where the root where the fruit is ripening in the top of the tree you see an expectation for this hour and when it came among the churches the church just says we're rich we're increased with goods we have need of nothing and they put him out of the church now i ask you this question if jesus is on the outside of the church pray tell me who's being worshipped on the inside the scriptures tell spelled that out very clearly is that right it's not worshiping god you hearing me verse 20 when you when the disciples saw it they marveled saying how soon is the fig tree withered away and jesus said unto them verily i say unto you if you have faith notice if you have faith and doubt not you shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree but also if you shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea it shall be done and all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing you shall receive believing what's believing it's faith how do what do we have faith we've got a reason i've got a reason for asking for my healing i've got a reason for asking for the holy ghost i've got a reason for asking for deliverance are you with me there's a reason i'm not just haphazard i'm a reason you see when there's a reason when there's a reason you ever heard you heard people speak about other people and say man they're driven man they're focused man they're intense come on you know man they're just this is all they can talk about you know why that's what's on their mind that's what's number one that's what's focused and that's that's when god begins to deal with the heart and where your need of him it becomes greater than every other need in your life brother samuel it's not there yet but you keep feeding that need he put that there and the pursuit of that need he satisfies that need let me just close or bring this in this moment jesus said this is the confidence in first john 5 14. this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us and we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask if we know that we have the petitions we know that we have the petitions that we've desired of him let me just let me just abraham says this is our promise then in the message inspiration it's just our faith in doing what he said when he said ask the father anything in my name and i'll do it whatsoever he asked in my name you shall have kind heavenly father and his kindness has given us this privilege of having what we would want or desire as long as it's in his will of course and we know when it's his will if it's according to the word then we know it's his will how many believe it's his will for healing that's his word if it's his word it's his will are you hearing me now there's no question if it's his word if if his word says repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost that's his word that's his will are you with me so we know that's his will we know when we ask according to his will now brother graham steps back in the same message and he's talking about the first thing that i always try to find out was whether it's god's will or not to do a certain thing and then test my motive towards doing it if i have no selfishness nothing and i know it's god's will and i'm doing it for that purpose everybody say purpose because it's his will he won't fail you then so my purpose my reason must be because it's his will not because man if i could you know stop blind so much i'd be a better business guy i could stop cheating so much i'd be a better husband man if i could just if i could just get her get rid of these prescription drugs that dope me up you know i i would think more clearly i'd be a better daddy all those are good things but it's got to be according to his will what's the motive and the reason behind it the reason and the motive it must be about him lord i need you i need healing i need deliverance i need freedom i need you it's about you lord not about my status in society not about making my business better not about me it can't be about me it can't be about you it's got to get to a place to where the need itself is greater than any other need if it's his will and you've got a selfish motive in it it's just the same as it not being his will it won't work that's why i've said you could take and bear with me a moment you could take hundreds of young people older or whatever and they can come for the holy ghost but if they're not coming for really the right reason they're not going to receive it are you hearing me think back to our texts now it's not just with the holy ghost i i hope this is i don't just hope i know god woke me up early and put these things there's needs setting right here this morning needs throughout all this building i'm certain of that because we've come together because we're a needy people i'm not strong on my own neither are you our source of strength is in the lord but the same when it comes to deliverance it comes for healing it's got to be our need our reason i'm not going to read this quote this morning but can i refer to it very quickly brother branham if you haven't listened to the message i have heard but now i see listen to that over the next few weeks and brother braham is dealing with this he says you want god to heal you why why do you want god to heal you so you can continue to live the way that you've been living or do you want god to heal you so that you could serve him you could serve him better what's the reason everybody wants to be well is that right my goodness when a couple weeks ago when i you know for that day or those 12 hours whatever man i was i just started praying for others in need just started praying for others you want to be well you it feels you come back to that man i want to feel good again right i want to be able to try to keep meetings and appointments that i've made and things like that and you're wondering man am i going to be able to do it the next day everybody there's not one person in here that doesn't like to feel well and i'm not only talking about in your physical body i'm talking about even in your mind and emotionally and in the greatest greatest healing of all your soul there's a pursuit of a need and let's just just just pause this here and come back to our text for a moment here was a man by the name of jairus ruler of a synagogue he had a nice position a matter of fact what was surrounding him they wanted nothing to do with jesus but there was something already in jairus heart that was placed there and when he began to hear about jesus there were things that began to stir up in his heart but god allowed a situation to arise that would force that need to the forefront what grace grace i'm sorry what grace what grace came to me what grace came to you the need that i had the need that you had for the lord and god allowed a situation i know sometimes people can come we can come into situations that are bitter that are hard situations that could turn people and question why god why did you do this why did you take this one why did you situations could come in their way but what grace is given when god can move down and there's a need that's already there and god begins to speak to that need and it causes that need that's been there the whole time to come to the forefront lord it's you that i need something begins to pulsate in your heart he's all i need this is what i need this is what i've been longing for he's the one this is it right here i'm finding something i'm finding that which is touching my life jairus don't you go down there you know your friends will unfriend you they'll take you off of that twitter account like other people they'll do all of that but jairus said too late you see at one time listen to me now he had that need that was there the whole time down in his heart he knew that jehovah was still a god of miracles but khan allowed a situation to come to where that need it came to the forefront in his life and at one time all that pressure he had what am i going to do what if they get rid of me at the synagogue what if my friends don't like me what if this one happens what if my husband what if my wife one of my associates on the job what are all all those things around and what happens that need begins to rise to where that means more to him than any associates his daughter is at the point of death and he makes his way someone says jairus jesus has just landed on the shores jairus is gone he's desperate there's a need and he's in pursuit of that need he doesn't even think about what would be the chances or the odds that i'll get to him he's not even thinking about that because faith is finding an unseen source he's moving into a channel and he gets to the lord jesus that's a that's a miracle that's a paradox out of the crowds that are around and he gets there and says the bible says this he besought him greatly come to my house lay your hands on my daughter and not she might she shall be well what was he doing saying to this mountain be thou removed and on the way here's a woman 12 years 12 years she's had an issue of blood she has spent her money for physicians to help her nothing wrong with doctors thank god for doctors but those physicians couldn't help her maybe they gave her all sorts of pills and all sorts of tests and everything and she no doubt would leave this time lord i trust this works i trust this works i'm trusting you lord you know like when you take your medicine you should pray over it right it didn't work 12 years she suffered but then the bible says she heard about jesus she heard about him who he is and she said in herself if i can touch him it's over if i can get to jesus it's over and she made it what was it the pursuit of her need and her need his need your need my need is him let's pray heavenly father lord in this audience and congregation of people this morning over children of god brothers and sisters of light precious faith that lord with an attentiveness lord to your voice to your word now lord as faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god lord there's one thing that we strive and we is the very purpose of all of our life is that the word of god would have the preeminence here lord is that lord jesus that you were just lord it would be your word it's not a it's not a fanaticism it's not an emotion but god the word of god the spirit of god coming upon the word and speaking that word to our hearts and something begins to speak on the inside this is for you this is your moment this is what you've been longing for that of the holy spirit lord moving down to minister to these needs lord in this building here this morning there's many needs we all have need of you lord and that's just not something we just say it's the truth lord there's need for healing physically in our bodies there's need lord god for healing in the mind and the spirit and there's a need for healing in the soul lord jesus [Music] lord god i believe you're here lord i know you're here [Music] now lord as your word has declared when they made their way into the house that day and some of them couldn't get into it but there was four of them that carried a man and they took the roof off of that place and lowered him right where you were standing the bible says that you were present to heal them the lord there's no amount of words alone that can take away suffering there's no words alone that can bring healing [Music] but you father you are the word and lord your presence your spirit brooding even right now you're here to cause those needs lord in that life to rise to the forefront maybe it's already here but lord i pray that may there be lord there's needs that rose to that place this morning hearts that lord that come to a real purpose and into a place to where [Music] it's you that i need lord it's not about anything else it's about you [Music] the right motive the right objective the reason granted lord i pray before there ever was a fin on a fish's back there was water to swim in before there was ever a tree made to grow there was an earth prepared for it to grow in before there was a need in your life for a savior he was already a savior before there was a need for a deliverer he was already a deliverer [Music] why don't you just let him minister to your need this morning just let that knee just come to the forefront in your life say lord you're all that i need lord you're all that i need lord jesus just let it rise to that place i don't care where you've been i don't care what you've been through let that need rise out in your heart maybe that need this morning it leads you into a place of real repentance with god that need this morning raises you to a place to walk further in his word to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ that need rises within your life the lord i i need the holy ghost i want lord your life and me i'm tired of declaring me i want my life to be lord of display of you i want real life real life real substance real joy wonders our heads are bowed this morning where there be hearts and say lord remember me lord i have need i have a need god bless you oh don't be ashamed in his presence god bless you he's here to minister to your need no matter what that need is he's here to minister to your need god bless you hallelujah father you're so loving and kind lord the desires o god that we would have lord in you you lord are the one before there was ever that desire before ever that need you were before it lord the father behind every hand in every heart may you just lord just minister so personally lord if there's anything lord where we can look back and as the word will always bring liberty it brings freedom and when we can look and recognize that lord there's nothing wrong with your word there's things lord that we can look back and say maybe my motive just wasn't right my objective just wasn't lying but i'm so glad i'm so glad that we can look to you and pray and say lord don't let me go until my motives right lord let my motive be lined with your motive lord lord i want the word to keep working on my life i'm going to keep feeding on the word like david said i've set the lord always before me i want the word to so move and to deal and change and move in my life lord to where every motive and objective is lined up with the will of god granted lord we pray for the pursuit of our need in jesus precious me amen amen if you'd like to stand and change our position of seed but let's just worship him let's just allow just the water of the holy spirit just to come down upon that seed a seed has went forth a word has went forth [Music] things like this when you see brother branham would take in many different places and there's times because when we speak about faith and there's it gets really down it moves away all the confusion moves away everything else it takes away frustration when we can see that part what's the motive what's the objective it's god's will now what's my motive in it what's my objective in it and when we can stop back to that place to where it's just about him that's what it's about you know you can ask god to bless your business you can ask god to bless the things that you're doing that's not sinful you can ask god because god promised he would do that and when you do it with that manner that lord because i want you to be glorified i don't want none of these things to be a distraction i want to be focused on you lord you're my provider you're the one that provides my meat you're the one that provides my clothing you're the one that provides lord i'm asking for your blessing that's not sinful i know that there's things that where people in the world and things has been taken in that way and oh you know naming and claiming and you know god will give you a bmw that's foolishness there's principles in god's word but our our purpose in everything why do we ask god listen god's just not in the healing business he said beloved i would that thou would just prosper in health even as thy soul doth prosper sometimes i wonder if we're praying so much for healing and saying god lead me in the right healthy way that got quiet [Music] lord help me because your word said you would then i would be in health why why would you want to be in health why would you want just like one of the first times when they came about my back and they said oh you know you're backing your discs and things in your back you know 19 years ago i looked at and i filled this prescription bottle tylenol for i turned it around the side and it said may cause drowsiness so i ain't taking that i'm not against medicine but i told my wife i said if i take that then i'm not going to be able to study i said i'm going to study because god has called me to preach his word i didn't take it i did not refuse to take it because i was bigger than that but there was a purpose there was a reason that was about him not about me if i've got to get a recliner and prop up my leg so that pain that fire going down my leg i will do that and we did that for that time but a reason it's a reason so when we're praying for things what's our reason it's about him we can let it get to that place where it's single where it's about him lord bless my marriage lord that you would be the center lord the unseen one in our home lord god bless our marriage in such a way to there's such a love and atmosphere of the holy spirit pharaoh god to where when we fail one another we're mistakes where we let one another down in our human instrumentality there's such grace and such love that you're glorified that when it's all said and done whenever people are saying how do you have a marriage like that you can say it's because of jesus how you're able to face these things all this is coming upon the job and this is happening this happened and you can say because i've asked god that god would bless the works of my hands that god would lead me and god would guide me because he promised he'd take care of me oh so you're wanting a you're wanting this you're wanting that no nothing wrong with having other desires and having dreams but there's one thing that i want i want him above everything else i want him to be glorified i want my life to be lived in such a way that there's no entanglements of the world what is it it's a need that's rising in our life that's what the rapture is in the heart of a believer it's rising above every other need [Music] it's the pursuit of that need [Music] i say oh god let us move with that real reason let us move with that real purpose let us set our sights our affections on things above let us move in that lord do you love him amen pray over those things pray for him god we want you to bless our church we want you to pour out your spirit lord god we want you to move among us lord we want you to save lord and lord our young people we want you lord god to deal with our loved ones i want you lord jesus to touch the lives than in my job and where i'm at lord we're after that last one i want someone else to know that same peace that same joy that same reality where i once was that they come to know you lord then it's about him not
