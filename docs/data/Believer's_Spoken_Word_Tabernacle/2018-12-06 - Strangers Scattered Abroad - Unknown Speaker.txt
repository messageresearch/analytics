grace of God when you think of it how much how great is the grace to speak of this hour of what God would open to you and I the closing out of all things and it comes to you and I grace grace grace amen I believe that's the reality when God's grace has so struck our hearts and that reality it takes ahold sin loses any hold whatsoever to recognize what he's already done for you oh my that's with everything in every need oh we just think God tonight for His mercy and we just so grateful to be able to make the acquaintance of brother Jason to Mars and so glad to have him here and he's got two is two of the daughters are here with him and his wife and the littlest one has had to be back at the hotel room wasn't feeling too well so we want to remember them in prayer that God will just comfort them and would just just strengthen them and we're just looking forward to the word of the Lord and I believe that God really has something special in store for us tonight because every time that his people gather according to his word he will always honor his word he said wherever two or three are gathered together in my name there will I'd be in the midst and that's what really makes a meeting is when he's in the midst how many times when they walked down the road when Luke 24 how many times had they been and maybe that little place that little home and where they had gathered but that day it was a different day when he came in and they invited him in that was different the whole focus itself everything changed there an illumination that began to move within their heart to guide them to the promise that God had for them of the Holy Ghost oh it was a great day in that hour aren't you grateful for God's grace all it took was them to say they constrained him and said come in oh my and so in this time we just want to welcome brother Jason and just so good to have him here the first time and we just want to make him feel welcome hold on the gift of God and just to glean from the word but Jason come brother god bless you tonight amen brother and it's good to have you amen god bless you each and every one god bless you all we're glad to be here with you we got some treacherous roads treacherous roads and things but you're out here and it's not just a religious habit but it's something that's in your heart and that's that's the greatest pressure it might make the state might fall with that that something on the inside yes that's browning you that's keeping you regardless of all these difficulties situations that's privileged revelation understand we mark in this day three dots what a revelation what a joy understand that Lord we want to give our hearts to move moving our lives moving our homes moving our families moving our neighbourhoods Lord yes and let us just be there as a vessel that as as the prophet of God said I was just there while he was doing it yes and so let us be people of Prayer yes that would really see your hand and everything in our lives we ask it Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen if you want to bring up the PowerPoint I just tonight I'm gonna share my testimony how the Lord called me to the Ministry called me to the message and and how the missions work that we're doing what the Lord is doing there and in a few scriptures we'll talk about as well so I just to start just very briefly I work with Iran Ian's rep they're mostly I'm working with refugees that have fled Iran and that are living now in the country of Turkey so the two countries are neighboring to each other there and from there I'll share some more background as we go forward and if you want to bring up second slide so I grew up in a Lutheran home my mom my mom and dad raised me to believe the Bible which is strange hearing that I was in a Lutheran home and we believed the Bible but my mom attended someone called Bible Study Fellowship it was a Bible study for women actually she still does to this day and this is what I also attended as a child with her and it was just emphasized we believe the Bible and it was actually it's a like an inner denominational type of thing and so that was something that was just functional in me from the very foundation and so as time went on I I was involved with sports I'll put it that way that was my whole life baseball basketball and football I ate it and read that and slept it that was to me that was everything III can think back and most of my memories as a child is somehow involving sports for myself or for my brother or watching professional games with my dad and getting into high school I was pretty good at all three sports as well and as time went along I was getting recruited to go to different colleges to play there right at the end of mice I I was a worldly kid basically all that time but coming into the end of my senior year I got hooked up with kind of the wrong crowd and I started smoking marijuana and drinking and it wasn't something that I was engaged in at all because of sports but somehow I got roped into it and it was through someone pushing and influencing and influencing me and I said no many times but it just sucks saying yes one time and that was took the ball down the wrong wrong court so during a during all this that was going on my partying and and that kind of lifestyle I had to select the college that I was gonna go to so there was different private colleges that I was I was looking at one was Lutheran another was Catholic and so on one was a Baptist that was very conservative and serious about Christianity and it was a definite part of school that was that's Bethel University so I was looking at the schools I remember sitting in my room and I heard a voice speak go to Bethel College and so I never had an experience like that before but it was something that was just like an it was written with an iron pen on my soul immediately I picked up the phone and I told the coach coming to Bethel I went out and told my parents and they were there they were shocked because they knew what I was doing that I would make that choice where they were very happy that I made that decision to go to a Christian school and I went there and just like you can find at any school you can find the party crowd very easily and I did and I kind of went along that route for the first about two years my for some reason I went to that school and the coaches just they didn't like me they recruited me I came from what I understand I did well but it was something that was like their minds were blinded to continuing with me to play to play me more and so I was so frustrated and it's a lot of time that you dedicate a lot of effort that you dedicate and you miss a lot of things when you're playing especially playing college sports and I was just fed up with all of that and not getting the reward of playing and the games and so I just told my dad and mom I think I'm gonna quit playing playing sports and I'll just do intramural stuff something that's fun because it's not really fun for me anymore and and it was really God's Way of getting me to slow down and seeing that there's other priorities in life and so I started playing intramural basketball and there's these two Presbyterian Calvinists that I became friends with we played on the same team together and so we would get together all the time and they were just passionate about predestination and the Reformation and so they just would talk about it all the time then they would ask me questions I had no idea what they're talking about I just listened yeah yeah okay so then they would ask me well what do you think we'd be talking about predestination do you believe in predestination said how I've never even heard of it before but you're quoting the Bible so if it's in the Bible absolutely I believe that and so they said well why are you living the way you're living if that's you believe in predestination you believe in the Bible why are you partying and swearing every other word and why are you doing that said well I know I shouldn't do it and I'll stop doing it eventually but right now I'm just having some fun and I went along like that probably for another year or so and these guys kept just talking about these things talking about salvation by faith without works without the works of the law and it's just something they're just constantly talking about I remember one day so we we would go every Tuesday to Buffalo Wild Wings they had cheap wings for college students and so we would get we would go there and that's where we would talk about the Lord and I I would enter in a little bit but really I just said it listened for hours really one time I was driving home from there and as I was as I was driving I was kind of you know you go through hopefully none of you have gone through this but if you ever have and you've had have godly influence and you have a mother praying for you you'll go and you'll go to a party you'll do the things you shouldn't do and then you come home and you have a conviction in your heart what am i doing why am I doing this I don't understand it it's like I don't have power to stop I want to stop even I go to these parties and tell people no no no okay and but then I get home you know I've got Bible class in the morning at this College so I get back and I've been smoking marijuana and I opened my Bible and I start reading oh my oh I'm just so convicted all right I'm gonna stop I'm gonna stop it I'm gonna stop it and then the next time it comes the same thing repeat repeat repeat repeat so eventually as I'm driving home back to that after many times of trying to stop on my own power I just said lord I just want to serve you I didn't pray the sinner's prayer I didn't have any formula I just said I just want to serve you Lord and it was like in that instant all the weight of my sin left my shoulders and so I was changed from that time there was a hunger inside of me for the Word of God that I couldn't describe before that reading a book it never happened I don't know that through through all the schooling that I had done if I'd actually read the entire assignments that were given to me I don't know that I'd ever read a book maybe my mom could tell different but I'm pretty sure I never did then all of a sudden I started going to this Baptist Church and the pastor said if you don't have money just take the books from our bookstore I don't care just write it down what you took and well in that why you didn't pay for it but just take it so then I started reading the the full the full works of Jonathan Edwards if you receive you read that it's very complicated frankly half of it I had no idea what was being said I just figured if I read it again and again eventually I'll figure out what he's talking about and I've started reading Charles Spurgeon and Martin Luther and John Calvin and anything I could get my hands on I was just so hungry and I would meet with these guys and we would get together and talk with people then Armenians would come and we as Calvinists would argue against them in the school and we'd go back and forth predestination versus freewill and and one time they they invited this this guy said there's this this guy's got strange doctrine follows this man or something and but maybe we get straighten them out so we'll have them come and we'll have some fellowship and talk about the Scriptures together and I just found it so interesting because this this brother comes and he's an artist so he starts writing out starts drawing a wheat plant first he draws the the stock he says that's Luther's justification by faith then he continues drawing then there's the tassel that's sanctification from Wesley and and then there's the shock it see how it looks just like a seed but it's not a seed it's just the carrier of the seed that's the restoration of the gifts said in that though is the original seed and that's God's purpose for the Reformation is to restore us back to the original faith and I thought oh this makes more sense than anything I've heard before this this ties the Reformation together and makes it you you see the purpose of God in it it's not just a random event that produced many denominations but it's God specifically trying to restore it so that we continue to talk and he gave me different books Church ages book and gave me the anointed ones at the endtime sermon and so I put that in my car and I remember I just listened to that repeat just over and over and over again for three four or five months straight and I was just transfixed by what brother Branham was talking about I may not have understood serpent seed or other things that he was talking about but when he was speaking about predestination it was just it wasn't just a theory for brother Branham that's what I noticed wasn't just a theory of for brother Branham but it actually is a reality not just a doctrine but something real that has significance today really that really struck me and then the things that he said that Trinity is not even in the Bible so how can he say that but then I began to search through my goodness this is absolutely right it isn't in the Bible and there's no denominations in the Bible they're from the devil oh I thought how actually there's no way to even argue with that are they from God really anyone can seriously say that these are these are a godly thing so they really struck me then he started this brother started sharing with me about the church ages and the special especially he said he said read about the Laodicean church they're in Revelation chapter 3 don't you think it applies exactly to today and so I started reading and I'm like wow if this isn't exactly the hour that we're living in I don't know what is so then I started reading the church Ages book at the point at this point in time in my life when I got saved I had changed my major from business to to philosophy with a minor in theology and so my purpose was to go and to go on to seminary and to become get a at least a master's degree or if not a doctorate in theology in order to be a pastor okay so at that point in time in my life that's when I came to the message and it was just amazing how the Lord work because that I started meeting with the pastor there brother Don Hoffman he's now my father-in-law but started meeting with him and he never said okay this is what you must do it you can't do that you need to throw your shorts away you need to snot go to seminary you need he never said any of that his just approach was answer some specific questions if I had them and concurred me continue to listen to what read what the Prophet said and study what the Prophet said and you know I'd go I was ordering the tapes from from voice of God and okay here comes Satan's Eden I read that shorts go on the trash can and then you hear things about seminary okay and I but my thing that hung me up was how how do I prepare myself for ministry I should go to seminary it's still even when I was new to the message I thought I'll go to seminary because I was in taking the--how theological classes at the time and I thought they were very edifying for me because I was constantly arguing the message with my professors and students in the classes it was it was really challenging to me and so I thought wow this is really helping me grow I'll just continue it in seminary and because it'll make me dig deep and what is the everything this is what theology says about it the denomination says about it this but the message says about it and it'll help me but as time our continuing to listen I'm like Manny's really mocking these seminary graduates what should I do I remember one time asking brother Don well how do I prepare myself for ministry said well you already are why don't you just preach if you're called to preach that's what you do you go and you preach said my that's how would you do that I don't know how I don't know how to you said you pray and ask God to give you the words and then you come and bring your message you want to take Wednesday service I have to think about that but after a time I started started preaching in the church and I know everyone was very patient with me cuz it was like a theological student preaching the message very complicated big words and everyone was like what is he talking about I need a dictionary never listen to this guy but God was gracious and and worked with me through all that and the people were at the church too so if you want to go on to the next screen so as time went on I continued to minister in the church but I kind of was looking for what my calling was and not really sure what that would be as time went along I just kind of because I didn't have a real vision of what I was supposed to be doing I started getting back slid a little bit not not in the sense of going worldly but just not on fire for God anymore and so this was probably back in from the years 2006 to 2008 and I I spent a lot of time learning how to do internet marketing for network marketing businesses especially social media and Google AdWords and all those kind of things building websites and that fed into being in a not on fire for the Lord condition and I remember one time I went up to my family's cabin and I was driving there and the Lord was just really dealing with me he he spoke some things and he sent me into another city and just the whole time he just anointed me again a fresh really is what it felt felt like and the fire and the passion returned and and what he spoke to me when I went to this place was that I want you to use the the gift or the what you've learned about internet marketing for my kingdom and so from there I started recording videos teachings teaching the message started writing articles and putting it out as much as I could on on Facebook YouTube and and doing search engine optimization all that kind of stuff back at that time and so I started getting contacts from people all around the world message believers and different ones wanting to me to come and and visit them and I always had it in my mind that I wanted to help in a place where no one was helping this was just something that is fine to help in other places Africa and in South America and Mexico and that's fantastic but for me that just I was looking for something where nobody was working and so then I got a contact from a brother in Iranian brother who had left left Iran and was living in Istanbul Turkey and he invited me said we have a refugee church here please come and visit us and please help us with materials and so forth and so they they had been around the message for about 15 years they were following some different doctrines he Walt Frank doctrines over there which I didn't know initially but they had only had five messages of brother Branham translated in in that 15 years and so I got a burden to see see them get more materials in their hands and I'd never sponsored translations so I really know what to do but I just told them you know we'll figure that out on the fly but just if you have somebody that can translate get him started and will support him so that he'd be full-time doing that and so they found a brother to do that and this brother kept saying when are you coming to Turkey when you come to Turkey my initial reaction when he invited me to Turkey was it's too dangerous to go to the Middle East I'm not going there let somebody else go I'll support the translations and I'll work with him on email and chat and Skype but I'm not going to that country it's too dangerous and as time went on the Lord kept convicting my heart what are you doing why aren't you going and so I took some I was working at Wells Fargo Home Mortgage at the time this was 2011 2009 was when I got in contact with the brother so just about two years later when I surrendered to the call to go on my first missions trip to Turkey and my wife came with me she was pregnant with Mina six months pregnant and came with me to Turkey also my father-in-law brother Don Hoffman and my mother-in-law sister Mary she came with and we visited a few churches and it was very alarming and filled me with a burden for them for how little of the message that people knew they knew about brother Branham they knew that we were not Trinitarians they knew about water baptism but beyond that it was really hit or miss what they knew and what they didn't know mostly what I found out years late two years later was mostly the translations they had were of a walled Frank and so they really didn't know what the message was all about basically they had a Pentecostal church that had a little bit of message sprinkled on top on top of it so we were really burdened for that and so we really worked harder with that with the brother who was translating for us to get that over there after I got home from the trip you know I had taken like almost my full year's worth of vacation and I'm like how in the world can I continue this ministry it's February my vacation is gone I even go back yet and the Lord had a solution he said quit your job and go full-time and I was like no that's not gonna happen you know I come from the background my grandfather had the same job for 55 years my dad had the same job for 35 I think my brothers probably had the same job for 35 years so everything was about all about stability get a job staying and get a good retirement and that's it so God's telling me just forget all that you have no salary you know the churches our churches are not very big and definitely can't can't support me and so there was no promise there there's no promise from anyone else so it was a real internal struggle that went on for the next year and a half between me and the Lord and every time quit your job and go full-time but I have bills to pay let alone taking a trip there to buy a ticket and pay for everything in between I don't know how it's possible and so this this battle was raging there for a year and a half and then we came to I think the spring of 2012 and three things happen right in a row in the same week on on a Sunday afternoon we had an outreach service in a Somali area one of the young Iranian guys that was living in Minneapolis at the time got up and gave a testimony and started saying when when are when your boss at work sends you on a business trip you have total confidence that your hotels gonna be paid for your transportation is gonna be paid for and your food's all gonna be paid for he says but when God sends you so you know I'd never shared this what the Lord had been telling me with anyone besides my wife I didn't even tell my pastor because he's my father-in-law too uh-huh so I didn't tell anyone so this brother gets up and he starts saying this and the tears start coming down my face so when the look when the Lord calls you to do something you're not sure if he's gonna support your mission you where is your faith where is your confidence and so I yes that's exactly right where is my faith where is my confidence God has sent me and I'm not listening so then on Wednesday brother in our church brother Greg Schwartz was preaching I honestly have no idea what the message is about my mind was totally and completely thinking about how am I gonna do this the Lord's asking me to go full-time I don't have where am I gonna get a salary where am I gonna take care of this how is this going to work and the brother is preaching and I'm thinking well what about my family that's what I have a picture up there my family what about my family how will I provide for them and as I'm thinking about this brother Greg says and you say what about my family don't you know that God is more than able to take care of your family oh wow so then I'm thinking but what about my future I won't have insurance I won't have retirement what will I do and right there he says and you say well what about my future don't you know that the same God that can provide for your family and provide for your future also and so after the service I got on my face before the Lord I said okay I know what you're asking me to do but this seems crazy how will I do it and so we the next day a brother in the church since that sends out a quote and brother branham's talking about Joshua and so Joshua he says people looking at the outside saw Joshua could say he was reckless he was going to attack a mountain where there was giants that was reckless to the world he says but the thing of it was as soon as Joshua had the word of the Lord he could be wrecked this I remember reading it on my phone in my car and I just laughed and put it through my phone to the side and said okay it couldn't get any more clear Lord three things in a row you've told me exactly in the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established these people know nothing about what I'm going through they don't know at all what my what what God is speaking to me so I go and tell my wife and she just says well I as soon as you started working with Iranians I knew you'd be full time God will provide for us oh it's not that simple that's what my thinking was how will I do it you know as a man we like to figure things out we like to have a plan we like to have all everything the budget is perfectly worked out and then we're satisfied and so here God was saying nothing works on paper and it never will but obey me do what I've asked you to do and so that was in April and it was August before I could actually put my four week notice in so you see my faith was so strong that I put four weeks no notice and and then immediately after I was done with my work there at Wells Fargo I went on my first missions trip and the Lord is that's been since - the August 2012 the Lord has provided for us every month we've had many many struggles and difficulties and and yet at the same time we've never missed our bills we've never obviously I've never went hungry we're all we're all by God's grace he's provided because he promised has nothing to do with me has nothing to do with my ability completely it's been him because he said so and that's the thing is you know many times you get discouraged and wonder how is this going to happen how can we do this all we're in trouble now what is going to happen but every time God provides and so that's the thing it was him that called me to do it this is not my this wasn't my will it wasn't my purpose it's not even what I wanted to do but God wanted to do something and so it's been him if you want to go onto the next screen so first Peter 1 verse 1 Peter an apostle of Jesus Christ to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus Galatia Cappadocia Asia and Bithynia so a couple of those words strangers there means a resident foreigner so it's in our modern terms today we would look at it as a refugee and then where it says scattered there it's that word is porous so someone who's dispersed from their original homeland so here you have Peter he's writing to people that live in the areas of Pontus Galatia Cappadocia Asia and Bithynia and he's writing to refugees that lived there so in the first stage in the Alpha age the bride is ministering to refugees in these five areas okay so you want to go to the next screen where are these areas you see that each five of those areas is all in modern-day Turkey and so in the seventh age in the Omega age the bride is ministering the word to refugees living in Asia both in iya Cappadocia Galatia and pontus and so you just see how that the gospel is returning back to the lands you know really this area was probably the the most heavily populated Christian area in the times of the early church I think the first seven councils that the church held were all within Turkey the Council of Nicaea that was in Turkey all seven obviously all seven church there we're all in Asia Minor which is southwest Turkey so if you want to go on to the next screen from the endtime sign seed brother Branham says all your Bible readers know that what happened civilization travels from the east to the west China is the oldest civilization we have civilization began in the east its went with the Sun traveling west where's it at now the west coast if it goes any further it's back east again see what I mean and so the gospel also travels with that civilization and so we have here in brother Branham he's standing there at the West Coast the messenger to the seventh church age he's saying if any goes any further it's gonna go back east and we know that the message has gone back east again but where is it going to it has a direction that it's proceeded proceeding to and it's proceeding back to Jerusalem and so it's cut now it's back very close to Jerusalem it's back in the Middle East and the Lord is moving amongst Muslim nations if you want to go to the next screen here's a little information about Turkey it's 99% Muslim the refugees are welcome there and left alone regarding religion so this has really provided an open door for us we don't face any trouble at all really evangelizing Muslims that are refugees there a few brothers that I work with have won a few Turk Turkish people to Christ and from those people they've all had trouble with the government thankfully it's not been something that was sustained but they've been interviewed what are you doing how are you evangelizing and it all came down to we were simply answering questions that people have this is our job that's what God has called us to do we're not going around by the street to try to force people to become Christians if they come to us we answer their questions and from that answer mostly the government says ok they don't give any more problem from there actually we've experienced the government protecting us in different situations we had at one time when I was preaching some Afghans came and knocked on the door Afghan Muslims and they pulled one of the brothers out of the church and they beat him up so the pastor later went with the brother and reported it to the police and the police said well if there's an American minister with you we want to put a protective detail on him to keep him safe we said well that's not necessary they said well we'll put somebody outside of the apartment where you're staying in plain clothes you won't know who he is but someone will be there watching and making sure everything's okay for you turkey is a second world country on the verge of a first world the United States and Europe have put a ton of money into the infrastructure and businesses and so forth there you could find Starbucks Burger King McDonald's KFC Popeyes Domino's I mean any just about any restaurant that you want there so it's it's um it's easy to travel there Travel is very cheap the the dollar is very strong compared to the Turkish lira so it's also food is very cheap sometimes it just shocks you you you take five or six people out and it's less than what you had paid just for yourself at that similar restaurant in the United States it's so tourism is is huge also in Turkey you got Istanbul you've got the seven churches there you've got another eight area called Cappadocia which I think I'll show one picture of that area later is very beautiful spot and because tourism is about 30 percent of their economy they're very keen on keeping visitor safe and so we're just this is all this is the perfect storm of being able to evangelize Muslims that the Lord has just laid everything out so that we can safely go there I mean for sure there's dangers but not from the Turkish government by God's grace but everything is laid out so that we can work with Muslims and evangelize them if you go onto the next screen a few thoughts on Islam sometimes there's misunderstandings and things like that but it was introduced by Muhammad and the six hundreds the Quran actually mentions Jesus more than Muhammad it gives Jesus the title the Word of God and the Spirit of God so these are just tremendous ways that we can kind of bridge the gap between Christianity and Islam Jesus and Mary it says Jesus and Mary are the only two born without sin so even even Muslims have some Catholic doctrine as well Jesus is the virgin born Messiah and prophet but they say it's a blasphemy to cut to call him the son of God the Sunni Muslims believe that Jesus will return and set up a caliph Muslim Caliphate to rule the world so they're waiting and looking for the coming of Jesus Christ the the Shia Muslim are looking for the 12th Imam to return with Jesus so all Muslims in one way or another are looking for Jesus to rule as king of kings and Lord of lords it never says it that Mohammed did one miracle in fact it says he didn't do any but it says Jesus raised the dead healed the sick spokes speaks about him doing many miracles in in Islam women have less worth it takes for women to testify in court which would be equal to the testimony of one man four wives are allowed in Islam and you can also have temporary marriage one hour two hours two weeks one as many as you as many times as you want can divorce and remarry women can divorce and remarry anytime they want a lot of times when you're speaking evangelizing a Muslim they speak as though their religion and they are very holy it's total nonsense it's total nonsense because they're they speak that way but you have to remember that in Islam when you speak to an unbeliever it's perfectly acceptable to lie Islam is or I'll say it this way Allah is the god of sex it's really what it is it's a religion built for men to abuse women the Quran itself says no problem you could beat your wife but just not too hard because she's also your property that's the reason they use just like your cow and so this is the value that women have in Islam it's it's it's terrible if you go to the next one brother Branham says this in the Philadelphia Church age the church ancient book when afternoon is I begin to minister one of thousands of muhammadans came up on the platform as she stood before me a missionary to the Muhammadans began to softly implore the Lord o for that precious soul o for that precious soul he had been over there for years and years and according to his own testimony he had seen only one come to receive Jesus Christ as Savior they were originally the medo-persians whose laws changed not they're so hard to win it seems that once a month always a is allah amongst them that's absolutely true there's laws against conversion if they if they convert they were born as a Muslim and they or they chose to become a Muslim and they convert from Islam to Christianity it's called apostasy and they're to be stoned to death from that so that's that that is absolutely it is a law and I love this because brother Branham says that when he was over there many many of them converted and there was a was listening to the supernatural at the book on tape on the way over here on the way over to Pennsylvania last week and listening in a man in a doctor's office you know brother Branham had gotten that amoeba in South Africa and so he was in the doctor's office and one of the other doctors was kind of an atheist and in said oh how did you do over there in your meetings in South Africa I bet it you didn't get any converts from them people so yeah we got about thirty thousand he said you got what thirty thousand yeah of who not Muslims yeah there was Muslims and there was Hindus yeah absolutely the man was shocked well you must be the most intelligent man in the world then doesn't have anything to do with me they just saw the Lord Jesus Christ in action and it changed their hearts and I think today in in Iran amongst the Iranians that is actually unpressed unprecedented in the history of Islam there are when I first started and in contact with Iranians in 2009 there was like around a hundred thousand Iranian Muslims that had converted to Christianity yet that denominations whatever it just just in general Christianity and by now they're estimating that there's at least in ten of the underground church there's at least two million Muslims that have come to Christ just in the last almost ten years so it's really it's never happened in the history of Islam anywhere usually it says brother branham said there's missionaries there's been missionaries that have gone for hundreds of years into Islamic countries and they just get their whole lifetime one two three converts we see brother Branham many in South Africa thousands and thousands but other than that you usually don't see a mass conversion like this but for some reason God has chosen to work amongst the Iranians today and so amongst that there's people that are receiving the endtime message there's people that are hungry for the truth and if you want to go on to the next screen so I went over I was starting to work there I talked about there was a there was a group of message believers quote unquote message believers they were didn't really know much about the message they were following Ewald Frank so I started working with brother Nehemiah he's our Trent he's our main translator there he's he's done many translations and he also does the audio recording of translations so he started translating the message and he realized that his church was not teaching the message and so he had many discussions hours and hours about this and after my second trip right after I had gone full-time I was working with him and I told him to meet me in a certain place and we'll start working with this church there and when I got there this other church had put a block on everything they told me Nehemiah was living a sinful life and he couldn't translate for me but they'd find it maybe they'd find another translator for me and so it was a whole political move that happened when I went on my first mission missions trip and so as a result I separated from those those people and stopped working with them and basically started from scratch with brother Nehemiah he was living in Turkey doing the translations and then working on evangelizing people and starting churches there brother Petros which I'll show a picture of each of these brothers on the next screen he had just gotten out of prison around that time he had served a year in prison because of his ministry in Iran so he got out and the Lord dealt with him and said your ministry is finished in Iran moved Turkey so then he moved to Turkey he got he first he got in contact with me I said go go and live with brother Nehemiah they were at the time both single brothers so go live with him and when I come back we'll meet together and have to develop a an outreach plan and start something well brother Petros is is very ambitious and he just immediately as soon as he got to Turkey started talking to people and right away his first time he went went to another city he led a Pentecostal pastor and his wife to the message and he baptized them and then that led to being in contact with people all over the place and when I came back it wasn't just two people it was about 35 people and so I remember being after the first trip you're so discouraged you think this is how I thought it was going to go and now look what the results were instead of working with multiple churches I've got one guy and that's it this is terrible and then I come back the next time and there's 35 so it was good by God's grace so our purpose was really to work together as a team and spread the message to Iranian people living in Turkey establishing churches training ministers and kind of continuing on with this process as well as getting the message in the hands of Iranian message believers when we started there was no messages on message hub we had a website but not a lot of people knew about it not a lot of people went to it and so it was just it was it was spoon feeding them the message soon feeding them the message that the Lord dealing with us and just bringing correction as overtime you know it would be easy to go in and say okay look this is all the stuff you got messed up and here is 75 points for you this is what the message is you know you could spend you could spend two weeks and never sleep and just do that and then everybody's overwhelmed then they say oh this Jason's and know-it-all what does he think yeah but the way the Lord dealt with me to do it was just drop by drop so each time we went back it was the Lord oh this is what's the the opening of the word is that's what's on my heart let's get him to understand revelation 10 and the next time I go oh let's let's clarify some points on serpent seed let's let's clarify some things about Godhead and this is kind of how the Lord dealt with us let's go into church order the next trip and so time went on and you see the people getting more established then brother Nehemiah continued to translate and now we have like 57 messages on the message hub there and they download the app and they could search the message themselves they can put together their messages with with being able to see what the Prophet himself said instancing what did Jason say the Prophet said over here or what did what's in this one because we recorded a lot of our messages on video so that people could refer back to them but now they can study for themselves this was when we first started that was only a dream and now the dream is a reality and so if you want to go to the next screen on the Left there's brother Petros he's the he's the brother that spearheaded a lot of outreach when he when he went there he had an idea to do a Christmas service so for Muslims Christmas is very very interesting for them they think it's a big party and Americans get together and they drink and dance and have a good old time and so we use this to our advantage and through a Christmas party and so we give them food and tea and then there's music and worship and someone giving their testimony and then someone coming and and bringing the gospel to them and so they set up a service in the city of si vas in this city there hadn't been a church there for over 500 years and so they invited about 70 people 150 people showed up there to the meetings there was Turkish people but mostly Iranian that came and 17 people gave their hearts to Christ in the meeting and they baptized them there in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so that was when I came back and a church had been planted and started there a pastor had been provided by the Lord and just absolutely incredible how God did that and then the picture on the right there is myself preaching and brother Nehemiah translating but he's also a preacher and teacher as well if you go to the next screen we've done in the last six years for Persian ministers meetings where we brought the ministers together in a specific area and and worked with them I remember the very first time we had a meeting myself and brother Nehemiah and brother Petros leading the meeting and it was it was the most difficult preaching I've ever done because these people were trying to get the correct biblical church order in place they're used to having a bishop that was their church they had a bishop and he was in control of all the churches in the whole country and so they they looked at it and their South leadership was control control control and so I really had to blast that approach and get them to look at the leadership of the Holy Spirit and then we talked about holiness to the Lord because it was something that was never emphasized maybe one sister would walk in holiness and so I was preaching this in and it was just tough and as a result I think half the ministers stopped working with us but it was the best thing that ever happened to us because it really exposed the Word of God discerns the hearts it really exposed the motivation of people people that were in it for money or whatever other reasons they vanish'd the people that really had their heart to serve the Lord they continued on so we have planted four churches there in Turkey and working with small groups in three additional cities now I've done 20 trips total roughly 286 days I've spent in Turkey and you can continue to the next one it's a little hard to see but that's kind of where churches are in the red and then the blue is places where we have believers the different cities there the next one brother brother Nehemiah was from the capital city of Iran Tehran and he grew up you know his mother was the second second wife not like ex-wife ex-wife but literally his dad had three wives and his mother was a second wife she was abused when he was 16 he finally kicked his father out of the house he was strong enough to do that and he had provided for his family ever since then he had two sisters but they were he came to a place where he was kind of a agnostic and he started searching he asked his mother to find him a Bible he read the book of Mark he didn't like it at all but it was an outreach book and he just threw it aside in his home but then his mother read it and the Lord gave her a dream she sought Jesus saying I am the way the truth and the life she repented came to Christ then as then as a month later his older sister had the exam exact experience read the book had the dream gave her heart to the Lord and then the youngest sister the same another two months so nehemiah was frustrated I corrupted my family he says and I want to turn this guy that led them to Christ into the into the government so they said do you want to meet with them yes I do and he went and he listened to the guy tell about serpent seed and the gospel and he said this is the most logical thing I ever heard in my life and but said he was resistant again against it over time he at the end of this the pastor told him said pray God can speak to you ask him to reveal himself and so he was one time he was he was praying and hear a voice say it's hard for you to kick against the goads he thought what in the world does that mean he'd never read that before he didn't even have the book of X so he called the minister and they met and he just opened in the scripture and said this is where it is the book of Acts means you're resisting God is calling you and you're resisting him and he broke down in tears and gave his heart to the Lord and he grew he grew up he had just a love for anything American so he listened to and he was a worldly kid so after after he was fanatic Muslim he kept me agnostic then he gave his life to watching American movies and listening to American rock-and-roll and rap music as a result he learned English very very well so I think about how God works it's just amazing so now he comes to the message and just for his own pleasure he starts translating brother Branham into Farsi then he shows it to his pastor and he says who did this well I did it this is really good you you have a gift start translating this was the same time I was asking the brother do you have a translator that could help us because we need to get the message into people's hands he was like well I'll talk to them some of the brothers inside the country yes actually there's one he's just starting so he started translating and not long after that he got arrested he was put in prison they they tortured him then he got out on bail and he ended up we talked to him and said would you pray about moving to Turkey you get that way you can be safe and you can translate full time you don't have to worry about someone you going to prison so he prayed and he decided that he would go to Turkey and so that was where that that was who met us at the airport on our first trip with my wife and father and mother-in-law in 2011 and so we've been really close friends ever since then you want to go on to the next one kind of covered this already but we have 34 voiceover audio translations in addition to the 57 trends translations we have in printed format and so it's a that has been tremendous because people are very very busy especially in Turkey they work they they're not allowed to work legally so they work illegally and they end up working 14 16 hour days and so the only way they really can listen to the message is by put feet on the messages by putting in their earphones while they're at work and listening and so it's just been a tremendous tremendous blessing sisters while they're doing their housework they're listening to the message so it's been awesome going to the next one just March of this year that Church ages book has been translated another one that was just a dream nine years ago you know it's a reality and so we're so thankful for that that's also on the message hub going to the next one and this has been a tremendous help the supernatural series has been translated actually I have almost completed I just got the email on on yesterday that book six is completed so it's all done just book five and six need to get printed and put into the hands of the people but it's just that has been tremendous to show the strength of vindication in the life of brother Branham it's really shown the people that reality and given them a balance before all they got was what other people told them what their preachers told them and so a lot of times they would use things from brother branham's life to manipulate and control them well they can't do that anymore because now they now that now from beginning to end it's all there in the supernatural series if you go onto the next one and we're gonna skip that go to the next sorry so this is a couple in their 70s that we met with several years ago brother Nehemiah and I had been visiting people in their homes all day long and this couple wanted to beat us and was coming was calling us constantly when can you come when you come finally it was one o'clock when we were done with the last people on our list and they were next and so we finally called they they had called an hour earlier so we called them and said sorry it's so late we'll just meet you tomorrow and they said no no no we want to we don't we're not gonna go to the bed until we hear the gospel and so we went there and Nehemiah and I shared the time and spoke to them about the plan of salvation about serpent seed why it had to be blood and then and brought them the gospel and they said do you have any questions and they came and got on their knees and said we want to repent and receive Jesus Christ and so we got down on our knees with them as well and and prayed with them and they received Christ and then their very first question that they asked after that was when we go back to Iran will we be killed right away and I was so shocked at this because they didn't ask it before receiving Christ they didn't count the cost beforehand they said I would want to receive Christ now that we've received Christ's will this happen well we said no of course not as they're mostly looking for ministers but just pray and use wisdom and be a witness as the Holy Spirit leads you and so they were brother Petros and brother Nehemiah returned after that a few days later and baptize them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so we don't know anything what's happened to him that we know they were there back in Iran living there and that's it but I know that God's hand is in their life amen next screen it's a few of our churches there on the right one is the top one is there in the city of Deniz Lee so Deniz Lee is actually the replacement city for Laodicea Laodicea was restore destroyed by earthquake four different times finally after the fourth time they said this is probably not the greatest place to have a city let's move it further down the river so they moved it further down the river and they changed the name to the city of Deniz Lee it actually Deniz Lee means Laodicea on the lake so if you're wondering there is a message Church in the city of Laodicea amen sometimes we wonder if some churches are in Laodicea and maybe they are but there's literally a Church in Laodicea and then the other the other church there on the bottom is in the city of Sivas Turkey has more in in central Turkey next screen this is a group of ministers at our ministers meeting I think in 2016 that we had in the city of Esparta and this was a year after we had a ministers meeting that was so difficult and this was a very very good one because it was just filled with people eager and desirous to feed on the Word of God next one brother Petros performing some baptisms there in in Turkey next and this is a lot of what we do you see there brother Petros is preaching to the people answering questions in their home we really spend a lot of time doing that going into people's homes and teaching them and answering their questions and as a tremendous impact there there he is at the bottom one he's introducing the the church ages to the church there in the city of Adana go to the next one again brother Petros ministering there different cities throughout Turkey also on that bottom one he's actually in the city in Germany in Hamburg he was a refugee as well and so they directed him to live in Germany so he started a church there in Hampi Iranian church there in Hamburg Germany and then he travels back every few months for a week two weeks three weeks to Turkey to minister to the churches and do outreach there on to the next one it's brother cave on whether cave on is a tremendous evangelist he when he was living in in in Iran for about thirteen years he was a Christian there and he said he led about a thousand people to Christ personally in Iran so he came he came to a one of our ministers meetings while he was still living in Iran he left the country and flew to the minister's meeting and when he got back there they knew that he was in the minister's meeting even though he didn't publish it we put nothing on online about him they knew he was there and that was the beginning of his persecution you can actually I don't know if you mentioned the book but there's a book I wrote called Persia unveiled I think I think the the the DVD or the the video was sent out before but there's also a book and it goes into details about people's testimonies and so this brother Kavon is one of them and he he started under persecution got arrested after that eventually desired to leave leave Iran and went to Turkey and he went and started a church from scratch in the city of Esparta and this is a baptismal on the top one he baptized forty five people in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and just a tremendous job of evangelizing people you'd never think he was because he's so quiet when you get together with him he barely talks but when it comes to evangelizing he's just he knows how to do it next one this is brother Shahin he he has been in the message for twenty years quote unquote the message for twenty years he moved in 2014 to Turkey after he'd been arrested several times in Iran he and his family did first time we met him we spent hours and hours and hours speaking just about the basics of the message at the end of it he said in this one day I learned more about the message than I did in all twenty years that I've been in the message inside of Iran so he knew just so-so very little and now today he's a tremendous teacher of the message he's really learned it very well the brothers have started brother Shahin or the nehemiah brother Petros and and the next brother that I'll talk about brother Omid have done a great job they've started a Facebook live video that they do on a consistent basis they started out by just doing short five-minute clips talking about just simple simple doctrines of the message and then building that and then they started doing 30-minute videos every day and so it was kind of the purpose was to get almost every subject of the message spoken of just in a basic basis and then put on to a website so that people could go and buy subject look up everything and so they they've done that and this has had a tremendous impact because it's going into people in Iran people inside of Iran are getting a hold of these videos and they're leaving that other message denominational group and they're following the truth people are requesting books and things it's very difficult to get books inside there we just say go to the message hub get those print them if you can oh go to go to our website listen to the audio and brother Shahin has been a tremendous part of doing that and actually he's come down to he's kind of the main one that will do the videos on a weekly basis and actually he's gonna be our voice recording the supernatural series so he's just reading it off so that will people will have that in audio format you want to go into the next one brother Omid is baptizing people in Lake Vaughn this is like 40 minutes from the Iranian border so way way far east Turkey and he's done a tremendous job with evangelism but he also does he's the one that edits all those videos and he does graphic design web design and now the Holy Spirit is leading him to move to another city to work and do outreach and establish a church in that new city so one to the next one brother only administering there and that top right one is one brother Nehemiah and I laid hands on him and ordained him as a as a minister there next just some more pictures of services and praying over people that wanted to come to Christ next one we had a mystery Expo in the city of a Sparta that's where the Kavon is the pastor and all in all to all the meetings we had I think we had six services and about a hundred and fifty people total came to all of them you want to go to the next one brother Omid translated for me it's interesting we we'd always use brother brother Nehemiah as a translator and we were always praying for a new translator well on this trip brother Nehemiah was supposed to meet me there but he didn't get his visa in time and so here I was there without a translator and brother Omid was like why I know English pretty well I could translate for you just we have to meet and discuss what you're preaching about but I'll translate so he started I was so nervous using a different translator but it he did a pretty good job and and since then he's really improved his English and now he can translate very very well and does a great job so the Lord really forced our hand into using a different translator and it's been a blessing ever since then so if you go onto the next one as a result of the meetings there was 14 people that wanted to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that picture in the upper right corner it's interesting in the Sunday morning service before the service start a woman came in from the Assemblies of God Church in the in the town and she comes and meets the brothers at the back desk and saw it there was we had books of brother Branham and a few pictures of him and she said where where is that man and they said oh he's passed away many years ago but that's God's prophet he said no no when I came in the building he used the one that greeted me they said it looks Junger than that but that's that's who greeted me when I came in and so he were shocked and so I made her tell me that testimony again and just to us it was such a vindication that the endtime essage was coming to that city amen and so she she immediately went and took all the books that she could and even started reading them while the service was going on because she was so excited if you want to go into the next one I think you press it again you'll see a video come up start you hit a spacebar I think if not that's alright yeah we'll just go on to the next one this was from our ministers meeting in 2018 in in May so we had some ministers from a few other churches come and sit with us and they they very much enjoyed the ministry of the word and they received the word though there there some several of them are in a condition where they're afraid to leave their denomination or their church and so they're just in the process of gathering up strengths and we pray pray for them and hope the Lord delivers them from their denomination didn't get out of that one to the next one it's another visit we had and in this home with these believers it's just a very interesting format it took on because we went and said do you have any questions and usually when you do that to started the blue people like well yeah we do but they're afraid to ask them so Shahin was there sitting next to me and we asked and they were quiet and then brother shining just started asking me that well here's the questions I think they would ask you and so she's wearing earrings and he says brother Jason is there anything in the message or the Bible about earrings and I was just like oh is this how we're gonna do that and so I just started speaking about what the scripture says referring that's opening our Bible here this is what the Prophet says oh wow I didn't know it they were very thankful what about cutting the hair what is there anything can we trim the hair is that okay so Shahin is just doing this whole question-and-answer thing just basically I want you to teach these people this okay that's pretty much what it was but it ended up working very well they received it very well and really rejoiced in it so go ahead and go on to the next one this is preaching in the city of Esparta brother Kevin has gone through the process a few different times where we've spoken to him and said you got to introduce them to the message right away he wants to get them to the ABCs which I understand and just go on the very basic things for six months seven months but then he goes through that process he gets to the end and now he starts talking about a profit and the people are like I don't know if I wanted to get into this what is this all about and then three quarters of the church leaves and then he does outreach again and he keeps going through this process finally on this last trip I said where the Kavon we've been after you for this don't you see exactly what happening is what we warned you was going to happen because we learned the hard way ourselves jut you've got to just be open with people right away about the message get them to the basic things of why we're not Trinitarians why how what we believe about the Godhead teach them about the church ages just go right into it yes of course we need to go through the ABCs with them as well but you can't put the message off six seven eight months because the people just walk away so finally it was revealed for him this time and so he's he's now been teaching on the message and holiness and now he's going into a long series about why the Trinity is false and the truth of the Godhead and just really doing a tremendous job there and the people have received it they're not running away this time so we thank the Lord for that but on this trip I went into those people that had been new I the message I have called what is the message it's just a overview introduction of the message and they loved it they really received it well next screen I can't say the name of the country that this is in because it's being streamed it'll be online but another country in the Middle East the door is opened and we're starting to work with them they speak the Arabic language and the Lord has provided a translator we've got eight chapter nine chapters of the church Aegis book translated and there's someone that's helping us with editing and getting those uploaded to the message hub as well and we we went there this was my first trip there in August and introduced the message to them and they really were rejoicing in it seven people basically all the adults that hadn't been rebaptised got rebaptised as a result of the meetings I was there with brother Marcus Becker from Germany as well and he ministers also go to the next screen see Egyptian brother that's living in Germany was there with us he speaks Arabic well and he he was baptizing the people one of the next one I said we're working on translating and then we hope to get it printed hopefully in the springtime and in Arabic we're translating some outreach tracks as well and we've got to go and it's just like the beginning of working with the Iranians we got a spoon feed them the message because they don't have access to very much of it if you go to the next one and we'll continue to work on the translations in both languages continue to work with the pastors and the mission team in each of these countries we those pastors are also refugees finances are very difficult for them so we with by God's grace and with his help we help support them and then as they feel lad they'll take missions trips and as we're able to we help them with those trips we pay for some of their church rent typically there it's it's really tough to find an actual there's no church buildings really so for there we have to rent an apartment and kind of turn it turn its living room into a church and bedroom into an office and that kind of thing and we do outreach there and we'll probably start doing more outreach in in the other Arabic country as well so if you'd keep us in prayer we'd appreciate I think that's the greatest thing that we need this is a this is a spiritual warfare that we're facing we're going into a place that the devil has a strong and I think you know I can say every time I go Satan is just battling you wonder why am I doing this you start it's just a battle in the mind that begins to take place you see you know you step back and you see how God has worked but when you're in the middle of it you know you feel beaten down then when I went to the new country the first time I got there and so we got there in the middle of the night then they wanted to take us to show us some seats scenic spots in the country and it was like 7:00 in the morning so I got two hours of sleep and we come back after that it was so unbelievably hot and I've been sweating since I arrived in the country I remember thinking I just want to go home I texted my wife I'm gonna book a ticket I'm just I'm just coming home I can't do this anymore she's like just just pray did you pray about that like brother branham's wife would tell him do you pray about that no I don't want to pray about it because I just want to come home she said I want you'd get a little sleep and pray and you'll be all right and so you know it's a spiritual battle that we're facing and I really need you to hold my arms up please do that and if musicians if you'd come you know you can close out the PowerPoint there the Lord is working we want to go home right but we got to find that last predestinated seed and I believe there's this message has to be preached in all nations so then the end will come and so we've got some nations that we've got to reach to especially in the Middle East and many other places as well but Lord send laborers into the field what our prayer is and I love that earlier in the service that brother said we need to pray for lost souls because that I mean really if you look at the way immigration and and so forth works the world is coming to America well that's it's put on hold with the new president but even so the world has come here we have a tremendous opportunity for outreach amongst nations that you can't go to but they're here think about that for a minute we can reach Muslims here that we could never even go to their country we'd be killed right away to do it and the same thing for myself going to Iran I I've never been to Iran I couldn't go to Iran they there I'm on their lists they've interrogated people they've they've tortured people to find out information about me it would be impossible for me to go but the message still is going anyways why because there's people that are being forced out of the country into a country I can go to and then through that it's going back to their family members it's it's going through the internet to people that we could never reach which is tremendous you know we as all the things that we would have to warn ourselves and others about social media and yet there's a tremendous means of bringing the gospel to places that you personally couldn't go amen so let's pray father we just delight in you than what you've done in this age and Lord because of that we just have a passion to see this message spread far and wide give us boldness and confidence we know this is a scriptural message we know that there's seed out there that need to hear it so lord give us give us a thick skin tender hearts but thick skin Lord because the the devil is like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour and when anytime we want to do something for you Lord the devil raises up to try to discourage us from that help us to get a real vision of what you've called us to do how you've called us to reach out because that's the thing Lord is there's a kingdom that you want to spread throughout the whole world Satan also wants to spread his kingdom throughout whole world and he's doing everything he can to put us to sleep to bring us to this place where we don't share our faith but lord let us rise above that and be Kingdom builders not our own Kingdom but the kingdom of Jesus Christ the word Lord we ask that you would in everything go before us we ask that you would speak to each one here even in a new way Lord in a way you've never had before and deal with us in a way you never have before set our hearts on fire for this word we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ amen can we just worship the Lord let's stand up and saying I love you lord [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh my [Music] by [Music] in one [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Allegiance [Music] Oh with [Music] just to [Music] [Music] my to ah Jew the and I have heard how Christians long we're before a time and snow they were told would spare [Music] the Son of God they will not like a great your seats I can almost there and I [Music] all my stress with all [Music] is command literally [Music] and now the years have come the years have gone and the cause of Jesus goes home now our time has come to retain this world sure we brain [Music] sly to the trumpet sounds Oh let us proudly stand [Music] [Applause] yes commander [Music] enjoy that tonight and encouraged challenged edified amen amen more to pray about amen you know it's just so much that in every one of your lives our lives as believers you know there's everything how God just so orchestrates everything and to see how God brings everything together it's his working and I know that sometimes seems like we're statement we make so regularly - oh yeah it's God's working but God allows us to see things even in the smallest of details just that brother Jason pointed out tonight when you take for example what Satan intended I believe for brother nehemiah's life getting him all wrapped up in that American culture and all those are the things like that but when he said that I also thought of what brother Bryan said in the earlier part during the prayer request God has Satan's number you see the government raised paid for Moses are you with me he was right there in Pharaoh's house so that's nothing new with there on and on we could go with that but you see with everything what the enemy meant for evil God said I'm gonna take that because I already know all of this and how that's all gonna work according to my plan and my purpose and all my what words of life and really he was caught up in Psalms he has been ordained by God to write this new song translate this new song this song of redemption the finishing up of the mystery of God oh my catching that the transitions and they octaves and I tell you God is so good he's so good you think about him brother branham's life even you know brother Branham when he went fishing up there in in Michigan right there in the top part of Indiana you know brother branham just decided to take a turn and he was gonna go home a different way and so when brother Brennan went home a different way he came across this sign in a town that talked about a meeting and he seen these two men brother Brennan would have never went that way and what he thought he was just going to take a scenic route home it was in line with God's plan for his life but the Brennan goes on to tell us in Israel in the church part five brother Bram talks about this man you know I thought about this year and I just I got beside myself the other day praying I thought about this black man that's all we know him as a black man with a rim around his his head I don't know his name but on the other side I said Lord I'm gonna meet that man I'm gonna meet that man that stood there in that convention and brother Bram says it was that man these big exact words brother brems says he said it was that man he said that I seen the Holy Ghost manifesting and I knew there's something that I was missing in my life and that's what it was see it's what was manifesting he had the Bible he had been reading that he knew that but now see God had a way of manifesting all if that in itself don't grip a hold of our lives what God's desire is that this the real gospel is a manifestation it's looking for lives to be lived may God help us amen may God help us like Ray have been this hour we are in a closing moment and we look at it you know and and what God is how God is using brother Jason over there and the other brothers and moving around it's it's the Lord how God is doing it you even hear the part of it that I think was I'm glad that brother Jason shared that part that you look at it and you see what you see on the slides but to see the battles that goes on it's not something of a vacation it's not something that he wants to do as far as it's just something you just want to do but it's a burden you cannot get away from and that's the way it is within any gift and any calling it's a burden it's not something you want to do it's a burden you can away from her and to see that part the human they had part of it and how the enemy would come and attack you know this is where that we are so lift one another up in prayer and to know that within it all its God it's God God is achieving what would look like to be impossible to think about that I I just amazed there in that part where when brother Jason read that in 1st Peter chapter 1 verse 1 and to see the gospel going right back into that same area oh my I say it to God be the glory you know I don't here's the thing you we hear these things and even as brother Branham mentioned that about harder to a hard to Windham when a Muslim but you know what in winning soul for Christ is not about how much knowledge or can you outdo them in your thinking can you bring to a reality the grace of God that they can be free if that can touch their life that this one who made the way that I can be free and when that's made real they can walk free no matter what it is I tell you it's just it's it's wonderful to see what God is doing isn't it and you think those need to apply this here within our lives in our hearts there might be areas and parts in your life where God is dealing with and just remember there's no area that is off-limits to God there is nothing within any family or whatever more that God cannot reach and that His grace is not sufficient to overthrow it he is faithful don't you love him Amen let's just I tell you what even on the Tuesday prayer meetings we want to make sure we keep and also not just in Tuesday's but and other times keeping brother Jason and the brothers of Prayer if you haven't seen the video we sent out by a link there do that as well brother richard has the books back

the whole the whole work that the Lord is doing there Amen up before the throne of God Amen oh what a wonderful time we're living in what a wonderful hour that we're living in in this time as we bow our heads to the Lord Jesus most gracious Heavenly Father I know many times Lord has that been upon my knees and I prayed for those that I do not know I remembered Lord's thinking that there in some type of a prison a spiritual prison and I uttered those words set the captives free Lords set them free that they might be able to come to the knowledge of Jesus Christ because without you Lord all of us would be lost it's only were here by the grace your grace Lord not only in Turkey in Iran Lord we remember those Lord throughout the world no matter where they might be I think about them sometimes they might be in a jungle somewhere I've heard of ministries going back into the jungles of Guyana and back in there there was a village and the minister there woke up very early in the morning four or five o'clock in the morning and heard a low noise there in the camp or in the village he was asking what is this sound that I'm hearing says oh brother that's the people waking up in the morning to pray [Music] Lord in such remote places and we've heard today Lord about what's taking place in Turkey and Iran bless them Lord Jesus may the power of Jesus Christ come into their hearts make they come to know you as the mighty conqueror as you were talking to us last night Lord this message was not just for one man brother branham this message is for each one of us individually Lord that we might come to know you in a greater way [Music] so we ask that you continue to bless our brother Jason keep him on the road as he travels the many souls for the cut for the kingdom of God bless those ministries that are there guide them give them wisdom Lord the devil is finding it's a war when those seals were opened up brother Brett him and said those seals were broken there was a declaration of war that was declared and I do believe Lord were in a battle but we've read the end of the book we've already wondered that that little elect lady she's going to come through she's going to stand and your glory and your brightness Lord we praise your holy manias thank you for your presence your Lord continue to bless this assembly bless our the pastor here may your will be done in all of our hearts and lives we commit ourselves into your hands the wonderful lovely precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen in Bristol god bless you you're dismissed in the name of the
