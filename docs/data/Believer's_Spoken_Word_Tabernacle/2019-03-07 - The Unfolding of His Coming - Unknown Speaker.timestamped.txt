[38:35] and I will give power unto my two
[38:40] witnesses and they shall prophesy a
[38:44] thousand two hundred and threescore days
[38:48] clothed in sackcloth these are the two
[38:52] olive trees and the two candlesticks
[38:54] standing before the god of the earth and
[38:58] if any man will hurt them fire
[39:00] proceedeth out of their mouth and
[39:02] devoureth or enemies and if any man will
[39:05] hurt them he must in this manner be
[39:08] killed these have power to shut heaven
[39:11] and it rain not in the days of their
[39:14] prophecy and have power over waters to
[39:17] turn them to blood and to smite the
[39:20] earth with all plagues as often as they
[39:24] will
[39:25] amen may God bless you bless the reading
[39:27] of his word as you're being seated I
[39:30] would also like us if we could turn to
[39:33] revelation 6 and we want to look in
[39:37] Revelation 6 at verse 12
[39:45] and I beheld when he had opened the
[39:50] sixth seal and lo there was a great
[39:53] earthquake and the Sun became black as
[39:56] sackcloth of hair and the moon became as
[39:59] blood and the stars of heaven fell unto
[40:01] the earth even as a fig tree casteth her
[40:06] untimely figs when she is taken of a
[40:10] mighty wind I realized tonight I haven't
[40:14] read all of the scriptures tonight that
[40:18] would go and pertain here in revelations
[40:21] 11 in the unfolding of the Ministry of
[40:26] the two witnesses the two olive trees
[40:28] those that God has reserved the two
[40:32] prophets to minister there and bring
[40:36] forth the Feast of Trumpets and call
[40:39] Israel to the the true atonement and
[40:42] make make them ready as a people that he
[40:47] would step forth and make himself known
[40:50] and is in a physical coming to them but
[40:54] I want to draw if we could tonight upon
[40:58] a few points here within this this
[41:01] scripture because when we when we look
[41:05] at it here in the scriptures we we
[41:09] recognize that this of the sixth seal
[41:12] it's a breaking fourth of tribulation
[41:14] but it's a Ministry of the two witnesses
[41:18] to that of Israel it's the time to
[41:20] Israel that of the Gentiles days that's
[41:23] that's finished yet there will be those
[41:27] out of the Gentiles who did not receive
[41:30] the Holy Ghost that you know they will
[41:32] be part as it mentions in Revelations 12
[41:35] they will be hunted down for the for the
[41:38] testimony that they would hold and you
[41:41] know they would be purged through that
[41:43] time but right now as the bride of Jesus
[41:46] Christ this is where by God's grace that
[41:49] we receive our purging right now through
[41:53] him by the blood of the Lamb were made
[41:55] ready the revelation of Jesus Christ
[41:57] breaks for
[41:58] upon our life the spirit of atonement
[42:01] the holy spirit the token life comes to
[42:04] seal us and baptize us into that body of
[42:08] Jesus Christ and when we look here upon
[42:12] this in this part of it I I want to go
[42:16] into tonight in just to pause a moment
[42:19] here what we're looking at with Israel
[42:21] because you see when we look upon all of
[42:26] these things what God is preparing to do
[42:29] with Israel in just that of as the
[42:32] Scriptures would say that of a day you
[42:35] find that God himself has been doing
[42:37] this work for the Gentiles gathering a
[42:41] people out of the Gentiles for his
[42:43] namesake
[42:44] and making us ready for his literal
[42:47] corporal coming and Israel these two
[42:50] prophets cannot step on the scene under
[42:54] that anointing of the Holy Spirit the
[42:56] power of God as the scripture says in
[42:58] verse three I will give power unto my
[43:01] two witnesses they they cannot step on
[43:04] the scene until the bride is taken our
[43:06] home so we realized that everything
[43:09] itself even to where the Prophet would
[43:12] make the statement in recognizing your
[43:14] day and its message and he would say at
[43:17] that time I cannot see anything left but
[43:20] for the going home of the bride and then
[43:22] the stepping forth of the two witnesses
[43:24] there to call out the 144,000 and I want
[43:29] to draw upon this part here in this look
[43:31] at the thought on the unfolding of his
[43:34] coming and when we think of the
[43:36] unfolding of his coming you look here in
[43:39] the scripture and we see from that of
[43:42] verse three in revelations eleven I will
[43:45] give power unto my two witnesses and
[43:48] then you notice in there in verse 12 of
[43:51] Revelation six and I beheld when he had
[43:54] opened the sixth seal and brother
[43:56] Branham lays lays it out without me
[43:58] reading word-for-word and going through
[44:01] it but this the sixth seal itself is
[44:04] opened by the ministry of these two
[44:07] prophets so it's the power of God that
[44:10] is released
[44:11] as the scripture said the power of God
[44:13] the quickening power of God that is
[44:15] released that then through the Ministry
[44:19] of the two witnesses that the hundred
[44:21] and forty-four thousand they themselves
[44:24] come in to repentance and they are
[44:26] sealed and made ready for the coming of
[44:29] the Lord
[44:30] so in when we look at this the power
[44:33] that is given and this is what I want to
[44:35] draw our attention to as brother brems
[44:37] says they're given power on miheer of
[44:42] God of the word of God to condemn nature
[44:45] nature itself is interrupted as the
[44:48] Scripture speaks of this and I I want
[44:50] you to think of it in this term that
[44:52] when we look at this the whole part of
[44:56] it that when we think of these two
[44:58] witnesses here the two prophets of Moses
[45:01] and Elijah as they receive the power to
[45:05] open the sixth seal which it's a
[45:07] Ministry of the Feast of the trumpets
[45:10] which is a gathering it's a gathering
[45:12] there of the Jews and it this is the
[45:15] same thing what takes place is prepared
[45:19] to take place there with the sixth
[45:20] trumpet to the Jews is the same thing
[45:24] that takes place here with the seventh
[45:26] seal for us as the bride of Jesus Christ
[45:29] and I don't want it so much
[45:32] that you're our thoughts would be caught
[45:35] within terms but I want us to truly to
[45:38] understand that as God has ordained that
[45:41] the sixth seal itself here is power
[45:44] released to the two witnesses who are
[45:46] present to open that sixth seal there to
[45:50] the Jews likewise God himself but
[45:53] promise of his word had a seventh angel
[45:56] messenger on earth that he could release
[45:59] the power in order to bring and open
[46:03] their and unfold the mystery of the
[46:05] coming of the Lord
[46:06] and you see that within that because
[46:09] within this word there is power there is
[46:12] glory that is sealed within it and when
[46:15] it is just written letter in in it in
[46:18] itself is glory but when it is opened
[46:21] then the very power and the
[46:23] that is contained within it is is meant
[46:26] to be opened and there's a people on the
[46:29] earth in whom and that word is open the
[46:32] power of God is poured out in an
[46:35] anointing upon our lives and it anoints
[46:37] us for what God is calling for and that
[46:40] is the rapture of the Church of the
[46:43] Living God
[46:44] because down through the ages now the
[46:47] Holy Spirit has went down through the
[46:49] Gentile ages and he's been calling a
[46:51] people for his name's sake he's been
[46:54] gathering them and they they are those
[46:56] who are born of his spirit and remember
[46:59] there's many that have been laid to
[47:01] sleep down through every age and they
[47:03] have been waiting for the coming of the
[47:05] Lord they have looked with an
[47:07] anticipation for his coming even as Paul
[47:10] would write Paul believed that he would
[47:13] see it even within his day and to think
[47:16] of how that this is made known within
[47:18] this hour that even the very mystery of
[47:21] his coming in itself is a secret it's a
[47:24] secret that the enemy himself cannot pry
[47:27] into though we look at it and we can
[47:30] hear it as far as a word that is gone
[47:32] forth a word that is ministered but the
[47:35] secret that lays within it is that
[47:37] mystery of where Christ himself comes
[47:40] into the life in that token that reality
[47:43] of the new birth and it makes it real to
[47:46] you and I that we are a part of his
[47:49] coming we are a part and the reason of
[47:52] his coming his first coming that he
[47:54] might make us ready then for his second
[47:58] coming so when we think of this but
[48:01] because when you look at it here the
[48:03] seventh angel now listen now those two
[48:05] witnesses they do not have power in
[48:07] themselves the scripture said they were
[48:10] given power you see they had here they
[48:12] are there is power that is to be
[48:14] released and ordained that they
[48:16] themselves can begin to open that sixth
[48:19] seal there then it's the same way with
[48:21] the seventh angel being the seventh star
[48:24] in the right hand of God and the right
[48:26] hand being that of power and authority
[48:28] there is power that is released by
[48:31] Almighty God as the Prophet would say in
[48:34] the eastern sea in the Easter
[48:36] he says the opening of these seals is
[48:39] the releasing of the quickening power to
[48:42] the Church of the Living God to make us
[48:45] ready and he said it depends on your
[48:47] attitude toward it whether or not it
[48:50] will have any effect or do you any good
[48:53] and we want to have the right attitude
[48:56] toward the quickening power of God and
[48:59] to recognize that when you think of it
[49:01] here you know when you look at it just a
[49:04] moment here here they are they will
[49:06] stand even in that time receiving a
[49:08] power to open that sixth seal and God
[49:11] within this hour he has anointed that
[49:13] seventh angel messenger there with the
[49:16] quickening power and notice friends it
[49:19] did not stay there with a seventh angel
[49:21] messenger but remember here the Bible
[49:24] says in Revelations 10 verse 8 through
[49:27] 11 it says go and take the little book
[49:30] that is open in the hand of the angel
[49:32] that standeth on the land and the sea so
[49:36] to recognize this power that has come to
[49:40] open the word for you and I to tie
[49:43] together the entire Bible and release
[49:47] the power of God within that word that
[49:49] makes a people ready for the coming of
[49:52] the Lord because the Lord Jesus himself
[49:54] he said when I return will I find faith
[50:00] that was the question when I return will
[50:03] I find faith so there is a people if God
[50:06] is doing this as he will to the to those
[50:10] of the 144,000 they've got to be
[50:13] gathered together it's got to be their
[50:15] time the power is released to open that
[50:17] seal and their understanding will come
[50:20] and they will come to recognize him as
[50:23] the true atonement then what about that
[50:25] of the opening of the Seventh Seal where
[50:28] the power of God moves down and there's
[50:30] a people on earth that are actually
[50:33] caught in that revelation of the mystery
[50:36] of his going there's got to be a
[50:40] breaking forth and it is that power that
[50:43] makes you and I Oh Evan brother sister
[50:46] it's not just a power
[50:47] of something of knowledge no sir this is
[50:50] a power that is poured out upon the sons
[50:54] and daughters of God it's not just that
[50:56] of the little portion this is the very
[50:58] fullness of Christ himself it is that
[51:02] which is made way for the very person of
[51:05] Jesus Christ to step forth why because
[51:07] he's been making up his body down
[51:10] through the ages little by little he
[51:13] said upon this rock I will build my
[51:15] church and the gates of Hell shall not
[51:19] prevail against it he's been building
[51:22] his church by himself he's used his used
[51:28] vessels but it's him he gave power to
[51:32] them
[51:33] do you realize who gave power to Peter
[51:36] to preach on the day of pinnacles he did
[51:40] he released power that makes it come
[51:43] into that word and then that word that
[51:46] promise now the power in blessing and
[51:49] glory and honor in that word is poured
[51:53] out upon the people of God and we are
[51:55] not Outsiders but we are brought into
[51:58] him so to think here that this this
[52:02] reality I'll tell you like this if the
[52:05] sixth seal as it says they have power to
[52:07] interrupt nature let me tell you
[52:09] something this reality of the unfolding
[52:13] of the coming of the Lord let me tell
[52:15] you something this word has went forth
[52:18] to interrupt nature in our lives but let
[52:22] me tell you something there is gonna
[52:23] there is an interaction that takes place
[52:26] by the change of the new birth amen and
[52:31] we also are going to be we are part of
[52:34] this to be changed in a moment and at
[52:37] weakling laughs look be to God
[52:41] to be able to to pass from death unto
[52:45] life now think of how brother branham
[52:48] brings it like this in the message
[52:50] contest
[52:52] and he says Lord make us fit servants
[52:56] forgive our past bless our future guide
[53:01] us Oh Lord God with our mighty hand
[53:04] Jehovah blessed these ministers here
[53:07] bless all the laity and all the visitors
[53:09] be thou with us Lord we are your
[53:13] servants and we give ourselves wholly to
[53:16] you for 1963 but the power of your
[53:20] spirit might have more preeminence 'as
[53:22] in our life in an hour be help us God
[53:26] forgive us and help us we pray raise up
[53:29] mighty men raise up mighty warriors of
[53:33] the faith open this year Lord that
[53:37] hidden manna that rocked beneath the
[53:40] rock that we might see the program of
[53:43] God amen the program of God that we
[53:48] might see God's program and tap off the
[53:52] pyramids of our life Lord put the
[53:54] capstone Christ Jesus upon each and
[53:57] every one of us and may his magnificent
[54:00] holy blessings be upon us all may the
[54:02] power of the Holy Ghost come upon us may
[54:05] the power of the resurrection be
[54:06] manifested God how we thank you tonight
[54:09] we are yours and we give ourselves fully
[54:11] to you Lord now when we look here in in
[54:16] the Bible it says in Revelations 8 verse
[54:18] 1 and when he had opened the Seventh
[54:21] Seal There was silence in heaven about
[54:23] the space of half an hour now we realize
[54:28] that down through the ages remember he
[54:33] made a promise that if I go away I will
[54:36] come again and I will receive you unto
[54:40] myself that where I am you may be also
[54:46] so he has made a promise here that he
[54:51] was going to return and to think that
[54:55] how that the ages this has been the
[54:58] longing of the Church of the Living God
[55:01] down through time now remember here in
[55:03] the coming of the Lord
[55:05] even when Jesus was standing there and I
[55:08] speaks I believe it's there in John
[55:10] chapter 20 when he speaks to John the
[55:13] Beloved the disciple says what is it to
[55:15] thee if he tarry till I come
[55:17] and here the Lord Jesus remember the
[55:20] Bible says many that went about a saying
[55:23] you know that he was this disciple was
[55:25] not going to die until the Lord come but
[55:28] you see there was a hidden mystery even
[55:30] within that but here John himself would
[55:33] be set aside into the Isle of Patmos now
[55:36] this was a test this was a trial but you
[55:39] see in the midst of that time right
[55:41] there how that God was able to make
[55:44] himself known to John I believe if all
[55:46] my smell I believe with all my heart
[55:48] God gave sufficient grace for John to be
[55:51] available for God to speak to him what
[55:54] does that say to you and I in the midst
[55:56] of our tests and our trials they don't
[55:58] give me sufficient grace that I can be
[56:01] available that you can speak to me and
[56:04] encouraged me and strengthened me and
[56:06] reveal yourself in the sweetness and the
[56:09] power of your glory because that's
[56:11] exactly what happened here to John you
[56:14] see he unfolded his coming to John and
[56:17] when we look at this and it's in this
[56:20] hour you know that we are living and we
[56:23] we hear it and you know many you know
[56:25] we've heard this over and over now the
[56:28] message of the hour and and the promise
[56:30] of God's Word the opening of these seven
[56:33] seals but to remember here listen to me
[56:35] now I'm not gonna deal so much with this
[56:37] tonight but when we look at that of the
[56:39] seven seals we look so many times on the
[56:42] way that we are looking at things in
[56:44] terms of school like one two three four
[56:46] five six seven but the reality of it is
[56:48] is that there could not be any opening
[56:51] of any other seal if the seventh was not
[56:54] open first the seventh itself had to be
[56:59] opened first in that the seventh
[57:02] remember bill mem says he took the seals
[57:05] off himself he said he is those seals
[57:09] because you see out of that the opening
[57:13] because remember the coming of the
[57:15] word must be revealed in that of where
[57:18] he's coming to receive a people on for
[57:21] his namesake
[57:21] before then he opens and turns to the
[57:24] Jews you see the coming of the Lord
[57:26] making known and bringing the Gentiles
[57:29] unto Him in rapture it is within that
[57:32] seven seal and the actual moving listen
[57:35] to me now even in that where the two
[57:37] witnesses receive power and the sixth
[57:40] seal is opened that also falls under
[57:42] that seven seal and all of those things
[57:44] lead up to but coming and the climax
[57:47] it's all ties together in the coming of
[57:51] the Lord it has its parts within it that
[57:56] the Lord help us we'll deal with that
[57:58] even just a little bit more but to see
[58:01] this opening of where we're living
[58:03] we're living in an hour in a time that
[58:07] in reality he can come in any moment
[58:13] don't be get your hopes on other things
[58:16] in this and that's got to take place
[58:18] it's to live for his coming and I'm
[58:23] gonna tell you tonight it might shake
[58:26] your little bit but when you're living
[58:27] for it's coming you don't have to be
[58:29] made to live for his coming it is within
[58:33] your heart that beats for his coming
[58:39] this is why there must be a coming of
[58:43] the Holy Ghost the life of Jesus Christ
[58:46] in the believer by the baptism of the
[58:50] Holy Ghost that then makes us aware of
[58:53] the day our day its message and where we
[58:58] are
[58:59] well that's grace that's grace to think
[59:03] of it a power to live in overcoming life
[59:05] in this hour so how that you know Villa
[59:09] random will mention this in many terms
[59:12] when we think of him coming in the
[59:14] fullness of his power he will speak of
[59:17] it even in the rising of the Sun as the
[59:19] bride coming out of Christ into where
[59:22] that now dear the bride herself coming
[59:25] now
[59:26] to a fullness said the finishing up now
[59:29] of the mystery of God to where now that
[59:32] church that bride that he's been
[59:34] building now to where that she is coming
[59:37] now into that place to where that he
[59:39] himself is able to move in her in the
[59:43] fullness of the power of the
[59:44] Resurrection I want you to notice this
[59:46] if you know if you haven't noticed that
[59:48] I want you to think of this all
[59:50] throughout the message the Prophet and
[59:52] even as it continues to move in 1965 he
[59:56] said here he is appearing in our flesh
[59:59] in the fullness of his power he did not
[1:00:02] say in my flesh he said in our flesh
[1:00:05] because remember he identified himself
[1:00:07] with the Church of the Living God come
[1:00:11] on somebody he has to be in order to be
[1:00:13] four-bed of us so it is Christ himself
[1:00:16] appearing in the power of his
[1:00:19] resurrection to make a people ready for
[1:00:21] his corporal coming not to think of this
[1:00:25] and how that God would make would make
[1:00:27] these things real and alive to us and to
[1:00:30] see that all the way through all the way
[1:00:33] through the scriptures this becoming of
[1:00:36] the Lord it's been unfolded there's been
[1:00:37] one goal that God has had one great
[1:00:41] achievement everything itself has spoke
[1:00:44] of this great achievement of his coming
[1:00:47] I want to look here in the Book of
[1:00:49] Daniel look at Daniel here in Chapter
[1:00:51] nine and to see how that here Daniel
[1:00:54] himself in Daniel 9 verse 1 in the year
[1:00:57] in the first year of Darius the son of a
[1:00:58] hey xerus of the seed of the Metis which
[1:01:01] was made king over the realm of the
[1:01:04] Chaldees in the first year of his reign
[1:01:06] I Daniel understood by books the number
[1:01:11] of the years I want you to catch this
[1:01:13] even though Daniel had the books
[1:01:18] he did not understand until this time
[1:01:23] because when we we look at this we're up
[1:01:27] notice understood by books the number of
[1:01:30] the years where of the word of the Lord
[1:01:32] King to Jeremiah the Prophet so here of
[1:01:35] how that God would make known to him
[1:01:37] that he would accomplish 70 years in the
[1:01:39] desolations of Jerusalem God would open
[1:01:43] to Daniel then even in this year this
[1:01:45] even of the 70 years that they were
[1:01:48] there in Babylon when you read in
[1:01:50] Jeremiah 29 you see that that in itself
[1:01:52] was even as they exiled to Babylon was
[1:01:56] even a type of when they would reject
[1:01:59] the Messiah and how that Israel would be
[1:02:02] scattered but remember he said I know
[1:02:04] the thoughts that I think toward you to
[1:02:08] give you to bring you to an expected end
[1:02:10] is that right and he says when you shall
[1:02:14] begin to seek me with all your heart
[1:02:16] then I shall be found of you in me
[1:02:20] wonderful there to know that it's God
[1:02:23] who stirs our hearts for us to even to
[1:02:26] seek and desire him it's because he
[1:02:29] himself is stirring that desire that we
[1:02:33] would see that to him and they see here
[1:02:36] is Daniel in this time no matter how
[1:02:39] Daniel no doubt he laid but it was and
[1:02:41] then I'll say like this he won the
[1:02:42] Daniel let the dirt the books collect
[1:02:44] dust but he was there God had reserved
[1:02:48] to a certain time and he wasn't that
[1:02:50] Daniel didn't pour over the word but you
[1:02:53] see God opens his word in a certain
[1:02:56] season and God will open and as we see
[1:02:59] here with Daniel by certain channels and
[1:03:03] it doesn't matter everything else could
[1:03:05] be pried into it but you see when God
[1:03:07] reveals they don't have to be no prying
[1:03:10] because it is not something that is
[1:03:13] given by the power of man he said I will
[1:03:16] give power he opens it now to see how
[1:03:23] that he said so in verse three I set my
[1:03:27] face unto the Lord God to seek by prayer
[1:03:30] and
[1:03:30] applications and fasting in sack cloth
[1:03:33] and ashes you see how Daniel is
[1:03:35] understanding it brings desperation you
[1:03:43] see then when Daniel his understanding
[1:03:46] is being made fruitful Daniel begins to
[1:03:51] repent sackcloth and ashes see the
[1:03:57] revealing is the revealing of that word
[1:04:01] it does not bring haughtiness it brings
[1:04:05] humility when the word is truly being
[1:04:08] revealed it brings us to a situation
[1:04:13] even when you look at Isaiah there has
[1:04:15] to be an initial reality strike our
[1:04:18] hearts I am undone and when the word is
[1:04:22] continually being revealed it is not a
[1:04:26] word that brings us puffed up but it
[1:04:29] brings us and the reality of the spirit
[1:04:32] of grace being poured out if we
[1:04:34] recognize it is God that is given power
[1:04:38] for this word to be open to us that we
[1:04:42] might understand it you know what it
[1:04:44] does it brings humility in our hearts
[1:04:46] and our lives it doesn't bring a big eye
[1:04:49] and a little you that's what knowledge
[1:04:53] does but divine revelation it realizes
[1:04:56] it puts you and I to the awareness that
[1:04:58] I am nothing without him though i've
[1:05:02] looked at this i've studied it I've
[1:05:04] looked over it but I'm nothing without
[1:05:06] him and even what he reveals it will
[1:05:10] take the divine operation of the power
[1:05:13] of God that's opened it up to come upon
[1:05:16] my life and that my life will be brought
[1:05:18] subject to be a reflection of what he
[1:05:22] has opened by his quickening power glory
[1:05:28] be to God hallelujah
[1:05:31] not to think in verse 21 the Bible said
[1:05:35] while I was speaking in prayer even the
[1:05:37] man Gabriel Hamas had seen in the vision
[1:05:39] at the beginning being caused to fly
[1:05:41] swiftly touch me about the time of the
[1:05:44] evening
[1:05:44] oblation and he informed me and talked
[1:05:47] with me and said Oh Daniel I am now come
[1:05:50] forth to give thee skill and
[1:05:51] understanding in that wonderful I'm come
[1:05:55] forth for this reason to give thee skill
[1:05:58] and understanding hmm I'll tell you
[1:06:02] right now if then you're wouldn't know
[1:06:04] if then you wouldn't humbled himself
[1:06:05] that had never been no visit of Gabriel
[1:06:09] but you see in order for more to unfold
[1:06:12] is what how did he respond with what was
[1:06:17] made known to him oh you see what was
[1:06:21] opened to Daniel in order for more to be
[1:06:24] unfolded it would require humility old
[1:06:27] friends let me tell you a great treasure
[1:06:29] in this hour is that to be able to where
[1:06:32] God Himself is brother Ram said he said
[1:06:34] God has a hard time he gets a man and he
[1:06:36] said that man sees a little something he
[1:06:38] said and he gets so inflated in himself
[1:06:40] and God has to put him on the Shelf
[1:06:42] because he can't use him no more why
[1:06:44] because it's not the man studying an
[1:06:47] ability that has given him that
[1:06:50] understanding you realize friends we
[1:06:52] study we give ourselves to the Lord but
[1:06:55] it has to be God to come down and tie it
[1:06:58] all together that's the same way where
[1:07:02] you and I we give ourselves to that
[1:07:04] Ministry of the word but it takes the
[1:07:06] power of Almighty God to move down in
[1:07:09] our lives there in your military as we
[1:07:11] pray Lord be it unto me according to my
[1:07:13] word Lord let my life match this word
[1:07:16] Lord God let what I'm hearing Lord be
[1:07:18] reflected in my life Lord God Lord I
[1:07:21] want to just give myself even more help
[1:07:24] me Lord if there's areas of my life Lord
[1:07:26] that I need to surrender lord help me to
[1:07:29] surrender in a deeper way help me to get
[1:07:31] my eyes off of everything else and let
[1:07:34] it be focused on you at the beginning of
[1:07:39] that supplications the commandment came
[1:07:42] forth and I'm come to show thee for thou
[1:07:46] art greatly beloved so Daniel was making
[1:07:48] supplications requests
[1:07:51] and I'm come to show thee for thou art
[1:07:53] greatly beloved therefore understand the
[1:07:56] matter and consider the vision he said
[1:07:58] seventy weeks are determined upon thy
[1:08:00] people and upon thy holy city to finish
[1:08:03] the transgression and to make an end of
[1:08:05] sins and to make reconciliation for
[1:08:07] iniquity and to bring in everlasting
[1:08:09] righteousness and to seal up the vision
[1:08:11] and prophecy and to anoint the most holy
[1:08:14] all of this being unfolded verse
[1:08:17] twenty-five know therefore and
[1:08:20] understand that from the going forth of
[1:08:23] the commandment to restore and to build
[1:08:26] Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince
[1:08:30] shall be seven weeks and threescore and
[1:08:34] two weeks the street shall be built
[1:08:36] again and the wall even in trouble
[1:08:39] sometimes and after threescore and two
[1:08:43] weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not
[1:08:46] for himself Daniel by the grace of God
[1:08:54] can see that what is determined for his
[1:08:58] people and how that God would break it
[1:09:02] down within those seven weeks that then
[1:09:05] when the Messiah would come the Lord
[1:09:06] Jesus in the midst of the week he would
[1:09:10] be cut off
[1:09:12] not for himself they would be rejected
[1:09:17] he would be crucified
[1:09:20] what he would offer up his own blood but
[1:09:27] then when we look at this here that
[1:09:29] within verse 26
[1:09:31] what we what we come to understand that
[1:09:34] we remember everything itself even when
[1:09:38] you look at how the disciples would ask
[1:09:41] the Lord Jesus there in the opening of
[1:09:43] Acts and they said will you at this time
[1:09:47] restore the kingdom unto Israel
[1:09:50] remember that's millennium questions
[1:09:52] right there will you at this time
[1:09:55] restore the kingdom unto Israel they're
[1:09:58] still looking at that because of the
[1:10:00] promise of where there is to be a
[1:10:03] restoration for Israel now when you look
[1:10:07] at this here you know to think of it
[1:10:09] when we look at the scripture and we
[1:10:11] take into account blindness you know
[1:10:13] friends to realize that the blindness
[1:10:15] itself is even that of where that they
[1:10:18] would read the Old Testament prophecies
[1:10:21] and they would even see the things that
[1:10:23] would be mentioned in there about the
[1:10:26] Gentiles but yet their understanding
[1:10:28] would not be opened to it because it
[1:10:31] wasn't for them it wasn't for them to
[1:10:35] understand that to realize they read
[1:10:38] this in the book of Isaiah friends you
[1:10:40] you understand that as Bible readers
[1:10:42] it's littered all the way and I I don't
[1:10:44] let me say littered I mean to say it
[1:10:45] scattered it's all throughout the whole
[1:10:47] Old Testament of how that God Himself
[1:10:50] would deal and take a people out of the
[1:10:52] Gentiles
[1:10:53] this wasn't just a few isolated
[1:10:55] scriptures here and there it was loaded
[1:10:58] throughout the Old Testament but yet to
[1:11:00] see how that God would keep back from
[1:11:03] them and understanding and what they
[1:11:05] were looking for they ended up missing
[1:11:08] it because it didn't come according to
[1:11:11] their understanding and that is God's
[1:11:14] grace to you and I and that's why I want
[1:11:17] to look at a little bit because in the
[1:11:20] unfolding of his coming
[1:11:23] he come to redeem when you think of this
[1:11:28] here in verse 26 that in the midst of
[1:11:32] the three-and-a-half weeks here is where
[1:11:34] the mystery of the Gentiles comes in I
[1:11:38] want you to think of this here in
[1:11:40] Galatians chapter 3 verse 6 even as
[1:11:44] abraham believed God and it was
[1:11:45] accounted to him for righteousness
[1:11:47] know you therefore that they which are
[1:11:49] of faith the same are the children of
[1:11:52] Abraham and the scripture foreseeing
[1:11:55] that God would justify the heathen
[1:11:58] through faith preached before the gospel
[1:12:01] unto Abraham saying in thee shall all
[1:12:05] nations be blessed so then they which be
[1:12:08] of faith are blessed with faithful
[1:12:11] Abraham so God had already preached this
[1:12:15] mystery it said already notice what Paul
[1:12:19] was doing you see Paul is giving the
[1:12:22] unfolding in the mystery of this
[1:12:24] ministry that let was hidden there
[1:12:27] within the Lord Jesus Christ in the
[1:12:30] coming of the Messiah that which was
[1:12:31] hidden within that of the covenants that
[1:12:34] was laying there but now how the spirit
[1:12:36] of understanding would break forth Paul
[1:12:39] couldn't have done that it took the same
[1:12:41] power of God to come upon God that Paul
[1:12:44] could actually see this come on friends
[1:12:48] Paul had earthly power and he was
[1:12:52] killing the very Church of the Living
[1:12:54] God
[1:12:55] Paul ah persecutest thou me but you see
[1:13:00] once he got harnessed by the power of
[1:13:02] God Paul was a part of the Church of the
[1:13:06] Living God and there was a purpose there
[1:13:09] was a commission for his life that
[1:13:11] pertained to the Gentiles so when you
[1:13:15] look at this here in the scripture we
[1:13:16] find this unfolding of the coming of the
[1:13:19] Lord I had trusted simple to us tonight
[1:13:21] and I trusted he'll make it simple
[1:13:23] because he's the one that has to do it
[1:13:24] we recall in the scriptures here when we
[1:13:27] look back clear in the times of Joseph
[1:13:30] we see that type of Joseph with that of
[1:13:32] the Lord Jesus whether youíre lies that
[1:13:34] Joseph himself he rose to power but
[1:13:37] Joseph rose to power
[1:13:39] remember when after that his his
[1:13:41] brethren had sold him into slavery they
[1:13:44] rejected him they despised him they sold
[1:13:48] him into slavery they told a lie
[1:13:51] him but you see as they went on down
[1:13:55] into their land remember Joseph himself
[1:13:58] God had his hand upon Joseph's life
[1:14:01] Joseph was sold into slavery come on
[1:14:05] friends God Himself became one of us he
[1:14:10] was sold into slavery and then - think
[1:14:13] about it
[1:14:14] he was raised there raised up there out
[1:14:17] out of the out of the that the slavery
[1:14:19] and then we recognize that how that you
[1:14:22] know he went then into prison and then
[1:14:25] after prison prison because of a false
[1:14:27] accusation but then after prison here
[1:14:30] remember now God supernaturally watch
[1:14:32] this now it was not anything that Joseph
[1:14:36] could do in his own accord to bring him
[1:14:39] into position but there was a
[1:14:41] supernatural gift a power that was
[1:14:45] present there that God could move in his
[1:14:47] life and then what was it it was God
[1:14:50] providing for himself Oh glory be to God
[1:14:54] it is God who makes a way that you and I
[1:14:58] might come into the position that he has
[1:15:01] ordained for our lives and like brother
[1:15:05] Adam could say looking back on Joseph he
[1:15:08] said it was something there a little
[1:15:09] pride that had to get worked out of his
[1:15:11] life in order for him to rise but we
[1:15:13] know there was not know no pride at all
[1:15:16] in that of the Lord Jesus but he erases
[1:15:19] the power where there's no one else
[1:15:21] that's more powerful than that of
[1:15:22] Pharaoh and he himself rose to the right
[1:15:25] hand of Pharaoh speaking of that of the
[1:15:27] Lord Jesus and he was given a Gentile
[1:15:30] bride I want you to think of this in
[1:15:32] Genesis 41 44 and pharaoh said unto
[1:15:35] joseph i am Pharaoh and without these
[1:15:38] shall no man lift up his hand or foot in
[1:15:41] all the land of Egypt and Pharaoh called
[1:15:43] Joseph's name zaphenath-paneah the
[1:15:48] revealer of the secret things and he
[1:15:50] gave him to wife Inessa the daughter of
[1:15:55] Potiphar priest of on and Joseph went
[1:15:58] out over all the land of Egypt
[1:16:03] so here while is away well they have
[1:16:07] rejected Joseph here Joseph
[1:16:10] they don't they're not aware of it they
[1:16:13] didn't see this but why Joseph was down
[1:16:17] there he takes a Gentile bride gonna be
[1:16:23] too drunk
[1:16:24] they're not even they're not aware of
[1:16:26] this and then to see remember what
[1:16:28] Joseph had made known in the taking of
[1:16:30] this Gentile bride but their God had
[1:16:33] made known there was a famine now all of
[1:16:35] this was sealed there in the dream that
[1:16:38] God had given to Pharaoh
[1:16:39] there's nobody that could break and open
[1:16:41] that seal but God Himself gave power and
[1:16:46] understanding that Joseph might
[1:16:48] interpret and see that dream what was
[1:16:51] that when that dream was opened he
[1:16:53] became a Ministry of life it became a
[1:16:58] Ministry of preservation it's the same
[1:17:02] way it was when that impending judgment
[1:17:04] was upon all the wise men down there at
[1:17:07] Babylon it was Daniel who in in took his
[1:17:10] brethren had said that I seek for the
[1:17:12] mercies of God and what did God do God
[1:17:15] opened to them he broke the seal of
[1:17:18] understanding to where that they
[1:17:20] themselves would be able to stand there
[1:17:22] before Nebuchadnezzar and make known to
[1:17:25] him the interpretation of the dream what
[1:17:27] was that it was a Ministry of life that
[1:17:31] preserved life when death was impending
[1:17:34] upon the wise men there was one who
[1:17:37] stood up in the midst of that time and
[1:17:39] God granted power there in that hour for
[1:17:43] seal to be broken now to think of this
[1:17:46] how the Joseph he goes remember
[1:17:50] everything itself is laid in place that
[1:17:54] there would be a stirring up of the
[1:17:57] grain now you and I realized grain
[1:18:00] itself is seed and within seed is life
[1:18:06] right son to think of it how that he
[1:18:10] himself has preserved that there would
[1:18:13] be
[1:18:14] pouring out of seed life upon the seeds
[1:18:19] that he has planted within each bed of
[1:18:22] time are you with me it has to be the
[1:18:26] seed life coming upon the seed of God
[1:18:30] and his seed life which is the region of
[1:18:34] the spoken word when that seed life of
[1:18:37] the water strikes a seed of God they
[1:18:40] become a son and daughter of God what is
[1:18:44] it it is called by His mercies that has
[1:18:47] reserved reserved in the storehouse of
[1:18:50] his word in the secret of his presence
[1:18:54] come on somebody the storehouse is not a
[1:18:57] physical building somewhere the
[1:18:59] storehouse is not a CD a DVD book or
[1:19:02] tape to hold somebody but the storehouse
[1:19:05] itself remember now that storehouse it
[1:19:09] is a place of safety it is when they
[1:19:12] came to the storehouse whether they were
[1:19:14] the storehouse a storehouse be straw
[1:19:16] house see you know in the world it says
[1:19:18] that when they went there they were
[1:19:20] coming as unto Joseph because what was
[1:19:23] it it was that preservation that had
[1:19:26] been made in order to preserve life when
[1:19:30] famine was strike in the earth that life
[1:19:33] itself would come forth or to think of
[1:19:36] this hour that God has manifested listen
[1:19:39] to me now God has manifested in this
[1:19:42] hour to you and I he said I'll not leave
[1:19:44] myself without a witness I'm not gonna
[1:19:47] leave my blood here in Satan's Eden but
[1:19:49] I've got sufficient store for the hour I
[1:19:53] have got all that you have need up for
[1:19:56] this hour and it is him are Joseph the
[1:19:59] Lord Jesus Christ that is releasing to
[1:20:03] you and I what we have neither deer else
[1:20:09] we could have the tapes and yet still
[1:20:10] not being storehouse now being released
[1:20:13] grains not being released we can know
[1:20:17] all the words and yet grains are not
[1:20:18] being released because remember this is
[1:20:21] not natural grains this is not about
[1:20:23] putting grains together
[1:20:25] come on somebody this is about Joseph
[1:20:28] himself the Lord Jesus Christ revealing
[1:20:32] himself to his beloved this is part of
[1:20:39] the coming of the Lord
[1:20:41] notice as he reveals himself in through
[1:20:44] his brethren for glory I'm doing all I
[1:20:48] can just to stay on this little thing
[1:20:50] that he gave me tonight Oh glory be to
[1:20:55] God Genesis 45 7 here he is revealing
[1:20:58] himself to his brother
[1:20:59] notice what he makes her known to his
[1:21:01] brother God sent me before you to
[1:21:04] preserve you a posterity in the earth
[1:21:12] can we say lord help me to look at my
[1:21:15] trials that way let me be so refreshed
[1:21:20] by the Spirit of God that I can stand
[1:21:23] this way Joseph this listen listen this
[1:21:27] was a type this was a type but divine
[1:21:30] love he had given divine love place
[1:21:33] listen friends as according to the
[1:21:36] allotment of what could be measured out
[1:21:38] within that hour because they could not
[1:21:40] receive the Holy Ghost
[1:21:41] it could not be poured out in that hour
[1:21:44] but according to what could be they
[1:21:47] allowed themselves to be refreshed by
[1:21:49] the Lord oh god help us and God sent me
[1:21:56] before you to preserve you a posterity
[1:22:00] in the earth and to save your lives by a
[1:22:03] great deliverance so now it was not that
[1:22:08] you you that sent me hither but God
[1:22:13] you sold me but it wasn't you it was God
[1:22:17] who had me come this way Oh glory be to
[1:22:21] God see the unfolding is the unfolding
[1:22:24] in his presence you think Joseph didn't
[1:22:28] shout when this struck his heart you
[1:22:33] think it didn't make him joy and that's
[1:22:35] what my just in these verses here I'm
[1:22:36] talking about to where that God had made
[1:22:39] this and known to him
[1:22:44] it made him rejoice you oughta made him
[1:22:48] do it made it long for little Benjamin
[1:22:54] glory be to God
[1:22:56] Oh hallelujah think of this of how I
[1:22:59] just want to refer to this a moment you
[1:23:02] find that hound that even when Joseph
[1:23:04] would bring his two sons that were born
[1:23:06] to him there while he was in Egypt
[1:23:09] Ephraim and Manasseh and I just referred
[1:23:11] to it because I there's some other
[1:23:12] things I want to read here found that he
[1:23:15] would hear ephraim and manasseh being
[1:23:17] born and hound that when he brought him
[1:23:19] forth he brought him forth in the
[1:23:22] seemingly the right order so that even
[1:23:24] Israel's right hand that you know that
[1:23:27] it would be upon the rat head and and
[1:23:29] things but notice how that God moved and
[1:23:32] God guided the hand and to think of how
[1:23:34] that bit Jacob I love this scripture in
[1:23:37] Genesis 48 16 when Jacob went forth and
[1:23:40] there was a crossing of the hands look
[1:23:42] at this blessing in Genesis 48 16 the
[1:23:45] angel which redeemed me from all evil
[1:23:48] bless the lads
[1:23:51] you see Jacob realized it was the angel
[1:23:54] that redeemed me there was the angel of
[1:23:58] the Lord that released Israel that was a
[1:24:02] prisoner in Jacob it was the age of the
[1:24:06] Lord that released you and me
[1:24:10] amen the age of the Lord that release
[1:24:13] the blessing as it says for Jacob that
[1:24:15] he blessed him they're not the ground
[1:24:21] there
[1:24:26] Joseph he saw that the right hand was up
[1:24:29] on Ephraim and it displeased him verse
[1:24:32] 17
[1:24:34] and he held up his father's hands to
[1:24:36] remove it
[1:24:39] Joseph said to his father not so my
[1:24:41] father for this is the first board put
[1:24:45] my right hand upon he said his father
[1:24:49] refused and said I know it I know it the
[1:24:55] crossing of the hands where that the
[1:24:58] blessing itself would pass upon the
[1:25:02] Gentiles the blessing of Abraham that
[1:25:07] belongeth to the firstborn but you see
[1:25:10] the mystery of it was there was some
[1:25:13] firstborn of his brethren firstborn
[1:25:17] there of his wife look at this here in
[1:25:21] Galatians 3 verse 13 Christ hath
[1:25:25] redeemed us from the curse of the law
[1:25:26] being made a curse for us for it is
[1:25:28] written cursed is every one that hangeth
[1:25:30] on a tree that the blessing of Abraham
[1:25:33] might come on the Gentiles through Jesus
[1:25:36] Christ that we might receive the promise
[1:25:39] of the Spirit through faith Paul said in
[1:25:42] Romans 11:25 for how we're not brethren
[1:25:45] that you should be ignorant of this
[1:25:46] mystery lest you should by your wise in
[1:25:50] your own conceits that the blindness in
[1:25:52] part has happened to Israel until the
[1:25:55] fullness of the Gentiles be come in
[1:25:59] there is a finishing up of the Gentiles
[1:26:03] and we're in that hour right now not to
[1:26:07] think of mouths that Paul would go on
[1:26:08] and lay this out in first Corinthians 2
[1:26:10] I'm just moving through these scriptures
[1:26:12] here how Paul would say howbeit we speak
[1:26:14] wisdom among them that are perfect yet
[1:26:16] not the wisdom of this world nor of the
[1:26:18] princes of this world that come to
[1:26:20] nought but we speak the wisdom of God in
[1:26:23] a mystery even the hidden wisdom which
[1:26:26] God ordained before the world unto our
[1:26:31] glory which none of the princes of this
[1:26:35] world knew this was very important for
[1:26:37] had they known it they would not have
[1:26:40] crucified the Lord
[1:26:43] Gouri if Israel had recognized it
[1:26:48] they wouldn't have crucified him listen
[1:26:51] to me now but if they would not have
[1:26:53] crucified him not only you and I would
[1:26:56] not have brought in but remember he had
[1:26:59] to be led as a lamb to the slaughter he
[1:27:03] had to give his life the cadaval age he
[1:27:10] had to give his life willingly and God
[1:27:16] blind to them the princes of this world
[1:27:21] if they had known it they would not have
[1:27:25] crucified him this is God's grace notice
[1:27:29] the Lord Jesus speaks even referring to
[1:27:32] Isaiah chapter 42 when he wouldn't make
[1:27:35] known to them after the Pharisees had
[1:27:37] went out and held a council against him
[1:27:38] how they might destroy him but when
[1:27:40] Jesus knew it he would drew himself from
[1:27:43] fence and a great multitude followed him
[1:27:45] and He healed them all and he charged
[1:27:47] them that they should not make him known
[1:27:50] think of this Jesus is not playing
[1:27:53] around with words he told he charged him
[1:27:57] don't make this no you know what I think
[1:28:03] of I think oh how that when you look at
[1:28:06] the friends if it if it could have been
[1:28:08] known it could have changed a lot of
[1:28:10] things but he charged them don't make
[1:28:13] this known you look at how that even
[1:28:16] when many have tried to get over there
[1:28:18] into the Jews but remember there it will
[1:28:21] be the Ministry of Moses and Elijah
[1:28:24] reham personated again the same
[1:28:28] characteristics of the elijah ministry
[1:28:31] and moses ministry Rhian personated in
[1:28:34] the two witnesses that god has ordained
[1:28:38] i'll tell you right now tonight they can
[1:28:41] be there right now tonight what are they
[1:28:43] waiting on they're waiting on us to get
[1:28:46] out of the way
[1:28:47] and when we're taken out of the way
[1:28:49] the power comes to strike them to be
[1:28:52] able to move in to that ministry for the
[1:28:55] hundred and forty-four thousand they've
[1:28:57] got to be in position in a place to
[1:29:00] receive that necessary power to open
[1:29:03] that sixth seal what about you and I
[1:29:05] there's got to be a necessary placement
[1:29:08] in the Lord Jesus Christ the chosen
[1:29:11] place of worship like Enoch that we
[1:29:14] might receive that charge of translation
[1:29:17] power and be taken from this earth
[1:29:20] enrapturing redeeming Grace power that's
[1:29:25] granted
[1:29:28] remember token of the random brother Ram
[1:29:30] was ready to go over there stay don't go
[1:29:33] in there it's not for you it's not their
[1:29:37] time yet God has everything in time
[1:29:42] don't he we're glory be to God but there
[1:29:47] was nothing wrong with the anticipation
[1:29:49] for wanting to go this is a time for
[1:29:53] rejoicing with this of what we're seeing
[1:29:56] rejoice with Israel notice verse 17 that
[1:29:59] it might be fulfilled which was spoken
[1:30:00] by Isaiah the prophet saying behold my
[1:30:03] servant whom I have chosen my beloved in
[1:30:05] whom my soul is well pleased I will put
[1:30:08] my spirit upon him and he shall show
[1:30:10] judgment to the Gentiles he shall not
[1:30:12] strive nor cry neither shall any man
[1:30:15] hear his voice in the street a bruised
[1:30:17] Reed shall he not break and a smoking
[1:30:19] flax shall he not quenched till he's sin
[1:30:22] forth judgment unto victory and in his
[1:30:25] name shall the Gentiles trust our Boaz
[1:30:29] is not gonna rest until judgment has
[1:30:35] went forth unto victory Amen our ball
[1:30:38] has is not resting but we are resting in
[1:30:42] him you think of this of how that even
[1:30:46] this was among the Jews you know there
[1:30:50] were elect use there were those the
[1:30:51] Bible says it was waiting on the
[1:30:52] consolation of Israel right Simeon Anna
[1:30:59] then you find even their of the Apostles
[1:31:02] Peter James Bartholomew Mark Luke all of
[1:31:07] those and here they were as Jews but
[1:31:13] they were elect in that of the Gentile
[1:31:17] bride they were a part of the bride so
[1:31:21] much so to wear the very body is built
[1:31:25] upon the holy prophets and apostles are
[1:31:31] you is me there is a word that was
[1:31:34] delivered the the word was given in that
[1:31:38] hour the truth of the things that you
[1:31:41] and I are brought back to by the grace
[1:31:43] of God in this hour it was delivered to
[1:31:47] them and in this hour it's an hour of
[1:31:50] restoring now what you think of this
[1:31:53] when he poured out here his spirit
[1:31:56] remember when when God you see shows you
[1:31:59] how how that this was hidden of hound
[1:32:01] that even when it came to Peter and
[1:32:04] Peter remember when God had to deal with
[1:32:06] him and finally has Peter submitted to
[1:32:08] the voice of God and he went to
[1:32:10] Cornelius house Cornelius being a
[1:32:12] Gentile and then how that when they came
[1:32:15] under the word that was ministered in
[1:32:17] that hour it was the word in the
[1:32:19] Ministry of the fulfillment of all of
[1:32:21] what the prophets had spoken of what the
[1:32:24] word had called for in that of Jesus
[1:32:26] Christ the Messiah and then to see how
[1:32:29] that the Holy Ghost was poured out upon
[1:32:31] Cornelius and his household now think of
[1:32:34] this after the Holy Ghost was poured out
[1:32:37] upon them then remember the scripture
[1:32:39] said can we forbid these to be baptized
[1:32:42] seeing that they have received the Holy
[1:32:44] Ghost such as we had now remember when
[1:32:47] Peter got back to Jerusalem they were
[1:32:49] questioning him why did you go among the
[1:32:53] Gentiles but you see Peter himself he
[1:32:57] had a vindication that was not a man
[1:33:00] vindication but it was God giving
[1:33:02] witness there of a mystery that even
[1:33:05] Peter and the rest of them could not see
[1:33:07] in that time because
[1:33:09] member the ministry to that of the
[1:33:11] Gentiles was not given to people but God
[1:33:15] was er was letting it be known that he
[1:33:18] has accepted Jew and Gentile in the
[1:33:22] outpouring of the blessing of Abraham in
[1:33:26] that of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:33:28] and you cannot argue with the baptism of
[1:33:32] the Holy Ghost because that of the Holy
[1:33:34] Ghost is the very person of Jesus Christ
[1:33:37] it's a confirmation a personal witness
[1:33:40] it is a seal of God himself so they
[1:33:46] could not reject that so that even had
[1:33:48] to be open remember remember there was
[1:33:50] great contention you watch how all this
[1:33:53] convention followed in the even
[1:33:56] throughout the the early church you had
[1:33:58] men that could not cross over fully come
[1:34:02] on you had men listen to me now you had
[1:34:04] people who was around and they
[1:34:06] understood even they had an
[1:34:08] understanding as far as hearing what
[1:34:10] Paul and them was saying and what was
[1:34:12] going on and what was being spoken from
[1:34:14] that of even in in the book of Acts but
[1:34:16] remember here they weren't men that were
[1:34:18] converted because Paul never called them
[1:34:21] there he said men and many times he said
[1:34:23] false brethren he called him false
[1:34:26] workers come on he said men he never
[1:34:29] called him brethren you see what it was
[1:34:32] and identified them and what they were
[1:34:34] trying to do is to take away from the
[1:34:37] simplicity that was in Jesus Christ you
[1:34:40] see that's the devil's objective is to
[1:34:43] try to get people's focus on things that
[1:34:47] are not the real kernel of the message
[1:34:50] and if he can get people to focus on
[1:34:54] things that are not the real kernel they
[1:34:56] miss what the message is all about and
[1:34:59] it passes right through the myths and
[1:35:02] they don't recognize it because just
[1:35:04] like the Pharisees the Pharisees was
[1:35:07] caught up with pots and pans and eaten
[1:35:10] with unwashen hands they were caught up
[1:35:12] on things that was not the message
[1:35:15] come on somebody and the message itself
[1:35:18] is the kernel life the revelation of
[1:35:22] Jesus Christ
[1:35:23] the literal life of Jesus Christ that
[1:35:25] token the fullness of his power
[1:35:29] Amen no let the devil distract you with
[1:35:33] frivolous little things but keep your
[1:35:37] focus on the Lord Jesus Christ for them
[1:35:42] that look for him shall he appear the
[1:35:44] second time without sin unto salvation
[1:35:49] let me just read a few more places and
[1:35:51] we'll stop you tonight look what if Paul
[1:35:55] has given testimony in Exodus acts 26 15
[1:35:59] and I said who art our Lord and he said
[1:36:02] I am Jesus whom thou persecutors but
[1:36:05] rise and stand upon their feet for I
[1:36:07] have appeared unto thee for this purpose
[1:36:09] to make thee a minister and a witness
[1:36:11] both of these things which thou hast
[1:36:15] seen and of the things into which I will
[1:36:18] appear to thee delivering me from the
[1:36:21] people and from the Gentiles unto whom
[1:36:24] now I send thee to open their eyes to
[1:36:29] turn them from darkness to light from
[1:36:32] the power of Satan unto God do you see
[1:36:35] what is saying here God is releasing
[1:36:38] power his quickening power God is
[1:36:42] releasing this to where that Paul the
[1:36:45] ministry would be an opening of eyes and
[1:36:48] a turning from darkness to light and
[1:36:50] from the power of Satan unto God that
[1:36:53] they may receive forgiveness of sin and
[1:36:55] inheritance among them which are
[1:36:57] sanctified by faith that is in me that
[1:37:02] is why Paul could say our gospel came
[1:37:04] out in word only but in power in
[1:37:08] demonstration to over be to God Paul
[1:37:13] goes on to say in Romans 15 15
[1:37:15] nevertheless brethren I have written the
[1:37:18] more boldly unto you in some sort as
[1:37:19] putting you in mind because of the grace
[1:37:21] that is given to me of God that I should
[1:37:24] be the minister of Jesus Christ to the
[1:37:27] Gentiles men
[1:37:29] during the gospel of God that the
[1:37:31] offering up of the Gentiles
[1:37:33] might be acceptable being sanctified by
[1:37:36] the Holy Ghost
[1:37:44] Romans 16:25 now to him that is of power
[1:37:52] to establish you according to my gospel
[1:37:55] and the preaching of Jesus Christ
[1:37:57] according to the revelation of the
[1:38:00] mystery which was kept secret since the
[1:38:04] world began but now is made manifest and
[1:38:09] by the scriptures of the prophets
[1:38:11] according to the commandment of the
[1:38:13] everlasting God made known to all
[1:38:15] nations for the obedience of faith to
[1:38:18] God only wise be glory through Jesus
[1:38:21] Christ for ever and ever amen
[1:38:24] real quick Ephesians 3 3 how that by
[1:38:27] revelation he made known unto me the
[1:38:29] mystery I want you to think of this Paul
[1:38:34] was already persecuting the church
[1:38:38] that God had to make known to him by
[1:38:41] revelation the mystery of the church and
[1:38:45] that being that which was hidden in
[1:38:50] Christ in God from before the foundation
[1:38:54] of the world and I wrote a for in a few
[1:38:59] words whereby when you read you may
[1:39:00] understand my knowledge in the mystery
[1:39:02] of Christ which in other ages was not
[1:39:05] made known unto the sons of men and as
[1:39:09] it is now revealed unto his holy
[1:39:11] apostles and prophets by the spirit that
[1:39:14] the Gentiles should be fellow heirs and
[1:39:17] of the same body and partakers of his
[1:39:20] promise in Christ by the gospel
[1:39:29] Titus 2:11 for the grace of God that
[1:39:32] bringeth salvation hath appeared to all
[1:39:34] men teaching us that denying ungodliness
[1:39:36] and worldly lusts we should live soberly
[1:39:38] righteously and godly in this present
[1:39:41] world looking for that blessed hope and
[1:39:44] the glorious appearing of the Great God
[1:39:48] and our Savior Jesus Christ who gave
[1:39:52] himself for us that he might redeem us
[1:39:55] from all iniquity and purify unto
[1:39:58] himself a peculiar people zealous of
[1:40:02] good works here's the mystery of Ruth
[1:40:12] there's the mystery of Rahab this is
[1:40:18] where Paul would go on in Ephesians 5
[1:40:21] and he would say husbands love your
[1:40:24] wives even as Christ so loved the church
[1:40:27] and gave himself for it that he might
[1:40:31] sanctify and cleanse it with the washing
[1:40:36] of water by the word that he might
[1:40:40] present unto himself a glorious church
[1:40:44] without having any spot wrinkle blemish
[1:40:47] or any such thing
[1:40:49] and he said this mystery I speak
[1:40:52] concerning Christ and the church it was
[1:40:57] a mystery held within him that in the
[1:41:02] midst of the seven weeks the Messiah he
[1:41:05] was cut off that the Gentiles that
[1:41:09] Joseph might take a bride unto himself
[1:41:15] and to think when he gathers and reveals
[1:41:21] himself to his brethren let me put it in
[1:41:26] the words that the Prophet said it in
[1:41:28] the fifth seal he will make himself
[1:41:32] known and say what you intended for evil
[1:41:36] God meant for good don't more no more I
[1:41:43] have come I have a wife in the palace
[1:41:48] and I've come for you we're going to be
[1:41:52] one big family
[1:41:55] you see patrols 144,000 they are
[1:41:59] electing God said I can never forget yes
[1:42:02] really
[1:42:04] you're engraved on the palms of my hands
[1:42:10] we are his wife they are his brethren
[1:42:17] but through the mystery how that God
[1:42:21] unfolding is coming taking a people out
[1:42:26] of the Gentiles for his namesake
[1:42:32] what grace is given to you and I friends
[1:42:38] to be able to recognize this in this
[1:42:42] hour what grace
[1:42:50] what grace and like Daniel to say Lord
[1:42:54] to understand by the books to wear that
[1:42:57] the power the quickening power of God to
[1:43:00] tie these things together it warms our
[1:43:06] hearts to see this life move in to our
[1:43:14] life and change us listen that's what
[1:43:21] means everything is to be a part of is
[1:43:26] coming right now to be a part of his
[1:43:32] coming right now to make sure that you
[1:43:38] are ready behold the bridegroom cometh
[1:43:41] go ye out to meet him and the wise they
[1:43:47] had oil in their lamps the foolish had
[1:43:50] some oil but they let it run out you see
[1:43:55] friends it's important to make sure that
[1:43:58] the Holy Ghost that the token it is a
[1:44:01] token there upon the soul because there
[1:44:06] upon the soul it can never run out
[1:44:11] amen behold the bridegroom cometh go you
[1:44:16] out to meet him what an hour that we're
[1:44:19] living in
[1:44:20] it's an hour to be sober to be watchful
[1:44:23] an hour to be ready as the scripture
[1:44:27] said for in an hour that you think not
[1:44:30] even so he cometh but I say to you
[1:44:35] you're not in the dark that the night
[1:44:39] should overtake you you are children of
[1:44:43] the day when we have been born of the
[1:44:48] light we are of the day we who were
[1:44:53] sometimes darkness now are ye night in
[1:44:59] the Lord
[1:45:01] arise and shine for thy light has come
[1:45:05] and the glory of the lord has risen upon
[1:45:09] thee gross darkness shall be seen upon
[1:45:14] the people but the glory of the Lord
[1:45:18] shall be seen upon thee in the midst of
[1:45:23] darkness there is light light in Goshen
[1:45:31] there is light in our life for if thine
[1:45:37] eye be single then thy whole body shall
[1:45:43] be full of light the bride is standing
[1:45:46] on her feet hey man
[1:45:49] eyes have come the light has entered and
[1:45:52] the intelligence of Christ the mind of
[1:45:55] Christ operating in the body of Jesus
[1:45:58] Christ you love him
[1:46:03] in the midst of darkness we are lights
[1:46:08] shadows of lights yea though I walk
[1:46:12] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:46:14] death I will fear no evil for thou art
[1:46:18] with me and if there's a shadow the
[1:46:22] Prophet said that shows there's light
[1:46:24] present because without light there's no
[1:46:28] shadow but there's light to lead us
[1:46:33] through oh yes we are going to stand on
[1:46:38] the other side of the Red Sea I said we
[1:46:43] are going to stand on the other side of
[1:46:44] the Red Sea we have come through the
[1:46:46] sanctifying power of God but that red
[1:46:49] sea also holds the type as the prophet
[1:46:52] said there is another great Victory Day

[1:48:42] distinct knowledge of these things but

[1:54:06] Lord and what she watered became the
[1:54:11] beast of power that would pack her to
[1:54:16] see her brethren
[1:54:18] she would be brought out of the house

[2:04:29] to see God's grace God opening to you
[2:04:34] and I to make us aware of the day we're
[2:04:37] living in the day you know friends to
[2:04:41] think of it like this Paul Martin
[2:04:45] Iranians it was a day they were they
[2:04:49] were ministering that promise it was a
[2:04:51] promise that was to come but here is a
[2:04:55] day where we're living in where God is
[2:04:59] present to fulfill what he's promised to
[2:05:03] [Music]
[2:05:06] think of it you know but the RAM would
[2:05:09] say like this he said that God has taken
[2:05:11] he said his book and would make known to
[2:05:15] us the things within this but it would
[2:05:18] help our faith that you and I would be
[2:05:21] able to look he said when job had no
[2:05:23] Bible Abraham and them he said they had
[2:05:27] no Bible he said they moved by the
[2:05:31] divine revelation but to see how the God
[2:05:34] by divine revelation would open and show
[2:05:38] to you and I revealing / his power so
[2:05:44] that we can see him and see ourselves in
[2:05:50] him and seen this glorious plan of
[2:05:55] redemption that we are a part of his
[2:06:02] coming we are part of his coming
[2:06:09] what grace what grace when you have
[2:06:14] asked you can go buy church signs and
[2:06:17] you'll see it wrote we're looking for
[2:06:19] his coming but to see the mystery of his
[2:06:24] coming he is actually a going away
[2:06:30] because he's come as far as in his
[2:06:33] spirit to make a people ready and he's
[2:06:37] got a place reserved we shall be changed
[2:06:43] we shall meet him in the air a place
[2:06:48] reserved to meet him
[2:06:54] making us ready all brothers and sisters
[2:06:58] this any day now knows it's passed down
[2:07:04] just any moment we're gonna be gathered
[2:07:08] with the rest of the bunch any moment
[2:07:18] glory be to God
[2:07:21] making ready for what lets us all get
[2:07:25] together like that brother brems says he
[2:07:26] does that because he said we know that
[2:07:30] we're gonna want to see who made it and
[2:07:32] who did we're gonna miracles he did so
[2:07:35] and so he said but by that time he said
[2:07:39] he wants to see who made it he said by
[2:07:41] the time all that is done we done had
[2:07:44] all that time about 30 40 days he said
[2:07:47] then then he appears and you know if
[2:07:53] that means all attention is going to be
[2:07:56] upon him you know what that shows for us
[2:08:01] as his bride right now the grace that is
[2:08:04] given that we have our attention on him
[2:08:08] right now he's the focus of our life if
[2:08:13] we get out of step a little bit His
[2:08:15] grace is there to say you can begin at
[2:08:17] this day you get back and step here's
[2:08:20] grace because we are his workmanship
[2:08:25] don't you love you what a day that's
[2:08:29] going to be what a day this is there
[2:08:33] what a day that's going to be glory be
[2:08:37] to God amen
[2:08:39] why don't you shake hands with one
[2:08:40] anothers you're being dismissed brother
[2:08:41] Brown would you sing that it song that
[2:08:43] course again is we're being dismissed
[2:08:44] what a day that will be will be when my
[2:08:54] Jesus I shall see when I love
[2:08:59] look upon his face the one who saved me
[2:09:05] by His grace when he takes me by the
[2:09:11] hand and leads me through
[2:09:16] the promised land
[2:09:18] and what a day glorious day
[2:09:24] there will be
[2:09:29] what a day that will be when my G
