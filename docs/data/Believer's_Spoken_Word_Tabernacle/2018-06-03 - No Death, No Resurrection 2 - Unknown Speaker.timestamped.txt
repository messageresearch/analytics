[36:19] potential to reality father you know
[36:22] Lord gone our lives you know what you

[36:28] you would help us Lord just to get out
[36:30] of the way and may our faith Lord for

[36:44] just help us to get out of the way as
[36:46] Speaker and here together Lord and
[36:48] father just have your way for every need
[36:52] Lord every life that's gathered here
[36:54] this morning Lord every one of us Lord
[36:57] we have need of you Lord different needs
[37:00] but yet we need you and you're the only
[37:02] one that can meet these needs Lord may
[37:05] we take those desires that we have on
[37:07] our heart Lord and know that God that
[37:10] that desire is not something we place
[37:12] there Lord
[37:12] but father there is a promise Lord that
[37:15] is ordained of God for that desire Lord
[37:18] that it might be fulfilled
[37:20] Lord we hold our hearts and our desires
[37:23] before you we give ourselves to you in
[37:26] the name of Jesus Christ
[37:28] amen amen Ephesians chapter 2 verse 14
[37:31] for he is our peace who hath made both
[37:39] one and has broken down the middle wall
[37:43] of partition between us that was a
[37:48] separation and we realized that we were
[37:51] separated from God
[37:54] the separation was by deception is that
[38:00] right Eve was not forced to do neither
[38:04] was Adam forced to do we understand that
[38:07] Eve was deceived and then Adam in the
[38:09] transgression but yet there was a wall
[38:12] between us
[38:14] anybody like walls I mean I like walls
[38:18] for the roundest building right here but
[38:21] y'all like walls in your home you like
[38:25] walls in the church everybody didn't
[38:28] quite you don't know what I'm going just
[38:31] asking questions I mean there are
[38:33] certain places I like walls to be and
[38:35] then there's other places we don't want
[38:37] walls to me is that right and this right
[38:41] here was a wall though not a physical
[38:43] wall but it was a spiritual wall that
[38:46] was hindering and keeping two from
[38:50] coming together there's only one that
[38:52] could take care of this it took one who
[38:53] was the greater aren't you glad for that
[38:57] he became one of us having abolished in
[39:02] his flesh the enmity even the law of
[39:07] Commandments contained in ordinances for
[39:11] to make in himself of Twain one new man
[39:17] so making peace so this is not the old
[39:20] creation made over this is a new
[39:23] creation not the old man it's a new man
[39:26] and that he might reconcile this word
[39:31] reconciled is a little different word
[39:34] than what's used in some of the other
[39:35] places this means fully that he might
[39:38] fully reconcile both unto God
[39:42] in one body by the cross having slain
[39:45] the enmity thereby and came and preached
[39:50] peace to you which were afar off and to
[39:53] them that were not a man you love him
[39:57] this morning may God bless you bless his
[39:59] word that your being seated look at this
[40:06] thought on reconciliation and when I
[40:11] look at this and just poring over it as
[40:13] we've been looking at these scriptures
[40:14] and they've been on my heart for months
[40:17] and months but you know it's kind of
[40:20] like when we we think of the term when
[40:23] we look at Redemption we know how that
[40:25] the Prophet brought it to light for you
[40:28] and I'm bringing examples from the Old
[40:30] Testament and he would give us the
[40:32] example of that of a pawnshop and I know
[40:35] there's pawnshops that we have around in
[40:37] our city and a lot of places have
[40:39] pawnshops and when we we think of that a
[40:42] pawnshop itself is things that where
[40:46] when someone would have a debt that
[40:49] arises and they need they need the money
[40:52] or they need something to pay off that
[40:53] debt so then they'll take whatever it is
[40:57] a possession and they will pawn that in
[41:00] order to get money from that but yet
[41:04] what was pawned when we look at it in
[41:06] terms bringing into the spiritual and
[41:08] redemption it's what has always belonged
[41:12] to God it was not God who pawned you and
[41:15] I off but we realized that our parents
[41:18] in the beginning not your parents that
[41:20] you and I would have or were born out
[41:22] but it was by an act that was done in
[41:25] the beginning that was not according to
[41:27] the divine will of God it was permissive
[41:29] will of God but not the divine and
[41:32] perfect will of God and and you and I
[41:34] today here we are we we still even with
[41:37] being born again of the Spirit of God
[41:39] you still battle the effects of that
[41:42] decision that was made back there we
[41:45] still we thank God for healing in our
[41:46] body and God knows we need healing but
[41:49] yet if we're healed here in our physical
[41:51] body we live long enough we're going to
[41:53] get sick again and we also think
[41:56] that for there is there is a real
[41:58] strength that can move within our lives
[42:01] to wear that even in our spirit realm
[42:03] because when you're depressed or you're
[42:05] down it's not your body that is down or
[42:07] depressed but it's your spirit man your
[42:10] emotions and then we're thankful to God
[42:12] that there can actually be a ministering
[42:14] within that spirit to actually help you
[42:17] and I come into a place to where that
[42:19] God can use us remember Elisha think of
[42:21] this for a moment
[42:22] Elisha was always God's prophet Elisha
[42:25] was always a true man of God but after
[42:28] he came off of Mount Carmel and his
[42:31] brother Brandon tells us like this he
[42:32] said the mind of Christ pulls back from
[42:34] him and Herald that Elisha goes into
[42:36] that cave when you look at where Elisha
[42:38] was that Elisha was in a place in a
[42:40] situation brother bran will say at many
[42:42] different places
[42:43] he was overworked he said he was
[42:45] overtired he goes into all of this
[42:47] regarding Elijah's life now even though
[42:50] Elisha was as predestinated as he was
[42:52] even though that he was divinely used by
[42:55] God he still did not take away that
[42:57] Elisha walked in a flesh body it still
[43:00] didn't take it away that he walked in a
[43:02] body but where in that flesh or that
[43:04] emotions could get down and we see that
[43:07] with Elisha where Elisha himself even
[43:09] speaking in that time perhaps like many
[43:12] of us have felt or maybe you feel that
[43:14] way this morning that Elisha said I'm
[43:16] the only one then we know that wasn't in
[43:18] God's speaking that was not even the
[43:21] prophetic gift within Elijah's life that
[43:23] was speaking but that was that man part
[43:25] in that part that you and I have to pack
[43:28] around but notice how God dealt with it
[43:30] God didn't say to him with this is
[43:32] foolishness what are you doing you're a
[43:34] prophet here but God worked with him to
[43:36] bring him in back to a place little by
[43:39] little he's calling him out of the cave
[43:42] and he works to bring him to a place to
[43:44] where that his spirit now is R is
[43:46] refreshed to where that now he's ready
[43:48] to listen God is helping him to come out
[43:51] of his depression if we could call it
[43:54] that way and you realized that within it
[43:56] this is such a time I could labor more
[43:58] on this here within this service but it
[44:01] just goes to show you and I and I trust
[44:03] we can take a glimpse of this that how
[44:05] that within our lives though our soul
[44:07] being redeemed but
[44:09] at all it puts us in a place of things
[44:11] that you and I or go through and things
[44:13] that come about in our life that it
[44:15] creates even more so in our life of
[44:18] Hungary for the redemption of our body
[44:20] because we realize that this body that
[44:23] we have now this is not my inheritance
[44:25] it's my possession and so it's there
[44:28] we're longing to come into that place to
[44:30] where that there will be no more times
[44:33] of or where you're down and no times
[44:35] where you need to take a time of rest to
[44:37] get off but yet there is a it so
[44:39] completely where everything sickness and
[44:42] everything else is gone and done away
[44:44] with and that what God has done in our
[44:47] soul is a witness of what we're going to
[44:49] we are waiting on the redemption of the
[44:52] body so reconciliation begins within and
[44:57] the final part and final stage for us is
[45:01] there even in the change of our body so
[45:05] we recognize this is it's an ongoing
[45:07] it's moving but when I think of this
[45:10] when one who stands in the pawnshop and
[45:12] how that God himself coming down he
[45:16] showed all of this many in many
[45:18] different places and redemptive types
[45:20] but he had there had to be a paying of
[45:23] the price and God himself as we looked
[45:25] at it God came down and he United with
[45:28] with his creation this creation was not
[45:31] a creation of Mary although it looked
[45:34] like creation that was already here he
[45:36] looked like any other man that had been
[45:39] here upon the earth or was there was
[45:41] nothing the Bible says no beauty that we
[45:44] should desire him but yet God came down
[45:47] and the reconciling began there at the
[45:50] River Jordan that's what makes that
[45:52] place where the Holy Spirit coming down
[45:55] to where now here is the Lamb of God and
[45:58] the Dove of God the nature's are lined
[46:01] up in order for there to be a uniting or
[46:03] reconciling and then from that we see as
[46:06] we're reading in the scripture and many
[46:08] of the places then there has to be a
[46:10] payment there's a need of a payment to
[46:13] be paid in order for us to be fully
[46:16] reconciled back to God or make a way for
[46:19] that full reconciliation so when he went
[46:22] pays it it's like when you would look at
[46:25] it when you have you know in a pawn shop
[46:27] there are things you know I haven't been
[46:29] to a lot of pawn shops but some places
[46:31] where I've been that there would be of
[46:33] like that where you can stand there and
[46:35] you can actually have the payment and
[46:38] when you make the payment on something
[46:40] and let's just say it's this
[46:41] handkerchief you can pretend whatever it
[46:43] is but here it is then it might be
[46:46] sitting right there on that bench like a
[46:47] counter but yet I must make a payment
[46:50] for that when I make a payment for it
[46:53] then I can move to thoroughly claim or
[46:57] redeem what it is that I have redeemed
[46:59] through payment when I make the
[47:02] transaction and I give them whether this
[47:03] five dollars or whatever when I give
[47:05] them that five dollars that is better I
[47:07] have redeemed it or reconciled it by
[47:10] payment but I must thoroughly redeem it
[47:13] or thoroughly fully reconcile it by
[47:16] bringing to me what it is that I've paid
[47:19] for it now let's look at this in the
[47:21] scripture in Romans chapter 5 verse 6
[47:24] for when we were yet without strength in
[47:27] due time Christ died for the ungodly for
[47:32] scarcely for a righteous man will one
[47:35] die yet peradventure for a good man some
[47:38] would even dare to die and right but God
[47:44] commendeth his love toward us in that
[47:48] while we were yet sinners Christ died
[47:52] for us there was nothing about us in the
[47:57] condition we were in that was welcoming
[48:01] but remember what he did the Bible
[48:04] listen this is not just words when the
[48:06] scripture says he endured the cross for
[48:09] the joy that was set before him the joy
[48:11] was not our n'gou leanness the joy was
[48:16] not that we were sinners are you in for
[48:18] me the joy was not that the joy was what
[48:22] it was that would actually through this
[48:24] death be able to release what he knew
[48:27] was there the whole time
[48:29] so you see it's got to have faith it's
[48:31] got to have confidence that's the same
[48:32] way it is even within your
[48:34] marriage it's the same way it is within
[48:36] the church it's the same way it is when
[48:38] you're working among people there has to
[48:40] be something that you're looking beyond
[48:42] and you can see all of this out here
[48:44] that's on this but yet within you're
[48:47] looking and saying God is there
[48:49] something helped me to see what is
[48:51] beyond because if we never see what it
[48:54] is that we are looking at what we hear
[48:56] or what we have seen or what we have
[48:58] heard we're never able to move beyond
[49:01] and actually come to this place how many
[49:04] of you believe this is the kind of life
[49:05] were to live I believe this with all my
[49:08] heart it wasn't just something to wear
[49:10] that he gave his self for us and then we
[49:13] would live such selfish lives about our
[49:15] emotions and our feelings and yet our
[49:17] emotions and our feelings are real but
[49:19] this is where the strength of God on the
[49:22] inside gives you an eye ability by the
[49:25] access of that divine nature to be able
[49:27] to bring our lives in subjection to say
[49:30] this is how I feel but this is what
[49:33] God's Word says and this is what my
[49:35] desire is and you start with that and
[49:38] you watch the Holy Spirit as you submit
[49:40] to that you watch the cleansing flow of
[49:42] the Spirit of God it's just like
[49:44] cleaning out an old wound if you don't
[49:46] clean out the wound the wound will
[49:48] eventually canker and you'll have to
[49:50] remove that part of the body but once
[49:52] it's cleaned there's got to be a flow of
[49:55] the water no wonder that the Lord Jesus
[49:58] would direct Moses there in the book of
[50:01] Exodus when he's talked about a Laver
[50:03] whereby met them priests in order to
[50:06] worship were to come in by that Laver
[50:08] and it must be filled with running water
[50:11] and the Laver was not something you
[50:13] dipped out of but it had a spigot at the
[50:15] bottom so that the running water source
[50:18] that was put in the Laver could actually
[50:21] come out so that the hands and the feet
[50:24] could be washed because our doings and
[50:27] our goings we constantly need to be
[50:30] washed by the water of the word one
[50:33] washing of the soul but continual
[50:37] washing while we were yet sinners Christ
[50:43] died for us
[50:45] much more than being
[50:48] now justified by his blood we shall be
[50:51] saved from wrath through him now watch
[50:55] this verse for if when we were enemies
[50:58] we were reconciled to God by the death
[51:03] of his son much more being reconciled we
[51:09] shall be saved by his life so you and
[51:12] our already reconciled as suarez payment
[51:16] the payment was rendered through the
[51:20] offering up of a perfect Lamb of God we
[51:23] were reconciled unto God in other words
[51:25] so that God Himself could begin to move
[51:29] and work within us bringing us into that
[51:32] redemptive work that was already done
[51:35] for us
[51:36] here's the word reconciled in this
[51:39] scripture it's to change or exchange as
[51:42] coins for others of equivalent value
[51:48] could you look at your life or me look
[51:51] at my life and say yes my life was was
[51:55] of equivalent to that of the Lord Jesus
[51:58] could you do that no you couldn't say
[52:01] that but yet down on the inside come on
[52:05] now he became one of us the Bible says
[52:10] it very clear over and over Hebrews
[52:12] chapter 2 for he is one with that of his
[52:16] brethren health which he is not ashamed
[52:19] to call them brother hallelujah so here
[52:24] he is he's coming to release by by
[52:27] Battle of the offering up of his life
[52:30] he's come to release in order that you
[52:33] and I might be dealt with and brought
[52:35] unto Him in full reconciliation Hinch to
[52:39] reconcile those who are at variance ah
[52:44] you know a person could read their Bible
[52:47] they could be ever so faithful at
[52:49] churches and everything else but yet if
[52:52] it's not been born again it's works and
[52:56] that's still emiti that still variance
[53:00] Paul says in enrollment
[53:02] that the carnal mind is enmity against
[53:06] God it cannot be subject and yet you
[53:08] could take of a carnal mind and the
[53:11] carnal mind says I do this I do this I
[53:13] do this we understand we believe it's
[53:15] something within your heart when you
[53:17] have been born of the Spirit of God you
[53:19] desire to please God you desire even
[53:22] when when God is he deals with your life
[53:24] a correction comes you desire to move
[53:27] within that but yet the carnal mind the
[53:30] carnal mind itself Paul said is enmity
[53:32] it can't be subject how can it not be
[53:35] subject and when it's doing this doing
[53:37] this doing this that's not the
[53:38] subjection God is looking for God does
[53:41] not want the subjection where ever I'm
[53:43] doing everything Lord on my life is
[53:45] every dot every gentle but God says what
[53:48] about your heart I don't want a wife
[53:53] who's afraid of me I don't want somebody
[53:56] who's doing something because out of
[53:58] fear it cannot be subject that word
[54:00] subject is the same one that Paul would
[54:03] use in relations of husband and wife
[54:05] that the wives be subject unto their
[54:09] husbands and all thing a voluntary
[54:12] attitude aren't you glad that he made a
[54:15] way for that but you know you don't have
[54:17] to walk and where it's enmity no matter
[54:19] what was done it was still enmity no
[54:21] matter how the Pharisees they were right
[54:23] on but yet it was still enmity
[54:27] Oh glory be to God so notice it must be
[54:32] his death in verse 11 it goes on to say
[54:34] and not only so but we also joy in God
[54:39] through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we
[54:42] have now received the atonement or the
[54:45] word there is fully reconciled so the
[54:51] payment was made but yet the Holy Spirit
[54:53] now because payment has been made the
[54:56] Holy Spirit comes down to actually claim
[54:59] or thoroughly redeem what he's already
[55:03] redeemed what shall abandon brings this
[55:06] in souls that are in prison now he
[55:09] speaks and he says you see in this book
[55:11] was what was redeemed it was the book
[55:15] of redemption and everything that he had
[55:17] redeemed was written in that book all
[55:19] that he died for was written in that
[55:23] book and he could not leave his
[55:26] mediatorial seat until he had thoroughly
[55:30] redeemed and he couldn't redeem it at
[55:33] the cross he couldn't redeem it at the
[55:35] cross no he did redeem it at the cross
[55:38] but he couldn't redeem it at the cross
[55:39] you see he paid the price
[55:41] but for redemption is where the Holy
[55:44] Spirit the doubt that led the lamb that
[55:47] same God now comes to bring you into
[55:50] complete fellowship with him that's
[55:54] thoroughly redeemed
[55:55] oh my until he had thoroughly redeemed
[56:00] and he couldn't redeem it at the cross
[56:02] because they were predestinated in the
[56:05] Lamb's Book of Life and he had to stay
[56:08] there look at this smile we could just
[56:10] preach so much on this he had to stay on
[56:13] there to make intercessions until that
[56:16] last person was finished glory he had to
[56:21] stay there he's still there this morning
[56:25] if I'm here I'll trust he's still there
[56:29] coz you and I would not survive a
[56:32] nanosecond without him but when he
[56:36] changes the garment it isn't that we
[56:38] willfully desire to do wrong but it's
[56:39] speaking that we must constantly have a
[56:42] mediator there the Spirit of God in our
[56:46] life ties us into the sacrifice and he's
[56:49] there on our behalf but when he changes
[56:53] the garment that day and he moves from
[56:56] lamb to lion
[56:57] there will come a change in our vesture
[57:00] we shall be changed as I write a man
[57:06] thoroughly redeemed I think of this
[57:09] ransoming work you and I were in need of
[57:12] redemption we were sold into slavery we
[57:18] didn't ask to come the way that we come
[57:20] there's a lot of scars and marks no
[57:22] doubt upon our lives we didn't ask for
[57:25] all but all of that here all of these
[57:27] things accumulate from that
[57:28] even of the fall but there was a need
[57:30] for a ransom there's a need for a ransom
[57:34] and how that God Himself coming down
[57:38] becomes the ransom because you and I
[57:41] were trapped and we couldn't get out we
[57:45] needed someone to trap to undo the trap
[57:49] that we were in but send you it sounds
[57:53] like you're saying that there was almost
[57:55] like two people in one sense absolutely
[57:58] there was a man a woman who was trapped
[58:01] down there on the inside and that's the
[58:03] one that he came to redeem he never came
[58:06] to highlight the fallen character but he
[58:09] came to break the clouds back so that
[58:12] the redeemable attribute of God could be
[58:15] displayed think about this in our life
[58:19] of how that our life was lived but yet
[58:21] he himself would move down by his death
[58:25] his death made a way if there was no
[58:29] death they were bidden been no uniting
[58:32] the sign of this is simple we we
[58:34] understand that we know that well
[58:36] evidently God wants us to hear it and I
[58:38] believe it replies much deeper than us
[58:40] just looking back at something of a
[58:42] story because it's over and over a
[58:45] matter of fact it's the theme of the
[58:47] whole scripture it is the book of
[58:49] redemption what we find in the end time
[58:52] is the Lamb himself coming forth not in
[58:55] part but in the very fullness to take
[58:58] the book and here he is revealing
[59:00] himself and making knowing himself to
[59:02] his attributes in the last age yet at
[59:05] the same time he's fixing to make the
[59:08] final transition because this is the
[59:10] finishing up of the mystery of God there
[59:13] will be no other age to the Gentiles
[59:15] there'll be no other message there'll be
[59:17] no other time this is the final time
[59:20] this is that moment think of this and
[59:24] the message the first seal he said the
[59:26] lamb in the time of intercessory was
[59:29] back here he knew that there were names
[59:32] in there that was put in there from the
[59:34] foundation of the world and as long as
[59:37] them names had never been manifested on
[59:40] earth as you
[59:41] now watch this had never been manifested
[59:44] on earth as yet he had to stay there as
[59:49] an intercessor so until that name you
[59:54] mean you mean when I was actually born
[59:56] and my mom and dad no no that's not
[59:58] that's not the name we're talking about
[1:00:00] that's not the manifestation that he was
[1:00:03] waiting on he had to stay there because
[1:00:07] he came to die for those that God had
[1:00:11] ordained to eternal life by his
[1:00:14] foreknowledge he saw them not by his own
[1:00:17] will now this is big his will was that
[1:00:20] none should perish but by his
[1:00:22] foreknowledge he knew who would and who
[1:00:25] would not remember there are many that
[1:00:28] will have look at this this book this is
[1:00:30] the book of redemption it's also the
[1:00:32] book of life you with me there's things
[1:00:35] that you can look at scriptures right
[1:00:37] here in this book and God by His grace
[1:00:39] you are illuminated not just to know it
[1:00:42] not just to quote it but it's
[1:00:44] illuminated in your life but yet there's
[1:00:46] others that can look at those same
[1:00:48] scriptures and it doesn't have the same
[1:00:50] meaning to them it doesn't have the same
[1:00:52] depth what is it it's the same book but
[1:00:54] it shows there's two sections within the
[1:00:58] same book are you with me there is depth
[1:01:01] levels of depth amen therefore he said
[1:01:07] as long as there was one name had never
[1:01:11] been declared in earth Christ had to
[1:01:14] stay there as an intercessor to take
[1:01:16] care of that name aren't you glad I'll
[1:01:19] tell you one reason the rapture couldn't
[1:01:21] go before cuz that name for me had not
[1:01:23] been declared well what about you what
[1:01:28] about saying if the rapture would have
[1:01:29] come you know God would just come down
[1:01:31] no no no no no no it can't work that way
[1:01:33] he's God he made a way so that you could
[1:01:37] be drawn to him not forced not forced
[1:01:42] he's not driving you he's calling you
[1:01:48] hallelujah he's not pushing he's leading
[1:01:52] the sons of God are pushed by the Spirit
[1:01:55] of God no they're led by the Spirit of
[1:01:58] God amen
[1:02:00] oh my Christ had to stay there as an
[1:02:03] intercessor to take care of that name
[1:02:05] but as soon as that final name had been
[1:02:08] splashed in that Clorox or bleach then
[1:02:12] his intercessory days was over now the
[1:02:15] Bloods already been shed they're right
[1:02:17] the price has already been paid but the
[1:02:19] splashing of the name in that Clorox
[1:02:22] bleach is when the Holy Spirit has
[1:02:25] drugged you through every stage and
[1:02:28] every process to where the name that
[1:02:31] characteristic of the word that's a
[1:02:33] corresponding part in this hour when
[1:02:35] that has been raised up and been
[1:02:37] quickened then it's been splashed
[1:02:40] thoroughly redeemed and when it's been
[1:02:43] thoroughly redeemed you're sealed unto
[1:02:46] the day of the redemption there's no
[1:02:48] going back there's no desire to go back
[1:02:52] the only place you want to go back is
[1:02:55] where you come from well glory let him
[1:03:01] that's filthy be filthy still let him
[1:03:03] that's holy be holy still
[1:03:05] and he leaves the sanctuary and then it
[1:03:07] becomes a judgment seat woe unto those
[1:03:12] outside of Christ in so we're led here
[1:03:19] here is the Lamb of God he's led the
[1:03:21] Bible says he's led as a lamb to the
[1:03:26] slaughter he became the way it's very
[1:03:31] familiar Scripture it's quoted it's in
[1:03:34] our Christian bookstores if you still
[1:03:35] got one around where you live I am the
[1:03:38] way the truth and the life but as we
[1:03:41] said you know we look at it before if
[1:03:43] that door is the way out of here that is
[1:03:47] the way now they're right out of here
[1:03:50] out of this building there are multiple
[1:03:51] ways you can go out but there's not
[1:03:54] multiple ways into the kingdom of God
[1:03:57] there is one way
[1:04:00] and he said I am V wave remember man
[1:04:05] could not get back in where man had been
[1:04:09] exiled from the very presence of God God
[1:04:12] man could not get back in but God come
[1:04:16] down and he removed the middle wall of
[1:04:19] partition by becoming one of us Oh glory
[1:04:26] be to God you see when we look at it the
[1:04:29] real you and the real me was dead
[1:04:35] the real me was not alive the real you
[1:04:39] was not alive you see this is not a dead
[1:04:42] and then racing up the old man again no
[1:04:45] no no no we don't want that old man
[1:04:47] raised up there's got to be a new man
[1:04:51] not the old man and when the new man
[1:04:55] comes in the new man has authority over
[1:04:57] the old man hallelujah
[1:05:01] you know 1 we don't want the old man we
[1:05:03] want that new man we want that new man
[1:05:06] to be the one who's on display glory be
[1:05:09] to God now think of this here he made a
[1:05:12] way by our own free will because as the
[1:05:15] Lamb and we look back and they've at the
[1:05:17] beginning we mentioned moments ago Eve
[1:05:19] herself was not forced into it it was
[1:05:22] deception but yet by her own free will
[1:05:24] she gave up himself and the same when
[1:05:27] you look now with Adam Adam was not
[1:05:28] deceived but Adam by his own free will a
[1:05:32] desire in order to redeem her but yet
[1:05:35] when we look at this and we bring it
[1:05:37] down we know that it must be a
[1:05:40] willingness on our part you know that's
[1:05:41] the whole that's the whole of the
[1:05:43] Christian life is willingness I mean
[1:05:47] know that's the truth God's desire is
[1:05:50] all willingness when the prophet will
[1:05:52] preach the message token you'll find
[1:05:54] that he'll mention in inner and
[1:05:56] interject points throughout the message
[1:05:58] coming around clear at the end he'll
[1:06:00] speak of the token also been medicine
[1:06:02] that you need to take let me tell you
[1:06:04] something you not only need to take that
[1:06:06] medicine when you yourself have that of
[1:06:09] a soul problem but you also need to take
[1:06:12] that medicine
[1:06:13] continuing to live of that tokin life
[1:06:15] and apply it to every situation in your
[1:06:19] life
[1:06:20] it isn't this medicine well it took care
[1:06:23] of my soul I'll go find something else
[1:06:24] now to help me take care of my spirit
[1:06:26] help me take care of my body but we
[1:06:28] realized God can work for many other
[1:06:30] ways but yet it's the medicine that God
[1:06:33] has provided for you and I this age
[1:06:35] you'd know it as well as I do it's an
[1:06:37] unfit late age for Humanity to live in
[1:06:41] there's things where you are sometimes
[1:06:44] here you're up here you're down I'm not
[1:06:46] talking about being in and out of church
[1:06:47] I'm talking about even in your emotional
[1:06:49] makeup that has nothing to do with you
[1:06:51] being a weak Christian or being a one
[1:06:53] who's not in victory did you speaks of
[1:06:55] the humanity of where you're at in this
[1:06:58] age and especially with all the
[1:07:00] complexities of this time it is all
[1:07:02] mounted up but yet God made a way that
[1:07:06] you and I Winnie ministers to us and if
[1:07:08] there's things that we see within our
[1:07:10] life he will come and deal and move in
[1:07:13] our life if there's a willingness I want
[1:07:16] you think of this if you've got
[1:07:18] something against somebody else you know
[1:07:20] God won't move that out of your heart
[1:07:21] you got to be willing you've got to be
[1:07:25] willing you have to no matter how much
[1:07:28] it's preached on you've got to be
[1:07:30] willing but you see the preaching and
[1:07:33] the ministering of the word is to
[1:07:35] bringing you and I into that place where
[1:07:37] it's placing that giving authority to
[1:07:40] the new man to put that old man in
[1:07:42] subjection not just here on these
[1:07:44] grounds but everywhere you go and in
[1:07:47] your home mama he is that way notice
[1:07:54] Jesus would even speak in his word many
[1:07:57] many places coming to me all you that
[1:07:59] are heavy laden and I will give the
[1:08:01] arrest the Reverend did the work of
[1:08:04] redemption was already paid think of it
[1:08:06] even those who were ones who were true
[1:08:09] followers of John's message and they
[1:08:12] were there in acts 19 and they were
[1:08:14] waiting on the fulfilment of the
[1:08:17] atonement and when Paul came and began
[1:08:20] to minister concerning that he realized
[1:08:22] they hadn't received the Holy Ghost yet
[1:08:25] payment had
[1:08:26] already been made so that they couldn't
[1:08:28] receive it well why didn't they just
[1:08:30] receive it if God already made a payment
[1:08:33] why didn't he just give it to him
[1:08:34] because it's comes by willingness
[1:08:38] willingness he wants to bring our will
[1:08:43] in line with his will he will not he's a
[1:08:47] gentleman he will not override he must
[1:08:51] bring it in line God knows how to kill
[1:08:55] that old man he knows how to kill him he
[1:09:00] knows how to lure and bring him into a
[1:09:02] place to where he can move down and
[1:09:05] really put the death hold on him but it
[1:09:09] is it's where the man himself where you
[1:09:11] and I come to that place where we no
[1:09:13] longer want to live that life we no
[1:09:18] longer we're tired it's not just that
[1:09:19] life but we're tired of the life our
[1:09:22] desire is I want to serve Him you see
[1:09:25] serving God it's not about what will
[1:09:27] help you and be a better person out in
[1:09:29] society lord I need to be saved because
[1:09:32] this drinking problem I think that's
[1:09:34] wonderful for somebody to be free from
[1:09:36] drinking but that's not what Redemption
[1:09:37] is all about Redemption is about
[1:09:40] completely free you into the very
[1:09:43] service of Almighty God God's design
[1:09:47] listen Redemption is not that you become
[1:09:50] some great moral person I believe that
[1:09:53] Redemption when it moves into your life
[1:09:55] it will produce that but it's not just
[1:09:58] about having good morality
[1:10:00] I heard of saying one time so true good
[1:10:03] morality will keep you out of jail but
[1:10:05] it takes the blood of Jesus Christ to
[1:10:07] keep you out of hell it's more this
[1:10:10] message did not come to produce good
[1:10:13] people it came to transform lies now the
[1:10:19] Prophet warns us in Christ the mystery
[1:10:21] he said many people they take
[1:10:23] Christianity and say we will make
[1:10:25] converts by it's governments Muslims do
[1:10:31] the same thing
[1:10:34] Muslims do the same thing Muslims got a
[1:10:36] profit they can claim that but you see
[1:10:38] this isn't about making converts by
[1:10:40] governments the word must be preached
[1:10:45] and the word will have an effect in it
[1:10:47] will draw upon the heart and the life of
[1:10:50] the believer hallelujah so the Lamb of
[1:10:54] God Himself made a way that the lambs
[1:10:56] could come forth I always think of how
[1:11:01] that God told Paul when Paul was getting
[1:11:03] ready to run out of Corinth you know
[1:11:05] Paul wanted out of there I mean it was a
[1:11:07] bad bad place but God told him and said
[1:11:09] you stay here I ain't gonna let no man
[1:11:11] touch you I got much people in this city
[1:11:13] well Lord if you got much people I mean
[1:11:17] didn't you just die for them didn't get
[1:11:19] me can't the Holy Ghost just come no
[1:11:21] it's got to be willingly they've got to
[1:11:23] respond to the gospel of their salvation
[1:11:27] you see it's a jubilee call whereby the
[1:11:31] atonement has been made but as the
[1:11:34] atonement was made there within the
[1:11:36] tabernacle there was a priest who was a
[1:11:39] free man that would ride through the
[1:11:42] land sounding the trumpet but there is
[1:11:45] an offering that has been made and you
[1:11:48] can go free so the sounding of that
[1:11:51] trumpet was actually the throw and
[1:11:54] release of the blood life to let the
[1:11:57] people know you can stop right now what
[1:12:00] you're doing and go free that's a real
[1:12:04] Jubilee Oh glory spoke a words original
[1:12:09] seed he said there he was he was God's
[1:12:12] Word made manifest he died in order to
[1:12:17] pay the debt of your high breeding there
[1:12:20] it is he said what it is that you could
[1:12:23] die to yourself until you're no more
[1:12:26] yourself and be filled with his word
[1:12:28] believing his word and then the Holy
[1:12:31] Spirit was in him comes down to water
[1:12:34] that word to make it grow so his death
[1:12:39] made a way for us to die Munro's I read
[1:12:43] it to you some weeks ago out of the
[1:12:44] message north or not
[1:12:45] Villa Ram tells us you know how is
[1:12:47] over and over we realized when he died
[1:12:49] we were there in him and we died also we
[1:12:52] died to our pride we dived and died and
[1:12:54] all all of these different things and
[1:12:55] the Prophet picks it up and says right
[1:12:57] there what took place at Calvary
[1:12:59] it was broadcasting of what was going to
[1:13:02] take place with all the seed but there
[1:13:04] was going to be a death of dying out but
[1:13:07] there would be a resurrection of that
[1:13:10] life that was hidden there the whole
[1:13:13] time
[1:13:14] to be to God oma think of this what is
[1:13:19] it he said God is manifesting continuing
[1:13:22] the work of his first son his only
[1:13:26] begotten see that died for our high
[1:13:28] breeding life that he might reconcile us
[1:13:31] back to be sons and daughters of God
[1:13:35] that through the church might flow the
[1:13:39] same life by the word continuing the
[1:13:43] work being manifested as it was in
[1:13:46] Christ I think of this God's purpose and
[1:13:51] his desire remember how Paul would pray
[1:13:55] in Ephesians he spoke of it in the first
[1:13:58] part of Colossians spoke of it in inter
[1:14:00] and Thessalonians the desire was that
[1:14:02] the full purpose itself would be
[1:14:05] expressed through the lives of believers
[1:14:08] as sons and daughters of God all all of
[1:14:14] the land every one of those parts of the
[1:14:16] land remember when they were born
[1:14:18] those patriarchs that hear their
[1:14:22] mother's utter doubt and their name gave
[1:14:25] them position in the land although
[1:14:28] they're down there in bondage and
[1:14:30] they're down there they were brought
[1:14:31] into that bondage but there had to be
[1:14:34] one ransom and get them out is that
[1:14:38] right and then as they come out not here
[1:14:40] there's been a price that's been paid
[1:14:42] but yet God does not just you know move
[1:14:45] back everything and God remove it there
[1:14:48] are tests and there are trials along the
[1:14:50] way there are things that comes up that
[1:14:52] God remembered what it says in the book
[1:14:53] of Deuteronomy he desired to prove them
[1:14:56] and humble them to
[1:14:58] what was in my heart did God not know
[1:15:00] what was in the heart God did but God
[1:15:02] desired because God's not going to
[1:15:04] falsely accuse come on somebody
[1:15:08] hallelujah God once let's see what
[1:15:11] manifests within the heart
[1:15:13] so God allows conditions itself to
[1:15:16] manifest what is there and even when it
[1:15:19] came down to God sending all having
[1:15:21] Moses send the spies
[1:15:23] over into the land now remember God
[1:15:25] could have just brought them right on in
[1:15:26] they could have just kept on walking the
[1:15:28] waters would have parted right open they
[1:15:30] could have walked right in
[1:15:31] but God let it be known that this is a
[1:15:34] greater decision you see they made a
[1:15:36] decision even all the mixed multitude
[1:15:38] that came out of Egypt they made an
[1:15:40] initial decision is that right they
[1:15:43] heard a call they made an initial
[1:15:44] decision they came out into the
[1:15:46] wilderness and then even after God
[1:15:48] moving there in the wilderness we
[1:15:50] realized that there were things that
[1:15:51] were cut away and removed from them
[1:15:53] their ornaments they removed their
[1:15:54] ornaments we see how God is dealing with
[1:15:56] them sanctifying them but yet there
[1:15:58] comes to that place before the crossing
[1:16:01] over there at the River Jordan where
[1:16:03] there is a need for a greater
[1:16:05] consecration and a greater
[1:16:06] sanctification because now notice this
[1:16:09] willingness it must be complete
[1:16:12] willingness that the people of God will
[1:16:14] come into their inheritance even though
[1:16:16] that inheritance all of those who live
[1:16:19] there in that time they could say that
[1:16:21] that's my inheritance right there that's
[1:16:22] my inheritance right there but yet
[1:16:24] you've got to come the provided way
[1:16:27] there's already been a price paid but
[1:16:30] notice God cannot manifest and reveal
[1:16:33] what's in your life really in the
[1:16:36] wilderness he can only reveal when it
[1:16:39] gets in position in the land because
[1:16:42] then his life can flow over that
[1:16:45] potential and bring it to reality how
[1:16:49] many say Lord flow
[1:16:51] help me Lord let it flow because that
[1:16:55] flow in the land is not just automatic
[1:16:57] it's not just the Ruby company or
[1:16:59] puppets and we're just you know moved
[1:17:01] around by strings and know we've got
[1:17:03] decisions to make as Paul could say
[1:17:06] yield your members yield I thought it
[1:17:12] was automatic no no you yield your
[1:17:15] members as instruments unto
[1:17:19] righteousness oh mama
[1:17:22] now notice this oh ma we come to this
[1:17:27] place the ramen goes on and talking
[1:17:30] about it and he says this is in
[1:17:33] paragraph 207 if you know you got it
[1:17:35] back there he said the Bible has got to
[1:17:37] be in you the word is a seed as long as
[1:17:40] it's laying here it won't do nothing but
[1:17:44] when it comes in here when it comes in
[1:17:46] the heart then it begins to manifest by
[1:17:48] the Holy Spirit
[1:17:49] the works of God then visions come power
[1:17:52] comes humility comes all your
[1:17:57] know-it-all is gone that's right amen
[1:18:05] all your know-it-all might know it all
[1:18:08] is gone well by the Samuel there's a lot
[1:18:12] of sir still some know-it-alls that I've
[1:18:13] got as everybody else does here in the
[1:18:15] room but yet once you've got that new
[1:18:19] man on the inside
[1:18:20] you've got authority to catch them
[1:18:25] know-it-alls because everything that
[1:18:29] comes out of you and I is not just boys
[1:18:31] just flowing like the roses everything
[1:18:34] every thought I tell you if I thought
[1:18:36] this it must be the Holy Ghost they
[1:18:38] don't mean that at all all you are know
[1:18:43] at all is gone you become nothing Christ
[1:18:47] becomes alive you die he lives there it
[1:18:52] is because he died I live when I die he
[1:18:55] lives again and when I die
[1:18:58] he promised me life and I die out
[1:19:01] to myself so in order I can have his
[1:19:04] life how do I do it
[1:19:07] look at these great big astounding words
[1:19:10] by taking his word his seed put his seed
[1:19:17] in here by faith and believe it and then
[1:19:20] it produces exactly what the Bible said
[1:19:26] now think of how that when the Lord
[1:19:29] Jesus here when he comes here on the
[1:19:32] earth and you know think of it here on
[1:19:35] the very first the doctrine and really
[1:19:37] the heart and soul of redemption him
[1:19:40] making a way so that you and I can be
[1:19:43] born again and he's speaking to a
[1:19:44] learning man my by the name of
[1:19:46] Nicodemus and he tells him except a man
[1:19:50] be born again he cannot see the kingdom
[1:19:55] of God you know it's like looking at
[1:20:00] something and it can be right here in
[1:20:01] your face and you don't see it unless a
[1:20:07] man is born again he cannot understand
[1:20:10] the kingdom of God he has to go upon
[1:20:15] different things that he can make it or
[1:20:17] what is made to him you know he can look
[1:20:19] and say well they say it's this or they
[1:20:21] say it's that but it must be by a
[1:20:24] personal experience of the king of this
[1:20:28] kingdom to where now an understanding it
[1:20:32] moves into that life not that you
[1:20:34] understand every single thing but it's
[1:20:37] where there is there is a sight that
[1:20:39] goes beyond this world and there's an
[1:20:41] understanding where God himself he's
[1:20:43] opening his self to you and there is a
[1:20:46] communication a channel that is divinely
[1:20:49] opened between you and God and how that
[1:20:52] God will speak to your heart and you
[1:20:54] look into your life and in the very
[1:20:56] depths of your soul there has been a
[1:20:59] real experience now listen for me now
[1:21:01] there has been a real experience
[1:21:03] remember this is the baptism of the Holy
[1:21:06] Ghost without sensation there's a lot of
[1:21:10] sensations but listen friends it must
[1:21:12] translate in
[1:21:14] to a real experience and when you've got
[1:21:17] an experience you've come from somewhere
[1:21:20] to where you are now there has been a
[1:21:23] passing from death unto life nothing
[1:21:27] wrong with sensations but it's got to
[1:21:29] produce a live battle tally up with the
[1:21:32] word that is an experience that you are
[1:21:35] no longer the same no no it wasn't that
[1:21:42] it was done away with emotion that's not
[1:21:44] what the Prophet was preaching that's
[1:21:46] not what he was laying out he was having
[1:21:48] us so that look where is that right now
[1:21:50] here we find in this hour it's the time
[1:21:53] for the headstone to come and the Bible
[1:21:55] said that Zerubbabel have laid the
[1:21:57] foundation and Zerubbabel will bring
[1:21:59] forth the capstone remember zerubabbel
[1:22:01] is the one who holds the plummet in his
[1:22:04] hand he holds the plumb line and
[1:22:06] remember what was being measured out was
[1:22:09] the very City of Jerusalem which the
[1:22:11] city of Jerusalem is that type of Zion
[1:22:14] the Brian is that right and we see that
[1:22:17] even from the Book of Revelations but
[1:22:19] notice the plumb line everything itself
[1:22:22] must be right in line and God would have
[1:22:25] a ministry in this hour the finishing
[1:22:27] out of what he himself started and he
[1:22:30] himself threw the ball who said I will
[1:22:33] build my church
[1:22:34] he is the capping of this church he has
[1:22:37] inspired his messengers he has inspired
[1:22:40] the ministry he has inspired the lively
[1:22:44] stones that are part of this habitation
[1:22:47] all the way down through the ages and
[1:22:50] now he stands in this hour
[1:22:52] it cannot be crooked in one place but it
[1:22:55] must be the plumb line it must be
[1:22:57] dovetail with the word in order for the
[1:23:01] dog to come down it's got to be a lamb
[1:23:03] nature and that's why here the very
[1:23:07] fullness of the person of Jesus Christ
[1:23:10] once again here in Brad form it is the
[1:23:14] son of man in the bride's body
[1:23:18] he's been building this whole time
[1:23:25] except a man be born again and Nicodemus
[1:23:30] this guy was a smart guy
[1:23:34] a smart fella he said how in the world
[1:23:38] can somebody enter into his mother's
[1:23:39] wombs a second time
[1:23:42] you wouldn't do no good anyhow you could
[1:23:46] look back to listen to me you can look
[1:23:48] back on your life and say man I'm five
[1:23:50] I'll tell you what there's things back
[1:23:51] there I wish I had never done sure
[1:23:53] everybody right across this building say
[1:23:55] how I wish there's things here I wish
[1:23:56] there's things there because even though
[1:23:58] after God has done such a work in your
[1:23:59] life you still have that memory yes sir
[1:24:06] but notice even within that even if you
[1:24:10] could go back and everything that you
[1:24:13] ever done wrong you actually had the
[1:24:15] opportunity to say hey go back and this
[1:24:18] you can correct this and correct this
[1:24:19] and correct this that steal would not be
[1:24:22] acceptable because whether you did
[1:24:25] anything or not you still had to be born
[1:24:30] again no matter except the man look at
[1:24:39] Jesus given the formula except a man be
[1:24:41] born of water and of the Spirit the word
[1:24:46] and the spirit come together he cannot
[1:24:51] enter into the kingdom of God so even
[1:24:56] though we are called to enter our inter
[1:24:59] is by willingness but remember he
[1:25:03] himself must be the one to bring us into
[1:25:07] that place of complete submission
[1:25:10] because if you did it or I did it
[1:25:12] there's glory on our part but he himself
[1:25:15] looked that's the same way with the
[1:25:17] rapture
[1:25:17] it's not us in our own cells of mine I'm
[1:25:21] really bringing myself in submission no
[1:25:23] no it's him it's his power
[1:25:26] it's his working that's bringing us into
[1:25:29] submission to believe things
[1:25:31] that you can look at and say I don't
[1:25:33] know if that's true about me or not but
[1:25:35] he's seeing deeper and my only preaching
[1:25:40] the five today or what I know I'm
[1:25:42] preaching angels but it's him working by
[1:25:47] his word to bring you and I into
[1:25:50] submission so that we think it not
[1:25:52] robbery to be equal with God ma not
[1:26:00] which is born of the flesh is flesh and
[1:26:02] that which is born of the Spirit is
[1:26:03] spirit Marvel not that I said unto you
[1:26:05] you must be born again now look at this
[1:26:09] program says it like this and it wasn't
[1:26:11] so for in the beginning I love this he
[1:26:14] said every man's got to be born again
[1:26:16] and this sinful nature killed in him and
[1:26:19] a new man born in him which is Christ
[1:26:23] Jesus the Son of God then you surrender
[1:26:26] yourself completely to Christ and Christ
[1:26:28] comes in and writes a book of Acts
[1:26:32] through you Lord don't you want me
[1:26:36] co-author no oh maybe you want me to be
[1:26:39] the editor no I just want you to be the
[1:26:43] vessel I want you to simply be the cover
[1:26:49] the cover but bad your skin come on
[1:26:54] somebody that I can write my book of
[1:26:57] Acts through you now remember the book
[1:27:01] of Acts every day one the miracle day
[1:27:04] there was times the trials then there
[1:27:09] was times where the Bible says and the
[1:27:10] churches had rest then there was times
[1:27:14] of trials and then there was times where
[1:27:18] a great man of God Apostle Paul where
[1:27:22] people were healed mightily in his
[1:27:24] ministry where that there was even that
[1:27:27] demons were cast out mighty men of God
[1:27:30] and then there times that God will have
[1:27:33] you let down in a basket
[1:27:37] why less this guy gets exalted well
[1:27:45] every time I pray I'd see we're going to
[1:27:50] be praying for you pretty shortly Lord
[1:27:54] given patience help them be
[1:27:55] long-suffering lord help him stand
[1:27:58] faithful Lord while they're waiting on
[1:27:59] an answer how about just say every time
[1:28:04] I pray I believe he hears me when he
[1:28:08] answers that's up to him
[1:28:13] notice the Lord Jesus says it like this
[1:28:15] I'm trying to come down here the Lord
[1:28:17] Jesus says it like this in Matthew 9 16
[1:28:20] no man putteth a piece of new cloth unto
[1:28:24] an old garment for bad which is put into
[1:28:27] it fill up to fill it up taketh from the
[1:28:30] garment and the rent is made worse
[1:28:34] anybody have to wear patches on their
[1:28:36] jeans man I use mom my mom used to make
[1:28:41] me wear patches I got a brand new pair
[1:28:42] of jeans and she put patches on before I
[1:28:44] could ever get holes in them you know
[1:28:46] I'm talking about why they last longer
[1:28:48] here I was walking around with their
[1:28:49] patches you know them double knee things
[1:28:51] you could crawl around on rocks and them
[1:28:53] patches were harder than the rocks I
[1:28:56] probably still have a pair of them jeans
[1:28:58] today it might only be the patches left
[1:29:02] 4s them it's already disintegrated but
[1:29:04] you look at their patches it takes away
[1:29:06] I like a good patchwork quilt ones nice
[1:29:12] and warm
[1:29:12] I don't like a real quilt I know about
[1:29:15] them fake imitation ones I'm talking
[1:29:17] with a nice quilt but you know if you
[1:29:19] had a nice here you had maybe let's just
[1:29:21] say on this wall this white wall and
[1:29:23] then you just put like some type of blue
[1:29:25] and you looked at you thought what in
[1:29:26] the world
[1:29:27] brother rich are you all gonna paint
[1:29:29] that or you gonna take care of that that
[1:29:31] looks horrible don't want a blemish
[1:29:33] you see God doesn't want to just do
[1:29:36] patchwork he don't want to just do
[1:29:41] patchwork he wants to release his
[1:29:44] victory in you and that that victory
[1:29:47] might be made manifest in your life this
[1:29:49] not putting down it's calling you up
[1:29:53] neither do men look at this neither do
[1:29:56] men put new wine into old bottles else
[1:29:59] the bottles break and the wine runneth
[1:30:02] out and the bottles perish but they put
[1:30:05] new wine into new bottles and both are
[1:30:08] preserved the new line where does the
[1:30:12] new one come the new one comes with a
[1:30:14] new man it's got to be a new man and
[1:30:17] then that wine on the inside of the Holy
[1:30:20] Ghost oh my it's producing it's growing
[1:30:23] it's moving within our life what's
[1:30:26] they're doing it's bringing forth what
[1:30:27] is potential to reality look at this in
[1:30:32] Costas chapter one verse 20 having made
[1:30:34] peace through the blood of his cross by
[1:30:36] him to reconcile all things unto himself
[1:30:39] by him I say whether they be things in
[1:30:42] earth or things in heaven and you that
[1:30:45] were sometimes alienated and enemies
[1:30:48] sometime sometime at one time alienated
[1:30:54] and enemies in your mind where were your
[1:30:57] enemies and alienated in your mind by
[1:31:01] wicked works yet now hath he reconciled
[1:31:05] in the body of his flesh through death
[1:31:08] to present you holy and unblameable and
[1:31:14] Unruh provable in his sight who this
[1:31:18] word present I love this word this word
[1:31:20] present means to bring one and place him
[1:31:23] by his side no wonder he told Moses
[1:31:28] there is a place to present you who's
[1:31:36] you the real you the real you the new
[1:31:41] man not the old man but to present you
[1:31:45] the new man holy unblameable Unruh
[1:31:49] provable but see you look at and you
[1:31:51] think but this is what I did and I did
[1:31:54] this and I did this and I prayed and
[1:31:56] asked y'all to forgive me you did ask
[1:31:58] God to forgive you that's exactly right
[1:32:00] there had to be repentance but
[1:32:02] remember it wasn't the real you that did
[1:32:05] it the real you was still dead the real
[1:32:15] you was still dead
[1:32:18] but remember listen to me now
[1:32:21] God is not an adulterer he cannot marry
[1:32:28] you if you've got a living husband there
[1:32:32] right so he has to kill or there has to
[1:32:36] be a death to that God in Haran will hit
[1:32:38] man Ngati Hine go hit man God didn't say
[1:32:44] let me get a life insurance policy for
[1:32:45] how hitman holder live good know
[1:32:48] everything is is so designed to bring
[1:32:53] you into that place to where you die to
[1:32:55] that first husband it's not just
[1:32:59] divorced divorcing good enough divorced
[1:33:02] thing good enough but there has to be a
[1:33:07] death and when there's a death then you
[1:33:11] can be married David could not take
[1:33:15] Abigail until May ball nay bell was dead
[1:33:20] was right but Nabal died in his heart
[1:33:25] when it was whispered to him David and
[1:33:28] his men he died within his heart she
[1:33:32] herself was announcing David's coming
[1:33:36] David is present and a Bible says
[1:33:39] immediately in his heart
[1:33:44] hallelujah oh my how we can stand there
[1:33:47] like a real Abigail this morning and
[1:33:50] saying the king is coming he's already
[1:33:53] come here but he's coming oh my and you
[1:33:59] holding unblameable Unruh provable in
[1:34:02] his sight oh my look at this here this
[1:34:08] for a moment in the message communion
[1:34:11] man I love this
[1:34:14] levin talks about these two books he
[1:34:17] says like this book here the two books
[1:34:19] being worn the book of life the first
[1:34:22] book of life coming up was when you were
[1:34:24] born
[1:34:24] that was your natural birth then one
[1:34:28] time way back down in there there was a
[1:34:31] little grain of life as I was explaining
[1:34:34] to some young sisters at the house this
[1:34:36] afternoon there's a little grain of life
[1:34:38] laying there that you wonder where did
[1:34:43] it come from what these strange things I
[1:34:46] was saying this taking for myself like
[1:34:49] II was going to say William Branham well
[1:34:51] forty years ago the william branham it
[1:34:55] isn't the same one tonight you see
[1:34:59] that's the testimony that Christ brings
[1:35:02] in the life he's not the same one
[1:35:05] tonight that he was before
[1:35:07] if someone back there would say William
[1:35:09] Branham he was a rank rascal see because
[1:35:14] I was born of Charles and Ella Brennan
[1:35:16] in their nature I was a sinner I came to
[1:35:21] the world a liar and all the habits of
[1:35:23] the world laid right in me you remember
[1:35:26] the RAM was talking about one of his
[1:35:27] nephews you don't know it to be his
[1:35:28] nephew but that's exactly who it was the
[1:35:31] one of them the young man who was
[1:35:33] actually within it that he himself you
[1:35:36] know brother Ram begins to tell us and
[1:35:38] the message paradox he has this strain
[1:35:40] coming from that of the father and this
[1:35:42] of the mother all these natural
[1:35:43] attributes that are coming down and
[1:35:46] brother Ram begins to talk to the mom
[1:35:48] and Daddy and brother man tells tells
[1:35:50] him and said that boy needs to be born
[1:35:52] again and the daddy said but brother
[1:35:55] branham he's come to the tabernacle he's
[1:35:58] been baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:36:00] Jesus Christ with REM says that may be
[1:36:03] all well and good he said but that Myung
[1:36:04] Man still needs to be born again you see
[1:36:07] what it was there were things that were
[1:36:09] the Prophet now look at this there are
[1:36:11] things that the Holy Spirit was able to
[1:36:14] pick up and point out that there was
[1:36:17] something that still wasn't dead I'm
[1:36:19] telling you friends he might have seen
[1:36:21] while he was this he was that it might
[1:36:22] have seemed like this guy he was a
[1:36:24] humble guy or this
[1:36:25] but there was still something there
[1:36:27] about that first nature that was
[1:36:29] prevailing to where the Prophet could
[1:36:31] say he needs to be born again I thank
[1:36:36] God for honesty like that don't you this
[1:36:39] young man he was riding the tabernacle
[1:36:41] he'd been baptized in the name of the
[1:36:42] Lord Jesus Christ but he had not been
[1:36:44] converted with REMSA dough and his
[1:36:47] mental ex he's trying his best to
[1:36:49] overcome it but he'll never be able to
[1:36:52] overcome it he must be born again but
[1:36:57] aren't you glad aren't you glad that
[1:37:01] though you can look down to your family
[1:37:03] tree and see all these different streams
[1:37:05] but greater is He that is in you or you
[1:37:09] still have the war you strength to
[1:37:11] battle but in the differences this is
[1:37:12] the difference this was the difference
[1:37:14] this young man was not willing to get
[1:37:16] right are you with me
[1:37:18] he was not willing to get right he was
[1:37:21] not willing to go apologize to the young
[1:37:23] lady he was not willing and the Prophet
[1:37:26] said ah something's wrong you're
[1:37:32] negative and leave did you
[1:37:34] you see listen friends it's where when
[1:37:38] the Word of God touches our heart we can
[1:37:40] ever set we can set in ourselves and
[1:37:42] every one of us can set here I'm right
[1:37:44] I'm right I'm right I'm right this but
[1:37:47] when the Holy Spirit begins to touch on
[1:37:49] the inside and deal with your heart if
[1:37:51] your hearts already been turned you
[1:37:52] can't stay in that condition because why
[1:37:55] the middle wall has already been torn
[1:37:57] down and there is no desire to have a
[1:37:59] wall between you and Jesus as a matter
[1:38:02] of fact the desire within your heart I
[1:38:03] said Lord
[1:38:04] I don't want any separation between me
[1:38:07] and you sometimes it's not about the
[1:38:08] things that you do sometimes it's the
[1:38:10] things that are neglected to be done
[1:38:12] yeah and you realize that that can begin
[1:38:14] to become a wall you can live and dwell
[1:38:16] and walk in the same house and yet be
[1:38:19] total strangers you with me you can go
[1:38:23] your separate ways show up the dinner
[1:38:24] together and everything else and yet be
[1:38:27] strangers to one another God doesn't
[1:38:29] want you to be strangers to one another
[1:38:30] God don't want you to be strangers in
[1:38:32] his presence God don't want you just to
[1:38:34] show up here to church on Thursday and
[1:38:36] Sunday and you show up but God
[1:38:38] wants to fellowship with you every
[1:38:40] single day he wants to fellowship with
[1:38:44] you when you're on the job
[1:38:45] he wants to fellowship with you when
[1:38:47] you're making the pie crust or when
[1:38:48] you're out in the garden or when you're
[1:38:50] down in the grocery store or you're out
[1:38:52] there washing clothes or you're out
[1:38:54] there God wants to fellowship with you
[1:38:56] we are not traditionalized people to
[1:38:59] where it has to be inside of a church
[1:39:02] our fellowship and worship with him it
[1:39:05] can be just as inviting as much as we
[1:39:08] will invite him he'll come but down in
[1:39:16] there too was another nature present
[1:39:23] predestinated was in there by God in
[1:39:29] this same body see two natures in there
[1:39:32] well I only catered to one as I grow to
[1:39:35] good as a baby down down first thing you
[1:39:38] know I become a liar I've become
[1:39:40] everything else that's a sinner because
[1:39:41] I was raised up that way but down in
[1:39:46] there was a little speck of life all the
[1:39:50] time all the time another nature was
[1:39:56] down in there all the time but remember
[1:39:58] it was just laying there's a seed
[1:40:01] there's got to be a death in order for
[1:40:04] this to come forth this is the new this
[1:40:08] is the new man when he reunites with
[1:40:10] that part of himself that seed what was
[1:40:16] it he said there was another William
[1:40:19] Brennan read be to God a little spot of
[1:40:26] eternal life down there it didn't have
[1:40:29] to be big it was little but it grows it
[1:40:34] growls yeah it grows into a mountain
[1:40:37] hallelujah from the genes of God the
[1:40:42] Word of God that was placed in there oh
[1:40:44] he says each one of you can think of
[1:40:47] similar things see it was working then I
[1:40:50] look up to the trees and I
[1:40:51] the leaf and I see you fall off last
[1:40:54] year why are you back again again where
[1:40:57] did you come from what brought you here
[1:40:59] see it was that eternal life working in
[1:41:02] the body now one day as I walked on that
[1:41:06] little voice and said don't never smoke
[1:41:08] drinker so forth and the young fellows
[1:41:10] and all got older see there was
[1:41:12] something moving but yet all at once I
[1:41:14] looked up and I said I'm not the son of
[1:41:16] Charles and ellebra know there's
[1:41:19] something calling like my little eagle
[1:41:21] I'm not a chicken there's something
[1:41:23] under somewhere oh great - over whoever
[1:41:26] you are open up I want to come home
[1:41:32] willingness not forced drawn into it oh
[1:41:38] great Jehovah I want to come home
[1:41:43] there's something in me calling Ben I
[1:41:49] was born again that little life was
[1:41:52] laying there the life of water was
[1:41:56] poured upon it then it began to grow
[1:42:01] that old life was forgiven put in the
[1:42:04] sea of God's forgetfulness to never be
[1:42:06] remembered against me no more now we
[1:42:09] stand justified as though we had never
[1:42:12] sinned in the presence of God he made
[1:42:19] Elaine let me read one scripture in
[1:42:23] closing we're just going to close I
[1:42:24] can't go no further
[1:42:25] Titus 3:3 for we ourselves also were
[1:42:34] sometimes foolish disobedient deceived
[1:42:40] serving divers lusts and pleasures
[1:42:44] living in malice and envy hateful and
[1:42:51] hating one another that's where we were
[1:42:55] living because that was our first birth
[1:42:59] that was that enmity that's where we
[1:43:02] lived
[1:43:05] but after the kindness and love of God
[1:43:10] our Savior toward man appeared not by
[1:43:13] works of righteousness which we have
[1:43:16] done so it's not but working remember
[1:43:19] even working working is not surrender
[1:43:21] work is trying to obtain by merit
[1:43:24] surrender is to submit to what he
[1:43:27] already has done now by works of
[1:43:30] righteousness which we have done but
[1:43:32] according to His mercy he saved us by
[1:43:37] the washing of regeneration rebirth new
[1:43:42] birth and renewing of the Holy Ghost he
[1:43:48] made you and I knew we're a new creation
[1:43:53] that which lay in there the whole time
[1:43:56] that you say where did you come from I
[1:43:59] was there the whole time that that was
[1:44:03] always you I think of our brother Ram
[1:44:08] says invisible Union he said that
[1:44:11] eternal that gene it found you that's a
[1:44:17] you know there's just certain things you
[1:44:19] know that you you just ponder on you
[1:44:21] look at he just and God just continues
[1:44:23] to illuminate more and more I don't know
[1:44:26] if I told you here or not but there was
[1:44:28] some about a couple years ago and
[1:44:30] there's a story of a young lady who she
[1:44:34] was taken from a hospital when she was a
[1:44:35] newborn there was a woman who came in
[1:44:38] and the woman who came in was dressed in
[1:44:41] nursing scrubs she came into the room
[1:44:44] where after the birth had taken place in
[1:44:46] the child the little baby was laying
[1:44:47] right there and she came in like maybe
[1:44:49] so many hours later and she was asking
[1:44:52] the mother as they would ask upon those
[1:44:53] wardens would you like us to take the
[1:44:55] baby down you know to whatever it's
[1:44:57] called and we'll watch over the baby and
[1:44:59] the mother thought it was a nurse but it
[1:45:02] wasn't it was a woman that lived in
[1:45:05] South Carolina that had went down into
[1:45:06] Florida and she came in there and she
[1:45:09] took that little baby that little baby
[1:45:11] was just hours old she raised that
[1:45:13] little baby
[1:45:14] and it was about two years ago that
[1:45:17] little baby now is a grown young lady
[1:45:19] she's 18 years old and then all of a
[1:45:22] sudden begin to be something happen
[1:45:24] about her life that she started she
[1:45:26] loved the person that she knew as her
[1:45:28] mother but yet she started to notice
[1:45:30] when she started to apply for grants for
[1:45:32] college that her social security number
[1:45:34] was a fraud it was not actually of a
[1:45:38] woman it was of a man that had passed
[1:45:39] away up in New Jersey or something there
[1:45:41] was a fraud so she thought I wonder
[1:45:44] what's going on so she went to go apply
[1:45:46] for a job same thing she couldn't get
[1:45:49] nowhere cuz her social security number
[1:45:51] was a fraud her didn't realize I don't
[1:45:54] think I am who I think I am I think I've
[1:46:02] been stolen now what they did was if all
[1:46:06] of a sudden they ran they ran a test
[1:46:08] then and how when they ran that test
[1:46:10] they matched up her DNA because the DNA
[1:46:16] July the DNA tied her right back into
[1:46:20] her mother taught her right back into
[1:46:22] her father and the authorities came and
[1:46:24] liberated her from that situation what
[1:46:28] was it that DNA found her what was it
[1:46:32] that found you and I that gene on the
[1:46:35] inside the Holy Spirit the water of life
[1:46:39] moving down on the inside we tried to
[1:46:42] fit here trying to fit there trying to
[1:46:45] fit in here but we'd realized hey I'm
[1:46:47] not fitting anywhere but the water of
[1:46:49] life the water of life moving over and
[1:46:53] you begin to say hey you know what I'm
[1:46:55] not of this world
[1:46:57] I will walk this way no more I believe
[1:47:01] there's a greater call on my life I
[1:47:03] believe that I believe I'm to be a
[1:47:04] server a child of God I believe that's
[1:47:07] what I am what was that the Holy Spirit
[1:47:09] moving knowing he's got a little eagle
[1:47:12] there he knows the DNA that he's sold
[1:47:14] there he knows that gene that's way down
[1:47:16] there and he moves down
[1:47:22] and he raises it up by the washing of
[1:47:25] regeneration and renewing of the Holy
[1:47:29] Ghost now you know what I've looked at
[1:47:33] this I followed this every once in a
[1:47:36] while try to check up on and look into
[1:47:38] him on the young lady and this young
[1:47:42] lady when you look at it on her life
[1:47:46] it's a hard thing because for her they
[1:47:49] said don't use you know how do you feel
[1:47:51] about your this woman who took you she
[1:47:53] said woman who took me that's my mama
[1:47:54] she said she raised me she was good to
[1:47:58] me
[1:47:58] she wasn't ever bad to me now you and I
[1:48:01] could never say that about the devil
[1:48:03] that God was bad to us I don't care how
[1:48:07] many good things supposedly he gave to
[1:48:09] us it all I did was wreck and scar lives
[1:48:12] but you know what man that sounds
[1:48:15] good doing it thank the Lord for that on
[1:48:17] the plants but notice of all of this
[1:48:20] right here they you find within her she
[1:48:24] is dealing with so many things
[1:48:25] emotionally I thought about that young
[1:48:30] lady I thought how it must be in her
[1:48:31] mind to have to try to come to a place
[1:48:34] of acquainting with some people that
[1:48:37] you've not been around for 18 or 19
[1:48:38] years old you've not been raised by him
[1:48:43] you might have features and look you
[1:48:45] look like him but you know for her she's
[1:48:47] having to learn that and forget her past
[1:48:51] that's in the natural but how much
[1:48:54] greater in the spiritual you see you can
[1:48:58] remember your past that God don't
[1:49:01] remember it the only past that God
[1:49:04] remembers is where you were and what you
[1:49:07] have been all the time you see you
[1:49:10] always were saved but you've just come
[1:49:16] to recognize it and he has drawn you to
[1:49:21] himself
[1:49:24] you see how God does this he brings it
[1:49:26] right down for you and I to where that
[1:49:29] in this part of our life that of the new
[1:49:32] birth and that of the continual working
[1:49:35] in our lives it's he himself drawing us
[1:49:40] even what God wants from our life he
[1:49:43] doesn't demand it he draws it out of our
[1:49:46] life he corrects us when we're wrong
[1:49:48] don't he he sure does he corrects us but
[1:49:51] remember remember correction were still
[1:49:54] admonished within correction at Hebrews
[1:49:56] 12 proverbs 3 it is as well through what
[1:49:59] was to say make straight paths for your
[1:50:01] feet lest that which is lame be turned
[1:50:05] out of the way but let us be exercised
[1:50:09] by the peaceable fruits thereof so God
[1:50:13] he will correct us because he's faithful
[1:50:14] to raise us in the right way he won't
[1:50:17] let his children get by remember he is
[1:50:20] your father not your grandfather
[1:50:24] grandfather's will let you get away with
[1:50:25] a lot of things man oh man
[1:50:29] grandfather's will let you get away with
[1:50:31] a lot but father's father's told the
[1:50:34] line fathers know there's a vision for
[1:50:37] you to be fulfilled but he himself said
[1:50:41] this the Bible says on us abundantly
[1:50:46] shed it on us abundantly he is working a
[1:50:50] moisture that we you and I could die to
[1:50:55] ourselves the brem said it like that he
[1:50:59] said when we think of it think of
[1:51:02] Ephesians 2 we were dead we were dead
[1:51:10] but he quickened us so the part that was
[1:51:13] dead he quickened the part that was
[1:51:17] alive he killed but he killed it when we
[1:51:21] were willing for it to die but then he
[1:51:25] raises up what he already had sown there
[1:51:28] and now were raised up we're no longer
[1:51:31] living in were raised up into heavenly
[1:51:35] places with Christ Jesus and this is
[1:51:41] where we are raised
[1:51:43] may God help us and by the moisture of
[1:51:47] the Holy Spirit our lives being in such
[1:51:51] a place to where that his victory is
[1:51:54] being made manifest through you and I
[1:51:57] listen this does not stop here when our
[1:52:00] soul has been reconciled there is a
[1:52:02] moment coming where our body there'll be
[1:52:06] a full reconciling spirit as human
[1:52:11] spirit we've done away with us the Alpha
[1:52:13] it takes place and then the glorified
[1:52:15] body a full reconciling but in the
[1:52:20] meantime right here while we walk in
[1:52:23] this life this is why we do what we do
[1:52:25] this is why we dressed the way we dress
[1:52:28] is because his desire for us as a
[1:52:30] covenant people is different we're a
[1:52:35] peculiar people oh my what a privilege
[1:52:41] friends what a privilege that he made a
[1:52:44] way that we can die to herself all
[1:52:48] throughout this building that we're just
[1:52:50] closing there's things that maybe you
[1:52:53] look in your life personally and there
[1:52:55] needs to be a real death in your life
[1:52:57] they're there in the soul but then all
[1:53:02] around this building there is also lives
[1:53:05] and every one of us that need to die
[1:53:08] daily and the only way that we can die
[1:53:12] in order for that to happen there had to
[1:53:15] be moisture that was supplied
[1:53:18] the moisture the water of life in order
[1:53:22] to bring about a death which is a
[1:53:24] rotting away of all of our own ideas and
[1:53:27] our own thoughts I'll tell you this
[1:53:30] morning I'm a witness that no matter
[1:53:34] what it is that God is more than able to
[1:53:39] give you the strength to release within
[1:53:42] you what's needed no matter what it is
[1:53:46] in your life there's a lot of listen
[1:53:48] friends
[1:53:48] there's things where there's wounds
[1:53:49] there's things where there's
[1:53:50] indifference what but whatever it is
[1:53:52] don't just well I don't have that no put
[1:53:55] it before God allow God to cleanse it if
[1:53:59] you've got you got an attitude that's
[1:54:00] not right if you got something that's
[1:54:02] out of line a feeling about something
[1:54:04] that's just not right listen to me you
[1:54:06] don't have to live with that but
[1:54:08] remember there's a flowing cleansing
[1:54:11] stream you know when you look at
[1:54:14] forgiveness forgiveness and trust are
[1:54:21] similar yet their difference trust is
[1:54:26] faith is that right faith is based on
[1:54:31] forgiveness is that right there's got to
[1:54:35] be forgiveness first in order for trust
[1:54:38] to come out of it trust comes out of
[1:54:42] forgiveness it grows out of there it's
[1:54:45] just look how God look how God deals
[1:54:47] with our lives look how he deals with it
[1:54:49] when God the way God will deal with our
[1:54:51] life is there's things the word the
[1:54:53] Bible says there's chastening there's
[1:54:55] trying where God begins to guide and
[1:54:57] direct you and I and if you and I say I
[1:54:59] don't want to do that I'm not gonna do
[1:55:01] this I'm not gonna do that and God
[1:55:04] cannot put trust in us so forgiveness
[1:55:10] it's based on trust you see the little
[1:55:13] little by little by little of what God
[1:55:15] Himself is entrusting to us and what
[1:55:18] he's asking for you and I you know
[1:55:20] what's doing he already has listen
[1:55:23] friends he knows what's within you and I
[1:55:25] but he wants to see it come
[1:55:28] he wants to see obedience
[1:55:31] come forth but the water of life is so
[1:55:35] much greater than any wound anything
[1:55:41] that could be within a life you know I
[1:55:44] did a little studying and presented some
[1:55:47] things with ministers and you didn't you
[1:55:49] look at how that there's wounds that can
[1:55:50] happen sometimes and wounds themselves
[1:55:53] if you don't get them cleaned they can
[1:55:56] become very deadly they're doing things
[1:56:00] now where they're taking a part of the
[1:56:03] placentas that normally the placenta is
[1:56:05] thrown away that you and I were wrapped
[1:56:06] in there in that water sac and they're
[1:56:09] taking that human amniotic tore apart
[1:56:12] and they're putting those things a
[1:56:14] membrane there upon those wounds because
[1:56:17] there is regenerative power within
[1:56:20] themselves that are there now you know
[1:56:23] what I looked at that I might be very
[1:56:24] simple but when I started thinking about
[1:56:26] that and looking at it I thought here is
[1:56:28] a little piece of a placenta it might be
[1:56:32] ever so small
[1:56:32] they've guarded it but that placenta was
[1:56:36] one time what a baby was housed in the
[1:56:40] water was in there and it kept that baby
[1:56:42] to where that baby could grow and
[1:56:45] develop how much more in our lives when
[1:56:50] we can apply that all we've got
[1:56:52] something greater we've got that same
[1:56:54] life that has brought life to us we have
[1:56:57] that access to allow that to flow down
[1:57:00] and give strength where there's weakness
[1:57:04] to bring healing where there's pain you
[1:57:08] believe that amen let's pray Lord Jesus
[1:57:16] Lord you're the greatest similar of your
[1:57:20] word father you're the one Lord that
[1:57:23] everything and all that it would be
[1:57:25] spoken Lord in a service Lord you know
[1:57:28] all of the parts you know every
[1:57:31] you know Lord Lord when things that
[1:57:34] would would be spoken Lord father what
[1:57:38] would be Lord for every life for every
[1:57:42] heart I pray that all God the Lord as we
[1:57:46] we look across your word this morning
[1:57:49] Lord and father is you knowing the needs
[1:57:54] upon our lives and in our lives Lord
[1:57:58] here this morning we are in needy people
[1:58:02] Lord we are in needy people
[1:58:06] Lord Jesus there's lives Lord God that
[1:58:11] throughout the building Lord hearts Lord
[1:58:14] Jesus the Lord as you spoke Lord to our
[1:58:18] lives and our hearts Lord I pray right
[1:58:20] now this morning father may we not just
[1:58:24] allow this Lord or not just let it be
[1:58:27] just another another service but I asked
[1:58:32] Lord and father from the very
[1:58:34] willingness of our heart may we reach
[1:58:38] out to you Lord your God even as was
[1:58:45] mentioned there Lord I'm coming Lord you
[1:58:49] draw us Lord if if it wasn't for you
[1:58:52] drawing us Oh My Lord God you you bring
[1:58:59] us you draw us to your self would father
[1:59:03] beyond the conditions beyond the
[1:59:05] situation's Lord may it may it burn Lord
[1:59:10] so deep within every life
[1:59:12] every one of our hearts may there not be
[1:59:15] one Lord not one in any way that would
[1:59:19] leave from here this morning with any
[1:59:22] wall still up Lord I pray God may Lord
[1:59:28] God you move Lord upon hearts that are
[1:59:31] holding that promise Lord in their life
[1:59:33] that this morning Lord is we just moved
[1:59:36] by your word and they could say Lord
[1:59:38] that's for me that's mine that's mine
[1:59:41] Lord I pray God that you'll grant to him
[1:59:45] Lord as they would hold that promise of
[1:59:47] the Holy Ghost granted to him Lord and
[1:59:49] their hearts Lord I pray Lord God needs
[1:59:55] Lord Jesus other needs throughout this
[1:59:59] building Lord you see father sometimes
[2:00:03] the Lord God not just sometimes Lord but
[2:00:07] the sky that we pack around he is the
[2:00:11] biggest enemy with God
[2:00:15] Lord Jesus how think phul we are we're
[2:00:19] aware there's a newness of life that is
[2:00:21] moved on the inside and I pray and I ask
[2:00:25] Lord and for each of these requests
[2:00:29] that's here but you'll grant Lord God
[2:00:34] what it is Lord that is the desire of
[2:00:37] their heart
[2:00:38] something Lord that maybe is troubling
[2:00:41] the Lord
[2:00:42] maybe it's wearing this Lord in their
[2:00:44] spirit their mind maybe the Lord they're
[2:00:48] weary in their body sickness Lord may be
[2:00:53] weary Lord in their mind Lord but I pray
[2:00:57] Heavenly Father this morning Lord by the
[2:01:02] Holy Ghost I pray Lord Jesus that you'll
[2:01:07] move for them right now Lord God made in
[2:01:11] Lord Jesus just take hold of that and
[2:01:16] Lord not looking at that situation maybe
[2:01:19] it's a feeling in their life maybe it's
[2:01:21] a lack of forgiveness Lord maybe it's
[2:01:23] bitterness lord malice one time they
[2:01:26] live there but they realize this is not
[2:01:28] where I'm to live I don't want to live
[2:01:30] here I don't want this to be a part of
[2:01:33] my life or God
[2:01:37] but they battle against it thoughts
[2:01:39] coming back sometimes feelings right but
[2:01:41] lord I pray right now Lord Jesus may
[2:01:46] they look and focus rat upon you Lord
[2:01:50] and let that flow that cleansing flow of
[2:01:54] the Holy Spirit that renewing of the
[2:01:57] Holy Ghost you takes more lore than us
[2:02:00] trying to change our mind change our
[2:02:02] thoughts I believe that Paul spoke to us
[2:02:04] Lord about how that were to order our
[2:02:06] thoughts but Lord we need the renewing
[2:02:08] of the Holy Ghost we need the Holy
[2:02:11] Spirit Lord God moving down Lord
[2:02:14] cleansing in our life Lord giving a
[2:02:16] strength Lord the Holy Spirit moving
[2:02:18] down Lord in homes and lives Lord in
[2:02:21] renewing Lord father missus this is who
[2:02:24] you are this is who you are the Lord God
[2:02:29] we have a right we have a right to say
[2:02:36] Lord you who regenerated and renewed me
[2:02:40] Lord God Lord God renew my life Lord
[2:02:48] renew my spirit Lord God or Jesus me
[2:02:54] real high so Lord that in many many
[2:02:56] times sometimes Lord it's just it may
[2:02:58] not be something right at this moment
[2:03:00] but we're laying underneath that stream
[2:03:02] of life with a faith to believe in that
[2:03:07] same renewing power of the Holy Ghost a
[2:03:10] cleansing Lord to whereby were washed
[2:03:14] with the washing of water by the word Oh
[2:03:20] Lord goddess you told Peter he that is
[2:03:24] washed he's every bit clean and whole
[2:03:30] need not wash only his feet the feet
[2:03:37] gets dirty it needs to be washed the
[2:03:42] Lord God wants our soul has been washed
[2:03:44] it's washed it's been washed with the
[2:03:49] waters of regeneration but we need a
[2:03:52] washing we need washing Lord
[2:03:57] that we might worship Lloyd granite
[2:04:02] Lloyd it's not a steel wall to water a
[2:04:06] broken cistern will never ever wash it
[2:04:09] away but we need that fresh washing of
[2:04:15] water by the word Lord Jesus no doubt
[2:04:21] throughout this building many different
[2:04:23] ones have looked at there's such a
[2:04:26] difference when we water with tap water
[2:04:28] versus the rain water
[2:04:32] what God tap water as they say it deals
[2:04:34] with some of the fluoride there's a lot
[2:04:36] of different chemicals and things within
[2:04:38] and it never gets to the depth it many
[2:04:41] times will rob the plants and take from
[2:04:43] them the nutrients that they need but
[2:04:47] that rainwater has a certain pH within
[2:04:50] it it has nitrogen within it that's
[2:04:53] already in the air and when it begins to
[2:04:55] come dance in that water it picks up
[2:04:58] that nitrogen and bringing it right down
[2:04:59] into the soil and that rain though it
[2:05:02] might be a light rain it's able to soak
[2:05:05] it so deep into the soil to where that
[2:05:10] the nutrients that are needed in that
[2:05:12] plant you can actually it'll thrive Lord
[2:05:17] Jesus we don't mean man-made tap water
[2:05:23] we don't need tap water that can be
[2:05:25] turned on and off
[2:05:26] we need Lord God that fresh rainwater
[2:05:30] Lord we need a fresh rain water Lord God
[2:05:33] that's not something Lord God that we
