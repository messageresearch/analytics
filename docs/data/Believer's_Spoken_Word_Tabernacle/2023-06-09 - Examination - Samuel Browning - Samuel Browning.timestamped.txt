[34:21] certainly thankful to the Lord for his
[34:23] Mercy that while we were gone and I know
[34:25] you had some wonderful Services here and
[34:28] that's God
[34:29] amen God is is God and we're so thankful
[34:32] for that amen and we just are so
[34:35] grateful for his God's faithfulness you
[34:38] know and that's something that we so
[34:40] appreciate and we just miss you and I
[34:42] know it has only gone for a week here
[34:44] but uh still we missed you very much and
[34:47] uh a beautiful place we're at in in
[34:50] Arizona and uh
[34:52] to me is probably the second most
[34:54] beautiful place to this where we're at
[34:56] in Ohio now I know some people like
[34:58] other certain places but to me I I
[35:01] second time being there and my I just
[35:04] love the mountains that are not Hills
[35:06] they're actually mountains and I just
[35:10] love
[35:11] or kind of love the the temperatures and
[35:13] things and most importantly you know
[35:15] there's places sometimes you go there
[35:17] places but God's people are there and
[35:19] that's what makes the place and then
[35:21] there's sometimes when you go there's
[35:22] nice places and God's people are there
[35:24] and so this is one of those places that
[35:27] I can say that it's a nice place and
[35:28] there was God God's people are there and
[35:31] certainly a lot of things that are there
[35:33] a lot of struggles a lot of you know
[35:35] uphill battles and things that they
[35:37] themselves have to face but I certainly
[35:40] want to say to you I appreciate your
[35:41] prayers for the service as we we pretty
[35:44] much hit the ground running and by God's
[35:46] grace we were able to get our flights in
[35:48] last night and got in late about one in
[35:51] the morning and some things you know
[35:53] from all of this
[35:54] smoke from you know the Canadians don't
[35:57] know how to use matches yet and uh so we
[36:00] we told sister Sue we're going to take
[36:02] some uh we're going to keep sending
[36:03] Smokey the Bear you know things to him
[36:06] you know but uh you know and but
[36:09] regardless of all things I'm just
[36:11] thankful we're thankful to be back home
[36:13] and and uh thankful for your prayers the
[36:15] Lord just did marvelous things there in
[36:18] the in the services from the uh opening
[36:21] night there even until the closing so
[36:23] different reports are still coming in
[36:25] and we just it you you are part of it
[36:27] you may not have been there physically
[36:29] but you were a part of it with your
[36:31] prayers and so I want you just to know
[36:33] that even brother Dale and the
[36:35] congregations there asked me to bring
[36:37] greetings back to you here and so uh we
[36:41] want to go into the word of the Lord and
[36:42] just have a
[36:44] thought in our heart thank you musicians
[36:46] and God bless you
[36:48] amen if we could let's just stand and we
[36:52] want to
[36:53] I want to go right into the word of the
[36:55] Lord and just to read in job 23.
[36:59] we we begin looking at this a little bit
[37:03] the last time we were together and I
[37:05] want to just look over
[37:08] many scriptures brother Branham will
[37:09] take this chapter and this chapter is
[37:11] referred to uh quite a bit in the
[37:14] message I have heard but now I see and a
[37:18] lot of the same principles that you will
[37:21] see you know principles are things that
[37:23] are based upon and how things operate
[37:25] sometimes we're just you know sometimes
[37:27] we're just thankful that things are
[37:29] operating but God also wants us to know
[37:32] as Believers the principles that cause
[37:35] things to operate
[37:36] uh brother in the middle of the message
[37:40] how many of you listen the message
[37:41] humble thyself in 63. very short message
[37:44] and in the middle that message uh it's
[37:47] it's a a message that they have brother
[37:50] Vale come up and speak for a few moments
[37:52] and brother Vale takes a thought I and
[37:55] brother Branham comes and capitalizes on
[37:57] it right after that in the second part
[37:59] of that message and he takes uh Mark 16
[38:02] and he takes the scripture and he says
[38:05] what makes it work and why it doesn't
[38:07] work
[38:08] and those are the things that when we
[38:10] look at principles in God's word I mean
[38:12] you and I many times we look at things
[38:14] and I when I've when on my computer when
[38:16] I press power I want it just to work I
[38:19] want to be able to search and get my
[38:21] documents going and studying I just want
[38:22] it to work on my phone I just want it to
[38:25] work but sometimes there's things that
[38:27] we have to go in the background of it
[38:28] and God wants us to understand the
[38:31] principles of it because there's other
[38:33] times that things arise and we become
[38:35] frustrated why isn't this working
[38:38] and so God's desire because the Sons and
[38:41] Daughters of God we are built with an
[38:44] authority to know our position so we
[38:47] just want to read here for a few moments
[38:49] in job 23 and verse 1. then job answered
[38:53] and said even today is my complaint
[38:56] bitter my stroke is heavier than my
[39:00] groaning so job is still under the
[39:02] burden all that I knew where I might
[39:05] find him
[39:06] that I might come even to his seat I
[39:11] would order my calls before him and fill
[39:14] my mouth with arguments now job was not
[39:17] saying that he was going to be arguing
[39:19] with God but job knew where he was
[39:22] standing
[39:24] and job knew that when he would stand
[39:26] before God there was not a hesitation
[39:29] job would be able to say Lord I've done
[39:32] everything that you have asked me to do
[39:36] I think that's powerful
[39:39] that's very powerful that's how the Ram
[39:41] came into existence on Mount Moriah I've
[39:45] done everything that you've asked me to
[39:47] do that's the key of the rapture
[39:50] and that is something that it's not my
[39:53] efforts doing it as far as because I
[39:55] could do things simply because I knew it
[39:57] was the right thing to do
[39:59] but for the bride it's more than just
[40:01] doing something because it's the right
[40:03] thing in my heart says Lord I want to
[40:07] please you
[40:09] see that's when it's genuine and that's
[40:11] where there's Peace So notice he says I
[40:14] would know the words which he would
[40:16] answer me and understand what he would
[40:18] say unto me will he plead against me
[40:21] with his great power no but he would put
[40:25] strength in me and there the righteous
[40:27] might dispute with him so should I be
[40:30] delivered forever from my judge behold I
[40:35] go forward but he's not there and
[40:38] backward but I cannot perceive him on
[40:41] the left hand where he does work but I
[40:43] cannot be holding he hideth himself on
[40:46] the right hand that I cannot see him but
[40:50] he know it the way that I take
[40:53] and when he hath tried me I shall come
[40:57] forth as gold brother Brian just just a
[41:01] Teensy bit knock it down right here just
[41:03] a Teensy sorry but he know it the way
[41:06] that I take it I want to just draw
[41:08] emphasis on that how could job know the
[41:11] way unless God had revealed the way
[41:15] you ever been in a situation where you
[41:17] you guessing at something and you don't
[41:19] know is this right
[41:21] is this how something's to be done
[41:23] that's not either you can't be certain
[41:25] you're waiting at the end to see is this
[41:28] right is that right
[41:30] that's where faith comes in faith is a
[41:35] revealing of God's way
[41:37] faith is a certainty that I know what
[41:40] God has said I've there is already an
[41:43] assurance in my heart
[41:46] he knows the way that I take because
[41:48] he's revealed the way to me the way that
[41:50] I'm walking he's revealed it I couldn't
[41:53] have found it without him so job is
[41:55] expressing of the grace that's come to
[41:57] him when he had tried me I shall come
[41:59] forth as gold my foot hath held his
[42:03] steps his way have I kept and not
[42:07] declined neither have I gone back from
[42:10] the Commandment of his lips I have
[42:13] esteemed the words of his mouth more
[42:18] than my necessary food
[42:22] Heavenly Father
[42:24] tonight as we just come to you Lord in
[42:27] these moments that you have given to us
[42:29] we ask that you would come Lord and
[42:32] speak to our hearts in a very personal
[42:34] way tonight Lord those that are gathered
[42:36] those that Lord would stream this Lord
[42:39] those that would archive it I pray that
[42:41] God that your word it will find its Mark
[42:45] Lord and may our lives and our hearts
[42:47] God be strengthened and encouraged and
[42:50] enriched by your presence Lord your
[42:54] visitation Lord in our lives we give
[42:56] ourselves to you now in the name of
[42:59] Jesus Christ amen God bless you as
[43:02] you're being seated here for a few
[43:03] moments
[43:05] I want to just read to you a a quote out
[43:08] of the message be certain of God and
[43:10] brother Branham would speak this uh
[43:12] multiple times but I want to just draw
[43:14] from here a point that we want to look
[43:16] at tonight and he's praying and he says
[43:19] Lord bless Thy word as it goes forth and
[43:22] may the Holy Spirit capture our minds
[43:25] and our thoughts and prepare us for his
[43:28] visitation as we have asked him to come
[43:32] I would say God grant that you're
[43:34] tonight
[43:35] we can have a lot on our minds a lot of
[43:37] thoughts but God may you come and
[43:40] capture our minds and and our thoughts
[43:42] for we do not come to the house of the
[43:46] Lord to be seen or to see but to learn
[43:50] of thee and to Know Thy nature and thy
[43:54] way and thy causes that we might be able
[43:58] to face the problems of life with a real
[44:01] Assurance being certain of God
[44:06] and I want to speak tonight simple
[44:08] thought on a word examination
[44:11] and we look upon here in the word and we
[44:15] can see that there is a certainty that
[44:18] job already through all of these
[44:21] chapters and it doesn't diminish
[44:23] whatsoever
[44:25] of where that his faith is in God
[44:30] job does not know what is happening he
[44:35] doesn't know what's going on
[44:37] God has not let him know this and as a
[44:40] matter of fact God is silent
[44:44] in a moment through all of this now the
[44:48] course of time that this is over I I
[44:51] don't have that right here before me to
[44:54] be able to reference how many moments
[44:58] days weeks and time was this
[45:02] then all of this was taking place the
[45:05] duration of it but in the midst of it
[45:08] all there was a faith that was solid
[45:13] upon what God had said
[45:17] and this is the thing that we want to
[45:19] look at here tonight is is Faith itself
[45:23] and we so often hear we've from this
[45:26] Pulpit from many pulpits from throughout
[45:29] the scriptures the trial of our faith
[45:32] and we want to ensure that our lives and
[45:36] our hearts are in the position that
[45:39] faith can then operate because God's
[45:42] desire is that we know exactly at all
[45:45] times where we are standing in him the
[45:49] scripture would say in Hebrews 11 1
[45:51] faith is the substance of things hoped
[45:55] for of what's expected and it's the
[45:58] evidence of Things Not Seen
[46:02] for by it the elders obtained a good
[46:06] report and it goes on to say through
[46:09] faith we understand it doesn't say that
[46:11] we explain but we understand that the
[46:14] worlds were framed by the word of God so
[46:18] that things which are seen were not made
[46:21] of things which do appear we are not
[46:24] believing that what we believe tonight
[46:26] because we can't explain it
[46:29] there are many uh solid profound
[46:32] agnostics that can stand in the face and
[46:35] can debate so clearly upon the
[46:37] scriptures and yet are not able to take
[46:40] all of God's word and you might say well
[46:43] they would say that the word of God is
[46:45] infallible it is one thing to say that
[46:48] the word in print is infallible but then
[46:51] when that word is become flesh to
[46:54] denounce it is then to take away from
[46:56] this word that we claim to believe and
[46:59] yet we really don't believe it so to
[47:01] believe the word is not only to believe
[47:03] the written word but it's to believe the
[47:06] manifested word of God for when God's
[47:09] word is being manifest no man can do
[47:11] that in himself it must be God come and
[47:16] the inspiration of his spirit that
[47:18] actually manifests the word and bring it
[47:21] to pass that's how we see God that's how
[47:25] we know God that's how we know his will
[47:29] his desires for our life is when he
[47:32] comes and begins to reveal his word and
[47:35] speak to our hearts in a very personal
[47:38] way
[47:39] through faith we understand that the
[47:42] worlds were framed by the word of God so
[47:44] that things which are seen were not made
[47:47] of things which do appear you ever had
[47:50] situations in your life you knew it's
[47:52] going to happen but you couldn't explain
[47:53] how or when
[47:55] it's just something where there's been a
[47:57] healing maybe it's a loved one a son or
[48:00] daughter and there's just something it's
[48:01] just drunk I can't explain it but I know
[48:03] it's on the way I know it's on the way
[48:07] that is faith
[48:10] faith is not what we can explain
[48:14] faith is the substance of things that we
[48:17] are looking for
[48:19] and expecting and then there's an
[48:22] Evidence it's not just something that's
[48:24] unseen but Faith declares itself even
[48:28] through our actions through our lives
[48:31] that I'm expecting this
[48:33] without faith it's impossible to please
[48:36] him for he that cometh to God must
[48:40] believe that he is and that he is a
[48:44] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[48:47] him I want you to think back to where
[48:50] in the beginning of this The Book of Job
[48:53] and job warning then coming into job 2.
[48:58] of how that
[48:59] God was actually expressing
[49:03] to Satan
[49:05] that I've got a man up on Earth that I
[49:08] can that that I have confidence not in
[49:11] job's flesh
[49:13] but confidence
[49:15] in who job really was and he was through
[49:19] that life of the sacrifice that job was
[49:22] identified in God had confidence in his
[49:25] word you realize when God gives you or I
[49:28] a test or trial it isn't that he has
[49:30] confidence in our flesh because there
[49:32] are times through the trial that our
[49:35] flesh can question our flesh can't
[49:38] complain our flesh can cry we might as
[49:42] well be honest but God has confidence in
[49:45] that part which is really himself that
[49:49] is which is part of him this on the
[49:51] outside is not the Son and Daughter of
[49:53] God but the Son and Daughter of God is
[49:56] that part on the inside that God brings
[49:58] forth by the new birth that's why the
[50:01] Holy Spirit leads us to the place of a
[50:04] real New Birth it's God leading his
[50:07] children into the place in order for his
[50:10] life to come and Quicken fully that seed
[50:14] on the inside and what does it do it
[50:17] raises up a new creation
[50:20] not the old man reformed no but the
[50:24] spirit of God quickening power comes
[50:27] that there might come a transformation
[50:30] changing from one form to another
[50:34] is that right so here was a man a just
[50:37] man not in not not in that the job was
[50:41] in every way perfect but God declared
[50:43] imperfect how could job stand perfect
[50:46] because of job's confession was in the
[50:52] sacrifice that God had revealed
[50:55] job did not try to debate with it
[50:58] whether he was worried or not job's
[51:00] faith when confidence was in that
[51:03] sacrifice so when God was looking down
[51:06] and said have your concerned considered
[51:09] job he is a perfect man God was
[51:12] beholding job through the sacrifice let
[51:16] me just say to you tonight he's
[51:18] beholding you and I through the
[51:20] sacrifice
[51:21] let me just say to you as well no matter
[51:24] where you're at in your walk with God
[51:25] God couldn't even deal with you if there
[51:28] wasn't Blood On The Mercy Seat you might
[51:31] say I'm not worthy of him dealing with
[51:33] me no one not one of us have been worthy
[51:36] of his Mercy in dealing with us but
[51:39] there has been a perfect sacrifice and
[51:42] God is moving through that sacrifice to
[51:46] deal with you and I to dismantle our own
[51:48] doubts about ourselves to say me how
[51:51] could I ever be a Christian how could I
[51:53] ever be a believer it is the inspiration
[51:56] of God pouring through the sacrifice
[52:01] [Music]
[52:03] what kind of a man this was I'll tell
[52:06] you what kind of a man he was it was
[52:08] bright material
[52:10] I'm looking at Sons and Daughters of God
[52:12] that are the same caliber of people
[52:14] tonight
[52:16] God could bestow a confidence on him
[52:20] and he knew brother said that he would
[52:22] not Twist from his word or from his
[52:26] being job was a man that would carry out
[52:28] God's Commandments to the letter and
[52:31] Satan knew that too
[52:36] and when God said
[52:38] you can you can touch him you can touch
[52:41] all this round but don't you take his
[52:42] life
[52:43] and brother Brandman used these words
[52:45] and he says Satan stretched that
[52:48] as far as he could stretch it
[52:51] he turned his closest friends
[52:54] against him
[52:58] is that right family against him his
[53:00] wife her breath was strange to him
[53:05] is that right now that speaks volumes
[53:08] right there
[53:09] they broke all things right in there
[53:12] even in the midst of closeness of things
[53:14] but yet in the midst of it God had
[53:17] confidence that his word would stand the
[53:20] test and the trial
[53:23] in job's life
[53:26] but the RAM would say it like this I
[53:28] want to break in on this and I've heard
[53:29] but now I see
[53:30] he said when a man or person has once
[53:33] really come in contact with god with
[53:36] that genuine revealed faith that God is
[53:41] there's nothing no time nowhere can ever
[53:45] separate that man from his God
[53:47] Paul said there's no Strife no hunger no
[53:50] pearls neither living creatures or death
[53:53] or anything can separate us from the
[53:55] love of God which is in Christ Jesus you
[53:58] are securely anchored in him because you
[54:02] were ordained to that life
[54:06] you didn't Merit it it was God in his
[54:09] grace even to brawl you and I to him to
[54:13] correct us to lead us into that place
[54:16] how would we no one is acceptable if God
[54:20] himself did not reveal himself to you
[54:24] and I
[54:25] that's Grace that we might receive that
[54:27] Grace and our lives be corrected by
[54:30] their Grace how is that how is that you
[54:33] were ordained for this life
[54:36] you ordained for it
[54:39] Satan thought he could twist him around
[54:41] a little bit puff him up make him do it
[54:45] but you see job with this perfect
[54:47] revelation of God and who God was and
[54:51] how God loved him
[54:54] it doesn't matter then I know how all of
[54:57] this is going to work out but to know
[54:59] who God is and I know he loves me
[55:03] oh yes Jesus Loves Me Not Just
[55:07] song but it's a Simplicity in our life
[55:10] as children of God
[55:12] [Applause]
[55:14] and this for me he's not only dealt with
[55:16] my life he deals with my life he
[55:18] ministers to my heart but he shed his
[55:20] own blood for me and he sent back the
[55:23] Holy Ghost
[55:24] for me I know he loves me I may
[55:29] [Applause]
[55:35] [Applause]
[55:38] not he waited
[55:40] no matter what the circumstance was he
[55:43] waited for his faith to be cons
[55:45] confirmed because he had had a grip on
[55:48] God a revelation
[55:51] Now watch how brother Ram will take this
[55:53] when the sick people that's in the
[55:54] building
[55:55] the crippled people or you that have a
[55:58] need of God when you can get that type
[55:59] of a revelation that you are Justified
[56:02] when you are actually justified in
[56:06] asking the thing that you're asking for
[56:09] and believe that he is a rewarder of
[56:13] those that diligently seek after him
[56:15] there's nothing can ever separate you
[56:17] from that Faith that's anchored to you
[56:20] but first it has to be revealed to you
[56:24] how many know that not only is the new
[56:26] birth of Revelation
[56:28] but for every need that God needs in our
[56:30] life it's God continuing to reveal
[56:32] himself
[56:33] right brother Brandon would tell us that
[56:36] the biggest part of our faith is mental
[56:38] faith right and he would tell us the
[56:41] night before he preaches this message he
[56:42] would tell us don't throw mental Faith
[56:44] away
[56:45] he said because mental faith if you can
[56:47] stay right with that that'll take you in
[56:49] to that Supernatural faith
[56:51] right the right mental attitude towards
[56:54] any Divine promise of God will bring it
[56:58] to pass
[57:00] brother random called that the adopted
[57:02] baby
[57:03] cannot have a baby of their own but then
[57:06] they adopt a baby there's an example
[57:08] here and there's an example right now
[57:09] you know of a certain music gospel music
[57:14] that we we listen to my family but at
[57:16] any rate here it is they adopted a child
[57:18] and it's exactly I told my wife the
[57:20] other day I said that's exactly what the
[57:22] prophet said because you know what
[57:22] happens with the adopted baby it takes
[57:25] the pressure off they can begin to relax
[57:27] they can begin to rest and that's why
[57:29] God gives his word it's not about what
[57:31] you think what you see or what you feel
[57:33] it's to take the word and confess the
[57:36] word that has come to you
[57:38] he is the high priest of our confession
[57:43] right brother Ram said you confess it
[57:46] you keep saying it until you believe it
[57:50] is that right he would go on to say in
[57:53] the Inner Man this the inside man that
[57:55] runs the ship not the outside man that's
[57:57] out here looking it's the inside man
[57:59] that makes him move but he said it's got
[58:01] to come from here down here and brother
[58:03] Randall would tell us over and over and
[58:04] over what is it he said continue to
[58:07] confess God's word that's why when
[58:09] you've ever come for any promise of God
[58:11] you confess it and you stay right with
[58:13] it because God when he made a promise he
[58:16] does not lie
[58:18] and when God has confirmed that promise
[58:20] to you that's for you to take a hold of
[58:22] that promise and say God I'm going to
[58:25] stand right here because you've revealed
[58:27] this promise and you'll come through
[58:29] every area of my life till that word
[58:31] becomes flesh in me
[58:35] Hallelujah
[58:36] mark 11. let's go into some of these
[58:39] principles here and hear Jesus they're
[58:42] passing by and the Bible says in Mark 11
[58:44] 21 and Peter calling to remember and
[58:47] said unto him Master behold the Fig Tree
[58:49] which thou cursed is withered away
[58:52] remember it had leaves
[58:53] but it didn't have figs
[58:55] right
[58:57] it was showing it shouldn't even had
[59:00] leaves but it was showing leaves so the
[59:03] leaves is why Jesus came to look for
[59:04] figs although he knew it wasn't time for
[59:06] figs so what was he dealing with he's
[59:09] getting down to the matter of things
[59:11] that would be truth from within
[59:14] now watch what he deals with here in
[59:16] verse 22 and Jesus answering and said
[59:18] unto them have faith in God remember
[59:20] he's calling look master that the Fig
[59:22] tree's dried up and he says have faith
[59:25] in God what was Jesus speaking to the
[59:28] life
[59:30] the life
[59:32] you see it indeed him address the
[59:34] outside and the leaves with her he did
[59:35] not say leaves wizard
[59:38] that's why you can try to change
[59:40] yourself on the outside and it's like
[59:41] trying to put on new leaves
[59:44] but let the spirit of God go down to the
[59:46] very root
[59:48] and then it's not changing leaves the
[59:51] life that was supplying to those leaves
[59:53] those attributes of unbelief Trey's up
[59:57] why because the very root is cursed
[1:00:02] then New Life takes hold and then there
[1:00:05] are new leaves that come on
[1:00:07] amen what does that the word of God
[1:00:10] addressing the issue in our life
[1:00:13] for verily I say unto you that whosoever
[1:00:16] shall say unto this mountain
[1:00:18] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[1:00:21] the sea and shall not doubt in his heart
[1:00:24] and I want you to notice this shall not
[1:00:26] doubt in his heart but shall believe
[1:00:29] that those things which he saith shall
[1:00:32] come to pass he shall have whatsoever he
[1:00:35] saith therefore I say unto you what
[1:00:38] things soever you desire when ye pray
[1:00:41] believe that ye shall receive them and
[1:00:45] ye shall have them
[1:00:48] and when you stand praying forgive if
[1:00:51] you have ought against any that your
[1:00:53] father also which is in heaven May
[1:00:55] forgive you your trespasses but if you
[1:00:58] do not forgive neither will your father
[1:01:02] which is in heaven forgive your
[1:01:05] trespasses
[1:01:06] and brother Ronald would stop right
[1:01:08] after that scripture in perfect faith
[1:01:11] and say to you and I faith is based on
[1:01:15] forgiveness
[1:01:16] now watch what he's saying and it's not
[1:01:18] just us forgiving others remember Jesus
[1:01:21] is dealing here in verse 25 and 26 with
[1:01:25] things that can hinder the principle
[1:01:28] work of faith
[1:01:30] that sometimes we it's understanding
[1:01:33] what's going on what's happening but
[1:01:35] it's a moment to examine our lives and
[1:01:39] knowing that all of this that as we are
[1:01:42] standing and we're always we are tried
[1:01:44] within this not just within the body of
[1:01:47] Believers here we are tried among our
[1:01:50] families we are tried in our jobs these
[1:01:54] are things these are just some areas
[1:01:56] that the enemy would like to place doubt
[1:01:59] in our heart you're saying well I don't
[1:02:01] doubt the word I don't doubt that God is
[1:02:04] but you see when there are things in
[1:02:06] verse 25 and verse 26 that are not where
[1:02:09] they ought to be that is doubt in the
[1:02:13] heart and the mountain can't move
[1:02:16] are you hearing me now
[1:02:18] so this is where brother Brown watch how
[1:02:21] he says this faith is based on
[1:02:23] forgiveness then and then it's these we
[1:02:25] said this morning it's not a perfect
[1:02:26] faith Trump were trying to get the
[1:02:30] people the church into the place to
[1:02:31] where we could really see Apostolic
[1:02:33] times moving Among Us that's what we all
[1:02:36] hunger and it's just laying right at the
[1:02:40] door we see it but we want to see more
[1:02:43] of it watch how he says it we want such
[1:02:45] a flow that it'll be a help to us
[1:02:49] and US flow out to others
[1:02:52] I want to see more of him and me I want
[1:02:55] to see more of him and me
[1:02:57] I want more of his life not just not
[1:02:59] just from me I want his life I just want
[1:03:02] to be a channel that his life can flow
[1:03:04] as a testimony to others he did it for
[1:03:06] brother Sammy he'd do it for anybody
[1:03:08] I want his life to I want it to be a
[1:03:10] Channel of encouragement of and
[1:03:12] refreshment of where it can it can
[1:03:14] encourage faith not not even maybe that
[1:03:16] if something that I have to say but just
[1:03:18] just his presence just being a conduit
[1:03:21] for his presence to be able to come
[1:03:25] is that right
[1:03:27] non-examination these things as I'm just
[1:03:30] pouring over you know it and looking and
[1:03:32] this particular chapter I have just I've
[1:03:35] meditated and very pondered since well
[1:03:37] probably since it was it has been since
[1:03:39] late last fall and some other things
[1:03:41] that I just you know in putting things
[1:03:43] down and looking out in this in this job
[1:03:47] 23 but I want to just deal with this
[1:03:50] part this thought on examination and you
[1:03:52] know there's re routine examinations
[1:03:54] that we have to go through
[1:03:58] sometimes whether it's our health or
[1:04:00] there's Building Inspections and
[1:04:02] everything else and those of you that
[1:04:03] know you work in factories and other
[1:04:06] places too there's certain times where
[1:04:07] even that they do mandatory shutdowns
[1:04:11] one of the brothers that I went with
[1:04:13] that I would travel to to be in order to
[1:04:16] go into Mexico last year that brother
[1:04:18] works on the the petroleum big petroleum
[1:04:21] plants it's very very dangerous of the
[1:04:23] things they do but it's where they have
[1:04:25] only certain amount of time that the
[1:04:27] petroleum companies are able to shut
[1:04:29] down and then they have to go through
[1:04:30] and do all of these maintenance things
[1:04:33] that are to be done pressurized and it's
[1:04:36] all of those things I couldn't even
[1:04:37] begin to relay all of it here tonight
[1:04:39] but it's enough that it has to be
[1:04:41] examined it's not just well we think we
[1:04:44] got a problem that's one thing but this
[1:04:47] is what we're talking about where
[1:04:48] there's routine examinations
[1:04:50] we know that even when we are looking at
[1:04:53] this this is why let me just say it like
[1:04:55] this this is why
[1:04:57] that we do not forsake to assemble
[1:04:59] ourselves together
[1:05:01] because the word of God has come to
[1:05:04] examine Our Lives
[1:05:07] now I hope you understand what I'm
[1:05:08] saying here I when we and I speak here
[1:05:11] in other places that the holy spirit
[1:05:12] will give utterance I'm not against
[1:05:14] streaming but I'm against streaming when
[1:05:16] it takes the place of us putting in
[1:05:19] perseverance to be in the house of God I
[1:05:22] think we're falling short when we could
[1:05:24] be here but instead we say well it's you
[1:05:27] know I'm a little tired I'm a little
[1:05:28] weary but you know there Comes A Time
[1:05:30] you you show what side you're on there's
[1:05:34] a time to persevere we're living listen
[1:05:36] we're living in an age an age of where
[1:05:38] everything is easy and let me just say
[1:05:40] it like this if you can apply the same
[1:05:43] model or mode of well you know I'm just
[1:05:46] a little tired I'm not going to go to
[1:05:47] the family picnic or I'm just a little
[1:05:49] tired I you know I'm not going to go to
[1:05:51] work today you know I'm just I'm just
[1:05:53] feeling a little bit back but if we in
[1:05:55] ourselves will push ourselves in other
[1:05:57] areas of our life that are not even the
[1:06:01] main reasons we're here for
[1:06:03] God did not bring us here upon this
[1:06:06] Earth in order for us to work
[1:06:10] are you hearing me church I'm not if if
[1:06:13] you know if I was so against it we
[1:06:15] wouldn't even have the streaming but I
[1:06:17] see to where that there are things and
[1:06:19] it's to to to admonish this is why we
[1:06:22] come to the house of God and I
[1:06:23] understand the thought can be asked well
[1:06:26] what's the difference if I'm sitting at
[1:06:27] home we're a part of a body yeah
[1:06:31] it's just like you going to a restaurant
[1:06:33] with all of us and you decide you're
[1:06:36] going to go sit in the corner of the
[1:06:37] restaurant and say well I went out with
[1:06:39] everybody to the same restaurant
[1:06:42] right that doesn't seem right
[1:06:45] you see being here being a part of the
[1:06:48] body I know I've talked not only to
[1:06:50] others but I've experienced it myself
[1:06:51] it's not the same as being here
[1:06:54] being in his presence
[1:06:57] and it's I know God has given Grace at
[1:06:59] moments when I've had to be in other
[1:07:01] places and I've sensed his presence as
[1:07:04] I've streamed the service but you know
[1:07:05] what if God wanted to use me to pray for
[1:07:09] somebody else I can't reach my hand
[1:07:11] through my phone my hand won't go
[1:07:13] through my iPad my hand won't go through
[1:07:15] the computer but God I am a part of the
[1:07:19] body I'm a conduit I want to be here in
[1:07:23] the atmosphere of the holy spirit for a
[1:07:26] routine examination
[1:07:28] [Music]
[1:07:30] I know I've used some I've used some of
[1:07:33] these doctors and situations where I
[1:07:35] speak to them on the phone I know they
[1:07:37] got clinics now where you go and you've
[1:07:39] been on the screen but it's not the same
[1:07:41] as having a doctor say come here
[1:07:44] all right or the doctors put it put the
[1:07:47] stethoscope breathe in breathe out not
[1:07:49] the same they cannot do that they can
[1:07:51] only go by what I'm telling them
[1:07:55] but when I'm in the presence of my
[1:07:57] doctor he can see more than what I'm
[1:08:00] telling him
[1:08:00] [Applause]
[1:08:02] he can look deeper into those things
[1:08:06] oh my he's not just writing out a
[1:08:08] generic prescription
[1:08:11] but he's dealing personally
[1:08:15] understand
[1:08:17] you see so it has streaming it has its
[1:08:20] place and that's not even a point here
[1:08:22] in my notes it has its place but I think
[1:08:25] this is where we must examine how are we
[1:08:28] using it
[1:08:29] are we using it so we can do other
[1:08:32] things on midweek service
[1:08:34] are we doing it well well outstream
[1:08:37] Thursday night on Friday morning
[1:08:39] how are we using it
[1:08:42] that's a necessary examination
[1:08:45] are you hearing me it is not about us
[1:08:48] making the word convenient for us
[1:08:52] it's us being available for him
[1:08:56] is that right talking about examination
[1:08:58] the Bible said forsake not to assemble
[1:09:02] yourselves together
[1:09:06] because the Bible tells us that the
[1:09:09] trial of our faith
[1:09:10] is more precious than gold is that right
[1:09:14] and many times those are scriptures that
[1:09:17] can be spoken or said or proclaimed in
[1:09:20] the midst of adversity
[1:09:23] and it's very true
[1:09:25] but yet
[1:09:26] it all has to come down to there are
[1:09:29] many forms of adversity trials
[1:09:33] test and then there's also chastening
[1:09:38] we must find where we are
[1:09:42] in order for faith
[1:09:44] to declare God is
[1:09:47] we must find where we are in order for
[1:09:51] Faith to declare and be certain of God
[1:09:54] because we could be declaring it's a oh
[1:09:56] this is a trial of my faith and yet
[1:09:59] there's nothing coming out of our life
[1:10:01] we continue in the same way let me tell
[1:10:04] you when God molds a person through a
[1:10:07] trial we're never the same
[1:10:10] it's more of us how many testimonies I
[1:10:13] have tonight on that less of me and more
[1:10:15] of him
[1:10:16] so that's the outcome of a trial so God
[1:10:19] bringing us into a purpose or to the
[1:10:22] principle we want to be certain of God
[1:10:25] that our faith is positioned to wait on
[1:10:28] the Lord even when he's silent
[1:10:33] because God will break his silence
[1:10:36] but in the meantime we want to have
[1:10:38] faith that is waiting in silence
[1:10:43] brother Brown says it like this in
[1:10:45] perfect Faith Abraham had to believe
[1:10:48] just what the voice told him and when he
[1:10:50] was a hundred years old 25 years later
[1:10:52] he was Stronger believing it than he was
[1:10:55] 25 years ago when it was give to him he
[1:10:58] believed it and he staggered knotted the
[1:11:01] promise of God through unbelief but was
[1:11:03] strong giving praise to God knowing that
[1:11:06] he was able to perform what he had
[1:11:10] promised
[1:11:12] and that's the way everyone must be that
[1:11:17] way
[1:11:19] let me just let me just comment on this
[1:11:21] just a moment Abraham what where and
[1:11:23] what brother random is referring to he
[1:11:25] had to yield to what the voice was
[1:11:27] saying
[1:11:29] Abraham
[1:11:30] even after the now the corrections
[1:11:34] misunderstandings of the promise you
[1:11:37] realize there was a period of time that
[1:11:39] Abraham had to wake up in the camp and
[1:11:42] see one before him that he realized I
[1:11:46] listened to my wife
[1:11:47] right he had Ishmael before him
[1:11:50] right he had all of these things that
[1:11:53] the enemy could try to come upon him and
[1:11:55] say look at you you failed time and time
[1:11:58] again you've tried to do things in your
[1:12:00] own way you've run down to Egypt you
[1:12:03] told a lie down there look at you you
[1:12:05] lost a lot he could the enemy could try
[1:12:07] to pour it on you say well brother saman
[1:12:09] what was it that Abraham was able to
[1:12:11] resist in a faith because his faith at
[1:12:15] the beginning came from hearing God
[1:12:17] speak to him so when the word would come
[1:12:20] and bring correction to Abraham's life
[1:12:22] Abraham not did not repent just because
[1:12:26] it was wrong his heart sent a man to the
[1:12:29] word of God and He Walked In God's word
[1:12:31] and that's why when the enemy could come
[1:12:34] there to accuse him he could stand
[1:12:36] Justified because he knew I am done all
[1:12:39] that God has said do when God said
[1:12:41] repent I have repented because my desire
[1:12:45] is to please the Lord
[1:12:48] principles for Faith to operate notice
[1:12:51] he says You must come with an unfailing
[1:12:54] faith believing that God made the
[1:12:57] promise but now you have to be in a
[1:13:00] position to have that Faith so be in a
[1:13:03] position
[1:13:04] to have that faith and that's what we're
[1:13:07] going to talk on to receive that faith
[1:13:10] First Corinthians 11 28.
[1:13:13] but let a man examine himself
[1:13:17] and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:13:19] drink of that cup let me just pause for
[1:13:20] a moment
[1:13:22] faith is sovereignly given let me just
[1:13:25] deal with this a moment
[1:13:27] when the New Birth has come it is where
[1:13:31] the faith of God that's been coming and
[1:13:33] influencing our faith has now come into
[1:13:37] the place there's come a uniting
[1:13:40] now it's not just us living by our own
[1:13:44] faith but now it's God's faith behind
[1:13:47] our faith when our faith would fail his
[1:13:51] faith abideth faithful
[1:13:53] is that right that's what Paul said I'm
[1:13:55] living by the faith of the Son of God
[1:13:57] who loved me and gave himself for me so
[1:14:00] there's a a faith that that that is
[1:14:03] operating from within and in situations
[1:14:06] in our life when it comes to a medical
[1:14:08] and financial all the different needs
[1:14:11] situations that can arise loved ones and
[1:14:13] things like that there's things that we
[1:14:15] could go and say well I'm just going to
[1:14:16] speak it and this is going to happen
[1:14:18] this way
[1:14:19] and we can find ourselves all frustrated
[1:14:21] because remember a word is sovereignly
[1:14:24] given by God
[1:14:26] no I don't understand there's a
[1:14:29] confession and we confess the promise of
[1:14:31] God
[1:14:32] but to speak and say this is how it's
[1:14:36] going to be that's a word that's
[1:14:38] sovereignly given from God
[1:14:40] is that right we can't I I we I can't
[1:14:42] work myself into it you can't we can't
[1:14:44] we can't pull it out we can't pull it
[1:14:46] out of anybody brother Brown remember he
[1:14:47] had people wanting to try to pull it out
[1:14:49] of him brother Brandon he'll just come
[1:14:50] and do this and if you'll just come it's
[1:14:51] that's not God was showing us that's not
[1:14:53] how he operates
[1:14:55] right there's some right motives there's
[1:14:57] right objectives with in everything so
[1:15:00] then we find that with this on faith
[1:15:02] think about when sister meedy was in
[1:15:04] this situation the tumor had come up in
[1:15:06] her life right you know the background
[1:15:09] the situation and what she had said to
[1:15:11] brother Brandon I don't want to
[1:15:12] deliberate on that for because that's
[1:15:14] not the point I want to make the point
[1:15:15] I'm looking at is here she comes to that
[1:15:17] place of where that she's the day before
[1:15:20] surgery and the Holy Spirit drops down
[1:15:24] in the hotel room in Shreveport and
[1:15:26] though and and and and brother Brown
[1:15:28] begins to make known to God Lord she
[1:15:30] stood between me and the public she's on
[1:15:31] my shirt she's and my clothes she's
[1:15:33] never said this Lord all of these things
[1:15:35] and the Holy Spirit said stand upon your
[1:15:37] feet and how you say it it shall be
[1:15:39] that's how it shall be and he spoke that
[1:15:42] word and then he called sister media he
[1:15:45] said tell him to give you one more
[1:15:46] examination
[1:15:48] what happened Faith dropped at that
[1:15:52] moment
[1:15:54] so don't let the enemy tell you that you
[1:15:56] don't have faith already from where
[1:15:59] you're standing but every situation must
[1:16:02] be God revealing his will and his word
[1:16:06] in that situation we're not wrong for
[1:16:09] saying by his stripes I'm Healed that's
[1:16:11] his word right brother random said he
[1:16:14] says this right here is even more sure
[1:16:16] the division
[1:16:19] yes is that right it doesn't matter the
[1:16:20] perfect faith God has already said it
[1:16:22] why was the Visions to declare that God
[1:16:25] is and what God has said that he steal
[1:16:27] God to keep his word that's why God made
[1:16:30] himself known in this generation
[1:16:34] that's why God continues to make himself
[1:16:36] known to you and I
[1:16:38] let a man examine himself
[1:16:41] and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:16:42] drink of that cup examine yourselves
[1:16:47] whether you be in the faith and prove
[1:16:49] your own self so notice this examining
[1:16:52] of ourselves
[1:16:55] it really takes a lot of honesty to
[1:16:57] examine ourselves now I'm not talking
[1:16:59] about the examining to where we put
[1:17:00] ourselves in a rabbit hole
[1:17:02] that's not what I'm talking about when
[1:17:04] God's word comes and as the Lord is
[1:17:07] dealing with our life and for us to
[1:17:09] examine ourselves in the light of God's
[1:17:11] word is not an invitation of
[1:17:15] condemnation but it is to examine
[1:17:17] ourselves that there might be certain
[1:17:19] things corrected
[1:17:21] it would be like this what if I just
[1:17:23] threw this shirt on and I never looked
[1:17:24] in the mirror and maybe there was a big
[1:17:26] old spot that was right here and then
[1:17:28] here I get up here tonight and then I
[1:17:29] have people looking at the spot instead
[1:17:31] of looking at me I don't know which one
[1:17:34] would look worse but anyhow you get the
[1:17:36] picture
[1:17:36] but you see a lot of things you will put
[1:17:38] on and you examine in the mirror you
[1:17:40] look at it first I maybe look at how my
[1:17:42] battalion's position look at certain
[1:17:44] things and you you checking it out what
[1:17:46] are you doing examining yourself
[1:17:48] if you look and you see a spot on your
[1:17:50] shirt you don't say oh there's no spot
[1:17:53] on my shirt
[1:17:55] no you change your shirt
[1:17:58] and listen this is the grace that God
[1:18:01] gives you and I to examine ourselves not
[1:18:05] to condemn ourselves examine ourselves
[1:18:09] so when we understand that here Faith
[1:18:13] must have we want Faith to have a Clear
[1:18:15] Channel
[1:18:16] for so it's available faith can flow
[1:18:19] through it this is why David said if I
[1:18:21] regard Psalm 66 18 if I regard iniquity
[1:18:25] in my heart the Lord will not hear me
[1:18:28] right if there's iniquity things that we
[1:18:31] know that's not right
[1:18:34] God will not hear us
[1:18:36] not only will he not hear us but it
[1:18:38] doesn't matter how anointed the man is
[1:18:40] that will pray for us
[1:18:42] same thing all right the prayer does not
[1:18:44] Cast Away the iniquity you have that
[1:18:47] Authority are you hearing me tonight
[1:18:50] you have that Authority but see how
[1:18:51] Satan wants to bring fear you see how
[1:18:54] deceitful Sin is Sin Works to bring fear
[1:18:58] to bring doubt to bring confusion
[1:19:01] to cause you to back away from the
[1:19:03] presence of God
[1:19:05] and God's desire is that we would stand
[1:19:07] in his presence Justified
[1:19:11] that's why the scripture could say my
[1:19:13] little children I write unto you sin not
[1:19:18] but if we sin
[1:19:20] we have an advocate with the father
[1:19:23] Jesus Christ the righteous
[1:19:27] he is the perpetuation of our sins and
[1:19:31] not of our sins only but of the whole
[1:19:34] world
[1:19:36] so what are you saying there's no excuse
[1:19:40] the doors are open the windows are open
[1:19:44] [Applause]
[1:19:46] there's a sacrifice that's already been
[1:19:49] made
[1:19:51] if I regarding iniquity in my heart the
[1:19:53] Lord will not hear me but verily God has
[1:19:55] heard me he has attended to the voice of
[1:19:57] my prayer First John 3 20. 40 of our
[1:20:00] heart condemn us God is greater than our
[1:20:03] hearts and knoweth all things beloved if
[1:20:07] our heart condemn us not then we have
[1:20:09] confidence toward God and whatsoever we
[1:20:13] ask we receive of him because we keep
[1:20:16] his Commandments and do those things
[1:20:18] that are pleasing in his sight
[1:20:20] you see this is where when we're looking
[1:20:22] at principles the position for Faith to
[1:20:25] operate through how how did that faith
[1:20:28] of Elohim reproduce itself in Abraham's
[1:20:31] life because Abraham walked with God and
[1:20:35] all that God asked him to do every
[1:20:37] correction every word Abraham continued
[1:20:40] to present himself in an examination
[1:20:43] before God
[1:20:48] so examinations
[1:20:50] and screenings
[1:20:51] are a part of our lives in the natural
[1:20:55] it's like maintenance checkups to ensure
[1:20:57] that things are running
[1:20:58] into individual capacity you know you
[1:21:00] don't keep up with your car
[1:21:02] it'll affect major parts
[1:21:05] right you don't take account of regular
[1:21:10] Parts in our body
[1:21:12] it can lead to affect other things
[1:21:15] is that right don't worry this is still
[1:21:17] a church it's not a clinic
[1:21:20] but you see it's everything that we
[1:21:22] would be in good health this is why
[1:21:24] David could say in Psalms 26 2 examine
[1:21:26] Me O Lord and prove me trauma Reigns in
[1:21:31] my heart search me o God Psalms 139 and
[1:21:34] know my heart try me and know my
[1:21:37] thoughts
[1:21:39] that's my desire
[1:21:41] why I want to remain in that position
[1:21:44] God if there's things that need to be
[1:21:45] uncovered uncover it
[1:21:48] is that right
[1:21:50] see why why we're in the midst of a test
[1:21:53] or trial remember tests and trials are
[1:21:56] permitted by God not as correction
[1:22:00] chastening is his correction
[1:22:04] right
[1:22:06] and these are the things that with when
[1:22:08] we're in the midst of a tester trout
[1:22:10] like job was
[1:22:12] we want to be in a position for Faith to
[1:22:16] operate and wait on God
[1:22:19] we don't want to be tied down where
[1:22:21] there's iniquity bubbling up and there's
[1:22:24] things that are just not uh the checkups
[1:22:26] aren't going right
[1:22:28] let me say this to you
[1:22:30] let me go on let me let me go on
[1:22:33] verse 24 and see if there be any wicked
[1:22:35] way in me and Lead Me in the way
[1:22:37] Everlasting
[1:22:39] you know I I know I'm speaking there's
[1:22:42] plenty of medical things here maybe we
[1:22:44] could open a clinic all these medical
[1:22:47] individuals in here God bless you thank
[1:22:49] you
[1:22:51] you know a wellness exam it's a
[1:22:53] preventative care
[1:22:55] and you know as you start getting into
[1:22:56] my it seems like from whenever in the
[1:22:58] beginning you know when you are I
[1:23:00] remember the earliest times of my life I
[1:23:02] I I actually remember my mom worked she
[1:23:06] worked on the second floor the first
[1:23:07] floor of that building was the health
[1:23:08] department I hated going by those stairs
[1:23:12] there was a little nurse that she was
[1:23:14] about this tall little gray-haired woman
[1:23:16] but boy she could pack a punch with a
[1:23:18] with a felt like it was a bazooka but it
[1:23:21] was a shot
[1:23:23] hated them shots and you know when
[1:23:26] you're you're getting those shots when
[1:23:27] you're at a young age it seems like they
[1:23:29] keep on you know they're like
[1:23:32] you know
[1:23:34] and here they are the little kids are
[1:23:36] walking
[1:23:37] you know and they give you a sucker like
[1:23:38] that's supposed to you know replace
[1:23:40] getting shot up like that
[1:23:43] but you know they give you like because
[1:23:44] when you're going to school you they
[1:23:45] have your shot records and all this
[1:23:47] right here you know we don't want you
[1:23:48] passing rabies to the next person and
[1:23:50] all this I mean you know it's things
[1:23:52] they're trying to do as preventative
[1:23:55] right
[1:23:59] then you come into all other times of
[1:24:01] your life
[1:24:02] you start getting older and they start
[1:24:03] saying um
[1:24:04] time to start having this screening done
[1:24:07] time to start having this screening done
[1:24:09] time to start having this screening done
[1:24:11] time to start having this screening done
[1:24:15] and by the way in the middle of all
[1:24:17] these screenings go ahead and pick out
[1:24:18] your burial plots
[1:24:25] you know what I'm saying
[1:24:27] not and bringing this down to our
[1:24:30] individual walk with God
[1:24:33] many times it's Wellness exams that
[1:24:37] people don't want
[1:24:39] because what is it it becomes fearful
[1:24:42] what if they find something
[1:24:45] then it'll give you more time perhaps
[1:24:48] they can address the situation before it
[1:24:51] spreads in the church I mean spreads to
[1:24:52] your I mean spreads to other things in
[1:24:54] your life
[1:24:56] they can address it before it eventually
[1:24:58] affects your whole family and affects
[1:25:01] you
[1:25:02] it's called Wellness
[1:25:04] examination talking about standing in a
[1:25:08] position
[1:25:09] for Faith to be
[1:25:11] a lot of times you know how it is you
[1:25:13] come into that examination they check
[1:25:15] your height and you hope that the scale
[1:25:17] isn't working that day maybe some of you
[1:25:19] do I don't know and look at that and I
[1:25:21] think you know and they're sliding out
[1:25:24] you think man this come on now let it
[1:25:26] stop right there nope come over here oh
[1:25:29] and there's more you know and they're
[1:25:31] checking you know why because as they're
[1:25:33] checking with our aides they're checking
[1:25:35] the height they're checking weight and
[1:25:37] the other thing they do with I'm not
[1:25:38] talking about when we're sick I'm just
[1:25:39] talking about Wellness when we feel good
[1:25:41] you know I'm not sure not many of us go
[1:25:44] to the doctor when we feel good why are
[1:25:45] you here I mean I'm here for a wellness
[1:25:48] check
[1:25:49] that's called a health nerd
[1:25:51] nah I'm not discouraging that I know
[1:25:54] there's a lot of things that come along
[1:25:55] in that way there's a lot of brothers
[1:25:57] that actually have been benefited even
[1:25:59] in the brother I just spoke for uh where
[1:26:02] they're able to go through and he had an
[1:26:03] open heart surgery and just doing
[1:26:05] phenomenal but I I say it in this way
[1:26:07] that there are things that they begin to
[1:26:10] look at with family history they begin
[1:26:12] to review the medical oh you see what it
[1:26:15] is is that it begins to look at that
[1:26:18] you've had a problem with forgiveness in
[1:26:19] your family
[1:26:21] so we need to let the word hone in on
[1:26:23] this because though you can be connected
[1:26:26] with the Tree of Life but you don't want
[1:26:29] your natural to rule over the spiritual
[1:26:31] other Can Be Strings and channels and
[1:26:34] things that we want to look at and say
[1:26:36] God in my life I don't know about
[1:26:38] anybody else in my family but in my life
[1:26:41] the cycle stops here
[1:26:43] right here the Cycle's broken we're not
[1:26:46] going to go through the recycle of
[1:26:47] Revival and death right here the cycle
[1:26:50] stops
[1:26:53] right they ask you to bring a lot of
[1:26:55] copies of medical records and you know
[1:26:57] current medications you're on you come
[1:27:00] to the house of God there's things
[1:27:01] you're praying about in your own life I
[1:27:03] Trust You Are Lord there's things that I
[1:27:06] I want to Lord grant me overcoming in
[1:27:08] this area of my life Lord I need
[1:27:10] strength in this room in my life I need
[1:27:12] direction and Discerning my life you're
[1:27:14] coming there are needs that you have and
[1:27:16] you're praying and you're bringing your
[1:27:18] needs before God
[1:27:19] that's a wellness examination
[1:27:24] but then there's times when the doctor
[1:27:25] can find something through that Wellness
[1:27:27] examination
[1:27:28] and he says hey
[1:27:30] we need to do something here
[1:27:32] like my father-in-law said him back
[1:27:34] there they did the they did an open
[1:27:35] heart surgery
[1:27:37] but you know before they did that open
[1:27:38] heart surgery and I remember many
[1:27:39] different things with my dad as well
[1:27:41] before they just you know took him out
[1:27:43] and put him on the table and every he
[1:27:46] had to go through some other
[1:27:49] tests
[1:27:50] to make sure when they did that it would
[1:27:54] take effect
[1:27:56] so sometimes God deals with our life in
[1:28:00] areas but he has to examine how is your
[1:28:03] blood doing how is your life doing where
[1:28:06] is your walk with God and what's he
[1:28:08] doing he'll begin to examine our ears
[1:28:10] what if your ears been entertaining what
[1:28:12] have your eyes been seeing what has your
[1:28:15] mouth been speaking what has your mind
[1:28:17] been dwelling upon where is your heart
[1:28:19] at in this situation
[1:28:21] well have your feet man where are your
[1:28:23] goings he begins to examine why
[1:28:27] so that we might be in a perfect
[1:28:30] position
[1:28:32] for the procedure
[1:28:33] to take effect
[1:28:37] a position
[1:28:38] for Faith to be able to stand and say
[1:28:41] I'm certain
[1:28:43] I've done all that he's told me to do
[1:28:46] everything he's brought to my attention
[1:28:48] I've made it right I confess that I I've
[1:28:52] lined myself with him that faith
[1:28:56] might have a channel
[1:28:57] to operate through
[1:28:59] what a privilege
[1:29:01] what a privilege to be examined
[1:29:04] by the Holy Spirit
[1:29:07] but REM said so many times in my life he
[1:29:09] said I've had to trace down through my
[1:29:12] life
[1:29:13] turn over stones
[1:29:17] and find
[1:29:19] is there anything Lord
[1:29:22] that's out of line
[1:29:24] because if our heart condemns us
[1:29:26] God won't hear us
[1:29:30] if we regard iniquity in our heart now
[1:29:33] maybe sitting here tonight there's you
[1:29:35] know there's nothing in your heart
[1:29:38] nothing in our hearts but this is a
[1:29:40] principle to understand if there is
[1:29:43] anything in our life and let me just say
[1:29:45] this God is not one you've heard me
[1:29:48] always say this he doesn't make you
[1:29:50] guess the Bible said if our heart
[1:29:53] condemns us
[1:29:55] God is greater than our heart
[1:30:00] and you know what God has a way
[1:30:04] of so dealing with our lives to help us
[1:30:08] that our life there's a walk and there's
[1:30:10] a balance with him we want to stay in a
[1:30:13] place I just close on this tonight to
[1:30:15] where our lives are a channel
[1:30:18] that faith can flow through
[1:30:22] a channel that where we're able to stand
[1:30:24] when God is silent
[1:30:27] we can say God I'm standing here waiting
[1:30:31] on you to confirm my faith
[1:30:35] because my faith is fixed in you Lord
[1:30:38] and you know to the of the of the grace
[1:30:40] that's given that if there's anything
[1:30:42] that's out of line
[1:30:44] this is the grace that's given to us
[1:30:46] like it was to Abraham we are seeds of
[1:30:48] Abraham if there's anything make it
[1:30:50] right you've got to make it right with
[1:30:52] somebody go make it right with somebody
[1:30:54] there's things that has to be confessed
[1:30:57] and made right make it right before God
[1:30:59] if there's something God's dealt with
[1:31:00] your life on make it right with God and
[1:31:03] then you're able to stand there and say
[1:31:06] I know where I'm standing
[1:31:08] I know where I'm standing
[1:31:11] God in his grace dealing with our life
[1:31:14] bringing us into that position
[1:31:16] is that where you want to be
[1:31:19] that's why I want to dwell I want to
[1:31:21] dwell in that place sensitive to his
[1:31:24] presence when there's things that isn't
[1:31:26] working right
[1:31:27] I wanted I will lord it's not you that's
[1:31:30] not working it's me see we want to have
[1:31:33] a faith to where it's not just oh this
[1:31:36] trial that I'm in and it may not be a
[1:31:37] trial friends I don't say that to
[1:31:39] condemn or put anybody down but I think
[1:31:41] sometimes we call all adversity trials
[1:31:44] and tests and all adversity is not
[1:31:47] trials and tests some adversity is
[1:31:50] chastening
[1:31:51] it's correction
[1:31:53] that God wants to come and get our
[1:31:56] attention that we not turn our attention
[1:31:58] on everybody else
[1:32:00] but in our own self
[1:32:02] is that the spot on my shirt I'm not
[1:32:04] looking at your shirt I'm looking at my
[1:32:06] shirt
[1:32:07] I'm not looking at your time looking at
[1:32:08] my time I'm looking at who I am
[1:32:11] beholding in the mirror
[1:32:13] is that right because every man must
[1:32:16] rise and fall to his own master
[1:32:19] and so we recognize it let every man
[1:32:21] examine himself
[1:32:24] and we can stand there in the word of
[1:32:26] God and allow the Holy Spirit to just
[1:32:28] examine and when I say allowing him say
[1:32:30] yes Lord be it unto me and allow the
[1:32:33] spirit of God just to come down and if
[1:32:35] there's anything that's not right God
[1:32:37] will come right down as we invite him
[1:32:39] through a real repentance
[1:32:41] what does he do he cleans it out that we
[1:32:44] might have a channel
[1:32:45] that's why even in any promise of God
[1:32:47] that you're seeking for you might be
[1:32:49] seeking for the Holy Ghost you might be
[1:32:51] seeking for healing all of those things
[1:32:54] is Faith revealed but let me just say to
[1:32:57] you
[1:32:58] what do you do after you come to a
[1:33:01] routine exam
[1:33:02] what do you do
[1:33:04] I mean for those of you that have
[1:33:06] insurance what do you do after you go to
[1:33:08] a doctor's visit
[1:33:09] do you just take the paperwork and say
[1:33:12] throw it on the table
[1:33:15] I know sometimes we don't like what the
[1:33:17] doctor is going to say to us
[1:33:22] he starts looking at our weight oh
[1:33:26] you know we're wanting to hear words
[1:33:29] that are pleasing
[1:33:32] years doing so well
[1:33:35] my your physique is perfect
[1:33:39] you're BMI is precious
[1:33:45] instead when they start getting along
[1:33:46] them lines we know when they start
[1:33:48] dealing with certain areas they're going
[1:33:51] to start messing with our diets
[1:33:55] they're going to start telling us about
[1:33:58] things that we are enjoying
[1:34:02] we like
[1:34:05] but you know what
[1:34:07] there comes a time that we have to come
[1:34:09] to that place and listen to what the
[1:34:11] doctor is saying
[1:34:13] now I'm talking about Dr Jesus tonight
[1:34:16] he ain't like
[1:34:18] the political machines of this nation
[1:34:22] that tells you don't eat eggs and then
[1:34:24] they come back and eat eggs and don't
[1:34:26] eat butter and don't this G I'm God and

[1:45:44] her to an action
[1:45:46] brother Bremen begins to talk about
[1:45:48] iniquity
[1:45:49] he talks about that dealing in his life
[1:45:52] with the tax case
[1:45:53] takes a good period of time in that
[1:45:55] service
[1:45:58] and brother Bram comes to the end of it
[1:45:59] and he's asking for the people
[1:46:02] he said I wonder how many
[1:46:04] he said
[1:46:06] would be willing to stand and say God
[1:46:09] I've got iniquity but I'm asking you to
[1:46:11] forgive me
[1:46:12] it's things that I'm standing in need of
[1:46:15] and how the Holy Spirit would would
[1:46:17] beckon
[1:46:19] those things sometimes you know it's
[1:46:20] things that we can look at and
[1:46:23] we can try to say well this really don't
[1:46:25] matter that don't mean too much but
[1:46:27] you know everything matters
[1:46:30] everything matters
[1:46:32] the Bible tells us the little foxes
[1:46:35] spoil the vine
[1:46:39] and so everything matters and brother
[1:46:41] Brian will come to the end of that this
[1:46:42] is what I want you to see
[1:46:44] he said you know sometimes even how God
[1:46:46] can take situations he said even
[1:46:48] iniquity
[1:46:51] and through that draws closer to him

[1:47:01] leg of the flight yesterday
[1:47:04] and how brother Brown said you know what
[1:47:05] it is how God will draw us closer he
[1:47:08] said because we realize if God take
[1:47:12] would take his hand off our lives for a
[1:47:14] moment where would we be you know it
[1:47:17] makes us to realize God I want every
[1:47:19] part of my life in your hands

[1:47:24] hands Lord

[1:48:33] oh you are
[1:48:36] the one
[1:48:39] I pray
[1:48:43] [Music]
[1:48:46] Hallelujah
[1:48:48] let's just we want to just go to the
[1:48:51] Lord in prayer
[1:48:52] amen and just as we're being dismissed
[1:48:56] presence of one another I want to just
[1:48:59] say we know different ones of you have
[1:49:01] been to see sister Doris and she's right
[1:49:04] out there at the Ava Avon Cleveland
[1:49:07] Clinic right off Nagle Road it's the
[1:49:08] rehabilitation part so it's beyond the
[1:49:11] hospital and I know she had spoke to me
[1:49:13] even of different ones that have come
[1:49:14] and I think sister Caroline you were
[1:49:16] even there last night as well and and
[1:49:18] you know friends what those what that
[1:49:20] means in the midst of this moment and so
[1:49:24] we were there this morning and early
[1:49:28] this afternoon and you know we want to
[1:49:30] continue to pray for sister Doris
[1:49:31] through this through this time and that
[1:49:34] God will just see her through
[1:49:37] and I gave the testimony as I stood
[1:49:39] there today
[1:49:41] son and daughter was in the room and I
[1:49:43] gave the testimony
[1:49:44] of where God
[1:49:46] brought my dad through
[1:49:48] where he had lost all form of speech
[1:49:50] could not even move his right side
[1:49:53] and God completely restored him
[1:49:56] and so
[1:49:58] God is still the same
[1:50:00] and God cares sometimes friends the way
[1:50:03] God works we may not understand
[1:50:06] but I just say that in the midst of this
[1:50:08] right here as we stood there today just
[1:50:10] just to minister to encourage to
[1:50:13] strengthen and I know that I know that
[1:50:15] God has everything in control
[1:50:17] and so you know we want to continue to
[1:50:19] pray for him sister Doris God will just
[1:50:22] move for her and touch her she still
[1:50:25] with the problems with the walking but
[1:50:28] there's been improvements as far as able
[1:50:30] to touch now the with her left hand the
[1:50:33] index finger to the nose we say praise
[1:50:35] God every every it will take every inch
[1:50:38] every footstep is possession
[1:50:40] so we thank God for that and then it is
[1:50:42] every step by step as things continue to
[1:50:45] come along and for the mark and sunny
[1:50:47] and Olivia were there and you know she
[1:50:48] was wanting to talk to me and I said you
[1:50:51] you know I was wanting to tell her you
[1:50:52] know you don't have you don't have to
[1:50:53] say much at all but I know she has to
[1:50:55] that's part of the therapy they had they

[1:51:01] breath now and talk
[1:51:04] Ed then her voice got louder when she
[1:51:06] would take that in so

[1:51:28] the Bible said he's not quick to forget
[1:51:29] our work and labor of love
[1:51:32] and the Bible says his brother Brahm
[1:51:34] tells us and actually his brother
[1:51:35] Neville was praying and brother Neville

[1:51:38] identifications of the Church of the
[1:51:40] Living God he said God let us
[1:51:43] remember and go and minister to others
[1:51:46] that are in hard trials in
[1:51:49] in tough moments knowing that we
[1:51:51] ourselves will come into hard times as
[1:51:54] well

[1:52:34] sparrows and put them together he said
[1:52:36] and nobody would even give you a penny
