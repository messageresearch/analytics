[38:37] a few little housekeeping things to take
[38:41] care of before we
[38:42] just invite brother andrew out and i
[38:45] want to say
[38:46] it's just been really thankful for
[38:48] brother andrew and sister moriah that
[38:50] they would
[38:51] make the sacrifice to be here with us in
[38:53] these meetings
[38:55] and truly as brother andrew the lord
[38:57] used a brother
[38:59] friday and saturday it's really
[39:02] throughout that there was the statements
[39:04] that were made on friday night and then
[39:05] it continued to amplify even last night
[39:08] we're not gathered around a personality
[39:13] this message that god has sent to us
[39:17] god revealed himself to the prophet
[39:20] gave the revelation the word that need
[39:22] to be spoken
[39:24] and the same mighty angel that revealed
[39:27] himself to the prophet
[39:28] is the same mighty angel that's here
[39:30] with us
[39:31] revealing his word to our hearts
[39:36] we're not looking to any man to give me
[39:38] sense about the message
[39:40] no no no no no there's only one who has
[39:43] been lifted up in our midst and that's
[39:45] the lord jesus christ
[39:48] and that's what this message has done
[39:51] it has lifted up the lord jesus christ
[39:54] to draw
[39:54] the children of god into the place
[39:58] that god has ordained for them to be in
[40:01] him
[40:01] from before the foundation of the world
[40:04] amen and from this uniting from this
[40:06] time
[40:07] we go to that other land amen we receive
[40:11] the token
[40:12] for our destination and assurance that
[40:15] over there we are going over there
[40:18] we have a reservation that's already
[40:20] been made
[40:21] the reservation was already set before
[40:24] the foundation of the world
[40:26] amen when the lamb when the lamb was
[40:28] thought of we were in
[40:29] that thinking we are the sons of god
[40:33] who shouted for joy we know what we're
[40:35] shouting about
[40:36] we're shouting about the salvation of
[40:39] the lord
[40:40] of the lamb of what he has brought to
[40:42] our lives
[40:44] it's not a historical event it's a
[40:46] reality to us
[40:47] we were included we were in him we got
[40:50] up with him on that easter morning
[40:52] and now we are seated in power with him
[40:55] by the baptism of the holy ghost amen
[40:58] it's
[40:58] it's a reality that those things as god
[41:01] just continues to make that more and
[41:03] more real
[41:04] to you and i because god's desire in our
[41:07] in our lives in our walk
[41:08] is that our walk would not be dependent
[41:11] upon any mortal
[41:12] but our walk would be solely dependent
[41:16] upon him amen and he's faithful who's
[41:19] who began the good work
[41:21] to finish it amen as we've looked at it
[41:24] here in some of the sundays god doesn't
[41:26] set that i sit down and say oh boy i got
[41:28] into this this is this is bigger than
[41:30] what i can deal with no no
[41:32] god knows all he asks is us to surrender
[41:35] us yield god steps in when we surrender
[41:38] and he then comes and does through our
[41:42] yielding
[41:42] what he's already sown within our life
[41:45] amen so we just
[41:46] we just want to just i'm just so
[41:48] thankful about that
[41:50] it's god who's right here in our midst
[41:53] it's him who's leading us
[41:54] amen so we just i want to just as i said
[41:58] thank you to brother andrew and sister
[42:00] mariah for coming and
[42:02] i just really appreciate how brother
[42:04] brother andrew just yielded to the lord
[42:06] in his stand
[42:07] for this message and sister mariah how
[42:11] old is brother andrew
[42:13] 25 i i know i've asked that many
[42:15] different times because
[42:17] to me he don't preach like he's 25.
[42:21] you know i told him the other night and
[42:23] i got back to the office i said i think
[42:24] i'll just start carrying briefcases
[42:27] i'll charge you all those ipads for you
[42:30] just give me your ipad i'll charge them
[42:31] for you and get it set up for you know
[42:33] but i'm thankful how god has every
[42:34] unique gift in the body
[42:37] and god knew that you and i would need
[42:39] that it's just like when you think of
[42:40] you sisters and brothers when you go to
[42:42] do your landscaping or you decorate your
[42:44] home
[42:45] you need certain things of contrast and
[42:47] it causes other things to stand out
[42:50] and god has a god he's a god of variety
[42:53] god made us the way he wanted us and
[42:54] there's a certain way
[42:56] and a reason why god has us the way he
[42:58] has us
[42:59] all we need to do is just yield to what
[43:01] he's chosen to be
[43:03] amen and that's you know that's all god
[43:06] asks but
[43:07] well anyhow i just i just so appreciate
[43:10] the goodness of the lord i tell you i
[43:12] just i don't know i just love bathing in

[59:16] and amen the book of mark the eighth
[59:18] chapter
[59:20] the 34th verse here and when he had
[59:22] called the people
[59:23] unto him with his disciples also he said
[59:26] unto them
[59:28] whosoever will come after me let him
[59:31] deny himself
[59:32] take up his cross and follow me
[59:36] for whosoever will save his life shall
[59:38] lose it
[59:39] but whoever whosoever shall lose his
[59:41] life for my sake
[59:43] and the gospels the same shall save it
[59:46] for what shall it profit a man if he
[59:48] shall gain the whole world
[59:50] and lose his own soul or what shall a
[59:52] man give in exchange
[59:54] for his soul whosoever therefore shall
[59:56] be ashamed of me
[59:58] and of my words in this adulterous and
[1:00:01] sinful generation
[1:00:02] of him also shall the son of man be
[1:00:06] ashamed i in that isn't that something
[1:00:08] of him also shall the son of man be
[1:00:10] ashamed
[1:00:11] when he cometh glory of his father
[1:00:15] with the holy angels i also want to look

[1:00:28] and he's going to use the same word that
[1:00:30] jesus uses there in mark
[1:00:32] 8. in romans 1 the chapter 1 and the
[1:00:34] 13th verse
[1:00:36] he said now i would not have you
[1:00:38] ignorant brethren that often
[1:00:40] i purpose to come unto you but was led
[1:00:43] hither too

[1:01:40] of our identification unashamed
[1:01:43] of our identification and i was just
[1:01:46] recently listening to the tape the
[1:01:47] problem of god preaches in december of
[1:01:49] 1959
[1:01:50] and he calls it identified with christ
[1:01:53] identified
[1:01:54] with christ and in the end of that
[1:01:56] sermon amen just to read this quote and
[1:01:58] maybe lay a foundation if that's okay
[1:02:00] he said we are standing in the shadow of
[1:02:03] the just justice of god
[1:02:05] every time that two or three are
[1:02:07] gathered together in the name of jesus
[1:02:09] christ
[1:02:10] he promised he would be in their midst
[1:02:12] now i don't know i guess part of the
[1:02:14] prayer cards is taken up some of you may
[1:02:16] still have them
[1:02:17] many of you don't even have prayer cards
[1:02:19] but it doesn't matter
[1:02:20] whether you have or whether you have not
[1:02:23] amen if you're sick
[1:02:24] you're sick and if you're if this god
[1:02:26] amen who wrote this bible then do you
[1:02:29] solemnly believe in him how many
[1:02:31] will say this morning i solemnly believe
[1:02:33] in the god who wrote this bible
[1:02:35] he said if you will solemnly believe in
[1:02:37] him if he shall return again
[1:02:40] into our midst to prove himself besides
[1:02:43] amen of the preaching of the word that
[1:02:46] he's here
[1:02:47] he's been convincing sinners that he's
[1:02:48] here if he's here to heal the sick and
[1:02:51] would reveal the cause as he did when he
[1:02:53] was here on earth
[1:02:54] then will you gladly accept your healing
[1:02:56] if you will
[1:02:57] he said just raise your hands just
[1:02:59] everywhere now he said and if he will do
[1:03:01] so
[1:03:02] and will identify himself you should be
[1:03:05] ashamed
[1:03:05] not to identify yourself with him then
[1:03:08] amen you should do it now the prophet of
[1:03:11] god here is saying there is an order
[1:03:13] to these services he said there's a
[1:03:15] there's a testimony then there is the
[1:03:17] preaching of the word
[1:03:18] he said now we've come to the time where
[1:03:20] we're going to pray for the sick
[1:03:21] he said when what we're going to do is
[1:03:23] we're going to ask the god who wrote the
[1:03:25] bible
[1:03:26] he meant to come into the midst of the
[1:03:27] church and to confirm
[1:03:29] amen that he is the one that wrote the
[1:03:31] bible and he is the one here to perform
[1:03:34] amen the desire of the heart if he
[1:03:36] should come in here
[1:03:37] amen and do these things then would you
[1:03:40] amen identify
[1:03:41] yourself with him now i'll ask you this
[1:03:43] morning amen if the god who wrote the
[1:03:45] bible was to come into this building
[1:03:47] this morning which i believe he is here
[1:03:49] he meant would you be ashamed to say
[1:03:51] that's my lord
[1:03:52] would you be ashamed if you saw somebody
[1:03:55] come up to an altar
[1:03:56] and bow down and begin to pray and ask
[1:03:58] god to set him free from some spirit
[1:04:00] he meant in that that spirit of that
[1:04:02] oppression lift up off of their lives
[1:04:04] and
[1:04:04] they would begin to rejoice and begin to
[1:04:06] praise god would you be ashamed
[1:04:08] amen to say that's my lord doing that if
[1:04:10] you would see somebody
[1:04:12] amen that had no no victory and the
[1:04:14] power of god would come in the meeting
[1:04:15] this morning
[1:04:16] and would fill that vessel with victory
[1:04:18] would you be ashamed
[1:04:20] he meant to say that's my lord doing
[1:04:22] that i i don't believe we're ashamed
[1:04:24] here this morning but i believe we are
[1:04:26] amen if i can sit this way we are proud
[1:04:28] amen to be identified with the lord
[1:04:30] jesus christ we
[1:04:32] there are many gods we could be
[1:04:33] identified with we could be identified
[1:04:35] with buddha or muhammad
[1:04:36] amen and all those gods are dead this
[1:04:39] morning but we are here
[1:04:40] he met identified with the one true and
[1:04:43] living god
[1:04:44] amen and his name is the lord jesus
[1:04:46] christ said me
[1:04:47] let me say this with everything within
[1:04:49] me this message did not come
[1:04:51] amen to replace the lord jesus christ it
[1:04:54] came to reveal
[1:04:55] amen the lord jesus christ and to put an
[1:04:57] assurity
[1:04:58] in the heart of the believer that they
[1:05:00] are not ashamed he meant to be
[1:05:02] identified with the god of abraham isaac
[1:05:04] and of jacob now
[1:05:06] in psalms 119 verse 1 david says amen
[1:05:09] blessed are the undefiled in the way
[1:05:11] amen who walk in the law of the lord

[1:05:30] thy statues
[1:05:31] amen david said then shall i not be
[1:05:33] ashamed
[1:05:34] amen when i have respect unto all thy
[1:05:37] commandments amen
[1:05:38] amen david is saying when i have respect
[1:05:41] unto all thy commandments
[1:05:42] i will not be ashamed isaiah will say it
[1:05:44] like this in chapter 50
[1:05:46] and verse 7 for the lord god will help
[1:05:48] me amen how many believes the lord god
[1:05:51] will help you

[1:06:12] amen serve god half-heartedly but rather
[1:06:14] i will seek
[1:06:15] he'd been to serve the living god with
[1:06:17] my whole heart
[1:06:18] amen when i begin to think about the age
[1:06:20] we're living in it's an age of
[1:06:21] identification
[1:06:23] the problem of god will say we're living
[1:06:25] in a day when identification is required
[1:06:28] identification
[1:06:29] amen it's not an option today
[1:06:31] identification is required you say oh
[1:06:33] it's an option no it's not amen amen you

[1:06:50] amen you've got to have your
[1:06:51] identification right
[1:06:52] amen now watch this it's amazing to me
[1:06:55] it's an age of identification he said
[1:06:57] unless you're known at a bank you can't
[1:06:59] cast your check unless you have
[1:07:00] something
[1:07:01] he meant to identify yourself he said
[1:07:03] i'll he said my wife here she can't cast
[1:07:05] her check
[1:07:06] he said because she don't drive she has
[1:07:08] no social security number
[1:07:10] he meant nothing to identify herself he
[1:07:12] meant you've got to be
[1:07:14] you've got to be some official amen
[1:07:16] identification and i think
[1:07:18] it's just the time that we're living in
[1:07:20] if you notice
[1:07:21] amen you go to a certain denominational
[1:07:23] church amen like methodist presbyterian
[1:07:26] lutheran or something
[1:07:27] amen and you have to something amen to
[1:07:29] identify yourself if you're even going
[1:07:31] to speak
[1:07:32] amen you have to have a credential or a
[1:07:34] card or a fellowship card or something
[1:07:37] amen to identify yourself as where they
[1:07:40] know where you come from
[1:07:42] and what you're going to say at the
[1:07:43] platform you have to be identified
[1:07:46] he meant it's an age of identification
[1:07:48] then then your identification is in a
[1:07:51] surety
[1:07:52] he meant to that denomination that
[1:07:53] you're not going to say anything amen
[1:07:56] that's going to cross their traditions
[1:07:57] you're not going to
[1:07:58] you're not going to teach any doctrine
[1:08:00] that's going to cross their bylaws
[1:08:02] amen they want to see that fellowship
[1:08:04] card amen in this age of identification
[1:08:06] we're living in
[1:08:07] it's also a time of an identity crisis
[1:08:10] think about that
[1:08:11] in a time where more identification is
[1:08:13] required
[1:08:14] amen than ever before is also a time he
[1:08:17] meant of an identity crisis now the word
[1:08:19] identity crisis means
[1:08:21] amen a period of uncertainty amen and
[1:08:24] confusion in which a person's sense of
[1:08:26] identity
[1:08:27] amen becomes insecure amen typically due
[1:08:30] to a change in their expected aim
[1:08:32] they meant a role in society now amen do
[1:08:35] you realize there is a pressure
[1:08:37] in the world today to become ashamed
[1:08:40] amen of who you are and your identity
[1:08:42] there there is a pressure
[1:08:43] amen i'll tell you it's not just coming
[1:08:45] from the schoolhouse

[1:08:48] government's house amen it's coming all
[1:08:50] the way from the white house
[1:08:52] amen there's a pressure that's coming
[1:08:54] down amen and it's a pressure
[1:08:56] and let me just say it like this it's
[1:08:57] the most craziest thing i've ever heard
[1:08:59] of
[1:09:00] he meant it's a pressure upon people to
[1:09:02] be identified
[1:09:03] or to be ashamed of their identification
[1:09:05] you say what do you mean well there's a
[1:09:07] pressure for a man
[1:09:08] amen to become ashamed that he's a man
[1:09:10] and there's a pressure for a woman to
[1:09:12] become ashamed
[1:09:13] amen that she is a woman we're living in
[1:09:15] a society
[1:09:16] amen where they say that we're going to
[1:09:17] do away with any type of gender
[1:09:19] identification
[1:09:20] even to the point now he meant to we're
[1:09:22] in high school they are talking about
[1:09:24] taking the word freshman
[1:09:25] he meant out of high school because it
[1:09:27] identifies he meant an entire
[1:09:29] age group as a boy let me say this world
[1:09:32] is
[1:09:33] crazy amen it's an age where there's a
[1:09:35] pressure
[1:09:36] he meant on a man to be a man and a
[1:09:38] woman to be a woman
[1:09:39] but i'll say it like this what is
[1:09:40] happening in the natural amen
[1:09:42] is also happening in the spiritual and
[1:09:44] there is a pressure coming up from the
[1:09:46] pits of hell
[1:09:47] he meant upon the church of the living
[1:09:49] god he meant to back off for being the
[1:09:51] bride
[1:09:52] he meant to be a backing off of being
[1:09:54] messiah he meant to back off of quoting
[1:09:56] a prophet

[1:09:58] message amen i'm going to preach here

[1:10:41] i'm not apologizing amen for the
[1:10:43] convictions of my heart
[1:10:44] and if that is in the natural amendment
[1:10:47] we need some people in the spiritual
[1:10:49] amen that will stand up and say i'm not

[1:11:27] happened in the natural amen is also
[1:11:29] happening in the spiritual
[1:11:31] amen you realize if a person chooses to
[1:11:33] be a democrat

[1:12:18] and of my words in this adulterous and
[1:12:20] sinful generation amen of him also
[1:12:23] amen shall the son of man be ashamed

[1:12:27] father

[1:12:32] there
[1:12:32] they've been that there's going to be a
[1:12:34] pressure amen to be ashamed
[1:12:36] of the son of man in an adulterous and
[1:12:38] sinful generation

[1:12:58] here ain't we hey amen let me tell you
[1:13:01] that pressure is not coming from a holy
[1:13:03] source it is coming from a wicked
[1:13:05] and an adulterous sinful generation amen
[1:13:08] i think it's time
[1:13:09] amen we check the source amen of the
[1:13:11] pressure that's coming upon us
[1:13:13] amen i'll tell you what if there's a
[1:13:14] pressure coming upon you amen not to be
[1:13:17] a message believer not to fulfill
[1:13:19] amen the potentials that god placed in
[1:13:21] your life that pressure is not coming
[1:13:23] from god
[1:13:24] it is coming from a wicked and an
[1:13:26] adulterous sinful generation
[1:13:28] is there anybody here say this morning
[1:13:30] i'm going to turn a deaf ear
[1:13:32] i'm gonna turn a blind eye amen to this
[1:13:34] wicked and adulterous sinful generation
[1:13:37] and realize this pressure is not coming
[1:13:39] amen from righteousness
[1:13:41] it is coming from unrighteousness now
[1:13:43] when the prophet picks up mark the
[1:13:45] eighth chapter
[1:13:46] he automatically begins to preach a
[1:13:47] message called amen ashamed one word
[1:13:50] and he calls it ashamed he said see now
[1:13:53] this word ashamed
[1:13:54] could also be translated into
[1:13:57] embarrassed
[1:13:58] amen and shamed can be translated into
[1:14:01] embarrassed
[1:14:01] he said now see you are faced with
[1:14:03] something that you're embarrassed about
[1:14:07] you are faced with something that you
[1:14:10] are embarrassed about
[1:14:11] he said being ashamed he said another
[1:14:14] thing being ashamed does
[1:14:15] amen is it shows that you are not sure
[1:14:18] of what you're talking about
[1:14:19] if you really know what you're talking
[1:14:21] about and have the assurance that you
[1:14:23] know what you're talking about
[1:14:25] then you can tell anybody and you're not
[1:14:28] ashamed
[1:14:29] he said but if you feel put out amen out
[1:14:32] of place
[1:14:32] it shows that you are if you feel put
[1:14:36] out
[1:14:36] if you feel out of place amen it shows
[1:14:38] you are now let me just say this

[1:14:43] believes

[1:14:58] in whom i have believed and am persuaded
[1:15:01] that he is able to keep that which i
[1:15:04] have committed unto him
[1:15:06] amen against that day now do you realize
[1:15:08] if you're not sure
[1:15:09] amen when you come up against the dead
[1:15:11] hook when you come up against the spirit
[1:15:13] when you come up against an evil thing
[1:15:15] amen if you're not sure of where you're
[1:15:17] standing
[1:15:18] amen then that thing will begin to
[1:15:20] pressure you amen to back off of your
[1:15:22] conviction
[1:15:22] he said remember you don't know what
[1:15:24] troubles are amen till you hit their
[1:15:26] witch doctors
[1:15:27] on every side and the devil and don't
[1:15:29] think they don't know what to do see
[1:15:31] you better know what you're talking
[1:15:33] about when you stand
[1:15:34] before them but i know in whom i have

[1:15:41] that can say i am not afraid
[1:15:43] amen of the devil amen you said with
[1:15:45] that that's pretty bold no

[1:15:48] have i am not afraid of the devil

[1:16:52] i was in new zealand one time and a girl
[1:16:54] possessed of a demon amen laying there
[1:16:56] on the floor slithering like a snake
[1:16:58] and i laid down beside her on my knee
[1:17:00] and began to pray with about five other
[1:17:01] brothers and sisters there
[1:17:03] trying to hold her down amen and i said
[1:17:05] satan in the name of jesus christ
[1:17:07] by the authority of the word amen i cast
[1:17:10] you out

[1:17:16] looked over brother samuel and there was
[1:17:18] a bible laying there

[1:17:35] of the girl
[1:17:35] amen because i was not embarrassed amen
[1:17:38] i was not ashamed
[1:17:39] of the god who sent me there and that
[1:17:42] same god
[1:17:43] amen has put a commission in the heart
[1:17:45] of the pride this morning
[1:17:46] old church of the living god quit being
[1:17:48] embarrassed to the devil
[1:17:50] and defeat the devil
[1:17:53] you ain't got to back up to no spirit
[1:17:55] amen we are not
[1:17:57] ashamed amen we have a surety this
[1:18:00] morning
[1:18:00] when brother man preaches that message
[1:18:02] is shamed amen now jeffersonville
[1:18:04] actually retitles it
[1:18:05] in the subtitle and calls it ashamed of
[1:18:08] him
[1:18:09] amen ashamed of him now watch this
[1:18:11] people will actually tell me
[1:18:13] well brother andrew i'm not ashamed of
[1:18:15] jesus christ
[1:18:16] but i am ashamed of this message
[1:18:19] and then you'll hear people say well i'm
[1:18:21] not ashamed amen to carry a bible
[1:18:23] amen but i am ashamed to talk about
[1:18:25] jesus amen but let me just say this
[1:18:27] jesus
[1:18:28] and the word are the same jesus and the
[1:18:32] word are the same
[1:18:33] he meant so to be ashamed of one is to
[1:18:36] be ashamed
[1:18:37] of the other to to be ashamed of one is
[1:18:40] to be ashamed of the other
[1:18:41] now let me just show you the continuity
[1:18:43] amen john 1 says in the beginning
[1:18:46] amen was the word and the word was with
[1:18:48] god
[1:18:49] and the word was god amen so you
[1:18:51] couldn't be ashamed of the word
[1:18:53] without being ashamed of god and you
[1:18:55] couldn't be ashamed of god
[1:18:56] without being ashamed of the word
[1:18:58] because in the beginning was the word
[1:19:00] and the word was with god and the word
[1:19:02] was god
[1:19:03] skip down to john 1 14 and the word was
[1:19:06] made flesh
[1:19:07] amen now people can say well we're not
[1:19:09] ashamed of the word but we're ashamed of
[1:19:11] this man called jesus
[1:19:12] amen but to say you was ashamed of the
[1:19:14] man called jesus was the same as saying
[1:19:17] he was ashamed of the word he meant
[1:19:19] because the message
[1:19:20] and the messenger are one amend the word
[1:19:24] and the bringer of the word becomes one
[1:19:26] we find out when a man comes sent from
[1:19:28] god
[1:19:28] amen ordained of god with the truth thus
[1:19:31] saith the lord
[1:19:32] the message and the messenger are one
[1:19:35] and the same
[1:19:36] amen see a denominational man under a
[1:19:38] denominational auspices
[1:19:40] he and the church is the one a
[1:19:43] theologian under theology
[1:19:45] amen made by the nomination the church
[1:19:47] of theology
[1:19:48] and the theologian are one he said then
[1:19:50] when a man
[1:19:51] comes with us saith the lord
[1:19:55] he and the message is one
[1:19:59] amen notice when elijah come with
[1:20:01] fossett the lord
[1:20:02] he and his message became one just as
[1:20:05] jesus when he come
[1:20:06] he was the word amen jesus was the word
[1:20:10] amen of john 1 1 jesus was the word
[1:20:14] amen notice this so the word of god and
[1:20:17] the messenger
[1:20:18] of the age amen was the self same thing
[1:20:21] all the time and the prophet said that's
[1:20:24] right
[1:20:25] he meant jesus was the word and the word
[1:20:28] was jesus
[1:20:29] and they were the self same thing all
[1:20:31] the time
[1:20:32] see then the word was prophesied and
[1:20:35] jesus was the fulfillment
[1:20:37] of the prophesied word he was the he was
[1:20:40] the one
[1:20:40] that the prophet said would happen amen
[1:20:43] a virgin shall conceive
[1:20:44] and bear a child that was all the way
[1:20:46] back in the beginning when god said
[1:20:48] amen the woman's seed shall bruise the
[1:20:50] serpent and he'll bruise her heal
[1:20:52] amen all these prophecies had been given
[1:20:55] amen from david cried
[1:20:57] he meant in the rest on down he said he
[1:21:00] was that word
[1:21:01] manifested now do you realize there were
[1:21:03] people on that day
[1:21:04] that were not ashamed amen to teach the
[1:21:06] prophecies
[1:21:07] they were not ashamed amen to read what
[1:21:10] isaiah said
[1:21:11] and what genesis 3 said and what
[1:21:13] zacharias they were not ashamed
[1:21:15] he meant of the prophecy but when the
[1:21:17] fulfillment come
[1:21:18] they was ashamed of the fulfillment amen
[1:21:21] let me say this
[1:21:22] you cannot be ashamed of the fulfillment
[1:21:25] and be proud to be identified with the
[1:21:27] prophecy
[1:21:28] amen the prophecy and the fulfillment
[1:21:30] are the self
[1:21:31] same thing oh when god gives a word of
[1:21:34] promise
[1:21:35] amen he fulfills it see when god give
[1:21:38] the word of promise concerning jesus
[1:21:40] amen he fulfilled his own word of
[1:21:43] promise
[1:21:43] in romans 9 verse 9 the bible says this
[1:21:46] is
[1:21:46] amen the word of promise at the time
[1:21:49] will i come
[1:21:50] amen and sarah shall have a son amen do
[1:21:53] you realize
[1:21:54] sarah had been battled the thought of
[1:21:55] being embarrassed amen she battled the
[1:21:58] fault
[1:21:58] amen of being ashamed of the word of
[1:22:00] prophecy
[1:22:01] how can you say that preacher amen
[1:22:03] because she she told abraham
[1:22:05] you go have the child by hagar amen i'm
[1:22:08] old and you're old
[1:22:09] and there's no life left in my womb
[1:22:11] there's no milk left in my veins
[1:22:13] he meant she was ashamed amen but when
[1:22:15] god said the word of promise
[1:22:17] amen would come through sarah amen there
[1:22:19] was nobody else could take her place
[1:22:21] there was nobody else that could fulfill
[1:22:23] her old church of the living god this
[1:22:25] morning
[1:22:26] don't you see amen you are a part of the
[1:22:29] word of prophecy
[1:22:30] you are a part of the word of promise
[1:22:33] and nobody can take your place
[1:22:36] the same way it is with the virgin mary
[1:22:39] the word of promise came
[1:22:40] amen to the virgin mary but that word of
[1:22:43] promise
[1:22:44] was he himself to be made manifest
[1:22:47] amen god was made manifest he himself
[1:22:50] amen acted at that time and fulfilled
[1:22:55] his own word of promise in the virgin
[1:22:58] it was an angel that it brought her the
[1:23:01] message but the angel's message was
[1:23:04] the word of god isaiah 9 6 he fulfilled
[1:23:07] at the time all that was written of him
[1:23:10] because she
[1:23:12] accepted his word amen to her she was
[1:23:15] not
[1:23:15] ashamed he meant of the word that the
[1:23:18] angel brought
[1:23:19] as a matter of fact the angel's message
[1:23:21] brought a boldness to mary
[1:23:22] he meant to go home and say joseph amen
[1:23:25] i met an angel
[1:23:27] amen and the prophet said the same angel
[1:23:29] that came to mary
[1:23:30] was the same angel that came to joseph
[1:23:32] in a dream
[1:23:33] amen and released to him amen the power
[1:23:36] to believe
[1:23:37] amen that all things are working
[1:23:39] according to the prophetic cogs of the
[1:23:40] almighty god
[1:23:41] oh church amen the same angel amen that
[1:23:45] meant william branham in a cave
[1:23:46] is the same angel of the lord that is in
[1:23:49] this building this morning
[1:23:50] amen i can't make this message real to
[1:23:52] you a preacher can't make it real to you
[1:23:55] ain't been but the angel of the lord can
[1:23:57] take this message
[1:23:59] amen and make it so real to your heart
[1:24:01] that it will drive back every spirit
[1:24:03] it'll drive back every fear it'll drive
[1:24:05] back every nervousness
[1:24:07] it'll drive back everything that the
[1:24:09] devil is plaguing your mind with
[1:24:11] when it comes to believing what you
[1:24:12] believe and standing on what you are
[1:24:17] now i hope this is okay this morning
[1:24:19] amen the word of promise cannot fail
[1:24:21] amen think about that the word of
[1:24:23] promise amen cannot fail
[1:24:25] jesus was tempted and how can overcome
[1:24:27] above any man
[1:24:29] that had ever been tempted in the
[1:24:30] wilderness for 40 days but
[1:24:32] how did he overcome amen by the word
[1:24:36] amen what is the word of promise to
[1:24:38] every christian
[1:24:39] here it is greater is he that is in you
[1:24:43] then he that's in the world the word of
[1:24:47] promise to every believer
[1:24:49] is greater is he that is in you
[1:24:53] than he that is in the world amen then
[1:24:55] how do i overcome
[1:24:56] not me but the word that's in me and the
[1:24:59] word is god
[1:25:00] then i overcome the things of the world
[1:25:03] because it's the word in me
[1:25:04] and if you abide in me and my words in
[1:25:07] you then just
[1:25:08] ask what you will he said just keep
[1:25:10] pressing up
[1:25:11] amen you're coming to the top as sure as
[1:25:14] anything
[1:25:14] amen you've got to come to the top now
[1:25:17] think about this just keep pressing
[1:25:19] amen just keep coming up he meant
[1:25:22] pressing based on what
[1:25:23] but we're pressing based upon the word
[1:25:26] of promise
[1:25:27] now watch this the prophet said the
[1:25:28] woman with the issue of blood
[1:25:30] amen she didn't even have a promise amen
[1:25:32] but she had faith
[1:25:33] amen see amen notice this try to
[1:25:35] consider what the word means
[1:25:37] amen faith is by the hearing the word
[1:25:40] and the word of promise if you don't
[1:25:43] have a promise
[1:25:44] then you venture out upon your own faith
[1:25:46] but if you can take a promise of god
[1:25:48] then that's god's promise to you the
[1:25:51] woman that touched the aim of his
[1:25:52] garment
[1:25:53] had no promise of that but her faith
[1:25:55] amen without a promise
[1:25:57] got her healing amen her faith without a
[1:26:00] promise got her healing
[1:26:01] then how much more are we to get our
[1:26:04] healing
[1:26:05] by faith in the promise that god is
[1:26:08] manifesting and vindicating before us
[1:26:12] and has brought it to us by his word and
[1:26:14] has come around
[1:26:16] and has confirmed it himself amen see
[1:26:19] that if he
[1:26:20] would come in the midst of the church
[1:26:22] and do what his word
[1:26:23] said he would do that he would heal the
[1:26:25] sick he would reveal the secrets of the
[1:26:27] heart
[1:26:28] he would discern the spirits he would
[1:26:30] have known he'd been the unknown things
[1:26:32] he would make him known
[1:26:33] amen he would break out amen of the
[1:26:35] visible realm into the visible realm
[1:26:37] he meant by the power of the word of god
[1:26:40] amen then is there anybody here that
[1:26:42] would say god
[1:26:43] if you manifest your word you've
[1:26:45] indicated your word
[1:26:46] you've confirmed your word i am not
[1:26:48] ashamed to be identified
[1:26:51] with the living reality of the presence
[1:26:53] of god
[1:26:54] in the church
[1:26:57] of the living god listen friends i am
[1:27:00] not identified
[1:27:01] to be associated with the revealing of
[1:27:04] the son of man
[1:27:05] amen when i hear a prophet on tape begin
[1:27:07] to discern
[1:27:08] i'm not ashamed amen i'm not embarrassed
[1:27:11] amen i'm not blessing
[1:27:12] amen i know of a surety that that vision
[1:27:16] or that discernment is not going to fail
[1:27:18] amen because it's not a man on the scene
[1:27:21] it's the son of man they've been
[1:27:23] fulfilling
[1:27:24] his promised word amen then what is
[1:27:26] christ amen christ is the word
[1:27:29] and christ is revealed or made manifest
[1:27:32] in his own word now the prophet said
[1:27:35] it's just written word
[1:27:36] to us it's a reality it isn't just
[1:27:38] written word to us it's a reality
[1:27:40] amen we are in him now i love this
[1:27:44] and we are enjoying it amen amen now we
[1:27:47] behold him
[1:27:48] and we see him the word manifesting
[1:27:51] itself

[1:29:01] that'll say father i'm not ashamed to be
[1:29:04] identified
[1:29:05] with the revealing of your presence in
[1:29:08] the age in which i'm living in
[1:29:10] amen do you realize in luke chapter 4
[1:29:12] amen that jesus was the word of promise
[1:29:14] amen but he became then the word of
[1:29:16] promise fulfilled
[1:29:17] and the prophet picks this up and says
[1:29:19] notice the messiah
[1:29:21] standing in the platform to identify
[1:29:24] himself
[1:29:25] with the word of promise for that age
[1:29:27] and there were people there
[1:29:29] that was embarrassed by his actions amen
[1:29:32] there were people there brother brian
[1:29:33] that was embarrassed when jesus picked
[1:29:35] up the scroll of isaiah
[1:29:37] there was people there that was
[1:29:38] embarrassed when he said behold
[1:29:40] amen this is written of me they was
[1:29:43] embarrassed when he read
[1:29:44] they was embarrassed when he spoke he
[1:29:46] meant furthermore when he closed the
[1:29:48] scroll handed it to the priest
[1:29:50] walked over and sat down in the
[1:29:52] messiah's chair
[1:29:53] they were really embarrassed then amen
[1:29:55] but you know what jesus was not in paris
[1:29:58] they meant jesus was not blushing they
[1:30:00] meant jesus was not nervous
[1:30:01] jesus was not unsure brother samuel when
[1:30:04] he read isaiah 60.
[1:30:06] there wasn't one bone in his body there
[1:30:08] wasn't one nerve

[1:30:26] said about it
[1:30:27] and with confidence brother boaz he
[1:30:29] could read the scroll
[1:30:30] he could say the word he could close the
[1:30:32] scroll he could sit down in the chair
[1:30:35] and when he stood there and cried this
[1:30:36] day this scripture

[1:30:41] it with a question mark
[1:30:42] he said it with an exclamation amen
[1:30:44] because the word
[1:30:46] that had been veiled through the eyes of
[1:30:48] tradition
[1:30:49] and prophecies have now been fulfilled
[1:30:53] i'm about to bust her i'm not to preach

[1:31:04] nervousness in them

[1:31:28] was called messiah's chair
[1:31:30] it had been sitting there for years
[1:31:32] because they knew messiah would come
[1:31:34] and someday messiah would fulfill his
[1:31:36] chair
[1:31:37] someday messiah would take his position
[1:31:40] he meant everybody that got near there
[1:31:42] amen they put a pressure upon them you
[1:31:44] better not sit in that chair
[1:31:45] you better not claim that position you
[1:31:48] better not preach that open word
[1:31:49] you better not declare the seventh seal
[1:31:51] amen that's not for you
[1:31:53] amen but when jesus come in there he was
[1:31:56] not a
[1:31:56] hybrid he was not a coward he was not a
[1:31:59] blessed prophet
[1:32:00] he was not the blessing word he was the
[1:32:02] word
[1:32:03] amen of promise with power
[1:32:05] [Applause]
[1:32:08] what are you saying i'm saying when you
[1:32:10] know who you are
[1:32:11] there ain't enough demons of
[1:32:12] intimidation amen to back you off
[1:32:15] of fulfilling what god has called you to
[1:32:18] do
[1:32:20] well let's just preach here this morning
[1:32:22] when you know who you are
[1:32:23] there ain't enough demon powers out of
[1:32:25] hell to make you
[1:32:27] second guess your position to make you
[1:32:29] feel embarrassed
[1:32:30] amen to worship god oh oh
[1:32:34] glory to god you know when you want to
[1:32:35] raise your hand so bad
[1:32:37] but you feel an old devil pressing you
[1:32:38] you know what that devil's doing
[1:32:40] he's trying to stop you he meant from
[1:32:42] fulfilling he'd been the position god
[1:32:44] saw you in
[1:32:45] from before the foundation of the world
[1:32:48] and that same old devil
[1:32:49] if he would have had his way he wouldn't
[1:32:51] let jesus sit in that chair
[1:32:53] amen but there was not enough devil's
[1:32:54] brother that could stop jesus
[1:32:56] and there's not enough devils that can
[1:32:58] stop the bride today when she recognizes
[1:33:01] he meant the word is eagle food and she
[1:33:04] hears from her theophany
[1:33:05] and it releases her from the prison bars
[1:33:08] of man's interpretation
[1:33:10] to step into the fulfillment of the
[1:33:12] vision
[1:33:13] oh come on eddie biscuit put the
[1:33:15] checkered shirt on
[1:33:16] amen come on preacher amen preach the
[1:33:19] message
[1:33:20] come on brother branham stand there and
[1:33:22] declare the word is revealed
[1:33:24] it's been announced in the heavens it's
[1:33:26] been announced upon the earth
[1:33:28] it has made manifest
[1:33:31] [Applause]
[1:33:34] ah god i'm about to put another door in
[1:33:36] this church where do you want it
[1:33:37] are you all hearing me it's time to play
[1:33:40] the part
[1:33:40] you've been sitting on the sidelines
[1:33:42] long enough
[1:33:45] you've been backing up and blessing and
[1:33:48] cowering around like
[1:33:49] oh god it's time to step in your
[1:33:52] position
[1:33:53] the curtains the curtain call has been
[1:33:57] given
[1:33:57] amen unveil what has been failed unseal
[1:34:01] what has been sealed
[1:34:02] release
[1:34:07] what has been bound hey i am not ashamed
[1:34:12] to be identified with the perfect
[1:34:15] interpretation
[1:34:16] of the word jesus would have never sat
[1:34:19] in the messiah's chair on private
[1:34:21] interpretation
[1:34:25] there would have been a question should
[1:34:27] i sit or should i not
[1:34:32] well let's just preach a minute there
[1:34:35] would have been a reserve there
[1:34:37] should i go or should i not but the
[1:34:40] identification of god
[1:34:42] is the word then everything that jesus
[1:34:45] did
[1:34:46] in the temple that day he could identify
[1:34:48] it
[1:34:49] by the word oh god brother samuel he
[1:34:53] didn't do one thing
[1:34:54] that was not in the word because he was
[1:34:58] the word
[1:34:59] [Applause]
[1:35:01] the word and jesus were the self
[1:35:04] same thing jesus could not do one thing
[1:35:07] different
[1:35:07] than what was in the word and be the
[1:35:09] fulfillment of the prophet's word
[1:35:11] but because he was the word he meant he
[1:35:13] was bound to that word
[1:35:15] amen therefore the description he did
[1:35:17] was what the word
[1:35:18] said he would do my the identification
[1:35:22] of god is the word then what does
[1:35:24] identification mean
[1:35:25] well the word identification means the
[1:35:27] action amen or the process
[1:35:29] of identifying someone or something are
[1:35:32] you ready for this
[1:35:33] amen the fact of being identified
[1:35:36] let's say that together the fact of
[1:35:39] being identified
[1:35:40] see that identification is not an
[1:35:43] opinion
[1:35:44] there's got to be a fact there's got to
[1:35:46] be a boldness there
[1:35:47] there's got to be a courage there amen
[1:35:49] to say this is the way it is
[1:35:51] amen see identification then is based
[1:35:54] upon facts
[1:35:55] and not opinions it was not an opinion
[1:35:58] that jesus was the messiah
[1:36:00] it was not an opinion that that was the
[1:36:02] scripture
[1:36:03] pertaining to him it was not an opinion
[1:36:06] that he should sit in that chair
[1:36:08] it was a word fact
[1:36:12] well let's just preach it for a minute
[1:36:13] then that tells me that it is not an
[1:36:15] opinion
[1:36:16] that i am the bride of jesus christ it
[1:36:18] is not an opinion
[1:36:20] that a prophet said you believe for your
[1:36:21] house and thy and my house shall be
[1:36:24] saved
[1:36:24] it is not an opinion amen that your sins
[1:36:27] are in the sea of forgetfulness it's not
[1:36:30] an opinion
[1:36:31] when jesus said if you abide in me and
[1:36:33] my word abide in you
[1:36:34] ask what she will that's not an opinion
[1:36:37] even that
[1:36:38] is a fact
[1:36:41] it's a fact this morning amen
[1:36:43] denomination
[1:36:44] amen it's not christianity amen
[1:36:47] christianity
[1:36:48] is not denomination amen denomination
[1:36:51] changed amen the identity of
[1:36:53] christianity
[1:36:55] do you realize that they meant
[1:36:57] denomination changed
[1:36:59] the identity of christianity the prophet
[1:37:01] said it's very much a popular thing
[1:37:03] today
[1:37:04] to say i am a christian see but do you
[1:37:06] believe the word of god
[1:37:07] where it said these signs shall follow
[1:37:09] them that believe
[1:37:10] he said oh even ministers faces will
[1:37:13] bless see
[1:37:14] are you ashamed of saved divine healing
[1:37:17] are you ashamed of the full gospel are
[1:37:20] you ashamed
[1:37:21] of your pentecostal experience he said
[1:37:24] that
[1:37:25] is the word being made flesh in you
[1:37:29] god help me church amen are you ashamed
[1:37:32] of divine healing
[1:37:33] are you ashamed of the full gospel are
[1:37:35] you ashamed
[1:37:36] of your pentecostal experience a prophet
[1:37:39] said that
[1:37:40] is the word made flesh in you see then
[1:37:43] what the word made flesh is
[1:37:45] is the light of the age when you see it
[1:37:48] that's why i probably would say we thank
[1:37:51] the o god
[1:37:52] to be the light bearers of this age to
[1:37:54] be ready to manifest
[1:37:56] even somebody say ready to be ready to
[1:38:00] manifest
[1:38:01] amen the promised word for the age that
[1:38:03] we're now living in
[1:38:04] we believe that the holy spirit is here
[1:38:07] on earth now
[1:38:09] trying to find hearts to manifest
[1:38:12] and to bring to pass by vindicating the
[1:38:15] word
[1:38:15] that he's now prophesied for this day
[1:38:18] and this
[1:38:19] hour see that when god gives a word that
[1:38:22] word has to live
[1:38:23] itself out for every generation the word
[1:38:25] lived itself out in the days of moses
[1:38:27] it lived itself out in hebrews 1. he
[1:38:30] said but the church
[1:38:31] got it so twisted up those prophets
[1:38:35] those daring messengers of god they come
[1:38:38] without any church
[1:38:39] without denomination without
[1:38:41] organization without anything
[1:38:43] and they defied kings kingdoms
[1:38:46] churches and everything they was brought
[1:38:49] before the priest
[1:38:50] they wasn't ashamed because they had
[1:38:52] directly
[1:38:54] thus saith the lord when they were
[1:38:57] brought before priests
[1:38:58] they were not embarrassed they had thus
[1:39:00] saith the lord he said if you notice the
[1:39:02] prophet
[1:39:03] in one sense of the word in the old
[1:39:04] testament when he said thus saith the
[1:39:06] lord now watch him
[1:39:08] he goes right into the phrase of taking
[1:39:10] the place of god
[1:39:12] you notice when he placed out before him
[1:39:14] thus saith the lord
[1:39:15] he fell right into god
[1:39:18] oh mercy and he acted as god then he
[1:39:22] gave his message
[1:39:23] which was god speaking through him thus
[1:39:27] saith the lord amen then there was a
[1:39:30] power
[1:39:30] behind the word of thus saith the lord
[1:39:34] because it was not the seth william
[1:39:35] branham or thus says samuel browning
[1:39:38] it was thus saith the lord which means
[1:39:41] the lord
[1:39:42] has said thus all them prophets of old
[1:39:45] of the old brought that message and you
[1:39:47] know what it did brother
[1:39:48] it embarrassed the kings amen it
[1:39:50] embarrassed them
[1:39:51] it embarrassed them philosophers it
[1:39:53] bears them pharisees
[1:39:55] amen it made the people feel
[1:39:56] uncomfortable and the prophet said the
[1:39:58] people
[1:39:59] even they would feel uncomfortable
[1:40:01] because they were supposed to be leaders
[1:40:03] and religious men and and when when the
[1:40:06] word came forth in that manner
[1:40:08] it exposed them and they felt ashamed or
[1:40:11] embarrassed
[1:40:12] but that tells us how that preachers
[1:40:13] amen will hear the tapes
[1:40:15] and they will sit in their studies he
[1:40:17] said you will hear these things
[1:40:19] but because of the nomination you will
[1:40:21] be embarrassed
[1:40:22] to go to your pulpit and preach it amen
[1:40:24] i'll say this god sent malachi
[1:40:26] 4 and this message they meant to
[1:40:28] embarrass
[1:40:29] and make every denominational feel
[1:40:31] uncomfortable amen on their teaching
[1:40:34] of what christianity is
[1:40:37] are you all with me this morning they
[1:40:39] meant to embarrass
[1:40:40] the false teachings of what they said
[1:40:43] christian identification was
[1:40:44] remember it says it like this he said
[1:40:46] many times you say i'm a christian
[1:40:48] have you received the holy ghost since
[1:40:49] you believed they say well they're
[1:40:51] embarrassed about that
[1:40:52] he said and many times christians back
[1:40:54] up when it comes to shouting
[1:40:56] and divine healing he said they back up
[1:40:59] they want to announce
[1:41:00] they got a denomination they won't
[1:41:02] announce that because they're not
[1:41:03] ashamed of it
[1:41:04] he said but when it comes to being a
[1:41:06] christian that can take god's word just
[1:41:08] the way it is
[1:41:09] then they are ashamed he said now that's
[1:41:12] just recently
[1:41:13] amen come into that
[1:41:17] watch this in the days of luther to
[1:41:20] recognize luther
[1:41:21] as a father luther while it almost meant
[1:41:23] death by catholic church
[1:41:24] days of wesley to know you had defied
[1:41:26] the england church was almost penalty of
[1:41:28] death by the angles
[1:41:29] to announce you were a methodist in the
[1:41:31] days of pentecost it was a shame
[1:41:33] because you was quickly counted a holy
[1:41:35] roller or some tongue speaker
[1:41:37] now they organized and went right in
[1:41:39] with the rest of the group
[1:41:40] now watch this when malachi 4 comes he
[1:41:43] is going to restore
[1:41:45] amen true christian identity he is going
[1:41:48] to say
[1:41:48] they have changed the identity of
[1:41:50] christianity to where you say am i a
[1:41:52] christian
[1:41:52] i'm a baptist i'm a methodist i'm a
[1:41:55] lutheran i'm a pentecostal
[1:41:56] he said but that wasn't so at the
[1:42:00] beginning now watch this
[1:42:01] he said now here's the identification
[1:42:03] amen wherefore i give you to understand
[1:42:05] that no man speaking by the spirit of
[1:42:08] god amen calleth jesus a curse
[1:42:10] and that no man can say that jesus is
[1:42:13] the lord
[1:42:14] but by the holy ghost see then the holy
[1:42:18] ghost
[1:42:18] is the identity of christianity
[1:42:24] the holy ghost is the identity
[1:42:27] of christianity beth methodist
[1:42:30] is not the identity amen baptist is not
[1:42:34] the identity
[1:42:35] pentecostal is not the identity the holy
[1:42:38] ghost
[1:42:38] is the identity of christianity do you
[1:42:41] realize
[1:42:42] intellectuals is not your identity
[1:42:45] well come on church let's preach amen
[1:42:47] intellectuals
[1:42:48] is not your identity your intellectual
[1:42:51] conception
[1:42:52] of this message will not release a power
[1:42:54] in you
[1:42:55] to fulfill the word that god called you
[1:42:58] to fulfill
[1:43:01] well brother andrew i just need the
[1:43:02] intellectuals well let me tell you what
[1:43:04] about moses

[1:43:28] around the burning bush and when he got
[1:43:30] to the burning bush the burning bush

[1:49:24] a kid i never forget it he said people
[1:49:26] go to message churches he said they go
[1:49:28] in with a long face and they come out
[1:49:29] with a longer one
[1:49:32] he said they come out and they go to the
[1:49:33] restaurant and they look at somebody and
[1:49:35] say
[1:49:35] don't you want what i got
[1:49:39] he said no if it makes me look like that
[1:49:41] and act like that i don't want no part
[1:49:42] in it

[1:49:46] don't want no theology
[1:49:47] that takes my dance away i know you
[1:49:50] think i'm pentecostal but that's all
[1:49:51] right

[1:49:53] a little bit hey if you're gonna call me
[1:49:55] pentecostal i'm gonna give you something

[1:50:18] got it on
[1:50:21] now whatever moses god the prophet said
[1:50:24] it was a supernatural experience
[1:50:26] he said now watch this moses stood on
[1:50:28] the back side of the desert somewhere
[1:50:30] where he met god himself
[1:50:35] now we preach that before a man preaches
[1:50:37] in a pulpit
[1:50:38] he needs to meet the pillar of fire
[1:50:42] on the backside of the desert then what
[1:50:44] good does it do
[1:50:46] for a preacher to meet the pillar of
[1:50:48] fire when the church ain't met
[1:50:58] call himself a preacher until they stood
[1:50:59] on their sacred sands and and fellowship
[1:51:01] one-on-one with a pillar of fire
[1:51:02] amen in all the world burn out then what
[1:51:04] about the pews

[1:51:14] well preach that we are y'all hearing me
[1:51:16] hey man if this man come in here
[1:51:18] and begin to preach like some people
[1:51:19] worship it wouldn't be no time you'd
[1:51:21] have him in a deacon's meeting
[1:51:26] come on if he come in this pulpit and
[1:51:28] just half-heartedly put some scriptures
[1:51:30] in close together
[1:51:31] you'd be all wadded up and tore up and
[1:51:33] blowed up well i want a deacon's meeting
[1:51:35] and i want to know what's occupying
[1:51:36] brother samuel's time he ain't preaching
[1:51:38] like he used to
[1:51:39] he ain't laboring like he used to amen
[1:51:41] there must be sin in his life
[1:51:43] everybody oh well can i ask you
[1:51:44] something amen why aren't you raising
[1:51:46] your hands like you used to why don't
[1:51:48] you shout like you used to
[1:51:49] why aren't you running the aisles like
[1:51:51] you used to why aren't you giving it all
[1:51:53] you have
[1:51:53] i'll tell you why you're not doing it
[1:51:55] it's because you let some intellectual
[1:51:57] spirit
[1:51:57] of formalism get on you and you lost
[1:52:00] your liberty
[1:52:01] but i declare today is the day with
[1:52:03] liberty
[1:52:04] is restored to the children of god with
[1:52:07] a passion
[1:52:08] with a zeal with a fire with an
[1:52:11] anointing that says
[1:52:12] ain't no devil blessing in me ain't no
[1:52:15] devil turning me
[1:52:16] around i'm going through

[1:59:01] and he met all 1150 million
[1:59:05] positive and convinced atheists and
[1:59:07] agnostics in the world
[1:59:09] when it was all said and done and the
[1:59:11] dust had settled brother doug
[1:59:13] they still would not had enough to make
[1:59:16] moses
[1:59:16] ashamed of who he was
[1:59:23] what are you saying i'm saying moses
[1:59:25] could a man of 1150
[1:59:27] and they all stopped him and they
[1:59:29] started one by one by one
[1:59:31] and moses one atheist by another he
[1:59:34] wouldn't have got weaker
[1:59:35] he had it got stronger
[1:59:39] by the time he got on the other side of
[1:59:41] the atheist and the agnostics he would
[1:59:44] have still believed
[1:59:45] that whatever was in that fire is in my
[1:59:48] soul
[1:59:48] and i am the one to go down to pharaoh
[1:59:51] and say let my people go
[1:59:55] oh brother sister this morning is there
[1:59:57] something in your soul

[2:00:14] you know what amazes me in that
[2:00:15] sociologist report you know what they
[2:00:17] reported
[2:00:18] they reported two words that the prophet
[2:00:19] talked about
[2:00:24] positive and convinced
[2:00:27] that's good thank you positive and
[2:00:30] convinced
[2:00:31] 450 to 500 million
[2:00:35] positive atheists 200 million
[2:00:38] convinced y'all know where i'm going
[2:00:41] with this
[2:00:41] brother braham said what is an absolute
[2:00:43] it is an assurance it is a positive
[2:00:48] well moses was sure and positive of the
[2:00:51] god he met
[2:00:53] and he was convinced that what he meant
[2:00:56] was more than a bush
[2:00:57] but there was a god in that bush well i
[2:00:59] say this morning church
[2:01:01] i am positive that as a nine-year-old
[2:01:03] boy i meant more than an altar call
[2:01:07] as a nine-year-old boy i meant more than
[2:01:09] just a preacher
[2:01:10] i met the same pillar of fire
[2:01:13] [Applause]
[2:01:15] oh and i heard a prophet say when you
[2:01:18] met him
[2:01:18] there is nobody that can talk you out of
[2:01:21] him
[2:01:22] if you don't know him this morning
[2:01:24] there's somebody i'll talk you out this
[2:01:26] message
[2:01:27] if you don't know the god of this
[2:01:28] message amen some preacher
[2:01:30] will talk you out of it amen but if you
[2:01:32] know
[2:01:35] that you know it don't matter how gifted
[2:01:38] it don't matter how anointed
[2:01:39] it don't matter how supernatural it
[2:01:41] appears to be
[2:01:42] there will be a lie detector in your
[2:01:45] soul that will say that's not the god of
[2:01:47] the bible
[2:01:50] now now let me just say this amen i know
[2:01:53] some of you think right now
[2:01:54] amen that moses got a little carried
[2:01:56] away amen but my prophet said we're in
[2:01:58] the calling out
[2:02:01] when the calling out time comes when it
[2:02:04] comes to time
[2:02:05] you'll have to come out and stand for
[2:02:07] the word and say i don't belong to any
[2:02:09] of it
[2:02:10] why would he be ashamed of you because
[2:02:12] you're claiming to be
[2:02:13] he is child when you won't follow him
[2:02:16] and that's the way it is
[2:02:18] with so-called christianity
[2:02:21] are you ready for this if you name it a
[2:02:24] name of the nomination
[2:02:25] they accept the fatherhood of the
[2:02:27] denomination
[2:02:28] but when it comes to accepting the
[2:02:30] fatherhood of the word of god christ
[2:02:32] know they're embarrassed
[2:02:33] but can i tell you what my elder brother
[2:02:35] paul said
[2:02:38] can i can i tell you what my elder
[2:02:40] brother paul said
[2:02:41] here's what he said this i confess
[2:03:08] paul wasn't an embarrassed coward
[2:03:11] paul walked right out there and he
[2:03:13] looked right in their faces
[2:03:15] and he said the way that is called
[2:03:17] heresy
[2:03:18] i confess unto you that's the way i
[2:03:21] worship the god
[2:03:22] of our fathers you know what the word
[2:03:25] heresy means

[2:03:30] and it means idiotic
[2:03:36] crazy and idiotic now i know some people
[2:03:39] sit there and they say well that that
[2:03:40] preacher's crazy that preacher's heresy
[2:03:43] that preacher is idiotic
[2:03:44] and paul said to king agrippa i'm not
[2:03:46] mad
[2:03:47] amen amen king agrippa tried to
[2:03:49] embarrass paul paul was out there
[2:03:51] dancing and rejoicing
[2:03:53] i believe he was waving a white flag a
[2:03:54] victory he was having a good time
[2:03:56] and old king agrippa come out there and
[2:03:58] said paul the way that you're worshiping
[2:04:01] is a way of heresy
[2:04:02] you're a madman paul said i'm not mad
[2:04:05] i'm the happiest i've ever been
[2:04:09] i'm not crazy you just think i am
[2:04:12] and you know why some of you quit
[2:04:14] worshiping it's cause somebody thought
[2:04:15] you was a crazy worshiper
[2:04:17] somebody thought you was a heretic
[2:04:19] somebody thought you was a fanatic
[2:04:21] amen is there anybody here that would

[2:07:55] isaac and jacob and william branham
[2:07:58] and paul i'm not against teaching not
[2:08:00] against
[2:08:01] presentation but i am against releasing
[2:08:03] an anointing upon the young people to
[2:08:05] believe
[2:08:05] that this message is a bunch of head
[2:08:07] knowledge and a bunch of psychology

[2:12:25] i sit back in the office and i heard
[2:12:27] that holy rolling song leader up here
[2:12:29] that pentecostal guy up here i thought

[2:15:52] and he said about that time
[2:15:54] [Music]

[2:16:03] out there with them
[2:16:07] if you had the victory they had
[2:16:11] you would be out there with them and the
[2:16:13] prophet said

[2:53:29] done here
[2:53:30] you know the reality what the word does
[2:53:33] for sons and daughters of god it doesn't
[2:53:36] the experience
[2:53:37] is not a church experience but it's a
[2:53:41] living experience that goes out those
[2:53:44] doors
[2:53:44] and wherever you go it's reflected in
[2:53:47] your life
[2:53:49] you can walk right in the middle of the
[2:53:50] grocery store you can walk
[2:53:52] right into your class you can walk right
[2:53:55] into the kitchen
[2:53:56] and you can have real joy in your life
[2:54:00] and when situations come that want to
[2:54:02] try to
[2:54:03] dampen that joy that's a time right
[2:54:05] there
[2:54:06] to just go ahead and praise the lord
[2:54:10] it's a time you know the scripture says
[2:54:12] it's a sacrifice of praise
[2:54:15] it's not too hard to praise god when you
[2:54:18] feel like it
[2:54:20] but when it's the times that you don't
[2:54:22] feel like it
[2:54:24] well i don't feel too anointed but
[2:54:26] that's a time to reach out because
[2:54:28] he's worthy it's because of what he's
[2:54:32] done
[2:54:33] and you know what i'm talking about you
[2:54:34] press just a little bit beyond that
[2:54:36] that's what happened right here this
[2:54:37] morning
[2:54:38] it was the word that spoke to your heart
[2:54:41] and drew you
[2:54:42] to just let you see that no matter what
[2:54:44] it is that could bump against you
[2:54:46] if you just press beyond that amen there
[2:54:50] is a strength and a power within you
[2:54:52] just like it is within that airplane to
[2:54:54] break the sound barrier
[2:54:56] you're built to break the sound barrier
[2:54:59] amen you're built as a son and daughter
[2:55:02] of god
[2:55:02] amen oh i just love him don't you i just
[2:55:06] appreciate what he's done for us in this
[2:55:08] in these services
[2:55:09] amen you know you think about it in
[2:55:11] services that we have the very first
[2:55:13] thing that moses asked when he went in
[2:55:15] there he was instructed
[2:55:17] by god to ask pharaoh he said i want you
[2:55:19] to tell him i want the people to go on a
[2:55:21] three-day
[2:55:23] journey and go sacrifice
[2:55:26] of course pharaoh wouldn't let it go but
[2:55:27] there's a time there's special moments
[2:55:30] that we have like this special times of
[2:55:32] a real renewing
[2:55:33] a re-dedicating a reconsecrating and a
[2:55:36] time where god just comes down and
[2:55:38] does a real deep work and a deeper work
[2:55:40] and he moves right among us in a special
