[36:02] to tell you that he says
[36:09] [Music]
[36:12] he's coming back for

[36:53] word
[36:59] [Music]
[37:11] oh
[37:40] i like the snow myself you know that
[37:44] but we're getting more daylight in the
[37:45] evening
[37:47] brother samuel i don't like the snow hey
[37:49] i'm a bible man
[37:52] though thy sins be as scarlet they shall
[37:54] be
[37:55] white as snow
[37:59] so every time we look out and see the
[38:01] snow oh it's only you see the rainbow we
[38:04] had a rainbow it was a friday was it
[38:07] friday at the how friday at the house we
[38:09] look out and we're just standing looking
[38:10] at the rainbow that's
[38:12] god made a sign that was a covenant
[38:15] so the you know the snow was not made
[38:17] for weather forecasters
[38:19] you know snow wasn't made so that the
[38:21] body shop guys can get work it all has
[38:23] its own purpose and things
[38:25] but
[38:26] it's a reminder when you look at that
[38:28] snow though thy sins be a scarlet they
[38:31] shall be a whitest nose
[38:34] so maybe the next time when we're
[38:35] shoveling the snow or blowing it we'll
[38:37] just say thank you lord jesus for
[38:39] washing away my sins

[41:21] pray father
[41:22] may you just lord have your way now
[41:25] in jesus precious name
[41:27] amen amen
[41:29] let's turn in our bibles if you would
[41:33] ephesians chapter one
[41:37] i have
[41:39] a few scriptures to read through here
[41:42] ephesians one
[42:01] verse 3 is where i'd like to begin
[42:06] blessed be the god and father
[42:08] of our lord jesus christ
[42:11] who hath blessed us
[42:13] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[42:16] places
[42:18] in christ
[42:20] these first four verses we're going to
[42:21] read
[42:23] paul
[42:24] is writing this under inspiration
[42:28] this is a very is a parallels exactly
[42:32] for the children of israel
[42:34] when they would come into their land
[42:36] remember the scriptures
[42:38] as bible readers remember in joshua 1
[42:41] joshua was to divide
[42:43] the inheritance
[42:45] by inspiration
[42:47] so what belonged to them that tribe it
[42:50] wasn't that when they came into the land
[42:52] that
[42:52] oh my you know god's just making up his
[42:54] mind no
[42:56] where they're blessing lay was in the
[42:58] land
[43:00] and so when they would come there
[43:02] joshua would come under that same
[43:05] inspiration
[43:06] of god that struck the hebrew mothers
[43:09] when they were giving birth and they
[43:11] would call out the name ruben
[43:14] gad or ephraim that same inspiration so
[43:18] joshua is there to bring forth
[43:21] that same inspiration to place the
[43:24] people
[43:25] in the land of promise so these first
[43:27] four verses is what is already settled
[43:30] in the mind of god
[43:32] because where we're at this is an
[43:34] outworking of god's drama
[43:37] are you with me
[43:38] we don't know you know you and i can
[43:40] look at certain things we see certain
[43:42] things this event or this or that and we
[43:44] see this one see that
[43:46] you or i don't know
[43:48] all of these other things you don't know
[43:49] who is and who isn't this is why it has
[43:52] to be just personal for our lives
[43:56] it's personal for our lives it's an
[43:57] outworking it's coming back to what god
[44:00] has for us so let's look here at verse 3
[44:03] once again blessed be the god and father
[44:05] of our lord jesus christ who hath
[44:08] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[44:11] in heavenly places
[44:14] in christ
[44:15] according as he hath chosen us
[44:18] in him
[44:20] before the foundation of the world
[44:22] that we should be holy and without blame
[44:25] before him
[44:26] in love
[44:28] having predestinated us unto the
[44:30] adoption that's the placement of
[44:32] children by jesus christ to himself
[44:36] according to the good pleasure of his
[44:38] will
[44:39] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[44:42] wherein he
[44:44] hath made us accepted in the beloved
[44:48] in whom now notice verse 7 now here's
[44:51] where to bring this to pass now as paul
[44:55] could say in verse 7 in whom we have
[44:58] redemption through his blood
[45:00] so in order to come back into this there
[45:02] had to come one from glory
[45:06] god had to come down and there had to be
[45:09] a shedding of blood
[45:11] life had to be given in order to bring
[45:14] us make a way that we can come back in
[45:18] to
[45:19] our inheritance
[45:22] there was no way to get back
[45:23] without god coming down
[45:26] and that's the grace of god
[45:28] in whom we have redemption through his
[45:30] blood the forgiveness of sins according
[45:33] to the riches of his grace how many is
[45:36] thankful he's rich in grace
[45:38] oh i'm thankful for that wherein he hath
[45:41] abounded toward us in all wisdom and
[45:43] prudence having made known unto us the
[45:46] mystery of his will according to his
[45:50] good pleasure which he hath purposed in
[45:53] himself
[45:54] that in the dispensation this is where
[45:57] i'm just moving to in verse 10 that in
[46:00] the dispensation of the fullness of
[46:02] times
[46:03] he might gather together
[46:06] in one
[46:07] all things
[46:09] in christ both which are in heaven and
[46:12] which are on earth even
[46:15] in him
[46:16] and verse 11 in whom also we have
[46:20] obtained
[46:21] an inheritance remember brother branham
[46:24] was very clear about this and laying it
[46:26] out he says jesus never left me an
[46:28] inheritance
[46:31] he brought me
[46:32] to my inheritance
[46:35] my inheritance was before the foundation
[46:38] of the world
[46:40] but jesus brought me to my inheritance
[46:43] who is it that brings you and i to our
[46:45] inheritance today
[46:47] the lord jesus
[46:49] the holy spirit brings you an eye and
[46:52] ties us back into our inheritance
[46:55] in whom also we have obtained an
[46:58] inheritance being predestinated
[47:01] according to the purpose of him who
[47:04] worketh all things after the council
[47:06] of his own will
[47:08] that we that we should be to the praise
[47:11] of his glory who first trusted in christ
[47:15] in whom ye also trusted
[47:18] after that you heard the word of truth
[47:20] the gospel of your salvation in whom
[47:24] also after that ye believe
[47:26] you were sealed with that holy spirit of
[47:29] promise which is the earnest of our
[47:32] inheritance unto the redemption of the
[47:35] purchase possession
[47:37] unto the praise of his glory
[47:40] may god bless you
[47:42] bless the reading of the word as you're
[47:44] being seated
[47:45] i'm not going to ask you to turn there
[47:47] but i'm going to read three verses out
[47:48] of first thessalonians 4 where i've been
[47:50] reading here for a few weeks
[47:53] but here in verse 16
[47:56] the announcement for the lord himself
[47:59] shall descend from heaven
[48:02] with a shout
[48:03] with the voice of the archangel and with
[48:06] the trump of god
[48:07] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[48:10] then
[48:11] we which are alive and remain
[48:14] shall be caught up together with them in
[48:17] the clouds to meet the lord in the air
[48:21] so shall we ever be
[48:23] with the lord
[48:24] wherefore comfort one another
[48:27] with these words
[48:29] i want to draw from from this this whole
[48:33] text that we've read and just draw a
[48:35] context from here and there's multiple
[48:38] things that i could speak or call this
[48:40] but i want to just speak on the
[48:42] gathering
[48:43] is unto him
[48:45] the gathering is unto him
[48:49] and so when we look at this of the shout
[48:52] this
[48:53] that god opens in this generation paul
[48:56] was was given
[48:58] this revelation there in first
[49:00] thessalonians 4 but in this
[49:03] generation it's open to us because this
[49:06] is the season of the rapture
[49:09] we are living in the coming of the lord
[49:12] the church of the living god since since
[49:15] there as he was he ascended up and they
[49:18] made their way to pentecost and under
[49:21] the direction of of the vindicated word
[49:24] and they received the promise the church
[49:26] of the living god down through the ages
[49:29] has lived with an expectation of the
[49:32] coming of the lord
[49:34] and this and this of where you and i are
[49:36] at in this hour
[49:38] of how that god in his grace makes known
[49:41] to you and i
[49:43] that this is the hour this is the season
[49:46] now we think about it how many years
[49:48] have passed even since god has taken the
[49:51] messenger off the scene
[49:53] uh you know some here we have you know
[49:55] some 57 years that we're coming up on
[49:58] that has been gone off the scene but
[50:00] remember
[50:01] the messenger to that age because
[50:04] is the one who influences that age to
[50:08] christ
[50:09] because before the ephesian age started
[50:11] paul was already gone
[50:13] paul had already been taken off the
[50:15] scene but he was the messenger for the
[50:18] ephesian age a message that was to
[50:21] influence that age back to jesus christ
[50:25] so when we look at that that ministry
[50:28] that's why that every true messenger
[50:31] down through time it must fall follow
[50:34] that same pattern that god gave through
[50:38] paul and in this hour that we're living
[50:40] in
[50:41] the revelation of this rapture is open
[50:44] to you and i
[50:45] that to recognize that he himself the
[50:48] lord himself
[50:50] as he is descending and we can take this
[50:53] not by our own mental abilities but
[50:56] because god by divine inspiration has
[50:59] taken the promises that have laid
[51:02] scattered throughout the scripture and
[51:05] pointed for this hour and tie them
[51:07] together that this is part of a single
[51:10] event of the lord himself descending it
[51:13] is the mighty angel of revelations 10 1
[51:17] that has come down
[51:18] so there's all three as brother branham
[51:20] would say he does all three while he's
[51:24] descending that's why
[51:26] this message that you and i have
[51:28] received it is truly the end time
[51:32] message
[51:33] and i think we can say it very clearly
[51:35] we are at the end of the end time
[51:39] we are here
[51:41] in the in this place we're recognizing
[51:44] and not just from the things that we're
[51:46] seeing but we catch it of how that god
[51:49] is moving and stirring in our hearts and
[51:52] this is where we are at in this junction
[51:55] or in this moment of the unfolding of
[51:58] the rapture we are living in the shout
[52:02] the message that has gone forth and if i
[52:04] can say it in this way we're not only
[52:06] living in the shout we are the shout
[52:09] we are the manifestation of the shout of
[52:12] the living god that has come among us
[52:15] because that shout is the very
[52:18] reproducing of the life of jesus christ
[52:21] in its fullness and it is the gathering
[52:25] unto himself because we are getting
[52:28] ready for the greatest migration that's
[52:30] ever hit the face of the earth we're
[52:33] getting ready to leave we're getting
[52:35] together and there's a place reserved
[52:38] that god has reserved to himself that
[52:41] place that you and i are being gathered
[52:43] to is in christ under the blood
[52:46] and so when we look at these scriptures
[52:49] here in in ephesians and thessalonians i
[52:53] i just i'm going to refer to out of the
[52:55] message the paradox and remembering take
[52:58] taking this thought with you that
[53:00] there's always a coming out and there's
[53:02] a going in there's two parts to
[53:04] redemption
[53:05] it's coming out of the world and going
[53:08] fully into christ
[53:10] because we can't go into christ as long
[53:12] as we're in the world but god brings us
[53:14] out of the world he takes the world out
[53:17] of us that he might place himself inside
[53:19] of us
[53:20] so it's all a work of redemption he's
[53:23] claiming what belongs to him
[53:25] so there's always that two parts of
[53:27] redemption and that's what brother adam
[53:30] is speaking about here in the message
[53:32] paradox and he's speaking of how god has
[53:34] made promises to us in this hour through
[53:37] revelations 10 through malachi 4 that
[53:40] there has to come an ephesians to all of
[53:44] this too what has been down through the
[53:47] church ages there's got to come in
[53:49] ephesians you say what are you talking
[53:51] about in ephesians we're talking about
[53:53] and entering into fully back into the
[53:56] promises of god there's got to be a
[53:59] deliverance come to the church of the
[54:01] living god there's got to be in
[54:03] ephesians to all this you see there's
[54:06] been three exodus there's been one
[54:09] exodus or you can say ephesians already
[54:12] where god sent a message down to egypt
[54:15] and he called them out of egypt and then
[54:18] they had to go into the land of canaan
[54:21] the message was not just come out of
[54:23] egypt but the message was come out and
[54:26] go into
[54:28] then there was the second exodus and god
[54:31] sent a man by the name of john the
[54:33] baptist to declare the second exodus is
[54:36] at hand and he's calling him out of a
[54:38] natural land this is the second exodus
[54:41] second ephesians he's calling him out of
[54:43] a natural land into the baptism of the
[54:47] holy ghost because it wasn't just enough
[54:50] just to be in the land of canaan that
[54:51] was only a type that would speak of the
[54:54] holy ghost a place where the believer
[54:57] was to dwell in him
[55:00] and so that second effort ephesians that
[55:02] second exodus is a is a translating from
[55:06] a natural land into the baptism of the
[55:09] holy ghost and where we stand in this
[55:12] hour in the third exodus or the third
[55:15] ephesians it is a moving from the
[55:19] baptism of the holy ghost into the
[55:21] promise in my father's house are many
[55:25] mansions
[55:26] so there's been these three
[55:29] three three ephesians these three exodus
[55:32] and we are in the third ephesians or the
[55:34] third exodus even right now and grace
[55:37] and this i want you to just just lock
[55:39] into this here for a moment in every one
[55:42] of these ephesians
[55:43] grace provided what was needed to make
[55:46] the journey
[55:49] i'd say god let that drop so fully let
[55:52] it stick to the fifth rib in my life
[55:55] because it's grace that's providing all
[55:58] along
[55:59] it'll be grace that morning when one of
[56:01] those lights sweep down and are changing
[56:04] the very atoms of your body it is grace
[56:06] that has provided for us throughout this
[56:09] journey
[56:11] grace provided them with the prophet
[56:13] grace provided them with the pillar of
[56:15] fire grace provided them with a
[56:17] sacrificial lamb to take them out of
[56:19] egypt think about it
[56:21] when they went down to the mightiest
[56:23] nation in the world and here god sends a
[56:26] message he gets a man
[56:28] separated from his own thinking from his
[56:31] own reason because remember moses was
[56:33] trying to do it on his own
[56:34] he was ye you know he he took one
[56:36] egyptian out but that's what his
[56:38] intellect did but when he could get
[56:41] before the presence of god and he not
[56:44] just heard about him now he saw him
[56:47] he was made manifest right before him
[56:49] and when he when he was made manifest
[56:51] before him that's why in more in less
[56:54] than five minutes there was more that
[56:57] took place in moses life than all the
[56:59] other years he spent down in egypt oh my
[57:02] you can never underestimate the presence
[57:05] of almighty god we must have his
[57:07] presence the quickening power must be
[57:10] here we must invite him and say lord
[57:13] that you would come
[57:16] grace has provided this and here stood
[57:19] moses in that moment when in his
[57:21] intellect he whipped one man but under
[57:24] the grace of god the shekinah glory
[57:27] they're receiving apart and red and and
[57:30] there how god moved in his life he goes
[57:33] down with a message to announce to them
[57:35] deliverance how can he announce
[57:37] deliverance because he himself has
[57:41] experienced deliverance so what he's
[57:43] preaching he is an example of it
[57:47] are you hearing me
[57:48] that's why the prophet could say the
[57:51] message and the messenger are one in the
[57:53] same
[57:54] hey listen that ain't just for the
[57:56] messenger and the message that's for the
[57:58] pastor in the message that's for every
[58:00] believer in the message the message in
[58:02] you are not to be two different people
[58:05] it's to be one voice altogether
[58:08] is to be the same
[58:10] as to be the amen in our life
[58:13] and he goes down there and defeats a
[58:15] whole nation
[58:17] who defeated a whole nation
[58:20] god did
[58:22] who brought them out god did
[58:25] but god told moses i just need to borrow
[58:28] you
[58:29] what do you need me to do i just need
[58:31] you to believe me and obey me what i
[58:33] tell you to do just do it you can't make
[58:36] it come to pass but if you'll just do it
[58:38] i'll come behind and it will be declared
[58:41] that it's not a man's doing but it's my
[58:43] doing
[58:46] joshua was there the whole time
[58:49] see when they came out of egypt
[58:54] they went through the the wilderness
[58:57] we know the
[58:58] spies went out to spy into the land
[59:02] and they went over there and they looked
[59:03] in the land
[59:05] and all they saw
[59:07] well those pine all they saw was giants
[59:09] except for joshua and caleb
[59:13] see joshua himself being a type of the
[59:16] end time messenger
[59:18] now follow me now
[59:19] being a type of the holy ghost in this
[59:22] hour
[59:23] are you hearing me
[59:25] caleb was inspired not by the things
[59:28] that he saw in the natural he was
[59:30] inspired to look beyond those things and
[59:33] he could see there is not a giant too
[59:37] big for my god
[59:40] all he could see is i already heard what
[59:42] the messenger spoke he said this is mine
[59:45] these are my redemptive rights that i'm
[59:48] going to take what belongs to me because
[59:50] he realized he wanted moses saying it he
[59:54] recognized this is god speaking through
[59:56] his prophet
[1:00:00] glory be to god in the highest so joshua
[1:00:02] was there the whole time joshua was
[1:00:05] right there in the camp joshua
[1:00:07] representing grace
[1:00:09] moses representing the law
[1:00:12] and to understand i'm just going to
[1:00:14] maybe have to read a few places here out
[1:00:17] of the message the paradox because i
[1:00:18] don't want this thought to be lost
[1:00:21] but joshua was representing grace and he
[1:00:24] says
[1:00:25] as uh it was right along with the law
[1:00:27] but it could not be enforced as long as
[1:00:30] law was in its proper place
[1:00:33] and he says so is it with as the church
[1:00:35] world in this last days it's come along
[1:00:37] it's played its part but there's coming
[1:00:39] a time it's got to cease there's got to
[1:00:42] be in ephesians of this journey just as
[1:00:45] there was other journeys there's got to
[1:00:47] come in ephesians and ephesus to this
[1:00:50] journey
[1:00:51] wherein the law could never save a
[1:00:53] sinner as i pointed out is that true the
[1:00:56] law could say you're guilty he could go
[1:00:58] offer up the blood of an innocent one
[1:01:00] but he still went out with the same
[1:01:01] desires
[1:01:03] he was never free
[1:01:04] that's why there had to come the blood
[1:01:06] of jesus that could reach down and deal
[1:01:08] with the root of the problem not keep
[1:01:10] snapping off the dandelion snapping it
[1:01:13] off snapping it off but a blood that
[1:01:15] could come down and deal with the sin
[1:01:17] question once and for all
[1:01:20] but god gave that as a provision looking
[1:01:23] forward to that perfect the antitype of
[1:01:25] the blood to come therefore he says the
[1:01:28] promised land represented a day of grace
[1:01:31] but he could not moses could not take
[1:01:33] them in into that journey and he says if
[1:01:36] you noticed in that journey they had
[1:01:39] three stages
[1:01:40] first was the preparation by faith down
[1:01:43] in egypt under a sacrificial lamb
[1:01:46] then they crossed the red sea the
[1:01:48] wilderness a separation which
[1:01:51] represented another stage of the journey
[1:01:53] so they come out of egypt they come
[1:01:56] through up to the red sea and at the red
[1:01:58] sea what takes place at the red sea god
[1:02:02] opens a way that the task masters
[1:02:05] the habits and and
[1:02:07] everything that was ruling over their
[1:02:10] life
[1:02:12] god opened the red sea
[1:02:14] speaking of the blood of the lord jesus
[1:02:18] because it's the blood that sanctifies
[1:02:20] and god opened that pathway man couldn't
[1:02:23] open that pathway
[1:02:25] man could not clean himself up and make
[1:02:27] himself a fit candidate for god
[1:02:30] but god remember grace provides
[1:02:34] and here grace providing and the red sea
[1:02:37] how is the red sea open god hear the
[1:02:40] word is spoken and as the word is spoken
[1:02:43] through the lips of a mortal man but
[1:02:45] it's not man's word the sea opens
[1:02:50] oh lord i wish i had time to really just
[1:02:52] camp down on this for a moment you see
[1:02:54] when we're looking at it in our lives
[1:02:57] there's some things that can stand in
[1:02:59] front of you are you hearing me this
[1:03:00] morning there's things that can stand in
[1:03:02] front of you along your journey let me
[1:03:04] just say this don't check out if you say
[1:03:07] brother samuel i don't know if i've went
[1:03:08] all the way don't check out this is for
[1:03:10] everybody there are things that you have
[1:03:13] got to stand there that are facing right
[1:03:16] in front of you you need to speak the
[1:03:18] word to that situation
[1:03:22] you're given authority to address it
[1:03:24] that word that can be spoken it can be
[1:03:27] confession confess your sin he's
[1:03:30] faithful and just to forgive you that
[1:03:32] devil that stands there like a big old
[1:03:33] boogeyman when you'll take god at his
[1:03:36] word you'll find the rushing mighty wind
[1:03:38] go to work and dismiss him out of the
[1:03:41] way
[1:03:43] we've got to take god at his word and
[1:03:44] speak to that thing
[1:03:48] and let god come behind it
[1:03:50] in that second stage of the journey god
[1:03:54] opened up that way for them and what was
[1:03:56] happening
[1:03:57] what was happening in this journey
[1:04:02] they
[1:04:03] there was more distance between them and
[1:04:07] the world
[1:04:09] but samuel that's pretty simple i know
[1:04:11] it is i thank god it is but you see
[1:04:14] in order to get over to the promised
[1:04:16] land they couldn't just come right out
[1:04:18] on the border of egypt they had to walk
[1:04:21] toward the promise
[1:04:24] and as you walk toward the promise come
[1:04:26] on now i'm talking about in your life
[1:04:28] then once you walk towards him the world
[1:04:31] and you becomes further separated
[1:04:35] come on young people order a light this
[1:04:38] is applying the basis the basis the
[1:04:40] simple abcs of the word of god it's walk
[1:04:44] toward him look unto him who is the
[1:04:47] author and finisher of your faith and if
[1:04:50] you keep your eyes on him instead of
[1:04:53] just dwelling there well i don't feel
[1:04:54] worthy and i don't know if i am that's a
[1:04:57] mind battle
[1:04:59] that's a mind battle and satan's only
[1:05:01] doing that to try to hang it over your
[1:05:03] head what do i have to do i would look
[1:05:06] to him i would look to the one who's
[1:05:09] speaking to me and start making some
[1:05:12] footsteps start bringing distance
[1:05:14] between yourself and the world
[1:05:20] i feel like preaching boy
[1:05:26] now you see
[1:05:27] they come up into that place
[1:05:29] they were all under preparation
[1:05:32] but as they come there
[1:05:34] they come to the red sea
[1:05:37] and brother graham said there was a
[1:05:38] failure
[1:05:39] again the people didn't believe
[1:05:42] after they saw all these signs
[1:05:45] i'm telling you they walked out of egypt
[1:05:47] the greatest power on earth
[1:05:51] nation
[1:05:52] and they were delivered by the blood of
[1:05:55] the lamb
[1:05:58] whoo
[1:05:59] it didn't matter how massive and how
[1:06:01] great and how structured the army was it
[1:06:04] was no match for the blood of the lamb
[1:06:07] and how did the blood come the blood of
[1:06:09] the lamb the pathway was revealed
[1:06:12] through the message of the hour
[1:06:15] glory be to god it was revealed in that
[1:06:18] hour this is the way out
[1:06:22] it never you see the gospel never leaves
[1:06:25] the blood because the gospel is based on
[1:06:28] the blood and the blood runs a trail
[1:06:30] clear back to the lamb's book of life
[1:06:33] from the beginning that's why when the
[1:06:35] holy ghost is come it ties you back in
[1:06:38] to your inheritance
[1:06:40] it's the blood trail the scarlet cord
[1:06:43] that runs clear all the way on back
[1:06:46] the red sea
[1:06:47] here they come they come to a place they
[1:06:50] should have had faith
[1:06:51] but instead they stand there oh you
[1:06:53] brought us out here to die all this is
[1:06:55] going on oh look at look at pharaoh's
[1:06:58] army look at all this and they were and
[1:07:00] there was a failure
[1:07:03] that's what law does
[1:07:06] i said that's what law does
[1:07:08] because you know why law is based on
[1:07:11] what you can do
[1:07:13] what you can control
[1:07:18] that's why we're not to live
[1:07:20] by law
[1:07:22] you can never live a victorious life in
[1:07:24] christ living by the law
[1:07:27] now i know when god gets a hold of our
[1:07:29] life we start out and lose friends we
[1:07:31] should be sincere but i think you
[1:07:33] understand what i'm saying maybe for
[1:07:34] younger ones and older ones alike that
[1:07:36] when we first started out there's things
[1:07:38] that were so you know do i do this and
[1:07:40] do it because the reason is we're
[1:07:42] desiring to so please him
[1:07:45] it isn't that we become loose but we
[1:07:47] begin to recognize wait a minute it's
[1:07:49] grace that brought me faith this far
[1:07:53] god never intended me to walk around and
[1:07:55] bite my nails all the time and wonder if
[1:07:57] i'm pleasing i have been accepted in the
[1:08:01] beloved
[1:08:02] [Applause]
[1:08:04] that's why god would say and repeat it
[1:08:06] to joshua as i was with moses and all
[1:08:09] his failures in all his mistakes i will
[1:08:12] be with you
[1:08:13] i will not forsake you
[1:08:19] oh my my my
[1:08:21] now notice brother brown said they were
[1:08:22] baptized they had repented and were
[1:08:25] baptized they had come out to walk in a
[1:08:27] new life in a new land in a newness
[1:08:29] journey among new people and the hand of
[1:08:31] god was upon them but it finally come to
[1:08:33] a place in this walk that they had
[1:08:36] they was not satisfied
[1:08:38] with their walk of grace
[1:08:41] and they had to come to something
[1:08:44] that they could do themselves
[1:08:46] now listen walk in right here
[1:08:48] now that's where people think today of
[1:08:50] divine healing or some other work of
[1:08:52] grace of god
[1:08:54] that there is something that you
[1:08:56] have to do
[1:08:59] you
[1:09:00] he says there is nothing you have to do
[1:09:03] but believe just believe god
[1:09:08] now let's be real simple here
[1:09:10] if you knew you know i never lived in
[1:09:12] florida thank god but brother carlos did
[1:09:15] and whoever else did
[1:09:16] and i know when they talk about storms
[1:09:18] coming up
[1:09:20] just like our snowstorms that we have
[1:09:22] here you have snowstorms come in here
[1:09:23] and oh we need to buy the bread we need
[1:09:25] to do this and the snow's coming well
[1:09:27] down in florida it's a little bit
[1:09:29] different when they talk about a
[1:09:30] hurricane coming in it's more than
[1:09:31] buying bread
[1:09:33] you're trying to make sure you got gas
[1:09:34] for your generator
[1:09:36] and you also know that you got to go out
[1:09:38] and try to beat the rest of them and get
[1:09:41] that osb board or hopefully you've kept
[1:09:43] some over you know and
[1:09:45] because you got to board up the windows
[1:09:47] is that right brother carlos but you see
[1:09:50] what if somebody made you an
[1:09:51] announcement and they said a hurricane's
[1:09:53] coming you said wow man that's wow
[1:09:56] that's that's pretty good and i walked
[1:09:57] on say hey man a hurricane's coming hey
[1:10:00] buddy a hurricane's coming wow man
[1:10:02] hurricane's coming i can't get back
[1:10:04] there to you hurricane's coming
[1:10:06] wow hurricane's coming and then we go by
[1:10:09] your house
[1:10:11] and we see you on the porch with sweet
[1:10:12] tea
[1:10:15] i thought you told me there was a
[1:10:16] hurricane coming oh there is but you see
[1:10:18] what you're looking for is if you really
[1:10:21] believed what you're talking about you
[1:10:23] would go out and get the wood and start
[1:10:25] putting it on the windows
[1:10:26] you see belief is not just something we
[1:10:29] acknowledge but belief is active
[1:10:33] it moves in action whether i don't even
[1:10:35] see the hurricane winds i don't even
[1:10:37] feel them right now but there's already
[1:10:39] been an announcement and faith moves in
[1:10:41] action to what i've heard
[1:10:46] so here when we look at there's nothing
[1:10:48] you have to do that doesn't mean we just
[1:10:49] set back it means okay god has said that
[1:10:52] this is going to be what i need to do
[1:10:54] you need to go buy the osb
[1:10:56] but except you know what we don't have
[1:10:58] to go back god said i've already got it
[1:10:59] provided
[1:11:01] all you got to do is surrender and you
[1:11:02] just receive the osb the board all the
[1:11:04] screws everything i've got it all
[1:11:06] provided all you got to do is take it
[1:11:08] and put it on
[1:11:10] then when the storm comes i will show up
[1:11:14] and manifest my glory
[1:11:18] because you can't just sit in the house
[1:11:19] and don't put up the wood and the glass
[1:11:21] is flying in but i thought god said he's
[1:11:23] going to protect me god said i am your
[1:11:25] protection i am your stay but you better
[1:11:28] put my word my you better put the osb on
[1:11:30] the windows and on the door
[1:11:33] that's showing you believe
[1:11:36] is that right
[1:11:37] now if they would have believed they
[1:11:39] would have continued on you see the
[1:11:41] promise was before the law without any
[1:11:44] conditions to it i have given you this
[1:11:46] land go on over into it but they got to
[1:11:49] that promise and they decided there was
[1:11:53] something they must do
[1:11:55] themselves
[1:11:59] [Music]
[1:12:02] and that
[1:12:03] we still find that among human beings
[1:12:07] we're oh i like that
[1:12:09] we're prone to be that way
[1:12:14] i said we're prone to be that way
[1:12:18] you see even after the holy ghost has
[1:12:20] come
[1:12:21] and you have followed the grace of god
[1:12:24] that's given that's brought correction
[1:12:26] to our life chastening of the lord to
[1:12:28] bring us to that place as we surrender
[1:12:30] to his word that he comes and does the
[1:12:33] full work and there's a real genuine
[1:12:35] experience in our life it still does not
[1:12:38] strip away the humanity of even times
[1:12:41] that we forget wait a minute i didn't do
[1:12:44] this work in my life
[1:12:46] i can't do it in this one's life or this
[1:12:48] one's life
[1:12:50] but as human beings we're prone to
[1:12:55] as much as i want to see change in you
[1:12:57] know lives and hearts and everything i
[1:12:59] can't make that change come to pass over
[1:13:02] the same you just lay your hand and pray
[1:13:03] for them that don't work that way
[1:13:07] i believe in laying hands on them they
[1:13:09] laid hands on them and they received the
[1:13:11] holy ghost but there's got to be
[1:13:13] preparation on the heart of that
[1:13:16] individual and that takes the grace of
[1:13:18] god not the law
[1:13:21] [Music]
[1:13:23] we can really learn a big lesson because
[1:13:25] we're trying to do things and wondering
[1:13:27] why god ain't coming behind it and god
[1:13:30] says i ain't going to share my glory
[1:13:32] with you
[1:13:36] this is my work
[1:13:38] it's my doing
[1:13:40] and when he gives his word he gives his
[1:13:43] word so as we will obey his word
[1:13:46] not just agree with it and go around and
[1:13:48] shake hands but agree with it then what
[1:13:51] happens when he comes he vindicates the
[1:13:55] word that he gave to us
[1:14:00] oh my you love him
[1:14:02] i'm trying to get somewhere there is
[1:14:04] something we're prone to be that way
[1:14:07] how many say god help me
[1:14:09] let me continue to die to myself
[1:14:13] there is something we've got to do we
[1:14:15] feel that
[1:14:16] we've got to do something into it also
[1:14:19] you do have something into it
[1:14:23] that's your surrender
[1:14:26] of your own will
[1:14:28] your own idea
[1:14:31] that's continuously
[1:14:33] that's continuously
[1:14:35] to the will
[1:14:36] and idea now i know friends listen
[1:14:38] sometimes we want to think every thought
[1:14:40] that comes our way is this is thus saith
[1:14:42] the lord
[1:14:44] the bible said try every spirit
[1:14:47] try every thought
[1:14:50] notice this to the will we're to
[1:14:52] surrender our own will our own idea to
[1:14:54] the will and idea of almighty god and
[1:14:58] it's finished see
[1:15:00] we surrender right there the surrender
[1:15:02] that's the finish
[1:15:04] the finish yeah it's the finish
[1:15:07] of us
[1:15:09] that's all there is just take his
[1:15:10] promise don't think of nothing else walk
[1:15:13] by it and god
[1:15:15] does the rest
[1:15:17] now when we think of this i want you to
[1:15:19] think of these words the believer's
[1:15:21] achievement
[1:15:23] the believer's achievement
[1:15:25] because we recognize the promises
[1:15:28] this
[1:15:29] ephesians that we are in
[1:15:31] in moving back into all the promises of
[1:15:34] god
[1:15:35] into that of the rapture
[1:15:37] the change of the body
[1:15:39] the millennium all of these things that
[1:15:41] are great precious promises and it is
[1:15:44] the anointing of the hour that comes
[1:15:48] upon the word
[1:15:50] upon the people of god it's the
[1:15:52] anointing of the hour the holy ghost and
[1:15:56] it is the dove of god that is leading us
[1:15:59] to life
[1:16:00] it leads us to death to self
[1:16:04] to a personal calvary crucifying of the
[1:16:07] flesh with the affections and the lust
[1:16:10] thereof that we would take up our cross
[1:16:13] where the pulsation in our lives is not
[1:16:15] my will be done but thine will be done
[1:16:19] and being filled with the prevailing
[1:16:21] power of jesus christ
[1:16:25] it's an achievement now i want to look
[1:16:27] at
[1:16:28] abraham's life for a few minutes if you
[1:16:30] look in romans chapter 4
[1:16:32] here because
[1:16:35] when we speak of the believer's
[1:16:36] achievement
[1:16:38] it's not something we've done
[1:16:40] but it's the grace of god that has come
[1:16:43] to us to provide what is needed
[1:16:47] so that we might come to the place
[1:16:50] of achievement
[1:16:52] of what god
[1:16:53] desires to achieve through our lives
[1:16:56] now look at abraham's life
[1:16:58] here's abraham in romans 4 11. i want
[1:17:01] you just to look at it in this way
[1:17:03] how that the achievement of the living
[1:17:05] god was moving in abraham's life as he
[1:17:09] fully obeyed
[1:17:11] god
[1:17:12] god would reveal himself come down
[1:17:15] through many different ways he would
[1:17:17] speak to him there would be lights there
[1:17:19] would be dreams there would be visions
[1:17:21] and how god the very first time god
[1:17:24] would make himself known he would there
[1:17:26] in genesis 14 as far as in a
[1:17:28] manifestation would be there with
[1:17:30] melchizedek and he would reveal himself
[1:17:33] that he is the king and priest of the
[1:17:35] most high god and he would let abraham
[1:17:38] know that you are of and blessed of the
[1:17:41] most high god
[1:17:43] he would bring to abraham what was
[1:17:45] needed the bread and the wine then we
[1:17:48] find here you know a chapter or a few
[1:17:51] chapters later here god would make
[1:17:53] himself known to abraham as el shaddai
[1:17:56] the breasted one in other words you
[1:17:59] don't have what you need in order to
[1:18:01] bring this to pass you've got my word
[1:18:03] you've walked in my word you've done
[1:18:05] what i've asked but now what's needed
[1:18:08] you must draw your strength from me i am
[1:18:12] the life giver to the promise
[1:18:15] and he reveals himself as el shaddai
[1:18:19] take my life into your life i am the
[1:18:22] almighty god
[1:18:24] and then he comes and he manifests
[1:18:26] himself in the next chapter to abraham
[1:18:29] as elohim the self-existing god it's
[1:18:32] been the same god all along but now god
[1:18:36] stands before his tent door in flesh and
[1:18:40] now what is there with hindrances doubts
[1:18:43] and things in sarah's heart he came to
[1:18:47] deal with the doubts and the thoughts
[1:18:49] that were there
[1:18:51] sarah had him
[1:18:53] are you hearing me sarah had him
[1:18:55] abraham himself here he had experienced
[1:18:58] that that that divine change and how
[1:19:01] it's come into his life he's had a name
[1:19:04] change
[1:19:05] but he stands there
[1:19:06] and here comes
[1:19:08] the living god right down once again but
[1:19:11] he's come
[1:19:12] with a special visitation for sarah
[1:19:17] because sarah is god's intended womb
[1:19:23] hagar the woman the bondage hagar is a
[1:19:27] type of the law god never intended the
[1:19:30] promise to come by the law
[1:19:34] is that right because the law all it
[1:19:36] does it produces a wild man
[1:19:39] come on friends
[1:19:41] because they were debating and fussing
[1:19:43] and this and that now look david had an
[1:19:45] unction like others that could look into
[1:19:47] the law david could have delight in the
[1:19:49] law but david was under the anointing of
[1:19:52] christ that could look forward he could
[1:19:54] rejoice and he wasn't and he wasn't
[1:19:56] rejoicing in himself but this in this
[1:19:59] moment was god coming down to bring a
[1:20:03] release in sarah's life god could not do
[1:20:06] anything until sarah first believed
[1:20:11] are you hearing me
[1:20:13] god will not override unbelief
[1:20:16] listen to me now don't hang your heads
[1:20:18] but god himself makes it his personal
[1:20:21] business to deal with unbelief because
[1:20:24] unbelief is a spiritual power
[1:20:27] unbelief is a spirit
[1:20:29] come on friends a spirit that would want
[1:20:31] to hang around like brother ram said
[1:20:33] when he was younger he wanted to give
[1:20:35] his life to the lord but there was a
[1:20:37] spirit that hung over him that was
[1:20:39] preventing him from making that
[1:20:41] surrender unbelief is not a thought it's
[1:20:45] a devil
[1:20:47] and one spiritual power it has to be a
[1:20:50] greater spiritual power that's able to
[1:20:53] come on the scene and here you and i are
[1:20:55] and we're looking and beholding this
[1:20:58] contest as it opens up before us and god
[1:21:02] in the middle of that contest between
[1:21:04] faith and unbelief between faith and
[1:21:08] doubt god comes on the scene and he
[1:21:11] raises our faith
[1:21:13] in him
[1:21:16] because if our faith gets raised in him
[1:21:19] all things
[1:21:21] are possible
[1:21:23] to them that
[1:21:24] believe
[1:21:26] notice where abraham is at
[1:21:28] the bible says in verse 17
[1:21:31] i have made thee a father of many
[1:21:33] nations before him whom he believed even
[1:21:36] god
[1:21:37] who quickeneth the dead and calleth
[1:21:40] those things which be not as though they
[1:21:42] were
[1:21:43] who against
[1:21:45] hope
[1:21:46] believed in
[1:21:48] hope
[1:21:50] come on now
[1:21:51] though a host shouldn't camp round about
[1:21:54] me
[1:21:55] let me tell you this host went far out
[1:21:56] it was right there
[1:22:00] are you with me now right here every day
[1:22:02] you're reminded of your mortality
[1:22:05] right here every day you pack this
[1:22:07] carnal thing around
[1:22:09] right here every day you've got to bring
[1:22:11] it in subjection to the word come on now
[1:22:14] with everything but that's why god he's
[1:22:16] given you the holy ghost and there's a
[1:22:18] son and daughter of god on the inside
[1:22:20] that when temptation arise there's a
[1:22:23] strength on the inside that says but god
[1:22:26] said
[1:22:28] but god has said
[1:22:30] oh my who against expectation believed
[1:22:35] in expectation that he might become the
[1:22:38] father of many nations according to that
[1:22:41] which was spoken so shall thy seed be
[1:22:44] against expectation he believed why that
[1:22:47] he might become so he expected against
[1:22:50] everything else he wake up one morning
[1:22:53] oh my maybe his back is hurting worse
[1:22:55] than it was the you know last week but
[1:22:58] he believed god has made the promise and
[1:23:02] i am expecting it god made me the
[1:23:04] promise of the holy ghost i may not feel
[1:23:07] any closer but that promise it belongs
[1:23:10] to me it's an expectation that belongs
[1:23:13] to me and i'm gonna believe why that i
[1:23:16] might become what god has said
[1:23:19] concerning my life
[1:23:21] he spoke his word over me and he can't
[1:23:25] go back on his word he's not a man that
[1:23:28] he should lie the word of god is sure
[1:23:35] i wish i was twice as tall
[1:23:38] hallelujah i feel like running here
[1:23:41] about ready to do a jericho march
[1:23:46] hallelujah
[1:23:48] well brother i'm not just looking at
[1:23:50] this for myself brother joey i'm looking
[1:23:52] at this promise and for every need
[1:23:54] that's here right now this morning i see
[1:23:56] this promise for every child of god who
[1:23:59] against hope believed in hope that we
[1:24:02] might become the father
[1:24:05] we might become the word that he has
[1:24:07] spoken over our lives
[1:24:11] brother dave he spoke it over our lives
[1:24:13] there's only one way to go brother
[1:24:15] carlos and that's come up hither
[1:24:19] come up into him in all things there's
[1:24:21] only one place to go
[1:24:23] and let him take us there
[1:24:26] and being not weak in faith
[1:24:30] he considered not his own body
[1:24:33] now dead
[1:24:35] remember he had fathered an ishmael
[1:24:40] god said
[1:24:41] i'll let you die buddy we'll be
[1:24:44] following no more children after this
[1:24:45] one
[1:24:46] i'm gonna let you get to a place where
[1:24:48] it's completely impossible
[1:24:51] well you're not just looking for is
[1:24:53] there another womb out there i'm gonna
[1:24:54] it's getting to a place of impossibility
[1:24:57] they weren't just they had been bearing
[1:24:59] their whole life
[1:25:02] are you with me and it tremendous god's
[1:25:05] choosing looks beyond what you and i can
[1:25:07] see
[1:25:08] if we were looking at this promise right
[1:25:10] here we would probably be looking at
[1:25:12] things that will be fertile and man i'll
[1:25:13] tell you this is almost a guarantee
[1:25:15] that's us
[1:25:16] come on friends we try to do things that
[1:25:18] say oh you know what yeah i think this
[1:25:21] is way yeah i think this makes sense
[1:25:22] well glory to god it just
[1:25:24] jesus thank you this just makes sense
[1:25:27] and god said i ain't in that a bit.
[1:25:31] see we do things so much by our
[1:25:33] reasoning and reasoning is not faith
[1:25:36] it's the greatest enemy against faith
[1:25:41] is that right
[1:25:43] now notice this his own body now dead
[1:25:46] when he was about 100 years old neither
[1:25:48] yet the deadness of sarah's womb this
[1:25:51] was reminders all the time
[1:25:55] what god has said but here
[1:25:57] is deadness all around you
[1:26:01] oh my
[1:26:02] he staggered not at the promise of god
[1:26:04] through unbelief but was strong
[1:26:07] in faith somebody say that with me
[1:26:09] strong in faith let's say it again
[1:26:11] strong in faith read the next part with
[1:26:14] me giving glory to god
[1:26:18] oh my my back's hurting a little bit
[1:26:21] more oh i'm feeling a little bit weak
[1:26:22] what are you going to do abraham i think
[1:26:24] i'm going to turn up my praise
[1:26:30] drown out the doubt
[1:26:32] holding my shield of
[1:26:34] faith come on now i'm talking about
[1:26:38] walking and cutting that's why brother
[1:26:40] brown says you cut the devil you chopped
[1:26:42] the devil you hit him you everything you
[1:26:45] keep on coming at him because he's
[1:26:47] coming at you but the promise is sure
[1:26:50] because the god who spoke it is sure
[1:26:56] he was strong in the faith now remember
[1:27:00] if this is egypt over here
[1:27:03] abraham was not standing over here
[1:27:06] by chaldeas he was strong in the faith
[1:27:10] this scripture we're reading in romans 4
[1:27:13] was not when he started
[1:27:15] there listen to me now there was a
[1:27:17] strength
[1:27:18] of faith that you could look at and say
[1:27:21] he's leaving his family business
[1:27:23] he was a god maker
[1:27:25] he's living he's living he's leaving the
[1:27:28] nativity i mean he ain't got nobody if
[1:27:30] they do have youngins he ain't got
[1:27:31] nobody to help babysit him when they
[1:27:33] want to have a date night or not then he
[1:27:35] leaves everybody
[1:27:37] what's he doing
[1:27:41] going leaving all the nativity what are
[1:27:43] you seeing faith to move out on the
[1:27:45] promise
[1:27:46] right it was a it was a strengthening of
[1:27:49] faith but you see his faith would only
[1:27:52] grow stronger as he believed and obeyed
[1:27:56] the word of god ask abraham abraham do
[1:27:58] you believe what i told you about
[1:28:01] separating coming out of the land of the
[1:28:03] nativity coming out from among your
[1:28:04] kindred absolutely god i believe it all
[1:28:07] the way i believe it look where i'm at
[1:28:10] and god said
[1:28:11] um
[1:28:12] you got your daddy with you still
[1:28:15] and i thought i told you to leave all
[1:28:16] your kindred
[1:28:18] yes lord now look look at god's grace
[1:28:20] abraham is rejoicing he's shouting he
[1:28:23] should be look what he's come out of
[1:28:26] he should be don't condemn him you and i
[1:28:28] were in the same place
[1:28:30] it took faith to come out that way
[1:28:33] is that right
[1:28:34] faith is acting upon god's word not
[1:28:36] knowing where you're going not knowing
[1:28:38] how it's going to come to pass but i am
[1:28:40] going to stand on god's word
[1:28:45] abraham is shouting
[1:28:48] and all of a sudden
[1:28:49] god says i see my boy needs a little bit
[1:28:51] of help
[1:28:53] his faith needs stirred a little bit
[1:28:55] because he's packing lot and his daddy
[1:28:57] brother graham called them hairs in the
[1:28:59] biscuit i hate hairs in my food
[1:29:03] maybe if i put more hair in my food or
[1:29:04] somebody did i'd lose weight
[1:29:06] i can't i'll tell you the lord knows i
[1:29:08] can't but anyhow
[1:29:09] you see when we look at this
[1:29:11] hero came a time and god said abraham
[1:29:14] needs help this is grace church
[1:29:16] i'm talking about grace now
[1:29:19] god said he needed help brother branham
[1:29:21] breaks in on he said what a hard thing
[1:29:23] it was for abraham to separate from his
[1:29:26] nephew because he loved him
[1:29:28] he didn't see did not separate because
[1:29:31] he didn't love him are you hearing me
[1:29:33] now he separated because he loved god
[1:29:37] more
[1:29:40] are you hearing me that's why he
[1:29:42] separated his love for god was more and
[1:29:45] god seen that abraham needed help
[1:29:49] so god allowed a disturbance to come up
[1:29:52] argument
[1:29:54] these things took place
[1:29:55] and finally oh abraham's eyes become old
[1:29:58] we can't hey
[1:29:59] we're not focused on the same thing
[1:30:01] we're not
[1:30:02] you go this way i'll go this way if you
[1:30:04] choose this way i'll choose this way
[1:30:05] what's he doing he's declaring there is
[1:30:07] a need for separation
[1:30:10] what is causing him brother greg to make
[1:30:12] that decision the promise that he's
[1:30:15] holding
[1:30:16] in his life
[1:30:18] it's like when you receive a child or
[1:30:21] one in the womb
[1:30:23] getting ready to come to birth
[1:30:25] or are you hearing me now
[1:30:27] when you have a child that's in the womb
[1:30:30] getting ready to come to birth
[1:30:32] you want to watch over that
[1:30:34] you don't want your wife out playing
[1:30:36] volleyball
[1:30:37] come on now
[1:30:39] you know i mean you you you you because
[1:30:41] you're looking at it hey we got to
[1:30:43] protect this life and i know god's given
[1:30:45] protection all around that but even you
[1:30:46] start looking and say honey i'll drive
[1:30:48] you i don't want you driving behind a
[1:30:50] steering wheel
[1:30:51] you you look for all the
[1:30:53] protections why are you doing that
[1:30:54] because i know
[1:30:56] that there's a child that's begotten
[1:30:59] that needs to come to birth
[1:31:02] are you hearing me now this is just
[1:31:04] exactly how it is with a life that has
[1:31:07] been begotten but it's not coming to a
[1:31:09] full born-again experience
[1:31:12] there's nutrients that have to be taken
[1:31:14] in
[1:31:17] i love my wife got some cravings because
[1:31:19] she liked some things that i liked
[1:31:22] probably wasn't too good for me but i
[1:31:24] liked them
[1:31:25] when paul was coming along well honey i
[1:31:27] won't tell all that because i don't
[1:31:28] embarrass you but it wasn't all her i
[1:31:30] just you man i was like good lord i'm
[1:31:32] glad these cravings are this way you
[1:31:34] know it wasn't pickles and ice cream and
[1:31:36] stuff like that and if it was for you
[1:31:37] that's all right but you know what them
[1:31:38] cravings are it's because the life on
[1:31:41] the inside
[1:31:43] the life is craving that on the inside
[1:31:45] and that's why when god is dealing with
[1:31:48] the life you say here you are you start
[1:31:50] out right here what do i do put distance
[1:31:53] between yourself and egypt how do i do
[1:31:55] that grow strong in the faith how do i
[1:31:58] do that eat the nutrients of the word of
[1:32:01] god
[1:32:04] they're spiritual vitamins that's needed
[1:32:09] and the church is in travail
[1:32:15] zion travaileth to bring forth
[1:32:18] life
[1:32:20] are you hearing me now
[1:32:22] see this is all it's growing strong in
[1:32:24] the faith
[1:32:26] you see
[1:32:27] faith itself
[1:32:29] faith is not something brother random
[1:32:30] put it down so simple
[1:32:32] got it right here in my notes but i'm
[1:32:34] just going to go ahead and preach it as
[1:32:35] it's coming
[1:32:36] faith
[1:32:37] he said is not something he said
[1:32:39] sometimes people try to go message token
[1:32:42] they try to do some supernatural faith
[1:32:44] in order to get healing and he said
[1:32:46] that's why you miss it
[1:32:50] he said you apply the blood with common
[1:32:53] faith
[1:32:55] say what's common faith
[1:32:57] is anybody in here worried about whether
[1:32:59] your car is going to start out there
[1:33:01] nobody's thought about i wonder if i'm
[1:33:04] maybe not better talking to everybody
[1:33:06] but
[1:33:06] you're not you're you're planning on
[1:33:08] when i leave out of here you know you're
[1:33:10] not even thinking about oh i wonder if
[1:33:12] the piston is going to kick over here i
[1:33:13] wonder if the oil i don't know how it
[1:33:14] all works i wonder if it's going to
[1:33:16] happen oh i wonder if that's going to
[1:33:17] happen i wonder if that's going to
[1:33:18] happen oh i wonder if that's going to
[1:33:19] happen i wonder if this gas is real or
[1:33:21] if it's water are you you're not
[1:33:22] thinking about that
[1:33:25] you're not thinking about you know you
[1:33:27] know even you know another thing i hope
[1:33:29] you're not thinking about where you're
[1:33:29] gonna go eat at you know you're not
[1:33:31] you're not even considering that like oh
[1:33:33] man i wonder if i'm gonna be able to get
[1:33:34] back home i wonder if they got that
[1:33:35] street blocked oh i wonder if they've
[1:33:37] got the manhole cover on there oh i
[1:33:38] wonder if they you're not thinking about
[1:33:40] that why
[1:33:42] because it's faith
[1:33:45] it's subconscious
[1:33:46] are you hearing me now
[1:33:50] it's faith it's faith to get in your car
[1:33:52] turn the key and drive
[1:33:56] it's common faith
[1:33:59] but god comes down to stimulate
[1:34:02] common faith in him
[1:34:06] that's why god sends his gifts in the
[1:34:08] church that's why the holy ghost comes
[1:34:11] is to stimulate faith from just on
[1:34:14] earthbound things that you and i don't
[1:34:16] even think about about doing it's just
[1:34:18] done subconsciously but he comes to
[1:34:20] stimulate our faith in him for there are
[1:34:24] greater promises more precious than just
[1:34:27] getting in our car and going home
[1:34:30] he does that you see a grace provides it
[1:34:33] not us
[1:34:34] grace provides it
[1:34:36] but you've got to accept what grace
[1:34:38] provides
[1:34:39] are you hearing me caleb and them went
[1:34:41] over there and the ghosts piled the land
[1:34:43] you know what that was about god wasn't
[1:34:45] interested in saying hey you know what i
[1:34:47] don't know how that looks over there but
[1:34:48] why don't y'all go see what it looks
[1:34:50] like and you come back and tell me what
[1:34:51] you think that ain't why god sent them
[1:34:53] in the land
[1:34:55] god sent them into the land to see
[1:34:58] what belonged to him when they shouldn't
[1:35:00] they should have been looking at the
[1:35:02] promises and better they should have
[1:35:03] been getting excited and saying praise
[1:35:05] god just any day now my feet are going
[1:35:08] to step right here i don't know exactly
[1:35:10] where my allotment is but all the land
[1:35:12] is good it don't matter what he's called
[1:35:14] me to do but as long as i'm in jesus
[1:35:16] christ it doesn't matter a bit
[1:35:21] but instead
[1:35:23] they got over there looking at giants
[1:35:26] and what happened doubt came in
[1:35:29] fear came in
[1:35:30] everything came in
[1:35:34] and here was joshua
[1:35:35] and caleb
[1:35:37] they were coming back they had grapes
[1:35:39] grape juice great pudding
[1:35:44] what are y'all doing oh we just got we
[1:35:46] got grapes glory to god it's just
[1:35:48] exactly what was said a lamb the flow of
[1:35:50] the milk and honey
[1:35:52] you see one
[1:35:54] doubt had taken hold
[1:35:57] they looked and were focused on the
[1:35:59] giants that were there anytime you go to
[1:36:01] take a promise of god the devil makes
[1:36:03] sure because listen the devil ain't
[1:36:05] worrying about some barren land he wants
[1:36:07] to camp on promises
[1:36:11] are you hearing me now
[1:36:13] he wants to camp on those promises and
[1:36:15] when they came back down through there
[1:36:17] they came focused on the evidence of the
[1:36:19] land and what was it doing building
[1:36:21] faith in their life
[1:36:24] listen friends
[1:36:25] you can't get faith outside of the word
[1:36:28] of god
[1:36:29] the bible said faith come about hearing
[1:36:31] and hearing by the word of god if you
[1:36:33] ain't no further than you ought to be is
[1:36:35] because you're not giving yourself to
[1:36:37] god the way you should be
[1:36:39] are you hearing me oh brother samuel
[1:36:41] that stings a little bit it's all right
[1:36:43] say ouch oh me it'd always be good look
[1:36:45] like you pour the peroxide on there or
[1:36:47] in the curriculum it'll sting it first
[1:36:49] but it'll do good it'll drive out the
[1:36:50] infection and get healing ready to start
[1:36:53] you have got to take the word faith is i
[1:36:56] believe it and i'm going to act upon it
[1:37:00] but if you don't act on it you can't
[1:37:02] expect god to come in lord i've been
[1:37:03] waiting on you to do it been waiting on
[1:37:05] me to do it
[1:37:07] i'm the fire that comes on the altar but
[1:37:09] you got to make the altar
[1:37:11] you got to get the sacrifice you got to
[1:37:14] lay it in order
[1:37:15] oh lord i'm waiting on i'm waiting on
[1:37:17] you to come god said what have you been
[1:37:19] doing
[1:37:22] that's with everything
[1:37:24] every promise of god
[1:37:27] but he was fully persuaded that he was
[1:37:29] able
[1:37:30] to perform
[1:37:31] what he said
[1:37:33] but says when you say you believe
[1:37:34] anything then you've got to put it in
[1:37:36] action
[1:37:37] abraham was commanded to separate from
[1:37:38] all and believe and walk with god alone
[1:37:40] and instead of getting weaker he got
[1:37:42] stronger
[1:37:44] when he was a hundred years
[1:37:48] now his physical body didn't get
[1:37:49] stronger
[1:37:50] are you hearing me now
[1:37:52] oh my we just got to preach on it
[1:37:55] his feelings
[1:37:56] did not get stronger
[1:37:59] are you hearing me
[1:38:00] his feelings did not get stronger
[1:38:03] maybe abraham did not have the strength
[1:38:07] to do a praise break for an hour around
[1:38:09] the tent
[1:38:10] maybe the only thing abraham could do he
[1:38:12] got to a spot he could pat his foot and
[1:38:14] say glory to god he's still the same god
[1:38:19] that didn't mean he was weaker
[1:38:22] his body was weak but inside he was
[1:38:25] being built up with the things of god
[1:38:27] there was a building up that was taking
[1:38:29] place because faith is not feelings and
[1:38:32] feelings is not faith
[1:38:37] glory to god
[1:38:39] oh my don't you love him
[1:38:42] oh glory be to god
[1:38:44] that's why brother brown could say that
[1:38:46] ought to be the achievement of every
[1:38:47] believer this afternoon that god is able
[1:38:49] to keep every word that he said that he
[1:38:51] would do
[1:38:53] when we're zeroed in notice when we're
[1:38:55] zeroed in with the word of god
[1:38:57] because the bible says without faith it
[1:38:59] is impossible
[1:39:01] to please god
[1:39:03] it's impossible so faith itself how god
[1:39:06] will come on the scene through his word
[1:39:09] and we've already looked at this of how
[1:39:11] that even paul
[1:39:13] we were speaking about this with moses i
[1:39:14] think early in the service of even how
[1:39:17] that when paul would come
[1:39:19] paul would be able to testify just like
[1:39:21] moses when he would speak there the word
[1:39:24] he was speaking a word that god had
[1:39:27] given to him personally it was
[1:39:29] inspiration that was going out upon the
[1:39:32] lives of the people and that's why paul
[1:39:35] could say that our word our word was not
[1:39:39] yea and nay
[1:39:40] but as god is true our word toward you
[1:39:45] is
[1:39:46] yea
[1:39:47] and amen
[1:39:49] is that right for all the promises in
[1:39:51] him are yea
[1:39:53] and amen now to think of it god coming
[1:39:56] to stimulate our faith
[1:39:58] stir our faith in the promise of god
[1:40:02] that's his grace that's given to us
[1:40:05] and to think of the hour that you and i
[1:40:08] are living in brother branham would make
[1:40:10] this statement like this and i want to
[1:40:13] just i want to come down i want to just
[1:40:14] coast on a couple of these parts here
[1:40:18] we dealt with that of faith faith is a
[1:40:20] common thing every person has faith
[1:40:24] god comes down to stimulate that faith
[1:40:27] and that stimulated faith to believe in
[1:40:30] god then when the holy ghost comes it's
[1:40:33] no longer our faith alone
[1:40:35] it's the faith of god
[1:40:37] inside of us
[1:40:39] moving
[1:40:40] our faith
[1:40:45] so to think of where that we are
[1:40:46] standing here in this hour in this
[1:40:49] ephesians
[1:40:50] brother branham would take from the even
[1:40:52] the examples
[1:40:54] he says
[1:40:55] in order how many times you hear brother
[1:40:57] branham utter this out he says if we
[1:40:59] can't have enough faith for him
[1:41:02] how are we going to have enough faith
[1:41:03] for a rapture
[1:41:05] well let me preach right now because i
[1:41:06] feel it coming let me preach
[1:41:08] when we're talking about divine healing
[1:41:10] we're not talking about you're prayed
[1:41:12] for right here and right away you're
[1:41:13] well
[1:41:15] divine healing is there's a promise of
[1:41:17] god that's been given
[1:41:19] you've been prayed for and you take god
[1:41:21] at his word you stand on that word you
[1:41:24] might feel worse the next day feel worse
[1:41:26] the next week but you're standing on
[1:41:28] god's word
[1:41:30] the second miracle of canaan when the
[1:41:33] man asked jesus to come and jesus said i
[1:41:35] can't go he said he said but i'll speak
[1:41:38] the word talking about the man from
[1:41:39] canaan that ain't the roman nobleman he
[1:41:42] spoke the word and notice as he's on his
[1:41:44] way back home here comes one of the
[1:41:46] servants running and saying hey
[1:41:48] hey
[1:41:50] the servant is healed and what did he
[1:41:52] ask him he asked him the question what
[1:41:54] hour did he begin to amend
[1:41:59] what hour did he begin to amend
[1:42:03] you see the work how healing moves in
[1:42:06] our bodies and a lot of times when it
[1:42:07] doesn't take place right away we'll say
[1:42:09] god didn't hear prayer no we are
[1:42:11] abraham's seed and abraham's seed stands
[1:42:14] on the promise i don't care if it's
[1:42:16] worse the next day it's works next month
[1:42:19] who against hope believe in hope
[1:42:24] that he might become an expression that
[1:42:27] i'm the lord that god that healeth on
[1:42:30] that diseases that he might become that
[1:42:32] i am the lord who bore stripes for your
[1:42:36] healing
[1:42:39] that's what brother brahman says you can
[1:42:40] wiggle a little bit like this you do it
[1:42:44] come on now some of those are you
[1:42:46] wanting the holy ghost don't don't check
[1:42:47] out on me this applies to everything

[1:42:52] egypt keep getting closer keep moving
[1:42:55] closer to the promise you wiggle the
[1:42:57] finger then you're wiggling two fingers
[1:42:59] then you keep on wiggling what's
[1:43:01] happening there's healing taking place
[1:43:03] and eventually you start moving the hand
[1:43:05] then comes the arm then it begins to
[1:43:07] move through the rest of your body
[1:43:12] divine
[1:43:14] healing
[1:43:17] oh my my my my
[1:43:20] glory be to god can't you see how the
[1:43:23] rapture is tied in all through the
[1:43:25] scriptures
[1:43:28] it's a promise of god god who become the
[1:43:31] good work in your soul
[1:43:33] will finish it
[1:43:37] that miracle makes way for the next
[1:43:39] miracle

[1:43:54] down that doubt cast down all

[1:44:08] his face

[1:44:13] go ahead and kick your leg right in his
[1:44:15] face

[1:45:16] it
[1:45:21] hallelujah glory be to god
[1:45:23] oh hallelujah notice this this royal
[1:45:27] seed that's coming on royal seed brother
[1:45:31] iran could stand in this day the
[1:45:33] scriptures fulfilled and say in this day
[1:45:36] there's to come a super royal seed of
[1:45:38] abraham a royal bride to the royal
[1:45:42] promised son it's a spiritual seed
[1:45:45] there's a spiritual bride rising up it
[1:45:48] will be the royal seed of the royal
[1:45:51] faith of abraham's royal son
[1:45:53] she is to come on the scene in the last
[1:45:56] days and the time and place is a promise
[1:46:00] that's given to her
[1:46:02] and god has sent his message to bring us
[1:46:05] and open that place that promise to you
[1:46:08] and i to who to the royal seed of
[1:46:11] abraham
[1:46:13] the royal seed of abraham is not the
[1:46:15] seed that can say look i can prove to
[1:46:17] you my genealogy my that no but the
[1:46:19] royal seed is those that can hear him
[1:46:22] there's something on the inside to hear
[1:46:24] the call there's liberty there's freedom
[1:46:27] there's deliverance not something on the
[1:46:30] outside that says well i was born in the
[1:46:32] message i was raised in a message i know
[1:46:34] the message to be true but there's a
[1:46:36] call that goes to the inside that said
[1:46:39] he who the son makes free is free indeed
[1:46:43] it's a call of liberty
[1:46:47] and that seed on the inside heals it
[1:46:59] jesus said
[1:47:01] if i be lifted up
[1:47:03] from the earth
[1:47:05] i will draw
[1:47:07] all men unto me
[1:47:10] there's no greater drawing power
[1:47:12] than the holy ghost gospel
[1:47:17] if i be lifted up i'll draw all men he's
[1:47:19] still drawing it's having effect jesus
[1:47:22] said no man can come to me except my
[1:47:25] father which sent me draw him and i will
[1:47:28] raise him up at the last day
[1:47:31] there's something drawing you beyond
[1:47:33] your doubts beyond your unbelief i'm
[1:47:36] telling you it's a work of a
[1:47:37] supernatural god that's coming to a
[1:47:40] royal seed of abraham
[1:47:43] this is not your doing it's god working
[1:47:46] in our lives manifesting himself to
[1:47:49] where we finally call out yes lord i see
[1:47:53] it's your desire for me and all i have
[1:47:57] to do
[1:47:59] is surrender
[1:48:08] this is the ephesians
[1:48:10] of this day
[1:48:14] i'm coasting i'm coming
[1:48:16] i'm on that runway i'm
[1:48:20] don't unbuckle yet we might have to
[1:48:24] but we're going to put the tray tables
[1:48:26] out
[1:48:30] this is our ephesians
[1:48:34] to where god has come down
[1:48:36] in this hour
[1:48:38] brother bran would say it in this place
[1:48:40] trying to do god a service he said that
[1:48:42] elijah
[1:48:43] of this day
[1:48:44] is the lord jesus christ
[1:48:50] he said it's not the man but it's god
[1:48:52] coming through
[1:48:54] that office of a prophet
[1:48:56] see others can look think about how the
[1:48:58] scriptures is when they brought the
[1:49:00] greeks to jesus they wanted to see jesus
[1:49:02] they came and they saw nothing but a man
[1:49:06] but faith sees beyond
[1:49:10] faith sees beyond you see the royal seed
[1:49:12] of abraham brother braham tells us when
[1:49:14] those three were coming walking down the
[1:49:15] road in genesis 18 here god is a company
[1:49:18] there were two angels he said as he came
[1:49:19] down he said abraham was stayed in a
[1:49:22] spiritual atmosphere all the time around
[1:49:24] his tent he said abraham was prayed up
[1:49:27] there was he was in an atmosphere and he
[1:49:28] says when abraham saw that man he said
[1:49:31] it was something on the inside of him
[1:49:33] that rang out there's something
[1:49:35] spiritual about this man
[1:49:38] what is it time to perk up and pay
[1:49:40] attention
[1:49:43] and that ministry of the son of man in
[1:49:46] this hour it was made manifest so that
[1:49:49] the pride would come out and be united
[1:49:53] with jesus christ brother random just
[1:49:56] happened to be the vessel a son of man
[1:49:59] revealing the son of man
[1:50:02] we're not united to a son of man we're
[1:50:05] united to the son of man jesus christ
[1:50:09] the word
[1:50:13] god provided a word we could be washed
[1:50:18] washed
[1:50:20] in order to come into service
[1:50:22] and uniting
[1:50:26] we're no longer twain
[1:50:28] abraham why are you making the decisions
[1:50:30] you make him
[1:50:31] because it's a promise i'm holding
[1:50:35] abraham it don't seem like you're as
[1:50:36] careless about your decisions you're
[1:50:37] making anymore
[1:50:39] because i got further away from chaldea
[1:50:42] i'm closer
[1:50:43] i'm nearer to
[1:50:45] to the promise than i've ever been
[1:50:47] you see the closer you get to god
[1:50:51] and you live
[1:50:52] it'll affect your decisions
[1:50:55] it'll affect your decisions
[1:50:57] because listen over the same i'm
[1:50:59] predestinated god don't pull you through
[1:51:01] a pipe
[1:51:02] and let's just get real every decision
[1:51:04] you make is not thus saith the lord
[1:51:07] because we've made some decisions we've
[1:51:09] had to say ouch old me forgive me jesus
[1:51:13] come on church
[1:51:15] that's never you can't pull that in the
[1:51:16] scripture anywhere that those who were
[1:51:18] of the election of god as though that oh
[1:51:21] they don't have choices no more god just
[1:51:23] picks them up like puppets and drags
[1:51:24] them around that's not it at all
[1:51:26] what it is is when they have met god the
[1:51:29] prophet tells us in the message breach
[1:51:32] when you've been redeemed you no longer
[1:51:34] want your own choice
[1:51:37] because christ has been your choice
[1:51:40] and so everything he's the filter of
[1:51:42] your life he's your thinking man's
[1:51:44] filter that every decision that comes
[1:51:46] along things that you allow in your home
[1:51:49] things that you allow for your children
[1:51:51] places you go you filter it through a
[1:51:53] thinking man's filter
[1:51:56] and if you can't make it through a
[1:51:57] thinking man's filter you say
[1:51:59] sorry can't do it it's been filtered by
[1:52:03] the word
[1:52:05] that's why the word it can't be just
[1:52:07] filtered by a letter
[1:52:09] it's got to be an active filter
[1:52:12] it's got to be an active filter
[1:52:14] that active filter within our life the
[1:52:16] only thing that can come down in there
[1:52:18] is pure holy ghost
[1:52:20] pure god
[1:52:22] so decisions and things in our life
[1:52:24] it'll affect decisions
[1:52:26] that we make
[1:52:28] in our life
[1:52:34] i think that this is why in a time
[1:52:37] we're warned by the scripture
[1:52:39] as every believer has been down through
[1:52:41] time
[1:52:42] watch
[1:52:44] and pray
[1:52:48] because why
[1:52:49] you don't watch with these eyes
[1:52:52] it's spiritual eyes that are open
[1:52:56] and prayer is the radar of the believer
[1:53:00] it catches things that are coming up
[1:53:03] that are not even seen yet
[1:53:07] are you hearing me now i'm not just
[1:53:09] talking about the rapture i'm talking
[1:53:11] about the holy ghost i'm talking about
[1:53:13] healing i'm talking about deliverance
[1:53:14] i'm talking about every promise in your
[1:53:16] life where you begin to pray for things
[1:53:18] that is right before you what's
[1:53:20] happening there's a radar that's going
[1:53:22] out that i know the promise is mine
[1:53:24] i'm praying for it brother graham said
[1:53:25] you want to know the direction the
[1:53:26] church is headed you listen to how
[1:53:28] they're praying
[1:53:30] because how they're praying will tell
[1:53:31] you the direction they're headed
[1:53:34] oh well what's coming up oh i i see i i
[1:53:37] see god factories i see abraham you
[1:53:40] shouldn't be seeing god factories
[1:53:43] did you do did you make a u-turn abraham
[1:53:47] well you're right god brought me out of
[1:53:49] that i shouldn't be back there looking
[1:53:50] at that
[1:53:52] hello i shouldn't be back in those same
[1:53:54] things come on friends things that were
[1:53:56] traps before in your own life hear me
[1:53:58] now things that were trapped in your own
[1:54:00] life you have to reign over that because
[1:54:03] just to tell you your children didn't
[1:54:05] come from somebody else
[1:54:08] hello i'm getting right down on the road
[1:54:10] now
[1:54:11] the same traps and that's why you have
[1:54:13] to be very mindful i don't want to go
[1:54:15] back here does every one of our children
[1:54:17] have to have a fresh experience they all
[1:54:19] have to have a fresh experience but they
[1:54:21] don't have to start in the house of the
[1:54:23] god maker
[1:54:25] come on church
[1:54:27] we're in this trip we ought to be
[1:54:28] distanced between us and them
[1:54:31] our homes our children we're going to be
[1:54:33] getting closer to god not further from
[1:54:35] god
[1:54:36] closer to god we're nearer than we've
[1:54:39] ever been before
[1:54:41] are you hearing me

[1:55:45] and as the tray table's up
[1:55:49] let that washing of water by the word
[1:55:51] come on down there and collect all the
[1:55:52] trash

[1:56:09] pretzels in it you don't walk out of

[1:56:14] for landing let's let you know put it up
[1:56:18] there's somebody coming down the hill to
[1:56:19] collect trash
[1:56:21] i'm telling you right now the almighty
[1:56:24] god is walking down the aisles he's
[1:56:26] moving down through every heart and
[1:56:28] every life he said you've got any faith
[1:56:30] that you don't want to carry no more put
[1:56:32] it in here
[1:56:34] put it in here put it in the blood
[1:56:36] because it's time departure it's almost
[1:56:40] time
[1:56:48] here's abraham
[1:56:53] coming to the gate
[1:56:55] taxing
[1:57:01] when we look up
[1:57:05] we see
[1:57:07] a mountain
[1:57:10] and it's a mountain
[1:57:12] that god spoke to abraham about
[1:57:17] i've heard of thee
[1:57:19] by the hearing of my ears
[1:57:21] but now i see thee
[1:57:24] his faith is becoming sight
[1:57:29] god has asked him take
[1:57:32] that only son
[1:57:34] notice god never
[1:57:36] said
[1:57:37] one of your boys
[1:57:39] god said that one that's your doing
[1:57:41] that ain't mine
[1:57:44] but you take your only son
[1:57:46] and you go offer him up
[1:57:49] what's god looking for
[1:57:51] will you fully obey me let's say i
[1:57:53] thought god i thought abraham had fully
[1:57:55] obeyed him
[1:57:56] you ever notice how brother brahma will
[1:57:57] bring this in the message
[1:57:59] abraham walks out of chaldea and he says
[1:58:02] when abraham fully obeyed him
[1:58:04] god said here's the land that i was
[1:58:05] talking to you about
[1:58:08] then you don't see god show up
[1:58:10] then here comes the separation of life
[1:58:12] brother braham says when abraham fully
[1:58:14] obeyed him then here god shows up.
[1:58:17] how is how is he saying when he fully
[1:58:18] obeyed walk
[1:58:21] in the light
[1:58:23] as he's in the light
[1:58:25] step by step
[1:58:27] i won't even try to jump
[1:58:29] i know better than that
[1:58:31] you don't jump in god
[1:58:34] you walk
[1:58:36] because you know what every step
[1:58:38] it's positioned
[1:58:40] it's planted
[1:58:42] it's faith
[1:58:43] in the word of god wonder what believing
[1:58:45] is believing is faith in action well
[1:58:49] brother samuel i don't feel nothing yet
[1:58:51] come on mary was a type of the royal
[1:58:53] seed right
[1:58:54] mary didn't feel nothing
[1:58:56] brother brown said she was positive
[1:58:58] before she was positive
[1:59:04] how could she be positive before she's
[1:59:06] positive because she'd have a positive
[1:59:08] experience by a positive god who gave a
[1:59:11] positive promise
[1:59:13] so she was
[1:59:14] positive do you feel anything no but
[1:59:17] god's already said it he said i was the
[1:59:19] one that isaiah spoke of
[1:59:21] it's so real in my heart oh i had
[1:59:23] questions sure i had questions how can
[1:59:25] it be me
[1:59:27] me
[1:59:28] and even the devil told her brother
[1:59:29] braham goes and spoken words are
[1:59:30] regional see the devil he said came over
[1:59:32] to mary and said
[1:59:33] you
[1:59:34] you think you think you're the one you
[1:59:36] ain't nothing but an 18 year old girl
[1:59:41] but she said you know what this is my
[1:59:44] brother and brother brown breaking into
[1:59:45] a conversation
[1:59:46] she said but my mama and
[1:59:49] she sold that seed in me when i was just
[1:59:51] a little girl and god has come and
[1:59:53] vindicated that seed to me
[1:59:56] i've heard about the message
[1:59:59] i've heard about god i've known that
[2:00:01] it's for me i know that the promise is
[2:00:04] for me but now i see god speaking
[2:00:07] personally to my life
[2:00:12] glory be to god in the highest
[2:00:15] i tell you
[2:00:16] here's abraham standing there
[2:00:21] abraham takes isaac up there
[2:00:24] now you notice this
[2:00:26] it wasn't enough just for him to come to
[2:00:28] that mountain and say and god said oh
[2:00:31] that's all you got to do abraham
[2:00:33] you i see already you you fully obey me
[2:00:36] that ain't what god said do
[2:00:40] on now god just didn't say come come to
[2:00:41] a church
[2:00:44] oh i i believe that god didn't just say
[2:00:46] just when you say i believe the message
[2:00:48] no no
[2:00:50] but you to go up there
[2:00:52] and take
[2:00:54] thine only son
[2:00:56] that which you love the most
[2:00:58] and it'd be a sacrifice
[2:01:02] i've shown what i spoke to you now
[2:01:04] here's the way
[2:01:06] abraham could walk up there
[2:01:09] isaac asking him a question
[2:01:12] you talking about god was in the camp
[2:01:17] let me remind you what isaac's age was
[2:01:20] 17 years old
[2:01:25] and isaac said daddy
[2:01:26] now listen brother brown went through
[2:01:28] things with his children he told us in
[2:01:29] the message indictment because you've
[2:01:31] got to suffer with them through those
[2:01:32] ages
[2:01:33] is that right a lot of counsel was given
[2:01:34] all the way through these but look
[2:01:36] look the presence of god
[2:01:39] and isaac could say daddy
[2:01:41] hey
[2:01:42] i i see all this wood we got but where's
[2:01:45] the sacrifice
[2:01:48] you see that's a question of
[2:01:51] because isaac can't see it
[2:01:55] but abraham's faith says
[2:01:57] my son
[2:01:59] god
[2:02:00] will provide
[2:02:02] himself
[2:02:03] a sacrifice
[2:02:06] abraham what are you doing i'm doing
[2:02:08] exactly what he told me to do because if
[2:02:10] i do all that he has said do
[2:02:13] he'll come
[2:02:15] he'll come if i do all that he said do
[2:02:19] the holy ghost comes the bible said he
[2:02:22] gives the holy ghost to them that obey
[2:02:25] him
[2:02:27] you might have things in your room at
[2:02:29] home you might have things in your car
[2:02:31] you might have things there that you can
[2:02:33] say oh i got to go clear them out if you
[2:02:35] fully obey from your heart right now and
[2:02:38] the holy ghost comes brother you don't
[2:02:40] have to worry about your car you don't
[2:02:42] have to worry about your music you don't
[2:02:44] got to worry about what's on the phone
[2:02:46] you don't got to worry about what's back
[2:02:47] at home in the room or in the apartment
[2:02:49] you've dealt with what needs to be dealt
[2:02:52] with
[2:02:53] and it'll show itself
[2:02:56] anybody hear what i'm saying
[2:03:01] abraham
[2:03:05] so abraham
[2:03:07] here he is listen you talk about the
[2:03:09] effect in a home
[2:03:11] you're talking about the effect in a
[2:03:12] home
[2:03:13] of just being under obedience of the
[2:03:15] word of god you talk about the stability
[2:03:18] of being on oh brother samuel if
[2:03:19] something no no no you and me both
[2:03:23] being under the stability of the word
[2:03:25] look look what it did by abraham walking
[2:03:28] in obedience it invited the presence of
[2:03:31] god
[2:03:32] an atmosphere
[2:03:34] my brother ram tells us in the token
[2:03:37] you create that atmosphere
[2:03:39] with the love
[2:03:40] and consideration for your loved ones
[2:03:42] and atmosphere
[2:03:43] that they
[2:03:45] will fall into it
[2:03:49] because it's the creative power
[2:03:51] of almighty god
[2:03:55] and here was abraham
[2:03:57] daddy where's that sacrifice
[2:04:03] i can borrow you
[2:04:07] just having me tie his hands with him in
[2:04:09] front back i don't know
[2:04:12] it was abraham
[2:04:15] what he loved
[2:04:17] the most
[2:04:20] he was asked to surrender into the hands
[2:04:23] of god completely what he loved the most
[2:04:30] can you see calvary
[2:04:31] can you see calvary
[2:04:33] can you see your own personal calvary
[2:04:38] and here the atmosphere the anointing
[2:04:40] that's upon it it wasn't the lamb it
[2:04:43] wasn't him kicking and screaming and
[2:04:44] pulling you you and i can't even think
[2:04:46] of anything man my son or my daughter
[2:04:48] they'd be screaming they'd be crying
[2:04:49] they'd be this they'd be there it was
[2:04:51] listen it wasn't genetics it wasn't
[2:04:54] human genetics
[2:04:57] it was the presence of god that came
[2:05:02] because of obedience
[2:05:04] to the word of god
[2:05:06] the token comes
[2:05:08] when there's full obedience
[2:05:12] that's why in everything we do apply the
[2:05:14] token
[2:05:18] and
[2:05:19] he brought isaac
[2:05:20] and i laid isaac down on that altar can
[2:05:22] you read a minute lay down right here
[2:05:24] would you
[2:05:29] we're doing this up good
[2:05:39] brother brahm tells us
[2:05:42] that they had went up there that
[2:05:44] started out remember it was a journey to
[2:05:46] get there
[2:05:47] he said abraham set the alarm clock to
[2:05:49] get up early before sarah ever stirred
[2:05:51] he wasn't going to tell sarah about it
[2:05:53] because sarah would have said you're not
[2:05:55] going to do that
[2:05:56] you say who is sarah brother branham
[2:05:58] identified that sarah in our life
[2:06:00] as job's wife that spoke like a foolish
[2:06:03] woman
[2:06:06] and i've heard by now i see he
[2:06:08] identifies it he said deny what that
[2:06:10] foolish woman is saying and believe what
[2:06:12] god is calling you to do
[2:06:14] see how the type applies it follows into
[2:06:16] that and brother bam says here abraham
[2:06:18] came into this place
[2:06:22] takes his knife
[2:06:25] but you know what
[2:06:27] he already abraham had already testified
[2:06:31] to those men that were at the bottom of
[2:06:33] the hill
[2:06:35] he said i am the lad
[2:06:37] we're going to go up there and worship
[2:06:39] and we'll be back
[2:06:41] we're coming back down how's that gonna
[2:06:44] happen i don't know
[2:06:46] but god gave the promise and god can't
[2:06:48] fail he said he would bless me through
[2:06:51] that seed
[2:06:52] i don't know how he's gonna do it but i
[2:06:54] know one thing i'm gonna be walking back
[2:06:56] off there because that isaac is not
[2:06:59] man's doing
[2:07:00] you didn't put that in your life you
[2:07:02] didn't put that desire there god put
[2:07:05] that desire there sunday school didn't
[2:07:07] put it there mama didn't put it there
[2:07:09] daddy didn't put it there god put that
[2:07:12] desire on the inside
[2:07:17] and that buzzer is going off brother
[2:07:18] bram called it a buzzer what's going off
[2:07:21] oh no
[2:07:22] what's sarah going to say about this or
[2:07:24] she finds out what's going to happen now
[2:07:27] that buzzer brother i'm saying satan
[2:07:29] coming up
[2:07:31] and trying to tempt him
[2:07:33] and here
[2:07:35] abraham is saying
[2:07:37] i love you
[2:07:40] and abraham has his knife right here
[2:07:45] and then abraham says
[2:07:46] he takes at night and when he gets here
[2:07:49] that's full obedience
[2:07:50] full obedience even though he was on the
[2:07:53] altar had his knife out that wasn't full
[2:07:55] obedience
[2:07:57] brother braham says when his hand was in
[2:07:59] the air
[2:08:00] and the angel of the lord came and
[2:08:01] caught his hand
[2:08:02] stay thy hand abraham for now i know
[2:08:06] that thou lovest me
[2:08:10] more
[2:08:11] than thine only son
[2:08:13] what do we see from here
[2:08:15] do all
[2:08:17] that he says
[2:08:18] for you to do
[2:08:21] but i thought i'm the surrender
[2:08:23] that is you surrendering
[2:08:25] surrendering is not just setting down on
[2:08:27] the pew and just
[2:08:32] friends i'm sorry i can only give
[2:08:34] examples as he gives them to me that
[2:08:35] ain't surrendering
[2:08:37] surrendering is what he's told us to do
[2:08:40] it don't line up with my thinking he
[2:08:42] don't line up with my ideas but my
[2:08:44] surrendering is what he said i'm going
[2:08:46] to do it i don't have to make sense to
[2:08:47] me that didn't make sense to abraham
[2:08:52] it didn't make sense to him
[2:08:55] but he surrendered his own ideas and
[2:08:58] what happened
[2:08:59] he walked off the mountain
[2:09:02] about that time
[2:09:04] man
[2:09:08] there was no ram up there before
[2:09:11] abraham had built an altar there wasn't
[2:09:13] no ram there before
[2:09:15] but because he walked in obedience here
[2:09:17] came the miracle
[2:09:19] here came the paradox on the scene
[2:09:21] because he walked in obedience to god
[2:09:24] you want to see the paradox of the holy
[2:09:25] ghost you walk in obedience to the word
[2:09:27] of god you want to see a paradox of
[2:09:29] healing a paradox of deliverance you
[2:09:31] walk in obedience to the word of god
[2:09:33] come on son
[2:09:35] and god will perform his word just like
[2:09:38] he said he would
[2:09:41] so surrendering is
[2:09:43] i don't understand it but this is what
[2:09:44] god said do
[2:09:47] and he's big enough i don't have to make
[2:09:49] sense to me i just have to trust him
[2:09:51] there's things that god will ask us and
[2:09:53] he does continually ask us and things
[2:09:55] that ask him to trust him and you know
[2:09:57] what finally there's times that we can
[2:09:59] get in our life and god says you're
[2:10:00] tired enough yet well lord i've just
[2:10:02] been trying to make the promise come to
[2:10:03] pass god said are you tired yet well
[2:10:05] lord i'm just trying are you tired yet
[2:10:06] well i'm just trying god said
[2:10:09] that's a problem
[2:10:10] you're trying
[2:10:12] you can't save your children
[2:10:14] you can't save your husband you can't
[2:10:16] save your wife can't save your grandma
[2:10:17] your grandpa but what you can do is
[2:10:19] there can be such an atmosphere of the
[2:10:21] token life created around where your
[2:10:23] life is so surrendered and there's a

[2:14:29] said
[2:14:30] thy seed
[2:14:32] shall possess the gates of thine enemies
[2:14:35] god

[2:14:39] an oath of confirmation
[2:14:43] it was it
[2:14:44] there's nothing can rise against it you
[2:14:47] see what god was showing in the evening

[2:28:45] paul would look and see the athletes
[2:28:47] training in the olympics and he would
[2:28:49] say let us run this race
[2:28:52] he would look at that example and say
[2:28:54] a man is not crowned except he's tried
[2:28:56] lawfully
[2:28:58] he would go on to say i fight not as one
[2:29:01] that beat a fear
[2:29:02] he would take examples that the people
[2:29:05] lord would be able to relate to you
[2:29:07] inspired those examples to him lord oh
[2:29:10] god that's your love and mercy to us
[2:29:12] lord
[2:29:14] trying to get it across to us thank you
[2:29:16] lord

[2:29:33] but my faith
[2:29:34] has feed on it

[2:29:42] glory be to god
[2:29:44] hallelujah
[2:29:46] lord is the example you gave in the big
[2:29:48] beginning about that hurricane
[2:29:50] lord like god like brother carlos would
[2:29:52] prepare around his home when he lived in
[2:29:54] florida he would go buy that osb plywood
[2:29:57] whatever they could get their hands on
[2:30:00] him and others down there

[2:30:03] plywood
[2:30:05] lord god you've given us direction in
[2:30:07] your word
[2:30:08] we surrender our own ideas
[2:30:12] i've often thought about it my goodness
[2:30:14] they're screwing that osb into their
[2:30:16] siding screwing it into these other
[2:30:18] things but you know what lord that just
[2:30:20] just how it is even spiritually there's
[2:30:22] things that you asked us to do it don't
[2:30:24] make sense to our natural mind
[2:30:28] it didn't make sense that they would
[2:30:30] come to the red sea
[2:30:32] but what didn't make sense to them
[2:30:35] and what brought scoffing from pharaoh
[2:30:38] was an opportunity as your prophet told
[2:30:41] us for you to flex your muscles
