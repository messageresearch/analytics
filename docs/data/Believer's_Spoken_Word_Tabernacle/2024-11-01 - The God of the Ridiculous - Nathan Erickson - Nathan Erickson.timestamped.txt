[34:06] want to be a help along the way tonight
[34:08] I want to say God bless you amen now
[34:11] don't want to keep you tonight we'll
[34:12] just go ahead and go right to the word
[34:13] of God in uh 1 Corinthians chapter
[34:19] 1 kind of walking down some old Trails
[34:21] tonight and uh got a little bit of some
[34:25] fresh material hope that's all right try
[34:27] a a little fresh material out on you you
[34:29] know the thing about when it's fresh
[34:31] sometimes it's a little raw amen but
[34:33] we're just looking for the Lord to put
[34:34] something together here uh I've just had
[34:37] it kind of percolating for a little
[34:38] while and uh and so uh just some
[34:43] precious things to me from the word of
[34:45] God trust and we'll be an encouragement
[34:47] tonight amen 1 Corinthians chapter 1 I'm
[34:50] going to start at Verse 18 just read
[34:52] down to the end
[34:56] there and uh this is this is maybe one
[34:59] of my favorite chapters in The Bible 1
[35:01] Corinthians chapter 1 Paul says here for
[35:04] the preaching of the Cross is to them
[35:06] that perish
[35:08] foolishness but unto us which are saved
[35:11] it is the power of God Amen for it is
[35:14] written I will destroy the wisdom of the
[35:17] wise and will bring to nothing the
[35:19] understanding of the prudent so where is
[35:21] the wise where is the Scribe and where
[35:24] is the disputer of this world hath not
[35:27] God made made foolish the wisdom of this
[35:30] world for after that in the wisdom of
[35:33] God the World by wisdom knew not God so
[35:36] in other words the world has no approach
[35:39] to God through human wisdom carnal
[35:42] reasonings mental conceptions and that
[35:44] is the wisdom of God that it's that way
[35:47] amen so it's not the right approach by
[35:49] wisdom but it pleased God My My by the
[35:53] foolishness of preaching you talk about
[35:55] this is about the only way I could get
[35:56] courage to stand behind In a Pulpit amen
[35:59] is for Paul to acknowledge that by the
[36:01] foolishness of preaching God Saves them
[36:04] that believe how many how many Believers
[36:06] are in the house tonight amen how many
[36:09] are looking for his salvation amen it
[36:11] comes in many forms of healing of
[36:13] encouragement of of provision but uh
[36:16] whatever trouble we're in he's the one
[36:18] who needs to save us from all of our
[36:19] troubles amen and so that's why we
[36:22] gather together and we hear the
[36:23] preaching of the word because it becomes
[36:25] power of Salvation even though it's
[36:27] quite a foolish thing Amen to to to look
[36:30] at from the outside for the Jews require
[36:32] a sign verse 22 and the Greeks seek
[36:35] after wisdom but we preach Christ
[36:39] crucified unto the Jews he's a stumbling
[36:42] block unto the Greeks he's foolishness
[36:46] but unto them which are called both Jew
[36:48] and Greek he's Christ he's the power of
[36:51] God and he's the wisdom of God because
[36:54] the foolishness of God
[36:57] amen you know that God is foolish amen
[37:00] the foolishness of God is wiser than men
[37:02] and the weakness of God is stronger than
[37:04] men for you see your calling Brethren
[37:07] not many wise men after the flesh are
[37:09] called I would I'm I'm not one either
[37:11] not many mighty not many noble are
[37:14] called but God hath chosen the foolish
[37:17] things of this world to confound the
[37:19] wise and God hath chosen the weak things
[37:22] of the world to confound the things
[37:23] which are Mighty and base things or
[37:26] lowly things of of the world and things
[37:28] which are despised hath God chosen oh my
[37:32] and things which are not to bring to not
[37:35] things that are amen and here's the
[37:38] reason why church that no flesh no flesh
[37:42] no flesh should glory in his presence
[37:46] amen but of him are you in Christ Jesus
[37:50] who of God is made unto us wisdom watch
[37:53] these labels now he's wisdom he's
[37:56] righteousness he sanctification and he's
[37:59] Redemption to us amen it's of him that
[38:02] we are in Christ and because we're in
[38:05] Christ he's our wisdom he's our
[38:06] righteousness he's our sanctifier and
[38:09] Our Redeemer that according as it is
[38:11] written he that glorieth let him glory
[38:13] in the Lord amen let's pray before we
[38:16] get to preaching here tonight Lord uh we
[38:19] want to glory in you tonight father we
[38:22] want to give you all the glory Lord we
[38:24] we look at ourselves father and and
[38:26] we're very very aware of the foolishness
[38:29] of this flesh Lord the foolishness Lord
[38:32] of who we are and to think Lord that
[38:35] that we could even have faith to believe
[38:37] that we are a people that are possessors
[38:39] of Christ Lord of his Redemption of his
[38:42] power Lord when we look from the outside
[38:44] Lord it looks so foolish and yet Lord
[38:47] your word tells us that you chose those
[38:49] foolish things to bring to not Lord
[38:51] things which are Lord I I feel foolish
[38:54] Lord as a minister Lord to think that I
[38:57] could could help your people Lord with
[38:59] any of my human abilities father but
[39:01] Lord I thankful tonight that it's not
[39:04] our human abilities that we're looking
[39:05] at father but we're looking to your
[39:07] grace Lord we're asking that you Lord
[39:09] would come amongst us by your spirit
[39:11] tonight set our Humanity aside father I
[39:14] pray that you'd anoint these lips to
[39:15] speak your word and anoint also the ears
[39:17] of the hearer to hear father that Lord
[39:20] things of Eternal value Lord uh uh
[39:22] encouragement Lord could be brought
[39:25] along the way I pray that Lord you would
[39:27] strength in your people tonight by the
[39:28] word in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[39:32] amen the foolishness of God I'd like to
[39:35] preach tonight you may be seated like to
[39:37] preach tonight uh I would title it the
[39:40] god of the
[39:41] ridiculous amen the god the god of the
[39:45] ridiculous he is the god of the
[39:47] ridiculous brother brandom in the
[39:49] message led by the spirit of God he said
[39:51] when you've got the Holy Ghost leading
[39:52] you the Holy Ghost will lead you in some
[39:55] of the most ridiculous things that the
[39:57] world ever looked at amen and it'll make
[40:00] you do the most ridiculous things that
[40:03] the world ever thought about he said if
[40:05] you're in the if you're in the upper
[40:06] room you're going to be counted a little
[40:08] bit off you're just a little bit off if
[40:10] you ever been in the upper room you're
[40:11] going to be a little bit off to the
[40:12] people down in the lower levels amen
[40:15] because uh because that that's who we
[40:17] are as children of God there are many
[40:19] many scriptures dealing with the fact
[40:20] that if you're a Believer if you're a if
[40:23] you're a child of God you're not going
[40:25] to be a person that is going to be
[40:27] accept accepted by the world you're not
[40:28] going to be looked by at the world uh uh
[40:31] you're not going to be looked at by the
[40:33] world as normal you're not going to be
[40:35] perceived uh you you'll be an oddball
[40:37] brother Brandon preached a couple
[40:39] messages on that you're going to be
[40:40] you're going to be a Mystic you're going
[40:42] to be somebody uh uh uh and your whole
[40:45] lifestyle your whole attitude your whole
[40:47] mindset is going to be foreign to the
[40:49] people of the world to the point that
[40:51] you'll be looked at as foolish amen uh
[40:54] uh there there are you know there are
[40:55] certain people that respect us for
[40:57] Christianity but on some level anybody
[40:59] who's not a Believer can't quite
[41:01] understand where we're at amen because
[41:04] uh because there's so many things about
[41:05] what we believe uh uh the uh uh there
[41:09] our attitude our bearing as children of
[41:11] God we bear ourselves in a way uh uh
[41:14] like the like the like the son of a king
[41:16] even when he was a slave he had a
[41:17] certain attitude amen where he didn't
[41:19] act like everybody else but see the the
[41:21] thing about that story is he was in the
[41:23] same condition and so people of the
[41:25] world look at us and they see that we're
[41:27] going through the same kind of struggles
[41:29] we've got the same kind of issues and
[41:31] challenges and uh we're subject to the
[41:33] same diseases we're subject to this uh
[41:36] the the the same lack and the same you
[41:38] know and the same problems that and the
[41:41] same pressures brother Bram said whether
[41:43] you're a sinner or a saint you're under
[41:45] pressure right it just because of the
[41:47] environment that we live in so what is
[41:48] it about us that's different the world
[41:50] can't get a hold of that amen and to and
[41:52] to the world it'll always look
[41:54] ridiculous it'll always look ridiculous
[41:57] and if you're thinking in just your
[41:58] carnal human mindset uh the the the way
[42:01] to approach God or the things that God
[42:03] does through his children is always
[42:05] ridiculous so we want to preach tonight
[42:07] on the god of the ridiculous now brother
[42:09] Brandon being the master Storyteller he
[42:10] would say he would say now you want to
[42:12] talk about something ridiculous let's
[42:15] look at and he Paints the picture look
[42:17] look coming down across the hill here
[42:19] now one beautiful morning when the sun's
[42:21] rising and the birds are whistling and
[42:23] here comes an old man 80 years old
[42:27] 80-year-old man whiskers flying this way
[42:29] and white hair bushing behind him
[42:31] leading a little old meal with a wife
[42:33] setting a straddle with a young one on
[42:35] each hip a crooked stick in his hand and
[42:37] here he goes where you going Moses I'm
[42:40] going down to Egypt to take
[42:42] over a oneman Invasion going to Egypt
[42:46] brother Bram said you talk about
[42:47] ridiculous but you see that's the way it
[42:49] is with God when God reveals himself to
[42:52] an individual amen they go out and they
[42:54] begin to do the ridiculous because uh
[42:57] because once faith is Anointed it
[42:59] doesn't look at the circumstances it
[43:00] just looks at the calling it looks at
[43:02] the drive that's on the inside and I got
[43:04] to think about Moses you know to uh uh
[43:07] uh just think about that fact for a
[43:08] moment that Moses here he's going down a
[43:11] a ridiculous sight a one man invasion of
[43:14] the greatest Empire of the time Moses
[43:16] going down to be the deliverer and bring
[43:19] the children of Israel out of Egypt one
[43:21] man an old man at the age of 80 years
[43:24] old and at 80 years old now you you can
[43:27] look down through his life and his life
[43:29] uh was not was not like a highlight reel
[43:31] of successes his whole past life the
[43:34] first 80 years of his life from from
[43:37] birth to 80 amen was a lifetime of
[43:40] failure he had amen you got to
[43:43] understand that Moses uh he had fallen
[43:45] so short he had become so disappointed
[43:48] he was in a state where he was so
[43:50] discouraged until you just run away from
[43:52] it all and he's living out in the
[43:53] wilderness somewhere and you got to
[43:55] understand this about Moses that Moses
[43:57] was a failure but it wasn't the kind of
[43:59] failure that had never tried it wasn't
[44:01] kind of he wasn't the kind of failure
[44:03] who had never attempted Amen to do what
[44:06] he was called to do but he actually had
[44:08] tried it and it didn't work out and so
[44:11] this is somebody amen this is that kind
[44:13] of a failure this is somebody who's
[44:14] known that kind of a humiliation that he
[44:16] was raised to believe that he had a
[44:18] certain calling in his life and every
[44:20] time he put his hand forth to do
[44:22] something about it it it it didn't work
[44:24] out now you and I sometimes feel like a
[44:26] failure here amen but you I don't know
[44:28] if there's anybody even in here who's
[44:30] who's uh who's reach 80 years old but we
[44:33] got to take a little comfort for Moses
[44:35] here amen because a lot of us have tried
[44:37] and we failed right oh brother brother
[44:39] Bill well you're not a failure brother
[44:41] Bill amen but there's a lot of kind of
[44:44] people amen who who who have lived a
[44:46] long time and been Christians a long
[44:48] time and are still feeling like they're
[44:51] a failure feeling like they never got
[44:53] anywhere and that's what kind of the
[44:54] story of Moses is addressing for us and
[44:57] amen is that Moses it wasn't that he
[44:58] hadn't tried it was that he did try and
[45:01] it didn't work amen and that that's kind
[45:03] of a beautiful thing because you're
[45:05] looking at a picture of a man who who
[45:07] who was proven he was weak it wasn't
[45:09] just that he felt weak he was proven to
[45:11] be weak brother brandom taught that he
[45:13] was seven different kinds of weak in
[45:15] perfect strength by Perfect weakness
[45:17] brother Brandon will run through six of
[45:18] them he's seven different kinds brother
[45:20] brand said of weak seven different kinds
[45:22] of week amen amen and so here he is the
[45:25] first 80 years of his life that was as
[45:27] far as he got was to be a failure amen
[45:30] seven different kinds of weak amen had
[45:32] tried and it didn't work out amen but
[45:34] you realize the beautiful thing about
[45:35] the story of Moses is those first 80
[45:37] years of his life was all backstory it
[45:40] was all backstory brother and sister
[45:42] amen because he was the one man Invader
[45:44] he was the Redeemer of the of the uh he
[45:47] was the deliverer and he was the one
[45:49] that was called to bring the children of
[45:50] Israel out amen so it didn't matter if
[45:53] he tried and it didn't work it didn't
[45:54] matter if he had been humiliated it
[45:56] didn't matter what kind of water had
[45:58] gone under the bridge at 80 years old
[46:01] that was all backstory and it was time
[46:03] for Moses to go do the ridiculous at 80
[46:05] years old he had never gone he had never
[46:08] C he never parted the waters he never
[46:10] brought water out of the rock he never
[46:12] called Mana Out of Heaven amen he'd
[46:14] never he never met God on Mount Si he
[46:17] never called 10 plagues out of e out of
[46:19] out of Heaven onto Egypt he'd never done
[46:21] any of that amen so how ridiculous must
[46:24] it have been Amen to look at a man who
[46:27] as far as Society knew as far as his
[46:29] family knew as far as Moses knew he was
[46:32] an old failure of a runaway Shepherd
[46:34] amen from the middle of nowhere who
[46:36] tried and it didn't wake out that's
[46:38] pretty ridiculous brother sister amen
[46:40] but the thing about a calling of God it
[46:42] doesn't matter how many times you've
[46:43] tried it doesn't matter how many times
[46:45] it didn't work out amen if God has got a
[46:48] calling on your life if he's got a
[46:50] purpose for you amen he's going to get
[46:52] the job done and everything else is
[46:55] backstory
[46:56] hallelujah amen so maybe maybe if Moses
[47:00] here amen had all of these things even
[47:02] at 80 years old all these things yet
[47:04] laying before him maybe you've still got
[47:06] a future tonight thank you Lord maybe
[47:08] you've still got a future maybe you
[47:10] tried and you failed you've been
[47:12] humiliated you got the devil whispering
[47:14] in your ear amen you feel like a dead
[47:16] End Amen but friends I'm here to tell
[47:18] you tonight amen it start it's time to
[47:21] start thinking ridiculous amen cuz if
[47:23] you're a child of God you've got a
[47:25] future you've got potential
[47:27] amen you've got you've got the
[47:29] attributes in you amen which sometimes
[47:32] take a long time to get brought out of
[47:34] you a lot of times all that backstory is
[47:36] necessary because the first part of the
[47:38] process is getting the pride out of your
[47:41] own
[47:42] humanity and embrace the ridiculous
[47:45] brother R said there's so many of us
[47:46] that like to
[47:47] testify or we like to think that we're
[47:50] insufficient and therefore we make that
[47:52] an excuse true amen who who so how many
[47:56] believe that we're insufficient it's
[47:58] true we are insufficient but brother man
[48:00] said we make that an excuse we make it
[48:03] an excuse we say well you know I'm weak
[48:06] and I'm insufficient and I lack the
[48:08] ability of course you do amen but that's
[48:11] no excuse it's no excuse Amen to believe
[48:14] that God can't use you it's no excuse to
[48:16] believe that God can't move in your
[48:18] situation just because we're weak amen
[48:21] cuz he was never relying on us in the
[48:23] first place but we make it an excuse
[48:25] brother BR said we'll say oh I have no
[48:27] education or I have no ability I'm
[48:29] unable to do this and if you keep up and
[48:31] do that in that way if you keep going
[48:33] like that brother brand said you can't
[48:35] amount to
[48:36] anything but the very thing that we make
[48:39] excuses by our weaknesses God uses that
[48:44] very thing to tackle the job with amen
[48:47] he waits for us he waits for us to get
[48:49] to that condition now it takes a little
[48:51] while amen we make him wait a little
[48:53] while sometimes amen cuz our first
[48:56] instinct is here beings is to go out and
[48:57] make something happen on our own amen it
[49:00] took 80 years to get that out of Moses
[49:02] amen but God will wait for us Amen to
[49:04] get to the condition amen where he can
[49:07] use us we take excuses and say I can't
[49:09] do it I'm I'm insufficient and God he
[49:12] takes that very thing to do the job with
[49:14] that's the reason oh my that's the
[49:17] reason why he chooses us because we're
[49:20] in that condition because we're in that
[49:23] condition now so many times brother and
[49:25] sister we're guilty amen of
[49:27] acknowledging the weaknesses of our self
[49:29] and then we use that as an excuse why
[49:32] God can't do anything in us or through
[49:34] us but brother sister that's the exact
[49:37] condition that he's looking for because
[49:38] the word of God will tell us his
[49:40] strength can only be made perfect
[49:42] through weakness cuz if we were so
[49:44] strong amen then he couldn't get the
[49:46] glory but God is looking for weak
[49:48] Christians if there's a weak Christian
[49:50] in the building tonight God is looking
[49:52] for weakness amen that he can bring his
[49:54] strength on the scene and glorify
[49:56] himself amen because he can do something
[49:59] that's impossible for you to do and he
[50:01] can cause you to live amen at a level
[50:03] that would be impossible for you to live
[50:05] amen he waits for us to get to that
[50:08] condition then he can use us amen and
[50:11] we're always guilty of flipping on its
[50:13] head and making excuses out of weakness
[50:15] when that's the Avenue God wants to work
[50:17] through and we're always in our
[50:18] religious way trying to present god with
[50:21] strength when he is waiting for us to
[50:23] come to the condition of weakness
[50:26] looking for that humility he's looking
[50:28] for that failure amen so that he can
[50:30] come in amen and show himself
[50:33] strong God does not share his glory with
[50:36] human beings amen God is not the story
[50:39] that's going to be told on the other
[50:40] side is not a story about how a mighty
[50:42] God Amen got in touch with a mighty
[50:44] people and the mighty people linked
[50:46] their arms with a mighty God and and
[50:48] they did all kinds of Mighty things amen
[50:50] but the story that will be told about me
[50:52] and the story that will be told about
[50:53] you is how we were so weak and we were
[50:56] so so humble amen and we were so below
[50:58] God's consideration but the grace of God
[51:01] reached down his mighty hand amen and
[51:03] took you and used you as his instrument
[51:06] spoke his word through you walked in
[51:08] your feet amen uh uh uh moved through
[51:10] your hands amen God is looking for
[51:12] weakness to make his strength known amen
[51:15] we're living in the age of perfection
[51:17] and God is looking for a people that are
[51:19] perfectly weak amen that's a see because
[51:22] uh amen see God doesn't share share his
[51:25] glory with human beings but he does
[51:26] reveal his glory through them he does
[51:29] reveal his glory through them the Bible
[51:31] said it's the riches of the glory of
[51:33] this mystery Christ in you the hope of
[51:35] glory what hope of glory would I have
[51:37] brother sister there's no glory in what
[51:39] Nathan Ericson can do there's no glory
[51:41] in what Nathan Ericson can achieve
[51:43] there's no glory in what Nathan Ericson
[51:45] knows or what I can figure out but the
[51:47] only my only hope of glory amen is for
[51:50] the nature of Jesus Christ amen to
[51:53] become tabernacled in this body Amen to
[51:55] shine out something to the world a
[51:57] strength amen that exists and abides in
[52:00] perfect
[52:01] weakness amen that's the right picture
[52:04] brother sister but we get a picture in
[52:05] our head we get a picture in our head of
[52:07] what glorious Christianity should look
[52:09] like amen but you know Paul found
[52:11] something out about that Paul said I
[52:14] become a fool in glorying we're always
[52:16] we're always kind of wanting to glory in
[52:17] who we are and how far we've come and
[52:19] how many quotes we can quote and and and
[52:22] and and what kind of a church member
[52:23] that we are and what our position is and
[52:25] what our ministry is and and all those
[52:27] kind of thing we're always looking for a
[52:28] reason to glory and Paul says you become
[52:30] a fool in glorying you're a fool in any
[52:33] glorying Paul says I glory in my
[52:37] infirmities in my infirmities that the
[52:39] power of Christ May rest upon me now how
[52:42] ridiculous how ridiculous to be to
[52:45] actually find your glory to glory in a
[52:48] state of weakness to glory in a state of
[52:51] infirmity our human Minds would tell us
[52:53] surely amen surely it's got to be surely
[52:56] the picture is wrong surely we must
[52:59] become strong surely we've got to become
[53:01] wise surely we've got to become Mighty
[53:04] amen but God doesn't choose the mighty
[53:06] things of this world he chooses the base
[53:08] things of this world to bring to not
[53:10] things that are God is looking for
[53:11] foolish people amen with foolish hopes
[53:14] foolish Ambitions foolish potentials
[53:17] amen and to and to make to make foolish
[53:20] the wisdom of the
[53:22] wise I I love this friends this is H
[53:25] this means everything to me to realize
[53:27] amen that God is not counting on me for
[53:29] anything other than Faith amen other
[53:32] than faith in what he has done he's not
[53:34] looking for my help he's not looking for
[53:36] my intellect he's not looking for my
[53:39] wisdom he's not looking for my
[53:40] assistance amen but he's looking for a
[53:42] vessel amen that he can inhabit he's
[53:45] looking for surrender so he can take
[53:48] over and he can do the thing brother and
[53:49] sister God is going to be the Invincible
[53:52] Army God is going to be a perfect bride
[53:54] God is going to take a rapture amen it's
[53:57] the power of the Holy Ghost in The
[53:58] Believer is going to do all of these
[54:00] things and it's not the more that we can
[54:02] try and the more great we can become but
[54:04] it's the more that we can surrender and
[54:06] the more weak that we are amen I glory
[54:08] in my infirmities that the power of
[54:11] Christ May rest upon meise amen it's
[54:14] quite ridiculous and this is the same
[54:16] guy now this is not a nobody this is
[54:18] Paul the Apostle amen this is the one
[54:20] who brought the word of God to the
[54:22] Gentiles he's the pattern for all
[54:24] Messengers he's got Authority higher
[54:26] than an angel from heaven and it's Paul
[54:29] telling you I glory in my infirmities
[54:31] amen because I need the strength of God
[54:33] to rest upon me amen Paul Paul is the
[54:36] one who taught us about when that which
[54:38] is perfect is come the reason we've been
[54:40] waiting for a message the reason we've
[54:42] been waiting for a restoration of the
[54:44] word is cuz Paul told us there was
[54:46] Perfection coming that's why we're
[54:48] sitting here in a message church tonight
[54:50] amen because Paul said you got to expect
[54:53] Perfection it's coming Perfection is
[54:55] coming oh my but the same one who taught
[54:58] you about a perfect word is teaching you
[55:00] about perfect strength he said my grace
[55:02] is sufficient for you my strength is
[55:05] made
[55:06] perfect in weakness amen and that's the
[55:09] right way to receive the message brother
[55:11] sister you know you want to believe you
[55:12] want to you want to really get to the
[55:13] root of this message and you want to
[55:16] understand about supersede you want to
[55:18] understand about the Mighty God unveiled
[55:20] you want to understand about about all
[55:21] these things about perfect Faith you got
[55:23] to find out about perfect weakness amen
[55:26] because the brother God had brother
[55:27] brandham the message wasn't complete
[55:29] until brother brandham preached a little
[55:30] sermon called perfect strength in
[55:33] perfect weakness and you got to figure
[55:35] out perfect weakness if you're ever
[55:37] going to have that perfect Faith amen
[55:39] cuz brother sister the message didn't
[55:41] come to create a bunch of superhuman
[55:44] Christians it's not a super duper show
[55:47] amen it's weak people who receiv
[55:49] received a perfect word and a perfect
[55:51] word can do perfect things in people
[55:53] that are perfectly weak wow hallelujah
[55:57] amen you can't see the Masterpiece until
[55:59] you see the flaw because it's the flaw
[56:01] that makes the Masterpiece and you'll
[56:03] never get the picture right about the
[56:05] grace of God in this day about your
[56:07] adoption your election amen your
[56:10] predestination your rapture amen I'll
[56:12] tell you what makes the picture so
[56:13] beautiful is to realize all these Great
[56:16] and Powerful things that are prophesied
[56:18] about you as a member of the Bride of
[56:19] Jesus Christ amen all of those things
[56:22] will be accomplished in a flesh body
[56:24] that is perfectly weak
[56:26] amen it'll have to break through a human
[56:29] mind which is perfectly weak but there's
[56:31] perfect strength in the perfect work of
[56:33] God Amen the perfect word brings perfect
[56:37] strength to perfect weakness amen and it
[56:39] makes a perfect people now but the world
[56:41] will never recognize it brother BR said
[56:43] to the world you're a sinner right but
[56:45] to God you're not cuz you're in the
[56:48] sinless one amen and how could you be a
[56:51] sinner if you're in Christ the sinless
[56:54] one oh my Hallelujah you realize friends
[56:58] that we need Christ we need Grace we
[57:02] need his strength we need the Lord I
[57:05] know that's simple preaching tonight but
[57:07] that's what you got amen I whenever our
[57:10] mind departs from that whenever we
[57:12] become so proud or so distracted that we
[57:14] lose sight of that that's when we need a
[57:16] reminder friends and it'll come in many
[57:18] forms amen uh receive it by the words of
[57:21] a Preacher otherwise it'll come by the
[57:23] words of a of a of a little strip up or
[57:25] amen it'll come by it'll come by
[57:27] realization of a failure or some test
[57:30] amen God is always faithful to remind us
[57:32] that we need him and we're depending on
[57:34] him and we cannot take one step without
[57:36] holding his hand amen that's the kind of
[57:39] that's the kind of people the bride of
[57:40] Christ is now that's exactly scriptural
[57:43] amen the Bible spoke of the leosan age
[57:46] and it said that there would be a group
[57:47] of people amen that would say oh no I'm
[57:50] rich I'm increased with Goods I got
[57:53] everything I need I'm good I don't need

[59:15] tell you that need is the evidence of
[59:18] who you are it is a Vindication of bride
[59:20] material if you didn't feel like you

[1:00:22] but I did it
[1:00:24] anyway amen oh friends you talk about
[1:00:27] the foolishness of God how ridiculous

[1:03:59] scary deep mature spiritual right Regal
[1:04:03] Christian amen no it's because of the
[1:04:05] one you're carrying on the inside of you
[1:04:08] amen it's a king's message and he's
[1:04:11] afraid of the one you represent now see
[1:04:14] we we got to we got to learn the lesson
[1:04:16] sometime if we're ever going to overcome
[1:04:18] brother Bram said in perfect strength he
[1:04:21] said there's one thing we've got to
[1:04:23] master if we expect to fulfill God's
[1:04:25] desire in our life H how many how many
[1:04:28] would want how many would uh just
[1:04:30] acknowledge I want that I want to
[1:04:32] fulfill his desire sure I want God's
[1:04:34] purpose for my life to be fulfilled I I
[1:04:36] want to do what God desires me to do
[1:04:39] amen it's a that's a precious desire
[1:04:42] amen that that that's how every
[1:04:43] Christian feels I want to I want to do
[1:04:46] what he desires me to do brother Bram
[1:04:48] said there's only one way to do it you
[1:04:50] got to master the thought of human
[1:04:54] ability the thought of human ability
[1:04:57] just the very thought Amen brother Bram
[1:04:59] said you get to a spot where we think
[1:05:01] that we can do it with our own
[1:05:03] intelligence and our own abilities you
[1:05:05] got to master that way you got to master
[1:05:08] that in such a way that you can get rid
[1:05:09] of the thing and lay it aside so that
[1:05:12] God can use us and make a complete
[1:05:17] surrender that's an overcoming life
[1:05:19] friends that's a powerful Christian
[1:05:22] that's a real Overcomer is somebody who
[1:05:25] is so surrender to God until they are a
[1:05:28] master of even the thought of I can do
[1:05:30] it even the thought of I'm good enough
[1:05:33] even the thought of I'm smart enough you
[1:05:35] got to master that thing get it to the
[1:05:37] side get it out of your way so that God
[1:05:39] can actually use you amen we've seen
[1:05:42] amen we've been around this message a
[1:05:43] lot of time a long time we've seen a lot
[1:05:45] of stuffed shirts we've seen a lot of
[1:05:48] big egos we we've seen a lot of oneman
[1:05:50] shows we've seen a lot of big proud
[1:05:53] spiritual people but I'll tell you what
[1:05:54] kind of people God God's looking for is
[1:05:56] somebody who's mastered all of that amen
[1:05:59] somebody maybe now maybe you had to go
[1:06:00] through a long backstory to get to that
[1:06:03] place but when you get to the place
[1:06:05] where every last thought of I can is
[1:06:07] gone amen now you're in the condition
[1:06:09] God can do something to
[1:06:12] you God doesn't respect persons no we
[1:06:15] shouldn't respect our own person amen
[1:06:18] now the reason Paul is preaching this to
[1:06:20] the Corinthian Church in the first place
[1:06:22] is because the Corinthian Church they
[1:06:24] were they were kind kind of a leading
[1:06:26] Church in the community you see they
[1:06:28] were kind of they were kind of they had
[1:06:29] a lot of big shots at the church a lot
[1:06:32] of aristocratic people in the
[1:06:33] congregation and they had a lot of good
[1:06:35] preachers and so you had all these
[1:06:37] people what what you look at the way
[1:06:39] they were all caught up and thinking
[1:06:40] Paul Paul will deal with them in First
[1:06:42] Corinthians and mention again in second
[1:06:44] Corinthians it's all these people
[1:06:45] talking about well I I I'm with Paul you
[1:06:48] know I I well I believe it the way
[1:06:50] Apollos teaches it and you know well I'm
[1:06:53] I'm kind of in the circle with sephus
[1:06:54] and his guys and and so they had all
[1:06:56] that's where all their thinking was is
[1:06:59] you know whose church do you go to and
[1:07:01] what Circle are you in and what teacher
[1:07:03] do you listen to and who's who and amen
[1:07:05] and who's the great one and amen who's
[1:07:07] important and who's the best preacher
[1:07:09] and who's got the biggest church and all
[1:07:11] those kind of ways of thinking amen and
[1:07:13] Paul had to come and and he before he
[1:07:15] could preach anything else to him he had
[1:07:17] to pull out the rug and say there's no
[1:07:19] flesh no flesh that can glory in the
[1:07:22] presence of the Lord God's not looking
[1:07:24] for big God God's not looking for who's
[1:07:27] who he doesn't care what Circle you're
[1:07:30] in amen he's looking for weakness
[1:07:34] foolishness amen he's not looking for
[1:07:36] the mighty and the noble amen and the
[1:07:38] and the most anointed as we think amen
[1:07:41] he's not looking for that at all Paul
[1:07:43] said you're carnal he said oh yeah Paul
[1:07:45] Apollo sephus all name dropping you're
[1:07:48] carnal amen you're thinking on this
[1:07:50] church level it's all
[1:07:53] flesh but flesh can't glory in it
[1:07:56] presence amen amen it'd be the same
[1:07:58] thing it'd be same thing for me or for
[1:08:00] you say well you know I go to truart
[1:08:02] Tabernacle and Wayne Lawson's my pastor
[1:08:04] and I'm glad for that of course amen but
[1:08:06] that's not where my identity is that's
[1:08:08] not where my strength is I'm not a
[1:08:10] somebody CU I'm a preacher I'm not a
[1:08:12] somebody because of how many quotes I
[1:08:13] can quote I'm not a somebody of how many
[1:08:15] what churches I've preached at or what
[1:08:17] pulpits I've been behind friends I'm a
[1:08:19] nobody I'm a foolish person amen but God
[1:08:23] has chosen the foolish things of this
[1:08:24] world amen and he'll confound the wisdom
[1:08:27] of the wise God's looking for weakness
[1:08:29] friends but how many people are really
[1:08:31] willing to be
[1:08:33] weak amen you got to remember what we
[1:08:35] really are friends we're like David's
[1:08:37] Mighty Men you could go down back in the
[1:08:39] Old Testament you can read a lot of
[1:08:41] great things about David's Mighty Men
[1:08:42] and what they did I mean they were
[1:08:43] Legendary Heroes you know the kind of
[1:08:46] guys that would slay Giants and climb
[1:08:48] over walls and and uh jump into pits
[1:08:51] with lions and wrestle them and do all
[1:08:53] this kind of crazy stuff but you see and
[1:08:55] we look at that and we think man you
[1:08:57] know what a bunch of super guys but
[1:08:59] you're missing the backstory you're
[1:09:02] missing the backstory amen cuz you read
[1:09:04] a little bit early you realize how they
[1:09:05] all got to David in the first place amen
[1:09:08] they were they were criminals they were
[1:09:11] they were they were murderers they were
[1:09:13] they were rejects they were outcasts
[1:09:16] they were people that the world didn't
[1:09:17] care about they were people that were
[1:09:19] hunted they were fugitives they were
[1:09:21] weak they were people of failure people
[1:09:23] that messed up people with backgr and
[1:09:25] Back stories of how it didn't work out
[1:09:28] failures that's how you become a mighty
[1:09:31] man amen is it doesn't matter what kind
[1:09:33] of condition you come out of but if you
[1:09:35] can get to the king that's right you
[1:09:37] could be a mighty man excuse me I'm just
[1:09:39] suffering my
[1:09:40] throat
[1:09:46] amen is this all right tonight yeah amen
[1:09:50] and so you know you got to think about
[1:09:52] your
[1:09:53] backstory you got to think about what
[1:09:54] you've been through through in your life
[1:09:56] and maybe all that maybe maybe sometimes
[1:09:59] we're we're sitting in our current
[1:10:01] condition and we're thinking this is as
[1:10:03] much as I'll ever be this is as far as
[1:10:05] I'll ever go this is as high as I'll
[1:10:07] ever live because I've tried before and
[1:10:10] it didn't work out there was a man named
[1:10:12] Gideon Gideon one time amen who received
[1:10:15] a message he actually received it from
[1:10:17] an angel of the Lord an angel appears to
[1:10:19] Gideon but see at the time that he's
[1:10:21] hearing this message he doesn't even
[1:10:22] realize who's speaking he thought it was
[1:10:24] just some guy you know you know right
[1:10:26] and so some guy amen would come to
[1:10:28] Gideon's church on Thursday night and he
[1:10:30] would start talking to Gideon about hey
[1:10:32] Gideon you're a mighty man and Gideon's
[1:10:35] like no I'm
[1:10:37] not no I'm not he said look around look
[1:10:41] at my house I'm living in a home of
[1:10:43] idolatry we don't have the victory we're
[1:10:46] slaves to the to the enemy to the
[1:10:48] Canaanites uh there's nothing about my
[1:10:51] life that says mighty there's not even
[1:10:53] anything that says successful I'm a
[1:10:56] slave I'm a I'm overcome I'm I I'm
[1:10:59] nothing I I'm a son of an of a house of
[1:11:01] idolatry that's all that I am and that's
[1:11:04] really what he was yeah so how
[1:11:06] ridiculous was it for somebody to show
[1:11:08] up at his doorstep and say hey Gideon
[1:11:11] hail Gideon that Mighty Man of Valor
[1:11:14] Gideon never fought in a battle Gideon
[1:11:16] had never he'd never LED an army amen
[1:11:18] he'd never won a battle in his life all
[1:11:20] he'd ever done is roll over amen and and
[1:11:23] let every kind of Idol come in he was
[1:11:25] living his home was a mess his life was
[1:11:27] a mess that's the kind of condition that
[1:11:29] came but I'll tell you what changes
[1:11:30] things is when you realize it's not just
[1:11:32] some man talking to you but it's the
[1:11:35] angel It's the angel of the Lord that
[1:11:37] appears to You In a Pulpit and he hails
[1:11:40] you he says you're an invincible Army
[1:11:43] amen you're the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:11:44] you're sinless you're spotless you're
[1:11:46] Victorious you're Rapture material and
[1:11:49] all those kind of things friends you got
[1:11:51] if as long as your eyes are on the
[1:11:52] weakness amen you're you're you're
[1:11:54] you're you're always going to be in that
[1:11:56] condition but if you could get like
[1:11:57] Gideon and say well hey if I'm chosen of
[1:12:00] the Lord where are those Miracles where
[1:12:03] is that overcoming power now you're
[1:12:05] getting real dangerous for the devil
[1:12:07] amen where is that Holy Ghost Power
[1:12:09] where is that Joy where is that peace
[1:12:12] where is that overcoming amen where is
[1:12:15] it it wasn't doubt saying it now amen he
[1:12:18] all of a sudden realized the potential
[1:12:20] that was in him right God Amen oh and
[1:12:23] that's how you become a Mighty Man
[1:12:25] yes sir brother B said notice it takes
[1:12:28] the weakest the rejected and practically
[1:12:31] every hero God ever had on the front
[1:12:33] line was that kind of person weak and
[1:12:36] rejected right a person that was
[1:12:38] rejected a person that thought he was
[1:12:40] insufficient a person that had no
[1:12:42] ability at all then that person brother
[1:12:45] Bram said is just in good shape for God
[1:12:47] to start using it that's right oh
[1:12:50] friends amen if you're weak tonight feel
[1:12:53] rejected tonight you're in really good
[1:12:56] shape you're in really good shape isn't
[1:12:59] the word of God encouraging they say oh
[1:13:02] I I came to church tonight I felt so
[1:13:04] cast down I felt so insufficient I feel
[1:13:08] so weak tonight I feel like the weakest
[1:13:09] Christian a Believer spoken word
[1:13:11] Tabernacle maybe the weakest Christian
[1:13:13] in the state of Ohio I might be the
[1:13:15] weakest Christian in the body of Christ
[1:13:16] well then you're in great shape you're
[1:13:19] in great shape tonight cuz you're in the
[1:13:21] shape where God can use you brother B
[1:13:23] said God takes those kind of people and
[1:13:25] and that's his Heroes on the front line
[1:13:27] see you got to understand amen that when
[1:13:29] you're weak amen when you've tried and
[1:13:31] you failed when you got a back story
[1:13:34] you're the stuff heroes are made out
[1:13:36] of God that's the stuff God's heroes are
[1:13:39] made out of see brother we read there
[1:13:43] how the First Corinthians labels Christ
[1:13:45] now to the Jews he's he's this to the to
[1:13:48] the Greeks he's foolishness but to us
[1:13:51] he's wisdom and he's power now friends I
[1:13:55] want to be a wise Christian and I want
[1:13:57] to be a powerful Christian if you're
[1:14:00] Desiring that you got to accept it in
[1:14:02] the form that it would revealed itself
[1:14:04] in amen because our only Power our only
[1:14:07] wisdom is Christ himself is that right
[1:14:10] now watch now watch how Christ would
[1:14:12] come now we think well I I'm supposed to
[1:14:14] be I'm a Christian I'm I'm a message
[1:14:17] believer I'm supposed to be
[1:14:18] powerful Jesus was powerful and here's
[1:14:22] how he was described to us a tender root
[1:14:25] out of a dry ground he had no Beauty we
[1:14:28] should desire him in other words you
[1:14:31] would have went to Jesus church and went
[1:14:32] I don't see what the big deal is he's
[1:14:35] not even that good of a Preacher he's
[1:14:36] not even that goodlooking he's not don't
[1:14:38] even sound that smart he talks like a
[1:14:39] Galilean he's how how could this be the
[1:14:42] Messiah isn't this the carpenter son who
[1:14:46] I I grew up with that guy I know where
[1:14:48] he came from I know who his parents are
[1:14:50] it couldn't be him that's the kind of
[1:14:52] power God shows amen amen stricken the
[1:14:55] Bible said he was smitten he was
[1:14:58] afflicted if you ever been Afflicted in
[1:15:00] your life amen then you're showing the
[1:15:03] same kind of power he showed cuz he was
[1:15:05] St smitten he was stricken he was
[1:15:07] afflicted and he was silent like a lamb
[1:15:10] to the slaughter it didn't budge him he
[1:15:12] didn't have anything to prove he didn't
[1:15:14] need to he didn't need to let the whole
[1:15:16] world know who he was and and what a big
[1:15:19] shot that he was but he was deity he was
[1:15:22] he was he was Heavenly Majesty he was he
[1:15:25] was he was royalty Divinity amen but he
[1:15:29] didn't feel the need to impress
[1:15:32] us he didn't feel the need to impress us
[1:15:35] now that means that some of us have got
[1:15:37] a lesson to learn about power and wisdom
[1:15:40] amen because power and wisdom amen of
[1:15:43] the greatest order the highest order was
[1:15:45] found in the man Christ Jesus amen and
[1:15:47] it was so humble when it manifested
[1:15:50] itself amongst us till the world passed
[1:15:52] right over the top of it and even
[1:15:53] rejected it right
[1:15:55] and that was the power and wisdom of God
[1:15:57] now why do we think that when we become
[1:15:59] powerful Christians and when we become
[1:16:01] very deep message Believers amen that
[1:16:04] that we got to let everybody know what a
[1:16:05] big shot we are we got to let everybody
[1:16:07] know how important and we got to we got
[1:16:09] to carry ourselves in such a way and
[1:16:11] remind everybody who they're talking to
[1:16:13] amen and all these kind of things and
[1:16:15] you know and how dare he say that to me
[1:16:17] how dare she treat me that way how dare
[1:16:19] you know how dare people not recognize
[1:16:21] who I am but they didn't recognize who
[1:16:23] he was and he was all power he was all
[1:16:26] wisdom but there's something about deity
[1:16:29] friends deity doesn't have anything to
[1:16:30] prove deity doesn't have any insecurity
[1:16:33] deity is not jealous deity doesn't
[1:16:35] compete with others deity is humble yeah
[1:16:39] he thought it not robbery to be equal
[1:16:41] with God but being found and fashion as
[1:16:44] a man he humbled
[1:16:46] himself even to the
[1:16:48] Cross oh friends then amen then we're
[1:16:52] not going to get by acting like some
[1:16:54] kind of a Big Shot no we're not going to
[1:16:56] get by a bunch of proud church members
[1:17:00] amen but if we could get weak if we
[1:17:02] could get humble amen what kind of a
[1:17:04] power could come out of your life or my
[1:17:06] life I'll tell you what you need to do
[1:17:08] you need to start thinking
[1:17:10] ridiculous start thinking
[1:17:13] ridiculous
[1:17:14] amen oh what what cuz what would you
[1:17:17] look like if you wielded all the power
[1:17:19] of Heaven what would you look like to
[1:17:22] your community what would you look like
[1:17:24] to your family what would you look like
[1:17:25] to your church if you wielded all the
[1:17:27] power of heaven and to Snapp of your
[1:17:30] fingers you could bring 12 Legions of
[1:17:32] angels I know what I'd look like and it
[1:17:35] didn't it wasn't Isaiah
[1:17:37] 53 amen so so smart guys like me have to
[1:17:41] listen to Jesus when he says learn of me
[1:17:44] learn come and learn of me praise the
[1:17:47] Lord I'm the Son of God right I'm
[1:17:51] Meek oh I'm lowly
[1:17:55] amen friends you know very well why he
[1:17:57] took on that form because he was coming
[1:17:59] to get a hold of some people that were
[1:18:02] meek and lowly the weak things of this
[1:18:05] world the foolish things of this world
[1:18:08] uh the kind of people that even their
[1:18:10] friends and family would look at and say
[1:18:12] him a Christian her a Christian
[1:18:14] ridiculous but that's who God was coming
[1:18:16] for friends he's meek and lowly we got
[1:18:18] to learn something from Jesus amen Jesus
[1:18:21] Jesus wielded the power of a Son of God
[1:18:24] and his his adoption wasn't the kind of
[1:18:26] adoption we are looking for amen he was
[1:18:29] so Meek he was so lonely he was the
[1:18:31] littlest guy in the room he was like
[1:18:33] they said to brother brandom when you
[1:18:35] went and talked to him you felt like you
[1:18:36] were the big man and he was a nobody oh
[1:18:39] friends that's the character of Christ
[1:18:41] that's where he makes his power known
[1:18:43] amen if there's one thing amen so many
[1:18:46] times we're looking for the key and just
[1:18:48] the right key just the right word if we
[1:18:50] could just read the if we could study up
[1:18:51] the right quote or preach the right
[1:18:53] sermon or say the right thing or do the
[1:18:55] right thing then we would somehow unlock
[1:18:57] the potential it's by humility friends
[1:19:01] it's by it's not in running it's in
[1:19:02] resting it's not in trying it's in
[1:19:05] trusting amen oh it's not it's not in
[1:19:08] wondering it's in praying amen it's how
[1:19:11] little can you get brother BR said now
[1:19:13] if you're a somebody he said God can use
[1:19:15] you but you got to become a nobody so he
[1:19:18] can make a somebody out of you God's
[1:19:20] looking for nobody's friends amen I
[1:19:23] wonder if there's somebody looking for
[1:19:24] him him and nobody looking for him
[1:19:27] tonight oh the word of God brother BR
[1:19:29] said is foreign to people it's unusual
[1:19:32] God always does the unusual that's why
[1:19:34] we he missed him because they thought he
[1:19:35] would come they thought he would come
[1:19:37] and do things with Godlike power that
[1:19:39] they would do they thought he would rip
[1:19:42] open the temple veil and step out with
[1:19:44] shining gold armor and a magical sword
[1:19:46] and you know say hey Caiaphas I've
[1:19:48] arrived and and we're going to go
[1:19:50] overthrow the Romans and we're going to
[1:19:51] take over the world and we're going to
[1:19:53] put everybody under our foot and we're
[1:19:55] going to usher in a kingdom like David
[1:19:57] and Solomon only dreamed of and that was
[1:19:59] what they were thinking and so when he
[1:20:01] came and he was born on a pile of
[1:20:04] manure how could they receive him as the
[1:20:07] Christ it didn't look like what they
[1:20:09] expected but I'm so glad that he defies
[1:20:13] our
[1:20:14] expectations it's good that he does it
[1:20:16] friends it's good that he does the
[1:20:18] unusual there was a woman one time the
[1:20:21] Pharisees got a hold of her she wasn't a
[1:20:23] good woman she was life was a wreck she
[1:20:26] was a sinner and they caught her
[1:20:27] red-handed and they drug her to Jesus
[1:20:30] they said hey we're going to take you to
[1:20:31] this guy he's the he says he's the word
[1:20:34] and the word has got a couple things to
[1:20:36] say about what you've been doing how
[1:20:39] many ever felt like that I can't go to
[1:20:40] church tonight I I I I I'm so messed up
[1:20:43] in in in a situation I've fallen in such
[1:20:46] a trap I can't go hear that word cuz
[1:20:49] that word's got some things to say about
[1:20:52] what I'm
[1:20:53] doing but it wasn't what the word said
[1:20:56] it was what the word did and what the
[1:20:59] word does always defies our
[1:21:02] expectation he's always more gracious
[1:21:05] he's always more merciful he's always
[1:21:07] more good than we expect he's a gracious
[1:21:11] God oh so many time we so afraid to take
[1:21:14] your issues to Jesus you'll be surprised
[1:21:18] You' be surprised what he'll say you'll
[1:21:20] be surprised what he'll do if you take
[1:21:22] your problems to Jesus that's right amen
[1:21:25] amen don't let him make don't make it an
[1:21:26] excuse why you can't go to him amen go
[1:21:29] to him go to him I know there's
[1:21:32] Pharisees all through the church
[1:21:33] everywhere you look there's legalists
[1:21:35] there's judgers and amen there's people
[1:21:37] even men even preachers make make they
[1:21:39] build whole Ministries on just tearing
[1:21:41] people down and beating them down and
[1:21:42] making them feel bad and condemned but
[1:21:44] friends the word never hurt anybody like
[1:21:47] that Jesus never hurt anybody like that
[1:21:49] if you could get past all that church
[1:21:51] stuff get past the legalism get past the
[1:21:54] religion the tradition and all those
[1:21:56] things if you could get to Jesus tonight
[1:21:58] he'll surprise you he won't act like you
[1:22:00] expect amen because his strength is made
[1:22:03] perfect in weakness he's looking for
[1:22:06] weak people to come to him and he could
[1:22:08] be their strength There's Hope friends I
[1:22:11] know it sounds ridiculous but there's
[1:22:13] hope there's hope for whatever
[1:22:15] situations you're in There's Hope for
[1:22:16] whatever you're dealing with There's
[1:22:18] Hope even if you failed a 100 times
[1:22:20] there's hope that's right but Jesus is
[1:22:23] the only one who's God he's the power
[1:22:25] and the wisdom of
[1:22:27] God oh it's so good that he defies our
[1:22:29] expectations and that's why brother Bram
[1:22:31] said you'll do ridiculous things Y when
[1:22:34] you want to see Jesus yeah you'll do
[1:22:37] ridiculous things when you want to see
[1:22:38] Jesus there's nothing going to stand in
[1:22:40] your way they can call you a Holy Roller
[1:22:41] or whatever they want to but if you got
[1:22:43] your mind made up to see Jesus you'll go
[1:22:45] see them anyhow that's why he said when
[1:22:47] Jesus is around there's a lot of noise
[1:22:50] that's why sometimes you come to church
[1:22:51] you think why you know why why is that
[1:22:53] guy hollering I know about his problems

[1:23:01] the altar you know why I I know what
[1:23:03] kind of situations they're dealing with
[1:23:04] but I'll tell you what it is they get

[1:23:16] through cuz they know that he's the only
[1:23:18] one with the answers he's the only one
[1:23:21] with the strength he's the only thing
[1:23:23] that has what we need of friends that's
[1:23:25] what makes the bride of Christ is the
[1:23:27] bride needs Jesus that's what makes her

[1:23:33] and they need him enough they'll push
[1:23:35] through denomination they'll push
[1:23:36] through tradition they'll push through
[1:23:38] churchianity they'll push through
[1:23:40] everything just to get to Jesus the Lord

[1:26:38] 10 11 years now and the and the more I
[1:26:41] go on the more
[1:26:43] absurd the whole institution looks to
[1:26:46] me the more foolish how many preacher

[1:26:51] nights oh God saying oh God what am I
[1:26:54] going to say say tomorrow how many how
[1:26:55] much weakness is involved how much
[1:26:57] Humanity I think if people really
[1:26:59] sometimes I think if you really
[1:27:00] understood how much Humanity goes into
[1:27:02] preaching it would alarm people it's
[1:27:05] foolish it's foolish as brother Wayne
[1:27:08] would say it would be much more
[1:27:09] advantagous if he would use Angels it
[1:27:11] would be way better we'd be way better
[1:27:13] off if you came to church on Thursday
[1:27:15] night and an angel of from Heaven
[1:27:17] slipped down through the rafters and
[1:27:18] took stuck the pulpit but it's not it's
[1:27:20] Nathan Erikson The Village Idiot of
[1:27:22] idiot Village it's foolish friends it's
[1:27:25] foolish to think of preaching that God
[1:27:27] would take a man a young man a man of
[1:27:29] failures a man of infirmities a man with
[1:27:32] issues a man who needs Jesus and then
[1:27:34] that man is supposed to speak words that
[1:27:36] can help somebody else and that's God's
[1:27:38] program but it is God's program cuz God
[1:27:42] doesn't want to use Angels he wants to
[1:27:44] use human beings and so he uses
[1:27:46] preachers he uses deacons he uses
[1:27:49] Housewives he uses Factory workers he
[1:27:51] uses Farmers he uses anybody he can get
[1:27:53] a hold of and the weaker they are the
[1:27:56] better off they are amen cuz then they
[1:27:58] don't get their own pride in go to God's
[1:28:00] way oh it's a foolishness of preaching
[1:28:03] but it can save your soul tonight amen
[1:28:05] it might not be the greatest preacher in
[1:28:07] the world but it can save your soul
[1:28:09] tonight the preaching of the Gospel I
[1:28:12] tell you it gives a man courage amen
[1:28:15] it's an absurd institution it's
[1:28:17] ridiculous it's a dumb way to do it by
[1:28:19] our human way of thinking but that's how
[1:28:21] God
[1:28:22] operates he takes foolish things right
[1:28:26] and he does mighty Works yes sir he does
[1:28:29] mighty Works how many of you were
[1:28:30] brought into the kingdom of God in the
[1:28:32] first place because of the witness of a
[1:28:33] Believer and my when they first when
[1:28:36] they first reached out to you and
[1:28:38] brought you into the fold and they that
[1:28:40] person was so heroic to you you thought
[1:28:42] that was the most spiritual person on
[1:28:44] the and then you went to church with
[1:28:45] them for a little while and you realized
[1:28:48] hey I appreciate what that guy did for
[1:28:50] me to witness to me but he's got some
[1:28:52] issues she's got some issues that's the
[1:28:55] beautiful thing about it friends we've
[1:28:56] all got issues amen but we got Jesus we
[1:29:01] got the Holy
[1:29:02] Ghost amen it's the strength of God it
[1:29:05] can do perfect things through perfect
[1:29:09] weakness Hallelujah see that's the thing
[1:29:11] about it friends you got to recognize
[1:29:13] what deity In the Flesh looks like it
[1:29:14] doesn't look like what you expect what
[1:29:16] did deity In the Flesh look like in the
[1:29:18] backside of a desert next to a burning
[1:29:20] bush amen crying and stuttering over all
[1:29:22] of his failures amen deity amen deity in
[1:29:26] flesh amen out naked in a boat fishing
[1:29:29] amen it didn't look like amen when
[1:29:30] you're looking at the backstory it
[1:29:32] doesn't look like what you think deity
[1:29:33] In the Flesh looks like we always want
[1:29:35] to look at how he parted the sea but we
[1:29:37] won't want to look 10 seconds earlier
[1:29:39] when he was crying and begging God to
[1:29:41] come on the scene oh friends deing the
[1:29:44] flesh when you look at it it's
[1:29:46] ridiculous you see cowardness you see
[1:29:49] fear you see temper you see worry you
[1:29:52] see complexes you see all all manner of
[1:29:54] weakness right but if you watch a little
[1:29:57] while you'll see
[1:30:00] deity that's why that's why God does
[1:30:03] things through prophets you know that's
[1:30:04] the great Obstacle of this message this
[1:30:06] great this message is the greatest
[1:30:07] message ever hit to the Earth sir but to
[1:30:10] receive this message you're going to
[1:30:11] have to get over a pretty big obstacle
[1:30:13] because you're going to have to look
[1:30:14] past the veil of a Kentucky hillbilly
[1:30:17] with a 7eventh grade education amen that
[1:30:19] is the that is the cost of Entry Amen to
[1:30:22] get into this word amen is to get over
[1:30:25] the speed bump of William brandom but
[1:30:28] see if you're ever going to see the
[1:30:29] message you're going to have to
[1:30:31] recognize that deity was speaking from
[1:30:33] the lips of William brandom as a
[1:30:35] mouthpiece of God well then just bring
[1:30:37] it down a few more steps if you can
[1:30:39] recognize deity in a prophet you're
[1:30:41] going to have to accept deity In the
[1:30:43] Flesh of your
[1:30:45] pastor you're going to have to accept
[1:30:47] deity behind the Flesh of a Preacher
[1:30:50] you're going to have to accept deity in
[1:30:52] your spouse your
[1:30:56] neighbor and guess what church you're
[1:30:58] going to have to recognize deity in you
[1:31:02] Christ in you the hope of
[1:31:05] glory that's what that oh it's a big
[1:31:08] obstacle I know to our carnal minds but
[1:31:10] that's where we got to get to to really
[1:31:12] see the
[1:31:14] message and that's why to this world the
[1:31:16] message is the most foolish thing how
[1:31:19] ridiculous how
[1:31:21] ridiculous how ridiculous man to your
[1:31:24] neighbors and brother Billy you've been

[1:31:35] times sitting on someone's porch or
[1:31:37] talking to that coworker and that you
[1:31:39] know and trying to share about this
[1:31:40] great message of of of of of uh of
[1:31:44] powers of deity restored to the bride a
[1:31:46] perfect word restored and they're
[1:31:47] looking at the messenger they're looking
